I think this stuff is AWESOME!!!  You couldn't have a simpler recipe.  Two ingredients, people!!! It tastes too good.  I make this for just about any gathering at my house, because it always gets eaten.  Just remember to let your cream cheese soften before you mix.  It is a lot easier this way.  Also I stick my rubber scraper in very hot water to help to get the sticky marshmallow cream out of the jar. Enjoy!

Used strawberry cream cheese, added 1 cup of cool whip and 2 tbsp orange juice.  Had people at the party eating dip without the fruit it was so good.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is basically the same fruit dip my family has made for years, except we add 1/4 t sugar and 1/2 vanilla extract. We also add a few drops of red food coloring to give it a pink hue. This makes it so pretty next to strawberries, watermelon, cantaloupe and fresh pineapple chunks

Very good.  If you add cool whip make sure the cream cheese and marshmallow creme are mixed well first.  Serve with a fruit and bite size cubes of pound cake!  Yum!

I love this recipe.  I usually add about 1-2T lemon juice.  It makes it smoother, and it gives it just a little bit of a kick.  Either way, this is a great dip for any kind of fruit...melons, berries, grapes, bananas, you name it!

Every since I made this receipe for the first time a couple of months ago I get requests for it all the time!  My son loves it and I have served it at several get-togethers.  Sometimes I add a bit of orange juice and I always use light strawberry cream cheese.

I have used this recipe for a few years now but I have varied it several times.  You can use any kind of the sweet flavored cream cheeses or make it with the marshmallow cream and 8 oz cream cheese and add 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder to it to make the best chocolate fruit dip ever!!!  P.S.  You can also use this as an icing on cake!

I tried this recipe 2 different ways: once as written and once with strawberry cream cheese, orange juice and whipped cream.  The original recipe was so much better!  My family didn't like the modifications at all, but the original recipe was gone that evening.  I definitely recommend making it the way it is originally written!

Perfect with any fruit, and I love the consistency! I agree with other reviewers who doubled the recipe - it's a must. I also added a few tablespoons of powdered sugar, a splash of vanilla, and food coloring. If you're out of marshmallow creme, you can melt 16 oz. marshmallows with 3 1/2 Tbsp. corn syrup and use that instead. You can't tell the difference!

We have been making this recipe for years....I even found a variation on this site that prefer much better. To make it not quite so thick and to make it go a little farther for a larger crowd add one small container of Cool Whip to it.  This is excellent with bananas, strawberries, apples.  We use other fruits too like grapes, cantelope, etc...

I took the advice of previous posters and used strawberry cream cheese (instead of regular) and added 1 cup of Cool Whip to recipe and a Tbs of OJ if needed - to thin it up.  Everyone asks me to make this for their parties - it is a hit!

So simple and so delicious - especially in the summer!  I took this to a neighbor's house and the kids loved it.  I skewered pineapple, strawberries, cantelope and melon together on wooden sticks.  It makes a great presentation without a lot of work.  If you want to add a little flavor - add some flavored liquor to it. (mint, orange, banana)

I usually make this dip with sugar free vanilla pudding that I prepare according the the directions on the package in place of the marshmallow creme, light cream cheese, and some lemon zest.

I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used strawberry cream cheese. This dip makes a party in your tummy . . . so yummy, so yummy!! For cherry flavor follow the recipe as stated except add 2 tablespoons of grenadine or maraschino cherry juice.

This is a very easy and delicious recipe....on occasion for a twist I add one pkt of powdered pina colada drink mix and that gives it a tropical flair.  Soooo good.

Very, very good.  I used fat free cream cheese and added a little orange juice to thin it out just a bit.  Couldn't tell that the cream cheese was fat free once it was mixed with the marshmallow and the orange juice.

I have made this for years, but in my family, we like lime 1 tablespoon or so of lime juice added.  It gives the dip a creamier, smoother consistency.

It's hard to believe this has only 2 ingredients yet it's so yummy!  I made this for a get together and before I could even get the other appetizers to the table the 4 kids (aged 6-16) had devoured this with the strawberries and apple slices I put with it.  There are a lot of things you could add (pineapple or other fruit juice, vanilla extract, etc.) to suit your tastes, but I like the simplicity of it as is.  It is also wonderful with Teddy Graham's/graham cracker's.  If you make it ahead of time and refrigerate it, just be sure to let it sit at room temp. a bit before serving so it softens up.

Made this for Christmas dinner and served it with Strawberries, grapes, apples and raspberries.  I don't recommend it for raspberries because the raspberries are too delicate to dip.  The fruit dip is super easy to make and my guests loved it!!  Even put it on top of their chocolate cake!  It's a little too sweet for my taste.  It's real good if you like something super sweet.  I'd serve it again but might add cool whip so it's not so rich.

I serve this all of the time. Baby showers I either add pink sprinkles or food coloring for a girl or blue sprinkles or food coloring for a boy. It's great with a third ingredient: Cool whip also.  Goes well with apples, pineapple, grapes (green), and strawberries!

Wow! Everyone loved this and wanted the recipe! The cream cheese stabilizes the marshmallow creme and cuts down on the sweetness just enough to compliment the fruit. Will be a main dip for me to bring to any party, my friends are constantly begging me to bring it.

My family has also been making this for years.  The only differences are that I add a few drops of red food coloring, as others mentioned, and I add a little Peach Schnapps.  Always a favorite at parties!

This is a recipe I have brought many times to potluck parties and it is always a big hit. Friends even request it now.  I added a tiny bit (1/8 tsp.) of coconut extract to give it a bit of a tropical flavor.  It is the best with strawberries.

So yummy! Served this at a party and found kids that don't typically eat fruit, piling some on a plate just to eat this dip. Everyone described it as "addicting". Super easy to make and I was able to make it a day in advance, saving me a ton of time on the day of our party!

Duh.  This is great stuff.  I made it for a co-worker's breakfast birthday celebration.  Served it with kiwi, cantaloupe, melon, pineapple, grapes, and peaches.  Couldn't keep my husband out of the bowl the night before.  I could eat the stuff by the spoonful.  The fruit is really an accessory to the dip.  :o)

Yummy and easy, perfect for a potluck or party.  People are usually amazed at how simple it is.  I add a tsp or so of orange juice, which helps to blend the ingredients more easily.

This is a hit at parties. Lately it's been what I take to parties because it's kid friendly and tasty. I take it with assorted fruit...grapes, strawberries, packaged apple slices, pineapple etc. I follow the recipe as directed though I add a serving spoon's worth of Lite Cool Whip I usually have in my freezer (gives it a fluffier texture) and some maraschino cherry juice for a bit of pink color. Delicious!

I made this dip exactly as posted but using strawberry cream cheese - It was AWESOME! I put a pretty bowl of the dip at the top of my 3 tiered serving platter, placed several different cut fruits on  the platters, and oh my...It was a real hit of the party, first thing gone, thank you! SO YUMMY!

This is so easy, but very tasty. I made it for a luau style barbeque with fruits like peaches, pineapple, kiwi and mango. Kids love it and so do adults. Very good with the strawberry cream cheese.

Be sure to put a tiny bit of pink food coloring in this if you are using it on a buffet table, or guests totally think it is mayonnaise!  Making it slightly pink makes all the difference in how much of it gets eaten with the fruit.  It is really good, and a shame for folks to miss it!

This turned out great.  I doubled the recipe because I didn't think it would be enough.  Turns out, a single recipe makes plenty.  It was the rave of the party!  I added a touch of vanilla, but I don't think it really needs that.

I have been making this for years, I can't understand why everyone wants to change the recipe, if you think your such a good cook then make up your own recipe instead of trying to change everyone else's.thats why i hate to read reviews, every one on  here is trying to ruin a good thing

I am rating this 5 stars AS IS. I make this all the time for the kids and they LOVE IT. Unfortunately this time I took other reviewers advice and added liquid to it which made it WAY TOO runny. The kids had a hare time keeping the dip on the fruit with the juice I added :( Next time I will make the recipe as stated!!

This turned out really good. I made it for myself/family, which turned out to be too much. But it would be a great amount for a party! I did use the strawberry cream cheese, orange juice, and cool whip with the marshmellow fluff.

I've been making this dip for YEARS with the simple addition of a tablespoon or so of Amaretto (almond flavoring for tea totallers). Wonderful stuff with apples, strawberries, peaches, graham crackers, gingerbread cookies.

This is happiness in a bowl!!!  Followed others suggestions and added a splash of orange juice.  Seved with fruit and cinnamon graham crackers.  Think it would be good as icing on a cake!!

I don't know what I love more about this recipe--the fact that it's absolutely delicious or the fact that it's so simple to make.  I also took the advice of others & added 2 Tbsp of orange juice, substituted strawberry cream cheese, & folded in some Cool Whip. This recipe is definitely worth keeping!

I also use strawberry cream cheese or pineapple instead of just plain. Also I like to add whipped topping for a lighter taste.

This has been my go-to fruit dip for 20 years.  Never met anyone who didn't like it...especially good with strawberries.  I always add a good dose of vanilla, also.

I was trying to make a fruit dip (which is not something I've done) for a shower and this had the best reviews, but I thought it sounded way to boring as some of the reviews indicated so..
I used 1-(8) ounce tub of sour cream, 8 ounces of cream cheese, 2 7 ounce jars of marshmellow creme, and about 1/4 of a cup of frozen strawberries and sauce to pink it up a little.  HUGE HIT!  This made A LOT, and could easily be cut in half for a smaller crowd.

I thought this was a great fruit dip recipe.  I adjusted it based on others' recommendations with the following:

Added 1/2 tsp Lemon Juice
Added 1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract

I mixed it all with a hand mixer...turned out great.

I think people who rate this recipe highly must be making alterations to the original. For me, the texture on this was far too thick and sticky - tough to even get it ON the fruit. Try some of the suggestions about Cool Whip, that might be what's needed here texture-wise.

So yummy!  I've made it twice.  First using strawberry cream cheese, o.j. and cool whip as others had suggested.  Then the second time I made it pretty close to the original recipe, I did add some cool whip to this batch as well though.  Surprisingly the second batch was so much yummier!  Both were well received but the original recipe is the best!

Absolutely delicious! Super easy, super good! tons of compliments and requests for the recipe. Makes my kids who don't eat much fruit, want to eat fruit. Not too sweet. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and you'd never know. I could eat this stuff by the spoonful! no need to make any changes!

This recipe was awesome! Everyone absolutely loved it. It was so simple and quick to make! Two ingredients? Doesn't get much easier than that. Some suggested adding a splash of orange juice which I didn't get to try because we were out, however the recipe was great as it is. Definitely will be a staple in my home. Can't wait to enjoy some more this weekend! Happy Cooking :)

I liked this but I think adding cool whip like another reviewer said made it even better. It cut the sweetness back a little and seemed to make it fluffier. I was looking for something to go with a fruit platter for a party and this will be perfect.

Made this for a family gathering and it was a big hit!  Could not be simpler to make.  I used strawberry cream cheese and decided to add a dash of vanilla extract along with the marshmallow creme.  So quick and easy!  Served it with fresh strawberries and fresh pineapple and it was devoured.  I can see this becoming a staple at any gathering.  Thanks for sharing, Crystal!

I made this yesterday and used it as a base to place poached pears upon.  It turned out great, and people were so surprised how easy it was to make.  I am not a fan of marshmallow cream, but the cream cheese totally changes the taste into something wonderful.

I have been making this dip for years! I was going to add the recipe on here but someone else beat me to the punch ;) Glad to see so many others enjoying this recipe. It is my favorite...never any leftovers! You can make as much or as little as you want as long as the ratio of fluff to cheese is balanced. Also, this dip can be saved in a sealed container for later and still tastes great. Yum!

I have made this before with a slight variation. I add two small containers of Yoplait yogurt (key lime pie flavor). It tastes light and refreshing!

This was not nearly as good as I expected. I added 1 cup of cool whip and some OJ as another reviewer suggested. The texture/consistency was not very pleasant and the taste was forgettable.

I've also made this many times.  I like to add powdered crystal light drink mix, so the flavor varieties are endless. My 10 year old daughter is the hit of the lunch table when I send this in her lunch!  The grown ups at work love it too!!

My mother has made this since I was little and I have always loved it!  It does shrink down in size when you make it because the marshmellow creme has so much air in it.  When combined with the cream cheese it loses it's airyness and therefore its volume.  But is great- just make more!

I was grocery shopping with a friend and saw marshmallow cream on sale for a really great price, so we each bought some. She  mentioned it made a great fruit dip mixed with cream cheese, so I bought some strawberries to try it out. I got on this website to find a recipe, because I was unsure how much of each to mix, and it's so easy and delicious! After trying it with whole strawberries, I ended up cutting all the berries up and mixing them into the dip, then dipping vanilla wafers and pretzels into it. It tasted to great, and helped make the most of the strawberries I had. 
Thanks for sharing!

LOVED IT!  Even had a guest scrapping the mixing bowl after I transported it to the serving dish.  Went over great!  I had read the comments and decided to add the powdered sugar and the vanilla, definitely worth the modification.

I tried this dip precisely because it only had two ingredients, great reviews and I didn't have much time. It is a perfect compliment to cantaloupe, apples, pears, grapes and strawberries. The best suggestion I read was to be sure to use softened cream cheese. Thanks, Crystal!

I served this at a party and everyone had the same opinion: It was delicious but overwhelmingly sweet after about 2 bites. If you happen to like dipping beautiful fruit into cheesecake (because it tastes exactly like it) then you may enjoy this. I prefer a lighter flavor/ texture paired with the natural sweetness of fresh fruit. I wanted a fruit dip, not a sweet dessert. Disappointing considering the reviews.

This was so easy and very yummy.  I made this for a jewelry party I was having.  I served it with 6 lbs of strawberries and a bunch of grapes.  Every body was asking what it was.  I was worried it wouldn't be enough but there was some left over.  Thanks for submitting!

Used light strawberry cream cheese and added 2 tbsp of OJ and 1 cup of Cool Whip as suggested by another user. So pretty and delicious!

My family has been making this for years. Blend in a little orange zest and it will make this recipe a five star recipe. It gives it a little sweet tangy flavor that really compliments the fruit. I could eat it the dip with a spoon. The zest really makes it.

Depending on the event I use a little bit of sugar free jello mix (just the powder) and it will turn the color of the jello and the flavor. It is excellent! You can also use strawberry flavored marshmallow.

I have used this same recipe for about six or seven years now, but I also add a splash of orange juice for a little extra flavor. If you would like it even sweeter I would suggest Sunny D, but it literally only takes a splash.

This is so good. I thought it would be too sweet but it wasn't. I tried it with and without vanilla. I liked it better with vanilla in it. It's a keeper.

Who would have thought that mixing two simple ingredients together would create something so divine?!  I usually hate anything with marshmallow in it, but this was incredible!  I made it to go with a fruit tray for my daughter's birthday party yesterday and everyone loved it.  My favorite fruit dipped in it was peaches.  I'll certainly make this again.  Thank you!

Very good...Made it exactly as written.  At first, it didn't seem quite sweet enough, but then I considered the fact that we would be dipping sweet fruit into it, so I didn't change it.  After about an hour in the fridge, it tasted delicious!!  Don't change a thing...it's perfect as is!

I have been making this recipe for years... You are really missing out if you don't try.... It's the best fruit dip I have ever tried... I do however melt the marshmallow a little in the microwave to make it a little easier to mix since I never have used a blender for it...

This is very yummy.  I took some other reviewers' advice and added some orange juice and cool whip.  Hmmm....I actually think I preferred the original recipe -- plain and simple.  I doubled the batch so I'd have extra and used light cream cheese.  I added 3T of OJ instead of 4T (suggestions were 2T per batch) and was I glad!  The OJ definitely gives it a distinct citrus taste so if you're not looking for that, leave out the OJ.  The cool whip isn't bad but makes it more whipped than creamy and I prefer the creamy now that I've tried it this way.  It's still very good but sometimes you just don't mess with a good thing.  I think I will try the strawberry cream cheese some time, though :)

With so many great & rave reviews I thought I had found a treasure. Boy was I wrong. It was too sweet for my 5 year old daughter's tea party guests. Will not use this again. They just ate the fruit without the dip!

Execellent dip. I added some carmel ice cream topping to it....we had both this one and the carmel one at the party. The carmel one was the bigger hit of the two.

I've made this several times for get togethers. My favorite way to make it is with flavored cream cheese, such as strawberry or wildberry cream cheese. It makes it a completely differnt flavor, and its sooo delicious!

Although the flavor is to die for, when I tried this last night for the first time, I found that the marshmallow cream shrank to nothing and even with the cream cheese in it, it fit back in the mm cr. jar with room to spare!  Why did this happen?  And here I was hoping to serve it at my daughter's wedding reception with fruit.  I'd have to make twice as much as I thought.

This fruit dip was so quick and easy to make. The biggest hardship was getting all that gooey marshmallow cream out of the jar. :) It tastes incredible with fresh cut strawberries. I gave it 4 instead of 5 because there isn't anything particularly special about the taste - it is very good, but it doesn't have any pizzaz to it. All in all a very good recipe.

Great stuff, I can actually eat it by the spoonful. Not too sweet but I still like to add some lime juice as it rounds it out a little better:) YUM

This was great. After reading other reviews I used strawberry cream cheese, a cup of fluff and a cup of cool whip along with a tablespoon of orange -pineapple juice.

Everyone loves this stuff.  Even those who claim to be "fruit purists" are dipping.  Best a room temperature for soft dipping consistency.

I read some of the negative reviews, and part of the problem may be that the two ingredients don't mix as well unless you first beat the cream cheese until smooth.  Try that, then mix in the marshmallow creme. I use this quite often, especially for office "graze days" and it's always a hit. YUM!

I have been making this dip for years now and I add a little bit of maple syrup for extra flavor.  I always get requests to make this for parties.  Make sure cream cheese is very soft before mixing with fluff or it comes out lumpy. By far one of the easiest dips to make....yummo!

Yum!  Took the advice of others and used reduced fat strawberry cream cheese and a cup of Cool Whip.  Tasted it before the Cool Whip and it was very good too - but the with that addition, it was lighter tasting.  
Goes with berries really well, but works with pretty much any fruit.

I took another posters suggestion and made this with low fat strawberry cream cheese, 2 TBS of orange juice, and 1 cup of cool whip.  Make sure to mix thoroughly in the mixer.  I also used the marshmallow fluff as the original recipe states...and added a pinch of sugar.  It got devoured at my office, there weren't any leftovers :-)

This is a great dip for all fruits and lasts quite some time in the fridge. I use one tub of whipped strawberry cream cheese instead of plain--it is wonderful! Kids and adults, as well, love it!

Growing up, the local grocery store always had a yummy fruit dip with their fruit trays and I wondered what was in it. Now I know. 
This recipe has the flavor of sweetened cream cheese with the right consistency to be a dip. Delicious!

You just can't go wrong with this dip. It is very sweet but mixed with strawberries or pound cake, it is super!!  I added 2 tbs orange juice based on other reviews and also just a touch of red food coloring because my husband thought it looked too much like sour cream and would not try it.  The pink color did the trick and looked more appealing to me too. ha  Great and super fast appetizer.

Fluffy, fabulous, fantastic, fruit dip! I could dip anything into this stuff, even just my face! Followed the suggestion of using Strawberry Cream Cheese, 2 TB OJ, and 1 c. Cool Whip, and it was a divine dessert that elicited many lip-lickings during its disappearance.

How can you not like this!?!  It's easy to whip up and easy on the palate.  I can see how it could lend itself to all of the different additions people have made, but it stands on its own, too.  If my granddaughters love it, then that's good enough for me!

This was so yummy and simple and light! I also took the suggestion of a couple reviewers below (I made two different batches) and used strawberry cream cheese instead and added a small splash of orange juice and 1 cup of cool whip. It came out really great. I made it last night as a trial run, and will be serving it at a get together tomorrow so thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  The hardest part was finding the jar of marshmallows.  A store clerk realized that I must be talking about marshmallow fluff!  The rest was easy and so good.  I followed the recipes as stated.  I will try other suggestions, but as is, this is great stuff.

Wonderful, simple recipe. I used strawberry cream cheese and added 1 tbsp OJ as suggested. I have been asked for this recipe repeatedly!

We love this simple recipe!  You can easily "doctor" it up with things like kool-aid powder, or marichino cherry juice, etc. But this recipe is a great staple.

So easy, so very sweet and definitely a party or summer BBQ favorite!  For a cheesecake version of this dip, I simply add a 6 oz container of sour cream and voila! Just like a new york style cheesecake without the guilt! (Goes fabulous with strawberries & graham cracker sticks!)  And make sure all your ingredients are room temp! They'll combine so much easier (especially if you add the sour cream)!

This dip is extremely sweet.  I wouldn't serve it with fruit, if you follow some of the recommended suggestions (add 2 TBS of OJ).  I used pretzels and it was the perfect combo of salty and sweet. I will serve again but only with pretzels.

I made this for an 11 yr olds Bday party, and would you know that the girls did not care for it! I liked it but found it really sweet. Mine came out really fluffy. The next day I stirred it up and it came out smooth and nice.
I made it as suggested by DWILSON0116:  Use light Strawberry Cream Cheese. add 2 TBS of orange juice when mixing with the marshmallow ceam. Finally, fold in 1 cup of Cool Whip.

Obviously this recipe could not be any easier. Make sure that the cream cheese is softened! You can switch it up by adding strawberry cream cheese instead of plain. Takes great with grapes, strawberries, cantalope, honeydew, and pineapple. Great to have out for guests in the summer.

I just made this the first time for a party.  It is very good and obviously simple.  I added a little vanilla and just enough food coloring to turn it light pink.  My husband ate all the leftovers and asked me to make more.

I make this at every gathering.  EVERYONE LOVES IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Keep it simple and follow this recipe.  Don't add anything else.  Remember less is more.  My friend makes it with sugar and yogurt, I hated it and so did everyone else.  Everyone says they like mine better with just the cream chesse and marshmellow.

I've made this dip for years - served it at showers, wedding receptions, church gatherings and at-home get togethers.  It's always a big hit and everyone wants the recipe.  That's what is so great - just 2 ingredients and so delicious!  No need to add anything!

You can add a liitle jello mix to the fluff & cream cheese to flavor the dip. I personally liked strawberry jello, I also tried the blue raspberry but didn't like as well.

Delicious and simple.  I came across strawberry marshmallow creme in the store, so I used it with plain cream cheese.  I aded a teaspoon of almond extract as recommended by some previous reviewers.  I made it a day ahead so it would have time to chill and for the flavors to blend.  It was toooo good.  I finished off the bowl with a spoon.  I served it with strawberries, bananas, fresh pineapple, green grapes, and apples.  I thought it tasted best with the bananas.

This is always a hit, especially with teenagers. They can't seem to get enough. Make sure your cream cheese is room temperature. I find it works best if you cream it by hand and then use a sturdy whisk to add the marshmallow fluff. If your cream cheese is not adequately softened, you will have lumps in the dip. I have made this recipe with plain cream chees and with strawberry flavored cream cheese. I prefer plain, but many do like it with the strawberry cream cheese.

This is a good recipe.  I added a bit of lemon zest and about 1 t. of fresh-squeezed lemon juice.  It is a good addition, giving the dip a zesty bit of flavor!

I noticed that this wasn't enough for a big crowd so I doubled the ingredients. It was a big hit for both adults and children.  This is also good with celery sticks and cut up broccoli. My mom put a spoonful of this on top of a brownie and that was even better. We give this 2 thumbs up!

I liked it but my guests barely touched it, that's why i'm giving it 4 stars.  It tasted so much better the next day so I would make this recipe a day or two ahead.

SCRUMPTIOULICIOUS!  (Is that a word?)  I did add 2T of OJ to make the consistency a little more loose, used the strawberry cream cheese as suggested by other reviews and added 8oz of homemade whipped topping (heavy whipping cream and sugar).  I, also, added 2 drops of red food dye and added 1t of coconut extract.  I served this dip in a chip 'n dip bowl with cantaloupe, apples (be sure to coat your apples with a little lemon juice to prevent them from turning brown) and strawberries.  Needless to say, not only was the presentation very colorful, it made a very appetizing and "calorie conscious" appetizer which my guests loved.  No one was feeling any guilt eating my fruit 'n dip appetizer.  If I could give it more stars, I would.

My family has been using this recipe since it appeared on the back of a Philadelphia Cream Cheese package in the 90's. The most important things to know about this recipe is that you have to mix it until smooth, and be careful the fruit you use to dip it with. The best fruits I found are the ones that go well with Cheesecake. Try using Strawberries, Pineapple, Peaches, Apples; but not flimsy fruit like oranges, and such.

You can very simply change the flavor and/or color of the dip, by adding half of a package of dry kool-aid powder.  For a strawberry flavor, use strawberry kool-aid.  For orange flavor, use orange kool-aid.  For cherry flavor, use cherry kool-aid.  For grape flavor, use grape kool-aid.  For lemon flavor, use lemon kool-aid.  Very simply.  The strawberry version is very good with bananas.

I made two of these for a party, one using dark chocolate cream cheese and the other had cinnamon cream cheese. Both were amazing on fruits, cake bites, marshmallows, cookies, and -as a friend realized by accident- certain veggies!

Love this recipe as is, it truly is delicious!  The second time I made it I did get a little more creative.  I added quite a large splash of Cruzan Black Cherry Rum to it and a dash of grenadine for a pinkish color.  Next time I will give mango rum a shot!

This stuff if phenomenal.  My babysitter use to make it for me when I was little and I love making it for my nephews when they come over.  It's a great way to get them to eat more fruit!  I think it is wonderful as is, but I also enjoy switching up the cream cheese with a flavored cream cheese like strawberry or blueberry.  It just gives it something a little extra.

I have made this one for years the only thing different I do is add a couple drops of red food coloring. It makes it look pink and people can not think what it is that is so good and why it is pink.

I originally received this recipe from my mother in law.
She always serves it with apples. Tart apples work best.
It is an incredibly simple and yummy recipe.

The only reason I'm giving this recipe 3 stars is cause I modified it. If I rate MY version it would be five stars. I mix one package cream cheese with one jar marshmallow fluff. The I folded in a tub of whip cream and added about 4 tablespoons of orange juice. I made it for a baby and everyone loved it and asked me for the recipe !! I think next time I will add coconut flakes to it and it would be even better. This is a keeper !!!

Love this recipe! We had friends over yesterday for a cookout. I took advantage of the fresh fruit from the farmer's market and made this to go along with the fruit. I always have cream cheese on hand, but will add marshmallow cream to my staples. In addition, hubby doesn't care for marshmallow cream, but loves this!

At the risk of sending everyone running to their liquor cabinets, this dip is especially good with a tablespoon or two of the amaretto or orange liqueur of your choice. :-)

Always a hit! I add 1 tsp vanilla extract to give it that litte extra something. Don't forget to soften your cream cheese or your dip will be lumpy. My favorite fruit with this is strawberries and a variety of grapes.

Good recipe. However I made some modifications to make it perfect:

- Use fat free cream cheese
- Add 1 jar fat free cool whip
- Add 1/2 jar fat free sour cream
- 1 tbsp lemon juice

Great recipe with fresh strawberries.  I used whipped cream cheese and was able to mix it by hand with no problem.  Thank you for a quick and relatively healthy party dish!

My friend brought this to our home recently and it is the best dip for fruit that I have had.... proportions were a bit different - she used 8 oz cream cheese with a tall jar of marshmallow creme, 13 oz.  She also said to soften both in the microwave, then mix.  Delicious and very addictive.  Make sure you provide plenty of strawberries - they go FAST.

Very good. I used reg crm cheese, 2 tbs oj, 1 tub of cool whip instead of 1 cup.  With 1 cup of cool whip the cream cheese was a little overwhelming. The whole tub of cool whip evened out the flavor.  Will make again def!

This is fantastic.  I just wanted to add that I always forget this calls for marshmallow creme and since I never have this on hand I decided to see if I could do a substitution.  I used mini marshmallows with 1T light corn syrup and 1/2T butter melted in the microwave.  I also add a little strawberry extract.

I tried this at New Years.  Everyone loved it and the kids have been asking for it every since.  I added a little cool whip to make a lighter consistency that I was looking for.  It's an easy winner, I will be making this again and again.

This is soooo good. I made it for my 6 year olds birthday party and all the kids were asking for more fruit! I also added a splash of lemon juice it gave it a great flavor and balanced out the sweetness. I will make again

This got inhaled on my fruit platter at Easter, I was very pleased and impressed with the dip. Easy to tweak and customize but as written with just these two ingredients it is AMAZING. I'll sure be making this again, thanks so much for sharing.

I followed others advice and added the whipped cream and changed my cream cheese to strawberry flavored...as well as 2 T of OJ. It was sooo good! I could've just dug into it with a spoon instead of dipping fruit.

I made it just as directed and it was very good and so simple my 6 year old daughter pretty much made it herself.  My husband loved it! He was back to the fridge looking for leftovers before the night was over.  A sweet and easy valentine treat.  TIP: I spray my spoon with cooking spray to keep the mashmellow creme from sticking so bad.  I do the same thing for peanut butter.

I loved this dip. I made it yesterday for the superbowl and my husband and I just loved it!  I followed others' advice and added 1 1/2 T lemon juice and 1 cup cool whip.  Eating it with bananas, tasted like banana cream pie! Sooo Good!!  A couple people at the party said they though it was a little too sour, so I guess it just depends on your taste.  I also served it with strawberries, grapes, pineapple, and apple.  Delicious all the way around!!!

This is the BEST fruit dip EVER!!!!  I use strawberry cream cheese.  Absolutely hands down the best I have ever had.  Always goes fast and tastes so good you can eat it by itself!  Let the cream cheese sit until soft it will mix up nice and easy!  Thanks for posting Crystal!

Tried it tonight two different ways. One included strawberry cream cheese and the other plain. I also read other reviewers and included one cup of whip cream and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Both were a hit for tonights get together. Everyone loved them. Thanks for the recipe. In my opinion, the whipped cream made it smoother and less sticky from the marshmallow puff.

I added a spoonful of frozen orange juice, a bit of vanilla, a pinch of cinnamon and used equal amounts of marshmallow creme and cream cheese. Not a wow for me, but good enough that I would make it again.

Add 1/2 to 1 tsp. vanilla (when using plain cream cheese)and you've got a winner!  Using a hand mixer is a must to avoid the lumps.

My mother always makes this dip for fruit. It is so easy and delicious, just enough sweetness without being too much. Also a great topping for a fruit torte, sometimes I add food coloring to make it more festive.

I used to work in a bakery and we did a lot of fruit dips.  We used this recipe except instead of plain cream cheese we used flavored cream cheese -- usually strawberry but sometimes pineapple.  Makes a world of difference in the flavor.

I made this using light strawberry cream cheese.  I handed it to the kids after school, with a platter of grapes, orange segments, banana slices and apple wedges.  It was gone in minutes.  Next time I'll be sure to add a cup of cool whip so I can get a little more bang for my buck.

I was taking a fruit plate to a bridal shower and I needed a quick dip to go with it so I tried this. It is fabulous. I squeezed in a half a lime and it blended to a smoother consistency and had a mellow citrus flavor. This recipe is so good (and so easy!) I don't think I'll be trying another fruit dip for a long time.

i can't believe how good this is for how simple it is to prepare.  it honestly is good enough to eat plain, and is also delish over fruit.  the recipe makes quite a bit - half it if you're not serving with tons of fruit - or keep half for later

Oh Crystal . . . this is beyond amazing!  The first time I made it - everyone just loved it.  The second time - I used cheap marshmallow creme that comes in a plastic container and it was way too sweet and runny.  Just have to make sure you buy the creme in the jar.  It's the best!  Thanks Crystal!

This is probably my favorite fruit dip!
It tastes almost like cheesecake and is so good, I could probably eat it with a spoon and forget the fruit, but the fruit is what's healthy, so I eat it!
I love it on fresh mixed berries and summer melons! :)

This is delicious and so easy to prepare!  I made a fruit salad and then served the fruit dip in a halved pineapple.  I put the fruit in a cup and guests put a dollop of dip on the top.

I know this recipe is good on its own but I also tried the advice of another reviewer and used strawberry cream cheese, 1 cup of Cool Whip, and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  It was so heavenly with strawberries and I received rave reviews.  Thanks for the starting point (which is also a 5 star on its own with the addition of vanilla).

I have made this recipe for years and always get rave reviews.  I always add at least a teaspoon of pure vanilla.  Also try almond extract...depending on the fruit you will be dipping.  Enjoy!

The kids were licking the bowl clean! My husband asked me to make more the next day.  I used strawberry cream cheese as suggested in previous reviews.  It was delicious and made it a pretty pink color.  I plan to keep these ingredients on hand for unexpected guests/kids.

I make this with Marshmellow Fluff instead of cream (you do notice a difference)  I also add 2 tsp of orange juice or any other type of flavoring that you want.  My brother says this stuff tastes good on ice cubes!  I think he was just looking for a host for this heavenly dip!

This is a great basic recipe.
You can make this dip personal.
I used strawberry cream chees and about 3 tablespoons of cherry juice (from the bottle) and bits of cherries. marachino (sp?)

We loved this one.
We had a fondue party and served this. It was a hit.
Thank you for sharing.

This fruit dip went so well with strawberries and nectarines. I also added cool whip and pineapple juice to the dip to add a little extra something. It was great and simple!

One of the most delicious dips I've ever had!  I mixed in a little crushed pineapple and it was sensational!  I love it on strawberries and my 3 1/2 year old likes it on bananas.  Delicious!

I have been making this dip for years. Always a big hit at parties. Only difference is that I use 2 tubs of strawberry cream cheese and 1 large jar of marshmallow creme. Turns our perfect! Great to serve all year, especially when you have berries or grapes that are not in season...it adds the perfect sweetness to otherwise tart fruit.

I made this dip for a party recently.   I was running short on time so was looking for something quick and easy.  It's delicious and took less than 5 minutes to make.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla as others suggested.  I'll definitely make this again.

Served this dip with a platter of fruit for my fourth of july party and it was excellent. I bought a ton of fruit and it was all gone by the end of the night. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla for extra flavor. This will be a staple at all my parties. Great, fast, and easy recipe.

This recipe was a hit.  I had all my girlfriends over for wine, cheese and fruit and I decided to serve this dip to compliment the fruit.  They loved it!  It was gone by the end of the night.  I served it with strawberries, grapes and granny smith apples.  I suggest putting a strawberry on top of the dip for nice presentation.

Yummy.  I have had this before at several parties and it is always a hit.  It got rave reviews at my house as well.  I had to mix it up in my Ultimate Chopper because our electric mixer was "missing"...It came out great!

I utilized the changes suggested in the comments to use strawberry cream cheese, add 2 Tbsp. of orange juice, and I also folded in some whipped topping.  This is very good.  I have been searching for this recipe for a very long time.  So glad to have it!!!

I added a tsp of vanilla to the dip and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top. It was delicious both on fruit or as a filling for pumpkin spice cookies. A lot of flavor for having only 3 ingredients.

I use a little extract - orange, pineapple, coconut, cherry, vanilla, almond, or any flavor. gives it a little subtle taste for variety

Wonderful recipe, added much less sugar (about 1/2 cup) and used vanilla yogurt to soften it up a bit.

Have had this dip in my family for the LONGEST time. Brought it to school for a potluck I high school, and no one knew what it was or have ever taste it. Surprised to see so many others like/know this recipe. So simple, and amazing! :)

This stuff if crazy good. Probably if you are planning to make this, double the recipe if there is a gathering, because people will be eating it by the spoonful. If you want to clear a fruit tray, add a bowl of this and there will be no evidence of fruit minutes later. I'm telling you.

I made this for a party, and although I thought it was good, it didn't get many takers. I added 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and a splash of vanilla. Anyway, thanks for the recipe!

I also used strawberry cream cheese, cool whip and a little bit of orange juice, I also initialy forgot the marshmallow cream at first! OOPS.  With out it,its a gross dip! But after I added it, it was outstanding.  I probably wont add all of the marshmallow cream next time though. Yummy dessert type appetizer

Was awesome.  I used the orange juice and whipped cream as recommended.  I got rave reviews at the party I served it at.  Several ladies asked for the recipe.

Yum! So simple and so good. I can't believe the substitution of strawberry cream cheese. I like the original recipe best of all. It goes so well with all different kinds of fruit. I can't imagine strawberry cream cheese with fresh pineapple, melons, etc.

I used fat free cream cheese and fat free Cool Whip, along with 2 tbsp. lemon juice -- still had coworkers commenting on how good it was and asking for the recipe.

My family has been making this exact recipe for years and it is still a family favorite. You just can't go wrong. During a summer camp that I teach we get creative and add different things to it like peanut butter, chopped pecans, and mini chocolate chips. They have a great time with it!! We also use it for the "sauce" on fruit pizza!

This was good as written. I added cool whip as others suggested but actually thought that made it too light and sweet.

When I worked at a resturant, they would have catering jobs and serve this with the fruit platters, but would never give away "the secret recipe".  I was so happy when I found this and it was the same as their secret!!  This is always as a must have at get togethers.   Thanks for sharing!!

Delicious and so simple and quick to make!  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and a couple splashes of orange juice per another reviewer.  Will definitely make again!

Very basic fruit dip that tastes wonderful.  I do not own a mixer (yet) so I found it hard to mix so I placed the combined ingredients in the microwave for :15sec to loosen everything up.

Mmmm, mmmm G-O-O-D!!!!! This is sooooo yummy!!! I bought a container of grapes last week, and just haven't felt "motivated" to eat them yet. Not wanting to waste good food (who has disposable cash in this economy???), I decided to whip up a batch of this stuff thinking that I'd be more likely to eat fruit this way. I've made a version of this before (recipe from my Betty Crocker cookbook), but it's just a tad different. I always add a T of milk to mine. I had some "about to expire" OJ in the fridge, so I subbed it for milk and - WOW! The OJ lent an ever so subtle orange taste - the barely there, but you still notice something different kind of taste. Oh, and to use up another "soon to expire" item in my fridge, I added approximately 1 cup's worth of light (extra creamy) Cool-whip. These additions took this over the top, IMHO! And FYI for all you health conscious folks out there.... Feel free to use light cream cheese. I did and couldn't even tell (shhh...). :-) Thanks for sharing, Crystal! I think I'll go back to the grocery store to buy the $1 pint of strawberries on sale this week!!!

It was yummy, but really sweet. I took the advice of another reviewer and put in some juice from the cherry jar and I wish I hadn't because that made it even MORE sweet. It's yummy though.

I have made this for years.  For extra kick add 2-4 tablespoons (to taste) of orange liquer.  It makes it even better!  You could also use kirsch if you like that flavor.

My mom has been makign this recipe since I was a kid. It's so easy and so delicious. We usually serve this dip with strawberries, so my mom will add a couple of drops of red food coloring to make the dip pink. This is so easy! and so yummy!

This simple yet delicious recipe has been a family favorite for over 20 years.  I have found that if you feel the consistency is a little too thick you can add milk a table spoon at a time until you have it like you like it

This was so easy and tasted great.  My cousin wanted to just eat the dip from the tray with no fruit, that is how good this was.

This dip is super yummy and super easy.  After I mixed it, it was a little sticky so I added a splash of orange juice.  I wanted it a little sweeter so I added some powdered sugar too.  I served with tart apple slices, mandarin oranges and pineapple chunks.  It was a big hit on the Christmas buffet!

This was ok, but a little too sweet for me.  I'll add a little more cream cheese next time, maybe a little lemon juice.

A light, slightly sweet fruit dip that holds up well on a buffet.  Very fast & easy.  Keeps well in refrigeration.

This fruit dip is an A++ in my book!  It is so yummy, easy and everyone loves it.  I use strawberry cream cheese, marshmallow cream, 1/4 cup of whip cream and 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I serve it with green apple slices and strawberries.  Delicious!!!

This is a great dip, but add some juice (approx 1/4 cup or more if you like) from a jar of maraschino cherries and it is even better!  It gives it great flavor and everyone loves it!

I have to say that I found this very bland.  I had it with a platter of pineapple, strawberries and cantelope at my last party and it did not go well at all.  I even tried putting other flavors in to make it tastier.  I threw out the almost the entire batch after the party.  Very disappointing.

I made this for a work lunch, and it was a big hit. I also used strawberry cream cheese, but I didn't change anything else. (I always try a recipe as is first) I would not change anything, it's pretty much perfect as is. It's a little amazing that something so simple is so good. My co-workers were even dipping their spoons in to eat it without the fruit! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is SOOOO good!  I made it when our cousins showed up unexpectedly.  It disappeared!  I read a lot of the other reviews to add cool whip and a splash of lemon/orange juice, and so I did, but I didn't think the cool whip added anything spectacular to it.  It was good with or without.  I used strawberry cream cheese.  My cousin liked this so well that his wife ended up using it as frosting on his birthday angel food cake the next week!  I will come back to this recipe again and again, especially now that it's summertime!

This was yummy! I folded in the whipped cram like some of the other reviewers did, I also used reduced fat cream cheese, next time though, I'll try using a non-dairy whipped topping instead of the whipped cream to save on some fat and calories. Thanks for the recipe!

This is just the best of all the fruit dip.  It's light and sweet...doesn't kill the taste of the fruit.  However, sometimes, to make it more creamy, I will add 1 tsp of OJ or 1 tsp of vanilla.  It's really very good.  I've made this several times.

Very very yummy!  If you want a fluffier dip add more marshmallow creme.  You can add up to twice as much marshmallow creme and it will still not be too sweet.  As is, this recipe is still delicious!

It doesn't get much simpler than this recipe, but it will be the first thing at your party to run out.  We served it with fresh fruit for a Wedding Rehearsal dinner & we couldn't keep the container filled. YUM!

My family has made this for years, since one of us learned it in home ed in middle school.   I have become the fruit dip master by adding almond extract and cinnamon.   Nobody can figure out what my secret ingrediants are.    My mother-in-law loves this so much, that she will eat it on anything available, even summer sausage.

I've been using this recipe for years.  Sometimes I will add a teaspoon of vanilla or lemon flavoring as a variation. This dip is great with any fruit.

My family has been making this for as long as I can remember and it is still an all time favorite!  My mom will be bringing it to my son's 1st b-day party this weekend...  (If you are using apple wedges you may want to try dipping them in Orange Juice right after cutting the apples; they will take longer to turn brown.)

This was so good, even my kids liked it. I used about 1 cup of cool whip in the mix, and those that have had this same dip thought the cool whip made it creamier and said they like it better with it in there. Thanks for the recipe!!

I have made this for years. I got the recipe from a friend of mine. For a great dish, wash & DRAIN 2 or 3 pds. red & green grapes, MAKE SURE YOUR GRAPES ARE VERY WELL DRAINED !!!, make your dip, stir dip and grapes together. CHILL. Just before serving stir in some sunflower seeds. This dish always comes home empty.

This was really yummy! I didnt use marshmallow creme though, I used some homemade marshmallows that I needed to use up and it worked out well. I just melted them in the microwave then stirred in the cream cheese. This is great with pretty much any fruit I think. I had it with some apple slices, strawberries, grapes, and banana.

Simple, easy to make, and good.  Even if you are not typically a fruit eater, this dip will make you want to buy a bounty of fresh fruit and cut it up in pieces just so you can dip it into this scrumptious, creamy dip-of-love-and happiness ;0

This dip is amazing.  Every time I make it, it always goes sooo fast.  I just made it to bring into work tomorrow.  I let the cream cheese sit out for a bit to soften while I made dinner.  I took CAPEMOM77's suggestion of dipping a spoon in very hot water for the ease of getting the marshmallow creme out of the jar.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  By the time I was done with dinner, I was able to mix everything with a spoon.

Absolutely amazing!!!  I made for a fundraising party and it was a huge hit.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I did add a few drops of pure vanilla extract while mixing...so heavenly!  It was described as "tasting like a cloud" perfectly fluffy and sweet but not overpowering, a huge compliment to the strawberries.

I used some suggestions from this site and added a little vanilla and sugar.  Next time I think I'll use a little less cream cheese as  the flavor was pretty strong, but it was all eaten and I was asked for the recipe!

Delicious and easy!  I used lite cream cheese and marshmallow fluff and you couldn't tell.  I also added a splash of vanilla.

I've been using this recipe for years (got it from a friend originally) and it's the easiest crowd pleaser ever!! As long and the cream cheese is room temp., you can mix by hand rather than using a blender.

My Mom's been making this dip for years and I've always loved it. Just served it at my own party and everyone raved about it, the bowl was practically licked clean at the end of the night! Plus, you can't beat how simple this is to make!

This recipe was a great base, but I thought needed more flavor.  I added a spoonful of orange marmalade and a little lemon juice and it was perfect! :)

I made some adjustments because I've had this same dip for years, and although I like it, it just needed something.  I added about 1/4 cup orange juice and about 2-3 teaspoons of homemade maronberry jam.  It was amazing! It was a little more runny than the original, next time I think I will add yogurt to thicken it up a bit.

This was great!  I made it for a baby shower yesterday and it went over very well.  I added the vanilla as someone suggested.  I think I may try the strawberry creamcheese next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

I thought this was very good. I added a bit of powdered sugar and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla for a little extra flavor. It was a little bit heavy, so I couldn't eat a lot of it, but my husband was loving it. He normally doesn't eat fruit, but he did with this as a topping! I'd definitely make it again. We served it with strawberries and bananas - both were great.

Wow, wow, wow, wow!  I cannot believe how fantastic this was...and easy!  It was smooth, creamy, sweet, and had that cream cheese taste that is to die for.  I served it with fresh strawberries.  My kids were licking their fingers after trying it and begging for more.  I can think of lots of uses for this.  Thank you so much.  I never would have thought to mix marshmallow creme and cream cheese.

Excellent! This can be used for so many desserts; sometimes I add a little creamy cool whip to the mix, how much is contingent on the taste and the consistency I want, since I use it for so many different things.

This was good.  I added some vanilla and served it with strawberries, apples, fresh pineapple, and cinnamon graham cracker sticks.  All were great with the dip.  I also added some red food coloring which I didn't like because it gave it an artificial appearance (duh).

Absulutely wonderful and easy. Make sure the cream cheese is warmed in the microwave to make the mixing easier. I took some advice from the reviews and added a bit of confectioner sugar and vanilla to taste a bit like cheesecake. It can, however, go as is. I'll try it again with other flavors and colors.

This is a hit every time!  If you want to mix it up a bit it is great with a bit of ground cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg and allspice (to taste - I like quite a bit).

This stuff is delicious.  I used it to make fruit pizza.  Make a graham cracker crust with cracker crumbs, butter and sugar.  Spread on a big serving platter.  Refrigerate awhile to make it firm so you can spread the dip on.  Then arrange fruit on top in a decorative way.  I used halved strawberries, chunks of canteloupe, grapes, raspberries, blueberries, pineapple chunks, kiwi slices--really you can use any fruit you like.  Use red and blue for the 4th of July.  Really yummy.

How can you miss with this one?  Very easy and so good with fresh fruit!  The kids especially loved this one.  My youngest, who doesn't like many fruits, spread it on graham crackers!  Thanks.

This recipe is always a favorite at my parties and it is so simple to make.  I serve it with cantaloupe, strawberries and granny smith apples.  To prevent apples from browning, coat with lemon juice.

This is extremely easy.  I made it for our Fourth of July party and it was gone before the night was over.  Everyone loved it and so did I.  This one is a keeper.

Excellent, but I add between 1 Tablespoon - 2 Tablespoons of cherry juice for a nice hint of flavor and splice of color.

I've made this before, and remember it being very good. I made this to bring along to my family for mother's day today, but decided I'd be a bit daring and threw something extra in. I put in a capful (about 3/4 teaspoon) of almond extract. I served it with a variety of fruits - strawberries, grapes, pineapple, watermelon, kiwi and cherries. They loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!

*******Update, 08/01/04. I brought this to work for a potluck - what a hit! One co-worker said he was done eating because he was so full. After I convinced him to try some off of my plate, he went got a serving for himself! This time (in addition to the almond extract) I added 1 drop of red food coloring and it made it a nice shade of pink. I wish I could give this ANOTHER 5 stars!

Great and easy!  I used strawberry cream cheese instead of regular and made a note to myself for the next time I make it - no cantalope - haha!  It was great with bananas and pineapple, though, and I look forward to trying it with strawberries in the Summer!

Was a huge hit for Thanksgiving. We had Fuji, Opel, and Honey crisps apples,  red and green grapes, kiwi, and strawberries with it. The dip was so good with all of them. Will be making this again for my next fruit tray.

Excellent recipe. I wanted a sweet strawberry flavor, so I put a cup of strawberries in the blender, added 2 cups of sugar to the puree and boiled it to get rid of any graininess from the sugar. Then I added it to the cream cheese as I blended. This was a huge hit. The marshmallow creme adds just the right fluffiness and helps it stick to the fruit. Everyone wanted the recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Wow, what a hit and so easy!  I'm not a big marshmallow fluff fan but this was great.  I used whipped cream cheese because I often have issues getting regular cream cheese smooth enough, and it turned out perfectly.

After mixing the cream cheese and marshmallow creme together, I add 1 cup of cool whip.  We serve with various types of berries and bite size cubes of pound cake.  MY KIDS CAN'T KEEP AWAY FROM THIS STUFF!

Someone told me to add whip cream and orange juice.   So I followed those instructions. Turned out fabulous. I was also told to add yogurt but I didn’t want that bland taste. I wanted tasty not healthy. So yea try that. Good luck!

This is great.  I like the option of adding cool whip especially since it adds to the amount of dip the recipe will make.  I made it as a strawberry dip only and sprinkled strawberry jello crystals in to add more flavor and give it the red color.  Served with Nilla Wafers

This gets apples into my fella. He loves this. I like playing with this basic recipe and other fruits and flavors. I love that this is a quick and easy way to provide a sweet snack for my husband, one that he will ask for, and help himself to. His Oreo addiction has competition.

I took DWilson0116's recommendation to add about a cup of coolwhip to the mixture (like my grandma did) and it was a total hit at the family bbq.  I served with apples, grapes, pineapple and strawberries.  Some of the boys even dipped their cookies into it.  Definitely going in the favorites folder.

It is so easy and a big hit.  Everyone absolutely loved it, and couldn't believe it was so simple.  I added a little lemon juice as suggested in other posts.

I made two batches of this dessert.  One I added 1 box of strawberry/banana jello to the recipe....the second batch I added pistachio pudding to the recipe.  Both turned out good but the strawberry/banana was a little better....

I made this recipe for my daughter's birthday party to go with some fruit platters. The only change I made was to add a little bit of pink lemonade concentrate to make it pink and add a bit more flavor. Very easy and yummy!

Very easy, and very good! I made it following the top commented suggestion of using strawberry cream cheese. I actually do NOT recommend this. I liked the taste of regular cream cheese better. I also used low fat to help cut those calories! The extra 2 TBS of OJ made it a little watery, so I would recommend just 1 TBS of OJ. Great, easy recipe!

This never fails to satisfy with just about any kind of fruit. I add food coloring to make it more appetizing-usually pink, but have done every color. Highly recommend!

This fruit dip is delicious. It was also a huge hit at a wedding shower I recently went to... And I have to admit that there were times when I made this dip just to eat it with a spoon for dessert.

So I have to say, I did not expect the response that I got from everyone at my Memorial Day party.  This was a huge hit.  Every adult and child there kept going back for more.  The dip and all the fruit was gone and I doubled the recipe.  I have been asked an additional two times for two gatherings to bring this to the parties.  I do agree, add two tablespoons of orange juice.  Gives this a nice flavor and I use strawberry cream cheese.  So good. Love making this.

Simple, easy to make and goes quickly. I usually add just a touch of fresh squeezed orange juice (clementines when I have them) to give it a little something in the background. Every time there is a potluck at work I am specifically told to "bring that AMAZING fruit stuff you make!" Thanks so much for an easy and popular crowd pleaser!

I first made this dip in the 1990's for a PTA gathering when my children were in elementary school. Everyone loved it and it goes with a variety of foods. Don't know about the additions, we loved it the way it is. Some people even used it as a spread on pound cake, although I find it a bit sweet for that.

This isn't fluffy or creamy, in my opinion.  More tacky and gooey. Not my taste.  Was looking for something lighter in texture, I guess.  I stirred in cocoa powder per one reviewers suggestion.  chocolate flavor was nice, but the texture wasn't what I was hoping for.

I loved this dip! I could only find marshmallow fluff in a 16oz jar, and I used approx half of it with 8oz of fat free cream cheese. It was delicious! I made this for my boyfriend and I to have with fruit after dinner, and served it with halved strawberries, kiwi chunks, and thickly sliced banana. Definitely a hit and I will absolutely make this again! (Now I get to eat fluffernutters for a while to finish up this marshmallow fluff -- yum!)

I followed the recommendations of others and used strawberry cream cheese and added 1 cup of cool whip. Since I was cutting up fruit, I squeezed some fresh orange juice in as well... YUMMY!! Loved it!!

Pretty tasty, but not so amazing that it outweighs the unhealthiness.  Probably a good way to get kids to eat more fruit though.

I have a recipe similar to this. With the cream cheese and marshmallow cream, you add one can of sweetened condensed milk and 8oz of sour cream. It is SO GOOD!!! Fattening but GOOD!!

This is a yummy dip, but even more so with one addition:  mix in 1 tablespoon of frozen orange juice concentrate.  Try that and, as one reviewer said, you'll have no leftovers!

I have made this for years now and everyone loves it. The only thing I have always added to it was a bit of LEMON juice. We love it with strawberries, red grapes and apples (make sure you use fruit fresh or like to keep the apples from browning) and cut the apples just before serving to keep from getting soggy.

So easy and quick! I am usually not a fan of marshmallow cream, but you can't even pick it out in this recipe! The marshmallow cream blends in perfectly with the cream cheese to make a soft, sweet well rounded dip!

This is one of my favorite dips ever! I have found that it is best to let this sit in the fridge for a few hours to let the sweetness of the marshmallow come out. It is also good on graham crackers.

This stuff is AMAZING. I made it the night before a party and most of it was gone that evening. I had to make another batch for the actual party. By looking at the ingredients I wasn't really sure about this but then I looked thru the reviews and was convinced I needed to make it. I am so glad I did. This stuff is soooooo good!

Love this dip!  I add just a little bit of orange juice to it when making it (have also had it with pineapple juice).  Have never measured it - maybe 1 tbs...?  Delish!

I have been making this dip for a while.  I usually use whipped cream cheese or else I add a tablespoon of milk to the cream cheese so it is a bit fluffier.  It is very yummy and easy, and everyone seems to love it.  As a side note, I have also used this as a base on fruit pizza and it is delicious.

This dip was fantastically easy and delicious. The texture was wonderful, as if clung to the fruit without being too sticky. We tried the dip with strawberries, pineapple, kiwi, mandarin oranges, and bananas. While the dip was a perfect complement to all, we thought the sweet cream cheese taste with fresh pineapple was out of this world. Thanks for providing a fantastic party appetizer and a great way to get my husband and daughter to eat a variety of fruit.

I feel this is way too dense and sweet as written.   I thought it would be fluffy, but it really isn't.  I think this can probably be remedied by folding in some Cool Whip (as others have done).

Delicious.  Did not last very long at my baby shower.  Would be very easy to alter to your own specific taste by adding concentrated juices for flavoring.

I love this Fruit Dip, just a few changes. I used strawberry cream cheese and a few teaspoons of orange juice.  It was a little to sweet for me but still delicious, the kids love it.

I've been making this same fruit dip for at least 10 years. My kids love it and so does everyone else. The only difference is that I thin the dip with a bit of pineapple juice.

It was easy to make and got many compliments.  I've used both strawberry cream cheese and regular.  The pink definately looks prettier.  I also added orange juice.

My husbands grandmother has been making this for him since he was a little kid, and it is now my favorite way to eat fruit too!. I like it with strawberries the best, but green apples are great too.  Add a little cinnamon to it if you are using it with apples. Make sure the cream cheese is room temp, and if is a little too thick for your taste, add a half tub of cool whip to lighten it a little. Eating this dip is like home to me - RIP Grandma Margaret.

I have used this recipes for years!  It is awesome!  It is even better with a few drops of orange or raspberry extract added to it.  The orange is my favorite, but the raspberry makes it look so pretty.  The best fruit dip ever!

I made this for my sisters baby shower and it was a huge hit! Everyone kept asking for the recipe. I folded in a cup of whipped cream like others suggested as well as a bit of orange juice! Came out great!

Pretty good!  I added 1 container of strawberry cheesecake yogurt, and also some vanilla.  I think it would have been good without the yogurt, too.  My guests ran out of strawberries to dip, so they started getting "creative", dipping everything from canteloupe to jicama and cucumber.  I finally put it away when they got to the broccoli!  DH kept saying he could just eat it with a spoon, lol.

I only like to cook naturally (no chemicals and bad oils) and with little sugar but if you have to serve a fruit dip with already delicious and sweet fruit, this one is a crowd pleaser. No need to add the chemicals from whipped topping, but a little vanilla adds a lot of flavor, as suggested in other reviews.

Of course fruit doesn’t really need any dip to be enjoyed, but this is really good!!! Try it at your next party. It is prepared in a flash, and adds something special to a traditional fruit plate.

I think this stuff is so good, but whenever I make it people barely touch it... I don't get it...? Maybe instead of putting it out as an appetizer I should use it for a light dessert instead? I think it's so yummy as written, but last time I sprinkled in some cinnamon and I think it was better that way. Might also be good mixed into an ambrosia type salad.

I added the 1 c. of Cool Whip as well as a splash of Tropicana Orange/Strawberry/Banana juice (I didn't have any plain OJ)and it turned out really well. My guests thought that it was just really good whipped cream! I served it with pineapple, strawberries and watermelon. Yummy!

I thought this dip was only okay, but several people at the baby shower raved about it.  I think I would prefer it if I didn't follow the advice of using strawberry cream cheese; I thought it made it taste fake and sickeningly sweet.  I think I'll try it again, but with plain cream cheese.  But hey, four stars for making me look good at the party.  : )  UPDATE:  I tried this again with plain cream cheese (still with a splash of OJ), and it is FANTASTIC.  It's SO much better than with the strawberry!  Thanks for the recipe!

What can I say? This is so YUMMY!! My husband (who can barely make a bowl of cereal) actually made it so it didn’t turn out as smooth as I would have liked but it was sweet of him to help me out since I was already making a ton of other things, I didn’t want to insult him by going back and mixing it more. The taste is something like cheesecake. And two ingredients? Can you get any easier???

I really did like this dip. I altered it as suggested and used cool whip and Orange juice and strawberry cream cheese. But i think i like my dip a little more yougurty and not as fluffy as this one.

Great!  After reading the other reviews, I also added a small container of cool whip.  I used strawberry cream cheese and added the 2 tbs orange juice.  Served w/strawberries, apple slices, and sliced pound cake.  It was delicious and had my mom asking for the recipe!

This was a crowd pleaser.  I like the cream cheese flavor, but others (who don't like cream cheese) said they couldn't tell it was in there.  I served with strawberries, pineapple, peaches and apples.  I will be making this again.

Amazing! I have been using this recipe for a few years now, and there are NEVER leftovers! Everyone at home and work loves this stuff! I serve it with kiwi, apples (gala or jonathan are amazing), pineapple (fresh is the best!), strawberries and bits of pound cake.  Everyone loves it!

This was great! I made both the recipe as written above, then one substituting strawberry cream cheese and adding a bit of cool whip and orange juice. Both were raved about all night. Thanks!!

I really had high hopes for this recipe. The texture was wonderful! BUT... this did not do it for me or the company I had over for dinner....I will stick to my own classic... Sorry but the only reason that I gave this three stars is because a couple of kids ate it, none of the adults :-(. Guess not our style...Sorry again...I am glad to see that lots of others like it; I don't feel as bad now. Thank you anyway :-)

yum!  made this recipe as directed and it was good.  but then added 1 cup of cool whip and that made it REALLY good.  how could it not be when more sweet stuff is added?  i used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and light cool whip.  perfect!  i am looking forward to trying the strawberry cream cheese.  thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious and so easy to make! I didn't think it would taste so good with just the two ingredients but it was similar to cheesecake.  I added a splash of vanilla but it was great without it.  I made it for the 4th of July and served with strawberries and angel food cake for dipping and sprinkled blueberries on top.  thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic! Tried this for a nice light dessert. I put strawberries, pineapple and cantalope in a bowl and topped it with a couple of spoonfulls of the fruit dip.  My boys ate 2 bowls of fruit! Very pleased, thank you for recipe!

This is THE BEST fruit dip ever!  SERIOUSLY...and it's so easy!  I don't know why anyone would ever make any other fruit dip than this one!  You can eat this one by the fingerful - who says you actually NEED fruit!?

This dip is amazing!  I followed the recipe and it turned out wonderful.  Our kids loved it too.  Tastes great on almost anything, apples, grapes, blueberries and even your finger.  I found myself dipping in my fingers and sucking it off.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

This recipe is included at all family events. We vary it with different fruit flavored cream cheeses. I'm not sure who enjoys it more, the kids or the adults.

Made this for my daughters graduation open house and was well received by all who tried it!  Much better than the dip you get with a fruit tray from the deli!  Will certainly be making this again when the need arises!  THANKS!!

Great dip for strawberries, bananas, peach slices, and pears.  We added a little green food coloring and the kids' loved it as alien dip.  the marishino juice was a hit as well.  Good with just the cream cheese and marshmallow cream as well.  I make it everytime new fruit comes into the house, always available for the kids!

This is an easy and very good fruit dip! I slightly changed it by adding 2 tbsp. of lemon juice. It gave it a slight punch that compliments all fruits.

This is an excellent dip.  It’s so easy and fast.  My family and friends all loved it.  I can’t wait for strawberry season to be here because this dip is really good with strawberries we also had it with pineapple, grapes and cantaloupe.  A great bring along dish.

This dip is fantastic! Unlike storebought dip that leaves an aftertaste, this is HEAVENLY! I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. In the future, I plan on adding different spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice. Thank you Crystal!!!

My family goes nuts for this stuff! It is super easy, yet very good. Be sure to soften the cream cheese to room temperature before mixing the two together. If not this mixture may be lumpy. It goes well with tart apples.

This is delicious! I added a few drops of red food coloring to make it pink. Looked pretty in the center of my fruit tray.

Tastes great but presentation is lacking.  Perhaps I did something wrong.  I just did not get the fluffy and moist fruit dip I expected.  It tastes like cheesecake and would be great spread on a breakfast bread or muffins.

I have been making this recipe for years and thought I would see if anyone had submitted it yet.  It is incredibly easy and no one can figure out what is in it.  Favorite guesses include yogurt and sour cream.  No one will believe.  I highly recommend giving it a try!

This was gone very quickly at our July 4th celebration. It was a nice option for something sweet for all the toddlers in our family. As a matter of fact they all loved it so much I think some of the adults didn't get to even taste it!!

I made this for my daughter's eighth birthday party and served with a variety of fruits.  Every speck of everything -- fruit and dip-- were gone in no time!  A hit with the parents AND the kids.

Was an absolute hit with my family!  I added a little bit of vanilla and a bit of sugar and it gave the dip a little something it needed.  I will definitely make this time and time again@
