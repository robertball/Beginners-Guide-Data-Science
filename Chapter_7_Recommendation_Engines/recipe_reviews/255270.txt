So quick and easy yet so flavorful. I used medium salsa and for those that like more heat I set out a bottle of hot sauce to drizzle over this with extra chopped cilantro and diced onions on the side. Although I made this as directed no doubt some frozen grilled and ready roasted chicken breasts would make this even faster. I will definitely make this again.

SUPER super quick and simple with some leftover shredded chicken I had on hand. Made it for the girlfriend who kept asking for tortilla soup. We will definitely be making this again.

Simple easy tasty. Roughly 1 quart stock with 1 teaspoon cumin and you can go a lot of ways from there. I added onion and garlic then peeled and parboiled sweet potatoes corn tomatoes and celery to add instead of a salsa. Grilled chicken slices grilled steak slices avocado sour cream shredded cheese hot sauces and tortilla strips on the side.

This recipe is a brilliant recipe and bright enough to cheer up an autumn or cold winter night. Added a lot of and extra fresh tomato juice, perhaps Spanish style.  Fresh chiles and cheese filled dry pocket tortillas (or tacos) and sour cream top off this good family meal.  Hope you give the recipe' here a try also.  Ariel O'Suilleabhain
