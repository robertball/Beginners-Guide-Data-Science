I used homemade salsa, regular shredded sharp cheddar cheese (I don't buy reduced fat cheese) and I omitted butter because I was using a non-stick skillet. This was a great quick lunch that used up a couple tortillas I had to use or lose. I'd make this again but next time I think I would double the amount of cheese and beans only because I would have liked a little more to balance out the salsa amount.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I made 3 servings, because I didn't see the point of chopping and mixing all of the ingredients and heating up the oven, for 1 serving! I followed the recipe exactly even making a guacamole and chopping up the red peppers, except using Trader Joes homemade style white tortillas. The problem I had, was when I flipped them the beans wanted to fall out and when I went to eat one the toppings wanted to do the same thing. I used a homemade restaurant style salsa. I can only assume it was too thin for this. I think a thick jarred or chunky style salsa is meant for this recipe possibly. Although, it would increase the lower fat content, more cheese would definitely hold these together and make them less saucy too.

I can't say I thought this was great. I wasn't really bad either. probably a little healthier than some. I love quesadillas, salsa, cilantro and guac but my idea of a quesadilla is crunchy. this is kinda sloppy and soggy. I probably won't make it again. thanks for sharing though

Delicious, simple, enjoyed every bite. Saut√©ed frozen onion pepper blend in olive oil to add to filling. Used my own mix of Taco Seasoning and Mexican 4 cheese blend. Brushed olive oil on one side of tortilla, that would be on pancake pan; put filling on one half of tortilla and folded tortilla over filling. Place oil side down on pan (two fit in pan) browned and turned over to brown other side. Served with Chobani plain Greek Yogurt in place of sour cream.

I used more cheese and refresh mashed beans instead of whole beans. They quesadillas were delicious! ??
