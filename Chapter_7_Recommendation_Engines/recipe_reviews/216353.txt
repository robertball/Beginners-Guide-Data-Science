Outstanding. I highly recommend. Even picky eaters agreed. Very delicious though I did swap out the raisins for craisons. Thank you tworootless.

Very good!  I threw in 4 Tbsp of capers and used golden raisins instead of regular raisins.

This was an excellent meatloaf. My husband is a nut for meatloaf - it's his favorite comfort food. He loved it. I used a spicy curry powder and extra oregano/rosemary.

This was the best meatloaf I have ever had! I made a few minor changes, based on what I had available, but wow! I used all lean 100% grass fed beef, Worcestershire sauce instead of hot sauce (because, kids ... & I just love Worcestershire), used a clove of fresh garlic and shallots instead of onion (needed to get used), added one more egg, and red bell pepper (no green on hand).

We loved this! Meatloaf is always a hit with my family, and this is a nice change from the regular stuff. The curry adds interesting flavor, and the raisins are a great compliment to it. I made a few modifications:
- I used half turkey and half beef, just because it's what I had on hand.
- I used Worcestershire sauce instead of hot sauce because I love Worcestershire, and kids + hot sauce = no.
- I added extra ketchup and Worcestershire because I felt it needed more moisture (maybe an extra tablespoon or so of each). I also added a second egg.
- I used steel cut oats instead of rolled because that's what I had. It turned out perfect! The steel cut oats added nice nuttiness and texture. Because of my schedule, I needed to let the prepped meatloaf sit in the fridge for a few hours before cooking - maybe that allowed the steel cut oats extra time to absorb moisture?
- I used celery instead of green pepper because that's what I had.
- I added a few tablespoons of capers per suggestion of another reviewer - loved the saltiness with the raisins.
- I felt the recipe needed more salt. When I make this again, I'll add a teaspoon or so of salt and about a quarter or half teaspoon of pepper.
