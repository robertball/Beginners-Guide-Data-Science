This is the easiest pie crust dough I have ever made or used.  Unlike some of the reviewers, I did not find this sticky at all, it rolled out easily and did not tear readily.  I used it for a pecan pie, and the only thing I did do differently was brush the floor of the pie crust with some egg white to make sure the bottom of the crust didn't become soupy after baking.  The crust was flaky and cut well.  I did use more than a "pinch" of salt (I used approx 1/8 teaspoon for a single crust).  This recipe is easy to reduce to 1 crust worth of dough.  Next time I plan on adding a little vanilla and 2-3 teaspoons of sugar for a fruit pie.  I absolutely love this recipe; it is now my "go to" pie crust recipe!  Addendum:  I think people may not be mixing this long enough and that's why it seems dry.  I cream my butter and cr. cheese and then mix in the flour and salt with my hand mixer and literally beat it for 3-4 mins - it will eventually turn from looking like bread crumbs to doughy in appearance.  It's at this point that you should stop and make a ball of dough.  It's not the least bit sticky and it's possible to roll it out immediately and not use wax paper - it rolls easily.  Don't let the reviews scare you away from this recipe - it's easy and is not sticky if you mix it long enough (and it's still flaky when I bake it).  Good luck!

If you're having trouble rolling your dough on flour, place your mixture between two sheets of wax paper and roll. Take off one side of the wax paper and place the rolled dough in your pie pan.

This makes a lovely flaky crust and the amount is perfect for 8 inch pie crusts, but if you do 9 inch crusts you are going to have to divide the dough differently.

For the people who are having issues roling out the pie crust - I've tried this sort of recipe before and it was a pat in the pan type of pie crust.  Don't try to roll it out, just put it in the pie pan and pat it out using your fingertips.

I really don't like giving bad reviews, but I followed this recipe to the letter, and this dough was very sticky and I found it impossible to roll it out. No matter how much flour I used, it stuck to the counter and to my rolling pin. I tried adding a little more flour, to the dough, but that only made it tear easily. I tried chilling it, and it got crumbly. I was disappointed. Perhaps others will have better luck than I did, but I won't be trying this again.

This crust was so yummy, and flaky.  I used it for an egg pie I found on this site.  I only needed one crust, so I lessened the ingredients to 2oz cream cheese, 1/2 c butter and 1 1/2c flour.  It was very dry and not holding together well, so I added a little milk.  I took the advice of another reviewer and didn't try to roll the dough out, instead I just pressed it into the pan. It turned out perfect! My ten year old actually ate the crust before the filling!

I loved this recipe!!! It worked out very well for me... Personally, I am not a fan of the traditional pie crust.. this one has such a better taste to it!  If you are wondering how the taste may differ my boyfriend said it tastes more like the outside of a pop tart :-) Good luck

Far from perfect.  As other reviewers said, needs much more salt.  Also, this just completely falls apart and is impossible to roll out, even with your roller and board well floured!  Yes, you can press it into your pie plate BUT that does NOT WORK WELL when you need to put the top piece of your pie on.  I hope it tastes better than it was to make.  Never again.  There are too many easy ones to make with pretty much the same ingredients and that is what I will make from now on.

I used this for the French Silk Chocolate Pie from this site. So yummy!!! I was actually able to ROLL this crust with NO problems! I quartered the recipe, because I have always had horrible luck with pie crusts, and I still have to lose 1/4 a cup of flour. This was fantastic, and I'll be using this recipe from now on!! Finally, a pie crust I can do :D

I made this crust with a little hesitation but to my delight , it is now going to be my all time pie crust. It gives you 5 or 6 crusts.
I added a little more salt, because I used unsalted butter, a full teaspoon, a little vanilla and a teaspoon of sugar. The reader that suggested to keep mixing had the right idea. I creamed the butter and cream cheese and added  the dry ingredients one cup at a time. It was thick but not sticky. So easy to roll and didn't tear or stick. I LOVE it!! It tastes very yummy with the apples!!!

This recipe is AMAZING. Sure it's a little hard to mix the flour in, but great taste, texture, and it bakes nice and flaky. Not sticky at all.

I had great success with this recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter except I started by adding just 5 cups of flour and found that I need no more than that. Crust turned out flaky and I had no issues with rolling it out with just a little flour on my board and pin. I did pull half of the dough out so that I could half of the dough savory and half sweet with some extra added sugar. Will being making this again and keeping some on hand at all times. Update: October 24, 2014 Made this again; this time just was written. 6 cups of flour and all. Again, I found this dough to be just wonderful. Don't know why anyone would trouble with it. If you know how to bake I think you will appreciate this recipe.

Pie crust turned out fine - dough was not too sticky like some said.  However, it tasted just like a Pillsbury frozen pie crust which is what I was trying to avoid.  It has a discreet sour taste to me that I don't like.  Everyone else thought it was good!

This was wonderful! I hate to roll, so after reading the reviews, I gave it a try. Patting into the pan was perfect! Someone said 'pop-tart' consistency, but I don't think it was as hard. Great!

We live at high altitude so I added 1T vinegar and an egg after everything was mixed and it did not look like it could be rolled out. Made it many times and it is delicious and well received. Don't know if the altitude makes a difference or not, or perhaps the quality of the butter (some isn't so high in fat.)

I struggle to make decent crusts, but my worst ones have tasted better than this hard to work with expenditure :/

I don’t normally review. But this pie crust was the worst I have ever made and I have been making them for decades. It fell apart. Split. Too soft. Added more flour.  Refrigerated. Nothing worked.  Even between wax paper stuck.

I make a gluten free version of this pie crust for my wife - the cream cheese is a life saver!!!! Gluten free cooking is a horrific, terrible, utterly disastrous experience. Doughs are always chalky and way too sticky and usually taste like crumbly cardboard. However, if you make this recipe using 1;1 gluten free flour, add in 1 tablespoon of starch for every three cups of flour, teaspoon each of xanthum gum and baking powder (the usual gluten free baking junk) and add in two eggs for every three cups of flour, magic happens. The dough begins to feel like sugar cookie dough - lots of smiles. I don't refrigerate it or anything, I just kneed it like pizza dough. I lightly cover the rolling pin with starch and roll the dough on parchment/wax paper. Without trying to pick it up, I flip the paper over a pie pan, the dough falls into the pan, and I close up an cracks and tares, and bake like a normal pie. Its divine.

This is, by far, the easiest and most delicious pie crust I have ever made. It was easy to roll and form. It was also light and flaky. Thanks for sharing!

I screwed up and left this chilling overnight and it turned rock hard. However I thought on it and read over the reviews and I took some half and half and some powdered sugar to be able to roll it out. Used wax paper because it was a little sticky it tastes fabulous and works well with the pumpkin, cherry and pecan pies I am making for thanksgiving always make one for now and freeze the ones to take to thanksgiving
