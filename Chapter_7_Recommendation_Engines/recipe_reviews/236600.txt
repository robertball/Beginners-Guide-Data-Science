This is perfect, tastes like a bread dough.  I make three or four heads of cauliflower at a time in the food processor and freeze the raw ground cauliflower. So all I have to do is pull it out of the freezer, cook it in the microwave, cool it and then squeeze it out.  Saves so much time and this is a nice sturdy crust that can hold lots of toppings and doesn't even taste like cauliflower, can you believe that?  The key is to squeeze it dry, really squeeze it out good otherwise it is soft when baked.

I just made this and halved the recipe, with the exception of the egg, obviously...I was worried when I put it onto the baking sheet because it was quite loose, but it firmed up very well in the oven. With about 10 minutes left in the oven, I flipped it and browned the other side. Topped it with sauce and cheese and threw it back in until the cheese was bubbling and brown. My sauce was very mild, so to add more "pizza" flavour, I will add some oregano and garlic to the mix next time, but all in all, this is a phenomenal way to cure a pizza craving while on a  low carb diet! Great recipe!

Loved this recipe. I was worried I hadn't squeezed it enough but I guess what I had in me was enough!  The first couple bites I wasn't too sure about then I fell in love with it. I watched Chef John's video which was helpful.  I tipped mine with different cheeses and sweet peppers and onions. Yum!  This will be a go to crust forever!
Warning:  if you are looking for a quick crust, this is not it. It takes time to do this so plan on starting 2 hours before you want to eat. You have to wait for it to cool and cooking time is an hour.

Being a low-carber I loved this recipe!One of the tricks I've found with it though, is to flip it, after 40 minutes cooking, and let it cook another 10 minutes. Makes it firmer. Then let it cool for 10 minutes before you add your toppings, cook at 450 for 10 minutes and then on broil till the cheese is how you like it. Lovely recipe. Thank you chef. : )

I did this recipe the other day and it came out fantastic. My husband and friends raved! I added some Italian seasoning mix to the crust, used turkey pepperoni, fresh mushrooms and red peppers. Used some mozza mix on top. Yummy! I also flipped the crust and baked another ten minutes before putting on the toppings. I don't own a food processor, so I cooked my cauliflower florets first, drained then mashed with a potato masher. Squeezed out the excess water, then mixed the spices and egg in. Formed it into a circle 1/4 inch thick. nice to have pizza on a low carb diet.

I really liked this recipe! I didn't change anything about it. It was easy enough to make. The only thing I'd say is that it took awhile from start to finish for the pizza. But my 4 year old daughter liked it so that should tell you something! Will definitely try this again.

I didn't want to use goat cheese so I used a blend of cheese I had in the fridge of grand padano and marble cheese. I put garlic and oregano in the crust and in the tomato sauce on top. I topped it with a fried mushroom, onion and zucchini mix. Then orange pepper and cheese. I baked it for 10 min and put fresh chopped tomatoes when it was out of the oven. You never would know it was not made with flour!

Surprisingly tasty, being that I was a little "scared" to try it.  Between the workout you get from squeezing the water out and this not using flour, I believe we have a weight loss winner! I could only find garlic herb flavored goat cheese but  I feel that it might have worked better because of all the flavor.  I opted to bake on a Pampered Chef stone & it turned out wonderful. I did however need to take it out at 30 minutes.  Nice pizza cheat.

While I have not made this particular recipe I've made cauliflower crust pizza's for awhile now, adding egg, cheese, spices but from my experience I've found the best crust is not made on parchment but rather right on the pizza pan.  It doesn't stick and it's 'drier' and crispier which we like.  Cauliflower is hard to wring out every drop of water.  Great for low carb living.

Read somewhere to add 1/4c coconut flour to help absorb excess moisture. Awesome!! I also double/triple the batch and bake the crusts, 20 minutes each side (flip with another pan and piece of parchment paper on the top). Then I cut the crusts in 1/2 so they fit in a ziplock freezer bag. Thaw, top, and bake and works GREAT!!  The crust also works for "bread" for grilled cheese, and French dips. LOVE this recipe!!!! Adjust seasonings for use (Italian, Mexican, etc)

We’ve made this about 5 times now.  Messed it up the first time cooking too long, we shortened it about 10 minutes.  It does take a LONG time, but it is a family afternoon project.  We are all trying to loose weight, so this is our cheat for the weekend.  All the water HAS to be squeezed out, the reviewer that said theirs was soggy didn’t squeeze out all the water.  You need strong hands to do this, so my son and husband do this portion.  
Also, We don’t use goat cheese, but all parmesan.  Make sure you check it after 30 minutes because in our oven it is done.
Love the garlic - olive oil mixture brushed on prior to putting on toppings.  Does this taste like real pizza, No, but it sure satisfies those cravings and you don’t get that heavy gluten gut after you eat a normal pizza.

OH MY GOSH!! This recipe is wonderful! I did not have any goat cheese, so I just used all Parmesan. Baked 40 min, then turned over and added my pepperoni, red pepper, olives and mozzarella cheese, and baked til cheese was melty-about 5 min. I practically ate it all myself in one sitting!! I will absolutely make this again and again because I have a carb. intolerance. Thank you chef John!!

I wish I had doubled the recipe!  I did not have goat cheese, so instead, I used Daiya (mozzarella style) cheese--gluten free, soy free, & dairy free--both in the crust, AND for the cheese topping.  I topped my pizza with a regular tomato-based pizza sauce, halved cherry tomatoes, green pepper, sliced fresh mushrooms, and diced red onion.  I didn't know if this would go over well with my husband or not considering it was a "replacement recipe" for something he loves (AND I didn't tell him I wasn't using "real" cheese).  He loved it.  I loved it.  I will be making this again, but next time, I will double the recipe so there will be left-overs.

I'm impressed!  Very tasty. Also very time-consuming, but I will make it again.  The crust stayed together very well.  Wow, squeezing out the water was interesting. The dish towel was immediately wet.  It wasn't until the 3rd towel that I realized I could keep the cauliflower in one towel, hold it over the sink, and twist to get out the water. (I initially thought a dish towel would absorb the water...but there is a LOT to wring out.) It all turned out great, though!
Update next day:  Leftovers are great..crust still holds together.  I love this recipe!
Another update:  For those who want to avoid or limit cheese, you can.  I made it with just the cauliflower, an egg, and some oregano.  Still yummy and this way I saved calories by just sprinkling cheese on the toppings.

My 1/2 Sicilian husband has been fighting issues with wheat for several years now, and as a result we have had to give up his comfort foods.  We tried this recipe the other night, and we both loved it!  I think the crust could be put in a casserole dish, baked and used as a side dish it was so good.  One word of advice is to be gentle with the cauliflower crust when it is warm.  I was debating whether to take it off the parchment paper to cool, and took it off which was fine.  But afterward I changed my mind and went to put it back on the parchment, and managed to rip it.  It was my fault for manhandling it.

Wonderful recipe!  I added Italian Seasoning to the crust as well as my sauce, so that the pizza flavor came all the wat through.  I wasn't bothered by the texture at all and thought it had a great authentic taste.  It did take me close to an hour to prepare the crust, but I will get better with practice.  I also appreciate knowing that the crust can be frozen and used later.  Thanks for a wonderful treat!

I followed the directions to a T and was really happy with the crust. My husband said "the only thing I'd have you change next time is I'd have you make more." This is a keeper! Thank you!

I loved this!  I finished it with some homemade pizza sauce(just a little) fresh basil, spinach, cherry tomatoes, and Feta cheese.  Popped in under the broiler to warm the toppings.  I served it with a glass of red wine. Yum!

Chef John Rocks! This is a Atkins dream recipe. Followed to the 'T', and even when I've been short on ingredients, this crust is wonderful.

This is excellent.  I used a different method, one that I found on another website that allows one to skip the squeeze-drying of the cauliflower.   The crust ends up being a bit softer but it is still very much like pizza.  The other method requires microwaving the cauliflower for ten minutes after processing it and then using more eggs (4).  Nevertheless, Chef John's method makes a slightly better crust.  If you like cold pizza (the next day), you probably won't notice any difference.

I made this recipe and it came out really tasty.  I probably could have wrung out even more water but it browned nicely for my first try.  I was a little nervous about flipping it over so I just used a second piece of parchment on top at flipping time. So that when I flipped it it went right onto parchment for the final baking with toppings. I will definitely make this again!!

I added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning to the crust recipe.  I didn't have goat cheese so I used 1/3 c cream cheese and about a tablespoon of parmesan. My mistake was I put it directly on a greased a non-stick baking pan. It stuck in places.   Next time I will use the parchment paper!! Still, the flavor was delicious.  I was snowed in with a bare cupboard, so I topped it with Parks Finest Signature Seasoned beef frankfurters, chopped asparagus, kalamata olives and mozzarella cheese. Next time I will cook the frankfurters a little first because they made puddles of fatty juice on top of the pizza.  We ate it so fast we didn't give it enough time to cool properly!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this last night, for just me, so I halved the recipe.  I used feta in place of goat cheese, bc that's what I had on hand.  I also added minced garlic and Italian seasoning to the egg mix.  I baked the crust for about 20 mins, flipped it over, baked for another 10 mins, topped with caramelized onions and bell peppers, cherry tomatoes (halved),sliced pepperoncini, mozzarella and a light sprinkle of shredded parmesan, then baked for about 6-7 mins or just until cheese is melted.  It was wonderful.  Using half of the head of cauli, it made a small, personal size pizza, a little more then one serving.  Thanks for sharing Chef John.  I'm amazed.  I had no idea I could do anything like this with Cauli.....who would have thought?? : )

This is SO GOOD!!!  Perfect for a low carb pizza. The flavor was great, and I added a few Italian herbs into the crust.

I had no issues... I did add 1 tsp of Italian seasoning, and a little garlic. The parchment paper IS necessary. ;) My husband and kids all liked it, and we are from NY, so we are picky about pizza. It's not a stretchy, gluten laden crust, but if you're watching carbs, it's a good substitute!

i did not make this recipe as stated, but did not want to give it low stars.  i don't have a food processor so i but the florets in a blender, added water, and used the "grate" function.  i then dumped it in a colander but the cauliflower was so fine it was difficult to drain.  i skipped the step f squeezing out the water to see what would happen if i did not.  It basically crumbled and did not hold its shape in the oven.  it was still edible, and quite tasty, but did not form a crust.  also, i used feta cheese instead of goat cheese.  tasted great.  next time i'll either use a juicer as someone had suggested or squeeze out the water.  thanks!

This recipe is delicious. I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used chili powder. I did not miss the traditional pizza crust one bit. I definitely recommend this for a pizza craving. I topped mine with chicken, peppers and onion. I'm definitely going to be making this again.

I was a little unsure about how this would turn out.  I figured that I would like it to some degree, because I like to eat healthy.  I was quite impressed.  The cheese keeps it very tasty, and it performed great as a pizza crust.  I am going to try it next as bread of a sandwich.  Nice job on this creation!!

Really tasty alternative to traditional crust! HINT: if you have a ricer, using it to get the moisture out of the cauliflower is SO much easier. Same goes for any spinach recipe (thaw spinach, drain it through the ricer) - no more gross towels or millions of paper towels used!

this came out really good.. i used it for Buffalo Style Chicken Pizza from this site.. my only complaint is the cook time but that's also partially my fault.. the crust had been baking about 17 minutes when i started smelling something overcooked.. i blame the fact that i was cooking on the lowest rack in the oven, not the middle as instructed.. but it wasn't burnt thank God.. i didn't use the parchment paper b/c i have a silicon mat and unfortunately it stuck a little.. but it wasn't ruined.. this still tasted like cauliflower/brocoflower to me (i used a combo of both).. but since i love cauliflower/brocoflower i didn't mind.. i can't eat goat cheese (lactose intolerant/sensitive) so i left it out and replaced it with some shredded mozz.. i'd love to try making this again.. ty for the recipe

This was a great recipe. I wanted to do it vegan so I substituted ground flax seed and water for the egg and vegan mozzarella for the cheese. Held together great and tasted wonderful!

My mom really liked it. I have made gluten free pizza crusts for her with less than stellar results (too hard to chew, doughy, etc.) but she really liked this and even with all the grinding (i used an omega 360 masticating juicer instead of a food processor) and squeezing it's still easier than kneading and finding a warm place to put a pizza pan of dough to rise that the cats can't get to (yes, I know that was convoluted grammar). I used some shredded cheese I had on hand, but that's the only thing I changed.

Awesome! Will try it again, Some people are saying that the crust sticks to the pan - you are supposed  to use parchment paper on the pan. Mine did not stick at all.

This was the best of the cauliflower crusts I have tried. Make sure you put it on the parchment paper or as the others that I tried stuck to the pan and made a mess.

So yummy! I used cream cheese instead of goat because I didn’t have it and instead of salt and cayenne I used and Italian spicy blend. Tasted amazing and it was surprisingly durable (the crust). I will definitely be making this again. I doubled the recipe and made three pizza crusts so I could freeze them for later since it is so time consuming to squeeze the cauliflower.

Very good recipe and will make it again. I used it for a crust for quiche.  The first taste was odd because it wasn't the taste that usually accompanies a quiche, but once we got used to the cauliflower taste, it was really good.

I made this as directed and it was enough for 2 medium-sized crusts. I topped the pizzas with pesto, a little cheese, and some veggies, and they were great. It's very important to drain the moisture with a tea towel. I couldn't believe how much water I could squeeze out. I will make this recipe again.

We ate slices right away but had to use a fork because of the consistency. The next day leftovers, even when reheated, were much more the consistency of normal pizza so I suggest letting it set before chowing down. This was a nice recipe to get some variety in the kitchen.

This was my first ever experience with a cauliflower crust and it was amazing!  Tastes like a normal pizza!  I added some Italian Seasoning, subbed more parm for the goat cheese, and added some red pepper flakes.  YUMMMMMY!

I ran my cauliflower through the juicer, which eliminated all the moisture. I then mixed the bulk fiber of the cauliflower with my spices, egg, and parmesan cheese and it was perfect! Precooking the cauliflower is not needed!

I used a juicer and "juiced" the cauliflower.  tossed the liquid, took the pulp and squeezed as much liquid remaining as I could.  Mixed with 1/4 C vegan cheese, garlic, spices and on pizza pan, molded into crust.  425* for about 20 minutes. Topped with vegan, sugar-free sauce, vegan cheese and preferred toppings. Cooked another 20-30 minutes till the cheese was melted.  the crust did come apart a bit but cooking it a second time (the next day) made the edges appear burnt.  They weren't but this time the crust held together just like traditional crusts.

Surprisingly delicious!  I didnt add the goat cheese just to save some calories and i didnt miss it.  I thought it tasted amazing.  It does take some time so I'm thinking I need to make some and freeze them.

Yummy & super healthy with my simple homemade sauce (no added sugar-recipe below). My variations: I used a whole medium head of cauliflower and riced in food processor by pulsing with regular blade. This filled two 1 1/2 quart Pyrex bowls, each of which I microwaved 5 min covered with plastic wrap  (open a little to vent). Strained through fabric dinner napkins to squeeze out water. Mixed with 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup dried parsley flakes, 2 eggs,  2 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper. Baked  approx. 40 minutes, flipping halfway to turn both sides golden brown. My sauce: heat 1/2 TB olive oil over low heat in small pan. Add 1/2 TB garlic and 1/2 tsp dry oregano, cook about 1 minute. Add one 14.5 oz can undrained diced tomatoes with no added sugar (I use Contadina organic), small can tomato paste, 1/4-1/2 tsp crushed red pepper, 1/4 tsp salt and fresh ground pepper. Bring to boil over medium heat. Turn down and simmer 10 min.)

I've made this several times now, and I love it.  I leave out the goat cheese since I'm not a fan, and put in some mixed Italian cheese instead.  Note to christina:  It says to user parchment paper on the baking sheet when you initially bake the "dough".  I've doubled this recipe and found that 1 egg is sufficient.  If you are looking for a way to cut back on carbs, this is a great idea.  I make pizza out of any leftovers I have.  Everyone loves pizza.

The flavor was great!  I only used Parmesan cheese because that's what I had on hand, and the crust was nice and crispy. I actually prefer this crust over regular pizza crust.

So very awesome. Key is squeezing the water out.  I did not use goat cheese rather use shredded mozzarella. I also spread more shredded mozzarella after I pulled the crust out of the oven. And after the marinara.

I loved it, although my crust split in places.  Did add season's, and a little pizza sauce to dough, Low carb, no sugar.  Added Italian sausage, green and red peppers, pepperoni, and onion.

This was my first time making cauliflower pizza crust and I was really surprised at how tasty it ended up being. I used TJ's cauliflower rice (not the frozen kind) and threw it in the food processor to make it a little finer. I squeezed out as much water as I could (I'm sure I could've gotten more out) but the crust ended up being really firm and held really well. I forgot the parmesan but did throw in a little quattro formaggio into the crust along with italian seasoning - I'm sure it would've been a lot better w/ the parmesan. I set the oven for 40 minutes - after 25 minutes, flipped it over, baked another 10 minutes, then put on the toppings for another 10. It turned out great - my boyfriend who was skeptical ended up loving it. It is quite a bit of work for one small pizza so I would recommend making a lot at a time. One bag of cauliflower rice only made one pizza (I got 2 pieces, gave my boyfriend 4) and I was still hungry after!

I didn't have goat cheese so I put in extra parmesan (shredded not grated). Texture was great. I turned the pan 180 half way thru; crust baked and held together nicely. I added other seasonings like garlic, oregano and rosemary.  I'll make this again.

It was hard to pick a rating for this, since I made so many changes.  I had a veggie tray left over from a party that I wanted to use up, so I made the crust with half cauliflower and half broccoli.  To my own surprise, it worked!  I also didn't have goat cheese on hand, so I used thick Greek yogurt and mozzarella instead.  I also added some black pepper and more cayenne than suggested, since I enjoy a nice kick.  In any case, I was surprised how well it turned out.  And it was quite tasty.  Even the baby ate it happily.

I read that if one runs the raw cauliflower through a juicer and just uses the pulp then the crust is more 'crustier'. Haven't tried that but the original recipe is magnificent ~ thanks

This is very good but a lot of work. I tried using zucchini and it was good too and easier. I just grated it, squeezed very dry, add parmesan, egg, seasonings and spread on pan and baked 15 minutes at 425. Then I added topping and baked 15 more minutes.

Don't give this recipe a bad review for not following directions because it stuck to the pan, because it clearly states to bake on parchment paper.  Don't just make a recipe without following directions and then give it a bad review because you can't read and follow directions.

subtle goat cheese flavor and my kids didn't mind the "crust" at all. We topped this crust with a simplepizza sauce and cheese. We made the crust just as the recipe stated.

I'm not impressed. The cauliflower flavor was very strong which could be fixed with more cheese. But the texture after cooking was moist. The outer layer dried and browned, but deep inside was wet. I've made better cauliflower crusts.

Trying to do the low carb diet and my boyfriend wanted pizza....so I made this crust which HE LOVED!!!!   I gave it only 4 stars because it's a major process to make it and that's before you put the pizza toppings on and bake it for the second time.  I'm going to experiment and see if it will freeze after baking and turn out just as good, so then you could make a bunch of crusts ahead of time and just pull one out of the freezer when needed.  I myself liked it better than a dough  crust!

I steam the cauliflower, mash it like potatoes,...add garlic salt, egg, ...to dry it up I add potato flakes (instant potato) about a 1/2 cup , ....about a 1/2 cup or more of what ever cheese I have on hand,...usually cheddar or mozzarela,.. .....spead it over a baking sheet lined with parchment paper,...I lay a couple of 3/8 wood dowels and use a glass quart bottle to roll it out evenly and bake @ 325* for 20-25 mins, then I lay a sheet of waxpaper over it and lay an oven grate on it and flip the crust  and slip it back onto the parchment to make the slightly soggy bottom bake and dry up,...smear pizza sauce all over it,......brown turkey sausage with onions and mushrooms ...top with sliced black olives, ..slivers of.bell pepper,....diced tomato,.....and more cheese,.....slide it back in to melt the cheese,...... .a bit unorthodox but,....wurkx fer me !!!

Delicious! I used 3 cups of crushed cauliflower = 1 head of cauliflower. I added diced garlic, crushed red peppers, basil, parsley, crushed black pepper, and pink Himalayan salt. My children enjoyed the pizza and didn’t realize it was cauliflower.

First of all, I respect Chef John.  

Excellent flavor!  I microwaved the rice to make the pulping process easier.  You have to have a press or be a bodybuilder to really extract the excess water.  Wring out in small batches.  Much easier.  

The crust turned out beautiful after pre-baking on both sides.  Just for fun, I left it on the 12-inch metal pan, tightly wrapped it in plastic then foil and froze it for two weeks to see how it held up.  It did very well! 

HOWEVER, even after baking on a pizza grid, there still was a lot of moisture in the crust and was just too soggy for me.  I want to hold a slice in my hand.  Remember, the grid has to be placed on the oven rack - not on a pan or stone.  Heat and air need to get to the bottom. 

So, I'll repeat the recipe but this time, I'm dehydrating the pulp at 225°F until it gets drier - but not dry.

I processed enough cauliflower for two crusts and the second one will get the addition of 1 Tbsp each Arrowroot starch, tapioca flour, and almond flour.

I'll update when I do these.  The flavor is the best so far.

Add a huge amount of cheese to anything and it tastes delicious! You really have to be on top of this as it burns quickly. I don't know if cooking it low and slow would help. It was a little floppy in the center and probably could have gone a little longer in the oven. After adding the toppings it makes it even more wet, so make sure that crust is solid! Otherwise, I really enjoyed it. Would want to try different kinds of cheeses in the crust mix to add different flavors.

Meh.  It was ok.   I didn't have goat cheese, so I used feta instead.  I also added italian seasoning and a parmesan to the crust.  I used frozen cauliflower, steamed it, and used cheesecloth.  It was easy to make, but I could do without having to squeeze it.  On taste, I could tell that it was cauliflower crust and it just didn't do it for me.  Next time I will add either xanthan gum or coconut flower to absorb the moisture instead of having to squeeze so much.  Also, I think I will use the goat cheese, or better yet, mozzarella.  Hopefully it will come out a little better.  In the meantime, this recipe is fine, I'll use it again, I just wish it were better.

Really good. And very easy. I used frozen riced cauliflower. I didn't cook it I just let it thaw and then sqeezed out the water. My husband loved it. I missed the chewy texture of thr regular crust. But, this is a great substitute.

This was so interesting to see how much water is in cauliflower.   
Yes, I made it and my pizza came out delicious.
Hot out of oven is best of course.  
Second time I made it, I thought the dough needed a little boost, so I added about 1/4 cup almond flour.
Thank you, Chef John for a touch of normalcy on the keto food plan.

I changed a couple things on this recipe. I cooked the cauliflower for 10 minutes in mushroom broth, and I added about a 1/2 cup of mozzerella  cheese as well. Turned out great!

This pizza is absolutely phenomenal!  It browned beautifully and doesn’t taste like cauliflower. I added pizza spice to the other ingredients. I could have squeezed more water out but didn’t want to use another towel (!). Next time I will, it will be crispier. Thanks, Chef John for another winner recipe!

The crust is very tasty.  You will need a lot of time to make this recipe, since there are so many steps involved and the crust has to bake by itself for 40 minutes before Cooling, topping, and baking again for about 10 minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly and it is wonderful. My husband and I actually like it better than bread crust. Cauliflower crust pizza is one of our favorite meals. It is kind of a pain to make, but it's so worth the effort.

Since I'm rating the pizza crust, I give it a 5.  I agree with Chef that it has to be almost crumbly after squeezing the water out.  I wish I'd taken a pic of it ....but will next time.  I used my pizza stone with a layer of parchment between this and the stone.  I just didn't know if this dough would stick to the stone.
As Chef suggested, I prepared my husband for less than perfect expectations, but as it happens it wasn't necessary.  The crust was thin & crispy, which allowed the ingredients to shine.  Now, I give ME 3 stars because I over salted the dough a little and then put pepperonis and black olives on top! I will absolutely make this again and adjust according to this first foray into cauliflower pizza dough, which my husband insists didn't taste like cauliflower.   I agree!

I have another cauliflower pizza crust recipe that I prefer.  This one holds the shape much better but the other one tastes better.  Taste wins for me.  The other recipe has more parmesan cheese in the crust.

I didn’t have goat cheese, plus a don’t like.   I used 2 oz of Parma I the crust instead.  I used a small 5 serving bag of cauliflower and this size made a personal/plate sized za.  Super good I’d make it again Plan on 1 to 2 hours from start to finish.

Wring out as much liquid from the cauliflower as possible. Still needs  a little be of spice for the taste. It's close but will make some adjustments next time.

Nice and crisp - good flatbread for a number of things.   Made pumpkin pizza on it and it was great.   Needs a bit more salt to help the flavor pop.

I would make this again. I added a little gouda cheese to the crust. It was difficult to squeeze moisture out of the cauliflower. I made a mess. The dough was loose  and hard to form but it turned out well after cooking. I put olive oil on a baking sheet then baked crust on it.

Easy to make.  I dislike cauliflower and thought the crust, even with bbq sauce, onions, pepper jack cheese, and banana peppers, still made the pizza taste like cauliflower.  I am glad I tried it, though!

What have I  been waiting for?why didn't I make this sooner?! 
This pizza is super awesome! 
I don't normally watch the videos, but glad I did on  this one; flipping the crust & letting it set on the rack were great ideas. 
Prepping us that it's not like a normal pizza made it even better!! 
Loved how light but satisfying  tjis was. 
It handled my heavy toppings well! 
No need to look further, make this one!!

I LOVE this recipe! I've made it several times and last night I was craving pizza but I'm trying to avoid carbs so this little recipe is a delight! I decided to use riced cauliflower AND rice broccoli. I follow the recipe with double the goat cheese and add a little shaved parm to the mix and salt/pepper/garlic.  Once I have the balls (2) on the SILICONE baking mat (someone said there's stuck to the pan, I recommend owning these SILICONE mats), then I flatten them out carefully and even create a bit of an edge and a flatter inside for future toppings.  I bake for 45 min until nice and golden brown. Oh this time I sprinkled oregono/italian seasoning on the crusts before baking. DELISH!  After it's done and brown on the bottom and top, I put them on a wire rack of sorts (I  had a pizza wire pan) and let them completely cool. Then added toppings like grilled mushrooms, zucchini, peppers, kale and freshly grilled wild salmon.  SOOoooo good!   This recipe is a little work but worth every bit of it!  Be sure to squeeze the liquid out of cauliflower like it says.  :)

Use parchment paper to avoid it sticking to pan.

I have made the crust twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe and just use one cauliflower,  and it was amazing.  So of course the second time I wanted more so I used three and it didn't turn out the same.  I don't think I got all of the liquid out and it tastes a little spongy, aside from not making so much, does anyone have any ideas on making it turn out more crispy?  I cooked it for a few hours on a lower temp so it wouldn't burn.  Thanks!

I don't like cauliflower but thought I would try this anyway. I didn't have any goat cheese, so I used shredded  Italian blend instead. I was disappointed that it stuck to the pan, so I will spray it next time.  But, it tasted good. I put mushrooms and peppers on it.

We've made it twice, and it's a hit! My boyfriend is on the keto diet, and we're pizza-holics, so this was a great substitute! The cauliflower taste is a great addition to pizza. We doubled it the first time to make a large pizza. We quadrupled it the second time to make 2 large pizzas.

I highly recommend watching the video as well (google it if you don't see it - Chef John's cauliflower crust pizza). It includes how to proceed after making the crust, and it makes sure to tell you to use parchment paper. Also, we use paper towels in lieu of a thin cloth napkin/dish towel, and they work fine.

We loved this recipe - what a surprise!  I substituted low fat cream cheese for goat cheese and mozzarella for the Parmigiano-Reggiano.  I couldn't believe how much water was squeezed out of the cauliflower.  Definitely plan to fix again.

This was really delicious but it took so long to make.  I cooked the cauliflower in the microwave so I wouldn't have excess water to remove.  Seriously, it still took me an eternity to remove the liquid.  The results were yummy though!

I did not make any changes to the recipe, as this was my first time making it and I did not chose to change anything. 
It was delicious and I definitely will be making it again! 
One additional thing I did do was, after the crust was formed on the parchment paper, I used paper towels and pressed them onto the crust to remove any additional liquid.

I made Chef John's recipe as is and it was fantastic!  I can't wait to make another one.  Just be patient and make sure you follow the instructions and use parchment paper  when spreading and cooking the crust, then flip it over before you add the toppings.  If you watch the video it helps since the recipe seems to omit those important steps!

Thank you, Chef John!  I thought I was going to have to say good bye to pizza forever.  I have been trying several different recipes but they were all awful until this one.  It's definitely a keeper.

I couldn't find the parmigiana - Reggiano cheese so I substituted with Parmesan and Asiago cheeses.  I topped it with pepperoni, Leonardo's Asiago pizza sauce, and mozzarella cheese.

My crust came out very very thing but that's ok.  Next time I'll just try making the pizza round smaller.  I took it out 20 minutes ago and I've already had three pieces.

Ok! It's a nice dish. Great flavor, and we all enjoyed it...but I didn't get anywhere near a "crust." For the past 6 years I have been reading different cauliflower crusts each swearing "it's as good as a crust." And they NEVER ARE.  So NEW RULE, NO MORE  Saying "It's just like a crust" unless it crunches when you bite it! Next time I will ring with cheese cloth twice and add another 2-3 tablespoons of parm cheese.

I made this and it came out really good.  I used cauliflower that was already riced in a package.  I sauteed it for about 10 minutes in a frying pan.  In a bowl, I mixed the egg, goat cheese and a large handful of fresh chopped parsley, added oregano and pepper.  Added the cauliflower and then the parmesan cheese.  I prepared a pizza pan (one that has little holes so air goes through )with a little rice bran oil and sprinkled corn meal for a light dusting.  Baked about 30 minutes.  Added sauce and sauteed zucchini, mushrooms and red pepper then topped with cheddar/mozzarella.  Back in the oven until melted.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it just doesn't take the place of the dough in a really good pizza.

I left the crust in for 6 minutes longer than the recipe said and it turned out darker like the picture. It was surprisingly easy to flip after it had cooled a bit. The written directions were vague from the video and I would not have known to turn the heat up to 450 degrees with the toppings by the directions only. I agree the Goat Cheese was not a favorite and somewhat too salty, but it seemed to bind the crust together well. Will make it again with a few small adjustments.

I made this recipe except I used 1 bag of frozen riced cauliflower instead of fresh cauliflower that I bought from Whole Foods. I also substituted low fat whipped cream cheese for the goat cheese since that's what I had on hand. Next time  I would probably use two bags of the frozen cauliflower, because 1 bag makes a personal sized pizza (4 small slices).  It came out great, tasted amazing and its was quick to make it! Will definitely be making it again!

I used pre packaged riced cauliflower and it worked great and much less prep time.  It was good and flavorful but probably would only make if I was making it for someone who was watching their carbs.

This pizza crust was so delicious! I will be making this crust again. I did not add the Parmigiano reggiana cheese, instead I used a cheese blend. I topped pizza with  tomato paste sauce, turkey pepperoni, mushrooms, green bell peppers, onions, and cheese blend.

I added 1/4c flavored bread crumbs and 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese. It made for a dryer crust without any califlower taste.  It was a big hit.

Just made the crust and froze, next time need to squeeze more
water out with cloth napkin.  Baked for 30 and flipped for last
10, maybe cut back a little on the salt.

I made this last night and it was excellent.  I followed the directions exactly and the crust came out perfect.  The hardest part was squeezing all the water out which is a must!  I suggest watching  the video as it clarifies the recipe.  I only needed to bake the crust on parchment paper for 30 minutes as ovens do vary.  I topped it with pizza sauce, fresh MR and cheese. Delicious and will make this again!

Fantastic. My family and I love this. Beautiful,  easy and delicious. I used a T of crumbled feta and half cup of Parmesan in a double recipe. This is the second time I've made it and we love it.

I'm giving this three stars only because it isn't easy to make and it can be very temperamental. 

My wife loved it, and I would say it was delicious. I plan to alter some of the steps because the fussy part is being sure you get all the water out of the cauliflower before trying to mold it into a batter. 

For me, I have issues with spicy things so I won't add the cayenne pepper this next time, really no need. Italian spices would serve much better; just to take the edge off of the cauliflower taste. 

This is a good recipe but not so easy for a novice.

I have to tell you folks I was most skeptical when making this. There is no one in the world that dislikes CF as much as me. I thought there would be no way in heck that I would eat this. Boy was I surprised. Now after saying that I will say this. Its not your Pizza from the local eatery, but its heathlier and less calories and afterall I am trying to lose weight and learn to eat things that are better for this cause,  Just never thought this crust would be one of them. I went exactly by the recipe except the goat cheese. I used low fat mozzerala  and I made my own low carb sauce. I read all the reviews and I was determined I was not going to screw this up. I squeezed until I was exhausted to be sure all water was out.  Instead of making one large pizza I made about 5 in rounds and cooked them on parchment paper for 20 min and then used one of those wide metal dough cutter things to slide under and flip it  and cooked 10 min more. Turned out all toasty, not crispy, but firm enough to hold together. Then topped it with my ingredients and cooked in oven again for 10 min. Ive been sitting here eating it while writing this. Its all gone. Ok folks give it a try . If I can get CF past these lips then you can too. Thanks

This crust was very good, and had the flavor and texture of a flatbread crust. However, the crust was overcooked and a third of it completely burned after only 30 min. Additionally, the crust stuck to the pan pretty badly despite oiling it.This pizza crust has good potential, the recipe instructions just didn't work for me.

Fantastic recipe for those seeking a low-carb alternative to a carb-laden pizza crust! Even if you aren't keeping track of your carb intake, this recipe is a winner. Just ask my hubby - he's been a life-long hater of all things cauliflower. No matter what I did to get him to enjoy it, he was always very "meh" about it.  But not with this pizza crust - he loved and is still singing its praises!

This was sooooo good. I don't like so didn't have goat cheese, and used shredded cheddar instead.  I also didn't really measure my ingredients. Honestly, I think I like this better than "normal" bread crust. If you like cauliflower even a little bit, i highly recommend this recipe.

I was truly shocked at how delicious this was.  Followed the recipe to a tee and it came out beautifully.  I recommend watching the video before making.  This is now a regular rotation meal in our house!

My husband and I just started a low-carb diet and while most of the substitutions are great, we were really not looking forward to losing Friday night pizzas. I made this crust for the first time this week and it was terrific! I smooshed the mixture into a rectangle to fit the silicon baking sheet that I used, but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. Yes, it takes some time and it was a bit messy to prepare, but this is a new favorite.

Made this a few times now.  It tastes really great!.  My tip is to cook the crust till its very very done.  Will be more like a pizza crust if slightly over cooked.  You need to dry this out as much as possible or the crust doesn't set up correctly.

Made mostly as directed but added a little Italian seasoning and parm to the dough.  I baked as directed on parchment and a cast iron pizza pan.  Turned out great.  As others mentioned, I turned it over about 15 min into baking and baked the other side.  My husband was dubious but pleased once he sunk he teeth in.   A great, guilt-free pizza.

Oh my goodness! I'm so surprised! So I didn't have goat cheese and didn't have meat, so I made it without and put "Priano Rosso pesto" on it with mozzarella and onions. (Sorry Chef John, I used shredded cheese!) 
I didn't tell my boys, ages 13 and 14, nor my husband that it was cauliflower. My husband and 13 year old HATE it.  They all said it tasted like Domino's Pizza! Could have been the Rosso Pesto? Make sure to use parchment paper!  I baked it less time because I thought the one Chef John made on the video was over done and looked like it would be tough. It could have been baked longer, but my half hour including the cheese and onion baking after the crust baking was still yummy. I don't think it could be tough. I've see another recipe where the person steamed it and didn't tell to squish the water out. Some said it was a mushy mess. Make sure you get most if not all of it out. MAKE THIS, you will be surprised!

This was amazing. There were three of us for dinner and everyone was informed of the test pizza. I made a back up potato and leak soup just  in case the pizza bombed. No one thought it was going to tast good even myself. Mine looked just like the one in the video. I used a silicone mat instead of parchment paper. It worked fine. That was the only thing I did different. I'm going to make two crusts tomorrow and freeze them.  Hubby said I must make this for his folks. He was wowed by the crust. Very good recipe.

The flavor wasn't bad, but it is SO much work, and the end result was 'meh'.  It got entirely stuck to the stoneware, and was crispy on the edges, but still too moist to get firm or be able to pick up - it wouldn't even slide onto the drying rack.  I wouldn't try this one again.

Just amazing! This only had a hint of cauliflower taste to it, was crispy and thin, and held up well in hand. And when in  doubt, process more cauliflower than you think you'll need. I wanted to do a whole cookie sheet, but the amount  I made yielded a regular sized pizza. And making the "cauliflour" wasn't  hard, just tedious and I'd rather skip that part by making larger batches to freeze for future use.

It turns out if you follow the directions exactly. The reason why most people's crust turn soggy and falls apart is not squeezing all the excess water out after cooking it. I was really putting some muscle into getting out every last drop of water. Walah! Delicious!! Be prepared, this is very time consuming. Allow at least 1.5 hours start to finish.

This will do to satisfy the need for pizza.  I've missed it.  The goat cheese taste was a little strong, so I may try a different cheese next time.

Great recipe! I always make my own pizza crust, and I wanted to try something different. This was definitely different...lol. But it turned out wonderful. Even my husband who hates cauliflower really liked it. Only thing I changed, was after my 1st batch ( I made 3 ) I omitted the water when cooking it on the stove. Why add water when you're just going to squeeze it out in the next step.  Definitely a keeper :)

Made this crust as directed. At end of baking time I topped it with some pesto, 3 crushed cloves of garlic, 2 sliced roma tomatoes, sliced mushrooms, herbed goat cheese and then baked it another ten minutes. In the meantime, I carmelized a thinly sliced onion and then wilted fresh arugula. When pizza was done I topped it with the onions and arugula. Delicious!

I've made this at least 5 times - I love it! It is really  easy, super delicious and I don't feel guilty eating half the pizza because it's all vegetables. 

My only issue is that I have a hard time getting it to firm. I always find myself eating it with a fork. Any tips on how to make it less crumbly/more firm? I've tried it with more water, I've tried it with less water - no luck!

Tasted great, will definitely make again but it took way longer than 1 hr to make it.  
Crust needs to made well ahead time.  Now that I know for next time, I won't be serving dinner so late!

Even the kids loved it!  They didn't know it wasn't bread crust!    A little marinara, some pepperoni, and some cheese (cheddar & mozzarella), and this was awesome!

lots of work... I used my juicer to extract the moisture and didn't cook the cauliflower.  I'd say it was pretty close to perfect.

This was yummy! I used parm and pecorino cheeses because that's what I had on hand. I didn't squeeze enough water out of the cauliflower so my crust fell apart somewhat. Will definitely make it again.

I tried this with high hopes because I love pizza, but hate the carbs. Ingredients are quite expensive and even with a food processor, the prep was very time consuming. I love cauliflower, but couldn't get past the smell, taste or texture! It tastes nothing like pizza crust! Sorry, Chef John, this was not a favorite for me.

It still tasted like cauliflower.  Stuck to the pan, despite heavy oiling.  Fell into small pieces when I tried to remove it.

This dough tastes great and my entire family loved it, including the kids.  We topped with hummus, mozzarella, basil, tomato, feta, black olive and artichoke.  Absolutely fantastic.

I liked this recipe, and I thought making it was a lot of fun!  But, my family did not care for it (which shocked me).  Therefore, I probably won't make it again, but I encourage you to give it a shot ;)

I must say I was quite surprised how good this actually was. I'm not a huge cauliflower fan but I am doing weight watchers and see the merits of using it in recipes to reduce carbs, replace potatoes, etc.  I followed the recipe pretty closely-I subbed parmesan cheese for the goat cheese and added garlic powder and an Italian spice blend to help cover the cauliflowery taste.  I baked it on parchment and flipped it part way through cooking which worked well.  It got really dark and I was concerned I burned it but it was fine.  I agree with the other reviews that this truly is a 2 hour process, so not great for a quick mid-week pizza night.  May try doubling the batch and freeze one to see how it works prepping everything and mixing ahead of time to use on the fly.  As a side benefit I don't feel that heavy yucky feeling in my stomach after eating it like I do with regular pizza.   Thanks for another great recipe Chef John.

As weird as this recipe sounded..it was truly very good. I don't like goat cheese so didn't even substitute that with anything and it still turned out great. I followed the recipe as far as the toppings he showed (on video). Now, I am curious about all the different options for toppings! And...I wonder if I could make the dough ahead of time and freeze it or have on hand for quick (er) pizza. Bottom line...this tastes GOOD and it's healthy! What could be better?
