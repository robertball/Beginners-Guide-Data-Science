This is a great recipe.  It looks really impressive and it's quite easy to make.  I think next time I might try a milder cheese -- maybe jack or swiss.  At times the gruyere really over-powered the chicken and vegetables.

Didn't care for this at all, the gruyere cheese was overwhelming, just overwhelming. Won't try this again anytime soon. Way too strong of a cheese.

Very impressive entre.  By the time these are done they look a bit small, but don't be deceived, they're very filling.

I changed a couple of things so was hesitant to review this, but I added a photo so wanted to mention what I did. I made a veggie dish and forgot to put aside the zucchini and carrots so did without in this one. I also used Dubliner Cheddar cheese and regular ham. I make chicken cordon bleu for my Dad often so he knows the difference between this ham and cheese and gruyere and prosciutto. He was very impressed with this dish, but of course prefers the better ham and cheese. I don't eat meat, but his review was that it was juicy and very flavorful. Overall this is a lovely presentation and fairly easy to prepare. I will definitely make this again, veggies and all. When I do, I will certainly update this review. Thanks Marie!

Easier to make than I thought, and I couldn't believe that my kids loved it! Served it with a basic bechamel sauce as suggested. I went light on the cheese based on other comments but I would probably take the cheese back up again; you could barely taste it.   Definitely making this again!

This turned out very well.  I taught this to my Home Ec class and everyone raved!  Here are my mini-modifications:
- Cut each chicken breast in half horizontally/length-wise so as to have two thin fillets, and continued with recipe.  This made two pieces per person;
- I did chicken out (haha) and go with Swiss cheese as per peoples' comments and because Swiss was on sale (I had a strict budget), it blended very well.  I will go with Gruyere when I make it at home; 
- used Proscuitto (yumm!) for the ham and may try the shrimp next time;
- layered it on puffed pastry Vol-o-Vents, and topped with a Bearnaise Sauce... 
Over-all, an excellent and easy recipe for even the beginner.  And the teens I teach loved it!  So a positive 5-stars.
