These were great!  I read the other reviews, and I cut down on the eggs and only used two, and added 1/4 cup raspberry jam.  Turned out perfectly.  Thanks, mcbartko.

- needed more raspberry flavor, so I  - used 1/2 c. seedless raspberry jam & 1-2 Tbsp. rasp. flavoring - used 4-5 tsp. lemon zest (from 2 lemons) - made 2 big loaves on 12 x 18 pan - good flavor, soft & dense, not dry & crunchy  Dec. 2010

I took others advice and doubled the lemon zest to 4t. (When I make it again I'll add another teaspoon.)   And, because I'm lazy and cheap I just  used 3/4 cup of some cherry berry preserves I had on hand.  YUM!!  The texture is slightly different than your standard biscotti, but it still great.

I have made many different kinds of biscottiand was excited to try something different.The uncooked dough had a nice lemon/raspberry flavor, but the raspberry flavor got lost in the baking.  Maybe use a rapberry jam or preserves instead of fresh?

I thought these had a very nice, subtle flavor. I used a little less sugar and 2 eggs. I don't have a fine strainer, so I used pantyhose to separate the raspberry juice from the seeds. Kind of messy, but it mostly worked. I'd like to try these again using preserves.

These Biscottis were very good.  I would add more lemon and also more raspberries next time I make them, you can only taste a hint of the raspberry and lemon, I also melted some chocolate and added fresh raspberries to the chocolate and dipped each cookie in the chocolate mixture.

I have to agree--I couldn't taste the raspberry or lemon flavors (after reading the reviews I added extra raspberry syrup and a few teaspoonfuls of lemon juice). I think if I did this again, I would opt for the raspberry extract and not waste fresh (and EXPENSIVE) raspberries in this. However, I absolutely loved the base recipe. I have been experimenting with biscotti recipes and this one had a wonderful texture and wasn't too sweet or soft or hard.So, I'll definitely make this again, but play around with other flavors.

Could not taste any raspberry flavor only lemon after baking.  Also found the product to be overly sweet.

Based on other reviews, I used 3/4 cup seedless black raspberry jam and 1 tablespoon raspberry extract.  I drizzled the tops with melted chocolate that I flavored with more of the jam (melted) and raspberry extract.  They were a hit with my coworkers.

This was very very yummy.  I added a handful of whole raspberries just for something different.  It has a nice hint of raspberry and lemon.. nothing overpowering.  I am newly pregnant and I can actually eat these.  :)

I doubled the amount of raspberry, but there still wasn't much flavor at all.

Couldnt taste the raspberries. But the biscotti themselves, although plain in flavor baked up very nicely, directions easy to follow. I will try again but maybe double the berries- reduce them as much as possible so the dough doesnt get sticky.

I wanna make 1/3 of this recipe but I'm kinda running low on eggs so would it be ok if I replaced the 1 egg with 2 tbs of potato starch & 2 tbs of water????? And what can I do to intensify the lemon & raspberry flavor without one over-powering the other?????

I took Tree's advice and added a touch of raspberry flavoring to the fresh raspberries just to intensify the flavor and YUM, these turned out awesome!

Loved the recipe.  It was easy and turned out great.  I added some chopped walnuts.  I think you can do this with a variety of fruits.  I'm going to try it with some others.  Also, I did not strain out the raspberry seeds and it didn't make any difference to us as we love raspberries.

These were very good.  I doubled the lemon and raspberries and wasn't disappointed.
