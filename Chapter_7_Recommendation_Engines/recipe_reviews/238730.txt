This is great! Simple yet awesome flavor! I only made a few changes. I baked it only because it was raining too much to grill, it still tastes great. 350,  2lbs 50 mins. On the mango salsa I added 1/2 a lime,  1 tsp venigar, and half a seeded fresh jalapeño. Turned out great, but I can't wait to try it on the grill!

I made this tonight. My husband loved it! I think next time I'll use more brown sugar. There wasn't much of a crust or glaze on it. Mango salsa was good but needed more spice.

Very good!  Made it exactly as directed, grilled on high to sear and then turned grill down and cooked for another 60 minutes until internal temp reached 145. So moist, my husband, who does not impress easily said it is a keeper!

Ok, I think this has just become THE recipe of the summer! Not that I was expecting this to be bad - I just didn't expect it to be THIS good! The only changes I made was to use lime juice instead of orange (it's what I had on hand), and I added about half a minced jalapeño to the mango salsa.  I grilled the tenderloin to a medium boneless and it was so tender and flavorful. We couldn't stove raving about it! The rub was so simple, yet tasted homemade. I will be using this rub on ribs in the future!

This was tasty and easy.  Grocery was out of tenderloins, so I used this on pork chops.  Salsa was tasty, not sure if I would add the seasoning mix next tim though.

Couldn't find the McCormick's Gluten Free Chili seasoning at the grocery store where I usually shop. They had the McCormick's Gluten Free Taco seasoning. I substituted that instead. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. YUMMY!
