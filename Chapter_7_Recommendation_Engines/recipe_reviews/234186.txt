I used cayenne pepper instead of jalapeno because I didn't have any and it turned out great!  I also prefer the Extra Sage sausage.  Great Recipe.

I made this recipe for a wrestling tournament and made approximately 100 of the little bites of love.  These were a huge hit with the moms, wrestlers, coaches and refs.  Thank you for this recipe!!!  I will use this over and over again.

We loved these! I didn't have a jalapeno but I did have Jalapeno Jelly! After these baked we spread the croissant with the Jalapeno jelly and made pigs of our selves!!

Very good recipe. I had left over croissants already made up. Did not have jalape√±os so I used pepper jelly. Made up the mix and then put in oven to warm them up. Kids loved them.

I made these and they're actually pretty terrible. Edible but unsatisfying and a waste of good ingredient. Never making this again!
