Couldnt find paneer, so I omitted that. Next time I will only use one chili. This was really good, even if it was a little hot!

I had this as a side dish with tandoori chicken and a few chutneys. Easy to make. Btw, Mexican queso panela is a good substitute for the paneer.

didn't have corn; used 1/3 can drained chick peas and dried fenugreek leaves instead of sugar

This is really flavorful and fun.  I made it with homemade paneer and fresh off the cob white sweet corn and it was very hard to stop myself from eating all of it before calling the family to dinner.  Oh, we are a cilantro-free household as most family members detest it, so I substituted pea shoots instead, and they were a nice addition to the dish.  Give it a try!

When I can't find the paneer I'll substitute it with whatever hard, mild, white cheese is available. I've never met anyone that doesn't love this-- IT'S THE BEEEEESSSST!
