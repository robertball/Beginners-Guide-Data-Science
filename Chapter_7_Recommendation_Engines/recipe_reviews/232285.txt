My fiancé is stubborn with my new vegan diet. I asked him to make this recipe to accompany dinner, since I wasn't feeling well. He moaned and complained that it looked weird, etc. It practically started a fight.

We sit down to eat, take a bite, and HOLY MOLY were we both blown away at how delicious this was! Unprovoked, he expressed his delight over this gravy. We couldn't tell the difference between this and animal product derived gravy. Super delicious, I highly recommend it! 

We used vegetable oil and soy sauce in place of the canola oil and tamarind sauce.

I made this a few times this holiday season.  Like many recipes (other than baking) I fiddled with the ingredients a bit. For our Mushroom wellington, I chose to make it more savory with veg broth and sage/thyme.  I changed some of the spices up for our gardein roast and and used rosemary and a tad of nutmeg.  For biscuits and gravy I used chikin broth and a bit (lot) of pepper.  a touch of fennel and mushrooms and it was on point.  I went so far as to make this for a work party and nobody bitched that it was vegan. Win

I give this five stars as a basic gravy recipe.   Instead of the oil I used Earth Balance butter.  I sauteed crimini mushrooms in the butter added the rest of the ingredients.  i used Hemp Milk instead of soy because it's thicker than soy and good for cooking.   Great recipe that you can switch up if needed.

This. Is some of the best gravy I have had in my entire life. I was fairly skeptical at first but as soon as I took a bite of it (I made it with a recipe on here for vegan mashed potatoes) I was sold. It’s rare for a recipe on here to be perfect as written but this one definitely is. Excellent recipe thank you so much for sharing!

I made it with almond milk because that is what I had.  I also used Italian spice mix with ground sage.  I would not make it the way stated by adding the flour into the oil mixture.  I will make it again like regular gravy by dissolving the flour in the liquid first. (broth and milk)

Sensational. Flavorful. Phenomenal. I did add 8T cornstarch because I love thick gravy. Would absolutely make again.

I made this twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  The oil taste was so strong that I threw the whole batch out.  I tried it again using 1/4 butter in place of the oil.  I also added a bit of salt.  That was a lot better, but still not what I would call good.
