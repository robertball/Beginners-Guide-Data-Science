Great kid-friendly and weeknight recipe! I strongly recommend mixing it well before pressure cooking (as instructed). If not, the top layer of noodles will be hard.

i made this, full recipe, in an Instant Pot Lux - 6 quart. Very good recipe. More like savory than spicy and very Polish taste combinations. I will make this very quick recipe again. I had doubts that it would cook properly and without triggering the "burn" warning. Well I didn't get a burn warning and it cooked perfectly. If you like Polish savory dishes, you have to try this.

Tried making in the Insta Pot but kept getting burn error. Got the burn notice just after pressure came up. I released pressure, uncovered and dumped everything in a large bowl and deglazed pot with extra chicken broth. Returned everything back to the insta pot with a little more chicken broth and got burn error again. Tried a third time where I emptied the pot, deglazed and washed to cool it down. Added everything back and got third burn error. Finished cooking on the stove. Added some paprika and parsley. Tasted good and everyone enjoyed.

This was really good.   Only thing I substituted was a splash of olive oil to cook the onion in lieu of butter.   Happily surprised that such an easy recipe was so good!

Not bad, but I do think more spices are needed.  At least a medium-sized cabbage is essential, since it cooks down so much.  As the poster and another reviewer mentioned, proper mixing of all ingredients before pressure cooking is important, to ensure the top layer of noodles gets enough moisture.  I thought I had mixed mine enough, but the top noodles were still a little dry or al dente.  Finally, I appreciated the time for the Instant Pot to heat up and release pressure being included in the instructions; it drives me crazy when recipes don't include that information.

Very tasty and easy. Still getting used to using the Instapot, so this built my confidence. Used fewer noodles and did not add any salt. Will make again.

Good, basic recipe. I used an Instant Pot Lux. I couldnâ€™t put all of the cabbage and noodles in bc I was at the max line. I took out about 2 cups of dry noodles and was able to get most of the cabbage in. Turned out great!  I have saved this recipe and will make it again. Thanks for sharing!

Added extra noodles because it was a 16 oz package and some extra broth because of that. Delicious recipe!
