Very good recipe. Fresh flavors and a nice change from a lettuce salad! I didn't add the bean liquid but added a bit more vinegar and more lemon juice for more freshness. Try to cool the oil before adding it to the salad as it did "darken" my basil a bit. Big hit with the family and will definitely make it again!
