I replaced 1/2 cup of the water with 1/2 cup golden rum.  Gave it a little something extra.  Excellent and very easy recipe.

I made this substituting the water for rum 1 for 1, which I thought was too strong. Next time I would use 1/2 rum 1/2 water, as another reviewer suggested.  It was well received at the bbq I made it for, no leftovers.

I was disappointed in this cake.  I made it for our July 4th picnic.  It was more like a plain pound cake.  Couldn't taste the Pina Colada flavor.  I won't make this again.

This was a big hit.  At first I didn't think I was doing it right but it came out okay.  The frosting was runny so instead I used it as a glaze.  I filled the hole with fruit.  Yum!

Yum!!! I can't rave enough!!!  This cake was fantastic!!!  It had such a great flavor and it was easy too.  You could tell that it was a Pina Colada cake because it had the distinct flavor.  The glaze was great also.  After it was complete, I filled the middle and lined the sides with fresh strawberries.

The cooking time was actually an hour and the glaze needed two or more cups of powdered sugar to make it thick enough.  But the finished product smelled wonderfuk and tasted great cold or room temp

This cake was very good and the people I served it to enjoyed it, but the pina colada flavor was not as strong as I would have liked.  But overall, it was pretty good.
