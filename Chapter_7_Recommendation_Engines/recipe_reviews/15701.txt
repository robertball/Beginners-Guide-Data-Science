This is a very simple and good recipe. I found the italian bread crumbs added good flavor I also use salt and pepper. I covered mine with a glaze of tomato soup and brown sugar. There was no leftovers.

This was my first time making this dish. I wish that i would have used the entire package of onion soup mix. the loaf needs it. the sour cream is a really nice touch. i liked that a great deal however i would recommend putting in hp sauce for an added kick that this dish is definately missing.

I used this recipe with turkey not beef and it tasted very flavorfull and moist. But it took about a half an hour longer than the recipe required in baking time.

I used all ground beef instead of the sausage and about a quarter of an onion. I topped it with ketchup and it was delicious.

I cooked this for a half hour over the cooking time and it was still not cooked. It didn't even hold shape. I think the flavor would have been good if it would have cooked properly.

Overall it is a good simple meatloaf. I think it needs a little more seasoning. My Kids loved it.

Meatloaf tasted ok but was still mushy after baking for about 1 hour 10 minutes. 1hr is definitely not enough.

This recipe was flavorful moist and relatively easy to make. We put it in an 8x11 pan to help the meatloaf cook faster. We like our meatloaf a bit more well done than other people. We used a 1/4 pound sausage instead of the half pound and still found it to be too greasy. I thought the recipe would make great meatballs for stroganoff. The presentation wasn't good I might add some parsley or a red sauce for color.

The recipe was good I am a sauce guy and there is no sauce so I added 1/2 cup of ketchup mixed with 1 tbs of brown sugar. I also added cayenne pepper to give it a kick. 10 minutes before done I added Monterey Jack Cheese and chopped parsley to the top. To make it more fun we made it in a square cupcake pan.

Ok I liked this. It did not blow me away but I do not like meatloaf much. This is a pleasantly different tasting meatloaf from any others I have tried. Next time I will add a some more seasonings that I like (for my own tasete).

Pretty good. I dropped the onions (I don't like them) and mushrooms (boyfriend hates them) and used an extra egg (I found it a little dry before cooking). I'll make it again.

I really loved this simple recipe. I did add a dash of thyme some garlic powder salt and pepper. The only thing is I had to cook it for an extra 20 minutes! It was still almost raw inside after the 50 minutes on the instructions! Make sure you check it before you turn off the oven!!!

I didn't particularly enjoy this but 3 of our 7 LOVED it and demolished a double recipe in 2 days. I am not a sausage-in-the-meatloaf kind of person though.

Instead of using canned mushrooms I used equal amounts fresh baby bella mushrooms. I chopped them into fine bits and sauteed them in a little butter with the onion and a couple cloves fresh minced garlic. I let it cool a bit before folding it into the meat loaf mixture. Right before it finished I made a quick mushroom gravy to serve over the top. I paired this with Creamy Garlic Mashed Potatoes and fresh steamed green beans. Very tasty!

This was really delicious. The soup made it moist. I found that it needed cooking a lot longer than 50 minutes though or you should consider covering it with foil for part of the time.

I sauteed onions and mushrooms. It was pretty good but I'm not a fan of meatloaf. My family loves it though.

for something as basic as meatloaf without this recipe i fail everytime. i read the reviews and the recipe did not require the addition of an envelope of onion soup mix. but it sounded delicious so i added the whole thing. yipes! delicious. used some of the cream of mshroom soup for gravy making. the two additions really took this most basic of meals up a couple of notches. i served it with baked pototoes and french style string beans coorken in sliced fat back pork. added yeast biscuits and my friends came back for seconds on everything nothing left over and there were only 4 of us! even a beginer couldn't mess this up...ps as for mel's failure i think he set the oven at 190 instead of 375 must have misread the internal temp for the oven temp. hope he reads this again and gives this recipe a try.

It took about one hour and a half to cook it and then it would not hold together. Taste was pretty good but not that good.
