Always a big hit at a BBQ. Made this a few times and change it up. Cooked this in a slow cooker and it works well. I use Mexican nacho cheese in a can instead of the shredded cheese. (The shredded made it too stringy in the slow cooker)I added some jalape√±os half an onion and a cup of salsa. I served with corn chips and nacho chips. Had lots of good comments. Just make it a few hours before people arrive set it on low in the slow cooker until hot/ warm. Easy to throw together. You could use homemade chili too.

Recipe is so easy but needed spicing up: I added 1/2 jar of salsa and chopped up jalapeno.

This recipe is a great start but very bland. We added jar of salsa and it still wasn t spicy but definitely more flavorful. Next time I would also add a 4 oz. can chopped green chiles or maybe even a 4 oz. can of chopped jalapenos depending on the crowd. I served it with both scoop corn chips and scoop tortilla chips. Now this is coming from a gal who prefers tortilla chips but we all thought the corn chips were the clear winner. They are the perfect compliment to the flavors in the dip. Best served warm in a crockpot on low.

This is a 'no fuss no muss' recipe; perfect for those lazy summer get togethers! The slow cooker doesn't heat up the house so it is ideal for even the warmest summer days! No prep time just open a few cans and voila! a perfect munchie!

Wow this was fantastic! Very simple - almost too simple! I had no idea cream cheese was the "magic" ingredient in chili/cheese sauce!

LOVED this recipe! I've been looking for an easy chili cheese dip. I used Mexican shredded cheese instead of regular cheddar and it gave it a little zing but still wasn't spicy. This recipe will be a repeat for parties at my house!

This is pretty good I used homemade chili. I cut the recipe down to 50 servings which still makes a lot.

I've had a similar dip at a party and was excited to make this one but I was really disappointed with how it turned out. It felt like it was really missing something so I added some hot sauce to mine which gave it a little more flavor but it wasn't anything I'd make again following this recipe.

I used chili with beans. I also added green onions jalapenos and hot sauce for extra kick. I mixed everything together and topped with cheddar cheese. Then I just heated it in microwave. Tasted great and was so easy to fix.

Super tasty and super easy! Will halve the next time we make it though as this made way more than we needed.

I used turkey chili 1/3 less fat cream cheese and about 1 cup of 2% shredded mixed cheeses. I also added a small can of green chilies for some added kick. Even with the "low fat" effect everyone still really liked the recipe and it was gone quickly.

I have made this by spreading the cream cheese in a pie plate and pouring a 15 oz can of chili over it and topping with cheese and then putting it in the microwave for 5 minutes. Delicious and easy!

So easy and so great! I use chili without beans so it's just a meaty creamy mixture. And I don't use the cheddar cheese either. Just a can of beans and one block of cheese in the fondue pot. Serve with corn chips. Delish!

Oh! no! The secret is out! This simple dip has always been a hit at any event in my family for 30 years - the chili/cream cheese is awesome by itself and it leaves lots of room for experimentation. I have found it best with scoops ( corn chips )

Yummy--the real cheeses are MUCH better than fake or lowfat cheese. I add the small cans of chopped green chiles for a little more warmth. You can also add ground beef salsa chopped jalapenos to taste. Great for potlucks with scoops or tortilla chips. Thanks for posting this!

I found this recipe to be quick easy and devoured quickly. I made it for a church Youth Group activity with about 40 teenagers. I doubled the recipe and added 2 cups of salsa. Even with the double recipe the dip was completely polished off within an hour. Great for parties and for teenagers:)

I used low fat cream cheese. If I had to do over again I would use regular cream cheese. The low fat stuff just made it kind of lumpy. I used leftover homemade chili to make this. All and all everyone liked it as an appetizer on Easter. Thanks for the recipe.

This is so simple to make and everyone always asks me for the recipe! The only thing I do differently is I layer the cream cheese (1 pkg) chili (1 or 2 - 14 oz cans) and cheddar cheese (1-2 c.) and bake it in a 9x9 cassarole dish. Sometimes if I want to add a little spice I'll stir in 1/2 cup of salsa and some chopped jalapenos to the chili. So very good with corn chips or tortilla chips. Perfect for game days.:D

Good dip. I'm always afraid to use cream cheese in recipes for my inlaws side of the family cause they swear they "hate it" but they came for xmas and they ate it up and no one even questioned. I do think that it could use some jalepenos or something to give it more zip but then again some people just don't like heat. Thanks so much.

Good. I only had one 8oz package of cream cheese so this is all I used. I also jazzed it up by adding onion and garlic powder and chopped jalapenos. Topped the finish product with green onions. This is good stuff.

I halved the recipe (so glad I did...) used 2 cans of Hormel no bean chili 1 block cream cheese 8 oz Mexican Velvetta (hoping for a little spice/kick) but this still came out lacking flavor. I won't be making it again.
