This was one of those really good surprise meals.  So easy yet so tasty.  Here's what I used:  1.5 cups italian Panko crumbs, 2 T fresh shredded parmesan, 1 egg, 2 T. flour, 2 cups spagetti sauce and 3 T shredded mozzerella.  I dredged my 6 chicken tenders in the flour and then into the egg.  Mixed the parmesan and panko together and then dredged the egg soaked tenders, patting the breading on pretty thick.  I did spray the baking sheet and the top of the tenders with Canola oil spray.  I baked for about 16 minutes at 375 and then turned the broiler on to really crisp up the top.  It was a hit for my picky husband and me so it will definately go into my rotation.  Healthy too!

My husband's stomach is probably giving this 5 stars.  He said it was better than Olive Garden's!  I used cheap ingrdients froma local store and it still came out fabulous.  I decided to add a little Italian seasoning and parmesan cheese to my croutons and I made sure to put on a lot of sauce and cheese.  This recipe is easy to adapt for a dinner for two. Definitely will be making again.

Wow!!  I made this for the first time last night.  Thing is...I made it for 30 people.  They raved about it.  The only alteration to the recipe is that I used Italian Parmasan Bread Crumbs already crushed.  Many asked for the recipe. My mom said it was better than Olive Garden.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I used Italian bread crumbs mixed with parmesan cheese instead of croutons. I baked for about 18 minutes and then spooned on some spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese. I returned to the oven until the cheese melted. The chicken was crispy and had a good flavor. A quick and easy meal!

I cooked the breaded chicken on a metal cooling rake on top of the cookie sheet lined with foil.  It was crispy.  My cooking time was longer probably because of the thickness of the chicken.  Next time I will flaten the chicken.  I will make again soon.  Yummy!

This was GREAT! I also added Parmesan cheese to the crushed croutons. I also put in a little garlic, Italian spices, and a touch of salt. I made it two days in a row!!

This was good, although I think with a little doctoring it could be great. I made it with breadcrumbs instead of crushed croutons. Next time I will add some croutons or some additional seasoning because it could have used a little more kick. The chicken was tender though. I would also recommend pounding the chicken to flatten it first, that way you get more of the crispy coating in each bite. It browned nicely and was indeed done in 20 minutes.

This was really easy.  I added parmesan cheese to the crutons.  Also added sauce to the chicken with mozarella on top for the last 5-10 minutes of cooking.  Served with green beans, salad and pasta.

My husband loved this, I thought it was okay, but I will definitely make it again. Next time though, I'm going to make sure to get a thicker coating of breading on my chicken.

Very easy.  However, make sure the chicken is not big pieces or you will need additional baking time.

Made this for supper tonight, for the first time.  The chicken was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  We really enjoyed it and I served it with whole wheat past.  I added a bit more sauce and added some veggies to the sauce.  It was great and I will certainly make it again

This recipe was a hit!  I didn't have enough croutons so I used a combination of plain bread crumbs and crushed Cheerios (I was desperate!) and then added some Parmesan cheese, garlic powder and onion powder to the crouton/bread crumb/Cheerios mix.  When the chicken was done, I poured some homemade tomato sauce over it and sprinkled it with mozzarella cheese and returned it to the oven until the cheese melted.  Good stuff!

I took other's advice and pounded the chicken, the croutons made it come out well with added crispy texture. Didn't like the left overs even though they were reheated in oven... but great fast fix for a yummy supper that everyone will enjoy. Thanks

This was excellent!!!  I was a little nervous because i've never made homemade Chicken Parmesan before and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with how easy this recipe was.  My kids had a blast helping me crush up the croutons and my husband asked for me to make again.  Thanks for a simple, delicious recipe :)

This was really easy and really good!  I didn't have mozzarella so I used slices of provolone on top; I also sprinkled some grated parmesan cheese in the bread crumbs since I didn't have 4 cheese croutons. I've made this before but first time in the oven, I liked how easy and I didn't have to clean up a greasy mess from frying the chicken first.

This was excellent! I followed the tips in the review by Cindy in Pensacola for coating the chicken and broiling it and I made the sauce using the recipe "Bryan's Sweet and Hot Tomato Pasta Sauce", it was just so great, everyone loved it!! Yum - we'll have this again!!

Very easy and good - whole family enjoyed.  I did flatten the chicken breasts prior to cooking and added sauce and cheese in last 5 minutes of baking time.  Served with penne.

This is a great and very easy recipe! I used bread crumbs and egg substitute. I also wrapped the chicken in foil covered in cooking spray and cooked it on my George Foreman grill.  My husband and I both agreed that adding the spaghetti was a lot of food. next time I will probably only make 1/4 of the pasta if any. I will definitely make this again!

Very Yummy. Quick and Easy. Cooks in the time as told and comes out perfect. I would set the oven to broil the tops next time so it will stay really crunchy. We had ours with Mac n cheese and everyone loved it. It only took 30 min for everything to be ready and cooled for our toddlers liking.

I used homemade croutons (stale Dave's Killer Bread, little butter, garlic/onion powder, parmesan cheese, fresh ground pepper) that I broke down in my blender to bread crumbs. I used an organic egg with a little fat free evaporated milk wisked in so it would coat a little easier and for the sauce, I used homemade marinara (The Best Marinara Sauce Yet, which is also from this site) that I spiced up just a little more. After I sprinkled the mozzerella over the chicken, I also sprinkled just a touch of parmesan cheese over the top and broiled it for just a minute or so. My boys loved this. They ate every little bit.

Great, simple version of Chicken Parmesan...I would only suggest possibly marinading/seasoning the chicken prior to breading.  I, like several others, skipped the smashing of the croutons and simply used Progresso Italian bread crumbs and Bertolli pasta sauce instead of Prego...IT turned out perfectly. :)

I followed the recipe except for a couple of changes. I pounded the chicken thin between plastic wrap and double dipped the chicken. It gave it a nice crunchy crust and it cooked faster.  My husband says this is the best chicken parmesan he has ever had.

I was hoping this would be good, and had great expectations; but it really was not anything to rave about.  The chicken was very juicy, but the recipe was very, very bland and boring.  We had to add salt, pepper, and italian seasoning and it was still really blah :-(

The chicken was very moist.  My family did not enjoy this meal but that is just us, we do not like pasta sauce and chicken together.   I gave it five stars because it was easy to fix and chicken stayed moist.

So simple and so yummy! I didn't have the croutons on hand, so I simply made my own bread crumbs by using two heels from a loaf of italian bread, and adding some garlic salt & basil to the bread crumbs. (Just put the bread, torn up into smaller pieces by hand, into your blender on low for a minute or so, and you'll have bread crumbs!) Very good.

It was awesome.  I used sausage spaghetti sauce for the topping but it was delicious.  It was crispy but moist.  Boyfriend normally gets in my way but with the task of crushed croutons, I managed to keep him busy while I could actually function.  We ate it up pretty fast.  But maybe next time I'll try to put it on spaghetti.  I bet that would be delicious.

This was good and easy  I didn't have the exact kind of croutons it called for, so I used a combination of Panko bread crumbs, Asiago Croutons and Caesar croutons.  I added a little garlic powder to the mix too. I sprinkled a little salt on the chicken before breading. It was much healthier and less messy than frying.  After I put the sauce and cheese on it, I put it under the broiler for a few mins.

I used thin sliced chicken breasts.  For my crumbs, I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and added fresh grated Pecorino Romano cheese to the crumb mixture.  I used a jar of marinara sauce and added some sauteed Baby Portobello mushrooms to the sauce mixture.  I served with roasted asparagus and roasted Roma tomatoes.  It was the first meal I cooked for my girlfriend.  She and I both enjoyed it.

This was a good recipe.  Easy and not many ingredients.  Good family meal when you dont have a whole lot of time.  I did some things different though.  I used a glass dish to bake in.  Instead of vegetable spray I used unsalted butter to coat dish.  Used half plain bread crumbs and half Cheese & Garlic croutons.  Great balance!  I did spray the chicken after breading it with olive oil spray.  I dont use vegetable oil spray anymore.  Cooked for the allotted time and then poured a half a jar of Prego Tomato and Basil sauce over the chicken and topped with a lot of mozzarella cheese.  I popped back into oven for an additional 5-7 minutes to melt cheese and warm sauce.  Delicious.  Gotta be careful how much sauce you actually put on it.  It will drown the chicken and breading will come off if you use too much.  I only used half a jar and it was perfect!

Just made it tonight for the first time and it was awesome! Very easy! I didn't have any croutons so I used bread crumbs mixed with parmesan cheese! I put the chicken over spaghetti, but it would be good over crusty french bread too! Enjoy!

Did this tonight with a few changes Used chicken coating pkg with extra italian seasoning in it. Also added a couple of shakes of cayenne.  Sauce was homemade with some Catelli added.  Served with spaghettini.  Broiled the chicken with cheese at the end.  Well supper has been eaten and it was a hit.  Will definitely make this again.  Quick and easy!!!

I don't understand why people rate a recipe when they completely change most of the ingredients, but oh well... I thought this was a good, easy recipe to try.  It came out really good - crispy flavorful coating, juicy chicken and yummy sauce and cheese.  I'm pretty sure I used more than 1/4 cup of cheese on top and a couple of my kids opted for no sauce and mozzarella so they squeezed lemon juice on theirs!  They don't know what they missed!

I made this for 10 people, so the only adjustments to the recipe I made were the serving size!  This is an absolutely wonderfully delicious recipe!!  I had to beat the chicken breasts down because they were pretty thick and had to cook them in shifts, but by the time I was done with everything this was a perfect meal to serve!  My guests loved it!  I will definitely make this again!  I served it with Green Beans with Almonds which I also got from this site.  Very good pairing!!

Great!!!!!! The only thing is that cooking it for 20 min. does NOT give it enough time.  I think I ended up giving it around 40 min. in the end.  I didn't do 4 cheese croutons, I did garlic.  I ended up dipping the chkn in milk because I had no egg.  Didn't effect the taste.  WOWWWWWW  Still, AMAZING!  I served it with asparagus.

This recipe was sooooo good! My whole family loved it! I used Italian Bread Crumbs with a little salt, pepper, garlic salt, and parsley flakes. The chicken was to die for!! I used a mushroom spaghetti sauce, with a teaspoon of onion salt, salt, pepper, parsley flakes, and garlic powder/salt. Served it on top of a short pasta with cheese... I am already craving it again!

Excellent! This has always been a favorite of mine when going out, and I had no idea it would be so easy to make at home. I used garlic breadcrumbs instead of croutons and seasoned them with your standard Italian seasonings...thanks a ton for sharing!

I cut the chicken into thin slices and pounded out. I used egg and Italian breadcrumb mixture and cooked on a sprayed baking sheet for 20 mins - that was plenty of time. I layered chn/my own sauce/mozz and parm cheese in a 9x13 and then broiled on low for about 10 mins or until cheese is browned.  So good.  Next time, I want to try it with the croutons.

This recipe was a hit especially with the kids. I did use more croutons, I spooned sauce over chicken and added cheese then put breasts back into oven (off) until pasta was done. It took my chicken about 30 min.

This was a pretty big hit in our family. Saved time crunching up crouton's; used Italian bread crumbs and sprinkled Rustic Tuscan Seasoning on chicken before spraying. Half way through cooking, added 1/2 cup of water to keep bottom from burning.   Served heated sauce separate as some didn't want it added on top of chicken. Accompanied with tomato and cucumber salad and steamed cauliflower in nacho cheese sauce. Will have again in a couple months.

This was very yummy, my whole family loved it.  I also added a some italian seasoning and garlic salt to the bread crumbs.   I did flatten the chicken and it still took closer to 30 minutes to cook.  Didn't get quite as crispy as I would have liked so I think next time I will bake at a higher temperature.  Great recipe, will make again!

I love this recipe! I used Italian bread crumbs and flattened my chicken breasts, baked them for 1/2 hour before putting spaghetti sauce and cheese on them. My husband said it was the best meal I made!

Very easy, but I wasn't a huge fan.  I found it to be kind of tasteless.  I may try again with more seasonings.  Will continue searching for a better chicken parm recipe, though.

Exactly what I was looking for. Quick, easy and delicious. Made me out to be a better cook then I really am. ^_^ I added fresh parmesan and a bit of garlic salt. Simply amazing. Thank you!

I usually can not find any recipes that I like and can actually attempt to make.  This one looked promising!  I made it last night for dinner! My picky husband loved it!  I will definitely will make this again.  Needs more sauce than just one cup!

Absolutely delicious, and a cinch to prepare!  The easiness made it possible for me to spend that extra time making special sauce.
