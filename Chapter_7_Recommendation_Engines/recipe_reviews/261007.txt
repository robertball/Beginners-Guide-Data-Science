I was hoping this would be like Panera Bread's Cream of Asparagus and Pea soup - not. It tasted very fresh but also very bland and watery. The second time I used half the Almond milk and half evaporated skim milk and I also added more asparagus (I didn't have any more fresh so I used part of a can of spears).  This was much better, still fresh but not bland or watery.  Served with a few bacon crumbles on top.  I would make it again with changes.
