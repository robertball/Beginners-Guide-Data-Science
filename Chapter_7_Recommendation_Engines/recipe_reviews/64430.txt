These are the best upside down pineapple cakes I have ever had. I made double the recipe and froze them. When I had visitors I popped them in the microwave for a minute and they were as good as the day they were originally made, Yum Yum

These were easy and tasty. I used my Texas sized muffin pans to make them (the pineapple rings fit perfectly) and ended up with about double-sized portions for what's listed for the nutritional info with the recipe. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe.  A suggestion - Instead of using whole pineapple, just used crushed works the same.

I thought this was wonderful. I just cut a small piece of the pineapple out to make it fit in a standard muffin cup, it was easy. Everyone loved them and I will be making them again.

I choose not to make individual cakes. Instead used an oblong glass baking dish. The recipe is very good. Thank You!

This was the best pineapple cake I have ever tasted. I recommend mixing in one cup of crushed pineapple to the cake mix. This makes it chunky and even sweeter. Great recipe!!!!!!!

Fantastic! I had enough to make 1 dozen regular sized cupcakes and one 8 inch round cake! I too had to cut a piece of the pineapple ring off but no big deal, I put a cherry on top in the middle of the ring after they cooled and they were a huge hit with my family! This is a keeper.

These mini upside-down cakes are the perfect summer dessert to serve and look so impressive and pretty...with hardly any work!  I always use fresh pineapple, and use some of the reserved juice in place of the water in the cake mix batter.  Fresh raspberries or fresh pitted sweet dark cherries taste so much better than maraschino cherries!

Recipe was great.  Like others, I used crushed pineapple.  I think it is just easier to eat then to try to cut apart a pineapple ring.

I'm not sure what a 3" muffin pan is but I used a standard muffin pan and this did not work.  I ended up cutting out a quarter of the pineapple slice (and probably should have cut out more.  I tried dumping the first tin onto a piece of wax paper, but the muffins went everywhere and the pinepapples went elsewhere.  I quickly put them back together as I was making them for a work birthday, but the brown sugar mixture was left behind on the wax paper.  When the second tin came out of the oven, I carefully scooped each cake out with a spoon, but the liquified brown sugar was left behind in the tin. The cakes tasted fine and were actually kind of pretty in a lopsided way, but I wouldn't attempt this again unless I substituted crushed pineapple.

These are easy and absolutely delicious.  I made 24 regular sized cupcakes.  A note about portioning the ingredients: a scant teaspoon of the butter/sugar mixture; a scant tablespoon of the crushed pineapple and 2 heaping tablespoons of the batter in each muffin and it all comes out even!!I also used paper muffin liners.

I LOVE pineapple upside down cake. It's seriously not good to have this in the house because I WILL eat an entire pan. I thought that making pineappe upside down cakes in cupcake tins would help keep me from inhaing an entire batch, and it worked, kind of, but I thought they turned out a little dry. I also used crushed pineapple instead of rings as they didn't fit very well on the bottom of the tins. A very cute recipe anyways, thanks for the idea.

Nice and moist cakes. Although for me there wasn't enough pineapple flavor in the cake batter so next time i might do as someone suggested and stir in some pineapple chunks or maybe add some pineapple extract to it. I made these on regular sized muffin pans (2 1/2 inches).

I made these for a ladies tea party, and everyone loved them they are soo easy and still impresive looking. I used the pinapple juice from the can to flavor the cake and it didn't make it to sweet or anything.

I made these for a church potluck.  Instead of pineapple rings I used the crushed pineapple...just about 2-20 oz. cans.  When they were done I piped whipped cream onto the tops of them and then topped them off with a cherry.  I got so many compliments on them that I will definately make this again and again.

The recipe was very good.  Next time I will definitely use a Jumbo muffin pan, it was a tight squeeze with the regular pan.  I used butter cake mix, instead of yellow cake mix...it's all I had in my kitchen.

This recipie is fun and delicious.
I took it to work for a bakeoff contest to raise money for Hurricane Katrina victims and everyone loved it.
I also took vanilla ice cream as an additional topper and that was a great favorite too!

These were a big hit at my family dinner!  It was nice to have such a good recipe for the occasion.  I took the advice of others and use crushed pineapple instead, and I'm glad I did.  I've been specially requested to make these again sometime.

Tasted great! I followed others' advice in their reviews and made them in jumbo muffin pans and used crushed pineapple. Tasty! It made 12 jumbo, individual cakes. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.

Very, very good!  I got a lot of compliments on this when I brought it in to work.  One note: I did have to cut about a third of each pineapple slice out to make it fit in the muffin tins.  No big deal; I'm just passing along what I did.

I have made this recipe several times and it is
wonderful and very easy. It impresses the guests
to have their own individual pineapple upside down
cake.  They don't last long at my house or wherever I take them for a treat.

I made these for breakfast this morning and they were GREAT!!.  I made a few changes... I made 6 large muffins, used 1 can of tidbits but still the same amount of butter and brown sugar and added the maraschino cherries in with the tidbits.  I only needed half the cake mix so i made a 8 inch round layer and I'll save that for a later recipe.  Excellent!!

I thought these were good - there were a little hard to get out of the pan in one piece. I had someone request the recipe so that is always a good sign. I have a fresh pineapple upside cake recipe that I like to use, but this one is good for something quick to put together.

I would suggest using the pineapple cake rather than yellow. I didn't get quite as much taste from the juice as I had hoped. The pineapple rings didn't fit in my muffin cups so I took out a wedge and tried to piece it together. Still tasted pretty good.

These were delicious!  I used cupcake liners and the pineapple was a tight fit but I made it work.  I used the pineapple cake mix which was really divine.  I had never tried it before and now I think I will use it just for cupcakes regularly.  The cakes were very pretty.  A big hit with kids as well as adults!  They weren't as good the next day because they got overly soggy.

Was very simple to make (except the pineapple rings didn't fit in my muffin cups so I cut them up) - and truly delicious!  I made 20 of them for a family dinner, and not even one was left.  Warm them before serving and serve with vanilla ice cream - Yum!

Easy to make and very tasty! My silly husband thinks it's just too cool that he gets his very own little cake. LOL
I used crushed pineapple per other reviewers suggestions. I had enough batter left over to make a 9" cake....hope hubby doesn't think it's his own little cake.

These turned out perfectly.  You do have to remove part of the pineapple ring to make it fit nicely in the muffin tin, though.  But I will definitely make these again!!

Very moist--it was just so-so.  I would not go through the effort to make them again.

These were excellent.  I did need more butter, sugar mix to have enough for 12 muffins.  I also used crushed pineapple and it worked just fine.  I will make these again for sure, more than likely this afternoon!!!  Thanks so much!!!
