Loved this recipe! I didn't have figs or cranberry juice so I substituted 1/2 c fig butter from Trader Joes and used the fig as a sauce.

I have made these several times and they were excellent. Last time, i didn't have pomegranate juice but had pomegranate margaritas from Costco. I reduced  the margaritas and proceeded with the recipe. Fabulous!

devoured it for dinner.  at a leftover one for lunch the next day. and for breakfast the following day.  rich and smoky from the cheese contrasted by sweetness and crunch form the shallots and figs. i feel this is the beginning of my love affair with bison.

Delish!!!!  I changed a couple things purely because of personal preference/what I had on hand but the original recipe sounds amazing too!!!  I omitted the thyme, used panko bread crumbs, 2 eggs, garlic, onion and chipotle powders,  and subbed almond milk.  I also topped with a slice each of Chipotle Gruyere, Smoked Gruyere and Havarti with Jalape√±o peppers. Also added blue cheese crumbles to the fig/shallot filling. Served on a toasted onion bun with baked butternut squash on the side!  It was divine and I can't wait to eat another one tomorrow!

I love bison. I was very happy with the burgers though I must say that I couldn't really taste the fig/shallot mixture as the bison itself seems to overpower it.  Not in a bad way, but it didn't seem worth the trouble to make the fig filling if I can't really taste it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Maybe it needs more fig or something that pulls the fig flavor out better.  I may experiment next time and use the fig more as part of a sauce like another reviewer did.

We loved this recipe!  I did use cranberry juice, and because I wasn't sure what kind of dried figs to use I used half  black Mission and half Calimyra.  Using bison I'd suggest you won't want to overcook it.  This made a very excellent meal tonight!  Once you figure out how you want to eat this----as a traditional hamburger-type or a more upscale type----you'll enjoy all the varieties you can make.  We will have this again!

Absolutely amazing super succulent recipe! Will definitely do again, I made it for two instead of four and it seemed a lil confusing in such small increments but everything was just enough and the burgers came out humongous! I only regret not having the correct cheese in the recipe. First time trying bison and won't be my last!

When I first came across this recipe I knew I had to try it, but I'm just not a fan of stuffed burgers.  I decided to serve the filling on top instead.  I soaked the figs in pomegranate juice as directed, but just couldn't bring myself to throw it away.   I added 1T of sugar and reduced it into a syrup which I used to coat the figs/shallot mixture instead of honey as well as to flavor the meat. Overall we thought these were very good, but there were so many deep rich flavors going on I found myself longing for a bit of tartness.  I wish I'd used a bit of goat cheese instead of the gruyere.

This burger is so good that it puts other burgers to shame. Made these tonight for company and everyone cleaned their plate. I followed the instructions exactly and they came out phenomenal.
