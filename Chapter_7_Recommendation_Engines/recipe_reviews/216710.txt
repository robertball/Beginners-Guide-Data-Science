This was interesting to try for its novelty of the Wisconsin cheese curds, but other than that it had little else going for it.  Three stars is being generous for a basic potato salad that calls for too much of both mayonnaise and mustard.  How much you use however, should depend upon what "8 red potatoes" means to you.  In my case, using tiny red potatoes in an amount that approximated what the submitter must have had in mind, I used a cup of mayo, a half cup of sour cream and just 1 T. of mustard which I found to be perfect.  I also added fresh dill, green onion and celery for that proverbial "crunch."  I coarsely chopped the eggs and added them right into the potato salad along with some cooked, crumbled bacon.  Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt and Lawry's Seasoning Salt gave it a little boost.  Catchy title and idea but it needs more than that.

Made it as written. Honestly, unless you are from Wisconsin or somewhere else where cheese curds are a big thing, you could substitute cubed or shredded cheddar cheese. The dressing has a strong mustard taste, which I like, but others might want to tone it down abit. You could also cut back on the mayo. I think 1 cup would be enough. Other than the cheese curds, it is a good, basic potato salad. I will keep it for those picnics where people want to have a sack of cheese curds to eat with their beer!

This was good. I used small cubes of shredded Sharp cheddar and left the skins on the potatoes. I also chopped the egg up and mixed it in.

I don't have the luxury of having access to authentic Wisconsin cheese curds (oh how I wish I did) so I cut some cheddar into small cubes.  I cut the recipe in half and used one large Russet potato.  This will be something that I make again this summer.  Thanks.
