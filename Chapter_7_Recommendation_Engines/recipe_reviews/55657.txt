This is so good!! I actually got all of the seafood (except scallops - didn't use) on sale and it only cost me $21.65 for everything.  It made enough for 6 people. I know if you don't get this stuff on sale it's going to cost a small fortune, but hey it's cheaper than paying the Sardine Factory's price per plate of this meal ($32.95 per person, yikes!!)

Try this, it's really good.  My husband really liked it.  We thought the clams were ok, unless we have company we will probably leave them out next time and replace with more crab.  Everyone thought the crab was the best ingredient!! Next time I won't forget to buy the scallops either.
