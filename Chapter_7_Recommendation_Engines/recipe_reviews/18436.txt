This recipe was very easy and really only took 15 minutes, which was awesome. I also think it set up quickly- less than 2 hours, definitely.   I'm saving this recipe but definitely think that next time, I'm trying it with more yogurt and WAY less (or no) salad dressing. I used Miracle Whip, but I (and all my guests) could specifically taste it...which to me, was very weird.
