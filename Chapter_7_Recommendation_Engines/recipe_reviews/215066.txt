Excellent fish, crusty and not at all greasy!  I added parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs, and cooked in 1/2 sesame oil and 1/2 vegetable oil.  I'll definitely make this again.

is was so quick and easy to make and very tasty!  I loved the light crispy coating.  It was not greasy at all.  I didn't even have soy sauce and it was still delicious.  I added some garlic powder, Lawry's Seasoned Salt and some pepper.  I was in such a hurry to make dinner I didn't read where it said to cut the tilapia into 2-inch pieces.  I just heated the oil and dipped the whole fillets in flour, egg and the bread crumbs.  I just added a few extra minutes until the fish flaked easily with a fork.  Next time I will try with the soy sauce, but I loved this without it.  Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe!

While this was on overall good dish, I was expecting to taste more of the soy. I really did not taste the soy that much. I made some salad dressing with soy and toasted sesame seed oil and drizzled over the fish. Next time I make this I will add a bit of sesame seed oil into the soy / egg mixture for a bit more of a kick. Good dish though. It made for a nice lunch today.

Great dish!! I did not cut into pieces. Cooked stovetop in EVOO. I used flavored croutons and crushed them in a bag for my 'bread crumbs'. Added salt to the flour and Garlic Powder and Garlic Salt, Pepper and Itailian Season to the bread crumbs. NOTE - pat the fish dry before putting in flour. Flour will hold to the better and hold the crumbs better!

We LOVED this recipe!  My husband kept asking for more.  I used frozen tilapia and didn't cut into pieces. It took less time than recipe said. Maybe my fish was thinner??  I will for sure make this again.

This was great!  I agree that the soy wasn't prominent but I didn't care. Used Mahi and darn if this didn't taste just like fried chicken. :). Had to make seasoned breadcrumbs. Panko, seasoned salt, pepper and parsley. Kids loved it and I will make this again!!

Hubby didn't really like the breading-then again I used gluten free bread crumbs and made the addition of the Parmesan cheese as suggested. Instead of using flour I used cornstarch before breading. With the cornstarch the breading stuck awesomely!

This is good but I agree the soy is not very prominent.  I added a little sesame oil w/ the soy and egg and that made it better.  Maybe some sort of sauce over top w/ soy would be good too.

This was so good! I made brown rice and broccoli to go along with it and it all took less than a half hour. Great meal for days when you are in a hurry!

I really liked this recipe.  I didn't have any soy sauce..so I had to use worchestire instead.  I am going to try it again to see how I like it..unfortunately the fish I bought was not fresh. I think it will taste much better next time.

This recipe was absolutely beatiful. It was simple, delicious, and very clean looking. I have been trying to implement more fish into our diet, but that has proved difficult because my husband hates fish. His exact words were, "This is the best fish I have ever had!" Success :)

This was delicious. I accidentally burned the outer bread crumbs a bit so i will try to turn down the heat next time. I followed another viewer's tip and added parmesean cheese and sesame oil. The fish was a little dry so I made a dip of vinegar, miced garlic and splash of fish sauce for the side.

Delicious--I was concerned that it would be bland, but the soy sauce was a surprisingly great ingredient--and I even used the reduced sodium kind. I am a new wife, and very sensitive to how my husband reacts to our meals, and he seemed to love this. I will definately make it again!

A good and easy recipe! The tilapia doesn't have much flavor, so dip it longer in the soy sauce.

Super easy way to make tilapia. I added more seasonings to the breadcrumbs. I didnt have any parm on hand, but will def add that next time. Not sure why the recipe says to cut fish into pieces. I did that with one piece and was so much more work. I cut the filets in half and gave the nuggets to my kids. Cooks way faster than it calls for, I burned the first few pieces. Also, I had to double the breadcrumbs and flour.

I loved the way it was cooked with that little crisp breading! I do agree that you could not really taste the soy that much. I tried some with sesame and fish oil like reviewers suggested but that wasn't quite right to me. I'm planning to make again and play around with it.

We couldn't taste the soy sauce, and it just seemed kind of bland.  Tilapia is such a delicate fish that it isn't really suited to frying in a light breading -- it falls apart very easily.  The kids liked it, but the adults thought it was just okay.

This is good and worth trying. I was a little afraid that the soy sauce would be overwhelming, but we couldn't taste it at all. They were nice and crispy, and not greasy. I just think they need some sort of spice and then would be five stars.

Absolutely loved it. Just mix in some "stir fry sauce" with the egg and soy sauce and you make a really fantastic taste. Other than adding the stir fry sauce, I did everything more so based on eye-measurements since I only made the single tilapia. Truly amazing.

This was great!!!!  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and panko breadcrumbs.  It was so tasty for tilapia which usually doesn't have a tremendous amount of flavor.  I will make again for sure.

I actually hate fish but am trying to incorporate it into my diet. I tried this out and absolutely loved it! It wasnâ€™t fishy at all, had a good flavor & texture. (I used more italian bread crumbs than it called for & used some sweet chili sauce on the side)

Very good! Loved the light crispness over the flaky flesh. I'll try with panko and play with the seasoning next time.

Made it with haddock and it was exceptional. Only change made was using panko instead of breadcrumbs and adding a bit of shredded Parm cheese. One of my favorites!

While this was nice and crispy, we both felt it lacked flavor, and we also felt as if it needed some kind of sauce.

I don't like fish all that much but my family loves it so I have been searching for a recipe that I can tolerate so I don't have to make a separate dinner on fish nights. Well, this fish is delicious! I never thought I would say that but I honestly can't wait to make it again. I fried the fish then put it straight onto a baking sheet and put them in the oven to finish cooking through. I cooked them low (about 200) for at least an hour if not more. they were perfect! I served it with the bacon fried rice recipe I got off this website. it was a hit! The kids asked if I could make it again tomorrow.

Great basic recipe for tilapia.  I used a special teriyaki sauce in place of the soy sauce and added fresh lemon juice with the egg/teriyaki mixture.  I used Panko bread crumbs with my homemade seasoning and a little chopped fresh parsley.  Fried in avocado oil.

I just recently started cooking fish and found this to be a very easy and tasty recipe. Although I used low-sodium soy sauce because my grandmother eats everything with little to no salt. I can say there was little taste though, so we added lemon to it and it brought out more flavor. I will be adding garlic powder next time.

Made this recipe for the family and it went over very well.  As suggested by others I added some Panko, used lite soy sauce, added some sesame oil to the soy/egg mixture and added parmesan cheese.  Delicious!  Thank you for the recipe. Oh, I also dried the tilapia before running it through the flour.  This did make the flour stay on the fish.

I didn't like this fish recipe at all and neither did my family. I even added some parmesan because my family really loves cheese. But it didn't make a difference. It just tasted way too floury and also like out was missing something.

Everyone in my family really liked it, only crumbs remaining.  I added a liberal amount of onion powder and ginger to the bread crumbs to give it a little more kick.

I've cooked fish and chicken this same way for years except for the addition of soy sauce so that was a nice change and not over powering.  I did use low sodium soy sauce and panko bread crumbs.  Nice recipe!

This was pretty good. I followed others suggestions and added sesame oil to the soy sauce mixture, and also cooked mine in 1/2 sesame oil and 1/2 canola oil. Gave it a good flavor and was a nice compliment to the tilapia. Family really liked it.

It was a great new way to liven up tilapia and I liked that it required few ingredients. We made it with a little less soy because my family doesn't like too much salt.

This was so yummy we couldn't get enough of it!  I did bake it instead at 425 degrees for 12 minutes and broiled it until it was a little crispy for about 4 minutes. Also sprinkled a glaze of olive oil on top before broiling it.

Very easy and very delicious.  I used 2/3 cup bread crumbs and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese.
