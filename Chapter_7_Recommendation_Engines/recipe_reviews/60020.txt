This is a nice low fat recipe.  I used equal parts bread crumbs and oats and I think this would have been quite bland with just the oats, however the sauce is very yummy and you could serve it on plain turkey and it would be yummy regardless.  I think the dry mixture could use some work, but this is a good recipe to use as a start.

This was tasty. I used ground lean turkey formed into patties because my grocery store was out of turkey breasts. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, and these turned out very tasty. Pretty low in fat, but still satisfying. The sauce was yummy too, and I put it on the side for dipping. I'll make this again.

This was great!  Me and my boyfriend really loved it.  I changed the recipe a bit.  I substituted sour cream for yogurt and chicken breasts for turkey.  I also poured the mustard/milk mixture in the pan with the chicken while it cooked and it came out juicy and flavourful.  We had it over brown rice.  I will definitely make this one again.

Good but we thought the herbs were a little overpowering. 1/2 the amount called for would be better with perhaps a little garlic salt. I used 1/2 oats and 1/2 panko bread crumbs, which created a nice texture. I also let the turkey soak in the milk mixture for about 5 mins for added moisture. I didn't have yogurt so used sour cream thinned out with a little milk. The sauce was very tasty.

This was a good basic recipe, but like other reviewers I made modifications.  I used about half oatmeal and half Italian bread crumbs and added 1/4 c wheat germ.  I also  used 1/2 yogurt and 1/2 milk and the mustard.  To try to prevent the crumb topping from drying out I also spray the top of it with EVOO.  A great healthy dish!

Sooo good!! We espcially loved it with the sauce -- don't skip it or you'll miss out. I might use a little less of the sage/rosemary spice next time, but this was such a tasty, healthy recipe. I highly recommend it!

Very quick and easy to make and yet very yummy.  Was fabulous with fresh sage and rosemary.  I'm not a big mustard fan, but I really liked this ( I didn't use the yogurt-mustard seed dipping sauce, I used ranch dressing ).  I have made this at least once a week and sometimes use chicken instead of turkey.

I've made this a few times now and I've really enjoyed it.  The yogurt sauce is great and the turkey is interesting.

My husband enjoyed this. I used poultry seasoning instead of rosemary. I baked mine a little longer than the recipe called for to get it crispy.

Few tiny changes, but overall I really enjoyed this easy recipe! I pulverized the oats to help the breading stick a little better. I used savory instead of sage because I didn't have any sage. I put the spices in when I pulverized. I also sprinkled a little seasoned salt before baking. Didn't have whole grain mustard, so I used spicy brown mustard for both. Wonderful flavor; I will be making this again!

I thought this sounded tempting and healthy, so I gave it a try based on the good reviews. I'm so sorry I did. The breading was really bad, I had to scrape it off. The sauce was really good (2 stars for that)but I will never make turkey cutlets like this again.

The yogurt sauce is absolutely delicious. As is (as other reviewers have noted), it is very bland. I added more salt and spices to taste. It is utmost important to bake turkey straight on rack to avoid sogginess.

While I really like chicken and turkey, I find poultry rather tasteless and bland. It always needs a little help. With this recipe, I combined the yoghurt and a Chardonnay dijon (I amped up the mustard too) and used it to marinate the turkey breasts. I skipped the milk mixture. The oatmeal didn't sound all that appealing so I toast mine which gave it a bit of a nuttier taste. Another trick I used was to place the breasts on a rack in the oven so the oatmeal underneath didn't get mushy. I'm going to make this again and play around with the herbs and spices. This recipe definately has potential just needs a bit of a tweak.

This was okay. The turkey didn't get as much flavor as I was hoping for, even after I let it rest with the oat breading on it for a while.

We aren’t huge fans of sage or rosemary so I decided to use different herbs: thyme, oregano and garlic.  I also mixed bread crumbs in with the oats on the recommendation of other reviewers.  I also used half the spices called for because it sounded like A LOT to me, especially with the mustard.  It smelled amazing while it was baking (hence the 3 stars) but my fiancé and I agreed that it was still too much once we tried it.  The flavor was good but it was so overpowering and I wish I’d decreased it even more than I did.  I’m not sure I’d try this one again, sorry.

I was dissappointed with this recipe.  I figured it would be great with all the good reviews, but for me, the oats did nothing for the turkey and the herb combination just tasted like grass, even after I added salt.  My husband liked it a little, but agreed the oats were odd and added nothing to the recipe.

i didn't like this at all.  the dipping sauce was great but the turkey was rather tasteless considering all the spices etc. that are put on it.  it never reached 180 degrees on it's own (even within 40 minutes) so i had to cut it up into little pieces and cook it to get the pink out.  it was dry.

This was OK.  I didn't have sage, so I used Thyme and the oats were good, but I wasn't a fan of the Rosemary.  I forgot to use the sauce, and it's possible that would have made this better, but I probably won't make this again.

we (husband, 7-year-old, and i) didn't really care for this.  i tried the suggestions from other reviewers--used half panko and half oatmeal, halved the spices--but the breading still wasn't quite right.  i'm not sure what it was, but the flavors just didn't seem to work.  we didn't care for the sauce either; we thought it was a little too yogurt-y.

Unless you like throwing away food I wouldn't make this recipe.  I thought this would be a new way to cook turkey healthy.  I'm sure it is healthy but it is down right tasteless and dry.  In order to eat the turkey we had to scrape off the breading because it was dry and tasteless.  The sauce was good.  This is the one meal my husband has asked that I never repeat and he couldn't even eat a full cutlet.  Needless to say we threw all leftovers out.
