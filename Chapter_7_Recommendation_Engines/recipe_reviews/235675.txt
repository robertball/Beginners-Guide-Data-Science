I only had one banana, so I substituted with 1c apple sauce. I included oats and chocolate chips and they turned out great.  The whole waffle didn't hold together, but each I the quarters did.  Next time, though, I won't include choc. chips because it took 15-20 minutes to clean the melted chocolate off the waffle maker. I might also add walnuts next time.

Loved these. Made a couple of tweaks. Added cinnamon  and about 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder for  little more froth. I also didnt have peanut butter so added about 1 tbsp of coconut oil and a handful of peanuts.

Worked out great. Topped them with some fresh blueberries.

Wowww, these were really very good - especially the texture! I thought it'd be mush,  but they weren't overly soft at all and even had a fluff to them. We served them right away as they came out  and the whole batch was devoured by 3 hungry littles - so each ate a banana and 1.5 eggs, plus 1/3 cup oatmeal with a drizzle of real maple syrup. YES. Let the day begin! haha

I halved the recipe and it perfectly made one round of waffles in my waffle iron (Cuisinart 4 square waffle) I added the oats and chocolate chips as suggested and they turned out great! just sweet enough and the oats added a nice texture. They held together as well as any traditional waffle recipe I have made. We will definitely make these again.

I used non stick spray in my waffle Iron. Batter is seriously stuck going to have to soak. I tried to make these for my hubby's birthday breakfast. They worked as pancakes. The flavour was great.

Followed the recipe did not put in the optional chocolate chips but instead put Nutella on top and whipping cream and raspberries. Excellent taste. Perfect for gluten free.

These were tasty and I appreciated the simple ingredients and the fact that there's no sugar added, yet the bananas give them a gentle sweetness. Mine didn't hold together particularly well, but I did use some extra banana and didn't have cooking spray on hand so I greased the waffle iron with oil on a pice of paper towel. Both factors could have contributed to the crumbliness.  I may or may not try making them again, but it was a fun kitchen adventure!
