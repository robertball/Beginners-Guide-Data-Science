Excellent recipe!  I used 1% milk and fat free chicken broth and you would never know it.  The spices and peppers add a lot to this recipe.

This was a delicious chowder recipe.  Very easy to prepare & the seasonings spiced it up delightfully.  I did not use the jalepeno pepper and it was still great.

EXCELLENT recipe!  I didn't have green peppers on hand so I used sweet red peppers, and I used a little extra red pepper flakes because I didn't have any jalapeno.  I used non-stick spray instead of butter, and used 1% lowfat milk.  Came out absolutely terrific.  Dried chives also work if you don't have fresh green onions onhand.  My husband loves this recipe every time and it's so easy to make!!

Wow!  This soup is delicious and healthy!  I made it with skim milk, so the only fat in it was from the 2 Tbsp. of butter.  You couldn't tell at all that it was low fat!  Amazing!  Will definitely be making this again...

One warning, though, if you're concerned about this recipe being too spicy: you might want to cut down on the jalapeno.  We liked it this way, but it definitely has a zing to it!

This chowder is a breeze to make with very good results! I did add some red bell pepper for more color and used a can of drained green chiles instead of jalapenos. My boyfriend really enjoyed this mildly heated soup. Thanks T.O.H.!

I thought this chowder was really good.  My husband is not a fan of spicy hot foods so I omitted the Jalepeno from the recipe.  It turned out great.  I will make it again, and I recommend you try it.

Great recipe!  The only thing I changed was adding a few roasted green chili peppers instead of the jalapeno, also added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, just because I love garlic.

My family and I love corn chowder, and this is the best we've ever eaten.  It's so easy and tastes great hot on a cold winter day, or cool for a rainy summer one.

I thought this recipe needed a little extra flavor. I added more paprika, salt and black pepper. I also added about a quarter cup of heavy cream to make it creamier and finally I added a half cup of sharp cheddar cheese. I was happy with the finished results and my husband told me to make it again with the changes I made.

This turned out very tasty, even though I had to revise it somewhat, since my family finds jalapeno peppers too hot.  I subbed an Anaheim, so I doubled the paprika and red pepper flakes.  Also increased the Dijon mustard by 1/2 and added a few drops of hot pepper sauce.  It only needed 1/4 tsp. salt, and I only used 1/2 the required flour.  One note, though--it does look kind of yucky on reheating, as it curdles.  Perhaps that was because I used 2% milk??  All things considered, this was DELICIOUS.  Do try it.

I liked this recipe but found there was too much flour for my tastes, I could taste the flour when eating the soup.  Next time I would use a little less and maybe add some creamed corn.  However it was a good starting point, I'll make it again.

Very good recipe.  I make it a couple of times a year most notably for our New Year's Eve gatherings.  The pot is always scraped clean.  I do change this a little by adding more potato and I use sweet white frozen corn.  I also add just a little bit more red pepper flakes.  It gives it a sweet yet spicy kick.

I have perfected my version of this recipe now. I use double the red potatoes with the skin still on them, an extra cup of frozen corn, extra diced red peppers, twice the jalapeno peppers, a serrano pepper, and at the end while it's still simmering, I mix two tablespoons of butter with a 1/4 cup flour and a drop of heavy whipping cream. I blend it carefully and add it slowly to the simmering mix. It thickens the mixture  just enough to keep it chowder-like, and not soup-like. This is always a major, major hit. I've also sauteed garlic, onions, and boneless, skinless chicken and diced it into the mixture. Very filling!

This was way more bland than I anticipated.  I used heavy cream instead of milk, added bacon pieces and more paprika.  It turned out a bit better after that but I most likely will not be making this again.

This was SO bland. I kept adding salt!! The only change I made was to include a bag of small cooked shrimp, which was the saving grace of this chowder. I think maybe some hot sauce will improve the flavor. The texture was excellent.

Quick and tasty on a chilly fall night.  I've been waiting to make this all summer and now with fall finally here, we did and liked it a lot.  I would serve it with a nice side salad and some garlic and cheese biscuits.

This is a great recipe!  Its now my favorite corn chowder.  It has a lot of flavor and is a great consistency.  I didn't realize that I didn't have the green pepper or jalapeno to use but the chowder was still very tasty.  I added extra crushed red pepper to make up for the jalapeno.  I can't wait to go home and have some for lunch.

A-mazing!  Lots of zip!  Best corn chowder I have ever made.  Should have doubled the recipie.  I used baby red potatoes and left the skin on, this created a nice coloe contrast.
