Normally, I don't give 5 stars to recipes that I tweak. However, this was so well-received it warrants an exception. I added about a 1/4 cup of cream and doubled the cornstarch (no arrowroot) to thicken it up a bit. Served over chopped steak and smashed 'taters. This was SO good that my mother's husband, who is on hospice care and has zero appetite, cleaned his plate. The man is also a VERY critical foodie. He now says that I'm an excellent cook. Thank you, Jimmi. You made my dinner!

Excellent and easy!  Great way to impress company. Subbed 2x corn starch for Arrowroot since I had none.  Worked GREAT.

I went searching for a sauteed mushroom recipe, and this is the one I decided to use.  We cooked steaks and chicken on the grill, and it all went perfectly together.  The shrooms were absolutely awesome.  Will definitely use again and again.  Next time I may use a little less  broth because there was so much broth left over and not many shrooms.

This sauce is great.  I also exchanged chicken broth for the beef broth, and white wine.  I served it with roasted chicken.  It was really easy (I bought the chicken already roasted, and ready to go).  It turned a simple dish into a great company or Sunday dinner.  This recipe will stay in my box.

I had mushrooms to use and was making pork and sauerkraut for New Years Day dinner so I made this to go on the pork roast.  I changed it up by using white wine instead of red, chicken broth instead of beef, garlic instead of scallions and cornstarch instead of arrowroot.  The sauce is fantastic.  My DH practically licked the pan clean!  I will be making this again, as written, for a beef dinner sometime soon!

This sauce was excellent!  I made it just how it was written (well almost, used corn starch, didn't have arrowroot)  and served it with beef tenderloin for Christmas dinner.  It tasted like it was from a restaurant. Heated it up the next day with left overs and it was just as good. It was perfect!  This recipe will be my new tradition!

Very good! I used about 2 tbsp. of olive oil instead of all of the butter. I also used some chicken soup mix with water instead of the beef broth.

This was good but not great... will keep tweaking. I had no arrowroot so subbed tapioca. Also added tarragon, parsley, and basil to give it a little more depth. Will make again.

Perfect sauce to combine with egg noodles and meatballs.  I had left-over grilled hamburger patties that I cut into cubes and re-heated in with this sauce.  It was delicious.

So much flavor!  I cut it back and just eyeballed ingredients so I don't think mine was as "saucy" as it was supposed to be, but man was it good!  I used fresh thyme cause that's what I like and used cornstarch instead of arrowroot cause that's what I had ;)  Nice recipe!

This sauce is DELICIOUS!  I consider myself a pretty good cook, and this sauce made me feel like a pro!  I grilled steaks and smothered this all over them and our plates were so clean when were were done eating we could have put them back in the cabinet : )

I was looking for something to fancy-up our steaks on New Years Eve and this was perfect.  I was worried it would be too gravy like, but it wasn't at all.  I also substituted onions & garlic for the shallots and used corn starch instead of the arrowroot.

Good mushroom sauce to use however you want. I don't do the beef...so chicken broth and white wine sub just fine. Put in a little roasted Jalapeno for a touch of heat. Used Shitake, Cremini and white Button mushrooms. Added diced garlic as well. Then I dumped a bag of TJ's Turkey Meatballs in for protein. I happened to have gotten some Arrowroot from World Spice in Seattle...it worked great, but probably no different than corn starch. I added some broccoli florets for color and nutrition. I think I'm going to use the sauce as a base for pizza and the meatballs, possibly thick sliced topped w/ cheese. Might gut some of the bread of a TJ's Pretzel Bread loaf and put sauce and mballs inside? Who knows.

This is a elegant, flavorful sauce. I used olive oil instead of butter, chicken broth instead of beef, and cornstarch instead of arrowroot powder. It didn't thicken quite as much as I'd hoped, but it was fabulous over liver crepes.

Sauce was so good that I think I could have drank it.  It was definitely a step up from simple sauteed mushrooms and onions.  I made a roux by adding flour to the onions and butter instead of using arrowroot or cornstarch.  I also used a rustic herb mix that was mainly rosemary, thyme and garlic in place of  just rosemary.

Was looking for a sauce similiar in taste to my Mom's Bordelaise sauce; this one worked out well. I did add whole cloves and peppercorns in addition to the other herbs to make it taste more like my Mom's. As many others had said they didn't have arrowroot to thicken their sauces, I hate to admit I didn't have it either; I used cornstarch instead. I finished it with a splash of tarragon vinegar for brightness/freshness. The sauce hit the spot, thank you Jimmi for sharing!

This sauce is awesome -- you'll impress your dinner guests!  I served it over roasted pork loin - yum!  I chopped the mushrooms after sauteeing them.  I used cornstarch instead of arrowroot powder & it thickened fine.

I followed the recipe to a T except that I used cornstarch as opposed to arrow root. It took a while to thicken, and I became a bit nervous at first. I used a decent Chianti wine and Swansons beef broth. I have made many a gravy and Italian sauce from scratch, but this  my first mushroom. It turned out terrific as promised! I served it with thick center cut pork chops that I had fried lightly in flour and a few spices, along with mashed potatoes and green beans. It added a touch of elegance to the meal and my family loved it. Next time I will sautee a few minced garlic cloves along with the shallots to add even mire depth to the flavor.

This is a wonderful recipe that is always well-received. We don't eat beef, so I substitute with chicken broth (and I omit the red wine, when preparing for kids, as they seem to prefer the taste) and add some cream. It's a really versatile sauce and I use it on all sorts of things. As a gravy substitute or with mashed potatoes or with pasta (I use corn flour instead of arrow root to thicken the sauce further and add a dash of cream).  I sometimes pour it over cooked pasta, top with 1 1/2 cups of grated cheddar + mozzarella and pop it in the oven for about 15 minutes on high heat (a huge success with the kids).  Do give it a try

We used diced onion and garlic instead of shallots and also substituted cornstarch for arrowroot. We used cremini mushrooms. It was a well balanced sauce.

This really does make a fantastic sauce. I used it during the holidays with a tenderloin - froze the leftovers and had it with chopped steak.  Both times, I caught my 92-yr-old grandma (a tough food critic) wiping the last of it off her plate with her finger.   This is definitely a keeper!

Served over sirloin beef tips -- Yummy! and I'm not even a fan of mushrooms.  Made it and even my 2 yr old toddler (who eats nothing more than plain pasta most days) loved it.  I used cornstarch in place of the arrowroot powder and just sprinkled enough until it got to the consistency I wanted.  Remember, the sauce does thicken upon standing.

Just wanted to try something different.  This was a thin sauce, not bad, but nothing special. I prefer A-1 steak sauce (guests did too).  If you grill a good steak, it really doesn't need to be hidden under a sauce like this.

I used this to make mushroom stuffed pork chops. I made this with a medley of mushrooms, switched to white wine to go with the pork and added 1 clove minced garlic.  Fantastic.

Delicious! If you want to make the sauce lower in fat, only use a bit of butter or olive oil and cook the mushrooms and scallions in water. It works well.

Very good... I'll probably never use steak sauce again. This really does taste like something you would get at a nice restaurant. My only change was to use cornstarch instead of the arrowroot (what is that anyways?). Very tasty and not very difficult to make either.

Not sure if I really made this recipe but it came out great. I used margerine, white wine, green onions, chicken broth, and cornstarch. Must be the method and spices that give it that restaurant sauce flavor. Directions are a bit confusing. Note there are sliced mushrooms AND chopped mushrooms. My sauce was a little pale so I added a dash of browning sauce (Kitchen Bouquet) for color. Hubby was expecting it to be gravy though. Very gourmet tasting and not too overpowering to mask an expensive cut of beef.

Excellent recipe!  I received tons of compliments on it.  The only thing I changed was using cornstarch instead of arrowroot powder. Tastes even better the next day with leftovers!

Absolutely delicious! It had so many layered flavors that were unexpected. I didn’t use arrowroot, but it wasn’t missed. I also thickened a bit with corn starch. Excellent!!

I ended up not having enough broth, so I used a combination of drippings from some beef and some mushroom gravy, but it went fantastically, there were no leftovers from dinner.

This is a good recipe to add a little some extra to any meat. I typically don’t use anywhere close to all the butter it calls for and I feel like the flavor is still great. I substitute garlic for shallots if I don’t have any on hand and usually add onions. Very handy recipe to have in my favorites!

Great sauce! It's very versatile, and can go with many different dishes...steak, chicken, rice, pasta, potatoes. It's definitely not overpowering, like a gravy, but is very light and complimentary.

I didn't have wine on hand, and added a large clove of chopped garlic to the scallions...it was wonderful! I'll definitely make it again "by the book " after I get to the liquor store.

We loved it. I used garlic rather than shallots. I added a little Parmesan and Feta cheese. I used Chicken broth instead of beef and poured this stuff over chicken breasts I'd cooked in a pan with olive oil.

Have made this twice now - it is terrific.  Next time I might add some red wine . . . - this is so simple and could easily become one of my 'kitchen sink' go-to's.  You know - when you have a little of this and that, but not enough for much - toss together, saute with olive oil and garlic, maybe some ginger and serve with  - well, pork chop, hamburger, steak, lamb chops - sausages, chicken breasts - even tofu would work well.  Versatile and well received by my guests.  Thanks!

This is a really good recipe mushrooms had a great taste. I thought there was too much thyme due to the texture and I used 3/4 tsp. I cut the broth in half and used 1 tsp of cornstarch, it made a perfectly thick sauce.

Use half sliced mushrooms and half shitake. I chopped them fine because I don't love chunks of mushroom. My grocery store didn't have arrowroot power so I substituted cornstarch ( Google the amount; it's alot). Absolutely delicious!! We used it to top homemade tourtiere Christmas Eve and it will be an annual tradition now because everyone loved it!

WOW, this was fantastic! I married a man who won't eat mushrooms. In fact, he caught me stirring my mushrooms with the same spoon as a dish for him and had a fit! This is a wonderful solution. I can have my mushrooms without "contaminating" his food. I made this recipe exactly as written, except I halved it. The combination of flavors is magnificent. This is company worthy and I'm already planning to include it in my next dinner party menu.

Excellent sauce! I used corn starch instead and thickened it to my taste.  I tripled the recipe but kept the the beef broth to 2 cups. I also didn't bother with reserving any mushrooms, instead I added the onions to the butter first until translucent, then added all the mushrooms until tender, and then the wine etc.  I served it over grilled pork chops and accompanied it with Grandma Jeanette's Amazing German Red Cabbage on this site. YUM!!!

This was really tasty. I modified it all little bit; I added habenero for a bit of a kick, and threw in some dill and caraway seeds, too. I used onion instead of shallots, since I had it on hand. Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely adore this recipe.  Although I didn't have the arrowroot it was still delicious.  I used it over white rice and now I want seconds!

This was really good.  I didn't have shallots or arrowroot, so I substituted cornstarch, and it was still yummy! I am vegetarian, so I also substituted vegetable broth instead of beef broth and just served it over quinoa.  I will have to try it again with the shallots, and I'll probably try adding some other veggies as well to round it out to a full meal.

Delicious.  I made it exactly as directed except for the shallots.  I didn't have one so I used 2 parts onion to one part garlic.  This tasted delicious.  I will definitely make it again.

This is so delicious. I subbed 2 TB cornstarch for arrowroot, and onions for shallots since that's what I had. I used a few more mushrooms than called for. So easy, I don't know why we don't make sauces like this more often! Served over minute steaks and whole wheat gnocchi - perfect meal.

This is a wonderful sauce.  I made it exactly as written, served it over rib eye steaks, and my husband and I licked our plate clean.  We used about half of it with the steak and potatoes, so the next day I put the remainder in a sauce pan, stirred in another cup of beef broth and brought it to a simmer.  Then I added about a half cup of sour cream, stirred it in, and served it as soup.  That too was wonderful. The only substitution I made in the original recipe as that I used cornstarch rather than arrowroot (not a staple in my kitchen).  When I make it again I'll use a big more, as we would have liked it a bit thicker.  I'll have to see how well this freezes. I'd love to make up batches of it, freeze it, and have it ready ahead of time.

this was very good but time consuming since we decided to reduce it naturally instead of adding more and more cornstarch (never heard of arrowroot before).. yes this IS a recipe for mushroom SAUCE, but we wanted something more like a gravy to top over Chef John's Perfect Mashed Potatoes and some chicken breasts that i pan fried for dinner.. bf says this is like mushroom gravy and coq au vin had a child.. ty for the recipe

I love this sauce!  I make it for Thanksgiving as a vegetarian substitute for gravy.  I use Cornstarch instead of arrowroot, add about a cup more chopped mushrooms, and I and if I want to make it vegan I use olive oil instead of butter. I vary the kinds of mushrooms I use (usually portobellas, regular white mushrooms, and some shitakes) I make also put it over pasta at home for a delicious simple meal.

I wanted to make some mushrooms to go over grilled steaks and I gave this recipe a try.  I replaced the shallots with sliced onions and used cornstarch to thicken it.  My husband loved it! This would go great over chicken too.

Very good.  I used baby bellas and sweet onion for the shallots.  I did not have beef broth, so I used chicken and a bit gravy browner.  Very tasty with roast lamb.

Made this recipe for New Years Dinner, along with filet mignon.  My guest raved about it, had to give recipe to several of them.  Since we all like more a thinner texture, I didn't add the arrowroot or any corn starch.  It's a keeper and cannot wait to make again!

Loved this!  I usually serve beef tenderloin with a port/shallot/bacon reduction, but this is equally as good!!

The only thing I changed was corn starch for the arrowroot. If everyone loves mushrooms, this serves only four people.

I served this sauce on a phyllo sausage appetizer and it got rave reviews. Everyone wanted the recipe. I will definitely be using this again.
