Really easy to make!!!  I get why dried beef is so expensive now...this was not a cheap build but the best jerky I've ever had.  One pound of London broil (cut while still partially frozen to make it easier to make thin slices) made 6 ounces of jerky but wow, it's great!  And so easy to make!

Oh goodness. This was soo good. Didn't change anything the first time, except I had a 3lb eye of round. This was more than enough marinade for 3lbs of meat. The second time, I added 2 homegrown jalapeños, which added a nice, but not overpowering, kick.
 Instead of doing this on a cookie sheet and wire rack, which is awful to clean, you can hang the pieces with toothpicks or bamboo skewers from the top oven rack. Be sure to line the bottom oven rack with aluminum foil to catch drips. Make sure none of the meat is touching other pieces or folded on itself, it wont dry with the rest. And wedging the oven door open with a wooden spoon helps with drying time.

I made this but with no seasoning because I made it for my dogs! It came out great. My dogs love it and I know it won't harm them. I now make a batch every 3 weeks for them. Happy dogs and happy mom!!!!

This was my first time making jerky.  It was so easy!  I had my butcher cut the meat and I used 3 lbs of London Broil - so I increased the marinade recipe by 50%.  I used low-sodium soy (instead of reg soy) and dark brown sugar (instead of honey), added 1/2 Tbls of ground cumin, 1/2 Tbls ground Cardamom, 1/2 tspn ground clove and 1/2 tspn Cayenne powder.  My family really enjoyed this jerky!  I will NEVER buy commercial jerky again!  The taste of homemade jerky is so much better (and without all the unhealthy additives that often goes into commercial jerky)!  I will be making this many times, as we enjoy jerky a lot! ~ OH, I cut up some into tiny pieces for doggie treats .. my two dogs love 'em, too!  (there's nothing harmful to dogs in them, so why not share with them?).

Recipe is excellent and very easy.  I made two batches, the first I baked per the recipe at 175 degrees for 3 1/2 hours.  For the second batch I baked it using the convection function on the oven and it was ready after about two hours, cutting 1 to 1 1/2 hours off the cooking time.  They were equally delicious and could not tell the difference between the batches.  The jerky was actually better two days later!

I made this with a frozen venison roast. I soaked the  venison in salted water for three days in the refrigerator to draw out any blood changing the salt water every day until it came out almost perfectly clear. I Patted the meat dry and put in the freezer for about one hour to make it easier to thinly slice.
Then I followed the exact recipe as with beef only using a dehydrator instead of the oven.  The jerky came out perfectly!

I made this with bottom round and it turned out fantastic. I've had some pretty good store bought jerky and this recipe is right up there with the best of them. The only difference is the price.  This jerky is much more affordable.  Thanks chef John for sharing!

No recipe is going to make everyone happy, but this was close. I thought it had too much of something, perhaps worstershire sauce. We used Tamari sauce, which is a low sodium soy and will cut down on the salty flavor. Next time I may have the butcher slice it, but you can do it at home with a sharp knife. The whole process was much easier than I thought it would be and we will be making this again.

Worcestershire sauce was a little strong but a great tasting jerky. Placed in freezer 2 hours before slicing by hand, against the grain . turned out to be the most tender jerky i've eaten.  I'm 64 and have ate a lot of jerky in my time.  by the way subbed 2 tablespoons of cane sugar for the honey.

Our adult kids were home for Christmas and it was gone before I knew it! Now they are asking me to send them some. I'd  say that was a hit ?  Putting more in the dehydrator today, just had to come review time & temp. Thank you Chef John!

I've made this a few times now.  Key to your success...

There's an excellent tip to partially freeze the beef prior to cutting, I left mine in freezer for almost 2 hours, which allowed for very thin slices. Thin sliced beef cannot be overstated as allows better saturation of seasoning, and ultimately leads to better flavour.

Cutting beef with the grain yields chewier texture more like "store bought" vs across the grain, which is good for the denture wearing folks!

Amazing! My husband has been wanting home made beef jerky for several months. We saw the video on how to make this one evening while watching youtube, and when I saw how easy it was, I just had to try.  The flavor is awesome! It took a while for the meat to dry out in my oven (closer to 8 hours, meat was cut in long strips 1/2" by 3/4", which probably accounts for the long drying time). I made this recipe at the same time as a recipe from another site, and this one is FAR superior. I will definitely be making this again and adapting the ingredients to our tastes. 10/10 recommend

This was a great base recipe for us but we made a few tweaks which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. We reduced the Worcestershire to 1/2 C. and added 2 Tbsp. more of brown sugar and also added Texas Pete to preference (maybe 2-3 Tbsp). We also used a dehydrator at 160 for about 10 hours after marinating over night. It turned out beautifully! We eat a lot of jerky so this may become a regular!

My husband and I made this last night.  Yum!!  We did use Bragg's Liquid Aminos instead of soy sauce and used raw honey.  We also added cayenne pepper for more heat.  We did ours in our dehydrator instead of the oven.  This is a great recipe.  We are into health and fitness and we love beef jerky but the kind you buy in the store has so many preservatives and junk added to it.  This was the perfect recipe for us to use to have a healthy snack with lots of protein.  Thanks for submitting the recipe.  We will probably be making this every week.

I was a little more generous with the honey, but it's a great recipe. Add a little steak sauce for an extra kick.

I made this jerky in the past and then lost the recipe. I loved it when I made it previously and have been a little disappointed in other recipes I've tried since even though they were all good, just not what I was looking for. This is by far the best jerky recipe I've found. The only thing I change in my preparation is that I cut the meat uniformly in 1/4" strips and after marinating, I dry them in my smoker which is set at 175 degrees. I also add some cherry wood or mesquite smoke during the first hour of drying. The end product keeps very well on the shelf. I have a hiking partner that had some in their hiking gear that was nearly a year old and they were still eating it and raving about the good flavor, (although I wouldn't advise keeping that long). My problem is it gets eaten up in our house faster than I can make it.

Love this recipe! I've made it a couple times now. First time I made half of it in the oven half of it in my food dehydrator. I do like the oven a little bit better. But I found that doing the dehydrator is just a little easier to clean up by lining the bottom of my dehydrator with foil and since the racks are plastic I can just throw them in the sink and little water for easy cleanup. Other than that, recipe wise, I don't change a thing!  I put some in the refrigerator for snacking for a couple weeks. And I also put some in food saver bags in the freezer, for later use.

This jerky was only ok.  I made the recipe with no modifications.  worcestershire is overpowering.  If I were to make again I would drastically reduce the amount of Worcestershire sauce, unless you really love the stuff.  It's gonna be a bit hard to eat all this jerky when it tastes like Worcestershire.

I've tried a few of the recipes on this site and this is my favorite. I do replace the honey with a 1/8 cup of brown sugar (not packed). As far as marinade times I usually do a full 18 to 24 hrs, I've read that it doesn't make a difference if you marinade for 3 hrs or 23 hrs but that hasn't been my experience. A full day is best. Also, I know this can be tough but if you can wait another 24 to 48 hrs before eating your jerky the flavor is significantly better. I have no idea why. I usually split the recipe and eat half right away and store the other half for  a minimum of 2 days. One last thing, I find the 170 temp to be a bit high but since modern ovens can't go below 170 I leave the door open about a half inch. It allows the heat flow out so oven remains on most of the time instead of the oven turning off and on continuously. This way there is a continuous flow of heat passing the meat.

I've tried this recipe two times now and absolutely love the jerky;  family, friends and co-workers all feel the same.  I did make a few minor tweaks though. First, I'm not a big fan of honey so the 2nd time around I substituted brown sugar and on both batches I used ghost pepper flakes instead of red pepper (I prefer jerky to have a bit of "heat"). Lastly I used a dehydrator instead of the oven to dry it; having ten drying racks comes in particularly handy when making 3 to 4 pound batches.  Again I can't say enough great things about this recipe, extremely easy to make with outstanding results.

This probably one of the worst jerky recipes I have made.  There is way too much worcesteshire sauce.  I love the umami of worcesteshire but it was overwhelmiing.  I make jerky twice a month to get the added protein in.

I followed the recipe, but next time I think I'll increase the amount of hot spices to the recipe.  I will make again, we all need to find our perfect taste buds recipe.  :)

I can't believe I waited this long to make beef jerky, this recipe is exactly what I was looking for!!! The only changes I made were: I used a dehydrator for a few hours, I didn't have any onion powder or chili flakes which was fine because the pepper made it the perfect spiced flavor. I will definitely make this again!

My first attempt at beef jerky.  It was awesome.  We liked it better than the jerky we get at the local meat shop for $36/lb

Looking for a snack/meal that stays well on multi day hiking trips I always found beef jerky to be the best. Just the prices here in the local stores are rediculous with $120/kg so I finally made one my own. 
Had to change the onion powder with a grinded onion and made a little less marinade for a little more meet due to the packing volumes sold here, and after 4 hours at 60C in the oven I entered heaven. So much better for so much less!

I am now prepairing another batch which I will put in the low temperature smoker (max 35C) on pearwood on the first winter day of the season. 

Whiskey and sigar ready!

I am not a beef jerky eater;  I just do not like it!  But after I made this recipe, I LOVE IT!  And my family (who are all big jerky fans) absolutely loves it!  They like it better than any commercial jerky and ask for it all the  time.  The pepper flakes give it just that perfect little kick.  Fantastic recipe, don't have to change a thing!

Great recipe!  I made this  last weekend and have not been able to stop eating this jerky.  It has a nice bite to it with a little bit of heat on the back end (I added Chef John's 'signature' pinch of cayenne to the marinade).  Perfection!  I will definitely make this again!!!

I wasn't thrilled with the seasoning. I marinated overnight and the worchestershire was overpowering . It was good, just a little strong on the flavoring for my taste.

My husband and I made this jerky and I could eat it like candy! We added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes for a little more heat. We also marinated in a bowl instead of a ziploc bag. Sliced about 1/8" thick, against the grain. Placed in a basic, single temp dehydrator for 5 hours (will try 4.5 hrs next time). Came out crispy yet chewy. So good!

Made 3 times.  First time with meat chunks it was great.  Then twice with ground meat and it was OK.  I suggest using this recipe with strips of meat and not ground.

My family loves it. I like the Worcestershire sauce in it. I reduced it on the second batch and added more chili peppers and honey. My first batch lasted 2 days. I’m hiding it this time!

I marinated this in the fridge overnight, as the recipe is written.  I did not like the flavour.  It was too strong of soy sauce and Worcestershire.  I would recommend trying a shorter marinating time if you are going to try it.  But I’ll move on to a new recipe.

It taste good. Had to omit the Worcestershire sauce cause I didn't have any. I got it cut by the butcher. Only it took forever to dry out to the consistency I wanted/needed.  It seems more chewy texture but a tough chewy. After about 7 hrs. I turned up to 200 after the five.

Like it a little sweeter so I added about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, more honey and some ginger powder and fresh ground ginger. Also added about 6oz of Dr Pepper. This was a great base to start with though.

We love it! I didn't make any changes and I will definitely make it again. The only drawback was that I think it would have dried a little harder if on the racks, which I didn't have. But it still came out fabulous!

This had great flavor, I had to adjust my cook time some since I made it in my air fryer with a dehydrated feature.  I cooked it for about an hour and a half instead of the three hours. It turned out great and I will definitely make it again

I've made this recipe with small changes here and there quite a few times now. It comes out very tasty and is very easy to do. The best results I've had so far is marinating it overnight in a round bowl so everything is covered (shallower dishes sometimes left some pieces barely touching the marinade) and then dehydrating for 6h or so. I also added in fresh garlic to the marinade instead of the powder simply because I don't have it around but it gave it worked nicely.

Great base for great jerky. I added 1/2tbs liquid smoke and a whole jalepeno rough chopped instead of the red pepper flakes. Had it marinating overnight. Got my butcher to slice the meat for me, on the thinner side. It took about 3.5 hours to be done. Turned out awesome and had a great salt level.

Awesome!! This was my first time making jerky and it turned out perfect!  I let it sit in the marinade for 24 hours, mixing after about 12 hours.  It has so much flavor without being over powering!

We bought a dehydrator. We love  jerky but it's so expensive! This came out amazing! I only had regular paprika so I added 1 teas liquid smoke. I also marinated overnight. We bought round pre-sliced, about 1/4". Too thick for us. I want it thinner like Chef John's.  We're gonna wait until round goes on sale and have the butcher slice it. Thus marinade is so good! Will definitely make again, it was so easy!

My husband loves beef jerky.  We usually buy it at the store, but I've made this batch a few times now.  He's spoiled and doesn't want the store bought stuff anymore.  I do use a dehydrator because we have one, but otherwise, I do the recipe exactly as written.

I made this yesterday and it was fantastic! Not too salty, not too dry, not too chewy, just right. My local store calls Top Round “London Broil” and the butcher knew just what to do. I set my oven to Convection, so I didn’t have to open the oven like Chef John did. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I’ll be making this again. Thanks for this recipe!

I follow this recipe exactly using my my Weston 10-tray dehydrator set at 155 degrees. After 4.5 hrs it was perfect.  I let the meat marinade for 12 hours in the fridge.   I found the Worcestershire to be a dominating flavor. Next time I would use less Worcestershire and double up the honey and pepper flakes for more kick.

We tried this recipe and it was very good. We do it pretty similar, just with less salt. Either way, its a great recipe.

Thank you

This is my first attempt at making beef jerky and the recipe made me look like a pro! 
My husband and I both love the flavor of the jerky.
I followed the recipe exactly and there's nothing I would do differently except maybe make a double batch. Will definitely make this again and again and again!

Not sure why but mine took much longer to dry out than in the instructions.  I added some of my own ingredients for a little different flavor but this is a good base.

Yum, yum, yum...this was easy and super tasty. I marinated for four hours and thought the flavors could have been more intense, but still super. I couldn’t get that lovely, mahogany shine that Chef John had...I would submit a picture but all of the jerky is gone now. I will definitely make again.

Having made salty jerky before, I substituted soy sauce for low sodium soy sauce, making this a perfect recipe! Right amount of sweetness, and the savory flavor of Worcestershire sauce made perfect jerky

Making my second batch today! First batch, I followed to the letter, but this time, ive added some curry powder and I'm gonna play with the timing a bit. I never got it quite as leathery as I wanted, but that's more on me than the recipe. This is just like my grandma's jerky and it's going to be a great get this year at Christmas. I already know it. Thank you, Chef!

Oh GOOD Lord, this is a fabulous recipe!   I have tried a number of jerky recipes over the years and this one is easily  one of the best. Top three, hands down!  The only change I would make, for personal reasons, is half the red pepper flakes. Other than that this recipe is on the Money!

Great recipe my only change was that I used my dehydrator! Still came out great!! Love this recipe and the family agrees! We make a large batch fairly regularly, but I also put back a lot with my Food Saver Vacuum machine! It stays fresh literally for up to 5 years! I bet longer, but that is as long as we have kept it!

Phenomenal recipe.  I couldn’t stop eating it!  It was fresh, tender, hearty, and had the right amount of heat with a hint of sweetness.  I used low sodium soy sauce and marinated in a ziplock bag.  Next time, I will reduce the Worcestershire sauce a bit.

Made it exactly as is and so delicious! The only downside is my guy and daughter devoured it all and it was supposed to last a few days!! That means though this tastes amazing. Now I have to make again~

It was okay, but it is best to note that most food dehydrators only go up to 160 degrees and putting your oven to 175 will cook the meat. You don't want to "cook" it. You want to dehydrated it.  So set your oven to 160.  Also, I find that a 1:1 ratio with the Soy and Worcestershire Sauce is over powering. Try 2 parts Soy and 1 part Worcestershire.

Followed the recipe, so easy and came out perfect! Just a little heat with half teaspoon of cayenne, half teaspoon  of red pepper flakes. Made with London broil.

Definitely delicious. The only thing I changed was I used lemon juice instead of honey and added a splash of water to mellow out the sodium from the soy sauce and it worked out amazing.

I added 1 tbs cayenne to the marinade recipe upping the heat level. Also, I created the jerky on my Treager using the smoke setting.  It may be the best jerky I’ve had..I shared with friends and family and all loved it-I had no complaints of being to hot however I will cut cayenne back to 1/2 tbs next batch. Highly recommend.

My local meat cutter sliced my order, I followed recipe exactly and the jerky turned out superbly! Will be making more very soon. Only takes an hour and a half in our convection oven.

I followed the recipe and since I like spicy jerky, I added some cayenne pepper (about 1/2 tsp) and sliced jalapenos to the marinade. I marinaded the meat for 3 hours and used my food dehydrated instead of baking it. Before putting in the dehydrator, I added more red pepper flakes to some and fresh cracked pepper to others --we're all about spicy  here. This was my first go on beef jerky and it turned out incredible. My entire family loved it. I'm making my second batch tonight. This time I added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper and several dashes of Tabasco sauce. I plan on added the pepper flakes and black pepper again, too. 
I'm not a big fan of that smoked flavor, but the smoked paprika added just enough flavor and wasn't overpowering at all. All in all, this was a delicious marinade that I plan on using it as my go-to for jerky.

What an odd way this recipe found me. I always love Chef John's recipes, so they catch my eye first. Long story short, I bought this big piece of top round beef on a BIG sale. I logged on here to find a way to fix the darned thing that wouldn't be tough as nails. This recipe was immediately at the top of my page when I logged in. Since my husband is on a low carb diet, and constantly complains he "just wants to chew something with big flavor", I thought this woudl be perfect. It's VERY good, and foolproof. I only had about 3Tblsp Woosh left in my bottle, and so used same amount soy sauce to control the salt, and  it was fine. Marinated beef in a ziplock bag overnight, drained and squeezed meat dry in bag, then spread out on paper towels and really dried it. Baked for 4 hours at 175 and *presto*--husband said it was excellent. That will keep him chewing for awhile with incredibly low carbs/lots of protein. Thanks, Chef John !

I made this recipe a few days ago, tasted pretty darn good. so I decided last night to try it again, I added a couple extra things as follows brown sugar Cajun seasoning, I omitted the soy sauce primarily because the is enough salt in the Brine i soak in over night and added Sesame Ginger Teriyaki Marinade. I only gave it a 4 because I ran out of beer waiting for it to get done.

Made as is. Used my NuWave to dehydrate which worked great. This cut of meat had to be hand trimmed by the butcher so it was  thicker than I would have liked. My son loves it too, so it's a keeper.

I made this today for Christmas gifts for my co-workers. The taste is fantastic. The only thing I changed was the amount of pepper flakes, I backed off some.  I made one misstep, I think I may have baked it too long.  It didn’t come out as pretty as Chef John’s, but I think my co-workers will love it. The downsize was trying to find a butcher to make the fine cuts. Ralph’s and Vons no longer slice meat thinly. I wound up having it done at Lazy Acres, but it was pricey!

This recipe is fantastic!! We used our dehydrator to make the jerky.

The biggest change we made was using a mallet to pound the meat. We believe that pounding. the meat cut down on the marinade time. We marinaded for approximately 3 hours. 

We also added a couple teaspoons of liquid smoke. 

Thank you Chef John.

This was my first time making jerky, I have now made several batches. I substituted Monks fruit for the honey to make it more keto friendly. Everybody absolutely loves it. I also add some liquid smoke 1 tablespoon. I use top round roast and slice it on the meat slicer, very quick and even slices, and tender. 3 1\2 hrs at 160 perfect!

Made true to recipe. Put on convection for first 11/2 hours and then regular oven for 1 hour. I think you have to judge the dryness of the beef to your liking.
Will make this again.
I used reduced salt soya sauce.

I can’t believe that I made homemade beef jerky.  I added a little Cajun seasoning, to spice it up.  I was worried it would be too spicy so I reduced the soy sauce just a little.  It was perfect and super easy. Great recipe- I will definitely do it again!

Wow! I took this out of dehydrator this morning and it is already down to just crumbs in the bag. I used stew meat that I sliced very thin. Next time I will slice a flank steak or eye of round. Looks like I will be making this often. Great idea to use for Christmas gifts. Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!!

This beef jerky was really good. I used some southwest sweet smoky seasoning  and added a lot of honey. Otherwise, followed the recipe. I do recommend having the butcher cut the meat if you can. The meat that I used had a lot of marbling and chunks of gristle making it hard to cut thin. In Chef John's video he suggests only marinating it for 3 hours which sound like a good idea. I marinated mine overnight and it turned black. I think if I had marinated less, it would have looked a lot more appetizing and it also takes less time.

The best thing about this recipe is that is a good base, and you can easily make changes to suit your taste. The first time I made it,  I stuck to the letter of the recipe. The second time,  I changed things to suit myself. I don't think the minimum of a 3 hour marinade is long enough, go with overnight. Otherwise it is very bland. I also wanted more of a contrast to the salty marinade than a little bit of honey. I added about 1/3 a cup of dark brown sugar to get more of a maple flavoring. It is so much cheaper to make than to buy, go for it, and have fun.

Making my own beef jerky was alot easier than I thought and it turned out delicious!  I got  a relatively inexpensive cut of beef ($3.00/lb), froze it for about an hour, sliced it thin, arranged it on a wire rack over a foil lined cookie sheet, sprinkled it with seasonings (I did not marinate but will try that - it really wasn't necessary) and put it in the oven at 170 for 5 hours.  That was it and now I have a week's worth of jerky for less than half of what I would have paid even at Costco!

I'm not sure yet how it will turn out.  Based on available ingredients here is what I did:
3/4 c. red wine vinegar
3/4 c. soy sauce
1 TBS, 1 tsp. regular paprika
1 TBS ground, black pepper
1 tsp red pepper flakes
1 tsp thyme
2 tsp onion powder
3 lbs beef

I made this recipe as written and used thicker cuts of meat. I used my dehydrator and left the meat in for about 5 hours. My husband loved it! I think that the thicker cuts of meat let it not be too salty.

We tried this a few weeks ago with Pork instead of Beef. We let it marinate for 2 days.  It was delicious, so today we are making it again with Pork, and adding grated onion instead of powdered, 1 T tumeric, 1 clove garlic besides the powdered, 1 inch piece of grated ginger & 
1 T Molasses.  We also only had 1/2 cup of worcheshire, so we added 1/4 cup Aminos to it to even the liquid out. And we used regular paprika, instead of smoked, cuz we didn't have the smoked. 
I'll have to let you know how it comes out 'cuz we are going to let this marinate for 2 days then cook it up....more to come....

My son's been dying to make jerky for a while and has done a lot of research.  This appeared to be the basic recipe so we tried it.  After sampling the marinade (before putting the meat in) it was extremely salty so we added two table spoons of brown sugar and another tablespoon of honey.  Overall the taste is fine, but it's extremely salty still.

I would give it 5 stars, but since I deviated from the recipe slightly, I only gave it 4. I did not have any Worcestershire sauce at home, so I substituted with a Mexican sauce, also did not use as much of the liquid ingredients as the recipe. I did have all the other ingredients on hand though and it came out very nice. For meat I had a 1.5 lbs. piece of London broil, sliced as thin as I could, marinated overnight. Slicing the meat half frozen made it easier to obtain thin uniform slices. I did not miss the Worcestershire sauce at all, probably would not have liked it as much, but I might try it next time. Half of the soy sauce I used was reduced sodium.

Very simple and very tasty.   The only thing I would change is that I would add a sprinkle of kosher salt after you place it on the trays in the dehydrator or oven.

My husband uses this recipe all the time. Only changes we made were a teeny  bit less soy, added a bit of rosemary, and added a couple dabs of super hot sauce, because he loves rosemary and spicy.

Ok, wow, I mean really! I don't even like beef jerky and I can't stop eating it! The flavor has just a little heat to give it a nice kick. I ended up marinating for about 4 hours and baked it overnight on the lowest setting for my oven. It came out great! I will say my slices were on the thick side though. While the flavor was amazing, I would probably use a different cut of meat. The top round I used had a lot of non-edible sinew in it.

Addictive, tasty, exciting. Followed the recipe exactly, except I used some home-butchered goat rump instead of beef.

Made this twice, first time I skipped the setting the meat on the paper towels.  It had an extreme Worcestershire sauce taste.  The second time I rested on paper towels before drying, and it turned out much better.  This is a great recipe.

I have never made jerky before. I made one batch with stir fry style cuts of top round and the other batch was with thin slices. I followed the instructions to a T and it turned out great.

This was fantastic!!!! Could not keep it around for more than a day with family members. Only change was AGAVE nectar instead of honey.
Only adjustment needed is based on desire of how much heat you want.

I loved it! I just finished dehydrating it today and almost devoured all of it. I used my dehydrator as supposed to the oven. Hubby loved it. A healthy alternative snack than chips and sweets. Thanks, Chef John.
