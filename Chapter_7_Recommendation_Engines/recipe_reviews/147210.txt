The recipe is not that hard,i am an indian and i have seen how my mom does it,dont add to much water,the batter looses its flavor and Adding the onion, garlic, cilantro, sugar, turmeric, cumin, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, coriander, ginger, cayenne pepper and rice vinegar are NOT NEEDED!it will become uthappam(another southindian dish)not dosa.before pouring the batter on the pan take a half onion and rub it on the surface of the pan.mix the batter well before pouring it.Pour thick in the center and use a ladle and spread it from the center.

This should be named Spiced Crepes instead of Dosa. Dosa is a thin crisp crepe made with well ferrmented Lentils and Rice Mixture - after soaking and grinding them in a paste and adding a bacterial culture (live yougurt) for fermentation. When Dosa is made into a thick crepe, it can be topped with chopped fresh toppings (onions, tomatoes, green chilies, capsicums, dessicated coconut, corriander etc.) to make a Uttapam.

Delicious savory crepes.  I do not use wheat but I found Dosa Flour (a blend of rice and bean fours) at a local East Indian market.  Best eaten fresh out of the skillet.

This didn't work for me at all. Apart from adding a little salt, I made them as written. I left them overnight, and the batter got extremely thick so I stirred in a bit of milk. I found it extremely difficult to get them thin, and they broke apart when I turned them over. They tasted ok-ish, but they were really unappetizing-looking. Oh well.

The spices and vegetables were really tasty, but the recipe could have used some salt. I thinned the batter even more with some water.

I have made this recipe a couple of times and they are simply delicious!

My daughter has even asked for the recipe and they are now very popular with her friends at university.

I served these with an Indian curry and pilau rice.

Yummy pancakes. I too added a bit of salt and thinned the batter out with water the next day. Easy to make.. just like crepes,,, usually the first one doesnt work out, but the rest were fine. Had this with Creamy Chicken Curry ( also on Allrecipes) And really enjoyed my dinner

These were so good and they can be made with what you have on hand!  I left out the turmeric because I didn't have any.  I also halved the water and flour because I wanted more vegetable and seasoning, but it would have been good as written also.
