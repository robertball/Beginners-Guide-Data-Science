I have made this quite a few times over the past year.  I have made just a few minor adjustments.  1) I use 2lbs of chicken breast 2) to deal with the dryness  -> I cook the meal for about 5-6 hours on low rather than high.  The chicken is cooked through, but it isn't dry.  3) To give it a little more flavor -> I add at least 3 garlic cloves, although usually 5 or 6 b/c my family really loves garlic. 4) To decrease the salt -> I use 1/3 c low salt soy sauce to avoid the really salty flavor.  It wasn't too salty for me, but my husband said the first time I made it that it was too salty.  5) To thicken some sauce -> I take most of the sauce out of the crock pot and put it in a skillet.  I add about 1-2 teaspoons (slowly) of corn starch to thicken the sauce.  This has really made the difference in my opinion.  We take the sauce and put it over the chicken and rice.  With all of these additions, this recipe's really good.

((((in an Emeril accent)))) "Oh yeah, babe!" (((((end of Emeril accent)))))  This one if fanstinkintastic! Talk about healthy. Talk about easy?  Talk about absolutely delicious.  This recipe is the ticket.  I've been getting into slow cooker recipes ... having purchased a huge new slow cooker recently.  Since I love chicken, I was on the hunt for a recipe that would provide an interesting spin on chicken.  This recipe did the trick.  You just can't go wrong with this one.  Do note; I suspect slow cooker cooking times vary significantly.  I've noticed that my new large slow cooker seems to often cook recipes in half the time as what the recipe calls for, including this one.  Be warned.  Thankfully, I checked the chicken after two hours and it was DONE, and I cooked it on LOW.  The sauce makes this recipe so awesome ... it almost has a sweet and sour aura about it.  Have it tonight!

I actually cooked the chicken in the oven instead of the crock pot and it was beyond delicious. I cooked it covered for about one hour and then brushed some honey on top and cooked uncovered for about 20 minutes or until the chicken was a nice orange/brown color. My guests wouldn't leave without the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

I followed many suggestions found in the reviews to make this dish.  I first reduced the cooking time in half because I was using chicken breasts and not a whole chicken.  I also used 1/3 cup of soy sauce an 2/3 cup of honey in order to make sure the sauce was not too salty since I didn't have low sodium soya sauce on hand.  I thickened the sauce after in a small sauce pan and served over rice.  Of all the slow cooker chicken I have had so far...  This one was the tastiest!

This chicken was so good!  I used skinless boneless chicken breasts so i decreased the cook time, so the chicken didn't dry out!  I also added fresh ginger and garlic to the crock pot!  When the chicken was done I ladeled some of the sauce into a sauce pan on the stone and reduced it down!  I also made egg fried rice with day old cooked rice and peas and green onions and we also added the reduced sauce on top of the rice.  My kids (3 and 5) and my hubby loved it!  Would definetly make this again!

Delicious! I followed the recipe closely except I used less honey and I used a whole chicken as is. I put a crushed garlic clove inside the chicked along with some green onions. It came out delicious. I think I could have used all the honey and it would still have been fine. I added some sliced potatoes to the crock pot and they absorbed the juices and tasted delicious. I did not thicken the juice since we liked it just the way it was. We poured it over the chicken on our plates to soak it up which made the chicken so juicy. I will make this again.

Loved this recipe. Read the warnings about too much salt, so I added extra wine (total almost 1 cup) to the recipe in addition to a couple tablespoons of O.J.  The chicken was fantastic!

This was great.  I used white onion, and added a clove of garlic and some fresh ginger.  Added fresh whole mushrooms - which tasted fab cooked in the sauce.  I thickened the sauce with cornstarch at the end and ate over rice.  Will make again.

Pretty simple and very good.               Cutting up the chicken is a bit of work - suggest buying thighs, drumsticks or chicken wings.                                            We also ran out of Honey and decided to use Maple syrup - nice twist on the original recipe.                                           Next time, we'll make double the sauce, add Udon noodles and a few select veggies and serve as a soup.

This was very very good!  I did it in a caserolle dish for two hours at 300 F and it was delicious.  I'll be using the slow cooker method next time and I'm sure that'll be great.

Excellent!!! With some adjustments, as suggested by many reviewers. I used 1/2 the soy sauce, added some fresh minced garlic & some fresh chopped parsley, I also thickened the sauce @ the end with corn starch.  I've made this a few times, each with different types of chicken.. I find the absolute best is boneless/skinless chicken thighs.  The meat of the thigh will not dry up like breasts do and there's no fuss with chopping a whole bird! Served over rice with broccoli or believe it or not -- over mac n cheese!

Mmmmm mmmm good!  This is beyond easy and so tasty.  A couple of modifications I made- I used about two lbs. of chicken breasts out of preference.  I added 2 minced garlic cloves and 1 tsp. sesame oil... we add garlic to  everything!  I only had to cook  for 4 hours on LOW.  It was fall-apart perfect!  

In the end, I whisked 1 cup of flour with water in a separate bowl, added it to the slow cooker juice (chicken was on a separate plate), and poured that mixture into a sauce pan.  After boiling for 1 minute, it was thick and perfect!  

Thanks for sharing!!

This was super yummy! I did add quite a bit of extra stuff....but it is a great base. I added 4 garlic cloves, 1 tlbs of chopped ginger, 1 tsp of sesame oil. Cut the soya in half, and added about and 1/4 cup hoisen sauce.  I cooked the chicken whole on high for 6 hours, but was done at about 4.5 hours. THe sauce was so yummy! I made salad rolls with the left over chicken and use the sauce to dip them in. Next time I am going to add some crushed pineapple and red pepper!

This was a disaster. It looked very nice but the overall taste was unimpressive. I found the chicken was not "falling off the done" after 7 hrs of cooking. All measurements and ingredients were used according to the recipe. To make it worse this smelled repulsive the next morning!

I just learned of "slow cooking" this weekend, and wanted to try it.   Went to best buy and bought a cooker. Before cooking, we read the reviews, and decided to buy boneless, thighs, and skinless.  

This was my first recipe with a slow cooker (but I'm an experienced in the kitchen).  I went to Whole Foods with my 8 year old (Lauren) and bought the ingredients.  Other than cutting the onions, Lauren made the entire dish.  We followed the stated directions, but went with 3/8ths of a  cup of white wine.  The chicken was great, and our kitchen had a wonderful aroma and my 11 year old was asking to try the chicken before it was complete.  

Everyone loved the chicken and now we'll have to try some other recipes.

I tried this tonight and it was a hit. I pretty much followed the recipe. I used chicken thighs I had, added a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic and, as an afterthought, dumped in a small can of crushed pineapple with the juice. Cooked it on low in my crock pot for precisly 5 to 7 hours. It was quick to prepare and very easy. Will definitely make again.

The ingredients sounded a little questionable, but it turned out to be a pretty great meal-think glorified teriaki chicken! I suggest using a little less soy sauce as the recipe turns out salty. I added a garlic clove and seasoned the chicken(I used chicken breasts)w/ salt and pepper. It was very tender and yummy... We ate it over white rice

I was looking for a recipe I could make that didn't require me to go to the grocery store and I found this! I was a little skeptical but was desperate so I tried it. The only thing I changed was I added garlic and used chicken breast since I had it in the freezer. It came out amazing and is a new favorite!! I served it over rice since the sauce is amazing!

This was an inspirational delight!

I altered the recipe thus:
-Used Tamari (wheat free soy sauce) instead of regular soy.
-Used Agave Nectar instead of honey.
-Added 3 cloves of chopped garlic.
-Added 2 tablespoons of grated fresh ginger.
-Cooked it for 5 hours on low.

So delicious and moist!

I tried this recipe using butterflied pork chops.  Yummmmm.  We don't have wine so I used orange juice in place of the wine.  This was very, very good.

Really good.... Chicken was a little dry. I added 3 cloves of garlic and next time going to add a can of pineapple chunks to give it that teriyaki flare. This is a must try recipe for the person on the go that wants a good cooked meal without the fuss.

I was worried this chicken would be bland, but it has a really great flavor despite how easy it is to make. I used three boneless skinless breasts and four bone-in thighs and cooked it for four hours on high; it was falling apart by then in my KitchenAid crockpot. I thickened the sauce afterward with some corn starch mixed with a few tablespoons or so of the liquid which I brought to a boil on the stove. I served it over hot buttered rice. I was thinking about what other things I could do to make this taste even better. Maybe some brown sugar? Maybe some pineapple or mango? Maybe a little more honey (I used Tupelo honey by the way). Maybe some different spices like cumin, etc. would brighten it. It's something I will certainly make again and play around with the flavors. Great recipe though.

This one was a huge hit with our household! I used boneless & skinless chicken breasts and cut the time to about 4 hours in the crock pot.  When I came home I just added a salad with ginger dressing and white sushi rice.  It was fantastic!

Um... this ROCKED.  I don't usually love the slow cooker recipes on this site, I've found they tend to be bland.  The only minor changes I made was adding some garlic, seasoning the chicken first and using bonless skinless breasts (had to reduce cook time to about two hours).  They have great flavor. I didn't thicken the sauce this time but I will next time.  It's definitely a good dish and I am happy I made it.  For how easy it is it's definitely worthy of happening again.

I made the following changes: used boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into small strips, added two cloves of garlic to the sauce, along with 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, and substituted chicken stock for the water and white wine. Simmered in a pan on the stove until done. Served with brown rice and sauteed vegetables, using some of the sauce with the veggies and spooned over the rice. Delicious!

We didn't really care for this recipe (sorry).  However, I made Chinese Fried Rice I with the leftovers and was pleased with the extra flavor the chicken added to the fried rice.

Wow, this recipe had the perfect ratio of sweet and salty! I added some garlic and orange juice for my family's tastes, and used chicken breasts. Served over short-grain rice. YUM!

I will definitely make this again.  It was so easy and really good!  I gave it 4 stars vs 5 because I tweaked the recipe.  I reduced the amount of soy sauce to 1/2 the amount the recipe called for.  I used low sodium soy sauce.  Instead of chicken breast, I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, and cooked them in the crockpot for 4 hours on low.  I added: 3 cloves of garlic, grated some fresh ginger.  The last hour of cooking, I added whole mushrooms. The last 10 mins, I added broccoli.  Served it over steamed rice and everyone loved it.  You could easily add other veggies or maybe even some pineapple too.

I love slow cooker chicken recipes.  But, this one wasn't for me.  It was a little dry like others have said.  The soy taste was way too strong.  I followed recipe as written except used lite soy sauce like someone had suggested to keep it from tasting too salty.  Oh, well...next recipe please!

Great flavor, and lots of left-over sauce that I use later. I baked the chicken instead of doing it in a crock-pot, as someone suggested, and it turned out really good. I also didn't have green onions so I used white ones, and added fresh sliced mushrooms to the mix as someone suggested.

Really simple and good! I thickened up the sauce with some corn starch and served it all over rice.

1/2 cup of honey is a bit much, though... 1/4 to 1/3 would be fine.

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and reduced the time in the crock pot to 2 1/2 hours. The chicken wasn't tough, like some other have said. I used the extra sauce to make gravy and serve over rice (using cornstarch). However, it was just ordinary, nothing special. I don't think I'll make it again. It was a little too sweet for my taste (and I like sweet stuff!)

Yummy, yummy, yummy!!  I did mine (drumsticks & boneless,skinless thighs) in a 400 degree oven for 1 hour covered.  I drained some of the sauce into a pot; cooked chicken (basted w/honey) for 20 min. uncovered.  Thickened remaining sauce with cornstarch.  Perfect!!!  Thank You!

Easy to make.I used chicken thigh and drumstick with skin on. Used a little less soy sauce.  I didn't have green onions so I used yellow onions isntead. The sauce came out too sweet to my taste so I added some shitake mushroom as suggested in the reviews and thickened it with rice flour. Over steam rice, it balanced the sweetness. My picky husband actually enjoyed it(more than I did) as he normally doesn't like sweet tasting entrees.

The family was not impressed with this one. The kids and hubby were not big fans of the soft floppy skin and thought the dish was too salty. I could try the boneless breast and some low sodium soy as others suggested....but will most likely stick to my ginger based marinade and throw boneless breasts on my grill pan when the craving hits, since the boneless breasts cook in less than 10 min anyway, what is the point of slow cooking them?.

Really liked the "kona" taste of the chicken, but it was so DRY.  Wish I had read the other reviewers comments of cutting the cooking time in half.

This was ok but I have tried other sweet and sour chicken recipes that were far better.  Simple enough and the flavour was ok.  I guess my hopes were higher with this due to the wine inclusion however, I was a bit disappointed.

Fabulous!! I used red wine because that's what I had at home and after tasting it I think the white would not be strong enough for my taste- a fortunate change! In the crockpot I also added a couple sliced carrots. I served it on a bed of rice, with a layer of sauteed greens, and topped with the chicken, carrots and sauce. Can I say again? Delicious!!

Very easy and pretty good.  I think I'll try doing it on low for longer next time.  We took the sauce and thickened it up with a bit of flour in a skillet afterwards.  I served it with rice and some veggies, it made a good meal!

I added garlic powder and ginger, thickened the juice with cornstarch to make a sauce to pour over the chicken which I sliced, and garnished with more chopped green onion.  I served it over rice.  Mine was a little overcooked, but that's my crockpot's fault, not the recipe's!  Overall we liked it, although I wouldn't say it was one of our faves.

Easy and tasty but needs something to make it really stand out and I'm not sure what that is.  Worth experimenting with - thinking maybe some apple or pineapple chunks would make it more exciting.

A simple recipe to make for fussy company. Made this for our in-laws who eat very bland, and they loved it. We also enjoyed it but it's not something I'd make every day. The dark meat was cooked to perfection but the white meat was a little dry.

This was pretty darn good. I made it with BLSL breasts and since some of the reviews said it was too salty, I increased the wine and honey and used low-sodium broth instead of water. I wanted a complete meal so at the end of cooking, I sauteed some red bell peppers and carrots in EVOO and then splashed some sauce over top. The chicken looked a little sickly, so I threw it in the pan with the veggies for a quick sear. Served over rice and it was a HIT.

This dish was not only extremely easy but very tasty.  I used a red wine instead of white...which I had on hand, and it did not seem to make that much of a difference.  Family enjoyed it very well too.

I used leg/thigh quarters. It was done in 3 hours and I deboned the chicken and defatted the sauce. Served it over brown rice. Had high hopes but was just ok. I can't really say what might have improved it. Will not make again.

Yummm - and most importantly super simple. Love a meal you can prepare in the morning, then just sit and eat with little or no fuss at dinner time. I cooked on low for 6hrs, 1/2 cup wine, also added some fresh minced garlic and ginger, then removed and thickened the sauce before serving - it was delish!

This made a rich but yummy sauce but the chicken was too dry. I think this would be better suited as a marinade for salmon or pork, its just too rich on it own.

So easy and good!  This recipe is a great way to use leftover white wine.  We liked it so much I made it twice in one week.  As another reviewer suggested, I used the leftovers to make a yummy fried rice.  Just added some black beans and additional green onions and the fried rice was good to go.  This is now one of my new favorite ways to make crockpot chicken.

This was just okay for me. I made using boneless skinless chicken breasts. I was looking forward to the play of sweet  against the salty with the added note of white wine. Unfortunately, all I tasted was the salt. If I made this again, I would reduce the soy sauce by half.

Picky  husband loved it! My 5 year old preferred the sauce over ketchup (a first)! I thickened the sauce and served over the chicken.  Used split chicken breast w/bone & skin (removed skin before serving).  Will add to our list of regular features. Will freeze wine so I have it available next time.

I tried this last night-- I used 4 chicken breasts and cooked it on the low setting (I arrived home after it had been cooking for 6 hrs-- when I usually convert recipes from high to low I follow a 2 to 1 ratio so I thought I'd be fine). Well...the sauce had  scorched around the edges and had a slightly burned taste, and the meat was very dry. I am going to try again but only cook them for half the time (I'll use a temp probe to test them after 2 hrs-- this means it will have to be a weekend). I suspect it's the fault of my crockpot- like a previous poster, I've noticed that my new crockpot runs at a much higher temp than my old one did, even on low...
Even dried out and obviously overdone it still was a hit with two kids! It's worth playing around with just because of that. Thanks!

I followed the directions to a T except I used 3-4 lbs. ofchicken tenderloins. I also used chardonnay for the wine. I found the chicken to be dry and extremely salty. I would recommend cooking on LOW for about 7 hours and using low sodium soy sauce.

We made this and thoroughly enjoyed it.  My only mistake was using boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of the quarters.  My chicken was too dry -- the flavor was great.  Will try again and follow directions.

We loved this chicken.  As suggested I used drum sticks and I didn't have time to cook it in the crock pot.  I put it in the oven, covered, at 500 degrees for 15 minutes.  I then poured the sauce over the chicken and reduced the heat to 300 degrees for one hour.

This was so good. I loved the flavor of it. The only thing I changed was I used chicken thighs (it's what I had on hand) instead of broilers. Everything else was exactly as the recipe called for.  I don't like changing a recipe completely and then rating it because I'd be rating my recipe and not this one. Simple hints are great but a complete change of a recipe I just don't understand. If you're going to change it around that much then just post your own recipe. That being said I feel this is a very versatile recipe. As is it is amazing. It made great sandwiches the next day too. Next time I may add some green peppers and pineapple chunks, or I may just make it as is again. It's a keeper!

Tasty chicken but something was missing. I added Sesame oil and that didn't help. I even made fried rice. Perhaps some toasted sesame seeds? Pretty good for company dinner.

A VERY tasty dish! I didn't need to cook the whole recipe, so i used 3 boneless breasts and halved the sauce ingredients (using low-sodium soy). After a couple hours, the sauce tasted a bit bland so i added some peanut oil and a bit more honey and soy sauce. At the end i removed the meat, poured the sauce into a pan and thickened it with 3 T. cornstarch dissolved in 1/2 cup water. The sauce was YUM with the chicken served over rice; definitely worth the extra work. Next time i'll cook this on Low for 5 hours, because the honey took on a slight burnt flavor in my slow-cooker on High.

There's nothing wrong with this recipe. I have no idea how it has acquired such a poor rating. This recipe makes a very thin sauce which needs to be removed and thickened with cornstarch, but otherwise, it's fine.

This was easy and excellent. I used vut up thighs and legs. I will say it cooked faster than I thought. I ddi add garlic like someone else suggested. My 5 year old and 2 year old couldn't get enough. Some people thought it was too salty. I didn't since I used skin-on meat. I think the skin absorbed the excess salt from the soy sauce because I thought it to be just right. I could see it being too salty if there was no skin to balance (the skins adds flavor to the cooking but we dodn't eat it). We'll definitely add this to out menu again. I love finding crockpot recipes that don't include pork or read meat. Thanks!

I've made this a few times and followed the directions pretty closely.  The only change I made was to add cornstarch at the end as others have suggested and I used chicken tenderloins.  I also used cooking sherry once and it turned out just as good!  I've taken this to potlucks and everyone loved it!

Delicious!  I ran out of honey at about 1/3 cup so I substituted maple syrup for the rest.  I might put more green onion in next time, because they are so delicious in the sauce.

I love the idea of using a slow cooker and having my meal done when I get home from work.  Unfortunately I don’t always have great results with my slow cooker.  Not so with this, the chicken had a nice texture and taste.  I agree that it could be tweaked somewhat to give it more flavor but overall it was a hit.

Pretty good recipe when I was looking for something easy to throw in the crock pot. I used yellow onions and chicken broth instead of green onions and white wine, just because thats what I had. I am sure it would be even better if I had followed the recipe exactly. I used chicken breasts, and cooked on low for about 4 hours. It was very moist. Leftovers were great in fried rice.

I made in slow cooker exactly as directed, with these changes: * added fresh grated ginger * added garlic (2-3 tsp) * added 1 tbs chili paste * Used 2 lbs boneless chicken breasts cut into strips.  served over white rice  next time I'll add add mushrooms, maybe carrots and/or green beans.  Very tasty and very easy!

I followed the recipe with the exception that I used diced yellow onion instead of green onion since I had none on hand and I used boneless skinless chicken breast.  I don't know if these small changes could affect the dish that much but my family simply didn't like it.  The soy sauce (I really like soy sauce) was way overpowering and overall, the flavor was just not very good.  Sorry, but I don't think that I will be makind this again.

Wow, way to salty....I even cut a few raw potatoes to absorb the salt and it was still way too salty....seems the longer it sat the salty it got.  On a plus note, the chicken was moist!

I would have given this 5 stars for the flavor, but the cooking time is way too long. My chicken was really dry. I think it would be great if you knock a few hours off the time, though. 2 hours on high, or 4 hours on low would probably do it.

We loved this.  I did have to make a couple of alterations, based on what I had on hand.  I didn't have quite enough honey, so I made up the difference with molasses.   I also used boneless skinless chicken breast and regular onion.  I thickened the sauce with some cornstarch and served it over rice with some steamed broccoli.  My husband licked his plate!  It was awesome!

I followed some others suggestions and reduced the amount of soy sauce, but eventually added it anyway, along with some ginger, garlic and hot sauce. But I just couldn't get it to taste how I wanted it too. I was hoping this would be a good one, but I was disappointed along with the rest of my family, my husband couldn't even eat it... sorry.

So easy and so delicious.  I used a whole cut-up chicken and while cooking the 4 hours on high, the house was filled with the most wonderful aroma.  With a lot of restraint, I did not eat the entire chicken myself; it tasted so wonderful, I believe I could have.  My husband raved about it and asked that the recipe be put into the "use again soon" category.

I prepared this for family as we celebrated our new Family Holiday weekend in February. Everyone enjoyed it. The only changes I made were similar to some of the other reviewers, I used 1/3 cup low salt soy and 2/3 cup honey as well as chicken breasts. I totally forgot the cornstarch but it turned out great! Thanks so much for the recipe and the added reviews!

We tried this tonight.   The good part about this recipe is it is easy and quick to make.   The negative is the taste was pretty bland.   I did lower the amount of soy sauce (as per other reviews, to 1/3 cup to lessen the salt taste) and added 1 Tbs of garlic. I also thickened the sauce on the stove (which I highly recommend).   Next time I think I may add some orange juice to give it a bit more to the flavor (something similar to an orange chicken recipe).   I think with a bit more added to the recipe it could be a family favorite.

I made this for dinner last night.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts because it's what I had on hand.  I followed the other ingredients exactly.  I don't own a slow cooker so I took the suggestions of others and baked covered in the oven at 400 for an hour and then uncovered (with a touch more honey on top of the chicken) for 20 minutes.  It was "okay" but nothing spectacular.  Like someone else mentioned, it tasted basically like teriyaki chicken and since I'm not a huge fan of teriyaki, it wasn't much to my liking.  It wasn't horrible (in fact the chicken pieces were somewhat moist) but I wouldn't make it again.  I'm also still soaking my beloved glass cookware...it made a horrific mess of my pan.

I haven't tried this recipe as yet but I wanted to thank the reviewer who said she made this in the oven instead of the slow-cooker and how she did it.  I don't care much for crockpot cooking and her directions will now allow me the opportunity to dry this very delicious sounding meal. It would be a nice idea if others could do the same with their contributions to this wonderful site. Thanks,Iris Ferber

Very good recipe!  I used chicken breasts instead, and low-sodium soy sauce.  The chicken falls apart when you remove it from the slow cooker, but that's ok, that just means it's super moist and juicy!  I make this at least once a month and get rave reviews!

This turned out well!  The sauce was very thin so I made some white rice and served the chicken over rice.  It was very salty even though I used low sodium soy sauce and used less than the recipe calls for.  I would definitely recommend using even less, and maybe using more honey instead.

Very tasty!  This dish is definitely a "Do-Over!" I actually used 2 large chicken breasts and cut the cooking time in half (2 hours).  I served over brown rice and with an Asian style salad. You could also shred the chicken then mix with sauce and rice.

Wonderful! Loved the sauce -- it gave the chicken a lot of great flavor, and was super easy to make. Next time I'll serve it over white rice so it will soak up the extra sauce.

I made this when I wanted something new to do with some chicken I had. I used low sodium soy sauce, so it wasn't too salty, and it turned out a very basic teriyaki type chicken. I missed the fresh ginger I put into my usual teriyaki sauce, so maybe I will add some next time.

This dish was awesome!I followed cooking instructions & ingredients exactly, but then I deboned the chicken & placed in a dish.I removed fat from the sauce(using a gravy separator, put sauce in a saucepan, & added cornstarch & water mixture to thicken.I made stir fried rice(cooked rice,eggs,green onions,Natures Seasons)I then added some of the sauce to the rice!I poured the rest of the sauce over the chicken.My family loved it(even my picky 2 & 4 year olds!)Thank you Kimberly!This is a keeper!

This recipe is easy but it is not very appealing to serve because of the color (a light gray). The taste was fine but nothing great, and I don't think that I would recommend this for a family of picky eaters. I served it over rice but the sauce is simply to thin. The recipe is just okay in my opinion. It isn't something I would make again.

Delicious!  I used boneless breasts as some advised, and added 1 Tbs of powdered garlic, (we are garlic crazy)  served with Parmesan Potatoes (also from this site) and green beans.  The family loved it!  Thanks Kimberly!!!

This dish smelled wonderful while it was cooking. Made as directed, it was fast and simple to put together. The flavors, while delicious, were too subtle for my family. I think I'll try this one again and adjust the seasonings.

Followed recipe except used 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1 cup water, no wine.   Cooked 2 breasts, sliced in half & quartered, 2 hours on high in slow cooker.  Put sauce into saucepan and added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to 2 tablespoons of water for sauce.

My family and I didn't care for this. For me, it was overpowering in salt. All I could really taste was soy sauce.

Made this according to recipe except I just used thighs and legs since I really didn't feel like quatering a chicken myself.  Also added minced garlic.  Smelled excellent while cooking, but I was really disappointed by the flavor... or lack thereof.  Not sure why this was so bland!  Everything used to make it is very flavorful, so I don't know what happened.  However, I won't be making this again.  There are much better ways for me to occupy my crockpot than with this recipe.  Glad others like it, though!

Great recipe, family loves it, I do have too double the recipe too feed a family of five, plus a few lunches. 

I  followed Hokielearning2cook adjustments, 
And i slow cooked it in my crock pot for 5-6 hours.
The adjusments make a huge difference.

 4lbs of chicken breasts ( to feed a family of five plus lunches) 
1 cup water ( will be using low sodium chicken broth next time, will update )
1/2 cup green onion ( will adjust to 3/4 cup ).
2/3 cup low sodium kikoman soy sauce. ( any more and it would probably be too satly for my liking. )
1/2 cup white cooking wine. 
3/4 cup too 1 cup of honey.
about a tablespoon of black  pepper ( i will probably use a little bit more as i love black pepper )

I used hokielearning2cooks adjustments, and added in:
5-6 garlic cloves ( adjusting to around 8 )
AND
I took out most of the sauce from the crock pot, put it into a skillet, turned it on low to medium and added in about 5 tsp ( since i made a double batch ) of corn starch too thicken the sauce up, and it made a huge difference.
Thanks Hokielearning2cook!

I serve my chicken over white rice , add chicken, then ladle in some sauce and enjoy!

I think this is a bit too salty. I doubled the wine and added a little water so I could convert this to be cooked in my pressure cooker. I used a whole 3lb bag of frozen chicken and it came out great. Less salty and plenty of sauce for all the chicken and rice. I put it all in the pressure cooker with the still frozen chicken. Thirty minutes later, it was done!

Awesome!! I took some of the advice of other review, used skinless chicken thighs, added 1 glove garlic, and cut the water in half, cooked on high for 2 hrs. then added broc. florets cooked another 30 mins. served with rice with the thickened juice. My daughter has begged for me to make again, but with extra broccolli.  today I doubled the juice and am adding frozen oriental veggies.

I planned to make this recipe but only had two hours, so I marinated the chicken in the sauce and then bbq'd it. I boiled the marinade down to a glaze and glazed the chicken pieces when they were done. After trying this in the slow cooker at a later date, I think the marinated and bbq'd chicken was better!

I followed the directions exactly and it came out tasting ok, but but did not look anything like the picture. the sauce was thin and was not the thick reddish sauce in the picture. I was disappointed by this. Some people in other reviews poured out the sauce and made a gravy to pour over it by reducing it in a saucepan and thickening with corn starch or gravy flour. I will give this one more try using that tip.

I used boneless/skinless thighs and they cooked up nicely.  the sauce was a bit bland...no, rather it was one dimentional and cooking the green onions for so long made them bitter.  I suggest adding them later.  I also added garlic as suggested by others, and I added crushed pineapple, but still the sauce was not to our liking.

It wasn't AWFUL... but the smell coming out of the crock pot sure was.  The dish itself was just bland.  I even added some garlic before cooking.  Towards the end, I added a bit of brown sugar and extra soy sauce, but it was too late.  Won't be making again.

I put this in my crock pot to cook, and although looking back it was a little mushy if I put some of the vegetables in later it would have been even better.

Quick. Easy. Delicious.  I took the suggestions of another review, and added a couple of chopped garlic cloves to the mixture.  I used skinned chicken quarters.  After chicken was done, I reduced the sauce, and added just a bit of cornstarch for thickening.  The family loved it, even the very particular 5 year old!

I made this at work for our Christmas pot luck.  It turned out great.  We had some left over so I took it home and my husband loved it also.  He is really picky so I was glad to find something he would eat.

This dish was ok. I used reduced sodium soy sauce and even though it was very salty. It's very easy and quick for busy days, I may try again with some changes.

Followed the directions, but this tasted bland before I even poured it over the chicken, so I added a touch more green onion, and it was crying for ginger and garlic.  I also added a touch of toasted sesame oil, since I could drink it out of the bottle.  Served this on brown rice, but it still tasted like it was missing something.  My husband thought I just made a bad teriyaki chicken.  Won't be making this one again.  Thanks anyway.

My husband and I love this recipe! I portion uncooked chicken breast in ziploc bags and pour the sauce in each one before freezing. It works out perfectly all we have to do is thaw and cook whenever we're in the mood for Kona chicken!

A great option for us because we can't make sweet and sour chicken due to my husbands issues with white sugar.  We used organic honey and this was lovely!

I followed the recipe & mine looked nothing like the picture & wasn't exactly the most delicious thing ever. It was pretty greasy & grey looking. I ended up deboning the leftovers & using it like any other deboned chicken - nothing special.

I used chicken breast and cooked on low. I thought the chicken came out great but all I could taste was the honey.  Maybe because I used Clover honey it was very strong, 1/2 cup of honey seems like a lot.

wasn't so excited about this recipe... i thought it would be an oriental style chicken but it didnt turn out as expected at all. too thin, too strong in taste (and not a well balanced taste, either) and the chicken was also too dry.  i'm sure with some alterations this recipe could be really good, the basic idea is great i think, but i will not make this very one again. sorry

I followed some other users suggestions and added some garlic and ginger and thickened the sauce a bit with some cornstarch. I also marinated all of the ingredients together overnight and just tossed it in the crock pot the next day. The chicken was verrry tender but did seem to lack some flavor. I thought it was OK but my boyfriend dumped all his dish on to my plate :/

Pretty good.  I used split chicken breasts and they came out a little dry (I thought), but my family loved it.  Next time I will cook it for less time with breasts or use a whole chicken.

Very tasty, excellent with white rice.  Although I think it would be a little better if the sauce were thicker, which you can do with cornstarch.

I must have done something wrong, because this was just horrible.  I tried it this weekend, so I was home while it was cooking in the crockpot.  I had a feeling it wasn't going to work out well, since it didn't even smell good while cooking.  I follwed the recipe exactly (usually don't experiment until after I try a recipe as written).

I'm shocked that I didn't like this after all the positive reviews it got. There was waaaaaaaaay too much soy sauce and the chicken didn't really take on the flavor. We definitely won't have this again.

This was really not good.  I would actually say horrible.  I'm pretty upset about the waste of chicken.  I made it exactly as stated, and when I tried it at the end, I couldn't believe how bad the sauce was, so I dumped in some crushed pineapple I had and let it go another hour.  It helped a little, but all in all, a really bad dinner.  Oh, how I hate throwing food away, but looks like that's where this one's headed.  Oh bother.

After reading such wonderful reviews I couldn’t wait to try this recipe even though the combination of ingredients sounded weird. I’m surprised so many people found this delicious. The good news is the chicken was perfect in texture, tenderness and moisture. It seriously fell apart in my mouth and I enjoyed this part of the dish very much. However the flavor left much to be desired. It wasn’t terrible just notworth making again. I am glad to have tried because it was interesting if nothing else.

eh. Nothing to write home about. It's bascily like a marinade. i only cooked it for 3 hours and it was still kinda dry. Even though it was almost covered in juices. I dipped my chicken in a cup of the juices because I was too lazy to make gravy out of them, but I could have. This recipe is just okay. If you want to make chicken in the crock pot it really isn't a whole lot different thatn the oven seasoning wise.

This was full of flavor - but very sweet and sticky and syrupy and messy.  It didn't feel healthy to eat, but it did taste pretty good. Eat this fresh - I hated the leftovers and had to throw them away. Pair this with brown rice and a big helping of veggies!

This did not suit our tastes.  Not sure why we love all the things in it, maybe just not mixed together.  My kids who are not very picky were not impressed.  Sadly we will not be making again.

This recipe is so easy to prepare, and the bonus is that for something so simple, it tastes great! Next time though I will cut the cooking time in half...used 4 boneless chicken breasts and four hours was much too long. Wonderful, easy recipe; thanks so much!

Very good.  Used boneless/skinless thighs.  Added garlic, and onions (instead of green onions).  1 year old (shredded) and 5 year old liked it.  Would make it again!

This did not turn out well for me.  I halved the recipe, so maybe tht's why, but although the flavors were pretty good (not GREAT), the chicken pretty much just fell apart and the sauce was too thin.  But I shredded it and mixed the sauce in and it tasted ok.  I won't make it again though.

I may have overcooked it because my slow cooker goes into automatic warming mode after the cook time has lapsed, but this was terrible.  The sauce was just not good and, as others have pointed out, made the chicken turn a very unappetizing shade.

I cooked this for 7 hours on low. At around five hours of cooking I added canned mushrooms.  This smelled great and the meat fell off the bone.  BUT, this lacked any real flavor.  This is a "delete from my recipe box" recipe.
