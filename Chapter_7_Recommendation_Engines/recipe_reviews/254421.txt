This was okay but it was a lot of work AND time and not one I'd make again. I know this is candy but it was far too sweet in my opinion. Plan on 30 minutes to soften the rinds and because they are so wet, it will take the full 8 hours to dehydrate.

I used 1 tsp of liquid peppermint instead. I kept it in the dehydrater for 20 hours.  Loved it.
