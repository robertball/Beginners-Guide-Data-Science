Not my favorite crisp recipe but good. I found the end result a little tart for my taste, even served with vanilla ice cream. The method of mixing the topping in the food processor didn't work so well for me; I think my food processor is too small. I tried pulsing but still ended up with sticky dough....tasted great but didn't look so pretty once baked. I also found the end result just a bit thin. So, if I wanted to try this again, I would probably add a couple of sweeter apples to the recipe, and mix the topping by hand. Glad I tried it, I did enjoy the cranberries!

Very easy recipe to make, not a lot of ingredients. I used Granny Smith Apples and loved the tartness from them. Will definitely make again thank you PAM for the recipe.

I used Honeycrisp apples because they are my favorite.  I really love the way it turned out - and I added twice as many cranberries.  Turned out really well.  We loved it.  One of the best crisp recipes I've found.  Even without vanilla ice cream.

Wow! What a great dessert for Fall! I tweaked this one a bit . . . I used fresh/frozen cranberries (about 1 cup) in place of the dried, and also added a bit of sugar and cinnamon to the apples/cranberries. Rather than using a food processor, I chose to just combined the brown sugar, oats, flour and cinnamon in a bowl and just cut in the butter with a pastry blender - as I wanted the topping more "chunky". It was delicious! I took this to my bestie's house for dinner, and everyone liked it. Will make again.

Very good fall comfort food. I used all Gala apples as that's what I had on hand. Also, I dusted the apples and cranberries with cinnamon and cloves just because we like intense flavors. I have used Pam products for as long as I can remember, being disappointed by the quality of store brands. As you can see in my picture, no hard crusty sticking to the Pyrex baking dish. Makes for easy clean-up. Thank you Pam!

Really good recipe, quick to whip up and everyone loved it.  I used half  Honeycrisp apples and half Granny Smith just to add a bit of sweetness.

Really Good!  I used a few Granny Smith apples and then I added Fuji to the mix as I don't like the tartness of the GS so much.   The results were wonderful!   I would have liked it if the topping had crisped up better, but I was in a hurry to get it done and didn't take the time to let that happen on its own in the oven.   Other than my eagerness to get it out of the oven before I had to go to work, it was wonderful.  So easy to make and will be something that you will serve guests who come for dinner.   #AllstarsPAM

I have to say, I was a bit skeptical when I was making this. I did sub out Honeycrisp apples for the tart ones called for in the recipe, but with sugar only in the topping and relatively short bake time, I didn't think this recipe would turn out...but it did...and it was quite good.  My apples cooked to soft but still had shape and there was just the right amount of sweetness. I did add a pinch of salt to the topping when I made it in the food processor.

This was delicious.  maybe a bit too sweet, but I used Gala apples since that is what I had.  next time I plan to cut the sugar by at least 1/4 cup.  I also would like to try using fresh cranberries.

A nice change with the dried cranberries - I liked the addition, my husband preferred the crisp without.  I would have liked more topping but it was still very good.
