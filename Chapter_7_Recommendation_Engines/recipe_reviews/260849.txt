This is so good and so few people in the South even know this dish exists!  I loved Yoshinoya beef bowl when I lived in CA, then moved to Nashville and have not been able to find a place to get this dish.  Thank you for this recipe!  I had no idea I could easily make this at home...now I can have my beloved beef bowl whenever I want.  For those who do not know what dashi is, it is a Japanese soup stock  (fish soup...but don't worry, it just wakes up flavors, it doesn't make things taste fishy and nasty), dashi is easily made at home but for convenience I buy Hondashi instant granules (it can be purchased online or in asian markets, I got mine on ebay ) and I make as much as needed when a recipe calls for dashi.  Dashi can be omitted and plain water can be used, but the dashi just gives a little extra depth of flavor that is really nice, the same with the Sake, it too can be left out and the beef bowl will still be good, but adding it as written kicks the flavor up a notch.  If you follow the recipe as written, it is authentic and you will get the full flavor of this dish...it is simple beef and onions over rice but it is AMAZING, a little tip, if you partially freeze the beef before slicing it makes it easier to slice it in thinner strips (the thinner the better for this recipe).  I always top my beef bowl at the table with some crushed chili flakes and a little extra dash of soy sauce...HEAVEN!  Thank you so much for giving me back one of my favorite foods~~!!!
