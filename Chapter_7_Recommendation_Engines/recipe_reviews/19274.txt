These cookies are totally tasteless.  They have very little taste.  It is like chewing chocolate cardboard.  Dont bother making them.  It is a waste of time and ingrediants.  The only thing they are good for is a halloween decoration.

These cookies are totally awesome!  I had a birthday party for my cat and these were a big hit.  They taste great and disappear fast.  Everybody loved them.  If you're having a party I suggest you make double the suggested amount.  You won't be sorry, neither will your guests.  Thanks a lot!

These looked so gross but were so fun to make!  The flavor was a bit "blah", and might be improved by adding more sugar or maybe some chocolate chips.  I added chocolate & butterscotch chips, peanuts, and coconut.  My oldest DS has request 3 batches of these for his Halloween party next Monday night.

These cookies definitely look authentic and weren't hard to make. Everyone at work saw them and did a double take. In the taste department, they are quite lacking if you like sweet cookies.I didn't care for the taste at all. They are firm and only slightly sweet. I would suggest modifying the recipe to include more sugar, or maybe use Nestle quik or something instead of cocoa powder. Maybe the whole wheat did it, who knows... Experiment to find the best taste and most realistic looking. A+ on presentation, D on taste. I might even say 'F' but I'm trying to be nice.

It's difficult to rate these cookies, after all, do you really want to eat them?  For an even more realistic effect, half fill a disposable aluminum pan with grapenuts and then drop these cookies in.  Serve with a "poop scoop" utensil. Everyone gets a kick out of these, but no one will touch them.  Good visual on a Halloween table or by the front door.  Tell the Trick-or-treaters to "Help yourself"  (P.S. Keep the cat away from this.  It may cause confusion.)

EXCELLENT! original, tasty, helpful presentation suggestions.
i like my cookies rich so i substituted powdered chocolate for semi sweet and added plenty of nuts for a better visual effect. a friend suggested coated them in coconut for that 'tapeworm'effect, but that's going too far, i think.
people gobbled them up like hotcakes.

OK, I had to try the recipe with all the accessories.  We have decided that it looks a lot like the real thing and tastes like what we would expect the real thing to taste like.   So, all in all, it is VERY realistic.  I was impressed.  And while my son "loved" looking at it, neither he, nor any of his friends, would get close enough to put it in their mouths.  I ended up putting it "out" for pickup with the rest of the litter.

I had a hard time eating it because of the poop concept. But if you get past that its pretty good. I don't have any upgrades for this recipe. It was very good for poop.

Great joke dessert but also yummy! I made a few alterations: a bit less butter, no vanilla extract and I added a handful of crunchy chocolate cereal to the batter instead of rolling it in the cereal. I served it on a bed of All-Bran. Gross to make - it's all squidgey in your hands when you shap it!

They're really nice but unfortunately the chocolate nugget cereal went a bit cardboardy. Plenty sweet enough for my tastes.
