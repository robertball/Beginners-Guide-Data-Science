So easy and so delicious!  My husband says he'd be a happy man if we made this once a week.

This is a great salad!  We used sirloin strip steak as it tends to be a more tender cut and marinated it for about 3 hours. Asembled salad per instructions.  I used "Italian salad dressing mix" salad dressing from this site and my fiance used more of the Good Seasons Balsamic on his.  We both enjoyed them very much!  Served with garlic bread.  Super meal!  Will be making again!
