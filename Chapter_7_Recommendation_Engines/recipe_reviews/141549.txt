Such a wonderful soup.  We diced up a small onion and two cloves of garlic and sauteed these in 1T butter before adding the cider and all else (leaving out the water), with 1t dried thyme.  We also  substituted one 14oz can of (whole) corn for the frozen and 12oz can of evaporated milk.

This is a very nice recipe that is exactly as described.  It's a great base recipe that can be altered to what ever you may be craving....or what ever you find in your food supply on hand.

The flavor of this was just ok for us. A little like underspiced pumpkin pie. However the appearance was very unappetizing. I will not repeat what my hubby said it looked like, but after he said it, I was done eating for the day.

It turned out very good. I didn't have any cider and forgot the water so it was more like a corn chowder. I also used different spices to give it a stronger flavor.

I did not care for this recipe. It is like tomato soup that was made with pumpkin. Will not be making again.
