I just took this cake out of the oven and thought I'd offer that the cooking time is incorrect.  Using another cake recipe with similar ingredients as a guide, I cooked the cake for an hour instead of the 1 3/4 hour that is written on the recipe.  It appears moist and beautiful and passes the tooth pick test.  Fast forward two days...When we cut the cake for my husband's birthday the next day, it was beautiful and tasted great!  It's a hit in our family.

Good luck!

I made this with 3 kids, followed directions perfectly and it was not good, very dense like a bread, the batter was delicious so I am curious if the cooking time of 1 3/4 hours is incorrect.  The cake was dull and almost dry.

I wouldnt recommend this recipe. While the cake tastes really good, the texture was very dry and crumbly and I followed this recipe to the T!

This is a great recipe for the chocolate lover.  I have served it sprinkled with confectioners sugar, and I've also tried it with a chocolate ganache.  YUM!!

Used a round pan instead of fluted.  Everything came out fine, only had to cook it for 1 1/2 hours, but not impressed with the taste at all.  Very, very bland.  Don't think I'll make it again.

Dry, not very chocolaty.  The batter was so stiff, I had trouble spreading it in the cake pan, and it resulted in a big mess when I tried smoothing batter over the chocolate /sugar mixture that was sprinkled on.  The biggest problem.....way too DRY!!

I agree, a lot of effort for a dry dense cake :( Recipe is confusing when it comes to where to add the egg whites.
