I followed the recipe exactly, and I continually got the burn warning.  I opened and stirred and added more water a few times, but continued to get the burn warning, so it never got up to pressure.  It finally got done and tasted good, but I could have made it faster on the stove.

Flavor was great but I kept getting the burn notice and had to turn the instant pot off. I followed the instructions exactly. I added more water and it still didn’t work. After 3 attempts I quit. The rice was done but a bit mushy.

Note to self:  Next time, read all of the reviews of a recipe before making it!  It turned out I was plagued by the same "burn" notice on my Instant Pot that others have noted.  I added a total of 32 oz of additional water to thin out the thick mix, but after three times of "burn", including dumping everything into a large standard pot so I could effectively scrape out the bottom if the Instant Pot, I gave up and just finished it in the standard pot on the stove top.  I didn't have quite enough sazon on hand as called for, and maybe that affected the taste -- because it was nothing to write home about.

Did exactly what the directions said. Kept getting burn notice, waste of time and money. The water ratio is incorrect for that much rice.

This recipe will not work in the newer Instant Pots. The sauce is too thick and registers the "burn" shut down. It's actually faster just to cook it on the stovetop in the traditional manner. Flavor-wise, it was all right but not spectacular as the arroz con gandules I used to have when I studied for a semester in Puerto Rico.

Note from the author of this recipe: UPDATE and trouble-shooting for those getting the burn notice. I developed and make this recipe with my 6 quart Instant Pot DUO (and never received the burn error while making it in that pot), but have since done some trouble-shooting with an 8-quart Instant Pot. If you are making it in an 8 quart pot, you will need to add more liquid to the recipe (measure the water with the juice from the gandules can to 3 cups instead of 2.5). Everyone should also make sure to scrape the bottom of the pot thoroughly with a wooden or plastic spoon (deglaze) before sealing and locking the lid. Finally, if you get the burn error after the pot has reached pressure, do NOT release pressure and open the pot. Keep the rice in the pot for the remaining amount of time (17 total minutes under pressure) before hitting cancel to start the natural release process. When doing this, the burn error actually went away for me once and the countdown was still going as if nothing happened. The burn error came back mid-way through, but the pot remained at pressure (the pin stayed up the whole time). After the 17 minutes plus 15 of NPR, I released the remaining pressure with QR like normal, and the rice turned out perfectly and was not burnt. 

Additionally, while this wasn’t included in the instructions for the published recipe, it is normal for the rice on the bottom to browned or even crisp. Puerto Ricans call it “Pegao” and it adds a great texture and flavor to the overa

I tried to make this and I kept getting the burn message. I gave up and tried to save it in a regular pot. It tasted great but it was mushy. Sad

This was up against my Cuban sister-in-laws Cuban rice & chicken, and the very 1st recipe I attempted. I’m happy to say that, aside from a little tweaking, This recipe definitely made the grade! I would use less spices, it was to much for my family. And they are not big fans of olives (which I love) or capers. Accordingly I would reduce to only 1/4 cup olives.

It tasted very good but I think it needs more water because 2 1/2 cups is not enough.
