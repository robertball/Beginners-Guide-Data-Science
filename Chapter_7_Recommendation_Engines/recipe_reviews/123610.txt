I really like this cookie.  Very different than the usual sugar, chocolate chip, etc.  I used ground pecans instead of ground almonds (it's just what I had).  They are a bit on the drier side, but my boys and I do not find that a bad thing (they have already eaten 2 each within minutes out of the oven).  My only suggestion would be to make a double batch.  This only made 18 or so cookies at 1" balls.  Also, we did not add the chocolate.  They seem to like them as-is.

Good cookie, easy to make...just nothing 'wow' about it. Looked cute with sprinkles on the chocolate part.
