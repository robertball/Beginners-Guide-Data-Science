DELICIOUS! The only changes I made were adding some finely chopped onion to the mix and coating them in seasoned breadcrumbs before frying. These are super flavorful and moist, and some of the best that I have made...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Yum! These have a fresh, wonderful flavor, my family loved them.  I did add a light outer coating of crushed saltines before frying, probably not necessary.

These are delicious but I think I'll add one egg to the mix to help it stay together. I also used panko bread crumbs instead of saltines, it added to the crunch including coatin g them in pankos.

What is up with those bones in canned salmon?  That said, I followed the recipe exactly and the patties were a HUGE success.  Delicious!  Will put this in rotation since it's only the fourth thing the whole family will eat!!!!  (and you really can't have wings every day......)

We loved this recipe! I used 3 small cans of Salmon. Made a Ketchup/hot sauce to dip. I did add a bit of finely diced onion & celery because I read it on another recipe, and got confused,lol. I sauteed the veggies before adding to the mixture. I think the spice listed was right on for us. Will make this again! Family loved it, thank you!

YUMMY!!!! Love this recipe. However I added some chopped onion in my mixture (onion is great in everything!!!!!) and instead of the red pepper flakes I used old bay seasoning. I also rolled mine in breadcrumbs for that crunchy coating. Prolly one of my favorite salmon patties recipe!

There were the best salmon patties I have ever had.  My mom makes salmon croquettes... so that is all I knew.  These were moist and very flavorful.  Will definitely make again.  The only change I made was I substituted panko for cracker crumbs.

I've made salmon patties over the years but never really cared much for them. These were quite good, however, very flavorful, and the three fish eaters in my family liked them (a couple kids won't eat any fish). I had two 14 oz cans and used them both. I added some liquid from the can. I added some chopped onion and garlic, and because I try to sneak in kale whenever I can, I added one big stalk of finely chopped kale. I didn't refrigerate them before cooking and they held together just fine. 
 Besides that, I followed the recipe. It made a lot more than what we ate for one meal, but will make good leftovers. Thanks for a good canned salmon recipe!

This was delicious, easy and the family devoured them.  I followed the recipe as indicated and got about nine patties. They were moist on the inside and golden crisp on the outside. I used wild pink Pacific Salmon (with the bones )  and my teenager didn't even notice she was getting her extra calcium. They blend right in. I can imagine lots of ways to serve these no matter what time of year. A great basic recipe that can be the foundation of many many meals. Thanks for sharing it!

The search is over!  I had the best Salmon Patties up in a little restaurant in Anchorage, Ak several years ago and have been trying to find one close to those.  This is it!  I followed the recipe to the letter and these were just wonderful.  Served with creamed peas and mashed potato.

Didn't have saltines, so used crushed cheese crackers. Also added some dill pickle relish. Simple and easy recipe. Great!

I'm not a fish person. At smoked salmon growing up. That was the only way I would eat it. My husband loves salmon patties so I decided to make this. I tried a tiny bite and ended up eating a whole patty. Great taste.

overall good recipe. The mixture holds together nicely. I found that 4 oz of panko bread crumbs was too much, not dry but not tender like I had hoped. Add a little salt and some minced onion. Served this with a mild chipotle mayo with a dash of lemon juice added. Delicious! my 2 yr old loved it so this is our version of fish sticks now.

These are great. I like using crackers instead of bread crumbs because to me it is a better texture.

These were good.  I added some parsley flakes and Parmesan cheese while cooking the patties.  While eating we used some hot sauce on them to add extra flavor.

Great recipe. I used leftover fresh baked salmon. I used cayenne instead of red pepper flakes. I also added a little bit of finely chopped sweet onion. They were fantastic. I will continue to use Jim's salmon patty recipe.

I was a bit scared at first that it wouldn’t hold together but it was excellent. Totally delicious. I put in a bit of minced onion and used bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs. I dusted with ritz cracker crumbs before frying.  I will certainly use this recipe over and over!

Moist and delicious! Don't be afraid to leave in all the bones and skin of the salmon -- they cook away and add nutrition.  I used fewer saltines in the patties and coated them lightly in very fine saltine crumbs before frying.  I also upped the oil by a tablespoon. Made a nice crisp crust.  The seasonings were right on.  A keeper!

These were pretty darn good. Easy to make and tasted pretty mellow. I served them with a chipotle aioli. I wish that I was warned about the bones in the cans of salmon. I spent an awful lot of time picking them out. I might try these again with cooked salmon rather than using the can again. Thanks JimChicago52!

LOVED this recipe! Followed recipe exactly. I have made salmon patties before but they were on the dry side. I was told by my mother-in-law to buy the cans of boneless, skinless salmon that were the same size as tuna cans. This time I bought a 14.5 oz can (brand name Demings)of salmon. You do have to take time to pick off some of the skin, the bones, etc but it was worth the time to me. It wasn't dry but very moist and had a much better flavor. Adding recipe to our recipe box!! Thank you.

These are awesome!  MAKE THEM!  MAKE THEM TONIGHT!!!
Yes, they are that good...  The only thing I did differently was to add the zest of the lemon I juiced for this recipe.

It's very tasty, but will definitely cut up a little onion in it next time. Also did not put the second call for salmon, just the 14 oz.

REALLY GOOD!!!! I made this but since I didn't have mayo I subbed Miracle Whip and with the substitution I left out the lemon juice. I also didn't add the red pepper flakes because my 3yr was going to be trying these. These turned out so well that I really enjoyed them and my 3yr old ate almost a whole patty it was a winner in our book.

Jim's Salmon Patties' Haiku: "These were just okay. Two things didn't jive with us. But we're glad we tried!" My only sub was Ritz crackers for saltines, otherwise, I followed the recipe as written, and formed and put the patties in the fridge for a few hrs. b4 cooking in the hopes that they would hold together well (they didn't.) That being said, that was our 1st disappointment - that they didn't quite retain their shape. We also didn't like the taste of Worcestershire and lemon juice in them, preferring some of the more "basic" salmon patty recipes that we've made on AR. Still, a sprinkle of Texas Pete hot sauce and a side salad, and we finished them all b/c I don't think the leftovers would've held together at all.

This recipe is ok ...  lacks onion and dill weed . .. I also used Ritz crackers instead of saltines.  These 3 extra ingredients mask the fishy taste. I also made a cream sauce .

My family loved the salmon cakes!!  I did two things different, instead of using saltine crackers I used plain flavored bread crumbs.  Also, once I mixed everything together I let the mixture sit overnight instead of 30 mins.  I made a honey mustard to go with it as well.  I will definitely be making this again!!!

Delicious!  The only change was I added chopped celery and onion.  I also created a sauce that my family likes.  Ketchup, Mayo, Soy Sauce. sweet pickle relish and ginger.

I have made this several times with no complications. I serve it with a dill sauce. The sauce is what makes this dish stick out to me and I love it! I omitted the dry mustard and I also breaded the patties with panko bread crumbs to make them slightly crispy. I used an organic sunflower/coconut oil mix for frying. Serve with green beans and sweet potato fries.

Really liked this recipe!  Here are my changes:  used two 14 oz cans of salmon, added half a red bell pepper, minced, used 2 tsp each Worcestershire and lemon juice.  These stayed together well.  Fried on each side till browned & crispy.  YUM.  The whole family enjoyed them!

Just made these for lunch.  Didn't have time to let the flavours "mingle" in the fridge before frying and they turned out great anyway.  Opted out of the red pepper flakes because I was feeding 2 toddlers.  Will make again.

This has become a regular rotation meal in my house - everyone loves it! Just the right amount of all seasonings, not too spicy, not too salty - just perfect! Sometimes I use them as salmon burger patties, other times on their own with southern homefries and peas - any way you serve them up this recipe is worth trying.

Really good flavor! I put this with a slaw that didn't go particularly well though, so I didn't get to enjoy the flavor as much as I would have liked. I also substituted crackers for bread crumbs to hold it together a bit better. I will make this again.

I really like this recipe. I did saute onions with garlic. I also used breadcrumbs instead saltine crackers. I did a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper and ground red pepper instead of red pepper flakes.

These were good. Batter seemed watery when I dropped them in the pan, but I used a spoon to drop a big spoonful in the hot pan and allowed them to fry a while. They began to hold together and I was able to flip them without falling apart. Needs a sauce to go with them though. Will make them again, very easy.

Great balance of flavors.  I was out of lemon juice so I used same amount of wine vinegar.  Was just fine.  Good salmon to breading balance.

I made them about a week ago and they were delicious!!!! I was VERY nervous about is because it was my very first time and this is some that you can really mess up or really make well. Oh! I’m a country girl so I put grits with them.  So I was EXTREMELY happy and so was my husband, who is my biggest critic!! He ate 2 1/2!!!!!

I only used 1 large can of salmon, 1 egg and 1/2 cup of cornmeal to hold mixture together. This made 4 patties for my husband and me. Plenty for one meal.

Great recipe, but I am a believer in onion and garlic in most savory recipes, thus I added the O &G, along with some dried parsley.  Delish!  Not a huge fan of salmon so I appreciated the fishy flavor that didn't scream out salmon.  Seemed like tartar sauce was the most compatible partner.  Highly recommend!  I didn't even have the extra 7 oz. can of salmon but it was still excellent.

Made as written and it's a very good recipe, but canned salmon is just gross. Why do they include those little chunks of soft bones in it? Next time, I'm using white tuna.
   

UPDATE:  I've tried it with the tuna (chunk white) and it's SO much better.  I also have started adding half of a vidalia onion (minced) and now use seasoned panko crumbs instead of the crackers.  Now it's a GREAT recipe.

I've made this several times with some minor modifications to avoid certain ingredients I try to limit in my diet.  I replace the cracker crumbs with ground flax seed and salt to taste and the mayonnaise with Greek yogurt.  I let the mixture sit for a while to let the flavors meld and the flax seed to soak it all up.  The flavors are spot on.  This is a very tasty salmon patty!  Thank you for sharing.

Loved these!  The only change I made was using horseradish instead of dry mustard, only because I didn't have any. This recipe goes into our 'favorite' recipe rotation.

first time making salmon patties...these were so easy and so good!  kids gave me a thumbs up. only change I made was paprika and a pinch of pepper flakes...along with using bacon grease leftover from breakfast...let it cool in a glas measuresing cup and used same amount as shortening...everything is better with bacon right?  definitely a keeper, and will make again!

These were delicious, definitely will make them again! FYI: The six patties will feed three hungry adults. I'd go lighter on the dry mustard. Add more red pepper if you like spicy things.

This is one of the least changed recipes in my repertoire and a regular meal in my house.  That being said, I did make just a few adjustments to make it work for the picky eaters of the house (which is both of us).  We nixed the red pepper flakes, used Ritz instead of saltines, and will usually bake these instead of frying.  I have fried them and they are delicious, but an incident with a slippery spatula and a face full of splashed cooking oil (which hadn't heated up much yet, lucky me) made me consider baking them and we've done it that way ever since.  Pop them in the oven at 425, give them ten minutes per side, and they come out just as delicious as ever, minus the danger of hot oil for those of us that can be clumsy occasionally in the kitchen.

These are the best salmon patties I've had. I doubled the recipe & made it as instructed with the exception of using dried eggs and only 3/4 of 1 sleeve of crackers. I let the mix sit 24 hrs, then fried them in a little bit of canola oil. They had a bit of crunch on the outside, even without dredging in anything. The heat from the peppers leaves a good "after-burn". I served them with the "Tangy Tartar Sauce" & "Twice Baked Yams" from this site, which made a delicious meal. Thank's for this recipe, Jim.

This was amazing! It was my first time making salmon patties and I will defiantly be making these again. The only thing I changed was I added some diced onions. I also made a lemon dill mayo sauce that went extremely well with the salmon patties.

My adult son, that is not a real fish lover, thought these were very good.

An easy recipe with good results. The quantity made way more than 6 patties, and was a little dry.

Very good recipe!! The only thing I did different was to coat them with Panko before frying for an added crunch. Will make these again!!

Seemingly perfect blend of ingredients. Nothing was overpowering. Just simple and nice.
