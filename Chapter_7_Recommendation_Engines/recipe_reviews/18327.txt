This is my favorite recipe that I have found at allrecipes.com - I fell in love with it when I was making (and tasting) the sauce! The sauce is AMAZING and so delicious, really to die for, and it *makes* the dish. The sauce is the perfect combination of sweet and salty, aromatic and delightful. I make this in huge batches and I add cherry tomatoes, blanched snap peas, baby carrots, and celery. We eat it as the main course, and we have yummy leftovers for the day after. I have made this recipe over and over again.

I've received many compliments on this recipe, having served it a few times.  I would only alter a few things:  add julienned carrots, sliced water chestnuts and pea pods cut in half on an angle- really adds nice color, texture and flavor.  Knock oil down to 1/3 cup otherwise it is REALLY oily.  I use fettucine noddles.  If you are making this ahead and chilling it (which I would recommend), add half of the dressing while noodles are still warm and will soak up flavor. MMM! Toss the other half of the dressing before serving.  I like it warm OR cold, but feel it is better cold.  Still great the next day.  Will make again and again!!

To DIE for! I reduced the oil to 1/3 cup to make it lower in fat, added a cup of frozen cooked peas and 2 chopped Roma tomatoes for some veggies. Since I love cilantro so much, I increased it to 1/2 cup. The dressing was just amazing! Thanks so much for the recipe!

liked the flavor of this and am a huge fan of cilantro, but this is deffinately a dish I would leave it out!  The green onions with the sesame sauce is perfect.  You're in better luck when using chunks of chicken, shredded makes the salad a little messy.  You can eat this hot or cold its great!

second review-  this recipe gets better and better as you make it!  I'm eating low carb so today I made this (still left the cilantro out) with low carb linguini (snapped them in half so they are short noodles) made the sauce with olive oil instead of vegetable oil, used splenda instead of regular sugar and added vegetables to the green onion like some bok choy, whole canned mushrooms, sugar snap peas, water chestnuts and julianned carrots.  INCREDIBLE!!  I love this stuff hot and cold.  I usually bring a container to work and tend to eat it hot, but by the time its lunch and I'm ready to do that, its gone!  great meal and great dish to bring to a party.

I loved this recipe but had to add vegetables.  I added cashew halves,, red, yellow, and orange bell pepper, pea pods, carrots, celery, and fresh corn.  I also decreased the amount of oil in the recipe and used rice wine and not vinegar.  I substituted fresh ginger for powdered and added a touch of lime juice.  It is very pretty and tasty!  It is now a staple for my family at picnics!

This is a great recipe to build on for your own personal preferences.  I cut the oil back to 1/3 cup as the first time I made this is was just to oily. Everything else remained the same.  Dressed the salad with 1/2 the dressing mix while the noodles were still warm to absorb the great flavors.  Saved the last half to dress again right before serving.  Added blanched and juilenned carrots, waterchestnuts for crunch, marinated mushrooms and snowpeas cut on the diagonal for color and presentation.   Beautiful salad!

I  made this for a picnic yesterday and it was wonderful!  Everyone enjoyed it.  One of the things I liked so much is that it was very light on a hot day.  I followed the advice of several people and used olive oil and only used half the amount.  I wondered if it was going to be dry not using all the liquid but it wasn't in the least.  In fact, I think if you used all the oil the pasta would be swimming. I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe Olivia!

Delicious!  Would even be good without the chicken for a vegetarian dish.  I added grated carrots for color.

Wow - I'll never buy the store-made sesame pasta salad again! Didn't use chicken, and didn't have ground ginger, but this recipe was GREAT. The green onions & cilantro add a great kick to the pasta. It's good to let the salad chill for at least 30 min. before serving so all the flavors can fuse together.

Good sidesish...I'm glad I cut the vegetable oil to 1/4 cup as it was more than enough.  I also added half red and green bell pepper, chopped. It is a different type of pasta salad and IF I made it again, I might try adding some toasted ramen noodles for some crunch because it tastes just like a pasta version of "asian salad," also found on this site, which is what I think I'll stick with instead of this one. Thanks anyways!

This is a great basic recipe which you can tweak for your own tastes. Took the advice of some reviewers and reduced the oil (evoo) and added a little chili oil for a kick. Also added a clove of garlic.  Poured some of the dressing on warm noodles; also marinated some chicken breasts in the dressing before cooking. Finally, took fresh snow peas and put them in the bottom of a colander, then poured cooked pasta over them to blanch them. Finished up by adding some red bell pepper for flavor and color. Really enjoyed the result.

Excellent! I toasted the sesame seeds, lightly, then set it aside. I reduced the oil to 1/3 cup (3T) and the sugar to 1 1/2 Tablespoons. I think that 3T sugar would make the dressing too sweet. I also added fresh grated ginger to the dressing. I poured half of the dressing over the cooked spiral pasta to let the it absorb the flavors. I placed the the pasta and other half of salad dressing in the refrigerator until ready to serve. I had some leftover rotisserie chicken so I chopped that up. This salad is versatile and can be adjusted to other vegetables. For color, flavor and texture, I added sugar snap peas (par boiled), cherry tomatoes, halved, and carrots, julienned.  I poured the remainder of the dressing over the pasta along with the chicken and vegetables then tossed to coat evenly. I garnished the pasta salad with chopped green onions and cilantro. To me the salad dressing is the star -very light yet flavorful with an "Asian" flair! The dressing is not too sweet or oily. Everything is seasoned perfectly with a subtle sweetness, little "tang" and fresh flavors. I loved the crunch of the sugar snap peas and carrots. The cherry tomatoes are naturally sweet and brightens up the pasta as well. The cilantro adds a lovely flavor. This salad is appealing, delicious and satisfying! It is perfect for a hot and humid day like today in Hawaii! I also served, "Bruce's Honey Sesame Bread, " also from this website.

Who knew that you could make such an awesome Asian pasta salad at home?!?!  After reading the "most helpful" reviews, I decided to make a few changes.  First, decrease the oil to 1/3 cup.  Someone recommended to omit the cilantro & I think that would be a BIG mistake.  This dish screams for some freshness, and the cilantro is perfect.  I felt that it really needed some veggies, so I added some shredded carrots, sliced cucumber (halved & seeded), and blanched snow peas.  Each of them add great crunch.  I cut the snow peas and green onion on a diagonal for some flare.  I thought it was strange that the recipe called for bow tie pasta.  Lo Mein noodles seemed like the most natural and perfect fit to me.  You can find them in the Asian isle at your supermarket.  That was definitely the most important change to make it feel authentic.  I also made it easy on myself by purchasing an already cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store & cubing the meat.  I just made it and can already tell that it will be even better when it has a chance to cool down.  Make it with the above changes and you will NOT be disappointed!!!

This was really tasty and unique.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and wouldn't change anything next time around.  I did keep the noodles separate from the chicken for leftovers so things wouldn't get soggy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought the flavor was fine, but as other reviewers suggested, the addition of snow peas, water chestnuts, etc. would definitely help out an otherwise pretty plain looking pasta salad.  The problem I had with it that no one else commented on is that because the dressing is a liquid base and not creamy, it doesn't stick to the pasta at all.  When I was done mixing it, the dressing immediately just kind of sank to the bottom of the bowl.  I think the recipe is certainly worth playing around with; I think I'll trying heating the dressing ingredients on the stove and add just a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up so that it stays on the bow tie pasta. I'm giving some to my husband in his lunch tomorrow for work, and I've already warned him to make sure he stirs it before he eats it, because all the dressing will be in the bottom of the container.

I know some hate when a review is posted and you change the recipe, but this was such a good starting point, I think it deserves a 5.  What I did differently:  used about a 1/4 cup sesame oil, low-sodium tamari sauce, fresh ginger juice, and agave nectar in the dressing.  And for the veggies:  sliced green onions, thinly-sliced yellow and red pepper, shaved carrots, and edamame.  I also used black toasted sesame seeds.  It's a beautiful and very tasty dish.  I made for lunch and ate warm.  Now it's going in the fridge for tomorrow's lunch cold and we'll see which way I prefer it.  Oh, I also omitted the cilantro--can't stand the stuff.  : )

Great dish!  I added mandarin oranges.  I also cut back to 1/4 cup vegetable oil and did not add the cilantro.  I didn't have any rice vinegar, so I substituted apple cider vinegar.  It was delicious!

This was very, very good.  I added some julienne slices of carrots and some sugar snap peas, which I lightly steamed.  I also added the water chestnuts, but I would leave them out next time.  Not a fan.  The sauce is very tasty, and the flavors in the dish complimented each other.  Will make again soon!

Terrific! I did leave out the sesame oil since it was the only thing I did not have on hand, I also use dried cilantro which I added when I sauteed the chicken. I also replaced the vegetable oil with extra light olive oil you can not taste a diffrence but it is so much healthier for you. My kids had 3rds. The only change we would make is to saute the green onion with the chicken since 2 out of 5 of us found it to be a bit to strong raw. This is a new summer staple.

I made this for dinner yesterday and my husband and I couldn't quit eating it, the dressing is so yummy! I woke up this morning wondering if it would be good for breakfast. I followed the recipe exactly other than cutting the oil to 1/3 cup and adding some fresh veggies, per some of the other reviewers.

I made this for a summer bbq party with vegetarians present.  I omitted the chicken and added slivered carrots and par cooked flat beans.  I would mix the salad with the dressing at the last minute and make 1/2 receipe more dressing.  Great recipe, I will make this again.  Thanks

Delicious! Pasta salads don't usually excite me, but this one has such great reviews, I decided to try it. I love cilantro and so I knew it couldn't be all bad, and it's perfect! I'm glad I followed the other reviews and cut the oil back to 1/3 cup. Like other reviewers, I also added grated carrot, fresh ginger, diced red bell pepper, and sugar snap peas. This is exactly what I'm looking for to take in my lunch! Thanks for the recipe and the helpful reviews. Another AR winner.

Wow, what a delicious recipe!  I subbed spaghetti strings for the bowtie pasta, used 1/4 c. light tasting extra virgin olive oil instead of veg. oil, and added some LaChoy Garlic Ginger Marinade to compensate for the oil.   I thinly sliced a raw carrot to add crunchiness.  I cut 2 ch. breasts into small pieces and panfried them.  Left out the cilantro because I didn't have any.  Next time, I'll add some cashews for more crunch as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks for the recipe, Ohines!

This recipe lacked a lot of flavor. I made the dressing per the instructions and it tasted good on it's own but it was not enough flavor when added to the pasta. We punched it up by adding juice from 1/2 lemon , a couple of cloves of crushed garlic, 1/2 tsp cheyenne pepper, dash of red pepper flakes and 1/8 tsp of cumin.  also added peanuts it really made a difference in my salad.

This pasta salad is fantastic and different.  I added some chopped yellow pepper for some crunch and color.  Other than that... I cut back on the oil & sugar, and used sugar substitute to cut calories.  THanks for sharing!

The first time I made this, I followed the directions exactly and thought it was pretty plain.  I wasn't going to ever make it again, but I had to make dinner on the fly and thought I would give this another chance, with modifications.  This recipe is definitely not 5 stars on its own.  Many reviewers added veggies because it just falls flat when made as is.  I added shredded carrots, chopped green onions, sweet peas, and crushed roasted peanuts.  I also seasoned the chicken with onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and fresh ground peppercorn melange before cooking, and I added garlic powder and red pepper flakes to the sauce.  More seasonings and vegetables make this much more pleasing to the palate.

Love this recipe.  Use shrimp instead of chicken.  Have taken this to many barbeques. Let marinate overnight.

This turned out great.  However, I'm not a huge cilantro fan so I'll leave it out next time.  I didn't think it blended very well with the asian flavor either but my husband loved it.  I too added shredded carrots which added to it's flavor but it also added some color.  I also decreased the oil to 1/4 cup which was plenty.  I thought it tasted better served right away than it did as a refrigerated leftover - it lost a lot of its flavor.  Great recipe though.  Thanks.  Oh yeah, the sesame seeds are a must!

This is very similar to my favorite recipe for chinese chicken salad.  Instead of pasta, I use coleslaw mix and crushed ramen noodles.  I add the flavor packets to the dressing mix and add cut baby corn, mandarin oranges and sliced snow peas when in season.  Delicious!

I made this for dinner last night, it sounded a little bit iffy but I gave it a go anyway. I reduced the oil, added veggies, and otherwise kept the recipe the same. The pasta was so the wrong choice and the sauce was way too salty. My husband and daughter thought it was not too bad.

Decreased the oil to 1/3 cup and added diced red and yellow peppers to the mix.  Will add pea pods and baby corn next time.  This was really yummy.

This was good, but it was very "one note" for us.  I added some red pepper flakes on my plate, and that helped. Nuts perhaps might add to it, crispy oriental noodles maybe... grapes?  Something that will add another layer.  It really was good, but it needed something to perhaps take it to the next level.  Thank you for sharing!

Very yummy! Instead of stirring the coriander through the salad. I put all the dressing ingrediants into the food precessor with the coriander and half a small red onion. Then mixed through salad. Was very yummy- my husband loved it. Really good if you let it marinate for several hours before eating! The chicken soaks up all the yummy flavours=)

This is really good.  I made it for lunch.  I don't like cilantro, so didn't add that.  The only thing I would add would be some carrots.  I just think they would match well with the dressing.  I used some Louis Rich pre-cooked chicken and it didn't have much flavor, hopefully it will get some after sitting for a little while.  I will make again for sure though because it was super easy, fast and tasty.

Delish!  I lessened the amount of oil like other reviewers have  said.  Kids liked it with just chicken, but I added the green scallions and thinly julienned cabbage that added a nice crunch factor.  I will definitely make this again without hesitation!

Great dish!! Cooked the chicken in a crock pot while at work to make assembly easier.  I poured 1/2 of the dressing, again only 1/3 cup oil, over Bow tie noodles after draining to absorb the dressing. I also used Splenda and you really cannot tell a difference. This is really good.

I came home today and made this for dinner.  It was great; made just as written except I cut in half.  Just me and my husband.  Its wonderful.  I added pine nuts and it added a unique flavor to the recipe.  I did not shredd the chicken I diced it before I cooked it and sautaed in sesame oil and butter; with garlic powder and season salt.  Then chopped again - into small peices.  YUMMY

I've made this a couple of times and it's really good.  I brought it to a family pot luck and it was gone pretty quickly.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe but it was pretty oily and it needed more dressing and flavor.  The second time I made it I doubled the ingredients for the dressing but left the amount of oil at a 1/2 cup and the sugar at 3 tablespoons.  I also toasted the sesame seeds.  It was perfect.  I also added some  snow peas, napa cabbage, and red bell pepper.  It was delicious.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Wow!  This is my new favorite pasta salad.  My husband loved it too.  I followed reviewers advice and used 1/4 cup olive oil instead of a 1/2 cup of vegetable oil and it was wonderful.  I can't wait to make this for friends.

This was really good. By the 3rd day it tasted the best. Next time I might add extra soy and sesame oil because it was a little mild. I think that's why it tasted better the longer it marinated. I did cut the oil to 1/3 which was perfect, but I didn't use an entire box of pasta.

This was a delicious pasta salad!  I am only giving it 4 stars because it required a few modifications:  I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and added some veggies - snow peas, carrots, and sweet peas.  I also reduced the sugar to 1 tablespoon.  It would also be great with toasted almonds, mandarin oranges, or crushed ramen noodles.  While the adults in the house loved the salad, my kids did not - I think the flavor was just a little too strong.  I really loved this salad and will be making it again!

Delicious! Instead of shredding the chicken, I cubed two boneless breasts amd marinated the chicken w soy sauce, wine vinegar and chopped garlic.  After about 20 min, I stir fried the chicken until cooked-about 7 min. and added to the pasta salad.

This was a great side dish recipe.  I ended up making the dressing twice.  Since I was making it for a potluck picnic, I put the dressing on it before packing it and then realized I was going to need more.  Those that tried it, loved it!  Some said it needed more dressing, so I was glad I had a second batch on hand.  I would definitely make this again.

Excellent even with my alterations!  Didn't have sesame seeds so I toasted slivered almonds which gave it a delicous crunchy flavor!  Also, as other reviews suggested, I cut the oil to 1/4 cup and used olive oil. Since I didn't have green onions, I used a small handful of chives from the garden and added some diced red onion for flavor.  I also added some chunks of cucumber, and I think next time, some bean sprouts would be very good as well.  I served it on a bed of garden lettuce.  My 10 year old daughter said it was the best salad she's ever eaten, and I plan to make a batch to take to the cottage this weekend!  Thank you Olivia!

Hi all. This looks great. Easy. Dying to try it. Question - Nowhere in the "preparation/method" section of this recipe did it mention when to add the 1/4 c. of toasted sesame seeds. When does that happen? Do you mix w/the vinaigrette? Add at the end w/the chicken and greens? HELP!!! Please advise! Thanks.

We had a contest at our family reunion for the best salad. I thought I would win with this one, but it was gone before the judges could sample it! I love the sesame flavor and the hint of sweetness. I wouldn't change a thing.

This was great but I made a few changes I love pasta dishes so I made this as a main dish as others said I cut the oil to 1\3 of a cup ad some veggies as bean sprouts snap peas and baby carrots and when I made the sauce I add a little chili paste and made about 1.5 batches of sauce. I cook the diced chicken then add my veggies except for the snap peas, add my sauce and finally the pasta and peas once I plated I drizzle a little siriacha and it was so delicious.

Delicious recipe that is pretty and tastes delicious.  I used the full amount of oil but would cut it down a bit next time for my tastes.  I added in snow peas, chopped red bell pepper and sliced carrots.  The cilantro is what makes this dish so don't leave it out.

We loved this - hubby says it's on the keeper list. I made it as directed, only I accidentally grabbed parsley instead of cilantro. Maybe that was good because my husband hate cilantro - I love it. Next time I'll add more veggies - tomatoes, mushrooms, zucchini, squash, onions, carrots, whatever - would be great. I may have added a little more chicken - it's what I had. I think beef would work, or maybe shrimp. The chicken was just right.  The dressing is really good. I had some toasted sesame seeds, but I think I like them better when I toast them myself. Overall this is a fabulous recipe and one we will be having often! Oh, it's very easy and could be done ahead of time - important for my busy family.

This is so good!!  My 2 1/2 year old daughter was saying yum as she ate it.  The only change I made was I used 1/3 c olive oil and I used leftover chicken taken off the bone satued with mined garlic.  YUM!!  Thanks for sharing.

Good! It gets better after chilling for a while and allowing the flavors to meld, but my husband and I both agreed it is missing *something*. I might add a little diced jalapeno or some crushed red pepper flakes to give it some zing. I did add snow peas and halved grape tomatoes which added some nice color and texture. Thanks!

Delicious so far! Just made it and put in the fridge. I used a whole rotisseie chicken, shredded. I added one red pepper, diced small, and one 8 oz package of sugar snap peas, cut into thirds. Added great color and crunch. Based on all the other reviews I'm expecting this to be even better in a few hours!

YUM! As everyone else has said, the sauce makes it. Based on reviews I only added 1/4 cup vegetable oil, but followed the rest of the recipe to the tee because I didn't have any other vegetables to add to it. We had it for dinner last night and it was delicious. But, as others have said, it is best the next day. I'm having it for lunch today and have already snuck a little bite...hmmmm good.

Made this yesterday for a party and every person present wanted the recipe.  I sent some with my husband for his lunch at work and he LOVED it.  The only changes I made were to use fresh grated ginger, and I added shredded carrots, diced red pepper, and cooked frozen peas.  The cilantro did really complement the flavors.  I also followed one reviewer's advice to add half the sauce when it was warm and then stir the rest in just before serving.  It helped bring out the flavors.  Next time I'll cook the chicken in a little to give it even more flavor.

Sorry but I can only give this 2 stars as I thought it was quite bland.  It had a dark color to it which really didn't look attractive and just simply not much taste.  Wondering if it had something to do with the low sodium soy sauce?

Wonderful flavor!  My husband has no problem letting me know if a recipe is a keeper or not.  This recipe had him saying "This is a keeper, honey!" after every few bites.  I did modify it slightly - did not use green onions, had fresh ginger on hand so used that in the dressing.  When I served it (cold), I topped it with some mandarin oranges and toasted sliced almonds and placed it on a bed of chopped bok choy for some veggies.  I will be making this again . . . SOON!

One of my absolute favorite recipes. I haven't met anyone who thought it was less than amazing.  Try adding some frozen peas for a twist.

Very tasty!  I modified the recipe- reducing the oil to 1/4 cup (next time I will use a lighter tasting oil like olive rather than vegetable), used only 1/4 c. soy sauce b/c I only have reg. (not reduced sodium), omitted the cilantro because I don't like the taste (although I can see what it would add) and added some lightly steamed broccoli and chopped orange peppers.  I also added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for zip. And I didn't shred the chicken, I sliced it. It was great after a little while in the fridge (cold) but I bet it will be even better tomorrow!  It makes a lot of pasta.  And in my experience, order of operations isn't that important, just mix it all up and chill well!
I revise what I had said earlier, this was better heated!

Very good recipe. Better if you let it sit overnight in the fridge so that the pasta takes on more flavor from the dressing. I served grilled marinated chicken breasts separately. Next time I will try as other have suggested and add some mandarin oranges and crispy ricen noodles. Thanks for the recipe.

This dish is very good but I made the mistake of serving it as the main dish.  Not particulary good on it's own but would be perfect to take to a picnic or for a change of pace, serve instead of fried rice with a Chinese meal.  I took previous reviewers' recommendations and cut back some on the oil (I used canola) and it tasted fine.

Excellent.  I substituted left over Thanksgiving turkey for the chicken.  I think adding canned mandarine oranges would be great.  Also I'd probably sprinkle on some crunchy chinese noodles to each serving or serve them on the side for added crunch.  I will definitely make this again.

This is a wonderful Pasta Salad. I have taken it to several potlucks and everyone likes it, even kids. I personally added more rice vinager and less oil (and used olive oil instead of veg.) but I tend to like things on the vinager side. Those were the only changes I made to the recipie.

Very easy to make however turned out a little dry.  I reduced the oil because of other reviews which stated it was too oily.  Next time I'll wait until it's time to serve and then add the dressing do it's not too dry.  Otherwise it was very good, will definitely make again.

This was good.  I ommited the onion and cilantro.  I made the dressing ahead which made it easy to throw together.  I served it right a way.  We did not like it the next day.  I will make this again.  Just cut the recipe in half if you don't want left overs like us.

yum! be warned, this makes a lot of pasta.  i took heed of the suggestions and cut the oil to 1/4cup and it was plenty.  it looked very plain and bland so i added 1 cup of fresh steamed green beans, cut on the diagonal, and 4 carrots finely shredded to give it some color, but omitted the cilantro.  the flavor was excellent.  if you like sesame chicken at chinese restaurants, you will love this.  thanks to olivia for a great recipe!

Really good. I sauteed the chicken in sesame oil, too, which gave it a really good flavor. It was slightly too oily for my taste...I would reduce the oil a little next time.

This reminds me of a pasta salad I used to love and go out of my way to get when I was in college. Its got a good balance of sweet, and tangy. I reduced the oil to 1/3 cup based on other reviewers, and would omit the toasted sesame seeds next time even though its "sesame pasta chicken salad", I didn't like it texturally. I did, however, use lots of crunchy veggies like red and green bell peppers, celery, and finely grated carrots for color mostly. The final touch was 2 diced ambrosia apples. Their flavor is light, not overly sweet or tart, a great vessel for the dressing and added a little extra "something". Loved it. My kids begged me to take the leftovers to school for lunch. Thank you for such a yummy and nostalgic recipe.

I was looking for something quick and easy to make for lunch with canned chicken and this recipe was a big hit! Very tasty and very filling. The recipe calls for bow tie noodles but I used the spirals as the picture shows and it worked out great. Very yummy, I will definitely make it again!

Great recipe! I really loved the flavours,  so did my husband. My 5 year old was not a fan though. I knew it would be a gamble with him given the strong flavour of sesame oil. But you never know unless you present different things! For hubby and I, I added chili pepper flakes to offset the sweetness. I also added some julienned bell peppers for flavour and crunch. We had some leftover grilled chicken to use up so this recipe was handy. It's quick, tasty, and simple to make. To ensure the dressing doesn't sit on the bottom, don't rinse the pasta. Put the dressing on while the noodles are still warm, then refrigerate the pasta salad for at least 2 hours, stirring after 1 hour. It coats well and distributes evenly. I used the conversion on All Recipes to half the recipe; it was perfect for 4 servings and there's enough left over for one lunch. This dish is good cold and warm. I could hardly stay out of it before putting it in the fridge to chill!

Just finished making this recipe, it's a keeper! After reading other reviews used a little less oil and added baby corn and cabbage for a little crunch... otherwise followed recipe as written. Thanks for sharing ohines!

Very delicious!!! I had to quickly put together a lunch so, I didn't have cilantro or green onion. I definitely think it would be even better with both. I cut two chicken breasts into bite size pieces and sauteed with garlic and onion powder and more ground ginger. Then I decided to add about 2Tbsp of peanut butter to the cooked chicken. Then I mixed it into the dressed pasta with julienned carrots, cashews, and water chestnuts. So, yummy!
FYI: I did love the dressing on its own and I'm not sure if the peanut butter really added much.

Far too much oil and make sure you use toasted sesame oil.  Regular doesn't have any flavor.  Even better when you add some crunchy fresh and asian veggies like broccoli florets, sliced water chestnuts, sliced snow peas, julienned carrots, fresh spring peas...use your imagination.  Delicious!

This is awesome! Don't make the mistake of tasting the dressing before putting it on the pasta and chicken. It tastes really strong alone but is great in the salad. I also added veggies. Versatile, light, delicious.

Simple yet so good! The dressing is perfect, if, like other reviewers said, you reduce the oil by a little bit. I also added some matchstick carrots for a bit of crunch and to sneak in some more servings of veggies. This is something I'll make a big batch of and pack for my workday lunches. Yummy, easy, satisfying recipe!

I used this dressing to dress my Chinese style chicken salad, and found it to be absolutely delicious. A friend stopped by and tasted it and begged for the recipe, it's that good! Next time I will try the pasta salad, but from now on, this will be my Asian salad dressing of choice no matter what kind of salad I'm making.

This was great!  I think it would taste excellent with tofu as a vegetarian alternative (just make sure you wrap up the tofu in a towel, put it between two dishes, with something heavy on top, to drain out excess water).   Minor changes-  I sauteed the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper.  I added extra garlic powder and onion powder to the salad later (I felt they added good extra flavor). I lowered the sugar in half (just trying to make it more healthy, didn't miss the extra sugar at all....  ).  Added the sesame seeds in raw/plain (in other words, did not need to use the vegetable oil to toast them....   again, did not miss the extra oil/toasting).  I'll make this one again-  it was tasty and with modifications, pretty healthy!   Also wanted to add, i feel the oil is too much---- i feel halving the vegetable oil would be wise.  Hence why i give this one a 4/5.  if the oil had been closer to par, i would've given it a 5.  And yes, i will gladly make it again!

Loved this!! Following advice of many reviewers, I cut the oil to 1/4 cup and think I could have used even less. I added grated carrots for a little color and mixed with half the dressing while pasta was hot and the other half the next day before serving. Love it cold- even better flavor the second day. Will make VERY often. Served at a party and had many guests ask for the recipe!

This came out absolutely delish I only added tomatoes but followed everything to a T. I think next time I'll use less pasta & I only used 12oz and it was a bit much. This is great for a potluck. Yum Yum the celantro is what gave it its kick!

As others suggested, I added some veggies - carrots and snap peas. Otherwise made it as written this time. It's slightly oily so next time I will cut down a bit on the veg oil, but there will be a next time!!! This is really delicious! I can't wait to share it at work tomorrow!!

Great Asian flavor. I did reduce the oil as others suggested and only used 12 oz of pasta. Then, I added some shaved carrots for texture and color. Everyone loved it. And, it was easy to make, too.

We loved it! I doubled the dressing and the amount of chicken. I love cilantro so I tripled that. I made it a day ahead with half the sauce on it then added the other half of the dressing when I served it.

This was so good and so easy.  My husband just loved it.  I halved the recipe and it was enough for three meals for two people.  It was even better after a night in the fridge.  Make sure the pasta is cooked al dente so it won't get mushy in the dressing.

Delicious, but tastes a little sweet even though I cut down on the sugar. I would halve the sugar, then add more to taste. The fresh cilantro is a must! I will make this again and put in some diced sweet peppers.

A wonderful salad for a nice summer evening!  I added additional vegetables (chopped tomatoes, diced carrots, etc) and could have easily left out the chicken if I wanted to make this even quicker.  Perfect!

Excellent! If you like Asian flavors, you will love this recipe.  I made the recipe exact to the instructions.  I did cheat a litte, and used a precooked rotisserie chicken, and shredded the meat from it. It made this recipe very quick to make.  I have a few family members that are vegetarian, and I think they could substitute this chicken for steamed broccoli or tofu.  I will be making this recipe again and again!

I really thought this salad was a nice change from regular pasta salads.  The recipe has potential for being 5 stars.  Next time I make it I will: 1)decrease sugar to 2 T. 2)increase soy sauce to 1/2 c 3)use fresh ginger vs. ground 4)use less sesame seeds and 5) use 1/3 c oil.  My family wasn't crazy about it, but I thought it was delicious!

Such a great summer time salad!  I have made this a couple of times now as is and loved it, but after reading some of the reviews, adding shredded carrots, blanched snow peas, etc. would enhance the salads flavors, since it is a bit on the plain side, but so good!

I thought this was terrific.  i followed the recipe  but since I was in the grocery store, bought some shredded carrots from the salad bar and added those along with some snow peas.  It was so good.  I know that this will be my choice the next time I am asked to bring a dish to a pot luck!  Thanks for posting this.

I just made this tonight along with Firecracker Grilled Alaska Salmon; both had an Asian flavor I was craving.  This recipe is very forgiving, and thus will become a staple in my collection!  I omitted the cilantro and green onions (didn't have on hand), used fresh ginger, and traded olive oil for the veggie oil (eyeballed amount), per another reviewer's suggestion. I also subbed some of the rice vinegar with yummy white wine.  Since I used grilled salmon infused with it's own flavor, I could see why you'd need to season the chicken before adding it to the pasta. Overall, delicious! Just add more salt, fresh ginger, or sesame seeds to your liking. Thanks for a healthier pasta recipe!

This was a good base recipe. I made it with the idea that my daughter could take it for lunch. I liked it but none of my kids would eat it (my 4yr said it smelled funny). I did not change the sauce in any way but I added carrots and edamame for color. This didn't have the asian flavor I was expecting but was a good start. I think next time I'll use brown sugar and doctor it a little more to my taste. I would have given it 4 stars but my kids did not enjoy it at all and that was the whole reason I tried it.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly.  It was okay but much too oily and it needed some vegetables.

The second time I made this I used whole wheat pasta, cut the vegetable oil down to an 1/8 of a cup but added a few dashes of hot chili oil.  I also added about two cups total of steamed sliced celery and julienned carrots.  I used a whole chicken instead of just breast meat and left out the cilantro because it didn't do it for me the first time around.

I think most of the changes were for the best.  The whole wheat pasta had a less than ideal texture cold but it was good hot.

Cut down on the oil to a 1/4 cup and had plenty sauce to coat the pasta. This recipe would be great with sliced carrots and other veggies like sugar snap peas and red peppers.

This is yummy!  I cut back on the vegetable oil (1/4 cup) and was happy that I did.  Hot or cold - this is a very good dish.

Good but I definitely missed having something crunchy.  I added a cooked red bell pepper, carrots, and sugar snap peas to make it really good.

Overall, I liked this, however I only used about 2/3 of the amount of pasta called for, and I increased the chicken to 4 cups, otherwise it would have been more pasta than anything. I didn't have sesame oil so I didn't use it. It may have helped give it more flavor had I used it. It wasn't bland, but it didn't have as much taste as I'd have liked. I made it a day in advance, so before serving it, I mixed in a little more rice wine vinegar (would have added a little more soy sauce too, but I was out), and I toasted some sliced almonds to sprinkle on top to give it some crunch since the sesame seeds were a little soggy by the next day. In general though, it was good...everyone liked it.

Not a dish I would make again. I used the mini bow tie pasta - a little easier to eat Added snow peas and matchstick carrots - glad I did. I used 1/3 cup of oil and it still was kind of oily - even after sitting overnight. I followed a few reviewers tips and added half of the dressing the night before then the rest a few hours before serving. My biggest complaint with the recipe is that it wasn't very flavorful. I considered making more dressing minus the oil but I was worried about over doing it. I also followed some reviewers suggestion of marinating the chicken in the same dressing and the chicken was actually very good - so I was so dissapointed that this didn't turn out.

I thought this salad was good. However it was a little greasy and I wish I would have cut down on the amount of oil. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I put bbq chicken on top instead of shredded chicken.

This is a great recipe and has been added to our monthly recipe rotation.  Very versatile depending on ingredients on hand.  As others have said reduce oil to 1/3.  Also, only use half the dressing when first mixing together.    For those of you not using the sesame oil or poppy seeds it does make a big difference.  If too expensive look in the Mexican and Chinese sections of your grocery store.  Both items will be there at reduced rates.  (Ex: sesame oil in regular oil section is $7.99, but in the Chinese section a slightly smaller bottle is only $2.99 - a little goes a long way so get the smaller bottle)

this recipe is absolutely wonderful!  super easy to make and truly delicious.  my husband actually said the words "THIS IS GOOD!" about this dish, which is quite the compliment from him.  (i'm generally lucky to get an "it's aiiight"...which means he would eat it again).  many thanks for sharing this recipe!  i will definitely make it again.

I just don't get all the rave reviews!  I consider myself a good, creative cook, but this was boring if you followed the recipe!  Everyone had to make changes to make it "good"!  I liked the concept and will fiddle with it myself, but as is, I'd say mediocre at best.  Sorry!

Wow! DEE-LISH dish!! The only changes I made was to scale down to 5 servings, add some peas and saute the onions for my husband who doesn't like them crunchy. Leftovers were gone the next day by lunchtime!

My husband says this is the best pasta salad he's ever had.  I added a can of mandarin oranges but 2 would probably have been better.  This will be a regular at our house especially in the summer.  Very quick and easy.

I thought this was really delicious...very good combination of flavors, but a little oily. I followed advice given by other reviews and reduced oil to 1/3 cup. I also added chili paste for some spice and carrots, red pepper, broccoli and cashews for some color/crunch. I will definately make this again (although it made a complete mess of the kitchen).

The taste was exactly what I was hoping for when I came across this recipe.  It was fabulous!  I made this to take along in a cooler for tailgating and it went over well.  I have two more tailgating ventures in the next couple months so I will be making this again!

I omitted the sesame seeds, but I think the next time I make this I will add them for a little texture.  I flavored 4 chicken breasts with soy sauce, garlic powder and lemon pepper and cooked them in a skillet.  I reduced the vegetable oil to 1/4 cup - I think if I had used the entire 1/2 cup it probably would have been too oily.  I also added julienned carrots for color and texture.

This one is a keeper!

I don't know what I did wrong, but this recipe was a disaster. The vinegar taste was much too strong, the chicken was dry in comparison to the oily noodles, and the chicken kept sliding down to the bottom of the bowl. The sesame seeds were gritty and unpleasant. There was nothing redeeming about the way this turned out.

I rated this a little lower as my husband thought it was just OK.  I toasted the sesame seeds in the oven at 400 degrees just for a few minutes.  You need to be careful not to bake them too long so they don't burn.  I also substituted cider vinegar for the rice vinegar, decreased the amount of ginger when cooking due to family preference, & added some crushed red pepper flakes at the table for more flavor.

An excellent summer side dish.  This will be a staple at my house!  I threw in some crushed red pepper flakes for a little more "zing".  Next time, I think I will also add some red and green peppers for a bit more color.

This was OK, with the potential to be excellent.  There was definitely too much oil; more acidity was needed to cut through it.  Actually, I'll just reduce the quantity of oil next time.  The coriander (cilantro) was great - don't leave it out!  And I went easy on the onion and regretted it - it isn't overpowering at all.  A good start to salads for my veggie-phobic boyfriend.

Excellent recipe- everyone loved it.  Next time will try a little more vinegar and a tiny bit less oil to cut a few calories.  The toasted sesame seeds make all the difference!

This was fantastic!  I left out the chicken and added some broccoli slaw & toasted ramen noodles.  It's definitely going to be a staple for our frequent parties!

Awesome.  After reading the reviews, I did cut the oil to 1/3 c. and may do 1/4 c. next time. I used part olive and part canola oil instead of the vegetable oil too. I added some chopped broccoli to the final product.  I also made enough extra dressing for a chicken lettuce salad with chow mein noodles for lunch the following day--excellent!

This was delicious.  I added cut up snow peas and quartered cherry tomatoes. 
The next time I think I'll leave out the chicken and add carrots and peppers 
for a terrific vegetarian salad...Thanks for a great recipe.

I found the dressing to be too sweet and after a day, everything was very dry.  Would have been good with shredded carrots also.

I've been waiting to try this recipe for so long and I just think it was OK.  My husband said it was pretty bland and I tend to agree.  Maybe I need more dressing?  Followed the recipe exactly, adding just a few more veggies (edamame, red pepper and celery).  Thanks for sharing.

I am giving it five stars even though I did as others said and cut the oil to 1/3 cup. My second attempt, I added about 5 cups fresh spinach, no cilantro, 1/4 cup parsley. It was a hit with the family. The dressing is the secret that makes this so good.

"Sesame Pasta Chicken Salad" is quite delicious. I made mine with gluten-free pasta. After tasting the dressing, I did need to modify it to punch it up for our well-seasoned international palates (2 tablespoons of siracha, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon of fresh grated ginger). I used gluten-free tamari in place of the soy sauce. I also used toasted sesame oil for half of the vegetable oil in the dressing, and it did not have an overwhelming sesame flavor. Plain sesame oil is almost flavorless, so you do not get an Asian flavor. I did not add sugar because we do not like sweet food in our family. I wanted to serve this salad as a main course, but felt like it was "missing vegetables," which meant I had to make a special trip to the store for cherry tomatoes and snow peas. I loved this salad in concept, and am highly likely to make a modified version of it again because it is such a fast-and-easy make-ahead meal. Thank you ohines for sharing your recipe.

Easy to make and my boys loved it - a great combination.  I used a prepared roasted chicken from the grocery store and added water chestnuts for some crunch.

Look out recipe box...there's a new family favorite topping the chart.  Instead of giving you my variations, let me just thank all the reviewers who added so many great ideas to change up such a versatile dish despite how perfect it is all on its own.  Chines, you are a genius and thank you for sharing such a great dish.

Great starter recipe! Used apple cider vinegar, brown sugar and added minced garlic to the dressing.  Added match stick carrots and celery for crunch and omitted the chicken as it was a side dish.

Incredibly disappointed with this recipe.  Followed the directions to a T, but also took ideas previously submitted (reduced vegetable oil to 1/3 cup, added julienned carrots, and sliced pea pods).  I had such high hopes what with so many others who adore this recipe, but no one at my house was impressed--including me.  Not very flavorful or exciting. I also wasn't crazy about the cilantro in this dish.  Perhaps I should have bought ginger root instead of using powdered?  Now I have sesame oil and rice vinegar on hand for who knows what. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this.

I served the recipe as written and it was delicious and everybody liked it.  I even had to whip up another one on the spot as it was so popular that people were requesting seconds.  I am making it this week for a party and will probably add some peas and peppers or other veggies.  The dressing is so delicious anything would taste good with it.

My husband is not a salad guy--and he had two helpings the first night, then two more for lunch the next day!At others' suggestions, I cut back on the oil a bit,added water chestnuts and sugar snap peas for crunch,plus subbed whole grain thin spaghetti for the pasta. This is a really excellent recipe that I plan to use again and again! Thank you for sharing!

This is a good base recipe to add in all kinds of stuff and make changes.  I felt it was a little oily but overall good.  I would wait a bit for the sugar to dissolve in the sauce mix next time.

Made this twice.  First with whole wheat pasta and the second time with broccoli slaw instead of pasta (to cut down on the carbs, but ended up adding a pack of ramen noodles for added crunch. :-P)  Both versions were  yummy, yummy, yummy!  Don't leave out the cilantro...it adds great flavor!

Just made this for the first time. I added peas and carrots and made it as a dinner. I served it warm. Man was it tasty!! I didnt change a single thing about the recipe and was very pleasantly surprised. Even my 2 year old gobbled it right up! I see lots of reviewers say that its yummy cold too. Im looking forward to finding out for myself tomorrow. Yum-O!

Very tasty. I added all the dressing to the warm pasta and most of it was absorbed. Perhaps half while warm and other half when cold would work better. I added julienned carrots, diagonally sliced snap peas, water chestnuts and green onions. Loved the cilantro and sesame combo.

What an excellent summertime pasta salad. I used two chicken breast that I diced up and simmered on low in some of the dressing sauce. When the chicken was done I stirred in some fresh sliced mushrooms and let it sit till cool. Besides the called for ingredients, I also added into the pasta some, sugar snap peas, water chestnuts, Julienned Carrots and pimento pepper from the garden. I did save just a little of the dressing to add right when serving and glad I did because it does soak up the dressing while marinating. This is one of the best pasta salads I've ever made...we made a meal out of it, no need for anything else.

Used only 1/4 cup of oil, chunked chicken and no cilantro.  Will try without the chicken too.  Quite easy and tasty.  Thanks for sharing

I made this salad again this weekend I am having leftovers today for lunch.  this salad is even better the second day.  It's always a hit. I add roasted asparagus chunks.  I have also added peanuts and another time added toasted sliced almonds.  Thank you for this light refreshing salad recipe.

My teenage daughter was craving a chicken salad to take for her lunch & this fit the bill perfectly. Held up well through a few days in the fridge so she could enjoy it more than once too!

Very Yummy!!  I have been looking for an asian pasta salad that I can make ahead and take to work for lunch and THIS IS IT!!  It keeps well, tastes great and with an addition of a package of brocolli slaw it actually feels pretty healthy!

LOVED this recipe!  Took it to a potluck dinner and the bowl was EMPTY.  Everyone asked me for the recipe!  Luckily I saved a portion for myself for lunch today, and it was great even 2 days after preparation.

I made a few changes, based on reading the reviews (and I'm glad I did - the dish was DELICIOUS!)

I reduced the oil to 1/3 cup and I used peanut oil.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt, 2 tablespoons of fresh lime juice, and red pepper flakes for a little kick.  I stirred in a finely chopped red pepper for crunch and flavor.  I also took the recommendation to use half the dressing on the pasta the night of preparation, and then stire in the other half right before serving.  I gave the pasta one last squeeze of fresh lime juice right before serving - really brightened it up.  I didn't use any cilantro because I hate the stuff.

Amazing results! Tangy, sweet/sour, great flavors.  I will definitely be making this one again!

Easy and Good!  The flavors remind me of some of my favorite thai restaurant salads. It is refreshing with a bold asian flavor and the toasted sesames enhance the taste.  This is a keeper in every since of the word and a true crowd pleasure - not to mention it is easy to make. You must use light soy sauce or it will come out too salty and you can substitute the rice vinegar for white vinegar or balsamic. It will still taste good.

This really needs to be refrigerated overnight to allow the flavors to mellow.  If not, the vinegar is way too strong to eat it right away.  After a night in the fridge, it was good, but not great.

One of my new favorite recipes! It was a bit boring, so I added a ton of veggies to it. Bean sprouts, snap peas, zucchini, squash, shredded carrotts a green onion. After I cook the chicken, I add a little extra oil and sautee the veggies. Keeping some crunch on them. I also do not do the sugar, but add 1 packet of Splenda to the "sauce". The sauce totally makes this recipe and I usually add a bit more soy and rice wine to the mix. SO GOOD! I like to add a sprinkle of red hot chili flakes before serving. I have made this several times in the last couple of months. Make a big batch and eat off of it several times.

Fantastic--a truly delicious addition to our repertoire! I followed suggestions to cut the oil down to 1/3 cup (and next time I'll probably use 1/4).  I also used olive oil.  I added a bit more sesame oil because we like that flavor a lot.  I also added julienne yellow and orange bell peppers, blanched sugar snap peas, a handful of grape tomatoes, and sliced water chestnuts.  I think the salad really needs the extra veggis, but the dressing is so delicious, I'm sure I'd still eat it without them. 

This is a real keeper.  If you like Asian flavors, you won't be dissapointed.

This was pretty good, however next time I think I'll add a good dose of garlic to the mix.  I used fettuccine noodles and added sauteed cabbage and carrots.  I served it with fried rice.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, ohines!

One of my all-time favorite pasta dishes. I find that with leftovers, I need extra dressing, so I make more initially. I keep the recipe pretty much exactly as is and it's wonderful!! A huge hit with the family too!

I made the 5 serving version of this recipe and the flavor was really good!!  Next time I will try marinating the chicken for even more flavor.  I used linguine pasta, but bow tie would be better because it was slippery!  I cut the oil down to 2 TBS for 5 servings and it was plenty.  I also added some stir fry veggies and served hot.  My hubby really like this.

Really good and easy.  I use a rotisserie chicken for mine and added matchstick carrots,  I love it cold but my mother and husband prefer it a little warm.  We don't east these flavors a lot so it was a very nice change and it was great leftover too.  I will definitely make it again.

I used 5 med.-size boneless, skinless chicken thighs, seasoned with seasoned salt, garlic powder and pepper then microwaved about 10 minutes.  I increased both the cilantro and green onion amounts to 1/3 cup each.  I cut the oil in half after reading reviews, and I added blanched and chilled sugar snap peas (boiled for 1 min. then plunged in ice water for several minutes - this gives the peas a bright green color but they remain nice and crunchy) Also added an 11 oz. can of mandarin oranges drained and cut in half (would have added another can but only had one).  This was insanely delicious!

Super delicious!! I didn't have sesame oil and so I just left it out. I added grated carrots and fresh ginger. I mixed the dressing (without the seeds) in the magic bullet to chop up the ginger. Thanks for the great recipe!

I really liked this although I wish I had read the reviews first, next time I will use less oil. I did add a little bit of peanut butter to the dressing and then blended in my bullet. It gave the salad a slightly different taste, more of a satay dressing which was great with the pasta. Next time less oil and more veggies. Thanks for a great recipe.

Forget sesame noodles - this is better. Cut the oil to 1/3 cup like everyone; added thawed peas, diced water chestnuts and shredded carrots. I left out the cilantro but will try it next time. Also, made this vegetarian; I'm sure it's great with chicken though too.

This is pretty darn good.  I did what so many other reviewers have done - decreased the oil to 1/3 cup and added veggies.  Snow peas, grape tomatoes (cut in half) and julienned carrots.  Sliced water chestnuts would be delish.  I blanched the snow peas for 2 minutes and they were overdone.  Next time I will add them raw or blanch for just one minute.  I might try the sugar snap peas instead.  I added the dressing to the hot pasta so it would soak up more of the flavor.  I'm not sure if that really made any difference.  However, once it sat in the refrigerator overnight, the flavors were much better.  My husband and I both liked it better cold.

I used angel hair whole wheat pasta.  Added water chestnuts, carrots, peas, & roasted red bell peppers.  Instead of fresh cilantro I used a little dried, but added fresh basil and fresh chives.  It was good warm, and chilled, yummy!

Me and hubby both loved this salad.  I added julienne carrots and sugar snap peas.  As recommended, cut the oil to 1/3 cup and it was plenty.  Also used light olive oil instead of veggie oil.  Very nice recipe!

My daughter made this the first time and it's been a staple in our family since.  The only changes I make are to only use 1/4 cup of oil and 1/4 soy sauce.  When we made it with full soy sauce, we felt it overpowered the other flavors.  I usually also add some bell pepper and whatever other veggies we have handy.

Great dressing - that's what makes this good.  I marinated chicken in teriyaki sauce and grilled it before slicing into chunks.  I also added some sliced snow peas and julienned carrots to the pasta in the last minute of boiling.  Very nice!

4 stars because I loved it and husband liked it a lot. ;) If you're looking for a dish that has a ton of good Asian flavor (your style, but not hubby's as much..) this is a good dish to try. He will probably still enjoy it, but it may not be a favorite. I loved the sweet, but not too sweet style of this dish.

A very delicious base that can be easily changed. I enjoyed this greatly! I left out the chicken completely and added chopped red pepper, carrots, and edamame. The green onions really add to the flavor. I will definitely be making this again and again.

Very good ....... especially on a hot summer day!  We added grilled chicken, peppers, asparagus & zucchini and well as lightly steamed broccoli & pea pods.  Omitted cilantro and green onions.  Added fresh chopped parsley.  Fresh, flavorful and filling.

Very nice salad. Love the flavor. Made it as is, tasted then amended. I feel salads should have lots of texture so I added julienne red bell pepper and more green onion. Sugar snap peas would be a nice addition as well. But it truly needed more color. There is a lot of room for play to personalize with this recipe. TY for posting. I agree that the amount of oil should be cut down.

I made this for dinner last night and it was so delicious.  Even my picky kids licked their bowl clean. I made the recipe as stated, not changing a thing.  The recipe says that it will feed 10 people - maybe as a side dish, but definitely not as a main meal.  It fed my husband and I and two 8 year year olds, one 6 year old and one 3 year old, with a little bit left over for my hubby to take for lunch.  My 3 year old woke up this morning asking for the pasta for breakfast, so for lunch I whipped it up again.  The first time, it marinated for about 6 hours and this time I didn't let it sit and marinate at all. Still so good! I'll be making this one again and again.

As written, 5 stars.  This is a fantastic recipe.  (Agree with others, though, veg. oil to 1/3 cup.)  I make this EVERY week for my husband to take with him to work.  (It's great as a cold salad for those who don't have microwaves.)  Since we make it so often, here are some great variations... add sweet chili sauce or hot sriracha sauce.  Brown sugar instead of white.  Adding a little orange juice to the sauce.  Steak instead of chicken.  The possibilities are endless!

I made this with whole wheat ziti and it was wonderful. My husband liked it, but didn't love it. I don't think it needed a full 1/4 cup of sesame seeds. I used grape seed oil and only about 1/4 cup and it was plenty for the dressing. We will add this to our regular rotation.

Also great with salad greens instead of pasta. For this, I marinate the chicken in ginger/soy sauce, and then grill.

All 4 of us loved this recipe.  My 11 year old son said it was 'amazing' and both kids asked for seconds.    I took the suggestion to lower the oil to 1/3 cup and I did not add the onion or cilantro, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This is definitely a 'keeper' and one I will be taking to cookouts this summer for sure.

To make this recipe I had to purchase a few new ingredients.  The sesame oil was a little pricey, but worth it.  I will make this again for sure.  I loved it, our friend Steve loved it, my mom loved it, and my sister loved it.  Boyfriend didn't like it but he's strictly a meat and potatoes guy.  I added snow peas, rough cut carrots, and diced asparagus.  Steamed them for about five minutes.  I marinaded, baked, and diced up some chicken but did not mix it in with the salad, offered as an option.

This was excellent and super easy! I sauteed the chicken with some red peppers and garlic, but next time I'll try marinating the chicken in some extra sauce first.

This is amazing bread!  My daughters and I want to eat the entire loaf before it cools.  I use the flax meal to enhance body utilization.  I have always used just regular flour (all purpose white and wheat) instead of bread flour since I do not usually have it on hand; it still comes out great.

I brought this to a pot luck and it was all eaten.  I altered the recipe a little, reduced the oil to 1/3 c, sugar to 2 T.  I used whole wheat linguine, and would have preferred soba or udon noodles but couldn't find them.  I also added shelled edamame and julienned orange and purple bell peppers.  I will make this again, it had a great taste and you can use what you've got in it - it's a great base recipe as is.

Good, simple meal.  WAY too much oil, though.  I cut it down to just two tablespoons and it was fine.  I also used fresh ginger, and added a lot of fresh veggiest such as snap peas, bell pepper, and tomato.

This recipe was FANTASTIC!!!!!!  The dressing is so, so, good.  Did cut back to 1/3 cup of oil as others had suggested.  Think fresh mushrooms would go really well in this, so I will add them next time. Did use grilled chicken. My husband and I both agree that is now one of our favorite meals.  Thanks so much ohines for posting this recipe.

This is incredible dish.  I switched out the powdered ginger for 3 tbsp. grated fresh ginger instead and also decreased the sugar to 2 tbsp. only.

I made this last night for the first time and it was wonderful!  The cilantro makes the dish!  I doubled the sauce and only used 1/3 cp olive oil and served it warm.  I also added shredded carrots and peas and topped it off with peanuts.  A glass of good chardonnay and it's the best!!

This is really tasty! I felt like it was missing a little something that I couldn't figure out, and now that I've read the ingredient list again, I realized I forgot the soy sauce! duh! oh well, it's still not too bad at all without it. So far I've only had a taste of the salad, so I might try to add the soy sauce tomorrow before serving it to others. Like other reviewers, I used olive oil, and I used a bit less than specified. Added more ginger and black pepper, left out the chicken (simply because it's going to be served with other meat) and didn't use green onion because I didn't realize I didn't have any - but I think green onion would really add just that extra oomph. Toasted some cashews with my sesame seeds, and blanched some snow peas and threw those in too. A very nice pasta salad!

Made this as a side dish for a family event. Looked beautiful and I added blanched carrots, asparagus, snow peas. But the flavor was awful. Wouldn't make this one again. A favorite of ours is the asian salad made with raman noodles, snow peas, crab meat....will need to make that one again to save my reputation at the next family event.

We liked this, but I think it NEEDS vegetables for color, texture & nutrition.  I added sugar snap peas and a red pepper.  Those were both very good in it.  I wouldn't make it without adding some vegetables to it.

This was a wonderful, healthy recipe...  I even got my 3 and 10 year old to eat it!!  I added a lot more cilantro because we love the herb, and I also added some halved snow peas, water chestnuts and halved some grape tomatoes...  Gotta sneak those veggies in where you can!!  I sauted the veggies with some garlic and stirred them into the recipe.  I also added some Thai peanut sauce for extra flavor.  It has a little spice to it, so if you're heat sensitive, leave it out.  We'll have this recipe over and over again!!

I LOVE this recipe! We are huge cilantro fans, and the combination of the cilantro and sesame is surprisingly delicious! I did not use as much oil as called for, and cut back on the sesame seeds, added crushed red pepper. I prefer it cold, and think it needs time in the fridge to "marinate". Good stuff!!

I don't know, I thought this dish would be really good, but for some reason it was too vinegary for me. That was all I could taste. I will not be making this again.

While following the recipe to the letter, I noticed that there was WAY to much sauce for the amount of chicken and pasta in the salad. The soy sauce, even a light one, was quite overpowering and an herb other than cilantro probably could have been used instead, as cilantro has a strong flavor.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

I had to take a salad to a party for 40 people today & decided to try this one.  Boy, do I regret it.  The pasta turned brown from the dressing.  I followed the recipe except for the chicken because the hostess was cooking chicken, and I had to add julienned carrots, diced red pepper, snow peas, cauliflower, jicama just to make it look more edible.  Afterwards I wondered why an Asian type salad would include pasta. I was very embarrassed to bring 3/4 of it home and throw out.  No, I won't make this again. Without the colour of the veggies it did not look appealing.

Holy smokes - is this ever good!! The only thing I did differently was to blanch chicken breasts in chicken stock that I seasoned with some soy sauce, Chinese chili sauce, garlic, ginger,and a little brown sugar. I cooked the chicken in that for about fifteen minutes because it was too hot to turn on the oven and I had bone in chicken breasts. It added a nice flavour but, truly, the dressing is what makes this recipe! Can't wait for my husband to come home to give it a try.

This recipe is a winner!  It makes a great main dish or a great side dish for picnics or barbecues.  Like one of the other reviewers, I added more veggies--yellow pepper, broccoli (both blanched) and baby plum tomatoes.  To the dressing, I added a crushed clove of garlic.  My husband takes a salad for lunch to work.  Because of this recipe, he no longer has to eat a boring saled.  This recipe is already a favorite!

Delicious! I didn't have enough rice vinegar, but the dressing was still great. I used less sugar and more sesame oil, and used sodium-reduced soy sauce. Also halved the oil (used canola) as others suggested. To have a more colourful and balanced meal, I reduced the amount of pasta and added shredded carrots and chilled cooked snow peas (slivered). My 7-year-old son even asked me, "Can you make this again tomorrow?" I think it'll be great for his lunchbox.

Holy moley this was good. I made it for a church party and it was gone within seconds! Everyone was asking for the recipe and my boyfriend has been begging me to make it ever since. I did follow the advice of the other reviews and reduced the oil to 1/3 cup(used evoo), added blanched sugar snap peas, 1 green, 1 red, and 1 yellow pepper for flavor and color. It was beautiful and delish! Next time I will marinade the chicken in the sauce and add 1/2 of the sauce while the pasta is still hot. Thanks for the killer recipe!

This a a great recipe.  I made it for a BBQ yesterday and omitted the chicken as I was just looking for a side salad.  I used canola oil and brought it down to 1/4 cup and added an extra teaspoon of sesame oil for flavor.  I also added some shredded carrots, slaw, and sprouts for texture and color and a teaspon of spicy asian chili paste for a nice kick.  I recommend making this early in the morning and refrigerating it to let all the flavors blend.  It seemed to just get better throughout the night.

We loved this dish!!!  I cut back on vegetable oil, only using 1/4 cup and it was great with less.  I added a red bell pepper which I cut julienne style, used rotini pasta, and browned Ramen noodles and added on top of each bowl of pasta.  I didn't feel like cooking chicken, so I used the pre-cooked chicken breast slices (cold, by Tyson's) and shredded them before adding.  Absolutely delicious!

The sauce is delightful and I will use it for other Asian dishes.  The salad is huge!  I added grape tomatoes sliced in half but you could add so many other things to it.  I'll probably make a little extra sauce for serving as it appears to be soaking up pretty quickly.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Based on other reviews, I was expecting this salad to be really great, but I had to doctor it up quite a bit. I originally made it as written, but the dressing was   too salty and vinegary. I doubled the sugar, and it was much better. I also added a can of drained mandarin oranges and some lightly steamed broccoli to give it some color and liven it up. Still it was just OK.

I only made this with 1/2 a box of pasta and that was plenty for leftovers for us.  Im not sure I'd have a bowl big enough for the whole box of pasta + all the other ingredients.  Its delicious, though!  My husband loves it.

A delicious salad for a picnic, gathering, or even a hectic day's dinner. Don't make the same mistake that I made....chop your cilantro into very small pieces. If you chop it like I did, every bite containing a piece of it, will be over powered by the cilantro taste.

Not as flavorful as I expected, even with more cilantro than called for.  Maybe I'll marinate the chicken for more flavor next time?

I was very excited about the simple ingredients and great reviews.  After making it, the dish was okay.  It was good, but wasn't great.  I probably wouldn't make it again.  I think it needs more veggies.

This is terrific.  I subbed canola oil for the vegetable oil and omitted the cilantro.  I did add some finely chopped red bell pepper.  It was excellent and will definitely become a staple.

This is a really nice, not to mention different twist on chicken pasta salad. We don't care for cilantro so I subbed with parsley. The sesame seeds and oil gave this dish a wonderful flavor. Perfect for our on the go nights. Thank so much Olivia!

This stuff is so good!  I was asked to bring a side dish to a party and brought this and it was a big hit.  I altered the dressing a bit based on another recipe on this site "Asian Chicken Salad".  It's very similar but makes less dressing and uses brown sugar instead of white.  I think as written this would be far too much dressing for one box of bow tie pasta.  I would scale it in half.  I also added shredded carrot for color and I used a can of chicken breast meat instead of cooking the chicken which saves a ton of time.  I drained the chicken and placed it in a bowl, added a bit of the dressing to it then added it to the pasta.  It was a great light and tasty side dish.

Excellent, though I was a bit challenged for time so I substituted Newman's own light Sesame Ginger dressing. EVERYONE wanted the recipe. Next time I will make with the called for dressing.

I was torn between a 3 or a 4 on this one. Pretty good flavor, except I did not like the coating of oil on my lips after each bite. I will try this again except I will reduce or even omit the oil, and add some crunchy wonton ribbons and veggies.

Really great recipe! I also only used 1/3 cup of vegetable oil. I quickly stir fried red and green bell pepper and carrots to add with the dish (just so the vegetables aren't so crunchy). I also added diced red onion. It gave the dish so much vibrant color that attracted everyone. Everyone loved it, and I was overflowed with compliments. Thanks!

Loved it!!  My husband kept sneaking sample bites.   Since I served as a sidedish I left out the chicken.  I also omitted the cilantro just because I find it very overpowering.  Made with 1/3 c. oil per others suggestion and added some pea pods and shredded carrots.  Next time I may add some peanuts.  Served with the Coconut Shrimp from this site.  Can't wait to make again for friends!

Great! I used the leftover roasted chicken from the night before so this was really easy. I cut the oil to 1/3 cup as suggested by someone and added some snow peas. Next time I will try adding some red pepper flakes for some extra spiciness.

Sorry, but we just couldn't get into this.  First of all, the oriental flavors didn't mix well with pasta.  I reduced the amount of oil and doubled the sauce as recommended by other reviewers.  The amount of sesame seeds, however, overwhelmed the salad and made it taste bitter.  Perhaps this salad could be made better with the addition of some additional vegetables.  Regardless, flavoring Italian pasta with Asian ingredients doesn't work for us.

I love this recipe!  So versatile and easily adaptable, but I love the combination of ingredients as is and wouldn't leave any of them out.  I stuck to the recipe, except thanks to prior reviews I tweaked the dressing amounts a bit - I doubled all the dressing ingredients except for the oil, I included 1/2 cup of olive oil.  I added 1/2 of the dressing to the salad when I made it, let it sit in the fridge overnight, and before serving for lunch I added about 1/2 of the remaining dressing.  So I didn't need the full double batch, 1 and 1/2 was perfect IMO, but I'm glad I had the extra on hand and will know better for next time - I will definitely make this again.

I enjoyed this salad....however I was the only in my family. I preferred it warm so I heated it in the microwave. I also added madarine oranges and chinese noodles. The dressing is so wonderful that I made another batch of dressing and had it on mixed greens with the oranges and chinese noodles!

Wow, do I ever love this! In fact I'm currently addicted to it. ;) The first time I made this I left out the cilantro to accomodate my mother and liked it so much without it that I've actually never bothered adding it since. I also make another modification, my husband doesn't like canned meat so I mix up a seperate batch of the dressing, marinate a chicken breast in it and grill it on the bbq and dice it. It's fabulous. Thanks Olivia!

This was really good.I was looking for something different as a side dish for grilled shrimp.I found this at the last minute and I didn't have the bow tie pasta so I used angel hair instead. I replaced the chicken with the grilled shrimp.
The whole family loved it. I hid the leftovers for MY lunch.

We really enjoyed this!  Next time  will omit the cilantro, as it just didn't fit the Asian taste.  Also, it is very good warmed up in the microwave.  Otherwise, I stuck pretty much to the recipe, but only had a 12 ounce box of pasta, and that worked fine, without so much leftover (but just enough for lunch the next day!)

I am not much of a cook.  I made this for the company pot luck Christmas party (I work with a lot of very particular artists) and it was a huge hit.  I used prepackaged cooked chicken so it took very little time.

VERY DELICIOUS!

I used 12 oz. of pasta, 4 cups of chicken and 1/3 cup oil, extra seeds & cilantro.

Part of the fun with pasta salads is adjusting them to your own taste, but the recipe as written is wonderful!

Thanks so much for sharing.  I've been looking for a tasty recipe like this for a long time.  :o)

This was great, but I really had to improvise with ths one.  I was looking for a recipe to go with the sesame beef listed on this website, so I didnt need the chicken in the recipe.  I also ommitted the bow ties and used ramen noodles...im not a fan of cilantro, so I left that out.  It was a great side dish for an oriental meal like that.

My family loved this recipe!  I followed some reviewers suggestions and added a half a bag of diagonally sliced snow peas and two thirds cup shredded carrots during the last minute of the pasta boil time, drained it all together, and added half the dressing while the pasta was still slightly warm, adding the remaining dressing with the rest of the ingredients. I also reduced the vegetable oil to 1/4 cup and increased the sesame oil to 2 tablespoons. I added extra green onions for crunch and flavor and topped with the juice of half a lime. Lastly, for extra flavor, we pre-marinated the chicken in a bottled Island teriyaki sauce and grilled it before we cooled and chopped it and added it to the salad. Delicious dish!

I made it to the recipe both my wife and I thought it was great. I had some leftover chicken and that's why I made it. the salad really doesn't need the chicken it would be great with just the pasta and dressing. I would make it as a side dish without the chicken.

Love this recipe and use all kinds of variations to it - I use it to clean out the veggies I have left over, red peppers cut into matchsticks, peas, cauliflower, mushrooms, etc.  I do cut the vegetable oil down to 1/4 - 1/3 cup and up the sesame oil to 1 tablespoon.  I usually use freshly minced ginger or the minced ginger in a jar and double it.  Great base recipe with all kinds of possibilities - I particularly like whole wheat thin spaghetti noodles rather than the bowtie pasta.

OH MY GOD... this recipe is my lord and savior! It's so easy and tastes amazing every time. I like to make it after work because it doesn't feel too daunting to prepare after a long busy day.

I make this exactly as it's written with a few minor adjustments to make it more vegetarian:
- Omit the chicken
- I cut up a medium-large head of broccoli
- I julienne a carrot
- I cut up 1 red pepper
- I add PEANUT BUTTER

While the pasta cooks I stir-fry all the veggies, and when they're close to being done I add the sauce and let it simmer on low-medium. My secret ingredient is 1 heaping tablespoon of peanut butter! I add the peanut butter while it the sauce simmers with the veggies. It literally takes the recipe NEXT LEVEL!

I also like to squirt that good, good Sriracha into the sauce. I also crack a ton of pepper into it. 

IT'S SO EFFING GOOD!!! You must try. 
OBEY YOUR CRAVINGS!

AMAZING
One of my friends shared this recipe with me a few months ago and I lost it! Luckily for me, AllRecipes had several to choose from. This is a favorite in my household, my husband is always begging me to make this for him and he always asks me to make a bunch so he can have leftovers for work! I would definitely recommend if you like a zesty pasta dish. Note: I personally love to marinade the chicken overnight in some raspberry balsamic vinegar & brown sugar. Then pour the contents into a pan and cook @400° for 40 minutes. Perfect compliment to the sauce in this recipe!

Great flavour! I subbed julienned carrots, chopped snow peas, and reduced the oil to 1/3 cup instead. I will definitely make this again! Also, I used gluten free spagetti (cut into 4) and GF soy sauce.

I love this recipe, but I made several alterations to it. I added only about half the amount of vegetable oil and rice vinegar, and instead of using basic soy sauce I used Ponzu (soy sauce with a citrus flavor - there are a few kinds but I prefer the orange one with a little bit of lime) as well as Hoisin (which is like an Asian bbq sauce). I just add these to taste as I mix a little at a time into the salad. It may sound like an odd combination but it is really very good. I also added a little of each of the sauces to the chicken when cooking it. I also added red, yellow and orange bell peppers. The last time I made it I also just left out the ginger, I prefer the flavor of the sauces and having all that flavor all at once is too much, in my opinion. 

I have brought this to several parties in place of a basic pasta salad and everyone LOVES it! It is a great dish if you want something unique that is still not too "different" that it would scare people off.

The flavor was good, but I think it needed more dressing.  Next time I will double it.  We did wait 24 hours before eating it, so maybe too much got absorbed by the pasta.  Also, I will reduce the amount of pasta and increase the veggies: shredded carrots, snow peas, green onion, red peppers, maybe water chestnuts.  It just came out a little dry and bland...

Yes! Loved it. Easy to fix. Great flavor. You may use whatever pasta you have on hand and it will still be delicious. I like the bow tie pasta if you have company coming. You may also want to try this with shrimp as well as the chicken. Chicken was great but I can also see this with fresh shrimp. My whole family loved it which is really great. Make extra for the next day. One of the best quick fix recipes I have had in a long time. We left out the cilantro and added 3/4 c. of small peanuts.  I served frozen green whole beans with it that added color on the plate and complimented it very well. 
Slices of fresh pineapple rounded out a dish that could be enjoyed by either family or company.

Yummy and so fresh and light.  Didn't use all the dressing.  Used shrimp instead of chicken, threw in some leftover red bell pepper and lots more cilantro since I love it..can definitely add whatever veggies you like.

GREAT recipe.  Made it as a dinner meal, but would work also as a "pasta salad" item for a potluck or gathering as well.  Time consuming but not difficult; delicious.  I cut down the dressing to about 3/4 of what it called for - next time I would possibly use even less of the oils, but would definitely cut back a tbsp of sugar and add a bit more soy sauce.  Made enough for dinner for 2 plus a few servings of lunch.

I make something nearly identical, but instead of chicken (which I may try adding at some point!), we use red pepper (diced), snow peas (cut into small diagonal slice), diced onion, and cashews, and serve cold.  This is an amazing pasta salad.  TRY THE CASHEWS!!!

The sauce for this is fantastic.  I made this as just a pasta salad without the chicken and added 1 each diced red and green pepper for color.  I also found if you make this a day or two ahead of time the flavors have time to blend together better.  Thanks for the recipe.

The only bad thing about this is I wish I made more of it! The flavor was delicious! We had this as a warm dish with the bow tie pasta; I seasoned and stir fried chicken strips, then added leftover bite sized pieces of pork roast.  I added the sauce to the meats in the pan, added a tiny bit of crushed red pepper flakes to add just a little heat, then just stirred a few minutes.  Everyone loved it!

We're gluten, egg and dairy free, so I switched the soy with GF soy and switched the pasta with GF rice pasta, and it was really delicious.

Great flavor. I cut the oil to 1/3 cup and reduced the sugar to 2 T. I skipped the chicken and instead added pea pods, matchstick carrots, and chopped water chestnuts. In addition, I subbed fresh grated ginger for the ground ginger. Baked tofu would be a nice addition. I will make it again!

Use sesame oil instead of veg. Omitted tsp. s oil. Cut down on oil amount next time. A little to much dressing for pasta. I cut recipe in half.

This was quite a hit at my house!  I made it pretty much as directed except for adding in some cucumber and mini red pepper for color and crunch.  It tasted great, although I split it and made half with cilantro and half without, and I think I will just skip the cilantro next time - the other ingredients provide plenty of flavor.  A touch of chili paste gives it a nice little kick too, for those who like spice.

Good.  I liked it best cold.  Dressing is similar to the Asian Chicken Salad dressing on this site (which is amazing!).  It was a little strange to eat the pasta dish after the salad being one of my all time favorite meals.

The salad is marinating in the frig right now, but from what I tried it is good! I doubled the ginger and sesame seed oil in the recipe. I added orange pepper, water chestnuts and sugar snap peas. I would make this again. Looking forward to guests trying it to tell me what they think!

I tried this and did as some of the other reviewers suggested, decreased the oil.  I added sliced baby carrots ( that I steamed in the microwave a little), fresh sliced pea pods, unsalted cashews, and sliced water chestnuts.  I let the pasta marinate with some of the dressing for about 5 hours, then added the other ingredients and added the remaining vegetables and let that marinate another hour.  We loved it!  I thought the toasted sesame seeds really added to the flavor.

We added other veggies like carrots and celery to add some substance to it. It was okay. Not amazing though.

I added some shredded carrot and I think some snap peas might be a nice addition. Cooked the chicken with Trader Joe's black pepper sauce brushed on. Added some sriracha to the dressing.

I found this dish to be a little bland. The sesame sauce didn't seem to have a very strong flavor, so your basically eating chicken and a paste.

Don't hate it, but don't love it either.

I didn't like it and my kids didn't like it, I think the taste was too subtle even though I let it sit for an hour after preparing it. My hubby did like it though, so I'll give it two stars for him. Too much prep for too little flavor, I won't make this again.

this was really good. i made it a little different, i reduced the oil to 1/3. i cooked chunks of chicken breast by sauting onion, garlic, ginger, one green hot pepper, mrs.dash, basil, oregano, onion powder and salt and pepper (all spices i have in my cabinet). after the pasta was cooked and strained i spooned the browned chicken in the hot steaming pasta and added a few tablespoons of the sauce i had prepared. i then sauteed finely chopped red peppers, carrots, corn, and green peas in the same pan. while the veggies were cooking i spooned some of the prepared sauce. finally when the veggies were cooked i mixed everything together and topped it with minced scallion and chopped cilantro. the cilantro gives it a lovely taste...it is very "wet" dish. i imagine when its cooled and refridgerated it will lose some liquid...it is definitely a side dish though. i just made a big pan of it and now i realize its nice to complement a main dish. not really a main course.

This pasta is great! Very easy and fast to make. I held the chicken, added extra cilantro and cherry tomatoes. I also used only as much olive oil as needed to keep the pasta from sticking, 1/2 cup is overkill for sure! I've make this a few times now and it's delicious the next day as a cold leftover.

Great recipe, very tasty & light. For me the dressing needed a bit more tartness, so for a 4 svg recipe I added the juice from 2 limes to the dressing. Added some sugar snap peas, yellow bell pepper, & some mandarin oranges. I say add whatever you enjoy, this recipe & its dressing work well w/most everything.

I had grilled chicken in the freezer so I thought we’d give this a try.  I added red, green and yellow bell pepper strips to the salad, and after adding the dressing I topped each salad with wonton strips.  This was good, but I wasn’t as keen on the dressing as I hoped I would be.

Wow! Just made this for a light summer supper. I didn't change a thing, only added some cherry tomatoes from our garden and served with some grilled french bread rubbed with garlic. This was fantastic! Definitely a keeper! Will make again and again.

Cooked my chicken breast in crockpot, seasoned with garlic,onion powder, salt and pepper...diced the chicken. I made a double batch of dressing...pressed 2 cloves of garlic into the dressing, used evoo but only about 1/2 of what the recipe calls for, doubled toasted sesame oil... slightly more vinegar, as we prefer stronger flavors...also some shredded carrots, celery, red onion and red and yellow peppers..absolutely amazing, can't wait for lunch tomorrow!!

My family & I LOVE this recipe!  First time I made it as specified, after that I have modified it slightly:  Saute regular onions (rather than the green ones we never have) in sesame oil and some olive oil; Use canned chicken and heat it w/the onions (to lose the canned taste);  Add all the sauce ingredients to the onions/chicken so they mix well; Use dried cilantro (I have that always on hand).

Very good.  I made it exactly as the recipe instructed except that I reduced the oil to 1/3 cup since so many reviewers recommended that.  I felt like there wasn't enough dressing when I was ready to serve it, so I whipped up another batch of the dressing and added half of it to the salad.  I would caution you about toasting the sesame seeds.  I felt like medium high heat was too high, at least on my gas range.  Even though I stirred constantly, the seeds almost burned.  I would recommend medium heat at the most...maybe even medium low.  This is a good salad, and I plan to make it again.  With the extra dressing, this salad would probably be a 5 star.

Just ate this for dinner. Very good.  When I started out I also cut the oil in half and used olive oil instead.  The rice vinegar I had was seasoned so I cut out the sugar. It didn't taste the way I had hoped so I went out & bought the plain rice vinegar. Added 1/3 cup and it was perfect - still without the added sugar. I added some sliced almonds and that was it. Very nice, cool dinner.

Wonderfully awesome recipe! The kids asked for it in their school lunch. :-)

Changes I made: Doubled the amount of pasta and used rotini, decreased amount of vegetable oil to 2 tablespoons, cooked 2 President's Choice Blue Menu turkey breast burgers (10 ounces total) and sliced it.

This is a great recipe. My favorite is the version which includes garlic and parsley and spinach, but this is still a 5 star version. Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe!  I made it last week and I have been craving it ever since.  It was quick and easy to make, which is always a plus on week nights. 
Like others, I cut the oil in 1/2 and used olive oil instead of vegetable.  I also added veggies that I had on hand: carrots, broccoli, sugar snap peas

Excellent! I truly enjoy the dressing. I added shredded carrot, broccoli slaw, grape tomatoes, minced 2 large garlic cloves and a finely chopped stalk of celery. I love veggies. Salad was colorful and delicious! Sooooooo goooooood! :-)

This was so wonderful - it was a hit in our house.  I took people's advice and added matchstick carrots and sugar snap peas - next time I will add some chopped peanuts too.  This is a keeper!

I made this yesterday, left out the cilantro (personal choice) and used some grated fresh ginger root instead of the ground ginger.  Very good, everyone enjoyed it.  Had leftovers for lunch today;  I prefer it cold.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent base recipe. I made changes to this based on the reviews. Used olive oil instead of the vegetable oil and cut to 1/3 cup. Subbed Splenda for the sugar. Added broccoli slaw, shredded celery, used regular soy sauce, Publix chicken tenders, added lemon juice and julienned red and yellow peppers. Also added a little of the McKormick sesame ginger marinade for extra flavor.

The flavor of the sauce was delicious and my family really enjoyed the salad but I wish the sauce had stuck to the noodles a bit better.  It was a little watery and I was hoping for a thicker sauce that coated the noodles better.

Followed recipe, except used olive oil instead of veg oil. Used 2 chicken breasts. Also added shredded carrots, peas, mushrooms, water chestnuts. I don't really like vinegary-tasting dressings, so I was happy that this had more of a strong sesame taste. Recipe made enough to fill a large bowl to the top

This is amazing.  I always think the vinegar (no matter what kind) is a bit too much so I decreased slightly and added a bit more sesame oil.  We had a bit of leftover chicken from the night before and that worked well.  We love the oriental flavors and as other reviewers have stated, many other veggies could be added, but we think it is wonderful the say it is, especially with the green onion and cilantro. I halved the recipe and did use 1/4 c. oil and it was not too much dressing.  Next time though I will substitute olive oil for health reasons.  Thanks for a great recipe.  It is a keeper!!!

Delicious.  I only used a 1/4 cup of oil in the dressing and it was plenty.  Added julienne carrots and sugar snaps peas.

I made this for my book club and it was well received.  I added blanched sugar snap peas and blanched julienned carrots, and reduced the vegetable oil to 1/3 cup per one of the other reviewer's recommendations.  I made it the night before to give the flavors a chance to blend (stirring occasionally the next day) and reserved a quarter cup of the dressing to mix in just before serving.  I grilled chicken breasts and shredded those for the meat which added a nice flavor.  Turned out great!

Took this to a get together with about 30 people..was really worried that no one would eat it because I live in the South and it does not have biscuits or butter!!...Thank the Lord that I made double because people were going back for thirds and then we RAN OUT!  This recipe is AWESOME!  I used the 1/3 cup of olive oil like others suggested and I put in shredded carrots, broccoli, peas and corn...SO GREAT!!

This is really good. I reduced the vegetable oil as suggested by other reviewers. This also will be good with lettuce and fried rice noodle instead of pasta. I had left over pasta and roasted chicken so it was perfect for this recipe.

The ingredience sound great. I had all of them on hand and prepared as directed. However, this will not become a family favorite anytime soon. We felt something was missing and before I knew it we were adding. It was edible but not satisfying. Sorry.

I made this without the chicken or the cilantro and it was delicious.  I also substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil in the interest of health.  I thought it was a little heavy on the sesame seeds so I will cut back next time, but otherwise really enjoyed it.

I made a large batch and the leftovers were wonderful for weekday work lunches.

AMAZING! This recipe reminds me of a salad I used to get from a store I no longer live near. I never considered attempting to make my own until I came across this one. It is absolutely delicious! I've done a few different variations. One time I used red onion instead of green for some added crunch and bite. Another time we added chinese noodles to our bowl once it was served. I also like to add red peppers and tomatoes for more veggies and to "thicken" it up. SO GOOD!

This pasta salad is amazing! I was very pleasantly surprised with the flavor! I'll definitely be making this again. The only thing I changed was that I added frozen and steamed broccoli that I had on hand. Next time I might also add some frozen peas or carrots or something. This is a good meal to bring to work for lunch so I like to have some veggies with it for a more complete meal.

Great spin on pasta salad.  I, too, cut the oil down to 1/3C but added a couple dashes more of soy sauce.  Used a rostisserie chx for full flavor and whole wheat rotini for a bit more texture.  Lots of compliments received, zero leftovers.  Will make again!

Fantastic recipe! It will surprise you by how good it is and how easy it is to make. I made a few changes, but am confident it would be just as yummy without them. I used regular soy sauce, cut the oil in half, added diced red pepper, used seasoned rice vinegar, and used some chopped chicken breasts that I had previously marinaded overnight in a sesame marinade and then grilled. I used a tiny bit more sesame oil than it called for... maybe 1/2 teaspoon more. This was so good, we finished it in four (healthy) servings... not ten. I brought the last bowl of it to work for lunch and my coworkers raved about it. The crispy LaChoy rice noodles sprinkled on top of broccoli florets mixed in would be nice additions. Oh, and I let it rest for about 15 minutes after mixing the dressing with the other ingredients to let the pasta soak up the sauce and let the flavors meld. It was DEE-LISH.

This turned out pretty darn good! I had to make some modifications just based on what I had in the house. I used a box of spaghetti, omitted the cilantro and used toasted sliced almonds instead of sesame seeds. Like others, I added matchstick carrots, sliced cucumbers and tripled the green onions. I made the dressing according to the directions (only used 1/3 cup oil), but found it to be less than flavorful. So to jazz it up a little, I added a tbsp. of Sriracha, a couple tbsp. of creamy peanut butter and probably 4 tbsp. of Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce. That made it just about perfect! Taking it picnicking tomorrow; can't wait to try it really cold from the fridge!

This is good! I wasn't blown away, but my husband, mother-in-law, and 2 year old all had seconds! I reduced the oil and was glad I did - the amount in the recipe was FAR too much. I did love the sesame oil and the Asian flavor it lent to the dish. Although I LOVE cilantro, I was disappointed by its weak contribution (even though I increased the amount). It seemed to be overpowered by the sesame and soy flavors. We all agreed that the addition of water chestnuts and mandarin oranges would greatly improve it. I would also perhaps reduce the sugar to 2 T. I will make this again, but with these changes.

Very good recipe. I cut the vegetable oil down to 1/3 cup as a previous reviewer recommended. I also added baby corn. Next time I may add water chestnuts and snap peas. We ate this as a main course and it was delicious. Will be making it again soon!

This is SO good.  I made it as written but without cilantro.  I am trying to wait for it to chill but keep sneaking samples.  By the time it's chilled, there won't be any left!  I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to guests or bring to a potluck.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I had high expectations about this dish but it didn't quite turn out how I pictured. First, a pound of noodles is way too much. I added some veggies like others but would have added much more in hindsight, equal parts veggies and pasta would be much better. The sesame flavor in the sauce was a little intense... in the end I just felt like I was eating oily salty noodles that tasted only of sesame. Will likely tweak this a lot and try again.. eventually

Really good summer recipe.  My family loved it, even my 3-year old.  I used whole wheat noodles and reduced the sugar a bit, but it was still delicious.

I halved this recipe to try it out. I had no sesame oil, so I sauteed some sesame seeds in veggie oil as a substitute. I do not like cilantro, so I replaced it with 1/8 teaspoon of coriander. I added some extra sugar. Following suggestions, I cut the veggie oil by half. I thought the sauce was delicious, but the salad came out a little dry. I added the original amount of oil, and some extra vinegar and soy sauce, and that made it moister. I also added some shredded carrots.

Like others said, reduced oil to 1/3 cup. The sesame oil has a special flavor so don't leave it out. Couldn't find light soya sauce so used regular which made the salad a dark colour (only problem). A nice change from the usual pasta salad and was a big hit at our BBQ for Father's Day.

The dressing is delicious, but the salad needs veggies for extra punch.  I added cooked edamame and lightly steamed broccoli florets and shredded cabbage and that made it perfect.

Loved this - i added the sugar snap peas (after blanching in boiling water).  I like the linguini better than the bow tie - hands down.  I will be making this one for years to come!  YUMMY!

This is so good!! I didn't bother with the sesame seeds. I cubed the chicken up rather than shredded. I added some snow pea pods and water chestnuts, this would go well with a lot of different additions. The flavor is so good. I think it's okay cold but I also warmed it in the microwave and prefer it warm. Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a fantastic recipe--tastes delicious! It is always a favorite of mine to make this dish for potlucks and dinners. Everyone loves it! The only thing I do differently is change the amount of vegetable oil from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup. It tastes the same and isn't as oily. Other than that, it is GREAT!

I have to agree that the flavor isn't right. I didn't add wine and did less soy sauce as recommended. its just too sweet and not much "real" flavor. it was still edible, but i added a lot of pepper and other spices to make it better.

This was so good!  I followed this recipe's proportions to a tee, but added some carrots to the pasta mix and doubled the sauce. I made this 1 hour before serving, and found myself sneaking bites. It tasted good freshly made and also later when I served it.

AMAZING! Loved it! Easy to make, simply mix. Only thing that took time was the chicken to cook, and that was only about 15 minutes. The flavor is awesome. I added some vegetables to make it more filling. DO IT!

My family really loves this dish.  I prepare a vegatarian version omitting the chicken. I also sautee minced garlic, broccoli, carrots and peas and add along with the sesame dressing.  This is an outstanding recipe and even better the day after when all the flavors have marinated.

This recipe is Great! I made it yesterday for a bbq/birthday party! I read several reviews before making the recipe. I cut back to 1/3 c of oil (which most people suggested),  I added red bell pepper, broccoli florest, sugar snap peas, shredded carrots, and slivered almonds! I also made two batches of the dressing. I poured 1/2 of the dressing on a few hours before serving and then the other half upon serving. Adding extra ingredients made the pasta so colorful and extra YUMMY! I also marinated my chicken in Seseme ginger marinade and cooked it on the grill! This pasta was a major hit! I think Ill add water chestnuts and mushroom next time! Multiple people asked for the recipe! Enjoy :)

Absolutely delicious! I made it exactly as written using ww pasta. This tastes better cold and seems to improve with age, so I'd make it the day before you plan to serve it.

I only had spaghetti noodles so I used those instead of the bow ties. I cut the meat down to two cups and added one cup of steamed chopped broccoli. I didn't realize that I was out of sesame seeds until I went to grab them and they were gone, so I used 1/4 cup of chopped dry roasted peanuts. I also increased the ginger to a full teaspoon and used four cloves chopped fresh garlic in the "sauce". I took a small taste and thought it was great, and two boys out of my three liked it. I'll make this again. NOTE: I did serve this salad chilled. I think that by doing that, it made the salad even better.

Delish. Followed the advice of others and made ahead w/ half the dressing and added the rest before serving. I added water chestnuts and used fresh ginger. Served with bulgogi and grilled veggies

YUP!  This one is a keeper - the best part is you can vary the dish each time with different veggies - great!  Be sure to follow the recommendation of cutting the oil to 1/3 cup.  The sauce is perfect belend of flavors.

Very good, but not amazing. A crowd pleaser. Makes A LOT... will serve more than 10 at a potluck. I added chopped red pepper - for more veggies and a little color.

Wow.  This is the perfect summer dinner.  Easy, tasty, and flavorful.  I liked the suggestion to use have the sauce on the pasta when it's still warm and to add the rest before serving.  I used all the sauce when it was warm and two days later I made some more and the dish ended up a little too oily at that point.  I added carrots to mine but next time I though in lots more veggies.

Tried this because of all of the great reviews but didn't really care for it.  I think that maybe it was the flavor of the sesame oil?  I don't think I would make this again.

The flavors of this are really good but i think there is way too much oil.  I used olive oil because its healthier and only used maybe 1/3 C.  Definitely better the next day!

Absolutely fabulous - vary the pasta - I tried angel hair and corkscrews, combined to make 1# (out of necessity) DO YOURSELF A FAVOR . . . add cashews!  Puts it over the top.

Fantastic! But I would recommend making some changes--use 1/3 cup of oil and add julienned carrots, water chestnuts, bean sprouts, sugar snap peas cut at a diagonal (as per another review) and diced chicken. Overall phenomenal!

Excellent!  Added julienned carrots (2), used vegetable farfalle and grilled 2 chicken breasts.  Topped each serving with a handful of crushed peanuts.  Too much dressing - I'd scale down next time - but great taste!

great dish! Made this at very last minute for pot-luck and got many compliments.  I used canned chicken from costco. I didn't have cilantro, and I used white balsamic vinegar because I didn't have rice vinegar. Also added blanched snap peas.  I plan to add this dish into rotation at our house and will make for parties! Easy and delicious! Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

I have never written a review before, but had to after I made this pasta salad.  It is delicious!  Per other reviews, I cut the oil in half and added some red/orange pepper.  I was also taking it as a sidedish, so I didn't put chicken in (although I think it woud be delicious with the chicken).  It definitely tasted even better the next day after the flavors combined.  Next time I will make it a day ahead of when I plan to eat it.

Very good.  I did halve the amount of vegetable oil and I'm glad I did, as I think it would've been way to greasy.  I cut the amount of sesame oil in half, too, as I'm still learning to like that flavor.  I left out the green onions and cilantro (personal preference) but added a cup of frozen peas for color.  I will probably make this again and experiment with adding additional veggies (like carrots).

This dish was okay. I probably won't make it again. It need more flavors to bring it together for me. It would be a fine side dish in my opinion.

Made this on the fly and me and my family loved! I made few changes.  Used Udon noodles because that is what I had on hand, didn't have cilantro or sesame seeds. Added water chestnuts and red bell pepper topped with crsipy noodles.  The color was fine - looks like chow mein noodles.  Used 1/3 cup oil as other suggested.  This was served as a main dish.  Would love to try with cilantro, would not use bow tie pasta after the success of the Udon noodles.

This made a very easy lunch meal.  I used canned chicken to speed up the preparation, which was fine, but I'm sure it would taste better with freshly cooked chicken.  Adding snap peas was an excellent idea.

I made this pasta salad for my girl friends. We all loved it. It's very light and tastey. I made it a head of the time and left it out in room temperature and the leftover still taste good. I like how easy to make this and it's perfect for pot luck and feeding a large party.

We thought this was good, but it is very unappealing to look at, it needs more color.  I think broccoli, carrots, or peas would be a good addition.

Very good! However, it could be "Excellent" with a few minor changes.  I made as directed with the exception of the following: I only added 1/3 cup oil.  I used Olive Oil.  Also added two cloves chopped garlic.  Did not measure the Cilantro or the Green Onions but I know I put much more than the recipe called for.  Don't skimp on these as they make the recipe!!!  Next time I will use fresh Ginger and add some canned oranges or thinly sliced carrots for color.  Will also add some toasted Peanuts.  I think a crunch factor was the missing ingredient.

LOVED this salad!  I bought the chicken already cooked from the hot table at my grocers.  Also, added celery to give it some crunch.  I also cut down on the vegetable oil to 1/4 cup - less calories.  In future I would also add the water chestnuts, ramen noodles and maybe a few cashews.  Definitely better the next day once it absorbed all the sause/dressing.  Really tasty and something different!

Wow.. A wonderful and yummy diet food .. I made it without the oil as I did not want to add fat calories. Substituted the rice vinegar for white vinegar .. didnt have Sesame oil, so omitted it too. I marinated the chcken breasts in Gineger teriyaki ..so it tasted yummy !! Reduced the pasta to less than half..again for lesser calories.. Added fresh corn and lettuce...didnt add any cilantro. It turned out too good.. Im happy to get a tasty meal when I am on a diet .. A keeper for sure

This was so good! I had to replace the rice vinegar with apple cider vinegar because that was all I had, and I left out the cilantro and added peas and julienned carrots. I also used only 1/3 cup of olive oil instead of the half cup of veggie oil. I really loved it and will definitely make it again.

This recipe was very good, and my kids gobbled it up.  It seemed like alot of sauce at first, but once I poured it on, it was perfect.  If you dish tastes a little too much like vinegar, add a bit more sugar to even it out.  Honestly, I used some leftover pork instead of chicken, and it was great.  Also, I couldn't help but add some fresh sliced mushrooms, too.   Next time, I may add some julienne carrots, too!

This was great. I used the pre-grilled chicken breast from Lillydales to save time.  Next chance I get to make this, I think I will not add the cilantro as it took over the taste when I ate it next day for lunch.

The sauce is perfect, but of course I added some extra ingredients and used linguine. I added cabbage, carrots, and edamame.  I also stir fried the chicken and added red pepper because I like a little spice.

Really tasty-I lowered the oil and added some fresh veggies and water chestnuts for a party at my neighbors.  It made a lot-they ate the left overs for breakfast the next day and reported it was the best pasta saled ever!  It was good the first day-I guess really good the 2nd, I got an empty bowl back!

I really enjoyed this recipe - it's quick, easy and versatile. First, I did as the other reviews suggested and used less oil. Second, since I was using this as a main dish I put in more vegetables; peas, carrots and mushrooms (basically whatever was in my kitchen that I wanted to get rid of). I took the advice of another reviewer and waited 30 minutes after I had mixed everything together so the sauce had infused with everything in the dish. I was extremely happy that I was waited because I think this made the dish even more outstanding! Thanks for the add. :)

Very Good, both adults and kids like this one. Made it the day before, put half the dressing on while the noodles were warm and I mixed in the rest of the ingredients (we added carrots and peas), then mixed the other half of the dressing in right before serving. It worked out really well...

I do not write reviews often, but this recipe is amazing . For those that complain it turns brown, of course, there is soy sauce in it. Like others I doubled the dressing ingredients, except the oil, kept it at 1/3 cup. Next time I might not fully double the sesame seeds for the dressing as I found I had quite a bit. Put half on now and will re-toss later before I serve it at the party. A little note: it needs the green onion and cilantro, dont bother without them. I added blanched snow peas (threw them in the water with the pasta) and carrots. Yummy! UPDATE: I doubled the sauce, however, its not necessary. With the dressing I had I was able to make 2 batches and still had some left over. The second time around I put slightly more dressing and it wasn't as tasty. Don't go over board on it. But if you don't double the sauce ingredients, be sure to cut the oil in half.

I made this because of the reviews, and I was disappointed.  Every other recipe I've made on this site with such great reviews lived up to the reviews, but not this one.  I won't make it again.

My guests raved - everyone loved it!!  I cut the oil down, added carrots, snow peas, finely chopped red bell pepper, and some Chinese chili sauce to the sauce for a little kick.  I was very glad I followed reviewer's advice to add half the dressing when I made the salad and toss with the other half just before serving.  I had both grilled chicken and grilled steak strips on the side for people to add their own meat to taste.  Great company dish!

amazing!  as per other reviews, i made the following modifications:  doubled the dressing but used only half the oil stated in the recipe, added some veggies (carrot, red bell pepper), used a rotisserie chicken in lieu of making my own, added some chili pepper flakes and an extra dash of rice vinegar.  as a vegetarian with a meat-eating hubby, this was an especially great recipe; i divided it in half and added chicken to only his portion. I will be making this again and again!

This salad is fantastic!  My husband begs me to make it every week.  I didn't change the recipe at all except for buying the sesame seeds already toasted and a cilantro paste - both are a real time saver.  The dressing on this is really great.

I've been wanting to try this for a long time because it sounded like something I would like.  I made it for a picnic and everyone loved it.  The cilantro seemed a little weird, but it was great.  I did chicken cubes instead of shredded and added a chopped red pepper.  I wasn't paying attention to the directions and just added the sesame seeds to the dressing without toasting.  It will probable be even better with that step next time.

Brought it to a pot luck and received rave reviews!  Cut the oil to 1/3 cup and increased both the soy sauce and rice vinegar to 1/2 cup each!  Delicious!  Added a can of corn and diced red & green peppers for some crunch!  Will make again!

I didn't really care for this.  I make something really similar that we like a lot better.  I thought there was too much dressing, with too much soy sauce.  The version I make has 1/2 cup rice vinegar, 1/2 tsp dry mustard, 2 T honey, 2 T sugar, 1 T soy sauce, 2 T sesame oil, and 1/2 cup vegetable oil in the dressing.  I also put sliced water chestnuts in (I sprinkle some soy sauce over them and let them sit a little before adding them to the pasta).  I also add some peas.  My version has chicken in it as well.  And then we garnish each serving with some cilantro, chopped, peanuts (we don't use sesame seeds), and a squeeze of lime juice.  I'll stick to my version.  But, thanks for sharing the recipe.

Absolutely delicious. Next time I'll either make half as much dressing or use twice as much pasta and chicken. Also, I think this would be perfectly good served warm.

This dish was O.K.  I like the concept of an Asian-style pasta salad in general and definitely think the dish is worth a second attempt.  For my first try, I made it as the recipe indicated.  However, I think the dressing needs more zing - maybe some garlic and crushed red pepper.  It also need *more* dressing.  My salad came out really bland and dry.  I would also add more vegetables into the mix next time - carrots, pea pods, red peppers, etc.

very good! The combination of sauce, pasta, chicken and herbs is a great starting point to expand from. Next time I will use noodles instead of farfalle. I followed other reviews and kept oil at 1/3, that was plenty! Adding in tomatoes, peas and other veggies makes this a great dish

Yum! We loved this! We ate it warm for dinner, and I also had some cold for lunch leftovers - Great either way.   We did not have soy sauce, and so we used asian vinagarette - a lot.   Add shredded carrots, corn, and thinly diced red bell pepper. This would be good with just the veggies even.   Awesome.

Unbelievably good.  I add a cup of frozen green peas and a cup of frozen corn.  It does make a lot, but keeps really well - probably better day 2 or 3.

This was pretty good.  I used rice in place of the pasta because I had a ton leftover in the fridge.  (I think the pasta would  have been much better)

I was so excieted to find this recipe since it sounded so good. Well to be honest, it turned out to be very disappointed. I followed exact recipe except for using fresh ginger.  I don't like cilantro at all but I added anyways to just try it out. I have to agree with BROSNANFAN. It was very bland, unattractive looking, no kick to it and needed more soy sauce, vinegar and more ginger and something.

This was so good and EASY to make! The sauce was great tasting and was neither too much nor too little to coat the pasta/chicken perfectly. I added snow peas, and next time I will probably add shredded carrots, too. It didn't have a lot of color/substance and needs veggies. SO yummy though!

I thought this was really good and easy to make. It did taste a little bit like vegetable oil though. When I make it again I will cut the oil in half and use olive oil. I also used fresh ginger juice instead of the power. This was a picnic hit and I made enough for twenty or more people by doubling the recipe.

This was really good and very easy!  I only used 1/3 c oil and it was still too oily.  Next time I think I'll only put in 1/4 c of the oil, rice wine vinegar and soy sauce.  I also added julienned carrots and water chestnuts.  I left out the cilantro because I didn't have it, but it was still good.  Would also be great with some cashews.

This was good - I doubled the dressing though (only used the 1/4 cup veg oil total), as it seemed to be light on the flavor. As others mentioned, I added some grated carrots just for color. I imagine this is better the next day...FYI.

This was great and very easy!  I added some chopped broccoli, shredded carrots, and matchstick strips of red and green peppers for some added veggie nutrition.  The sesame flavor was not overpowering, but next time, I may add some sesame oil to the dressing to make it a bit more noticeable.  I might also add a bit of chili sauce for some kick.

This is a really good recipe.  I did however, make some small changes.  I added about a tablespoon of peanut butter to the dressing which gives it a nice nutty taste.  I also added roasted peanuts just before serving ( or to each individual serving).  I also used whole wheat rotini pasta instead of bow ties.  The rotini holds onto the dressing very nicely.  This recipe is even better the second day!

Fantasic sauce. I used thick Japanese noodles (well worth the trip to the Asian supermarket), cut the vegtable oil in half, and threw in some shredded carrots, bean sprouts, and pea pods. I forgot to add the cilantro but will add it next time. My finicky-eater BF cleaned his entire plate which I can't say I've ever seen him do!

I made this salad for a potluck at work and everyone loved it!!  The only change I made was double the dressing recipe with the exception of the vegetable oil.  It was very good and I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is delicious hot or cold!  Whenever I bring this anywhere, people always ask for the recipe.  To make it heart-healthier, I use canola oil in place of vegetable oil.  You can definitely get away with using less oil. We eat this as a main dish and as a topper for mixed greens. Best of all, I can make it on the weekend and eat leftovers all week.  It gets better with age!

Fantastic!  So light tasting!  My family loved it, including my two year old daughter.  I assembled my salad the night before and let it marinate itself, and it was wonderful.  My mother-in-law even asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again......so quick, easy and tasty.

I made this for dinner this evening.  My husband was working late, so I ate it at room temperature and it was great.  I served it to him later in the evening after refrigerating for several hours and it was even better.  He said it was definitely a "keeper recipe."  Even my 2-1/2 year old daughter loved it.  I used grilled chicken breast and whole wheat rotini (corkscrew pasta).  I didn't read any of the reviews before making this, but think the suggestions of additional veggies is a great idea too!

This is a great recipe but I did decide to add a few more veggies.  I added carrots, broccoli, edamame, and mango.  Because I added more ingredients, I had to make a little extra sauce.  With the extra veggies it makes an excellent meal all on its own!

One of my favorite recipes on the site! Easy and delicious! I leave out the cilantro because my family doesn't like it.  I also add manderine oranges and top it with crispy Chinese noodles.  So good warm or cold.  Better cold.

I have made this recipe many times, and now everytime I am invited to a party I am asked to bring it.  People LOVE it.  Perfect for summer parties.  For the holidays this year I have been asked to bring it to 2 different parties, and I will garnish with grape tomatoes and fresh cilantro to make it look seasonal.  It is so delicious I can't wait to put aside a small bowl just for me!

This is my first time posting and I definitely don't feel like this deserves a top tier rating for this site.  I read previous reviews and agree with a lot of the negatives.  The flavor really did not stand out for all of the great ingredients that went into it.  I will keep looking.

One of my absolute favorite recipes on this site!  As long as I keep the ingredients on hand, I have a wonderful dish at my finger tips.
I have added various veggies to this dish.  Basically, what I have in the fridge.  Anything pretty much works.  I usually increase the dressing by 50% and I add half the dressing to hot pasta so it absorbs the flavor.  I toss the rest in shortly before serving.

Delicious!  I did not add chicken, to make it vegetarian.  I added one large can of waterchestnuts (drained) and about a cup of shredded carrots.  Yum!  Will definitely make again!

This wasn't as good as I expected.  Everyone ate it but the family agreed, it needs something with a crunch, maybe water chestnuts or veggies.

Highly recommend this recipe.  Easy to make and delicious tasting.  I added grape tomatoes and two sliced avocados to the salad, brought it to the party, and it was a huge hit.  Everyone loved it.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I added a shredded carrot and some snap peas for much-needed color and a little crunch.  I also thought the dressing was a tad sweet and would cut the sugar down to maybe 2 Tbsp. next time.  And 1/3 cup oil seemed just right.  DH & I thought this was pretty good, but it was not kid-friendly at our house.

This recipe is great! I doubled the dressing though, because I don't like really dry pasta salads.  The sauce would be nice for salad dressing too.

I think I probably added too many seasame seeds because that was the dominating flavour. Next time I will add more rice wine vingear to give it a  bit more bang. My friends really enjoyed it. Extras I added: 1 cup frozen peas and parsley.

This is FABULOUS!! I added 1/2 t. of crushed red pepper and a t. of minced garlic, otherwise kept it all the same. The flavor of this dressing is sooooo good, I highly recommend adding the garlic and red pepper if you like a little zing!! This is going to become a staple!!!

Delicious!  It was even better after it sat for a day to allow the flavors to meld.  You may want to add a red pepper, as the presentation is a little bland, and doesn't do the flavor justice.

I'll give it 3 stars only because 3 out of the 5 members of my family thought I should make this again (myself included).  Definitely a departure from traditional chicken pasta dishes.  I liked the ginger taste.  Didn't have rice vinegar on hand, so I used regular white vinegar instead, and it still tasted good to me.  For the sesame oil I used a tablespoon of the oil from a jar of sesame seed tahini.  I also added a can of sliced water chestnuts for a little bit of crunch.  Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't seem to "crunch" enough with just the sesame seeds.  Tasty, but I would add something like toasted ramen noodles to it...next time!

I thought the flavor was delicious. Made it for a party of 40 people and doubled the recipe . I am not sure why it didn't make a hit. i had lots left over. I did have too much food overall though. i think I gave my guests too many choices. i truly loved the flavor and will try it again on a different crowd. Sometimes cilantro scare people away????

I thought the recipe was very good. I made a little modification. I added Sriracha HOT chili sauce to make it a little more spicy. I replaced onion with celery and red bell pepper to give it some colors, and omit the cilantro.

Once I made the dressing for this, I knew this would be a great recipe.  I didn't have any chicken on hand, so I lightly sauteed one chopped red pepper, some matchstick carrots, some frozen green peas and scallions.  I let that cool then added to the bowties and dressing.  It was so good!!!

This was delicious.  I used ginger soy sauce after reading one of the reviews that said it didn't have enough ginger taste.  I also used hot sesame oil and tossed in some chopped red pepper, sugar snap peas and some shredded carrots for color and crunch.  I also garnished it with some chopped cashews.  Yum.

This was great - and so easy.  It usually takes me longer than most - but I was ready to head to the park for a picnic in 30 minutes.  I did the dressing and chopping while the pasta cooked.  I used 1/4 cup oil and did not end up putting all of the dressing on.  Saved the rest - will add to the leftovers.  Used a rotisserie chicken to save time.  Also added water chestnuts.

Awesome recipe.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  I used a little less oil, as some suggested. (I used Enova).  I also used Japanese Udon noodles and they were wonderful!  They're like really thick spaghetti.  Yummmmmm!!!  We ate it hot the first night and then cold the next day as leftovers.  Both were so good.  It's a taste you'll crave!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was so quick and easy.  I followed a few of the reader's advice and cut the oil back to 1/3 cup.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added a few more veggies to the mix.  It was delicious and boyfriend has requested leftovers for tomorrow!

This was soooo good, I loved it so much I had to make it again a day later because I couldn't stop craving it! I added shredded carrot and sugar snap peas one time and brocolli and carrot the second, and both were very good. Also, I used the already cooked and cubed chicken, which cut down on the prep. time! I have not tried it cold yet since we eat it all up every time I make it, but I've heard that's good.

This was really easy and delicious!  Can't wait to taste it the next day cold.  Only suggestion I have is to reduce the veg oil and maybe punch it up a bit with a few dashes of hot sesame oil.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was fast and easy.  It was good right after I made it, but maybe slightly oily.  But I didn't get around to eating it for over an hour, and by then the oiliness was gone and it was perfect. Definitely one to make ahead.  I'm looking forward to having it for lunch tomorrow.

This is an excellent dish. It was very easy to make and like lasagna it tasted better the next day, after the flavors had time to meld together. It could stand to have a vegetable thrown in like some broccoli florets. Either way it is delicious.  This is definitely a party/potluck favorite!

Okay, kind of a mild taste although I did marinate it overnight.  Just before serving sprinkled chopped tomatoes, green onions and sesame seeds so it didn't look so "brown" which definitely upped it's appearance.

This was great! Very refreshing for a summer meal, and it was great since I made this earlier in the day and was able to have dinner without cooking in my hot apartment. (We ate this cold). I left out the green onions, used about half the amount of sesame seeds called for, and cut the oil by about half (a definite must for this recipe). If you like cilantro, definitely don't leave it out- it makes it so much better. Delicious. I couldn't stop eating it.

You only need about half of the dressing (unless you like oil). Much better after sitting overnight in the refrigerator- noodles had a chance to soak up the dressing.

Made this for an office party. It was delicious but I thought it needed a little more zip. Maybe some red pepper flakes?

This was awesome! My whole family loved it. I have already made this 3 times in the last week. I think that it definatly tastes better when it's cold. I also added some crushed red peppers and Madarian Oranges and left out the cilantro.

Yummy. Loved this. Thanks to other reviewers suggestions I too used EVOO instead of vegetable oil and cut it down to 1/3cup. Also, I cooked it last night and served it today. Definitely prepare it the day before serving! Taste is that much better! Also, I think the cilantro is the star here. Thanks for sharing, I'll be making this again.

Friends really enjoyed it, but I thought it needed more dressing.  Next time, I will follow the other's advice and lessen the oil.  The dressing smells so good!  I had no idea it was to be served hot - I thought it was to be served cold.  Oh well!  Thanks!

This is so good.  I only put in 1/4 c. oil and that was really all it needed.  I wasn't sure about the cilantro at first but it adds a unique taste to this Asian dish...would taste great with or without!

This is wonderful!!!  I use it as a sidedish, but I omit the chicken.  I usually serve it with an asian style burger and it is a great match. It's also a good light summer lunch. You can definitely cut back on the oil if you want. Thanks!

I made a few changes and it turned out fantastic!  I decreased oil to 1/4c. olive oil, and omitted the cilantro and ginger.  Also, I wanted something creamy, so I added a few heaping spoonfuls of mayo.  Would also be great without the mayo, or without the pasta and served on bread.  Excellent!!

I made the Asian Ginger dressing (also from this site) and was looking for some salad recipes to use it on and then realized that the dressing in this recipe was almost identical to the one I had just made except that this one had sugar. So I used that dressing and followed the rest of the recipe for this salad. It turned out great. I put some mandarin oranges in it for a different flavor and next time I will add some chow mein noodles as well.

I loved this.  I didn't have all the ingredients so I ad libbed.  I used lemon pepper on the chicken, cooked in a grill fry pan.  I didn't have green onions so I used dried.  Only had a dab of soy sauce so it needed some kick. I added some blue cheese dressing and it was totally awesome.

This is a wonderful change from the typical Italian dressing pasta salad.  And it is a great blank canvas to make your own.  I personally omit the green onions and add veggies such as julienned carrots and red bell pepper.  I also like adding either sriracha or red pepper flakes to the dressing for a kick.  Especially yummy topped with crushed peanuts for crunch!

Seasoned my Chicken with Salt, Pepper, Ginger and Sesame Oil.  Added Carrots & blanched Snap Peas.  Added a diced Tomato and plum Tomatoes.  I thought it was delicious.  BF thought it needed more of a vinegar punch.

This is a delicious salad. A twist on pasta salad which is what I was looking for. I made as directed but didn’t have bow tie pasta so used rigatoni which was fine. I also shredded a carrot and added some green onions. Next time I’ll add some cooked peas. I didn’t have a chicken breast to cook but I did have a can of Costco chicken which worked out well.

This was a very good pasta salad, though I did make some changes. Like other reviewers I only used a 1/4 cup oil and I scaled the sugar back just a bit. I added a large clove of garlic (minced), used fresh ginger (also minced) instead of dried, added about a cup of shelled edamame and a little less than that of sliced carrots. 

While I love spice, the rest of my family does not, but I bet this would be great with some hot chili flakes sprinkled in. I'll definitely make this again utilizing my changes and will experiment with other veggies (soybean or mung bean sprouts would probably be good, also broccoli or snap peas).

I need to figure out how to tweak this a bit more to our liking. Good base to start but it is bland in taste. We've added chili oil, sriracha, swapped out the bow ties for soba...added some edamame - but can't quite nail it.

Yummy....had a leftover whole baked chicken.  Did use the julienned carrots and pea pods that other reviewers tried and this dish was over the top!  (Also used a little less sugar).  I loved this dish.  Great for a pot luck dish or luncheon.  The sauce was amazing.

I really wish I had read the reviews before making this and, normally, this is what I do.  Forgot.  As written, it really has something left to be desired and those things are julienned carrots, snow pea pods and maybe some bell peppers.

Did not make any changes its great as it is. I get so many requests to make this, people just love it, so do we. Its the best matter of fact I change the amount of servings to 25 servings for feeding a crowd by request. Have to try it , it will be well worth it.

This is THE BEST Asian flaired pasta salad. I could not stop eating this. I would definitely recommend making this dish.  It makes a lot, so it’s good for a gathering, or sitting on the couch with a huge bowl and fork, gorging, like myself. Super recipe.

Good.  It needed a little salt in my opinion, but then again, I forgot to salt my pasta water.  I added some julienned carrots and a few snow pea pods which were both great additions to make it a little healthier.

Grilled the chicken instead of shredding it and added mushrooms.  I'll try it with less oil next time.

I reduced the vegetable oil to 1/4 cup, and added some chopped carrots and red bell pepper. I also just diced up the chicken and sautéd in a pan instead of shredding. Super easy and great to pack for lunches for the week!

I cannot count how many times I’ve made this salad since I found it several years ago.  It is my go to salad for potlucks and the one every one asks me to bring.  I have started to add match stick sliced red peppers and carrots and black sesame seeds for color.  Otherwise, I make exactly as the recipe calls for.  Thank you for sharing this gem!

Yummy! I made it with leftover chicken.  Added some shredded carrots. Also, added some chopped up arugula from the garden along with the cilantro.

The recipe was awesome!  And not only did my dinner party guests love it but my friend took a big bowl to work and shared it around and they were all asking for the recipe. 

Yes, I gave it to them. I reduced the oil by 1/8 of a cup - made no difference.

This is an absolute delicious recipe!  Easy to make and the flavor is scrumptious. Instead of veg oil I subbed sesame oil to give it an even stronger taste as one other reviewer recommended. I also tossed a little sriracha sauce on at the end to give it a little kick.

I have been making a variation of this recipe for nearly 20 years. It is a nice, light and refreshing dish to serve at BBQs or potlucks. I always make it as a meatless side dish. 

I find that any shaped pasta is fine for this recipe. It doesn't really matter. I also have been adding diced green and red peppers, shredded and diced carrots, and peas (frozen or canned with no salt) for color and texture.

This recipe is best when made at least 4-6 hours in advance. I like to make it 24 hours in advance. It stores very nicely in the refrigerator. Just keep it sealed in a glass or plastic dish with lid. The day you are serving, just shake really well to combine ingredients.

I have been making this recipe since I found it over 2 years ago.I've made it for a big family get together,  for my immediate family,  for a group of people who are rough and tumble folks who rack up an appetite by the end of a long day riding modified jeeps through killer trails, drop offs, rocks, & you name it! They picked my salad over the other meals or snacks available! I arrived with two very large bowls, stuffed to the top and came home with nothing! I didn't change much. I sliced up snow peas into thinstrips-as I did with a red bell pepper. The thin strip offers brilliant color, crunch, & texture against the noodles and chicken, but not too much crunch. I slice the green onion on a bias at the very end, but mostly the white & crisper green parts. They not only add that little zing, but stay flavorful if you dish it out without mixing them in all throughout.  They tend to get mushy. I do not add cilantro, carrots,  peas, or any of the many other suggestions.  Let me tell you! This salad has more than enough flavor without adding much more! I actually had to make it from memory tonight because I just couldn't  find this recipe -I had it saved on another tablet that I cannot charge to even get to the saved recipes! I only put in the wrong amount of sugar in the dressing...that was all! Everyone should make this salad. Don't be afraid of it. It's absolutely delicious!  Thank you so much for putting it out there for me to find.

This is excellent.  I brought it for a work lunch and it is all gone.  I did what other suggested - cut the oil in 1/2, used 2 T of sugar and added snow peas and shredded carrots (2).  I blanched the peas in with the pasta during the last minute of cooking.  I also used 2 T of sesame oil and omitted the cilantro.  I may add water chestnuts next time for a little more crunch.

Dressing is amazing. Made exactly as written except I did sub EVO for veg oil. Did not have chicken & did not miss. Used fettuccine noodles. Next time will add pea pods & carrots. Dreaming about this deliciousness! Thanks for great recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect!  Used rotisserie chicken and even bought bow tie pasta which was perfect. I added the pea pods and shredded carrots as it mentioned at the end of the video to "bulk it up with vegetables" and I'm glad I did. This will surely be made often. I love cold salads and this one is perfect - great taste, protein, veggies and pasta. Perfection.

My wife and I made froze a bunch of shredded chicken and froze it while she was pregnant. I was looking for something different to do with it and found this recipe. It was amazing! We both enjoyed it immensely! We have made it twice now and it barely lasts. Only difference is I used a 12oz box of pasta and more cilantro and onion only because I had nothing else to use them in and didn't want it to go to waste. A total keeper!

This is perfect to have on hand all summer long for impromptu get-togethers. Our family's favourite variation is to use quinoa instead of pasta and add half a bag of coleslaw mix.

I really liked it but agree the oil needs to be decreased to 1/3 cup.  I used shrimp instead of chicken since chicken was the main course at the bbq, and added a bit of red pepper flakes.  I will add some veggies to this the next time I make it - and I will definitely make it again!

I made this strictly using the recipe. It even had a chance to chill for a couple of hours. I like all the ingedients but somehow this salad seemed flat. I added salt which helped a little but it still tasted like it needed something. If I make it again  I'll try adding some of the veggies, etc. that others have recommended. To me there are better pasta salads around.

This recipe passed the taste test in our house.    It had great color, texture and taste.  Was very tasty.  The only thing I would modify is increasing the amount dressing a bit for heavier coating of greens and chicken.  Will be using this again!

Fed five 20 year olds following this recipe exactly. Left it in the fridge overnight, brought it to the beach about 12 hours after cooking it. 

THEY LOVED IT! Couldn't stop saying how delicious it was. Perfect meal if you don't have access to a microwave or constant cooling.  Will definitely make again. 

Might add some red pepper flakes or salty substance for an extra kick.

Very good summer dish. I completely ignored the proportions for the dressing and made it to taste, leaving out the vegetable oil. Likewise, I made it vegetarian with eggplant, bell peppers and zucchini, but could work with so many more veggies. I also lightly sautéed the veggies in sesame oil, ginger and hot pepper seeds. Then cooled and added the cilantro, dressing and sesame seeds. Next time will do with cashews. Enjoy!

The dressing is awesome! I made this as the main dish. 16 oz. of pasta is too much. IF I made this again, I would make it as a side dish, using only 1/2 the amount of pasta.

This salad has complex layers of flavors that make it very different from other pasta salads. I did half the oil and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added julienned carrots, sliced cherry tomatoes and sliced water chestnuts.

I made it with lettuce instead of pasta.  I need to keep the cilantro amount down.  Dressing is too greasy.

I have made this multiple times and it's always a hit with my family.  The flavorful sauce is devine.  I usually add matchstick carrots & sweet peas for extra crunch and color.

This is a huge hit for a "team meal"! Made many times for different groups, and everyone raved. 
I cut back the oil a bit. I use only about 2/3 of the dressing, so I reserve the toasted sesame seeds and toss them in later. (Since I want all of them in the salad). 
To cook the chicken breasts: Bring water to a boil ( I add in some teriaki if I have it) add chicken breasts with water to cover 1/2 inch over.  Return to boil, cover, remove from heat and let sit 15-20 minutes.

Great alternative to typical pasta salads. I used cavatappi noodles. Tasty as written. Next time, like others, I would add more veggies, like carrots and water chestnuts, and reduce oil a bit.

This was a lovely cold salad.  I didnt make the dressing from scratch , just bought some Asian dressing since that was a bit quicker (less mess).  I would definitely make this again

I only used half the cilantro (a little bit goes a long way) organic pasta and chicken. Combination bow tie and rotini dressed it up. So far all who have tasted it have asked for the recipe. We live in a hot region so it's  perfect as a main dish. Oh yeah I cut a corner by buying roasted sesame seeds...

Not bad by any means, but not great either. The sauce as written is a little off-balance (too oily in particular),  and some added veggies (carrots and snap peas as in the video) would make it much more visually appealing. It made for a nice dish at an outdoor outing, but I'm not dying to make it again.

I have made this several dozen times. I bring it to pot lucks all the time. I usually prep sauce and cook noodles night before; add a little sauce to noodles to soak in over night. I always add shredded carrots and snap peas. I also use canned chicken. When I get to the pot luck I separate the noodles into two bowls and add chicken to just one because this dish is a vegetarians delight without the meat. I followed tip from another cook who commented to cut the oil which is smart advice.

Seriously...this is incredibly delicious! The sauce is insane tasty. I decreased the amount of vegetable oil just because I felt it called for a lot. I used 1/4 cup of canola oil and followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written. This is one I WILL make many more times. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. DEVINE!

My husband didn't care about it. He said it didn't have a lot of flavor. The color was an unappealing brown, certainly not like the picture.

Very tasty!  I upped the green onion and black pepper a little, added a tsp of brown sugar, and about 1 1/2 Tbsp sriracha.  Was tasty after mixing but definitely let it sit and chill for those flavors to marry!

This is one of the best recipes I've found on this site.  I make this as part of my daughter's high school soccer team pre-game meal and it has become one of the girls' and coaches' favorites!  I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil for the dressing, and added shredded carrots and chopped red bell pepper.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is a great recipe when you need to prepare a quick meal to feed lots of people though I tend to use only 1/3 of the vegetable oil the recipe calls for.  I've also added shredded vegetables such as carrots, cucumber and yellow bell peppers to brighten up the salad and reduce the carb ratio.  You can also make it with the chicken on the side to create a vegan friendly option.  I've also tried grilling the chicken after marinating it in the dressing which gives the salad flavor without making all the pasta brown.

Awesome!!  A family favorite...I sautéed the green onions in olive oil with the rotisserie chicken for a couple mins before adding to the  8 oz broken in half linguini pasta, & dressing...topped with cilantro and tossed.  Made twice already and family loves it.  Thank you again for a great recipe

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand to make the asian sauce, so I used Lite Asian Dressing from Kraft! Works just as good! However, I did add the seasonings directly to the pasta. A little ginger goes a long way! I was a little heavy-handed, so it was a little hotter than i was expecting. Also, I added crumbled bacon and parmesean cheese. 

But it is delicious!

Loved it!!  I did it in the crock pot because it's super good to have in the summer and I don't want to stand over a hot stove for a long period of time.  I used a plastic bag crock pot liner and threw in everything except the noodles.  I also reduced the olive oil to about 1/3 C.  Cooked in the crock pot for about 5-6 hours on low, then shredded the chicken, put it back in the bag, and stuck the whole bag in the fridge until it was cool.  I boiled noodles on the stove, then rinsed them under cold water and added them to the bag as well for about 1/2 hour for the flavors to come together.  Everyone loved it.

This really has wonderful flavor!! I made the recipe as written except to reduce the oil to 1/3 cup and I used light olive oil. 5 stars for a great recipe!! But, my husband and I both agreed that it need more veggies! So, I added fresh peas from the garden, sliced carrots and sliced celery to the left overs the next day. I think any Asian style veggie would be good...broccoli, cabbage etc. We'll definitely make this again...perfect for using up left over roast whole chicken! And, it's filling enough to use as a main course with crusty bread.

The whole family loves this one!  We took it camping and it tasted wonderful.  We add many other veggies (plus garlic to the dressing) to make it as healthy as possible.

This was good. The dressing is very nice.  I used ready to eat shredded rotisserie chicken for quick and easy prep.  The kids heated theirs up in the microwave and it was good warm too.

Very good!  I thought 1/4 C. Of sesame seeds was an odd, large amount but it's not and they add a nice crunch.  I used a mixture of black and white sesame seeds for presentation.  The dressing is very good but I used regular soy sauce (not light or low sodium) and thought it still needed about 1 tsp. of salt.  I also reduced vegetable oil to 1/4 C. and doubled the sesame oil.  I went without chicken to make this a side dish, and left out the green onions as DH does not care for them.  I added 1 grated carrot and 1/4 C. sweet mini peppers, diced.  Great as is and easy to customize and play around with different additions.

Good base recipe to build your own dish from.  We made it as is, but found it lacking flavor.  Added some sweet chili sauce and it tasted much better.  Still felt like sweet chili sauce was not the best addition, so we will keep exploring to find the best addition(s) to tailor to everybody's preference.

Made for my sons baptism, the adults loved the spicy edge to it, the kids not so impressed. Eyed most of the ingredients instead of measuring and let it chill overnight.

This recipe is great!  Even my picky teenagers ate it.  I used pulled chicken from a store-bought rotisserie. I also added shredded carrots and broccoli for vegetables.  I will definitely make again.

I made this, this afternoon, put it in the fridge and then ran some errands. When I got home I tasted the salad and, it's so good I couldn't stop eating it! I followed the recipe with the exception of taking advice from previous reviews and cutting the oil back to a third of a cup, I used part vegetable and part EVOO, I used fettucini pasta, and rotisserie chicken, also added a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes. This was easy, quick, and excellent! Next time I may add extra veggies, but it's wonderful just the way the recipe is written!

This is a great recipe.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the vegetable oil to 1/3 cup.  I used Asian stir-fry noodles in place of bowtie pasta and threw in snap peas, baby corn and julienned carrots.  The sauce is very flavourful and tastes even better the next day.  This one is a keeper!

Loved the recipe.  I did use less vegetable oil and added shredded carrots.  Instead of bow tie pasta, I used a mixture of whole and spinach linguini.  Will be making this again many times over for sure.

I had some cooked chicken and cilantro to use so tried this.  We had it tonight and ate it warm.  Super easy and quick to throw together and yummy.  I used linguine and added shredded carrots, pea pods and chopped red pepper.  Made the rest as described in recipe.  It kind of tasted like Phad Thai.  I like sesame taste and thought this was too mild in that regard, however, i want to see what it tastes like tomorrow after cooled and had a chance to settle overnight. Would be great topped with chopped peanuts or cashews!!  Hubby loved it and had 3 helpings!!  Great for a summer meal.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.  Update:  Had it cold tonight....even better!!  Son ate 2 helpings saying delicicious, delicious.  You could taste the sesame a bit more but I am going to increase the sesame oil next time.

I loved this recipe so this is a keeper. I only use 1/4 cup of oil instead of 1/2 cup, added peanuts. I also cooked my chicken breasts with garlic salt and pepper instead of boiling it. It really added more flavor to the whole dish. I think I will add cooked broccoli and carrots to this recipe the next time when I make this dish again!

I really thought this recipe was very good.  Others commented on it being too oily so I did cut down on the amount of oil.  I am a sesame oil fan though (a little goes a long way) so added a drop more than called for.  I followed recipe otherwise and probably will be more adventurous next time, adding a few more ingredients such as sugar snaps, bok choy, or whatever else I have on hand.  Definitely a keeper!

I made substitutions based on the ingredients I had on hand...for the dressing I just used powdered ginger instead and then added a clove of crushed garlic and for the pasta I used rotini pasta, cilantro, peas, shredded carrots, diced red onion, crushed red pepper flakes, chopped almonds and plum tomatoes! Delish! This makes a ton, lots of leftovers!!!

I make this all the time and it is amazing! When I bring it to parties, people are in awe of how good it is. I never would have thought cilantro would taste so good with sesame oil and ginger. My son likes to substitute the chicken with sauteed tofu. I've also made it without the chicken and it's just as good.

Great flavor! Just tried this recipe and made a few adjustments.  Like others I decreased the amount of oil to 1/3 c. I also decreased the soy sauce to 1/4 c. Added 1 crushed garlic clove for added flavor. Didn't have sesame seeds on hand so used toasted almonds. Definitely a keeper, thanks!

Love! However, made the dressing with olive oil which was overpowering.  So I tried again with vegetable oil but just about 2T instead of 1/4c. It was perfect that way for us.  I don't like anything too oily. May want to cut down on amount of pasta if you cut out oil though. Didn't seem that there was enough.  Serve chilled and re toss before serving. Yum!

Great base recipe that is flexible based on ingredients on hand. I frequently substitute chopped, dry roasted peanuts for the sesame seeds.  I generally cut back or omit the chicken and instead substitute broccoli slaw.  I also cut back on the oil & make up the difference with water.  I also substitute Splenda for sugar...very nice, crunchy side dish.   Thanks ohines!

Always a summer favorite for my family. I made as the recipe stated. I do however suggest mixing half of the dressing and saving half to mix just before serving if you make this ahead as I do, the pasta really soaks the dressing up. DELICIOUS! Thank you for sharing!

Loved this recipe! Although I think the 1/2 cup vegetable oil was too much. I would reduce it to 1/3 cup next time. 

I also followed the other reviewers and added some cherry tomatoes, baby carrots and baby corn for more veggies! I cooked them separately and just added them during the last step. 

This recipe is a sure winner & so easy to do too :) Thanks!

Ten star recipe.  I have made this 3 times in about two weeks it is FANTASTIC.  I make it per the recipe except sub vegetable oil with canola oil and increase the ginger to 1 tsp. (personal taste preference).  YUM YUM YUM I will be making this for a very long time.  I feel guilty eating it thinking it MUST be bad for me, it tastes soooooo good but it's not at all.  Asian food is simply the best (IMHO!!!)

we liked it. I didn't add black pepper and I halved the sesame oil and used a little less vegetable oil. I also chopped up some fresh spinach and added it as well as some Soycatush frozen veggie mix from Trader Joes (edamame, corn, red bell peppers).

I've made this several times. I tend to be heavy handed with seasonings, BUT go easy on the oil.  DELICIOUS, easy, can be made ahead of time.  Adding cut snap peas and chopped water chestnuts jazzes up this recipe even more.

This is amazing!  I used some other comments and added Red, Yellow, and Orange bell pepper.  I also used wheat bow tie noodles. I packed this in 5 containers leaving the noodles and chicken seperate from the veggies and dressing so I could take it for a healthy lunch every day.  It has given me great energy and people have commented on how beautiful it is! Thank yoU :)

I substituted the vegetable oil for coconut oil, and the sugar for an equal amount of agave syrup. Next time, I think I will only do 1.5-2 T of agave; 3 was a little too sweet. The coconut oil worked perfectly. I made an equal substitution and microwaved the final mixture for 30 seconds and stirred to break up and melt the lumps. Shaking produced a nice homogeneous mixture. I also used roasted Korean sesame seeds, which gave it an interesting nutty flavor, and I didn't have to toast them.

We liked it. Nice change from the typical pasta salad. Went great with grilled chicken, I didn't add the chicken to the salad. I didnt have rice vinegar so i used apple cider vinegar and also added carrots and red bell pepper. I just love allrecipes.com keep these fab recipes coming.

This recipe was spot on. The Dressing was overflowing with flavor. All the ingredients complemented each other. Will build on this foundation. Will tweak a little to personalize. Perfect summertime salad to add as a go to side dish or main meal. Thanks

I was really excited to make this salad after all the super reviews, but I found in rather boring.  I followed the recipe except for these suggestions in the reviews - less vegetable oil; add carrots and bell peppers. I will not be making this again and have deleted it from my recipe box.

Nice flavour but odd combination.  I followed the recipe exactly & wasn't pleased. This would be much better I think as a rice dish with beef. As is, it comes off odd & unbalanced.  The spicing/sauce is lovely, just not with pasta & chicken.

Fabulous! I used 2 tablespoons of agave syrup instead of sugar. Gonna add 1 teaspoon cornstarch, and cook the dressing for a few minutes to thicken it up. I'll add the sesame oil after it cools because I've read that you're not supposed to cook sesame oil due to it's very low smoking point.  Like another reviewer said, the cornstarch might thicken it up, so it clings to the pasta better. Other than that, it's delicious!

I think the sesame seeds are what made this dish. I don't often use them but they gave an excellent flavor. Looking back at the ingredients, realized I left out the cilantro, one of my favorite herbs. Next time it will be even better! I also stirred in grated carrot; it'd be good with other fresh veggies, also.This ones's a keeper!

Cut the oil in 1/2 and used evoo, added frozen peas, fresh snap peas and carrots and only used 1/2 the pasta....the flavor is good, but just a little too mild...leaves you wishing for a stronger flavor...maybe after it sits overnite?  OK nope...seems even milder.  Just not quite working for us.

Delicious and flexible dish.  Agree it's more 'traditional' with linguine (I used whole grain) and that throwing in aditional veggies makes it extra yummy. I think I found my new "go to" week night dinner!

This is an excellent dish.  It is pretty easy to make.  We served is at a large gathering and the guests raved about it.  I would not change one thing about this recipe.  I recommend using the "Ray's Chicken" recipe available on this web site for the chicken that this dish calls for,

Next time I make this dish I'll tweak it by increasing the sauce and green onions and instead of using ground ginger, I'll use freshly sliced ginger and allow that to marinate in the sauce then strain it out later.

We loved it!  I added fresh broccoli to the pasta
during the last minute of cooking and some slivered almonds.

Used peanut oil, forgot the seeds, cut waaay back on the sesame oil (and I love the stuff!) brown sugar instead of white.   It seemed a
little to sweet for my taste, so squirted in some lime juice.  even better the next day.  Oh!  I 1/2 the pasta but kept the sauce ingredients the same.  Can add any raw vegies you like.  No chicken, but I did have shrimp.

This was really good.  Great way to use up leftover chkn.  I added sauteed red peppers for color and sweetness.  Next time, I'll add snow pea pods carrots and celery. Very versatile...but my young kids said "no, thanks!" Ahhh kids. Well at least they used their manners...

This was good but like all pasta salads, the noodles absorb much of the dressing.  I make sure and add lots of veggies to make up for it.

This recipe is awesome and gives just the right balance between flavours. It's one of my most-used summer recipes... sometimes I add some chopped spinach if there's some hanging around, but it's great just as it is. Super yummy.

This is amazing.  I added more veggies like red pepper, cucumber and folded in some spinach.  I went with the suggestion to use rotisserie chicken and would recommend that as well.  The flavor of the sauce is incredibly delicious.  Will absolutely make again and again.

I really enjoyed this salad. It had nice flavor, the only thing is I do enjoy something with a little kick so next time was thinking of adding in a little spice somewhere. Easy to prepare if you do the pre-made rotisserie chicken! I added in tomatos and cucumbers to beef it up for a main dish.

This may be my favorite pasta salad.  The Asian flavor is spot on.  I made the recipe as directed with the exception of changing the cilantro for Italian parsley.  Other than that, I wouldn’t make any changes.  It’s the perfect meal for a hot summer day.

Made this salad for a Fantasy Football Draft.  The taste was great but the pasta was rather dry. I made another batch of dressing and that helped but I think maybe cutting the oil to 1/3 C contributed to the dryness. Next time I think I will increase the oil.

I added angel hair noodles instead of bowtie, and used cubed chicken breasts instead of shredded. Also, when cooking the chicken I added a little Siracha for spice, and a bit more in the sauce. It was very good. If wanted you can serve with peanut sauce, it adds a unique flavor.

AWESOME!  Made for a potluck and had lots of requests for the recipe.  I added part of a bag of shredded broccoli slaw mix, and sliced some pea pods too.  I also added a chopped red bell pepper and some garlic powder.  I used linguine instead of bow tie pasta.

I made this on a day where the heat index was nearly 110.  It was very popular, but I had forgotten the reviews that mentioned the amount of oil - they were right.  When I make this again, I will decrease the oil, add a little salt and perhaps add some quartered cherry tomatoes.

Delicious and easy. Used whole wheat pasta and added matchstick carrots and peapods for veggies. Great right away and as leftovers. Only used 1/3c of oil and it was perfect. Dried cilantro works if you don't have fresh.

Though we normally don't care for pasta salads, the recipe looked good so I made this for my husband and me. He really liked it because he said the oil wasn't overpowing. I used macaroni since that is all I had. I also had no seasame seeds so I substitued crushed peanuts. We both liked that addition. Thanks!

This was YUMMY!  I had all the ingredients except the cilantro and it wasn't missed.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again.  Would be great with shredded cabbage instead of pasta for a lower-carb version.  Will play around with different veggies too!

Loved this.  Alot. My husband, a great cook in his own right, is bad about not reading ahead and collecting ingredients so he started making this with no scallions/green onions, fresh ginger or fresh cilantro.  We made it with dried cilantro and dried gringer and left out the onions.  We were all out of sesame seeds to.  Oddly enough, it was good but with the right stuff could be phenomenal.  Do yourself a favor - do NOT omit the cilantro and use fresh, please use fresh ginger, the scallions would help.  Cut back on the oil, EVOO would be ok but the sesame oil is enough.  I'd use black and regular sesame seeds for appearance and go with the julienned carrots and angle-cut snap peas.  Bowtie pasta is fine but penne worked well to hold the dressing. Crushed cashews would be a great finshing touch.  Most importantly - either double batch it and eat some the day you make it but save the most for the following day or for *best* flavor - let it sit overnight!  All in all, we liked it enough that this was the first review I took the time to write.

This was SO DELICIOUS! I made it for a picnic with the bf and we both absolutely LOVED it. We left out the cilantro and used red wine vinegar because that's what we had on hand along with spiral (rotini) instead of farfalle and added some edamame beans and corn to the mix. Definitely wait for the flavors to mingle. It's THAT much better the next day and worth the wait. Make ahead of time if possible. I'm making it again tonight to chill for another picnic tomorrow but trying it with elbow macaroni-again that's what i have on hand

This is a really delicious pasta salad.  I added broccoli and shredded carrots.  My only critique is that I thought it could use more sauce because the sauce is absorbed as the pasta salad sits.  Next time I will make 1.5x the sauce.  Other than that, great recipe!

OMG!!! #1- it makes ALOT! I wasn't comprehending just how much it made. Passing it around to some friends and neighbors. #2- awesome flavor. used canned chicken, but next time will use the frozen grilled tenders. #3- made the usual changes: olive oil and only 1/3 cup. Didn't use any sesame oil- it's expensive.. and the toasted sesame seeds gave enough flavor there. Can hardly wait for tomorrow when the flavors really get a chance to "mingle". This is a keeper!

I found this salad to be very bland. I followed directions although others said not to add all of the dressing and maybe I should have!  If it werent for the spring rolls I made to go on the side, this dinner would have been completely forgettable.

Good flavors.  I like that it is not mayonnaise based so it is easier to take along for picnics, etc.   However, the next time I make it, I think I will add some Asian-style vegetables, like shredded carrots or snow peas,  to give it some additional crunch/texture.     I also liked another reviewer's suggestion of marinading the chicken in some of the dressing before grilling. That would be worth trying as well.

Just a heads up- this is an expensive recipe. Doubled the pasta/spices, but not the oils. Also, used olive oil instead of veggie. I ended up using a lot more pepper than called for. I dodn't care for this too much, but my family loved it, even my 1 year old nephew!

AWESOME.  Because there are only 2 of us, I used 1/2 the dressing to marinade the uncooked chicken breasts for an hour.  Cook the breasts on the grill and discarded that portion of the dressing/marinade.  Used 1/2 box of pasta, put in some carrots and sliced black olives - LOVED the flavors.

I omitted the sesame seeds and oil (yes, it's lame to make a sesame recipe with no sesame!) because we were out, but it turned out delicious! Instead of using the full amount of oil, I used equal parts veg oil, regular soy sauce, and rice vinegar. And as others suggested, I only mixed in half the dressing before chilling and I added the rest when I served it. Yum! Thanks for sharing!

I love this! I've made this twice so far. The first time, I used 1/3 cup of vegetable oil per other reviewers & thought it came out great. ( I used only 1 store bought rotisserie chicken)  The second time, I added peas and corn.

FANTASTIC pasta salad!  I've made it several times, sometimes with chicken and other times with shrimp. Both versions were big hits and taste even better if you allow the pasta to sit overnight.

This is always a great hit but I usually add some sort of green to it.  My family does not like cilantro but I blanch some pea pods and add them to make it a meal.

I followed the recipe to a T and what I got wasn't that great... way too greasy. I should have read the other user's comments about oil, but I don't think I'll make this ever again. The flavor was ok, but I couldn't get over the grease.

Wonderful! Other reviewers are right - the sauce really does makes this dish! Great either served piping hot right away or even at room temp. Also great heated up or at room temp the next day. 

Instead of shredded chicken, we added already cooked chicken strips cut into cubes (a honey-roasted kind for extra sweetness) that we sauteed with a little garlic. Also added broccoli, carrots, zucchini, mushrooms (all sauteed with garlic for extra flavor, crunch, color and nutrition!). Adding veggies to this dish takes it a long way. Yummy! 

Have entertained many family and friends with this dish and everyone loves it! 

Thank you for this dish! :D

This is a very tasty and refreshing salad, but PLEASE don't eat it the day you make it. A day in the frig makes it SO much better. I added some grated carrots, chopped sweet red pepper and red pepper flakes. Also, be sure to follow the author's directions and shred the chicken - that makes a huge difference. Thanks for the recipe. It will become one of our summer staples.

I made this recipe to use some leftover chicken and it turned out pleasant enough.  I used egg noodles cause that's all I had but I think that I will add some garlic to the dressing next time.  Even my very picky son loved it!

I first gave this 4 stars after just tasting it. But after I had an entire serving of this I wanted to take my rating back. The flavor is nice for a few bites but became really overwhelming really fast. I don't see it as light at all, the flavor is quite heavy. And this was after I followed some suggestions to scale back the oil and add veggies.  I won't make it again.

My husband loves cilantro which means he loves this recipe.  It's easy and so refreshing.  I have made it all year long.  I think I will add some sugar snap peas and carrots when I make it later this week.

Easy to make and better the next day.  I reduced oil to 1/4 cup oil and it tasted great.

Flavor of sauce wasn't anything to speak of, and it made my kitchen smell funny.  I didn't mind eating it for supper, but I won't be making it again.

Meh. This was quite mediocre, IMHO. I wanted to make something quick for lunches this past week, but had little time available to cook over the weekend. This recipe seemed to fit the bill perfectly (and it certainly did!), but unfortunately, the end result was just so-so. For starters, once refrigerated, everything dried up (it's as if the sauce completely evaporated...). Additionally, eaten fresh, the flavors didn't have a chance to "meld" and the sesame taste was totally overwhelming. On day 2 (and now day 3), the flavor has improved, but my pasta is dry as a bone :( I scaled this recipe to 7 servings because I only had 2 cups worth of chicken (I purchased 2 (8 oz.) bags of oven roasted chicken strips on sale at my local grocer and cut them into tiny pieces - this was WAAAAY cheaper than purchasing a rotisserie chicken or a large "chunk" from my deli counter and much quicker than cubing/shredding myself). I wish I would have made the full 10 servings worth of dressing. I believe that would have taken care of the dryness issue, at least somewhat. Served with a ciabatta roll, this makes for a filling, yet light lunch. I just don't think I like this enough to add to my regular rotation. Thanks for sharing :)

I would not make this recipe again. I following the instructions except for reducing the oil and adding some frozen peas, and I found it really, really bland. I actually went over the recipe twice because I was convinced I'd forgotten an ingredient, but I hadn't- the recipe is just blah.  It doesn't taste like much of anything- it's vaguely sweet and vaguely salty, not actually off-putting but not at all appealing. I love sesame noodles and was hoping for a way to get that taste at home, but this is not it.

This isn't a very fancy or sophisticated dish, but for a quick supper or lunch, it's quite good! Love the sesame seeds and the cilantro.

We really liked this a lot, I only gave it 4 stars because by itself it is rather plain (except for the dressing). I took others advice and added snap peas, water chestnuts and slivered carrots. It was delicious. The only change I made to the dressing was I only used 1/2 of the oil called for. Don't leave out the cilantro if you like it... it adds a bit of a complex surprising flavor.

I made this for Labor Day and had quite a bit left, so I placed it in a freezer-proof container and took it out today.  I warmed it up in the microwave and mmmm, mmmm good!  In my opinion, it tasted better warm than it did cold.  This freezes beautifully.

Nice flavor.  I only used 1/3 c. oil, but if I make it again, I would try using 3 T of oil; I didn't care for the oily feeling.  I sauteed white onions (didn't have green), carrots, and celery in a tiny bit of the oil for crunch and color.  I didn't think the cilantro belonged in here, so I omitted it, and I substituted thin spaghetti for the bow tie pasta.  I garnished with additional toasted sesame seeds.

This worked well for a ladies' luncheon.  I added sugarsnap peas, chopped sweet red pepper and water chestnuts.  As some of the other reviewers suggested, I made all the dressing, but used only half after taste-testing.  Will make again.

I followed some suggestions - used just 1/3 cup oil, used high fiber, low carb linguine and snapped it.  The dressing is fabulous.  My family including my 4 year old loved it!  Will definitely make this again!

I made this because of the stellar reviews, and I have to say I was a little disappointed.  The dressing was the best part of it, but it lacked something.  It needs a little color (red pepper, carrot, etc.) to make it more visually appealing.  I'm also not a huge fan of bow tie pasta.    If you make it, I'd consider adding a few additional items.

Thank you for a flavorful, easy recipe. I made it for the first time last night and followed the directions very closely except for the cilantro. Don't care for it, so I substituted blanched broccoli flowerets. Turned out great. The dressing is outstanding. I can think of many variations for this recipe and the dressing will be the key that makes it work every time! Perfect for leftover chicken, but I will also try with leftover roast beef.  Thanks again!

This pasta salad was so popular!  I brought it to a Lakers BBQ and guests were raving.  The dressing is out of this world, I doubled all of the ingredients to make it except the oil and it came out just delicious!  I only modified a couple things to the pasta too.  To spice it up a bit, I added a bit (1/2 tablespoon) of the asian chili paste to the dressing.  I also added shredded carrots, edamame, water chestnuts, cucumber and mandarin oranges to the mix.  It added a crunch and a sweet surprise to it and really made the salad quite colorful as well.  Absolutely loved this recipe though and will for sure make it again.

This was sooo good.  I also reduced the oil to a 1/3 cup and might even go a little bit less.  I also think the cilantro and green onions are a must, I wouldn't leave either out.

My favorite recipe of all time!! I first made it with the cilantro but I have to say that although I loved the recipe, I thought it might be better without it. Hubby agreed so I made it again without the cilantro and it was even better! It's so versatile too. I am going to try different combos with vegetables and maybe nuts. I am thinking of carrots and broccoli and maybe a few almonds or cashews. My mouth is watering thinking about it. I definitely recommend using this recipe and making it your own way. It's delicious!

Made this a while ago for a potluck and most of it was gone by the end.  Brought the small amount of leftovers to my girlfriend, and she absolutely loved it, and recently asked me to make some for her.  I do usually omit the cilantro, and have reduced the amount of vegetable oil to 1/3 cup, since it becomes too oily otherwise.

My family LOVES this dish. I make extra sauce and cook the chicken in it to give some extra flavor to the chicken. I also cube the chicken before cooking and serve the dish warm.

I made this for my sons's graduation party and it was the favorite dish of the party. I did make a few changes to this recipe.  I omitted the original sesame seeds and added sliced almonds. I used T. Marzetti's salad accents in asian flair and added both of those before I served it.  The T. marzetti's salad accents are great because it has the sesame seeds, the crunchy asian noodles and sliced almonds. It really added alot to this salad.  Everyone loved this and I have made at least 10 copies of this recipe. Oh and one last thing this salad is also wonderful heated up too!

Easy to make. Excellent flavor.  I left out the chicken and it was a great side dish.

This recipe is wonderful!  I was actually looking for a side dish and this is perfect!  I eliminated the chicken but added, carrots, broccoli, snap peas, and red pepper.  I made it for dinner but just had a plate for lunch and noticed the dressing soaked into the pasta while it sat making it a bit dry.  I am just going to make another batch of dressing.  This would also make a simple tasty meal with chicken.  Even more simple, use a cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.

This is fantastic! Brought it to a potluck and everyone loved it. I cut back the oil to 1/3 cup as others suggested and used fresh ginger (not ground.) Also, I doubled the dressing which was perfect for a pound of pasta, plus all the additional veggies I added.

I made this salad for dinner on Sunday for me and my boyfriend thinking we would have leftovers all week, but it was gone after one day he liked it so much!  I followed recipe except for reducing oil to 1/3 cup and adding red pepper.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I make it often especially when I have other Asian friends over for dinner.  The dressing is what adds an Asian flair to the dish!

This was a good pasta salad. I added sugar snap peas and red pepper. If I were to make it again, I would add more vegetables. Without the veggies, it would have been very boring, despite the yummy dressing.

I love this salad. I make it every summer and bring it to BBQ's and Potlucks. I too use rotisserie chicken. The only change I made is that I cut down on the sugar just a bit and always add shredded carrots and either snap peas or snow peas! Beautiful and colorful. I am sneaking in the fridge with my fork with the left overs too. I can eat it for days. It's also good heated.

Best pasta salad Ive ever made at home. I was on the hunt for a pasta salad to come close to an Asian-influenced one from a local deli that I adore, and while this one was different, it was equally yummy on its own merit!  Changes I made: I added a handful of julienned carrots, which i highly recommend for a nice crunch and it makes the salad MUCH prettier. I doubled the cilantro, because I personally love cilantro and thought the amount was too little, and for the chicken, i got a rotisserie chicken from my grocer and shredded that, which i think made it even more flavorful, since they generally inject those types of chicken with flavorings/juices.   This pasta salad was so dang good, it had me hunched over my Tupperware bin full of leftovers, gobbling it down whenever i could! definitely a new staple in my household diet!

This was a fabulous recipe. The only thing I changed is that I added some peas. I brought it to a party at work and everybody loved it. I'll be sure to make this again!

Update: Every single time I have taken this to a potluck, I have always gotten at least one request for this recipe. It's so good!

This pasta was sooo yummy and so simple to make. Next time I will add more chicken because 2 chicken breasts were not enough. I had no idea what to make for dinner tonight but this recipe was so easy and I had everything to make it with already!

I normally read the reviews and follow general consensus from you guys reveiws, but this time I was in a hurry, and didn't take a look.  My mistake.  I *really* wished I had cut the oil way down, probably to 1/3 cup.  I was making it as a side, so I didn't use the chicken.  I did add some veggies ( green, red, and yellow bell pepper) and finely diced carrot.  I think some cucumer would be good.  I forgot to get green onions but I had some shallots around, so I subbed them.  For pasta, I used mini farfalle.  Tasted great.  I'll make it again, just with a lot less oil.

DE-LISH! This was a very easy dinner to put together. I broiled thin sliced chicken breast on low while I cooked one box of angel hair whole wheat spaghetti. I made the dressing as provided, but I felt like the soy sauce overpowered. So, I added an entire extra 1/3 cup of rice wine vinegar and extra sesame oil. Perfect! I also added 1 finely chopped jalepeno (no veins or seeds). I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!

Another hit today.  I made this as a side to Chinese pork chops so I didn't put in the chicken.  The dressing is so good!!  I used multigrain rotini.  A nice pasta salad to go along with the pork chops.  I'm sure this is great with the chicken in it too.  Will definately try that also.

This is a good recipe, but it lacked tang and flavor. I added shrimp, tripled the amount of ginger and added more garlic for some extra tang. Next time I will also use the regular soya sauce instead of the reduced sodium one.

Very good recipe...it made lots and lots.  Next time I might cut down on the pasta...also, I added lots of veggies (julienne carrots, celery, green and yellow peppers, yellow cherry tomatoes, regular tomatoes, green onion, scallions).  Also, it needs a little salt added.  Will definitely prepare again.

This was good, made a few changes b/c of what I had/didn't have on hand ... only change I would make is that I would sprinkle in the sesame seeds separately instead of mixing in with the dressing so that I don't loose all the ones that get stuck inside my narrow salad dressing jar.

I made it according to the recipe and found it really lacking. Maybe if you added more ingredients as other reviews did, it might be better. BUT!!! you have completely altered the original recipe.

Always a hit wherever I take it to!  I usually leave out the chicken and add veggies like red bell pepper, mushrooms, sugar snap peas, etc.  I also prefer to use rainbow rigatoni or penne pasta instead of the bowties.

Delicious recipe. If my 3-year-old will eat anything, I'm willing to make it every week. Thanks for adding to our family's repertoire. The only thing I changed was to add a tad bit more soy sauce--just a tablespoon or so more. I also think it's key to add the sesame seeds into the dressing instead of mixing it into the salad after the fact. The sesame flavor comes out much better that way.

This was just ok.  Everybody ate it and said it was good, but to me it tasted very "store-bought".  We had a lot left over and had to eat it the next night and it does NOT reheat well at ALL.  I probably will not make again.

This was really good. It needs veggies, though. We added some green beans, but it would be great with shredded carrots, snow peas and water chestnuts/celery for some crunch. Tasty!!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. I've made this so many times I don't need the recipe anymore but have to keep printing it for other people. I always leave out the veg.oil, use chinese noodles and add snow peas. It's better the next day if you can wait that long.

I used linguini noodles and sort of made it into a lo mein. I added mushrooms and bok choy and water chestnuts and an Asian medley from the frozen food section that had snap peas, broccoli, peppers, and baby corn. I added cilantro and green onions for garnish. I also made Traditional Potstickers found on this site and it was a great Asian theme night at my house! My hubby was so impressed! The sauce was great and pretty easy. I made the sauce first and kept it in the fridge while I made everything else and cooked the noodles al dente and sauced them as soon as they came out of the pot so they could soak up the sauce. The more the sauce sits the longer it develops because tasting it this morning right out of the fridge it was an explosion of flavor. Can't wait to eat the leftovers...what little is left!

As listed the recipe is a good starting point. I personally found it a bit lackluster though. I added broccoli, cauliflower, red pepper and a bit of raw onion in addition to some cashews for crunch. It still feels like it's missing something however. But it's a good recipe with which to experiment. Thanks!

Husband really liked the leftovers. He thought it was better when the sauce blended. I gave it a 3 though because I thought it was lacking in color & texture. I'll make again probably, but add something like celery, sugar snap peas, spinach or red onion thrown in. I guess it will be an "experiment" as to what is added. Will definitely make ahead & let the flavors marinate together. With the changes it would be a 4 or 5 star rating.

I love this recipe, but did have to make a few changes. Cut the oil in at least 1/2, the full amount is no where near necessary and almost too heavy. I used whoe wheat pasta and omitted the salt and it was great.

This was great! I added an extra tbsp of sugar because my family likes slightly sweeter dressings but I am sure it is good the original way also. I also used apple cider vinegar instead because I was out of rice. Added extra veggies as others recommended. Thank you for a great summer recipe.

I make this all the time now. I recommend you use black sesame seeds as they have a stronger flavor and they don't need to be roasted. Also add a little more ginger (about 50% more) as it gives it just a little more "kick". Really great pasta salad!

What a great recipe! Sitting in the fridge awhile - overnight is great -  does give the flavors time to blend & gives it a fuller, more mellow flavor, but I've served it immediately & it's great that way as well. My favorite version is tossing in some grape tomatoes (halved if I have time) & blanched sugar snap peas just before serving.

This is absolutely delicious. I couldn't believe how mild yet flavorful the sauce was; I also like the idea of using a capped bottle for mixing the sauce. I'll be making this again in the near future.

Turned out great. I added broccoli and red peppers for added nutrition and color. I also added a bit of red pepper flakes for a little more zing.

I made this yesterday for my DH and I for lunch today and it was just ok; the flavour was pretty boring I found...it just needs more in it I think. If I were to make this again (which probably isn't likely), I would add some veggies like red pepper, blanched snow peas and some carrot.

Overall a pretty good recipe. I don't think I cared for the sesame seeds very much. I replaced the bowtie with whole wheat rotini. Next time, I'll chop the cilantro extremely fine as it was a bit leafy in the recipe. The flavor was very good, nutty and Asian. I'll make some changes and try it again soon.

This was really good. I used a rotisserie chicken and pulled all the meat off the bone, and added mandarin oranges, cucumbers and edamame for some crunch. My boyfriend proclaimed it to be a current favorite recipe of his! Thanks!

It was wonderful.  For me, it tasted better the next day.  I had to cut the recipe to 1/4. I didn't have rice vinegar so I just added few drops of distilled white vinegar.  I also added some crushed red pepper just because I like it semi-hot.  I'm going to make this next time when I go to a picnic or a pot luck.

I followed the recipe exactly and tried it.  I thought that it could use some veggies, so I added some peas to it.  I love sesame oil and was really excited to try this recipe.  Unfortunately, I do not care for this recipe.  I think the flavors are a little too strong and that there was way too much sauce for the pasta.  The addition of veggies (I'd recommend lots of them) helps to soak up extra sauce and improve the overall look and taste of the dish.  My husband asked that I not make it again and one of my kids went without dinner rather than eat this.  I will not be making this again.

My household really did not like this recipe, and we really like oriental food.  The sweet/soy flavor didn't go well with the pasta.

I thought this was a good recipe and will probably make again. Next time I will follow the advice of others and add a few veggies, such as broccoli, carrots or bean sprouts. Might also add some garlic. But over all a good recipe. My three year old also enjoyed helping me cook it.

the pasta in it itself wasnt horrible. it was edible but to me the vinigar taste was too overpowering. I added water chestnuts and peas to mine which made it a little better but i think the dressing needed just a pinch of sugar. Something was definetly missing. I dont think i would make this again. its still sitting in my fridge

Yummy!  This salad is very different as my DH put it and the taste is amazing!  Thank you.  Oh, I added peas to mine. UPDATE:  I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving this year and WOW, everyone LOVED it!  This time I added chopped celery, shredded carrots and can of water chestnuts with more sauce.  I made it the night before and I think that helped soak the flavor.  VERY GOOD!  Got to try this one!

Very, very good, but even better with some add ins as others have mentioned. Needs something for crunch - celery, julienned carrots, watercrestnuts, etc. - and more variety in color - red pepper, green pepper, etc. I also halved the oil, and it was perfect.

This is wonderful and easy recipe. Has become a favorite. I saute the chicken in extra sesame oil and I add grated or chopped carrots to add color and flavor. It always get compliments when I make for others.

This recipe was very good.  But really needs some vegetables added to it  others suggested.  Mushrooms, peppers, carrots would have made this near perfect.  It was also a bit salty for my liking, so I might use less Soy Sauce next time.  Good flavor otherwise.

This was great!  I took the advice of many and used 1/2 of the amount of oil and chose Olive Oil.  I also didn't have sesame oil so I didn't use that.  I used sliced almonds and toasted those instead.  I also added shredded carrots, celery and orange pepper.  It turned out very tastey.  I let it marinate for about 4 hours.  The next day, it was just as good.  I froze the left overs and am not sure how that will turn out!  Any advice?

We LOVE this recipe. I use canned chicken breast meat to make this even easier. We usually have it as a main dish the first night then have the leftovers as a side the next night. This has instantly become a fave even with my 6 year old. Will be making this for years to come I'm sure.

i added sauteed mushrooms, mandarin oranges, julienned carrots and grape tomatoes for color, and sauteed mushrooms... i wouldve added sliced almonds, but i forgot to add them in... 5 stars for flavor and flexibility to add other complimenting ingredients... next time i will add mango... increased the dressing amount and added cayenne pepper for a kick...  let it sit in the fridge overnight... definitely making it again, especially for upcoming summer pool parties...

Really good, added carrots, was going to add waterchestnuts but forgot, used pre-cooked turkey, only complaint is that it was too oily for my liking and I used a little less then was called for to begin with.

This recipe is awesome!  Easy to make and really good.  Better within the first 24 hours - after that the pasta starts to take on a "tart" taste and the flavor changes.  Really, really good though!

Very nice combination with the dressing, cilantro, and green onions.

I would rate this 4 and a half... I added veggies that added a crunch like carrots, snow peas, sweet peas, peppers, and water chestnuts... and instead of just using regular cooked chicken, I grilled the chicken, which added a great contrast to the salad.  It was very good and versatile.  Will do this one again.

This is a great recipe!  To make it a meal, I actually halved the noodles and added about 2 1/2 cups of fresh spinach and only needed to add about half of the dressing.

I really like this and is great just as the recipe is. I will play with it a little and try olive oil or add peppers to it. I will be making this again.

Every time I make this recipe, someone always asks me for it. This recipe is great for potlucks or summer cookouts. I usually substitute vegetable oil with olive oil and reduce the amount to 1/3 cup rather than 1/2 cup since olive oil is a little thicker. I also add fried wonton skins to cover the top of the pasta when serving and it adds just the right amount of appeal to this dish. Yummy! Thank you Olivia for sharing the recipe.

This recipe is the reason I started using this site. It is GREAT. I make it without the green onion, and sometimes with chicken, sometimes without. It's even better the next day if you have time to let it sit in the fridge. Perfect for a b-b-q or potluck.

ALWAYS a hit when I make this. Even made it for a family who had just had a baby, added lots of chicken, served with fresh fruit and loaf of fresh bread and they said it was the best meal they had gotten!
Great recipe!!

I made this for a large gathering and decided it needed a little more "greens" so I added a little chopped broccoli and peas. I was looking forward to some leftovers but it got all eaten up. Everyone liked it, including my aunt who doesn't usually like cilantro. I'll probably make it again this week too.

This pasta salad is great.  I did not have rice vinegar, so I substituted it with a mixture of apple cider vinegar and tarragon white wine vinegar.  I also marinated the chicken in vinegar, lemon juice, and pepper before browning it in a pan.  This was such a refreshing meal with a ready made salad and pot stickers as an appetizer!

This was really excellent.  I added preshredded carrots and snow peas for some color and I also omitted the cilantro (can't stand the stuff!)  After chilling in the refrigerator, I saw that it needed more dressing so I whipped up another batch and added 1/2 to the pasta salad.  I got rave reviews for this salad and will definitely make it again.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

It was a hit with my coworkers!! I made a few changes. I used 1/4 cup of oil and I used 2 tsp of sesame oil instead. Also I added more ginger 1/2 tsp more and I only used 2 1/2 tablespoon of sugar. I will definitly make this again. My coworkers even asked for the recipe.

Very good summer salad.  I think a little less vegetable oil and a little more sesame oil would give it more flavor.  I allowed it to chill for several hours before eating it, and I didn't find it to be too oily.  The only changes I made were to use dried instead of fresh cilantro because I didn't have any, and because I didn't have any bow ties either, I used flat noodles.  It was easy to make and didn't take me long at all.

This is such a yummy recipe. Instead of using cooked chicken (I didn't have any handy), I substuted two cans of canned chicken. I shredded the chicken in the can before adding it to the salad. I think it turned out great, and my hubby is already asking me when I'll make it again.

I only had a 12 oz bag of pasta, and I read so may reviews about the salad being too oily, so I decided since there was less noodles I better make sure to cut down the oil.  However, the noodles soaked all the dressing up in no time, and before is served it I was scrambling to make more dressing.  I put more oil in that batch, and THEN my salad was swimming in oil.  Good flavor though....maybe next time I better just follow the original recipe :>)I grated up a carrot and threw it in for some color.

This recipe was VERY good.  I couldn't really taste the ginger, which I think would give it a nice tang.  Next time I'll add more.  Also, I think it could use a little less oil.  Still, it was quite tasty as it was.

This was delicious!  I made it for the church Easter picnic and it was a HIT!  I added ground walnuts (about 3 TB) to the dressing and let it sit in the fridge over night to add a creamier taste and added chopped bok choy and carrots to the salad.  To give it a punch, I would add a tsp of hot chili sauce (with those crazy hot seeds) to the dressing.  LOVE IT!

Between cooking and shredding the chicken, picking the cilantro off the stems, cooking and cooling the pasta, and peeling and grating the ginger this recipe takes a good two hours to make.  It was good, but not great tasting, and definitely not worth the time you put into it.

This was pretty good. I reduced the oil as suggested by previous reviewers and left out the chicken, cilantro, and green onion. I added lots of grated carrots and chopped cabbage. It was very good the first night, but not so good on the next days because the cabbage became wilted and soggy. Next time I'll keep the vegatables and pasta separate until just before I'm ready to eat it to maintain the "crunch".

This was very good!  We served it for a lunch time meal.  I bought six chicken thighs to boil and shred for the meat because thighs are cheaper.  I also reduced the vegetable oil to little more than 1/3 cup, added juilenned carrots for a little bit of color and used 1/2 tsp of dried cilantro instead of fresh.  This was an excellent meal.  I was thoroughly impressed by the flavor of the sesame dressing.  I highly recommend this dish!

Great recipe. I've made it twice so far. I used canned chuck chicken and added all the spices and sauces to that in a small skillet to warm and blend together. I also added chopped spinach leaves for color and baby carrots as a veggie and topped with chinese noodles for crunch. You can put in any vegetable you like to kick it up some. Took almost no time to prepare.

This recipe is quick, easy, and once you have the sauce ingredients on hand relatively inexpensive.  I can not take this salad to a party without having to email the recipe to several people the next day.

This recipe is awesome.  It has been in the 90's and I wanted a nice easy, light meal without a lot of cooking.  I grilled the chicken outside so all I had to cook was the pasta.  And the flavor is incredible.

This is fantastic, really tasty.  I left out the cilantro and the sesame seeds (didn't have any) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My family actually preferred this served warm but it also tasted good after it cooled.  Next time I am going to cut back the pasta a little and add lots of shreded carrot, cabbage and celery for some extra crunch.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe.

This was an awesome dish!  I made it for the moms in my playgroup and it was a hit.  My husband also liked it.  I did make an extra batch of dressing, and used some of it when I served the salad.  It dried out a little bit overnight.  Great recipe!

Very good! I wish I had doubled the dressing because it is so good! I, like others, used 1/3 cup olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I used a 12 oz box if mini lasagna noodles, this was plenty for us! This is a great dish to have in the fridge for the always hungry teens! I can't wait to serve it at potlucks next summer!

A big hit with my friends, family & co-workers.  I think what people liked most about this was that it wasn't your every day pasta salad that was weighed down with mayo or salad dressing ... very refreshing.

This was pretty expensive to make since I didn't have alot of the ingredients at hand but overall it was very good.  The leftovers were a touch dry though.

This salad is super good. The chicken is definitely optional. I also added a red pepper, two carrots, a head of broccoli, a zucchini, a cucumber and two cans of mandarin oranges. I halved the oil as suggested in the other reviews. I didn't even need to up the dressing with all the extra veggies. It was perfect.

I thought this was pretty good but my husband didn't really like it.  My kids wouldn't touch it but I expected that (they are 5 and 2).  I halved the recipe and added celery, otherwise followed it exactly.  If I make it again, I will leave out the cilantro.

This had nice flavors but we felt it lacked something.  Perhaps lightly sauted green and red peppers?  Something to give it a little color.

Most delicious pasta salad, universal, everyone should love it, except for vegetarians, but you could substitute tofu for the chicken! You can use whatever veggies are suitable. I think I used broccoli and asparagus as my main ones... Lovely, everyone LOVED it!

Very nice! The sauce makes the whole thing complete. An excellent light lunch.

Served hot? Maybe - but, after you "rinse under cold water until cool" it's not going to be very hot. After preparing, I stuck it in the fridge for a few hours.

Thank you for sharing this Olivia!  It is sooooo good! I barbequed frozen teriyaki chicken breasts and used fusilli pasta (vegetable).  Great combination and it tastes wonderful eaten right away!

This was a hit with all the women at work.  They were all fighting for the last serving.  I will definetely make this again.
