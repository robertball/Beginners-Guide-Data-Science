Turkey Pinwheel Haiku: "Swell shift from meatloaf. But tasted 'artificial.' Would need some changes." I prefer AR's "Spinach Turkey Roll" recipe to this one, both of similar ingredients and presentation, but something about this one didn't sit right w/ me. I'm not sure if it was the ketchup instead of spaghetti sauce on top, or the 'synthetically-seasoned' vibe of the Italian seasoning sprinkled on top at the end, but this pinwheel just didn't agree w/ my tastebuds. Only sub I had to make was fresh, torn baby spinach in place of frozen. The one thing that did make me waver on giving this a higher rating was marveling in astonishment as my 3-year old ate her entire plate. (Spinach - really?!? Dessert's on me!)

I'm sure this is a great recipe but they had it listed under low carb recipes and on a low carb diet you can not have any breadcrumbs or ketchup, both of which are ingredients in this recipe.  I will try it with tomato puree and find a substitute for the breadcrumbs.  You may want to lessen the salt it calls for, too, because cheeses are salty and people often forget that.  Other than all of this, it sounds like a really great recipe!

I thought it was great, but I didn't follow the exact recipe.

Some changes I made that I thought were fantastic:

I didn't add any salt at all, as per other suggestions. I did add garlic powder in its place, because I love garlic in everything.
for the center layer: I used feta crumbles rather than shredded italian cheese, (just something I love about spinach and feta together) and I added sauteed mushrooms, onions & garlic to the feta/spinach mixture.

for the topping: I didn't use the ketchup, rather just some tomato paste and for the last 25 minutes of baking, I topped the meatloaf with strips of turkey bacon, then broiled it for the last couple minutes so the bacon got crispy. I had the turkey bacon on hand that I needed to use up and thought it was a nice touch to the meatloaf.

Nice concept. Was moist and tasty. Noticed that someone suggested using low sodium breadcrumbs, I suggest making your own. I also used fresh herbs and fresh garlic and spinach, and added some chives to the mix. Did not add the ketchup.

My boyfriend and I made this recipe twice in a three week period because it was so delicious!  The turkey turns out really moist and flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly and had no complaints.

This was amazing. I used 99% fat free ground turkey, which can get dry if not properly made.  To ensure moistness I added 1/2 cup of skim milk to the recipe.  I also subbed shredded cheese for grated asiago cheese.  This keeps down the extra calories and fat. This was a hit.

This is a very good recipe, I've made it twice now and my hubby really likes it, the only thing I do different is use fresh baby spinach. The first time I made it I used frozen spinach but I just wasn't crazy about the taste. So the next time I used fresh and it was so much better.

I made this Sunday and put it in fridge to make later in the week. It was DELICIOUS! My 3 yr old and 2 yr old asked for seconds, spinach and all, which is saying something! We tweaked it a little, using fresh spinach and garlic cloves rather than powder. We will definately make this again, since there were no leftovers!

Easier than I expected and the whole family enjoyed it. Next time I'll use marinara instead of ketchup, and serve with pasta & sauce instead of mashed potatoes.

I would add more seasonings for bolder flavor next time. Also, the turkey mixture was so moist that after I rolled it, it started falling apart ... then fell through the roasting rack. I might try adding an extra egg next time to help it hold together. Oh, and I borrowed an idea from another AR recipe and used 3/4 cup cooked quinoa instead of bread crumbs. Yum!

We really enjoyed this; it was a nice switch from regular meatloaf. I used fresh spinach instead of canned  and added a small can of drained mushroom stems and pieces to the filling. My husband even wants me to make it again & he is not a big fan of ground turkey.

Awesome!  Instead of the ketchup, I made marinara sauce to spoon over the top of the meatloaf.  Family loved it!

Really enjoyed this turkey recipe!  I used fresh spinach and followed the rest of the recipe.  I had to put it back in for like another 30min till the middle was not pink anymore.  Use your meat thermometer!  Its a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing

Really like this recipe.  I didn't worry too much about following the directions to mix the meat, I just made the meat the way I normally do which is one egg, some season all, garlic power, black pepper, ketchup and breadcrumbs.  I didn't have Italian seasoning for the spinach mixture so i just used sprinkles of garlic powder, onion power, and oregano and it came out great. I make plain turkey meatloaf all of the time but from now on I'm making this instead, its so much better.   I also saute some onion and garlic and mix that into the spinach mixture. My lesson learned is to make sure the meat is not too wet or else it's tricky to role and also the rack digs into it. I also have to flatten it out longer/wider and thinner next time because I didn't get much role out of it

I modified this recipe to make it hopefully lower carb, and it was great.  I used less bread crumbs. I also put in some collard greens with the spinach (fresh, boiled and squeeze drained). Instead of the ketchup on top, I spread a little pesto and topped with Italian cheese.  Husband loved it.

We did not enjoy it at all. Perhaps it would have been tastier had we not used ground turkey and spinach that had both been frozen for a while and thawed for the dish..

This was a recipe the whole family enjoyed - even my 9 and 11 year olds who hate spinach love this!  Instead of using Italian seasoning, I used fresh chopped basil and oregano from my herb garden. And instead of ketchup, I reduced some pasta sauce until it was slightly thicker than ketchup.  My kids were disappointed when there were no leftovers to enjoy the next day! I will definitely make this again and again!

Turned out pretty good.  A little less salt added for me due to cheese and diet.
 My 3-year-old son said, "mmm good Papi".  He asked for more.

This recipe was a huge hit with my husband and he does not even like spinach!!  I did make a few changes as I did not have Italian seasoning so I added oregano, basil and thyme. I used Boirsin cheese with a bit of cheddar, and used  pasta sauce instead of ketchup.  This recipe is  a keeper and I will make it again.

I’m trying to eat less red meat and decided to try this recipe. I used an end piece of some whole wheat bread, finely chopped, for the soft bread crumbs. I added feta cheese and sliced kalamata olives to the spinach filling. I decided to skip the topping sauce altogether because I wanted the flavors to shine through. Both my husband and I really enjoyed the recipe. I’ll definitely make it again!

I have made this (slightly diff recipe) many times in the past.  I always used shredded mozzarella cheese, and homemade tomato sauce in place of ketchup.  It looks so nice when its cut and served.  This is a good make ahead meal because it reheats well, and slices better cold.  This recipe is a keeper.

Was very good - I think I would cook the spinach in the microwave a little bit the next time I make it since  it was a bit chewy.  Otherwise it had nice flavor.

This recipe is the best use of ground turkey I have tried. I followed the instructions and it was a great success. The only deviation was to use fresh chopped spinach and I threw in a little feta cheese with the others. I left out salt due to the salty cheeses and it was just right. My husband thought it was better than regular meat loaf.

What a great dish and so easy!! I also sautéed mushrooms and onions with the spinach and some garlic. I would also highly suggest spraying parchment paper before putting turkey down. And DO NOT use ketchup!! Use a good jarred sauce. Presentation is beautiful.  Highly recommended!!

We really liked this recipe, it's a tasty change from ordinary meatloaf.  Reheated leftover turkey pinwheel was even better than the first time out of the oven.  Because this was Italian flavored I used pizza sauce on top instead of the catsup.  Next time I make the recipe I think I will put some pizza sauce in the middle also before rolling it up, give it a little extra flavor.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I omitted the ketchup, added cooked peppers & onions with fresh spinach. I didn’t add any salt, and used about 1/2 c med cheddar. I cooked it for an hour and it turned out perfect.

I made this according to the recipe.  It was good, and I'll make it again, but with some changes.  I'll use panko crumbs, fresh spinach, feta in the middle, and marinara on top.  Seemed like the 10 oz of frozen spinach was too much.

I pretty much followed the directions, except I added sauteed minced garlic, diced portabella mushrooms and green onions to the spinach filling instead of garlic salt.  It got a 2 thumbs up from my husband who "hates spinach".

Not a hit and my family!           I really enjoyed it.        But the other four members of my family barely touched it for dinner!    I think they were turned off by all the spinach. Even though, i actually chopped up really small, but they still thought it was too much. I'm really bummed out because I really enjoyed myself. I will not be making us again unfortunately... this recipe gets four stars for me. But zero stars from my family. So that's why he gets to stars in my review

I made some changes to this recipe based on other reviews.  I substituted fresh garlic for the garlic powder and marinara sauce for the ketchup.  The instructions to create the pinwheel were easy to follow.  I always wanted to make a meatloaf this way but thought it was too complicated - it's not!  I didn't use all of the spinach mixture and there still was too much spinach filling.  I'd use less next time and add something else like chopped roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes or maybe mushrooms.  I'm glad I tried it and will tailor it more to our taste next time.  Thanks for a good basic recipe.

This came out beautifully. I did make some changes based on several reviews. If you use frozen spinach, season it before you mix it with the shredded cheese. I also sautéed and added some fresh sliced mushrooms (I made extra for the topping) which I seasoned with salt and pepper. Drain the mushrooms you use for the stuffing part. The biggest change I made was to spray the rack with oil, as I removed the pinwheel with a metal spatula from the rack after the 50 minutes, and placed it in a glass baking dish. Then I mixed the extra sautéed mushrooms with spaghetti sauce and coated the pinwheel with it and poured the extra in the dish. Then I coated the pinwheel with the shredded cheese and continued to bake as directed. It was delicious and my family liked the extra mushroom sauce.

I was really inspired by the idea of this recipe. I changed a couple of things personally that I thought did it justice. I diced up some yellow onion and fresh parsley for the Turkey mixture. Also I sauteed fresh spinach and garlic instead of using frozen. Lastly I topped with Tomato sauce, not ketchup

Made this tonight and hubby loved it.
I did sub the bread crumbs with ready Oates.  I always do.  Does the job and much healthier.  He had no clue.

I added chives, oregano, parsley, cracked pepper and fresh garlic to FRESH baby spinach and used Asiago cheese.  It's very low-fat and quite flavorful.

This one is a keeper.

Served with fresh broccoli and pilaf.

No ketchup.

I added finely minced onion and garlic  to the meat and instead of catsup, I used a small can of Italian flavored tomato sauce to give it a more Italian flavor.  It was delicious!

This was a little on the salty side, so I would cut that in half next time. I had a bunch of Swiss chard from my garden that I needed to use up so I did that in place of the spinach. The cheese I used was a  combination of Parmesan, mozz, and feta. I used stale rye bread for the bread crumbs and fresh garlic in place of the powder. Everything else was to the T and we loved it. My baking time was considerably shorter; about 35-40 mins total.

Easy peasy and it looks beautiful!  A fun play on meatloaf, tasted great with the spinach pinwheel, like a big turkey meatball.  Everyone gobbled it up and even my 10 year old ate the spinach. Only part of the recipe I changed is I used 1 pound of meat and cooked it for a total of 45 minutes. Perfect amount of salt and flavor.

It was s good, it's my 2nd time making it.  And yes I'll make it again.  Had mashed potatoes and sautéed broccoli and mushrooms with it, it was a great meal.

I thought this was a pretty flavorful recipe. I love spinach so I liked it better than my husband. My husband thought turkey was a little dry even though I followed the recipe.

This was delicious!  I substituted with fresh spinach, mined garlic instead of powder, and topped with Fire roasted diced tomatoes.  I did not add any salt.

it may or not be because of the mistakes i made with this recipe, but i would give it 10 stars if i could. 1st mistake, i wanted to use fresh spinach but picked up a bag of  a spinach, kale and chard mix. 2nd mistake, i put all of the herbs and seasoning in with the ground turkey. i did however, saute the spnach mix with a little butter and fresh garlic. this was soooo good. i didn't use ketchup, but my own pasta sauce on top of the pinwheel and served with homemade gnocchi. DELISH!!!

I used mozzarella and Parmesan for the cheese ingredient.  In place of Italian spice I used oregano and basil.  I also used 1 1/2 lb. of ground turkey.  Even our 12 year old picky granddaughter enjoyed it.

I think this was such a great recipe, it had my head spinning with ideas to make it my own!  I added additional spices into the meat as well as feta! I am thinking I may even try sun dried tomatoes in the meat next time as well!  I also sautéed the spinach with onions, garlic and even added a splash of lemon juice because I was wanting a grape leaf taste!  I was liberal with the feta and then once rolled I topped mine with marinara likes others had suggested.  My husband who is NOT a meatloaf fan really enjoyed this so that's saying something!!!!! Thank you for sharing,  I will definitely be making this again!

My husband said this was good. That is a compliment because he usually does not like ground turkey. I added about a half cup of low fat ricotta cheese to the spinach and left out the salt. I served it with chicken gravy instead of tomato. I will make this again.

Super easy and really good. Family likes the taste. Next time I make it, will add more to the center like asparagus and grated parmesan cheese as well.

I used broccoli (chopped small)  instead of spinach and omitted the ketchup.  Also,  gluten free bread crumbs.  This was fantastic. Not too salty at all.. In fact it could have used a touch more salt.  I can see a lot of possible variations on this recipe ill be making, such as taco seasoning with corn filling.  Really really good.

A hit! This was something my husband asked me to make again, which doesn't happen very often.  I sauteed garlic and onions to add to the filling.  Like others recommended, I use fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Glad I found this one!

Delicious with substitute(s).

Use fresh spinach, you don't have to cook it. Just remove stems and tear leaves apart into quarter sized pieces by hand, then use as directed.

Don't use ketchup, use pasta sauce or tomato paste. 

I used ricotta cheese on the inside because I had some to use up - it came out GREAT. 

I also used a whole TSP of black pepper by accident, it gave the whole thing a spicy kick that we enjoyed :)

I know many rate a recipe with each individual changes.  Since I use all recipes for many of our meals, I usually do not follow the recipe exactly.  I always add what I know my family will like.  My family loved this recipe!!!!  I did not add any salt, because if you use common sense, you know the rest of the ingredients definitely have sufficient amount of salt.  Like with all of my recipes, when I'm preparing meat, I always add garlic and onions.  I omitted the salt of course, and added a no salt seasoning.  To the spinach mixture, I used fresh spinach, which I already had in the refrig. , and chopped mushrooms.  To the ketchup, I added mustard, dijon mustard and a pinch of brown sugar and ginger.

Very yummy, but a little tricky to roll up.  We used a mixture of fresh and frozen spinach, and baked in a loaf pan.  Preferred the fresh spinach.

I didn't make as described because I wanted more in my pinwheel. I only had 6 oz turkey so I made one for 2 servings. I used only the egg white and after flattening the turkey out I decided to chop onions, garlic, green and red pepper and smush them into the flattened turkey. I used fresh spinach also and used cayene as well. This may sound odd but another turkey recipe I used had cocoa powder in it, so I spinkled a very minimal amount on the turkey. I do think this might call for spaghetti sauce instead but I felt it really could have even not used any sauce. This is only the 3 rd time I have used ground turkey because I hated it, well no more. Mine was so small it cooked in about 30 mins.

Was good. Probably good with hamburger as well. Looked like I worked hard. Nice presentation.
