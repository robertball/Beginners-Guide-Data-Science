Delicious candies! Home-made is always best, and nowhere is this more true than with candy. These remind me of the trademark Rolos chocolate caramels, only these, of course, are better. Having made this recipe several times over the last few months however, I wondered why I had such trouble melting the butter/chocolate mixture and keeping it workable while I finished dipping the caramels. The chocolate would stiffen far too quickly, and getting it back to a workable consistency was more difficult the second time round. I decided to read the reviews in an effort to discover what I might be doing wrong and though my particular problem wasn't mentioned, I did read of one reviewer who suggested eliminating the butter from the chocolate mixture. I hoped this would solve my problem and voila! I was not disappointed; the unadulterated chocolate mixture was now smooth and creamy and remained workable for a longer period of time. Butter or no however, I'd recommend having a little more than a pound of chocolate on hand. I've never managed to get by with only a pound. I use Callebaut milk chocolate chips for this recipe and others and am never disappointed. A good quality chocolate should be used because its flavour and texture are superior to that of cheaper varieties. To keep costs down, I purchase Callebaut milk chocolate in the bulk section of my grocery store. This recipe will always have a place in my recipe box. Thanks Cheryl!

I have never made caramels before, but this recipe was easy to follow and the results were fantastic.  Dipping each caramel in chocoloate seemed like too much work for me, so I poured half of the caramel in the pan, sprinkled a layer of semi-sweet chocolate chips and poured the rest of the caramel over it.  A fraction of the work with all the flavor!

Just a note for folks who say it came out grainy - be vigilant with wiping down the sides of the pan!  Using the canned milk makes crystalization less likely, but caramels are still prone... so get out your wet pastry brush or wet paper towels and WIPE ALL THE TIME to stop the crystals.

These are great!! And make wonderful gifts. Wrap in freezer paper & put in a nice jar, candy dish, or tin. 
Also be sure you get to the right temp or you will get candies that are hard if to hot, or really chewy if to cool. And for those getting a grainy chocolate you can take out the butter altogether or use a 1/2 of food grade coco-butter (or 30% of your chocolate ratio) this makes for a wonderful chocolate experience too. Also keep your chocolate over a double boiler on the lowest heat possible, this will keep it at a dipping level. Instead of the dipping method I like to pour a layer of chocolate in a wax papered lined Pan (or over my marble block) let it set completely then pour my carmel over this, let it set up. Cut into squares & slightly separate the squares, or put them on to a cooling rack with a cookie sheet under them, then slowly pour your remaining chocolate over each. You can then reheat the chocolate that drips off and repeat process. This will  get a uniform & perfect coating over each candy. They look like you bought them from a fancy chocolate shop, ;c)  it sounds hard but it is much easier to get a good coat with out all the mess, dipping, & fork marks. I have had a lot of holes and marks in my candies, lol.. I love that I figured this out. Thank u to the one who posted this recipe, it's great!!

Happily, these aren't as super-sweet as my husband expected them to be.  I poured the recipe into a 9 x 13" pan and cut them into 3/4" squares.  This gave me about 150 caramels.  I used the carmels for Lisa's "Caramel Filled Chocolate Cookies" (Cookie Cookbook).  I had a hard time getting them out of the pan after refrigerating, so I just worked with them at room temperature.  These would make an excellent Christmas gift for the caramel-lover on your list.  Thanks Cheryl!

by the way, if you decide not to coat them w/ chocolate, *lightly* dust them with a pastry brush with cornstarch to keep them from sticking..the gloss goes away, but they remain separated

Super easy and really yummy caramel.  I made it without the chocolate and added 1/2 tsp of salt to bring out the flavor.  Note that this caramel will stick to wax paper.  Wrap these in plastic wrap if you want individually wrapped pieces.

We made these chocolate covered caramels last year and they are simply to die for.  I'm a big fan of chewy caramel with rich flavors and dark smooth chocolate.  Together, this created a real treat.  My tip for getting them to stay their shape and look pretty, is cut them into squares and then refrigerate them so they're cool when you put the warm chocolate on them.  The best way I've found to put chocolate on them is to use a pastry brush and just pick up the caramel and paint the bottom, then the top.  It works wonderful and they look great.  I then put them on wax paper and put in the fridge right away.  I found some great chocolate boxes and accessories at Michael's craftstore and I'm going to gift these for Valentine's this year.  The caramel taste of this treat is very addicting...Enjoy.

I had never attempted making caramels before this so I was worried but surprisingly, this recipe could not have turned out any better! The caramels are rich and creamy and so flavorful. Next time I make them, though, I will keep half of the batch without chocolate because after a few days, the chocolate gets a little bit crusty/grainy. But if you eat them while they are fresh, they're fabulous. The caramels without chocolate, however, keep fresh for a long time. VERY good recipe...thank you!!

This isn't a review of this particular recipe but a tip on the chocolate.  I recently found an Alton Brown recipe that suggested keeping your melted chocolate on a heating pad (the household, back pain kind!) and it works great!  Just keep stirring the chocolate and it keeps it warm and pliable.  Happy candy making!

This recipe is very similar to one I lost somewhere in the shuffle, so I was very pleased to find it. I do candy gift baskets every Christmas. Anyway, I had a suggestion. For a change, and the coffee lover on your list, add 1 Tbsp instant coffee crystals & 1 ounce unsweeted chocolate with the butter. Mocha caramels made easy. Thanks for helping me revive my caramel recipe that I was afraid might be lost forever. I always forget how much butter to use.

Help!  I have tried the recipe twice but my caramels came out way to hard.  The 2nd time I used the lower end of the temperature range.  The flavor is wonderful though, but they are way too hard.  Did anyone else have this problem?

The taste is wonderful, but mine turned out so chewy, eating one piece could take you a couple of minutes.  Maybe I cooked them the wrong amount of time???  Don't use dark brown sugar, they end up almost as dark as chocolate!

These caramels were fantastic.  I have tried twice before to make caramels at home and failed miserably (with a different recipe).  This came out great the first time.  I did dip them in the milk chocolate (without the butter) and sprinkled them with sea salt.  They were so delicious.  I found that putting them top down into the melted chocolate, lifting them out and then flipping them onto the waxed paper after shaking off some of the chocolate was the easiest way to dip them.  I also mixed some silver and gold luster dust from the cake decorating store into the sea salt to give it a silver or gold look on top of the chocolate.  They turned out really beautiful and I will be giving them for gifts.  I look forward to also mixing powdered food coloring in with the luster dust and sea salt for other colors but I haven't done it yet.  Great recipe that I will use again and again.

UPDATE:  I used a 24 cavity silicone Christmas Tree mold (Wilton's I think) for my second batch.  It was so easy to pop them out of the buttered molds when they had set up.  I will be doing this exclusively from now on.  i plan to dip them in chocolate and put the salt arranged like garland.  Can't wait.

I found a can of condensed milk in the fridge, looked up some recipes, and stumbled upon this one.  I was always scared of making homemade caramels, but this was a complete success!  I halved the recipe, and couldn't be more happy that I did...as I ended up with tons and tons of caramels.  Next time, I will still use the 8x8 pan for half the recipe or a 9x13 for a whole batch, as i think they were too thick in a smaller pan.  I used veg oil instead of butter to melt my semi-sweet chocolate, and I ended up using a whole 2 c bag on half of the batch.  Be careful not to heat this too quickly, or it will be grainy.  I also make the mistake of trying to cut these too early, and made a huge mess. I ended up shaping the warm pieces into circles, dipped them, and drizzled with some more chocolate which turned out pretty cute.  My husband was speechless when he came home and tried one...and that says a lot!

These were a HUGE hit! Amazing. It took a while to get the chocolate dipping to work, the caramels kept slowly melting at room temp, but it was well worth it.

I love this recipe.  I didn't actually make Chocolate Covered Caramels though.  I used the caramel portion of the recipe, and dipped apples in it with the kids.  Was fabulous. Also I just used condensed milk that was not sweetened.  It worked out just fine (still plenty sweet), and Rodgers Golden Syrup, instead of Corn Syrup (they taste exactly the same, have the same texture, but I actually understand the ingredient list on the Golden Syrup.  haha).  It takes quite some time to cook it down, but it's worth it (took us about an hour).

(singing) Ahhhhhhhhhhhh! These really are buttery and soft caramels. This is my fourth attempt, but each time before I used a different recipe or I didn't have a candy thermometer. I made the recipe as it follow and I poured my hot caramel into a jelly roll pan that I greased with butter. Perfection!

These caramels turned out delicious but are a lot of work. My advice is to be very careful when making the caramel - use a big sauce pan. When I was stirring the caramel it jumped out of the pan on to my hand and I have a huge burn there. Be careful! I follwed the advice of using the pastry brush to get the tops and found it very helpful. I used a toothpick to dip the caramels into the chocolate and then put them on wax paper, brushed the tops with the chocolate -much easeier than trying to get the whole thing covered. I also broke my chocolate up into two "batches". I melted about 2/3 of the chocolate and once it started to dry out a bit (i didn't use butter in the mix) I added the other 1/3 of the chocolate and it melted and became user-friendly once again. I also added a bit of sea salt to the top of my caramels and it tastes SO good. The recipe is delicious - just be careful of jumping caramel!!

I LOVE this recipe!  This the is third year I have made them and I just finished cooking my 2nd batch for 2006.  They are worth the effort it takes.  I do not dip them in chocolate since they are delicious plain.  Several tips...
1) Definitely use a candy thermometer (they are cheap).
2) Put them in a larger size pan (a 9x13 jellyroll pan lined with buttered foil works great).
3) Before they are completely set, score them with a knife to make lines to follow for cutting with kitchen shears (it's not perfect, but it helps).
4) There are special candy wrappers out there that are meant for caramel and they stay twisted.
5) If the caramels are getting too hard to cut pretty easily, put the large piece in the microwave for 5-10 seconds.  This will soften it enough to make it easier to work with, but won't melt them.
Yummy!

These were soooo good!  I never made caramels, but these really were easy.  I can hardly believe I am saying this - but I actually liked the plain ones better than the choc covered.  I do wish I had taken one reviewer's advice and just spread the chocolate chips on top of the caramel layer.  
One question I have is how does using an 8" pan cut in 1" squares equal 120 pieces?? Where I went to school, that would be 64 pieces.  I used a large cake pan instead.  I think they would have been VERY thick in a 8" pan.

This recipe was incredibly frustrating - after reading every SINGLE review and hoping that my first time making caramels would be as wonderful as everyone else's experience, this was an epic disaster.  I followed the recipe exactly, brought the caramel mix up to 244 degees, and let it set in a well greased pan for hours...even in the fridge for several hours.  It was not too difficult to get the big square of caramel out of the pan, but once out, it immediately started melting so the "squares" did not stay.  I lumped it together and tried to make caramel balls, but these melted down too.  Trying to brush chocolate on the caramels (even while taking them in and out of the fridge) was messy and frustrating, and in the end, I am just frustrated with the attempt.  They were supposed to be a creative fun alternative to Valentine's chocolate for my husband and they just look like a failed attempt.  He says they taste good, but they look awful!

I tried this recipe for the first time a few years ago.  I had never made candy and this really built my confidence.  Although I make many different candies now, I find it is the most requested of my goodies.  It's all about temperature.   I heat it up slowly (patience is the key) until a firm ball is formed when dropped in cold water.  Sometimes I use a thermometer, but I still find the cold water test to be more reliable.   I use a 9x13 and skip the butter.  I also find that chilling it in the fridge before dipping it and again, immediately after makes it easier to work with.  Then I drizzle with white chocolate just to add some contrast.

These tasted fantastic! I followed the advice of other reviewers and left out the butter from the chocolate mixture. I just used semi-sweet chocolate chips and it worked out well. I did face the problem of my caramels melting once I dipped them in chocolate - they looked more like caramel patties. It seemed to help if I got them back into the fridge very soon after dipping them in the chocolate.

This was excellent but I think my candy thermometer is off because I cooked it too long.  I have an electric stove and cooked it at 4.5 heat and 20 minutes would have been long enough to have a soft carmel.  Mine turned out too firm like a slo poke lollipop but still good.  I nuked each piece in the microwave and it tasted great.  I also put the chips in the middle as suggested to save time.  I will probably skip that next time made a horrible mess.

A lot of boring stirring, but ended up tasting delicious! I cooked this to the right temperature, but mine came out fairly hard - maybe a problem with my thermometer?

I've been searching for a recipe like this for a year!  It was a time consuming and patience-testing recipe, but so worth it!    I did use margarine instead of butter and it probably took a half hour of constant stirring to get to the correct temp.  I did not have a heavy bottom pot and my stove top cooks hot so I had to be very careful    I poured the caramel into two well greased (with butter) 8x8 pans and threw in the fridge to set  Pulled them out and warmed to room temp, then ran the bottom of the pan under hot warm and pulled the caramel out with my fingers - not hard as long as the pan is well buttered!  I cut the caramel into 2cmX2cm squares and placed them all on wax paper on the countertop    I tried using a good quality chocolate but just could not get the correct consistency so I used dipping wafers which were perfect! They melt much nicer (higher wax content) plus the chocolate has a nice sheen when its dry  I used a silicon pastry brush to paint the bottom of each caramel, and then painted the top and sides  Sprinkled each with a bit of sea salt and they are delicious!

I followed the recipes but lined the pan with PAM sprayed parchment paper that overhung the edges. When the caramel cooled, I pulled the whole thing out and cut it into squares with a butcher knife. Also, instead of coating the caramels with chocolate, I drizzled melted chocolate over the squares and then sprinkled some coarse sea salt over the chocolate before it hardened - super yummy!

I browsed thru the reviews for this recipe because I am interested in making them to bring to a party.  It looks as tho some folks had trouble working with the caramel.  Is it possible that pouring the candy into ice cube trays to harden would make them easier to remove?

Everyone loved these. I made the caramel and poured it into a pan adn then poured chocolate over it after it had set and before I put it in the refrigerator. It cut so smoothly and everyone absolutely loved them. I had about 150 but they were gone before everyone had otten to try them. Absolutely wonderful and everyone is asking for the recipe.

Have used this recipe for years, but have taken the last few off and not made them. This year they have been demanded, not just requested! lol. This year I introduced my 9 1/2 yr old daughter to the "family recipe" and she is so proud! She only stirred in the beginning, once it got to bubbling I took over. This year I will dip some, leave some naked and others will get a fancy coating with drizzles of the opposite type of chocolate on them (white on chocolate and vice versa) I will also make some with sea salt as I'm addicted to the salted caramels! Thanks to the original poster for my all time favorite treat to make for friends and family! A few years ago I also laid out a flat layer of salted pretzels and poured the caramel over it, heavenly!

Tried 3 times to make these caramels and so far, not a single edible caramel.  I've gotten lots of practice cleaning up sticky messes.  They always turn out with dark splotches and look terribly unappetizing.  Probably cheaper for me to buy them at the store already made.  Wouldn't let me give 1 star.

I would give these caramels 4 1/2 stars. The taste was wonderful..but I wasn't crazy about the texture. I followed directions exactly, but I found my caramels came out a little too soft. Had a hard time cutting them and had to keep them in fridge until ready to serve. I will give this recipe another chance though, because everyone said they were delicious.

this were so disappointing. After following the directions exactly, they were impossible to cut. I did not give these to anyone for fear they would pull out their fillings.

Will definately make again but trying to figure out a better way to get the chocolate on the caramel.

These were fairly easy to make, for those of you who havent made candies, it might be easier to go to the store and get a couple dollar candy thermometer.  I would suggest while dipping the carmels that you keep that which is not being dipped right away in the fride.  I cut the carmels in strips and refriderated the rest, and they turned out great definately easy, just a bit time consuming.  Thanks for the great recipe

Wow!!! I almost didn't even get to dip these carmels because my husband just wanted to eat the carmels! I had to keep swating his hand away.  This would be great carmel for making carmeled apples to I think. I am definatly going to try it! I will be making these again and again! Thanks so much for sharing!

I used only the caramel part of this recipe, and WOW! This was my second attempt at making caramel (previous disaster was with different recipe and directions).  I deviated from the directions here in a couple of areas.  I used room temperature unsalted butter, and I mixed everything except the vanilla in the pot and stirred the butter with the remaining ingredients over medium heat until it was smooth.  At that point I stopped stirring and popped in the candy thermometer.  I did not stir the mixture again until my thermometer read 242 and it was time for the vanilla.  I then poured it out (without scraping the pot) into a greased 9 x 9 baking dish.  The caramel took a while to set up, but when it was finally set, it was possibly the best caramel I have ever eaten!  I used it to make Dark Chocolate Salted Sea Turtles and they were a huge hit with my girlfriends (everyone asked to take a few home)!  This recipe will probably be my standard for caramel making from now on for the taste and the easiness of the recipe!  Many, many thanks to the poster of this recipe!!!

Not a very easy recipe. I used golden syrup bc I din't have corn syrup, and accidentaly I used 240 grams of butter, which was way too much; it wasn't mixed properly and I had to pour off the fat.  Next time I will use 180 grams of butter.  I like using my French recipe which uses cream instead of condensed milk. It makes the caramels much creamier. But this is a good replacement when I don't have any cream. In the beginning I did have ugly dark spots, as if the caramel was burnt, but later on it dissapeared. I always boil the mixture to 260 F, which makes the caramels quite hard. (which I like)  This time I boiled to 150 F, which was really perfect, nice soft, chewy caramels! BUT they did stick, so I dusted them with cinnamon and honestly that was really good too! At the bottom of my baking tray, I put chopped walnuts, and poured the mixture over it. When the mixture was hard, I turned it and now I have beautiful dark caramel with light brown spots. Please don't cover them with chocolate! (honestly, I really like chocolate)

I found this recipe to be very messy and hard to work with. The caramels stuck together and dipping in the chocolate was a disaster. The taste is good but the end result was not very pretty to look at.

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! This recipe is sooo easy! I just made my 1st batch tonight and I was really impressed how stress-free it was to make these. I don't plan on dipping them in chocolate 'cause i think that it might be a bit over the top, but I will keep this recipe for it is a real treasure, especially how a good caramel recipe is hard to find.

This recipe tasted great, but the "drop some in cold water to form a ball" thing didn't work for me, resulting in my not cooking the caramel enough.  Therefore, it never hardened and is sitting in a liquidy lump on my counter.  It's really yummy to just get a spoonful of it, though, and lick it while you're reading a book or something.  Overall, it was good, but for us broke people who don't own candy thermometers, maybe there's a better way to put it?!

These were really, really good!  The only recommendation I have is to put a *tiny* bit of salt in the caramel mixture while cooking.  I think they could benefit from the salt to balance the sweet (a little bit).

The caramels were delicious and I added about 1/2 tsp. of salt to give it a little more deliciousness.  I did not cover them in chocolate, but may try it another time. The worst part was cutting them.  They are very, very sticky and I had to use 2 knives to get them cut properly so I could wrap them.

As a novice I liked the simplicity of the recipe (we didn't dip them because we were afraid the chocolate would get gritty before we could eat them all but we did sprinkle sea salt on before set and they turned out perfectly. To others not experienced: spray your pan then line with parchment paper.

I followed the recipe exactly, using a candy thermometer. Horribly disappointing. The caramels are hard enough to break teeth. I could barely cut them when cooled, and now that they are chilled, they have returned to a single, massive block. I have no idea if they are salvageable. I'm not sure I wish to try, for fear of the dental bills. Searching for a different recipe...

Also, 1 inch squares in an 8 X 8 pan are going to give you 64 servings and never 120.

Allowing the crystals to fall back into the cooked mixture will cause a "super saturation" of the sugar/water mix, and THAT is what causes crystallization and a "grainy" product!  Got hard fudge?  STOP scraping your pan! :)

I make a pecan pie with caramels and I’d run out. We were hit with ‘artic cold front’ and driving to a store was not an option for a couple of days. Researching caramel recipes – this looked easiest – and oh my – is this recipe - OH SO GOOD – I was only able to get the temperature up to 110 and it was bubbling all over a little dramatically - and then I totally forgot the vanilla until after filled a 13x9 pan. Even forgetting the vanilla this is an amazing recipe. I think it will be a rare time I buy caramels again. I make pecan pie for my 85 year old dad retired in Florida, pack it up and mail it to him. I’ll be sending some caramels too!

These are, quite literally, the best chocolate caramels I have ever had. I added a bit of salt to the caramel and it has the perfect amount of sweetness to it. I made them for Christmas presents and had to hide them in the downstairs deep freeze so they wouldn't disappear before the 25th.

I've always been afraid of making caramels but these were so easy, and so delicious!  I added about 1/2 - 3/4 tsp of salt at the end with the vanilla since I like salted caramels better, but other than that I followed the recipe to a "T" with great results!

Very good caramel!  Only it was too soft to keep in squares.  After I cooled it, I rolled it in balls, then refridgerated the balls.  They flatttened, so once cooled, I rolled them again and quickly dipped in the chocolate and quickly got them back in to the fridge.  Everyone loved them!

I have made these twice now and they turned out great both times. I don't have a candy thermometer so I used a meat thermometer, along with the "cold water" method mentioned, and they turned out just fine. I couldnt figure out how to dip them in chocolate, so I drizzle chocolate over them instead. They are very yummy :)

I made peanut caramel cluster drops, drizzled with melted chocolate instead.   I heated it to 244 and refrigerated them but they would not stay firm.  Cooling longer, still became pliable, for a soft chew and still.  I was expecting a creamy, firmer, chewier carmel.  I'd still like to make creamier caramels-there was a sugary grit to these. All and all, this was a pleasent surprize.  Family members were digging into them (me too) so-there you have it!  
Thank you for the recipe.

SO good!  And amazingly easy.  These came out the perfect texture.  I used almond bark coating that I added semi sweet chips to - it keeps them from being too sweet and doesn't turn gray.  My husband demolished the whole batch within days.

Incredible and easy. HOWEVER... the 9 x 13 pan is a bit too thick for this recipe. I waited for the caramel to cool and then made it into small balls. Froze them on parchment paper, then covered them in the chocolate and did a white chocolate drizzle over them too.  SUPER YUMMY!

This is my third year using this recipe to make Christmas caramels, and they are always a hit! I typically skip the chocolate coating and just make the caramels by cutting them into squares and wrapping them in a little bit of wax paper. I love the old fashioned look of them and my friends have come to expect them each year! 

I have found that for this, my favorite temperature is about 246-247. It means the caramels still hold their shape, but they are still melt-in-your-mouth soft. Also—remember that parchment paper and wax paper are not interchangeable. If you use wax paper to line your pan, your hot caramel will melt the wax and will be ruined by the paper. Lastly, remember to stir your pot continually and scrape along the sides and bottom diligently during cooking. When you pour your caramel out into the pan, the caramel along with sides of your pan will likely be hotter and will produce a stiffer caramel, so use that at your own risk. You may choose to pour out the caramel, but not scrape every last bit from the sides. Instead just munch on that later ??

Other things I have done with these caramels: I’ve made turtles by drizzling the caramel (softer caramel at about 242) over a cluster of roasted pecans and then topping with a dollop of melted chocolate. I’ve also made shortbread cookies and put them in mini muffin tins, filled them with a bit of soft caramel (again, around 242), and covered the top with chocolate and a sprinkle of sea salt. 

All three of these treats

First time making caramels and I am so glad I tried this recipe first.  Would have liked a better way to cool them down though. I had to reheat the whole batch to get it unstuck from the waxpaper. (did not have parchment) I didn’t need the butter in the chocolate as I used  really good quality chocolate. 

Other than that I am so pleased with this recipe. Thank you for sharing it.

I cut the caramels into Diamond shapes and after dipping them squiggled them with white chocolate.  I also added a small portion of paraffin wax to the chocolate which gave the chocolate a very shiny store-bought look.   made these years ago but lost the recipe so I'm thrilled I have found it again.

I make them to bring to every holiday get-together, and everyone looks forward to them.  They are so good!! I have made them with and without the chocolate.  My favorite is just the caramel.  When people taste them for the first time, they often tell me it takes them back to their childhood...that's a very good complement!

Keep your chocolate over a double boiler on the lowest heat possible, this will keep it at a dipping level. Instead of the dipping method I like to pour a layer of chocolate in a wax papered lined Pan. let it set completely then pour my caramel over this, let it set up. Cut into squares & slightly separate the squares, or put them on to a cooling rack with a cookie sheet under them, then slowly pour your remaining chocolate over each. You can then reheat the chocolate that drips off and repeat process

I've really struggled with making homemade candy over the years. This recipe worked out really well. I think a recipe with cream might taste a tiny bit better. But this one is better for me, a person prone to candy making disaster. I'm thrilled to have a batch of homemade caramels. I calibrated my thermometer this time. Also, I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and lightly washed down the sides of the pan. I also cooked it to 240. Next time I might pull it a tiny bit sooner. But it's good as is. I sprinkled sea salt on the top after it cooled for 30 minutes. I didn't dip them in chocolate. My family loved theses! Thanks for the great recipe.

Five star taste!  I had difficulty because I didn't use a candy thermometer but the outcome was wonderful!  They turned out soft and I was unable to dip all of them, although I tried.  They held up well in the refrigerator.  I sprinkled them with sea salt.  YUM!  Thank you Cheryl  for sharing your recipe!

This is my go to caramel recipe. I put it in a 9x13 pan lined with aluminum foil- then after it has set up i pop it out on a cutting board and it is easy-peasy to cut it into pieces. I don't dip it, I wrap individual pieces in wax paper and haven't had a problem with them sticking as long as it gets to a good consistency. If you have trouble with the temperature- when it gets up to about 225 start doing ice water tests every few minutes until you like the texture. I make a batch for family reunions and my family loves them.

Should've never made it. Now I'm making several batches every Christmas. Everyone says it tastes like Milky Way caramel.  I used dark brown sugar.

I was looking for a caramel recipe for my turtles this year, as you can no longer cook a can of condensed milk ( all the cans I have found have the pop top, so can no longer do the cook for 4 hours flipping the can over every hour,..) and this recipe is the bomb! I loved it, was so easy, and tastes delish! Thank you for sharing!! I'm cooking my second batch today just to make the chocolate dipped caramels :)

I put a piece of parchment paper in the 8x8 pan so that once it cooled I could just lift it right out of the pan, I just made sure to spray the parchment, and any part of the pan the caramel touches, with pam. These were really easy to make, but I really didn't care for the flavor... they just don't have the caramel taste I like I guess. Everyone who tried them, raved about them though (I must be my own worst critic). I heated the caramel to 240 degrees and let the mixture cool in the pan for about 5 hours. Once I cut them into strips they started to spread out a bit, so putting them in the fridge before, during, and after cutting is a good idea. Next time, I'll probably use a flat baking sheet. I also took the cut caramels out of the fridge two dozen at a time for dipping (if left out too long they won't hold their shape), then put them back in the fridge after dipped. *Tip: I used a fork to dip them and, sometimes a toothpick to push them off the fork.

Definitely not for those who don't like a mess, but these are amazing.  I will never buy store bought caramel again.  My husband said this was the best caramel he ever tasted.  Dipping can be difficult.  I used another reviewer's suggestion and used a pastry brush.

Thanks for the recipe!

DELICIOUS! I made these last year and they were a hit with EVERYONE! This is my secret weapon recipe for X-mas! Always use a candy thermometer!!! I usually do one batch covered in chocolate, and another batch just caramel. Tastes great both ways!

What an endeavor this was!  We cooled the caramel out in the garage until set and ready to coat with chocolate.  I cut into small squares and tried to remove from pan in square form, but no luck.  The caramel is a nice soft, yummy caramel and did not hold its shape.  During the dipping process they lost their shape even more.  Ended up lining counters with GREASED wax paper, making caramel mounds and spooning chocolate over them, one set we flipped them over and covered them from the other side.  Had we had whole pecans they would have made beautiful turtles!  We doubled the batch and tired of this after about one whole batch--cut wax paper squares, greased my hands and rolled plain caramels.  These were wonderful!  Just like the large Vande Walles caramels that you can get a couple for a buck:)  Stored these in the garage and fridge to keep cool, at room temperature they stick to the wrappers.  After all was said and done I said we were never going to attempt these again because I wasn't aware of what we were taking on.  But rave reviews have me thinking that next Christmas maybe we'll just make one batch and wrap all of them in waxed paper.

Very good!!  I didn't cook it long enough so it didn't firm up all the way.(Next time I won't leave my thermometer at home!!)  So I popped it into the freezer, pulled it out and shaped into balls and put toothpicks in them then popped them back in the freezer.  Then I took them out and dipped them in the chocolate....the chocolate kept them from falling apart..I also added some wax to the chocolate to help with the dipping and hardening....thanks for this easy and yummy recipe!!
