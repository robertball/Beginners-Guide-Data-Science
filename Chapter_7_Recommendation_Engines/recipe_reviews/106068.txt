Honey garlic sauce is a cooking sauce that can be bought prepared by many co. ie:  VH sauces in the Chinese food section or condiment section.  lots of recipes here for home made versions.  i use VH brand for my BBQ's ribs all the time. This lively sauce has the sweetness of honey and the richness of garlic. It is ideal for grilling, basting, simmering or dipping meatballs, beef, pork or chicken.  hope this helps :)

I got this recipe years ago from a friend's mother. She called it "1 pot dinner". I brown the ground beef with the baccon and drain the fat. I combine all the ingredients in a crock pot on low, and cook for 6 ours. I always volunteer to bring the baked beans, and go home with an empty pot. I give this 5 stars

I've made a similar recipe like this for yrs. (30 yrs) and it's called Calico Beans, has pork n beans, butter beans and kidney beans, hamburger & bacon, chopped onions with sauce of ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar and mustard.  Always a big hit at pot luck, and a complete meal if you want.

i have my own recipe for baked bean but when i use a slow cooker i use a spatter guard instead of a lid, this way the juices evaporate and you have thick and delicious beans without all the juices.

I will definately make again.  I put everything in the crockpot in the late morning and set on low.  Turned it down to warm about an hour before dinner.  I like my ingredients to spend some time together.  Everyone liked them.  This would work well for summertime BBQ's!

This is a good dish for summer BBQs...We served it with grilled hamburgers and hot dogs and there wasn't a bit left over. Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, I also wasn't sure what honey garlic sauce was but saw while shopping that Kraft has a Honey Garlic BBQ sauce, so I bought that to use. I'm not sure if the Kraft BBQ sauce is the same type of honey garlic sauce that recipe called for but the beans were still absolutely perfect.

Excellent. I did it on the stove (crockpot was dirty!). Cooked for about an hour, letting the flavours steep. I used a chipotle baked beans, and a maple baked beans. The hint of spice with the sweet, so excellent!

My mother made these for years but she had a few different ingredients.  She didn't use any meat but that sounds good.  She chopped 2 large onions (sauteed in bacon grease), 8-12 slices of bacon (cooked and chopped), 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1 tsp. mustard, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, 1/2 C. cider vinegar, 2 15-oz. butter beans (drained), 1 1-lb, can green lima beans (drained), 1 1-kb red kidney beans (drained, 2 1-lb cans baked beans (good quality)...DO NOT DRAIN, 1 C. catsup and 1 T. liquid smoke.  She baked them for 1 hour but I bake mine in a crock pot on low for 4-5 hours (or longer),  They are FANTASTIC.  Wonderful memories from my childhood!

Very easy to make!!  I doubled it and it filled a 6qt crock pot.  I left it cooking for 4 hours to continue to meld the flavors but it is great at one hour!! I could not find honey garlic sauce so I just added honey.  With the honey, brown sugar and ketchup it has more sugar than I prefer but this is a summertime treat! I brought a huge bowl of this to a family reunion and it was the only empty bowl at the end of the evening!!   Luckily I had stashed a small container in my fridge for an after party treat!!!

Definetly can only be used as a side dish because of it's sweetness.  It was only OK.

I made these and my guests LOVED them!  Couldn't get enough and they were even better left-over... I will be making this recipe again soon.  I also didn't have to make any adjustments to the ingredients- a pleasant surprise.  :). This stands alone, without any need to manipulate it.

Love, love LOVED it!  It was so warm and rib-sticking good on what was a cool, damp evening here in Michigan. Had it as our main course in fact - no other food necessary.  My supermarket didn't have navy beans canned so I used northern beans instead (always works well in Michigan) and didn't find any honey-garlic sauce so I did something totally radical, dangerous and ingenious; 2 tbsp honey, 1 tsp minced garlic and a nice pinch of cayenne pepper.  I figured that couldn't screw it up too bad and it certainly didn't.  My only critique is that I might actually put a cup O' high quality H2O in it next time just to thin it slightly. My personal preference is all. It was SO thick - but many would love it that way too.  All in all....BAM!

First made according to recipe...it was a hit.  Then I tried making it with browned sausage instead of the hamburger and added Kentucky bourbon.  Both recipes are great.

Carolyn, I have made this recipe several times and it is oh so delicious.  My family loves it and folks are always asking for the recipe when I take it to cookouts or potlucks!
I have NOT been able to find Honey Garlic Sauce, not even at Whole Foods in Columbus, Ohio.  I use 2 tablespoons of Chili Sauce instead, otherwise I follow the recipe exactly.  I know the two sauces are not related but it really works.  !!

This good hearty all-in-one dish is a nice cross between barbeque and chili. I cooked on high for one hour, per recipe, and then left on low until dinner, several hours later. Good with cornbread.

I DOUBLED  the recipe and made the following changes.

Instead of worcestire and white vinegar I added 3 tsp of Balsamic vinegar.

Instead of honey garlic sauce I added 1/4 cup of honey and 2 tsp more of garlic salt.

I also added 1/4 cup of sweet baby rays BBQ sauce.

Came out great.  Took it to a party and everyone loved it!

I've used this same basic recipe for more than 10 years, but have never put bacon in it.  I may try that the next time.  The recipe given to me was called Calico Beans, because of the variety of beans in it.  I also use green beans in it, roma beans, a can of lentils, and black beans.  This is a staple for large family gatherings.

Love them!!! 
Robyn & others so confused about VH Honey Garlic sauce, it's as SIMPLE as it sounds. It's an Asian food aisle grocery item, NOT BBQ SAUCE, and the BRAND name is "VH" that's not an abbreviation that the other user was using.  Simply "VH Honey Garlic"...  ;-)

I made it for my Book Club along with side dishes of coleslaw, Greek salad, brown bread, buns, spiral ham ,homemade pickles and rhubarb pie with ice cream for desert. It was easy to make...I made it the night before . The ladies went back for seconds and thirds ! They loved it ! Instead of just using two cans of beans I used four. Two cans  of Chipotle and two of Maple baked beans and followed the rest of the recipe as it was given. Very easy and improved in flavor as leftovers the next day .

Added circa a tablespoon of liquid smoke.  Also changed to full cup packed brown sugar.  Did not have garlic salt on hand so used garlic powder.   The liquid smoke is salty anyway.   Substituted baked chili beans (canned) for a can of Bush beans as store didnt have Bush baked  beans.  Used at least half a pound of bacon.   The honey garlic sauce hard to find but was in Randalls Asian food section - very small and easy to miss. 

I actually cooked it in a very good Dutch oven with no lid.  Too tired to dig out the crock pot.  

Very tasty.  Freezing a great deal of it.  Tastes best warmed up.

I have not made this recipe but use a similar one for baked beans.  I use only Bush's Baked Beans with brown sugar and bacon, adding additional brown sugar and ballpark mustard.  Rather than the sweet sour sauce etc, I use A-1 and Heinz 57 for moisture. I drain the beans so they need some liquid.  Rather than hamburger I use bulk  sausage, either hot or maple flavored depending on my mood.  The sausage gives it extra zip as does the ballpark mustard.  Bacon on top while it bakes gets crisp and adds a dimension of texture.

Been making these for years, but we call them Cowboy Beans and I use pinto vs kidney beans. Hate kidney beans!

This is the absolute best recipe for baked beans I have ever had and is now the only one I make.  I didn't change a thing.  I make the honey garlic sauce and sweet and sour sauce and freeze them in ice cube trays in 2 Tbl increments and pop them out when I need them.  Its a real time saver!  It's always requested when I go somewhere so if I know of several outings coming up I'll brown up the hamburger and cook the bacon, mix together and freeze.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  Modified the ingredients a little first time around.  Used sweet chile sauce in place of honey garlic sauce and added more beef (~ 2 lbs).  Turned out great!  Second batch was same as above but I added the following: about a 1/2 cup of diced onions, 3 tablespoons of diced jalapenos, 2 tablespoons of honey, half a can of super sweet corn and half of a diced red pepper.  Way better than the first batch!

I love this recipe and it is my go to for baked beans. I do not use the honey garlic sauce, just add some honey and garlic to the beans, and I also add about 1/2tsp chili pepper flakes to give it some heat.

Everyone LOVED this recipe.! I use turkey bacon as the meat to be a side dish for Ribs and it was just right. Of course pork bacon would be better. I added the ground beef later in the week for wonderful main dish with salad.

I made this for the first time and took it to a 4th of July party. I had several people ask me for the recipe and I just referred them to All Recipes website with the name of the dish. I think people thought that it was an old recipe I had made several times but I've just started cooking since I retired. Thanks All Recipes!

I added 1 extra can of baked beans and a little more brown sugar. I couldn't find sweet and sour sauce in my local store so I substituted Hawaiian marinade. The beans were a real crowd pleaser at a party for 20 tonight. I will definitely fix it again.

Too sweet for main course
This would probably be okay in a smallish portion next to an ear of corn, a burger, potato salad and other staples of picnics and family reunions.  I mistakenly thought it would work as a main dish but for me it's much too sweet for a big portion.  On the other hand, what with the ground beef and bacon, it's rather heavy as a side.  I ended up putting the cooked results into a strainer and rinsing off most of the sweet sauce.  The less sweet version probably wouldn't be as popular at a picnic but I found it more edible in big portion.

I followed the recipe exactly (except for a little extra brown sugar) and it was delicious! I hadn't heard of Honey Garlic Sauce before, but I found a recipe on your site and made that to add to this recipe. My husband won't settle for any other barbecue beans now that he's tasted these!

Tried this for a July 4th party. Overall, I stuck with the original recipe. Only changes made was I substituted hot sauce for the sweet and sour sauce - and - I cooked in on low (using a crockpot) for 5 hrs. The flavor was sweet enough for us.
This was a hit - everyone commented on how they liked the beans. I would definitely cook this again.

In this recipe I used ground venison instead of beef, honey instead of honey garlic sauce because I couldn't find it, pinto beans instead of navy beans because I couldn't find them and regular mustard instead of ground mustard because what I had was really old.  I really liked this recipe and so did everyone else who tried it.  I was asked for the recipe so that is a good sign.
