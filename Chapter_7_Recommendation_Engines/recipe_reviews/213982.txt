I made these using chunky peanut butter, and I spread melted semi-sweet chocolate mixed with a little corn syrup on top. I usually don't like Rice Krispie treats, but with the addition of the peanut butter and chocolate, they were delicious! Quick, easy snack.

Even better using cocoa krispies or cocoa pebbles cereal. Update: 3/5/11...want a more adult treat? Add 1 to 2 tablespoons Kalua or coffee liquor into marshmallow mix. Yum-O

These are delicious. I've been making these for years and the peanut butter makes them all that much better. Great simple yummy treat. Kids love them. Make sure to use FRESH marshmallows or they don't turn out as well. You can even use a small jar of marshmallow fluff instead of the marshmallows. Try dipping 1/2 in chocolate for an even yummier treat!

These are a family favorite - my mom always made them this way and so do I.  :)  Only thing I change is to use 5 1/2 cups rice krispies instead of 6 or we find them too firm.

This was great for me because I was able to make this with my four year old AND my husband and kids love peanut butter. I took JEBB's advice and made a quick chocolate peanut butter topping out of 1/2 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, a tablespoon of butter and a quarter cup of peanut butter. I melted the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl with the butter and peanut butter in 40 second intervals, stirring before I put it back in the microwave until it was the consistancy I wanted. Then, I spread it over the krispie treats. It was just enough for a very thin layer and used up the half bag of chips I had on hand. Sometimes, I find that using cheap or store brand peanut butter can be an issue when making sweet treats but this wasn't the case. I was able to use both store brand "crisp rice" cereal, store brand marshmallows and store brand peanut butter without issue. Oh, sure--it was a little drier than your usual Krispie treat but the boys didn't notice. Next time, I'll use name brand peanut butter and see if that makes a difference. I noticed I did have to work fast once I stirred the peanut butter in. The marshmallow/peanut butter mixture thickened really fast but again, that could have been because I used store brand ingredients. NOTE: Keep in mind that this is a little tricky to clean (or, it was for me) off of your mixing spoon/spatula and pot. Spraying the spoon, pot, mixing bowl, pan and hands liberally with non-stick spray helps a great deal.

These turned out great. I added 2 handfuls of chocolate chips as suggested in previous reviews and it turned out amazing. My husband and kids finished off the entire pan. They weren't to hard or to soft. They were perfect. Fast and easy, Great recipe!!!!!

These are a definitely winner in my family.  I've been making these for a long time.  I prefer creamy  peanut butter in these, but chunky or creamy works fine, it's a personal preference.

I had a huge bag of marshmallows so I weighed them.  But to me it seemed like not enough marshmallows.  I went ahead with the recipe.  Next time I will add at least a cup more....  I melted chocolate chips on the top was pretty good!!!  Thanks for the recipe, my mom used to make these for us when we were kids...being a kid at heart I still love them at almost 40!

So much better than a regular rice krispy treat! Following the recipes 'as is' was 5 star worthy, but to make it even better, melt 1 bag milk chocolate chips, 2 tbls. butter, and about 1/2-3/4 cups peanut butter and then spread over the top. Mmmmm, SO GOOD!

OMG!  I've made these for years, they are a family fav!  I especially loved these while I was pregnant- I could eat a whole pan in a day.  Maybe that's why I gained 45 pounds...  hmm... YUM!

Like other reviewers, added some chocolate chips (2/3 cup) after the peanut butter.  Didn't really mix it up and then immediately added the rice Krispies...the result was great!  Some pieces had a little bit more peanut butter and some a bit more chocolate, which we really liked, but you could always mix the chocolate up well before adding the rice Krispies.    To spread I sprayed some cooking spray on a sheet of wax paper and that worked perfect...no sticking!
