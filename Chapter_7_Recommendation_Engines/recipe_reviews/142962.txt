I wrote a previous review for this recipe saying my hubby & I enjoyed it but still thought it could use more flavor.  I made this several times experimenting with the seasonings and made it again for our labor day cookout using Italian seasoning in place of the basil and thyme.  Everyone raved over it.  I tripled the marinade recipe for 6 chicken breasts, putting the breasts in one bag with 1/3rd of the marinade.  I nuked the potatoes for a few minutes in the micro because I found on other occasions that everything else was ready and the potato'e were still not cooked.  That solved that problem.  I added broccoli and fresh mushrooms to the vegetable mixture and put them all in another large plastic bag with a third of the marinade. I let everything marinate for 3-4 hrs then placed all in a large aluminun foil container, poured the last of the marinade over all, sprinkled with parmesean cheese, covered and put it in the fridge until it was time to put it on the grill.  35 min. grilling time was perfect, chicken was done and the veggies were still crisp tender.

We made this last night -- first time I've cooked an unreviewed recipe.  I gave this four stars for flavor, but think if I made it again I would double the seasoning.  The packets were good, but not quite seasoned enough.  Great flavor and our boys appreciated how eas it was to clean up!

one of the first dishes that I made from this website after looking for something new that was quick and easy on the grill, which this was both! After reading the other reviews, I did make a minor change. Instead of putting the chicken breast right onto the foil, I first dipped it in the mixture, stabbing it a few times with a fork to get the flavoring inside the chicken as well. This worked out WONDERFULLY well, creating a flavorful and moist chicken. This is definately something that will be made again and again. I can't wait to share it with friends.

YUM!! The chicken was amazing! After reading tons of reviews here's what i did: I used red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar because thats all I had and I used Italian seasoning instead of the basil and thyme. I poked some holes in the chicken and soaked it in the marinade as another person suggested (I can't imagine making this without doing this) I also put the potatoes in the microwave for a couple minutes as someone else suggested.  The potatoes still didn't cook all the way and the veggies were way overcooked...but the chicken turned out GREAT! So next time I think i'll cook the potatoes in a seperate foil pack; making sure they cook all the way. And i'll add the veggies halfway through cooking the chicken.

I made this for dinner last night and my family loved it!   A few variations I made:  1. I used a bottled garlic & herb marinade instead of the suggested oil, vinegar, spices to marinate the chicken  2. I substituted chicken breasts for 2 chicken drumsticks (skin removed)  3. I chose fresh yellow summer squash, zucchini, small red potatoes, sweet vidalia onions, yellow and red bell peppers  4. I spooned a little of the marinade over the top of the chicken/veggies then seasoned with garlic salt, freshly ground pepper and topped with fresh basil  5.  I double wrapped each packet in heavy duty foil to keep all the juices in  6. Grilled the packets for 40 mins, turning often  Chicken and veggies were cooked perfectly and delicious!

I made this camping.  It was a hit with everyone, including the little ones and clean up was so nice!!  I used white wine instead of vinegar (not a big vinegar fan) and herbs de provence instead of the herbs listed.  What a keeper!

I really want to make this recipe work because I like so many things about it--one dish meal, healthy, easy cooking and clean-up.  I increased the spices as others suggested, but that only benefited the vegetables.  If I try this recipe again, I will ladle some sauce on the meat, then add the vegetables and ladle on some more sauce.  The vegetables were very good, but the chicken was very plain and, for some reason, dry.  I don't know what I did wrong, but the chicken was not as moist as I expected it to be.  I left them on the full 40 minutes because the chicken breasts were kind of thick.  Must have been too long, but the potatoes were just done  and some weren't thoroughly cooked.  However, I do think the recipe has potential and that's why I gave it three stars.

Very easy and great for summer.  The only change I would make is that I would double the seasoning.  The flavor was great.

I used olive oil, freshly picked basil & thyme, organic potatoes and onions.  This is a recipe I will use again - it was delicious.  I served it with brown rice topped with scallions and soy sauce and a green salad that included fresh mint, basil and tomatoe - all picked a few minutes before serving.  This was a summer meal that made us feel great after eating, full of wonderful flavors and made us forget it was 100+ outside!

We did not have the vinegar so we substituted Italian dressing.  My pickiest child (out of four) absolutely loved this dish, which is a miracle! She now has four different meals that she will eat!

I liked this but for some reason my green peppers tasted bitter.  Next time I will try yellow and red peppers instead of the green.  Also, I'm not sure if I would use the cider vinegar again, maybe I will use wine or a different kind of vinegar or dressing.  This is a good base recipe and anyone can customize the veggies or spices based on preference.  Clean up was a breeze!

My family loved this recipe.  I used rice vinegar instead.  I think it added a little something without being overpowering.  I also used foil pie pans.  So easy, no mess.  Thanks for the great grilling recipe!

This was easy and tasted good too.  I put mine in a large aluminum roasting pan and covered w/ foil and cooked on grill about one hour.

Very tasty!  Like other reviewers, I doubled the spices. I also substituted olive oil for vegetable oil. I grilled at 400 degrees for 40 minutes and both the chicken and the veggies were very tender. The family loved it, and clean-up was a breeze. Best of all, I had all the ingredients in the house and didn't have to make a special trip to the store.

This was the first recipe I have tried from this website.  

Like the other reviews said, I found it a bit bland, but it definately has potential.  

Next time we try it I will use more seasoning and use two layers of foil to keep the moisture in and keep the bottom of the chicken from overcooking while the potatoes finish cooking.

Probably the moistest chicken I've ever prepared!  The only reason I don't give this more stars is that the oil & vinegar seasoning blend had a flavor that, to my palate, didn't "go" with a chicken and potato combination.  There was a kind of tangy sweetness about it that I wasn't expecting.  I'll make this again and alter the "sauce."

We just bought our first grill and I was looking for a recipe like this one. It was GREAT! Very juicy chicken and tasted great. I forgot to put the mushrooms in and added some quartered tomatoes to a couple of them. Definitely will cook this again!

Yep...this one is a keeper! I love making foil packet dinners on the grill, so this one will go into the rotation. I did let the chicken marinate a few minutes in the sauce and poked it with a fork. Added a chunked up zucchini from my garden...very tasty and the chicken was so moist...yum!

I substituted smoked sausage for the chicken in this dish and it was very good!!  Little to no clean up is a nice bonus, as well!!  This would make a good camping meal.  Thanks for the easy, tasty recipe, alaskaninthesouth!

Because I had already marinated chicken before finding this recipe, I left out the chicken and made half the seasoning mix. I made a few changes, based on what I had on hand. I lightly sprinkled paprika on the potatoes after slicing, mainly for color. I cut back slightly on the oil and added butter. Because I didnt have thyme, I added a little parsley in its place. Because others said it was not as flavorful without doubling (but I was worried about too much flavor as my bf is more of a subtle flavors kind of person), I added about 1/2 tsp of Cavenders. This was AMAZING!! We will be making this often! I cannot wait to try it with the chicken next time. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I make this a lot but I put the chicken breasts, new potatoes, red pepper, carrots, roma tomatoes, celery, onion and corn on the cob. I generously butter the foil and put everything on it (or make individual ones if it's just me and my hubby) then I generously sprinkle with "french fry seasoning" and garlic salt. I put another piece of foil on top and make a tight pouch, so tight that it puffs up while it's on the grill. The cooking time is around 45 minutes on the grill, turning once halfway through. I was trying to copy Cracker Barrells recipe since they no longer have it on the menu....  Just experiment around with it until you get it the way you and yours like it  :)  good luck!

Made this the other night and it was so easy. Cooking it in the foil makes clean up so easy.

I riffed a bit based off the veg and spices I had on hand. Otherwise the method was the same. Well except I missed cooking at med high heat. I kept the grill on the solar flare setting so I burnt the bottom a little. My wife LOVED it. She’s a veg person so this was perfect. It was plenty filling for me and it felt healthy. This definitely goes into the rotation. And since you can sub almost anything in the packet, super easy to mix it up.

Took out the cider vinegar and added a bbq sauce of my choice. Turned out really good.

I marinated chicken thighs for more flavor and skipped the oil and vinegar. Keeping the grill on medium resulted in very little burning.

I've made this a lot, but I always add hot banana pepper rings n all the juice to them instead of vinegar. It adds a nice tang n spiciness to it. I also add zucchini, a few tablespoons of butter on top.

I made this dish for my boyfriend and he said the flavor was good and the chicken cooked perfect .  But the potatoes were uncooked and the peppers were over cooked. I think I need to cook the potatoes first then add them with all the ingredients to cook then will be perfect.

This is a great recipe.  The marinade/sauce is really what makes it.  With this type of recipe you can mix in just about any kind of veggies you like or have on hand.  The only thing I did differently is I marinaded the chicken for about 6 hours in Italian dressing.  I made this last week and I have already been asked to make it again.

I mixed this up enough that I feel weird reviewing it as is, but this gave me a great place to start. The only veggies I had on hand were summer veggies - zucchini and cherry tomatoes. So instead of one chicken breast per packet, I used two tenderloins, which would cook faster. I substituted balsamic vinegar for the cider vinegar, used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and added a dash of oregano. Cooked for 30 minutes at slightly lower heat than suggested. The chicken came out tender and delicious, and while the veggies were a bit soft they still had form and flavor. I will definitely be playing around with this recipe all summer long!

I've now made this recipe several times now my girlfriend and I love it. aside from nuking the potatoes, I've still been unable to get them cooked at the same time as the chicken on my propane grill. I like the marinade as written, but, now that I'm used to the recipe, will start experimenting with more spices to give it a little more kick. Breasts are great, but I tend to prefer thighs. thank you for the recipe!
