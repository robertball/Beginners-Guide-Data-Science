This is killer! I was able to brown the tofu by cooking it on high (after cooking garlic and onion on medium) and my end result looked just like the picture. I only used 1/4 cup soy sauce (rather than 1/3) and chinese red vinegar in place of the black.   Used chopped vidalia onion instead of green, which i lacked. Am eating it now and liking it much! Note: Do not omit chinese-style vinegars, which impart a particularly delightful flavor! (I did not have sesame oil today when i made this dish again so i toasted some sesame seeds and added them to soy sauce mixture--worked well).

I really love this recipe. Especially great on top of white rice. I originally sent in a 5 star review on this recipe, using Balsamic Vinegar since I couldn't find Chinese Black Vinegar. Now, thanks to my bestfriend, who sent me a bottle of Chinese Black Vinegar over the holidays, I find that the Chinese Black Vinegar made a great diffence in appearance and in taste. I would make this recipe again and again using the Chinese Black Vinegar.

I'm not really experienced at cooking or at buying ingredients so I never ended up finding sesame oil or chinese black vinegar. What I did find is black bean sauce so I added that in. It took alot longer than 10 minutes for my tofu to brown, I was starting to get worried. But eventually it did, anyway the end result seemed way too salty. I don't know if its my beginner skills and me taking 'seasoning' too far or because I used 1/3 of dark soy sauce instead of normal stuff. Anyway (this may sound a little strange) when I lick the sauce it's nice, but then when I chew and shallow the tofu, it really is too salty for me. I think I shall make some rice tomorrow and hopefully the sauce will immerse into that and become weaker (less salty). Otherwise, the green onions and garlic smelt so yummy! Also the tofu when it started browning looked really yum too. I think my results was probably influenced more on my tastebuds and skills than the recipe. I may try this again in the future with a few adjustments (e.g. less salt and less soy sauce)

Followed the recipe exactly for great results.  I used low sodium soy sauce and I found it somewhat salty but still tasted good.  I fried the tofu for about 15 minutes before adding the garlic, because I wanted to tofu crispy without burning the garlic.  The leftovers the next day actually tasted better, and the tofu was less salty and more mellow in taste.  Next time I'll let it sit in the fridge for a day for the tofu to take on the marinade sauce.  Thanks!

I used regular firm tofu since its what I had on hand. I also used just enough of the sauce to turn the tofu medium brown and that way is wasnt salty. This was really tasty, Ill make this again.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It is really tasty I usually serve it with rice and a quick veggie stir fry. I found the black vinegar at a chinese grocery store and, although I thought it was a little expensive to buy just for 1 dish, I find myself adding a splash here and there to lots of other asian dishes. Well worth the money for the depth of flavour it adds.

this was pretty good. however, i would recommend cooking the tofu first, and then adding the onion - it gets burned by the time the tofu is done.

I followed the recipe exactly and with my experience with soy sauce, I used half Kikkoman and half dark soy sauce. The tofu still came out too salty. The taste of the sauce of great, but I would definitely use significantly less soy sauce next time.

I was looking to make a Taiwanese dish and found this one. (I am Taiwanese myself). I made this for dinner and used the exact ingredients. Unfortunately, I felt that the dish was way too salty, major overload. I think the soy sauce should be cut in half of what's listed, and even then, I'm not sure I like the flavor that much, it's nothing special. I give it two stars for being edible.

This reminds me of what my mom used to make me when I was younger (only better, sorry mom!) Reduce the soy sauce a tad just to cut down on the saltiness. You can also use firm tofu..just be sure to drain it ahead of time.

I did not care for this. The tofu didn't fry up like I had hoped nor did it brown at all. The sauce was too salty ( despite my using light soy sauce) and I would not make this again.

This dish was really delicious. Will serve again. As suggested, I did brown my tofu first. I also used the liquid ingredients  to make fried rice.

I had to make a few adjustments, but it came out deliciously. In lieu of white sugar, I used agave nectar and local honey. Also, I was afraid that the sauce would be too salty with all that soy sauce, so I used half as much and substituted organic teriyaki sauce (Whole Foods' brand) for the other hald called for by the recipe.  I couldn't find the Chinese black vinegar at my Whole Foods, so I substituted Chinese Ume Plum Vinegar and the sauce tasted amazing. I also added white sesame seeds toward the end of cooking the tofu. I served this dish over angel hair pasta that had been tossed in a little sesame seed oil and dusted with white sesame seeds. I added extra chopped green onions as an edible garnish. Delish! NOTE: If you are not experienced in cooking with tofu, you need to drain it well and blot it with lots of paper towels to get most of the moisture out. Otherwise it will take FOREVER to cook and brown.

I've tried to cook tofu so many ways, but can never get restaurant quality tasting tofu dishes.  THIS dish is the BEST I've ever had!!! I couldn't find the Chinese black vinegar, but found black bean sauce as others had suggested which was excellent with this dish.  I also had trouble getting the tofu to 'brown' even after cooking it for over 20 minutes.  I finally gave up and left it soft and white, but it was still delicious.  THANKS SO MUCH!!! Will make this often!

Taste wasn't great. 
FYI, if you don't have Chinese black vinegar, you can substitute equal parts balsamic and red wine vinegars.

Very delicious, very salty!! I will definitely be making this again, but will be cutting back on the soy sauce. I didn't have chinese black vinegar, so used black bean sauce instead and I added hemp seeds right at the end. I was very pleased with the color and how the sauce cooked nicely onto the tofu. I did cook the tofu prior to adding the garlic and onions.  I also put in some fresh parsley. Served with veggie stir fry over top of chow mein noodles :)

This recipe helped me make my first tofu dish that was any good. I pressed the tofu between sheets of paper towels to suck out some moisture, as I read that this is helpful. I also made a few changes based on the ingredients I had on hand, using rice vinegar instead of black vinegar, scapes instead of green onions, and clover honey instead of sugar. Despite these changes, it was still very flavorful and delicious. I served it over rice with sauteed bok choy and carrots. The recipe calls for extra-firm tofu, but I only had firm. In the future, I'm going to use extra-firm, as the firm tofu still has a tendency to fall apart in the pan.

I just finished making this and have tasted it.  I think it needs something, I just don't know what.  I have a question.  I ended up with a lot of tofu squares and it was a problem moving them around in the pan (~10" with sides that slope up to 11-1/2").  Maybe I cut them too thin?  It also made browning a problem.  I did use firm tofu (drained).  I haven't given up on this dish.  I'll try extra firm next time.  I love tofu.  It may improve with sitting as someone else said.

Just made it for lunch. It was quick and very tasty with white rice. I followed the recipe exactly. It was a tad too salty. Next time I make it, I'll lessen the amount of soy sauce and add pepper sauce. This is a super dish. Definitely a repeat!

Loved it.  I thought it was not ever going to cook on medium, but it did, and the wait was worth it.  I didn't have Chinese black vinegar on hand, so I substituted white vinegar one-for-one.

This was my first time trying Tofu and I LOVED IT. The sauce to this is perfect and mouth watering. I added cucumbers and It just turned out even better! Thank you for this recipe!!

I loved the idea of this recipe but it was a little bland for my family. We garnished with oelek sambal and added water chestnuts for crunch. A solid base recipe to prepare tofu!

I still have yet to figure the right way to cook the tofu.  However, every time I've made this recipe, it has been awesome.

I loved the taste...but definitely made it my own...
I used 1/4 cup Low Sodium Soy Sauce; I used a teaspoon of cider vinegar and a teaspoon of white instead of black Chinese; I also substituted the sesame seed oil for coconut oil(the thought was to counter the soy sauce); and lastly used Truvia instead of sugar.  Everything was the same...I did fry the tofu alone to evaporate the water out of it first, then in olive oil with a table spoon of the mix after browned I added the garlic and green onion so they didn't burn and then added the sauce.  I put the tofu over Bulgar Wheat and 6 Asparagus Spears.  Was just amazing!!!
