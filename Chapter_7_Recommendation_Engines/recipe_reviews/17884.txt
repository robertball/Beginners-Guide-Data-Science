Cake was a hit with my guests. My mom used to make it about 40 years ago for our family of 9.  It brought back fond memories.

It only took 25 minutes to bake.  If using a 9x9 pan (as suggested in other recipes with basically the same ingredients) it may take an hour, but using a 9 x 13 pan takes much less time.

I was looking for the fruit cocktail cake that I made all the time in the 1970s.  I remember using a 9 X 13 and 2 cans of fruit.  This is it!  I actually doubled the cake part only and baked it for 50 minutes.  The topping is good for the size.  The topping caramelizes. Even better the next day.
