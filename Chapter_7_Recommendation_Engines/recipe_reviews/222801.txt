I botched up this recipe badly. Don't do what I did: Firstly, this was too sugary (we didn't have Splenda brown sugar on hand and used raw brown sugar). My spouse and I both found that the high sugar content in our breakfast servings at 7:30am made us crash by 10am and binge on doughnuts and other sugary junk food at our respective work places. I later found Splenda brown sugar at a  Canadian Superstore in the baking aisle. I also don't recommend using ED's pumpkin pie filling - I used that because that's all we had on hand. Use plain pumpkin otherwise you will over-spice like I did, since the pumpkin pie filling was already spiced. Sometimes our only purpose in life is to serve as a warning for others...

After i started putting this recipe together, i realized i was out of brown sugar AND  pumpkin pie spice. I added nutmeg to compensate and made it without the sugar. Instead, i sweetened it with stevia at the time of serving and it was delicious. My bf and I both thought this was great...like dessert for breakfast but healthy.

Love fixing steel cut oats in the crock pot/slow cooker----I have used a reicpe comparable to this which is my fave---can also sub applesauce for the pumkin but reduce water to make up for the extra moisture in the applesauce versus pumpkin---try adding raisins, chopped apples ---yummm

This is very good but I am Sooooo glad I read reviews first because there are so many needed changes.  I did what one person stated and reduced the water to 5 Cups,  increased the steel-cut oats to 1 3/4 cups and reduced the cooking time in the slow cooker to 4 hours on low.  Also, it is very helpful to line your crock pot with a Reynolds brand liner especially made for crock pots.  Very easy clean up!!  The amount of spices are way too much so I added 1 Tablespoon of each the ground cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice.  This was good but you could even add a little less if you don't like it so strong on the spices.  One last mention, I did not add any sugar while cooking.  Would rather leave it for everyone in my family to add to taste.

For those of you getting mush, make sure you are using Steel Cut oats ONLY! Rolled oats wont work. Also my slow cooker tends to run hot so I put my cooker on Warm setting and leave it over night. Oats come out perfect every time.

I really liked this, my hubby and kids not so much. I loved waking up in the morning and breakfast was done. I cut down the cinnamon to 1 T and only used 3/4 c brown sugar, regular not Splenda. Also I used 1 3/4 cup of Steel Cut oats and it was the perfect consistancy. I was worried when I first looked at it because it looked very soupy but once I stirred it up it was perfect. Topped it off with a sprinkling of brown sugar and some toasted walnuts. Yummy. Thank you for the recipe!

I've made this twice. The first time, I followed some reviews and reduced water to five cups while upping the steel-cut oats to 1 3/4 cups. Big mistake. It came out very, very dense. The right ratio is 1 3/4 cups oats to the full 6 cups water. It will not be soupy at all, just nice and oatmeal-y in texture. 

At first I also reduced the spices to  1 T each and cut the Splenda brown sugar blend to 1/2 cup, convinced it would be way too sweet and strong as written. Wrong again! 

It worked very well the second time I made it, with 3/4 cup Splenda brown sugar mix. If you like this on the sweeter side the full cup would likely work well too.

It turns out that some of the spice and sugar gets neutralized by the pumpkin, which is why they do not overpower at all.

6-7 hours on Low was perfect.

This is a really wonderful, healthy breakfast and I look forward to getting up in the morning. The recipe made enough for my husband and I to eat it three mornings in a row.

Made this the other night.  I thought it was a little on the sweet side but my daughter loved it so much she asked me to pack it for her lunch the next day.  Next time I make it I will use a little less sugar.

It was very easy to make but it turned out way too sweet for me. I used 1 cup of Splenda Brown Sugar Blend. I think I should have used 1/2 cup. Also, it was very, very soupy. I prefer thicker oatmeal. Not sure I'd bother making it again, even if the recipe were modified.

This is good, but way too much cinnamon.  Next time I will cut the cinnamon at least in half.  Otherwise, very yummy.

This was very easy and tasty! It reminded me of pumpkin pie. I only used 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and then let my family add more to their taste. Nice recipe to have when you're counting points with Weight Watchers!

First, and most important: do NOT use rolled oats. Those are the flat quick-to-cook oats (Quaker oats). Steel-cut/Scottish oats are the whole oat cut into pieces, and are about the size of couscous. Bob's Red Mill has great steel-cut oats, in your store's nutrition "health food" section. Second, the recipe stands as written. I tried some of the tweaks, but ended up adding more water/cinnamon/pie spice/sweetener. My only change the second round is using all Splenda (just trying to avoid sugar -- I prefer the brown sugar taste***) and a touch of salt. Crumble a few walnuts on top, maybe add a splash of cream or milk.  *** Just realized that adding a tablespoon of molasses to the batch gives it the brown sugar flavor without the calories and threw it in.

I found this recipe yesterday evening; so I threw it together and literally dreamed about it last night!  Sadly, I too should have read the reviews before I made it.  
1:  regular brown sugar was fine.  perhaps a little sweet, but I love that flavor. 
2:  I don't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1 tsp each of the following: cinnamon, allspice, cloves and ginger.   It is very tasty, but... ditto on the 'I love that flavor.' 
3:  I should have made it during the day, as it was pretty crunchy and toasty on the bottom. 
4:  Should have used about 1/2 cup less water.  

Overall, I would probably try this again with the lessons learned.  Still a yummy treat this a.m.!

this was a nice deviation for a usually boring breakfast.. i cut the recipe in half and made 4 servings out of it for bf to take to work.. i subbed out one cup of the water for almond milk and used 1 cup of real pumpkin puree for the canned stuff.. i bumped up the amount of oats to 1 cup.. cut the cinnamon down to 1 tsp as pumpkin pie spice has cinnamon in it (using Pumpkin Spice from this site).. i used equal parts of brown sugar, maple syrup, and sweetener to equal the 1/2 cup sugar substitute called for.. also added one scoop of vanilla flavored protein powder to make it more filling.. i think bf liked this more than i did.. as i wanted more a pumpkin flavor.. but i still think it was pretty good.. ty for the recipe

Can I have another bowl please!!!! This oatmeal is the best I've ever made! I upped the oats by a quarter cup and reduced the cinnamon just a smidgen even though I really didn't need to. I also left out the sweetener and sweetened each bowl to that days preference. One day, honey, another maple syrup and others brown sugar or Steen's Cane Syrup. I even sprinkled in a few raisins, pecans or ground flax seeds if I was in the mood.   A quick pour of milk and, voila! This recipe makes a ton and freezes well In individual portions. Just pop in the microwave and sit down to the best oatmeal ever. Those who ended up with slimy watery results need to use real steel cut oats. Not quick steel cut oats. I used Bob's.

This oatmeal turned out less than exceptional. The only change I made was to cut the cinnamon in half, and use regular brown sugar in place of Splenda. At first this smelled so good while it was cooking, just like pumpkin pie. I checked on it after 3 hours and it seemed like all the pumpkin flavor had been cooked out of it.  It was finished in 4 hours and I put it in a Tupperware bowl in the fridge to eat all week. I noticed it was VERY thick. In the morning I reheated it on the stove top and had to add about 1/2 cup of milk to make it the correct consistency. It was still lacking in flavor so I opened another can of pumpkin and stirred in an extra Tbsp to my portion & a tsp of cinnamon-sugar. 
I hate wasting ingredients, especially something pricey like organic, steel cut oats. This needs a lot of tweaking. Not sure if I'll try making it again after this batch is gone.

The flavor was okay on this, but the texture was of sludge. Prepared exactly as written, you will get a big crock of sludge. If that's how you like your oatmeal, you might dig this, but it's just not my cup.

My husband and our unpredictable one year old loved it! I made it exactly as prescribed and it was delicious. When I make it again, I think I'll cut down on the cinnamon. I thought it was a bit strong, but my husband disagreed.

Based on other similar recipes I've seen, I would cut the brown sugar down to about 1/4 cup.  1 cup seems like a typo.

I feel bad writing this review, because quite honestly I really did not care for this breakfast. I made it as per the instructions, but subtracted the sugar (because I didn't have sugar replacement, and I figured I'd just add my own afterwards). I woke up really excited for this breakfast, planning on eating it for the next few mornings. But, I found it to be waaaay too slimy, for a lack of a better description. I don't know if that is because of too much pumpkin, or water, or even cooking time. Unfortunately next time I think I'll just make my oats on the stove top, and add my flavorings after it's done.

Have tried quite a few slow cooker steel cut oats recipes and this is one of my favorites. I have a slow cooker that can be used on the stovetop for browning then put on the electric base for slow cooking. I mention this only because I think this type of cooker is even "slower". I used 1 3/4C of oats, 4C of water and 2C of unsweetened cashew milk and cooked for almost seven hours and the consistency was relatively-thin.  Which is okay with me since it tends to thicken up while in the fridge.  Very good flavor.  Threw in some golden raisins and smashed almonds when I dished-it-up.  Thanks for a good recipe.

I have been making this since the fall began!  This is the best pumpkin oatmeal that I have ever had!  The reviews were great and I used 5 cups of water, 1 3/4 cups of the steal cut oatmeal. I did not add the brown sugar but will sprinkle it on top when I have it for breakfast. I will be making this all winter long!
You have to try this recipe it is so good!!!

Made this recipe for a group and everyone loved it! I did put in a little less cinnamon and half as much brown sugar. When it finish cooking and I tasted it, I added the rest of the brown sugar. Will definitely make again!

This was delicious, although we completed omitted the sugar.  We prefer to add our own to taste!  Make sure you completely cover any area where the oats will touch with the spray, though - the places you miss will be glued to the cooker.

First, this makes a ton, so if you're the only one in your house who enjoys oatmeal (like me), I would recommend cutting the recipe in half.  Secondly, I took the advice of the previous reviews and added 5 cups of water, as well as 1/2 a cup Splenda and 1 3/4 cup oatmeal.  This turned out great.  It is the perfect consistency, has a pleasing, not overpowering flavor and reheats well.  Also, mine was done in 4 hours, not 6.  I would definitely make it again.

This came out super soup-y for me.  I added another 1/2 cup oatmeal in the morning to try and thicken it up which helped some.  I only put in 1/2 cup of (real) brown sugar which I think was about right, and I ran out of cinnamon so I didn't put as much in.  The overall flavor was pretty good, just a little too runny and mushy for me.

Just made this recipe, which I love except I cut back on the brown sugar Splenda blend to 1/2 cup which was plenty sweet. Also, mine was finished after 4 hours on medium setting of my slow cooker (not a crock pot). I suggest that you make it during the day when you are able to gauge the cooking time. Like the fact that it is lo-cal and satisfying, plus pumpkin is so good for you! House smells great! Thanks for a yummy breakfast!

Really good but it needs salt.  When you bake a pumpkin pie, you add salt and that's what this needed.  I think I added about a tablespoon of salt.

It's a great recipe. I found it very tasty, but I did modify it. I thought the purée was silly, so I just chopped up a butternut squash and used a food processor (butternut squash is very similar to a pumpkin, but you can also chop up a pumpkin). I added the squash to the crock pot with the rest of ingredients. I did not add sugar because I figured I would add sugar to taste. It also gives people the option to add alternative sweeteners (if you are feeding a group of people). I'm a big fan of steel cut oats and I liked this variation to my breakfast.

Good.  Used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 2 TBS maple syrup. Usually read the reviews before I make it.  Would have put in less sugar - maybe 1/2 cup and 1 to 1-1/2 TBS cinnamon.  Will make this again.  Looks like this will make more than 6 servings.

I tried this recipe and followed everything exactly except I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup.  It came out really soupy and didn't taste anything like pumpkin to me...I will probably try this again with less water next time.

I made this recipe on Sunday afternoon with the thought I could have a quick healthy breakfast all week long and it worked! Not only did it taste good but reheated for a single serving very well! I 
also used regular brown sugar.  Will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious!  I don't use Spelnda brown sugar, so I put in a 1/2 cup light brown sugar.  It was great - on the sweet side, but great!  You could probably get away with 1/4 cup.  I also reduced the cinnamon to 1 Tbsp, figuring I could add more to each serving if people want.  This was creamy and delicious and a real treat to wake up to.  The smell in my house was heavenly!

Way too much pumpkin pie, too little oatmeal. I cooked this in my new 4qt crockpot that cooks very hot and took the advice of some to cook on warm overnight (12hrs) vs low for 6 hours, but the steel cut oats still had a little crunch to them. This is my first time eating steel cut, so I don't know if that is normal or if I need to experiment with cooking times and settings. Also, I absolutely love cinnamon and sugar, but this was far too much cinnamon and pumpkin per bite. 1tbs of cinnamon plus the 1tbs pumpkin pie spice would be fine for cooking (since the spice already is mostly cinnamon) and you can easily add more cinnamon after if you feel it is lacking, but I can't take the overwhelming cinnamon flavor out now! Maybe the oats would have gotten bigger if cooked on low, but the consistency was more like pumpkin with some oatmeal versus oatmeal with some pumpkin. Maybe 10oz of pumpkin or additional 1/4 cup of oats as some suggested. I'm keeping the leftovers and seeing if I cook it longer whether it will absorb more of the pumpkin, but it was difficult to finish the first bowl I had. Willing to try again, but with definite changes to ingredients.

I printed this recipe almost 5 years ago and I love it!
I replace the regular brown sugar with Splenda or Truvia brown sugar I use only half of what I would use with regular. Also, I cook for 5 hours vs 6 hours.

I cut this down to 4 servings, and the only thing I changed was reducing the sweetner to just a couple tablespoons. It was a bit thinner than the way I usually make oatmeal, but it thickened up nicely as I let it sit and cool off. This has a lot of pumpkin and a lot of spice flavor, which I thought was good.

I used a can of sweetened condensed milk, subtracted a cup of water, doubled the pumpkin and spices, whisked a few eggs into the mixture  and didn’t add any other sweetener. I also threw some toasted pecans and some raisins into the pot. Delicious! Pumpkin pie for a healthy breakfast. Everyone at work loved it.

I was given another similar recipe and then found this one, so I combined the 2. I added nutmeg, a touch of ginger and some Allspice to mine instead of the Pumpkin Pie Spice, as well as some salt to cut the sweetness. I’ll definitely make it again, but will cut the brown sugar in half because I don’t like things too sweet. It tasted good with some milk poured over the top!

A tasty and fun breakfast alternative for fall. We cut it down to 1/2 cup of steel cut oats to cook in the small crock pot. You can also substitute honey for the brown sugar. We served it with milk, maple syrup, and toasted walnuts. Delicious!

I did not spray the crock and it was fine. I used regular brown sugar and it was perfect, when I try with a sugar substitute next time I'm going to cut the amount in half or it will be too sweet. I don't use pumpkin pie spice blends, I make my own and I put more spice in this recipe, I used 1tsp extra cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp cloves.

Love this! I had been meaning to make steel cut oats for awhile, and with autumn here it seemed the perfect recipe to try my hand. This did not disappoint! The only modifications that I made were to add about another 1/2 c. of oats (just because I prefer thicker oats), and I didn't have any splenda anything, so used raw brown sugar. One thing I hope everyone takes into consideration: we all have different tastes. A few people have said this was too sweet, but for me it was perfect. You can taste the sweet, but it isn't even close to put you into a sugar coma. Again, everyone is different. This recipe for me is a keeper, and is a perfect autumn breakfast!

The only changes I made was that I used 1 3/4 C SC oats to 6 C of water, no sugar but added 2 T molasses and instead of the pumpkin pie spice added 1 tsp of ginger and nutmeg each. Next time I might reduce the cinnamon to 1 T. Also, I cooked it for 4 hrs on low and it was perfect! Not mushy or soupy at all. I have a Rival crock pot that only has a low and high setting. 
This was delicious and I will make it again.

WoW! Found a local store carrying steel cut oats.  I made some suggested adjustments, cut water to 5 cups and raised the oats to 1-3/4cups.  Added butternut squash from a bumper harvest. Covered the crock-pot with plastic wrap, then  placed the lid on top -- made it air tight.  Wonderful breakfast. Thanks.

Good fall breakfast. I also like to make it without the pumpkin and just stir the pumpkin in each serving. That way I can vary my toppings if I choose when I eat the leftovers.

This recipe was OK... It came out way too strong in flavor and there was a lot of oatmeal that baked onto the crock and was wasted. It was worth a shot though.

I'm sorry, but I didn't like this at all. I used 1/2 cup real sugar and cooked it on the warm setting overnight as a reviewer suggested and I ended up with something between mush and jello. I tried to fix it up with sugar and milk in my breakfast bowl but i just couldn't eat it. The good news is I used up my steel cut oats, so I don't have to find another way to use them.

Loved the pumpkin flavor! I followed the recipe except that I used regular brown sugar.

I made this last night and my family liked it.  I did not find it to be too sweet or to spicy.  I agree with the person that suggested adding salt.  I cooked in the crockpot on warm overnight and the texture was perfect.

Target didn't have steel-cut so I used 'old-fashioned' which I assume means rolled. Also, I'm poor so I didn't want to shell out for a different type of brown sugar than the regular stuff I already had. Turns out, both are necessary; I ended up with brown sugar soup in the morning, in part because of the functionality of the crockpot which is overly hot.

My family didn't care for this at all.  The spices were too strong, the oats too runny.

I made the recipe as written and found the spices over powered the pumpkin. I'll try making this again because I love pumpkin, but I plan on playing with the amount of the spices so that the pumpkin flavor doesn't get lost.

Increased the oats per reviews and decreased cinnamon.  Still was watery after all night on low.  OK flavor used turbinado sugar hubby liked it.  Would make again with less pumpkin.  Thinking how to convert the leftovers into muffins.
