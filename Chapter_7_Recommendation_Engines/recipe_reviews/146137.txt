Loved this!  Even my 12 yr old went back for seconds.  I didn't boil the zucchini. I put them face down in the microwave for 4 minutes with just enough water to cover the bottom of the dish.  It cooked them til tender without making them soggy.  (halved recipe so I only used 2 zucchini)  The biggest change I made was I used cheddar instead of the mozzarella; and increased shredded parm and reduced bread crumbs to equal amounts. Also, I didn't want to turn on the oven on a hot summer day, so we made these on the grill.  They didn't really brown on top, but they were so delicious it just didn't matter.  Great summer recipe!!

This was absolutely delicious. My guess is the poor reviews come from reviewers overcooking the zucchini during the boiling process - which would cause it to taste soggy as they report.  I pre-boiled the water, dropped the zucchini in, boiled them steady for 2 minutes, then turned off the heat and let them sit in the water for the remaining 3.  They were perfect!... flexible, yet still firm.  Then, I brushed with oil, sprinkled with pepper and put under the broiler 5 minutes.  I stuffed each zucchini generously per the directions, and put under the broiler one minute.  The topping was browned, the cheese melted, and it was crispy on top, perfectly warm in the middle and the zucchini was perfect.  No soggy-ness whatsoever.  Fanstastic.  What we loved most was that they were a refreshing take on stuffed potato skins without the heaviness of the starch and gritty-ness of potatoes and skins!  We gave this a 5 out of 5.  This is a definite keeper.  Love it, and thanks for the recipe!

I cooked them a little different than the recipe instructed but that's because I did them on the grill.  These came out fantastic on the grill!  I ommitted the bacon bits and the mozzarella.  Really yummy right off the grill but still delicious the next day cold.

This is a great idea in theory. In practice, the finaly product is soggy. I may play with the recipe a bit - possibly frying the scooped out zucchini (yikes) to get that crunch that we expect from potato skins. This might make them more appealing.

The flavor and idea is really good...the turn-out not so much.  The zucchini was pretty soggy.  I would like to try it again with a much shorter boil time.  Also, the breadcrumbs and sour cream just kind of came together in a paste that never changed in consistency through the cooking process.  I think with some tweaking this could really work.  As is I was left wanting a retry : )

Very tasty! I substituted turkey bacon for bacon bits and it was delicious. You do have to be careful not to over boil the zucchini to avoid mushy shells but as long as you're attentive to that one thing, the recipe is a hit.

This works great for yellow squash as well!  I load mine with a mixture of cheese, bacon bits, breadcrumbs and chopped jalapenos.  Then I wrap in foil and grill for 20 minutes or so.  The recipe I have has you boil the squash whole, wait for them to cool completely (which takes forever!!) then slice lengthwise and scoop the insides...the sides tend to droop and it's hard to keep the 'stuffing' in.   Next time, I will scoop first, then boil to see if that keeps them firm!

This tasted great even though I didn't have the bacon. Even my 12-year-old son (who doesn't like many vegetables) loved it!

Excellent! I followed one of the suggestions and just microwaved the zuchinni for 4 minutes, then followed the rest of the directions. I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and cut back some on the mozzarella. Next time I'll use more cheese and maybe change up the kind of cheese. The parmesan is really what makes this dish.

I have not made this but it sounds good.  On the website it was listed as dairy-free.  
Was the Parmesan cheese a change?
