I normally do not eat sweets but I wanted to try this.  it is very sweet but I mixed up Martin's with a half of a lemon and it tasted like a lemon drop or lemon martini.

I used cotton candy peeps.  I only used 6 and left them in for 2 days.  I didn't strain it either.  The cotton candy peeps don't have the coating.  It was quite tasty.
