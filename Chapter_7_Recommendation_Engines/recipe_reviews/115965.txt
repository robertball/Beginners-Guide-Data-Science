Wow!  This soup was quick and easy, and best of all, it tasted great. It is very creamy with the corn starch and ratio of 1 egg per cup of broth.  Thank you for a delicious recipe!

Great recipe!  The only thing I would change is the ground white pepper was way to much, try a 1/4 tsp of it.  The 1/2 tsp made it a little too overpowering.  But again, it does say optional.  I loved the large amount of egg compared to the other egg drop soup recipes on this site.

On a hot summer day, the last thing I expected to make tonight was soup. However, the craving fought long and hard and I finally gave in. I found myself searching AR for something quick, and with ingredients I had on hand. Presto, this was perfect. I did have to make a few adjustments, though. I didn't have broth on hand, so I threw 2 chicken bouillon cubes into a cup of hot water. I omitted the food coloring, and the salt. The bouillon cubes + soy sauce= enough sodium already! Also, instead of chives, I chopped up some green onion. Now if only I had some potstickers and fried rice...

In my mind this was just perfect, a delicious prelude to the Korean Saewoo Bokkeumbap (Shrimp Fried Rice) that followed it. (recipe also from this site)  I don't know what it is, specifically, that makes this soup so good given its simplicity, but I can only guess it's the addition of the sesame oil, which I love. I prepared the recipe just as is, only mixing the cornstarch with part of the chicken broth rather than water and adding no salt or pepper.   I made two servings, one serving each for Hubs and me, and regret I didn't make more.  The consolation is that this is so quick and easy to prepare I could whip up more in no time!

Great recipe!  The sesame oil that the recipe called for seemed like a lot to me so I just put a few drops in.  I also don't use chicken broth (I never can get through it all in time), instead I used chicken bullion powder.  Delicious!

I was really happy with what I wound up with. I was looking for something warm and cozy and as close to our local Chinese Restaurant as possible. This was a good pick. I made one adjustment, adding more cornstarch because I like a thicker consistency but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Next time I am going to add some sweetcorn, like the local restaurant does just to see what I end up with. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

If you use low sodium, no fat broth - you can use the soy sauce without making it really salty!  My favorite way to make a meal out of it is to add some shrimp sauteed in garlic and cabbage to the soup - filling and yummy!

This was so easy to make. I had never had egg drop soup and it was good. I didnt use the cornstarch or food coloring and I used green onion instead of chives.

This didn't turn out so well for me, and tasted kinda blah. I don't think I'll try to make it again.

Loved it!  This was so simple & quick to make.  It had better texture than than the soup from your average chinese place. I used low sodium soy sauce/chcken broth & seasoned it with salt at the end as needed.  After reading other reviews, I decided to only add 1/8 tsp sesame oil. Dried chives worked well in this soup too.  I will definitely make this again!

I really do hate to give recipes bad reviews, but this just didn't work out as great as I thought it would. 
I was kinda of hoping it would be 'Better than Resteraunt Quality' like the title said, but it was nothing like any egg drop soup i've ever had. 
I'm not saying that that's a bad thing, because it definetly had a unqueish flavor that wasn't all that bad, but I was just hoping for a more authentic eggflower soup. 
If i made it again I would definetly not add the sesame oil,because it made the whole soup taste like sesame oil; so I aDDED more soy sauce. 

also, more chives could be added, and instead of white pepper, I used just plain ground black pepper.
sorry for the kinda sortaish bad review, but thank you for reading!!!!!

This is a decent soup.  I always use 1 can of chicken broth (14.5 oz.) to one egg and 1 tbsp.+ cornstarch (for a preferred thicker version).  As at my favorite restaurant, I add a few pieces of frozen cubed carrot for some color.

This is so easy to make.  I used "homemade chicken broth" from this site and reduced sodium soy sauce.  I didn't have any trouble getting my eggs to string.  I didn't have any chives but I bet that would make this a five for sure.  This would be great on those days when you just don't feel good.

I followed recipe to a T, but doubled for 2 people.  I would have to say that by adding soy sauce ( i used reduced sodium soy) made the color of the soup odd, and it was just too salty.  Adding food coloring was pointless. The chicken broth adds enough salt to this.  The consistency was good.  I may try again, but omit the soy sauce all together and perhaps just a drop or two of sesame oil.

A little overboard on the white pepper, I'd reduce to at least half and use a tad bit more soy sauce. I also find using just the whites of the egg provides a less chewy and better consistency of the eggs.

I just cooked it for my parents and they love it.  It really is just like the restaurant egg drop soup.

The serving suggested is tiny, I would make at least 2 servings per person (everyone was bummed when there wasn't any seconds).  Also the chives aren't necessary if you don't have any.

Perfect and oh so simple to make!  I've always loved egg-drop soup but never quite found the trick to make it at home and have it taste like the restaurant-until NOW!  The corn starch and probably the sesame oil are the "magic" ingredients which take this up to the perfecto level.  One cup of this is hardly enough, I doubled the recipe using a can of chicken broth which is about 2 cups of liquid.  Add some chow mein noodles on top and this is instant chinese heaven at home!

Based on the reviews, I adjusted the recipe just a tad.  I cut the soy sauce and sesame oil to 1/4 t, used fresh black pepper and substituted green onions for the chives.  Oh, 1/2 t of cornstarch and 1 t of water.  Thank you for posting this recipe....perfect for this blustery, chilled to the bone day.  :)

I changed quite a few things to make this extra delicious. Instead of chicken broth, I used 1 tsp better than bouillon. If you do use better than bouillon, I suggest only salting to taste since it has quite a bit of salt in it already. I also did not use ground pepper, but used a squirt of siracha (or any hot chili sauce) to give it a kick. So gooooood!

This recipe was delicious and so incredibly quick and easy. I made it exactly as written with the exception of food coloring. Mmmm It was so good. I would not change a thing. I even loved it so much that after I ate it, I had to go back to the kitchen and make myself a second batch. I will definitely be keeping this recipe handy!

This got my daughter's big seal of approval.  Awesome soup!!!  Loved the amount of egg!  Gave it 5 stars, though, because we like it a bit thicker so I added a bit more cornstarch (3 tsps. extra for double the recipe) and we added corn.  Will definitely be making this again!  Will be adding mushrooms and tofu like the restaurant down the street!

Very good soup.  I think the key ingredient is the sesame oil.  Will make this again.

I never realized making egg drop soup was so simple and quick. This is a wonderful recipe and definitely meets its title. I feel like it has much more flavor than restaurant egg drop soup recipes. The only thing missing was the rice noodles but we used Ritz crackers instead. :-)

I really enjoyed this. I quadrupled (if not more) the recipe and used fresh chives and green onions from my garden. I will probably add even more chives next time as I love chives. I didn't measure the cornstarch so I could tweak it to make it really thick. With the six eggs I used; it made a really thick soup. Perfect! Thanks Darren for a great and simple recipe.

Thanks for a really good and easy recipe.  The only change I made was to use 1/4 tsp of turmeric in place of the yellow food coloring.  Delicious!

Yum! Everyone loves it at my house, even the guests. I've made it a couple of times just as listed except I used olive oil in place of the sesame oil. I will be putting sesame oil on my grocery list though so I'll have it for next time. I'm sure it will change the taste a little. This one will be a regular in my recipes.

Great soup! I love having this soup at restaurants and I wanted to try to make it myself. Followed the recipe fairly closely; i didnt add any food coloring, chives, or pepper, didnt think it was needed. It still tasted great. Highly recommended

My family didn't like this one too much.  I added more soy sauce & sesame oil than it called for to give it more flavor & the egg was very unattractive. (I wasn't sure how to get the ribbon effect, so it was big globs of egg.) Probably won't make this one again.

This was very good. But... I only used half the amount of pepper an it was too much and we love spicy HOT foods.  The kids wouldn't eat it because it was too hot.  I will make it again but w/o the pepper.

Very yummy! (Used homemade chicken stock, added a bit of fresh parsley, and threw in bean thread noodles just before we ate) Went together very quickly with few ingredients. I've never had it in a restaurant but I thought this soup was great & the boyfriend liked it too.

Made this twice, once without the white pepper & once with it, both times without the thickening agent. It was AMAZING without the pepper, and almost too peppery to enjoy with it, and that’s coming from a pepper lover. I would recommend not adding the white pepper, or maybe just a pinch.

This wasn't necessarily BETTER than restaurant quality, but it came really, insanely close. A lot of reviews don't make the recipe as it states, I did, and it came out wonderful. Second time around, I changed the recipe not to include cornstarch and I used bouillon (chicken) instead of broth and it still came out just as good. 10/10 would recommend!

I have made several different egg drop soup recipes and this was the best! I didn't have any of the sesame oil and it turned out great. The only thing is I would double the recipe but only use one egg.

Fast and easy! I agree with other posters that the pepper is WAY too much. I used less than 1/2 tsp of pepper for double the recipe. I also omitted the food coloring as I didn't feel like it was necessary. It turned out well and I will be making this again for sure.

My son tried "this" soup thanks to a teacher at his school, that wanted to give the students an appreciation of her home style cooking. He RAVED about it. So when I found this recipe, I tried it. He LOVED it! Said it was JUST like his teacher made!

Great quick and easy recipe!  I doubled the ingredients so, both my husband and I could share.  Very tasty!! This is a warm comfy soupd for a breezy cold winter day - Luckily, we had shrimp egg rolls (store bought) that we warmed up in the oven-toaster. Yum!

It was good but it looked awful! My husband really liked it but I would never make it for someone who had never had egg drop soup before it might scare them.

Easy and tastes good,  thanks for the recipe!  I modified slightly using liquid aminos instead of soy and arrowroot instead of cornstarch.  I also added peas and carrots for added nutritional value.  Yum!

I have tried to make egg drop soup twice before, but the third time (this recipe) is the charm!  Thanks for sharing!  I did not use chives because my son won't try anything with green in it.  I also skipped the food coloring.  I did use everything else per instructions and topped it off with chow mien noodles.  Yum!

This egg drop soup is absolutely great!  I quadrupled the amounts for four servings.  I really love the flavor of the sesame oil.  It adds to the quality of the soup.  Thanks so much for the recipe, Darren.  I will make this again and again.

Great recipe! i doubled it and accidently read it as THREE tsps of soy sauce and three 1/4 tsps of sesame oil and it still tasted great! didnt add food coloring - its not necessary and used green onions instead of chives. i omit the ground white pepper and instead let the people put it into the serving bowls separately - ppl have different levels of spiciness ;] will make again. very easy, delicious, and comforting

Exactly as desired!  We followed the advice of other commenters and halved the soy sauce.  I might toss in a tiny bit of ginger next time, but maybe not - this really was just what we wanted, and ridiculously easy to boot.

I did not care for the first batch because we found the sesame oil to be overpowering.  But maybe we just don't like sesame oil?  So the second batch I made with buillon cubes because I was out of broth and I left out the sesame oil.  Then it was pretty good!  Oh, and I also halved the amount of egg.

Was very good. I omitted soy sauce to save on salt intake. Added chicken bouilion to add more chicken flavor, but was little too salty for our taste. Will cook this again,, makes for nice hot soup on cold day. Thanks for recipe

The seasoning for the broth is great!  We prefer less egg... maybe just one egg per three servings.

I'm surprised, (with so few ingredients) but this was really good!  My picky kids loved it and said it was as good as our local Chinese restaurant.  The only thing I changed was using a lot more cornstarch (at least double, maybe a bit more).   And it was fast and easy! I have a feeling I'll be making this for the kids quite often! Thanks!

Wow I'm not sure what made this so much better than the other egg drop soups I've made!  Maybe the sesame oil, or that I was just really hungry ;)  I loved this!  I did not use the food coloring or cornstarch.  So good, thanks!

I made this recipe in my high school Foods class and it was so simple! It also turned out very well and looked exactly like it was supposed to. We didn't use the yellow food coloring and our still looked great! We did use the two teaspoons of water and it worked!

Very good recipe :)

I don't normally like soup like this or have ever eaten it but this is really good. It was a little spicy though so I would do less pepper but not by much because that's what gave it it's flavor. I would recommend this to anyone who loves or likes egg drop soup!

This soup was very tasty but had a little kick to it. It was plenty salty for my taste. I liked it over all. this soup doesn't look like it would be a soup i would like but i did.

I have had to make this twice in the last two days.  My family really liked it.  I did add a little more soy and sesame oil and used black pepper.  The first time I x3 the recipe this time I x5. PERFECT! I always have all the ingrdients on hand which makes it nice.

I was wanting some Egg Drop Soup, and this recipe looked like what I wanted. Wow! Awesome recipe! I'm allergic to corn, so I used Rice Flour instead, and I doubled the broth and added some udon noodles to it (which is why I added more broth). It was AWESOME! I recomend this!

This was pretty good, I chopped up some carrots, celery and mushrooms, I didn't have sesame oil so I used olive oil.. I think the added veggies really make this soup 'pop' =) I will make again.. with my added veggies!

This is an excellent, super-simple, and very flexible recipe. I didn't have the chives, so used a tablespoon superfine minced yellow onion. Like another reviewer, I used the whole recommended amount of fresh ground white pepper, but I would suggest halving that to 1/4t of white pepper as it was a bit overpowering for such a delicately-flavored soup. Last, I used veggie broth rather than the chicken broth. I will be making this again and again with all of our surplus eggs. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was definitely too salty in its original format, and I even used low sodium soysauce, and only 3/4 of a teaspoon at that.  I had to add 3/4 of a cup of water to it to sort it out.   Adding chopped green onions is also an absolute requirement if you want to have the authentic Chinese taste. With my additions I would give it 4 stars, as it was better than most egg drop soup recipes, but definitely needs some tweaking.    (FYI, sometimes I add a dash of cayenne pepper for an extra kick, but it's not necessary.)

This was quite good, my first attempt making it at home. Make sure to SLOWLY mix the egg in: I got a little overzealous so my presentation wasn't the greatest. For our tastes we added the cornstarch and salt, not pepper. Thanks for sharing.

Followed this one exactly (didn't have the yellow dye, though-- will get it next time!) and it was excellent. Made it with broth made from bouillon cubes and had plenty of crispy noodles to dip into it!

Very yummy!  I made some adjustments: I added some mushrooms,omitted the pepper, and made adjusted the ratio of broth to eggs (I made 14 cups of broth and used 10 eggs). Everyone enjoyed the soup!

The best egg drop soup I've ever had!  I love this recipe becuase it is so flavorful.  It's also very versatile I can always adjust it to make it with what I have on hand.  I make it very frequently because as a starving college student, good cheap recipes are essential =]

May cut down on the egg next time, but yum :D Makes a quick meal if you toss in some smashed instant noodles and let it cook whilst you clean up (with so little ingredients, I only have to put back the soya sauce/sesame oil/cornstarch and the bowl that I beat the egg in)

But I can't say if this is better than restaurant quality since I have never tried egg drop soup in a restaurant since they don't have those here in S'pore

This soup was simple to make and tasted great, pretty authentic restaurant taste.  We added frozen peas at the end and just let them sit in the soup for a couple minutes after the heat was turned off.

I'm sick with the flu, but I woke up hungry. This is PERFECT. Simple and fast. Added salt and pepper to taste. My bowl was half-gone before I even had a sip of my coffee, and that's saying something!

Yes, this is better than restaurant Egg Drop Soup.  Quick, easy and delicious!  I made it just as is and it is now a staple in our house.

It was just what I needed!  Doubled the ingredients (knew one cup would not satisfy) and made the soup as noted with the exception of yellow food coloring.  Such a nice comforting soup.  This recipe will be on top of my "favorites" menu folder.

I used black pepper. 1/2 tsp would have been way too much. I used almost 1/8 tsp and we thought it was too peppery. I guess I need some white pepper. Otherwise, this was fast, easy, and it tased good.

I'm addicted to this soup. Love the recipe. I left out the optional ingredients. This tastes better than any restaurant Egg Drop Soup I've ever had. Real easy to make too. I saw a review from 2008. Well, I'm here to state that in 2020, it's still a great recipe. Thanks Darren.

I had extra chicken broth left over from a different dish and decided to give this a try. This recipe gets bonus points for speed and simplicity. But I found the soup just a little on the bland side. My teenager loved it though, so I'll likely make again.

Used 1 tsp of Better than Bouillon Roasted Chicken flavor and 1 cup of boiling water for the chicken broth. Used low-sodium soy sauce. Used the cornstarch.  Didn't use food coloring, salt or white pepper.  Didn't have chives, but did have green onions, so finely cut some of the green part of the onion.  Love it!  Will make often this winter for a little comfort food with no guilt at 100 calories!  Yes, this is definitely better than any restaurant version I've ever had.  Thanks!

I used chicken base and added a very thinly sliced mushroom and more cornstarch than the recipe suggested (I like my egg drop soup thick). Additional salt was not needed. I've made it twice and am  still working on getting the egg in larger pieces. I think I'm stirring it too soon once it hits the hot broth, but no complaints with the flavor, it's delicious.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

So easy to make. Turned out just the way really good egg drop soup should. Have made it before but never used corn starch and it made all the difference. Used green part of scallions as that was what I had

I made it exactly as written and it was great. Wife daughter and I loved it. Slightly spicy. I’ll halve the amount of white pepper next time. And I’ll have to triple the recipe next time. First time was experimental.

Loved it!  Thank you for this recipe, I adjusted it due to no chicken broth on hand.  I used the chicken seasoning packet in the chicken Ramen Noodles package and added the noodles to the soup as well.  I doubled the recipe but used only 1 package of Ramen Noodles and seasoning packet.  I also only used maybe a 1/4 teaspoon of white pepper, even with doubling the recipe this had plenty of bite for me.  Didn't want to use food coloring and as it turned out, the chicken seasoning packet made the soup plenty yellow.  Will add chicken pieces next time and maybe some carrots.  The corn starch was great for this, I even doubled that as well, liked the thickness. Husband even loved it!  Will make again!!!

Simple, extremely quick to make and tasty, (I stole a spoonful for myself). This is one of my daughter's favorite. She was craving some, so I Googled, realized I had everything in the house to make it, (didn't use or need coloring), and had it ready to eat in a bowl within ten minutes. Fantastic!

My 13 year old daughter had a craving for egg drop soup. We had all the ingredients  and no plans for lunch. 
We made it together, exactly as written. It was simple,  super quick to make and DELICIOUS on this cold fall day. She’s planning on making it as an after school snack next week : )

As a college student who has very little time for meal prep, this recipe has been my saving grace more times than I can count. I can double or triple the recipe, even, and it will turn out perfect every time. This soup has been far better than any that I’ve had at a restaurant, and I can make it in my own little kitchen!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! 
Amazingly good and much better than restaurant quality. The instructions made it super easy to make. This is the second time making this recipe. This is an easy to remember favorite recipe now

I made it as written.  Just a note to "Amy" who said it is blah.  Egg drop soup IS blah.  It's just a prelude to a spicy, perhaps, meal!

We loved it! I was not going to use the food coloring but in the end i did. Just made it look better. I was amazingly happy how easy and good this is. 
Thank you for sharing.
Btw.... The quality of chicken broth you use will greatly effect the flavor!

This is going to be a re-run soup.  It was very good.  I did put the eggs into boiling chicken broth, next time I will take it off the heat first.  If you like egg drop soup, this was really good.

This was my first time making Egg Drop Soup, and the first time I've ever eaten it. It took me only about 5 minutes to make it, it has only about 5 ingredients, including the seasonings & the cornstarch. I didn't have any chives, but it didn't matter because it was delicious! I will be making this a lot, especially when the cold weather comes! Really tasty for so few ingredients!

Pretty good! A nice and different way of eating eggs on keto and it's pretty good for you containing bone broth, eggs, and pepper! I added around two eggs because I accidentally cracked one and may even consider adding more eggs next time. I also used olive oil because I did not have the other, I skipped the food coloring and cornstarch, used wasabi soy sauce (it's very mild), black pepper because I didn't have white and big chunks of one little green onion. I didn't even miss not having noodles (which I know this normally doesn't, but I was craving ramen). Oh and I didn't add any salt, it didn't need it.

Update: I have now made it 2 days in a row. I doubled the recipe and quadrupled the egg amount to four as a post-workout meal. Still good, but really filling so if you double the recipe make sure you're really hungry. Still good. Next time I really want to try it with garlic fried shrimp like someone mentioned and with the low-carb noodles to make it sort of like a top ramen.

I skip the oil, double everything, use 3 eggs.  I add 1/4 cup chopped green onion, a little dried basil.  I separate out my wife's bowl and add a teaspoon of Tobasco to mine.  Great midnight snack, or soup with Asian entrees.

I made six cups and eyeballed proportions. I didn’t have green onion on hand, instead first lightly sautéed dried onion pieces. Then I added water, 1/2c white rice, Then followed the rest of the directions. It came out delicious! It is the first time I’ve tried to cook egg drop soup and I can’t believe how easy and tasty it turned out.

Simple, Quick and Delicious!
I used Chicken base to make the broth,
& had some rotisserie chicken left over, so I added it.
I'm making this for our Memorial Day gathering!

So simple so delicious. I made an 8x batch nearly exactly as written and it was delightful. I suggest skipping the salt and using low sodium chicken broth and low sodium soy sauce. I recommend adding pepper in your own bowl cause it can be too much in the big pot. It also doesn't need any food coloring. I didn't have fresh chives so I made do with dried and it was still excellent.

I just got done making this recipe. I wasn't too thrilled with it I don't know if maybe if my taste buds are off or what. it just didn't taste right to me. I'll try it again next time just minus the white pepper.

The perfect, quick meal to whip up on a cold day in South Dakota. Original was going to substitute the sesame oil for canola, however after a quick peruse through my oil cabinet I found a spare bottle that had been unopened. Suddenly I have a new favorite oil!

If you have a family to feed, you will need to make multiples of this recipe. I have a family of three  and made eight times that called for in the recipe and there was barely enough. The white pepper called for felt like a lot, but as it turns out, the white pepper is one of the secret ingredients found in restaurant quality egg  drop soup. So don't fear the pepper!

That was enough white pepper for two to four times that much soup! Wowza -I tried it before adding curry powder.
I doubled all the other ingredients and added a dash of yellow curry powder. Still too much white pepper, and I normally add it at restaurants.  
Definitely enough white pepper for 6 or more cups of broth. 
-aIbout the curry;   feel chicken broth recipes peak with just a little yellow curry, and I just like it. I do it for chicken noodle even.

I used two eggs to one cup of chicken broth for extra egg in the soup and 1 teaspoon of ground white pepper for an extra kick to make it a little spicier.

Pretty good.  It was easy to make.  I tripled the recipe because there were three of us.  One of my kids really liked it and the other said it tasted like lake water.  I enjoyed it.  I will make it again.  With out lake water. lol

I found it did not have much flavor.  Also would have liked it a bit thicker, which I realize I could have done with more cornstarch.  Followed another's comment and used chicken broth with the cornstarch instead of water.

It was hot and delicious. The next batch I will use less white pepper. I used a little bit too much and made it a bit spicy. Normally, egg drop soup is not spicy. I loved the texture and flavor.

I make this at least every week or two. We both love it! I make it adjusted for 3 servings, for the two of us, but only do two eggs. We feel that plenty of egg. When adjusting the servings to three, though, it's WAY too much pepper. I thought it would just make it spicier with the amount of pepper called for, but all I could taste was pepper. I use 1/2t each of salt and pepper. I don't add food coloring, as it's just the proper color already!

I have never cared for egg drop soup and being Asian, I have eaten in Chinese restaurants all over the place, and this is the first egg drop soup I actually love to eat and make – so simple and so authentic in taste!!  I agree – it is better than restaurant quality!

It was good.  I left off the food coloring, which has no basis for the flavor but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I had a little left over the next day so I perked it up with some Chinese Chili Paste and it was even better.  I like spicy, so it’s a matter of opinion.  If you’re looking for the “Chinese Buffet type Egg Drop Soup”, more corn starch might be needed.

This soup was really good and was quick and easy to make. It was a little too salty for my tastes, but next time I make it I'll try leaving out the soy sauce or cutting down on the chicken broth.

Honestly, this was not very good. Not sure what restaurants are inferred but this is not authentic. More like egg scramble with a stock base. Tried it any way. I trusted this recipe since it was on All Recipes. Looking for a standard. Disappointed

Very good. Omitted the salt and pepper as it was not needed. I also used arrowroot instead of cornstarch since that is what I had on hand. Will be making again.

Hey this worked great but only difference is the first time I used cornstarch and it was chalky so I used arrowroot powder instead and it nailed the restaurant style.

Very simple and basic recipe. I have used both beef and chicken bouillon cubes to make the broth and it always comes out nice. It's very fast to make too!:)

Loved this recipe!!! It's always been my go to when I'm sick or have a sore throat. And yes!!! It was better than restaurant style. 

Only changes are that I agree that the White pepper is most likely way too much for most people but it felt AMAZING on my throat. Also, I added a couple dashes of ginger powder after seeing other recipes calling for it. 

Thanks for sharing!!

I made 4x the recipe with water and chicken bouillon instead of chicken broth, and didn’t use food coloring, but otherwise followed the recipe. We served it with chow mein noodles. I loved it, and my dad, who went to the Philippines and Singapore, said it was good. His suggestions were to use less egg, and use the food coloring to have a truly authentic dish. I’m going to try using 3 eggs in 4 cups of water next time.

I made a few changes to this that really intensified the flavor profile. I started with boxed broth, and added 1/2 chicken bouillon cube. I  also like some veggies in my soup, so I  added a mix of frozen veggies  with carrots, peas, and cut up green beans. I also put in a little bit of ground ginger.  fresh ginger would also be good. I didn’t use as much pepper as the recipe suggested. And I didn’t measure the sesame oil or soy sauce, I just used a little bit.  Green onion is great in the soup.  I have a freezer full of homemade broth, but when I’ve tried it with homemade broth the chicken flavor is too intense. Canned or boxed broth seems to work better and is a lighter broth for the soup, which it needs.

I made this recipe almost to a tee. I used fresh green onions instead of chives. and I also didn't measure my pepper and my salt I just gave it a little dash of each. turned out really well. I also got wonton wraps and fried them up to put in the soup.

Definitely not better than restaurant quality, but it was one of the better soups I've made at home trying to replicate that delicous golden buttery goodness I find at restaurants.  I followed the recipe pretty exactly, but used black pepper instead of white.  Nice soup.  I'll make it again in cold weather.

I wanted to try this recipe out. I’ve only recently tried egg drop soup because it looked so slimy and nasty. I finally tried it for myself and it was amazing!!!! However, this recipe is definitely not better than restaurant. This was extremely bland! I used low sodium chicken stock, all else the same. I added some salt to my cup but it didn’t help the lack of flavor.

I will try to add a little chicken bouillon along with the chicken stock. For more chickeny flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time. Way too much pepper for my family, but otherwise fantastic. Added only a pinch of pepper on the second one. Perfection!

Loved this recipe! Super easy to make and had great taste. I added just a bit more sesame oil, but only because I love the flavor! I think this will be one of my go to comfort foods/soups.

Delicious! The sesame oil and soy sauce are what sends this soup over the top. I don't bother with the corn starch mixture because the eggs thicken the soup nicely. Top it off with fresh chives and enjoy!

I thought this was a good egg drop soup recipe. Quick, easy, and the flavor I expected. However, I strongly suggest using less pepper. I'll definitely be cutting it in half the next time I make it.

Easy and very good.  I only use a drop or two of sesame oil and that would be my only change.  For me sesame oil overwhelms the other ingredients. You can always add more.

I found it to be almost tasteless and too runny.  Adding more cornstarch and seasoning will help.  Also, stir the scrambled egg slowly as you drop it in the boiling mixture won't dilute the egg so much.

Definitely a useful base to work from, but fairly bland as written. I like to add ginger and a little bit of sriracha just to get some more complexity of flavor in, and I frequently add more cornstarch to make a thicker soup. Sometimes I’ll use low sodium soy sauce so that I can add more of that flavor without making the soup over-salty.

If I want something more filling I’ll also add various vegetables, but that’s getting beyond the scope of this recipe!

Very good, but way too much white pepper.  In future, will let everyone sprinkle however much they want rather than add to the whole batch.

I wasn’t a fan. It tasted too much like chicken broth. Is there a way around this perhaps? When ever I’ve had egg drop soup at restaurants it never taste like chicken soup. Any help would be great.

Absolutely simple and delicious. Watch out for the sesame oil. I would add in small increments. Depending on the oil, it can overwhelm the soup.

So I left out all of the optional stuff, and the chive because I didn’t have any on hand. I just used a few drops of sesame oil. I added a bit of garlic and ginger paste. I just used a bit of freshly ground pepper at the end. So really, I just used this recipe as a guide for where to start. It turned out well.

I thought this turned out great! I was feeling a little under the weather so I wanted egg drop soup, and I’ve tried to make it with other recipes in the past. This was by far my fav and so easy. I read a bunch of reviews so I only did a couple drops of sesame oil and a pinch of salt/regular pepper. It was great. I might even add more cornstarch next time (just a little) because I could of even gone a little thicker. Great recipe though!

I had to substitute the sesame oil for olive oil. My husband LOVED this! It is too peppery, so next time I’ll cut it in half. But he insists that I must make this again. It is much more eggy than what you get in the restaurant, but it’s pretty good. I quadrupled recipe so there would be leftovers, but they were consumed pretty quickly. I loved how easy this recipe was!

This was easy and good.  I used low sodium chicken broth so added the soy sauce.  I wish my broth had been heartier, then it would have been a 5 star, my fault , not the recipes.  I also used green onion rather than chives since that's what I had.  I will make this again.

I used 1 cup of water with 1 teaspoon of Better Than Bullion No Chicken vegetarian base. 

It was so fast and so good!! I would maybe add bamboo shoots next time just for another variation. Nice low calorie soup too!

For my first time making this soup it turned out pretty good.  The only thing I changed was a pinch of ginger root powder, garlic powder and onion powder (cz I didn't have chives).  You absolutely need green onions or chives.  I'll keep making it to perfect it.

I'm Taiwanese and my parents made this soup growing up, but with can of corn thrown in. I always eyeball the sesame oil and soy sauce. The cornstarch slurry is a must to get the consistency, adding more if you like it thicker. Recently I've been using homemade chicken stock which really makes this soup even better!!

Although good, I wouldn't classify it as better than restaurant quality.  It lacked something.  Maybe if I had made homemade chicken broth it would have tasted like what you get in a restaurant.  Probably will not make it again.

This soup is good but didn’t taste like any of the egg drop soups I’vehad at Chinese restaurants. It was also too runny for me and not the thick consistency as at restaurants so I’d more cornstarch!

This recipe is decent as is, but  found the flavor really popped when added a small splash of rice vinegar to it to round it out. I made sure cook off the vinegar aroma before serving.

I didn't have any chives, but added green onion.  The taste was great, but a bit overwhelming on the amount of egg.  When I make it again, I'm going to do 1/2 the amount of egg (I make large quantities, not single servings).

I followed it close, not perfectly, but no to the onions. I prefer it without. Wonderful, tasty delightful flavors in your mouth. I love my local Asian Bistro's egg drop, but this takes its to another level of good, as I use organic free range eggs and homemade bone broth, life is beautiful. Love 0n!

I subbed glucomannan for corn starch and left the eggs in larger pieces. Just a few drops of sesame oil and only a shake of pepper. It was delicious!

This is a great standby for when one wants comfort food quickly, and because it's so fast and easy to make I was able to experiment and find my perfect version.  The end-result greatly depends on the ingredients used so make sure you are happy with your brand of chicken broth / bouillon, soy sauce, and sesame oil. I never use the food coloring, white pepper (never have any), or salt (there's enough salt in the bouillon and soy sauce). Potato starch can be used instead of corn starch to thicken, but the soup is still good without either. If you're picky about your egg consistency, watch some YouTube videos first to perfect your technique -- some in my house like them stringy, (the way it's served in Chinese restaurants) and some will only eat it if more closely resembles avgolemono (Greek style).

This is my basic go to recipe for egg drop soup now.   I made it the first time as written and it was really good.   Since then I've made three changes.   First I doubled the chicken broth because I like my egg drop soup a little thinner.   Second, when I beat the eggs I add in a dollop of vegetable oil--that makes the eggs thread out better when I drizzle them into a rolling boil.   Third, I add 2 teaspoons of cider vinegar to clarify the liquid which also adds just a bit of a tang to the soup.

I  had never had egg drop soup before, but my husband adores it. He said this was excellent! I did use less sesame oil as it can be overpowering, and I did mix the cornflour with milk instead of water to make it a bit more creamy. So delicious and hearty on a winter's night :)

This is a favorite at our house. I usually add one or two more eggs per batch to make it a little thicker and more substantial. Also is good with rice added.

This is a great start. First time I made it per the recipe. It was missing a little flavor. Second time with a couple tweaks was outstanding.
Based on using 2 cans of chicken broth:
I added half a large white onion sliced up and 4 Tbs. of Oigatsuo Tsuyu concentrated soup base. Brought it all to a boil, and kept low boiling until onions were almost translucent.
After those modifications, 5-star!

So easy and tasty! I didn't have soy sauce so I used worcestershire sauce. I also added some canned corn. The consistency and taste was great!

Great easy recipe, but to take this dish up a notch I added 1/4 teaspoon of chinese black vinegar and a little extra soy sauce. Adds a bit more flavor than just chicken broth and egg.

I wanted to up the serving size so I added more of each ingredient.  I also added red pepper, just because I like my food to be spicy. This is a really good recipe though, as the food came out looking delicious!

First try was not a success. The egg was still kinda clumpy. The second try, with a lot more patience, was great.

Followed directions and it turned out fine. I added a dash of Turmeric for the color. Might add mushrooms next time. The egg 'tendrilled' out pretty good considering it was the first time. I used unsalted broth and needed to add more salt later. I'll fix it again.

I made this almost exactly by the Recipe.  The only change was I made my own Chicken Stock (which is better...and cheaper than buying "stock in a box".    My wife is on a low carb diet and was not feeling well.  She loved it....and even though I made a double recipe...would not allow me to offer it to our neighbor.  She wanted it all.  For me, I would consider adding a bit of cayene, or hot sauce to spice it up.  But for what my wife wanted....it was simply perfect...and it is a simple recipe.  Good luck... and Bon Appetite

Very easy to make and was yummy.  Didn't add salt because the soy sauce and chicken broth already provided enough sodium.  Will definitely make this again.

It was very bland. Double the soy sauce & salt. Also add 2 drops of hot sauce per serving. Then it started to taste more like restaurant style. 

Oh, & don't mix while dropping in the egg. Just drizzle the egg around.

Simple and good. Definitely go with the optional corn starch. Probably a little bland for some but a perfect base to add your own flair to.

This was fast, easy, inexpensive and delicious!!! I had to double the recipe for our house and didn't have any scallions to add at the end so I substituted. I put a sprinkling of dried minced onion in while boiling, instead. The hubby said, "Dang babe, this is sooo good, it tastes just like the restaurant's."

WONDERFUL!!  I had my wisdom teeth out and wanted something more than a chicken broth.  This soup hit the spot!  I used Knorr chicken granules as the broth and did not use food coloring.    The first time I made it I thickened it with arrowroot powder but the 2nd time I didn't thicken and both turned out great.   This will now become my go to "broth" type soup.

IMO soy sauce does not belong in egg drop soup, I omited the soy sauce and used some ginger powder and used green onion instead of chives because it's what I had on hand.  I bet it would've been better with fresh minced ginger but it was still good.

I really appreciate that this soup didnt have the snot like consistancy of some restaurants (the consistency was perfect), but other than  that, it was very dissapointing. 

Granted, I didnt have green onions on hand, and used minced onion instead, however the green onion wouldnt have made that much of a difference on the final flavor. It was incredibly bland to the point of being inedible. 
I had to add garlic powder, onion powder, ground mustard seed, smoked peprika, parsley, nutmeg, ginger, ground black pepper, more soy sauce, and rotissery chicken just to give it a flavor somewhat resembling a restaurante egg drop soup, and it still didnt hit the flavor mark. 
Skip on this, and go for a recipe that actually uses seasonings.

I set the little calculator to six servings and made it exactly as written, omitting the chives and white pepper at the family's request. It was fantastic. Way better than any restaurant egg drop soup we've had. This one is going in the family cookbook.

Based on other reviews, I decided to make some modifications and it was absolutely incredible. Great recipe!

4 cups chicken broth to 1/2 teasp sesame oil and 1 teasp low-sodium soy sauce and a dash of white pepper. All were mild background flavors, rather than taking over the whole dish. 

I had originally tasted with less chicken broth and soy sauce but the sesame oil was too overpowering. This modification was exactly what I had hoped for.

Great recipe. I used a smidgen of turmeric for the color. I also used low sodium broth and "no salt mixture " for salt substitute.  Came out great!

Great flavor as is, but i did add two spices in place of 1 other. Instead of the yellow coloring, i used a tsp of turmeric along with black pepper, great color and so very healthy. I also left the salt out, personal preference. Thanks for the great base that i could build on. As far as the negative (blah) reviews, just add some extra spices etc, takes the (blah) away. Everyone's taste is different, so hard to rate negative when you change ingredients. Anyway, great base recipe!

The reviews don't lie. My family LOVES this soup. I added a few noodles to it. One thing to remember, pour the egg in slowly. I used a whisk to stir them in and did not get the beautiful ribbon effect. Overall, GREAT recipe.

This is very nearly the same recipe that I use.  Usually, I would make about a gallon or more for bigger parties.  I sauted about a cup chopped carrots in a buttered skillet and about a cup of frozen peas to the soup after thickening it up with cornstarch. Don't leave out the sesame oil or soy sauce. It is good with them, but make it to your taste. However, too much sesame oil is daunting.  Then, I cut up uncooked wontons to about 1 1/2" X 1 1/2" and fry them in oil until lightly browned, then put them on paper towels to soak up the oil. Then I put them aside in a big bowl.  I put wontons and sliced green onions (no chives, no food coloring) over the top of the soup in each bowl when serving.  Wow, the fried wontons and green onions on top are great!  I have a hard time finding chives in a store anyway.

It's okay but needs some work. The sesame oil was overpowering. I suggest a couple drops. The pepper was also strong. Next time I half it. Lastly I had to add a lot of salt but I use low sodium both and light soy sauce. It seems to be missing something.

OMG, this recipe is so easy and good.  I have a super picky 12 year old and have to literally shove food down his throat.  I made him taste this egg drop soup and it was a hit.  This is the 4 item in his life time I was able to add to his list of food favorites.  I've made it for him 3 times in two weeks.  Thanks Darren, awesome recipe.

I followed directions specifically. It turned out too thick, too salty even though I used 33% less sodium chicken broth and added only the amount of salt in the directions, so I added 1/3 cup water to dilute it and it still seemed too salty and thick. I couldn't save the batch unfortunately.

I skipped the corn starch and I used scallions. I added salt, pepper and Asian seasoning but it was bland. That could be because I used olive oil and not sesame oil because I don't have any.

Sooooo good!  I had a craving for egg drop soup and I was so happy to find this recipe.  It is simple, but delicious, and I already had most of the ingredients at home.  I did use less pepper because the first time I made it according to the instructions the pepper was a bit overpowering.  I also added more cornstarch because I like a thick egg drop soup.  Thanks for this!

Very easy and great tasting recipe. Only made small substitutions because of what I had on hand. Used green onions instead of chives and I added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. Will make again. Fried wonton crisp are a great addition to this soup as well.

To make a larger quantity changed the water to 3 cups and changed the soy and sesame oil to 1/2 tsp.  I also used 1 cube of Edward & Sons "not chicken" bouillon. Everything else I kept the same. It is so delicious.

So happy I found this recipe!! In my opinion, it's 100 times better with bouillon cube and water than canned or homemade chicken broth. I probably prefer it this way because that's more like how the American Chinese restaurants prepare it. No cornstarch, food coloring or pepper for me.

I wanted some soup but didn't feel like leaving the house and I'm not a fan of canned soup so I needed something quick and easy. This soup is just that!! So quick and easy to make and it is delicious!! It's also simple to adjust the servings which is just what I did. I quadrupled the recipe with the only exception is that I only doubled the sesame oil as it is so strong. I also added 2 chicken bouillon cubes and a little extra soy sauce and omitted the optional salt. I will definitely be making this quick, easy, yummy soup again.

it was fantastic! almost better than restaurant quality! For a decent sized bowl i used a can of College Inn Broth which is 14.5 oz. (over  2 cups)which means that you may have to triple the size of the ingredients but it is all based on preference. i also added a splash of rice vinegar to aid in making the egg chunky. i put 4x the recommended amount of soy sauce (i like it salty).

While this soup had a good flavor it was not the velvety, yellow egg drop soup I was looking for. The amount of soy sauce to me just seemed too much as did the amount of sesame oil. Other than the soy sauce taste being a bit overwhelming it also made the soup a not so nice brown color. I saw no point in the yellow food coloring since it was so brown but I put it in anyway but it didn't affect the color. I will be searching for another recipe.

I used a can of campbells chicken broth, a few drops of sesame oil , green onions, one egg, some liquid egg white and it was delicious. No need for soy sauce or salt. Left out the cornstarch since I am on low carb and don't care if the soup is thick or not anyway.

I really like this! I was out of canned chicken broth, so I used homemade unsalted bone broth I had in my freezer. I added salt but didn't measure - just shook the shaker over the bowl and tasted until it was right. I added 1/4 tsp. white pepper and love the dimension it added to this recipe.

I love this recipe! I will never go spend money on egg drop soup again ;) I added peas and carrots that added just that extra bit of flavor and texture that made it just that much better. I also used low sodium chicken broth and added salt to taste. Turned out great!

Definitely for fans of egg drop soup — if you don't like restaurant quality, you probably shouldn't make this. I didn't  include any of the optional ingredients or the green onions, but I thought the soup came out great. My broth was thinner and cleaner (less greasy) than the soup from a typical Chinese restaurant, and the egg to broth ratio was high. Go for a very slow pour to get the egg pieces thin, or a faster pour if you like them a little chunkier.
Super easy, very cheap, high protein/low calorie. Great diet on a budget recipe.

it was too bland for me. I will try to make it again with more salt and something else, but I do not know what yet. I did use two eggs instead of the one, because I always think there is not enough egg in the restaurant ones

My husband and I both LOVE IT!!!!!!! this is way better than restaurant made soup, two changes were I used Bullion instead of broth made it much better also I did not have sesame oil so I used butter( gave it kind of a creamy still soupy taste). Also you can add as much egg as you like I began making the "normal" size recipe but the last batch( I have made four in 2 months) I had to quadruple the recipe!!!!

Been making this recipe for years. Definitely the closest to the Egg Drop Soup found in Chinese Restaurants in America.  And now that I live overseas, I'm so glad to be able to make it for myself. So, thanks.

Today I tried adding a cube of frozen spinach to it. I don't think I'll do it every time, but it is also good prepared that way.

This recipe is super easy to make.

I doubled the recipe, used one egg, plus the cornstarch mix and the tops of chopped up green onions.
No food coloring and I put in some shaved carrots.
You can tweet it from there.

I didn't like the taste of the sesame oil, nor was I crazy about the corn starch. I could be wrong but I think the corn starch doesn't allow the egg to cook like you see it in  restaurants. Before I bag this one I plan on making it one more time without either of these ingredients and see how it goes.

Awesome, simple recipe! I'm on a tight budget this week, and this was an excellent fix to my "what's for dinner?" panic last night (and delicious to boot). I substituted 1/4tsp Chinese Five Spice for the white pepper and the oil for a touch of aji-mirin, since I didn't have any, and it tasted great. I'll definitely be making this again!

Great recipe. Easy, quick. Just a few suggestions… 1: sauté the chives in the sesame oil then add the broth and the soy sauce. 2: don't bother with the food coloring and cornstarch. 3: add a little more soy sauce and it won't need salt. (I used mushroom flavored dark soy sauce)

I've made this twice now and loved it each time! It's so quick, easy and adjustable to your personal preferences and the ingredients you have on hand. The first time I made it I didn't have sesame oil, chives, or white pepper on hand. According to other reviews, I didn't add any salt. I subbed in some black pepper (not the full amount), and threw in some onion powder. It turned out really well but could have used a little extra salt (my bad). The second time I made it, I tripled it for my hubby and brother, both of whom raved. Still no chives or white pepper, but this time I did have sesame oil and it added a whole new dimension of flavor which I thought improved it. I put in the full amount of pepper (black), and it was definitely too much. I also put in 1/2 tsp of salt and that ratio seemed to work well. I threw in some more onion powder to add some extra flavor. Can't wait to try it this summer when my chives are ready!

This Egg Drop Soup was surprisingly more delicious than I had anticipated. I made mine with homemade chicken stock and left out the cornstarch and food dye. I poured the hot chicken stock and seasonings (soy sauce and sesame oil) directly on top of the beaten egg (same bowl for beating eggs and serving soup) to save washing dishes. The egg cooked instantly. Thank you Darren for sharing your recipe.

Half teaspoon of white pepper is WAY too much.  I tried to dilute it by multiplying the recipe minus the white pepper to no avail.  Made a fresh pot without any white pepper, and it was good.  I do like white pepper, but that was overkill.

Great recipe! Simple & easy to make but I wish I had fresh chives. But it was good without out. I used 2 eggs instead of 1 which was perfect.

This was so yummy and so quick and easy.  Definitely will become a winter dinner staple. Teen daughter put it over rice, also delicious.  I tripled the recipe and I think next time I will triple everything except use only two eggs.  I didn't use the food coloring, but everything else was as written.

This was good egg drop soup but I prefer the other restaurant style egg drop soup from this site..it isn't that this is bad, it just wasn't better....besides this is slippery soup and I spilled an entire bowl in the middle of the table...bad karma and all....

I had to add way more corn starch, but that was because I love a thick egg drop soup!  all the flavor was there, but I felt it needed a little something. I added a baby spoon of oyster sauce and it was perfection!

Egg drop soup is the easiest recipe.  This one is very similar to the others, but I thought the egg was too much so I halved it.  I used Turmeric to give it that happy yellow color.  Why add artificial colors.  And no additional salt needed.

I just made this and agree it is very tasty. I left out the oil to save calories. Caution to not add salt until you taste, especially if you used chicken bouillon with normal salt. (Use Better Than Bouillon!!) I also took it off the heat to swirl so the bubbles wouldn't break it up too much.

I made this for breakfast (hungry & on AR) and it was wonderful! I like a bit more spice so I added a dash of garlic powder, some chopped celery (going bad & didn't want to throw away) & regular onion (no chives). Super yummy, I only added a dash of the white pepper & added a pinch of salt to my scrambled eggs. This is now my "go-to" Egg Drop soup, thank you Darren!

One of my most favorite soups and this is spot on!! I don't add the white pepper but it is still fabulous! It's even better than what some Chinese restaurants try to pass off as egg drop soup!

This was fantastastic!  And ready in 5 minutes!  I used a green onion rather than chives (what I had).  Also used 1 cup water plus 1 tsp chicken bullion powder in place of the broth.  It was so much better than expected!  Thanks for a great recipe!  I will be having this again soon!

Very tasty - thank you for posting this.  I, like everyone else, had to add my own twist.  I didn't want to make just one cup, so I quadrupled it. Also, my favorite Chinese restaurant has great egg drop soup.  One day while eating it, I bit into a tiny bit of minced fresh ginger.  So - for a quadrupled recipe, I added a minced piece of ginger root (about 2 teaspoons. You'll need to taste it.).  It went from very tasty to magical. However - as most folks know, too much ginger is like too much salt or too many licks from a dog.  It's good, good, good, then all the sudden, way too much.  So - add a spoonful if you think you'll like it, simmer it for 5 minutes, taste it, then do it again.  Just a suggestion.  I also added a handful of ling ling brand pot stickers for the final simmering stage for something solid to bite into with my meal.

Seriously delicious! I can never find an egg drop soup I like. Ever since my favorite restaurant that had an awesome egg drop soup closed, I have been disappointed @ every soup I've had...until now! Thank you!!!! Even my 2 sons love it! And they're only 4 & 6 :)

I have never made Egg Drop soup before, but with the help of this base recipe it turned out great! I used about a cup and a half of home made pork stock (asian inspired made with fish sauce and daikon)that I had left over and needed to use.  I veggied it up by adding diced carrot, kale, and peas.  Still used the same amount of cornstarch and the thickness was just fine to my preference.  I will definitely make this again!! Thanks. 

Oh, and I didn't use the food coloring and did not add salt.

Great soup!  I couldn't believe how fast it was to make, and the best thing about it (aside from taste) is that it's written as a recipe for one and easily converted to make larger amounts.  Finally an easy recipe that does not leave single me with an ungodly amount of leftovers!

I don't really like egg drop soup, but I thought this was good!  I was a little spicy though.

Delicious!!! BUT, this solely depends on how much ground white pepper you use!! I made 4 servings of this, so I quadrupled everything. I only used 1/2 teaspoon white pepper total, which was PLENTY. Next time I will even use less white pepper, but definitely use some bc it gives the soup a great kick. This soup is easy to make too!

So simple and awesome!  To me, the white pepper is a must.  I load up on green onions on top, or stir in thawed frozen veggies... doesn't change the original flavor, just adds some healthy crunch.  Thanks for the recipe!

I 6x the recipe and thought 6 eggs would be too much.  Tasted thin and brothy, so I added the rest of the 6 eggs which helped.  Maybe cut the broth a little more and up the sesame oil and add more cornstarch.  All and all, pretty good..just need to tweak a bit to suit my husband's taste.  He loves egg drop soup!

This recipe makes a great base to work with!  I followed the recipe with a few slight changes.  I added 1/2 can of whole kernal corn, used black pepper in place of white (I didn't have white pepper or the sesame oil which I omitted altogether) and I used 2 cans of chicken broth in place of the 1 cup...I was doubling the recipe.  It turned out great, but was a bit too salty...due to the soy sauce which I think I will omit next time.  I also think I will add the corn with juice and all to give the broth a sweeter, corn flavor.  Even my 6 year old nephew and 3 year old daughter gobbled it up and asked for more!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and but was conservative with the sesame oil and white pepper, using about 1/4 tsp each, and 1/3 tsp or so of dried chives. This tastes so much like what I get in the restaurant, although my egg pouring technique could use some work. ;) Glad to know I can make this without tempting myself with the whole buffet. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!  Good soup.  I tripled the recipe and it made enough for two big bowls.  I went easy on the white pepper; just added it to my taste.  But it was definitely easy.  I will be making this again.

I thought this tased like Egg Drop soup but it wasn't thick like it. I used the amount of cornstarch it said to use but it was still thin.  Next time I will try more cornstarch and hopefully that will thicken it up.  It still tasted pretty good though.

I make a lot of egg drop and this one is one of the best I've had from this site. I did add an extra egg because I like mine real eggy. And, food coloring is a must if you want the bright color for presentation but it isn't a necessity. Great recipe for the egg drop fans!

This soup was fantastic! I added in a lot more scallions because I love them... the only suggestion I'd say is to avoid the soy sauce or use a light broth, because it came out very salty and I had to add water.

this turned out wonderful - I quadrupled the recipe and it was just delicious.  It definatley needs the soy sauce and the sesame oil for authentic flavor.  I also made homemade crispy noodles by cutting wanton wrappers into thirds and frying them in canola oil for a few seconds each.  Wonderful!

I loved this! I made a serving of 6, and I made a few alterations. I did not have broth, so I used 1 bouillon per cup of water. I also added a bit more sesame oil to taste. I also used 7 eggs instead of 6. I loved the extra egg! This will definitely be a favorite in my recipe box :)

Loved it.  I needed something soothing and easy to make in my flu-ridden state.  I schlumped into the kitchen and performed step one in a microwave, with a pyrex measuring cup.  I then broke the egg right into my boiled mixture and stirred.  So easy.  For diabetics and Atkins devotees, this recipe is perfect without the cornstarch.

Phenomenal. My husband said this was the best egg drop soup he has ever had. I used all of the optional ingredients except food coloring and I used regular ground pepper instead of white pepper. It was fabulous, not too thick. It was like a soup should be. It was very filling and had a great taste. If you are making it for more than one person, make sure to double the recipe. I quadrupled it so we could have it at another meal in a few days.

This really was better than Restaurant Quality!  I've never eaten so much soup in my life.  The sesame oil really makes it.

This is an okay recipe. It's easy and most of the ingredients I already have on hand.The reason I gave it a three stars, was because I believe the instructions should have told you how long to keep the eggs on the flame before taking it off heat. THe first time I made this the eggs seemed to curdle? and got a funny texture. I'll try again and hope to have it taste a bit more like the stuff in restaurants.

This was the best egg drop soup I have ever had and sooooooooo simple to make.  My husband said he will never order egg drop soup in a restaurant ever again.  I made the soup exactly as instructed (including the options).  The only thing I did a smidgen different was add fresh chives and fresh cut green onions.

This soup was terrific. My daughter has been sick for 3 days & I made this for her, she said it was the "Bomb".  I used my frozen chicken broth & some left over beef broth & it was still good!

Since my favorite local chinese restaurant closed, I have not been able to find an egg drop soup to my liking... UNTIL NOW, that is!  I am so excited to have found this perfect recipe, with only a few modifications.  I multiplied all ingredients by 4, with the exception of the white pepper.  I also didn't have any chives on hand, but next time I will definitely add them (with maybe a little corn, too). No more taste-testing, I've found my new favorite!

Just what I was looking for.  My husband requested this and it had been years since I made it.  Remembered it was easy, but not just how to put it together.  Went looking, and tried this recipe.  So glad I did.  Used a little less sesame oil and added mushrooms and petite peas.  Am adding this to my favorites.

This was great! My husband whom has never eaten egg drop soup raved about this dish, and both of my young children kept coming over for extra bites. I followed the recipe to a "T" except for the spice amount. I used just a small amount of fresh ground sea salt, fresh groung pepper, and a sprinkle of dried chives. My husband suggested adding rice and chicken to it, maybe I'll try that next.

This stuff lives up to it's billing. Easy to make, easy to remember, my husband and I both adore it (and my husband is a macaroni and pizaa guy), so this is a definite keeper. Try this!

Yummy! Very delicious. It goes beutifully with egg rolls and rice as well. (To fit the Asian theme, I served tea with dinner as well!)

I thought this recipe was EXCELLENT! The ONLY thing that I would do different next time is add half the pepper, or add to taste after cooking. I added some fresh mushrooms before the soup was boiling and topped with fresh green onions. DELISH!!
