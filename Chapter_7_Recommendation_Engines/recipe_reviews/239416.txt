Fast, easy, and delicious! It went well with red beans & rice and a little Crystal Hot Sauce.

This was excellent, very tasty. Plus I didnâ€™t need a lot of ingredients, so no need for a trip to the store in holiday traffic! My husband eats fish a lot for protein and he loved it! Great for athletes/bodybuilders to stir up your meal plans. Very quick to prepare.

Bought some very fresh Tilapia and used the Cajun Spice Mix recipe on this site. Followed directions exactly and we devoured the lot. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing this Beth.

I used cajun seasoning for tilapia and they turned out sooooooooo good. My husband just loved it.  We ate simple brown rice with it. 
One thing i did was used more cajun seasoning then the recipe calls for as we (as desi people) eat more spicy food.
