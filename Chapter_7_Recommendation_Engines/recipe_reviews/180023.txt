Fast, easy and good. I doubled the amount of marsala, water, and beef base. I added a little more mushrooms and onions.Sauce added a lot of flavor to the steak.

I thought this was excellent with my grilled tenderloins.  I didn't have any mushrooms so I just left those out and I added a bit more marsala since it reduced to almost nothing.  The flavor was fantastic and I poured some of it over my baked potato too.  Great, guilt free sauce since no butter is used.

Easy and delicious. On Thursday nights, I cook for my husbands buddies.  He sets the table, and I prepare the meal.  I marinate the steak and he grills. The Marsala Wine sauce was an afterthought. So glad I did.  The sauce complimented the steak unbelieveably.  Side dishes were baked asparagus spears wilth balsamic vinegar and soy sauce, stuffed sweet potatoes with brown sugar, pecans and marshmellows, and homemade pecan pie...  I didn't have to wash the dishes and clean up the kitchen.   They did.. !!!!

This sauce was pretty good but not unusual.  I need to use my marsala wine up so That's what I used.  I'm not sure what beef base is so I used some beef broth I had.  I used this with some very tender steaks... thanx for the recipe.

This sauce is absolutely delicious! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I made a few simple changes. 1. I doubled the sauce ingredients and trippled the water. 2. I caramelized the onion in a bit of butter then added the mushrooms, it creates a rich yummy flavor. 3. I made the sauce and kept it warm while the steaks were cooking since the steak cooks so fast. 4. Just in case anyone was wondering you broil on High (the recipe doesn't specify). Over all very delicious recipe. Thanks for sharing!

The sauce turned out great!! used beef and onion soup mix instead of beef base! GREAT SAUCE!! but the steak came out looking real good (nice and pink) when you took a bite thats where the flaw was. It was chewy and tuff!

This was very tasty. I omited the onions. I just wish there was more liquid since most of it evaporated. Next time I will add some more.

I felt that the sauce needed something so I can't give it 5 stars.  I added minced garlic and I felt that was the missing ingredient.  I sliced the steak, doubled the sauce and served over pasta.

Loved it! Used chicken bullion cube instead because I didn't have beef base. Played with amount of Marsala, (used about a cup). Next time I will add more mushrooms because they really are what you bite into that soak up all the flavors of the sauce. Delicious! This works with chicken as well.

Very good recipe, best sirloin steak that I have cooked, it even pleased my wife, so it must have been good. I did cut back on the wine by 1/2 since we don't like things too sweet.   thanks for the recipe..

Okay recipe, quite a strong wine taste, even after it cooked out a bit. Good, but not a wonderful raving recipe.

As written, the sauce was extremely salty.  I added an extra cup of water and boiled back down but it still was too salty.  Will try again in the future and tweak the amount of the beef base as I go to settle on the right measurement.
