Instead of vanilla ice cream, I used homemade vanilla frozen yogurt. I also used super chunk peanut butter only because that was all I had. I did not try this myself but the kids loved it. They said next time, add chocolate.

I put the ice-cream, peanut butter, and milk into a tall, sturdy cup then mixed it with a hand-mixer set on high using only one beater. The results were the smoothest, fluffiest, most delicious treat of my life. Long live peanut butter!

45 minutes seems like a long time to have something in the blender but i'm willing to try it because it sounds yummy.

Obviously, a recipe that is ready in 5 minutes won't require you to blend for 45 minutes! More like 45 seconds! Aside from the obvious typo, this is a great & simple recipe. I added about 1/2 cup of sugar and a couple of tablespoons of caramel sauce. Better than restaurant quality!

What I did to make this just slightly better, take the peanut butter and put it into a bowl and melt it down first, till it's a liquid, then pour it over top of the vinalla ice cream, then add 1/4 cup of white milk and then add 1/4 cup of chocolate milk. Mix it up till its smooth. Literally the best peanut butter shake I've had

I made this recipe as an after dinner snack and it was amazing. Although it was hard to blend the ice cream and peanut better together, I would recommend blending it a little bit at a time. My husband and friend really enjoyed this and I will definitely be making it again. can't go wrong with a simple and delicious recipe like this.

This was super yummy! The 45 minutes was obviously a typo, and should likely be 4-5 minutes. It would probably be melted after 45 minutes haha! I love peanut butter, and I love ice cream! So this was great for me. Thanks!

This was amazing! I used my immersion blender and added two tablespoons of malt powder. Also used frozen custard because I’m from Wisconsin and the more butterfat the better! Lol

The peanut butter froze rather quick, but I guess the chunks gave it texture. It was OK.

I used low-fat vanilla frozen yogurt, a little more skim milk than called for, and chunky peanut butter.  The kids and I liked it, but thought it needed a bit more peanut butter to really make the taste come out.

Needing to cover the medicinal taste of Vanilla Boost, I used THAT in place of the milk. Couldn’t tell the Boost was in it!  Unbelievably good, rich and creamy...WOW!  Thanks for sharing.

This looks really good! Do you mind telling me how much of each ingredient you used, and if it would be any good with almond or coconut milk (I'm dairy intolerant). Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly (aside from 1 teaspoon of cocoa powder) and the result was wonderful. It was a perfect base for the peanut butter chocolate milkshake I made it into! The thickness was up to the typical milkshake standard, and made exactly one serving in a decent sized cup.

I think you get the best milkshakes when you don't use too much milk. The proportions are just right in this recipe. I did add extra peanut butter just as a personal preference. I also made another one for my daughter and added a raw pastured egg.

You're probably going to need more of the ingredients. I used about 1.5x the recipe and got less than one serving size. Other than that, delicious!

Okay first off I will say YUM! I find it strange it says to blend for 45 minutes.. maybe it's suppose to be 45 seconds. I find it really thick, so maybe less ice cream more milk. Otherwise, DELICIOUS!
