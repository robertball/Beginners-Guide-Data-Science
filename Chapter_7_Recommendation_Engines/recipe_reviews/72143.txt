Fantastic!  I did not change a thing and this recipe was perfect.  I cut the squash in half lengthwise, scooped out the seeds, then microwaved cut side down in 1/4 inch of water in a casserole dish for 13 minutes.  It turned out just right in less than half the time.

This is really tasty. I did have to change a few things because of my diet. Used Ground Turkey, Cabot 50% light cheddar cheese from Sam's (melts good), and I cut the squash in half, covered with plastic wrap and baked 10 min in microwave. (faster than oven)

This recipe is awesome!!  My brother in law loved it and he doesn't eat veggies.  I doubled the meat because that's what my husband likes, the extra lb was hot italian sausage.  I used italian seasoning instead of the individual ones , ended up using 1 1/2 cans of tomatoes because of the added meat and doubled the cheese.   YUM!!!  I can't wait for a party so I can suprise everyone with this dish!  Original recipe would have been perfect too, just changed it for my family's tastes. Thanks!!

Very good base recipe, if a little bland - it needs a little tweaking to be truly delicious.  Next time I'll increase the onion and all the seasonings, add a little cayenne pepper for zing, and throw in a can of tomato paste and some sliced mushrooms.  A few tips: Start with a big pot - the recipe as-is was waaay too big for my skillet, and I had to transfer it to a soup pot halfway through.  Also, the toasted seeds of the spaghetti squash made a great snack.  I coated them with a teaspoon of butter and some Worcestershire sauce, ground mustard, garlic powder, paprika, and salt, then toasted them for 25 minutes while the casserole was in the oven (stirring halfway through).  Fabulous!

This was excellent using homegrown spaghetti squash!  Instead of using the nutritional info (it seemed high), I figured this out according to my weight watchers points system.  This made 8 cups of food and each half cup serving was 4 points...a great meal in my book!  Thanks for posting this!

This dish is delicious! If no one told you that the "noodles" were squash, you would swear it was pasta. It doesn't have that squashy taste. The dish was easy to prepare and very flavorful. I think the cooking time should be reduced a little bit, maybe to only 20 minutes, but otherwise I recommend it highly!

This was great!  I used zucchini instead of the bell pepper and mozzarella cheese.  It was excellent and good leftover as well.  Will definitely make again.

My husband really liked this. I didn't have diced tomatoes so I used crushed and it was really good. I also substituted slices of chicken for the ground beef and my husband noted that the chicken "made the dish."

This recipe definitely needs some tweaking. A little on the bland side. The salt shaker was making it's way around the table at our house. I love the kid-friendliness of this squash, though. I told them it was spaghetti and they did not question it. :) Would not make it again as is, but there is something to build on here...

Great recipe for using spaghetti squash. To make it easier to cut the squash, cook whole in microwave for five to seven minutes. Take out, cut, and return halves to microwave to finish cooking another 10 to 7 minutes or so. This is so much easier than trying to cut through a raw squash. Save seeds. These are delicious baked in the oven with a little salt and/or pepper or seasoning of your choice.

This was a FABULOUS alternative to baked spaghetti!  I made a couple of minor adjustments (just personal taste) and used part ground beef/part italian sausage.  Once cooked/browned, I added the tomatoes and onion to the meat, added italian seasoning, additional crushed oregano, and garlic powder...simmered that about 20 minutes to let the flavors merge a bit before adding the squash and cheese....worked like a charm, and was FAR from the bland some complained about.  DEFINITELY WILL BE MAKING AGAIN...and again!

It was very good to me.  Half my family enjoyed it a lot and the other half thought it was "just okay."  It seems like this is a dish that either you really like and are intrigued with the spaghetti squash or you are wishing it was real spaghetti.  Healthy, though, and I give it a thumbs up for that effort, especially for low carb diets.

Wow. This was unique and delicious. My husband and I both liked it a lot. I loved the spaghetti squash instead of the typical noodles or pasta. It's healthier too. I will be making it again soon.

My family loved this recipe, though I must confess I made a few changes. I have been on the hunt for casseroles that are still light and spaghetti squash fits the bill but the ground beef does not.  So I substituted ground chicken instead. I also traded out the shredded cheddar for shredded swiss.  Which takes the entire recipe down to 281 calories per serving YAY! and it's still yummy!

Sooooo good! It's a great way to lighten up a cheesy, meaty dish. I didn't read the recipe very carefully and didn't stir in the cheese but just melted it on top, and it was still delicious. This was my introduction to spaghetti squash, and I will for sure make this again.

Great recipe!  I've made it with the beef for a main meal & without beef for a side dish.  I doubled the recipe & made it for a potluck (without the beef).  Had great reviews as some of them have never used spaghetti squash before.

Loved this.  Made a few changes, though, mostly just to spice it up.  Used half beef and half spicy Italian sausage, and threw in a diced, seeded jalapeno.  Doubled the tomatoes and garlic.  Also added about a cup of cottage cheese along with the cheddar just to thicken the sauce as well as make it a bit more cheesy.  Enjoy!

When i was younger my Mama used to make a stuffed zucchini. She made it special for me because I liked it so much. Since she passed away a few years ago I have not had any. The first bite of this recipe almost brought me to tears. It taste exactly like Mama's recipe with squash instead of zucchini. Thank you thank you so much for posting this recipe. Mama would have loved it as I do. She used to do the same with the zucchini as with the squash except she would fill the zucchini boat back up with the filling and bake it. FANTASTIC!

If it were solely up to me, I would have given this recipe 5 stars.  I made only a few changes (Doubled the spices and added a little fennel and cracked red pepper as well, and used a mixture of smoked mozzerella/almond cheddar/feta cheeses instead of just cheddar due to allergies), and I absolutely loved it.  It was a very filling, very nourishing and super-yummy meal and I would definitely eat it again!  However, devoted hubby, who will normally eat veggies, was not a fan--so much so that this one will have to be relegated to the "every six months--if that" pile.  Be warned: if you think you're going to fool a spouse into thinking this is pasta, it's not going to happen.  If, however, s/he is already a veggie-fan, s/he'll probably love it!

I try to eat low-carb as much as possible, so I've tried a lot of shaghetti squash recipes.  This is the only shaghetti squash recipe that I really enjoyed as much as pasta!  I'll be making this again and again!

I made a lot of changes to this recipe to make it appealing to my picky eaters(plus wanted to use what was on hand and not run to store).  But I think that's what makes it such a great recipe.  It is easily changed to suit your taste and turned out great.  Since I'm reviewing this recipe, and not my own,  I'm giving it 5 stars based on adaptability. I believe I have the finickiest kids and there was no leftovers! I used italian sausage, yellow onion, skipped peppers and used parmesan cheese instaed of chedder at end.  Turned out great!

This was yummy. I doubled the basil and oregano, and added 1/4 t cayenne. I think next time I might add a liitle hot chicken sausage.
* Bake the squash, it's worth the time you save microwaving (as some have done) in better flavor.

The only change I made was using 1/2 beef and 1/2 sausage.  I thought this was a very heavy meal.  I would cut back on the cheese the next time to try and lighten it or use ground turkey.

We love spaghetti squash and thought this was a tasty dish.  I did use breakfast sausage instead of ground beef, and added  three or four  fresh mushrooms, sliced.  Used half regular cheddar and half low-fat and it was fine.   Remember to drain the can of tomatoes before adding. I would make this again!

Great recipe for a subsitute to high-carb pasta dishes. I added about 6 sliced mushrooms to the veggies and a few shakes of red pepper flakes to the sauce. Also layered (instead of mixing everything together) as follows: small amount of sauce-jsut to cover the bottom, half of the squash, half of the cheese, half remaining sauce, second half of squash, second half of the sauce, second half of the cheese. So super good good!

Hubby loved this! He said it's like hamburger helper. The best thing is that he didn't miss the noodles; not that he was fooled by the spaghetti squash, but it was a good sub. Kinda hard to find though; not available in all Northern Calif. supermarkets.

Huge success in my house! I did substitute ground turkey for the beef and it came out really good. i was a little wary of adding so much cheese but once it came out of the oven, the flavors all mixed together perfectly. Will absolutely make this again!

I was looking for a way to "casserole" spaghetti squash and this was a pretty good base recipe. I'm not the worlds best cook so I use the words "base" with some hesitancy and did so because I had read the previous reviews and saw where many said to increase salt/pepper -- which I did and I also increased the oregano and basil to 1 teaspoon each.  I used Italian Sausage in lieu of ground beef which I think helped bump up the taste.  I used Reduced Fat Mexican Cheese (because that's what I had and was too lazy to go to store) and it still came out pretty tasty...other reviewers suggested cutting the cheese but I didn't and liked the cheesiness of it. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to bake it covered or uncovered so I did uncovered fearing it would probably come out somewhat dry BUT to my surprise it didn't. I LOVED it...had to stop myself from eating half the pan. Definitely adding this to my recipe arsenal.

I had two half peppers in my fridge but one was spoiled and mushy so I could only use one :( This recipe needed a tad more flavor, despite using 10 (yes 10) times as much garlic as specified. But that's easily rectified. A little hot sauce, a little parmesan and WOW. So good. Thanks bye!

It's just a little bland (Possibly because all the seasonings are added right before baking?), but overall this is a refreshing take on casserole. The spaghetti squash is really good in place of a starch. Next time I would fry the onion and garlic from the start and maybe add a little more seasoning, but it's still good eating.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Basically made as stated, however, I doubled the spices. The family loved it. Next time I will try using sausage. I will also try doubling the squash. We are looking to add more veggies to our dinners!

I really disliked this dish! Most everything on allrecipes with this many stars should be great. It had a weird texture and flavor and I had to cover it up by ketchup! It was mushy and everything about it was just not what I wanted! Will never ever make this again!

I was pretty skeptical about this dish, but I made it tonight for dinner and my husband and I were both pleasantly surprised!  This is a great base- I didn't follow the recipe to a t, but it still turned out great!  I only used 1/4 lb ground beef, through in some onions, mushrooms, green peppers and zucchini (we love veggies) and used a bit less cheese then called for.  Definitely a great fall alternative to spaghetti.  I'll definitely be making this again before the fall's over!  Make sure to sprinkle some parm on top :)

We really like this recipe.  We get spaghetti squash every winter from our farm CSA.  Typically we just bake and eat with butter.  This was a good use for this type of squash.  I did not use bell peppers but rather increased the red peppers.

I have made this a number of times and  we think it's wonderful. I'd like to emphasize to those that think this dish is just OK - this is one of the kinds of casseroles that taste even BETTER the next day after the flavours have really melded. I strongly suggest you give it another try.   I have added sliced portobella mushrooms and jalapeno to this for some extra kick. This is an absolute keeper!

This recipe turned us into spaghetti squash lovers.  I received one from a friend's garden and didn't know what to do with it.  Tried this recipe, and yum!  My husband loved it, too, and he was very hesitant to try it.  He said this recipe is a keeper.

I am desperately trying to change my family's eating habits and eat more veggies, and this was a huge hit. No, really, I have an 8 year old meat and potatoes son and a no-veggies husband, and they both loved it!!! I will certainly make it again!! It was also easy to tailor to what you had in the kitchen (more or less veggies, or turkey meat instead of beef).

I thought this recipe was really great.  The spaghetti squash is a nice change from the usual.  I did use shredded chicken, however, and it tasted good, as I'm sure beef would, too.

This is an awesome recipe that you can make so many variations of!
I used diced chicken and added fresh mushroom, doubled the onion and I used Rotel tomatoes for some extra spicy to it.  Both me and my somewhat picky husband LOVED it!  I don't think I'm ever making another noodled caccitore or even spaghetti for that matter.  Next time I'm going to use mexican/taco spices and mexican cheese for a south of the border variation.

Great idea--I often prepare spaghetti squash with meat sauce and vegetables, but I never thought to bake it as a cassorole.  I used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes and sprinkled about a cup of cheese on top (to reduce amount) instead of stirring it in. I also added spicy seasonings and chipotle peppers, per my preference. Don't over-cook squash or it will become mushy...as long as it comes out easily in strands with a fork, its done.

Very yummy. Will make this again. I used 6 cups of squash from a 4.5 pound squash that made 8 cups (so reserved 2 cups for other usage). Overall, a very nice "comfort food" recipe, sort of along the lines of hamburger helper without the pasta. I didn't have italian diced tomatoes, so I just doubled the oregano and basil and added a teaspoon of Italian Seasoning as well. Entire family enjoyed and said it was good.

I made this as a side dish without the meat.  It was delicious.  Sometimes spaghetti squash can be a bit bland.  This really kicked it up and even the vegetables-haters in the family said it was good.

This was one of the best fall recipes I have made yet!  Very colorful and flavorful and it reheated well!  Easy to make, esp. by microwaving the whole squash on high for 7 min per side, rather than baking it... it cut the cooking time down.

Delicious!  Spaghetti squash is my new favorite vegetable, so I am always on the lookout for a new recipe that I can use with it.  This is one of the best I have found so far and I will definitely be making it again! I did not change a thing about the recipe and it turned out perfect!

I make a couple of modifications to this recipe and I love it! I use Jenni-O Italian seasoned turkey instead of beef and I only use about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of cheese (otherwise I think the cheese overwhelms the dish).

Yumness!! My boyfriend won't eat weird vegetables and so I had to find a way to trick him into eating spaghetti squash. This worked! I used chicken instead of beef and made half of it meatless for me. It was great! Also, I only used about 1/3 of the squash so if using a whole squash add more tomatoes!

Very good recipe.  I used only green pepper and I added a jar of marinara sauce to it.  I used 2/3 of the jar in the beef/squash mixture then topped it with the remaining 1/3 of sauce and then finally topped with the remaining cheese.  My whole family enjoyed it, including very picky 4 and 7 year old boys!

This was okay. It wasn't fantastic but it wasn't terrible either. I don't know what else to say, it just wasn't a hit in our house.

Pretty darn good!  I did not use a full lb of ground beef.  But, used a combo of ground beef and pork sausage.  Also, did not add as much cheese - did not need it.  Tastes creamy with lots of flavor.  Sprinkled a little parm. cheese before serving.  I had a HUGE squash - so, used half and froze half so that we can make again this winter.  Num.

Pretty good.  This was the first time I made spaghetti squash and I really enjoyed it.  I thought this preparation actually tasted a bit like stuffed peppers.  I used ground turkey, 1.5 cans of tomatoes, added a little crushed red pepper and also used a mix of cheddar, mozzarella and parmesan (all reduced fat).  I liked it and will probably make it again, but next time I prepare spaghetti squash, I will probably make something where you can really taste the squash and its flavor it overwhelmed in this dish by all the other ingredients.

I really loved this as I am new to using spaghetti squash - couldn't source it when I lived in the UK - what an amazing substitute - I more or less followed the recipe here, except I used fresh tomatoes which I skinned using boiling water and chopped, and I added 1/4 cup of red wine - also excellent idea from the person who suggested using ground turkey for a low fat option I may well try that next time.

Per suggestions by other reviewers, I cooked the squash in the microwave and substituted Italian Seasonings for the various spices.  I used ground venison instead of beef, and added some fresh mushrooms I had on hand.  Delicious and healthy!

Pretty good!  My husband loved it!  It was my first time making spaghetti squash, and I thought it was pretty cool.  My three year old would have eaten more of it if it hadn't been for the tomatoes.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Oh - hint - I cooked the squash about five minutes less, so that it wouldn't be too soft to mix in with everything.

A great alternative to pasta! I am a low carber, and was looking for a way to make spaghetti without cheating. I am so glad I found this recipe! What I did differently after scraping it out was put everthing together like I would make a big pot of spaghetti. This reminds me of angel hair pasta. I now have another superb low carb recipe.

I'm sorry, no hamburger casserole is 5 star dining. This was tasty, a more nutritious hamber helper type meal. I mixed it up early in the day an popped it in the oven. Made for easy dinner time. Taste was good enough, just not a spectacular dish.

I was given some squash by a friend who said it was spaghetti squash. After baking it I knew it was something different (it was butternut) but I put it together anyway. Wow! What a terrific "accident". It was fantastic. The only change I made was to put this on warm tortillas with the extra cheese. My husband added jalepenos and some hot sauce. He says he'd rather have this than tacos anyday. Thanks!

Good recipe.  I used 3/4 lb hot Italian sausage, & 3/4 hamburger.  Added just an extra kick.  I also used crushed tomatos, just because I don't like hot tomato chunks.  Everyone in my house enjoyed.  I also cut down on prep time by putting the squash face down in a little water in the microwave and depending upon the size start with 8 mins or until the squash shreds easily with fork.

This was such a great way to use spaghetti squash.  I added fresh zucchini instead of the peppers because I didn't have any on hand, and also used fresh tomatoes in place of the canned. I also added extra Italian Seasoning and chopped fresh basil.  My husband loved this!  Will make again and again!

My husband absolutely loved this meal!!  It has a wonderful flavour! I had followed other readers suggestion and added two tins of tomatoes....I will not be doing that again, made it way to runny.  I will also add just a bit more ground beef next time as well.  This is now a meal that will be in our regular line up of menu ideas.  Thank you very much Robyn for this great low-carb recipe!!!!

Truly Fantastic! This is an amazing recipe...I followed the instructions exactly, with the addition of chopped celery. My family adored this and my three year old thought she was eating spaggetti! What a way to get the veggies in! Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This was excellent!  I used only green peppers to save $ and still loved it.  I actually recommend staying with the cheddar cheese.  It was a nice contrast to the Italian tomatoes.  I think the mozzarella would have been too expected.

This was so good! As a busy college student, dinner is usually whatever's in the cupboard, but when there's a lull in my schedule I like to take the time to try out new recipes. It's a compliment to this recipe that my very opinionated roommate declared it the best dish I've made this year. And I didn't get sick of it even after eating leftovers for three days straight :) This one's a keeper.

Wowza! This was excellent!! Tastes just like spaghetti casserole!! The only complaint is that I think I could’ve cut the time in half using the microwave to eat up the squash instead of the oven. I added a can of black olives to the mix to beef up the dish. Aside from heating up the squash, I don’t think I’ll change anything the next time. This for sure will be a monthly family meal!

My husband and I were both surprised by how much we actually liked this!  I actually subbed ground turkey for ground beef.  The first time I made this I tried microwaving the squash rather than baking, but we have a small microwave so I had to do each side and it just ended up taking as long as baking.  The squash didn't scoop out as well too.  Baking was much easier!  Next time I'm going to try cutting down on the cheese a bit more.  I also added in some sauteed mushrooms because I had them on hand.  I think you can probably add any veggie you have on hand.

Delicious. I've made this recipes probably around a dozen times now. The ONLY difference I make is cutting the amount of cheese in half. I loooove cheese but it is just way too much.

I made my own version as follows: used 1# bulk italian sausage, no bell peppers (personal preference) added 1 cubed sweet potato and ~ 1 c chopped broccoli.  Instead of canned tomatoes I used a jar of Tomato and Basil pasta sauce and instead of cheddar cheese I used a 6-cheese italian blend.  No spices needed, the pasta sauce had it covered. 
Simply delicious!

Followed baking instructions, but made a few substitutes:  Instead of beef I used 1/2 lb. bratwurst and 1/2 lb. Andouille sausage.  Other substitutes:  1 cup diced poblano pepper instead of bell peppers, 1 cup extra sharp Cheddar cheese, and 1 cup Monterrey Jack cheese.  Sprinkled about 1/2 cup "4 cheese" mix over top after 20 or 25 minutes of baking, and baked another 5 minutes until cheese melted.

This was an amazing dish! I used ground pork and Italian sausage instead of ground beef. I added red, yellow and orange bell pepper, sliced mushrooms, cayenne pepper, chili flakes and increased the amount of spices they called for. The leftovers are even better, the flavors were fabulous, can't wait to make it again!!!!

This was pretty good.  I made spaghetti for my husband and the squash for myself.  He doesn't eat spaghetti squash, I know, I know…I've tried.  So, I made this more like a sauce instead of putting the squash in the mixture.

This was amazing!  I used spicy Italian sausage instead of beef and that really added to the flavor.  My 3 year old son said he didn't like the meal upon looking at it but once he tasted it he said, "Mmm, pasta!"  Thanks for the great recipe.

Loved the idea....tasted good.  Used what I had on hand to make it.  SO ommitted the green peppers and used mushrooms and black olives.  After eating it, my husband and I agreed this version would have done better (still delicious) if stuffed into a green pepper than baked.

My husband is not an easy man to cook for.  He doesn't like anything new and he doesn't like "healthy".  BUT he is a diabetic and I have been trying out new things.  He loved this.  I did make it with Italian Seasoned Ground Turkey and lots of extra vegetables.  I also added a jar of Classico Spaghetti Sauce.  I used reduced fat cheddar.  It was amazing.  LOVED IT.  It will become a staple in our house and I am excited to try other spaghetti squash recipes.  If I could give it 10 stars - I would!

This was very good, much better than I was anticipating. Great way to use spaghetti squash or recipe for a low carb diet. The only thing I varied a bit on was I added mushrooms, extra salt and spices, and I didn't add the cheese to the meat mixture, instead I layered it like a lasagna-spaghetti squash, meat mixture, cheese, repeat.I probably used a little extra cheese as well :). My significant other even liked it(had seconds) and he likes his carbs. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is a good recipe but it did need some tweaking.  It needed more salt (this from a person who only salts fresh veggies).  I think instead of cheddar, a good Parmesan in the recipe and topped with Asiago.  I love cheddar, but for me with the Italian flavors, the cheddar was lost, in spite of the fact that I used Extra Sharp.  My spaghetti squash was very large so I should have put in more onions and peppers.  The seasoning was very on with the Basil and Oregano but I did add a little granulated garlic along with the fresh.  I would make this again but with the changes.

My family really loves this recipe!  It's quick and easy and soooo yummy!  Sometimes I use the sausage, other times I used ground turkey and up the spices a bit.  I never use as much cheese as it says though to cut back on calories a bit.  A staple in my home when I have spaghetti squash!

As an individual trying to stick with a slow carb only lifestyle change, I am trying out new recipes in search of yummy lunch ideas. I pulled this out of the oven about 10 minutes ago and just tried the final results - YUM!!! I think I just found my favorite go-to lunch. I prefer ground sausage in italian dishes so I used that instead of ground beef. I also used about a cup of cheese and will melt some on top tomorrow when I heat it up at work! This is SO SO SO good! Thanks for posting!

All I can say is, "OMG!"  My husband and I ate the entire casserole.  I, too, didn't change anything.  I was out of dried basil and only had stewed tomatoes so I used 2 teas. pesto sauce and a little extra oregano and it worked.  We had a side dish of sliced heirloom tomatoes with reduce balsamic vinegar.  The meal was perfect!

Love it! I go easier on the cheese, and use ground turkey to feel extra healthy. Great way to use the squash. I usually microwave it the day before and then drain it before using, so it doesn't get too watery. I have also tweaked it slightly to make a Mexican version too.

This is now a classic at home. You can replace the cheese by any cheese you have at home and it is just as good. I often use philadelphia cheese. A great way of eating vegetables for kids aswell!

I thought it was healthy meal.  Did add 1/2 cup of sour cream so it had creamier texture.  My hubby never had spaghetti squash before ate it, didn't complain, but didn't have seconds (he always does) Grandkids were not crazy about it either, but ate it.

This was wonderful, except accidentally used a hot pepper instead of a sweet pepper. Some parts were a little spicy. Kids even liked it until thier mouths started to burn from the hot pepper. We cooked the squash in the microwave, and sauted everything else and only put it in the oven for about 30 minutes to allow for melting. Also added a little brown sugar to give it some sweetness.

I thought the taste of this recipe was good, but mine turned out very juicey. I might try using 2 squashes next time and see if that helps. I'd also probably cut the cheese down for health reasons; there's a LOT of cheese in the recipe! I made the recipe exactly as written, save I used faux beef as a vegetarian.

Very tasty!  I did make it with ground turkey and tomatoes from the garden, so I added some extra herbs.  Also, there was no way that this was going to fit in my large skillet, so I separated the recipe.  I cooked the meat and veggies in the skillet first.  Then I cooked the squash and tomatoes.  I mixed it all together before putting it in the oven.  My boyfriend loved it!

This is a super Atkins dish, even for Induction. I modified it with Mexican flavors--added chili powder and cumin to the ground beef--and topped it off with a little sour cream. It tasted like enchiladas. Only 10 grams net carbs per serving, and all from foundation vegetables.

Yummy. The whole family liked it. I didn't have tomatoes so I just used tomato sauce, added extra italian spices. I love that it is full of veggies but has beef & cheese so kids liked it too. It would be great w/ ground turkey or chicken too. Delish!

This was my first time having spaghetti squash, I found it pretty cool how it all just fell apart like noodles.  The recipe was great, I made 2 servings one with ground turkey, and ground beef, possibly next time chicken.  I was short on time so I used the micro and it turned out great.  Very tasty, and good as left overs as well.  Thanks.

I've never tried spaghetti squash before and I'm glad that I did with this recipe.  I tried recipe as is (except used Parmesan mix for cheddar cheese because that's what I had in the fridge).  The next time I make it I will do half ground beef and half Italian sausage.

I chose this recipe because it looked like the squash taste would be minimized (because my husband doesn't like squash). It was pretty good and we both had seconds and plenty for leftovers later.

Oh so creamy and yummy!  Only changes I made was I added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes instead of the Italian style and used about 1 1/4 c. of smokey cheddar cheese. I originally tried this recipe because of its low carb content.  I should also admit I love spaghetti squash.  But this was my husbands 1st time to try spaghetti squash and he really enjoyed it as well.  I think having a meat component changed his view as opposed to a vegetarian dish.

We absolutely loved this dish! I have been looking for a savory way to cook squash and this is it!  My husband, who dislikes squash, LOVED it.  I used acorn squash instead of spaghetti squash, which gave the dish a subtle sweetness...amazing!

I thought this dish was very good.  I took the advice of a prior post and did 1/2 beef and 1/2 sausage to kick up the flavor.  Other then that, followed the recipe and really enjoyed it.

Pretty good. Needs more spices, I added some ginger, and Cayenne pepper, but then I like a bit of a "kick" to my food.  Otherwise, great recipe for Speghetti Squash--and I gotta do something with the near 30 of them I have.

Wow! Great recipe.  I halved & seeded my squash, then cooked in microwave at 13 mins, as previous reviewers suggested.  I also added minced garlic, thinly sliced mushrooms and used 1c boca crumbles (0.5g fat, no cholesterol) and it tasted great.  I bought Del Monte basil, garlic, oregano tomatoes & used the liquid in cooking the boca "meat" instead of adding the extra seasonings.  Nonstick pan using no oils, except a spray of Pam Olive Oil.  In addition, used Ragu No sugar added tomato & basil sauce to keep the mixture from being too dry.  Ate it as-is & sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese.  I also used extra on top of brown rice and both ways were great. This is a great recipe.  Thanks!

Also works well by replacing the ground beef with a package of Ground Round.  The additional of a little chili pepper was a nice flavour addition too; about 1 tsp.

This was my very first try at spaghetti squash, so I used this tastey sounding recipe as a starting point. I honestly deviated a lot. Rather than using the veggies called for, I used 1/2 cup red wine, 1 can of campbell's tomato soup, a whole onion, 1 can of diced tomatoes (italian style). I also used italian blend cheese instead of sharp cheddar. I wish I had used the sharp cheddar, but I didn't have it on hand. It's like a baked spaghetti. I enjoyed the texture of the squash in lieu of the noodles...really pretty amazing to be missing noodles!

This had nice flavour, and was very easy to make. Mine came out of the oven a little watery, but otherwise I'll will be making this again.

This was absolutely delicious!  I made a few changes though.  I just used a jar of Bertolli instead of tomatoes and mozzarella instead of cheddar.  Cooked the squash in the microwave to save time.  It was awesome!

I rated this recipe a 5 based on its amazing flavors. It's a little involved, but worth the effort. It's a great summertime dish, so I would say that you could bypass the oven step completely, so as not to heat up the house. In order to skip the oven step, micro your squash like others have said. Then simmer your sauce for awhile and put everything into the casserole dish while piping hot and let the cheese melt under the sauce. The only things I changed on this recipe, which I think was for the better, was adding 2 oz. of cream cheese to the squash right out of the micro so it melted into it. I also used grilled hamburgers from the day before for the meat which was an amazing blend of flavor, between the smoky meat and sweet cream cheese. REALLY good! Then I just backed down the cheddar on top so as not to have too much fat. I found this recipe because I was trying to salvage that meat into a leftover type dish, and now I'm going to make extra hamburgers every time!

I thought it was excellent although for more taste next time I might use my favourite spaghetti sauce and some salsa instead of the tomatoes.

What a wonderful dish!  We had a very large squash so I doubled all the ingredients (except for the squash).  First I poked a few holes in the squash and cooked it for about 15 min. in the microwave.  That saved quite a bit of time. Then cut it and scooped out and discarded the seeds.  Used bulk sausage for the extra pound of meat as another reviewer suggested.  Instead of cheddar we used colby-jack for the cheese because we aren't really fond of cheddar.  The family couldn't get enough!  Both granddaughters had three helpings and daughter had 2 (as did DH and I).  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I will be making this one again and again! Hugs, Anj

Easy to make.  I am new to cooking/eating Spaghetti Squash, but my co-workers loved it.  My husband was iffy.  I changed out the sharp cheddar cheese though for an Italian Blend, and topped with a Montery/Colby Jack Blend.  My co worker said, "It tastes a lot like pizza, but is good for you!".  What fun!

Submitted by Patti D

This recipe was the best.  The only change I made was to change the cheese to mozzarella and added ricotta cheese in the mixture.  I also used crushed tomatoes instead of the Italian tomatoes(my family likes it a little juicer).

This recipe was perfect!  Have made more and have frozen it for the winter.

Thank you!!

I loved this, but unfortunately my kids did not like the texture of the squash.  I did saute finely chopped onion and mushrooms and added basil, oregano, parsley and some steak seasonings.  I also used velveeta as I had it on hand to use.  I also recommend simmering the beef, sauce and seasonings for an hour if you have time, then add the squash and cheese until melted, then bake which just adds depth to the flavor.

First time for us and spaghetti squash & we loved it!  I made a "pasta" sauce following this recipe, adding more garlic, fresh basil and some red pepper flake.  Poured this over the "spaghetti" and topped with lots of Parmesan.  Tasted just like the real thing!  Will try baking it as a casserole now that we know we like it!

This recipe is outstanding.  We bought a couple of spaghetti squash at the farmer's market and this was an excellent way to use it up.  I realized I didn't have any stewed tomatoes after I had already started to prepare this dish.  In place of them, I added just enough spaghetti sauce to bind it together.  My husband loved it and it's sure to be a new family favorite!  Thanks for this delicious recipe :-)

I changed a couple of things just because that's what I had on hand. I used italian sauage instead of ground beef, and fresh herb replaced dried. I thought it had too much cheese. I would make this again but with less cheese.

I used ground turkey instead of beef, skipped the cheese except for sprinkling a little shredded mozzerella on the top in the last 5 minutes, and I took the suggestion of the mushroom soup and added about a cup of creamy portabello mushroom soup.

I liked this recipe very much.  It's a great alternative to pasta.  I also used the mozz. cheese instead of cheddar. One other thing...I added a second can of diced tomatoes, as I thought it was a little dry with only the one can.

This dish was very tasty and it's great for the South Beach Diet.  I microwaved the squash to save time, but it still turned out OK (although it was my first time making spaghetti squash).  My picky husband loved it too!  Thanks!

Thanks for the recipe Robyn!  Husband and daughter loved it!  I'm going to use the leftovers in stuffed peppers.  The spaghetti squash makes a great replacement for the rice in the pepper filling!  I'm always looking for ways to still be able to eat comfort foods but without the refined flours.  White rice is one we try to avoid.

Pretty good.  I used extra garlic.  I also used non-fat cheese, which I won't do next time because it didn't add much flavour.  I will make again though.

This is a delicous recipe!! I didn't have enough peppers so I used frozen mixed vegetables instead. I also used goat cheese instead of regualar cheddar.  It worked out great!  I'll definitely make this again.

The only change I made was to use mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  It gave it more of an Italian flair.  Very good!

Not a fan. Considering I don't remember ever cooking a spaghetti squash, I didn't know what to expect.  The flavors didn't quite come together - despite adding (more than called for) salt, pepper, spices and garlic. I won't make this exact dish again, but happy to have tried it. Thanks for inspiring me to try spaghetti squash! Will definitely bake another, but next time it will be a side with butter, cinnamon & nutmeg.

This dish was really good. I used chicken instead of beef because that's what I had. I wanted something different than feta in my spaghetti squash and this was it. I put cauliflower and Brussels sprouts in it as well. I didn't use cheese. I cooked everything in a stew pot. My husband really liked it also. It's a keeper. Thank you.

Not really a fan of spaghetti squash but loved it this way.  I substituted the hamburger for hot turkey Italian sausage. It was delicious.  I also left out the cheese and sprinkled Parmesan on top.

Excellent recipe!  I would add seasoning to the meat and veggies to taste.  I also like to add various veggies and even meats for variety.  I just got some beautiful bright orange spaghetti squash  at our farmer's market and cannot wait to see if that is any different.  I especially love the fact that it is versatile so you can perfect it to your own tastes.

My whole family loved it!  I will be making it again. 
I microwaved the squash instead of baking it to save time.
I had to change several things based on what I had on hand:
used leftover taco meat instead of just browned ground beef and it gave the dish a tasty kick,  doubled the green peppers and the onions, added extra salt and pepper,   used crushed tomatoes.   I also added all the cheese to the mix and baked it for 25 minutes uncovered.    It was still delicious!

I reduced the amount of salt in this recipe and found it was quite tasty.  If you need to use as much salt as in the recipe or more, you are accustomed to too much salt in your diet.

DELICIOUS!!  This is the only way my 10 year old will eat spaghetti squash!  I've made this so many times now I can do it in my sleep.  I bake a bunch of spaghetti squash ahead of time and freeze, saves time when making the dish.  I double the meat, use extra onion instead of peppers (just don't like the texture of the pepper in this) and sometimes add corn.  LOVE it!

This was tasty, and easy, since I had most of the ingredients already in the freezer (chopped peppers, onions and squash). I only used 1/2 a squash, since that is the amount I freeze it in, 10 oz of ground beef, and italian seasoning instead of the individual spices. Accidentally used a tablespoon of that instead of a teaspoon. Everything else used the amount listed in the original. Very good, made about 4 servings. Definitely would make it again, kind of has a pizza-y taste. Great "squash hiding" recipe.  In the summer, I would opt for just a large pot to cook it in so I didn't heat up the house with the oven, and then one less dish to wash.

This was amazing.  I have no complaints.  I substituted the ground beef for ground turkey, used a full green pepper, full red pepper and half a sweet onion(my husband doesn't like red onions).   We will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

It turned out fine but I don’t think I will make it again. The clean up wasn’t worth it.  I had to throw away my dish brush and sponge due to all the cheese. And yes, I have one of the sponges that cheese isn’t supposed to stick to.

What a fun change of pace for dinner!  I’ve never cooked or eaten spaghetti squash until trying this recipe out, and it was super easy to make.  The only substitution I made was ground turkey instead of ground beef, as hubby can’t have the beef. The dish was really tasty, filling, yet not as heavy as many casseroles — a great end to a rushed Monday.  Both my hubby *and* my toddler loved it as well!  Will definitely be adding this to my bag of dinner tricks.

Made it per the recipie and it was a little bland for my tastes. There is so much cheddar cheese that it was all I could taste. I added some ranch to the left overs and that helped a ton. It brought out a lot of the spices without overpowering them.

Very good!  I layered it like another reviewer suggested, and added some tomato sauce for moistness.  I added more spices to combat the complaint of blandness reported by many reviewers, adding some red pepper flakes for a slight bit of heat that we love.  My husband really liked this dish, so I'll be making it again!

I doubled the onions and garlic and used tomatoes from our garden. Next time I’d probably cook the peppers & onions first before the meat. It might benefit from some mushrooms too.  My husband liked it but my toddler wasn’t crazy about the squash.

I liked the idea behind this recipe! I had been looking for a way to cook a low carb ground beef meal. Unfortunately, I'm lactose intolerant and had to skip the cheese. After looking at other reviews I decided to add more of the listed spices and also some cayenne pepper.  I think the seasoning was spot on once I did this. I do still feel like it's missing something but maybe what its missing is just the cheese.  I switched out peppers for mushrooms because I'm not a fan of cooked peppers. I would imagine that substituting in sausage would also add a nice flavor.  All in all, I did like this and its something different from what I would normally make. With these changes in mind, I would definitely make it again!

I love how healthy it is however next time I will be adding more seasoning~it was quite bland. During my second time, I just threw everything in the skillet instead of the oven.  Turned out just as well and saved time!

It LOOKED fantastic.  The colors of the red onions, peppers, tomatoes, and cheddar had everyone salivating.  And we ate all of it in one sitting.  BUT, I didn't give 5 stars because it was a little bland.  I ended up adding salsa at the table, and that turned it into a flavorful Mexican dish.  My daughter added ketchup and said it reminded her of a cheeseburger casserole.  I will make it again, but perhaps add marinara in addition to the can of tomatoes.

This recipe is great!  I have made it several times as directed and with my own variations.  I prefer a chicken sausage and adding what ever veggies I have on hand.  It's easy to tweak if you're on a restrictive diet.  I've used ff cottage cheese instead of cheddar and it still turned out good.  If you're not worried about calories or fat then go all in with a good Italian sausage and cheddar cheese.

Really enjoyed the recipe, especially the adaptability of it. I added fresh herbs plus a lot of garlic. Next time, I will make it with angel hair pasta.

Very good. I wouldn’t call it “bland” like others have, but it did need salt. However, I did not add salt when I was cooking it so that should be a moot point. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. I will definitely make this again.

I did tweak it just a bit by adding some fresh sliced mushrooms, a little rosemary, chopped fresh basil, some fresh tomatoes, sliced black olives, a half cup Orrington Farms vegetable broth, mixed cheeses (cheddar, feta, Jack), and about 3/4 cup Lambrusco red wine. The entire family LOVED it!! I had been searching recipes and kind of combined bits of 3 or 4 I found with this one as the base. Will definitely make again, but what I have on hand to play with may be a little different. However, it was apparent that the base recipe is terrific and quite flexible! After dinner blood sugar test showed it  is diabetic OK, though the wine required a trade off.

As I was making this it reminded me of someone who forgot what kind of recipe they were making half way through and totally switched it up.  That being said, I didn't have high hopes for it and added some red pepper flakes and Worcestershire sauce.  It also did turn out to be rather ok.  I will probably make it again.

Great healthy dish! I used a small organic spaghetti squash and added mushroom slices while sautéing the onions & pepper. This came out great!  A little more time consuming for a weeknight meal than I would like but husband and I both loved it and there was enough leftover for one workday lunch later.

This recipe was so delicious! I did a search for ingredients that included ground beef, spaghetti squash, and tomato, and this recipe popped up. 

For the most part, I made it exactly as ordered with a couple minor exceptions and additions. I didn't have any Italian style diced tomatoes on hand. So I substituted regular petite diced tomatoes, and then added a little Italian seasoning to compensate. I didn't have sharp cheddar cheese, and used mild cheddar cheese instead. And I just so happened to have a zucchini that I needed to use up, so I diced that up, and added it in when I added the veggies to the cooked ground beef. 

It turned out amazingly good! Such good comfort food yet still relatively healthy with all the veggies in it! I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the idea!

This is only a temporary rating because I haven't make this yet, mainly because there is no indication in the recipe as to what size casserole dish this takes, nor how many servings there are. I live alone, so I don't really want to make a dish that serves 10 or more people.

This was easy to make and the flavor was good, but the spaghetti squash disappeared into the ground beef. It needs something else for texture or body. It was like eating a scoop of ground beef—rather off-putting. I used the leftovers for taco salad which was tasty.

I made this with ground turkey instead of beef and followed others advice to microwave the squash instead of baking it which worked beautifully. I added extra seasonings and added more cheese. We’ll make it again.

I made this is a stock pot before putting in casserole dish as it’s amazing how much spaghetti squash you get. This is a great recipe and you can add more veggies like spinach, peas and carrots and double the diced tomatoes if you want to expand. We are trying to drop a few pounds so I begrudgingly left out the cheese! It was still delicious and we have lots of leftover to enjoy!

I have made this twice and both my husband and I really enjoyed it. It is quick and easy to make. Nice flavor. PS. I cooked the squash in 1"of water cut side down in the microwave for about 10-15 minutes.  Even quicker then recipe calls for :)

This wasn’t bad; it was just a blander version of spaghetti.

This is my first time with spaghetti squash and I wanted to try something that didn't look hard.
Following this recipe was very simple. I can't believe how well this came out. 
It kinda tastes like a lasagna and my 11 year actually liked it too. 
I'll be hanging out on allrecipes.com a lot more.
Thank you!

Very easy and delicious.  My 7 year old liked the dish but my picky husband was not a fan. He doesn't like spaghetti squash but I was hoping he might actually like it prepared this way. I will just make it for my son and myself in the future.

Straightforward and really tasty! The squash retains a nice crunch, and the dish overall has lots of flavor. A nice way to get a whole load of vegetables in your meal.

I really liked this recipe with some changes. I changed the following things: to prep the spaghetti squash, make deep incisions around the squash where you intend to cut. Microwave the squash for 5-6 min, allow the squash to cool, and then cut along the incisions and it will open much more easily. I basted the squash with olive oil and sprinkled with basil, oregano, salt and baked face down as directed. I used ground turkey instead of beef and cooked the turkey with oregano, basil, and garlic. I added 1 zucchini, salt to taste, and some siracha chili sauce to the casserole. I didn't cook the zucchini in the pan. I let it cook during baking. Really good. Next time I think I will use fresh basil and oregano.

I'm not sure how to rate this. the 3 adults loved it and all had seconds. the kids, ages 2-8, hated it. I gave it 4 stars thinking that adults have better food sense than kids. lol

I made this pretty much as listed though I increased the meat and used 1 lb hamburger and 1 lb pork sausage and seasoned to taste. I also didn't mix the squash in because the 2 year old prefers his foods separated and I didn't want to have to pick the hamburger and veggies out of the squash. So I seasoned the squash w/Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and butter and placed in in the dish, topped it with everything else and baked. 

I always puncture the spaghetti squash with a sharp knife in several spots and microwave until it's soft. Then let it cool a bit and prepare. It's quick and doesn't heat the house up, a real factor in summer where I live.

I used a bag of frozen peppers and onions and ground turkey. It was pretty good but my 7 yr old didn't like the squash. I need to use it more and she'd get used to it. She'd never had it before.

My husband loved this dish and kept going back for more!  Definitely a dish we will be making again.  Pretty quick and easy to make too other than the time to back the squash.  I added a little extra beef and some green onion I had in the fridge.  Delightfully surprised and satisfied with this low carb option!

Ok.  At first I was "if-y" about this but tried it anyway because of the simplicity and convenience of the ingredients.  My finicky kids 17, 13 loved it!!!!!!  They ate 3/4 of the whole recipe's portion and I have never seen them eat this much (for one dish) in all these years complimenting me the whole time!  I, too, loved it!  So did my husband and mom.  Mind you, mom only eats Asian food,  so for her to like this says a lot!  I served it with Hawaiian bread roll ??  Oh, I used fresh Roma tomatoes (4) instead of the canned ones, diced it and slowly sautéed it with the veggies before baking.

I thought this was really good but, it was watery on the bottom of the casserole. I'm not sure why. So, after eating mine I poured out some of the liquid and then left it in the oven for when husband came home. He thought it was dry! Go figure.
I didn't change anything except to add part Italian sausage and part ground beef. I doubled up on the vegetables and the garlic and added a pinch of red pepper flakes. Doubling up on the ingredients I didn't think it was bland at all.
I will definitely make again.

This was great ! Will definitely make again I used mild Italian sausage instead of beef but you really could use just about any meat in this , I added a little hot sauce to heat it up a bit . Next time might try a home made pasta sauce to amp it up a bit more  but good as is

My intro into cooking with spaghetti squash and I'm hooked! This was a good recipe and I will use this as a guide to experiment with other ingredients. Honestly, I just wanted to add some butter and s&p to one half of the baked squash and chow down but I had to resist the urge because I needed to feed the rest of my family, ha!  I followed the recipe as written and these are my two tips for others.... Definitely use a huge skillet or better yet, a Dutch oven!!!  Could use more salt!

This meal was super easy, tasty and healthy! I did bake the squash halves because I think squash tastes better that way. I also used italian seasonings instead of the various separate ones suggested. My personal adds were red pepper flakes to taste and a giant handful of fresh spinach right before mixing and putting in the oven to get some more veggies in there. I used a bit less cheese for the sake of healthiness. Also, I only baked all together for like, 10 minutes, not 25.

I substituted cubed chicken breasts for the pound of beef, and 5 oz. of Parmesan (it was all I had) for the cheddar, but followed the rest of the recipe.  I did not drain the tomatoes (which made it rather juicy-next time I will!  My husband loved it.

We really liked this, although next time I'm going to try doubling the basil and oregano.  I just think it needed a little more seasoning. Thanks so much for a great low-carb and healthy recipe.

I really liked this recipe  the only change I made was to use a yellow onion instead of a red one and about 3/4 of the cheese required. It came out amazing. Kudos to who ever made this!

Great recipe! Made as is except increased the herbs and salt to taste. I used fresh grated Parmesan on top and reduced the cheddar by about a cup. Very good alternative to high carb spaghetti. Thanks!

My first time cooking a spaghetti squash.  This was a delicious recipe. My picky husband loves it. I used turkey ground beef and all green peppers.

My squash was quite large, so I needed to add extra salt and I used a whole can (28 oz. tomatoes).  We ate it over rice and had a salad on the side.  It was very tasty and something that can be done in advance.

I used two whole peppers instead of 1/2 cup of each.  Could not find Italian style tomatoes, so I added a tbsp of italian seasoning to the can of diced tomatoes.

3 out of 4 loved it! And the 4th is pretty picky. I added 2 cans of chopped tomatoes as one was not enough.

I used about a 1/2 tsp. of Italian Seasoning instead of the oregano & basil.  I also added salt.  I used probably about 1 1/2 lb. hamburger, 2 cups of sharp cheddar, 1 can diced tomatoes and topped it with mozzarella cheese.

For the most part I followed the recipe not measuring precisely; organic beef pack 1.3 lbs, half a yellow onion vs 1/4 red, little yellow grilling peppers in place of the green pepper as my pantry allowed.  Regardless, this was a very tasty satisfying meal - so much so leftovers are for dinner again tonight! When I make this in the future I will double up and freeze for busy night meals. Sooo good.

I found it to be pretty bland as it was. I ended up adding extra spices, and simmering the beef with the tomatoes, onions, garlic and peppers for an hour before adding the rest. I also added some beef broth and tomato paste, trying to get a little more flavour happening.  I think this could be adjusted more to make it more flavourful, but as it is, it's only okay. Sorry.

I baked the squash in the oven as directed and shredded the pulp but when added to all the other ingredients it was very mushy.  Perhaps the squash was over-ripe.  The flavor was good but the presentation  was not attractive at all.  I'm not sure I will make this again.

Excellent recipe! I add a small can of tomato paste (this thickens it up so that the casserole is less runny due to the water content of the squash), a half cup of diced zucchini, and another clove of garlic. I also use fresh basil if on hand, and I substitute the tomatoes with a jar of home canned spaghetti sauce. I start with a bigger pan than what I normally use to fry a pound of beef. I learned the fourth time around to not overcook  the squash prior to combining it all. Don't risk it getting soggy so quickly. Use a paper towel in the empty side of the dish after the meal to absorb any moisture. This will help to keep the leftovers from getting soggy. We make this dish several times a year.

I mixed the sausage and ground beef  50/50. Peppers and onions were whole and I added one jalapeno pepper. It is not only low carb but very healthy.

Would make again. The squash maybe needs some extra cooking time, and with the venison breakfast sausage it wasn't bland at all.

I made some alterations based on reviews. Used ground turkey, 4 garlic cloves,  way more of the spices and a sprinkle cayenne. I wish I had drained the meat as directed and used some tomato sauce.  Solid recipe though. Will def tweak and make again.

Very good dish! I used half lb ground beef and half lb Italian sausage (out of the casings); and used only 1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese. Also used 1tbsp fresh basil, instead of dried. It was a hit!

I loved this.  My husband wasn't a fan of the "mushy" texture of the squash, however.   I  used mild Italian sausage; next time I might use spicy sausage.  Also, in place of the basil and oregano, I used Club House brand Italian blend, I'd estimate about 2 tbsp.  This blend includes salt.

This was excellent!  I have always made spaghetti squash in different capacities and it's always.. "Ok" and I eat it because it's healthy and low in carbs.  Now that I have made this...it will be my go to for this squash!   I did see that some said it was bland and used a red sweet pepper and a Hungarian hot pepper in the mix.  Made it sweet yet spicy.  I also put an Italian mix of cheese on the top and baked it and then broiled it for that yummy cheese topping.  Will definitely keep and make as one of my favorites!

I'm giving 4 stars based on the original recipe. It was a little bland. I did read some of the other reviews prior to completing the dish, so after I tasted the original dish prior to putting it in the oven, I did make some changes:

Made it with what I had on hand so I left out the peppers and tomatoes. It is a great way to use up leftover spaghetti squash that no one wanted to eat. I doubled all the spices.  My husband and I loved it but it gets only 4 stars because the kids wouldn't eat it.  We'll try again!

Just a note: you can microwave the squash for 10-15 minutes after poking some holes in it instead of baking it and you don't even have to cut it in half. 
I liked this recipe, and even though I didn't have any canned tomatoes, I used 3 small fresh tomatoes and it turned out to be just the right amount of liquid. Very good!

My husband and I loved this dish.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  I used a whole green and red pepper.  I only had plain diced tomatoes, so I added a little extra basil and oregano to the recipe.  It was delicious.  I'll make this one again.

This is a very good starting recipe, I smoked the squash and I used tomatoes and jalapenos didn't use meat and it turned out amazing!!!!!  I bet it would be even better with the meat.  This is a keeper!!!!

Made this exactly as the recipe says and it was absolutely fabulous! Probably in my top five favorite recipes from this app! And I told my kids it was spaghetti casserole so they love it too!

i have to be honest, i expected this to turn out a little bland , or something.. boy was i wrong! i only made two changes, i added a whole yellow onion , since we love onions here, and also added some cayenne pepper , since we like things spicy. this dish is incredible !

What a hearty dish! The whole family enjoyed it. Flavorful and filling. I doubled the recipe for two casseroles and followed directions to a 'T'. Highly recommend cheese bread to accompany the meal.

Very delicious!!! Definitely will make again! Super healthy and flavorful.  I didn't have red peppers so added extra green ones. Also, I had only yellow onions. I added bacon which added an even better taste!!! To save time, I cooked the squash in the microwave upside down in water for 10 minutes. Thank you for sharing!!

Made the recipe as is, except I added a link of hot Italian sausage I had lying around and doubled the tomato sauce.  This turned out excellent and could almost pass for a spaghetti sauce by itself.

This was surprisingly good!  The only change I made, and I think it's a great idea if your feeding this to kids, is I used a yellow & orange pepper, instead of green.  I did it because that's what I had, but realized after that my kids couldn't tell the difference between the cheese & peppers & squash.  If there were green peppers in there, it might have been a different story LOL.

I left out the cheese and added a second can of tomatoes and two tsp. of Penzey's pizza seasoning in place of the basil and oregano.  

I baked it at 400 for 30 minutes. 

It turned out fantastic and was very tasty.

Thanks for the recipe.

The healthiest casserole I've prepared to date! I really liked this recipe. I substituted the beef with ground venison, added a little tomato past, a dash of cayenne pepper, and mixed it together in a large pot before transferring to my casserole dish. It is a delicious, family friendly dish with lots of vegetables. :-)

I love it! I also have used the sausage instead of the ground beef...yum! I also cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, then microwave it cut side down with about 1/2 cup of water for about 15-20 minutes(depends on the size of the squash). So good! I've made this so many times and each time I change it up just a bit! It comes out great everytime! Thanks so much!

Made this tonight for my son at his house.  It was wonderful.  He didn't have Italian-style tomatoes so added regular stewed tomatoes and Italian seasoning.  I would also add a little salt and pepper.  Turned out delicious.  I will defiantly make this again at my house.

5 plus stars... everyone loved it!  I've been begged for the recipe.   I did add about 4 - 6 oz. of angle hair pasta and I layered it.  Squash bottom, pasta, sauce, cheese - repeat.
I also cut the squash in 1" strands width wise, versus length wise, because that yields a longer strand.  In addition, I salt each squash ring liberally on both sides and place on a cooling rack on top of the baking sheet. After 20 minutes, I wiped away the water and most of the salt, and roasted as normal.
Not sure if that extra step really helped...but OMG was it good!  Also for those who didn't think it was seasoned well enough... learn to season to taste.  Many taste buds are different...I never follow the seasoning amounts, only the spices to use and I adjust to taste of my family! Thank you for the recipe - it's not only a staple now, but it's been shared!

Made it with Chicken sausage instead of Ground Beef. Bought organic chicken and apple sausages. Slit them down the middle then broiled them for 10 minutes.  Cut into small bites and added  to squash mix  for baking.  Delicious.  Next time I made add some cabbage into the mix..

Made according to posted directions.  Results were excellent. Think garlic toast with spaghetti  sauce. I can imagine using turkey Italian sausage and even making it more Tex-mex.

I had some spaghetti squash to use so this recipe accomplished just that. Upon first reading the recipe, I knew it would be too bland for our tastes, so I seasoned the ground beef very well with garlic powder, pepper, seasoning salt & a decent amount of chilli pepper. Also added a can of tomato soup & 1/3 c of sugar. I omitted the peppers & added celery & sautéed zucchini instead. It had a very nice flavour, however, I'm not sure if I would make it again as it was a bit labor intensive for what I considered a metriocre dish. If you're a squash fan you might really enjoy it... Family still liked it. We had it with basmati rice & buttered french bread.

I'm always looking for good low-carb dishes.  This one was excellent.  My husband, who tends to steer away from veggies altogether, really liked it too.  It was also an easy dish to prepare.  I will, definitely, be baking this again.

really good. Followed recipe exactly though added a little extra salt.  Took a little longer to bake the squash- more like an hour.  To keep squash from drying out rub the inside cavity with some olive oil and bake with the cut side down.

I used all the ingredients as stated but eyeballed the measurements since I was only using half a spaghetti squash. I also just cut the squash in half and popped it in the microwave to speed up this process. It came out delish. I might have added a bit too much cheese but is there ever such a thing :) The cheese totally turned this into a unhealthy dish but still taste great.

The squash used was a very large one and I'm thinking it may have overpowered the other ingredients.  It was good and I ate it but it needed more flavor.  If made again I'll use more salt and spices, onions and garlic and will use a smaller squash.  Thanks Robyn.

This was delicious and even my adult kids who don't like "weird" stuff liked it. I added a little bit of spaghetti sauce to the mixture, not too much, just enough to make it a little more spaghetti-y.  It had too much cheese for my taste--next time I'll use reduced-fat cheese and use at least a half cup less.  I'll also saute the veggies on their own before mixing in with the beef.  Overall, great concept and I'll make it again.

Overall this was easy even if it was a longer cooking/ non-prep time in total. My husband said it was one of the better squash recipes I've made.  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 was because my kids didn't like it much.  For them I might make the peppers even tinier to disguise them.

I thought this was really good.  My family, however, was not impressed.  My husband did not like the fact that I was passing off squash as spaghetti (he's a real meat and potatoes kind of guy) and my kids thought there was too much hamburger.  I didn't tell them it was squash but they did ask me what kind of spaghetti it was.  I could tell that they weren't sure what to do because they really like spaghetti and I TOLD them it was spaghetti, lol. I followed the recipe for the meat (swapping green pepper for red) but when I saw the massive amount of meat, I put half of it in a container to freeze and just used half the amount called for.  It was STILL too meaty for my family.  I used Italian diced tomatoes but I threw them in the food processor to pulse the chunks out.  I also thought the addition of the cheddar cheese was strange given that the rest of the flavors were so Italian, so I swapped the cheddar for mozzarella and parmesan.  I honestly really liked the beef and tomato topping, I think it would make a good spaghetti sauce on its own or topping other vegetables like zucchini or stuffed peppers.  I did follow another reviewer's advice and squeezed some water out of my cooked squash before using it in the casserole and it was still a little wet, but nothing that a little wadded up paper towel couldn't handle.  I have a bunch of great leftovers for my lunch but I probably won't make this again due to the reception my family gave it.

This is a really yummy great recipe and was my first time cooking spaghetti squash.  I made it as written minus the red onion.  I think it would still be good with less cheese than called for, I may try that next time in order to cut out a few more calories.  I also would probably salt and pepper the squash before roasting it to add a little extra seasoning.

This is a terrific dish. Very flavorful. I season to taste, not by the recipe however.  I will make this again. Next time I might try adding Italian sausage and instead of adding the squash before baking, I will serve it over the squash to give it more texture.

I was looking for a recipe to help clean out my fridge and this fit the bill.  I used half the meat and cheese and double the spices and veggies plus some.  I also strained the squash after removing from shell and added a couple T tomato paste to the sauce to reduce the watery factor this type of veggie is known for

Best spaghetti squash recipe I've eaten so far. I do usually end up sprinkling more salt on it once it's on my plate, so it might need more salt in recipe, but other than that... I really like this recipe.

I did make it a little different, using some homemade wild pig sausage and some ground venison, a yellow onion instead of a red one, because I had yellow. I added some celery. I didn't add the tomatoes because my husband isn't a tomato fan. Next time I will make it in 2 small casseroles so I can freeze 1. I will probably add the tomatoes also. my husband went back for seconds, he only does that if he really likes something. I will be making it again.

Is a great dish and really filling. My 8 year old had no idea there were so many veggies in it :) To make it easier I used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of the tomatoes & seasoning.

So good! My kids (7&9) ate seconds. To make it SCD I used two fresh tomatoes diced instead of canned. No extra liquid needed. I also added some kale. You can start cooking the beef and other vegetables while the squash is cooking. This decreases the time it takes to make.

This recipe is a keeper! I purchased a spaghetti squash and needed a top notch recipe for it's debut in my household. This recipe is similar to a spaghetti bake that I make so I chose it. My daughter ate it and she's very picky about her food.

I don't eat meat or dairy but I have been looking for a good spaghetti squash recipe.  I used the full peppers and omitted the cheese and meat and it came out delicious.  Usually when key ingredients are left out the recipe isn't that good but it wasn't the case with this!

I substituted the beef for ground bison and this was absolutely delicious.  My boyfriend absolutely loved it and he does not like eating healthy foods at all.  I would make this and eat it again and again!  It would probably be great with ground turkey as well.

This recipe is amazing. I followed the recipe and I added chicken sausage and ground turkey and omitted the beef, I also added fresh mushrooms, mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese and a dash of sugar to the spaghetti sauce. and I added 3 tablespoons of pesto. the pan was empty!

While we made some substitutions and additions (more of the spices, for one), this is a GREAT recipe.  It reheats well, and like many dishes, it actually tastes better after it has been refrigerated and the flavors meld.  I hardly follow any recipe to the letter, so this was no exception.  I think it would be awesome in any number of slight variations, with possibly Italian sausage and some mini pepperonis, ground turkey (which we used), perhaps some Kalamata olives, etc.  This is a keeper and a wonderful surprise!

This was my first time using spaghetti squash, and it was so good!  I was honestly hesitant to try the recipe, but the whole family loved it (including a picky 4 year-old and 8 year-old). This will be going in the rotation!  I used sausage with reduced fat sharp cheddar and reduced the cheese amt to 1 1/4 cups (1 cup in the mix and 1/4 cup on top) and it was perfect. My little one even requested the leftovers for lunch the next day!

This is a very good recipe!  I had gastric bypass and finding delicious recipes that still fit in our guidelines can be difficult, but this is a hit!  It's very good, and can easily be modified to make it even healthier.

Made it for dinner tonight after seeing the recipe in the magazine. It's absolutely delicious! I cut the prep time by cooking it for 8 minutes in an electric pressure cooker and using the quick release.

Kind of disappointing.  It would probably be better as the recipe states- with all that cheese.  I cooked it with cheese sprinkled on half so I could keep my calories low.  2 stars for me with no cheese and 3 stars from the rest of the family with the cheese.

This was so good!  At first I was sure about the spaghetti squash.  I'm not a fan of squash and I've never had this.  The more I ate, the more I loved it!  We didn't have a green pepper or "Italian" diced tomatoes.  I took others' advice and increased the oregano and basil.  I will definitely make this again!

This was really good! Instead of the tomatoes (and herbs), I threw in a jar of medium salsa (and used less cheese).  The salsa made the dish very flavourful and I will make it again.  I served it with rice and it was delicious!

This was Wonderful!  I did have to make a few adjustments but nothing that really changed the taste.  I didn't have Italian Tomatoes, so I doubled the basil and oregano and added 1/4tsp of marjoram.  I also didn't have any peppers so I added a good amount of my McCormicks roasted Garlic & Bell Pepper seasoning blend and because of this garlic I left out the minced garlic. I didn't have any ground beef but that's because I usually use venison if I have it instead, worked well. These changes are really just substitutions and I thought I'd share in case someone else had the same problems.  My daughter and I really loved it!

The flavor was excellent but the texture was off.  I doubled the garlic, used fresh herbs & more salt. But the spaghetti squash just disappeared in the sauce and did not maintain any texture.  This was my first time preparing spaghetti squash and I did the oven method as written.  So, my only conclusion was I over cooked the squash.  My plan for this batch ironically enough is to serve it over pasta :-).  Will try again but will decrease the cooking time on the squash.

Will make this again. Instead of beef I used cubed chicken cooked in olive oil, also used a package of blended shredded cheeses, and crushed tomatoes instead of diced (family doesn't like chunks!).  Added a dash of red pepper flakes to heighten the flavor. It was awesome.

We made some changes and loved it. We used a huge acorn squash instead of the spaghetti squash.  Substituted a mix of mild cheddar, mozz/prov. mix, and asiago cheeses.  also added Cayenne and cumin and a little oregano.  Used about 6 or more cloves of garlic and 2 cans (instead of 1) of the Italian diced tomatoes.  Also sprinkled bread crumbs on the top.

This was really good but I added feta cheese in place of cheddar.  It gave it more zip.  I also used canned venison that I had on hand along with fresh spinach.  Yum!

my husband loves casseroles, but I rarely make them because of the high carbs and calories from pasta and sauses.  This one, the other hand, was amazing.  I did tweet it a  little by substituting "Rotel" tomatoes for the italian tomatoes.  This gave it  a little kick....  It did the trick!!!

Best squash recipe!  I used 20oz of ground turkey and then doubled spices and added most of a can of tomato paste.  Will definitely make again!

Wow! This is amazing. I have never cooked spaghetti squash, and this was a huge success. It reminded me of pasta, but was better. I will make this a regular in our house. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used Italian Sausage instead of beef, omitted peppers (they don't agree w/ me) and substituted 2 small-med chopped zuchinni, and blended the diced tomatoes (kids won't eat the chunks).  Was very yummy.  Making it agian tonight for supper (tried it about 4 weeks ago).

This recipe is wonderful! I do agree with other reviewers who have said that it is a bit bland as it is, but that also gives lots of opportunity for tweaking and flavour changing based on preferences/mood.

Here are my suggestions for changes:

- I tried using a bag of mixed frozen veggies (onion, tomato, zucchini, green/red pepper, and eggplant), and it turned out great. I just made sure to cook down some of the liquid before adding to the casserole. The combo of squash with eggplant and zucchini was a bit unusual, but I liked it.

- A good dose of salt is absolutely recommended unless using sausage. There's really no other salt coming from the ingredients except cheese, so I'd suggest being pretty liberal since it's for a fairly large volume of ingredients.

- Lots of chopped garlic...I added probably almost 2 tbsp and didn't even notice it

- Chili powder and siracha add great flavour; I'm not a heat freak by any means, and I found myself adding even more after the fact

10/11/14 - Made this again using Johnsonville Italian Sausage as well as fresh herbs and it was delicious! 5 stars! Thank you for sharing. Previous review: This is very good. Next time I will use fresh herbs. I think that is what was missing. Delicious leftover as well.

If my husband would eat peppers, I think this would be a great recipe. But without them, it was just kind of bland. I probably won't make it again unless I can do it with the peppers included.

I made this last night, it is a very forgiving recipe.  I used mild italian sausage and didn't measure any of the spices, I just put them in based on our personal preferences.  My family loves garlic and onion so I'm sure I added more than the recipe called for.  I also used two cans of the diced tomatoes.  I will definately be making this again!

My preferred method of cooking spaghetti squash is to cut it in half, remove the seeds, and bake for about 25 to 30 minutes, so that is what I did.   I did not have Italian-style diced tomatoes so I used regular diced tomatoes and ramped up the garlic and the dried spices a bit.  Always looking for a way to make a dish as healthy as possible I only used a total of 1 ½ cups shredded aged cheddar cheese.  I mixed in one cup of the cheese before baking and sprinkled about a half cup of the cheese on top for the final five minutes.  My hubby and I both enjoyed this very much.  It is not gourmet by any standards but it is good and healthy comfort food and visually very appealing.

Love this recipe. I make it with low-fat mozarella to save on calories sometimes, and my family loves it, too! I tried it with a little hot sauce as a change-up as leftovers! Wow! That was good as well! I have made this recipe too many times to count, and I keep finding more ways to make it a little different every other time.

This is pretty good, though it did need more salt than the recipe listed (1/2 tsp plus liberal hand when eating). I also had a LARGE spaghetti squash so perhaps that made a difference. I used a can of regular diced tomatoes, but otherwise kept pretty close to the recipe. I microwaved the squash for almost 20 minutes but it was still pretty "al dente". Again -- large spaghetti squash -- will try and bake next time.

This recipe is the perfect mix of my father-in-law's dead cows and my garden!  I only had to buy cheese, garlic, onion and red pepper.  I used fresh basil and oregano, and fresh tomatoes (scalded off the skins and drained the juices).  The kids even ate this! Guten appetit!

Great recipe!  I had cooked a spaghetti squash a few nights before and needed something to do with the leftovers.  I found this recipe, was super skeptical but tried it anyway.  It was fantastic!  I used turkey meat instead of red meat and used only 1 3/4 cups of low fat cheddar cheese.  I sprinkled some bread crumbs on the top before baking and zapped it with the broiler right at the end.  It was fantastic!  Highly recommended!

Very tasty and its a good way to use up a spaghetti squash you have no idea of how to use. The only change I made to this was to use four cups of cheese: 2 1/4 in the casserole, and the rest on top during the last 5 minutes of cooking.

This was so good. I used ground turkey instead of beef and although the recipe did not state, I definitely seasoned the meat. I also added more herb seasoning...dill, thyme, etc. prior to putting it in the oven to bake. This was good and I will make it again. Maybe I'll add capers. Yum!

We've made this several times this summer and I can't believe how much my picky kids like it!  I've never eaten spaghetti squash before, but we've gotten several through our CSA this summer.  The kids really like it and it's much healthier than regular spaghetti.  I've made it with ground turkey most of the time and I've used both canned tomatoes and fresh tomatoes. Always a hit.

Delish. Didn't have red bells, so used extra green ones. Didn't have Italian tomatoes, so I just added extra herbs. Used fresh oregano and basil from the garden. Didn't have enough cheddar, so had to use the blends I had; it would've been better with all sharp cheddar. Even so, it was delightful. Subbing ground turkey or veggie-meat and using lower fat cheese would be good, too.

AMAZING! It was yummy in a "comfort-food" kind of way, but no carbs, which I love!!! It was seasoned perfectly, and my veggie-disliking hubby even liked it. The only thing was that the squash noodles were a little crunchy, which was probably my fault. I'll cook them more next time.

What a delicious way to eat your veggies! I used a very lean ground beef, one whole red pepper and no green pepper. It was wonderful! As another reviewer noted, the leftovers are even better! I will be making this one again, thanks for sharing such a healthy and yummy recipe.

This is a very good recipe using spaghetti squash.  For a main dish double the amount of ground beef and veggies, add more garlic and cheese.  I will definitely  put this in my file as a "go to" healthy recipe that tasted very good

Quite tasty - I opted to use medium cheddar instead of sharp.  Next time I would increase the spice load - I would have liked a little more zip!

This is very good, and an excellent way to get my 2 year old full of veggies. I did use a frozen pepper and onion blend, and zapped the spaghetti squash in the microwave. I also added zucchini. I decided not to bake it as a casserole (we were tired and hungry). I simply sprinkled cheese over the individual servings and we were good to go. This reheated very well for lunch today also.

First recipe I have ever tried with spaghetti squash, and it was delicious! I used the microwave suggestion of another reviewer to save time, worked perfectly... microwaved the cut squash in a bit of water pulp side down for 10 min. Then follewd the recipe as written. I will definitely be making this again!

This was pretty good! I took one reviewer's advice and took the squash out 5 minutes early. Not the best idea. It turned out a little crunchy. I would definitely leave it in for the full amount of time. Instead of the tomatoes I put in prego sauce in half of it. My husband liked the tomatoes better (it had a more italiano feel), but I liked the prego better.

The flavor was good, but I ended up with too much liquid at the end. Maybe next time I will drain the tomatos. I also added a squeeze of tomato paste to the mix for a bit more tomato flavor. Other than that this was good, No need to change the recipe.

I really liked this recipe and already made it again. My husband really likes it.  I always hated spaghetti squash as  a kid and haven't tried it since, so now I know we'll be having this more often. I made a couple modifications to make it easier- the first was to bake the spaghetti squash in the microwave.  The 2nd time I made it I put everything back in the empty squash shells and baked it right in the shells. I've also added carrot to it (just shredded or sliced with the peeler)- hoping to add more things for the kids, but they wouldn't really try it. More for the adults!

Tasty and healthy is a great combo for me! I might be using spaghetti squash instead of pasta sometimes because it is low carb and adds way more vitamins.

This is awesome! Because I didn't have fresh veggies on hand, I used an entire 1 lb. bag of frozen red, yellow and green peppers. I added 1 small yellow onion, I had no red. I used 1 lb. of ground turkey. Next time I'll use ground beef which I'm sure is even better! Thanks for this recipe!

This was good but not great. It was definitely missing something. I won't be making this again, but if I did, I would probably use more vegetables like zucchini and maybe some carrots. I would also add more cheese and salt and use less beef.

I was pleasantly surprised with the results of this recipe.  I wanted to try spaghetti squash and this was a great way to use it.  As another review recommended, I put the squash in the microwave (cut side down in a quarter inch of water) for about thirteen minutes.  I added a little extra cheese and would put in additional seasonings if I were to make it again.

Made this fairly close to the recipe. Husband is still raving about it a week later. Will be making again and maybe per the recipe next time. I don't think I can make it exactly as the first time!

This was great! I had never made Spaghetti Squash before so it was quite the adventure!  A great light alternative to noodles and as versitile as speghetti, well might not work so great with alfredo!!! Can't wait to add more veggies! Oh, Definatly season to taste, I used a ton of garlic and tossed in some curry powder and extra cayanne pepper. Yummy!

Wonderful dish.  It's never going to be pasta but it's a nice lighter alternative. This is a very forgiving recipe you like to experiment with your own sauce versions.

Delicious! Only minor changes to accomodate what I had on hand... no peppers, so I used a can of diced chilis. Also added a can of mushrooms and some chopped celery I needed to use up. Make sure you season it to your taste... I found I needed more garlic and pepper than called for. So good!

Everyone liked this.  Its good.  It is a little bit on the sweet side, which is a little odd with the cheese...and you couldn't eat it everyday.  Its too much.  But, we have way too many spag. squash, and are making every recipe we can find, and this is one of the better ones.

Wow!  Wonderful dish.  Did some tweaking to work with what I had in the house.  We used 1 pound of venison and 1 pound of mild Italian sausage and doubled the tomatoes.  I also added mushrooms and some chopped zucchini.  We will definitely make this one again!

We really enjoyed this dish. It was a creative way in using the squash. We'll be making this again. I would, however, use 2 pounds of ground beef next time.

To my surprise this was excellent.  I had low expectations when I put it in the oven and even left out a little of the squash thinking I had to much and it wouldn't be flavorful.  Oops!  I was wrong.  My husband didn't even tell me this would be better with sausage like he does with any recipe I use ground beef in.

I microwaved the spaghetti squash, as one of the reviewers did, and it turned out well.  Be sure to cook the vegies enough - I made the recipe the first time and it was a big hit. I added celery and mushrooms.  Someone else here at home made it a couple weeks later, and the garlic wasn't cooked enough, nor was the celery we added.  A little too crunchy.  So, use a big enough pan and cook everything you add.

This recipe was good. It had a nice fresh flavor. I added mushrooms and doubled the onions. Next time I might try it with sausage. I will make this again. Thanks.

Delicious! I mixed in can of corn and two slices of wheat bread that I tore into pea-sized pieces before baking. I just put a light layer of cheese on top instead of mixing it in. My love finished this off the same night I made it!

This was very hearty and tasty. I did use mozerella as others had suggested. And the squash I used was a 5 pounder. Just used all green bell pepper. Thank you!
