I make a recipe very similar to this one, but instead of taking the time to wrap them into phyllo triangles, I buy the pre-made phyllo tartlet shells.  Then I simply fill them with the brie and the sherry-sauteed mushrooms and bake them for 5 minutes.  So easy and very yummy!

These were delicious! I made them for our Christmas party & they were the first things gone - and the garlic makes them so tasty, I don't know how anyone could rate them as bland! Instead of cloves of garlic, I used the fresh crushed garlic from the local grocer. I tried them the wrapped way & it was a bit time consuming, so the second batch I simply cut the phyllo into squares & put them in small muffin tins, put in the cheese & topped with the mushroom/garlic mixture. If your squares are big enough, you can still pinch the tops together, but even the ones we left open were beautiful & just as tasty. Will definitely make again and again!

So, basically I'm lazy and instead of hassling with the phyllo I used frozen puff pastry sheets. I rolled them out a little bit flatter than they come originally and with a pizza cutter made small 3" squares. I put a small cube of brie (after freezing for about 20 minutes and cutting off the rind)onto the square, 1/2 teaspoon of the mushroom mix and sealed the triangle. I made them yesterday, froze them and put them in ziplock bags for my party next week. I baked a couple to test them and they're super yummie. I was afraid the garlic would be a bit much but it's perfect. Thanks for this recipe!

I personally do not eat mushrooms, but I made these for Christmas Eve and they were gone in minutes.  There were some changes though.  I used white mushrooms, sauteed them with onions, garlic and sherry.  This recipe would have been much too bland if it had been prepared according to directions.

I made these once and didn't like the work that went into them so I bought the phyllo cups instead.  I also added itallian sausage and instead of brie i used an itallian 5 cheese blend and melted it over the top.  They were gone in seconds and everyone wanted the recipe.

I LOVED this.  My boyfriend's is in the hospital, so I made these for him (and me!).  It was my attempt to impress the two men were staying in the same hospital room and their very Turkish and Greek families (with the typical grandmas who cook huge amounts of food for everyone), but we greedily finished them in the other room because they were so good we didn't want to share!  :)  I used sliced gouda cheese (one half slice on the bottom of the mushroom and one half on top) and regular button mushrooms because the shop was closed on Sunday, but they were still amazingly tasty.  Be sure you roll or fold them tightly or else they 'leak' cheese and it gets hard on the baking tray.  Mine took about 30 minutes in the oven and I forgot to turn them over but didn't notice at all until I re-read the recipe just now.  :P  I've never flipped byrek and it's always been fine.  I used pre-cut triangle-shaped phyllo dough and it worked well- a different shape, but still tasted the same.  Just a little more awkward to butter since I was taught in Albania never to let two pieces of dry phyllo dough touch each other.  :)  I'll certainly try this again with other vegetables and cheese as a way to use up leftover veg and the huge amount of phyllo dough that you get in one pack!  :)

Very tasty! I added a tad of sherry to the mushrooms. If I were to make this again, I would definitely opt for puff pastry or the phyllo shells since the wrapping was very time consuming.

I used the premade phyllo cups like a few others suggested. I also added sherry to the cooking mushrooms. This was fantastic. My husband is not a fan of brie and he really loved these.

I'm all for less-than-healthful indulgences, but I did not care for this recipe.  I love mushrooms, brie and phyllo dough, but these were just a buttery mess.  The cheese "disappeared" and turned into liquid fat, coupled with all the butter from the dough.  You picked one up and you had butter drizzling down your hand!  Couldn't taste the really anything but the butter.  Of 4 of us who tried them, no one was a fan.  My first flop on a highly rated recipe here.

This was the first time I ever worked with phyllo dough. It was a little difficult until I got the hang of it. This recipe made the extra work involved worth it! They had a very rich and wonderful taste.

These are delicious.  I think using phyllo is worth it but only if you're comfortable working with phyllo and have the time.  I used more brie in each than called for and I cut the stack of phyllo in half rather than into thirds just to make it easier to fold without the filling coming out.  I also recommend 20 minutes at 350 - mine were a little darker than I would have liked.  I will definitely use this recipe as a base for other variations in the future...brie + mango, or maybe as is + fresh tarragon...

Fabulous! And it was even better a day or two later. I added my leftovers to pasta-which too turned out to be a nice side dish.

I sauted mushrooms in garlic and butter. As others suggested, cut puff pastry into squares and placed in muffin tins. Bottom layer was garlic heb feta cheese, then topped with mushrooms, cooked for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees. The bottom of puff pastry was a little soggy, I will try phyllo dough next time. The feta cheese added a lot of flavor.

I'm not sure what these tast like becuase I couldn't make them!  I had no idea that phyllo dough was such a pain in the neck.  Definitely make these if you have lots of time and don't make them for a party unless you've practiced a couple of times.

I added just a TB of red wine while cooking the mushrooms and garlic, otherwise followed the recipe. They turned out good, not great. The only thing I could taste at first was butter. I will make again but use half the butter in mushrooms and half the amount on the phyllo. I used the sheets, and started using 3 layers (instead of 2) half way through. The 3 layer phyllo turned out better, you could taste the brie and mushrooms better. Thank you for sharing a great recipe!

This was very difficult to make, not because of the complexity of the ingredients, but because it took so long (longer than the time it said) to make these Phyllo Puffs. As I was making them, I swore that I would never do it again, but once I brought them with me to the party that I was going to, they got rave reviews!

I wouldn't choose to make these again, but if someone asks me to, and I can get a little help in the kitchen, I would...

Extremely tasty, extremely time consuming.

These were a big hit at my mom's Christmas party. It was my first time working with filo and it was falling apart but I found that it's very forgiving, the shape doesn't have to be perfect to look good. The filling was delicious!

The only thing I changed was adding some sherry to the mushroom mixture. With out this I think they would have been rather bland. They had a very nice presentation, but not super flavorful.

These were absolutely delicious! I have never worked with phyllo before, so that was a bit of a challenge. I didn't wrap the appetizers as directed, instead I placed the mushroom mixture and brie in the center of a square of phyllo, then brouth it together at the top and pinched closed. But they turned out great. Time consuming, as was expected, but worth the effort.

tasty but have to be careful not to fill them up too much or else all the filling just pops right out. Phyllo was also difficult to deal with.

I went for the adventure with the Phyllo dough and it really wasn't that difficult to use. They do tear very easily but if you are careful it works out just fine. I did think they had to much butter on them so next batch I will only put butter on the last fold. I had made some spinach balls earlier in the day and made some with the spinach ball filling along with the brie cheese and they were wonderful as well. Will definitely make again and now I am excited about all the  wonderful things to try with phyllo dough.

Hmm... I made these to the letter (as best I could :) and was only slightly disappointed. Tasty, but every bite I took needed a little something more. Next time I will add more filling, or maybe spinach or a stronger cheese.

I had an issue with the Brie melting and running out of the puffs so there wasn't a lot of Brie left and didn't have the taste I would have expected.  I missed the part in the recipe about turning them over half way through the baking time so this may have been the cause.  I plan on trying the recipe again to see if I have better luck.

These were a perfect side for our last women's tea party...  I normally don't go for mushroom, but these were great!

Phyllo always takes time but its so very worth it if you get the filling right. I've tried a couple different ones and this is so far the best one.

Followed ErinCC's suggestion and used pre-cooked tartlets with brie and mushroom mixture. Very good!

This was incredible!!  Ok, I didn't follow the recipe to an absolute T.  I figured any yummy mushrooms would do, so I used shiitake and morels.  Also, I didn't have the time to fold phyllo into pretty triangles, so I just molded it into my pop-over thingy, layering with melted butter of course.  What I came up with was "cups" rather than "puffs."  Don't know if this was better tasting, but everyone "fought" over the last two!

Not thrilled with the outcome.  They were hard to put together and sort of flat in taste.  I wouldn't make these again.
