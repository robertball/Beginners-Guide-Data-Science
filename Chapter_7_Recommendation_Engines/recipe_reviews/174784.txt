Thanks for sharing.  I like to try different garam masala recipes and this one was tops! This is the first one that I tried that used black cumin seeds and fennel.  Interesting combination of flavors.  I will have to work on incorporating them into my favorite garam masala recipe.

Very easy to make. Thank you so much for sharing. I also added some Harissa for extra spice.
