This is a really good cold soup! I'm not a fan of honey, but I decided that I'd give it a shot. I omitted the mint and replaced half the lemon juice with lime juice, and I'm glad I did use the lime juice. It's a beautiful blend of tart and sweet (I used a very red, ripe watermelon). When I have mint on hand, I'll try it in this. If you want a thicker soup, make sure you blend this at a slower speed and check the consistency as you go. I chose to puree it all the way and end up with more of a liquid, which suited what I wanted. I can't wait to experiment with adding other fruits to the mix.

Delicious! I added a bit more honey after I tried it though, since my boyfriend doesn't like mint, but it was perfect to me as it was, I loved it!

I just made this soup for a really hot day here in Los Angeles.  It was beyond delicious. It was refreshing and my guests could not stop raving about it.  A really delicious and easy soup!  All my friends want the recipe now!

This was surprisingly refreshing. All of the flavours went really well together and the honey was a nice touch, although I might try some serrano chile next time for a kick.

Reminds me of this watermelon rind chutney in my collection of savory watermelon recipes, a great use for the leftover watermelon that one would normally throw out!

This soup was so easy to make and tasted incredible.  I don't like watermelon but we get them in our CSA box so I try new recipes whenever I can.  The flavors blended perfectly and nothing was overwhelming.  I cut back the honey to 2 tsp. because the watermelon was already very sweet and I didn't bother chilling it.  Delicious!  Thank you for posting it.

It was watermelon in the blender.  Adding a little tequila, cointreau and a straw would have been better.

Simple, versatile, and scrumptious! Excellent basic recipe, and also excellent with the addition of plain yogurt and additional honey, and/or with more blended fruits. A favorite concoction of mine was this recipe, plus yogurt, banana, and frozen mango also blended in. Made a thicker soup, bordering on smoothie consistency. I drank it from a bowl made from one end of the watermelon, with a straw in it. Really fun and tasty!

Total hit! I doubled the recipe and used the rest to make watermelon slushies. I didn't use the mint in the second batch. Instead I puréed it a bit more and then froze it in ice cube trays. I puréed the frozen cubes with some Absolut Citron. Yum!

I work in a staff line at a school so I make a lot of soups especially from this app. Made this one today and it was a hit just like the other recipes.

The taste of this soup is very good but it is way too watery. It might have just been the particular watermelon I chose . Mine is  more a drink, not as thick as a smoothy.

My family enjoyed this soup.  The  cucumber flavor comes through so don't add any extra you may have cut up.

I would suggest straining the watermelon purée, and cutting it with seltzer or sparkling cider.

I had watermelon soup on a cruise that I went on about 20 years ago and having been looking for a recipe ever since.  This is it!  I had a really big watermelon so I made a batch with the mint and another without.  I liked them both, but my husband thought that the mint was a little too strong.  Maybe he'd like it better reducing the amount of mint a bit.

Pretty plain and nothing special. Decided to freeze the rest of mine with alcohol and make slush. Much better!

An amazingly easy, delicious, and refreshing soup. Definitely use a good quality honey. Also, I found that leaving some small pieces of watermelon unblended gave the soup a much better texture.
