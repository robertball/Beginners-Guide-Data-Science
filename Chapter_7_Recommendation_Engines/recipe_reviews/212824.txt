I am a full-blooded Czech and this is exactly how we always make the potato pancakes (called "bramboraky" or "cmunda").
Traditionally these are fried in lard - it adds that extra flavor but I doubt many would try that. When I make them at my home here in America, I just use regular vegetable oil.
Few pointers: Don't skip or substitute the marjoram, I actually add way more then just a pinch. Also add lots of pepper and especially salt. Potatoes tend to soak up the salt flavor quite a bit. Lets face it, this is not a healthy meal to begin with, so you might as well make it right. Like Sonya recommends, fry up and taste the first pancake, it should have a nice salty/garlicky flavor. Even tho I've made these many times, it usually takes me more then one trial pancake to get the flavor right.
When my mom made these, it was the one time we didn't actually have a sit down family dinner. We would just sneak them right when they were done and she ate as she was making them. They just taste the best when they're nice and hot right out of the frying pan!

These were excellent potato pancakes! I often find that recipes call for too many eggs for the amount of potato but this one was just right. I substituted oregano for the marjoram, left out the caraway seeds (I didn't have any) and added in some onion powder. They were light, crispy and delicious with some apple sauce. Thanks Sonya!

These were fantastic. I've always wanted to try potato pancakes, and I came across this recipe. I cut my potatoes into chunks and grated them with a rotary grater into a bowl of cold water and let it soak for half an hour. I also added onion salt to mine.The flavor is great and mine were light and fluffy. This is a keeper

I used to love getting potatoes pancakes with apple compote and thick sour cream at this one Russian Restaurant in New York, which I miss so much. I've tried many recipes and mixes, but couldn't get the taste, texture and crisp. I would use onions and it would always come out a little too moist and dense.  Thank you! I finally got crisp potato pancakes, flavorful with the caraway seeds and marjoram.  We decided to use this liquid creme fraiche that we had in fridge instead of milk.  Served it with some homemade rum spiced apple compote and a nice blonde beer . I really dug the caraway seed flavor it added, and as you mentioned the beer! Oh I thought I 'd share this with you since you mentioned Korea and potato pancakes, my mom would make it with green onions, shredded carrots and dried cod. Yum!

This was an amazing recipe.  It immediately caught my eye because my heritage is Czechoslovakian and I have never really explored their cuisine.

With this recipe I followed the batter recipe almost exactly except I substituted Cumin and Oregano.  I also made my pancakes with a hole in the center and added a poached egg with runny yoke in the hole (the yoke makes a great sauce to bind all the flavors).  I threw on some fresh tomatoes and shredded cheese to top of all of this off and garnished with a bit of fresh cilantro.  It was truly Deeeeeelish!!!

Thanks Sonya.

We made them with much ease. We added grated parmesean, which was very good. However, I don't recommend frying in Canola oil. NOt sure what kind you should use....anyway, Thanks for sharing!

These potato pancakes tasted good and different.  I give them three stars because they frying is not my preference and the recipe didn't act like a batter (I scooped my pancakes into the pan).  FYI-I tried frying them in nonstick spray, but they were not good that way.  Also, the portion size must be huge because I used two large potatoes and came up with about four servings.

Actually the best way how to enjoy Bramboracky is to finally top them on your plate just with handful of pickled cabbage. The sour one is the best one. And if you enhance the dough with smoked bacon chopped fine (as mentioned in the recipe), you' ll do no wrong.

Very close to the original traditional potato pancakes ... only one comment: that marjoram is a must. Potato pancakes will never taste right without a solid portion of it.
As an option you can add e.g. sliced bacon, ham etc.
I personally like the pancakes thin and almost crepe-size (nice breakfast), some like small and thicker (good with e.g. goulash instead of dumplings).

These are tasty! I would definitely make again. I used a little more garlic than needed because I love it. Note: I think the measurements are wrong, because I used 2 potatoes and ended up with 6 small-medium pancakes instead of 3 large ones (using 1/4 cup each).

Pourable? No...but delicious! Added some thyme and diced red bell pepper. Also, keep them thin if you want them cooked in the middle and crispy!

My Bohemian grandmother used to make these, and I still had her recipe.  She used lard, I use a solid shortening, and a hot cast iron fry pan is a must.  Draining as much water as you can is important, the water will come to the top of the bowl after you grate the potatoes, also don't leave a metal grater or metal spoon in the mix, it will turn the mixture green. My recipe is a little different but basically the same. These are definitely better than anything American restaurants try to pass off as potato pancakes.

These were good. Not quite like Jewish latkes - the seasoning gives it a different flavor - but tasty. Like others, I used a tsp. of cumin instead of caraway seeds.
