As is, this recipe isn't good--there's no sauce and no flavor.  To make this recipe AMAZING, double all the ingredients (other than the pasta) and add a chicken bullion cube.  When adding the olive oil, add a few tablespoons of tomato paste and let the sauce come to a boil before adding the pasta.  I've even added a litte heavy cream to the sauce and it's great that way too.

With some "adjustments" this recipe was absolutly wonderful and I intend on making this again..and again...What is great about it is you could serve as is..or even add some cut up marinated chicken breasts, or some shrimp into the mix. This time I added a pound of medium sized shrimp..next time, I think I may try some chicken. I also love the fact that this can be eaten cold or hot!

Now for the "adjustments" I didn't use a red onion, only because I am not too fond of them, so I used a yellow onion instead, and the whole thing, not just 1/2. I also used a whole red pepper instead of 1/2 and a few more mushrooms than that what was called for. 

**A note for next time though....the recommened amount of veggies and pasta ratio seemed to be a little off..A 1 lb box of bow tie pasta makes a lot. I think next time I will add 2 zucchini and 2 squash instead of 1 each, and a lot more mushrooms (we just love mushrooms), along with the whole onion and the whole red pepper..Maybe even a whole yellow pepper added to the mix would be nice. I also wonder how this would taste using a can or two of rotelle tomatoes (chopped tomatoes with green chilis) instead of the cut up roma tomatoes....Might give it a nice "bite"

This pasta dish was easy to make and full of flavor! I served it to a dinner party of 6 and it was a huge hit with them! I would suggest it to anyone who wants a quick and easy pasta dish to make.

Loved the basic recipe but made a few changes for my preference and convenience. Used angel hair, dried basil instead of fresh, and cooked all the tomatoes, rather than reserving any for the top.  I also increased the amount of mushrooms, and used two zucchini squashes instead of one zucchini and one yellow squash because that's what was available at my grocery store.  This is one of the healthiest recipes I've ever made at this site.

This was a fantastic recipe!  I loved how healthy it all was and how the flavor of the veggies really came out.  I added more cheese and salt than the recipe called for because it was kind of bland the first time I tried it, but otherwise, this is really great recipe that uses low-cost veggies and didn't take that long to make.  Def. try again!

For those looking for more adventuresome cooking, you might want to try something different. Still, this is a simple, tried and true zucchini/pasta dish that is satisfying, nutritious and delicious.  How can you go wrong?

This was amazing! I left out the mushrooms and fresh basil and added fresh spinach and 2 chicken breasts.  I have a feeling I'll be craving this dish every week!

This was pretty good. The only thing I did differently was to use canned diced tomatoes, and I used some of the juice plus a little chicken stock to make it a tad more moist. This would be excellent with chicken or even just some crumbled bacon. Thanks!

Delicious!!  I used 3 zucchinis, no summer squash, no pepper and dried basil and oregano and it was wonderful!!!  I cooked my veggies in a cast iron skillet and added a sprinkling of mozzerella cheese with the Parm!  Everyone loved it!

I made this recipe mainly because it was a very healthy recipe. I figured it would be kind of bland but I was so wrong. I doubled the mushrooms from 1/2c. to a full cup next time I'll probably add 2c. because they tasted so good in this and there were not nearly enough. I will also add an extra zucchini. This was so wholesome and yummy!

Really quite nice.  You can also cut back on the oil, just 2 tablespoons of good quality extra virgin in the end is fine.  And I used dry basil too which was still fine.  Really yummy!  I'll certainly make it again.

Pretty good, though I would've liked if there was more tomato in it and less of the other veggies, but I love traditional tomato sauces.

Nice, quick pasta recipe. I put all the tomatoes into the sauce instead of saving them for the end. I also added some red wine and didn't add the oil with the pasta as it wasn't needed. I put way more mushrooms in as we like mushrooms. Thanks for the recipe.

4.5 Not as much olive oil but otherwise prepared as directed.  Very nice!!  The parmesan just finishes it off nicely.

Followed the recipe exactly and loved it! Next time I make it though I will probably add a little pureed tomato and chicken stock to make it a wee bit more moist. Otherwise, yum!!

I made this as the recipe directed but did add more vegetables, because more is better, right? And I also added some chicken strips from Oscar Mayer. This is fantastic. I thought the extra 1/4 cup of olive oil was a little much at first but once I added it, it made the meal. I would use real grated parm cheese next time. Kraft is okay, but real is so much better. Great as a leftover, too.

I just finished making this recipe. It's delicious and healthy. I wanted a little more sauce, so I added a can of stewed Italian tomatoes and only used one large fresh tomato. However, I think the stewed tomatoes drown out the fresh tomato so next time I will just use the fresh.

Other than a few simple changes (extra mushrooms cuz I had some to use up, rotini instead of bow pasta and less pasta than called for, pizza seasoning blend instead of oregano cuz it's all I had...) I followed the recipe fairly closely. Hubby and I thought it was delicious. A nice, simple summer supper.

This recipe is delicious and uses ingredients I usually have!  I've made it a few times now with few to no variations. The recipe is great as is, but this time I only had 3 tomatoes and no basil, mushrooms or yellow squash. Instead I used ~1/4 cup fresh parsley (I eyeball just about everything in this recipe), a can of sliced black olives, a whole green bell pepper, dried basil (~1 tsp), and a few shakes of red pepper flakes. This recipe is great even if you have to adjust it to what you have on hand. And it's healthy! Can't beat that combo. I will certainly keep this recipe handy.

Was very good coming from a person who is not a big fan of vegetables.  I did make it a little different based on the advise of some of the others.  I sauted in the oil from sun dried tomatoes.  I then used sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh. Will make again.

Excellent!  Definitely will be adding this to my book of favorites, thanks for sharing!  The only changes I made was substituting red pepper flakes for the chopped red pepper (not a fan of red peppers) and I used a yellow onion in place of red onion - it's what I had on hand.  Turned out wonderful! :o)

great recipe - very simple. i cut out the onion (no red onion on hand) and used shaved parmesan instead.  as others have noted i added more veggies than called for, and plan to add more next time i make this - but it's a great (and versatile) recipe.

This was a very tasty recipe. It took a while to chop all of the vegetables, but it is a nice blend of fresh food. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the amount of pasta to other ingredients is too high. I used approx 1/2 lb of pasta instead of a pound.

i made this for my bunco group, and they loved it!  I should have added a little more salt, but that as easily fixed.  I'll definitely make this for my family, too.  Love all the veggies!

Very good and really versitile.  You could really throw in veggies you want to use up.  I added banana peppers, extra mushrooms and used a whole red pepper.

Excellent! Ya, this recipe is so versatile. You can change things here, add this or that, take this or that out, whatever you like. When I made this for company, it was a smash! We hardly had leftovers. The veggies really give it variety.

A great light dish that makes you feel healthy and like you are not spending a lot of calories.  My 15 year old brother said he would have liked it with marinara sauce but wasn't a big fan.  But the adults loved it.

A bit on the bland side in my opinion.  Some garlic salt and extra parm. cheese helped it out alot.  The red onions were a bit much for my family (I'll use white next time).  If you have small children, the prep time is more like 20 minutes.  Refreshing and filling, just needs some added flavor.

Quick and easy and a family favorite.  It's great for a nice light summer dish too!  I've added a little cooked chicken or shrimp just to add a little variety.

This is one of those recipes that you can bring it to work throughout the week to eat cold or hot. I added more mushrooms because I am mushroom crazy but other than that, the recipe was followed as listed. This does make a ton of food so either scale down, make it for a group or have ample tupperware on hand.

Excellent recipe.  Only thing I would change is more vegetables and lots of basil.  We chopped all the veggies in small cubes and they really get lost.  The cheese is necessary or would have no flavor.  I added some grilled chicken and shrimp would probably be good too.

Very good! And also a good way to use up seasonal vegetables.
I hate to rate a really good recipe with 5 stars and then go on to write how I changed it. Now that being said I just want to mention that a can of diced tomatoes adds a little more sauciness" if desired; and it's also good with ground beef or Italian sausage added. 
THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

This was great.  We were skeptical since it didn't really have a sauce.  But, it was delicious and felt very healthy.  We will definitely "put it into the rotation" as my husband said.

I didn't follow this recipe to a T, but it is a great base recipe for expirementing with different pestos and herbs.  My boyfriend was leary of all the vegetables, but ended up really enjoying it in the end (we did add some leftover ham to the mix for him though).  It came out better than expected...Thanks!

delicious! Colorful and healthy, just used spices to taste. I didn't have squash or zucchini, but upped the onion (used white), added Quorn chicken bits, and also added shredded mozzarella at the end. it turned out nicely and my boyfriend loved it.

Yummy! I simplified the recipe a little and just used what I had on hand - I used "Italian Seasonings" instead of fresh herbs, and it was still really good!  For veggies I just used tomatoes, mushroom, zucchini and onions.  I used multi-color curly pasta - fun!  I had never tried preparing pasta any other way than with tomato sauce - this was delicious and a keeper!  Thanks!

I always think of pasta related to tons of cheese and tomato sauce, this is one recipe to consider to a healthier option, an original dish...it has a strong flavor and great ingredients, don´t miss it and try it out!

This recipe was fabulous!  I used fresh zucchini, squash, tomatoes, and pepper right from our garden and it was a big hit with the whole family.  Very tasty and easy too!

I cut the pasta in half and it was still plenty!  I had to omit the garlic due to an allergy (I suspect my husband is a vampire) but this is still very good.  I did add shrimp.

I used spagetti squash instead of bow tie pasta. I also added some red pepper flakes to give a little more flavor. Very good recipe

I have made this quite a few times and my family really likes it.  I have  changed a few things over time to suit our tastes.  The main change is that I add a lot more veggies.  Usually I add an 8oz container of mushrooms, a full red pepper (just easier than 1/2 of one), 2 zucchinis and sometimes two squashes.  I also add all the tomatoes in with the veggies because my family is not huge tomato fans and this way they cook down a bit and also make a little bit of a sauce.  I also use a bit more salt than in the recipe.   I think you could make lots of adjustments and additions based on what you have on hand and your preferences.

This was pretty tasty.  I took the advice of many reviewers and doubled all the veggies.  I think next time I would double just the bell pepper, mushrooms, and one of the squashes, because mine was fairly veggie-heavy.  But, that is the healthy part, so it was ok!  And it tasted great!  I forgot to add any of the tomatoes to the pan until the last minute, so the end result was I basically didn't cook any of them, but that was fine.  I also added some spinach just because I had some I needed to use up, and I think that was a good addition.  I didn't think this dish suffered at all from a lack of sauce, as some people mentioned.  It was more of a warm pasta salad this way, but I like pasta salad.  I would definitely make it again!  It seems very adaptable, just throw in whatever veggies are lying around.

This was just ok for me. It was eatable, but I probably wouldn't make it again.
