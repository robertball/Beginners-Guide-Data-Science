I LOVE this!  I had never thought of adding the bacon . . . that's BRILLIANT!
It is very important to use real butter and use ground beef that is not too lean (the fat adds flavor!)  Seriously everyone, we all give in to ice cream and cake occasionally so why not OCCASIONALLY give in to the yumminess of fatty meat and cheese.  Don't forget to have a vegetable though and by that I mean french fries of course.  Who wants to live forever anyway if you aren't enjoying life?   and it's not heroin - it's food.  All things in moderation.

The directions should have stated to season the beef with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste, and always add at least 4 slices of bacon to each burger! Like the title says this is not a burger for the health freaks, but once or twice a year it will hit the spot!

OMG, this is genius! You should definitely limit this to once or twice a year, but oh my goodness, how delicious!

Great idea, but I used sliced sourdough one with provolone and the other with swiss, then topped the burger with a slice of american and a few strips of bacon or pancetta. I also seasoned the burgers with salt, pepper, garlic, and onion before tossing on the grill. Super Yummy!
