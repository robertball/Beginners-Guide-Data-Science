I found this to be a very good chowder. I made a couple of changes I added celery and parsley flakes and because I like a thicker creamier chowder I made a rue og 3/4 C melted butter and 3/4 C flour and added with the corn and milk. I would like to see more people give their potato and onion measurements in cups as everyone has a different perspective of size. 3 potatoes could be anywhere from 3 C to 12 C and the same with onions. I used 41/2 C diced potatoes and 1 1/2 C chopped onion

A splendid recipe as written. I like creamy anything.I added 4+1/2 cups of milk and added  flour to the remaining 1/2 cup of cold milk for the additional thickening.

I made this great fish chowder as an easy first course for my big family gathering. It was a hit. Easy and delicious. One change - next time I will use 3 cups water and 4 cups milk for a little bit thicker base.

Had never made fish chowder so was looking for a good basic recipe and this is it.  I used butter spray instead of butter for sauteeing onion.  Provided butter for those who wished to add a pat to their bowl. Used a can of chicken broth with enough water to cover potatoes and cooked them until they were tender (red potatoes in small cubes with peels still on).  Did not measure milk, but added until it looked right to me.  Used talapia instead of cod.  Sprinkled some Old Bay seasoning and a little cayenne into the pot and my secret ingredient for this type of dish which is a dash of cinnamon which brings out the sweetness of the corn and the milk (I don't measure, but maybe 1/4 tsp).  Lip smacking good!

Wish I had read the reviews, first. The flavor was good, but I wish I had poured out the water after cooking the potatoes, and only used milk. Chunkier soup is our preference. The cayenne seems like a great idea, too, so I will give that a whirl next time. This was a really good soup to be so easy!

I made this for the first time as above with the following changes, along with the onion, add 1 chopped leek. With the potatoes. Simmer for 12 – 15 minutes only, they’ll finish with the milk and corn. I separated out 1 cup of milk and mixed that with 1/4 cup of flour which I used to both slow the soup and thicken the broth right before serving. I also used 2 tsp. Old Bay Seasoning along with one packet of vegetable Bovril. Additionally, Cod isn’t necessary. I used a pound of Pollock, and enough Halibut, Shrimp and Scallops to make up another pound. Finally, do not under any circumstances allow your fish to stew for 15 minutes. By all means stew the rest of it until it’s reached a slow boil but once you add that fish, no more than 5 minutes to finish it. Any more and you’ll ruin that delicate meat.  It was delicious and consumed with zeal.

This was delicious!  My husband is lactose-intolerant, so we used oil instead of butter, and soy milk for the milk, and my family ate the whole pot in the one evening.  I will defintely be making this again!

It was OK. The milk and water didn't really blend well, making it look a little unappetizing, and the cook times didn't seem long enough as my very small potato cubes still weren't very soft, and it was bland. Definately would need to add to it to make it good.

Very good!  I used Halibut instead of cod, to great success, and because I didn't have creamed corn, I used canned corn and added a little sugar.  I also recommend white pepper rather than black.  I sprinkled cayenne pepper into the bowl before eating.  Yummy!

Awesome basic recipe.. 'Course, I tweaked it. :)  I used 4 potatoes, 1 cup milk, 1 cup frozen corn, and tilapia instead.  I also added chicken bullion to the water to add some flavor and some flour to thicken the soup. It was yummy. Perfect with bread and butter.

This was okay. We thought there were not enough vegetables and too much liquid. It was very good with the corn. I would not make this again but I will add creamed corn to fish chowder in the future.

I used some previous suggestions and it turned out great.  I added 4 stalks of chopped celery, and 3 chopped carrots for color.  I like a thick chowder so I only used 3 cups water and 4 cups milk.  Instead of using white flour, I added 1/4 cup of whole wheat baby cereal (its more nutritious!).  My family loved how it turned out so this recipe will now be a regular at my house.

I thought this was excellent! I knew right off the bat that 4 cups would be too much water!! So I only added 2 1/2 cups of water. I also used 1 1/2 cups evaporated milk instead of regular milk. Very good, will add carrots next time.

Great recipe! I read a few fish chowder recipes but this is the one I went with because it has a great basic style and I'm happy I did. I modified by using chicken broth and clam juice instead of water and I used evaporated milk. I used flounder and added a few stalks of chopped celery the result was a chowder that was good and creamy, delicately flavored with the notes of fish and sweetness from the creamed corn.  This recipe seems easy to adapt too and I look forward to trying out different styles.  Oh and I used corn starch to get my chowder to the thickness I wanted.

I fried 3 strips of bacon in my 5 qt dutch oven.  I put the bacon in the freezer for another day.  I drained all but 1 tblsp of the bacon grease and sauted the onion and potatoes in the same kettle (no water at all).  Stir often to get the bacon bits off the bottom for lots of flavor.  Then I added the creamed corn, 2-1/2 C Skim Milk and 1 C Half & Half.  Added my fish, S&P, (black pepper and lots of it), cayenne pepper, dried dill weed and 2 tblsp butter at the end.  DELISH!!!

My family and I LOVED this chowder....even my two picky little ones!!!  I added some diced carrots in with my onions and sauteed them.  And I added some fresh spinach leaves for another veggie.  They blend right in and are barely even detectable. I also decreased the amt. of water I used because of other reviews.  Also, I used new potatoes, diced w/ skins on (because I had a bag of those on hand) and I had to use a cylinder of frozen cream corn, again because that's just what I had on hand.  It was a cold, rainy night and I didn't want to have to get out and go to the store.  Thanks for this definite KEEPER!!  Can't wait to share it with my mom :)

This was a great soup.  I added a bit or oregano to and italian seasoning to the soup and it was delicious.  I'm making it again as there was not a drop left when I made this last week.  Super fast and easy.

I fallowed the directions, made no changes and it had very little flavor i think it needs a rew (buttler and flower) to thicken it up a little bit so its not like broth but thicker. Besides that its wonderful.

The is a very easy and very good base from which to start..... I cut the recipe in half.  Also, anytime a recipe calls for water.. I will usually substitute with a low sodium broth = more flavor... in this case 2 cups of chicken broth (didn't want an overwhelming fish taste).  I also added 1/2 cup of frozen corn, because we like corn in our chowder.  I only used a cup of whole milk (half recipe used) and I also added about 10 med frozen raw shrimp chopped up.  Gave the chowder that pleasant undertones of a seafood base being used.  This was a very good starter base thanks

I made this dish last night for dinner and I barely had enough for lunch today. I think I had like 2 bowls and my boyfriend had to say stop remember you want some for luch tomorrow. He had seconds as well and he does not like soups.  Even our little 4 year daughter thought it was very "DELICIOUS". This dish deserves 10 stars. I work fulltime so this is right up my alley, quick and easy and extremely flavourful. I'm already planning on making it again for lunch on Friday. I just added some fish stock and a small tin of cream style corn and some coconut milk as per my boyfriend's request because he's the real Chef in our house. OH MY GOODNESS! You have to try this recipe. THIS IS OUT OF THIS WORLD. This is defintely a  " KEEPER ". NO DOUBTS ABOUT THAT. ENJOY !

This is a very tasty chowder; it's good with tilapia, in addition to cod. I concur that extra milk makes it thicker and creamier. I've also found the creamed corn to be an optional ingredient: it's plenty good with just the fish, onions, and potato!

My husband  made this recipe this weekend and it was really, really good.  And unlike most fish dishes, it tastes great re-heated!  He did make some changes:  Added 6 slices of cooked bacon bits, made a butter and flour roux to thicken, and added a little less than a pint of cream.  And he added some cayenne to give it a little kick.  My only complaint is my house still smells like fish, and he made this two nights ago!!

This is a good base but needed a little something. I added a few tablespoons of Old Bay seasoning, grated carrot and a little Tabasco. The result was very tasty!  Fast, easy, inexpensive and great for those cold nights.

This recipe was delicious, but we did make a few changes.  We added carrots, some jicama, and used butter instead of margarine.  We also used chicken broth instead of water.  I think that these added a lot to the recipe.  We have three kids aged 7, 4, and 2, and they all loved it.  We would definitely make again and would consider make a roux the next time to make it easier for the kids the eat (less liquid).  With the changes, I would rate this a 5!

Very good.  I used yellowtail tuna instead of the cod.  I also used only a half an onion, omitted all the water, used 4 cups of whole milk and added 3 tablespoons of flour while boiling.  Chowder came out thick and creamy.

This wasn't very good.  It made double the amount of servings it said it made, and the cod didn't have much flavor.  The broth was good with the creamed corn and onions.  I added hot sauce for some heat.

Very tasty, and so quick to make. I cut water and milk back, added prawns, and thickened it. I also added the grated carrot, as suggested for color. Superb, and rated 5 stars by all who ate it.

Loved this recipe, but added creamed soup. Broccoli or asparagus works well.  Adds a bit of thickness as well as a mild salty taste.

I made this last night for myself and my 20yo picky granddaughter and it was just awesome!  She refused to try it at first, saying fish soup was gross but when she took a taste, her bowl was cleaned faster than mine!   We loved it and will make this again and again!  I thank all the good cooks submitting recipes...I haven't found a bad one yet!

Great recipe!  My husband loved it -thank you. I modified it just a little - I used crappie and bluegill as that was what I had, cut back the water, added a can of cream of mushroom when the potatoes were tender, then reduced the amount of milk by adding just somewhere in the neighborhood of three cans (I used the cream of mushroom can) of milk.  I also thickened my soup up with a little corn starch in more cold milk, stirred well and added to really hot soup.  Thanks for posting it - I love looking for different things to make!

I don't know that I am the best reviewer for this type of dish as I am not a fan of fish, but I am still putting one here.  This was ok.  It definitely helped to disguise the fish flavor.  It was really good with toasted garlic bread.  It does not freeze well though, so don't try it.  I didn't think it would, but the recipe made so much I didn't want to just throw it away.

Okay, I picked this recipe because it had good ratings and seemed simple. Boy, was I wrong. First off, the onions burned within several minutes and when I added the water and potatoes, they were floating in a nice brown burnt onion water. I added more potatoes, less water and less milk because there is no way you'd get a nice thick soup with three potatoes and that much liquid. Still, the consistency was then, so I decided to add flour, which instead of making it thicker, only clumped up and floated at the top. It's still simmering as I type and I am hoping that it will turn out halfway eatable. I know that I won't use this recipe again, even if it tastes alright, because it was a pain to make.

Bland,  I added 2 tbs of Old Bay, and some hot sauce.  Much better.  If to thin, add some instant mashed potatoes flakes to suit.

Warning: it makes A LOT, so make sure you have a big enough pot to start it out. It's a good base recipe, so you can add other spices you'd like to taste!

Using this recipe as a base, we had a great meal.  Diced up one stalk of celery and two carrots with the onion and cooked that in the butter until softened.  Then added 1/4C flour to make a roux.  Added one cup of water, the potatos, a crushed clove of garlic, and two cups of chicken stock.  Let that cook about 20 minutes, then added the cream-style corn and enough milk to get it to the consistency we like, along with a little bit of thyme, parsley, and pepper.  Added the fish and cooked for about 15 minutes.  We had some very happy tummies!

Terrific!! I made this soup but I used salmon and tilapia instead, as that's what I had on hand. I used only 1 1/2 cups water infused w/2 packages of chicken bouillon powder. I did substitute w/a can of evaporated milk, cream of mushroom soup and 1 1/2 cups whole milk.  I added a few dashes of cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes and seafood seasoning. I also sprinkled in some dry dill weed and parsley flakes for color It was awesome! I left it simmering on low for about 20-30 mins after adding fish to thicken it up. We enjoyed this very much and can't wait to try it again with different seafood!

I liked it a lot.  I used only two cups of milk but added some frozen corn and a scoop of basil pesto just because I had it on hand.  I wished I had cut the bacon into smaller sizes but it was easy to put together and it made a LOT!

This was a good starter recipe. I used a mix of basa fillet and salmon, frozen sweet corn and I didn't have much milk so I made a slurry of milk and flower and then melted some cream cheese in. Added cheddar cheese on top and it was DELICIOUS. It was just missing the fresh dill unfortunately.

I absolutely loved this. I added a few things because I like food a little spicy. I added chopped chives and celery. Also some package seasoning which is a blend of spices and herbs, and just a little curry to the mix. It was wonderful. I also changed the proportion of milk to water as suggested by other people. It was thick and delicious

I used whiting for the recipe and it turned out fine. I used the full 5 cups of milk- probably only needed about 3 cups of milk. Used a slotted spoon to scoop out the potatoes/fish/corn part then added some of the milk on top. Will make again!

Followed this pretty closely - didn't use any water. Used mostly NF milk, with a little cream thrown in for good measure. Used regular frozen corn.  Added one garlic clove.  Served with Cheddar Bay Biscuits.  Great on a chilly night!

A good base recipe.  I changed the amount of corn (didn't look like enough) and I didn't have quite enough fish on hand. I used tarakihi instead because it looked nicer in the store.  I added dried oregano, dried dill and garlic powder.  I'll add more next time and maybe some cayenne as well.
