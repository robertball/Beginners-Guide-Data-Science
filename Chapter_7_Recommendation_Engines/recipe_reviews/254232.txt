We love basil and grow our own, so always looking for recipes that call for it. I've made this dish twice now and the second time I added frozen peas and that was a wonderful addition to an already great, easy recipe. I did not add the chile peppers, however, I sprinkled some crushed red pepper flakes to give it some heat since that's what I had on hand. Served it with brown rice and spring rolls. It's a keeper.

Very good and easy as described. My husband suggested I review it and give it five stars as he really enjoyed it. I used regular fresh basil (not Thai) and it it tasted just like Thai food to us. It will stay in my favorites!

Very tasty and the kids ate it up without any complaints. I did add some grated ginger because I’m a huge fan and it added a great flavor to the dish! This is great for quick weeknight dinners.

This comes together very quickly and is a great way to use up extra basil growing in the garden.

We don’t eat much grain in our house so I made it and served it over broccoli. Lots of basil from our garden toned down the spice a bit. It was absolutely amazing. No leftovers here. Ever.

Excellent and easy base recipe.  Now that I've made it a second time, I did a bit extra:  added fresh grated ginger with the garlic.  Added a bit of crushed red pepper and fresh ground black pepper to the chicken as it sautéed.  I added a chopped red bell pepper with the onion.  I added a bunch of chopped scallions, some with the other veg, and some with the basil right at the end.  I used regular basil because I grow it and am always trying to use it.  And I used two minced jalapeños instead of chili peppers, because I had them.  Read other reviews, and think peas would be an awesome addition!  Great way to use up any veggies you like, really love this...
