This was surprisingly delicious! I didn't have time to marinate for more than 15 minutes. Used one of each green pepper, red pepper and rather large onion. Cut up boneless chicken breast into 1" pieces. I did put everything into a Ziploc bag to marinate---I was thinking I might just do everything on the sheet pan, but am glad I did the bag. Was easy and could really tumble everything around to get coated with the spices and oil. I did not have any cilantro or lime and didn't miss it---although I do love cilantro! Cooked as stated---no one was ready for dinner yet and had to keep hot in oven for about an extra 15 minutes...and didn't seem to hurt the dish. Very good! Served in flour tortillas with avocado, sour cream, cheddar and hot sauce with a side of rice and beans.

Very good! Although I used 2 sheet pans and doubled the seasoning. One pan was for the chicken which I marinated for 6 hours(used 6 chicken breast sliced thin with the full amount of spices) . Also didn't use the full amount of oil.. Just drizzled in some olive oil. I marinated the onions, and 2 red bell peppers for 2 hours with only a drizzle of olive oil and full amount of spices. When ready to cook I planced them on their own baking sheet along with some sliced mushrooms (approx 3 Cups). The Lime really makes everything pop.. I'm a huge sucker for Lime so didn't measure that. Served Mine in a whole grain wrap with some Avacado. Will definitely make this again. My only suggestion is for people that like a lot of flavor definitely double spices, and no need for that much oil.. Just drizzle.

Followed recipe exactly.  Marinated for about 90 minutes.  Cooked 20 minutes and chicken and vegetables were done just right, juicy and tender.  My problem with the recipe was that the spices were just not enough seasoning.  I tasted at 15 minutes bake time and sprinkled packaged fajita seasoning fairly heavy over contents in pan and cooked another 5 minutes.  Then it was delicious, spicy and tasty!

This is a good dish and very easy to make; but, in my opinion, it needs more seasoning. If you don't like a lot in your food then this is for you. Next time I make this, I will double the seasonings.  After cooking the chicken and vegetables, I put this under the broiler for a few minutes to char everything just a little bit. Very good dinner served with flour tortillas, salsa, sour cream, and shredded cheese,  and Mexican rice on the side.

This is an excellent idea and the chicken was so moist and flavorful. I used fajita seasoning instead of buying the spices separately.

Comments from my kids: "Why haven't you made this before?" "You should make this again and again!"
I forgot to do the cilantro and lime when it came out of the oven. Served this with flour tortillas, shredded cheese, sour cream, and refried beans. Easy meal that was enjoyed by all!

This was a great recipe, however I did make some minor changes. I used olive oil in place of what was suggested, used 1 packet of Taco Bell original taco seasoning and 1 packet of Taco Bell mild seasoning in place of the spices suggested, added about a teaspoonful of minced garlic, cayenne pepper, oregano, onion powder w/parsley  and concentrated lemon juice to the marinade mixture and served with taco rice and re fried beans. The hubby and I loved it and will be adding it to our weekly recipes. Thank you for a great recipe! Kept in fridge for about 1. 5 hours before cooking.

We have this once a week! I use the Easy Taco Seasoning from this site instead of the first ingredients. It is the easiest, tastiest recipe of all time. I use this process to make sheet pan stir-fry too. Just change up the spices, add some soy sauce to the marinade and add sliced zucchini, mushrooms, etc.

I made the recipe as it is written.  Mixed the marinate, dropped the veggies and chicken in a plastic bag in the  morning and cooked it that evening.  Easy and fast!  With great results!  Will defiantly make again.  I served it with guacamole and chips.  Would also be good with flour tortillas, sour cream, and cheese, and any other traditional Mexican food ingredients....

Believe me....if you want an easy, tasty way to prepare fajitas....this is it!!!!  I did double up on the garlic, onion and cumin powders and next time I will add more cayenne pepper for extra spice.  I also baked this until the bell peppers started to burn on the edges and that really added to the overall flavor.  Really a great recipe and thank you themoodiefoodie for submitting this.  I will now fix fajitas no other way!

Wow, Ive done fajitas for years, but these are quick, easy and delicious. I did cook at 425 for about 5 extra minutes. Next time I will cut the tenderloins in half. Delicious!

Loved this recipe. So much neater and easier to make in the oven than on the stove top. I did have extra chicken so I used 2 lbs of chicken, 3 peppers, and 2 sweet onions. Because of that I did double the spices and oil and put the chicken in one gallon bag to marinade and the vegetables in another. I agree that I could have cut down on some of the oil but it was still good. I marrinated for close to 2 hours. I also cooked them on separate sheet pans and rotated mid way through cooking (each pan was pretty full).

I actually forgot the lime at the end which I am sure would have added to the flavor. Everyone enjoyed it and I will definitely make this again. Thank you for an easy tasty recipe for a family favorite.

This was great and very easy to prepare! Based on other reviews, I used less than 1/4 cup oil and increased the amount of each of the spices and herbs slightly. I also added the lime juice to the seasoning before marinating for 2 hours or so. I served with warmed flour tortillas, freshly made guacamole,  sour cream, fresh lime wedges and chopped cilantro on the side (as my husband is not a big fan). Loved it!

I doubled the spice recipe, marinated my chicken all day and baked on parchment paper. This was really good. Super super easy. Makes a great weeknight meal when prepare chicken in the morning to let marinate and just bake in the evening. This has been added to my supper rotation.

Loved how easy this recipe was. I used some  sliced S/B chicken breasts. I went with the exact amount of the seasoning, except for the salt that I doubled, and I cooked for 20 mn. The chicken and vegetables had released some of their juices and that might have been what caused this dish to taste under seasoned ?! Next time I will increase the heat to 425 and cook only for 15 mn. We served this with corn tortillas , home made guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheese.

This was amazing!  The only thing of significance I changed was to add the lime juice to the marinade. I used olive oil instead of vegetable and turkey breast cut into strips. I probably marinated for 3 hours and it was plenty of time but I would not hesitate to go for more. I cut up an onion and a red and a green pepper. In my opinion I would like the veggies cooked a bit longer, but that’s just a preference. Baked for 20 min. Will probably aim for 15 next time and there WILL be a next time!

Such an easy, delicious meal! Definitely double the seasoning but not the oil. I use 4 chicken breasts sliced in strips and whichever bell peppers I have on hand sliced in thin strips. I like to add tomatoes to mine, preferably fresh but I’ve been known to throw in a can of stewed tomatoes, drained. Toss it all into a large ziplock bag and marinate in refrigerator. Bake on sheet pan and turn on the broiler for a minute or two at the end.

It was really good. I almost doubled the seasoning and used a couple tablespoons of olive oil two coat the chicken and vegetables. I cooked the chicken for ten minutes first and added the veggies for 12-15 minutes after that. The chicken was very moist, tender and yummy. This is almost a 5 star, simply because it was pretty taste and quickly prepared. Great weekday meal especially if you season the chicken and prep the veggies the night before

This was delicious! I doubled the recipe and used 3lbs of chicken tenderloins. Because I do not really like green peppers, I used mostly red peppers which are a little sweeter. I did not have time to marinate it for 15 minutes or longer but it turned out just as delicious. Because I doubled the recipe I had to use two pans to cook the mixture in. Instead of 15 or 20 minutes I left it in for 30 minutes. It was tender and crispy all at  the same time. This goes great in fajita bowls with blended cheeses and sour cream or in tortillas. I made this a few times already and will never use packaged seasoning again.

I love this recipe.  Very easy and full of flavor.  I marinated the veg and chicken in a large ziplock bag for 6 hours (just because I had a busy day) and I used about twice the spices specified.  I preheated a perforated grill pan on the propane grill for 5 minutes, then scooped out some of the veg & chicken onto the sizzling pan.  That's when I realized what a great recipe this would be for a camping trip or entertaining outdoors.  Because everything is ready to go straight from the marinade ziplock bag.  You just take the whole ziplock out to the grill and ladle out your desired amount of food on the grill pan, zip up what remains in the bag and put it back in the cooler until you need to feed more people.  Please don't forget the cilantro and lime.   (And on the grill I kept the temp at about 400 and it took 15 minutes to cook.  Make sure you get some grill marks on those peppers--try using red & yellow,  as I prefer them vastly over green peppers .  YUM!)  What a great thing to have on hand in the refrigerator when the teenagers and friends are in and out throughout the weekend.

Wonderfully easy. I used prepackaged chicken strips from GFS and pre sliced peppers from the grocery. Added some frozen sliced peppers I made from some I had bought on sale. Marinated overnight as my dinner partner went directly to bed after work. I used a one gallon freezer bag for marinating. Will use a two gallon bag next time. Baked on parchment paper so clean up was a snap. Served on Cinco de Mayo eve. Guests raved about it. Served with flour tortillas heated on the stove grill and warmed in a pan set on low flame. I have been informed that I WILL make this again.

So easy and so good! I made mine on the stove top in a skillet and like others, mostly doubled the spices. I think 1.5x is the perfect balance.

Loved! Makes fajitas a little less daunting being able to prep and marinate ahead of time, and bake in oven instead of watching on the grill. Was done in 20 minutes, but baked an extra 5 to try and crisp it up a little. Next time will put under broiler for a few minutes at the end.

Followed recipe exactly except I substituted parsley for the cilantro. Absolutely delicious! Served with rice and sour cream and my kids loved it. Will be making again!

This was excellent and so easy! I doubled the spices, added some chipotle chili powder, used fresh garlic,  and omitted most of the salt. I added some lime juice to the marinade, then added more when it was finished cooking.  Very delicious!

Big hit  in my home.  I made it with green, yellow and orange peppers and was delicious. Very easy to make. I did heat the baking sheet before putting the mixture in it, helped with cleanup. Recommend this to all that like fajitas.

These were good and easy.  I liked how the chicken stayed tender but the peppers and onions didn't get too soft.  I marinated for 2 hours and could barely taste the seasonings.  Next time I plan to marinate all day.

I made a version of these tonight and they were FABULOUS ! Use your own 'tweaks' with what you have . we used whole wheat tortillas, fresh avocado , lettuce for a super healthy meal ! I'll make this over and over again. didn't really need that oil, I just sprayed a little EVOO spray , cook on parchment and just throw away NO CLEAN UP ! I'll make this forever

This couldn’t be simpler.  Delicious, fast, easy clean up.  Perfect for entertaining .  I agree with others double up the seasoning or use Fajita package mix. I have done  both.

Cut up all chicken and peppers/onions the night before so the prep work was done.  Marinated about 4+ hours before cooking.  Chicken was so tender.  Very good recipe and many compliments!

Made the recipe as is and marinated for 2 hours. This was lacking in seasoning for us. Will make the recipe again, but will double the amount of the dry seasonings and I think it will be perfect for our tastes. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This recipe came out absolutely delicious! The best part of it was that it only took 20 minutes to cook. You could literally prep it the night before, and when you get home just pop it in the over. It all came out super favorable. The only thing I swapped out was the vegetable oil for the olive oil. Definitely going to be making this over again!

This made a very tasty fajita filling! It said to marinade the chicken mixture for 2 hours and I did. We added guacamole, salsa, shredded cheese and lettuce on flour tortillas and it was perfect. If not using a spicier salsa, I could see upping the amount of seasoning. #HealthyWinterDinner

I made this for tonight's supper. I forgot to buy the wraps so we just served it with rice. I liked it but I didn't LOVE it so I'm giving it 4 stars. I think next time I'll add another spice or two to the recipe. I don't like cumin or cilantro so didn't use them and now that I think about it, I forgot to add the lime juice at the end. That may be what was missing. Everything else was as called for in the recipe though. We'll definitely be having this again.

This was mouth-wateringly good. I used three tablespoons of olive oil (it was plenty) and probably a third more of the spices. After one bite hubby immediately  asked me to put it into the dinner rotation. So easy, flavorful and good! Rivals restaurant fajitas, in my opinion. I served it with lime, corn tortillas and guacamole. Rice and beans not needed unless you’re hearty eaters.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was superb.  I read many of the reviews and followed the recipe very closely.  I knew I wanted lots of flavor so I doubled up on all of the spices with the exception of the chili powder (3 tsp).  I marinaded everything in a bowl covered with plastic wrap for about 8 hours then baked in the oven as directed.  The chicken was fantastic-very flavorful and juicy.  I will absolutely be making this again .

Super easy recipe! I only marinated for 20 ish minutes due to time constraints but it still had flavor and was so good! It was perfect as a family meal. I would have added more seasoning if it were for me and my husband but since our kids ate it, we found the seasoning appropriate. Next time, I’ll plan ahead and marinate for longer!

Sheet pan fajitas are a great idea but this recipe was not very good. We found it pretty bland- the only thing I omitted was cayenne but I marinated overnight and with all the other stuff I thought it’d be better. Next time I’ll increase the chili powder and cumin, maybe use crushed garlic, decrease the oil and adds bit of lime or lemon juice in the marinade.

I made this recipe as directed but should have read the suggestions before hand to double the spices. The lime juice definitely added to the flavor. I will make again because it was an easy, tasty meal.

For reasons knows only to God, hubby picked up chicken in a can in the warehouse club.  Been struggling with what to do with the very wangy flavor.  For a 12oz can (7 oz drained), I used 2 tblsps of oil and halved the other seasons, except for the cayenne. I like spicy food. Did it for 15 mins to get the onions and peppers cooked.  I sprinkled some apple cider vinegar since I didn’t have lime. I topped it with garlic sauce and pepper jack cheese. It was yummy in my tummy.  Also very delicious on its own.

It is so tasty and the meat is tender.  My husband makes these and it has become a go to.  Whoever gets home first cuts up veggies and chicken then adds seasonings to marinate,  when we are both home we put it in the over and catch up on our day then enjoy an amazing feast.

I doubled the marinade recipe and used olive oil.  I also left out the cayenne.  We all absolutely loved it!  Everything was cooked perfectly!  My daughter took some leftovers for lunch and just sent me a text saying, "lunch was so good"!  I even shared the recipe with my brother!

I did not care for this at all. Nothing like original fajitas. The veggies were soggy even though I did placed under the broiler after baking.

Made it exactly according to the recipe. The chicken was flavorful and tender. I was able to marinate it for one hour, which seemed to work perfectly. It’s a great week night meal, especially if you put the chicken in the marinade in the morning!  I’ll be making this whenever I’m in the mood for fajitas. Thanks for sharing.

This is one of the best finds I've come across in the last ten years since I've been on this site. We love fajitas. I use the grill for them in the summer. This time of the year I always make them on the stove. The chicken comes out rubbery and the vegetables mushy (not to mention the greasy mess on the stove). Frankly, I'm embarrassed that I never thought to do them on a sheet pan in the oven. I followed this recipe exact, but added a small amount of liquid smoke to the marinade for more of a grilled flavor. I baked for 15 minutes. The chicken was tender and the vegetables not crunchy and not mushy.....but perfect.  The clean up was minimal!!! I'm so glad I found this.

love these! super fast and easy weeknight dinner. I use Tortillaland uncooked tortillas (I cook them, haha), sour cream, and avocado with them. I've made them several times and they always turn out. I leave out the cayenne for my kids but that's it! thank you so much!

This was AMAZING! I made it last night for dinner and I’m eating the leftovers for breakfast. It was very easy to make and didn’t make a big cooking mess in my kitchen. Definitely a once a week easy meal for my house.

Made a double batch for guys camping trip up to the cabin, everyone’s enjoyed it but it was spicy for almost all, I enjoyed it but I think I added too much cayenne pepper.  Fed a crowd and was very easy to make.

Wonderful recipe! Few changes (I know, I know) I doubled the amount of spices, based on other reviews. Also, I was out of lime, cilantro, and onion powder. 
 it was still heavenly, and very easy to make AND clean up.

Used this fairly easy recipe to help 14 year old granddaughter practice her skills.  We have a family of 12 that eat dinner together nightly so we pretty much doubled the recipe and it turned out great!!  We have a garden so we preselected some zucchini, chopped and added a bit of that as well. Those taking lunches were arguing over who was getting the most leftovers. 

We did add some spices and stir fried our shrimp after marinating in hoisin sauce for about an hour and we used a beer citricy soy sauce.  this will be made again soon!!!

Great basic recipe. I made a few changes based on other reviews and my own preferences. 
Doubled the spice, and marinated for full 2 hours, veg and meat separately, cooked them in separate cast iron skillets until almost done, then combined into the larger one to finish. Delish. served with sour cream, cheese blend, and over cilantro-lime rice instead of tortilllas. Also added lime juice to marinade as well as finishing with it. Will definitely make again and continue tweaking. Sheet pan great option for when I have less time.

Quick and healthier way to make fajitas.  I substituted olive oil instead of using vegetable oil and broiled the fajitas during last 5 minutes on a lower rack level to brown them.  We really liked them.

Good stuff!  I wanted a recipe that didn’t say “open a packet of taco seasoning” - this has all the right spices in just the right amount. Not a huge pepper fan so I cut that amount in half - otherwise this recipe is a keeper!

Works well.  Did 2 pounds chicken breast tenders with 3 peppers and 1/3 of a red onion.  Double spice, but maybe don’t double spicy spices.  Too spicy for me.

I love this new way to make fajitas! I am squeamish about marinating raw chicken and vegetables together so I followed the recipe but only marinated the chicken in a freezer bag for 6 hours. Since a lot of reviewers commented that there was not enough flavor, I put the peppers and onions in a big bowl and drizzled a bit of oil then sprinkled with the taco seasoning spices (from this site) before spreading on the cookie sheet. I spread the chicken across, baked for 12 minutes, gave a good stir then baked again for 12 more minutes but cranked the temp up to broil for the last 4 minutes. I put it all back in the big bowl, added the cilantro (an entire bunch) and the lime juice. Served with tortillas, salsa, sour cream and  cotija cheese. It was sooo good and I will definitely make again.

I took the advice of others and added more spice.  It is the best fajitas I've ever eaten.  My husband and daughter (6) said the same.  So easy and literally no mess to clean up.  This will be on regular rotation from now on.

This was such an easy recipe and very good too. 
I did stick to the recipe as written - just halved it and served with flour tortillas, salsa and avocado. 
The marinade was so simple to put together and the mix of spices and herbs were spot on. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe. Instead of putting it in the oven I cooked it on the stove top in a cast iron skillet. Ever bit as good as going to our favorite restaurant to get them.

These are a fave of ours.  The recipe is easily multiplied to serve a large gathering.  I cook the chicken in a separate pan from the veggies and that allows me to get the internal temps just right.  Also, I cut regular sticker breasts as opposed to using tenders...that allows me to make the veggies and chicken all the same size.

This is so incredibly easy and so good. So easy, in fact, I was able to make this in spite of my kitchen being in the process of being  remodeled.  We enjoyed every bite. Served with lots of pico de gaio and sour cream. YUM Thanks for such a versatile and simple recipe. I can see this in our future when the kitchen is finally finished. We may serve this at the house warming! I'm liking the simplicity and the fabulous taste. Easy to modify.

Not sure I can say I actually made this...but it was my intent to do so. I ran out of time so I grabbed rotisserie chicken and some peppers at the store and followed the ingredients list.  I sauteed on the stovetop, not baked as I was short on time. My family loved it! I'm thinking we would love the recipe made according to directions even more...so I WILL be making it again!

Really good! Everyone in family enjoyed. Spices were fairly low key (will add a bit more next time) - but that left everyone room to adjust to their liking with hot sauce or sour cream. Some ate them on corn and others on wheat flour tortillas. Will definitely make again.

The concept is great, the cooking time was good (although I added several minutes under the broiler at the end because I like the peppers and onions with a little bit of color on them). Sadly, there was very little flavor. I think next time I would use a store bought fajita seasoning and repeat the rest of the recipe as written.

I love this dish but of course I made changes. I usually use a packet of fajita seasoning mix, put oil, chicken, veggies in bag with seasoning, smoosh it around and put it in the fridge, sometimes overnight! Then I proceed as  per the recipe. I often forget the lime juice but it is still fantastic and such a fun meal. We serve with flour tortillas and bowls of toppings. I have done with steak but prefer this with chicken.

I usually make fajitas in a skillet, but this is so much easier. The recipe was great! I tweaked the amount of the various seasonings to my preference (I like more heat) and added sliced steak to the mix, but otherwise made this as written and it came out wonderfully. I turned on the broiler for the last few minutes, as other reviewers did, to brown everything and give it extra flavor. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this by the recipe exactly and there wasn’t enough flavor for us. The rest of the recipe is excellent and super easy. I will use my favorite stir fry seasoning only on the chicken and skip marinating, since it will be more like a rub and no seasoning will be left in a bag. A great week night dinner that my kids even love.

This is very good and super easy to make.  I added more chili powder and next time I think I will add even more along with more cumin.  I used only about 1/2 the oil recommended and I used olive oil.

I serve it with guacamole and sour cream and yellow rice.  Delicious!

My grandkids all cleaned their plates without complaint, even the 8 year old had who whined “Why did you mix it all up!?” before she tasted it. She will normally eat only raw peppers. I had half a rotisserie chicken to use, so baked the veggies for 10-12 minutes, then tossed in the shredded chicken for the last 5. I also had no foil, but it roasted nicely on silpat. Success in one pan!

This recipe is the best! It was easy, tasted awesome, and healthy. The trifecta of cooking. I followed the recipe exactly and the taste was delicious, the seasoning is perfect. I served it with a wheat tortilla, cheese, and sour cream.

This was good and a nice blend of spices. I created this recipe with wild turkey breast (sliced), marinated about 30 minutes. We put the finished fajita mixture in flour tortillas with sour cream and a squeeze of lime. Since I had about 2 lbs of turkey, I feel I could have gone a bit heavier on the spices, but all in all, this made a nice dinner.

This recipe has good bones, but I find it waaaay too oily and bland for my tastes. I’d recommend bumping up the spices, cutting down on the oil, and adding cubed tomatoes.

I have made this twice and I typically use two pounds of chicken.  I also make a double batch of the oil and seasoning.  I add that as I feel is needed in the marinating Ziploc.  I also broil at the end to give the ingredients a fajita look.

I made this for my husband twice now and it continues to be a hit! We love going out for fajitas but it's nice to stay in and save money. So far it's the closest to what we've had at restaurants! I even added some shrimp in there, paired it with some cauliflower rice and sprinkled Mexican blend cheese on top and it was delicious!!! Pro-tip: cut the chicken into strips as it cooks more evenly and soak up more flavor!

A little bland, but super easy. Next time I will double all of the spices, add more salt and turn up to 425 for more roast. The veggies were a little soggy. Love the concept of sheet baking. Thanks for the recipe!

Love it! For  2 children breasts, 2 big bell peppers,  and 2 medium onions I made double marinade, sliced chicken breasts on 0.5" thick slices, and marinated 15 min. Came out great, but next time will marinate longer.

I followed the recipe with only a couple of changes.  I used regular chicken breasts and sliced into small strips.  I added about a cup of apple juice to the marinade, doubled the seasonings but didn’t double the oil.  I also added some mushrooms.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, marinated for about an hour, and my husband and 	 loved it!  It made a ton though, so maybe next time I’ll cut the recipe in half.

We loved this meal.  I followed the recipe completely except for doubling the spice mixture.  The mix of seasonings was spot on.  I kept the cooked chicken warm when the time was up while I put the cooked vegetables under the broiler for a couple minutes.  This was so simple to make with ingredients usually on hand.  I served it with sliced avocados and Best Spanish Rice from this website.  I definitely can see making this recipe for guests, especially since everything can be prepared beforehand and then roasted in the oven for a quick 20 minutes before dinner.

This smelled great in the oven and tasted even better! I doubled the spices (not the oil though, and only 3 tsp of chili powder) and used 4 medium-small peppers, don't know how many cups that was. Served with chopped tomatoes and avocado wrapped in warmed tortillas.

Made exactly according to recipe. I believe that is the only way to give an honest assessment.
It was convenient. However for my family’s tastes it was a bit bland. For those who prefer milder flavors it is fine how it is. We like stronger, more intense flavors. Will make personal preference adjustments and try it again.

I forgot to take a pic, and there wasn’t time. My family devoured these sheet pan fajitas! Great recipe, easy to make and literally done in minutes! I added extra toppings for the tortillas, refried beans, sour cream and salsa, it was almost like a restaurant! Fun dinner.

Absolutely loved it! I made dinner tonight so my mom wouldn't have to cook or clean and it was so easy and delicious. Just a little reminder, if you use more chicken use more seasoning to the marinade because the flavor will be milder.

Pretty good and delicious.  The seasonings was just right. It almost tasted like I gotten it from a restaurant.  Had I more time to let the chicken marinate a little longer, it would of tasted better.  I cooked some Spanish rice to complete the fajitas.  I'm definitely making this again.

I love this recipe for its simplicity and flavor. It's also a diet friendly meal served with a whole wheat tortilla. My husband requests it often. I didn't change a thing

This was DELICIOUS! I did make a few changes - I added the lime juice and cilantro to the marinade and then cooked in a skillet. It was too dang hot to turn on the oven. This is the second time I've made this and will be doing so again soon!

Added lime juice and dried cilantro with the marinade. Didn’t really need to make it marinade. I just made marinade in a bowl and as I was slicing ingredients threw it in bowl and stir. By the time I was finished slicing it had to be at least 15 minutes.  Put it in oven when done slicing and it came out great.  One note, I only used 1 teaspoon of chili powder and no cayenne pepper and it still had a kick.

Made as written with the exception of homemade fajita seasoning from this site. Very tasty with salsa added on the finished tortilla roll. Never made fajitas before but will make again often.

My husband said this was the best Mexican dish I have ever made! It was so delicious, and simple! It will certainly be used again and again in my house.  Only changes I made, I used Saffron because I didn't have cumin and I added a cup of chicken broth to the marinade and cooked in a skillet on the stove. Amazing!!

So good!!!  I ended up cooking the chicken and veggies on separate trays and I cooked the peppers/onions 40-45 min so they’d get some color. I also cut the tenderloins in half length before marinating. Used in fajitas and also used in rice bowls as leftovers for lunch… Will definitely make again!

Made these for a Derby party and they were gone in no time! Followed other's suggestions to add a package of fajita seasoning to the recipe. Marinated the chicken separately using the fajita seasoning and used the recipe marinade for the veggies then mixed altogether for cooking. Delicious and easy!

This recipe was very tasty. Actually my girlfriend is the one that cooked it. I noticed toward the end, she had the fajitas in a frying pan. She told me the sheet pan just didn't brown it enough. Perhaps pans and ovens vary, but in the end getting a little extra browning in the frying pan seemed to work best. In any case the flavor was really good and the whole family loved them. We served them on mini street taco size flour tortillas with some avocado, sour cream and fresh salsa. This one is a keeper

We loved these!  I made them 3 weeks ago for the first time...and then again today! When I first made them, my husband asked me if I could "always make fajitas like this"!  Both times I used beef, and I did not use the cilantro (After checking at 3 different grocery stores, I gave up).  I don't like much spice, and they are perfect for me... my husband loves spice, and they are perfect for him.  Will definitely make again.

I made this last night. The only thing that took time was slicing the onions and peppers. Only 1 pan to clean up! I wrapped the flour tortilla's in foil and put them in the oven long enough for them to warm. Recipe was very good. I will make this again.

I did a triple recipe of these for a party and they were a hit. I marinated everything for 24 hours, because I was prepping food the day before. I thought the seasoning level was perfect, and it was really easy to throw everything together on a pan. I cooked mine on convection which helped brown things nicely. Will definitely keep this one around!

This was very easy. I agree with the other raters who said it needs more spices, though. Although I had read the reviews, I did not increase them because my kids do not like too many spices; however, I will increase them next time because it was pretty bland. All in all, a great recipe which is so easy to prepare and cook. I prepared it in the morning and cooked it for dinner. To be fair, I didn't use cilantro (don't like it) or lime (forgot), so perhaps the flavor really pops with it.

Made it on the stovetop in a frying pan. Came out super tender and perfect! The seasonings are great! I made about 1 1/2 times what the recipe called for and that amped the flavor up. I would recommend less oil, though. I love this recipe for meal preps on the weekends since it's so easy and I can use the chicken in fajita bowls, wraps, salads, or whatever I come up with. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great way to make chicken fajitas when the weather is too cold to fire up the grill.  I "supplemented" the chicken seasoning with a package of fajita seasoning because we like really spicy fajitas.  Also, next time I will spread the chicken and veggies on two sheets (as was suggested in other comments) to facilitate browning.

Wonderful recipe!  Very easy to make and the chicken comes out perfectly cooked at 15 minutes if it's cut into 1-2 inch pieces.  The only changes I made were substituting olive oil for the vegetable oil and using 1/4 tsp of crystalized vitamin C instead of lime.  My girlfriend is allergic to citrus fruit and Vitamin C a great way to get the lemon/lime flavor without the risk of going to the hospital.

Love this easy recipe. Only thing I did different was to add a pouch of Ortega fajita cooking sauce alongside the seasonings in the recipe. Will make again and again!

Loved these!!!  However, I did not use vegetable oil, instead drizzled EVOO, added slices of zucchini, chopped fresh garlic, lemon pepper seasoning, and a little less heat.  They were fantastic!  Have made these several times.  Yum!

Flavorful, and so good....I didn't change a thing....although when the pan came out of the oven I placed my fajita wraps on top of the fajita mix and heated the wraps....it worked out well.
Thanks and Happy Cooking!!!

I used prebought fajita seasoning instead but will try this next time. Roasting in oven turned out to be a time saver and it came out fantastic! I cooked a larger batch than recipe called for. Took 2 sheet pans so I'm did veggies and chicken separate but mix d together after. Thanks for posting it!

The Fajitas were great! The only thing I tweeked a little was using Chef Merito Chicken seasoning instead of salt. I'm definitely making this dish again!!

Delicious! Everyone in my family loved! I wrapped corn tortillas in foil and put them in the oven to warm the last 10 minutes of cooking. I love one-pan meals!

I used Fajita Seasoning, and it turned out great!  It had all the same spices and seasonings as the packet.  Delish!

I had 4 breasts so I doubled the spices, omitted the salt and cilantro, only used 2 tbsps canola oil. Marinated the chicken for 30 hours, sliced 3 onions and 3 peppers and spread them out on a parchment lined pan, then topped with marinated chicken. Tasty and fast fajitas, thanks!

Awesome fajitas! I pretty much made it according to the recipe but here were my modifications. First of all I used boneless chicken breasts because that's what I had. I butterflied them in half and then cut them into strips that were appropriate for fajitas. Additionally I didn't think the recipe makes enough marinade so I made more (about a half of another recipe). Also I marinated for more than 2 hours - I'm pretty sure you can let this marinate overnight if you want for that matter. Lastly, I'm not sure I used 4 cups of bell peppers because I don't really know how to reliably measure 4 cups of bell pepper slices. I just cut as much bell peppers as I thought was appropriate for the amount of chicken, which was about one and a half large peppers. This recipe would be great for a small dinner party because it's easy and can be made ahead of time - just bake it when your guests arrive and it will be ready by the time everyone is ready to eat.

This was really good.  I cheated and used frozen pepper strips.  Because of personal taste I didn't use the cilantro and lime juice.
