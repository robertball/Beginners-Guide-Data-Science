This is delicious! I made it as a dip for pita bread and it came out really well. I added shredded parmesan cheese just to finish it off. It was a huge hit!

I loved the concept! I had about 3 cups of store bought alfredo sauce I needed to use up and no idea what to do with it!!  Since the sauce was already prepared, I just used my food processor to shred frozen crab meat and frozen shrimp. I also sauted about 1 Tbsp of minced onion and a quarter of a green bell pepper, finely chopped in some olive oil. Mixed it all together, salt and pepper to taste, and YUM-O!

This tasted very bland. It lacked much of a seafood flavor as well as seasoning. All those juices I drained off should have been put to use somehow. I followed the recipe verbatim and at the end I was unable to resurrect it with additional flavoring such as Old Bay and additional seasoning salt or pepper.

Simple to make, but if you're using canned shrimp or crab you don't need to add more salt. I used frozen shrimp and this turned out wonderful. I agree it would be great on top of pasta!

Made it a little bit thicker and put it on toasted garlic bread.
