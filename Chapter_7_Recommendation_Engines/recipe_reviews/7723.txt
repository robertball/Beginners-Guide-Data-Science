Skip the flouring on the parchment paper.  Just spray the pan first, then put the parchment paper on top, then spray the parchment paper.  Other reviewer is correct - undercook at least 5 minutes less!! I then flipped it over on a pillow case with powdered sugar sprinkled on the pillow case (do this slowly so sugar doesn't fly everywhere).  Roll it up in the pillow case - let it cool and then unroll and fill.  For the filling I used 1 stick of cream cheese, 1 cup powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons of soft butter & 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Roll it up and put in tin foil and chill for at least one-hour.  Put on a plate and sprinkle it with powdered suger and serve.  I serve mine with whipped cream on top of each slice and then sprinkle a little cinnamon sugare on top.  YUMMIE!!

This was great & QUICK!!  You will need to undercook by 5 minutes so it will roll easier.  I substituted a Godiva chocolate recipe for the filling. And a raspberry liquor sauce to swirl on the plate.

Updated 4/8/12 - Variation that came out awesome!  

Substitute almond extract for vanilla and add 1/8 cup powdered sugar to whipped cream.  Put in refrigerator and let set while cake cools.

Roast walnuts for 10 minutes on 350 (or put in oven with cake roll).  Remove and let cool 5 minutes.  Put in food processor and grind up.  Sprinkle on top of meringue layer before rolling.

Serve with raspberry sauce.

I couldnt get cake to separate from paper, I let cool 5 minutes before putting it on the towel and trying to remove paper. Paper stuck completely to bottom of cake and tore when I tried to pick off. I greased and floured paper well so dont know what went wrong. Dog liked it, he doesnt mind paper peices. Maybe I did something wrong though.

Cake was not as flavorful as we would have liked.  It was also a little dry and cracked when rolled.  I added 1/4 cup sugar to whipping cream to sweeten and added melted chocolate over the top to add more flavor.  Was an "okay" recipe.

I was skeptical to try this recipe because of mediocre reviews, but I'm glad I did.  I used 4 eggs because that's all I had.  I didn't experience the cracking other reviewers did.  I oil-sprayed the pan, lined it with wax paper, then sprayed the paper.  When I took the cake out, I sifted powdered sugar on the cake, topped it with a clean towel backed with a plastic cutting board (for support), and flipped the cake onto the towel.  (The paper stayed in the pan!)  I took it to Bible study last night and everyone loved it.  I set it out half an hour before serving to soften the chocolate a bit.

I found this to be bland, dry and crumbly.  I have made many roll type cakes and just was not happy with the results.

I don't know what I did wrong, but when I tried to roll it, it stuck to the towel and cracked when I put the whipped creme in it.  All I ended up with was a big mess!

Well, props on the taste, but that's about it. I made this cake, and after letting it cool, I tried to unroll it from the towel. It completely stuck and broke up into pieces! I won't try this recipe again.

I have a chocolate roll recipe that I inherited from a Great Aunt and has been in our family for several generations. It has been my all time favorite dessert treat. I have never made it personally but am getting ready to try.  The recipe is rather lengthy but will try to post.Fingers are crossed!!!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY and it did not cook properly, it tasted terrible.  I tried to salvage it and rolled it up waiting for it to cool, but it was a not worth the effort.  I suggest trying another recipe.

So very disappointed in this cake. I know the "roll-up cake;" I make an AMAZING pumpkin roll and vanilla roll (if I do say so myself!) and I've been looking for a chocolate version. I NEVER have problems with my pumpkin and vanilla roll cakes coming off the parchment paper and rolling into the towel but this chocolate cake was terrible. It stuck to the parchment paper and then stuck to the towel even worse. Huge mess. I don't know what I could have done differently. I will NEVER make this again!!!

If you cut the baking time down by 5 min, you won't have an issue with the cake crumbling. To prevent the cake from sticking to the towel, you need A LOT of powdered sugar. Uses a flour sack towel or pillowcase instead.

This recipe left ALOT to desire... very time-consuming, many steps, and the result...?  The cocoa mixture did not blend well with the egg white mixture, leaving the final batter grainy. After baking, when rolled up in the icing sugar-dusted towel, the cake was so thin it just ripped all apart when trying to unroll.  This was very disappointing.

had a hard time seperating the cake from the paper and I followed the suggestions.  I would not recommend this or even try it again.  The cake was dry.  Not worth the effort.

Our family has been making this for four generations now as our special occasion dessert. it is light and not overly sweet. I always need to make 2 and wish I had made 3. We top it off with whipped cream, nuts and homemade chocolate sauce. making it with a stand mixer makes it quick and easy. My grandma always had us use wax paper for easy peel off and make it a day a head and keep in refrigerator. You can experiment with different fillings, chocolate mouse, cream cheese or cherry whipped cream.

My cake did not work out.  The finished produce tasted like egg whites and although I forgot to grease and flour my parchment, I do not think the cake was thick enough to roll.

Stuck to parchment paper.  Then it stuck to dish towel and fell apart when unrolled.  I had no choice but to make it into a trifle because I had the whipped cream ready.  I followed directions.  Won’t make it again

I bake a lot and this recipe didn't work for me at all.  I've made many cream rolls with great success , this one...UGH!   I do like to try different recipes that's why I tried this one.   Sorry to say this one, for me, had several issues. OH and I don't understand how the pictures are all from this recipe and look so VERY different.

Bland, no chocolate flavor whatsoever. Have made pumpkin rolls with great success. What a waste of five eggs! Also stuck horribly to towel.

My mom gave me this recipe and she used 6 eggs but leave 
them out until room temperature.  I use my big mixer and it's a lot easier. If you roll the cake part while still warm, it might be easier to roll but definitely refridgerate so the cream  stays cold. I use crisco on the pan and wax paper and it usually comes off pretty easy.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  Which is unusual for this site.  The flavor was bland, not nearly chocolaty enough. It also stuck to the parchment, despite liberally oiling both the pan and paper. It also stuck to the liberally powdered sugar towel!  The whipped cream to was way off in my case with it being  to soft and a bit mushy. ( Again, no instruction as to exactly what to add for the heavy cream, to turn out properly). I used 1 pint heavy whipping cream, added 6 tbsp.'s of granulated sugar and 2 tsp.'s vanilla.  What did others use?
Am I missing something here?  It is a hot day in June, maybe I should have made adjustments for weather? I seldom have this sort of trouble with the great recipes on this site.  Did I make some  major errors I'm not realizing?

Tasted great but cracked and fell apart to easily. Rolling it was a pain and it wasn't as thick as I expected. I don't know what went wrong >:(
