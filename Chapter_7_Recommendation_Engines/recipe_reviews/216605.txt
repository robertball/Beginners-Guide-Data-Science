I didn't want to run a huge slow cooker for a small amount of meat. For me, one pound of of chicken was two chicken breasts. I didn't bother cutting it into strips, I just cut each of the breasts in half and laid them in my smaller "dipper" crockpot over the frozen corn, sprinkled the (homemade) taco seasoning/flour mix over the top and poured the (organic) salsa over. I let that go all day until dinner, then lifted the chicken out and shredded it with two forks, then mixed it back with the sauce.. I sauteed the peppers (I didn't cook them with the meat as I didn't want them to be limp) with some onion and fresh garlic. When I made the wraps, I layered the onion/garlic/peppers on the tortilla, then spooned some of the chicken/salsa/corn mix over it, then sprinkled it with cheese. Surprizingly good. We all loved it, especially me because I didn't have to make a big production over dinner OR drag out the ginormous crockpot and it was an easy way to make fajitas. In a roundabout way, I guess. This is a keeper.

Makes a big batch, and you can vary the flavor a little based on what kind of salsa you use.  I use half of a bag of frozen "stir fry" mix (onions, red and green peppers) to save time, too.  We eat it over brown rice and leave off the cheese.

This was amazing and so full of flavor! I cooked it on high for 4 hours and added the bell peppers during the last hour.  Everything came out perfect! It made a large batch, but there weren't any leftovers because we couldnt get enough! DEFINITELY making this again...SOON!

Awesome! I used all the ingredients listed but I was w/out my slow cooker (that usually never leaves my counter!) so I baked this in the oven. Here's how it went down: 1. I used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (left them whole). 2. Mixed the flour, taco seasoning and corn together in a bowl along with the salsa. 3. I arranged the chicken and the sliced peppers in a lightly sprayed baking dish. 4. I poured/spread the salsa mixture over everything. 5. Baked it at 375 for 1 hour. 6. I added the mexican blend of cheese (just over the chicken breasts) with 20 minutes left on the timer. DELICIOUS. Everyone cleaned their plates! Will definitely be making this again!

I made this for the first time tonight and it was a hit!  Left out the corn.  Substituted an orange pepper instead of green.  Served over white rice with sharp cheddar cheese. Fresh cilantro on top.  Fabulous...can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow :)

Incredibly simply to make (especially if you use the stir fried pepper mix as a previous reviewer suggested).   Very tasty to eat.   Definitely a keeper.

This was a very pleasant surprise.  I don't typically care for chicken done in the crock pot-but this recipe is a keeper!  I have made it twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time I was in a hurry, so I did threw the chicken in whole and skipped the peppers.  I added a can of black beans instead.  It was delicious both ways.  I will definitely add the black beans again next time!  Served it over white rice.

The recipe was good but better once I made some alterations.  I used a package of the frozen corn,black bean, red and green pepper medley mix. This made it more like a Mexican chili.  I also used a package of lipton onion soup mix to my chicken before adding it into the crock pot instead of chopping all onions and this gave my chicken such flavor. I will make it again!

Excellent...will make it again!  Didn't have peppers but had a bag of frozen stir fry and used that.  Didn't have frozen corn but had a can of corn, so used that.  Served it over white rice and topped it with shredded colby/jack cheese!  We all loved it!

Five stars for flavor, ease and versatility. My teenager ate as a burrito stuffed wtih rice; my 10 yr old ate with rice (not mixed) on a plate; and my husband and I ate over lettuce wtih a dollop of sour cream.  Loved it even more the next day.

Not bad, but I made this at the last minute so, here is what I did.  I sauteed the peppers, onions and garlic, removed, then tossed the chicken with taco seasoning and flour, browned the chicken added back the pepper mixture, one can of diced tomatoes, once can of green chilies and corn.  Transferred everything to a baking dish, baked at 375 for 30min.  added cheese and baked another 10 mins.  This was good, but next time I would use beef and maybe add some jalapenos for extra spice.

Great flavors, not too spicy.  Next time I will add some jalapenos to spice it up a bit more.  It was still really good just the way it was.  I served it over brown rice.  Very tasty!

I will definitely be making this dish again...the ease of preparation was wonderful. It didn't even take me 10 minutes to get everything in the slow cooker. That being said, there were a few things I'd want to change next time. First, the bell peppers got very limp and soggy...I would put them in halfway through. Secondly, the flavor has a lot of spice from the taco seasoning and salsa, but not much flavor otherwise. I would probably add an onion and garlic next time. But, I did like it served over rice with pinto beans.

I really enjoyed this dish. I used chipotle salsa to give it a kick.  I agree, the salsa gave this dish most of it's flavor.  I served it with wheat tortillas, guacamole and sour cream.  I would make this again.

This was fabulous.  Changed a few things to match what I had and to make the recipe easier.  Used 4 frozen chicken breasts then shredded at the end.  Used a bag of frozen peppers and onions and added a can of black beans.  Served over rice with tortilla chips to scoop.  My son loved it that way but my husband would have rather had no rice and poured directly over tortilla chips.

This was a great easy recipe. It was a little too spicy for our tastes, so next time, I'll cut back a bit on the taco seasoning. Slow cooker recipes are great for those busy days when there is no time to spend in the kitchen.

This was an excellent meal.  The whole family liked it.  Did not change a thing!  It cooked longer than expected because I worked late.  The chicken melted in your mouth.  I served it over rice and the leftovers were just as good.

So easy!  DH loved it.  I subbed black beans for peppers, and used canned corn.  Used 2 frozen chicken breasts and cooked on high for 4 hours, then shredded the chicken and cooked for another 1/2 hour.

a friend of mine mentioned she slow cooked chicken in salsa and it was delicious so I looked for a similar recipe and found this one.  I wanted to try it even though I was not really sold on chicken cooked in salsa but the reviews were good... what a great suprise, it came out awesome.  Want to mention though, I had 2 types of salsa in the house... and I used the salsa that absolutely had a better flavor and aroma even though the other was chunkier as the recipe calls for.  I used tostitos restaurant style and the resulting flavor was great.  I would recommend using a great tasting salsa as I believe it made a difference overall.

I had to put together my own taco seasoning bc I thought I had some @ home. I was able to make my own from an allrecipes recipe.  I don't know if that also made a difference but homemade taco seasoning ingredients are ones that are common spices and I found I had all of them.  Maybe that made a difference!

Served over white rice which I now alway cook using Alice Waters boil and bake method instead of the traditional way to cook rice. The rice comes out fluffier and just tastes better.

This recipe was a nice suprise bc its very simple but turned out beyond expectations.

This is definitely a 5 star recipe based on how simple it is to throw together.  I did  modify the recipe based on what I had on hand.  I used a bag of frozen peppers and onions and  1 - 2 tbs of Tony C's Cajun seasoning (didn't have any taco mix). I made brown rice to go with it.  We ate this burrito style with sour cream, cheese, and shredded lettuce.  Was very good.  I do have to say it made more than 4 servings.  We are pretty hearty eaters and four of us ate it until full and still had enough leftovers for two of us to take for lunch.

Super easy but not my favorite.  I usually love corn, but not in this recipe so if I make it again, I will eliminate it.   I used 2 chicken breasts that were defrosted, so cooking time was shortened to 2 1/2 hours on high.  Chicken was super moist.

We make this all the time! 
I usually end up needing more salsa, but I cook it slightly different. I saute the chicken in a skillet, set it aside, then saute an onion and the peppers and add the chicken back to the pan. Then add the salsa and simmer covered for a little while. I usually forget to add the corn - but I try to add canned corn when we're getting ready to eat. 
I've served this as a taco salad (over lettuce and tostitos) and over rice. My 2 year old loves it :)

Pretty good as is and worth making, as it is so convenient to just dump it in the crockpot and let it go.  Didn't even have to stir it.  Personally, I will add some black beans and serve it with rice over a bed of crushed corn chips, adding some sour cream and lettuce.  Would also be good mixed with rice and wrapped up burrito style.  CAUTION:  will burn to your pot around the edges.  Would be good to spray it with some cooking spray or use the disposable liners!  That was the hardest part of the recipe, cleaning the pot.

This was good. The first time i used the slow cooker, and the second time i actually did it in a pan and it turned out WAY better! just heat up a tbsp of olive oil, fry your chicken, and add in all of the ingredients. I add 1/2 hot and spicy taco seasoning and 1/2 regular, and double the amount of it.
it doesnt need to be done in the slow cooker at all! :)

I honestly did not care for this recipe. While it was ok, I was expecting something far better from the previous comments.  I followed the recipe exactly (even doing the longer cook on low) but the chicken came out fairly dry, and the spices were completely overpowered by the salsa (mine was a medium heat Ortega salsa). Maybe searing the chicken first and adding more taco seasoning mix would help, but I doubt I'll be making this again.

This is pretty amazing.  I added a jalapeno and will probably use a hot chunky salsa next time, because I like a little fire, but this makes a great dish.  I served on warmed white corn tortillas with sour cream and a smear of refried black beans and kind of made burritos out of them.  Delicious!!!

Great filling for burritos!  I prepare it gluten free by using gluten free flour and using my own taco seasoning blend.  I prefer this over rice with a dollop of sour cream!

We are a military family so I love budget meals!  I bulked it up with a can of black beans and chopped chilis. I add much more salsa than recipe asks for because I shred the chicken. Served with tortillas, cheese, and fresh sour cream. The best part?! Leftovers freeze great :) xxx

My family loved this recipe. I modified it a bit, I browned the chicken in flour/taco mixture in a little olive oil on medium heat for about four minutes per side before putting chicken in slow cooker. I replaced corn with black beans. I omitted the cheddar cheese just to bring the calories down a bit. I added lemon zest and lemon juice while it was cooking. I went for 8 hours on low and the chicken was beautiful, tender and moist. Finally, I added fresh cilantro when it was almost finished. Served on a bed of rice. Awesome dinner and so easy! Thanks for posting the great recipe!

This was really awesome!  I had changed it a bit because I was busy and didn't know what I was going to make so here's what I did:  I put in frozen chicken breast with 3/4 cup of chicken broth (in slow cooker on high), after I found this recipe (45 min. later), I mixed it up with above ingredients.  I didn't have green peppers but I did have red and yellow, I also had 2 small skeins of green onions to use up and threw those in sliced along with a can of black beans.  After 4 hours on high, I broke chicken apart into small chunks, served it on flour tortilla topped with cheese and rolled it up burrito style.  Loved it, loved it, even picky I-don't-eat-vegetables-husband liked it (hates the black beans, but I saw he had a few rogue one's he didn't pick out).  This is a very versatile recipe!

Wow! I added diced green chiles, mexican style tomatoes, a fresh poblano pepper & a red bell. I used boneless skinless chicken thigh filets. I added fresh sliced avocado & sour cream after cooking! Better than in an restaurant.

This is a great tasting and super simple dish!  I added a pinch of cayenne pepper for a little extra heat, and served over rice.  My daughter and I loved it!

It was ok, tasted good, but I agree with Kate.S that it is like a chicken chilli. I ended up using one of those spoons with the holes in it to drain the liquid and used the filling in a wrap instead of on top of rice, which worked well.

Not sure if i will do this recipe again.

I am making this for Cinco de Mayo tonight. But because of an idea I have had I am making a few changes. If you have access to Papalotte Salsa use it. (It can sometimes be found at Whole Foods) It has a delicious creamy texture/flavor with a good amount of Spice. I am cutting back on the amount of taco seasoning so it won't interfere with the mouth watering salsa. One small onion will go in with the chicken at the beginning and I will put the peppers in about one to two hours before it is done. Plus a bit of sour cream in the last hour. I will serve with corn tortillas and avocado. 

Otherwise, as is, this is a quick and easy recipe. Enjoy!

Fantastic.  Followed recipe closely, except for substituting canned corn.  Will certainly make again and again.  I served over rice, but this would make a great filling for a burrito, or served over noodles.  It would also be a great medium for hiding quinoa.

This is a good and easy dish, but my kids thought it was too spicy.  I would make sure to use a mild salsa next time.  Instead of the taco seasoning packet, I used Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site.

I kept to the recipe, mostly, with the exception that I added a can of black beans.  This was the first time I used my slow cooker and everyone from my husband to my mom loved it. Probably wouldn't double it again but will definitely make again for sure.  Another reviewer mentioned doing this on the stove top and I will proably do that next time as it's just a matter of the meat cooking. Plus I think that browning the chicken first will keep it more moist.  A keep though, for sure.

I love this recipe!! I tweaked the recipe a bit by adding mushrooms and canned corn instead of frozen.  I also used hot taco seasoning to make it more spicy. I will definitely make this again.

I added an entire package of low sodium taco seasoning. I'm not sure if this is more/less than the 2T that is called for.  I thought it came out great and my husband and I enjoyed it.  I usually don't like the taste of chicken in a crock pot...sort of has a metallic type flavor to it...but not with this recipe, it was delish!

This dish makes a regular appearance in our house. I add a can of drained black beans to the original recipe and it's delicious. I serve over rice or with wraps. The kids love it; so easy.
