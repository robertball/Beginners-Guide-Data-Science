This was good but would have been better with a few alterations.  Mainly, I wouldn't have baked the rice with the fish.  My rice was cooked and when I put it in with the fish it ended up getting rather crispy in the oven.  I would mix the rice and heat it up on the stove to mix in the flavors and then serve the fish on top.

We love this so much because it is so simple and taste.  I did not have coriander seed so I did not use it.

Next time I'll cut WAY back on the coriander. It was overwhelming. I didn't make the rice as directed. My mango wasn't ripe enough and my rice wasn't cooked, so I added about 1/2 cup of mango chutney, some peach mango juice, and a tiny can of pineapple tidbits (juice and all) to the raw rice and adjusted the cooking water accordingly. The family loved it.

This was a really great way to serve salmon. I also cooked the rice mixture seperately to the salmon and cooled it as a salad type side dish, as well as adding raisins. The salmon just melted in my mouth and I enjoyed the fresh flavour of the mango and cilantro.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit! The mango really adds to the salmon. I made the rice with the salmon and it wasn't too crispy.

This was a very easy way to fix salmon.  I love salmon but get tired of traditional recepies.  The tropical flavor was great and reminded me of be back in the Bahamas.

I made it as directed (with brown rice). The coriander was mild and the flavor nice, but we didn't really like the texture--too crunchy. But the bigger issue was the rice. If I did it again, we'd cut the mango up very small and mix it with more rice. Instead of the tastes blending, it was just like chunks of mango mixed with rice.

This is my new recipe I'll pull out when I'd like to impress company, we loved it.  I cooked the rice seperately after reading other reviews since I wanted to use brown rice.  Our favorite part was the rub for the fish, the coriander paired really well with the fish.

Yummy new way to prepare salmon! 

I added half a can of crushed pineapple to the rice mixture. The pineapple juice really added great flavor & moisture to the salmon, not too fishy.

I made a combination of this recipe and the "baked salmon ll" from this site and it came out great! I cooked the rice separately and added the fresh cut mangos, chopped Cilantro and lemon zest mixture as a topping on the rice.

Good! Even my 9 year old liked it.  The rice got a little crispy on top but other than that it wasnâ€™t really good.

The sweetness of the mango in the rice and the brown sugar in the salmon was a little much. The rice is better with a little soy sauce added to it to balance the sweetness.

I served this to guests having not made it before.  It was simply delicious.  I did follow the advice of the reviews and added the rice for only about 10 miniutes at the end.  It was perfect. Rice was hot, but not crisp.  The coriander blend was so flavorful and light.  My guests absolutely loved it.

Here's what I did to eliminate the crunchy rice problem:  It is just 2 of us, so I used 2 (6oz) salmon portions.  I used a 11 X 7 glass dish and put the salmon in the center.  I mixed up the rice and put half on each side.  Then I covered both rice portions with foil, leaving the salmon exposed.  I baked it at 400 for 20 min, took off the foil and baked 5 min more and it came out perfect.  I used 1 tsp of each of the spices, using ground coriander, but would increase it slightly next time.

The seasoning on the fish was good. But putting the rice in the oven after it was cooked made it come out too crunchy and not a pleasant texture.

I used Tilapia and ground coriander instead of whole coriander.  It was OK and turned out fine, though I'm not a big fan of seafood.  I did need to bake it much longer than the recommended 4-6 minutes.  I also cooked the rice separately.

The family loved it.  I swapped out the coriander seed for pecans - making it pecan crusted.
