I dropped 2 stars for these reasons:  1.  Using powdered onion soup.  This is a form of processed food which is really unhealthy, and can be replaced with one onion and 1 tsp. of salt.  2. I love my slow cooker because of its ease and convenience - when all ingredients can be put into the cooker at the same time.  I find it excruciatingly annoying to have to go back every half hour and add something else (therefore making it ultimately pointless).  I did try this recipe putting everything in at once - and it was a truly good dish (on rice).

This is one of those recipes that only tastes as good as your spices.  Specifically, your curry powder.  I used Spice Islands curry powder for the first time and overall the dish just tastes nondescriptly spicy with kind of a curry flavor.  Looks like I need to find another curry powder!  It still tastes good though and physically it turned out beautiful.  My method was a bit different.  Dumped everything in the pot (only change was to cut back on the peppers and use a can of coconut MILK rather than CREAM since coconut cream is that super thick, super duper sweet stuff you use in cocktail drinks and find in the liquor store) including 1/2 cup of water and the carrots (I like my carrots cooked through and they would not have been if I put them in near the end), stirred it up, set it to low and came back 5 hours later to a lovely looking curry in a rich sauce.  All I had to do was add some salt and it was ready to pour over rice :)

Needs some tweaking, but it's a great dish.  I served over rice.  It's quite spicy for my tastes but my boyfriend (who handles spicy food well) didn't have a problem.  Here are the changes I made:

1. Used light coconut milk instead of coconut cream to make healthier
2. Used a whole 10 oz bag of carrots, didn't measure
3. Substituted 1 can chickpeas for 1 potato
4. Added some cauliflower (should prob be added with the carrots).
5. Added 1/2 an onion at the beginning

Additional changes I want to make next time:
1. Add an extra can of chickpeas for protein
2. Add a handful of peanuts or cashews at the beginning

With these adjustments - an awesome recipe!  Delish!!  Hint - spices will be cheaper at an Indian grocery store or in the international section of the reg grocery instead of with the normal spices.

Made this last night-added chickpeas and it was awesome!  I cooked it for 3 hours on high and served it with rice.  Can't wait to eat it again today for lunch!

Best Indian curry I've ever had... with a few changes. Like another reviewer recommended, I substituted 1 medium white onion diced and a teaspoon of salt for the package of dry onion soup mix. I also used three whole carrots, cut on a diagonal, instead of the matchstick carrots. I also cut the red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper by half, to 1/4 teaspoon each, which was the perfect amount of heat. I used coconut milk because I live in small town with no ethnic markets, and couldn't find coconut cream. Finally, I added about 1/4 cup of raw cashews. I put everything in the crock pot, and added an extra 1/2 cup of water, gave it a stir and cooked on low for 3 1/2 hours (didn't need to check and add water at all). I then tossed in 1/2 cup of frozen peas, and cooked with the peas for another 1/2 hour. Served with basmati rice and naan.

Very good!  I added a head of cauliflower too just because I had it and used one can of lite coconut milk then half a can of regular coconut milk (again, what I had laying around).  Also added some cashews with the carrots as well.  Will definitely make again!

I read this recipe and wanted to make for dinner but did not have slow cooker time.  I had potatoes already boiled and I cut carrots into matchsticks and steamed in micro.  I used coconut milk and veggie broth for the liquid.  I cut the pepper flakes and cayenne in half and the curry powder by about 1/3.  I left out the Lipton soup mix and sauteed one onion, and two cloves of garlic with the bell pepper in olive oil and then added all the ingredients and cook for less than an hour on low on the stove. I also added a can of garbanzo beans.  I added the peas, frozen at the very end.  We served it with a green salad and flat bread for dipping.  Everyone liked it and said they were glad that I cut down on the heat so they could enjoy the other flavors.

I love this recipe and make it frequently.  I like to use half russet potatoes and half sweet potatoes, and a diced onion rather than the onion soup mix.  I also add chickpeas.  I'm lazy, so I add it all at one time, and let it cook all day, and it works fine.

I read a lot of the reviews before I chose to make this for my bookclub.  I was a bit concerned due to several comments saying it was "tasteless."  Those cooks needed to add salt at the end - an ingredient that I believe was left out of the recipe.  Once you salt it enough, it has a great flavor with a lot of heat.  I also recommend adding garlic and real chopped onions to the recipe.

This one wasn't bad. Took off a star just because it took about twice as long to cook as the recipe stated. Made for some vegetarian friends the other night and was a big hit. Will probably make again.

Lovely combination of sweet and spicy! Four stars only because some of the ingredients weren't available as described  at my grocery store.

I made a few alterations:

My dad hates coconut, so to tone down the flavor I used coconut water instead of coconut milk, and added a tablespoon or two of cream of coconut to enhance the flavor. Both from Goya. 

Also, I could not find onion soup mix, so I used two onion bouillon cubes instead. I think next time I will use fresh onion and garlic with a dash of salt. I added peas as well.

Finally, I opted to try the carnivore version of this dish. I used sirloin tip steak and followed the authors preparation notes (fewer potatoes and lightly frying meat first). It turned out very tender and flavorful. We ate this over rice. Yum

Great recipe. Had to make some changes though...I had to add water to make sure potatoes cooked right, then took some of the curry sauce and mixed it with thickening flour and transferred it back to crockpot. Made the sauce much thicker and creamier. Also, don't forget to add salt, there is none in this recipe. Had to add more curry too. I added garbanzo beans also for extra protein which was a nice touch. Did not use onion soup but rather used onions instead. Good easy simple recipe. You could take this base recipe and add whatever you wanted.... A go-to recipe for me. Thanks!

In this recipe I replaced the potatoes with one large yam. After having read others' alterations, I added a can of chickpeas, chopped onion and vegi broth instead of onion soup mix, coconut milk instead of cream, 3 cloves of garlic, salt & pepper. I also added a pound of vegi ground 'meat', which I had briefly fried and spiced up with a bit of chili powder and salt, chopped almonds, and a handful chopped raisins, and topped it all with lots of chopped parsley at the very end because I don't like cilantro. I used less chili and more good indian curry powder. Other than sauteeing the onions, garlic and ginger, everything went directly into the slow cooker. Served over white rice. Very good, --- and healthy!

I found that this didn't have as much of a coconut taste that I would have liked. Although it had a nice "kick" to the spice, they all tasted a little bland and earthy. I have a much better curry recipe, that I use sweet potatoes and actual onions. I did ADD tofu and hard boiled eggs to this dish (tofu while it was cooking, and the eggs towards the end) I wish I could give a 1/2 star because I would rate it 2.5 out of 5. Not horrible by any means, but probably won't make this again.

Sooooo good!  I added chickpeas like someone else suggested and doubled the recipe.  I used 1 can of coconut cream and 1 can of coconut milk.  Would be excellent on rice.  I took it to a potluck and a man who grew up in India said he liked it!  Will definitely make again!!

I made a lot of modifications that I saw in other reviews--adding everything together at the same time, using onions and water instead of onion soup mix, cutting down the potatoes (only used 4 small ones), adding chickpeas (1 can), and adding salt and pepper which I don't see in her recipe.  I'm not a big fan of salty food, but this recipe needs A LOT otherwise it's really bland.  It was really, REALLY good with the modifications that I made above. I gave the recipe 3 stars because of all of the modifications needed. It also took longer to cook--at least 4 hours on high in my crockpot so keep that in mind.

Easy and Delicious!!!!
I added cubed skinless chicken breast and fresh cubed pineapples.
I also just added everything to the crockpot at once, not par-cooking the chicken first.
I also used the low fat coconut milk (not a creamy, but does the trick for less calories).
I cooked on HIGH for 4 hours and it turned out great!
I also added FRESH onions, not onion mix, as it is always better to do a natural veggie substitute.
*Note: Goes great over brown or Jasmine rice cooked w/ cloves & peas!!

This was fairly bland. It needs something with deeper flavor, but I'm not sure what it needs.

I did not care for this recipe..  I am a very experienced cook, and I cook mostly ethnic dishes (african, middle eastern, asian, etc), so this was right up my ally - so I thought.  I followed the recipe exactly, adding chickpeas, and after 5 hours of cooking, it simply did not turn out. This is the only dish I've ever came across that can't be tweaked to make it any better.

The peas are not optional for this in my home, as they make the dish, IMHO. I was surprised by how much I valued having cut the carrots in a match stick fashion! The texture was perfect, though I guess I should admit that I did add extra coconut milk (used milk, not cream).  The directions for this recipe are clear and were easy to follow, however, I need helping coming up with an alternative to store bought curry powder, which is going to be important for me to finally really love this dish.  I'll be trying some other 'curry' spices in time, or at least, I hope so, as I did almost thoroughly enjoy this dish.

Very Yummy! It is true this recipe will be only as good as your curry powder, don't skimp on this. I followed other reviewers recommendations and used a fresh onion with a teaspoon of salt and a clove of garlic.  No coconut cream on hand so I used coconut milk. I cooked this whole deal in the oven in my dutch oven. Turned out fantastic!

This is a great start, but like most people here, of course I made some tweaks! I substituted chopped onion, salt, and a splash of soy sauce for the onion soup mix and replaced one potato with a drained can of chick peas and a handful of raw cashews. I halved the red pepper. When adjusting the flavor after cooking, I added a light drizzle of honey.

Also might be useful to know: I prepped this the night before, except for the water,  and stored it in the fridge. At lunchtime the next day, I pulled it out, added half a cup of water, and let it cook slowly until dinner time. Perfect.

I'm crazy about curries and divided the leftovers into single serving containers for my lunches. They freeze well for a short time; the potatoes get a little mushy but the flavors are even better on reheating. When I make it again this week  I'll use 2 sweet potatoes and some chopped red-skinned potatoes (which remain firmer after cooking and don't need to be peeled) in place of the russets. I'm also going to stuff in more bell peppers if there's room in my crock pot -- this recipe fills it to the top.

This was really tasty. Added 5 cloves of garlic and some shrimp, although any protein will do. Might try it again with tofu or chickpeas. Couldn't find onion soup mix so I used dehydrated onions. Next time I would just go ahead and use a whole onion and some veg broth instead of water if needed. Used light coconut milk and salted to taste. Got hungry so moved it to the stove to finish cooking. Opted against serving it with rice as it already had a lot of potatoes, but would be nice served with a garlic nan.

Just o-k.  It would need a lot of "tweaks" to make it yummy.  I've made many a superior curry this will not be joining my recipe box.

This is a solid dish -- worked well served over rice when my spice-loving vegetarian friends came over.

I used a fresh onion instead of the powder, plus I added half a teaspoon of cumin.  I also poured 1/3 to 1/2 a can of water in the slow cooker as the meal started cooking so I didn't have to worry about it drying out.  Chopped cilantro was the perfect garnish -- really rounded out the flavor!

If I do it again, I might add more of a variety of veggies, or perhaps some tofu.

I made this today and it is delicious! The coconut cream sweetens the curry, which is nice. I used Yukon gold potatoes and didn't peel them, just scrubbed and cubed.

I used light coconut milk instead of coconut cream and omitted the onion soup mix in favor of fresh onions and dried onion powder. This smelled so good while it was cooking and didn't disappoint when it was finished. I added a bit of salt right before it was done cooking because I noted other reviewers saying it lacked flavor. I know that spices can be muted when cooking in the slow cooker, so a pinch of salt right at the end really brings those alive again. Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty but WAY too spicy!! Too much cayenne & crushed red pepper.  I read other reviews & also added an onion & salt instead of soup mix, chickpeas, used coconut milk (can) instead of cream, & served it over cous-cous.  It also took a lot of time to make this.  The potatoes weren't cooked all the way even though I turned it to high for the last hour.  It did taste very good though, despite being too spicy (hot).

I wanted to like this but one can of coconut cream was way too sweet. Added some sea salt to cut the sweetness but found the peas and carrot sticks of odd texture with the rest of the veggies. Maybe coconut milk and omitting the peas and subbing  chopped carrots would be better.

Great recipe. My husband found it a bit too spicy, so if you prefer a milder spice level, you might need to decrease amount of red pepper flakes or cayenne powder. Also, the coconut cream was a little too sweet. I'll try coconut milk next time.

Good enough to make again. I used 3 unpeeled russet potatoes and one large sweet potato. Added about a tbsp of cumin to the spice mix. Added 1/2 each of green and red pepper, 3 cloves of chopped garlic,  onion soup mix, chopped Vidalia onion and 2 cans of coconut milk. After a couple of hours in the crockpot I added about a cup of cauliflower, the carrots and about a cup of homemade veggie broth. After another hour I added the peas and about a cup of salted cashews.   All in all it took about 5 hours in the crockpot. Actually I think you could add all ingredients at the start and let it go. Because of the added ingredients, I would add a bit more curry but keep the rest of the spices the same.

Added double curry, 50% more cayenne for a kick, left the carrots cooked al dente, and everything was perfect in 3 hours 20 minutes, delicious!! Would also recommend leaving it thicker with less water - sticks to your ribs!

This was the first time I had made ANY TYPE of curry, so it was a little scary for me...lol!  But it turned out so good! I will be making it again! 

I did read the changes that others had submitted and decided to do a little bit of everything. I added peas, chickpeas, more curry, only one can of coconut milk and skipped the red pepper flakes. I did take some of the curry mixture and mixed with flour to thicken it up, but next time I will probably skip that step or use an extra can of coconut milk. It was spicy just using the chili powder, curry and cayenne pepper. But I gave some to my friends (who love spicy food) and they LOVED IT!

Use at most half of the curry, red pepper flakes and cayenne. I used half and it was still nearly inedible--I calmed it down to save it with an extra can of coconut milk and a few teaspoons of honey. Also added 2 cups of unsalted cashews and 2 cups of canned chickpeas--added them with the carrots and they were the perfect consistency. Threw some spinach in there also but did it too early and it vanished.

I'm really shocked that this has gotten such great reviews!  I made it last night and did not like it!  1/4 c of curry powder was way too much, the flavors never melded or got creamy.  You could actually taste the powder of the curry, it wasn't bland, but it really missed the mark, it didn't work at all.  

I hate throwing away good ingredients, and only do in the worst cases but it was that bad!

Not good at all.
I'm a big fan of Asian cuisine and I never had a worse curry than this. it wasn't creamy and it had a bad taste. it can't be the spices because I don't use cheap spices or imitations. I use McCormick or the lose spices from the fresh market. after I tasted it I tryed to "rescue" my dinner. I added ginger, sweet soy sauce, fresh garlic and salt. it turned out well.

Good, but not great! Needs a bit of a lift. I made a lime juice, garlic, hot pepper and fish sauce dressing (from another curry recipe) and that helped. I think I'll stick with my old recipe (even if it isn't slow cooker friendly).

There are too many potatoes.   I did not have enough room in my crockpot for all of the ingredients. 

If you are going to put the ingredients in the crockpot and leave for work, I would recommend using whole carrots and not shredded carrots.  

I used the alternative of using fresh onion and salt instead of onion soup and I added chickpeas.  I think those are good suggestions.  

I think a curry recipe that I have that is made in a dutch oven is much better.  I tried this as I hoped it would be easier.

Amazing just as written.  I rarely like anything I cook.  Hubby usually does that because he’s the chef in the house.   However, this was foolproof!   Can’t wait to make it again.  Work from home and all of my clients remarked on how delicious it smelled and begged to have some. ??

Made it for a crowd and they loved it.  I only used 1/2 of the cayenne and chili powder and found myself still reducing the level of spicy taste by adding a couple tablespoons of sugar, almond butter and then vinegar.  Also added the garbanzo beans which was good.  I did not have coconut cream so used powdered coconut cream and it was great.  A definite do again.

Excellent. Flavor good and produced lots of creamy gravy. I made according to recipe except didn't have coconut milk on hand. Substituted with water + pure coconut oil.  Next time will try another reviewers suggestion to substitute onion soup mix with onion + salt.

I agree with others that the curry powder is key. I used McCormicks organic and it had no flavor so I'm on the hunt for a new bottle.  Also I made it with coconut milk once and then with cream the next time...the cream (unsweetened) made a big difference and I will use it from now on. Also will cut back on the cayenne.

Loved this. Next time I'll add more pepper flakes because we like things really hot, but otherwise wouldn't change a thing. My husband said it tasted as good as anything we've ordered in our favorite Indian restaurant (I'm not sure I totally agree with him, but it was delicious).

Added some tofu for protein.  It smelled really good while cooking, and had a good flavour but I think maybe mine needed a little more salt.

This is an easy and flavorful dish!  Lots of spice (I love) so for those who prefer a little less spice, cut back on the cayenne and curry.  Served it with brown rice; delicious!

My husband liked it, but the kids and I couldn't take the heat! He didn't think it was very spicy at all and actually added more cayenne, but no one else ate more than a bite. Good taste and easy to make.

Good flavour to this recipe. I followed the other reviewers' suggestions for replacing the soup mix with an onion. Will make again.

I liked the vegetables and made my own coconut milk for this dish, but it turned out kind of bitter. I don't know what  I did wrong, but maybe it the curry powder I used.

I used half the spicy ingredients because of all the people who commented on how spicy this was; I like spicy food and this was about at my threshold with half the spicy stuff in it that the recipe calls for. I also found, as another reviewer indicated, that, at least for the first couple days, this didn't taste like anything except the spices I'd put in. the flavor of the vegetables started to come out around day three, but up until that point I could taste nothing except chili powder and cumin.

Very nice! Made this on the stovetop in about 1.5 hours since using the slow cooker didn't work with my schedule today. Really liked it, as did the two other people who ate it. Just has a nice flavor and warmth. I'll definitely make this again!

I used half coconut cream/half coconut water to cut calories but otherwise followed recipe exactly. This is DELICIOUS! And super easy to make. It made a huge portion which we plan to eat all week for lunches.  Thanks for sharing!  Btw it has a hearty kick.... I might use less cayenne/red pepper flakes in the future.

Only thing I changed was that I added extra red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper because my husband likes really spicy things.

My family and I liked this recipe. As I am a wimp when it comes to spicy food, this was a brave choice for me but I am glad that I did it. I did cut down on the cayenne pepper and didn't add red pepper flakes at all. Turned out perfect. Next time I make it though I will plug my crockpot in outside on our patio because the curry stank up my house for a few days afterward :)

I didn't use soup mix, just a quarter purple onion, and added sugar snap peas halved.

Pretty darn good, I must say.  My first run at curry in a crock pot, and I only used 2 potatoes because I threw in a whole chicken to simmer.  So the coconut milk was not enough for this amount of food, so I used 2 more cans to be able to cover the majority of the chicken (3 cans total of coconut milk).  I also made a total of 1.5 times the spice mixture because of the extra food compared to baseline.  I used the prior suggestino to use diced onion (used dry, not fresh), and then a sprinkle of garlic sauce.  Tasted great.  Threw a little bit of red dal in, and then cooked up some Pad Thai for the curry to be served upon.  My 12 year old daughter really digged/dug it!

it was delicious! I boiled some broccoli on the side and threw them in a few minutes before the curry was done. It was amazing!! I also added slices of onions that I sauteed with olive oil and threw that in the curry at the end.  I added some soysauce and definitely ate this with some jasmine steam rice :0)
