I already had this recipe from when I was a Brownie! 
What I love is that it is so fast, so easy, and Kids can make it...no cooking!
And I love the cream cheese taste. But be warned, this is more the texture and taste of stiff frosting rather than cooked fudge.

This was surprisingly good for an easy, no bake fudge.  Iâ€™m way past the sprinkles stage so I added walnuts which I love in my fudge.   This recipe makes a small batch of fudge, just enough to satisfy your sweet tooth.
