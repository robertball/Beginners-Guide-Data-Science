This is a tasty and easy to make dish and accomodates many variations. I made it following the recipe with the following changes:
— Didn’t have allspice so used Chinese Five Spice. 
— Added one tablespoon of minced red onion. 
— Added a splash of Red Boat Fish Sauce. 
— Used homemade chicken broth for liquid
— Added a handful of arugula because I had it on hand
— Added about 1 tsp of crushed red pepper
We had it for brunch and it was very satisfying. My husband suggested adding sliced sausage next time. I am going to use the remainder as a side dish for roasted duck breasts.
