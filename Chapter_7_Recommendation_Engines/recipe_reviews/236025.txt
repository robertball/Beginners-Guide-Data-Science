We all LOVED these! I did use 1 tablespoon of butter instead of 1 teaspoon, and more salt and pepper than called for, to taste. I was so happy with how crispy ans tasty these turned out. The family is already asking when I'm gonna make them again...A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made these in my cast iron skillet and used a full tablespoon of butter. They were wonderful! I had a rare evening with just 3 of us to cook for and this was easy enough.  I don't think I would make this for the whole family (7 of us and teenagers who eat like there is no tomorrow) as it would take a lot of time standing at the stove working in batches.

I made these with Red Potatoes and they worked great. Need to adjust the temp so they cook with burning. Thankfully I like my fries crispier than most.

These turned out great and I will definitely be making them again. It was harder than deep fried fries and I had to turn them all individually and keep watch over them to get evenly cooked sides. I had some confusion understanding how to cut the potato into 1/2 inch circles. My husband didn't like these at all but he isn't a french fry fan. I loved them and made 3 potatoes for the 2 of us and it was just right. Thanks Miskyn, these were great!

These turned out really great! I used to bake our homemade fries but in the summer when it's hot & I don't want to heat up the oven I was looking for an easy stovetop version. I found this recipe and I like it even better!!

Made these in our cast iron skillet while camping, nice and tasty and easy for two people. Made again and used red potatoes, seemed to cook faster with red potatoes, although I didn't time it. You do need to keep stirring to evenly cook and I got pretty hot doing that...much better cooking outdoors.

I started off using the olive oil/butter but decided to refill with peanut oil.  These were delicious and easy - it didn't take 20 mins for each batch.

Perfect stovetop fries. I usually like to roast my potatoes but this will be the recipe I reach for when I want them fried on the stove. Thanks so much for posting :)

Made this 7/17/19 to use up some red potatoes that were  starting to get soft.  I didn't measure the oil or butter--just eyeballed both and put in what I thought would be half as I was only going to cook so many of the potatoes I had pared and cut up.  They turned out pretty well.  I put a lid on the pan and set the timer in 5-minute increments so I could check on them and flipped them about halfway through.  I didn't have the cracked pepper or coarse sea salt so just used regular salt and pepper (although I normally don't put pepper on potatoes).  Will make these again.

I added a teaspoon of garlic during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Delicious and so easy to prepare.

Very good. Works well with spiced oil. You don't really need the butter, but you can add it if you want. We added a tablespoon.  Very quick to cook, faster than expected. Overall very enjoyable.
