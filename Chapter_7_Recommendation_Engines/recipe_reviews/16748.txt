This recipe, in it's completion, was worth four stars but here's my kaveot; IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PRESSURE COOKER FIND A DIFFERENT RECIPE!!! Contrary to the little side note about cooking your peas for a few hours if you're sans pressure cooker, this recipe took me the better part of a day and a half!  I ended up using almost three cartons of stock!  As I said, it was tasty but not particularly convenient.

I liked it better made with ham stock instead of
chicken stock.

I loved this and even my split-pea-hating boyfriend was happy to eat it several times so it can't be bad. All the veggies gave it a nice complexity. It comes out pretty thick though, not very soupy. (Which is not necessarily a bad thing.) The leftovers thickened up so much in the fridge that I served them as a chunky spread on baguettes. Enjoyed it a lot both ways.

Delicious, nutritious, easy and my girls loved it.  I had to add more chicken broth though and didn't have the chervil - it was good anyway.

Delicious.  I made it in a pot on the stove rather than in a pressure cooker.  Needed more water/chicken stock but that is just the cooking method I think.  Was making this for me not kids so I added some Louisiana seasoning, really gave it a lift.  Thanks so much for posting.

Well, the kids (2 and 4 yrs old) were not crazy about it, but my husband was, me too, so maybe this will appeal more to "big kids".  I had to add extra liquid for re-heating, and pureed everything.  Also used ham instead of backon.

I LOVED this version of Split Pea Soup!  I did it in the pressure cooker because I didn't have the time to wait using the conventional method.  I needed extra liquid and used both organic chicken and vegetable broth during the cooking of the potatoes, carrots and spices.  Also, I did not have any Chervil so I used 1 tsp of tarragon and 1 tsp of parsley in its place.  Came out great!  Loved it!  Thank you!

well, I subbed a diced ham steak for the bacon, and used sodium free stock since I was making this for someone on a VERY low sodium diet. The flavors were actually much clearer w/o the salt, but I added a little to my serving. Really good ingredient portions!

I basically make the same soup in the oven. Add a ham bone (or not),  2 1/4 cups of split peas, 8 cups of water, veggies and spices, bake covered 2 hours at 350, do not peek. Take out of oven, blend or use immersion blender, add Kielbasa or ham, bake 30 mins more. I do not add potatoe's.

Yummy!  Even without the potatoes,  chiver or salt/pepper, and with bacon replaced by smoked ham leg (boneless, diced). I used 4 cups vegetable broth and one cup chicken broth. This was my first recipe with the InstantPot pressure cooker (actually, any pressure cooker!), but kids and wife loved it, that says a lot. 

Next time I will try adding the carrots and potatoes at the same time as peas because I needed 2 cycles of 8 minutes after the peas were cooked. Carrots will probably be a little on the soft side but still will be yummy and simpler/faster to cook all at once.

Note the recipe does say to add water/broth till desired thickness and you will like have to do that too (hence the cup of broth I added). 

A definite success!

I've made this recipe several times in the pressure cooker and it's delicious! I use 8oz. diced ham instead of bacon. Otherwise I follow the recipe.  When reheating the soup for leftovers, it's necessary to add a little water to thin it down, but that's nothing to worry about.  Even my vegetable-hating teenager likes it!

Loved this. Used parsley instead of chervil. This makes more like 8 - 10 servings, not 4 - 6.

I don't have a pressure cooker, so I cooked on the stove, and it took about 3 1/2 hours.  If you are using this method, give your potatoes and carrots more than 15 minutes, as the soup is very thick and simmering doesn't cook the veggies enough in just 15 minutes.  I subbed 1 t. tarragon for the chervil (I don't care for chervil.)  It did require A LOT of thinning down.  It was okay.  Nobody objected to eating it.  But the flavor wasn't anything special.  I think I could tweak it to make it more to my taste, but I didn't like it well enough to try.  The potatoes and carrots do give it a nice substance though.  If you are a fan of pea soup, give it a try.  (I can't imagine this being a kid's favorite though.  My kids were not picky eaters, but I'm sure they would not have cared much for this soup as children!)
