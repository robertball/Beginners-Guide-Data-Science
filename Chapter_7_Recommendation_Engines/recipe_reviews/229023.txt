This is one of my most favorite breakfasts to make for my family. I like to use turkey meat that I spiced up to taste like pork sausage ((rubbed sage, marjoram, brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, basil red pepper flake, salt/pepper), chunky salsa verde and shredded pepperjack cheese. My family inhales this whole pizza. I usually serve this with home fries and a fruit salad.

Tasty! We were limited by what we had in the house. We didn't have sausage, only bacon. We baked some tater-tots, cut them in half and added those to the pizza. We only had 6 eggs and 1 pkg of crescents, but it still fit well in a 9x13.  We sauteed some garlic and onion and mixed in with the eggs. This is really versatile to what you have on hand.

This was really tasty and easy to do.  I used my home made salsa and used good quality crescent rolls.  The best thing was that I had every thing in my pantry.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Great and easy breakfast dish! I used a 9 by 13 dish,  one crescent roll package, half the bacon, sausage and eggs and it still stood really high. It fed our family of four for breakfast and lunch. My three year old had two pieces at lunch!
Note: I put the salsa (homemade) through a strainer so it wouldn't get the crust soggy.

Awesome and easy... The kids loved it .. We used a whole package of bacon and a whole roll of pork sausage instead. The pork sausage is easier to crumble in the pan and then spread on the pizza. We also did not use salsa since the kids didn't want it... It worked out fine without it . We also only cooked the pizza an extra 8 mins at the end instead of for 10 . Overall great recipe!

I fried bacon and sausage the day before so I only had to warm them slightly in the a.m.   It was very easy to put crust together and scramble eggs while it was in oven.  I would add pepper and onions to eggs.   I increased salsa to 3/4-1 cup.   I also think a mix of cheddar and Monterey jack would be good.  Everyone loved the recipe and I will definitely make it again.

using salsa in place of pizza sauce was the whole reason i chose to use this recipe as inspiration for a super hearty breakfast.. i used the equivalent of an entire package of bacon.. no sausage.. whole wheat pizza dough.. four extra large eggs that i pan fried sunny side up... and a mixture of irish gouda-like cheese and sharp cheddar.. i cooked the crust first almost all the way through.. spooned some generic salsa over it.. sprinkled a very thin layer of cheese.. topped with the eggs and bacon.. then more cheese.. popped it in the oven to melt and then proceeded to inhale.. ty for the direction i needed

Yum! Family is not into syrupy sweet  breakfasts so this was right in our favorites.  Didn't have much cheddar cheese but substituted co- jack and since it is all gone it was a hit.

This was very good! I recommend sprinkling green onions on top just a few minutes before it is done baking. The pop of green is pretty & the flavor of the onion complements the dish. Next time, I'll fry up the meats the night before to save a little time in the morning.

Made the recipe pretty much just as described but I only had Honey Butter Crescent Rolls.  The bit of sweet was amazing ;) but I'm a girl that likes my breakfast to be sweet.  Thank you for the recipe - the baking times were spot-on and nothing was burnt or soggy!

The kids went crazy for this meal.  I will try it with bulk sausage next time instead of cutting up link sausage.  Delicious
