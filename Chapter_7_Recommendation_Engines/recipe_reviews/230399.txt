I had to completely revamp my review.  Immediately after making these brownies I really didn't care for them and said so.  However, 12 hours later the flavors have melded and the mint isn't so raw and they are actually quite good.  I still think there is too much sugar in the recipe along with the chocolate syrup and suggest only using half as much.  I am glad I went back for another taste.  Thank you, Madison, it's always fun to try a new recipe.
