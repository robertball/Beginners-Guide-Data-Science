Have to admit I subbed seeded jalapenos for the bell peppers...but this has to be one of the most refreshing salads ever.  It has a very clean and bright flavor...and since I used olive oil instead of canola...has to be healthy as well.  The perfect summer side dish!

I loved this.  It's simple, tasty, refreshing.  It's been great to have this in the refrigerator as a snack during the day or as a side for dinner.  It's turned out to be pretty filling too.  My wife was very impressed with me, so that was a nice bonus.

Loved this! Only used 2 cans black beans and added a can of Mexicorn.  Also didn't have bell peppers so added a can of diced jalapenos.  I love cumin and chili powder so I used about a 1/2 tsp of each.  Delicious!

I found 16 oz. of orzo was way too much for the mixture to not taste like all orzo.  Also chopped fine 1/2 of a large jalapeno (because we like it with a little kick). 5 limes doesn't really tell me how much juice - so I juiced 5 limes and it was a scant 1/2 cup. I added an extra 2 limes, juiced and a 1/2 tsp. garlic salt and 1/2 tsp. cumin. Think it will be really tasty after it sits in the refrigerator for a few hours or over night.

What a great summer salad! It was time consuming to make but so worth it! I couldn't find orzo so I used another small pasta and it was fine. I found that the lime was very strong after making the salad so I added another tablespoon of oil (I used grapeseed oil) to mellow it out and added about 1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar. Salt and pepper to taste. Perfect! Will be serving this with Spicy Lime-Cilantro Marinated Flank Steak from this site.  Updated: THis was even better the next day. I cut up the left over steak that I served it with and mixed it into the salad and had it cold the next day and I liked it even more! Very fresh!

This was an excellent summer side dish.  It was better the next day and after than when first prepared.  Everyone loved it and wanted more.

This is a fresh, colorful salad.  As others have mentioned it is a little bland so I added some cumin to the mix to give it more pizzaz.

I thought this was really good, making just a couple small changes to suit our tastes - namely, halving the amounts of green and red onion, adding a minced jalapeno, and adding a bit of cumin.  I was a little nervous about using the full amount of cilantro, but I did and it was fine.  Made a second, smaller batch later using just black beans and adding avocado - that was good, too! :)

This salad had a light, refreshing taste although it was a bit bland for my husband's taste.  It was actually better the next day when I added a little more oil, a squeeze of lemon and some salad shrimp.  My husband simply doused it in peppercorn ranch dressing...not a bad recipe at all.  I think I'll make it with black olives next time!

I took this to a potluck with Chinese friends and they all loved it since it was a different flavor than they usually get. It does make a lot but the bowl was empty when I took it home!  I didn't have yellow peppers so just skipped them. I used olive oil and stirred it into the pasta before adding anything else so it would be easier to mix in the other ingredients. I gave this 4 stars because it seemed a little bland.  I added a couple teaspoons of spicy mexican chili powder and a little cayenne which gave it just the punch it needed. As others suggested, I made it the day before so the flavors could blend better.  I'll definitely make this again!

I halved the amount of orzo, and also added a can of Great Northern Beans. I used half of the amount of corn and had to use dried cilantro (all I had). I omitted the salt, and added cumin, dried red pepper powder, and garlic powder. For those of you looking for more flavor, definitely add cumin and chili powder (I was out of the chili powder unfortunately). If all else fails, throw in an envelope of taco seasoning! I can't wait to taste this one (only 1 hour and 43 minutes to go, minimum....). Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this dish according to the recipe many times and I love it!  When I want more protein, though, I substitute quinoa cooked in vegetable broth. I have also added crumbled feta or small cubes of monterey jack cheese with jalapeno for a slightly different twist.

Very refreshing....Love the texture that the peppers and onions add.  I did find it to be a little bland until I added the 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 teaspoon chili powder.  Makes a huge bowl so it is perfect to take to a potluck/get together.

This is a colorful salad that has an immediate eye appeal.  My family ate it all and asked for the recipe.  Because cilantro was not in season here, I added powdered cumin instead.  It was a hit!

A little too much onion for my taste.  I would omit the red onion and use only the green next time.  And it makes enough to feed an Army.

Easy to make and store, although you will not be storing it for long.

Very Very Good!  I added a teaspoon of cumin to give it some extra flavor.  I also replaced the chickpeas with a can of northern beans that I drained and rinsed.  Great salad.  Makes a hugh bowl great for pot lucks.

this was a fabulous recipe but it makes a lot!!  The onion flavor over-took the taste of the salad so I would use half the amount of onions.

We loved it! Next time we're gonna chop the onions a little more fine just 'cause their flavor tends to be more pronounced, but everyone was really happy with this one.

Very good the next day, its a must you let it sit over night.  It also makes a lot so if you want to make less use one less can of beans and half the orzo.

This was awesome! I took it to a party...I was shocked to see it all gone went I went to pick up the bowl at the end of the night.  I've had several people ask for the recipe.  I did add a pinch of cumin. And for a regular family serving I would only use 8 oz ozro if that, it makes a lot, and lower the quanity of some of the other ingredients.

Great! I made a few changes, though. I used olive oil instead of canola oil. I didn't use any chickpeas, or onion. I also used frozen, thawed corn instead of canned corn. It tasted really great! This is my family's new favorite side dish for our Mexican food nights.

I added black olives instead of chickpeas. I think if I add a little more cilantro this will be a five star recipe.

Nice salad. The dressing component seemed weak so I used about 1/3 c. italian salad dressing with the juice of 5 limes added to it.  It would have benefitted from the addition of some salt when the salad was mixed. But overall, very enjoyable.

This looked good when I made it and I followed the recipe but it was bland.  I ended up adding a little Garlic Expressions Vinaigrette to it and that made the difference.

I really liked this.. some others mentioned they did as well but wanted it a bit spicier.  I liked it the way it was.. but I may need to add more spice next time.  Great summer barbecue addition and easy!

I made this salad this weekend.  I like the freshness it offered but found it do be kind of blah in the taste department.  I added a splash of lemon juice, olive oil, and some cumin but still thought it lacked that punch I was looking for.   I will make it again and maybe add some jalapeno.

They sell this at school in small portions, so I decided to make it.   I only used black and white beans, everything else the same. I like it, and my 2 year old grandson, too. It may be bland but I like the consistency. I only had one lime, but noticed when I squeezed more juice it helped enhance flavor.  It does make a lot. So this will be my meals for the next couple of days

Orzo is best when cooked in chicken stock. This is good, but much better the second or third day.  So, if you're planning on serving this at a party, best to cook ahead so the flavors have time to develop in the fridge.  Easy for large crowds.

I'm not a big fan of anything Mexican, least of all beans but I needed something to serve for a friend that loves Mexican food.  This looked good, so I tried it....and I loved it!  What a surprise for me! 
As others have said, it needed a little heat, so I put in 1/2 tsp of chili powder, cumin and garlic salt.  Then I added some tabasco and hot sauce.  More salt, pepper.  I think it can be adjusted to your taste.  But the beans, orzo, corn, pepper, red onion,cilantro, etc. were just a great mix and just tasty!

This is a refreshing salad. I added a bit of grated Parmesan to the lemon dressing. It's better after a few hours.

My family loved this refreshing dish! We sprinkled in some red pepper flakes for a bit of a bite and used only 4 limes. It's a keeper in our home!

I measured the dry orzo--had a generous 2 cups.  I did not use as many beans as called for--only about 1/2. After the limes were juiced--I had about 3/4 cup. I also added 1 tsp cumin--I like in Mexican dishes--but not necessary. You MUST let it chill for at least 2 hours --the flavours need to develop. Good recipe.

Loved it!  Tasted so fresh!  In my second attempt I added about two tablespoons of chopped chipotle in adobo sauce to the dressing and it gave this dish the kick I was yearning for.

We had this last night and I made half a recipe.  We don't care for corn in salads or chickpeas, so I eliminated both and used leeks instead of green onions (what I had).  I used 2 cans of beans instead (one black, one kidney), and half of a minced jalapeno and Fresno peppers. After a couple of hours in the refrigerator, I decided it needed more lime and oil, so I used the amount for the full recipe.  My half recipe easily had 8 servings.  It was very light and refreshing, especially when paired with Mexican Salmon (from this site).  We will definitely have again.

I love this! I followed the recipe exactly except I added just a little extra corn. Very tasty and refreshing. It would be ideal during the summer.

Yummy....omitted the chick peas since I had none and used frozen corn instead of canned. Delicious and a very pretty salad with all of the colors of peppers, cilantro etc. Will make again. Thanks!

This is a great salad for a crowd because it makes a lot!  I added a couple of diced jalapenos to give it a bit of a lift.  I also squeezed a fresh lime over the salad just before serving - wonderful!

This was good, but a little on the bland side, going to try to spice up the left overs for tonight... made this with Fish Tacos and it was a good pair.
