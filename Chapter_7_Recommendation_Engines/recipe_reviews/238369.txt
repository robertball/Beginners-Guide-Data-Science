This is a somewhat unique creamy potato salad with the addition of the dill and the tangy spicy brown mustard.  This house enjoys potato salad, and this is a good one!

All of the ingredients to make a perfect potato salad, but the flavor wasn't strong enough. I think it needs more brown mustard.

I've made it several times.

First butter (salted or not, melted or not), while the potatoes are still warm. Then the eggs (more than 3!) if they're still warm. This mixes easier. Then the rest.

I liked it, husband did not. Maybe the brown mustard? Too much?

This was very good. Changes I made just for preference were: white onions because red are so strong, 4 eggs instead of 3, and yellow mustard because I donâ€™t like brown. Worked very well. You will want to mash potatoes with a masher to break up big lumps. Otherwise you have tasteless big potato lumps with not enough sauce.  Thanks to the person who posted this!
