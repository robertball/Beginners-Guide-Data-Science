Excellent recipe.  When I have a large supply of eggs, this is how I use them.  I never have cake flour, so I use 1/8 cup cornstarch and 7/8 cup of all purpose flour.

Excellent recipe!!!  I made sure I really whipped the egg whites as other posters had said and this turned out great for me.  Instead of make this in the tube pan, I made muffins out of it.  The recipe for me made 24 muffins (make sure to use liners or they do stick).  I have my muffins currently frozen and I take one down a night for a strawberry dessert.  For anyone interested also I am on weight watchers and I calculated the muffins to be about 1 1/2 pts a piece.  A great snack :)

Totally awesome! I just made it for the 2nd time this weekend, and it turned out perfectly without any changes. As for baking time, you can never go totally by any recipe. Always deduct 10 minutes, set your timer and go from there. Every oven is different, as most are not calibrated exactly. If you follow this recipe exactly, your cake will rise above the level of the pan and have excellent flavor and texture. Note the recipe tells you to add the sugar gradually (no need to process if you do this!), and then later to FOLD in the flour, etc. This means to use a spatula and fold from top to bottom--don't use your mixer and no stirring. If you don't fold, or if you overfold, you will loose your volume for the cake! I sliced this into 3 layers and filled with lemon curd and white chocolate buttercream, then frosted w/the buttercream! Everyone totally loved it and raved about how incredible the cake was!! This is a GREAT recipe!

this a wonderful and easy recipe.  I've always used a mix to make angel food, but i'll always use this one now.  If you don't have cream of tartar, use baking soda in the same quantity.  It works just as well.

My dad loved this cake and he is the pickiest eater in the world!  I didn't think it tasted egg-y at all.  Super easy!!  It was moister than any store-bought cake I've ever had, even my dad who likes store cake never knew that angel food cake was supposed to be moist.  I followed previous ratings and "whipped it till the cows came home".  With the leftover egg yolks I made egg noodles!!  They (egg yolks) will keep in a covered jar in the fridge for a few days until you get a chance to use them.  This was wonderful, I plan on making it several times a year.  Thanks!!

Even though I messed up the recipe a little bit, it tasted absolutely wonderful.  I didn't have any cake flour on hand so I sifted regular all-purpose flour 3 times and then deducted 2 tablespoons.  I also added half a teaspoon of almond extract, just to add another dimension to the angel food cake.  The variations you can make are boundless.  I would think adding lemon / orange zest would be great as well.  Oh also, to prevent over-burning, perhaps you can try covering it with foil for 20 minutes or so. Yum!

I was using this cake for strawberry shortcake, and on the third (!) try, I got it right.  I used parchment paper on the bottom of two 9 inch pans,(they stuck without it on cake #1), and I wasted about 1/3 cup of batter, cooked them for about 15 minutes, making sure the tops were EVENLY golden brown, (cake #2 was undercooked), and when they came out of the oven I propped them on something upside down so they did not deflate (cake #1 deflated).  In the end, the cake was Fabulous and my mother made me make one for her the next day!!! Definitely a keeper, and I will refer to my review next time so I do not forget!

I made this for my husband when he asked for an Angel Food cake for his birthday....and I didn't realize that you could buy them boxed.  I put a homemade whipped cream frosting on it. Several people told me it was the best cake they'd had in their lives(!) - a very high mark for someone who doesn't cook much.  Even I thought it was incredible.

This is a beautiful cake, everyone in my family loves it.  So fluffy and moist it truely deserves the moniker "angel food"!  The secret is to whip it till the cows come home.

Love this, love this, love this! You can do so many things with angelfood cake anyway. I did use the advice of a former rater and mix 1/8 cornstarch w/ 7/8 flour because we are 110 miles from town and I never have cake flour either. I save my whites from making eggs benedict and other things requiring yolks only, and freeze them, so I can make this whenever I want to, using 1 egg white= 1 fl oz, or 2 TBL, or 1/4 cup = 2 lg egg whites

Wonderful taste and texture. Will reduce the heat to 350º next time as top was getting too dark. I noticed other angel food cake recipes all call for a lower oven temp. Great cake, thanks.

Excellent recipe. I halved the recipe, and made these changes, most of them as recommended by other reviewers:
~decreased the sugar from ¾ cups to ½ a cup
~doubled the vanilla extract
~omitted the salt
~decreased the egg whites to 5, and instead added 1 teaspoon of white vinegar to the vanilla/egg mixture

When baking:
~used a loaf pan, instead of a ring tin
~dusted the pan with flour – this definitely prevented it from sticking too much
~tied a long piece of folded foil around the tin, like how you would prepare a soufflé dish. The width of the surrounding foil was 1.5 times the depth of the tin (it’s easy, really!)
~baked the cake for 25 minutes in a 180 degrees C oven, then lowered the temperature to 160 degrees C and baked for 12 minutes longer. The cake came out perfect – not a bit of brown, just a light golden colour

Cooling:
I left the cake in the pan for about 10 minutes to cool (on a wire rack), ran a knife along the edges of the loaf pan, then eased it up *gently* from the bottom with a spatula from each of the four sides, and tipped it out onto a plate

 Decorating:
Once the cake completely cool, I whipped ½ a cup of cream, spread it over the top and decorated with canned peach slices. It was absolutely delicious, and was finished within a few hours. Not bad for a first time angel food cake maker!

By the way, I used the 4 of the leftover yolks in making a litre of ice cream (I’ll post the recipe within the next month – it’s another keeper).

Even though my angel food cake went terribly wrong. I thought it was still pretty  good. I am definitely going to try it again! (It was my first attempt ever)

What I did wrong: I used COLD egg whites instead of room temperature. I didn't make sure everything was clean and dry. I used a metal bowl.

According to my mother, these are all no-nos when trying to whip eggs up into peaks.

My eggs ended up kind of frothy, so I used them anyway. My cake was only half of the height it should have been, but it still tasted really good, if slightly tough on the outside. I only cooked it for about 35 minutes.

I definitely recommend this recipe, as even done poorly, it still tastes great.

This cake was good, but I think a box mix would be just as good.  With the leftover egg yolks I used the custard recipe that CCRUMP gave on 1/4/03 and it didn't turn out very well, it didn't thicken enough (maybe needs cornstarch).  But I also found a recipe called "Gold Cake" that calls for a cup of egg yolks and would be perfect use of them if you want another cake.

Loved it! Again, beat the hell out of the eggs and let cool upside down. The bottle trick did not work for me, but I have a cooling rack, so it wasn't necessary. Do NOT think (as I did once) you can make this recipe without cake flour or fine sugar. Don't waste your time. Batter should be like melted marshmallow when you put in in your pan. Mmmm...

This is just like the cakes my mother would bake for my birthday every year in Canada-- and now that I live in New Zealand, I can share a taste from home with my own family!  I frosted it with Mum's Boiled Frosting: Boil a cup of sugar in a half cup of water until the syrup is stringy when poured off a spoon.  Beat 2-3 egg whites ( yes, even MORE egg whites!) and then add the syrup slowly while beating the eggs.  It's that simple--and very sweet-- but, birthdays only come once a year!  Why not indulge?

Oh my God, this was perfect!  Perfect flavor, perfect consistency . . . This was exactly the angelfood cake I wanted to make!  Because we don't eat wheat or corn, I'd been despairing over never being able to have an angelfood cake again--the best recipes either called for cake flour, which is made with wheat, or used powdered sugar, which has corn starch in it.  The other day I found a technique for making gluten-free cake flour, so I decided to give it a shot.  I subbed a mix of white rice flour and arrowroot powder (1 cup minus two tablespoons white rice flour plus two tablespoons arrowroot powder) for the cake flour, and also added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract out of personal preference, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm working on a tiramisu recipe, too, so I baked this in a 9 X 13 baking pan to use later as a sub for lady fingers.  We ended up eating too much of the cake to use, though, since it was so awesome!  The only trouble I had was that the rice flour caused it to brown a little too fast--I had to cover it with foil after 15 minutes to keep the top from burning, and it only took 30 minutes to cook.  THANK YOU FOR THE EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!

Thank You! This cake is amazing. I didn't have cake flour so I used self rising flour and I also added 1 1/2 teaspoons of almond flavoring. I've made this cake at least a dozen times now. To make it chocolate(as requested by a co-worker)I just added 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder. I can't ever eat a store bought cake again.

Loved it. I never had to beat egg whites like this before - literally took more than 10 minutes. When you do mix the egg whites use the largest bowl you have. My standard large glass bowl overflowed. Freezes beautifully.

This recipe was delicious.  Followed the directions as stated EXCEPT did not sift the flour with the sugar (couldn't find my sifter and was in a hurry).  It was perfect!  Topped with strawberries and homemade whipped cream...  Yummy summer treat.  Thanks for the recipe - a keeper!

UPDATE 8/28/10:  Have made this recipe a gazillion times.  Follow the recipe exactly (and make sure no yolks sneak into the whites when you are cracking them).  Now my 10 year old son can make it (almost on his own).  Tonight he made homemade whipping cream along with sliced fresh strawberries to go on top - Yum.  We love this recipe!

This recipe is so easy and tastes great.  My mother-in-law is an angel food cake fanatic, and she said this was the best she has ever had.  She also told me to plan on being asked to make it often. thanks

This is absolutely the best recipe I've found for Angel Food Cake. I rate it on simplicity, moistness, texture,  flavor, and eye appeal. In my opinion it gets 5 stars in each category. I used regular all purpose flour because that's what I had and I'm sure that's what I'll use the next time because I hate to mess with a good thing.

mmmmmm, simply delicious! i had an extra dozen of eggs in the refrigerator & decided to give this recipe a try. i didn't have any cake flour on hand but an allrecipes search informed me that 1 cup sifted all-purpose flour minus 2 tablespoons flour could be substituted in it's place. this angel food cake rises well & was golden brown after 30 minutes but i gave it an additional 10 minutes to deepen the color. many thanks kristin!

Very disappointed in this recipe.  It was VERY eggy and I couldn't eat it.  I guess I am just used to the boxed version.  Only one of the five in our family would eat it.

I wasn't quite happy with this recipe. It was missing something. But, by no means, was it a bad recipe. It was excellent! Just not quite the flavour I was looking for.

I was trying to find a cake lower in cholesterol and decided to try an angel food cake. I didn't want to waste egg yolks so I used 1 16 oz container of 100% liquid egg whites. The carton stated it equaled 8 large eggs, so I figured it woud be okay if the recipe needed 12 more likely medium eggs. The cake sprang up really well in the oven. After I removed it I let it cool a little and then inverted it onto a funnel on a plate to rest and cool the rest of the way. I didn't understand the soda bottle technique. The cake looked beautiful and also cut well. I thought it tasted similar to what I know as an angel food cake, but it was a tad more eggy tasting then I expected when warm. That may have been because I used carton egg whites? However, once cooled it lost some of the eggy flavor and tasted more like what I know as an angel food cake.

This was my first angel food cake and I'm glad I was not counting on this for an important event. I used a 10" tube pan, the cake rose high, then spilled in the oven. I took the advice of other members and only cooked for about 30 minutes - 45 would have been better. I used an oven thermometer and I think if your oven is set properly, 45 minutes is perfect. The bummer was I inverted the cake onto a bottle so it could cool without falling (as the directions suggested) and it fell right out of the pan. I wound up cutting the pieces into cubes and served in martini glasses topped with stawberries and whipped cream.

The cake was very easy to make and turned out fluffy and soft. The next time I make this, however, I will use less sugar. It was extremely sweet!

This is a wonderful recipe.  My husband loves angel food cake.  The boxed stuff doesn't hold a candle to this.  The only bad thing about it is that there is all the yolks left over I don't like to be wasteful, but what do you do with them???  Thank you for this recipe.  I will be making it often.

Excellent classic. Modified it by adding about 2 tablespoons of very finely chopped lemon rind, was really good with the hint of lemon flavor. Serve with whipped cream whipped with real vinalla bean for an extra treat.

The final product is a wonderful, fluffy cake that is just sweet enough to satisfy a carb craving. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and baked in a bundt pan. After all, modifications would not lend to a true review of the original. I cracked all my eggs then whipped the vanilla, cream of tartar, and salt into the egg whites. I started at about medium speed then cranked it up as high as it would go for a good 15 minutes. Also- Loved the wine bottle suggestion! Works Great!

Three tips for the novice: 1) NO YOLKS! not even a drop! 2) whip it! whip it good! -or at least 5 minutes past the point you think you're done 3) dust your bundt pan with a light coat of cake flour, but DO NOT grease the pan... Enjoy!

This cake turned out great with Whole Wheat Flour.  I just sifted the flour twice and added as normal.  The cake is darker than a normal angel food, but healthier and just as tasty!

I live overseas in a hot and humid place and I'm pretty sure this really affected the cake. The flavor was nice but it really deflated even though I was very careful to do everything right.

My first attempt at making an angel food cake - wonderful!  I used a 2 piece angel food pan, and cooled it upside down on a bottle.  Super!  Served with whipped cream and fresh strawberries and blueberries.

I just made this cake for my sisters birthday. I followed the recipe exactly and was scared about how it would turn out because a lot of people were saying it didnt work out. However, i gave this cake 5 stars. It was amazing, light and fluffy and everybody enjoyed it!! Thats definately a plus!! I would make this again in a heartbeat. Mixing the eggwhites is everything. You dont want to over-mix them, because that will make a much flatter cake!!

Tired of spending a lot for box mixture, I decided to make my first scratch cake.  I was apprehensive, but, I followed all the directions and only sbstituted the vanilla for almond extract.  I am so excited.  The cake had so much volume, it was to the top of my tube pan.  The texture is fabulous and the flavor superb.  It does not taste bland like the box mixes or bought cakes.  This cake disappeared quickly. Can you imagine if I had used some fruit with this?  Wow! Will definitely make this again.  Thanks, Kristin.

If I could give this recipe 100 stars, I would.  It is so forgiving.  I never made angel food from scratch and got this brainy idea tonight.  How many things could go wrong?  Oh let me count the ways.  First, didn't read the recipe the whole way through and mixed all ingredients at once.  Scrapped it and started over.  Round two.  Only had dried egg whites.  By mistake, mixed them in cold water (not warm like the instructions say). Oh well. They never formed peaks.  But I kept going.  Didn't have cream of tartar, so i used 4 tsp lemon juice like another reviewer suggested.  Still no peaks.  Lovely foam though.  Popped in the oven and held my breath.  45 minutes later....heaven.  Who knew!  It is a little more dense that typical angel food but not by much.  

UPDATE:  Made this today EXACTLY to the recipe and want to clarify a few points I originally made.  The one I made rated above did have a bitter aftertaste, I think from the lemon, although  my hubs didn't notice it.  There really is no suitable sub for cream of tartar.  Also used whites in the carton this time.  Used stand mixer this time instead of hand mixer. Got the peaks.  And YOU MUST cool this upside down on a bottle or it will fall.

An excellent cake indeed! I failed the first time making this because I didn't know how to whip egg whites, make sure their actually stiff and the batter is not liquidy or it will not turn out well! :) Otherwise a great cake, although I think the sugar content is too high, I only added 1 cup of sugar for the recipe provided and thought that it was more than sweet enough.

This is a beautiful, moist, light, very tasty cake. My 5 and 7 yr old boys loved it plain. Easy to make, eggs should be at room temp. so they seperate easily. The next time I make it I'm going to do 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extracts. Thanks for the recipe.

Whenever you can make something homemade and avoid box mixes/prepared food, you really owe it to your taste buds and your health.  This is one of those recipes that it is so simple and really does pay off in taste.

My first attempt at angel food cake and it came out perfect! I was making a flag cake for July 4th, so I used a 9x13 pan, baked for about 35 minutes. It came out perfectly golden.  I didn't have cake flour, so I just used all-pupose flour, but reduced by about 2 tablespoons.  Thanks for such a fool-proof and delicious recipe!

I gave it two stars because it did make a cake but that's about it. What a horrible cake and I followed everything to a T and it tasted like eggs and had a very odd texture. I really had high hopes for this one but it let me down.

Great! Easy! I didn't have any cake flower on hand, so I just used one cup flower minus 2T, and sifted. Worked like a charm! I cooked it for closer to 40 minutes, at 30 minutes it was hardly golden. Oh, and I broke one of my egg yolks, so I ended up using only 11 egg whites. Still fine! We just at the  cake plain...no topping really needed!

Just made this cake and it is awesome!  We couldn't even wait until it was completely cooled.  Hubby is already asking for a second piece.  I did however change it a little.  I used 3/4 cup of Splenda and 3/4 cup regular sugar.  The splenda I mixed with the flour and the sugar with the egg whites.  I didn't have any cake flour so I just sifted my all purpose flour about 5 times, and only baked it for about 30 min.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous!  It tastes great and really is no harder to put together than the box mix version!  I will be making this recipe often and have already passed it onto my mother who is excited to try it.  Highly recommended for its good taste and ease of preperation.

Perfect.  Use very fresh eggs and turn your mixer way up and this is a snap.  Loved it.

This came together beautifully, and baked up wonderfully to a lovely golden brown. Unfortunately this cake has the same cloyingly sweet taste and gummy texture all made-from-scratch angel food cakes seem to have.  I made the day before I was going to serve it and ended up making the good ol' Betty Crocker boxed angel food cake in the morning to serve instead.  This one will likely end up in the freezer for use in a trifle or something else where it's not the centre of attention and the sweetness can be balanced out or masked a bit.  A waste of time and ingredients. UPDATE: the cake box cake collapsed when I inverted it, so I had to serve this one. What a difference a day makes!!  It ended up tasting great!  So, my advice is to make it a day ahead, the cloying sweet taste was gone and everyone loved it ??

This recipe was perfect, great flavor. Make sure you whip the egg whites long enough and FOLD in the flour/sugar gently. This one's going in my box!

From someone who makes a lot of Angel Food cakes, this is not the best.  To make a really good one, you need to use powdered sugar with the flour, not white sugar.  The white sugar weighed the batter down and it didn't rise as well.  Also, the cake lacked flavor.
I also use just a bit of almond extract in mine to add some flavor.

I made this for my 11 year old son's birthday because he wanted strawberry shortcake w/o the biscuit...so I made this Angel Food Cake in it's place.  I started making it in muffin tins but found the cakes to be waayyyyy too small (even though they were filled to the top).  Seeing as I still had a good amount of batter left I decided to make it in a tube pan.  It came out perfectly and it tasted great....smelled fabulous while baking.  Will most definitely make again!

Loved it! I used the egg white carton (1 egg carton=12 egg whites), and because I couldn't find cream of tartar, I used 3x its amount in lemon juice (aka 4.5 tsp lemon juice), and it came out great, without a hint of lemon! (which I wouldn't have minded!) I also used all purpose flour instead of cake flour and didn't realize I should've used 2 less tbsp in quantity, and it still came out great! (I did triple sift it as someone else suggested!) I topped the finish product with fresh cut strawberries and whipped cream, and it was awesome! My friend who I made it for (bday cake!) loved that it was moist and fluffy! I'd definitely make it again! :) (note- I followed the recommendation of beating the eggs on high "til the cows come home", that was helpful I think! :)

Excellent excellent recipe!!  The cake was moist and flavorful baked at 40 mins. I have had failures with angel food in the past.  So I know the importance of washing beaters, utensils, bowl & pan in hot soapy water & swish w/white vinegar. I also made sure the egg whites were absolutely room temp.  The results were PERFECT!!

My brother's favorite. I've made it 5 plus times, and it always comes out perfect: light and springy, the way angel foodcake is supposed to.

We made all different sizes; the kids liked the cupcake size.  I wrapped the cakes in wax paper and froze them; they defrosted great and tasted the same!

This was so yummy!  I made it for a lemon berry trifle I was making and it was fabulous.  I too used regular flour minus a Tbsp. instead of cake flour and added in a squirt of almond extract.  I used my bundt pan (essentially the same thing as a tube pan) and the cooking time was more like 30 minutes.  I think if you let it go the 45 minutes..it would be cooked to a crisp!  Did take a little patience with prying away with a butter knife to seperate it off the pan.  But well worth the effort.  THANKS!

This recipe turned out awesome! I tried one other before this one and didn't like the way it turned out but this one was very simple and tasted wonderful. My husband ate half the cake in one sitting and wanted me to make another cake for the next day! What a hit!

This is my first time making an angel food cake. It turned out great! (even though i had to beat it by hand...that took a while) I didn't have a tube pan, so i baked it in a ordinary loaf pan. It worked just as well, i lowered the temperature to 350 and covered it for 10 towards the end. I also cut back on the sugar since some reviewers said it was too sweet. I used about 1 cup. YUM

Turned out great the first time.  Make sure all pans, bowls and utensils are free of any oil residue--use glass or metal--and that no egg yolk gets into the whites, and your cake should not fall.  I peeked at it toward end of baking and it still didn't fall.  Substituted 3X sifted all purpose flour less 1T for cake flour, as another reviewer suggested. Baked exactly as long as recipe suggests. Served with dollop of 50:50 blend of strawberry yogurt and non-fat cool whip topped with fresh strawberries or sweet nectarines. Awesome light dessert. May try a bit of almond or lemon flavor in addition to vanilla next time to give the cake alone more zing.

At first, I was apprehensive about making this recipe because of all the eggwhites...but then I realized I could buy liquid egg whites at my local grocery store in a carton, and that made this recipe a lot more user-friendly. I didn't think the cake was fantastic by itself, but with whipped cream and assorted berries, it was excellent! I followed a few reviewer's tips - I checked on the cake after 30 minutes, and kept an eye on it for the next ten. I also put foil on the cake after half an hour, because it was a bit too brown on top. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This cake was wonderful, just like I remember having as a child!  My guests loved it, served with whipped cream and fresh strawberries.  I can't wait to make it again and try it with peppermint flavored whipped cream, the way my mom used to make it.  In addition to covering the cake with aluminum foil, after 20 minutes, I then turned the heat down to 150°C after 30 minutes and a left it in the over until the timer went off at 45 minutes.  The result was a beautifully covered cake, which was moist but not too wet.

fantastic recipe! The cake was moist, light, and fluffy... everything an angel food cake should be. I made a simple icing with powdered sugar and milk and drizzled it on the top to add a little extra someting, but the cake was divine on its own! Thank you!

Very light spongey. Tastes like storebought angel food cake but fresher. Just in case you were wondering, you don't need to flour or grease your pan or anything like that. It shouldn't stick even if your pan isn't nonstick. I just went around the edges with a knife when it came out of the oven. I served my angel food cake hot with a berry compote I made (frozen berries and sugar boiled together).Very delicious, but also very good plain two days later if you saran-wrap it.

This recipe is a winner! its so easy and mine came up very light and fluffy and tastes so yummy! I did reduce the baking time to 30 mins though like so many have recommended and my parents found it a tad sweet so i served it with whipped cream and strawberries to soften the sweetness. I will definitely make this again!

Very good. The only mistake i made was not flipping the cake upside down as soon as i took it out of the oven. It sort of shrunk because of that.

I baked in loaf pans and didn't have much trouble with removing the cake (we were prepared to serve from the pan just in case) by running my knife along the edges and having dusted with flour beforehand. I didn't have cake flour or cream of tartar on hand, so I used substitutes for both. I used 1 tablespoon cornstarch and the rest of the 1 cup all purpose flour. I replaced the cream of tartar with lemon juice after searching the internet for a suitable swap. Really, I decided to make the cake so I wouldn't waste leftover egg whites from baking other desserts that called for yolks only. I'm so glad I did, the cake was a hit!

I wound up having to use a couple substitutions. For cake flour, I used 1 cup of all-purpose minus 2 tbsp, and added 2 tbsp of cornstarch. I also did not have cream of tartar, and read somewhere that an equal amount of lemon would suffice. I don't really believe this made any difference, but the cake tasted amazing anyways! I made the mistake of using a decorated bundt pan, and since you're not supposed to oil the pan we wound up having to eat the cake right out of the pan, but it was pretty close (though not as fluffy/spongey as angel food should be, but I assume this is the fault of my substiutions) and quite delicious!

The first time I made this I used egg beaters and it did not turn out, maybe I did not beat enough. The second time I used egg whites, room temperature, and beat them for about 20 minutes before adding the sugar etc. This cake is very good. I did add 2 teaspoons of vanilla, double strength, because I love vanilla.

I don't know whatI did wrong, but the cake was fine on the outside but looked like solid rubber on the inside.  Smothered in cool whip and strawberries it was still edible, but I won't make it again : (

It was a very good cake, a little bit sweet but still good. I made sure i didn't add a lot of sugar in the whipped cream and strawberries since the cake was already sweet:). The only reason why i only gave 4 stars is because after cooling the cake and taking it our of the tube pan, i found that the top wasn't flat. It looks like some parts of the top was missing but it still came out pretty well:). nothing a whipped cream on top can't handle

This was good. I used a bundt pan and baked for 30 minutes. I lowered the temp to 350 for the last 10 minutes because it was browning very quickly. It was a bit tricky getting out of the pan and came out pretty lopsided, but the taste made up for it. I will probably reduce the sugar a bit next time. Also, my eggs came right out of the fridge- next time I will let them come to room temperature. I whipped the eggs at high speed for about 5 minutes until the peaks formed. I topped this cake with homemade whipped cream and strawberries for a strawberry shortcake variation. Very yummy and surprisingly easy!

Great angel food cake!  I did this recipe to use up a large number of leftover egg whites, and I wasn't even expecting it to come out.  It was very simple, and delicious to boot.

I used Eggbeaters boxed egg whites so I didn't need to worry about what to do with 12 yolks & that was helpful. I only had a silicone bundt pan to use & the cake stuck  but it rose nicely, had a nice texture &.....I hated it. It was so sweet it gave me a headache. I don't think it's the recipe at all, just my personal taste. Thanks for sharing it:o)

Extremely easy, and a lot faster than I thought it would. However, I had THE worst time folding in the flour/sugar mixture. I think it ended flattening the mixture some. =(

The only problem was removing it from the tube pan.  I had to cut it into pieces inside the pan, even though the pan I used was allegely nonstick.

I made a 1/2 recipie of this the other nite and did them in cupcake liners in my muffin tins and they came out great - made 1 dozen exactly!  Today I thought I'd see how they'd turn out using splenda instead of sugar, so I made a 1/4 batch using 1/4 cup flour, 2 Tbsp Splenda, 3 egg whites, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cream of tarter and 1/8 tsp salt.  I did not mix 1/2 the splenda with the flour, but just added it in after the eggs, vanilla, c.o.t. and salt were whipped and at it's volume.  I only baked them for 15 min at 375.  They came out pretty good... a little tough, but that's because I'm not that great at folding in and I lost quite a bit of volume when adding the flour.  I have diabetic mother and mother-in-law and I am in a life-long battle with my weight, so this little cupcake at right around 50 cal. & 16g carbs each will be a nice treat around my house!

This cake has way too much cream of tartar in it. It made the cake taste sour and masked its sweetness. Also stuck to the pan really badly and I had to take it out in pieces and frost the pieces in a bowl.

I have made this twice now and it is my husbands favorite - not to mention anyone else who has been here to enjoy it with us.  I didn't have the correct pan so I used a bundt pan and it only took about 30 minutes to bake.  The cake tends to stick to the bundt pan but I gently and patiently used a knife to get the cake out without damage.  I also don't know what cake flour is so I used white flour.  I served it with vanilla ice cream, cool whip and strawberries - yum, yum!

This is a great angel food cake.  I made it for an afternoon with my girl friends, and it received rave reviews. It's five star worthy all on its own, but I made mine into a "black and white" angel food cake by dripping some chocolate sauce over the top (about 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips and 3/4 cup heavy cream).  I topped it off with strawberries.  The aromatics alone will feed you! Later that evening I gave a piece to my neighbor and she said it was the best cake she had ever had in her life.  She is 78 years old!

This was so easy to make with a stand mixer.  I loved it and it stayed good for several days.  Also, I had two smaller bundt pans; just cooked a little lower temp and less time...it turned out great.

This was the first time I have ever made angel food cake and it came out fantastic! Perfectly light and springy and moist (would have been better if I hadn't slightly overcooked it). I made a whipped cream frosting and covered it in strawberries. 

I used the amount of sugar the recipe called for and I didn't think it was too sweet. I made two 9" round cakes and cooked for 20 minutes, I would recommend less time, 15-17 minutes. 

And whip the eggs! It's a good ten minutes of whipping, you'll need a mixer unless you have very strong arms.

Angel food is not my favorite, but this is a good standard recipe.  A little less flour than some recipes, so comes out a bit spongy and less "cakey", but nice and moist.

The taste of this cake was heavenly and it was suprisingly easy to make.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is that I couldn't get it out of the pan.  This is probably my fault if anyone knows what I did wrong or a secret technique please share I would like to make this again.

Very nice moist cake!  I used the idea from another recipe on this site (Cherry Angel Food Cake)and added chopped/drained maraschino cherries at the end and folded them in.  I wanted to use this recipe because it was 5 stars and I'm glad I did.  Even without the cherries it would be great!  I agree with the other reviewers that said 40 - 45 minutes is too much time. In was already getting pretty brown in 30 minutes.  I was worried taking it out that early but had I kept it in it might have been dry or too dark around the edges.

Very good, delicious, professional results.  One issue to consider: set your timer to ten minutes before recommended amount and check often until done.  I baked mine a little too long but was very pleased with results none the less.

Great recipe; however, mine only needed about 33-35 minutes in the oven. I frosted with Cool Whip and topped with strawberry slices. Absolutely delicious!

This turned out surprisingly good, since I'd never thought about attempting angel food cake before.  It was sweet and fluffy, but still something I'd want plenty of time to fix.  I always have an unlucky time of separating egg whites.  Thanks for the easy recipe, though.

This was my second attempt at making this cake. The first time was like 7 years ago and it didn't turn out. I had used the egg whites in the carton. This time I used real egg whites and my cake was angelic. :-) Will make again.

This was awesome!  So much better than the box mixes and really not that difficult.  The box mixes have so many chemicals added to them it scares me.  Making your Angel Food (or most anything for that matter) from scratch is a much healthier way to go.  Thank you so much!

My Brother-in-Law wanted an Angel Food cake for his Birthday - and he is the resident expert on these cakes.  I was trying to compete with his Grandma who use to whip her egg whites by hand in the wind - Ya right! After his first bite he said it tasted just like Grandma use to make - THANKS for this great recipe!!  I will definately use this again!!!

The first time I made this angel cake is was a disaster so I made two changes. First, I added 1/3 cup of warm water. Second, I lowered the oven temperature to 350 degrees. I did not open the oven door for 35 minutes at which time I inserted a skewer in the cake and it came out clean. The proper tools are very important when making any Angel Food Cake. I used an actual Angel Food Cake Pan, (two piece) and a very sharp knife to remove the cake. If you use an Angel Food Cake Pan, you won't need to balance the cake on a bottle since the Angel Food Cake Pan has three legs that keep the cake suspended. I let it cool for and hour and a half and it came out perfect.

The cake turned out Superb! My cake fell out of the freaking pan when I inverted it!  My son said it tastes like a delicous marshmallow from heaven but the entire cake is in a heap and broken to smithereens. I'm still using it but where did I go wrong? It's they typical 10 inch tube pan. ARGH!

UPDATE: When you make this the first time, don't listen to the person who says to only cook it 35 minutes...  The reason the cake falls after being inverted (I found out) is because it isn't done. The Pro's say it's better to overcook and Angel Food than under cook and that's exactly what happened with mine.

This is a great cake! We whipped up some whipped cream ( 1/2 c. Heavy cream and 2 tsp. powdered sugar ) and topped it with  some freshly picked berries and a sprig of mint. It was delish!

I have made this 3 times, and every time it came out perfectly.  It's such a simple and clean recipe.  So much more healthy than a store box.

I use liquid egg whites, way easier, and I use 1 1/2 cup of them.  That seems to equal 12 egg whites.  As I said, I have made this tasty recipe 3 times!

I have never baked a cake from scratch before. Furthermore, I stink at cooking. Everything I make has some kind of horrible flaw. I’ve made my peace with it though. Also I find egg whites intimidating for some reason. I've never had any luck with them. Anyway, my wife wanted an angel food cake for her birthday. Being the amazing husband that I am I decided to try and make her a homemade angel food cake. I was nervous going in because of those darn egg whites.  Since there are only 6 ingredients needed I was willing to risk a potential failure. Plus it didn’t hurt that I had all the ingredients just hanging around not doing anything anyway.  In the end the cake came out amazingly, awesomely, great.  My wife was shocked and amazed. I honestly cannot imagine what went wrong for the folks that gave it one star. Something mysterious happened because if a total cooking buffoon such as me can make this cake AND have it come out like it did, and then anyone on Earth should be able to pull it off. In no way, shape, or form could a box cake beat this cake. Perhaps to a person with no tongue a box cake would be better (no offense to anyone without a tongue). For my foolish oven it took between 30 – 35 minutes to cook. I did the push/spring back test with 10 minutes left in the cooking time and springy it was. Have a good weekend.

I will never buy a box with preservatives again. I DID IT! I made angel food cake. The directions were easy. Just make sure you have no egg yolks at all mixed in with whites and make sure you fold the dry ingredients. Cake cooked in a shorter time. I did balance my pan with tabs on coffee cups which was a suggestion on the Buzz. I have to say not putting anything on the pan scared me and it wasn't super easy to take off the pan, but I was careful and patient. The taste was great, and the fresh strawberries from the freezer from Spring was even better. Def. take the short amount of time to make homemade whipped cream it only adds to the whole scene.

This cake is amazing! I have always loved angel food cake but never had it homemade. It was so much moister than any I have ever tasted. It is easily one of the best cakes I have ever tasted and that says a lot. I used my egg yolks up making the gold cake someone else suggested and found it very good too. I love topping the angel food cake with whipped cream and fresh fruit.

I have tried other angel food cake recipes, but this one is the best! :D This is my second time baking it.

I added a couple of drops of red food coloring to make it pink, cause I LOVE pink! and it still turned out great!

I made this for my grandma's birthday with no changes.  Everyone loved it and the cake was gone so quickly!!  I topped it with drizzled chocolate and caramel.  I also invested in a FoodNetwork pan that has pegs for easy inverted cooling - no need for using a bottle.  Wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing!!!!

I was really skeptical while I was making this.  It stuck to the pan slightly and when you fold the flour into the eggs it doesn't really dissolve.  However, the cake was SO awesome.  Highly recommend.  You can cut the sugar down, it was pretty sweet.

I got a bit intimidated when I watched the video, with all of the cleaning all utensils with vinegar, and the special pan and all.  Mine turned out almost perfect, but it did fall a bit while in the oven, and maybe that's because I wasn't meticulous enough, or folded the dry ingredients too much.  But it still tasted great, and didn't collapse!  I did use a regular bundt pan as I didn't have an angel food cake pan.  No problem at all.  And i think it's a prettier shape!  Great recipe!

I had a bunch of egg whites after making David's Yellow Cake and I wasn't sure what to make.  I found this recipe and couldn't have been happier.  It's the first time I made an Angel Food cake and it was fantastic!  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Used pure cane sugar rather than processed white sugar.  Came out a bit denser than I remember the mix my mom used to use.  But it was very, very tasty.  Fresh strawberries and whipped cream were the finishing touches.  Shall make again.

delicious flavor, but 40-45 minutes was way too long in the oven, the crust was to hard for us to really enjoy it.  Next time I will cut the baking time to 35 minutes.

the cake tasted great! this was the first time that i had ever made a cake other than  cake mix from a box! i think for a first try, it turned out fabulous! i wasn't completely sure about how much to whip the eggs, so i don't think i whipped them enough. the cake ended up only being about 2 inches tall, so it was very dense. in a way, i liked the density because it made it more filling, unlike traditional angel food cake! my sister had 4 slices in the span of 2 hours! good recipe!

I had 12 egg whites in the fridge and needed something to take to a get-together, so I made this.  I've never made an angel food cake before and this recipe was easy to follow and I got fantastic results.  My Kitchenaid made it super easy.  The cake flour makes it nice and light.  Great recipe!  Served with strawberries and cream.

This recipe was fantastic. I halved the recipe since only my husband and I were eating it and it turned out perfect... I live in East Asia so who knows what type of flour I was using and my sugar was a little bulky compared to the fine sugar in America but it still turned out. I'm impressed and I'll definitely be making this again.

this was my first time making angel food cake, and i don't have any sort of magnificent cake pan, so i made these into mini muffins instead.  
it made 64 mini muffins!
i didnt have any muffin cups to line the trays with, and i didnt want to grease my pans because another user mentioned that would deflate the eggwhites, and i didnt want to risk that....
it took about 6 minutes for the muffins to cook, but they burn VERY easy. don't turn your back on these!
very light and fluffy, tastes just like angel food cake. definitely very good.

this is probably an obvious statement, but don't use the "egg whites in a carton" option for this! i balked at not using so many egg yolks, but ended up heading to the store in the midst of baking because the carton whites just would not whip up.

but the second try was great and enjoyed by all. served it for a dinner party with fresh strawberries.

This recipe came out perfectly! I made the cake for a friend's birthday and it was a hit. I had never made angelfood cake before and I was a little nervous, but it came out better than store-bought.

This recipe is the best!  My 17 year old daughter made it for Easter.  There were 7 of us - we ate almost all of it.  It is tender and flavorful.  Definitely a recipe I will keep and use again and again.  Thank you for sharing it.

Sorry not worth the work. The cake is very very wet and is very flat. I followed directions exactly but it even had a very odd taste to it ( cream of tarter maybe). For the amount of time, work and cost to make this the boxed mixes you add water to are amazing compared to this. Sorry but will never make again.

This cake is heavier than cake mixes but goes great with strawberries and whipped cream. I followed the advice of another person and used the egg yolks in gold cake. I will make this again. Thanks.

A truly "no fail" recipe! I didn't remember to add the second half of the sugar until the batter was in the pan, but I was able to dump it back into my mixing bowl, add the sugar, whip it up a little and it baked up just fine! A little dense, but I expected that. Can't wait to try it again, in the right order! Also, I baked this at 375 for 35 minutes.

This was a lovely, lovely cake that was absolutely delicious - despite the fact that I underfolded it, overbaked it and added way too many egg whites! (I had extra). I added 1/2 tsp. almond extract, as one reviewer suggested, and also used AP flour minus one Tbsp., and the results were excellent. This is definitely a keeper!!!!

The cake was a bit time consuming. It smelled really nice in the oven. The cake was pretty good, a bit too sweet for my taste. Probably cut back on the sugar next time. My cake also started to shrink after taking it out of the pan. I dont know what is wrong with it. Except for substituting the cake flour for all purpose, i follow the recipes exactly. Will try this again.

Very delicious. It turned out perfectly even though I only had 10 egg whites. I just had a little trouble with it sticking to the pan (and I even used cooking spray). I sliced and layered this with raspberry ice cream to make an ice cream cake, and it was absolutely wonderful. I will definitly make it again.

We had a party yesterday and everyone was fighting over this cake. I used regular flour and it turned out fine. I also cut down on the sugar to 1 cup (I'm not a huge fan of super sweet desserts) and I also added 1/2 tsp almond extract for a very nice, yet subtle flavor. This tastes fantastic with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.

I love how simple this recipe is! I used splenda for mixing with the flour and regular sugar for mixing with the egg. I also didn't have cake flour so I used all-purpose flour with some cornstarch. Turned out well even though I beat the eggs by hand and didn't use a tube pan!

Everyone loved it.  I read some of the other reviews before baking, so I reduced the baking time, and it came out perfect.

I tought this cake was great.  I frosted it with a chocolate flavored whipped cream and it was fantastic.  Next time I will add some lemon zest and some lemon juice and just serve it with plain whipped cream.

Good cake. I've made some in the past, but this was the best. I did process the sugar in a little chopper I have, and I also added 1/4 tsp almond extract with the vanilla. Other than that, I followed exactly. The family ate it with strawberries and they raved (I'm vegan and didn't try it). They will probably ask me to make it again.

Moist, not excessively sticky like the pre-made angel food cakes you buy in the store.  Very easy to make, turned out perfectly, and had a very nice "cakey" taste to it, I guess from the last step of adding the cake flour and sugar.  Angel food cake is not one of my favorite cakes, but this recipe definitely pushed it up my list of favored desserts.

This cake turned out great.  It was moist and had the perect amount of crust around the edge.  I used a two piece tube pan so you can push the cake right out.

I followed the recipe exactly and the first time I made it, the cake came out super dry and crusty.  I then tried again, turned down my oven temp. (and normally my oven is weak), baked them for less time.  The cakes came out nicer, but they were still quite dry and not super tasty

This is really good and quite easy to make. I baked it for 30 minutes and it was just right. Next time, I am going to try using half Splenda and half sugar as another reviewer did.

The texture was good, but the flavor was lacking.  If you're looking for a taste that you would get from your grocery store bakery, this won't be it.

Excellent recipe.  I am an angel food cake LOVER, so YUM! :) **Here is a tip from a lady I used to know-- don't ever open the oven door to take a peek, it will cause the cake to fall.  So, if some of you are having trouble, that may be why.  I only needed to bake it 30 min...I went to 35, and wish I wouldn't have.  Angel food cake may take more than one try to learn how to do it, but this is a great recipe to start with! :)

Great recipe!  And so light I don't feel guilty eating a second piece.  It takes marvelously to improvisation, too.  I stirred in a bit of lemon zest and used lemon custard as a filling.  Delicious.

My cake did not come out very well. I most likely blame myself rather than the recipe...or at least I am assuming the blame is all mine...I read on FoodTV.com that you can substitute 1 C cake flour with 1 C minus 1 Tbsp of regular flour. Also, I might have over-mixed the batter making some of the air bubbles collapse. My cake came out very heavy and spongy...nothing like what an angel cake should be like. Either way, it was still tasty...especially with my icing made of lemon juice and powdered sugar!

I just finished making this cake.. it smells wonderful and hope it tastes that way too!  I think the cooking time was a little long because after 30 minutes, it looked as thought it was done.  After 40 minutes, I took it out and it was a little darker on top than it should have been.  Might also depend on the oven as well.  I will make this again, but will test it after 30 mins.  I plan on making a strawberry trifle with this and making one that has a lemon topping.  Mmm... mouth watering! :)

I loved this recipe. It was light and moist and not too sweet. I will never buy another angel food cake at the store again. I used it in another recipe (angel cake surprise) on this site and it greatly improved its quality as well.

The texture was a bit course, but the taste was quite good, needed a sauce or ice cream to bring out the taste and "hide" the egginess.  Easy to make

I'm a big Angel Food fan, and this really hit the spot.  I took the leftovers to work and even managed to convert a non-Angel Food fan over!  If you watch the Food Network, this recipe is very similar to their 'perfect' Angel Food cake recipe on "Good Eats".

Great cake. A little on the sweet side so I would probably cut down the sugar by 1/4 C next time. It was about 2-3 inches shorter than them box type but had a much better texture.

I realize 375 reviews is probably enough, but this turned out perfectly. I have some experience with Passover sponge cakes, and the principles are similar.  Whereas those tend to be heavier, yellow, and eggy, this angel food cake was light, bright white, and airy.  I set it on a strawberry puree reduction, and frosted with strawberry whipped cream. Then I topped it with halved fresh strawberries.  My husband said it was my best cake so far!

I've made this recipe several times (sometimes substituting 2 Tbsp cornstarch plus regular flour for the cake flour) and it's always turned out great. To make a smaller amount in a bundt pan, I've used 9 eggs and 2/3 of the other ingredients. My family loves it topped with 7 minute frosting.

I didn't hate it, my husband loved it.  My Gram used to make homemade angle food cake and it was so light and fluffy with a wonderfully soft texture.  This tasted fine, but the texture was just a bit off for me.  It was moist and springy and dense all at the same time.  My 16 year old thought it had too many eggs.  I wish I had watched my Gram make angle food cake...

So light and fluffy! I lined the bottom of my pan with parchment paper and used the bottle technique to cool. Turned out great!   Served it with a  fresh peach topping and whipped cream.  My kids are not peach fans, so I topped theirs with fresh strawberries.  This is a keeper in my recipes.

This is the best angel food cake you will ever eat. Nothing like the store bought tasteless ones you are probably used to. Make sure that you do NOT grease the pan in any way and that you let it cool completely in the pan turned upside down to prevent it from deflating after cooking.

I made this for my bosses birthday. Angel food cake is her favorite.  This is the first cake that she has ever gotten seconds on. I make all the cakes for everyone's birthday at work and this was the favorite one so far. 5 years and this is one I will definitely do again.

This recipe is fast and easy. It made a delicious cake. I served it with whipped cream into which I folded some well drained, crushed pineapple.   A little shredded coconut would be perfect. I will definitely make this again. I may buy a carton of egg whites next time rather than cracking and separating a dozen eggs.

Delicious!!! A great recipe to use up those extras eggs if you have chickens and Easy enough to follow for a first timer like me to make! It was devoured in less than 24hrs by my family of 6. I used a regular spring form pan (no hole in the middle) and only baked for 40mins. I'll do 35 next time. *** Save those egg yokes for a French bread casserole bake for the morning; Allrecipes has some great ones to try!

I have not ever made an angel food cake. My husband let me know that angel food cake is his favorite cake. I found this recipe and tried it. It came out perfectly. Be sure to follow the directions exactly, which is what I did. Not only does the cake look beautiful but it also tastes great by itself. My husband does not like any added extras. He just wanted it plain and simple. This cake does not taste plain and simple. Beautiful.

This cake is dangerous, I can't stop eating it! Delicious plain, as I prefer, with a great light texture and crumb. 
I've been baking for 50 years but have never made angel food cake from scratch, until now. The only change I made was to add 1/2 teaspoon of pure almond extract, as I love that flavor in Betty's mix. It could use a little more, next time I will use a full teaspoon. I also used all purpose flour, sifted and then removed 2 tbsp.
The hardest part of this was separating the eggs. Easy peasy after that. This will become a favorite!

As someone else noted (and I didn't see it until after I made it) use a LARGE mixing bowl. I had heard not to use a metal bowl, so I used my  2 quart glass Pampered Chef  bowl--but it was not large enough to let the egg whites get all the air they needed to expand fully. The cake did not reach the top of the pan, as it should have.  It's frustrating to use that many egg whites and then get tripped up on such a technicality!  Otherwise, the recipe is great (it''s almost identical to the old  Good Housekeeping recipe).

I had leftover egg whites and used it on this recipe, however halved the recipe. I made cake flour by taking out 1 tablespoon of flour and adding 1.5 tsp corn starch and sifted it 5-6 times. I didn’t have any cream of tartar on hand so substituted for  vinegar. I made cupcakes baking at 350f for about 20 minutes. These turned out pretty good with all the changes.

First off, in the end, the cake was delicious and had a great texture. But the baking instructions are just plain WRONG. 40-45 minutes at 375? Nope. I should have read the reviews before making it and dropped the temperature down to 350. After just 35 minutes, the top (bottom) of the cake was starting to burn substantially in several places, and my oven tends to run cool. Luckily, I caught it before it was unsalable, and was able to cut away the part that was too burnt to eat.

I made it just like the recipe called for with only one small difference. I bought egg whites in the carton instead of  separating the egg yolks from the whites like my mother used to do. This recipe is exceptional especially with strawberrys and whipped cream. Will be making this again.

Delicious! I’ve made it as a cake and as cupcakes, and both times it turned out great. I used room temperature egg whites, chilled the mixing bowl and beater, and beat the egg whites until they were almost frothing out of the bowl. I got 26 nice cupcakes, and they are perfect to have in the freezer for a quick portion-controlled dessert. I baked them 13 minutes with paper liners, but I don’t think the liners are necessary, and I won’t use them next time.

Loved it. I added too much almond extract unintentionally but it tasted fine.  I also didn't beat to stiff peaks, mine were medium. I made it as a birthday cake for my MIL and had to store it for two days so I kept it in a cake-keeper; it was still very moist.  Served it with Alton Brown's Macerated Strawberries recipe and whipped cream. https://altonbrown.com/macerated-strawberries-recipe/

Turned out excellent! I followed it ALMOST exactly...Sugar & cooking time changes.
I saw in some reviews to cut the sugar down a little, which helps because my dad is diabetic. I reduced it to 1/4c less and was still great.  Another change is the baking time. I had a slightly smaller springform bundt pan  as compared to the standard. Had to take out about 2 cups because my pan would've overflowed while baking and made those into cupcakes.  I initially timed the cake for 40min, but thankfully I checked it halfway thru and it was perfectly done already in about 20min! Nice, fluffy & delicious! Served with homemade mixed berry jelly & whipped cream. Addictive & family loves it!

I didn't change anything but next time I will set oven to 350.  I had to take it out of the oven 5 minutes sooner than called for.  Cake was delicious.

This cake was the best Angel Food Cake I've ever had!  It's perfectly soft, and so delicious!  No air pockets.  No falling.  Even soft fluffy texture throughout!

Great recipe. However have learned to break egg over sink and do one egg st a time placing whites in mixing bowl before going to next egg. Tried it once with carton of egg whites NOT SO GOOD!  Stick to breaking eggs. More work but better results!

I was nervous bc Angel food cake is so technical. It was SO tasty, and so relatively easy just by following the instructions. Definitely part of our family favorites now. SO MUCH better than store bought!!!!! worth the effort. with the leftover egg yolks I made key lime pie :)

Gluten-free via substitution of pastry flour with Pamela's gluten-free pancake and baking mix.  Results were even fluffier and lighter than regular flour.

Worth the work, family loved it, we could have eaten it all! Made it with homemade whipped cream and strawberries sliced sprinkled with powdered sugar and a bit of lemon juice. My hubby is already shooting out ideas of what else to serve it with for next time... so I guess I'll be making it again. Planning to make lemon curd using the yolks that I didn't want to toss. Thanks for a great recipe, and if anyone has other ideas for the yolks please let me know :)

This is a wonderful recipe! I split the batter into two 9" round cake pans to make a strawberry shortcake version Angel Food Cake and it came out PERFECT! Used another baker's suggestion of replacing 2 Tbsp. (Of 1 C.) AP Flour, and used both Almond & Vanilla Extracts. Baked 375 degrees for 32 minutes. Cooled in the cake pans upside down on a baking rack to keep the cake from sinking during cooking.

This was my first time to ever make angel food cake & I agree with others that it was much more moist than store bought of mixes! The whole family loved it!. I followed the directions (except substituting 7/8 c flour & 1/8 c of cornstarch for the cake flour) & whipped the egg whites forever. I made 24 muffins (no spray or liners - just soaked the pans afterwards & they came clean easily). Baked @ 375 X 13 minutes. Thanks!

Too vanillaey and eggy. Not really light. I couldn't mix it good, b/c it said to fold the flour into the mixture. It turned out lumpy. I didn't like it at all :(

I followed the recipe to the letter and it was perfect! A friend who makes homemade Angel Food cake very frequently, told me to wash the pan in very hot, soapy water and let it air dry in the dish drainer overnight to make sure that there's no oil, grease or residue on the pan. It works every time! Because we are a diabetic household I serve this without frosting and a few fresh, in season strawberries. It's sublime!

I made this recipe with my Kitchen Aid mixer and it still didn't come out right. I don't think it's the recipe, I think it is me. Can humidity cause problems?? I can't make homemade bread either. I made homemade Angel food cake when I was a kid and it came out fine, but that was in California. I live in Pa now, will that effect it?? Mary512

***. Updated- made it a second time bringing the eggs to room temperature and it turned out the way it should-- fantastic!!!

They need to specify in the recipe to use eggs at room temperature and not to get even a speck of yolk in the whites. My egg whites never got firm even after whipping for 20-25 minutes and my cake was only a couple inches thick because of this crucial tip. Wasted a whole dozen eggs.

Closest recipe I have found to my mom's recipe, which was, of course, the best! I followed exactly, but used 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp almond extract. Next time, I will add 2 tablespoonfuls of water, just a pinch more cream of tartar, and whip just a little longer than I did, I think I will find moist and fluffy perfection. Thank you for posting this.

I'm not the biggest fan of angel food, but had egg whites that needed to be used. This cake is great! I had a piece without frosting or fruit; it's really good. My husband and son always want angel food on their birthdays. This will be the recipe I use...no more box cakes for them.

Very easy to make- just use a very big bowl when whipping the egg whites! They came right up to the edge. Also, I don't know if it was something I did wrong or what, but the egg whites got foamy, then creamy, but they never really formed peaks. I whipped them for about ten minutes, too. They did become very, very stiff. I don't know if that counts. It is nice an foamy, pretty good sweet flavor. I was too young to remember eating the cake before, so I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like. I think it's ok, though!

BETTER  THAN A BAKERY ANGEL FOOD CAKE!! I made 2 of these for a church dinner to serve with peaches and cool whip. First 1 turned out beautiful, 2nd fell a little on 1 side (yes, I turned them upside down to cool). I may cut down on the sugar next time-it was very sweet. I made this in a 10 inch bunt pan and dusted the inside with the cake flour. Mine weren't pretty on the sides, but I think you could take a butter knife and scrape away the bumps. I was intimidated by this recipe because I had never separated an egg before or made peaks with them. But thanks to other reviewers saying whip till the cows come home, I just let my stand mixer go (10-15 min)! If I can make this, ANYONE CAN!! GOD BLESS!!

I made this in a loaf pan following the baking directions of a previous reviewer. No cake flour so i removed 2tbs of flour and replaced it with 2tbs cornflour and sifted 5 times.  Also eliminated the salt. This was my first angel food cake ever and I was worried but it turned out perfect. Put strawberry-mango compote over it with a big dab of lemon curd and it was delicious.

This was my first angelfood cake ever... and it got rave reviews and was positively delicious (and really easy too). I did buy the egg whites (just because I didn't have much time). I did receive a tip to use a damp papertowel to brush off the crumbs so the frosting didn't get clumped up with them... it was a good tip.

And I used the creamcheese whipped cream frosting... big hit!

I made this cake over the weekend.  After it cooled, I put it on a cake dish with a cover.  I continued to do some more house work, came back and there was one piece left.  All gone in an HOUR, my family LOVED it!!

This was my first attempt at making an Angel food Cake from scratch and I am so glad I did.  This was so much better than a boxed mix.  I made the Peach Sauce recipe from this site to serve over this and it really made this wonderful!

I had a smaller bundt cake pan, so I made 2/3 a recipe.  I did not change anything else and it turned out beautifully! ... Made it again for my daughters b-day with full angel food cake pan, this time using full recipe and again was beautiful and delicious!  The one reminder I would give is to let it cool completely before trying to turn it over.  I checked on it while it was still warm, and it began to come out of the pan.  when I took it out, it flattened/condensed a small amount.  Still wonderful, but next time I will not touch until completely cool!

Much better than store-bought.  The texture came out chewy and spongy, which how I think an Angel Food cake should be.  

Just so you know, apparently it's true that any water or tiny bit of egg yolk in with the egg whites will make them very hard to beat.  I made two batches of this separately.  For the first batch, the eggs whipped up great.  For the second batch, I had washed the bowl and dried it thoroughly, but it's possible it still had some moisture.  Then I got a teeny, tiny bit of egg yolk in with the whites.  I didn't see how that could matter, but it took 3 times as long to beat the whites before they started fluffing up.  The good news is they did eventually fluff up, so if that happens to you don't lose hope and throw them out. 

 I did one cake in a bundt pan and one in a spring form pan (without a center cone).  I was worried that not having an angel food cake pan would cause problems, but they both came out great.  They cooked evenly and the center didn't fall in or anything like that.

I've been using this recipe for a few years, and just realized I haven't reviewed it.  I didn't grow up with angel food cake.  I had the impression that it was plain, unexciting, sweet, dry . . . with a Styrofoam texture.  My husband was asking for an angel food cake, so I borrowed a pan from a girlfriend and made one.  It is *really* different from any other type of cake, and I was nervous about it.  But it turned out well!  My husband and daughter will cut off big pieces and eat them plain.  The smell reminds me of roasted marshmallows.  :-)  Even though I've made this plenty of times, I'm still not as comfortable making it as a regular cake.  But they love it so much, it's worth it.  ~~~Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I only book mark "never fail recipe", this is one of them. I zested one lemon to make a lemony angel food cake and the flavor turned out great.   I agree with the 350F, otherwise the cake will be too dark.

I have made this recipe a number of times now and every time it has turned out perfectly.  The only change I made was to use a bit of almond extract.  As an American living overseas this recipe is very much appreciated because we can't get angel food cake box mix here.  In my opinion, this tastes better than any box mix I've had.

I had 6 egg whites to use up after making hollandaise sauce, so I made half of this recipe in an 8" square pan and baked for 25 minutes. Easy and delicious recipe, no need for any changes. Folding the flour in very carefully and gently is the key, as is making sure you don't overmix. It's okay if there are still some small lumps. Will make again!

Followed measurements exactly and it made a wonderful angel food cake! I cooked this at 350 for 40 minutes because I was afraid of it getting too brown. Turned out lovely!

Had to make a smaller recipe, but it came out good. Maybe it was me but it was burning a bit. Still good. Would make again and check or see what I could do different to fix this. Not bad for the first time.

The bottom (which was the top of the cake while baking) was becoming crunchy while the top (bottom during baking) must not have been done yet. When I flipped this over and let it sit for the appropriate amount of time, it fell.

Nothing wrong with this recipe, but flavor not the greatest.  Next time I will decrease cream of tartar to 1 tsp and salt to 1/4 tsp.  Had a slight tang from the acid (cream of tartar) and I could taste salt. It did fall out of the pan when doing the upside down cooling trick; I think it could have cooked another 3-5 minutes and maybe it wouldn't have fallen. Great way to use up lots of egg whites after making 1 gallon frozen custard with our farm fresh eggs and goats milk!

If you have a Kitchenaid 5 quart stand mixer, you'll find that when you're beating the egg whites, it will reach the top of the bowl and almost flow over. I made the mistake of trying to fold the flour in the 5 qt bowl and ended up working it too much which resulted in the cake not rising. However, even with the cake only baking to half the size, the taste was wonderful. The next time I will transfer the egg whites to a larger bowl so I will have more room to fold the mixture. I used a little more than 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups. I didn't want too sweet of a cake. The taste was perfect.

Great recipe just as is. 
Sooooo good right out of the pan. 
Crispy outer texture, and soft melt-in-your-mouth moist cake goodness inside. 
Can't go wrong on this one!

I had really high hopes for this recipie. It WAS super fast and easy to prepare, but the end result was very dense and seemed almost undercooked even after browned. Not the light & fluffy cake I wanted, but still good.

This recipe was WAY too egg-y.  Like think quiche with sugar, and you've nailed this recipe.  Yes, it did have the consistency of angel food cake, but it tasted and smelled like eggs.

Oh, and as another reviewer posted, yes you can substitute baking soda for cream of tartar (at 1-1 ratio).

It was very delicious. I did substitute cream of tartar with baking powder since I didn't have any on hand. I also turned the heat down to 325 while baking. I will definitely make this again for my family.

This cake tastes AMAZING, BUT it stuck to the pan, so the top of my cake is falling apart.  I'm going to cover it with whipped cream icing and strawberries so it doesn't really matter, but has anyone else had this problem and how did you solve it?

My first attempt at making Angel food cake - came out perfect.  I do agree it is a little sweet so will reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup.

I made this wonderful cake for a birthday party, and it got great reviews. Very easy to put together! I had never made an Angel Food Cake before, and I was a bit apprehensive, as a past AFC cake made by my mother ended up in pieces on the floor during the upside-down step (became a FALLEN Angel Food cake..). This cake held up, though -- I think the trick is the bake it long enough.

I used a non-stick bundt cake pan, so the cake was a bit difficult to remove from the pan. It broke into two pieces, but overall worked out ok.

Topped it off with whipped cream and fresh strawberries soaked in sugar.

Okay, I did mine in muffin pans and let me tell you, dusting with flour is not good enough (unless maybe you want to use a whole lot of flour).  Don't be stupid like me and wait for it to really spring back at you.  If it is evenly brown, it is probably done.  I burnt all of mine and it was really sad.  The flavor was alright, and perhaps in a tube pan it's awesome and worth five stars, but I am guessing I'd still give it a 4.

I have made this recipe a couple of time now and it's always a big hit!  I never have cake flour on hand so I just subtract 2 Tbsp from 1 cup of all purpose flour.  I also make sure that I run the flour and sugar mixture through the sifter several times.

I cut all the ingredients by half (and only used 1/2 cup sugar) and baked these in regular sized muffin pan.  The halved recipe made 9 cakes.  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  Turned out perfect. Calories come to 76 per "muffin"

This recipe was great!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used all-purpose flour.  Like other reviewers, I made these into muffins and then made individual strawberry shortcakes.  I cut each muffin in half, removing the top, and put a spoonful of homemade whipped topping, a spoonful of cut up fresh strawberries, replaced the top of the muffin, and topped it off with another spoonful of whipped topping.  They turned out light, sweet, and easy to handle - and only approx 90 calories each!  Bonus!  This is a definite keeper!

This was the first dessert that has ever gone from the oven to the trash can. I had no problem with it rising or sticking. The taste & texture of this cake was horrible. My 8 year old spit this out so quick and trust me when it comes to sweets he is not hard to please. My husband who loves sweets said it was "nasty" and "tasted like eggs, only worse" sorry for the bad review but this recipe needs help. Will not make again...

I've made this recipe twice now, and both times it has turned out great! It always comes out golden brown and rises properly. The only problem with this is that the second time I made this cake I put it in for 42 minutes; it came out golden but in a few areas it began getting very dark. I would suggest putting the cake in for about 40 minutes, check it, and judge it from there.  Other than this, this recipe for Angel Food Cake is great and is sure to satisfy your sweet tooth without the fat other types of cakes have.   ENJOY!

I have a crazy story about this cake: I made this cake to give to the children at a daycare I was demonstrating kitchen skills at, so they could take it home to their parents. I snuck a piece out and we left. As my boyfriend was driving us home, I gave him a bite. He liked it so much that he closed his eyes and ran a stop sign! Don't eat this while driving lol. Very good, came out similar to Angel Food Cake I but a bit moister. Oh, and it did rise a little funny but it was ok (the ring of cake around the outer edge of the pan rose higher than the cake closer to the funnel hole)

The cake tastes great (I only put it in 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet enough) but for some reason the middle section sunk in!! I don't know what went wrong. But, the taste is there and I would certainly consider making it again.

A little denser than i would have liked.  Tasted liked angel food cake, but texture just wasn't there, but that could have been because i used 1C flour, minus 2tbsp,plus 1tbsp of cornstarch instead of cake flour.  Tastes even better though with whip cream and strawberries!!

Really good.  I'm confused by the recipe's instructions to invert on a bottle.  Huh? Wouldn't the cake fall out in chunks? I have now made this three times and I think I've perfected the folding technique.  It really makes a difference when you do it right!

This is perfect for me because I am lactose intolerant.  The cake was light, fluffy and delicious!  I cut the recipe and half and almost screwed it up by beating in the dry ingredients instead of folding them in gently, I lost some volume but it still came out amazing.  My husband and I ate it plain, we are usually chocolate people but this didn't even need anything extra.  Any other beginners give it a shot, its hard to mess up!

This is a brilliant cake.  It will turn out beautifully if you use the proper technique.  Do: follow this recipe exactly,   beat your egg whites to the proper volume, and use the proper folding technique so that you keep the volume from the beaten egg whites.  Its simplicity is part of this cake's elegance!

I made this last monday and it was my first time with an angel food cake. I scaled the ingredients because i had only 8 whites left. It's a wonderful cake, better the next days for me. I'll try it again for sure. It's a good way to use egg whites. Tanks for the recipe.

Very good!  We've made strawberry shortcake with this a few times.  We just chop up some fresh strawberries and sprinkle with sugar until they release a little juice.  Then we layer the cake with strawberries and whipped cream!  The cake itself is very sweet so I may try decreasing the sugar just a bit next time. Tastes great and we can eat it while dieting!!

I made these into cup cakes and it only needed to cook for 15 minutes. They were perfect! I love these. They didn't need any icing.

Very easy to put together and the taste was great.  I didn't have cake flour and just used all-purpose flour and I thought it turned out very moist.  Probably if I'd used cake flour, it would have had a finer texture, but the flavor was incredible.  I was amazed at how easy this was to prepare and my kids love it with whipped cream and strawberries.

This cake turned out great.  I prepared and baked it per the directions.  I did have to take it out a few minutes earlier than what the directions said as I was afraid it would burn.  It was very difficult to remove from the pan though.

The recipe sure is easy, but I thought the cake didn't have much flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time, I'd put more vanilla in it.

A good recipe but due to the loaf pan I used I overcooked the cake trying to get the center to firm up. So I worked around my mistake, chilled the cake and created "sandwiches" with the butterpecan ice cream I made with the leftover egg yolks. So delicious and they froze fantastically.

i really liked this although it didnt seem to rise as much as i suspected it would. i also changed it slightly by adding a can of crushed pinnapple with the juices drained and put a whip cream topping on it mixed with unsweetend cocoa. it was excellent then! :)

This was ok. I think I may have overmixed it a bit when folding in the dry ingredients, but it was hard to keep them from clumping. My cake also burned a little, even though I took it out before it was supposed to be done. It also wasn't quite as flavorful as other angel food cake I've had. May make again...

The absolute best Angel Food cake I have ever made or eaten!!  I am only sorry to say that I didn't do it justice by serving it with frozen fruit...it deserves fresh fruit and homemade whipped cream!!  I will make it again and again and will hand it down in my recipe collection!

I jut finished making this and it was good.  It does taste a little eggy.  I followed the directions to the T except for the type of pan that I used.  Not sure what it is, maybe I should have cooked it longer.  I took others advice and cooked for 30 mins.  It was really brown on top so I took it out. I will try it again with a proper bundt pan.

Great angel food cake recipe. Tastes delicious and it has a wondefully light texture. As mentioned by other reviewers, this recipe is a no-fail recipe. After folding in the flour mixture for a few minutes, I thought I had mixed it enough only to realize after pouring the batter into the pan that there were a few unmixed flour bubbles. It still turned out great but I will definitely bake it for only 35 minutes because the sides of my cake was burnt!

It was more dense than I would have liked but that may have been because I used 10 egg whites instead of 12. Very strong tartar taste which frosting didn't even cover up. Was a very easy recipe though and the upside down trick worked well. No deflation at all.

The cake tasted very good but due to my lack of culinary skills, it seemed I messed up -  the cake did not raise at all but was very flat indeed. I'm from Montreal and Starwberry Shortcake, that is, an angel cake (a well done one), in 2 layers, with strawberries in the middle and on top, covered with whipped cream, is a big hit in Montreal. The whole culinary techno-babble got the better of me. Too bad english isn't my mothertongue, maybe I wouldn't have missed it on my first try. Another review pointed it was very important to NOT open the oven during baketime (which I did) and to correctly fold the flour and sugar (which I didn't), that is without using a mixer but a spatula (which I didn't, of course). Probably due to all of that my cake did not raise, still the taste as good.

Great taste, easy to make (even if my arm really aches because I don't have a mixer!). The only problem I had was extreme sticking to the pan, which is partially down to the pan I used, I think.

I'm very sensitive to egg tastes in things and do not feel that this cake has an eggy flavour at all. This is because it uses egg whites, not egg yolks. To those who tasted a lot of egg, I'd recommend taking more care separating the egg whites from the yolks - you probably got some spare yolk in your mix that ruined the flavour.

Easy to make, especially for a first-timer (like me).  I took others' advice and baked for 30 minutes instead of 45... the cake came out perfectly.  Highly recommend this recipe!

The texture is different than the store bought ones but i'd say it is better. Spongier cake and sweeter (i liked it but some people might find it a tad bit too sweet). I baked it in a silicone pan and it came out beautiful. 30 minutes was enough for me and many have said the same so you might want to keep an eye on it. Enjoy, it's yummy!

I needed to use up leftover egg whites after making cream pies and settled on this recipe.  I used AP flour because I didn't have any cake flour.  The recipe was easy to make and the flavor was great.  Highly recommend!

This recipe was good, but not spectacular.  I took other reviewers' advice and cut the baking time to 30 mins which was enough, I put a piece of foil on top of the cake after 20 mins to prevent it from over browning, and I reduced the sugar to 1 cup.  I felt the texture was different than store bought angel food cake, it felt a little too spongy and a little wet, but it was moist and easy to make.

I make this for every special occasion for my wife - she loves it!  It's fast and simple - the hardest part is getting a dozen egg whites!   Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good!  It is light and tasty! I used the equal/sugar substitute and it was very sweet with only half of the calories!  I added some blackberries and raspberries with a little fat free whipped creme and it was a very good and light dessert!

Very Nice! My husband's favorite cake, so I made it for his birthday. It was a little too dark at 40 minutes, though, probably could have taken it out at 30-35 minutes.

My husband never liked angel food cake until I tried this recipe. He is already begging me to make it again! Thanks so much!

Great recipe.  I suggest spinning the sugar in the food processor, as some other recipes suggest.  I also cooked it for only 35 min. and it was perfect.

I discovered that this recipe is definitely better boxed mix, which I orignally questioned. While it didn't rise quite as high as boxed mix does, it had better flavor and was more moist. Surely one I will make again & again. Thank you!
