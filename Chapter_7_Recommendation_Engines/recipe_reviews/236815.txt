Yum! I made this  according to recipe but thought it was missing something  so I did make some changes... I used radiatore pasta (holds dressing better) added chopped onions and more kraut with juice - made a big difference - will make again for sure but I'm going to add chopped tomatoes and maybe green peppers

This is a great recipe to use with Corned Beef leftovers!  It's a perfect anytime dish by its self or with a sandwich.  If made with a smaller pasta it's great to put on crackers too.  This is a personal favorite of mine.  Thank you for sharing and I will be sharing this my friends who love Corned Beef as much as I do.

I really really really wanted to like this.  I love Reuben anything - sammies, casseroles, dip - so I thought this would be awesome.  I used the deli thin sliced corned beef and shredded my own Swiss.  I also used radiatore pasta just because I like the way it looks.  I started out using the recommended amount of dressing, but it definitely needed more, so I doubled it and by the time it was served the dressing all but disappeared.  I seems it was soaked up by the pasta but the flavor was gone.  I'd suggest waiting until the last minute before serving  it to keep the dressing on the pasta instead of soaked up in it.

This was ok...I halved the recipe and used radiatore pasta instead of bow ties. This was nice to try for something different, though I don't know if I would make it again. Thanks for sharing. :)
