This was incredibly simple and delicious. I cooked and used 2 to 3 strips of real bacon and used the little grease left from the bacon in the pan for added flavor. It's not much so I wasn't worried about saturated fats. I will cook this recipe again and again.

I did not know that mustard greens are very bitter until I ate these. I did not care for this recipe but I think it's because I probably wouldn't like mustard greens in any form UNLESS I could cook them in a way to take the bitterness out. Probably this is an acquired taste and anyone who likes the bitterness would love this recipe.

I LOVE this recipe. It's quick easy and tastes amazing. I added a little butter to it (about a teaspoon) and that worked well with the other ingredients.

Great base recipe! What I did different (only because this is what I had on hand): used olive oil instead of peanut oil oyster sauce instead of fish sauce added a heaping teaspoon of sambal oelek and I forgot onion powder. Added some sliced polish sausage as my protein Turned out delicious

Used real bacon and onions, vegetable oil instead of fish sauce.  Added a little apple cider vinegar, cause that's the way my mom used to make them.

Really delicious, quick and simple.  We did make a few slight changes that we would recommend.  1. We added a teaspoon of sesame oil when when cooking the garlic and bacon, and since we love onion, we added a half of a chopped red onion in to that mix as well.  The only other change was when platting we added a teaspoon of organic honey to offset some of the saltiness of the dish - absolutely delicious - no pic - because we ate it to quick.

These were really good. The fish sauce is great with them. I never thought of pairing the two but I always have fish sauce in the fridge. I added equal parts sugar and onion powder and also added diced red onion and garlic in with the bacon once it was crispy. I juiced one lemon and also added some red pepper flakes.

This was easy and delicious! I made a couple of changes to the recipe. I substituted half a fresh onion for the onion powder and added soy sauce because I didn t have fish sauce. Next time I m going to add a few drops of sesame oil and a couple shakes of roasted sesame seed.

These turned out great! The only difference I made was I used Soy Sauce and 1 Tsp of Siracha at the end because I didn't have any fish sauce. I will be making these again.
