This recipe is GREAT. My mom who hates coffee even loved it. Were going to make this weekend again. IT tastes exactly like Starbuck Frappachino. I loved. And I have to say I did add about 2 teaspoons of real vanilla (Mexican) and it all tasted good.

This was great for an afternoon "pick-me-up". I added 1 1/2T of espresso powder for an extra pleasing coffee flavor. We really enjoyed this.

Although I don't have the biggest sweet tooth in the world, I loved this, but then again, I have a hard time passing up ice cream. Needless to say, the kids thought it was incredible.

This was a bit too sweet for me, although not bad.  I prefer the Mocha Fusion shake made with ice (also listed on this site).  That shake is a lot better and easier to make, since it doesn't require ice cream.

This was very yummy. The coffee flavour wasn't too strong, which is a problem I've had with some other iced coffee drinks. I actually ended up downing the whole batch--it was that tasty.

This was so easy and very satisfying!  Used my blender stick in a tall plastic cup instead of getting out the blender.  Would suggest combining the instant coffee with the milk a few minutes prior to making so the crystals dissolve better.  Also, I cut the recipe in half to make a single serving since I was making it directly in the cup.  Terrific!

This was so delicious and simple. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough. The next time I make them, I'll plan on doubling the recipe for 3 people.

Very good! Added ~ 1/2 C of crushed ice and ~ 1 t. of vanilla.  Also took another suggestion & used Hershey's syrup (about 3 T) instead of cocoa / water.
