This dish was juicy and full of flavor.  The cream cheese filling is very rich and I was surprised how full I was after eating only two (which is probably the healthy size portion).  I didn't have jalape単os on hand so I substituted a half can of diced chiles instead.  I also added some chopped bell pepper, dehydrated onion mix and garlic to the cream cheese mixture.  I did not put any jelly on top because I can only handle a little bit of spice.  Honestly, I don't think it needed any other flavor on top.  Next time I make this, I will put it under the broiler for two minutes to top it off as I'd like the bacon a little more crispy and the cheese oozing out the sides a little burnt.

I will make these again very soon and purchase the pepper jelly that I didn't happen to have on hand.  The only thing I did was to use shishito peppers rather than jalapenos, but that was a minor change since my peppers were quite spicy.  I would put out a warning to be careful not to overcook the chicken.  I'd start checking at 25 minutes because mine was a touch overdone.  I must admit, however, to having turned on the broiler for the bacon for one minute at the very end.  But still this is a company-worthy recipe for sure!  YUM!  Thanks!

didn't work out for me using tenders.  Cheese would not stay wrapped up in tender.  For the last pieces I just put the ingredients on top.

My daughter made this dish for us. It was delicious. Very flavorful. Mix of sweet and spicy was spot on. We will definitely make these again.

The family loved them. I followed the directions as it was written because it was the first time making them.

I've found that pickled jalape単os work better than fresh. Also my version would put a small taste of BBQ sauce on the chicken followed by a sprinkle of brown sugar replacing the pepper jelly.

I do not cook often and this was the first time I ever tried making stuffed chicken and I have to say I'm proud of myself! :) I didn't have fresh, so I used canned and it came out pretty good but I always prefer the fresh and I used a roasted raspberry chipotle sauce from Costco. I will definitely be making this again!!

I didn't use any jalapeno because my husband hates them.  This recipe still came out wonderful.

Loved this! Enough said! You really don't even need the pepper jelly because these stand out on their own without it. Perfect and thank you for sharing!
