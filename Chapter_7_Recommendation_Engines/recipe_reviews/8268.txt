This is just one variation of a tried and true, classic pound cake with a standard list of ingredients and their measurements - 1 c. butter, 3 c. sugar, 6 eggs, 3 c. flour, a bit of flavoring and either a cup of buttermilk (usually with 1/4 tsp. of baking soda), a package of cream cheese, a cup of sour cream or, in this case, a cup of whipping cream.  Some use cake flour, some all purpose flour, but the more you make this pound cake you'll find you won't even need a recipe for it anymore because the "formula" is so simple and straightforward, the ingredients and measurements like science.  All variations are dependable and excellent but...  this recipe is a little different from others  in that it has a lighter, less dense crumb and is soooo tender and soft.  I attribute that to the fact that cake flour and whipping cream are used.  Exceptional, with expertly written instructions for those not familiar with the techniques necessary to make a perfect, heavenly pound cake. (The eggs are the only leavener in this type of cake for instance, so the creaming of the butter and sugar, then adding the eggs one by one to keep the batter emulsified and aerated is critical!)  I used this batter for cupcakes today, adding about 1/4 cup of mullti-colored jimmies (fun!) and frosted them with a simple buttercream frosting.

I'm really excited about this recipe. I'm able to configure it and do what I want to it. I'm making it for Thanksgiving right now. I added a small packet of strawberry jello and a cup of blended frozen strawberries to turn it into a strawberry poundcake. Lawd ha mercy... talking about good stuff! I'm an eating black man...

We have made this cake for YEARS and it has always been a favorite. You need to add a LOT of vanilla or other flavor. We have found that it takes several tablespoons of vanilla to get any vanilla flavor in the cake. We have also tried chocolate - again not much flavor. The cake is very good, eventhough it has little added flavor.

EXCELLENT!  I make this recipe all the time and it is wonderful!  I use all purpose flour and just remove one Tablespoon of flour from each cup.  I've also tried using coffee creamer when I dont have heavy cream and it works great!  This cake is really good with a butter rum topping!

When I was growing up, my aunt always made a whipping cream pound cake on special occasions. Now I've taken over this tradition and this recipe is just about like hers. It's always a huge hit at our gatherings! Most family members want to take some home if there's any left at the end of the day! I recommend this recipe; it is so easy to make and tastes just right.

This is a wonderful pound cake recipe!  My standard recipe that I've been using for many years is a bit heavier with an additional 1/2 cup butter, and an 8 oz. package of cream cheese. I didn't think I'd ever find another pound cake recipe that I'd enjoy as much my old standard.  This recipe is a very nice surprise!  I made this cake exactly as written to take to my granddaughter's third birthday party, and it received rave reviews.  One woman said that it tasted like a cross between a homemade angel food cake and a pound cake.  She renamed it, "angel pound cake", and took home a very large piece.  My sons claim that they prefer my "older" recipe; I've decided that next time, I'm not going to mention that I tried a different recipe. I, on the other hand, LOVE this new recipe.  The next time I make this, I'm going to throw in a good amount of Irish Cream, because I think the lightness of this cake is what makes it so adaptable to different flavorings.  Great recipe; lighter than the standard, and very, very tasty.  Thank you so much for posting it.

An AR search for a pound cake that didn't need sour cream, like my usual recipe (because I was all out) turned this up, and what a fabulous find! It's everything a pound cake should be: dense, moist, buttery rich with a tender crumb. This is it. The recipe is basic, as well as quite forgiving. I only had half the whipping cream called for, so I subbed 1/2 cup of buttermilk for the missing cream, and added a couple of pinches of baking soda, which neutralizes the acid in the buttermilk. I stayed with the 2 tsp of vanilla extract, but also added a dash each of almond, maple, coconut, orange and lemon extracts. The result was a delightfully, subtly complex flavor. It made an outstanding base for pureed strawberries and ice cream, and turned the ordinary into a memorable dessert. Subbing Splenda for half of the sugar (equal measurement) turns out just the same as if you had used all sugar. I sprinkled the pan with sugar after greasing it, and the crust was attractively shiny, giving a little punch of sweetness. Note: Cutting the ingredients in half fits perfectly in a 9"X5" loaf pan. A++

This cake took 20 min. longer to cook than it stated in the recipe.  It tastes ok but is nothing like a pound cake.  It is more like a regular "cake".  I am sure that I will not be baking another.  Lana

My mother started making this recipe over 25 years ago.  It was an instant hit with the family and has become a holiday tradition ever since.  She passed away several years ago and I now carry on the tradition every year making sure my father and brother are among the first recipients.  (Which they basically DEMAND that they receive their poundcakes every year)!

We've always put the recipe into two loaf pans, and I now make about 60 loaves each Christmas season to give to co-workers and friends.

If I could give this recipe a 10 star rating, I would!

This cake was delicious. The bottom had a nice chewy crunch to it. I did make a few changes though. I ran out of cake flour so I used 2 cups cake flour and 1 cup (less 1tbsp) all purpose flour. In addition to the 2 tsp of vanilla extract, I used 2 tsp of almond extract and 1 tsp of lemon extract. I also used salted butter. I didn't have a problem with the cooking time but I did start baking at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes and 350 for about another 15-20 minutes. My husband was praising the taste before he had even finished chewing. His tolerance for sugar is much lower than mine and he didn't think it was too sweet. I will definitely be making this again especially since its such as easy recipe.

If half stars could be given, I would give this a 3 1/2 star. It took about 20 mins longer to cook. It had a good flavor but I felt like it need a quarter of a cup less flour because i kept getting a floury aftertaste. About two days later the cake started to get hard as well. It was very sweet as others complained and I like sweet pound cake. But a 1/2 cup to a 1 cup less of sugar would be better for this cake. Would I make this again? hmmmmm.......I would give it another chance so with that being said. Try the recipe out.

Great pound cake recipe if you like the nice, crunchy outside layer.  The texture is light, spongy, and still dense.  I baked my in a bundt pan and found that I needed an additional 15 minutes.  I also used a TBSP of vanilla based on other reviews - next time I may add two.  The final product didn't have as strong of a vanilla flavor as I like.

Arg. It ended up getting stuck in the pan so about 1/3 of it looks like ... but it sure tastes wonderful!! Love how perfectly moist and *flavorful* it is! The outer pieces have a delicate crispiness from the sugar, providing a slight chewiness on the exterior. It's heavenly, really. I subbed half AP flour because I ran out of cake...and skipped the almond because I was out of that too. Another thing this recipe is good for: reminding me I'm out of the basics. =)  Good luck! Grease that pan well!!

This is a great cake that my family loves.....although it should be baked at 350 not 325. Mine is still in the oven after almost 2 hours.....It will be divine once done. I should have known better since I've made this before.

This was my first attempt at making a pound cake.  I found that it was relatively easy to make, but took almost twice as long to bake.  I used a silicone bundt pan, so I'm not sure if that is why.  This was also my first attempt at making anything in a silicone bundt pan, so I'm not sure if that made the difference in cooking time, or if I needed to adjust the temperature.  I ended up putting the temp up to 375 for the last 15 minutes.  
Overall, the sugary crust on the outside is fabulous, and the inside is so nice and moist!  I will say though, it is a tad too sweet, so maybe eliminating 1/2 to a full cup of sugar will make a difference.  I also took others' advice and used all purpose flour, removing 1 tbsp per cup. I did not have any almond extract, so I used an extra tsp of vanilla, which gave the cake great flavor!
I kept the presentation quite simple with just a dusting of icing sugar.
Overall, I am very impressed with this recipe!  I brought half of it to work, and it has since disappeared!

It was more like a regular cake than a pound cake and lacked flavor. This was not what I was looking for. However, when made with flour minus 1 TBSP per cup and an additional 1 tsp of vanilla and ½ tsp of almond ... it makes a wonderful 5 star pound cake.

My texture came out perfect with a nuce crust on the outside, and a soft semi-dense almost white color on the inside.  However, I usually follow a recipe exact the first time, then see if I need changes.  This needs something.  It lacked flavor other than maybe that tiny reach of flour flavor. Not sure if it needs salt, or like other and double the extrcts.  A little let down after seeing the reviews.  I might make again, then again I might not.  Made a french buttercream to pipe on slices and place fruit on top, it helped with the taste, but still lacked something.  Even my kids asked what was missing.

This was ok but nothing really special.  I would eat it again but I think I would prefer one of the other pound cakes with more flavor.  Thanks though.

This is a superb recipe -- with one catch.  I more than halved the sugar and it's still "somewhat " sweeter than what we're used to.  This is a great plain cake for frosting and decoration.  Great recipe!

My mother makes a fabulous whipping cream pound cake every Thanksgiving and will NOT give up the recipe. I found this one and it's almost as good as hers! The only thing I would change is the amount of sugar-both my husband and I thought it was too sweet. Other than that, it's a very great cake. Thanks so much!

Wow. This bread is so freakin good..( I'm munching on it right now!)  I have little baking experince and have no idea what a tube pan is.  I used 2 loaf pans, and they came out PERFECT.  I used half whipping cream and half french vanilla coffee mate.  Also doubled vanilla extract.  Flavor IS hard to taste, but is divine none the less.  GREAT RECIPE and SO EASY!!!

This recipe was given way too many stars. I really like how the crust is crispy. However, when the cake first comes out it is moist and spongy and the way a pound cake should be but after it cools it is no longer spongy and moist. It becomes dry.  I also used 2 cups sugar instead of 3 and thought it was still too sweet. I had pound cake in the past where the pound cake remained moist no matter what and that's the recipe I'm looking for.

This is one of my 5 star recipes - love it.  Have a question - Can I make ahead of time and freeze? - putting confectioners sugar on after thawed?

Absolutely perfect!  Perfect to serve with fresh mascerated berries and some whipping  cream! Be sure to generously grease the pan.  I did run a knife between the cake and pan before I turned it out.  Crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside!    The almond extract is a must without it the cake does not have enough flavor.  I did bake mine about 6 minutes more than called for but every oven is different.

I followed the recipe exactly, and the cake came out beautiful. It tasted weird on my tongue, almost the texture of sand. I gave it to my neighbor and he loved it so I guess its just me. I have my own excellent recipe for a creme cheese pound cake so I will stick with that from now own.

Delicious and moist. I halved the recipe and baked in it a loaf pan (had to bake for about 75 minutes to get done in the middle). I served slices with a spoonful of canned cherry pie filling and a dollop of Cool Whip on top. Would be great with strawberries or a drizzle of chocolate as well! A versatile cake that I'll definite make again!

Awesome! Got rave reviews from the family. Delicious crunch to the crust needs no frosting. Dusted lightly with powdered sugar (mostly to hide imperfections from baking). I served it with macerated berries. Will definitely make again--no changes necessary.

This makes a wonderful pound-type cake (now quite a traditional pound).    Love the texture and the end result.   Complaints about not enough flavor so suggest you use only pure vanilla becuase it does make a difference.

This cake is moist and dense enough as a pound cake for my taste.  However, it tastes kind of eggy, so next time I will be more heavy handed with the flavoring.  I baked this in two 6x3 pans, and it rose well without overflowing.  DEFINITELY beat the butter and sugar thoroughly as directed to incorporate enough air for a light pound cake.

This is a tasty cake, heavy but with a fine crumb when sliced.  I used a serrated knife and a sawing motion for best results.  The recipe as written did not seem to have enough vanilla flavor so I added a whole lot more, about 4 Tablespoons of pure extract, and it was still understated.  I don't know where that flavor went, maybe it just bakes out after such a long time in the oven.  There's no specification for salted versus unsalted butter; I used unsalted but after a quick batter taste I felt I had to add a half teaspoon salt to balance some of the sweetness.  I guess if you used salted butter, you could leave that out. I did not reduce the amount of sugar becaue I have found that it sometimes affects the structure and tenderness of the finished product by altering the end result of the creaming process. Overall I'm pretty happy with this recipe after ramping up the flavorings.  A good post!

Very good cake,  I learned how to make this from my grandmother.  I ususally use 3 sticks of butter instead of 2.

MY MOM MAKES THIS CAKE FOR ME EVERY YEAR FOR MY BIRTHDAY SINCE I WAS YOUNG(AT MY REQUEST)  I ACTUALLY WATCHED HER MAKE IT YESTERDAY FOR MY BDAY AND IT IS ALMOST EXACTLY HER RECIPE. SHE USES HALF LEMON AND HALF VANILLA EXTRACT.  THIS RECIPE HAS BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR DECADES AND I FOUND IT ONLINE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS CAKE!*edit* she also cooks this cake for about 1 hr at 325 and turns down the oven to 300 for the last 20-25 mins based off of the oven and how fast its browing.

Very good pound cake. I only made the following few changes based on other reviews. Added 2 tablespoons vanilla, 1 teaspoon almond extract and had to bake it for 1 hour and 23 minutes. After an hour cover the cake with foil so top does not burn. Added glaze which is consisted of powered sugar, vanilla and milk.

This is my favorite pound cake so far!  I did make a few modifications to maximize the flavor of the pound cake. I did use the almond flavoring and I doubled the vanilla flavoring. Also, I didn't have "cake flour" so I just double sifted all purpose flour and used 2.5 cups instead of 3 cups. Also for added flavor I did a basic rum glaze (water, sugar, butter, and rum flavoring). I poked tiny holes in the pound cake (with a toothpick) before pouring the glaze over the cake so the flavor would really "sink in." The end result was a very moist, flavorful pound cake. I will definitely be making one of these again and very soon! Happy Baking!

Wonderful cake with the most incredible texture!  I did use cake flour, increased the vanilla/almond extract a bit and used about 1/2 cup hazelnut coffee creamer in place of some of the heavy cream.  The one thing missing in the reviews is a warning about how much batter this recipe makes.  I used two 9x5 loaf pans (baked for 1 hour and 5 minutes) and the cake spilled over the edges....alot!  It didn't drip in the oven but made very odd shaped loaves which had to have the edges trimmed off.  Not the most appealing look for a pound cake!  In the future, I will use three loaf pans or perhaps a bundt pan and one loaf pan.  Excellent cake, well worth the time and....it makes alot!

Like others, I doubled the extracts and used 1 TBSP less per cup of all-purpose flour. Halved the recipe and made mini-cupcakes. If you do this, be careful not to overbake! Definitely use the toothpick test. Mine took around 20 minutes. Flavor was good, very almond-y, much like a butter cookie. Appearances are not so great; cupcakes were flat and didn't hold shape very well. I frosted with the frosting recipe from "Wednesday Cookies" off this site. Good recipe, but will make as bundt as directed next time. *NEXT TIME IS HERE* Cake turned out PERFECTLY. I didn't have almond extract, so I tripled the vanilla. Delicious, light and beautiful! Didn't frost it and was still very flavorful. 5 stars!

I made this pound cake for Easter and LOVED it!  After reading other reviews that said you couldn’t really taste the flavoring, I didn’t even bother to add any.  I just made it as it was posted (without the almond extract) and it is so rich and delicious.  My husband loves it.  The cake is not too sweet, but just right.

As someone else mentioned, I also used regular flour and just used 1 TB less per cup.  It turned out fine.  However, the cake took about 1 hour and 40 minutes to cook for me.  I used an angle food cake pan so I’m not sure if that was the reason or not. 

Regardless, I’ll be making this cake again.  It’s a keeper!

this cake turned out so delicious. It was moist and tender-but not too. I added some blueberries and sprikled a generous helping of sugar in the raw before baking and made killer blueberry muffins. I also added a little more whipped cream-because it was left and a tbsp or so of cooking oil. Everyone who tried these was so impressed!

This cake tasted really good, although I used half as much sugar and it was too sweet still.

I left out the lemon flavoring.

 It has a good flavor. I would make it again and cut the sugar down to 3/4 of a cup.

The negative reviews are all correct!  This cake took ridiculously longer than what the recipe stated.  I understand ovens are all different, but the time should be within a 10 minute variance.  It took me an extra 40 minutes to bake through.  The flavor was also flat and lacking.  I have made a great cream cheese pound cake with cake flour and that is so much better than this recipe.   The only reason I even bothered with this recipe was to use up a half gallon of heavy whipping cream my husband mistakenly bought for half and half!   I even added an overflowing tablespoon of vanilla, and still not flavorful.

I had some strawberries that needed to be used up, so I tossed them in a pan with a bit of sugar and water, and made a nice strawberry sauce out of them. I was going to run to the store and pick up a package of those strawberry shortcake shells that you can find in the bakery department, but then I thought "why not make my own cake?" I'm so glad that I chose this recipe!  I cut the recipe in half, and baked in (2) 7" x 3" pans for exactly 45 minutes. They turned out perfect! I sliced one of the cakes and placed some fresh strawberries and blackberries around the slices so that I could take a pretty picture! It turned out so pretty, I think I'm going to serve it like that, and put that strawberry sauce in the freezer for another time! Thanks for the recipe!

I prepared this recipe as is. I found it very dry and with a texture that resembled more of Angel cake than pound cake. I made half the recipe. I made them into couple cupcakes and mini bundt type. I followed the recommendations related to temperature and dark pans. I just don't exactly know what went wrong. The grainy texture was not necessarily bad but I guess that could be related to the cake flour. BTW, this is the first time I bake something using cake flour and no leavening agent. I am still puzzled as of why it came out so dry. I know recipes are a set of instructions not guaranteed results. As a seasoned baker and cook I have to say that this recipe lacks moisture. I will experiment with it as I do believe it has potential to be a good recipe, but overall I was not impressed. I do however given the outcome made my own raspberry sauce. This made it edible and really delicious. I would say on its own it lacks moisture, with a fruit sauce or ice cream...then it IS something! I do recommend to stick with the ratios of flavorings a bit more than that can make this cake overpowering. Oh and one last thing you can even try to use a bit less sugar (about a few tablespoons less) and you will still have a good tasting cake with just the right amount of sugar.

I was looking for an alternative to Budin Ingles, which is like a pound cake with candied fruits added to it and served during the Christmas/New Year holidays  here in Uruguay. I followed the recipe til the end, then added candied fruit pieces, raisins and dried blueberries. It seemed awfully sweet to me, but my audience liked it and that's what's important!

I agree with some of the other reviewers.  It is very sweet.  I also had to add an extra 20 minutes for it to cook through.  Otherwise, it was an easy recipe to follow, and it did come out moist/soft.  I won't be cooking this one again, there are so many others to try! :)

This is our families go to cake when we want a pound cake. My boyfriend and friends just loves it. Great flavors, easy to make. Just follow the recipe exactly and it's the best cake you will ever make. It's light and not dense as other pound cakes.

Absolutely delicious. My family loves this pound cake. We took it to a gathering & it was gone so fast. Next time we went for a gathering & regrettably did not bring it, my sister demanded I give her the recipe so she could go to the store & buy the ingredients so I could make it right there at the party. Awesome recipe! Thank you!

Very good pound cake. I made in a bundt pan and cooked for about 10 minutes less then stated on the recipe. I took another reviewers advice and added an additional tsp of vanilla and almond extract. Served with cool whip and berries. Very tasty! I think w/out the additional vanilla and almond extract it would have been bland.

I was looking for an old fashion type pound cake recipe to which I could add home grown blueberries .  This was perfect .  My grand-daughter wanted to learn to bake a pound cake.  She prepared it exactly as in the recipe .. Just omitting the almond flavoring .  Once the batter was ready she added two cups of blueberries which had been tossed with flour , then baked as directed.  The cake rose beautifully and the blueberries were distributed evenly throughout the cake.  I would definitely make again.

Absolutely fantastic! I made it just as the recipe said, although I think my eggs weren't completely room temperature. Didn't make a difference, the cake turned out great! I ended up using a 6" loaf pan and a 10" bundt pan, and there was plenty of batter to fill both up completely.

OK.  I made this cake last night, May 25, 2016.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and here's what I can say about it.  Everyone loved it.  It taste great. It's not too sweet.  It's not dry.  It goes awesome with fresh strawberries and whipping  cream.  Now, as for the baking pans.  I used a spring form pan from Ikea.   It's a 3 piece pan so you can bake it like  bundt cake or like a large one layer cake.  I used the bundt insert for it.  In using this pan, it meant also using a small loaf pan, the measurements being: 3.75" x 2.5" x 8".   Walmart Brand, Mainstay.  A 3 piece, loaf pan/bread pan disposable set.  Ok, that's important because when I used the pan from Ikea, I could see immediately, it would be too much and would spill over so made a small loaf in addition to the bundt cake.   We ate the one in the  loaf pan last night.  :)  Saved the large one for today.  :)    
As for baking time, the one made in the loaf pan, was done in about 30 minutes and the bundt cake pan was done right at 60 minutes.  I will definitely be making this again.  There's nothing wrong with the recipe, as written.  
Thought, for those who say they had problems: (1) use butter  Real butter, not margarine and not a butter spread substitute, just plain, real, regular butter.  I used salted.  Also, make sure you're using heaving whipping cream.  It has a higher fat content that the standard whipping cream.  Use nothing smaller than large eggs.  I used 6 jumbo sized eggs.  Make sure your cake.

Cake was wonderful........I used 2 teaspoons of lemon and 1 vanilla.  My quick icing to drizzle over the cake was only powdered sugar and squeezed lemon juice.  The cake disappeared quickly! I will be using this recipe over and over again.
Oven temperatures vary, so using the suggested temp - it took a little longer in my oven to bake.  So I would say just insert a toothpick or sharp knife after the given time to see if the cake is done.  If not, give it extra time. Start with extra 10 minute time frames until its done.

My 9-year-old son made this cake for the family and all agreed it was delicious with just the right pound cake consistency and moistness.  He used the optional almond and thought it was a bit strong--perhaps 1/2 tsp instead?  Now, if you'll excuse me, we have a kitchen to clean up!

Very good, basic pound cake, but not quite the recipe I've been looking for. This is a very light, fluffy, simple pound cake with great flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. I have been looking for a denser pound cake recipe like the older ladies at church used to make. This wasn't it, although it was very tasty.

This was a very good cake. I was looking for something a little lighter than my very good, but really dense 7-up cake. This cake was a little lighter and fluffier. For the butter lovers out there, this recipe is very similar to the one on the back of the Swans Down cake flour box. That recipe uses 3 sticks of butter with the other ingredient proportions the same, except for the extracts. I assume that that would add richness. I used 3 cups sifted cake flour 1/2cup of BP to add lift..1/2 teaspoon each of almond and lemon extract..and 3 teaspoons of vanilla extract. I also put cake in cold oven and set temp to 300..(this helps create the sugary crust) cooked for 1hr 20 min in my bundt pan.Yummy.

I tried this recipe with no variations. It turned out perfectly! It was moist, light, sweet but not too sweet. I topped it with a cream cheese frosting that I added milk to make it a "pour-able" consistency. My boyfriend LOVED it. I took the rest to work and it has been devoured. I will definitely make it again. The cake did take well over 70 minutes to bake. It took closer to an hour and 45 minutes before a toothpick came out clean. So certainly check it at 70 minutes but I doubt if it will have baked all the way through.

After reading the other recipes, I was afraid of the cake being too sweet or not flavorful enough... So I cut the sugar down to 2 3/4 cups (but 3 cups would have been fine) and I doubled the vanilla extract and I did add the almond plus 1 tsp rum extract... Which was almost too much. I added the extra extract cause I tasted the batter and I should have known better because the flavor always intensifies after you bake it. Pound cake isn't supposed to be super flavorful. It's supposed to taste light and buttery. Next time I'll just go with following the recipe (which I should have done in the first place) because I can tell I would have loved it. Also.. I did add a 2 tbsp of extra butter because I only had heavy whipping cream which has less fat than heavy cream.. And the texture was perfect. Follow the recipe exactly! Anyone who says the flavor is off must of never had regular pound cake to compare it too.

Just about the best pound cake I have ever made! Took to work & every one raved about it and asked for the recipe. It does take alot of beating, but well worth the effort. Has a very dense texture & would make strawberry shortcake. Thank you for this excellent recipe!

This recipe was good but not the very best pound cake I have ever tasted. I followed the recipe exactly so my results were as expected. The cake itself had a nice flavor and the crust. I think the almond flavoring adds a nice touch for flavor.  The areas of improvement for this cake would be that the texture is a little dry. This is not really a moist pound cake. Also, the butter flavor is very subtle so this cake actually tasted closer to a regular yellow cake with a little twist. It's a nice change but I'll keep looking for that truly home made pound cake recipe.

This cake is light, fluufy and super moist.  I did alter the recipe the second time I baked it to give it more flavor. I used 1tsp.vanilla, 1tsp.lemon and 1tsp.orange.  The flavor was much better!

I was so scared the batter was going to overflow in my pan because it came up within 1 inch of the top before baking.  It didn't though, surprisingly.  This made a wonderfully dense and fine textured cake.  Changes I made:  omitted almond extract (didnt' have any), doubled the vanilla, and added 1/2 tsp. creme bouquet.

Definitely moist with a chewy crust.  A deliciously true pound cake.  This one goes into my recipe box.

I have never had a pound cake before, hence cannot compare. But this turned out to be great. I halfed the recipe and doubled the vanilla, it was perfect.Will definitely make again, with maybe chocolate chips/Orange juice.

A *WONDERFULLY* MOIST, DENSE AND FLAVORFUL POUND CAKE THAT TASTES GREAT ALL ON ITS OWN. I CAN IMAGINE THIS POUND CAKE TOPPED WITH LUSCIOUS FRESH FRUIT WITH FRESH WHIPPED CREAM ON TOP, OR ICE CREAM DRIZZLED WITH CHOCOLATE AND CARAMEL SAUCE. YUMMY! ARE YOU HUNGRY YET? MAKE THIS RECIPE!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!
