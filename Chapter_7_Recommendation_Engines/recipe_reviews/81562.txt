Actually, this recipe is incomplete. I hail from Hyderabad. I don't see any instruction to layer the meat and the rice. Although we suggest 1:3 water for rice, this is not standard. You must vary the water according to your rice. And yes, please use a good basmati rice for best results. Using about 2/3rd of the water required to make the rice, cook rice separately till half cooked. Now place a layer of chicken 'curry' then a layer of rice then chicken again and top off with rice. Each layer of rice should be sprinkled with a saffron solution: soak about a teaspoonful of saffron in a cup of milk  before you start cooking the chicken. This will be well soaked by now. Sprinkle half of it over each layer of rice. Cover pot tightly. If you do not have a tight fitting lid, make a stiff dough with wheat or all purpose flour and seal the pot. Now place it on a low-medium flame and finish the cooking: about 15 minutes. Try this. A lot of trouble but worth the effort. Hopefully I justified my two star rating.

This recipe was excellent! Very different from the mughalai version of biryani. I made a few modifications though because I did not have all the ingredients. I used biryani masala (available at all indian grocery stores) instead of cloves. I also doubled the quantity of chili peppers bcoz I used the tiny red Thai chilis and we like it hot in our house:) I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and added 2 potatoes too (I love potatoes in biryani). The recipe is definitely a keeper.Thank you for submitting it.

I wanted to tell everyone that there is no need to temper the yogurt. It will not ruin the dish if you add it all at once. It may look curdled but it is fine. Lipstickfetish, you didnt need to throw away the dish! Sorry!

If you have never cooked with yogurt you should know about 'tempering' before you make this dish. Sorry to say that I found out the hard way, and after 30 minutes of cooking ruined the entire dinner when the addition of yogurt caused the sauce to curdle! Determined to get dinner on the table, I did remake the entire recipe- this time using great care to add the liquid slowly to the yogurt. The end result was good and I will make it again.

Excellent combination of flavours.  Instead of water, use chicken stock by dissolving a stock cube in boiling water.  Will go soggy if too much liquid is added.

This recipe is virtually indestructible. I made A LOT of substitutions and still the flavor came out rich, the texture was great, and the presentation beautiful. I didn't have cloves, so I substituted cinnamon. I didn't have whole chicken so I used chicken breast, and to compensate for flavor, used a bullion cube when adding water. I didn't have curry leaves so I used dried curry and I didn't have green peppers so I used one red pepper and cayenne powder. I didn't have any problem with curdling -- used a thick Dutch yogurt. I didn't have jasmine rice so I had to use risotto. I can see that the jasmine would have been better (lighter and fluffier) and that cloves would have been better than cinnamon. But all in all, it still tasted great!

Giving it rating so I can add a comment. With yogurt if you use full fat yogurt it usually wont look curdled or chunky. The low fat or fat free ones will. It doesn't change the flavor though.

This was wonderful, but I need to suggest one major change to the recipe -- use basmati rice, not jasmine/regular white rice.  This biryani is very delicately spiced, as it should be, and the yoghurt adds a nice touch.  My local market was out of curry leaves at my last trip, so I used just a bit of mild curry powder to add extra flavor.  Also, make sure to invest in ghee for this recipe.  I would actually give the recipe just under 5 stars due to the kind of rice suggested, but it was altogether a great biryani.

Nothing like any authentic biryani I have tasted, and most of my friends are Indian/Pakistani.  Know that if you make this dish, it is a very watered down version of biryani, to the point of not being biryani.  It's almost plain rice with chicken.

I made this for my family and I, and we loved it. Had to add some more salt and garlic for extra taste but in the end it was very tasty. I didnt feel like making raita so I just topped it with some plain yougurt... yummy!

Curry leaves and curry spice (powder) are not the same thing.  Curry leaves (Murraya koenigii) are also called Kari leaves and can be found at Indian/Asian grocery stores and have a lime smell to them.  The best substitutes are bay leaves OR basil OR kaffir lime leaves (may be available at a Southeast Asian markets).

This is by far the best biryani recipe I have ever tried. The only change I made was to add a pinch of safron as it looked a bit pale.

When I read the recipe I was so excited to try it. Now I am just disappointed and have a big bowl of leftovers that may end up going to waste. Not a recipe that I will try again - way too bland.

This was very good.  The flavors were subtle but distinctive even without the curry leaves.  I halved the recipe and used one large chicken breast, which shortened the cooking time.  It goes well with "Indian Dal with Spinach" also from this site.

I added a few extra spices: cardamom, turmeric, hing (asafetida) and left out the garlic. Also, I'm a vegetarian so I added chicken substitute, green peas, cauliflower and cashews. It's likely that my version is regionally confused but it's tasty.

I'm only giving this three stars because biriyani is ALWAYS made with basmati rice, and no other. Biriyani recipes vary from person to person, and I have to say these ingredients are authentic, with the exception of bay leaves - usually curry leaves are used instead. The one-pot method used here can also be replaced by cooking the meat and rice separately, and layering them later. Just make sure you have enough gravy for the chicken to season the rice as well.

This is not at all like the Hyderabadi Biryani I learned to make in Hyderabad. You would never use anything but basmati rice for this dish. The best cooks marinate the chicken in the yogurt and spices. This is a good recipe but as far as it being authentic, it is not.

This was a great easy recipe.  I made a few adjustments.  I decreased the ghee by about 1/2.  I decreased the cloves to about 10 and the cardamom to about 4 and bay leaves to 3.  I added a cinnamon stick, and 15 black peppercorns.  I used fresh ginger and fresh garlic too.  I did not use the green chiles bc the the kids wont eat them but the peppercorns gave it enough kick.  I also added more salt.  I added about a tablespoon of Shan Biryani spice mix too.  Next time i think i will add a potato or two when i am cooking the onions.  I used boneless chicken breasts too.  It was really good!!

Fabulous! My Indian husband was craving a good home made biryani and this recipe made him very happy. I used 5 serrano peppers the first time and the heat was just right. I also added cashews and golden raisins. Yum! I made it a second time for the kids and only used one serrano pepper, it wasn't enough spice. Great recipe, thanks!

Flavor is quite good--this isn't a very strong, flavorful biryani, but rather light and mild.  I used black cardamom (instead of green cardamom) pods, which I think has a bit more astringent flavor.  Serving size of this recipe is huge--for two people, just 1/4 of the recipe is plenty.  Also, my rice turned out incredibly mushy.  I think you might need to adjust the amount of water added (4 1/8 cups).  I could have used 3 cups, and it would have been just right.

Oh my god, this is so good! Although I can handle heat pretty well I am surely no native; so I was skeptical about the amount of chilies. It turned out to be perfect, absolutely perfect. Best curry I've ever made and in the top 5 I've ever eaten. I will make this again and again, thank you!

Pretty good recipe! I made a couple substitutions. It tastes like a mama-made-it-recipes. One tip I would say, if you use chicken breast chunks, like I did- I wouldn’t wait till all the liquids to reduce down to one cup ( the chicken came out a little over done( just adjust the water added for the rice. Trying to keep

I really wanted to like this recipe.  I cannot speak to the authenticity of the recipe.  The only biryanis I've had were in Indian restaurants, so I can only compare to those.  I thought a biryani would be a good way to introduce my kids to Indian food, as they love rice, and this recipe didn't seem too spicy.  However, the cloves were overwhelming in the flavour which turned the kids off right away.  I used bone-in chicken thighs so adjusted the cooking time accordingly.  Thankfully they decided they could eat those.  Unfortunately I won't try this one again.

All in all a good recipe for a little bit of exotism. The amount of spices may look like LOTS but if you are gentle with the chile pepper it should suit any stomach. I had no trouble with the yoghurt. I had no ghee but added fresh butter slivers just before serving. Also I somehow missed the onions but shall definitively add some next time and yes well roasted before adding the chicken.

This sounds so good, but I was really disappointed at the fact that it had so many good tasting ingredients but such a lack of flavor. I don't understand how this turned out to be so bland, and I don't think I'll make it again.

This was a very good Biryani recipe overall, however it was extremely mild for Indian food. I fed it to my Indian boyfriend (whose mother makes waaay better biryani than I could probably ever hope to make) and he enjoyed it. I would definitely add more peppers or something. Another problem that I had was the fact that it doesn't tell us which type of green pepper to use. I don't remember which kind they were but they were the smaller ones (not jalapenos obviously)serrano peppers. Definitely use the basmati rice.

Great flavor. I did not have the paste, and used crushed garlic instead. Instead of letting the juice cook down to one cup, I took the chicken out and put it in a roasting pan, and placed the remaining juice, pan scraps in my blender. With the curded yogurt it turned into a thick flavorful sauce, and was excellent.
