I made two kinds of ginger snaps - both from this site.  The first were "mom's ginger snaps" and the second recipe was this one.  Hands down, this one is the better of the two.  The only thing I will do next time is add about 1/4 tsp salt instead of 1/2 like it calls for.  That's just a personal preference, though.  I also added about 1/4 tsp of cloves for added kick.  All-in-all, this is a very good recipe!!!!

Today will be my 6th time making these.  They are wonderful!!  Men especially seem to like them.  When they are in the house, my husband can't keep his hand out of the container.  DELICIOUS!  These are easy recipe to make!  I Use evaporated cain juice in place of sugar- still delicious!  I took advice and almost doubled the spices.  Wish I would not have been so scared the first time and did the whole double amount!  I always have since then. I use "real" butter in place of shorting.  I used my 1/2 Tablespoon measureing spoon to make them round.  I dipped the measurer in flour before scooping up the dough.  Tapping them out on the side of the mixing bowl made them easy to remove.  They looked to me to be the perfect size of any "normal" gingersnap.  When using this way to measure them, a doubled recipe made 126! They are quite a change from your usual hard, crisp ginger sanp.  These are soft and chewy and wonderfully spicy.  I think you'll not be disappointed should you try these!

Excellent gingersnaps! These have a great flavor and are addictive. What's more, they are stunning little cookies appearance-wise -- perfectly round, perfectly crackled, very professional looking. They are definitely going in my Christmas cookie assortment.  Only one caveat: nine minutes was not long enough in my oven. I had to bake for 12-14 minutes to ensure that they were cooked all the way through. Otherwise, perfect!

This recipe is great for crunchy cookies.  If you want a chewier cookie (that's how we like them) only bake for 8minutes.  Add a 1/4 tsp. of cloves too!  Yum!

excellent cookies.  My 3 year old says they are her favorite cookies.  I make a double batch every time and put 3/4 of them already into balls in the freezer.  That way I can just throw them in the oven upon request and we can eat them warm.  I will say that I have used butter as well as crisco and the butter makes a better cookie.

Wonderful cookies, Sherry. For personal taste I added 1/2t more ginger and 1/4t cloves for a lttle extra kick. As they baked, they emitted an aroma to die for. Thanks for sharing.

I'll never buy store-made ginger snaps again!  These cookies are easy and they taste better!  Try rolling the tops of the cookies in red or green colored sugar before baking to make a great holiday presentation.  Makes a great homemade gift!

This receipe was so easy to make and very good.  I made some last night, and my family enjoyed them so much they are begging for more.  We are at a high elevation, and so my success with cookies hasn't been so good.  This batch was my second batch of cookies that I have made in 1 year, and they turned out wonderful.  I did add about another 1/4-1/2 cup of flour, and that worked wonders.  We live at 5800+ elev.

These cookies are perfect!  Just what I was looking for - a word of advice, though - do NOT overbake.  They might seem wayyyy too soft when they come out, but they'll firm up a lot.  If you take them out too late, they'll end up as hard and chewy as rocks.  Take them out exactly as prescribed for perfect, soft, chewy cookies!

Good cookie, next time I'll add additional ginger and clove.  The dough was really easy to work with. I also cooked longer for a crisper cookie.

I love recipes that are easy and use simple ingredients and still taste great, and this is one of them! I followed the recipe exactly, other than using butter and only half the salt. These are perfect for a cookie jar! I might increase the spices next time, as they're not super spicy, but they're very good as they are also.

Wow! These cookies were easy and delicious!! I too used butter and doubled the spices. Also substituted maple syrup since I didn't have molasses. Still turned out excellent--did have to cook around 13 minutes. Will make again soon!

These cookies were delicious, and so pretty!  I did make a few changes: I added another 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/4 tsp. cloves, and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  I also made them bigger (I got 26 cookies), so they needed to bake a few minutes longer, around 13 minutes.  Next time I will cut the salt down, somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 tsp.

Yummy cookie!  Doubled the ginger/cinnamon as suggested. Used dark molasses (that's what I had).  Great flavor but I like that "kick" of flavor (these did have that "snap") so next time I'll add the clove that others suggested. 1/2 tbs spoon made a perfect size cookie!

I bought some rose water and really wanted to make cookies with it...so I used this recipe as a base. I used all butter instead of shortening. I exchanged the molasses for light corn syrup and added 1 tbs of rose water to the butter cream mixture. I changed the ginger and cinnamon for 1 1/2 tsp of cardamom.  Viola! Cardamom Rose Snaps ;)

Really easy dough to make and rolling into small balls and dipped into plate of sugar. worried wjhen i took them our at nine minutes and they were soft. Let them cook in front of the air conditioner and then plucked them onto a cooling rack, Left them unwrapped and they crisped right up, Wanted that snap when I bit in  and I got it. Crispy.

I made these for my husband, who thinks his own grandmother's ginger snaps are unparalleled. The verdict? He LOVES these! I baked them for 9 minutes and they were the perfect consistency of slightly chewy, soft center with crispy exterior. I did sift once instead of twice (mostly b/c my 3 year old was 'helping') and I kept to the spice proportions as written. I'll definitely make these again.

These cookies are awesome! I've made them 3xs in 2 days. I'm enjoying the 3rd batch right at this moment at 12:15 am fresh out of the oven hahaha...I'm Insane and should be in bed. The first batch I made I baked 1/2 and froze the other 1/2 for later (I wrapped it in plastic wrap tubular-like) and my 2nd baking I just grabbed the frozen tubular portion, sliced 3-1/2in rounds and cut each round in 4 quarters which made 12 nice cookies. They were really easy to whip up and worth any inconvenience cause their so tastey and alot cheaper, fresher, and tastier, than store bought frozen cookies. I renamed them "Little cheaters" as I no longer eat sugar, these are an exception. Thanks for sharing.UPDATE4/21/08:OMG I added semi-sweet choc that I crushed to dough b4 freezing...AMAZING!

The recipe is fine and better than anaother one you have.  This fine recipe would be more to our taste with 2 tsp ginger, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.

I modified the recipe because I live at 5000'+.
For this I added 2 tbsps of flour, baked them at 375.  They maek over 2 dozen cookies.

These ginger snaps are soft and delicious!  I doubled the ginger and cinnamon, as others had suggested.  I also ended up adding a bit of extra flour- about 1/4 a cup- and I would recommend that anyone else baking at high altitude make the same adjustment.

These cookies are EASY and delicious!  I doubled the spices are encouraged in the previous recipes and added a touch of ground clove for extra spice.  Fabulous--thank you for the recipe!

Excellent recipe. Thanks for sharing. I did use half butter and half shortening. I also added some cloves per my own preference. Nice appearance and yummy!

This recipe is definitely a keeper for our family. We all loved them! The texture of a cookie is very important to me and these cookies were "right on the mark" for a home-baked ginger cookie. I would decribe the texture as crispie on the outside and a just a bit chewy on the inside. If you like spicy flavors then go ahead and double the spices. I did and they were great (but I already knew my family likes the spicy taste). If you prefer a more mild tasting cookie, then I would leave it as is. I didn't change anything esle. Overall, a great cookie! Thanks for sharing!

Loved them! I added a little extra cinnamon and ginger at (1/4 tsp each) to give them just a teeny extra spice. Figured my non-ginger snap eating family might be pushed to the limit if I went any stronger. I baked them for 9 minutes on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. The appearance, texture and flavor was wonderful! Enjoyed with a glass of ice cold milk!

Excellent ginger snaps. I used a little more of the spices that the recipe said also I added a 1/4tsp of ground cloves. Bake for 9 minutes and it came out perfectly soft and chewy. Will make again and again.

i think the flavor of these cookies is nice but we wanted a crunchier outer texture. baking them a few extra minutes really didn't make them crisp up....which is what we hoped for. thanks anyways sherry.

I hate this recipe! I saw all the reviews and figured it would taste good. It sucked! For some reason, they were greasy on the outside and dry on the inside. They tasted strange and not like ginger snaps at all. I'm not a fan of ginger now that I made this recipe.

I added more spices like other reviewers. I like my gingersnaps to have a kick so the extra ginger is essential (3 tsp). I had to use dark molasses cuz thats all I had and I wasn't about to go to the store for the light kind! They are beautiful!

These cookies were so delicious. I did not need to make any variations except for adding more ginger and cinnamon. I like to sprinkle them with flour and sugar after they are done. They tasted excellent.

Nice simple quick recipe. I added 1 tablespoon of essence of egg yolk, another teaspoon of ginger, a pinch of clove and nutmeg as well as raisins. I substitued the baking soda for 1 teaspoon of baking powder and made 32 cookies using a 1 tablespoon qty as suggested. I also baked them for 12 minutes in an industrial oven and then turned the gas off leaving them in for an additional 5 minutes. When they cooled they had the consistancy of a light granola cookie not much snap left to them but nice and soft and a perfect spicey taste with the additional teaspoon of ginger... kids loved them.

These are chewy cookies, not "snaps." I think you should rename them to give readers a more accurate discription of what the cookie actually is.

This dough was really sticky and hard to handle.  After baking for 9 minutes they looked nice on the top but the bottoms were gooey and the cookies chewy, like they needed to be cooked more.  I made the balls the size of quarters - at the end of the dough I made the last ball the size of a nickel and it made the PERFECT cookie - crispy and perfectly baked.  If I give this recipe another chance I'll make them all the size of nickels.

Wow!!! These are amazing. As suggested in previous reviews I doubled the spices and added 1/2 tsp cloves and nutmeg because we like our's with a snap. They are wonderful. I'm sure I will be making these again and again. They will be in my Christmas Cookie tins this year. Thank you Sherry!!!!!

Thank you very much for sharing your recipe!    My fiddling: I used butter instead of shortening and heaped my teaspoons with cinnamon and ginger.  I didn't have 'light' molasses, so I took a chance with regular Grandma's Molasses and they turned out just fine.    I'm interested in adding the cloves other reviewers have suggested, as I baked these to use as a crushed cookie crust for a pumpkin cream pie and think the extra 'bite' would be a pleasing contrast to the creamy filling.  However, as a stand-alone cookie I think I'd prefer them just the way they are. :)  They're soft and chewy in the center and crisp along the edges.  [I used a tbsp scoop and baked for 10 minutes]

I have been making a similar recipe for 10+ years except I add 1 teaspoon of cloves and sometimes for extra kick a 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract.  The trick to the cookies is cooking time.  For  a soft chewy cookie I bake at 300-325F until the tops just start to form thin cracks, which expand into larger cracks when cooled.  So tasty everytime.

Perfection!  I doubled the ginger and cinnamon and added 1/4 tsp cloves.  Used a 1 1/2 tsp scoop and they were perfect size!  Words cannot describe how good they smell and taste.  The whole house smells like Christmas!

These are really good! I took the advice and doubled the spices with no regrets.. next time I'll actually triple the ginger. I've had my hand in the cookie jar all day.. and also made a couple of icecream cookies sandwiches with coffee icecream.. haven't tried those yet but I bet they'll be wonderful!!!

they came out horrible!!! It was my first time making ginger snaps of any kind but the taste was aweful!!!not to blame the owner of this recepie but,Just giving you a WARNING  be careful if this is your first time making ginger snaps and or you dont have experience.I think part of that is what happened to me and it was gros! I would not really say they were ginger snaps.They were greasy on the outside and dry on the inside. I did not do that part wrong so they really are greasy and dry though , made wrong or rite.

I made these cookies and halfway through I realized I didn't have ginger..so I used 1tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ground cloves.  They are great!  I suppose they are not really a ginger cookie without the ginger but they are great nonetheless.  Also, I used real butter as some other people suggested and they turned out very well.

This was a great recipe! My husband doesn't normally even like ginger snaps, but he had to concede that these were really tasty. I substituted butter for the shortening, but it was still very delicious! Everyone loved them.

I don't know whether or not I did something wrong, but these cookies didn't turn out at all like I thought they would. I was expecting a crunchy cookie, but what I got was a soft, chewy cookie lacking in flavor. I double checked everything I put in and I don't know what I could've done wrong. Maybe it takes practice to get these cookies just right, so I'll give it a 3 to allow for margin of error. Does anyone have any suggestions?

My mother-in-law has been making this exact recipe (with exception of adding 1tsp. cloves) for 50 years! She uses a recipe from an old Navy wives cookbook. At Christmas we play a "round robin" gift exchange game with 20 people. Her gift she brings is 2 dz. of these cookies. It is the hit of the game cuz everyone tries to figure out which is her gift. It beats out the other gifts by far. No one can Not like these cookies!

These baking made the kitchen smell like Christmas!  (A pleasant thought in all this summer HEAT!)  Very good!  I used dark molasses (all I had on hand) and a heaping teaspoon of both ginger and cinnamon.  Would definately make these again!  Thank you!

These were great I dont particulary care for Ginger Snaps but my husband loves them. The only thing I found with this recipe is there is not enough spice in them. I will follow the advice of another person who indicated to add more cinnamon etc.

These are wonderful! I used 1/2 cup golden crisco plus 1/4 cup margarine, and blackstrap molasses becasuse thats what I had. I also added 1/4 tsp ground cloves. I think these are the best cookies I have ever eaten. The batch was gone before they even cooled.

These cookies are so good that my husband says they are the best cookies he has ever eaten....That is a hugh compliment since both his grandmothers and all his aunts are master bakers. Next time I may add a little more ginger just for a bit more bite.

Fantastic base recipe!  Next time I will add more ginger and I found they cooked better for me when partially pressed with a fork.  Definitely agree with 9 minutes. I went with 11 based on another review and the bottoms tasted burnt.  I will definitely make these again!!!  Tomorrow actually for Christmas inventory!  I made some with sugar and some without.  I also used brown sugar instead of white.

These came out great! I rolled them all in sugar, not  just the top and they didn't stick to pan, I did not grease my pans either. I did double the spices like some reviews said and they have really great flavor. I am definitely making these again :).

Followed the recipe exactly and didn’t work for me.  Strong soda taste and they didn’t spread out.  I never use shortening and that may have been the issue.  All the reviewers who used butter seemed to have good results

I was in the mood for a ginger SNAP...a crunchier cookie, hence the name. Hard to find a recipe on here like that. However, although more of a gingerbread type cookie, these are very good as far as taste. As others have suggested I added a teaspoon of clove, reduced the salt and cooked a few minutes longer in hopes of a "snap" but they still came out chewy. Still addictive in any case.

I made this for my husband's office party and it was a hit. They came out the perfect texture, crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside. My only complaints are that the spices seem too mild, I added candied ginger and this helped bump it up a little; also there's just a little too much salt in the recipe, I knocked it down by a quarter. The dough is sticky but I use food prep gloves for any hands on food work, so this made it less of a problem for me. Overall it's a decent recipe, still not the spicy chewy gingersnap I'm looking for but a good substitute in a pinch.

I'm bad at following directions, I'll admit! I did make changes: took the suggestion to add 1/4 tsp of cloves, and increased the ginger a little. I have arthritis in my hands so I skipped the 'roll into a ball' step and just dropped rounded teaspoonfulls on the cookie sheet. As it seemed like plenty of sugar in the dough, I also skipped the sugar coating.  They turned out great although, after being baked for 10 min. and cooled, were still not crunchy. Maybe they need to cool for a few hours?? Still, the flavor was great.

Super tasty, crisp at the top and chewy inside.
For the extra kick I added a pinch of black pepper.
Kick- taste!

I replaced 1/4 cup of the shortening with butter, I used 1&1/2 tsp cinnamon instead of 1 tsp, and I had no molasses so I used real maple syrup in its place. I rolled them by hand, making balls just under 1&1/2" across and ended up with 36 cookies, each about 3" across. These are delicious, chewy with an initial crunch. Can't stop eating them!

My first attempt at ginger snap cookies, and these really are no fail! I used butter instead of shortening (same amount), and doubled the spices, and they were delish! I kept the 9 minute time even tho they still looked very mushy when they first came out, but they set as they cool. There is a certain crispiness when you first bite them, bu then they are soft and chewy - i love the texture.

This recipe is great as is and needs no changes. That being said, as a matter of preference and after reading various reviews, I added 1-1/2 of the spices (omitted the cloves only because I have an allergy to cloves) and added a little less than 1/4 tsp. of cayenne. The blend of spices was excellent. Be sure to refrigerate several hours and your cookies will spread out but not like "crackers" as one reviewer mentioned.  Thank you for sharing! Best Ginger Snap ever!

Great ginger snapes Sherry. I followed the recipe almost exactly, I didn't have light molasses so I used what I had, couldn't have turned out better.

These are SERIOUS good cookies. My oven wants 10 minutes exactly rather than the suggested 9 but, mama mia!  These cookies ROCK! The "snap" is along the edges and the rest of the cookie is soft (the way I like 'em).

First time making these ginger snaps.  They just couldn't be any easier to make and now I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar.  This is an excellent recipe.  Before I went into the kitchen I read lots of reviews and made three simple changes to the original recipe.  I took the advice from reviews and reduced the salt and added the 1/4 tsp of cloves.  I did add one additional ingredient, crystalized ginger.  I had gone to our natural foods market and bought what would amount to 1/4 cup, after chopping it in the food processor, of ginger.  The crystalized ginger gives these cookies the kick that we look for in a ginger snap.

Delicious! I usually use half butter/half shortening, which still makes them turn out quite good. Just make sure not to melt the butter too much, or they'll become quite flat. Enjoy!

These cookies tasted great, but they turned out more cake-ish than snap-ish if you know what I mean.  Being a poor college students who takes most of her ingredients from the cafeteria I did have to make a few adjustments, such as brown sugar instead of white sugar and molasses.  I don't know if this accounted for the texture difference, but as I said, it tasted great.

Made these for the first time tonight, and they are fantastic!  Definately going in my recipe box.  The only thing I noticed was that I had to bake them for 14 minutes - they just weren't done after 9.  Other than that, loved them!

very good! I added another teaspoon of ginger, a tsp of cloves, and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. I think people getting greasy cookies must be greasing the pan. That used to happen to me when I first started to make cookies! Use parchment paper for no stick!

I was a little worried because I couldn't find "light" molasses. It smelled so strong, and I was sure the cookies would be gross. Boy was I wrong! They are so good!   Will be sure to use this recipe every Christmas! :)

If you love ginger snaps, look no further for a recipe.  I've made these for years for our annual cookie exchange, and I always make an extra few dozen for my family since they are so delicious.  I think they are better than most of the "exchange cookies."

A friend of mine made these cookies last night and I fell in love with them.  The only differences she made were to use 1 Tablespoon of ginger, and substitute real butter for the shortening.  I will be making these soon. The tablespoon of ginger really gives the cookies the true zing of a ginger snap! Love it!

Taste-wise these were terrific! They definitely need to be cooked for at least 14 mins. though, otherwise they are too soft and don't hold their shape.

Made it again with only half the amount of baking soda, and thought it was even better.

Great ginger snaps! I rolled the entire balls of dough in sugar, and they turned out just as good. I also greased the cookie sheet, just to be sure. Pretty simple to make, and taste great!

These are excellent cookies.  I added just a bit more molasses (maybe a Tbsp) and I chopped up crystallized ginger pretty small and added quite a bit of that (really to taste). I like really gingery cookies.  :o)

I tried this recipe after realizing that I can't make gingerbread cookies b/c cardamom and cloves are just too expensive. I made a few changes to the recipe, after reading the reviews and looking at other recipes for gingerbread cookies on the internet. I used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter (and I just now realized I used a total of 1 cup instead of 3/4 C!). I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 light brown sugar. I doubled the ginger and the cinnamon, since the smell of the molasses was still so overpowering. And added a few drops of vanilla extract to the batter I made about 70 cookies about of this recipe. I rolled each ball in granulated sugar and baked for 8 minutes. They were really great! The flattened out, and were ever-so-slightly crispy on the outside, yet soft and moist on the inside. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that they still aren't spicy enough for me; next time I will add even more spices, and then I'm sure they'll be perfect. At any rate, this recipe, as I made it, is a keeper and is going to be copied onto a card for my recipe box along with my other favorite family recipes--a place to where few new recipes I try end up. Enjoy!

Fabulous.  People thought they came from a bakery.  Like other reviewers, I doubled the spices, but kept true to the rest of the recipe.  The cookies turned out chewy and delicious.

The cookies are very good but they don't spread very much. Also I made about 1.5 inch balls and they need to bake about 30 min at 350 degrees. Does anyone have any recommendations for this? Perhaps a higher tempature.

excellent recipe...forgot to make something for a deptartment picnic and found this recipe with 1 hr to spare--it was the biggest hit there! substituted 1/4 of regular flour for hazelnut flour I was trying to use up, the rest I used whole wheat flour, turned out great. WARNING: make tiny balls of dough, I made what I thought were a good size and it turned into one giant cookie. Still delicious though :)

I substituted Splenda for the sugar. The cookies tasted fine. I had to cook them ~13 minutes but my cookies didn't flatten out so I ended up with ginger balls rather than flat cookies. Next time I would double or triple the ginger.

These cookies are wonderful!  9 minutes makes soft cookies, 11 minutes makes crispy cookies.  Also, there's no need to roll them in sugar...it's sweet enough as it is.

I also upped the amount of spices as someone else suggested.  I think I about doubled the spices.

omg these are fantastic!

i took everyone's advice and added more spices, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 3 of ginger, plus a pinch of nutmeg.  i also used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of shortening, and halved the salt.  i actually found that 9 minutes wasn't long enough, even when cooled the cookies weren't done enough to hold together, so i let the next batch go and forgot about them until 12 minutes had passed!  i thought they were sure to be burnt and ruined, but they were actually fantastic and absolutely perfecct.  they were chewy and moist and soft, yet firm and really quite professional looking.  they taste amazing.  great recipe!

When I came across this recipe, I was looking for a cookie that roughly matched the tasty ginger molasses cookies you get at the brand name coffee shops (Starbucks, Second Cup, Bridgehead etc.) This one, while not a precise match, came pretty darn close. I should mention that  when I made it, I used light brown sugar instead of white and it turned out quite well. This is probably why mine turned out  to have a stronger than expected molasses flavour. I  also slightly over did it with the shortening, so they turned out a little  too fatty. Despite a few mistakes on the baker's part, they turned out just fine and were very popular among my housemates.

Wow!  These are absolutely delicious.  I won't even bother to try another recipe.  The first batch disappeared in 24 hours.  Batch 2 lasted slightly longer.  I followed the recipe exactly (well, ok I did kind of heap the teaspoon of ginger).  I used butter flavored Crisco for the shortening and it was fine.  I would think using butter would make them spread a bit too much.  Also, I cooked on convection at 325 for the 9 minutes.  They were done perfectly.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

These cookies came out perfect and they're pretty to boot. Typically I'm a hard, crist gingersnap girl, but these cookies were really good. I added a pinch of nutmeg and allspice for some extra kick. The texture isnt too soft, they hold their own, but they're still soft to the bite. Definitely in my permanent collection.

These were delicious! I prefer my ginger snaps to be on the softer, chewier side, and these turned out absolutely perfect (not too crispy and not too chewy)!  Because I like them softer, I used butter instead of the shortening and doubled the cinnamon and ginger. Yum!

hmmmm so good! These looks so nice and professional! Just remember to pat them down a bit after placing them onto the cookie sheet cuz they rise more than flatten. Also, I added more spices but that's just my personal taste. Take them out after exactly 9 minutes even though they may seem very soft. They will harden after a while. Definitely a keeper!

Excellent cookies - just the sort I was looking to make. They are a little more raised than I was expecting, especially when cooking, but they do deflate a bit after cooling and are snappy and delicious. The spices definitely need augmented though - I double the cinnamon and ginger, and added a touch of nutmeg to the mix and they were still not as gingery as I would have liked.

I lost my mother's ginger snap recipe.  I then obviously came to allrecipes.com
I found this one and knew it was a bit different but the ingredients were good so I tried them.  They came out thin and crispy, just the way I wanted them.  My mother's were not so thin and crispy as I suspect her recipe used butter and not shortening.  My DH commented they were just a bit too sweet but I did decorate them with colored sugar.  PLEASE NOTE: I used 1 Tbs cinnamon and 2 tsp ginger. I did bake them 3-5 minutes longer but  since these cookies crack when baked, it's almost obvious when they are done or need more baking.  Best when cooled and thus more crispy!

I found this recipe last week, and I've already made 3 batches!  My husband who does not like Ginger Snaps, loves these.  I did add 1/2 tsp more of ginger 1/4 tsp cloves, and drk molasses.  I also use the green and red sugar crystals for the ones I took to a Christmas party, and people just couldn't get enough of them!

These cookies are so wonderful!  They absolutely taste like Christmas.  They have a rich ginger flavor, and look like store-bought cookies.  I didn't have to modify anything.  My husband ate about 10 of these every day.  Highly recommended!
