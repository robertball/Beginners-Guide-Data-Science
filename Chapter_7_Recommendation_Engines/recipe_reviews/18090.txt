I have lived in St.Kitts for most of my life and a true island cook-up includes some pork such as pig, tail or pig snout and has in not just chicken wings but chicken necks and instead of pigeon peas we use either lentils or kidney beans. But it truly is an island dish best enjoyed with a local drink.

I lived on St. Lucia for 3 1/2 years and this is SO Caribbean!!!  If we were there we wouldn't buy "browning" we would make it by crystalizing raw sugar...  Recipe is very native to the Islands.

I made this and my Bahamian husband said it was really good. I didn't have any browning sauce so I added a tablespoon of brown sugar. I also didn't have any white rice so I used a large bag of yellow rice mix.  No problem, it was delicious.  My husband was impressed I used the pigeon peas:). Our kids loved it too.  This is a great, one-pot, quick and easy dinner option.

We use coconut milk in Guyana and more pepper. Otherwise it's delicious.

My husband loves when I make this dish.  This is my second time and it was good.  I used Pigstail instead of cod and used red kidney beans.  I did not use the carrots but maybe next time.  Also, used chicken drumsticks instead of wings.

I made the brown sauce, which was well worth the 7 minutes.  The only change was to the pigeon peas as I didn't have any.  General opinion was that it was good.  Needed salt at the end of cook time & we all agreed more brown sauce.

This was incredibly bland as listed. Definitely needs tweaking, but has potential.
