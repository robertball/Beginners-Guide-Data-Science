Rediculously simple to make and a super-good breakfast. I noticed another reviewer said these came out sweet, be sure to use evaporated milk and not SWEETENED condensed milk, as that would make the eggs sweet.

We made these eggs for breakfast this morning and no one ate them. The evaporated milk gave the eggs a sweet flavor that was very unpleasant.  I will NOT make these again, to be sure.

As a child I hated to eat, but a friend of my mother had me over-night and she threw 2 eggs in a pan with butter mixed them with a fork and added a good splash of whole  milk, salt and pepper.  they were so fluffy and I wanted more.  On holidays everyone wants me to make the scrambled eggs. one little girl told her mommy she wanted more, more!!! I rest my case!

Didn't see how this could be that much different from using heavy cream but I tried it and was surprised. The texture was very nice. Will make again. My children love scrambled eggs and they thought this was very good.

My family and I love scrambled eggs. However, I don't use evaporated milk. I use 1 TBLS of 1% milk along with the salt and pepper. I don't use butter, I use canola oil. My eggs turn out very fluffy and flavorful. I guess it's a preference.

Excellent! I made these for a bridal shower brunch and they were fluffy and delicious. As others have posted, DO NOT use condensed milk (as apparently one of the reviewers did unknowingly)! Evaporated milk has no sugar added, so it won't give a sweet taste, it just adds a rich flavor. I'll definitely be making this again.

These are fantastic. I didn't realize such a simple change from regular milk to evaporated milk could make such a difference.

Very good scrambled eggs. These turned out moist and looked great. I cut this down to 2 servings and used regular 2% milk instead of canned.

The eggs turned out light, fluffy and tasty - just the way I like them. I usually make my scrambled eggs this way only with skim milk. Since I was only cooking for two people and had no evaporated milk, I used skim milk. This was easy to whip up and pour into the skillet with 1T of butter. I let it sit for a minute before lifting up the edges of the eggs to let the runny part flow underneath. I lightly seasoned with hawaiian sea salt and black pepper. I slowly folded the eggs over until it was softly scambled the way I like it. The texture was indeed fluffy, softly scrambled and flavorful. I served this with, "Orange Toast," also from this website.

Before this recipe, making scrambled eggs always scared me, so I would just fry them and hope that the yolks wouldn't break so that I had to scramble them.  So, I had to try these, and so should everyone else -- and use the evaporated milk. These are amazing!  The first time I made them, my Hubby (and toughest food critic) said, "These are fluffy scrambled eggs".  And I said, "Yes they are!"  :)  Lovely, tender, tasty, and no weeping of either the milk or the cook!  I now make this recipe at least once a week or whenever an easy meal is needed!  I use one ounce of evaporated milk for every two eggs. To expand the eggs, I now separate the eggs, whip the egg whites until they have stifff peaks,  separately I mix the yolks and evaporated milk, and then slowly fold the yolk mixture into the whites before adding them to the skillet.  You can also add mushrooms, celery, and/or onions as your heart desires.  The meal can be as simple or as complicated as you want.  Thank you very much, Marjorie!

These are good eggs and, as the title says, they are fluffy. I scaled this recipe back to 1 serving, which used 2 1/2 tbsp of evaporated milk, and just used the amount of butter that seemed right to cook them in (probably about 2 tbsp). This recipe is wide open to any additions you might want to make and is good for using up little bits of herbs or vegetables that you have. I think next time I may try some brie and dill as additions. Thanks!

Great recipe! I inadvertently had to double the recipe, as I grabbed a 12 oz can of evaporated milk (instead of the 5 oz listed). With the 12 oz can, I ended up using 17 eggs. Since there are only two of us in our house, we will be eating a ton of scrambled eggs for awhile! (Good thing they taste great!).

While edible, these were not my favorite scrambled eggs. They were kinda sweet and smelled too much like baby formula from the addition of the evaporated (I did not add sweetened condensed, before anyone feels the need to ask) milk. I had the same issue when I used condensed milk in my mac n cheese one time also. Usually I just leave one egg yolk out for every 3 eggs I use, add a splash of milk or even just water and they come out pretty fluffy.

I added about a half cup of shredded sharp white cheddar and used lowfat evaporated milk. My kids and husband loved these eggs. I might try these myself, cutting out some of the yolks and adding in garlic/onion and chopped veggies.

Great recipe. Never thought of using evaporated milk, and it sure added nice richness.  I used fat free evaporated milk and it was wonderful.  Also added in a bit of shredded cheddar right at end of cooking.  Yummy and also very pretty.  Made the eggs a great yellow color with awesome consistency.

These were hands down the best scrambled eggs I have ever made. They were rich and moist. I used this as the base for breakfast burritos. I was feeding a large group, so I used two dozen eggs & added a 12 oz can of evaporated milk. I drained two cans of Rotel tomatoes and added these after I had the eggs & milk mixed. When the eggs were set, I added 2 cups of cheese. Oh my, these were delicious.

These eggs were wonderful! I've always used milk to make my eggs a bit more fluffy but never thought to use an evaporated milk, which removes half of the water content in the milk. For added fluff, I always use my stick blender to blend the eggs and milk, which results in an incredibly frothy and fluffy final product. Please make sure you're using EVAPORATED milk and NOT sweetened condensed milk, as many people mistake to be the same thing.

Kimbersom clearly used condensed milk instead of evaporated milk, discount that review.  I made it this morning and it turned out ver light, fluffy and flavorful.  I added some dill and some fresh bacon crumbles.

I've made eggs with milk, heavy cream, half and half at this blows them all away.

Wow, this has changed our breakfasts forever.  I not only love the flavor, but also loved the instructions...they made me realize I had been overcooking my eggs in the past.  I didn't have evap. milk so I used half & half based on some other reviews and they turned out very good.  I have since tried them with evap milk as well, but I actually like the half & half quite a bit better and it's something I always have on hand, so it makes things simpler.

These were good!  I made them alongside "J.P's Big Daddy Biscuits" for breakfast Sunday morning.  It was like my husband and I had gone out to eat - only we were still in our pajamas!  My only advice with these eggs is don't skimp on the salt & pepper!  The evaporated milk makes them nice and fluffy, but also adds some sweetness.  I will definitely make these again.

I've always added milk to my eggs, but not this much and usually skim milk.  Adding this much milk made a big difference on the fluffiness.  I did use evaporated milk.  My boyfriend and I like lots of spice so I added garlic powder, pepper, cumin and a splash of tobasco and worcestershire.  My only complaint was that eight eggs DO NOT cook in four minutes on medium low heat (unless you like them raw), more like 20 minutes.  I started them sooner in the meal the next time.

Egg-cellent! I just made this recipe for the first time and we loved it. I halved the recipe and added shredded cheese while I was cooking it, for cheesy eggs. They were very fluffy, flavorful, and delicious!

I did not care for this recipe. My suggestions:
1) Don't use evaporated milk, use whole milk
2) Use a neutral-flavored oil (such as canola) instead of butter

I had to make scrambled eggs for a large group. I used 4 dozen eggs, 1 pint half and half, and 12 oz. of evaporated milk with 1 t. or so of salt. I scrambled in butter in batches. (I mixed everything in a large pitcher for ease of pouring.) Everything was dumped into a steam tray and served buffet style over a period of a couple of hours. I was apprehensive, hoping they would hold up.Rave reviews! Everyone commented on how fluffy the eggs were and how delicious. I was surprised! I figured eggs are eggs, how good can scrambled eggs be? No, they all assured me, these were the best scrambled eggs they ever had. I used half and half because I was afraid too much canned milk would add an off taste. I think it would have been good either way. I didn't want to complicate things, but for home use, I might add sauteed onions, garlic, or veggies, and maybe cheese.

This is my favorite way of making scrambled eggs, which I have been doing since 1974. I don't use quite as much evaporated milk per egg.  I don't measure exactly but it's about one and a half to two teaspoonfuls per egg.  Sometimes I use bacon grease rather than butter.  One thing that may account for some people finding the eggs too sweet with the amount of evaporated milk called for in this recipe is the fact that store-bought eggs tend to have a milder flavor than what you get from raising your own chickens.  If someone finds them too sweet, just try adding a little less evap milk.

The folks who did not like it used condensed milk not evaporated. At least 9 times out of ten. I had a neighbor tell me she knew better but I went over to her house as soon as she hung up and there is the trash was a can of empty evap milk make sure it is condensed or use heavy cream with tablespoon sugar

Easy to make.  Eggs turn out light and fluffy.  Kids devoured them.  Add any of your omelet favorites like green and red bell pepper for color and flavor.

Eaten plain just with salt and pepper,  the scrambled eggs, while fluffy, bordered on the sweetish side.  Obviously more flavor in the form of spices or cheese would detract from that, making the eggs more savory. While I do appreciate trying something new,  I will just stick with milk or cream and save the hassle of disguise.  Unless one doesn't mind sweet scrambled eggs...

There are lots and lots of scrambled egg recipes out there, but I gave this one a try because I had the exact number of eggs to use up. The eggs did cook up pretty "fluffy", but I think using so much milk added a slightly funny taste to the dish. I had half one morning, and I though the reheated half the next morning tasted a bit better. Pretty good stuff overall, though. Thanks!

This is the first time my scrambled eggs have ever turned out right. The evaporated milk was great. I used a generous amount of salt, and I added chives, minced onion, and lots of garlic powder. I will be trying various combinations now that the actual egg part turns out fluffy and delicious! Tip: use a wooden spoon, and when you scrape eggs you should see the bottom of the pan... your scrapes should form clouds of eggs. Keep scraping, turning until it's solid-looking but still moist. Do not use too high heat... lower is better. Trust me. Turn it up if it's taking too long, but I find it's better longer on lower.

Followed the recipe exactly.The eggs came out very fluffy; indeed quite bouncy. However, I agree with other reviews that the addition of the evap. milk detracted from the egg taste. Since it didn't improve the taste, I'll save my money and not include the evap. milk next time I prepare scrambled eggs. Thanks anyway.

My husband really liked them. Me, not so much. The addition of that much evaporated milk took away the egg flavor to me. Oh, it was good BUT it tasted more like the makings of a dessert. Had I added sugar and vanilla, I would have had custard.   I guess I like my eggs "straight up" and tasting like eggs. I will try this again as I did like the texture but next time with much less evaporated milk.

These were great! The perfect amount of milk, and very fluffy. I was out of milk and was searching to see if anyone had tried evap. milk with eggs, so I was glad to find this.  And I feel sorry for those who confused sweetened condensed milk with evaporated milk. Yuck!!

These were nice and fluffy but it was possible to detect the taste of evaporated milk, which was a little odd, although not overpowering.

Talk about fluffy....these scrambled eggs bounced when I put them in the dish.  Eggs have never been my strongpoint, but these were simple and delicious!

This was so so good. I made it for my family and they loved it. I used heavy cream instead of evaporated milk, but they still turned out wonderfully fluffy. I was definitely use it again!
