I am 58 years old, my Grandmother made this every Thanksgiving and Christmas. She also used Walnuts and Raisins. 
Now I'm looking forward to making this in the next few days and then the Holidays!

I could hug you! I lost the card with my grandmother's potato cake recipe and was heartbroken, especially because my best friend asked me to make it for her birthday. This is exactly the recipe I remember - the only difference is that she used walnuts and raisins too.  Bless you for posting it. 

For anyone wondering what it tastes like - it's dense and moist without being heavy or greasy. You wouldn't think of it as a chocolate cake unless you saw the recipe. In my family the recipe goes back to at least 1890. It may be older than that. 

Grammy always made this at Christmas time and frosted it with seven minute boiled frosting and silver dragees so it looked like drifted snow. Made a day or two ahead and covered well it won't dry out or lose flavor.
