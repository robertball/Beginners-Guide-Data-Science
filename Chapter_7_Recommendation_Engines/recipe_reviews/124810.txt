I've wanted to make these for some time, and finally had the time and all the ingredients, so I went for it.  These are delish!  I only made half a batch because I knew that I was going to be the only one eating these.  I followed the recipe, but used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce.  All of the flavors and textures bake together beautifully.

This is my new favorite muffin - and I make alot of muffins!  The only changes I made were - instead of nuts, I used chopped pumpkin seeds - surprisingly great! - whole wheat flour, of course, and dried cranberries because that's all I had - might be even better with fresh or frozen ones though.  And for any of you health nuts out there - agave syrup works marvelously in place of sugar in any muffin recipe - use less than sugar (3/4 Cup syrup for 1 Cup sugar) - doesn't cause a spike in blood sugar and it's unprocessed.   I will certainly be making these again and again!

These muffins are a nice, not too sweet treat.  I gave a lower rating, because if you do not eat them the first day, they do not hold up well in taste.

For once I actually followed the recipe, almost, and this one was good.  I had a total of 3 cups apples and carrots, but it was a bit more than 1 cup of carrots.  These were very good.  The outside was a bit crispy, the inside nice and moist.  I will try them with some whole wheat flour next time, and perhaps some applesauce to replace some of the oil, but they were quite good just as presented, and still pretty healthy.

I followed the recipe as described. My only suggestion is, don't put the cranberries in the  food processor, as you can hardly taste them. Find the patience to halve or quarter them, as it will make a huge difference in the end!

These are the best all-around muffin. I disagree with the reviewer who said they do not hold up well the day after you bake them. My family eats them throughout the week and they always retain their moisture and flavor. Thanks Beverly!

Great muffins. The cranberries added a bit of tang to them. I used Splenda and whole wheat flour. Also more like 50/50 for carrots and apple to make up the 3 cups  since I only had 2 small apples.

Im so happy u posted this recipe. I altered it a bit by using spelt flour instead of regular flour and 1/3c brown sugar, and almost a cup of Agave instead of white sugar and added chocolate chips. YUMMM!!! They came out sooo moist! Next time Im going to add flax. And oh yeah, I left out the vegetable oil and replaced with 1/2 stick of butter. They were perfect. Thank you!!!

These weren't bad, just completely boring. Even adding cinnamon and nutmeg did hardly anything for these. My kids wouldn't eat more than one.

I made these as mini-muffins and they were a hit  with both men and women at a brunch.   Start with 15min baking time--add a minute or two at a time until done  Moist and freeze well !

These are yummy! I've been looking for a good carrot muffin recipe. These are not as heavy as others I've tried and they're just the right sweetness. I followed the recipe except 1)Part of the apples was crushed pineapple left over from a different recipe 2)I used 1/2 whole wheat flour 3)I used raisins and craisins in place of fresh cranberries.  My 15 yr old son loved them! So much healthier than pop tarts or store bought cookies!!

These muffins are great!  I had cranberries to use up so this recipe was perfect.  These are moist and full of flavor.  I added 2 Tbsp. of ground flaxseed, a 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg, and a tsp. of vanilla just because I love these flavors.  I also used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar and omitted the nuts due to allergies. I got 22 muffins.  The baking time was perfect at 20 min. for my oven. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

These may be the best muffins I have ever eaten!I reduced the sugar to one cup, and I used 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I also substituted whole wheat flour for some of the all-purpose flour.  Soooo delicious!

The coarsely chopped fresh cranberries in this recipe add little bits of bright red color for a very pretty muffin.  I used half applesauce & half canola oil with excellent results.  Next time, I might use slightly less cinnamon, but these really are great!

This recipe is fantastic!  The muffins turned out really moist and I felt like I was doing myself a favor by eating them because of all the healthy ingredients.  I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour.  Also used part brown sugar and part white sugar/Splenda mix. We didn't have any cranberries so I substituted raisins. I also used a little zucchini along with the apple.  Then I ran out of oil and had to substitute apple sauce for some of the moisture.  I was sure with all of the changes they would come out funny but they were delicious!  I love recipes that I can play around with and this is definitely one that I will make over and over again!

I was out of carrots, so I grated another apple.  I used granny smiths.  I also subbed a cup and a half of whole wheat flour for the same amount of all purpose flour. These were amazing!  I also didn't chop the cranberries because they were frozen.  They added a lot of tartness surrounded by the sweetness of the muffin.  I thought these were great and they were packed with fiber too! I don't know if I'll ever add the carrot because they were so good without!

These were very good! Made just a couple changes - replaced 1 cup plain flour with whole wheat, added a tsp. vital wheat gluten  and I omitted the nuts.  Also subbed applesauce for half the oil.  Very tasty, and I love the burst of tart cranberries.  Will definitely make these again!

Good recipe that is forgiving when changes must be made. I did not have any carrots and not quite 2 cups of shredded apple, I had 2 small apples that needed using up and also so fresh cranberries (not quite 1 C) I also had 2 over ripe bananas so I mashed them up to put in it, and then also added 2 oz of cream cheese, cut into tiny bits that I folded into the batter. This resulted in a yummy muffin! I also used splenda instead of sugar, using just a little less than called for. This recipe would be good for using several things up when you have odds and ends left over.

I made these today but didn't have any walnuts or pecans so left them out. I also had 2 cups of carrots and only 1 of apple. These were so good! The outside was crispy which we liked a lot! The inside is so moist. Overall, the muffins are very tasty.

We LOVE these! A hearty snack that stays with you. 
I've made these MANY MANY times. I freeze the muffins so they are ready to go for kids lunches or sports...etc..

A few changes...*(less sugar)  1 cup sugar, *whole wheat flour, *raisins, 
*substitute APPLESAUCE for oil.

These are very tasty!  My modifications were using dried blueberries instead of cranberries, reduced sugar to 1 cup, added some vanilla and made 12 regular muffins and 12 mini muffins.  I put the mini muffin pan in the over at around 12 minutes to go with the larger muffins cooking for 22, and that seemed to bake them up well.  The larger ones seemed a bit brown, so 20 is probably good.
