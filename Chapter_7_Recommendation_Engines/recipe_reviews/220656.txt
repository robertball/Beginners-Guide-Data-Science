These are wonderful.  I used portobello mushrooms instead of corn.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they are sloppy to work with.  Perhaps one egg instead of two. I froze them first as the other person suggested and it worked fine.   My husband liked them as well.  Even better they are only 2 points apiece at Weight Watchers when I calculated them.

I adjusted the receipe as follows to reduce the amount of liquid :
1/4 C chopped onion
1 Carrot grated
1/4 yellow squash grated
1 potato grated
2 chopped mushrooms
2 large bannana peppers chopped.
1/2 C oatmeal as a binding agent.
No oil
No salt (there is plenty of sodium in the beans and condiments)

I fried 3 burgers and baked 3 at 425 while baking my sweet potato fries.  I froze the burgers not eaten for use later.

I had no problem with these burgers falling apart.  The problem with the original receipe is too much moisture (potatoes have a lot of water), the amount of the additional ingredients prevents the beans from holding the burger together,  and no binding agent other than the eggs.  Substitute bread crumbs if you don't want to use oatmeal. 

This made 6 burgers instead of 8

This is a great recipes for a vegetarian. Mine keep coming out too soft and almost falling apart. So I make them ahead of time and freeze them. For me they seem to re-heat very well and get nice and crisp. Tastes great! I added grated Ginger to mine :)

If your patty is falling apart, it's because you haven't mashed the beans enough! We made these twice, and the first time we only lightly mashed the beans and they were falling apart like crazy, even though they still tasted delicious. The second time we used our potato masher and 1 1/2 cans of black beans and they turned out perfect and held their shape wonderfully. It made about 11 medium burgers. Love this recipe!

I usually read the reviews first but I forgot this time. I wish I had used my little food processor on the beans because there was no way I could make a patty with my mixture. However, I just spooned some out (less yucky anyway) and after they cooked up awhile they stuck together well enough. My 5, 6, & 7 year old girls had seconds and thirds! Even my picky teenage son liked it. Next time I will mash up the beans better but these were surprisingly accepted by my picky eaters! Win!

I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA FOR A BURGER BUT I COULDN'T GET THEM TO HOLD TOGETHER SO I COULD COOK THEM. THE TASTE WAS WONDERFUL. I WONDER IF PUTTING A LITTLE FLOUR IN THEM WOULD HELP HOLD THEM TOGETHER? OF COURSE THAT WOULD ADD TO THE CALORIES. I WILL TRY FREEZING THEM BUT I CAN'T SEE HOW THAT WILL HELP WHEN YOU COOK THEM. I COULDN'T EVEN MAKE A PATTY OUT OF THE MIXTURE THAT WOULD HOLD TOGETHER.

ill give it 4 stars, its a GREAT base recipe. I  omittrd the carrots and added bread crumbs and Srirachi  myself,  also used a whole can of corn instead of 1 cup. The mixture was wet as hell but cooking it on medium heat i had no problems and it browned rather nicely. I thought the potato was a wierd addition based on other recipes ive seen but it works very well.
