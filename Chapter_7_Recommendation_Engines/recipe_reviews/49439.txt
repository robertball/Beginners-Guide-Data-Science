This recipe makes some of the most amazing asparagus I've had.  However, the recommended cooking time yeilds a crunchier asparagus, so if you are a fan of soft aspargus just zap it a little longer.

Good, but tasted too much like wine and too little like asparagus.  Next time I'll use 1/2 wine and 1/2 water.

This was a quick, easy and tasty side dish. I used Pinot Grigio as suggested and it came out just fine in a matter of minutes. This is the perfect side when the rest of your meal is laborious.

The flavor of the asparagus was PERFECT. We did these in the Ziploc Zip 'n Steam bags for 3 minutes as the bag directed and just put the wine and butter in the bag with the fresh asparagus. Perfect texture and absolutely delicious.

I'm a big wine drinker & I really expected to like this but I hated it...hubby said "it's not THAT bad". I did use a pinot grigio (one of my favorite wines) but the taste was overwhelming. Perhaps I'd like it better cooked over the stovetop, giving the wine more time to burn off. I did add some chopped garlic.  I'm sorry to give this such a low score, Deb but I feel that I must to be fair.

I used a white zinfandel and found this to be wonderful - the way I'll always cook asparagus from now on.  Just enough flavor to make it interesting, yet not overpowering so it's still great with spicy main dishes.

I was pretty excited to try this, but found it to be kindof blah.  I think plain steamed asparagus with salt and pepper is much better.  It was very easy, though 3 minutes leaves the asparagus practically raw.

I took advice from others and added garlic, salt, and pepper... as well as the Pinot Grigio and butter. I also garnished with dill. The resulting dish was very tasty. Since there is considerable variation in member's comments, I might add that perhaps the quality of ingredients could be an issue. For example, if you start with a cheap wine, don't expect stellar results. If you add garlic salt, rather than garlic and salt, don't expect a miracle. The same applies to the freshness of all ingredients, from asparagus (which can be like wood) to pepper. If you are not using a pepper mill, then you are not using pepper. Think sawdust. Fortunately, salt is a rock. Even then, sea salt tastes very different from rock salt. Just some food for thought. :-)

I made this on top of the stove instead of in the microwave and used butter, salt and pepper. It was decent but I don't think I would make it again. I think you would get a better result just squirting some fresh lemon over the asparagus. I did use Pinot Grigio.

Great method. If the wine is too over-powering, use chicken broth.

LOVE this recipe! I had no idea I could steam my asparagus in the microwave - I will never make it any other way. I should mention that I use water in place of the wine and sprinkle with a bit of sea salt before cooking - the end result is delicious!

I agree that the wine flavor was pretty strong and it could have used some garlic or dill. I would try this again since the method is so easy when you have other complicated dishes to prepare but use half wine/half chicken broth as suggested by another reviewer and add an herb.

The only suggestion I took from t his recipe was to add wine to my steamer. It turned out delicious and was not overpowering at all. I melted some butter in a pan with salt pepper and a bit of lemon to drizzle over the steamed asparagus before serving, that makes all the difference.

Great recipe for steamed asparagus and helped me get rid of some left over white wine. I substituted butter for smart balance and only used a tablespoon or less. Great!

This was really good. I did a quick test run with just a little asparagus and diluted the wine with water. No need. Just don't skimp on the butter and it will be fine.

All recipes need altering to some degree; cooking time could be stated as 3 min plus time for your tenderness degree.  The wine did over power; I give credit to another person suggesting 50% wine to 50 % water.  Less liquid with sprigs laying flat in the bowl may result in less wine taste.  I had mine lumped due to the vessel I used.  I may try it again to stay on top of why it was suggested.  Lets never give up!

I loved this dish although I did it a second time and  added 1/4 cup chicken broth (canned) with Chardonnay and the butter.  It was a little less wine tasting.  Very good. It will be my regular from now on. Thanks.

I 'scaled' the recipe down for one serving (used 1/4 lb asparagus, 1 tbsp wine, 1/2 tbsp butter) and I thought it was good but missing just a little something--like a sprinkle of garlic salt for instance.  With a dash of added seasoning, it is a five-star!

This was ok, but it was bland and almost raw. It could stand to cook a few minutes more. It also might help if the dish was tightly wrapped, not loosely.

We LOVE asparagus and cooking with white wine.... With that said, we did not like the recipe. We like our asparagus cooked more then recommended. So we took out of the microwave, put in foil, added more butter, and added garlic.. Many people may love this, it just wasn't for our family.

This was my first attempt with asparagus.  Everyone loved it. I used a reisling as I had it already.  Will definitely use this again.

We don't drink so I added vegetable broth and garlic
It had to cook longer than the time but it is easy!

I dont like that its microwave, but for a quick snack I guess. I put this on the stove & also did 1/2 cup white wine & 1tbs butter reason being, this is exactly how I make my delicious mushrooms. I'm thinking I'm going to do mushrooms & asparagus next time I make this.

This recipe was very bitter. Maybe it was my asparagus. Maybe it was the wine. I'll try something else next time.

This was a simple recipe to prepare. Unfortunately neither I or my wife liked this. I guess that wine on vegetables is not my favorite way to fix them.

This is fabulous! Simple, incredibly easy to make, and nutritious as well. I tend to overcook my veggies, despite my best intentions, but my asparagus came out perfectly crisp and crunchy with this recipe.

Used Riesling (a sweet white wine) and it was okay.  It changed the way asparagus tastes, which is nice for variety, but I think it kind of drowned out the crisp fresh taste of a great veggie.

Could have been operator error, but not our favorite way to eat asparagus.  Can't really describe the failure with this one...I even tried it twice - the taste and texture just wasn't there.  Sorry.

This was very nice.  I followed the advise of another reviewer, and cut the wine in half.  I'm glad I did, because it was still just a little over powering.

I had thick asparagus stalks and had to cook about twice as long. Overall was a nice, quick way to cook the asparagus. It left the kitchen smelling a bit given the wine and the asparagus.

This was a great change for asparagus. I did use frozen then slit the bag open to add the butter and wine. Will try again with fresh.

The trick to this recipe is to use a dry white wine.  Made this exactly by the recipe (although I did add seasonings) for dinner guests tonight and everyone raved about it!  This is a keeper and sooooo easy!!!!!

This gets a high rating from me for how simple it is! My variation was that I used Moscato instead of Pinot Grigio,  although I knew that the outcome would disguise the buttery flavor that the creator was probably going for... I loved it and will probably pick up asparagus more often at the market now!

After the first time, I have opted to cook it longer and it seems best between 4.5 and 5 minutes with less wine. I also made it with chick peas in the same dish, and lemon squeezed over it when done. I think I will do that same one again with tomato slices for more variation... I love asparagus!

I love how simple this recipe and when I don’t have white wine I squeeze half of a lemon over the asparagus. Very yummy.

Perfect!  Flavor was excellent.  I melted the butter then added the asparagus, wine (Sauvignon blanc), and butter to a microwave steam bag.  I shook the bag to ensure the asparagus was evenly coated.  This was so easy to make I will do so again.

This recipe is so easy and carefree when you have all your stovetop burners in use. I've found that the 3-minute cooking time is just right for a 900 watt microwave and skinny asparagus. Like other reviewers suggested, I added a generous grating of fresh pepper and some minced garlic along with the wine and butter. Another thing I've tried is a sprinkling of low-sodium chicken bouillon powder for added flavour. Lately I've been experimenting with using a silicone pot cover since I don't like plastic wrap near my food -- especially in the microwave. So far, it's worked well. This recipe is a real keeper.
