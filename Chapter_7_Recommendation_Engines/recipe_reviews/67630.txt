This turned out great!  My husband raved about it, he even ate the strained carrots and onions as a side.  I burnt the chestnuts so I left them out and could not find Madeira wine in time, so I substituted 3T sherry + 1T brandy.

I stuck fairly close to the recipe except I braised the venison in a frying pan and used a touch of garlic. It turned out quite well.

I followed this recipe exactly except I substituted the venison with beef as I do not like venison.  It was amazing, I just cooked it a couple nights ago and my family is already bugging me to make it again! Thank you for posting this and showing me something we ALL like!!

The taste was very good but I think it could use some extra savory flavoring (such as basil). I used walnuts instead of chestnuts and heated/roasted them for only 3-5 mins.

Made this for my family Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit.  We kept the onions and carrots in the sauce and used roasted chestnuts.  Also, used Malbec wine as that was on hand.  (Didn't show Bambi though) LOL

This sauce was delicious! I made an elk roast and served this with it. The sauce was very nice and really enhanced the taste of the meat. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I used bottled chestnuts. My kids both enjoyed it as well Thanks for a great recipe!
