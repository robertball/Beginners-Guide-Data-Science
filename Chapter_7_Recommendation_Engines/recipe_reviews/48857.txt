Very tasty and traditional african condiment.  I used a large handful of rehydrated del arbol peppers as these are easy to find in the grocery store.  I sauteed the garlic first in a bit of olive oil and add chopped fresh mint after removing from the heat.  Then blended all the ingredients in my chopper.  Slather on steaks before grilling/broiling and mix into mayo to make a killer steak sandwich.

Wonderful recipe, very forgiving! I modified ingredients based on what was available, and came out excellent, probably not quite as spicy as the original, as the bird chilies weren't to be found. Makes a great sauce for pork or chicken when mixed with plain yogurt, can be used as a stir-fry sauce, and was yummy just plain on top of smoked oysters. One thing that seemed nice was to toast the cumin and coriander seeds in a dry skillet before blending. Next time I will add the chilies after blending the rest so that the sauce is slightly chunky instead of pureed.

Tried this a few months back, before I became a member. So good it needs a review. Harissa with mint? Never knowing this version of Harissa (one of my favourite accompaniments), I went to the local, bought the bits I needed, and went to work. Wow. The mint introduces the cumin and garlic so well, it is as though the Harissa has a Master of Ceremonies. If you have never tried making it this way, I impress upon you: your dinner guests will love you.

This is a great recipe!  As always, I mix things up a bit, I will often add lemon juice right before serving with bread, and (I live in houston, this goes GREAT with tex-mex) I usually put in some chipotle pepper as well!

WOW!  I made this to put over wild salmon, roasted potatoes and wilted spinach but my teenagers ate it all with pita chips before dinner was ready.  I will double the recipe next time.  I used jalapenos.  As a professional chef I knew that the Bird's Eye peppers (AKA: Thai Peppers) would be too hot for my family.  If you have a Caputo's Store near you they often carry Thai Peppers.  I did add 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. To those who found it too salty, it depends on what kind of salt you are using.  Table salt, kosher salt & sea salts have different levels of flavor so start with half of what the recipe calls for and go from there. Keep in mind that depending on what kind of peppers you use the sauce will be green, yellow or red. Thanks you for a wonderful recipe.  We will showcase this recipe at our restaurant in the near future.

Love this! You can use a variety of peppers, and I like the mint in it. So much better than what you find in the stores!

Excellent. I did make some changes since I didn't have any Mint on hand. I added toasted ground Caraway and Fennel seeds to the recipe. I used New Mexico Chiles that are somewhat mild and a small handfull of Arbol Chiles to turn up the heat and omitted the Cilantro. I upped the Cumin and Coriander since I love very spicy. Great on anything, especially grilled foods! THX!

Very similar to what we have when we go to North Africa. It had great heat. We had it with lamb burgers. I can't wait to try it tomorrow with tuna.

I've never eaten Harissa before but need it for a number of recipes in a new cookbook I received for Christmas.  I couldn't find the product ANYwhere, so I made it myself. It's pretty good! 

I don't know my way around hot peppers, but all I could find were Scotch Bonnet Peppers (my fingers still burn a little from chopping them up)!  I also made the mistake of adding the full 1/2 cup of olive oil to the mix ... so the texture is obviously more fluid than a paste.  In any case, I've made the first recipe that uses it and it tastes fantastic as the main source of flavour (with garlic). Oh, it also did not turn out red. More of a green ... perhaps because the ratio was off when I added all the olive oil?

I followed this recipe to a tee and unfortunately found it inedible. 1 tbsp was WAAAAY too much salt! We literally couldn't taste anything but salt, which totally ruined this for me. I tried to mellow out the sodium by dumping half of the batch and adding more of every other ingredient, but the flavors still weren't balanced; it just tasted like a spicy, very salty pesto. I made a last-ditch effort at using the harissa by mixing some with coconut milk and adding it to a simple garlic reduction I was making for chicken. It was passable but no better than that. I was really looking forward to this recipe.

This is a great recipe. I'm not exactly sure what "6 oz" of thai peppers is, volume, weight, what. I used about 25-30 peppers and it didn't weigh anywhere near 6 oz. I'd probably be on fire had i used that much.

I made this and I'm afraid to say it was too spicy for my tastes.  So after I tasted it, I decided to add the juice of one lemon and a bit of honey to tone down the hotness.  Then I added about two tablespoons to a chopped mango and halved cherry tomatoes to make a salsa with grilled chicken.  That was just right!

This was great!  I'm sure doing it "as is" is even better but I had to omit the mint because I didn't have any.  Also, I used some chili powder and cayenne powder because I didn't have chilis either.  As the sauce was sitting on my counter waiting to be used, the smell was immaculate!

This Harissa recipe is INCREDIBLE!!!  I was trying a new recipe that called for Harissa, but couldn't find it anywhere.  So, I turned to allrecipes.com and tried this.  This turned out so good I now keep a jar of it in the fridge for hamburgers, eggs, meatloaf- just about anything!  I like spicy food, but not too spicy.  Somehow this manages to have the perfect balance of spiciness and flavor.  You can't go wrong.  It is spicy, flavorful, and salty all at once and is the best sauce I have ever had.  My husband even loves the spiciness of this and he isn't happy unless he is sweating and crying when he eats spicy food.  It was somehow perfect for both of us.
