This was a great quick and flavorful meal.  I did not have soymilk, so I used skim and it was delicious. The Parmesan cheese melted and formed a flavorful crust, keeping the spaghetti moist and tender. Thanks for sharing.

i didn't have spaghetti noodles in my pantry so made it with egg noodles.  My husband loved it.  Followed instructions fairly closely, used skim milk and added extra cheese and topped with even more cheese, it browned up nicely .

Really good for leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  I'll be using this every year!  Substitutions I made were using Kosher salt instead of salt, 1% milk instead of soy, and I used 1 cup of milk and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  Even the kids ages 4 and 5 were pleased.  Happy cooking!

Delicious recipe!   I have one VERY similar - it calls for heavy cream instead of soymilk.  The soymilk would certainly make it much healthier.   My recipe also calls for the addition of cream sherry (about 1/4 cup) into the sauce.  It adds a terrific flavor.  I think my family looks forward more to the Turkey Tetrazzini than they do the actual turkey dinner!   It's a great dinner while watching some good football!

Made this tonight with our leftover Christmas turkey. It was excellent, I used 1 cup of whipping cream in place of 1 cup milk, an extra 1/2 cup of Parmesan, and Johny's Seasoning salt.

Very easy and very yummy! I love that it doesn't use cream of anything soup like so many others do. I think the fact that you make your own sauce is key. I used 1% milk since that's what we drink. I also added a little extra cheese on top. But I think the sauce is the best part.

Fast and easy!  I used skim instead of soy milk and it worked fine.  I also threw in a handful of cheddar cheese as my kids love anything cheesy.  It gave the dish a nice color. I also sprinkled parm and a little cheddar on the very top.  Right before serving, I broiled the top for a minute.  Yum! Everyone loved it, and it made for great leftovers!  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I both loved it.  I used 2% milk instead of soy and added about 1 cup of green beans frozen from our garden.

I cubed 3 cups cooked turkey. Melted 6 tbsp. butter as directed & stirred in 5 tbsp. flour. I stirred in a 14 oz. can chicken broth,2 cups 2 % milk1 can crème of mushroom soup,1/4C sherry, 1 1/4C parmesan cheese, about 1/4C cheddar cheese, 2 small cans drained mushrooms and 3/4C defrosted peas. I added salt, pepper, a little onion powder, garlic powder, rosemary, & poultry seasoning. Without all these spices, it tasted a bit bland. I only had egg noodles on hand so I mixed in 3/4 bag cooked egg noodles. I sprayed a baking dish with pam, added the mixture and topped with a little more parmesan .I baked it at 375 degrees for around 45 minutes. It turned out excellent. The first time I made this recipe it was ok but my family didn't love it. This time they ate seconds...A lot of these changes I got from other reviewers and it made all the difference.

Delicious. Fast and easy. Made, but substituting egg noodles instead of spaghetti and used regular 2% milk instead of soy. Very happy with results.

I made seven individual oven proof dishes with this recipe which I will freeze. It is delicious. Only difference is I cut the broccolli into very small pieces, stirfried them with the mushrooms ahead of time. As well I put Parmesan cheeze on top

This was enjoyed by all - even one picky eater!  I used 2% milk rather than soymilk because that is what we use and what was on hand.  I also added a little rosemary since the recipe did not seem to have much seasoning.

I think this was fabulous! I tweaked it just a little, adding onion and garlic powder. I didn't use mushrooms (just mushroomed out after the Holiday, I guess) and regular 2% milk (it was what I had). I used equal parts Parmesan and Italian bread crumbs mixed with ½ as much melted butter for the top. DH (Mr. Picky of the century) loved it too, it's going into the rotation!

I did not care for this recipe as written.  The measurements seem wrong!  I used only 2 lbs. of turkey and 1/2 lb. of mushrooms, but even so the liquid measurements all need to be at least doubled.  Use 12 TBSP of butter to avoid the flour gumming up, and if you don't want the turkey to overwhelm the sauce, use at least 4 cups of soy milk and 2-3 cups of checken broth.  I discovered that the hard way after scalding my sauce pan (which should be at least a 6-qt size).  Finally, bake at 350, not 450, for about 45 minutes.  It came out reasonably well, and I'll make it again, but please be sure to use enough liquid!
