This is a delicious recipe that has quickly become a favorite of my family.  The only thing I change is I use half the oil, and for more flavor add two cloves of garlic, pressed.  I have taken this salad to luncheons and everyone wants a copy of the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This is a light refreshing salad. Its a great dish, especially if you enjoy tomatoes and feta. I recommend trying to eat it quickly as if its in the fridge for more than a couple days it starts to go bad. I used Kalamata olives and added a splash of balsamic vinegar.

Brought this to a friend's BBQ and it received rave reviews!  I subbed black olives for the green and loved the taste.

Delicious! I added three tomatoes instead of one and less olive-oil (extra light). Fresh herbs really make it good! Be careful with adding salt: olives and feta are already salty.

Excellent as a side dish . Will use dried dill and parsley next time. The fresh herbs tasted too grassy. I added some  chopped marinated artichoke hearts and its liquid, chopped cukes and a couple of dashes of balsamic vinegar. Makes a good amount.

This was a very tasty salad.  I love orzo and feta so I thought it would be.  I didn't use as much olive oil as the recipe called for and it was still yummy!  Thanks, Sabrina, for another great pasta salad recipe from this site.

A very unique salad to serve at a garden luncheon or picnic.  Go easy on the feta cheese as it is quite salty if you use too much.  mmm...

Delicious pasta salad! I've been looking for a nice dry pasta salad using dill and feta and this is IT! I don't think I'll be making any other pasta salads for a long time. This was perfect. I added some broccoli to it. Great for a summer bar-b-que. Nice and light with a Greek flavor.

This recipe is fabulous.  Such great flavors all in one simple salad.  I just cut the amount of olive oil in half to cut down on the fat.  It's great!

Well, first hint, don't use dried dill.. tastes like sticks in the salad.  Interesting, but missing something, maybe more olives, maybe some italian dressing instead of lemon/vinegar combo.. I don't know, I don't think I'll make it again.

Great taste, quick (cooking the pasta is what took the longest) and with few ingredients: a keeper in my books! I added a splash of balsamic vinegar, 1 tbsp toasted pine nuts and an extra tomato but I used less olive oil than what the recipe called for. Feel free to play with the ingredients, I'm sure artichoke hearts, arugula or even sun-dried tomatoes would do great in this.

This is definately an adult dish.  My husband and I loved it.  A nice alternative to the traditional Italian pasta salad.  Very mild flavored.

I tried this recipe using dried herbs and fortunately I knew enough to use LESS, not MORE than you would of the fresh herbs - dried herbs are more concentrated (the statement made by the recipe provider was incorrect). Follow the recipe exactly if using fresh herbs, but cut the herb amounts at least in half if using dried. The salad was great, but I did use balsamic vinegar rather than lemon. Also, I agree with the other reviewer about adding pressed, fresh garlic. Wonderful flavor combinations and no need to worry about a mayonnaise-based dressing!

This salad was just okay. I did like the fresh herbs but still preferred other pasta salads I have made. I did not add olives since I dislike olives. We will not make this again.

Make sure to use salt and pepper.  Had a ton of people ask me for the recipe.  I used a little less oil and black olives instead of green.

This is an awesome recipe, and it looks great too. The first time I made it I forgot the step that calls to include oil and lemon juice, and after having made it a second time including those ingredients, I prefer it omitted. I think it would be nice with a bit of fresh squeezed lemon, but the oil is completely unnecessary. The only other thing I changed was I used sliced black olives instead of green because they are cheaper.

This was pretty good.  The dressing, if made according to the recipe, is a little bland.  I added a splash of balsamic vinegar to provide more flavor.  I also added extra olives and 1/2 a cucumber chopped.

This is a fabulous dish for a picnic or potluck exchange.  Amazingly easy and the taste is trendy.  I made mine with black olives but think that green as in the recipe would'v been even better.  I thought it was delicious. I will certainly save this recipe.

A very tasty recipe, and with tri-colored orzo, red
tomatoes and green olives it's very colorful, too. I
followed the recipe to a tee except cutting the oil
back to an 1/8 of a cup, only used 1 tsp. of dried
dill and omitted the parsley altogether. I let it chill
overnight, and the flavors melded nicely. A five
star recipe that is highly recommended!

OMG ... this was fantastic !!! I changed it up abit ... I bought a small container of cubed feta with olives marinated in oil to the orzo. I chopped green and black olives, artichoke hearts (4 tbsps), grape tomatoes and fresh parsley.  I used about 1/4 cup of Kraft Signature Balsamic Vinaigrette for flavor.  Rave reviews from everyone !!!

This was pretty tasty!  I used only about half of the oil called for, used dried herbs and therefore cut the amounts in half (not doubled!!!!), and added some good splashes of balsamic vinegar - really enhances the flavor.  I thought it was a bit too oily, but leftovers the next day proved that this dish is definitely one that should be refrigerated and served the day after preparing - it was so much better!  Thanks for a good mix of ingredients that can be easily added to!

This is bursting with flavor when I substituted balsamic vinegar in place of lemon juice and wow!
I also added chopped cucumber to it as a bonus for veggies and the vinegar brought out the flavor. This dish disappears fast in my household and it is so easy to make.

I really liked this. Followed the recipes except added more dill and parsley because I love them. Added minced garlic to the dressing. And a splash of balsamic at the end. Was so tasty and tastes even better now for lunch the next day. Will definitely use this for a brunch or summertime BBQ.

This was pretty good but not my favorite. I like dill but it seemed to overpower this dish. If I make again I will cut back on the dill and use half green and half black olives.

I doubled this recipe and used fresh tomatoes instead of sun-dried ones. I also used spicy Italian salad dressing and just a little bit of olive oil and lemon juice to taste. I thought the herbs sounded like an odd combination, so I used about 1/4 c. fresh chopped basil, which goes perfectly with tomatoes. With these changes, the salad was very good. I made the day before to allow the flavors to merge, and then just added a little bit of extra dressing right before serving.

Made for a bacholorette party and everyone liked this.  I made changes tho. I browned my orzo in olive oil, then boiled in chicken broth for more flavor.  Omitted the dill and swapped the green olives for black.  Added a splash of greek vinagerette too.

I followed the advice of others and used black olives instead of green, decreased the amount of oil, used only a splash of lemon juice and added Balsamic vinager.  Very Good!  I took it to a cook-out and everybody loved it.

I loved this, my husband said it was okay. It's lighter fare - the sweeter the tomatos, the better. Lovely for a ladies luncheon. I agree with the other reviewers, it is better the next day and I could have eaten this all day long! Note: You'll need a smaller strainer for the orzo - otherwise, the orzo may slip through your colander! Enjoy!

I guess I'm one of the few that didn't care for this. It lacked flavor in the dressing, and I even added a jar of marinated artichoke hearts along with the marinade and a some balsamic vinegar. It makes a colorful salad though. I added cucumbers and additional olives, including black. If I make this again(?), I will find a different dressing to use with it.

I used brown rice because I couldn't find whole wheat orzo. I halved the feta because I only had half a cup on hand, doubled the tomato, and used a whole jar of green olives (drained, sliced, and pimentos removed). I also added a generous pinch of dried mint. I don't care for green olives but my husband liked it a lot.

So great, even with my changes. I left out the olives and added sun dried tomatoes, cucumber, and a regular tomato. Also substituted dried dill  instead of fresh. My only issue with this is after it's been sitting in the fridge for a while, it tends to get a bit dry. So I suggest added half the dressing before it sits in the fridge and half of it when you are ready to serve. A great summer dish!

I thought it was very good. Good for a summer day or a side dish, even adding chicken would be good. It wasn't the best I ever had but I would make it again.

Very refreshing salad. I had to use dried dill and parsley since I had that on hand, and I left out the salt since the olives were plenty salty as it is.

Wow! Excellent. The taste is amazing and the dish looks so good too. Everything a five star dish should be. I let this chill in the fridge for a few hours to let the flavors combine before serving. I added a splash of balsamic vinegar and it really enhanced the dish. Definitely a dish you could serve to company. I will make this again!

Very good.  Even better the second day.  Adjusted per reviews.  I used black olives with the feta and dried herbs since I didn't have fresh.  Added pressed garlic cloves and balsamic vinegar per other reviews and increased the EVOO.  Since I halved the recipe for my hubby and myself I used the 1/4 cup EVOO for 3 servings.  The left over serving was even better the following day so I'll make it the night before from now on.

Excellant bright summer salad! It is perfect as is, but if you're like me, you might want to add some toasted pine nuts / chick peas / sundried tomatos/ AND possibly some papadew peppers for a bit of sweet tang. i will make this all summer long and it's going to be a hit with the girlfriends when they hang out and drink wine!

This recipe has been around for a long time and originally titled Vermont Orzo/Tomato Salad with Feta and Olives Served at a farmhouse in VT.  It's wonderful for summer as it has no mayo.  It's always a hit when I take it!

This was one of the best tomato salads I have made.  I did take the advice of others and cut back on the olive oil.  I also added some green onions and added more olives.  I did not have any dill and it still tasted great!  I did not use any salt because of all the salt in the olives and feta.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you

This was a good recipe but it seemed like it was missing something.  I think I might try more veggies next time and cook the orzo a little less so it's a little more firm.

Unfortunately, this didn't seem to have a huge amount of flavor to me. I think their was just too much orzo. If I make it again, I will half the pasta or double the other ingredients. I was the only one who ate it in my family, so I had it over some torn romaine for a couple of lunches and that made a nice light lunch.

Not bad......used black pitted olives. Found it to be not too tasty, (lacked a bit). Great light meal. 16 yr old found that there was too much 'green'in it (the dill/parsley). Don't know that I'd make it again.

Be careful on what kind of olive oil you use.  Mine had a very strong flavor and that was hard to overcome.  Also, we put the salad in the fridge  and served it cold and it was  much better serve at room temp

Very good! Not too strong, the natural flavors of the ingredients blend very nicely and do not need more dressing, I feel! Of course, I used far less oil and lemon juice than the recipe called for...less than a quarter cup of oil, and I just put half as much lemon juice as oil, it worked out fine! Thanks for a great recipe that I'll use again for sure!

The dressing was a bit oily and bland for me so I ended up using a few tablespoons of light balsamic dressing.  In general, I don't like lots of dressing, oils etc in my food.  I will definitely make this again as the combo of feta, olives, dill etc was delicious.

Tasty salad! I had never used Orzo pasta before and wasn't sure about it, but it turned out great and was a nice change from the typical spiral pasta that is used in nearly every pasta salad.  I used black olives instead of green olives.  I made this for a company get together and it was in the refrigerator overnight and before the luncheon I lightly tossed it with some additional olive oil and lemon to freshen it up.  Very nice salad.  I would make this one again.

Great recipe as is, no need to add to it like others suggest.  You must use fresh herbs though...otherwise the taste is not the same.  Lasts for days in the fridge.  Goes well with BBQ'ed shrimp scewers or a shrimp/butter lettuce salad.

Nice flavor - but needed a bit of zip.  I did use Kalamata olives (like them better than green).  Very pretty salad.

This dish was wonderfully light but very satisfying. I was only able to chill it for about 30 minutes before serving and felt it needed a little more "kick". I gave it a liberal sprinkling of Balsamic vinegar and then retossed it before serving. Perfection and the vinegar gave it a light golden color. I haven't used Orzo before but I can't wait to find other recipes using this great pasta.

This recipe makes for a quick and easy side dish.  I did feel as though something was missing, and thus I added a splash of red wine vinegar.  I'm not sure I'll make this as written again, but perhaps I'll make some variation as I liked the orzo.

I used the recipe exactly; except I needed it to be gluten free so I used cooked brown rice and wild rice or you could use Quinoa. If you have gluten free noodles on hand- go for it/I was out sadly. I love the flavors. I would add mushrooms in place of olives if salt is a concern. A keeper.

This recipe has been sitting in my recipe box for over 2 years.  I made it omitting the olives as we are not fond of them.  Orzo is a pasta choice that my guys have not decided if they enjoy it or not.  Every time I make something with it they wonder what it is.  We love fresh tomatoes and feta is one of our favorite cheeses, so I had hopes with this recipe.  Everyone liked it and it went well with ‘BLT Wraps’ from AR.

I substituted the parsley with cilantro, and the feta with goat cheese, and found this to be one of the best pasta salads I've ever experienced. You need to try this!

Excellent!  I did add extra tomatoes, swapped the dill for basil and cut the oil/lemon dressing in half.  My son who doesn't like that "cheese"  had seconds.  Tasted even better after chilling for about an hour.

I didn't care for the dill in this recipe. I thought it was an odd combination. Maybe I'll try it again with basil. I followed the recipe to a tee, even using fresh herbs. I brought it to 4th of July party. I didn't receive the rave reviews others reported.

Nice pasta salad!  Made this to go with our burgers last night for something a little different.  We both liked it!  I did make some changes based on personal preference.  I really didn't measure - just eyeballed what I thought was about right.  I'm sure I doubled the green olives and I added some green onion for a little more color.  Rather than using the lemon juice/olive oil dressing, I used a zesty Italian and I didn't mix the feta into the salad - just sprinkled some on top of each serving as a garnish.

We really quite enjoyed this salad and will definitely be making again. First and foremost, you have to like green olives. If you don't, pass on this recipe as the olive flavor is quite prominent. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a tee with one exception, by adding 1 teaspoon of white sugar to the dressing.  It is not noticable and cuts acidic taste back a bit.

Loved it,used half the oil as suggested, dried herbs worked fine, black olives instead of green and acini de pepe (I think that's right,tiny ball like pasta) instead of orzo making the salad look and taste unique.It was a hit.

This salad was delicious and a welcome alternative to the usual macaroni salad for steaks & burgers. I prepared it with all ingredients except dill because my family doesn't like it and it was still good.  The saltiness of the feta and olives and the citrus from the lemon are perfect together.  I'll be making this all summer.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought this was fantastic.  My boyfriend doesn't like feta or green olives, so I told him the cheese was American and hoped he wouldn't notice the olives.  He did notice the olives, and said the cheese tasted "funny" and wouldn't eat it.  That's okay.  More for me!  YUM!

Well...I am always on this site it seems looking for something new and different.  I have a very picky family including the husband.  Well I made this for me today and it is awesome.  Im a newcomer to the world of Feta and this pasta salad is unbelievable.  I did not add extra salt because i salted the orzo water and the feta has enough.  I added a clove of pressed garlic and chopped red onion, i also added a 1/2 tsp of dried oregano.  this is my new me dish ill eat the whole thing myself.

I made this for the first time with the grilled sea bass recipe. It was fabulous! I used kalamata olives instead of green and added just a half clove minced garlic to the dressing mix with salt and pepper.  The herbs make it very fresh and tasty!  Next time I will add sliced red onions and cucumbers.  Thanks for sharing!

Nice salad for a light meal! I thought it tasted a bit too olivey (not sure if its from the green olives or olive oil), but next time I make it I will probably cut back on the olive oil. As suggested by others, I added cucumbers and used grape tomatoes, and added about 1/8 cup of balsamic vinegar. My husband, who loves olives just adored this salad!

This was so yummy!  I made extra dressing and used it to marinate some chicken breasts which I then grilled and added to the salad for a great meal. I also used grape tomatoes.  Tasty and healthy...appreciate that...thanks Sabrina!

we loved this salad and I will make it again. I did use black olives and took suggestions from others such as fresh garlic, fresh grape tomatoes cut in half, fresh sweet onion, and chunks of cucumbers and balsamic vinegar and lemon juice. i used all the dressing and I  think it would of been dry  if not all was used other wise.

Ok, I'm a "regular" on All Recipes and have used many recipes with great success. My family found the flavor lacking. When I asked my family about what to do with the recipe the answer was "toss it".

I have been making this recipe since I saw it, abut 6 mos. ago.  Although we like salads made with mayonaise, this salad is a refreshing change.  Our family and friends love it! The only changes I made were to use black olives, not green, and add fresh basil. I belive chilling for 2+ hours before serving is best. Delicious next day, if there is any left.

This is a nice light salad. Used black olives instead of green. Instead of parsley I used fresh basil. This salad makes a nice lunch or side dish.

Wonderful!  Couldn't find fresh dill so I used dried - 1 heaping tablespoon was just right.  For the Vegan's in my house, the Feta was omitted and it was still a very tasty main dish for them.  We love garlic so I doubled the garlic to 4 cloves.  Made a second batch to have the next day and also added a can of drained artichoke hearts, chopped.  Goes well with the other flavors and I recommend this addition.  We also like kalamata olives so that's what I used in both salads - we always have them on hand.  The flavors are good if you eat this the same day, but out of this world the next day!  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

I love this simple and easy to make salad. The first time I made it, I followed the directions exactly except for the dill (didnt have any) and felt that the green olives made it too salty for my personal taste. Since then, I've switched to black olives, always use fresh parsley and omit the dill completely (personal preference). This is a simple but refreshing salad that you can definately make your own by adding different ingredients to customize to your liking or depending on what is in season. I eat this as a meal, but it would make a great side dish also. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!

Loved this salad!! Used kalamata olives because they seemed to go better w/the feta and lemon - more Greek. Served it w/Grilled Shrimp Scampi and it was a wonderful combination. Will definitely make this again.

This made a nice lunch.  It was easy to prepare the ingredients while the orzo was cooking.  I used cherry tomatoes and herbed feta which gave it a kick.  I also left out the lemon juice and just tossed with olive oil. Will add more olives next time.

Yum! I left out a tablespoon of the olive oil to cut down on fat, and used black olives instead of green (all I had). The dill in this is fantastic... I will definitely be making this again.

I substituted cucumber for olives and also added a bit of whipped dressing to thicken up the dressing a bit.  Was tasty but seemed to be missing something.  Will try a dash of balsamic next time.

I enjoyed this salad, everyone else was that crazy about it. Dill was a little too strong, I think that I'll cut it back the next time.

Loved it. I think it's best to make pasta salads a day ahead. This one held up fine in the fridge overnight. Love the dill and parsley. I thought it was really great. Served with Garlic Lemon grilled skewers.

This is FABULOUS !. I left out the parsley because it tastes grassy to me. and I used Dill paste insteadof fresh because thats what I had.. It turned out great,I sprinkled a little parsley flakes  over top for the heck of it.

I didn't change anything in this recipe. It's delightful exactly as it is. I agree that it is best if chilled overnight to blend the flavors. It is also nice served warm just after mixing.

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  I made double this recipe for the BBQ the night before my wedding and it was gone by the end of the night (15 guests).  I recommend making it the night before serving it to allow the ingredients to meld.

Yum! I didn't have lemon juice so used lime juice, and I reduced the EVOO a bit. Used jalapeno stuffed green olives for a little kick. Great salad!

Very good. Very tangy and salty without even adding any salt. I added a chopped shallot to mine and used a little canola oil in place of olive oil just cause i didn't have any. It was very good.

This was a great salad, fresh and light, yummy!  I didn't have fresh dill, so used about 1/2 tsp dried (could use a bit more next time) and also altered my oil/vinegar ratios as I normally do (don't like as much oil in my dressings).  I also added some balsamic per other reviews and threw in some yellow and orange diced peppers to use up (added nice colour too!).  Overall fantastic!

I made this for a casual barbecue instead of the usual pasta salad and doubled the batch.  I used the ingredients as a guide and made a couple of adjustments - using sweet "cherub" grape tomatoes instead of a large tomato which added a good contrast and used the whole 4 oz package of crumbled feta which was just about right.  I also used fresh dill & parsley out of my garden - but used less than double so it wasn't too overpowering.  I only had 30-40 min to make and chill it and it still came out wonderfully.  There was only a tiny bit left that night - it was a huge hit!  Everyone kept commenting on how fresh & tasteful it was.  I'll be adding this to my repertoire.

This was just okay. The lemon juice/olive oil combination was pretty bland. I think this would have been better with a greek-style dressing.

This recipe is so good!  It's a great way to use home-grown dill.  Flavor is not too strong and I love the texture.  I sliced the olives in half to distribute them more evenly and omited the pepper altogether.  It didn't require much salt.  I can't wait to try it after it chills overnight when the flavors really come together!

I had to cut down on the oil - I mixed everything but the oil, then poured it on as needed. I ended up using very little oil (probably 2-3 tbsp). It tasted really good, I will make this again for sure.

Turned out to be a tasty side at a potluck, but the texture felt a little greasy for my taste, leaving it tasting less 'fresh'. I would definitely use less oil next time.

This is a summertime salad that can't be beat!  I brought it to a BBQ and every single person complimented it!  (6 of those people were under 14 years old!)  However, I made it without the green olives.  That may have changed the kid's opinions, but not mine!  Good recipe!

Too bad...we didn't like this...I  think it has too many conflicting flavors and they seem to cancel each other out, rather than add because net result was rather flavorless. The orzo was fun though and I plan on using that again

When I boiled up to orzo, instead of adding salt to the water, I added no-chicken soup powder (about 2 tsp) to give the orzo a little flavor. I also added 2 tsp of fresh chopped oregano, about 12-15 basil leaves, cut in strips (chiffonade) and a tsp of dried chives. (if you dont have fresh oregano, 1/2 tsp of dried should do). In addition, I used the corn from 1/2 of a large cob or about 1/3 cup corn niblets, 1 jarred roasted red pepper, cut into small strips and 3 slices of a large red onion, quartered. For the dressing I mixed 1/4 cup EVOO with 1 oz of balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp dijon mustard. Oh and I used Alfonso Olives (you can use Kalamata if Alfonso not available) and threw in a few jumbo green olives stuffed with garlic. This dish was a big hit with my family. I almost forgot - make certain that when you purchase your feta cheese that you get feta made from sheep's milk, not cow's milk and they both have very different flavors.

This is a recipe my mom made when we visited and my kids loved it. They ask for it periodically and it is really easy. I never have fresh dill, so 2 teaspoons of dry dill is plenty. I also use cherry or grape tomatoes sliced in half. I served it with baked chicken tenders marinated in Italian dressing but realized you could slice or dice the chicken into the salad for a one-dish meal!

Made this as directed except I tripled the recipe and brought it to a family get together. I was told by many that they loved it, and I believe them because it was all eaten.
Very easy to make, and I made it the day before to save time.
I will make this again.

lemon was not very pronounced,  added a bit of white vinegar to give it some bite.   since we love feta, added more to make it a light main dish.

This recipe was not extraordinary, but was good still. I prepared it on a pretty hot summer and it did help cooling off the heat! Kudos for that. However, I felt like it was missing something even though I added one crushed garlic clove. Maybe next time I will add balsamic or red wine vinegar to see if the issue is in the dressing. I adjusted the oil as many seem to have found that it was too much. I will make it again but will definitely tweak it in the dressing department.

I like the feta with orzo and tomatoes - the dressing was tasty!  I didn't have any olives on hand.  I don't care for the taste of dill much, so next time I make this I'll either lessen the amount of dill or omit and will add basil in its place.

Made as described except for using 1 1/2 tsp dried dill as that is what I had on had. Delicious. Watch adding salt as olives and feta already are salty tasting. I think it would be great with some large boiled shrimp added in!

We love this "starter" recipe. It is called that because even though I rarely make changes to a recipe, this one is so user friendly. Taking this to a friends where she will add chicken or shrimp for a light summer dinner. I used what I had which was cucumbers, black olives, jarred marinaded artichokes, dried parsley, fresh dill, fresh lemon juice and a splash of white balsamic. I mixed mine while still warm so the orzo soaked up the dressing. Yum, yum.

This is  a very refreshing great salad.  I only had  basil tomato feta so used that, but I'm sure it would be just as good with regular feta cheese.  it would be good to  take as a dish to pass  also. I will make it again for sure, my husband  gave it 10 stars! I didn't have enough  fresh dill, my plants are young, so used dried with the fresh.  I also used dried parsley and it was still good.
  The second time I made it I used up some fresh mozzarella that I had, it  was just as good.  It is so refreshing. This time I had enough  fresh dill and parsley.

Very good, nice fresh summery taste.  Definitely has a unique flavor that not all will like (husband wasn't a huge fan), but I thought it was a refreshing change.  Used cow's milk feta flavored with basil and tomato since I can't stand goat cheese.

I'm a bit sentimental cuz this is the first recipe I ever made from this site, (Dont know why I never got @ to reviewing). Sometimes I make a bowl of this just for me as a meal! I usually increase the Parsley and dill. I've also used Ricotta Salada instead of feta for a less Briney taste.
