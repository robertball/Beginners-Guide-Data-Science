I agree with the other reviews...needs more zip.  What I did was to pound some Montreal Seasoning into the chicken before cutting it into strips rather than chunks.  Sauteed in evoo and butter before adding the garlic just so the garlic wouldn't burn and get bitter.  Added some broccoli that I had on hand and threw in a few pieces of tomato that I also had.  The additions made it a bit more interesting and more flavorful.  Enjoy.

This was super easy and quick to make, but like the other reviewer said, as written it is a bit bland. If I make it again, I will flavor it up a bit with spices and herbs that my family enjoys.

I seasoned the chicken really good and added some brocolli.  After adding the pasta to the pan, I stired in a 1/2 of Clearman's Original Spread.  That made it amazing!

Super Helpful! Like most people, I didn't follow directions step for step, but this is a great instructional on how to get to where you want to go. Everyone's tastes are a little different, but if you haven't made a chicken pasta before, this will get you going...made my day! Thank you!

I needed a quick and easy recipe and had very little on hand.  How amazing that everything here (ok garlic powder instead of cloves) on hand!  This worked out perfect for us.  I served it with a broccoli and Parmesan cheese.  Easy fix, even easier clean up!  Thank you for posting, this is going in my recipe box.  :D

Great easy pasta dish that the kids love.  I tend to add a little more garlic since I love garlic.  I usually let the cooking wine mostly cook off so it's mostly olive oil to coat the chicken.

It  was very bland. I will probably make again and doctor it up.

I made this but I also agree that it needed a little kick to it. So before I cooked it I marinated my chicken in a sauce i made with some olive oil, balsamic vinegar, red wine, oregano, and rosemary. Then I cooked it in the olive oil with a little garlic and the white wine. It was delicious!

Very fast and easy. Worked perfectly for a weeknight on the first day of the semester. Added yellow onion, dry ground oregano, dry ground cilantro, dry ground lemon peel, and a tablespoon of unsalted butter.

This was easy and fast.  Other reviews indicated this recipe needed some extra flavor, so I was liberal with the salt and pepper called for and also added poultry seasoning to the chicken.  I served this with a side of steamed broccoli.  After tasting, we added shredded sharp white cheddar cheese and it was a delicious addition that I really liked.
