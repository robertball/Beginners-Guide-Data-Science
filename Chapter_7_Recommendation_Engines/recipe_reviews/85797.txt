I love yogurt cheese. I use coffee filters instead of cheesecloth and it works just as well. I love to make yogurt cheese patties. Roll them in bread crumbs and pan fry them and serve them atop greens with a vinagrette. It makes an excellent salad!

Ohh~!! Nice way to make creamy cheese! Loved it! Although instead of waiting for the water to drain away I just poured the mix on a clean handkerchief placed on a strainer and twisted the cloth to manually drain it while watching TV. I just couldnâ€™t wait for the two days. It was easy and not messy at all. I did this until there was no more water to drain. Just remember to wash your hands very well. You can instantly see how the cheese forms.

YUM!  I changed things up a bit though...  I didn't add anything to the yogurt, and since I didn't have cheese cloth, I used 2 paper towels.  It worked great!

After the yogurt cheese was made, I added chopped green olives!  YUM!  Also, the second time I tried this, I added chopped cucumbers, salt, garlic and dry dill.

This is my new favorit recipe!

I love this. I've been making this for years. I use a mesh strainer with a coffee filter. I also use non-fat yogurt. I don't add anything to the yogurt before straining. I add garlic, dried veggies, and/or other spices to it after it's strained as I need it. This is especially good for dieters who need a non-fat alternative for dressings, dips, sauces, spreads, etc.

This recipe got me on a yogurt cheese kick.  I have been making my own yogurt from milk and store bought plain yogurt...organic, full fat, low fat, reduced fat, even vanilla flavored. Every bit of the yogurt cheese I have made has been delicious. I use coffee filters.

I've gotten my friends very interested in making yogurt and yogurt cheese which we use for sour cream or continue on to the cream cheese stage. It's great in all recipes calling for those two items.

You can also use clean coffee filters instead of cheesecloth if there is none available to you.  Just make sure you overlap the edges so the yogurt doesn't get through.  Also, try using cheese without gum or gelatin because it can keep the curds and whey from separating.

Not that I followed this recipe to the tee, however, I've been making yogurt cheese for some time. I also agree that you can use coffee filters/paper towels, etc. to strain the yogurt. I don't bother buying cheese cloth to do this. In any event, I also use the full fat yogurt vs low or non-fat variety. I use this "cheese" for many reasons from potato salad and so on. You can dress this up or down depending on what you are striving for in a recipe. I love it! I don't add the garlic unless I think it will go with whatever recipe I'm using it for or in. This is way better than using just ready made yogurt!

This is what is known traditionally as labneh cheese, originating (like yogurt) from the Mediterranean/Middle East regions. It's basically Greek yogurt drained a bit more. Plain yogurt is very tangy/sour on its own, largely in part due to the whey. A lot of folks that don't like regular yogurt like Greek yogurt because it's had a bigger portion of the whey drained off, making it more mellow. If you're getting a really tangy/sour bite to the cheese, odds are it's still got more whey in it. The first batch I made I used just a coffee filter in a colander over a bowl. It was no longer draining, but still very moist, and in the end very tangy/sour. The second batch I put paper towels under the filter and changed them out every few hours in hopes of siphoning off more whey. It was definitely better, but still pretty sour. So I've bit the bullet and bought some cheesecloth ($2 for 3'x3' @ Walmart) and will be hanging my next batch. I'm thinking the weight of the yogurt itself will help press more of the whey out. For some good tips on things to make with yogurt and on making labneh, I would recommend David and Jill Fankhauser's site on milk/yogurt/cheesemaking. For now I'm going to take my second batch and try mixing it up with some leftover BLT bacon and some herbs. Hoping to make a kind of sandwich spread from it.

I did not have any cheesecloth on hand, so I used a clean, white handkerchief.  It worked perfectly!  I used yogurt that I made in my yogurt maker, and it came out great.  I added all sorts of fresh herbs and spices and used it as a spread for pitas with hummus.

I couldn't get over how easy, and tasty, this cheese was. It made a great veggie dip, and a perfect sandwich spread. I made it according to the recipe this time, but I can't wait to experiment with the ingredients. Fresh dill is up first!

This is a delicious dip. It is great with a little dry mint sprinkled on top. Use it with toasted pita or pita chips. Try it, you will be happily surprised

We've been making yogurt cheese for years and found that the Donvier Yogurt stainer works great.  It's a mesh strainer that fits into a container with a lid.  So easy and you don't have to mess with cheesecloth.  You can buy it on Amazon.

I hadn't tried adding in the ingredients before straining and it is a nice way to get to the finished product. I use a flatfold birdseye cloth diaper to strain my homemade yogurt (obviously used exclusively for this purpose) and think it works way better than cheesecloth... and it's reusable. Thanks!

This is a wonderful recipe.  The first time I made it after it was completely drained I added 1 tablespoon of honey and 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon.  I used graham crackers for dipping....YUM!!!  Next time I make it I will use savory spices instead of the sweet.

I added the garlic ,spices&salt after straining the yogurt. Its always better to add afterwards so as to enhance flavours.if u add it before straining u'll loose the flavour.strain in fridge else the curd might get too sour. It took me a day (overnight )to get rid of the liquid.

Don't throw away the whey (liquid leftovers)  If you make your own mayo you can add about a tablespon of the whey to "ferment" the mayo.  It won't change the flavor but it preserves the mayo naturally so that it will last for a month or more instead of just a few days to a week.

I make yogurt cheese all the time. I do it on my countertop for about 8 -10 hours, hanging from one of my kitchen cabinet handles. Much faster! The liquid that drains off is actually the Whey (as in curds & whey). It is full of nutrition and should be saved & used! That's where all the protein is. It can be put in smoothies, & used to lacto-ferment veggies (pickles, sauerkraut, etc). The possibilities are endless!

Mine was inedible due to too much garlic, and I'm a garlic lover! I will make this again to try it with different spices, as I think it will make a nice spread.

This recipe was so much fun to make. I took some viewers tips and squeezed the yoghurt for about 30 minutes to speed up the process. Next time, I will let sit in the fridge. The result is a nice, spreadable cheese with surprisingly strong flavor.

This cheese is delicious and so easy to make!  Iâ€™m a huge cheese person, but am trying to eat healthier these days and this cheese helps me do just that.  Thanks so much for posting it and like the others, I canâ€™t wait to play with it a bit with different herbs and spices.

Fantastic-- the recipe is great as-is (strikingly similar to Boursin cheese), but has so many possibilities for adaptation depending on what you add. The consistency is so much like a soft cream cheese, but without all the fat. I think this will become a staple in my fridge.

I used homemade yogurt to make this recipe. It did take 3 days to mold/set but was well worth the time. I added the salt before molding using 2 ramekins. One cheese had honey and pistachios and the other had some pepper and garlic. The kidlets and I prefer the honey and pistachios. Next time I will make the honey/pistachio mixture and the other one salt, pepper, and fresh herbs (parsley, basil, and chives).

This is easy to make.  However, it is very tangy.  Although we enjoy plain unsweetened yogurt with fruit regularly, we tried putting this yogurt cheese on bread and crackers and did not really like it much.  I did not put garlic in it.  I tried mixing some with some dill weed for crackers, did not care for it.  Tried mixing it with a bit of honey and spreading on banana bread, also, did not care for it.  It might make a good dip base with some major seasoning and something to balance out the nature sourness of yogurt, which seems to be accentuated with this recipe.  I used homemade nonfat yogurt, which is a staple in our house.

Did not like this at all, found the cheese did not have a good taste at all. Very odd flavor kind of sharp but not in a nice way. Then tried to change it up and added garlic and chives, still no better. Maybe it is just my taste buds but my Mom and hubby wouldn't eat it either. Sorry, I had great hopes for this and was truly disappionted.

So easy to make and so tasty to eat.  Silky texture that spreads easily.  Would be a great addition to dips, soups and stews.
