Note from Author: For added moistness, bake the turkey in a turkey bag, and place it upside down in the pan. Turn over during the last 30 minutes to get that nice brown look!

Super easy and really great flavor!  The turkey stayed moist and had wonderful flavor!  I substituted fresh oregano for the marjoram and mixed the herbs in the olive oil then spread that mixture over the meat under the skin.  I also only used the roasting bag to keep the turkey in (I preped it the day before and stored it in the refrigerator), I covered the turkey with foil for roasting and uncovered it for the last 30 minutes to allow the skin to crisp up.  Awesome, will make again!

Was worried it would be dry with the little amount of lemon juice, but this proved to be a great success. Left the meat with a light, lemony flavor. As I was unsure of how to lift the skin on the turkey, we just put the spices on the skin. Still worked great!

I omitted the marjoram, combined the spices with the oil and rubbed it under the skin as well as over after covering with the lemon juice. I tented the turkey with aluminum foil because I didn't have a bag. The only change I made was to pour chicken stock in the bottom of the pan. Very moist with wonderful flavor.

A perfect change of pace!  The only change I made was to mix the oil with the herbs before spreading.  The citrus added a brightness without being overwhelming.  Cooked up lovely in my Nu-Wave oven.  Thank you so much.  :)

The lemon flavor went missing.  I was really surprised.  Overall it was still turkey and delicious.
