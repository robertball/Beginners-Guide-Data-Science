This is good, but it's so much work.  I've resorted to using flour tortillas.  I cut them in strips about 2" x 3", and deep fry them until they're golden, turning once.  Then I immediately dip them in cinnamon and sugar.  Perfect and much easier, but this recipe is still good.

I followed the receipe exactly. The dough turned out like yogurt and the texture of the dough did not help to make the small round balls. I did however, add two more cups of flour to the dough and then it seemed to be just right. Additionally, the receipe does not explain how to rollout the individual balls which should be almost paper thin - it would be helpful to know this. The thinner the rolled out dough is the better it is for frying. Also the deeper the fryer the better the bunuelos turn out. If you do not use a deep fryer the edges will brown slighter darker than the rest of the cookie which does not look good for presentation.

Bu~nuelos are not "cookies" as defined by American culture - that was only a literal translation of what they are referred to in Mexico. They are more like fritters. It should be noted that this recipe is a short cut of the authentic bu~nuelo, so if this is to much work, you can only imagine the real thing. To get a more authentic result with this recipe, roll out the dough as thin as possible while still maintaining enough workability to handle the dough without tearing/puncturing it.  Also you can either incorporate a hint to anise to the dough itself or you can substitute the sugar/cinnamon topping for a melted anise and piloncillo (block of unrefined brown sugar)syrup.

This is an awesome recipe. My mom used to make these but instead of cinammon she added anise. Tasted super. This is as close a recipe to my mom's that I have ever encountered. You go girl!!!!

I followed this recipe exactly, but I used only two eggs instead of four. It came out perfect. They tasted just like my abuela used to make them. I will definately use this recipe again.

I was expecting the crispy light buneulos I was raised on.  these were soft and a bit bland, more like a sopapilla. Not a bad recipe, but not a bunuelo.

I was expecting something sweeter, since the description calls these "cookies".  I also thought they tasted too "eggy". We dipped them in honey or maple syrup, and that helped some. They weren't awful...just not very good.

I should not have spent time on trying this recipe after I read the ones below but I gave it the benefit of the doubt. It never became a dough, it was more sticky and gooey and stuck to my fingers and would never roll out. Spent too much time trying to fix it by adding more flour. Had to go and find someone else recipe.

Bunuelos were very easy make and they tasted like donuts. However, they weren't as sweet as I'd anticipated and I had to altar the recipe a little bit.

I remember white table cloths everywhere with bunuelos drying and then ready to fry. The cinnamon and sugar aroma in the air.  Biting into a thin crisp bunuelo every New Year what a treat.  My mom's were the best and your recipe is it....She always made from scratch and I am pleased to now have the recipe.

This recipe was to difficult to make. I wasted so much time trying to get the dough to turn out correctly and it still didn't turn out. I wasted time and money.

I followed the recipe and the dough was runny, almost like waffle batter. I thought maybe if I kneaded it, it would thicken up? No, it became a gooey mess on my hands. I had to throw the whole thing out! I am STILL fuming over my wasted morning, while I spent precious time trying to fix this bad recipe.

Try 2 eggs, and you can also use powdered sugar as a topping which is very good careful- the oil can spit, I know have two lovely burns on my arm and foot. I don't even know how the oil got on my foot.

Instead of making small balls of dough and then rolling each out, we rolled out the dough and cut rounds, like a biscuit.  It saved a bit of time.

Not the best. Should have known when I saw "cookie." Buñuelo is a fritter. I was looking for a dough recipe that calls for flour, eggs, strong cinnamon tea and yes, lard, Ingredients I recall, not proportions. Thought I'd try something different, but not what I wanted.
