I couldn't bring myself to do both chocolate flavored syrup and condensed milk so, of course, I changed it. I used a 12 oz. bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, the can of EAGLE BRAND condensed milk and vanilla extract but I also added about 1/4 cup whipping cream (had it in the fridge). It was perfect. Coated the dessert bites perfectly, was smooth and creamy, not too sugary so adults would eat it too. In the words of another cook, I give my recipe 5 stars. Since I didn't really do this one letter for letter, I can't really rate it.  PS For just adults, I would have added some cognac or orange-flavored liqueur.

I'm sorry, but I really did not like this recipe. It is so sweet that it hurts the back of your throat. I can't imagine dipping sweet things into it. It is easy to make, but I tend to prefer traditional chocolate fondue which would be well worth the extra effort.

This was so so good! Nothing needs to be changed. I did add very thinly chopped pecans and that was very good.

Took this too my bookclub and it was a huge success!  I added only half of the hershey syrup and a handfull of semisweet chocolate chips.  Amazing would definately make again.  Only problem I had was that it got super thick.

I thought this recipe was really good although it never really thickened for me I added some marshmellows to try to thicken it up but it didn't quite work. I kept the leftovers in the fridge and dipped fruit in it and the consistency was perfect cold. Very rich and delicious!

An easy chocolate fondue!  I added a handful of mini marshmallows and included graham crackers with the dippers for an instant "s'mores" fondue.

I substitute a 12 oz bag of Ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate chips for the chocolate syrup and keep everything else the same and it just comes out divine.  The quality of the chocolate really makes this recipe.

For being so easy, this is suprisingly good. I did stir in about 1/4 cup of chunky peanut butter which was really good.  My family loved it w/ strawberries, bananas and pound cake!

This was perfect for our chocolate fondue fountain!  I've used other recipes from this site, but this was by far easier, less expensive, and just as delicious. My husband also loved that the fountain was very easy to clean when we were finished. :)

This was a pretty simple fix for my family. I used light chocolate syrup and fat free Eagle milk, and it was still very good. It just never thickened as much as I would have liked. I used Mexican vanilla, which made it even better.

I was very impressed with this recipe.  I did the microwave option as I was in a hurry.  This is an excellent alternative if you do not have a fondue pot.  This was perfect for me and my sweetie for Valentine's dessert.  We had pound cake, kiwi, strawberries, bananas, raspberries and pineapple.  It was very delicious and VERY simple to make!

Super easy, makes for a smooth fondue with nice flavor.  Your could easily add flavored liquers to change things up a bit.  Raspberry, anyone?  Thick and a bit sticky if you refrigerate leftovers, but microwaved is still okay.  Fresh out of the pan is best.

I have made this for 3 fondue parties so far.  It's delicious and so much less hassle than melting fondue chocolate!
