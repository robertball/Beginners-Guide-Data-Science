Excellent.  I cut back on the sugar and added a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.

I made this with some fresh figs that I got in my Bountiful Basket.  It was the first time I have ever had fresh fig and we LOVED it!  I didn't have any good buttery crackers, so we ended up putting it over vanilla ice cream and it was so good.  I only had a few figs so had to halve the recipe.  I will definitely make this again (when I can get some fresh figs)!

Really good! I made the compote the day before and refrigerated it, then when I was ready to use it I poured it over the cream cheese. This would also be great over vanilla ice cream. The figs I had weren't the best, but this recipe made them yummy. I think the brown sugar could even be reduced a bit w/o compromising the flavor. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made this per recipe, AWESOME! Very sweet, I served mine over toasted cream cheese and toasted goat cheese. I REALLY liked it over the goat cheese- the sweet figs over the savory goat cheese was amazing on a thin & crispy rosemary cracker. This is my new favorite fig recipe!!!!

Too much sugar, imho. Maybe cut sugar in half. Figs are naturally sweet. I would use less water, too. I like that the recipe was purist: no added citrus, nor liqueur.

Loved this, delicious!  Followed to a T.  Added 1 T of Fig preserves that I had on hand.  I only did this as not all of my figs were quite 100% ripe, and thought this might help.  It was absolutely delicious.  

Wonderful on ice cream..
