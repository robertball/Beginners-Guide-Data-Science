I wondered how these ingredients could come together and bake without leaving a runny mess on the pan and undercooked mushrooms.  

Thanks for the idea to precook the mushrooms. I'll be able to use some of my special but problematic fillings in mushrooms now.

5 stars plus!  This is my new go to appetizer. So simple, yet looks fancy.  Lots of rave reviews on this one.

Very easy and delicious.  I had extra cheese mixture left over so I halved some jalapenos, filled them, and baked them for about 20 minutes at 400.  They were really good.  I would definitely use this mixture for the jalapenos again.

I have been looking and waiting for a recipe for mushrooms that didn't contain bread crumbs or require me to chop up and cook the stems etc. that actually tasted good to boot. Found it!  These were great and so quick and easy. I did not find the need to pre-cook them though (which eliminated the oil). I put them in at 415 for 15 mins - they were perfect! Guests LOVED them!

Wicked tasty...but next time I would change the ratio of cheeses so there is more Boursin than cream cheese.  Instead of dipping the 'shrooms in oil, I sprayed them with oil and it worked out great!  The Parmesan didn't stick too well when sprinkled on at the end so I gently pressed it in.  Made waaaay more filling than needed, but the recipe didn't specify which type of mushrooms to use and I had used baby bellas.  Will try again for sure!

I used shredded asiago cheese instead of parm cheese and these were such a big hit! I also had some of the cheese mixture left over and I used 22 medium-large sized mushrooms.  It's safe to say this recipe can yield more than 20 mushrooms.  Excellent and I will make this again.
