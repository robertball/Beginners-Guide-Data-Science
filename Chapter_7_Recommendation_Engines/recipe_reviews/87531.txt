Not so good.  It sounded wonderful, but I was disappointed with the results.  I took the other reviewers' suggestions and made my favorite mac and cheese for the bottom.  The envelope mix/sloppy joe topping was horrible.  I had to doctor it up considerably to make it edible!  I think if I made this using my favorite mac and cheese plus my own sloppy joe recipe this might be better, but I advise against the envelope sloppy joe mix....

Made this dish for a serving of 12. Came out pretty good, not a very aasthetic within this recipe. Looks more like dogfood. But the taste is great. A few changes... the mac and cheese part was good, i thought, but a few other people didn't care to much for it. read the other reviews and I suggest use your own recipe. 2/ i would make more sloppy joe than mac and cheese. We made too much pasta and craved more joes, but oh well. This recipe might also work with chili...

Pretty darn good! Next time I think I'll try it with canned Manwich and my own Mac and cheese recipe (which isn't quite as fattening as the one in this recipe!)  A very good meal...good combination. Hubby and I had our doubts prior to tasting it, but we were pleasantly surprised!:-) Ally

I make my sloppy joe's with Manwich and I tried this recipe and something about the mac & cheese recipe, the taste just didn't please me so I'm going to try it again with Velveeta Shells & Cheese, TBC....

I GIVE THIS A 5 STAR. I MADE IT PRETTY MUCH TO THE RECIPE EXCEPT I ADDED MORE SPICES,FRESH GREEN PEPPERS AND FRESH TOMAOTES IN MY HAMBURGER MIX. I ALSO ADDED A LITTLE SPLENDA (SUGAR IF YOU ARE NOT DIABETIC) AND THAT TOPPED IT OFF. I LIKE THINGS WITH TASTE AND NOT BLAND SO THE EXTRA SPICES WILL DO THE TRICK FOR THIS DISH. (PARSLEY, SEASONING SALT, A "LITTLE" CAJUN SEASONING. AND FOR THOSE WHO DID FIND THE MAC MIXTURE A LITTLE DRY ADD A EXTRA 1/2 CUP OF HALF AND HALF AND 1/2 CUP BUTTER VERSUS THE 1/4 CUP. ALSO, DON'T SCIMP ON THE CHEESE. ADD A LITTLE MORE AND BE DARING.  I USED MOZARELLA AND CHEDDAR. I MUST SAY WE LOVED IT!

My husband and I loved this casserole.  I had a small can of Manwich, so I substituted the taco seasoning and tomato paste with it.  I still used the diced tomatoes though.  I also used half cheddar and half Coby Jack cheese, milk instead of half/half.

Excellent flavor.  This is a keeper for us.  Thanks!

Pretty good recipe here!  I liked the combination of the two flavors.  The leftovers, however, are not nearly as good; best to eat this one right away.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband really liked this a lot but my daughter and I found the mac and cheese part to be pretty dry and not very cheesy tasting.  Surprising since there is so much cheese in the recipe.  Perhaps the 1/2 and 1/2 is overwhelming the cheese flavor a bit.  I think this recipe has great potential, however, and may make it again just using my own mac and cheese recipe and top it with the sloppy joe topping from this recipe.

This was a simple and fun recipe that is so kid friendly; absolutely perfect for all you moms out there with little ones. Paired with a salad, even the adults will have nothing to squawk about. Whenever I make "sloppies" I just use the Manwich sauce in the can rather than the tomatoes and seasonings, so that's what I did for this recipe too. Everyone loved the marriage of two of their favorite dishes in one casserole. Thanks so much Renee!

I simplified this recipe as a time saver.  I made the mac and cheese part as it read, but rather than make the sloppy-joe portion, I just used two cans of bean-less chili.  Yum YUM!  Very heavy dish though.  I would say it will feed more like 10-12 if served with a side dish and bread!  I used two 8X8 pans and gave one to a friend that just had a baby.  I think this would freeze well as well!

I tried this recipie the other night, with the only change being i had to make sloppy joe sauce from scratch, and I added about a pack of ritz crackers between the noodle layer and the meat layer. This is AWESOME! I got great reviews from DH and DS and I would def make it again! Great quick and easy kid friendly food.

Loved this recipe.  I think next time I might try to make a variation & try without the sloppy joe seasoning and just use the tomato sauce mixture, or maybe leave out the tomato sauce mixture and just add the cheese to the top.  This was a very good recipe & the family loved it.

This was a fun idea! We ended up using mostly sharp cheddar with some pepper jack cheese for the cheese sauce and we topped with mozzarella, just because that is what we had. The diced tomatoes added the perfect sweetness. The McCormick Sloppy Joe mix tasted fine to us. Thanks for the fun recipe!

I thought this was great!  I cut the mac and cheese ingredients in half so that there was more meat than pasta.  Really easy too!

This looks great but before I make it I was wanting to know if anyone had tips on converting it by using the canned Manwich instead of the packaged envelope of Manwich? I am wondering if the canned diced tomatoes and tomato paste should be omitted? Any suggests or thoughts on this would be appreciated. Thanks

My husband said he thought this was really good.  I did however make a few changes.  I used 2 pints of home canned tomatoes. this resulting in a more soupy casserole, but ended up perfect.  I also used speghetti mix instead of sloppy joe mix and I thought it was even better!

This is a big hit with the family! I use McCormick sloppy joe mix, and also add half of a green pepper, and half of a red pepper, with a medium onion (all diced very small) in with the meat while it cooks, then adding the tomatoes & paste to complete the sloppy joe mix. Some reviews state they would prefer to try using canned Manwich to save on time, but I do recommend using the homemade version with the sloppy joe mix packet because of the consistency you get vs. using a canned sauce. Either way would work though. If you prefer to make a homemade version that the recipe calls for, McCormick Sloppy Joe mix comes out seriously close to the flavor you get with Manwich! I prefer the homemade version because it’s saucey, but not overly saucey, which works better with this recipe when layering it. The cheese sauce you make & added shredded cheese to mix with the macaroni, is absolutely awesome and makes for a very homemade taste, and is NOT dry at all. I do not sauté onions in the pan with butter as noted, because I do that beforehand with the meat. I do put butter in the pan, melt it and then add the half & half, flour & spices as instructed, etc. Be warned, the mac & cheese part of this recipe makes a ton! I cut back to about 10-12 ounces of pasta, and I layer the sloppy joe and the macaroni twice when I use a big enough casserole dish. If you're looking for a heartier meat mix to this dish, I do recommend doubling the sloppy joe, and cutting back on the mac & cheese!

I made it exactly as it was since this was my first time using this recipe.  I love it and I'd definitely make it again.  I bring my lunch every day so on Sundays I like to make something that will be filling and last through the week.  I added some steamed broccoli on the side. . .Viola!

This dish is awesome!  It's delicious.  It took longer to prep than I expected; however, the outcome was worth it.  My family thoroughly enjoyed it.

I was nervous about this one because of all the negative reviews. But I used taco seasoning in the beef and then I just added garlic with the onions. So it was more like a taco Mac and cheese dish!

This was easy to put together, although it dirtied several pans. I halved the macaroni & sauce, as per other suggestions, and used gluten free noodles. I did use the packaged sloppy joe mix and had to add 1 tsp of chili powder and about 3 tbsp of brown sugar to make it sweeter and a bit spicier so, I'll probably just make my own next time. The kids are loving it, though, so it's a keeper recipe!
