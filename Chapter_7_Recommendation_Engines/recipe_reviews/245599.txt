I had to make this after seeing the review saying this recipe made her look bad. Lol. Meltdown much? Anyways, this recipe is perfection. Done exactly as written, I found this one of the best cookies I've ever had. The recipe clearly states walnut size balls which is very small. This made 24 perfect lemony cookies for me. 5 stars and will definitely make again.

Terrible recipe the batter ends up really sticky and I wasted two batches due to them burning because I followed the recipe exactly. I do not appreciate a recipe that makes me look bad, I will never use this recipe and I highly recommend that you donâ€™t try to make them. I had to add more flour to get only 12 cookies do to this horrible recipe

My cookies didn't spread at all. I followed the recipe to the letter. I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

Loved the recipe, I added lemon zest as I really like the lemon taste  These cookies really spread I used my smallest scoop but the next time I will only use 3/4 of a scoop.

Nice tasting cookie and I followed all the directions but they mostly melded into one whilst baking.
