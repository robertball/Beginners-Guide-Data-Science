Such an outstanding recipe. I have made it 4 times, each time tweaking the recipe a little more. It's equally delicious with whole wheat flour, and I add a tablespoon of vanilla. I use brown sugar instead of white, and 3/4 cup is enough (for 10 servings). I always use fresh fruit instead of frozen. In my oven, it always takes at least an hour and a half to cook, and it's a very moist bread. So far, I've made strawberry raspberry, strawberry cranberry, and strawberry kiwi versions of the recipe, and they have all turned out very well.

My husband and I both loved this bread!  It is moist and fruity, and a good change of pace from the run of the mill banana bread.  I smushed the strawberries up with my hands before adding them as someone suggested and I think that definitely helped disperse them.

I halved this recipe, and made it healtier. I used 3/4 cup sugar (instead of 1 cup), half whole wheat and half all-purpose flour (instead of all all-purpose), 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 oil (instead of all oil). Not overly sweet.

Absolutely Wonderful!!!!  Everytime I make it someone asks for the recipe.  I recommend cutting up the strawberries so the loaf will hold together better!  Best strawberry bread I have ever tasted

I cut this in half. I had three different kinds of berries (blueberries, strawberries and cranberries) in little amounts so I combined them all to make 10 oz. together. I had to add about 1/4 c. of milk to get it to come together. EDITED: This does not half well. At least for me it didn't. I will try this again when I can make the whole batch. Halving it was just a waste for me.

I love this bread.  I always have strawberrys around the house for the kids and this is a great breakfast bread!! I coat my pans with a little sugar before pouring the mixture in the prepared pan and when it comes out in makes a little crust on top of the bread.

I made this recipe for a few friends, and I loved it.  Some of them didn't like it . . . probably because they couldn't figure out what fruit it was.  I personally loved it and will definitely make it again!  It has a nice subtle flavor, and it was nice and moist.

! mine baked for over 2 hours and STILL came out like jello in the middle. i dont know if i should have omitted the strawberry juices or if there just wasnt enough flour. this smelled wonderful baking, but i was so very disappointed in the outcome. i will not be making it again.

I made one loaf and a dozen muffins. My husband, who generally is not a fan of sweet breads, loved it, and so did my grandchildren. The only change I made was to add a splash of vanilla (didn't measure) and a cup of chopped pecans. I'm going to try it with pears next time. Thanks for posting!

Wonderful!  I did add wheat germ and flax seed, used convection heat for about 45 minutes.  Also egg-replacer eggs worked great. I only did one loaf.  That was my worst mistake.  My picky kids wanted more!  We all loved it.  I'm making 2 loaves tomorrow! Thank you!

Twenty-two years ago I typed out a recipe for strawberry bread that I never used.  Today I had 16 ounces of fresh strawberries I feared wouldn't last much longer.  I decided it was finally time to give the recipe a whirl.  (What can I say?  I'm not the fastest draw in the land.) When I mixed it up it looked too heavy to me AND my twenty-two-year-old recipe mentioned mixing in cinnamon, which was not listed in the ingredients.  Fortunately, I came across this recipe.  It's exactly the same, except the recipe I was using called for 3 eggs, versus 4 here.  Since I had already mixed my bread, I thought it too late to add another egg, so left that alone.  Not only did this recipe tell me how much cinnamon to use and that the consistency of what I had mixed was right, but from the comments I was able to deduce that I needed to add a bit (1/3 C) of applesauce to make up for the fact that my fresh berries weren't as juicy as thawed frozen would be, and that 1 teaspoon of vanilla was also in order.   By the end of my venture 22 years in the making, I turned out 4 beautiful mini-loaves (45 minute bake time) that my teens were just loving when they came home from school!  Thank you so much!

Turned out great as written. I had to measure my strawberries out, so it might have been a different amount, but turned out great! The whole family loved it. I was worried about the extra liquid from the unfrozen strawberries, but it turned out just fine. I also added less sugar than called for, but I'm sure it would have been great with the full amount too.

Fantastic recipe!!!! I only baked one loaf so halved all the ingredients. I put a lot less sugar, had a few fresh strawberries which were a bit "tired" and used those instead of frozen and I added walnut!!!! It's been out of the oven 2 minutes and I had 2 slices already!

Have made the Strawberry Loaf 6 times now & feel that I can now review it.  It's a great recipe.  I have always halved the ingredients to only make one loaf.  I've only ever used fresh strawberries cut up small. The only change other than using frozen fruit is - I use 1/2 cup veg oil & 1/3 cup milk to reduce the oil needed. My kids love a change from the usual banana loaf I make.

I can't believe I'm giving such a low rating, but this was really bad. The only thing I did in addition to following the recipe exactly as written was add 1 Tbs vanilla and mashed the strawberries to help disperse (both based on review suggestions). After cooking for over 2 hours! the bread still was so moist it didn't taste done. YIf I made it again, I'd use less strawberries, but I'm not sure that would do it. The flavor was subtle and different from banana bread (what the other reviews were comparing it to), but it wasn't great. I could find a better use for my frozen strawberries.

I made muffins with this recipe and used applesauce instead of oil as I often do when baking. Unfortunately, the muffins were gooey and had much too strong a nutmeg flavor for our family.

Yummy, and easy.  I used all whole wheat flour, mashed the strawberries as others suggested, used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar.  Very easy to make and tastes great.  I'll be making it again for sure!

Very, very moist!  I used more than 10 oz of frozen strawberries (fresh home-frozen strawberries) that I chopped up, and I put in a third of the oil.  Still very moist and tasty.  I also halved the sugar and used splenda.  Kinda reminded me of carrot cake but with strawberries instead... wouldn't really consider it a "loaf," which implies bread to me.  Just cake baked in a loaf pan!

Banana bread is not one of my husbands favorites, so trying to find some kind of loaf to include in his lunch can be challenging - of all I've tried this recipe is now the most requested by far.  The only changes I made were adding vanilla and, as I found the amount of oil to be a lot, I substituted 3/4 cup of applesauce and used only 1/2 cup of the oil.  I did not have issues with the bread falling apart at all - it must be because I did not use whole strawberries as suggested by other reviews.

yummy, but the strawberries made the whole thing fall apart!  I cut them up, but still they became very soggy as they cooked and made a mess of the bread.  So it tastes good, but dont make it if you want to make a nice presentation.

I've used this recipe several times and it always comes out tasting good. This time it turned out to moist but that could be my fault I may have added more strawberries  than the recipe stated. The taste was really good.

I revised the recipe a bit with the rest of the reviews. I used 1c veg oil 1 1/2 c white sugar.. 3 c fresh strawberries, I tried pounding it with meat tenderizer so some strawberries would be visible after it's baked. I put 1/2 c white sugar on the strawberry mixture with 1 1/2t of g.cinnamon. I let it sit for few minutes while prepping the rest of the ingredients. I put 2t pure vanilla and 1 1/2c chopped pecans. Topped it with 1/2 c chopped pecans. Made 2 perfectly looking loaves with perfect texture that I was imagining! Definitely would be making this again. It's a keeper!

I used some applesauce to offset some of the oil.  Very moist and delicious!  The color of my cake, however, was much different than the picture (mine was more purple/grey) - not quite as appetizing to the eyes.

Great! I will definitely make this again. Used applesauce to replace oil and soy flour to replace eggs. I used 1 package of frozen strawberries because it's all I had. Tuned out great! 

Will try again with other berries.

I'm eating this now, right out of the oven!  It's delicious, perfectly sweet, and moist.  I followed the suggestions of another poster and used 1 cup oil, 1 cup sugar and 1 cup of applesauce.

I make a lot of breads, and this one is one of the best!!! After initially making it as written (I don't believe in changing a recipe until after the first time I make it), I used 1/2 white and 1/3 brown sugar. The difference is subtle but gives a deeper flavor. Also, I used about 2c. fresh strawberries, sugared them a tad and let them juice overnight before adding them to the batter. Lastly, I subbed  1/2 cup of applesauce for the total amount of oil. Got one 9" x 5" loaf and three minis. Best to take to work and treat the co-workers! Thanks!!!!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. I was expecting a loaf consistency (firm, dense, moist), but instead this was more cake-like. It was very moist, however. I used fresh strawberries, and eyeballed the amount (I'm sure that I used more than I was supposed to). For me, the recipe made 4 loaves, not 2. It was a nice way to use up some extra strawberries, but I don't think that I'll make it again.

This in my opinion is really a cake.  I cooked it in a casserole dish.  I also took review advice and added 1T. of vanilla and substituded the sugar for brown sugar.  I also think next time I will add more strawberries.  It was excellent.  I will definitly make it again.

I was really surprised by how good this was... I taste-tested the batter and thought the cinnamon was a bit overwhelming, but the strawberry flavor really came out during baking. I'll be making these as holiday gifts, thanks!

I had a lot of extra strawberries so I was looking for something to do with them.  This bread was okay but it wasn't phenomenal.  I felt like it was missing something.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and more strawberries...but I felt like it needed more doctoring.

Great dish, loved it!     Pay attention to recipe, this is a double loaf dish!  Makes quite a bit of food.

Delicious recipe!  Even my 3 year old son enjoyed it!  I used 1 lb. or 1 carton of fresh strawberries from the grocery.  I chopped the strawberries up in my food processor and halved the recipe for only one loaf pan.  It was perfect.

If I didn't know that I added strawberries, I wouldn't have ever guessed that they were in there.  I've never had great success making breads and this was no exception.
