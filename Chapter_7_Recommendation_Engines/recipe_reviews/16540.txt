Great salad! I cut back on the number of servings and added a bit of garlic and dijon mustard to the dressing. I added sliced some thin sliced red onion and some leftover citrus grilled chicken. This was very light and perfect for a quick lunch!

This was a great basic recipe that is so refreshing with any meal or as a meal itself. WARNING: Dressing needs some help. I made my own little changes to the dressing. I used raspberry vinegar instead of red wine. I also added 2 tablespoons of orange marmalade, 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch to thicken and sweeten it up a bit. YUM YUM YUM!! My whole family now begs me to make this salad. (The dressing is great on a garden salad topped with a citrus chicken breast!!)

Wonderful fresh salad for summer!!  Loved the dressing.  I used baby spinach instead of romaine, it was still wonderful!

This salad was easy to make, and tasted ok.  I too added orange zest to it, I also added some chopped mint leaves, which helped.  The dressing was a bit lackluster, it needs something to help it cling a bit more, next time, I will up the oil and reduce the OJ.  .

I served this salad for the first time on New Years Eve.  We had a Progressive dinner party with three other couples.  We did the soup and salad course.  I served this with homemade Cream Of Mushroom Soup.  They were very good together.

I loved this salad!  The flavor of the dressing was very subtle, but perfectly suited for the salad.  It's a nice break from regular salad.  My husband and son didn't like it so much -- but I think they like their standard-tasting salad.  This is for the more adventurous and someone who is looking for a change.  I was pleasantly surprised about how the flavors went together.  Thanks for the recipe!

this was a good salad with a light, refreshing flavor. very easy to put together. i used rasberry vinegar bc i had it on hand and read some of the reviews saying the dressing was a bit bland...it made for a nice flavor. i also diced some red onion very fine and added that to the dressing. also, i toasted the slivered almonds before adding to the salad. overall was delicious. i will make this again.

Served this with the "Caribbean Pasta with Shrimp" from this site and it was a great combo! The salad served as a bit of a palette cooler in between bites of the spicy pasta dish. Will make this again for sure!

I added a bit of orange zest to the dressing for just a tad more flavor.  So simple!  So good!  It will be going to our family pot-luck dinner where I expect it will receive alot of rave reviews.  Jeanie Bean

I served this salad with a heavy burrito casserole and it was a great accompaniment because it was so light and fresh.  Our company loved it and asked for the recipe!  We decided it would be wonderful with a nice piece of grilled meat, a little bread, a nice light wine....delicious.

Really not good.  Waaaay too much oil, too much pepper, not enough sweetness.  I will try another recipe, because I like the concept of the salad - just not the dressing from this recipe.

Great summer salad.  We did add a tablespoon of sugar to the dressing, as suggested by another review and also crumbled feta cheese.  Toasting the almonds is a must!

I made the dressing exactly how the recipe says too, but found the flavor to be much to vinegary. Let's say way too vinegary.  Bc of that, I tweaked the recipe by adding about a tablespoon of sugar and half the juice from the mandarin orange can.  With that change it was much sweeter, yet still a vinaigrette! Yum yum!  My husband liked it with grilled, sliced chicken over his and said he'd definitely eat it again.  Maybe next time more fruit--strawberries? Blueberries? Pineapple? Might give it that extra punch it needs

I use the juice from the canned oranges and  a bit of sugar. Rice wine vinegar works really well and sliced green onions add some zip. This salad is not good if it sits around long, dress it and get it to the table!

Light, refreshing, not a heavy dressing. Doesn't stick to the lettuce but that's ok. I think it's perfect with a heavy meal because of the lightness. We had beef stew and I served this and thought it balanced nicely with the stew. I also did not think it was too tart. I guess if one wanted to thicken it up a bit, that would help it cling better but I really don't think I would. Salad needs to be eaten soon after the dressing is poured over the salad and toss quickly and serve.

Great salad -- light and refreshing tho I only used about 1/4 of the dressing.  Was a big hit for Thanksgiving.  I added 1 can of hearts of palm which was a nice compliment.   Also used mandarin oranges packed in water.    I think a good add would be some herb to give the dressing a bit more kick, but don't know what that would be.

The dressing was good but came out a little thin. I had a hard time getting it to stick to the lettuce. I also like a little more bite so added more red wine vinegar. Overall a good recipe though.

Yum-E!  I threw in some left over grilled salmon and some thinly sliced onion and celery and it was a meal for my husband & me.  Think I'll try to use less water when I reconstitute my orange juice to punch up the orange flavor a little & maybe add a tad more vinegar because I like the "sour."  Agree, it is a little watery and wouldn't keep.

Tried by recipe, not that good: added more vinegar and sugar, skinned segments of 2 navel oranges and zest from one orange and it helped. Later tried sugar coating the almonds..still, just ok.

This salad is much like another salad here called 3 step salad. It was really good but I did like the other best. Either would do you proud served to casual or formal guests. 
I wanted the crunch of celery and carmelized almonds from the other recipe so I added those. This dressing is sweet and good. It would benefit from a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken a bit. This is definately a dressing I would make again to be able to switch between sweet and tangy of the other recipe.

Decent, easy, and healthy, though somewhat boring.  Added feta which rounded out the flavor and gave it a little more interest.  Would make again if I needed to do something fast.

I added a touch more olive oil and reduced the orange juice a bit as one of the reviews suggested.  The salad was fabulous!  Very light and simple to make.  It was an excellent weekend lunch!

Very refreshing.  I used a bag of romaine salad mix with mine.  Could get away with just two cans of mandarin oranges though.  Very soggy the next day so eat it all up the first day.

DH said it tasted light and fresh.  I did add mint and honey to the dressing as it was a bit bland without the addition.  Next time I think I will add green onion.  Will make this again.

Maybe because I used mandarin orange segments, it was a little bland.  I might try real orange next time

This is an absolutely amazing salad! Full of flavor and crunch. Easy to put together (make the dressing ahead of time, store in fridge, and add just before serving) Enjoyed by all of my guests and will be enjoyed many times to come.

I love how basic this recipe is and yet is still fantastic!  It seems to go with anything.  I saved the leftover dressing and made up salad combinations for days using leftover ingredients in the fridge.  It was great!

Very nice. I did not have Mandarin oranges but i subbed 1 navel orange and cut it into small pieces. I also used balsamic instead of red wine only because the other two dishes (kabobs and pasta salad) I was making with this had a base of red wine vinegar. Also added in red peppers for a little more color. The dressing was really good, everyone enjoyed this salad (no leftovers)!! I would suggest adding in the dressing right before serving, to keep the salad crisp.

I added 1 tablespoon sugar to the dressing to sweeten it a little.  I served it with cornish game hens.  Very good.

Got compliments on the almonds.  I cut back by half the amount of mandarin oranges.  This would make a nice lunch salad if you added chicken.  Delicious salad, thanks for sharing!
