The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 star is because I made so many changes...First of all, I always use a 5-6 lb bird to feed my family. Then I have enough left over for soup or sandwiches. I added minced onion and garlic to the rub and used sage as a substitue for savory (which I never have) and doubled the amount of everything- stuffed under the skin. I squeezed juice from the orange over the bird and drizzled it with olive oil just before roasting- adding red potatoes to the dish. I preheated my oven to 450 degrees and roasted it for about 20 minutes to get that golden crispy skin and smokey flavor.  Then I reduced the temp down to 375 degrees for the remainder of cooking time.  Allowed it to rest for 15 minutes upside down (breast down) to let the juices run to the good meat.  SO WORTH IT!  Moistest, most flavorful chicken you will ever taste.  My Family loved it!

I've roasted more whole chickens in the past 12 months than I can possibly remember - all different recipes, all taste the same.  This was the first that tasted different and wasn't just the same boring chicken.

I followed the recipe with the exception of doubling the orange zest, adding half to the rub and reserving the other half to go on top of the chicken as it cooked - along with a little sea salt.

Excellent results!  I do agree with another post, lifting the skin and applying the spices between the skin and meat made a huge difference.

Great! My fiance actually got up to get seconds! 
I did change a few things though, one was instead of canola I used olive oil on the bird. I also used more oil than the recipe called for and was rewarded with all over brown crispy skin!
I also threw some seasoning inside the chicken and into cuts I made in the skin of the drumsticks to try to get some of it all over the chicken.
I also want to add more orange peel next time. There was no "hint of orange" as far as smell or taste in my opinion.

I made this chicken recipe for dinner tonight.  It was the best roast chicken I have ever made in my entire life.  Just wish I had had some film for my camera so I could have taken a picture of it.  That is how good it looked and tasted.

Great recipe for "Savory" roasted chicken.  I did up the orange a bit and used olive oil vs. canola. I also cut up an orange and placed that into the cavity.  There's nothing like the smell of a roast chicken and the taste was just as wonderful!

Great Recipe - but I made a few changes. I ended up mixing onion salt, sage, thyme, and rosemary, along with minced onion and minced garlic (like a previous reviewer suggested) with the pepper and oil to make the rub. I also put a pierced lemon into the cavity - I didn't notice a taste change, but my understanding is that it's more for a moisture thing. The chicken was FANTASTIC, although took a LONG time to cook (Might have had something to do with not fully thawing the chicken....... woops..) and my parents LOVED it and went back for seconds (Have I surpassed my mother in the cooking section... My Dad seems to think so! *LOL*)

This was amazing! You really need to make sure you do the rub under the skin, it really intensifies the flavors. The only thing I changed was I put some chicken broth inside the body cavity and at the bottom of the dish. Served with mashed potatoes, gravy made from the chicken, and wild rice.

Very moist and full of flavor. I roasted a 4 1/2# chicken and it was done in 1 1/2 hours. I used sage instead of savory (did not have any savory) and doubled the orange zest as some others had recommended. I rubbed a little of the rub inside the chicken, some under the skin and the rest on the outside after oiling with olive oil. Very easy and delicious and a nice change from my usual roast chicken with Cajun seasoning.

I made this last night, and it was finger likin' good. I only made minor changes. I didn't measure the herbs, just sprinkled them on. And instead of canola, I used olive oil. I also put some butter underneath the skin. All in all a great recipe. My husband will definitely be requesting this one again!

This turned out perfectly. I used a bit more oil and orange zest. I roasted 2 chickens, and they did take the full 2 hours... Very, very good. Thanks!

I  added more grated orange peel than the recipe called for (most of the peel from 1 orange) and then I cut the orange into quarters and put it inside the body to help keep it moist and add some flavor / aroma.  I also added 1/2 t corriander to the herb mix.  I baked it uncovered for the last 20 minutes to crisp the skin and it was great!  This one is now in our regular meal rotation. Thanks for a great twist on an old favorite.

This is an awesome recipe as written.  The only change I made is that I cut the orange in half and put it in th cavity of the chicken, and I used another orange and juiced it over the chicken.   So moist and juicy.  Did not have savory, so used sage instead.  Definately a keeper.

I mixed rosemary, savory, thyme, salt and pepper into 3/4 cup of real butter. I rubbed that under the skin and on top of the skin. I put a cut up onion and garlic cloves in the cavity. SOOOO MOIST AND DELICIOUS!!

Wow, WOw, WOW!  This was AMAZING, and soooo beautiful! Use fresh herbs and orange. Huge difference! (just remember to use 3x as much called for) I Used sage, as I didn't have savory. And rubbed triple the olive oil into the skin. Fantastic results, with a flavor that was a little different  than my "same-ole, same-ole." Gonna make this for my mother-in-law when we visit. She can't help but like me now! :D

delicious! I used more orange zest (maybe a little too much) great combination of spices. I used a thermometer/timer but I think it cooked for around 1 1/2 hrs.

Excellent flavor and chicken was so tender and moist.  I'd forgot how delicious a roasted chicken could be.  I used fresh spices and they worked well.

Very good.  Finely minced 1/2 a small onion and a clover of garlic, mixing with 1t kosher salt and other herbs.  Seasoned bird inside and out with this blend and allowed to sit for an hour.  Roasted at 450 for 20 minutes and finished off at 375.

I also subbed sage instead of savory since it was in the cabinet.   Cooking the chicken at 425 for about 20 minutes really helped the crunchiness of the skin. I'd highly recommend it to anyone trying this recipe.

Even with doubling the spices, using olive oil instead of canola, and adding a good shake of garlic powder, I still found this rather bland.

Yummy!  I made few changes...minced onion and garlic, thyme and sage.  I think I would try poultry seasoning next time or fajita seasoning which we love on everything. I used olive oil instead of canola oil and orange slices inside the bird with orange juice squeezed all over the top.  I also precooked it at 425 for 20 minutes and then turned it down to 375 for 90 minutes. Very good. Juicy and tender.

I followed this recipe to the T and after an hour and half of cooking in wasn't even half way done. I had to cook it another 45 minutes at 425.   The flavor was good, but a little bland for our taste buds....

This was a great recipe - quick and easy to prepare.  The orange zest is an important addition but doesn't make the chicken "orange-y"!!  Very moist and flavorful.

This is the best roasted chicken I have ever made!  My husband could not stop eating it.  I used the zest from the whole orange and then cut the orange up and placed it inside the cavity.  I also used rubbed sage instead of savory.  I did not have savory.  I put the herbs under the skin and rubbed olive oil on the skin.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe

My boyfriend and I loved this chicken! I changed it a little bit by stuffing in with some stovetop stuffing mixed with some sauteed onions and celery. Also, I cut up red bliss potatoes and put them around the edges with some oil and spices on them. I loved the orange in this recipie, it added a really different taste and we really enjoyed it.
