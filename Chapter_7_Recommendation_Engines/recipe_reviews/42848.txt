This recipe is absolutely wonderful! I did however make a few changes of my own. I used penne & I only used 3/4 cup of olive oil and added 1 cup of white cooking (or house) wine or else it was too greasy. I also added in the oil from the jar of sun dried tomatoes for extra flavor (it's only about a tblsp full). I also rinsed and reused my pot after making the pasta. Used a little of my 3/4 cup of olive oil to brown my garlic and then added all of my other ingredients. Then added my pasta at the end. I didn't add any chicken this time but usually use shrimp instead. Every time I make this dish, it goes as quick as the wind! My fianc'e loves Macaroni Grill and they have something similar which led me to try to somewhat duplicate it. It does take some time to prep and can be a bit pricey to make but it is very well worth the time and money!! =)

This was very good.  I didn't add all the oil that was called for because it seemed like a lot.  But that ended up being a mistake cause it was a bit dry.

Hmmm...I thought this sounded great, but it was really lacking flavor.  I used only 1/4 cup of oil and it was still way to greasy.  The combination sounds good so I'll play with it but I think next time I'm going to add more feta (double), even less oil (1/8 cup?) some red pepper, and saute the garlic (4 cloves) before adding it to the mix.  At the suggestion of a friend, I'll try adding some bacon too!

I really Loved this recipe - I'm a big Pesto, Garlic, Sun Dried Tomatoes fan..so any recipe including these instantly grab my attention. 
It was so simple to make, great for a hot night when you really don't feel like 'cooking' - i'll definitely make this again!!

cut way back on the oil as some suggested. Husband thought black olives would have been a good addition.

I would definitely recommend cutting the oil back to about 1/3 cup and subbing in sun-dried tomato pesto for a smoother sauce.

Awesome! I don't like to waste great flavors, oils and make extra dirty dishes if I can avoid it. So, I made made a few minor adjustments that worked great for me. I used about 11 chicken tenderloins and a box of bow tie noodles, since that's what I had on hand. I agreed with other reviewers that this was an oily dish. Since the jar of whole sun dried tomatoes I used had about 3/4 cups to 1 cup oil in it, I only needed the oil from that. My Pesto was oily and you can always add olive oil as needed. Cooking chicken in the sun dried tomato oil gave it a fantastic flavor. I'm a cheese head, so I of course increased the amounts of cheese a little.  I found it easier for me when assembling it to leave the pasta in a strainer while I made the cheese mixture in the same pot I used to the cook noodles in. Added the noodles back into that pot, stirred very well, and started heating the pot. I reheated the cooked sliced chicken in garlic using the same skillet I used to cook the chicken for about 3 minutes. This added a roasted garlic flavor to it and absorbed the left over oils and juices I used to cook the chicken in from the skillet. Then scraped the chicken and garlic into the cheesy noodle mixture and stirred. Awesome!

This is my second review for this wonderful recipe.  I am always looking for ways to reduce the fat content of recipes.  I used NO oil in this recipe and instead of the sundried tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes.  The water from the can ensured the dish was not too dry and it still tasted a treat!  Thanks again Marc.

This dish has so much flavor my husband, who only loves tomato based sauces actually likes it.  It has become a regular on our family meal plan.  As a plus it is very easy to make.  I also variate and make it with sausage sometimes instead of chicken.

This was wonderful! My one complaint is that it was too oily. I reduced the oil and will even more so next time. I used sun dried tomatoes from a package because that's what I had, and they were very good. I also added marinated artichoke hearts. My husband has been begging me to make it ever since. One of our favorites!

Really liked this dish! Would give it 4 1/2 if I could. Simple, but so flavorful! I added extra garlic (because we love it) . I was worried that a whole jar of peppers would be too much, but it wasn't! Will make again for sure!

What a good dish!Took less than 10 minutes to prepare, then about 20 m to cook, and tastes fab. I have followed other reviewers and used 1/4 cup of olive oil, then 3/4 cup of white wine, and I used sausages instead of chicken (personal preference), and also added cherry tomatoes and some red pepper.The dish has a lot of flavours and everything compliments each other. My 2 year old had 2 helpings! Thanks for such a good recipe

Great dish! A little too oily, will have to cut back next time, but otherwise amazing. I used bowtie pasta, and it was a big hit! Love the sundried tomatoes!

Recipe was quick and easy which is a plus on a busy night.  I only used a couple tablespoons of oil and chopped up some leftover grilled chicken.  I also threw in a half a can of artichokes and omitted the tomatoes as I was out.  I added a couple ladlefulls of the pasta water at the end to the mixture and while the pasta drained, threw the mix into my heavy (and still hot) pasta pot helping to reheat the whole mixture and making this a one pot meal.  The family loved it, I felt good about the fat content, would even grate some zucchini in next time.

I liked this one.  I used a jar of tomato pesto sauce and added fresh basil to the chicken.  This was good and my kids liked it as well.  Will make again for a quick and easy meal.

Right... my family liked it and I guess that's what matters.  BUT, it was a bit annoying to prepare.  Why did I have to cook the chicken whole first, then later cut it into pieces?  And the bit about mixing until smooth - it doesn't get smooth, because the cheese can't melt until heated in the pan. Overall: taste is fine, preparation needs to be altered.

Instead of all that oil I used the pasta water.  I sauteed the garlic in some of the sun dried tomato oil.  When the pasta was almost done I scooped out enough to give me the amount of sauciness I wanted.  The pasta water adds more to it than plain water would.  There's enough richness with the feta and ricotta so all that oil is not necessary.

i loved this recipe! I used 1 cup of the pasta water. Chopped sun dried tomatos without oil and  used only about 1/2 a cup of olive oil.  I also added about a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.  this was great-easy and everyone of my kids loved it along with the hubby.  Easy evening dinner made a bit special!

Delicious!!!  My whole family loved this, even my 3 year old son!  It tastes a lot like Penne Mediterranean from Bravo!  I added some sauteed spinach and pine nuts to make it taste much like that dish.  I also made a few changes... I used whole wheat penne pasta instead of fettuccini, and I added a few drops of olive oil to the boiling water to keep the noodles from sticking together.  I did not add the one cup of olive oil as others suggested, but added the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes instead.  I used light ricotta cheese.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

My husband totally loved this.  It is very very very rich.  We loved the sundried tomatoes..but may I suggest serving a big healthy salad on the side.  I don't think I changed a thing (for once!)

I saw this recipe and immediately liked all the ingredients and thought they would be delicious combined...but with a whopping 1000+ calories and 78 grams of fat, I wanted to find a way of reducing both of these.  I was successful, so here is what I did.  
I used 3 Tbsp of olive oil in the cheese sauce mixture (instead of 1 cup).  I diced my raw chicken and cooked it in a non-stick skillet with about 2 tsp of olive oil.  I used dried sun-dried tomatoes (instead of those packed in olive oil which contain CONSIDERABLE more fat and calories).  If you use dried, be sure to blanch them in boiling water for 2-3 minutes first to soften them up.  I used 'light' ricotta and feta cheeses.  Lastly, I increased the cloves of garlic to 4 large and I omitted the dried basil (the pesto has more than enough).  For the method, I cooked the chicken and removed from the pan.  In the juices/oil left in the pan, I sauteed the garlic until fragrant and then added the sundried tomatoes; cooked until heated through and added the chicken back to the pan along with the cheese sauce.  I heated this through and ended up adding a big ladle of the pasta cooking water to thin the sauce out (the sauce was a little on the thick side given the reduction of olive oil).  Once the pasta was done, I put it in the pan (don't rinse it!) along with the chicken and sauce.  The end result was really good and significantly more healthy.  The only change I would make if I were to make

I give this a 5, because it was amazing, even though I made some changes. First, I took some suggestions and cut way back on the oil. I also incorporated some white cooking wine when frying the chicken. I did the chicken different too: bought in already cut stir fry strips, dipped them in egg, breaded with italian bread crumbs & basil, then fried in a couple tbsp of olive oil and white wine. DELICIOUS! They fried up with a slightly crispy golden brown and it was amazing. As for the pasta, I used shredded parmesan instead of ricotta and I cooked the garlic and some pine nuts in the leftover oil from cooking the chicken and tossed it in. It was incredible.

this is delicious.  I used fresh basil from my garden, and went light on the sundried tomatoes since I used sundried tomato feta.  My only hesitation is how much cheese and oil is in it.  Definitely not a diet meal!

We thought this was awesome!  I didn't use as much oil as the recipe called for (since other people compained it was too oily) and instead of sundried tomatos in oil, I used the dried ones and hydrated them.

Not the best recipe I've made from this site. A bit too oily for my taste and the cheese didn't melt right. Will probably not make it again.

Great recipe especially with homemade pesto and a squeeze of lemon!  My boyfriend who dislikes any cheese except cheddar even had nice things to say - for one "this recipe is a keeper"!

Excellent.  Complex flavours for a Pasta Dish.  Drink red wine with dish and your taste buds explode.  My Favourite so far from this website, and I've tried a few dozen recipies.  So good that I had to write a reveiw.  Six Stars from me

First of all, this recipe says it serves 4 people but it's more like 6-8 servings.  I only had a little shy of 1 3/4 lbs. of chicken and I thought that was plenty.  I also thought that you do not need 1 cup of olive oil to make this work.  I fried my chicken in my non-stick pan with no oil (came out beautifully) and used a tiny amount of oil when I was mixing the sauce, chicken and noodles together.  It tasted okay but not worth the calories, though with the modifications, it should cut a lot of unnecessary calories (and will serve way more than 4 people.)

Tasty, but a bit on the pricey side.

I doubled this recipe because a member of my family is a big eater and leftovers never last long.  There are three adults and two children under five.  I would have been just fine if I hadn't doubled everything.  I have a massive amount of leftovers!

SO delicious!  I too decreased the olive oil to about 1/2 cup (just as much needed to coat the pasta when mixing in the sauce).  I didn't have ricotta cheese, but used cottage cheese instead and couldn't tell a difference.  Will be adding to our favorite dishes...Thanks!

This was a great pasta dish that we plan on making again!  Loved the flavors; they combined really well. After reading that it was a bit oily for some, I held off on adding all of the olive oil but then added the oil from the sun dried tomates until I reached my desired consistency. I can't wait to make it for guests!

This was alright.  I dont think I will make this again tho.  It was something different.  I did only add about 1/4 of the oil because a full cup just sounds nasty!  I still didnt like 1/4 cup of oil in it, because when it was on my plate some of the oil separated off to the side and it just seemed to make it sort of greesy like.  My bf seemed to like it better than me.

This was amazing. I added 1 cup of red pepper tomato sauce and some (about 10) tiny baby pearl red onions to the chicken.  I used goat cheese instead of feta and lemon pepper fresh linguini. Such a yummy combo. Dinner guests loved it up! Cook the chicken a day before so meal prep will be extra speedy if you have guests.

Did cut the oil back to about 1/3 cup in the sauce and it was very good. I sauted the chicken in about 3 tbs oil and a splash of white wine. Very Moist. Tasted very Italian..would have given it 5 stars expect that if one used 1 cup of oil it would be too oily for our taste( and I love olive oil)

Great dish!  I less than 1/3 cup of oil and added 1 1/2 cups of dry white wine.  I cooked cubed chicken, garlic, and 1/2 a chopped onion until chicken was done.  Added the wine and simmered until it was almost gone. Added all other ingredients (with a little more pesto because we LOVE it) and served it with some extra feta on top. Great dish! Thank you!

This recipe is great. Did make a few changes. First I cut the chicken when raw and the fried it. I also added a bit of pepper and minced onion to the chicken. In the sauce mix I reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup. Also I don’t like sun dried tomato so I added in a cup or so of sliced cherry tomato’s at the end. So tasty!

My big problem with the recipe was using the extra olive oil to loosen the sauce. I instead used a little olive oil to cook the chicken and then reserved a couple of cups of the pasta water when the noodles were done. My jar of sun dried tomatoes came julienned in oil. I drained them to see how much oil there was (about 1/4 cup) and added the tomatoes and the tomato oil into the sauce along with 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and salt and pepper to taste. I used a little of the reserved pasta water to deglaze the chicken pan, and poured it over the cooked pasta along with the sauce and cut up chicken. Then I added more of the pasta water as I warmed everything up together to make it more smooth. If this still seems too bland for you, adding some chopped kalamata olives ought to do the trick.

this was delicious, as a quick after work throw together and as it turned out I had everything available. I seasoned 2 pounded chicken breasts and sautéed them in some of the oil from the dried tomatoes, in a separate bowl I mixed  the other ingredients but not the oil, I instead used some oil from the dried tomatoes and also added a bit of the pasta water to loosen it up a bit. I used Costco Pesto, and bow ties for the pasta

I loved it but made some changes.  Added diced asparagus and baby spinach after I cooked the chicken, added about 1/4 cup broth so the veggies had something to cook in.  Hardly used any olive oil.  Left out the ricotta and the fettucine.

Very good! I omitted the feta and used an extra 3/4 cup of ricotta. I also added 1  cup of tomatoe paste and a few shakes of garlic salt. I also didn't have any pesto but the tomato paste seemed to make up for it. Turned out well, would definitely make again!

Excellent! I used egg noodles seasoned with wild garlic (what I had on hand), fresh tomatoes, and didn't have ricotta so I used extra feta. I cut the oil to just a few tablespoonsful. Served with asparagus.... ended up mixing it all together, delicious!!!!

If I were ever to make this again, I would make several changes.  1.  Use roasted garlic or cook the garlic before introducing it the mixture.  2.  Less oil, it is way too much.  The cause is way too thick, it needs broth or wine added to cut it.

I was looking for a chicken fettuccine recipe, and since I already had some sun-dried tomatoes, decided to make this. It is delicious, quick and everyone liked it. What more can I ask for in a recipe?

wow, Wow, and WOW! I have made this a few times and love it more every time I make it. I do add extra pesto and garlic. I have passed it on to other teachers at my school & one made it with shrimp instead of chicken. She loved it too (and also passed it on). YUM

Wonderful flavor! I too cut back on the oil, and added chicken broth and a little white wine. Also a pinch of red pepper flake. This makes a huge batch.  Will add this to our rotation of chicken pastas!

Absolutely delicious! I marinated the chicken with light italian dressing for 1 hour before cooking. I made my own Pesto Sauce recipe from this site. Also, as suggested by one of the reviewers I used fresh grated parmesan cheese instead of ricotta.

This recipe was fantastic! This may be my new favorite pasta. The cheeses blended together beautifully, and getting the proper tomatoes really is what makes this recipe, along with the oil (I just eyeballed it along the way and it turned out fine). I added some mushrooms to make the toppings more sporatic. I had to skip the basil pesto and just used the regular spice, and it still tasted restaurant-quality. Yum!

This is definitely interesting.  It felt like a fancy restaurant-style pasta but something was missing and I can't put my finger on it.  Maybe it needs another kind of cheese besides the feta (although I really liked the feta in there).  I will try again and tweek it.

Tasted great, however I cut the oil back to the bare minimum and after it sat for a little bit the noodles dried out the sauce a little. Still was awsome but would oil the noodles before I added the sauce next time.

I was expecting a good deal from this recipe... and while my girlfriend was very happy about it, I was not. All I really tasted was garlic. The rest of the flavors seemed lost... though I don't know that's possible! I was expecting a flavor explosion! I, too, used only 1/2 cup oil. I was just hoping for more and probably wouldn't make this again unless my girlfriend demanded it :)

This pasta was so delicious! I did not drain the tomatoes--just added them in with the oil. Also substituted parmesan cheese for the ricotta, and battered the chicken with bread crumbs, salt, and pepper. I did not measure the oil, but added it gradually until it seemed like I had enough. One full cup might be too much for some people. I will be making this recipe again!

This is one of the best recipes from allrecipes I've made!  I didn't give it 5 stars b'c I reduced the oil to a drizzle instead of a cup (is that a typo?), but other than that the flavors are wonderful.  I did use mini penne instead of fettucine, b'c I think it just looks nicer and is easier to eat.  I will make this again and again!

OH MY LORD...THIS WAS GREAT! I have gotten many recipes here, but this is the first review I'm putting up. I followed this delicious recipe exactly as it is written and I was blown away! I felt like I was eating in a really good Italian restaurant and it was so easy to make. Thank you Marc for posting this recipe. I had it Monday and I plan to make it again tonight (Friday). I will make this a few times a month, I'm sure!

My husband went crazy for this recipe!  I also really enjoyed the flavor.  Honestly, it was better the next day leftover!  I thought it looked messy on the plate, but who cares if it tastes good.  I did make some changes.  I used a whole pound of pasta, and probably 1/2 cup of oil which I think was still too much.  I didn't have basil pesto, but I had sundried tomato pesto so I used that and it was great.  I also added some shredded motzarella and omitted the chicken due to lent.

Tasty restaurant style pasta that is zesty.  Make sure folks eating it like pesto and sundried tomatoes or else they may not like it.  Half the oil like everyone else says.  I like cutting the chicken after it is cooked instaed of before like I normally would.  Makes it  easier to cook and cut.

I liked this a lot. I halved the recipe but kept the pesto amount the same. Oh, and cut down, way down on the oil. Tasty, but not so much as leftovers.

Oh my gosh! There are few things I make that I would consider restaurant quality...but this is definately one of them! And very simple. But yes, cut the oil by half, as so many others have said.

This was good! I made a few changes. As per a lot of the other member reviews, I cut the olive oil down to 1/4 cup. I also didn't have sundried tomatoes, but I had sundried tomato pesto, so I used this instead, and added fresh tomatoes. I cooked the chicken with garlic, and then added the rest of the ingredients into the saucepan with the chicken. All in all, pretty good!

Quite possible the best pasta ive ever had, but needed a couple changes, first i used a tiny bit less oil, more pesto, more feta, and i got this garlic spinach ricotta that went wonderfully with this. Also season your chicken a little bit, cook it in butter with some garlic and your favorite chicken seasonings.

YUMMUY!  We enjoyed this dish! I did make some changes based on others reviews, less oil and I flattened the chickenen breast and seasoned and fried with the oil from the sundried tomatoes. Used low-fat ricotta, a little extra low-fat-feta Added a little extra pesto, white wine, garlic and added crushed red pepper about 1-2 teaspoons, then little parmeson cheese on top. LOVE IT Thank you so much!

Great recipe for those who love sun-dried tomatoes. I left out the olive oil but kept some of the oil from the tomatoes. I didn't use the whole package of pesto but you can freeze it for next time. This is restaurant quality!

My husband and I liked this recipe.  The kids did not care for it, but, they think that chicken nuggets are the best food in the world.  I used only 1/4 cup oil added to the cheese mixture.  Also, I pounded my chicken breasts and then fried them whole in the olive oil seasoned with salt pepper and garlic salt.  After cooled, I sliced them for a nice tender chunk of chicken.  Serve with grated romano cheese and fresh cracked pepper. Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty with a great blend of flavors! Because of the feedback on the olive oil, I added it last, and just did it to looks and taste. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was amazing. As a "starving law student"  with finals coming up, I was limited with the materials I had to work with. Remarkably, I had everything this recipe called for - except fettuccine, I used angel hair instead. As many have mentioned, I used far less olive oil - 1/4 c and it was more than enough. I also seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, salt, and pepper before cooking it. This was AMAZING! I will definitely be making it for my boyfriend. So yum!

TASTY !  I believe the amount of oil you add needs to be evaluated depending on your personal cooking experience. I grilled my chicken with my own spices therefore I needed no oil.  I relied on the oil from the sundried tomatoes and alittle extra per our families preference.

Like other reviewers, I thought that a cup of olive oil was way too much. I used a few turns around the pan to cook the chicken and then a touch in the sauce. BTW, this was a bit of an experiment in that I did not have any ricotta so I used cottage cheese and processed it until smooth with a little olive oil and the rest of the sauce ingredients except for the sun dried tomatoes. I added white wine to thin out the sauce more. I only had dry sun dried tomaotes so I reconstituted them with boiling water and used some of that water at the end to thin out the sauce a little bit more. A tad too strong with the garlic, but then, my cloves were large. I would cut back on the garlic and maybe saute it in the olive oil used to cook the chicken. I will try this again.

I made this a couple of weeks ago and it was good, not great.  First off, the OIL!  Man, that's a lot of oil.  I used ONLY the oil that came with the sundried tomatoes and it was STILL way, WAY too much.  Since the oil was in the tomatoes it did give the pasta a nice smoky tomato type flavor but the dish itself was way to greasy.  Truly, I think that you can make this with no added oil.  If you do that, it really is a fairly healthy dish.  Also, when I made the chicken I went ahead and cooked it in a bit of chicken broth, some olive oil, basil and oregano - that part came out great.  I will make this dish again, it just needs some tweaking.

This dish was so simple to prepare.  To reduce the fat/calories, I grilled a chicken breast instead of sauteing in oil and used 1/8-1/4 cup oil instead of a cup.  Also used lite ricotta.  The pasta was fabulous, I will make this recipe again!

This was very tasty and you can make it without adding the whole cup of olive oil since the pesto and the sun dried tomatoes are in an olive oil base you get plenty there.  I browned my chicken in about 2-3TBLS of olive oil along with the chopped garlic. I also substituted chicken broth for the remaining olive oil and soaked the dried tomatoes in about a 1/2 cup of it.  Then combined this mixture with the pesto and ricotta. Combine the chicken and pasta and stir in the pesto mix.  I opted to omit the feta as I felt it was already salty enough but not too oily.  I'll make this one again.

The aroma from this recipe got rave reviews at my fiance's office. When he was heating up leftovers, everyone came by to check it out. Very good recipe. I used a mixture of basil pesto and sun dried tomato pesto. I omitted the feta cheese because I didn't have any, but next time I will try it with it. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, I made it as written. Next time though I will decrease the oil, I wasn't sure if I should or not after reading the reviews but went ahead and used all the oil called for. One thing I did was after seeing a lot of oil in the skillet with the pasta I scooped up the pasta in a bowl and took the remaining oil with the basil pesto still in it and put it on a little plate for dipping with Italian bread. Served with a Ceaser Salad. Think it might be a preference thing with regards to the oil. 
Thanks for the recipe

I LEFT OUT... the olive oil, dried basil, 3 T. pesto, garlic and ricotta cheese. I used a prepared packet of basil pesto instead and cooked the chicken on the grill. We LOVE this recipe! It is very good with red wine.

Yum!  Yum!  Yum!!  I have made this several times for company and it is always a big hit!  I have used the chicken and I have omitted the chicken, depending on the company, and both ways have won FAVE reviews.  Everyone requests the recipe from me!
