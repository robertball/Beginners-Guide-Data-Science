Fantastic!!! I have lived in both NY and RI. Surprisingly there are no NY wieners in NY. These are only found in RI.  In NY wieners with meat sauce are Coneys and are not the same. I have quested for years to duplicate these smallish (but not mini) dogs that we would eat by the dozen. This meat sauce is great and tastes like the real deal. It is not supposed to be too spicey. It is simple and easy to make unlike other recipes I’ve tried. I used a potato masher to make the chunks of browned ground beef finer for the sauce. Authentic method of preparation is visual and dramatic. Numerous dogs in buns are placed side by side up the chef’s arm to apply the condiments in assembly line fashion. It is nearly a friendly chef’s competition to see how many dogs can be prepared in one armload. For real authentic flavor use only plain yellow mustard and fresh chopped onions. I had forgotten about the celery salt but it is critical for the genuine experience. Use the cheapest smallest 12oz. packages of dogs you can find and cut off the rounded ends. Broiling them seems to be an acceptable substitute for the rotating hot dog grills the restaurants use. I don’t do this but there seems to be some additional authenticity and benefit as well to wrapping them in deli paper and allowing the meat sauce to soak into and steam the buns slightly before chowing down.

I was looking for a good "Texas Weiner" chili dog topping (in NJ, 20 mi. out of NYC, we call them Texas Weiners). I cut the recipe to 1/4 - there's just three of us eating them. Not bad, looked easier than the NY System Hot Weiner Sauce I recipe, which looks like it could serve 30 (3lbs grd beef? How much chili can you put on a hotdog fercryin'outloud?). A sweeter type of sauce (I added 1/4 t. of cayenne - gave it a slight "hot" finish) and now I don't have to jump in the car to go to Texas Weiner II on Rt. 22 (Still the reigning champ of Texas weiners). Try it...you may like it! Anything to liven up a hot dog, right?

We love the flavor.  I can not compare, because I have never had a New York dog.  I had to give it 4 stars because I think the measurements are off.  I only did 1/2lb of hamburger as there are two of us.  As I was cooking this and according to doing 1/2 I would only use 1/2 can of sauce... that was not going to be enough.  So.. I used the whole can and 1 tsp of the spices, no beef bouilan as it has to much sodium.  I used 1/2 cup of onions in the mix as not to over power it for my son.  I topped mine with the mustard, onions and celery seeds as described in the desciption... Very Good!  Thank you, something different than my chili sauce I make...

I doubled the recipe so I could have some to stick in the freezer. With that being said I DID not use the full amount of bouillion as after I added 2 cubes it was a bit salty. I also ended up doubling (in addition to the double reicpe) the spices because before it didn't really have any kind of taste other than being salty. Last night when I made it I really didn't care for it but we were having it for dinner tonight. I was suprised when I got home from work and sat down to one that the flavor had really developed into something much more than last night. All in all I'm not sure I would make this one again but it was pleasent to try.

Have lived in RI for close to 30 years and now visit the state several times a year.  This is not even close to any wiener sauce I've ever had.  As already stated, wiener sauce does not contain tomato sauce.

That said, this is a tasty recipe.  I would say it is more a sloppy joe sauce than anything else.  A little vinegar and brown sugar would really take it across the finish line in my opinion.
