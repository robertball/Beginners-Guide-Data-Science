This was a new twist on deviled eggs and everyone liked the added flavor! I would make them again!

Did not care for these.  I did manage to tweak the creamy base, it makes a delicious flavored mayo. To do that I added to the wasabi - mayo instead of miracle whip, dijon instead of yellow mustard & omitted the relish. Topped our turkey burgers with that. YUM!

I really enjoy wasabi in a lot of other dishes but not so much in this one. The second time I made this it turned out much better. I added dry ground mustard, a dab of white vinegar, a pinch of sugar and ditched the relish.

instead of the wasabi mayo & miracle whip, I made a garlic mayonnaise (found in AllRecipes!)... everyone LOVED the eggs!... Also,...we prefer to call them "ANGEL EGGS"... :)

I didn't have the wasabi so I just used regular mayo...with everthing else in this recipe. Love it!
Will make it again using dill relish, also...like to experiment a little. (Love the picture of the dish these were served in...looks just like what grandma would have used, :-))

Didn't have wasabi mayo so I used horseradish (Less than a tablespoon).  It was yummy!

This was the best deviled egg recipe I could work from to try making them for the first time.  I just used regular organic mayo, no wasabi because I don't like it.  Organic yellow mustard adds a slight taste of vinegar. The key ingredient is definitely the sweet relish.  The first time I made them I became the official deviled egg maker for family functions.  Which would be awesome if it weren't for how much work it was to peel the shells off a dozen eggs.

I haven't made it yet, but I am planning on preparing the recipe for Easter dinner. I'm assuming the eyes on the chick's are black olives, and the beak's are  pimento; if anyone has used other ingredients I'd like to knoww what they are.  I gave it a three because the recipe doesn't give the complete directions.

Will make these; looks like either capers or raisin or olive bits for eyes, and little triangles of pimento for beaks; also, cut eggs horizontally. No wasabi for me -- will tweak that!

I have made these cute deviled eggs the last two years for Easter. They are very popular with my family, very easy to make & very good.
 Just takes time.

I ended up boiling some additional eggs to create and add more body to the filling which was a bit too creamy for my tastes. The results were quite good and a hit with my friends.

Pretty tasty! I used regular mayo and added in some wasabi, as I did not have any wasabi mayo. The guys liked the kick in these. I would probably make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)
