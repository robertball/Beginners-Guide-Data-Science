I made this for the first time, just this past weekend.  The baking part was so easy, but to use a towel dusted with confection sugar was an ABSOLUTE HUGE mistake.  I had to throw  my first 2 cakes and the towels away, because they stuck to the towel so bad, and I didn't even want to bother washing them.WHAT A MESS!!!  I tried aluminium foil, greased and dusted with flour and it worked WONDERFULLY!!! Just pulled it right out of the pan, put a piece of parchment on top, and rolled it right up in the foil.  The recipe is 5 star+.  I didn't use lemon juice, and instead of the cinnamon and cloves, I used 1TBLSP of pumpkin spice.  Everyone was raving how heavenly it tasted. I will def. make over and over.  Can't wait to give away as small gifts for Christmas.  Thank  you!!!!
Another thing I forgot to mention, i didn't use any lemon juice or the nuts.

i don't add lemon juice and it turns out just as good...you can use heavy duty foil instead of wax paper it works alot better just lay your foil in the pan pour a little grease on top move the pan around and pour your batter on its much easier ...when the cake is done take it out and roll the foil in the cake while its hot ..let it cool .. unroll the cake add your filling then roll it back up with out the foil.. its so much easier!!

Excellent!  I've been looking for this recipe for a while now!  I did make one change--I left the nuts off the cake portion, because it becomes too hard to roll.  You can, if you want the nuts, add them to the cream cheese filling, that way the cake doesn't fall apart when you roll it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful, my family and friends loved it and it was simple! I have to add something to this....i used parchment paper in my pan also it worked great it made it easy to get the cake out, i did notice that if my cake wasnt quite done yet it would break after being rolled up but i used the filling to patch it and then roll it worked great! Also my family enjoyed it slightly frozen, i just put it in the freezer and then take it out when we want a quick desert, it does thaw and become moist its delicious either way....if you havent tried this recipe you should!

Definetely freezing the roll after it is complete has worked for me the best, I'm able to slice it while frozen and then serve it thawed. works great!

Also I just made some recently and I baked the cake in foil and then put parchment paper on top and rolled it, It does work great! I got this tip from another review.

I've been making this for years as is....but this year I decided to add 1 tsp. maple extract instead of the vanilla to the filling and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  It was a much better match of flavors between the pumpkin/pecan cake and the filling -- YUM YUM YUM!!

Great recipe.. I have been making these for years and had lost the recipe, thank goodness I found it here!  Easy to make and everyone loves them. Here's an extra tip: To keep roll from falling apart when rolling, reduce heat a few degrees or reduce cook time a couple of minutes and roll slowly.

Tastes very good. It is a good treat to take to Thanksgiving or Christmas gathering. I used a 13x7 cakepan lined w/ wax paper. I also, rolled it tightly with a clean pillow case. (My dish towels are not the Bakers smooth towels) One small can of pumkin makes 2 pumpkin rolls. One I added nuts to. The other I added chocolate chips. Don't add extra Pumpkin.

I've used this recipe for years now and have given them as gifts as well. It is easy as long as you remmember to spray the foil with a cooking spray generously. some people use towels but i found foil works as well and they can be rolled right back in the foil for refegerator.

This turned out perfect! I made these for Christmas and people actually fought over the last slice. Ha,Ha! I made them a month in advance and froze them. I defrosted them in the fridge for a day and they were still perfect.

This was my first attempt at making pumpkin roll.  Be sure to dust the towels well with powdered sugar (mine stuck to the towel a little then cracked while trying to pull it off).  The filling was also very good.  I will definitely make this again.

I've made this cake for many years and it is a wonderful dessert. I would only add that when you roll the cake, roll from the narrow end, the 10 inch wide end. This way you have a nice 3 to 4 inch wide slice when served. This may have been obvious to some but I just wanted to add that for those new bakers out there. Happy Holidays!

I also baked the cake on a foil-lined pan, then when it was done let it sit for a few minutes in the freezer, then rolled it right up in the foil and let it finish cooling completely.  It is much easier than the old dusted towel/parchment rolling technique.  I didn't use lemon juice either, and it was just as good.  Very, very good recipe!  I want to make just the filling and put it on everything!

Delicious and very rich.  Makes a nice presentation.  I used parchment paper in the bottom of my jelly roll pan and the cake came out perfectly.  The pecans are a nice addition.  Got lots of compliments and was accused of being "Martha Stewart!"
P.S.  Recipe does not state from which direction to roll the cake.  I rolled from the long end, my sister-in-law rolls from the short end, which gives you more swirls.  Anyone have a preference, or does one way work better than another?

This recipe was very easy, and one of the best cakes I've ever made.  I was worried about rolling up the cake in a towel and getting fuzz on it so I used wax paper which worked very well.  I've already gotten a few requests for the recipe!

This is very good. A moist cake. Thank You. My husband likes it this way, but I love a lighter cake, so here is what I've learned...
I seporate the eggs and beat the whites while gradually adding the suger until stiff peaks are formed.  I mix the yolks and remaining ingredients in a large mixing bowl and gently fold by hand the sweetened whites into the pumpkin mixture.

Great recipe...the lemon juice really isn't necessary...I also like to add some nutmeg to my batter...very tasty :)...for any new bakers, like myself...it makes it a lot easier to cream the butter and cream cheese if they are pre-softened...i.e. 30-45 sec in the microwave....

A few years back I had sampled a pumpkin roll at a Christmas gathering and loved it. I tried this recipe but had some difficulties. The pan size was not mentioned and my large cookie sheet must have been too large. When I turned the cookie sheet over the cake did not release from the pan. That is as far as I got with the recipe. I will try again but I will use wax paper as mentioned in previous reviews along with a smaller pan.

This is one of my favorites. Followed recipe exactly and it turned out great.  Only thing I did differently, I  folded some Cool Whip into the filling. Makes it a little fluffier......YUM!

My husband raves about this recipe.  I add 1 tsp. cloves and 1 tsp. nutmeg to the cake batter, and 1/2 tsp lemon juice to the filling.  You can also spice up the filling and make it a bit pumpkiny with 1/4 c. pumpkin, 1/4 tsp. each of cloves, nutmeg, and gnger and 1/2. tsp cinnamon, but I like it better plain.  Excellent recipe!

Great recipe!  I followed other reviewer's advice and substituted pumpkin pie spice instead of all the different spices.  I really like the combination of caramel and pumpkin, so I drizzled caramel sauce on the cheese mixture before I rolled the cake.  YUMMY!  I did not use the "two towel method" as suggested in the recipe.  I just used foil, greased and floured, under the cake and then just another piece of foil on top to roll it right on the pan.  Thanks for the recipe, Tammy!  This one goes in the dessert recipe album.

Truly outstanding.  My mom had seconds on desert for the first time EVER!  Superb.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  Very easy to make - just remember to be very generous with the confectioner's sugar when you dust your dishtowels.  Only thing I changed was I omitted the pecans as my family isn't much into nuts in their baked goods.  And I might try a pinch of clove next time, since I'm used to that in my pumpkin concoctions.  Really, really excellent recipe.  THANKS!

This recipe was fantastic.  I lined the bottom of my jellyroll pan with parchment paper, and it was very easy to remove from the pan.  I loved how this turned out.  It was so pretty cut in slices, with powdered sugar on top.  This was the only dessert that was completely eaten at our potluck dinner on Sunday.

These are excellent.  I used to et these from an amish farm when I was young and loved them.  These are just as good, if not better. I added 1/4tsp. of cloves as well it gave it a wonderful flavor.

Great recipe!  I was happy to find a pumpkin roll recipe that didn't require me to beat the egg whites separately and fold them in, as do many jelly-roll recipes.  I used a 15x10 jelly roll pan, which worked fine.

Yummy! I used non-stick aluminum foil to line my jelly roll pan and it worked like a charm - no sticking! I also left out the lemon juice and upped the vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon. For my taste, this called for too much ginger, so I only put in about 1/2 teaspoon and it was perfect for me. I also added a dash of nutmeg.Prior to rolling up my baked cake, I dusted it with confectioner's sugar, placed a piece of parchment on top and rolled it up with the foil and the parchment - worked great with little cracking and no sticking of the cake when it was cool and I unrolled it.
Though this is very similar to the Libby recipe, it's just different enough that I got better results using this version.

I'll admit I was thinking I'd screw this up but it was much easier than I thought. Definitely use wax paper to line your pan then pour in your batter.

All I could find was canned pumpkin pie mix. I merely reduced the sugar by 1/2 (used splenda) and lightened up on the spices.

VERY EASY!! I was a  little skeptical about the rolling of the cake part but I used a pillowcase instead.  That worked out perfect. After rubbing the sugar on the pillowcase it rolled PERFECTLY!! P.S I dont bake at all.. so this was the best and easiest recipie I have ever found and liked!! thank you

My favorite birthday treat was always carrot cake, until I tried Pumpkin Roll in the mountains of Georgia, on one of our fall vacations, on my birthday.  Pumpkin Roll is a timely treat.  I have a hard time sharing!

Great recipe--taste just like my mom's!  It was a little heavy on the ginger but maybe that was my mistake.  Also I followed advice of Brandice and CW2 (below reviews) and did not use the towels.  I lined the cookie sheet with greased foil and it worked great!!!

This was pretty simple to make.  After filling and putting it in the fridge, the cake seemed more dense.  I would have liked the cake to be a little lighter, like how it was when I took it out of the oven.
Otherwise, it was good.

Oddly enough, this tasted best after two days.  I don't understand the concept of putting powdered sugar on the damp dish towels, as it kind of dissolved, and made the roll a little sweet, for my taste.  My guests enjoyed this, it was easy to make, and looked nice, but the flavor wasn't a "wow".

Surprisingly easy, and turned out great the first time.  ( I made a practice roll before I made one for the bunco girls.)  I lined the pan with Reynolds non-stick aluminum foil...no sticking, just like they advertise.

This recipe is wonderful -- and I can even make it!  My family and friends ask for this one as soon as the weather gets cold.  It's especially great for holiday gatherings.  I skip the nuts though, and everyone loves it!

I subbed pumpkin pie spice for all the other spices (although I did add in a bit more cinnamon) and just used a dash or two of salt. Also, I mixed the nuts in with the cream cheese filling and when I rolled it, I used waxed paper. This was my first attempt, and it didn't turn out very pretty but, WOW! It tasted amazing. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  I didn't have any pecans, so I chopped up some walnuts, and substituted 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  It worked out great... I did have some trouble pulling it away from the pan... maybe I didn't let it sit long enough?  Any ideas? maybe I'll play around with the flour and 'grease'... perhaps not enough flour.
Anyway, all in all I will DEFINITELY make this recipe again.  :D

This was so good!! I don't make dessert often but wanted to try this for a Thanksgiving lunch at work. I think it's pretty hard to make for a first-timer. I'm sure it get's easier as you figure out what works and what doesn't. It still came out looking somewhat good though. I used foil instead of towels. I like that you can make it a couple of days ahead and not have to worry about it the day of the occasion.

I've made this for four years now.  It's a hit with a father-in-law, so even if I'm not their on Thanksgiving, I make sure I make it ahead of time for them.  I follow the recipe as written.

this recipe is truly the best one I've tried for pumpkin roll.  The filling is divine!  I wouldn't change a thing.

This was fantastic! Tasted great. I left out the pecans because they were a bit expensive at the store I went to and I was on a little bit of a time crunch. However, I think it might be just as worthwhile to buy a pumpkin roll at the store. It's a lot of work and the ones from the store taste just as good. When I have the time I'd love to make this again, but chances are I'll probably just buy one.

This was my 1st attempt at a pumpkin roll. Honestly I had been scared to try the whole rolling thing. This one turned out perfectly! I have to agree tho~ leaving out the nuts probably aided in the smooth rolling up process. I used maple flavoring instead of vanilla. Made the cream tannish but that's ok. used new French Vanilla cool whip on each slice. yum. some toasted or candied pecans on each slice would be yum too! try this recipe for sure.

My family loves this recipe! I have made it for the past several years during the Holidays. My family always gets anxious toward the Holidays waiting for this beautiful Pumpkin Roll. I have to make two and they only last a few days. Thank you Tammy!

about sticking to pan.  if you use the right size pan and generously grease and flour it will not stick. (Parchment is a great idea and will work just fine too) You also must cook the cake until it springs back when touched.  Take it out too soon and it will stick to your towel.  (use a Tea towel)  When you do take it out place it on a rack while you loosen the edges. You must do that.  keep going around the pan with your knife until it is completely free from the edges.  you will also see it pull away from the pan.  I did let mine cool for just 3-4 mins before i turned it onto the towel.  Roll it up slowly.  Let the rolled up cake cool completely on a rack. And if you use the nuts chop them into small pieces.

was absolutly delcious. I could not stop eating it!! Make sure to use lots of powdered sugar/cooking spray because the roll gets pretty sticky. Had to make a second one because the first one stuck to the towel even with quite a bit of powdered sugar on it. Was worth it though. very tasty.

Delicious cake! Moist cake, spiced just right. It tastes rather like pumpkin cheesecake. I made it exactly following the recipe, adding a little more flour because we live at 6100 feet elevation. I was nervous to try a rolled cake, never having done one before. But it really was quite simple and very good. I made it for dinner, to which we invited my dad, and he was impressed. My daughter arm-wrestled my husband for the last piece the day after our dinner (they split it!). Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I love pumpkin rolls! You MUST, MUST, MUST use canned pumpkin and not pumkin pie mix. I won't make that mistake again. I like to use maple extract in the filling.

this recipe was amazing. I'm brand new to cooking and it came out perfectly. I didnt use the ginger and added the pecans right into my filling. It was so quick and easy to make, I was able to do it in an hour before running to class. The best part is, it looks pretty impresive when you cut it up, especially to a bunch of college kids. I cant wait to go home and make it for my family.

This was excellent.  I left the nuts out after reading the other reviews.  Mine needed to cool longer than 20 minutes before filling.  It was moist and light without having to separate the eggs.  Yummy!

My changes: I used a large jelly roll pan, 12 x 17, (called a commercial half sheet) I double the pumpkin cake part of the recipe to make the cake thicker. I lined the pan with a greased and floured parchment paper, and I let the paper hang over the sides an inch for ease of removing the cake. I used Watkins Pumpkin Spice in place of the cinnamon and ginger, 2  tablespoons. Instead of using towels to roll, I laid out heavy foil w/ a parchment dusted w/ powd. sugar, and rolled the foil. I also doubled the filling, and spread a even 1/4 layer over entire surface, and I roll from the widest edge across. When doubling the cake portion, and rolling from the widest width, I was able to cut at least 20 slices. But before I attempt to slice I make sure it is frozen at least 2 hours, and I then use a electric knife for a clean slice.

Delicious, made a huge mess in my kitchen! I wasn't sure how long to cool it before rolling it out of the pan, so I did it right away, but I think I should have let it cool for 5-10 minutes. I used tin foil sprayed with butter and floured. It ended up a little messy because it was my first attempt at a roll, but it was delicious! If you want to leave the pecans out, it was fine in my book

Very good and easier than I thought it would be.  Tried both foil and parchment - both worked well, although I'll try non-stick foil next time.  I sprinkled the nuts over the cream cheese layer instead of on the cake, and I also used maple flavoring instead of vanilla as one review suggested.  My guests loved this!

Can't really complain - it's a good desert and looked impressive - just not my taste.  I just found it too heavy and sweet in taste to enjoy.

Delicous and really makes you look like a fabulous baker!!  I added the nuts to the cream cheese per others suggestions.  I did find that my cake cracked somewhat when rolling, but it was easily covered by the filling and the powdered sugar on the outside.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic recipe.  I have used many recipes from all recipes, but never felt the need to review.  My husband who hates pumpkin pie LOVES this.  He even said he likes it as well as my Italian Cream Cake, which used to be our pot luck/holiday favorite.  This pumpkin roll has replaced it.

My aunt has made pumpkin roll for 40+ years and I’ve used her recipe for about 30 years. I misplaced my recipe but I knew it used ginger and lemon juice so I tried this one. Pumpkin roll isn’t the same without those two ingredients! Thank you for posting this authentic recipe. You saved our Christmas tradition this year!

The recipe itself is amazing. Perfect taste and the filling is delicious. But when it came down to the rolling, it completely fell apart. I tried both the towel and the foil methods and both ruined the cake and I ended up eating it as a heap of mush (delicious mush, though).

Delicious filling. Cake tasty.  Use plenty of powdered sugar on the towels and you'll have no troubles! My sheet pan is larger than the one called for so the cake was thinner but no biggie. Got a bigger roll!

I made this dessert for a hot date I had this past Saturday. But my roommates Janet and Chrissy dug into it beforehand. Janet especially liked it but said it was better if let to stand at room temp for 20 minutes so the cream cheese softens a bit. Mr Furley was not around to try it.

I gave it four because the flavors are really good. As far as my pumpkin roll, it looked like a massacre happened. I am officially swearing off making them to save my self some aggravation and embarrassment and let the pumpkin roll gods handle it. If you think you can attempt rolling it without it cracking, sticking or just plain looking like a 5 yr old made it, go for it. As I said before the flavors are good.

WHAT I DO DIFFERENT IS INSTEAD OF USING CREAM CHEESE FROSTING I USE FRENCH VAN, OR BUTTER PECAN, ICE CREAM. IT'S AWESOME.

I have made this using canned pumpkin, not a can marked pumpkin puree and it turned out fine. The size of the pan is specified in the recipe as a jelly roll pan, 10 X 15 and that size worked.  I did not use any nuts and it still is delicious.

I learned this recipe in high school back in 1977 when they home-ed. I made it every year for my family, until during one our moves my refile box was lost. This is almost the same and will work for me. Thank you for posting this recipe.

Great recipe!  My mother has made the same roll for years and the family loves it.  The only change my mother does is instead of cinnamon and ginger, she adds 5 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice to it.

It was kinda scary when it came to flipping the cake onto the confectionary coated tea towel but it did not crack and the final end result was so worth the feaar factor.  Will surely try this again.

This is only my second time making a pumpkin roll and both times used this recipe. From earlier baking disasters, I've learned to use parchment paper, it never fails! Simple recipe, easy to make. A big hit!

I had a problem with it sticking to the pan and the towel; had to throw two rolls and two towels away.  I used parchment paper sprayed with Pam and it came right off the paper without any problems, however when I unrolled it from the towel it wouldn't come off and it crack to unrepairable pieces and the towel was ruined.  I have tried three times to make this and it's not working.  Will have to find another technique when rolling it and unrolling it.

Great recipe, it was a hit at my work. As mentioned in other review, I struggled with the damp towel, I'll use the sugar dusted foil mentioned in other review next time. The other issue I ran into was that my pan was too small, thus making my cake too thick. I ended cutting it into thirds and stacking it on itself with the icing in between. Next time I'm going to use a pan larger than 9x13

Nothing mentioned in the recipe helped to keep the cake from sticking to everything in creation.  Now I have a roll of ripped and torn cake around cream cheese.  I'm sure it'll taste fine, but I haven't had anything this embarrassing happen in my kitchen in years.

I have always bought pumpkin rolls because I thought they seemed difficult to make.  This was better than any pumpkin roll I've ever bought and so easy to make! I accidentally used baking soda instead of baking powder once but it still came out fine!  People are very impressed by them too!

This was my first attempt at making a cake roll . It came out great, I did use non stick foil and sprayed it with no stick spray. Surprisingly easy to make . I did add maple extract at the suggestion of one of the reviews . I cant wait to eat it ! :)
