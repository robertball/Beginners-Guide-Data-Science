I've been making chili for over 20 years and have even won a few friendly cook-offs, but this chili really wins the prize in our family.  I've tested it on friends, family (even the dog loves it) and it continues to be requested whenever we have get-togethers.  You really can't go wrong!

What is this?  Is this a chili? A casserole? A filling for burritos or a mexican flair for sloppy joes? I'm not sure. The taste is really good but if it's a casserole, there not much to it other than meat, beans and tomatoes.  If its a chili, its way to thick. It really is tasty and we topped each bowl with shredded cheese (I wasn't quite sure how else to serve this) but I just can't figure out what to make of it.

we are not chile lovers, but even my young children ate this.  I think I will substitute 1 more can of crushed tomatoes for the salsa as it seemed to have too much of a salsa flavor.

I made this recipe as stated except used 1 can chili beans instead of 2 cans of kidney due to preference.   It was very tasty and exactly what I wanted.  I will use this recipe next time!

This is my first attempt at making chili and it was so easy- it came out great! I forgot to put the jalapenos in,  just added extra spices and it was very good.
