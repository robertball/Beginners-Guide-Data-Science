Super yummy, I can't stop eating them! I changed a few things to make this a softer cookie: instead of apple juice I used apple cider and I added 1/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce, I also used only 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup of splenda. I also omitted the raisins and used 3/4 cup pecans instead of walnuts. This recipe turned out delicious and is perfect for a vegan like me!!

A nice spicy cookie which my kids really enjoyed.  I modified the recipe by using dried cranberries instead of raisins, substituting whole wheat flour for half the white (and adding a little extra liquid to compensate), and putting a few drops of lemon icing sugar glaze on the top of each cookie.  I also didn't add nuts because my kids have nut sensitive friends.  Excellent, but it took a little longer to cook than the recipe indicated.  I would try the recipe again with slightly less brown sugar (maybe only a cup), slightly less fat, and all whole wheat flour.

These were very good, like someone else suggested I also used apple cider.  I also added a tsp. of vanilla and instead of chopping the apples, I grated them.
They came out moist.  Good recipe.

I have beenbaking like crazy as i had 40 pounds of apples to get rid of.  By far this is the best apple recipe I baked!!!!! I didnt add raisins, but added a 1/4 cup more chopped apples, to die for!!!!! I never added apple juice, it never said when and they still turned out, batter was a thick and a bit dry but once you scooped out and rolled in your palms it worked well, i just smooched the balls a bit and on parchment paper, came out perfect!!!!! took them to work, they were gone in no time, and everyone requested recipe!!! LOVE THEM!!!

The recipe tasted great!!!! I couldn't figure out the apple juice though, added it anyway. This recipe made a cookie more like a crisp than anything.

I cannot express how grateful I am for this recipe!  My 2-year-old son is allergic to dairy, and my 1-year-old son is allergic to eggs, so I am always searching for milk-free, egg-free recipes!  I also added dried cranberries instead of raisins, and used water instead of apple juice, as I didn't have any.  However, 1/3 c. of liquid was not enough to make a dough.  It was still dry and floury.  I used 2/3 c. and that was a bit too much so maybe 1/2 c. ?  This is a great fall cookie recipe and I'm sure will be a staple for my boys for years to come!

I made these 2x. once i omitted the juice and added an egg. it was a more cakey cookie that way. Good both ways though. i did need to press the cookies down and flatten a little whithout the eggs in them  they did not spread on there own

I don't understand how these are so highly rated.  I follewed the instructions and am an avid baker.  They fall apart.  The flavor are there but the chemistry is all wrong and will not hold together.

It always cracks me up when I see so many differing reviews from one recipe. "They're too cakey" with "They're too crispy" and "They fall flat" vs "Be sure to flatten". We loved these. I was careful to sift my flour twice before measuring. I had to use leftover apple pie mix (which I cut to pea sizes) and I was out of apple juice, so I used orange juice to reconstitute my raisins and used that instead of the apple juice. While at first it did seem as though there was too much flour, I took my time and sure enough - the liquid hydrated the flour to just the right consistency. My only reason for a 4 rating is 1) 1 tsp of cloves is a tad too much - it really overpowered the cookie and 2) still struggling with cooking time. 400 burnt on bottom while tops were undone. So far, 350 for 12 minutes seems to be about right. Cripsy on the bottom while cakey on top. Will definately make again

Great flavor but cookied don't mix well or look appetizing at all. They come out flat like silver dollars and are somewhat dry and fall apart very easily. Make sure you put a plate under your chin.

Interesting cookie with good flavor, but the consistency is not my favorite. A little too soft and doesn't seem to hold it's shape very well.

i followed the recipe but added 1 1/4 apples (2 small apples) and added 1/3c plus a couple tbsp of apple juice when mixing the wet and dry, much easier to use your hands. they fall flat when cooling but they taste good and the house smells amazing

The taste is wonderful, but the texture is lacking.  My cookies look nothing like the picture.  They are extremely thin and spread out.  

Be careful while following directions, because no where do they tell you to add the apple juice.

Wonderful--made them for my little twins with allergies, but couldn't keep them away from the big kids.  Will need to double the recipe next time.  I took the suggestion of shredding the apple instead of using chunks.  I think it added a welcome bit of moisture to the dough.

These are officially my favorite cookies ever. I am not overly fond of nuts in cookies so I omitted them and increased the apples and raisins each by 1/2 cup. I used coconut oil for the shortening. They are moist, soft, and chewy, and don't come out too flat but they aren't too poofy either. I think they're perfect. And best of all they're VEGAN! My best friend is vegan and she loves when I make these. :)

Very good cookie.  Although the recipe does not say where to add the apple juice.  I added in with the brown sugar and shortening and this seemed to work well making the mixture a little more moist when adding in all of the dry ingredients.

Made these with my daughter today. They were super easy and super YUMMY!! If we had more of the ingredients on hand we would've tripled the recipe because we have sooo many apples! We didn't change anything other than using butter in place of the shortening and apple cider instead of juice because that's what we had in the house. Definitely a keeper!

When I combined the sugar/shortening & dry ingredients together the batter was extremely dry and I could not imagine 1/3c of cider (I substituted juice for cider) making much difference. So I added 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce as per Betsy Crocker's review had suggested and used the electric mixer to completely combine everything. The batter was very sticky and moist. The cookies spread and thinned out a lot! I could only fit 12 per sheet. Being so thin I only baked for 9 mins. They were very soft and need to cool on the baking sheet for 4 mins before removing them. They taste delicious but are not the prettiest cookies. I will need to experiment a little more to get the consistency correct.

First I would like to say thank you for the recipe, as is it was a great recipe just the way it is. Now having said that I completely changed it to suit me the second time around. I am type 1 diabetic and I really enjoyed the recipe so I thought I would make it a little more healthy.
I used 2 cups multigrain flour,instead of all purpose. 1/2 cup apple sauce & 1/4 cup shortening instead of the 1/2 cup shortining, I also used 3/4 cup splenda brown sugar blend in place of 1 1/3 cup brown sugar. Almonds in place of walnuts. 2 cups grated apples instead of 1 cup chopped and 1 cup unsweetened dried cranberries in place of rasins.
I think this is a great recipe to play with, you can change up the add-ins to suit any taste.

These are great!  I added the apple juice and some vanilla to the butter/sugar mix.  No nuts, so I added an extra cup of apples.  Make sure to let them cool before removing them or they'll fall apart.  Great autumn recipe!

I very much liked this recipe. I did however make a few changes. I used half whole wheat pastry flour for the flour, coconut oil for the shortening, milk instead of juice (since I had neither juice nor cider), and rapadura sugar instead of brown sugar. I look forward to making this again and again!

These turned out great!  Used whole wheat flour (added extra 1/2 cup), added applesauce as someone else suggested along with the juice, evap cane sugar and molasses rather than white sugar, left out the nuts (allergies) and added finely shredded carrots.  Would be better with either nuts or toasted oats

Yum! This cookie reminded me of ginger snaps, just with apple chunks added. So delicious. I'll be making these again, especially in autumn months.

I am out of eggs and wanted to bake cookies, so I thought I'd give this a try.  Delicious cookie!  I didn't have apple juice or shortening so I used a stick of softened butter and water.  I shredded the apples instead of chopping.  I used 2 Granny Smith apples.  My house smells heavenly!  I'm anxious to try them next time with dried cranberries.  Thanks for a great recipe!

When the cookies first came out of the oven I wasn't so sure how they would turn out texture wise. But once they cooled, everyone loved them.

Good recipe, can't say it was great cuz I didn't follow it exactly. I didn't measure any of the ingredients  except for the flour, soda, n sugar.  I also used a cup rather than 1 1/2 of sugar n that was more than enough. They turned out fluffy but more crumbly than I would've liked.

This is a great base recipe that was even better with a few modifications as suggested by others.  Cider instead of juice, added 1/4C apple sauce, 1/4C oatmeal (that I blended to smooth it a bit). They are cakey and delicious.

Most of the time I don't review a recipe, I don't get all the hype here at all.  These cookies didn't come out right at all.  Something isn't right about this recipe.  Is the apple juice for drinking or for what?  The only positive thing I could take away from this recipe, is that it made my house smell great while baking the cookies... or crisps... or whatever.  Hey, I'm not claiming to be an expert baker,  but I'm not a novice either.  
So if a one star rating means "Couldn't eat it",  than that rating is a very accurate one.

Followed this carefully and they turned out completely flat and fall apart easily. Taste was alright.

I didn't make any changes, but next time I will use a tablespoon or two more flour.  These are delicious, but mine spread out more than I would like, thus adding a little more flour next time.

I just finished making these cookies. They are very good. I love that there are no eggs or milk and only 1 1/3 cups sugar and it's brown at that! I think the author forgot to mention when to add the apple juice and I didn't notice it until near the end of the mixing process so I added it then. My guess is that it should be creamed with the brown sugar and the shortening. Otherwise the batter is too dry. I got the "Husband Seal of Approval" so they go into my recipe box to be made again in the near future.

Made these and they were wonderful. I changed a few things, I added 1 tsp of Pumpkin Spice, 1 tsp Vanilla Extract, used Apple Cider instead of juice and grated the apples. It was amazing the best fall cookie I have found.

Taste is great!  However, the first time I made them I did as instructed just switching out applesauce for apple juice, and coconut oil for shortening... They came out with the bottoms burnt and the cookies not cooked through.  (I may have unnecessarily greased the pan). 

The next time I used butter and didn't grease the pan, cooked them for 15 minutes at 350 degrees and they were perfect, and delicious!  I brought them with me to share with a crowd :).

Directions unclear.  More cake like than a cookie.  Was just  "ok".  Was more like a snack cake than a cookie.  Doubtful I will make again.

What a great cookie! I did use apple cider and had to add a splash or two more of it. I think next time I will add a bit less cloves as I thought it was a bit much. Very easy cookie to make!

I had apples I needed to use up so I decided to try this recipe.  I dove right in without reading any of the reviews, which is why I was stumped when the recipe didn't advise what to do with the apple juice.  I ended up adding it with the nuts and apples.  I followed the recipe exactly except I ommitted the raisins.  I had serious doubts about how the cookies were going to turn out when the batter just didn't stay together well.  As I rolled/patted/pieced mounds together on the cookie sheet, it reminded me of trying to mold wet sand.  Keeping them together was a challenge, but they came out GREAT!  They melt in your mouth with wonderful flavor!  A note about the apple pieces--I think slivers or dicing would be OK, but mine still came out moist using rather large apple pieces.  I wasn't sure if the apple was supposed to be peeled or not.  Leaving the peel on turned out fine.  Oh--and leave plenty of room between cookies.  Those crumbly mounds really stretch out with baking.

I skipped the cloves, used apple cider instead of apple juice, skipped the nuts, and used Ocean Spray Craisins (cranberries) instead of raisins. Per another users' comment, I doubled the amount of apple cider since the mixture seemed extremely dry, but then I was concerned about it being too most, so I added in more flour. I also added one cup of applesauce and grated my apples. I also added some carmel bites. The cookies didn't look ANYTHING like the picture for some reason, but still tasted decent.

Great Cookie! Though next time I'm going to cut the amount of sugar in half - it was waaaaaaay to sugary for me. I also just threw in the apple juice and as a result had to add lots more flour to get to the right consistency.

Er, you left something out of this recipe!  Didn't you forget to add the apple juice?  I thought the cookies were fine, but probably will not make them again because I prefer crisper cookies.

Great Recipe, thanks. I did modify by adding dried apricots and dried cherries and adding few tbsp of cheery juice. Also tried this with dried cranberries, was great.

My daughter and I loved these cookies.
I replaced the apple juice with red wine and used only 1/3 of the sugar and they turned out fantastic. I did not use the nuts because she is allergic.

We really loved these. One of my boys has severe allergies and this is the first cookie recipe that we have all enjoyed. They were worth the extra step of preparing the chopped apple. My only suggestion is to make sure you store them in an air tight container or they get hard like ginger snaps. I also used 3 teaspoons Cinnamon Plus instead of measuring the spices individually.
