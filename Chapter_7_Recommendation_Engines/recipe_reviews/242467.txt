Changes: I use 2.5 cups almond flour, no eggs, 3/4th cups egg whites, 1/4 cup almond milk (unsweetened) 1 cup Parmessan cheese, 2tbs garlic powder. Other than that, I follow the recipe. I don't miss the real eggs and the almond milk adds some moisture. My favorite weekend morning breakfast, no toppings needed, eat fresh out of the oven, but not bad toasted as a leftover.

This was ok. It was very dry and crumbly for me. I think it would be a keeper if I could figure out how to tweak it to make it not so dry.

It was very dry and didn't have a lot of flavor. I cook our pizza on a cast iron griddle so after I preheated I wiped olive oil on it then spread some cornmeal. This worked really good the crust didn't stick. I ended up just shaping the crust with my hands on the griddle. We are still looking for a good Paleo diet pizza crust recipe.

The crust did hold together really well.  If I made it again, I would roll it a little thinner and maybe put the parchment on a pizza stone, by the second piece the crust tasted a little crumbly and thick.  OK flavor, though.

I really like this crust for an almond flour based crust .  I roll it out nice and thin, use a very fine ground almond flour, and bake it until it's golden.  I also spread a bit of olive oil on the crust before I bake it which seemed to make it a little less dry. I also added truffle salt for extra flavor.  It's definitely not like a typical flour based crust, so if you are expecting that you may be disappointed.

This is a good pizza dough for those who can not have white/wheat flour.  We subtitute 1/2 the almond flour with oat flour.  It gives it a better consistency and taste.  This is not like normal pizza dough. It is more grainy.  It tastes like oat flour and almond flour. But with toppings on it, it is a good substitue for those who wish they could eat pizza.

I will definitely make this crust again. It held up well with all my toppings and browned to perfection. Can't wait to share the next one with my husband. Haha

This works for me on keto, I made small modifications due to not having all of the ingredients above & adjusting the fat content applied to the crust. 

1. Instead of 3 whole eggs, I used 6 egg yolks with a splash of unsweetened almond milk

2. I replaced the coconut flour with 2 tbsp of white flour (harmless on the keto diet, you'll only see a +2 net carbs per serving)

This is how I changed it a bit.  I used gluten free flour (it was on hand) instead of almond.  Plus I had to add about one quarter cup of water to form it into a ball.  I also added garlic powder half teaspoon.  More Italian seasoning.  Real salt and more pepper.   The rest is the same.   I have tasted it once cooked and it is delicious!

Having not had pizza in over 2 months, this was a nice variation for a cheat day. I added lots of seasoning to the crust for extra flavor(Italian seasoning, garlic & onion powder, salt), but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I loved it, hubby liked it. This was the first time for us both to have almond flour, so I think he was mildly put off by the grittiness of the almond flour - no fault of this recipe, just the nature of it. The structure held up ok, flavor and texture good. Overall a good low carb alternative!

I liked the fact that it was a "bread" type crust, however, it had a very dry texture.  Not sure if it was because I didn't use the King Arthur brand of almond flour  (I used an organic almond flour) or if that is just the way it is.  My son (10 yrs old) thought it was okay and my husband did not like it at all.

I liked the crust very much and so did my wife surprisingly because she is very picky with her food. It was a pizza sauce recipe  I made that was rather strong in taste and  just couldn't enjoy the pizza, that I made with my own 2 hands.  But I will make this crust again, just change sauces-for sure.

Love this crust! much better tasting then other gluten free recipes I've tried plus it's lighter on the carbs end too. I do suggest trying avocado oil, and granulated garlic with Italian seasons to the dough to jazz it up.

I thought the pizza crust tasted quite nice.  It had a nice consistency, but I realized I didn't flatten out the dough enough when preparing it, so it came out a little thicker than it should.  I had made a vegetarian pizza with it and had added pizza sauce, tomatoes, zucchini, and cauliflower.   I was enjoying it and ended up eating two slices.  Because of the amount of almonds in this crust, be wary and don't eat too much of it as it felt super heavy in my belly within an hour.
