This is the best stuffing I've ever tasted. Next time will try replacing 3/4c. butter with chicken stock.

This stuffing was satisfactory.  After peeling/chopping all the potatoes, boiling them, and all the additional steps, it took me over an hour to make.  The summer savory spice was GREAT--I add it to everything now!  If you are going to cook this on the side, make sure you cook it as long as the meat.  I think next time, I'll cut down on the onions and use meat stock instead of butter.

My husbands grandmother was from Montegue PEI and made the same dressing.  We have it 2-3 times a year and everyone loves it.  I add a lot of celery to this and save my bread heals all year in the freezer to make this.  My family adores this! I would love to be in contact with the person who put this recipe online. I give it 4 stars!

This is my favorite kind of stuffing! However when I make it I don't mash the potatoes, and I also add celery. Also when I aslo use egg in addition to butter when I mix it all together. What a great recipe!

If time is an issue, consider using instant mashed potatoes for this recipe.  It will do the trick.

My family has made this stuffing for generations. It's an old old recipe. Only thing I noted is that we added cooked chopped giblets and sage. It's is grand with those two items.
By the way, never ever used instant potatoes when making this stuffing. Homemade whipped potatoes make it so much more fluffy whereas instant make it watery and less flavorful. Great grandma and throughout generation we always used homemade whipped potatoes. Don't know where people get the idea to use instant as that is not the authentic recipe. Don't cut corners when it comes to this recipe. 
We also added slightly sauteed celery. 1 Cup. Who ever puts fruits, vegetables, etc is destroying this recipe. Stick to the authentic. Yuck who would add fruit such as lemon and instant potatoes. Disgusting.
Not stuffing it in the turkey. Just put it in a buttered casserole dish and bake it at 325 for 20-30 minutes.

My version turned out great! I just had no idea how to bake it since I wasn't stuffing a turkey with it.

This has been a family recipe forever.  I have only once seen this before.  We used a ton of sage instead of savory but sounds just as good.  If you want a moist stuffing, you can't go wrong with this one!  I have done it both ways, in the turkey and in the oven.  Since everything is already cooked you just need to warm through.  Thank you for reviving this recipe, hopefully more people will try it!

I only gave 4 stars becaused I changed it a little.  I used a packaged stuffing mix instead of bread.  I used the onions and 1 teaspoon of poultry seasoning., salt and pepper, and mashed potatoes.  It was so good.  Everyone raved about it.  It was so moist .  I did not stuff the turkey but cooked it in casserole at 350 for 20- 25 min.  Just until it browns a little on top. Thanks for the basic recipe.

This a great stuffing recipe!  I make this recipe but with a couple of minor changes.  I add about a tso. of ginger and I add lots of celery.  I also pulverize the onions and celery in a food processor.  I save the water from my potatoes to add to veggies in case they need a bit of help in the processor and also to add to the stuffing if ends up being a bit dry.  I also do like another reviewer and save the heels from my bread and when I accumulate a large amount, I break it up and store that in the freezer so that I always have breadcrumbs on hand,
