I made this for Thanksgiving and it was awesome! I had to substitute celery for water chestnuts because I didn't have water chestnuts, and I always like what celery does to dishes.  It was the best green bean casserole I have ever eaten!

Absolutely delicious!  A huge hit at Thanksgiving.  I did not add the water chestnuts.  Will definitely make next year.
