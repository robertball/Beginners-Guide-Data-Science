This was a very basic, but, good breakfast casserole that was well received by my guests.  I added a few extra pieces of bread because it didn't seem like enough in my dish.  It could have been because my bread slices were a little smaller than the ones the author used.   I personally would have preferred adding some sauteed onion and red pepper, but, everyone else liked it as is.  Preparing it the night before saved me a great deal of time and mess in the morning.  I would make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy and delicious! Followed the recipe as written  and it was awesome for Christmas morning. The only thing I might change is to reduce or eliminate the salt. GREAT ONE LORI!

My picky eater teenager liked it. It packed well, and he ate some for breakfast "on the hoof" walking to school, and the rest for lunch. It's a basic recipe, and sometimes basic no frills meals go over best in our house. I used a whole wheat seed bread, which gave it extra heartiness, but next time I'll omit the bread crust. Thank you!

I doubled the recipe because there were 5 adults eating, and used a dutch oven to make it in because it's all I had at our lake house.  It was fabulous .... crispy around the edges and cheesy deliciousness on top!!  One thing to keep in mind if you double the recipe is to double (almost) the cook time as well!!

This was a definite hit!  I took one reviewer’s advice and used cubes French bread, but I used a half loaf which must have been a bit too much. So I added another 3 eggs and 1/2 c. milk so that it wasn’t too dry. The only time saver I tried and was pleased was to use pre-cooked patty sausage and cut it into 1/4s. Saved time and made for  easy clean up.

Easy to put together the night before.  The family loved it.  I used pre cooked turkey sausage crumbles to cut back on fat.

Great recipe.  Made a head of time and it was fantastic.  Added some cut up ham.  I reduced the salt like recommended and it was great.

I made this breakfast casserole with bacon (fried crispy) instead of the sausage as in the recipe.  I also cooked it for 40 additional minutes (last ten minutes without the aluminum foil) because it didn't look fully cooked after 45 minutes.  I also added a lot of herbs that I have, i.e. oregano, Mrs Dash, parsley flakes, sage to give it more flavor.  This breakfast casserole is delicious I will definitely make it again with the additions I made.

I did take some liberties. I used seasoned bread croutons and added chopped onions, peppers and garlic to the sausage while cooking it.  Because it seemed a little dry, when I make it again, I will add an additional  1/2 cup of milk.

This was quick and easy to put together as well as delicious. I used lactose-free milk and only 1/4 tsp salt. I chose this because it didn't have as much cheese as some of the other recipes. This one's a keeper.

I used Aidells Chicken and Apple Sausage and browned them before folding it into the egg mixture.   I also used Whole Grain Eureka Bread, and used about 4-5 slices of bread which included both ends.  It's a great basic recipe, and next time I will brown some onions, mushrooms and add some spinach.  But to remove the liquid before folding it into the egg mixture.  I'm thinking I could probably made one that is strictly with bacon as well.   Great recipe that tastes great and a time saver because it is prepared the day prior.

I made this for Christmas morning. It was very good. Didn’t give it 5 stars because I changed it a bit. I used thenO’Brien hash browns instead of bread. Also used hot spicy sausage for a kick

I was looking for a quick, easy breakfast casserole for Christmas morning (on Christmas morning!) that didn’t have potatoes in it. This recipe was fantastic and just what I was looking for. My family went nuts over it and wants me to make it again this weekend!  I made a couple small changes. I used 10 eggs because there were 4 adults eating and then added ¼ tsp more salt and pepper. I also used taco cheese and added another 1/2 cup. I also put the bread slices in the bottom and poured the mixture on top instead of tearing the bread into pieces. Cooked it for about 45-50 minutes. Will make again!!

I doubled it and put it an 11x13 pan.  Used one 8oz bag of cheddar jack cheese.  I like how it filled the casserole using the bread and the sausage.  Keeper.

This recipe turned out really great. Based on other reviews, I added more bread, 2 extra eggs and a little bit more milk. I also added a tsp of ground mustard and some minced onions.
