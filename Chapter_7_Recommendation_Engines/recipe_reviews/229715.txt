A few years back I went the Hershey Pantry restaurant in Hershey PA and had baked oatmeal for the first time and totally loved it!  I have trying without success to replicate it ever since.
This recipe is definitely on the right track but not quite there.
I like the flavors ,  I did add lots of nuts I admit.  Its the consistency that could use some help.   

Following the recipe I found the baked oatmeal a little to moist.
It should hold together more.  Somewhere between a custard and cake.
I tried cooking longer, 20-30 minutes and that improved it but not quite there.  So I think the next time I would add less milk. Maybe only 2 cups.   But don't get me wrong ... this was still very tasty.

I make this on a regular basis as breakfast for the kids. Hubby likes it as a dessert. I do change up the pie filling and the spices accordingly.  My son especially likes this with cherries, almond extract and some chocolate chips. Raisins and walnuts make a nice addition to the apple pie filling. You are only limited by your imagination. I am off to try this with pumpkin.

I expected it to be a lot sweeter then what came out, so I topped it with a cinnamon sugar mix and when serving I topped it off with cool whip. me and my sweet tooth:)
