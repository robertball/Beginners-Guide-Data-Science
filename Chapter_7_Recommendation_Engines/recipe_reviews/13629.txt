I just made this as thanksgiving is coming up in just days, and I loved it so much I am not even bothering with buying the canned cranberry sauce this year. So good, I jarred it and gifted it to others...had to buy more cranberries and make a second batch! Thank You.

I thought I'd try something different this year, and was trying out different recipes for the obligatory cranberry sauce with Thanksgiving dinner.  Oh-my-gosh!  I just loved this one.  It's a beautiful clear color, not too sweet or tangy, but definitely just right.  It's a great mixture of sweet, tart & tangy.  I halved the recipe, as I said, I was trying them out (the only change I made was to use brown instead of golden raisins - because it was what I had on hand); but I'll probably make a full recipe soon, and give some as gifts. This is a keeper.

I am trying this recipe after buying a jar at the Blue Haring wine and specialty store in Tillamook, Or.  My fiancee and I loved it so much thought we'd try to make our own. Will let you know how it goes over after our Christmas dinner.
