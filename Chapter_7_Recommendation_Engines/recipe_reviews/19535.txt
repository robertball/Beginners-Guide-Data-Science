My boyfriend took one bite and spit this out.  He even put the rest back into the original bowl.  When you bake this, it makes the sour cream curdle.  Did anyone else have this problem who tried it??  I was so much looking forward to this and it was a dry, clumpy mess!!  I was really dissapointed. Threw it out.

This had a very strong onion-y taste.  Not in a good way.  I used fresh minced onions and think it may have been better had I used the dried kind and maybe cut the requirement in half.  Who knows?  I probably won't make this again.

All that this recipe needed some the substitution of 1 container of cottage cheese for 1 of the cream cheeses, add a little more hot sauce with some asiago cheese, add some melted butter and grated mozza to the crust - and then you got yourself some flavor!  Chopped herbs are also welcome here, whatever you have on hand.  It's a side dish that goes with anything.

I made this tonight for supper. I portioned it down to serve two. I used dried onion and it seemed to not have to strong of an onion flavor, but still it seemed to dominate the dish. I thought this would have been much more creamy. Not one I would make again.
