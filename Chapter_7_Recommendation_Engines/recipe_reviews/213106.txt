In the traditional version you never add vinegar or green onions. Though it's good to mention that people from different regions of Russia had their own versions. Instead of green onions we always used white onion. Adding a fresh cucumber or frying potatoes like other reviewers did is a big no no. People, you can change whatever you want, but you can't rate than the recipe correctly or call it authentic! A tip: dice the ingredients into smaller pieces - you will have better presentation and better absorption of the flavors. Also, let the salad sit in your fridge over night - this will allow flavors to blend better.

My Russian wife from Yoshkar-Ola says that dill pickles are only served on the side and green onions are never served with the dish nor is the vinegar used. Those items are scarce in Russia. This recipe I tried  is fantastic but not authentic.

I did my own take on this recipe.  I boiled the beets, and fried the potato and carrots.  I used a cucumber and dill weed in place of the pickles.  It turned out nicely! Thanks for inspiring me to create a twist of your recipe!

I am not really sure beets will be ready in 30 minutes. It usually takes hours to make beets tender and ready to use. The other tip - cube the veggies when they cool off, potatos won't stick to other veggies and it won't look like a mess ;-) Good luck~!

Great recipe.  I used mayonnaise instead of the vinegar and oil and added some finely sliced dill.  It was excellent and everyone cleaned their plate!

I love it but with some changes! The salad calls for sauerkraut and onions (not only green). Also you can add kidney beans and mustard. And the best oil here is sunflowerseed oil. Vinegar is not a must. Actually I can't imagine the taste of the salad with any kind of vinegar.

I forgot to mention - I usually boil beets around 40-45 minutes, not 30 minutes. You should be able to pierce them with fork easily. Do not peel before boiling. Cool, then peel.

Very good.  I can't give any info on how authentic it is though but I like very much.  Here are my mods: I make double so I doubled all the ingredients EXCEPT  the oil and onion.  This seems to increase the presence of the beet and carrot flavors imo.  It also reduces the fat per serving making this a pretty healthy potato salad.  I didn't have any champagne vinegar but raspberry vinegar works VERY well it seems.  I think I'll try mustard next time as well.  Bravo.

Made it a bit different:

Used 2 med onions
3-4 polish pickles
1/4 cup of olive oil
2-3 tblsp of mayo
1lb of sauerkraut
3 large beets
7 small potatoes
4 large carrots
salt to taste

Boil veggies all together without peeling until cooked, you may have to remove the carrots and potatoes before the beets as they take longer. meanwhile sautee chopped onion with a tsp of butter, chop pickles and add sauerkraut to bowl. When veggies are done, peel and chop(dice), add mayo, salt to taste and olive oil. mix all together! Divine!Make a huge amount of salad, good for potlucks, parties etc.

My husband is from Ukraine and one of his favorite dishes is his Mom's beet salad.  I decided to test this recipe out and see what he thought.  He loved it and he had no suggestions!!  He thought the green onions and vinegar were a nice touch.  I did use balsamic vinegar instead of champagne vinegar.  Thanks for sharing!!

In Russia we call it vinaigrette but we never add vinegar in it. Usually it's served with some oil. I like it with mayonnaise most of all. In my family it always consists if sauerkraut, boiled beets, potatoes, carrots and onions. But I'm craving already to try it with balsamic vinegar, at least it will be much more healthy than with mayo.

I really like this recipe - the pickles are an excellent surprise combined with the beets.  also, if you can keep the beets from bleeding on the rest of the salad, it is very colorful - orange, white, green, red.  I tried it this time with turnips also. good!

Lovely recipe>  That being said, I made a couple of modifications:  Roasted the veggies in the oven instead of boiling.  Also, I have a ods and ends pickle mix that I keep up and I used about 1/4 cup of those--very nice.  Also a few slices of cucumber tossed in to freshen. Thanks for a great base recipe to work from.

Great recipe, although I prefer mine with mayonnaise. 

Tip for cooking beets fast - trim the stem, then put them in a covered pyrex dish with about 1-2" of water. STick it in the microwave for 10 minutes, turn the beets, then nuke it another 10 minutes. Let them sit to cool down, and they should be perfectly cooked. You may need to adjust the time according to the size of the beets and your microwave!

I skipped the carrots and substituted Leeks for green onions (more fiber and a milder less acidic taste in my opinion).  I also think I should have used Russets instead of the Yukon Golds.  The Golds got too soft too quickly and turned orange.  I think the starchier potato would have served the recipe better.  I have to admit, I had a salad very very similar to this at a dinner a few months ago and that one was wonderful (cooked by people who had all spent time living in Russia, including a man visiting from Siberia). This was not as good, I think it's missing something.  Maybe some Worcestershire Sauce?  I unfortunately don't have any to try.    As is, it is kind of bland.  I may try it with pickled beets instead of boiled and see how that turns out...

Great on the first attempt !
I made the dressing with light olive oil and white wine vinegar (already on my shelf) and added the salt here.  I left out the pickles in favour of some fresh red cabbage.  I was going to add some red onion but will save that for my second attempt.
I cubed the beets and potatoes considerably larger than depicted in the photo; my preference and less work !  
Agreed, Nataly. I cooked the beets for more than 50 minutes.

Can't speak to authenticity. I wanted to make something different out of the vegetables from my garden. Made it exactly except I only had balsamic vinegar. We found it ok but very bland. added some mayo later to try to jazz it up. I think I want to taste this made by an expert before trying again. I want to know if it is just as bland or if this one is missing something. The saurkraut some reviewers mentioned might improve it. I really don't know

I make a bowl of this every few months to have for lunch over a few days. I use apple cider vinger in place of champagne vinegar and use only 2 tablespoons of oil. My mother always made hers with white or yellow onion and sourcrout/pickled cabbage but I prefer the green onion and pickles.  The balance of flavors - sweet beets, something sour, and starchy potatoes - is the same, so it's a matter of texture preference or what you have on hand. I've seen it made with pickled mushrooms in some families or beans in place of or in addition to potatoes.

 I'm confused about the people saying vinegar is not traditional for this dish.  Where do you think it gets it's Russian name if not from the vinegar-based dressing? Perhaps soviet scarcity led to people leaving vinegar out and substituting other dressings, but it had to be part of the original recipe.

This is a great recipe! I love it, and make it all the time. I do chop the potatoes/carrots/beets before boiling as I find it easier that way. I have used different vinegars, and usually use apple cider, because thats what I have on hand.

This was so good with fresh beets from the garden! I didn't have champagne vinegar so I used red wine vinegar. Yum!

I had 3 large beets, so I added extra of the other ingredients. I used balsamic vinaigrette and it brought a nice flavor to it. I think, for personal choice, I'll use diced onion instead of the green onion next time. 
I'll definitely do another batch in the future! Such a healthy, tasty sidedish!

I hate beets but I had them in my pantry. So I wanted to use them and I did a few tweeks to the recipe.  Instead of vegetable oil I used olive oil. Then I used balsamic vinegarette.  Cooking the beets instead of boiling them I baked them at 400 degrees for 50 min sprinkled sea salt on the beets with one peeled onion and 6 garlic cloves all on one baking sheet. Diced the onion and beets and minced the garlic. Mix it all together and it was pretty good.
