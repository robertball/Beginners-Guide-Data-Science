3.5 stars. I followed the instructions for these accompanying recipes only adding some peppers to the celery. They were good but the amount of soy sauce and red pepper flakes for the celery part was too much and the heat of this dish distracted from the pork dish. I served the pork over buckwheat noodles and it was tasty. I would make it again adjusting the celery part of the dish.

The marinade was very good but i think it needed more veggies. I m not a huge celery fan. I think i  use peppers next time.
