What a simple and tasty way to make salmon! I used 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1 tbs brown sugar, and 1 clove chopped garlic, as suggested by others, and used white wine since I had no red wine on hand, and cooked the salmon on the George Foreman grill in 10 minutes. This was so easy and tasty that I made it again the next day, and since I was coming home from work and the gym, I needed a quick and healthy dinner, so I seasoned the salmon in a bowl, using pre-minced garlic out of a jar, and didn't bother marinating the salmon for hours, but just put the salmon in aluminum foil and spooned some of the marinade on top, closed the foil and put it in the oven 20 min at 350 degrees. Made instant brown rice which I cooked with frozen veggies for a side dish...very little mess to clean up...same great taste. This is a keeper.  THANKS!

This was pretty good.  I cooked it for my fiance and we both loved it. We are salmon lovers, but are very particular about it.  And we enjoyed this meal very much.  As per previous reviews, these are the changes I made.  I decreased the soy sauce and increased the red wine both to 1/2 cup.  I also added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.
I did not have an outdoor grill, so I used my oven broiler.  Turned out perfect.

I followed the previous advice and cut the soy sauce to 1/2 cup which was perfect.

Best grilled salmon I ever had.  Also used it on swordfish and it was great.  I'll try it on other fish as well.  Used 1/2 soy and 1/2 cup white wine along with a bit of minced garlic and 2 T. brown sugar.

EXCELLENT!  I took the advice from some of the other reviews and cut the soy sauce back to 1/2 C and added 2 Tbsp brown sugar -my husband can't quit raving about the salmon tonight.  5 stars!

I wanted a quick recipe for a dinner party and this sounded simple enough.  I used wine vinegar instead of the wine.  It was a smash hit - complimented by everyone, even my son who isn't too fond of fish.

I am glad to be able to add another salmon recipe to my collection. Like other reviewers, I used 1/2 c of soy sauce and 1/2 c of red wine in the marinade;  I also added 1 tbsp of brown sugar and 1 tsp of dijon mustard . After adding the salmon steaks to the mixture, I let them sit in the fridge for 4 hours.  Just before cooking I added 1 tsp of lemon juice and 1 garlic clove, minced to the salmon marinade. As with all marinades, I just basted the salmon with it for the first half of the grilling time, to reduce the chance of food poisoning .

I think this recipe could be really great, the marinade was just a little too salty for me and I only marinated it for an hour and a half, not the recomended two plus hours. It might be because I didn't charbroil the salmon, I used packaged salmon from Trader Joe's that comes in a re-sealable plastic bag that you use to marinade and cook the fish in. It was super easy to make this way but next time I will try grilling it and adding more wine and less soy sauce to the marinade.

I'm no chef and no fish fan either, but I made this as the main course for a special dinner and it was fantastic. I used the .5c soy, .5c white wine, and 1 tbsp brown sugar. Should taste good on pork too.

This was delicious! I marinated it for about 5 hours. Added a little lemon juice and right before grilling it added a little garlic. We loved the crispy outside. It had so much flavor! We had broccoli and cajun seasoned potato wedges on the side. Yum!

When I made this recipe, my husband and I loved it!  We are seafood fanatics, but didn't have a good recipe.  The marinade was wonderful.  I took everyone's advice and reduce the soy sauce amount while adding brown sugar.  I broiled the salmon.  It turned out great!  It was very quick on the broiler as well.

Great recipe, however I too made some modifications.  I cut the soy sauce in half and used low sodium. I also added a tsp. of wasabi for a little extra bite.

Absolutely the best marinated salmon recipe on this website!  However, I too added brown sugar and garlic to the mixture.  Instead of red wine, we brought back Shiraz sauce from our honeymoon in Australia, so I used that instead of red wine.  Baked at 400 degrees for 17 minutes.  My mouth is still watering!

I thought this recipe was great!!! My husband usually doesn't eat salmon but he thought this was great.  I changed some things like the others using only a 1/2 c soy sauce and 1/2c of red wine vinegar along with 2T of brown sugar.  I think next time i will top the salmon with some pineapple rings.

love this marinade! have used it a few times and turns out great, with the same adjustments suggested by other reviewers (equal parts wine and reduced sodium soy sauce, and with sugar). i don't have a grill so put it under the oven's broiler for the same time (5 mins each side) and it turns out GREAT. so easy. delish with saffron rice or couscous.

Salmon is my mother favorite ( I don't care that much for it)but it was her birthday so I made it. It was wonderful! I ate more than anyone else.  I took other advice and add the sugar and garlic and changed the amount of wine\soy sauce to 1\2 c each . Also I brioled it.

I made this for my husband who rarely ate fish before meeting me. We both gobbled it up. I used salmon filets instead of steaks, but no changes to the recipe... it was delicious!

I did as others suggested and used 1/2 cp soy sauce and 1/2 cup red wine.  I also added about 1 TB of chopped garlic.  I used it on a salmon filet and covered the grill with aluminum foil.  It was wonderful.  So flavorful, I was snacking on the cold salmon leftovers.

This is a recipe for Teriyaki salmon, nothing more . . . nothing less . . . 

Soy sauce, no matter how small the quantity tends to overpower . . .

Very tasty! Trouble free.  Just before pulling off the grill, I threw on some lemmon juice, worked very well.

BRAVO! This was a wonderful marinade for salmon steaks! I took the advice of many reviewers and used 1/2 cup of wine, 1/2 cup of reduced sodium soy, a little brown sugar and 1tbs. minced garlic...left it in the fridge for 8 hrs. and grilled on the bbq....PERFECT! We had this dish twice already.

I usually marinate salmon for over night.  I wanted to broil this salmon as soon as I came back from work, so I fixed the salmon in the morning and it was marinated for about 8 hours.  It became too salty and basting made it worse.  If I try this again, I'll use less soy sauce or low sodium soy sauce like other reviewers said and marinate it less.

I listened to the other reviews and did equal parts red wine and low sodium soy sauce. It was good, but still a tad too salty for us.

Very good....I also cut the soy sauce in half, added a half a cup of red wine and two tablespoons of brown sugar along with the other ingredients.  The result was very very good.  Will definetely make again very soon.  It went very well with the grilled asparagus from this site.
Thanks

This was good. I would have given it 5 stars but I think you really need to like seafood. We are not big seafood people. I took advice from others and you really do need to cut the soy sauce and wine in half and add the brown sugar. 
I would recommend this to someone who loves seafood.

My husband and I love salmon and I have as many recipes for it as I do chicken.  I am always looking for new ones that are different and good.  The red wine is this marinade gave it a wonderful and different flavor from the white wine I normally would use.  I will make this one often.  An excellent recipe.

Delicious! I followed another recipe modification for baking: 1/2 c soy sauce (I used braggs), 1/2 c red wine, 1 clove garlic, 1 tbsp deli mustard, 1 tbsp brown sugar, I substituted 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon for the ginger, and I added some chopped red onion since I had it ready... Delish! It definitely needs more than 20 mins on 350 degrees. I recommend 30 minutes for medium.

Solid dinner! It turned out better than I anticipated, it came out to fantastic, the fish flaked nicely. 

I don't have a grill, but I used the broiler setting and it didn't really matter much.

A different flavor for salmon that we enjoyed - but check out that sodium content!  I broil it and it turns out so flavorful and tender on the inside.

great, low fat salmon recipe marinade- also added about 1 tsp of minced garlic, upped the wine- about 1/2 c- otherwise- the soy sauce overpowers it.

Very tasty way to make salmon- I used filets instead of steaks, still came out tasty.

This recipe was easy and tasted better than a restaurant dish I had weeks ago.  I also cut the soy to 1/2 cut and added about 1/4 cup of red wine.  I broiled it instead of grilling but it was absolutely wonderful!

Great dish, easy to prepare.  I did use 1/2 cup of the soy sauce with the brown sugar, and this turned out fantastic.  I dont usually eat salmon and this "first try" for this amateur chef was a huge hit.  Didnt garnish with lemon, but wish I did.  I reheated leftovers and used some spicy dijon mustard as a dip, and this tasted fantastic.

The marinade for the fish was great although i did use less soy sauce 1/4 cup and added 1 clove of garlic and it had such great flavor. Even the kids liked it and they hate eating fish thanks for the great recipe

It's absolutely correct when author says the secret's in the sauce.  Incredible flavor.  I will definitely use it in the future.

This was better than a restaurant!!!!  The only change I made was to use fresh ginger which I grated.  I used more than 1 teaspoon. I prepared it using the broiler because of bad weather and I can't imagine it  could be any better charbroiled.

To much soya sauce. I would put less next time, but it was good.

If you are a salmon lover then you will probably like this recipe.  I guess my family and I are not big salmon fans.

Simple recipe, but I felt the marinade overwhelmed the salmon. Lots of leftovers (very unusual for this salmon loving family) which we'll try in a salad.

Made it on our grill with salmon fillets.  It was delicious!  The charbroiled skin peeled off easily and the flavor was great.  It's a keeper.

I thought it was way to salty.  next time i will only use half a cup of soy sause and increase the red wine to a half cup.  Otherwise it was quick and easy.
