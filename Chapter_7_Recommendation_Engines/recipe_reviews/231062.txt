This recipe was so delicious and quite easy to fix on a busy schedule.    I used gorgonzola instead of feta.  I would definitely make this again!

Our family liked this one a lot, mostly because it's easy, homemade, and quick. Plus you get veggies in your diet. Nice recipe to have around for when you know you won' have a lot of time to prepare something. The dressing went well with it

I cooked the ham in the oven. I also added cherry tomatoes, mushrooms and green peppers in the same pan with the ham. I don't think the dressing tasted special, I think any balsamic dressing would taste good.

This is so simple, fast and easy. I'm in a small village and local grocer didn't have feta, so I used some cottage cheese. It was fine, but I know feta would've been much better.

This was a good way to use a small amount of ham.  I loved all the idea of it, but the dressing didn't quite work for me.  I thought the acid was too much and needs a little tiny bit of sweetness to match the sweetness of the ham---maybe a dab of honey or brown sugar.  Otherwise, this is a nice salad.  I'll try it again because I love ham in salads!
