Had just the right amount of sweet maple flavor, even without the maple sugar (had to sub brown sugar).  FYI, this recipe will give you about 2 cups of granola.  Enjoyed this morning as a delicious topper on my breakfast yogurt.  Thanks, AliRose, for sharing.

Very good.  My granola took a bit longer to brown, though, but that may be my oven.

Excellent. I replaced honey with agave and, while I'm not sure I'll do that specific switch again, it worked.  The large coconut flakes were decadent  and will be a staple in the granolas I make in the future.

I used just regular light brown sugar instead of maple sugar and baked it for 25 minutes, and used an 8x8 pan...this stuff is amazing!!

I was excited to try this because I love anything maple flavored. Especially after reading the first review which maintained that it had great maple flavor even without the maple sugar. So I was disappointed to find that it only tasted of cinnamon, though the flavor was very pleasant. I also found it far too sweet. I've made many granola recipes and the proportion of sweetener to oats is much higher in this recipe than is typical. 275 degrees for the allotted time also resulted in over browned granola.
