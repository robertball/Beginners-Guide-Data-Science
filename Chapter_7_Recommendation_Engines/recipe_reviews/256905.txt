I liked it.  The mayo and garlic sauce was a nice twist.  And I didn't go too heavy on the jerk seasoning since I have a lot of sensitive eaters in my home.  But I liked the flavor and will make it again.

I will definitely make this again and again! Love the combination of flavor and easy to make. The only change I would consider next time is to increase the amount of caramelized onion.

This was just ok.  I am not sure what it was that that didn't make me love it.  It might have been the combination of pineapple and seasoning with the cheese.

This is a new family favorite.  My kids loved it with the big flavors and especially with the crushed pineapple on top.  I will be making this again to the request of myself and the kids.

I'm usually very picky about my hotdogs, but I decided to go out of my comfort zone and try this recipe. It was different but not in a bad way. I probably couldn't eat these all the time, but it was a nice change. We liked that the flavors melded together in an interesting way. Super tasty, we will be trying this one again!

I thought this was just ok and hubby didn't care for them at all. Maybe it was the pineapple, but can't really pinpoint what we didn't like. This was fun to try for something different though...Thanks for sharing. :)

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe, although we both agreed that the overall flavor tasted more Asian than Jerk. We used high quality dogs and used Cajun seasoning as suggested. Each element was singly tasted and beautifully complimented each other. The Ball Park Buns are truly the way to go! They have become our all-time favorite vehicle for hamburgers, hot dogs, and beyond!

MODS, based on what I had on hand: African berbere seasoning in place of jerk; chopped canned mango instead of pineapple; shredded Colby/jack instead of plain Jack cheese. This is such a creative, refreshing take on the basic hotdog! I love the garlic-mayo mixture, and the spicy-sweet combination of the seasoning and fruit. I will say I used WAY less mayo and cheese than the recipe called for, probably half the mayo and a third of the cheese. As written, each hotdog would have used about 4 t. of mayo and 1/3 c. of shredded cheese, which seemed excessive.

This really turned out well. Since it was optional, I left off the pineapple and did everything else as instructed. I found the slight sweetness of th mayo was a good balance wit the seasoning. Will make these again!!

I thought the pineapple would be weird of overpoweringly sweet, but the mayo and cheese actually really balanced the taste out! It was honestly flabbergasting how good this was actually!

These were pleasantly good! They weren't as spicy as I would have expected. I do like the idea of splitting the hot dogs and grilling them. I think next time I would slice the onions into thin rings, leaving them whole.

These hotdogs were really different in the way they were split, and cooked, and the types of toppings I have never tried before. To my surprise, I actually liked the pineapple on top. It made a good compliment to the saltiness. I used the signature seasoned Ball Park Hotdogs. They are my favorite since trying them. I have never tried jerk seasoning and wonder if there are not different versions of it. The one I had, had a strong fennel flavor. I like the idea of caramelized onions but would try a different seasoning, next time, or none at all. I also think an aged cheese, or stronger flavored cheese, might have stood up to the strong flavor of the onions. I liked the idea of toasting the bun, but mustard would work fine for me over mayo. Though, I did try it first with the condiment suggested. Maybe, I am just a traditionalist. I would like to work with this recipe and see what I could come up with. The hotdogs and buns were great, as usual, though, for the warm weather and grill.
