I downloaded this recipe with intentions of having it for Xmas breakfast ...oops, it didn't happen.  But I had to use the ham I bought or chuck it; glad I used it!!  Even my picky 12 year old daughter gobbled it up.  You can use slightly less ham to make it less salty.  You don't have to use the hot pepper sauce if you have kids eating.  It's loaded with flavour +++ with no weird ingredients that might make kids turn their noses up.   Oh, and you DON'T have to worry about letting it sit AT ALL ...that part of the recipe is only for Xmas Eve chefs who want an easy meal the next day.  YUMMMMMMM ...this will be on the table next Xmas breakfast.  SOOOO good!

Wow, I cut come corners (did not do layers, added parm to top of casserole) and I am very impressed!  I added cayenne to the flour mixture.  Really fluffy and delicious.

There is no way to mess up this recipe.  No matter what you do, it's still going to be yummy!  I needed a recipe to use up 1/2 a loaf of white bread and some  deli ham.  I had 1/3 loaf of Velveeta, and a chunk of Mozarella, plus some grated Parmesan.  I spayed a glass 13x19 with Pam, then put it in the oven with 1/4 cup of butter to melt before adding the rest of the ingredients (didn't add more butter).  As someone else said, layers not really necessary.  Let it sit 10 minutes after making before putting it into the oven @ 325* (with a glass pan, it will get too dark on the bottom  if you set the oven to 350*).  We had it for dinner with the Lemon Butter Broccoli from this site, and fresh sliced tomatoes.  The cheese was yummy and the eggs made it custardy.  Ummmmmm!  The whole family loved it!

I prepared this recipe for my large family at Easter brunch. I changed it just a little bit by adding pancetta in addtion to the ham. My picky brother who wont eat anything, eventually gave it a try, he then went back for seconds! Everyone loved it and it's simple to prepare. Fabulous!

This recipe went over well at a bridal shower brunch.  I'm not usually sensitive to salt, but I found this to be a bit salty.  I did not have enough cheddar this time, so I added in a little fontina to the cheddar mix...That was a great substitute since fontina melts so well.  

Next time, I will make sure to use low-sodium ham.  I will also add a vegetable like spinach, onion, or mushrooms. It's a keeper though.

This was a very good recipe, although it was a bit salty.  I was worried about the large amount of ham called for, especially since I was feeding a group who is trying to watch their salt intake.  I found a turkey ham product that had half the sodium but the dish was still salty, maybe because of the cheese.  It was extremely tasty and lighter than expected.  Would make again (will try a reduced-sodium cheese).

I made this for Easter Brunch.  Making this ahead of time makes it easy to spend time with the family and not in the kitchen.  Even the "picky" eaters loved this.

This was excellent. I did make a few changes-added more eggs, and less milk. I combined 9 eggs, and 2 cups of milk. It served 6 adults. Made Hash Browns for a side.

I love this recipe and have made it quite a few times.  At first I layered it as written but I don't bother anymore.  It doesn't seem to make a difference.  I bake this for an extra 10 minutes to make sure there aren't any squishy pieces of bread left.  This freezes well after it has been cooked.  Very delicious casserole!

This was very, very good.  I made almost exactly as the recipe called for. The only difference was that I made it for dinner, so it didn't sit overnight & the bread wasn't day old.  It was still absolutely delecious!

This was a hit for Father's Day Brunch.  I added a few more dashes of hot sauce and a extra teaspoon of Mustard Powder as well as a chopped onion.

I made this casserole for Christmas morning and everyone loved it so much I'm making it again for Easter.  I used half and half instead of milk and added onion.  It turned out great.

Tastey, but I think I would prefer more bread, less milk to egg ratio.
Used multigran bread (dried in oven instead of day old), 1 c black forest sliced deli ham (chopped), 1 c grated instead of cubed cheddar.  Too much butter for my liking.  I think the serving size is off, I think it yields 4.  Instead of adjusting this recipe next time, will probably try "Egg-ceptional Egg Bake" or "Bake Brunch Omelet"

Unbelievably delicious.  My husband made with our leftover ham and the taste is great!  He used about 1/2 the butter and that was still more than enough!

I took this to my annual office breakfast. It was a total hit. People who don't normally eat ham or eggs, loved it. I did a couple of things different than the  recipe; I did not have mustard powder, so I used about a TBSP of prepared (reg) mustard. Also, I did not make this until the morning of. I let it sit at room temp for about 30-40 minutes before cooking. Turned out wonderful. Making again this weekend for family that's coming into town. YUMMY!!!

Tasted good, but didn't fluff up as much as I'd hoped.  Next time, I think I'll use regular white bread rather than the day-old french bread loaf.  Also- cooking time is short- I added an egg only, and it wasn't done after an hour- needs probably an hour 15.  Tasty thought- I'd like to try it again!

I made this recipe today for Easter.  It was VERY good, although more of a breakfast/brunch than a dinner/supper recipe.  I did not find it to be any saltier than I expected, as some other reviewers did.  If you like baked ham then you will most likely enjoy this!

I made this recipe for a faculty breakfast at work and it turned out great. I did not realize, however, that it was supposed to sit overnight when I printed it, though, so I had to make a few adaptations. First, I used fresh French bread instead of day-old, so it wasn't quite so dry and didn't need as much soaking time. I also felt that the three cups of ham looked like A LOT, so I made mine with three cups of milk and six eggs instead of four. Finally, I let it sit for about an hour before putting it in the oven. I was also concerned about the massive amount of bread and ham burning on top, so I actually baked mine covered in foil for the first 45 minutes, then let it get golden brown on top uncovered for the last 15 minutes. 

One caveat - I think the butter drizzling is probably completely unnecessary. The cheddar and the ham seem to have plenty of grease on their own and I felt that the top looked a little greasy after baking. Next time, I will probably skip the butter. Otherwise, it was a great recipe and a big hit at the breakfast!

We enjoyed this casserole. I made a few variations and baked it 90 minutes after I assembled it and it tasted great.  I used 1 1/2 cups evaporated milk and 1 1/2 cups water because I was out of milk. I also added diced onions and diced bell peppers for some veggies and extra flavor. I used a Mexican cheese blend and it was tasty. I'll definitely be making this on a more regular basis.

Made this for Easter brunch and it was a hit. Did not change anything and everyone loved it. However, I would bake it 10-15 minutes longer next time to dry it out a bit.

Maybe I didn't cook this long enough...or maybe this just wasn't something that suited us - but I made this casserole for Christmas breakfast and nobody really enjoyed it (fail!) The texture was a bit weird...too moist for us and the flavor - although not bad - had no wow factor.

picky 3 yr old daughter loved it. i halved the recipe and omitted the melted butter and parmesan. it was salty enough without it. i used cold cut ham. next time i would use 1 or 2 more eggs. it was very light and i wouldn't mind it being heavier. you could add a little broccoli.

I made this for Easter Brunch and it turned out fabulous!  It tasted gourmet and was so easy!  The texture of the eggs and bread was light and fluffy. I added extra cheddar, but besides that, I followed the recipe exactly!

I'm not a huge fan of ham, but everyone seemed to like it.  The only change I made was to add more eggs (7).  I also followed everyone's instructions and just tossed it all together in the pan. Added the parmesan and the butter on top before cooking.

Flavor was good, although I found there was way too much ham. Weirdest part was the texture.  It was well cooked, but still was just mushy bread.  A quiche would give you the same flavors without the wetness and it is much easier.  Not likely to make again, but might try using hash browns instead of bread.

Bland and mushy. Might be better if you reduced milk and/or added more egg(s) or bread. This will not be going in my recipe box...sorry Sheaslounge!

Everyone gobbled it up and asked for more. Made a few changes. Used shredded cheddar and Swiss mix. Did not layer. Only 2 cups of milk since I cooked it right after assembly and did not let sit overnight. I would consider adding sautéed veggies and poppy seeds go great with this flavor.

This is very good.  I made it and cooked it right away, and it turned out perfectly browned and flavorful.  I did substitute 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of light sour cream for part of the milk.  My family loved it.

This was fantastic. I made exactly as directed for my husband and I. He did say he wished the bread was toasted so the dish wasn't so "mushy", but I disagree with him and really liked the texture. The leftovers heated well too. Thanks so much for sharing.

I made this for a school breakfast and it was raved about. It is one that I will make again. 
 I did not make any changes to the recipe, but did need to a some more time to cook. Make sure you put something under the pan as well. I had a bit of an overflow while it was cooking.

This dish was OK as is.  A little soggy and not enough flavor for my palate.  I followed the directions as written.  I may try and make this again when I have leftover ham and add some garlic, onion, and maybe some pepper jack cheese and use a little less liquid.  I'll update my review at that time.  Thanks for a good base recipe though.

Very tasty! I followed some other reviewer's advice and increased the egg while decreasing the milk. I didn't make it the night before but baked it right away and it turned out great!

I modified the recipe to suit my taste and ingredients I had on hand. I used lactose free Swiss cheese and Lactose  free milk. I did not use the hot sauce recommended. I used butter to grease the baking dish but next time I will use Pam. This is a keeper recipe.

I left my recipe at our other house so this looked similar.  I must say it was quite good.  I like how you coat the ham and cheese with the flour mixture.  I've just been  sprinkling it on top and it never seems to soak it.  I also added some whole grain bread which seemed sweet to me.  My kids loved it as kids and are now making it for their kids.  Enjoy!

I made this for Mother's Day brunch and it was fantastic.  I used Gouda cheese instead of cheddar.  It had such great flavor.  I cut the Gouda cheese up into smaller pieces because it is a harder cheese and wanted to make sure it melted properly.

I prepared this casserole for a big mother's day brunch. It was so nice to be able to do all the prep and work the day before so I could just spend time with my mom and family the following day.

I did make a few modifications:
Butter- I left out all the butter because it just seemed easier and because I planned to load up on cheese. Instead I greased the pan with Pam cooking spray.
Mustard- At the last minute I realized I didn't have any mustard powder so I ended up adding a very generous tablespoon of strong brown mustard to the egg mixture. 
Ham- I browned the ham just a touch to add more flavor. Then let it cool and used as directed.
Cheddar Cheese- I doubled the cheese. I put a 1.5 cups in the mixture and another half cup on top just before baking.
Bread- I added another cup of bread because of the size of my pan and because I added significantly more egg.
Eggs- 4 eggs was nowhere near enough. I added 6 more for a total of ten. 
I was making another blueberry french toast casserole (also from this site, it was wonderful!) at the same time and it called for a dozen eggs. It seemed crazy to me that this one was so similar in size and yet only called for 4 eggs.This is the only reason I couldn't give this recipe 5 stars.
Everyone had seconds, and then thirds! This recipe was such a hit and I can't wait to make it again!
