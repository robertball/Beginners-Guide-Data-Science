These are my favourite snack!

However I also found they went soft after some time and so I asked an Indian friend of mine who was the first to introduce these to me, she said they are absolutely the best when dry roasted - and seasoned after cooking. So I tried them without the oil, and seasoned them when they were cooked and they were the best Ive had them. 

Apparently the oil keeps them moist longer and the salt holds the moisture inside them pea.

This works great for any legume, peas, beans of any description - my nieces and nephews eat them by the bucket load and they HATE peas and beans any other way.

A great snack for body builders or just anyone watching their weight - especially when dry roasted as it cuts out ALL the oil!

I've been looking for a high protein snack, and this is it. I tried a similar Martha Stewart recipe that called for baking at 300 degrees, but the chickpeas never dried out, even after being in the over for twice the recommended time. I decided to see if there was a similar recipe on Allrecipes.com, and I was so pleased there was. Once I raised the temperature to 450 for about 10 minutes, the chickpeas finally dried out, shrunk, and got crunchy, as they are supposed to do. As another reviewer stated, they do taste a little like corn nuts - a tasty snack but with a lot more protein. Next, I decided to try kidney beans, and they were good too, but some burned at 40 minutes. These I'll have to remove about 5-10 minutes sooner. These beans also split open at this temperature, but it does not affect the pverall taste. I plan on carrying these around in my purse from now on instead of pretzels for future snack attacks.

I'm obsessed with these! I make them several times a week. Here's the deal: I roast them at 400 degrees for a half an hour or so, shaking the pan a few times throughout. Then I toss them with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder and cook for another half an hour, also shaking throughout. They're way better if you add the oil halfway through, or else they don't get crispy and crunchy. They're so healthy and tasty this way!

What a great idea for a crunchy snack!

These came out really great.  I know some others have had problems getting them crunchy but mine really came out perfectly.  If they're soft in the middle, you need to roast them about another 10 minutes (based on mine).  I started with 20' on 350 and then went another 15' or so on 450 to get them nice and crunchy - they roast up and get small and nutty.  They didn't burn at all.  I used about 1TB oil and about a TB of curry powder and a few dashes of cayenne.

What a yummy and healthy snack!  I followed the recipe except that I added about 1 tsp. Worchestershire sauce as well.  I did find that 450 degrees seemed too hot.  The second batch I did at 350 and it turned out much better.  Didn't burn it at all and the beans dried out completely.  Nice to find a snack food that doesn't come with a lot of guilt!

When roasting chickpeas you definitely do not need this much olive oil! Try cooking spray instead.

I had the same problem as other with the chickpeas not being crunchy so i turned my oven off and left the tray of chickpeas in there overnight. This helped because all the chickpeas are now crunchy and not burned.

Really, really tasty.. I added in a can of kidney beans the second time I made them and they turned out well too! So yummy and highly recommended. 

I found 450 to be too hot though... I used my convection oven set on 350 and roasted them for about 40 minutes and they came out perfect. :)

I followed another cook's suggestion and dry roasted the chickpeas at 300 degrees for an hour, shaking them every 10 minutes or so. I then drizzled them with olive oil and added sea salt and garlic powder. I turned up the heat to 400 degrees for 30 minutes, shaking them every 10 minutes. They were super crunchy. My co-workers couldn't get enough! I'll definitely try them with cayenne pepper next time.

I used this recipe as a snack option, but i made it ahead of time, and stored in an airtight container, overnight, and had it the next day.I was so disappointed when i tried them, as the next day they were all soft and rubbery and had very little flavour.can anyone suggest why this may have happened and if there is a way of keeping them crispy and crunchy overnight?

I love roasted chick peas and I've tried to perfect the recipe over the last few years. For perfectly crunchy toasted peas,  I HIGHLY recommend starting with raw, dried chick peas (a little 1 pound bag nicely fills up a standard size cookie sheet).  You can soak them overnight or do a quick soak in 1.5 hours in hot water.  The result is SO much nicer - never a single mushy pea. With canned cps I always felt like I had to choose between burnt or mushy.  When I start with raw cps, I they're perfect every time.  I also do a 15 minute "pre-roast" with no oil or spices (I use a 400 degree oven), THEN I add my olive oil and spices, and then roast until they're perfect!

Very good snack!  I used salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Next time I'll definitely try the cayenne.  These were fabulous right out of the oven, but didn't really stay as yummy, at least not on a humid day like today...they lost their crunch.  I made a double batch, thinking they'd be good to snack on for a few days, but they're no where near as good today as they were last night.  But fresh out of the oven:  awesome!  So just make what you think you'll eat right away and enjoy!

These aren't perfect, but curiously compelling--possibly because I'm used to 'normal', bland chickpeas, and consequently fascinated by the concept of crunchy ones!  I flavour mine with soya sauce, chilli seasoning, paprika, garlic and herb salt, mustard powder, chicken stock powder and sesame oil... more or less!  I have to cook them at 180C for about 40 minutes to get them good and crunchy, but they're nice at the halfway stage too.  Great tossed through salads like croutons!

These are great.  I used less olive oil and a lot of cajun seasoning.  I discovered that starting them on a lower heat, 300, for about an hour and then cranking it up for 375-400 for another 30 mins worked best for really drying them out. 3 weeks later and they are still as crunchy as when I first made them. Just keep checking them, as they can go from perfect to burned in just a few minutes.

Yum yum YUM!! My roommates and I have officially decided that these are the best study snack out there! I did make a few alterations, hence the 4 stars, but really these things are over-the-top stellar. I had some dried chickpeas that I bought at a bulk store and I wanted to try them out. I soaked them for 24 hours, then cooked them about an hour on the stove until they were soft. I let them cool a bit and then spooned a single layer onto a baking sheet and dry roasted them at 350 degrees for 40 minutes EXACTLY. They came out crunchy and delicious! I poured on about half a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, added a few shakes of garlic powder and a bit of salt to taste and they were good to go! Thank you for this recipe!! No more snacking on chips for us!

Thank goodness these aren't bad for me!!  I've made three batches in the last three days - each time changing it up a little.  I think my favorite so far is a combo of onion and garlic powders, a little smoked paprika and kosher salt.  I mixed up the cooking times and temps as per some of the other reviews and what worked best for me was 365 for the first 30 minutes, then spray with cooking spray, add your seasonings, toss and roast further at 425 for 15-20 minutes.  Be sure to check and stir if necessary every 5 minutes or so during the final stage to prevent burning and keep them all evenly cooked.
SOOOOOOOOO good!

These are pretty good.  I probably roasted them (without any oil) for about 50-55 minutes at 400 degrees in an 8X8 glass pan, shaking them every 15 minutes toward the beginning, and every 5 minutes toward the end. 

I never used any oil to roast them.  I agree with another commenter--using olive oil at such a high temperature isn't good.  Olive oil has a low smoke point.  When it smokes, it will create free radicals, which, many argue, are harmful to our health.  If you want to roast these with oil at any point, I'd suggest safflower oil, which has a smoke point of 400-450.  If you want more on this, you can look at the World's Healthiest Foods website.

After they were finished, I let them cool for about 5 minutes.  I added some olive oil, then some salt, cumin, garam masala, cayenne pepper, and curry.  You have to add the oil first--otherwise, the spices won't stick to them as easily.  They are likely to be consumed rather quickly, which is why, I suppose, other recipes refer to these chickpeas as "popcorn"!

This is great - crunchy and healthy. I reduced the amount of oil I used, and just stirred them up really well. You could use any seasoning combinations you wanted with this - just add them towards the very end so you don't scorch the spices. Try it with curry powder, or wasabi, or dill and onion powder, or dry mustard, or ginger, or whatever your imagination can conceive. This would also be a great addition to homemade Chex mix!

I made a batch before reading the reviews. It was pretty good. The second batch was even better, because I dry roasted them at 400 degrees for 30 minutes before tossing in olive oil and spices. I used sea salt, garlic powder, curry powder, cayenne pepper, ginger, and Arizona Dreaming (Penzey's). I put them back in for 20 more minutes. Healthy corn nuts, who knew? Hope there's some left for hubby to try tomorrow....

Really love these.  One thing I make sure to do is to cover the top of the pan with foil poked with holes.  This prevented them from jumping all over my oven then burning like the first time I made them.

These were absolutely fabulous!  My family went through them quickly.  These are so easy to do in the toaster oven.  Made a few changes:  Did 2 cans, used salt, season salt, chili powder, garlic powder.  Dry roasted (no oil) for 30 min. then give tray a little shake to rotate chickpeas.  Put back in for 20 min.  Turn oven off.  Spray with oil then season.  Put back in oven for 15 min.  Definitely taste your chickpeas after seasoning.  You might need more than you think.

SO YUMMY!!!

I followed others directions of dry roasting first for 30 minutes, then seasoning and then roasting for 10, turn off oven and let sit for another 10.

Love this recipe!  I was craving potato chips, and after I found a can of chickpeas in the cupboard, I decided to give this a try.  Based on all the other reviews, I used one can of chickpeas, three different ways just to see what happened.  I think I agree with the reviewers who said to dry roast for a little while, before tossing with olive oil/etc.  This is definitely a great basic recipe that I can experiment with different flavors/seasonings.  I tried adobo seasoning (which was a little too salty for me), as well as attempting a Panko coating (didn't work so well) and lastly, I added a little Worcester, garlic salt, and dashed of cayenne, cumin, and paprika, to the olive oil (which I loved).   

Extremely versatile recipe that is flexible around personal preference/tastes, and variances in ovens/cooking time.

Very good recipe. I did take some time to pull off the "skins" of the garbanzo beans after rinsing and toweling dry. I agree with most that 2 TBSP olive oil is excessive. I used maybe 2 tsp at most. Added 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp cayenne -- I love the spiciness this lends. I lowered the temperature to 400, and added an extra 20 minutes of cook time so they could dry slowly. I found it was crucial to mix the chickpeas around on the sheet every ten minutes so they cooked evenly. Mine came out very crunchy, spicy and tasty. Great snack!

I used canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed them, then placed them in a foil baking pan.  Roasted them in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  I took them out of the oven, sprayed them with cooking oil spray and sprinkled some sea salt over them.  I put them back in the oven, lowered the temp. to 350 and baked for another 30 minutes.  They turned out crunchy for me.  I just used salt, but would like to experiment with different seasonings, I know you can buy seasonings for popcorn, maybe try that next time after they are all done in the oven.

These are a delicious snack!  I used a 15.5 ounce can and only used 1 Tbsp of the Olive oil.  I dry roasted for 30 minutes at 400 shaking every 10 minutes and then I added the olive oil, garlic salt, curry powder, cayenne pepper.  I also moved it to the bottom rack and baked another 10 minutes and lower the temp to 350.  These are addicting!  Nice and crunchy!

Amazing healthy snack.  I didn't even use oil, just tossed  the chickpeas in the spices and sprayed the cookie sheet with cooking spray.  Also added cracked black pepper and onion powder.  You MUST bake them long enough though, or they will be worthless.  Be patient!  You will know they're done when they are crunchy all the way through upon taste-test.  If they're even a little soft in the center they will not be good, especially after some time.  This took me about 45 min at 400F.

These are fabulous!  They just came out of the oven and I have to make myself stop munching!!!  I had some chickpeas in the fridge that I had recently cooked and I did not want them to go to waste.  So I dried them off while I preheated the over to 400.  I roasted them dry for 30 minutes and was certain to shake them arond every 10 minutes.  After the 30 minutes were up, I took the chickpeas out, sprayed them with e.v.o. in my mister, added garlic powder, cayenne and salt and put them back in for 10 minutes!  These are wonderful!  Thank you for posting!

Best snack! 5 stars when dry roasted. The first time I made these dry roasted I sprinkled a combination of spices on after they cooked and was left feeling a little foolish wondering why my spices did not stick ... toss chickpeas with spice before roasting just skip the oil.  Have fun using different spices and seasonings.

The recipe is a 4 or less on it's own, but a 5 with the advice to dry roast the chickpeas before adding oil or seasoning. I roasted mine at 350 for about an hour and 20 minutes, but I bet it could be done a bit faster at a higher heat. They're crunchy just like corn nuts! I let them cool overnight since I got busy, and made sure to leave them uncovered so they wouldn't try to pull in any moisture. In a ziplock bag, I tossed the beans with a couple tbsp of olive oil and 2 tbsp or so of ranch seasoning and baked them for 10 minutes at 400. Watch them so they don't burn! Also, I think I'll use a little more ranch next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I have actually never made this recipe as written, but I whole-heartedly agree with the suggestion to dry-roast the chickpeas and THEN toss with olive oil and seasoning. I usually cook them for about 30 minutes at 400 F, tossing once halfway through, but sometimes I'll leave them in the oven for longer, usually in 5 minute increments. That said, these are THE MOST ADDICTIVE SNACK. I use a spice blend of salt, garlic powder, cumin, paprika, and cayenne--about 2 tsp. total is a generous amount of seasoning for one can of chickpeas (which, by the way, usually some in 15 oz. cans). Absolutely worth trying, even if you aren't a fan of chickpeas in their slimier state.

I tried with oil and without and it's much better without oil.  I only put salt, nothing else, right before I stick them in the oven.  I drain and rinse the can of chick pea, but do not blot them dry, so that the salt will stick.  To prevent them from going soggy, don't put them in a small bowl (or deep one for that matter) if they are still hot.  It will cause them to release steam which will cause the bottom of the bowl to have softer chick peas.  Put them in small shallow bowls, or keep them flat in a layer until the cool, and they'll stay nice and crunchy.

The chick peas exploded in the oven! I suspect that they are sort of like popcorn - the internal moisture caused some of them to pop. I have about a dozen on my oven floor. Other than that, they tasted great. Next time I will try putting the oven at 350 and roast longer... this may eliminate the popping!

Wish I'd tried this sooner! I just took these out of the oven, plan to serve them on a salad instead of croutons. I used salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, and a dash of hot sauce, all mixed with the oil then tossed. I baked about 375 for about 40 minutes, but I started checking them at 30, then every couple minutes. Thanks for the recipe!!!

These are a great little snack when you want something besides nuts or seeds. So easy to make. Some reviewers had a problem with them not staying crunchy. Be sure they are COMPLETELY cool before you store them.

My kids and I love making roasted chickpeas, they are so tasty. They first time I made them, they were good, but a little moist. The second time I made them, I reduced the oil, and seasoned them after they came out. They were awesome! I now make this recipe at least once a month.

This recipe has the following faults:
* Olive oil has a smoke point of 180degC; the temperature is far too high.
* Temperature for a fan bake oven needs to be reduced.
* Recommendations for periodically stirring the chickpeas during roasting need to be made.

This recipe did not turn out well, for me.

I enjoyed this.  I used one tablespoon of olive oil and I probably could have gone heavier on the cayenne pepper.  I lined my baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.  Great for snacking.

These took a lot of tending but came out good. I did the suggested dry roast first. I started at 400 and they seemed to be doing fine but were soft inside after a long time and some started to burn.  So I lowered the heat to 250, removed them from oven, sprayed with the Misto and sprinkled with seasoning.  Finally got them dry throughout and today they are still nice and crisp.

Surprisingly very good. I didn't use oil at all, as per previous reviews. Just dry roasted and seasoned after cooking. Brown and crisp after 30 minutes. Added a touch of salt and curry seasoning. They didn't taste like chickpeas at all, just crunchy curry balls! Great finger food alternative.

Can't believe how great these taste!  Such a healthy snack for the entire family!  I followed other reviewers advice and baked for 30 min on 400 degrees before coating.  I then placed them back in oven for 10 min.  They did pop around my oven some, but I didn't want to cover them with foil as I'm afraid they wouldn't brown and get crispy.

I love these! I am really trying to watch what I eat these days and these are a great crunchy snack. After I took them out of the oven, I tossed them in a little bit of Ranch (powder) dip mix. Tastes similar to Corn nuts :-) Yum!!

I used home-rehydrated chickpeas since I was cooking some up for soup.  I put about 2T of olive oil, 2T Worcestershire sauce, a squirt of garlic powder from the container, about 1/2t pepper, and seasoned salt in a container, shook it up, then added about 2 cups of chickpeas, and shook it up again to coat. Baked for about 45 minutes at 350 until crunchy then sprayed with olive oil from my misto and a touch of garlic salt.  Yummy.  DH scarfed his down.

We call these poppers because they make a popping sound when they're done.  My boys love the taste.  We add cumin and chili powder and eat them as a snack.

SKIP OIL. DRY ROAST!   Check and stir often for even browning.  These just came out of the oven and we are burning our tongues. They are so delicious we can't wait for them to cool down. I don't think I will ever eat corn nuts again!

Low and slow is the best way to roast the chickpeas. I roasted them for about an hour and a half at 250 degrees (might take up to 2 hours at this temp). I dry roasted them with just a little cooking spray, moving them around every now and then. None were burned, they were all crunchy (no soft insides), and they stayed crunchy. Seasoned with a little cayenne pepper and garlic salt.

Another one of those recipes that I should have tried sooner.  I roasted the chickpeas dry at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  Then I sprinkled them with garlic powder and cayenne pepper and mixed in a teaspoon of bacon grease.  I turned the oven off and put them back in for another 30 minutes.  These are absolutely delicious and crunchy.  Thank you for sharing your recipe akcpa.

Loved this recipe!  I took the suggestion of Kelly and roasted mine without any oil.  When they were done, I drizzled them with olive oil and lightly salted them.  The only problem I had with them was once I started eating them, I could not stop!

I used several previous suggestions.  I dry roasted the chickpeas at 400 for 35-40 minutes, until nicely browned.  Then I removed them from the oven, turned it off, and lightly sprayed them with cooking spray and sprinkled them with garlic salt.  Then I put them back to sit in the oven overnight.  They were crispy and would have been tastier if I had sprinkled on more spices.  Will definitely give these another try.  They might be a bit crunchy for young children; maybe you could cook the chickpeas and not put them back in the oven, resulting in a slight softer texture.

watch out!  completely addictive.

i have found after some trials the best way to bake these is without the oil or spices for the first half hour then toss in oil and spices and continue roasting about 10 to 15 minutes until nice and crispy.  awesome snack!

Dry roasted as suggested by other reviews, then tossed with sea salt and a little bit of Mrs. Dash Hot flavor mix.  Terrific!

These were really good.  I didn't measure the olive oil, but I'm sure I didn't use 2 TBS, probably closer to 1.  I also added a dash of onion powder and a little pepper.  I cooked for 30 min, shaking the pan every 10 min to mix them up.   Mine turned out nice and crunchy.  Be sure to pay attention to the part about "Watch carefully the last few minutes to avoid burning."  I didn't and some time within the last 10 min, about 1/4 of mine burned.

These are sooooo good! I used less olive oil (maybe 2 teaspoons or so) and all the optional spices as well as some black pepper. Mine were done around the 30 minute mark (my oven is super hot), and I shook the pan about every 10 minutes to brown them evenly. I can't believe I didn't try these sooner. I just took them out of the oven and already I'm eating them, lol. This is such a healthy and delicious snack. I can't wait to try them with other spices as well. Thanks for sharing. :)

These are really good. I did as others suggested and roasted the garbonzo beans first for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Then I tossed them in a bowl with about 1/2 tsp of olive oil, season salt, garlic powder, & salt. Put them back in for 20 more minutes. They came out crunchy and delicious. Great recipe, thanks!

These chickpeas were for me, my mom, and my sister, so I wasn’t alone! I didn’t really help make them but I gave a lot of advice after hearing my mom read everybody’s comments. Basically we prepared them so quickly we didn’t have time to think. Fortunately all those extra steps are unnecessary. After we finished making them we looked how many calories and compared it to potato chips. In the most basic sense they are not the same. Right now the consensus is these are good, and easier to make than potato chips. They are good for camping. We don’t know how soft they will get because my mom said she got a soggy one and it was okay. But we just made them. We will make them again for my moms art club on Friday. She calls it an art club but nobody does art, they just drink.

After several attempts at this recipe, I think I found the perfect combination. 450 was way too hot and after 15 min in the oven, the chickpeas were burnt (plus I don't think you are supposed to use olive oil at such a high temp). They turned out the best when I put them in the oven at 350 for 30 min (no oil/cooking spray), then took them out, did a light spray and added the seasonings and stirred them around and continued baking and stirring, about every 5 min for another 15 - 20 min. I will keep experimenting with different seasonings just to keep it interesting.

My husband *loves* these even though I haven't been able to get the recipe quite right.  Olive oil and salt are not options for us.  The first time I tried these I used cooking spray as another reviewer had suggested.  Most of the Ceci still did not dry all the way through, but the ones that did were great.  On my 2nd attempt I dry roasted them as yet another reviewer suggested and even though I turned them several times during cooking, by the time most were dry some had burned.  On my 3rd attempt, I am going to try lowering the oven temp to 350F, dry roasting them, and adding the cooking spray and spices afterwards.  Although I am not following the recipe as written (dietary concerns) I gave this recipe 5*'s because my husband loves them (even the burned ones!) and the concept is great for a low calorie/high protein/guilt-free snack, even if I haven't quite perfected it yet.

I followed everyone's advice about dry roasting and then adding the oil and spices after they were cooked, and these turned out fabulous after 50 minutes at 400, shaking the baking pan every 15 minutes.  This is the first time that I've ever deviated from the original posted recipe, and I'm glad that I did!

Even at 400 degrees, my chickpeas were almost burnt on the bottom after 20 minutes. I finished them at 350 for 10 minutes. I seasoned with cayenne, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and Worcestershire. They were great. I'll make them again, at 350 degrees for the full time.

Addicting but really good.  I had a hard time getting consistency of doneness on all the beans.  Maybe I need to shake them around more or spread further apart.  beans on the outside cooked faster so I had to get a little out at a time which was annoying.  Still, I will make again.

Very yummy.  I cooked the chickpeas for 40 minutes than spiced them up with salt, pepper and olive oil.  Then I put them in the oven for another 10 minutes, checking that they didn't burn.  When they came out, they were crunchy and flavorful I couldn't stop eating them.  Don't think there will be any left by morning!

My kids kind of liked these but I did not care for them. They had a texture that just didn't work for me, quite grainy. Maybe I didn't cook them long enough? I might try again but don't see this being a regular snack at our house.

I used about 1/4 lb of dry chickpeas, which I had cooed, drained and refrigerated.  I tossed them with the suggested oil and seasonings and spread them on a baking sheet.  I started them at 450 for 10 minutes, but I could see the outside would be burnt while the inside remained soft, so I lowered the temperature to 350 and turned on my convection option.  I shook the pan a few times while they were cooking to turn them and get a even golden color and they were perfect at 35 minutes.  Very easy and very tasty.

I really like these! I had 1 can of Chickpeas so I split it between this recipe & Indian-Spiced Roasted Chickpeas. Both recipes had a different oven temp so I comprised in the middle with 425. I used a good quality granulated garlic, just a small dash of sea salt & cayenne. Stirred once. These are great! They came out crunchier than the other recipe.

I dry roasted these and seasoned afterwards with my homemade fry seasoning.  Pretty good, but after 25 minutes a third of these were burnt.  I'd definitely lower the temp next time.

I've tried this four times now.  I wanted them cruchy so I decided to lower the heat to 300 degrees for 30 minutes then turn it up to 425 to brown them. I also sprayed them with olive oil when I turned them up to 425, not before.  

And, I shook the pan every 10 minutes to try and make them dry out evenly.  That seems to help. 
When I take them to community parties everyone loves them (and we're not really a chickpea/hummus/good for you snacks type of group.  They like them spicey so I add cayenne and garlic powder to them after they're cooked. 

Great recipe.  Love it as a starting point for individual tastes and expectations.  You really can add any kind of spice that you like to suit your tastes. Thanks for a great recipe.

I've been making these for awhile as a South Beach Diet snack, but had trouble getting it just right. I found that roasting them for 20 min at 350 and then 15 min at 450 was almost right for me. I think next time I'll do 25 min at 350 and 15 at 450. I usually watch them and wait until the ones around the edge start to burn--then the rest are usually perfect! If done right they will stay crunchy for a very long time no matter how you store them.

Had to roast for quite awhile to get a crunch out of these but I do agree they reminded me of corn nuts as far as consistency once they were done through.  I wasn't thoroughly impressed with them first time around but I might re-evaluate after another try.

Changed it up a little: 1 Tbl of olive oil, sprinkled with Tony Cacherie's Cajun seasoning.  Cooked in toaster oven at 400 degrees for 40 minutes.  Very yummy!

These are awesome. I used 1 1/2 tbsp of olive oil and baked them at 400 degrees for 40 minutes. Then I added cajun seasoning and garlic salt. Yummy!! Great alternative to chips or popcorn and much healthier!  Will make again!

Mine burned.  Will try again sometime at a lower temperature, but I used all I had.  They were already burning after 30 min, but were still soft inside.

WOW I love these! I was so curious to try these so I finally made them, and I'll be making them again! I did take the advise from a review to roast them dry then add the oil and seasoning - they were perfectly dry & crisp by 30min. I did use less oil 1tbsp, salt, garlic powder & cayenne - they are fantastic & addictive!!

I just realize I did not pat them dry. They were soggy for a long time so I baked them longer and some never got crunchy. The good ones went well with my toddler-aged kid and nobody else except me wanted to even try it. I did not mind eating them because they are proein-rich snacks.

Decent. I roasted then seasoned; no oil. I think the roasting time is about 40 minutes although you just have to try them until they're done. I let mine sit on the range above the vent for the oven until they crisped up (like crackers).

Good snack and high in protein!  I decided to just use cooking spray and it worked very well.  I seasoned with cayenne and lots of garlic salt.  I had a couple pop off the pan like popcorn or something, so look at the bottom of your oven when you’re done to clean up any stragglers.

These are amazing! I used 1 tsp of oil, salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder. I baked them for about 45 min. 
I threw them on the bottom rack while I was baking something else.
What a wonderful healthy snack for the whole family.

Tried these for the first time today. I have been thinking about making them for ages and super glad I did. My hubby and teenage son just devoured them right out of the oven. What a simple, delicious and healthier option for snacking. My oven cooks pretty hot so I turned the heat down to 400 degrees and did a total cooking time of about 50 minutes. Now that we know how much we love these, we are going to experiment with different spices. Thinking the next batch with have a bit of garlic salt and rosemary. We WILL be making these again. And soon too!

I dry roast these and then add about 1T of olive oil, and some salt and garlic salt after they are done.  My daughter loves them.  I made a huge batch and took them to a party tonight.   They were a huge hit.  I had several people who didn't know I made them comment on how good they were.  And when I was leaving and collecting my dishes, the host asked if they could keep the handful that was left, he liked them so much.  Great, healthy snack.

These are yummy and so easy to make.  1 can does not make much!  Next time will double recipe.  I only used about 2 teaspoons of olive oil and a little salt.  Baked on convection setting at 375 for about 35 minutes.  Then, shut the oven off and left them in while the oven cooled down.  Nice and crunchy, but not too crunchy.  Family liked them and will make this healthy snack again.  Thanks!

I agree with Kelly Bradshaw's comment regarding baking them dry. I actually burnt them the first time around. 30 minutes at 450 degrees was much too long (and I wouldn't consider my oven "powerful"). So just be cautious; I'll be baking my next batch in 15 minute increments still at 450 degrees. I used lemon pepper seasoning, and that was very tasty. I think this recipe will not only provide me with a high protein snack, but it will also give me the opportunity to try out different types of seasonings. Whoo-hooo!!!!

I followed other suggestions and dry roasted them first for 30 min at 400 in my convection oven then tossed with Olive Oil, salt & garlic powder and put back in oven for only 15 min and most of them burned!  Crispy yes, tasty not really.  Next time I will try lowering temp to 350...

I tried this recipe because I didn't want to gorge myself on chips any longer.  They weren't quite what I was after, so I tried a slightly different variation where you don't add the oil and everything until later on.  MUCH better.

I guess I'm the odd man out here, because I didn't care for these at all.  I also think they would benefit from a lower heat/longer cooking temp or, like some others did, start at a lower heat and the up the heat for the remaining time.  My chickpeas varied from burnt to undercooked.  I will not make again.

I have made this several times but always feel the need to revisit the recipe.  Glad I did as i read a review where they said to roast without the oil on it.....Huge Difference!   Super crunchy after roasting without anything on them and them sprinkling a little olive oil and spices (smoked paprika, garlic salt, crunched red pepper ) on after.  So good!  Did not cook for a full 45, more like 30.  Will make again with roasting longer .....I couldn't wait to eat them and now! they are gone!

450* Way too hot in my oven, after 30 min they were black.  Must be an oven temp thing.  Tried again at 400* and checked at 30 min and the dry roast process was okay.  Never thought my oven was better than mediocre but heat and time wise apparantly it is.  Not a problem with recipe, must be my appliance.

I cooked my Chickpeas early in the morning, using star anise and other Chinese herbs (bits of wood).

As soon  as the batch was cool and had dried off I got them in the oven , olive oil, sea  salt and herbs de Provence.
Utterly sensational, I had some as an aperative before lunch and found it difficult to stop eating them.
the Chinese herbs gave them a delicate twang.

Next time it will be with chilli flakes.

As suggested by someone else, I baked these first.  A few burnt, but that only added to the overall texture and flavor.  I also think that 2 tablespoons of olive oil is little too much.  For spices I used parmasan cheese, sea salt, onion powder, and cajun seasoning.   ****Update****  I made these again and this time they all burnt to a crisp.  So I made another batch and lowered the heat to 425.  Much better!

These went over really well with my husband and son.  I dry roasted the chick peas first, then mixed with oil and seasonings and finished roasting. Turned out beautifully and kept as long as they lasted, which wasn't long!  Will make again and looking forward to playing with different seasonings!

I used a recipe from a cookbook and then got on here to find some other variations. I roasted at 400 with 1 tsp olive oil, 1/2 tsp garlic & herb seasoning, 1/2 tsp cumin, & 1/4 tsp onion powder. The garlic & herb were bigger seasonings, so they completely fell off the chickpeas and burned. Other than that, mine turned out great! Next time, I'll try other reviewers' suggestions about dry roasting. I'm allergic to wheat, so these would be yummy in place of croutons, and they definitely satisfy the desire for a crunchy snack. I'm trying not to eat the whole can right now!

I tossed mine with pam cooking spray and roasted them for an hour @ 350 only because I was baking chicken at the same time. They came out perfect! Nice and crunchy. Next time I think I will try some different seasonings.

These are such a wonderful and easy snack! I am by no means a great cook but it was really fun to do small batches and play with different seasonings every time. My friends liked them a lot with dry hidden valley ranch dip seasoning. Also with garlic salt and crushed red pepper flakes. Great in a salad or just as a snack! Mine were done in 30 minutes.

These are tasty and easy. I dry roasted them without oil, and they turned out nice and crunchy. Excellent alternative to other, higher fat crunchy snacks.

A great healthy snack. I used one can, drained and rinsed very well. Patted them dry and placed on a baking sheet. I then poured a little EVOO on top and rolled them around. Baked at 420 for 20 minutes, then tured the temp up to 450 for a few minutes. Took them out and added garlic salt, cayenne and lemon pepper. They are so good!

An okay snack.  Here are the things I did differently . . . 1. I rinsed the chickpeas really well before I dried them on a paper towel. 2. Baked at 450 for 20 minutes and then took them out and tossed with 1 tsp olive oil and seasoned with garlic powder and whatever else I could find for seasonings. 3. Baked again for about 10-15 minutes (watch for burning) and they were done! 4. I tried to avoid salt when making these - always check the side of the can when buying beans of any kind, the salt content varies greatly with each brand! I found that La Preferida (sp?) ones were the lowest in salt at my grocery store.

Very good The directions don't say anthing about moving them around on the cookie sheet in the middle of baking, but I would suggest it. The outer ones got burnt, the middle ones were just right, and the very middle ones were a little underdone. But other than that, they turned out delicious! My hubby loved them, and now he hasn't stopped bugging me to make more for him soon! Very good!

WONDERFUL HEALTHY SNACK!! These reminded me of corn nuts and I love corn nuts! I did follow one of the other reviews and dry roasted them. I didn't use any oil or seasoning at first, then baked them at 450 for 30 min. I took them out and 1/2 - seasoned with cajun seasoning and the other 1/2 seasoned with a couple TBL of ranch mix. They started to get soft, so I put them back in the oven for about another 15-20 min. I shook them the entire time I cooked them about every 7-10 min so they wouldn't burn. They turned out really crispy. I will add these to my regular snack menu since they are so healthy and great tasting!!

Gimme gimme more! Addictive. I love chickpeas and crunchy things, so this is perfect. I followed the user's advice who said they roasted them at 300 degrees for a half hour, shaking the pan every ten minutes. I've made them twice now; the first time I waited to oil 'em up until they'd roasted for the half hour, and just pre-seasoned them using the moistness they already had from being in the can. The second time I oiled them and added the seasoning right away, and they did take a few minutes longer to get crunchy, but that was the only tangible difference. I also seasoned them a lot less the second time (went a little cayenne crazy on the first batch) and decided that I like them far better spicy. Both times I used garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning and salt, as well as the cayenne. Will most definitely make these again soon!

I just couldn't get the time or temperature adjusted right. I guess I was looking for something that was similar in texture to wasabi peas you can buy in the store, and this doesn't give you that. Maybe it will be ok with some tinkering, but I don't know how much food I want to waste trying.

I love chickpeas plain so this was great! I used left over chickpeas so I didn't have a full can and I did this in the toaster oven so it didn't take as long and they still turned out great. Very yummy!

Excellent,as is!  But, anyone who cooks should understand that a recipe is only a "blue print" from which we can easily modify to meet our personal dietary needs and taste. I may try different spices some time, just for fun... but the recipe is still a "5 Star"!

Made these 10-15-2014.  I followed advice from some of the other reviewers and first dry-roasted the chickpeas for 60 min at 300 degrees.  Then I tossed them with a teaspoon or less of olive oil and garlic salt and roasted an additional 15 min, shaking every 5 or so.  Very good!

This creates a great, healthy snack.  The only things different I did to modify was doubled the chickpeas and baked at the same temp for 90 mins.  Perfectly cruchy and yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm a recovering junk food lover and this hits the spot. It's got the crunch and saltiness I adore plus the kick of cayenne which makes them addictive. A+ for the ease and satisfaction.

I LOVE these!  What a great low fat alternative to nuts!  I am going to give them quick spray of olive oil next time to reduce the fat even further.  Taste like pumpkin seeds with the crunch of corn nuts.  Yum!

First of all, I seasoned these after cooking with Mrs. Dash Tomato, Garlic and Basil seasoning and that was good (I still used garlic salt before cooking). Only thing is, I didn't cook them for more than maybe 5 minutes and they started popping (as in popcorn-like popping). Is that supposed to happen or is it something I did wrong?

These did not cook evenly, some burned, some were still soft and others were just right; I cooked them @ the recomended temperature for the suggested time.  The only thing I did differently was that I dry-roasted them.  If anyone has any ideas on how to cook them evenly, please let me know cause I did enjoy the ones that turned out right.

My chickpeas burned!! I followed the directions and actually had them in the oven LESS time than directed because I could smell em burning. Not sure what mis-step I took, but obviously something. 
Too bad, because I love chickpeas!!

Didn't use oil, only dry roasted. Used curry, cumin, cayenne and garlic powder. Great idea, wouldn't have thought of it without this recipe. Healthy and tasty snack my buddy and I had with a beer instead of the usual nuts. Thanks

these turned out really well, after reading a review, i roasted them plain and then tossed them in the seasoning after they were done. super great snack, the only reason I rated them 4 stars was because i thought the seasoning listed was a little bland, may try with old bay seasoning next time. great snack though! i will be sharing this with friends!

These were way beyond what I expected them to taste like.  I drained and patted them dry on paper towels and tossed them with salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder and a little cumin.  I added no oil.  Baked at 425 degrees for 45 minutes and they were yummy.  I could have baked them longer to make them crunchier but this texture was fine.  Great snack!

These were great! I've never had roasted Chickpeas before but I love Chickpeas so these could only be delicious and they were! I had no trouble getting them crispy, turned out perfect! Cheers!

These were pretty good and very filling for a snack.  I used dried chickpeas that I had soaked overnight.  The first batch I dry roasted, that is no oil and a little salt.  I'm cooking at 7000 ft altitude, so that may be a factor, but they started exploding in the oven and the ones that popped up and fell down to the oven floor started burning, so I took them out early.  They were edible but not exciting.  The second batch I tossed with olive oil and my favorite seasoning combo.  I cooked 25 min. and they turned out great with no exploding.

These were okay.  But they sure made a mess in the oven.  They popped like popcorn and were all over the place.  How come nobody mentioned that?

I had the same problem as other reviewers - the chickpeas didn't dry out, even after a much longer time in the oven.  Next time I'll try dry roasting them.  But the flavor is nice, and the slight chewiness to the "roasted" peas was fun, too.

I love these and make them all the time!!  I roast mine at 375 for 30 minutes on a baking sheet, take them out and give them a good shake to mix them up and then bake another 30 minutes.  I mix up my variations of spices.  I've used lemon pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, greek seasoning, various Mrs. Dash seasonings, just whatever I'm in the mood for at the time.

Great alternative snack to crackers and chips. I took the advice of other reviewers and did a dry roast (no olive oil) and seasoned with garlic salt and salt after it was taken out of the oven. I cooked 20 min at 350 and 15 min at 450. Some chickpeas were soft a few others were crunchy. I'll need to play around with this until they are all crunchy.

Read the reviews first.  Sprayed a tiny amount of non-stick spray on the pan first and roasted them plain.  Salted them while hot.  Very good.  15 oz can doesn't make very much.  2 cans should fit well on a roasting pan.

I was going to give this recipe a 4 because I felt it called for to much oil. However, after the first taste, I changed my mind! My family loved them; several who HATE chickpeas were eating them by the handful! They were gone in minutes. I think I will try them with ranch dressing mix next time as another reviewer suggested. Thanks for a great and fun recipe!

As suggested by another commenter, I used cooking spray instead of oil and seasoned them with garlic salt after they were done cooking. I had to cook them slightly longer for all of them to turn out crunchy, but my hubby and I both enjoyed them and I'll definitely be trying them again in the future with different seasonings.

They were chewy in the middle, but that's ok since this is the first time I eat toasted chickpeas. I wasn't totally crazy about it but I'm on a diet where I have a veggie day and this was a great source of protein. I'll make it again and season it differently to see how it turns out. I used garlic powder and salt since I didn't have garlic salt.

Awesome!!!!!!I soaked dried chickpeas in the fridge overnight, then boiled/simmered them for like almost an hour. I let them cool then cooked them on 400 (per other reveiwers suggestions)for over an our. They took FOREVER to finish cooking! Once they cooled though, they turned crunchy and VOILA, I had an amazing snack! My 4 year old and 2 year even loved them!! I used olive oil, sea salt, garlic salt, onion powder and a smidge of cayenne! My hubby and I are snaking on them right now!

I wasn't able to get a consistent texture.  Some of them were dry all the way through, but some were still chewy in the middle.  Not very tasty.

The first batch did not work out for me - needed more spice and did not get crispy enough.  The second time I thought I'd play around with the seasonings - used combination of Chinese 5-spice , garlic powder, and a little salt and pepper, decreased temperature a little to slow roast and used less oil - in fact, I just sprayed them with canola spray, once at the beginning and once half way through.  This batch came out better texture-wise, but I still need to play around with seasonings to suit my taste.   I will probably skip the 5-spice powder next time also, and go for something with more heat, less sweet.  I also like the suggestions to try other beans and will do that sometime also.

Really good!  I followed other recommendations to lower the cooking temperature, and they came out well.  I'll have to experiment with different seasonings next time I make them.

I tried this out this afternoon (adding some onion powder, cumin, oregano and a drizzle of sesame oil), and while the flavor was delicious, the beans didn't get crunchy... they were crisp on the outside but still soft on the inside. I will DEFINITELY make this again, but follow other's advice and reduce the cooking temp (as they browned very quickly at the high temp but didn't dry out). I may also try someone else's suggestion of adding kidney beans next time- sounds lovely! (and so much cheaper than nuts!)

As a strict vegan it can be hard to find good snack foods. I love this one though. It is very good and easy to make. Like others I did not use as much Olive oil. I used only 1 Tbsp.

My kids also love this as a snack food and I like that it is healthy and full of protein!

I've tried this recipe a couple of times with different seasonings; my favorite is with a curry-type blend of spices.  They're done when the color has darkened, and the beans have shrunk - about 30 min for me.

I wasn't sure how to tell if they were done, but I needed to do mine longer.  A few were crunchy but most were not, so I will know to roast a little longer next time.  It's hard to tell if they're done until they're cool.  I used garlic powder, salt, and chili powder.  Nice flavor -- reminds me of soy nuts.

I had high hopes given rave reviews, but for me these were just "okay." Made them without any changes to the recipe - got some slightly soggy-in-center chickpeas. Might try again using advice from other posters re: roasting at a higher heat. Seasoning was tasty though.

I just finished making this dish using  a 28 oz. tin of chickpeas.  I followed Amanda234s suggestion about baking them dry first for about 25 minutes at 400 degrees and then taking them out and seasoning them.  I only used 1T of olive oil, kosher salt, freshly cracked black pepper, granulated garlic, pinch of cayenne and cumin to taste.  Put them back in the oven for about another 25 minutes at 400 degrees.  Got the thumbs up from my 17 year old.  As when I make homemade croutons, these will not be put away but will be left on the counter  to snack on whenever.

1 can of chickpeas, rinsed and blotted dry, at 400 for 30  minutes, shaking every 10 minutes... add a few dashes of worcestershire, seasoning salt, and garlic powder...
back in the oven at 375 for 30 minutes, shaking every five minutes... Stir. Turn off oven, leave in for 20 minutes. Yum! Thanks for sharing!

Changed it as follows: 2 cans chickpeas, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp cayenne, 1/2 tsp salt.  Drained and rinsed and then dried the chickpeas in between paper towels, coated in oil & seasonings, roasted at 400 for 20 minutes, took out of oven to let cool and dry for 15 minutes, roasted again for about 20-ish minutes until crunchy.  Let cool.

gave 4 cos not a huge fan, but need to still keep working at recipe to find right flavors.
drained chickpeas in colander then put them on a doubled paper towel to dry.  did oven at 400 degrees for 30 min, sprayed with Pam olive oil, added garlic powder, then cooked for 20 minutes more.

Next time I would try 375 degrees for 20-25 minutes, add (just barely cover) honey and cinnamon, then cook for 25 minutes more.

These are great, and with enough cayenne pepper, they taste a little like hot fries.

First off, I think that the temperature is too high.  After about 15 minutes of roasting they started popping and about 6 jumped off the pan into the bottom of the oven.  After I got them picked up, I reduced the temp to 425.  That seemed to work much better.  They turned out wonderful.  I will have to make a double or triple batch next time too keep up with the demand.  I will also try different seasonings and spices next time too.  Yum!!

The chickpeas had too much oil added to them, they were only in the oven for 20 minutes at 450  degrees and they had shrunk a lot. They were burned and pretty flavorless. Would I make these again? I would try. Honestly, tweak this in the temperature and maybe they would be better. I might try the recipe again, but I'm not sure it's worth it.

I made the recipe using garlic salt, cumin, cayenne and black pepper and found that another 10 minutes in the oven was needed to make them crunchy. Even with the liberal use of spices, I found it difficult to get much flavor on the peas. They reminded me of half popped popcorn, but had less flavor. If I make these again, I might try bacon drippings a pinch of sugar and dried dill.

I only had a small can, I added some EVOO, homemade taco seasoning and baked at 425 for 40 minutes, and they were chewy, so I lowered to 300 for 1 hour, then turned oven off, let them sit for 2 hours while I went shopping. They needed some garlic salt...yummy! Hubby does NOT like chickpeas, I made him taste ONE...he liked it but he doesn't trust me (we've been eating healthier for several yrs!) I haven't and won't tell him they're chickpeas! lol

Four words: simple, delicious, healthy and easy. This snack is a hit every time it's brought out to the table! I made these the day before Thanksgiving to snack on while I started cooking through out the next day and found myself not being able to stop. Even though the garlic salt is listed as 'optional', I highly recommend adding it - even in place of just regular salt. I added the cayenne as well since I can't get enough of spice. Trust me, you are going to want to make bags and bags of these!

I did not need to bake these nearly as long as suggested, more like half the time given. These would be great for snacking and salads. Next time I want to try 2 or 3 cans of chickpeas at once.

I took them out after 30min because it looked like they were done...but could've used the extra 10-15. The inside was a bit soft. I also did the dry roasted method. I used a tablespoon of coconut oil, cayenne, sea salt, and a little sugar. Taste is good. I used the canned chicks for my first try. Will definitely use this recipe again. The possibilities are endless when it comes to flavor.

That is entirely too much oil.  I make these tasty little snacks all the time, but I use 3 cans of rinsed and dried beans and 1 1/2 tbs of coconut oil.  I change up the seasoning but the most common trend is garlic powder, cumin and habanero salt.

I decided to do a test-run prior to Super Bowl.  20 minutes at 450 was no good.  A few burned, some were crunchy, and some were still soft.  I'll try lowering the temp and stirring them occasionally for a more even result.  Seemed like 2 Tbl. of oil was too much so I'll cut down on that, too.  I'll have to try again and tweak the temp and baking times for a better outcome.

I really wanted to like this recipe.  Maybe I chose a bad brand of canned chickpeas.  I did not like it at all.  No very flavorful, despite the seasonings ... I tried a savory and a sweet recipe.  Definitely need to cook for a long time to get the crunchiness.

This is one of those things you either love them or hate them. I try to add as much spice as possible to give them a good kick and they replace a salty, crunchy snack like potato chips for me--obviously these are much healthier than chips. However, when I put them out at a party they were no match to the tortilla chips with salsa--just a fact of life! But if you are watching your weight I would definitely recommend making these and keeping them on hand for any salty cravings you may have! I made 4 cans (since I find you have to cook them about 1.5-2 hours to get really, really crunchy) and they have lasted just fine for the last three weeks!

These are very good! I did sea salt and garlic powder on mine. I also found 20-25 minute ate 450 to be plenty. My oven runs hot though. I had to take my smoke detector down momentarily because the olive oil caused a ruckus, but other than that- these are very good!

I thought this was an incredibly easy snack to make that is so good for you! I added jerk seasoning (powdered rub) and it gave them a kick- I did find the odd soggy chick pea but for the most part mine were crunchy- even my picky 5 and 7 yearolds asked me to make them again!

My batch came out half crunchy, half chewy/soggy, so I will try to dry them and use the tips others gave.  I loved the crunchy ones.  I will try curry powder next time.

This makes for a delicious AND healthy snack; the only change I made was to cut back the oil to 1 tbsp.  doing that also seemed to help make the chickpeas crunchy.  I'm definitely going to make these often.  thanks for the recipe!

Yummy - I was surprised how good they were.  So many possibilities with the spices.  I look forward to trying all variations.  The cook times seems to be something you have to experiment with.

Just a really great snack!! I added garlic salt, parsly and 1 teaspoon canola oil at the end. The peas turn in to sortof a nut.(b-f said they were like pumpkin seeds) My only complaint was that they all were different but I think that was my fault. It looked like they were gonna burn after 30mins so I took the heat off. Next time ill just watch them real carefully so they dont burn. Love this! thx!

Great taste and excellent source of protein! Just like other reviewers, I roasted first and then added the oil and seasonings. I used only 1/2 Tbsp of olive oil and it was way too much, next time I will use only a little olive oil spray instead.

I both followed the recipe and added the spices before roasting and I did a batch where I added them after. The pres-easoned beans did get a little soggy but they also absorbed more flavor. Alas, I burned both batches after only 35min.

I love these!  I keep them in a tupperware on my counter at all times!  After my gastric bypass surgery, I was needing something crunchy like a potato chip but can't have fats and sugars.  I also need alot of protein.  These have been a great subtitute for chips, pretzels and some of my other unheathy snacks.  I also made several batches in different flavors... cinnamon & splenda, cajun (I used Tony's cajun seasoning), curry, and so on!  So good!

This was a great treat! I waited to put oil on them until 15 minutes before they were done. I sprayed them with a little oil and then seasoned them. They were a delicious and healthy snack.

I made this on the weekend as a healthy snack for the family and it went over really well. I also didn't add olive oil and just dry rubbed the spices onto the chick peas before they were in the over and three days later, it's still as crunchy as the first day!

Fantastic and healthy! Oil and spices last do seem to work best. Also, another reivew mentioned trying other beans. They're great as well. Just don't try fava beans this way ... my entire house smelled like stinky feet for days!

I just tried this recipe and I have to say that these were pretty good.  My husband raised his eyebrows at me when he saw me making them, but now he won't stop eating them.  Even though he says they won't replace peanuts as a snack.  The garbanzo beans in the can I had in the cupboard were very tiny; about the size of peas, and I wasn't thrilled with the way they shrunk up.  I'm going to the store tomorrow to buy a couple of name brand cans (not the Walmart in-store brand I used) and give this another try. I'm hoping they'll be bigger.  Thanks for the post.  This recipe has some real possibilies!

My new favorite snack - and it's guilt-free!  I used cinnamon/sugar (and a touch of salt), but am eager to try this recipe with the ingredients suggested.  I baked ~1hr at 400 degrees.

I was sooo happy to find a way to make these without frying them. I was however a little disappointed regarding flavour. I will make them a gain but I think I will tweek the spices or add some tobasco sauce or perhaps wasabi to the mix. Also maybe it is just my oven but the cooking time should be more like 20 to 25 minutes max, mine started to burn way before the said cooking time.

I gave this a four because it might have been good if I had prepared it the way it said in the recipe. But I didn't want to use that much oil, so I didn't really use it at all, and I just seasoned them with chili powder and cumin before baking. I put a little olive oil on them after they were baked and sprinkled with salt. I  did what others said and roasted on a lower temp for a while, and then increased the temp for the last couple minutes. -
these were okay, but when I look back on how much time went into this recipe, it wasn't worth it.

What a great (addictive) little snack!  I love chickpeas period, so when I saw this one I thought it was a great idea!  Like others suggested, I roasted mine and added a splash of olive oil at the end along with some cayenne and some herbed sea salt, yummy!  Really nice kick with the cayenne and the seasoning options are endless!  Will definitely make these again, but need to play with the temp/cooking time, 450 for the whole time seems a bit high as a few burned while some others weren't quite crisp yet.  Nonetheless, they're fantastic!

Delicious!  I dry roasted the beans first then shook them up in a bag with a very small amount of olive oil, cajun seasoning and nutritional yeast.  Gave it a great spicy cheesy flavor.  Yum!

I roasted them without oil for about 25min., then seasoned them with sea salt and garlic powder.  They were very tasty and a nutritious snack.  I wrapped the leftovers in foil in the refrigerator, and they stayed nice and crunchy.

This idea is really versatile. I've had better success doing a few things differently. I roast the chickpeas without the oil - crunchy is definitely WAY better.  Don't just stick the basics. I used a Parmesan italian blend on one batch and tabasco flavored seasoning salt on another. Add about a 1/4 of a teaspoon of oil to a gallon sized press & seal bag followed by the chickpeas. Cover the chickpeas in the oil first then add the spices. YUM!

These are a great idea, but the recipe definitely needs tweaking. I did add worcestershire, which gave them a nice flavor. The cooking time is something that I'll need to play with... I tried cooking at 350 for 30 minutes, but they were still moist inside, so I put them back in on 450 and 1/2 of them burned. Oops. I might try dry roasting them next time, as suggested by another user.

This was so easy to make and really delicious as a side dish. I make this at least once a week as a side to something. I usually add a tablespoon of minced garlic.

A nice alternative to chips and such, but a little bland. I'll definitely kick up the spices a bit next time. Like previous comments, I baked them at 350 deg for awhile, then turned it up to 400 for the last several minutes. Watch it closely; these can burn quickly.

Good flavor, but I agree with Ciara. The recipe should state that they need to be eaten right away or given a suggestion on how to keep them crisp.

My daughter, who doesn't normally eat any kind of bean, ate almost the whole can of garbanzo beans that I made using this recipe.  She doesn't eat meat either, but at least now I can susbtitue this in for some protein for her.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I would suggest using less oil, and I seasoned mine with Cajun seasoning- they were delicious...I started watching them a few min before the suggested time, but still had a few burnt ones...just keep an eye on them and stir them once or twice.

Great snack, though I would alter the seasonings.  Powered ranch dressing or a chile and lime combo would be tasty.

very tasty, uber-easy, and inexpensive!!  i too played with the seasonings, but i think the more important thing is to just get the chick peas a little crispy.

These are great.  You don't need as much olive oil as stated--just a few spritzes will do.

This was really different and good!  I used olive oil, and Cavendars Greek Seasoning, along with just a bit of cayenne pepper to give it a bite.  I did stir the peas on the cookie sheet every so often to help them brown more evenly.  Unique and delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

This was  very unique and tasty.  We seasoned with a little cayenne pepper and garlic salt.  At 20 minutes in the oven they were done, so watch the time if you have a hot oven.  Will make again and experiment with different seasonings.

30 minutes at 450 will burn them badly and smoke up the kitchen. Way too hot and way too much olive oil.

Very good, made as directed. Except used Zatar, Aleppo pepper and salt as seasoning. Used for salad topping and left over snack. They stayed crisp. Used  a large sheet pan lined with foil giving them plenty of room. Next time will try the dry method ( no oil) as this is what my husband thinks his mother did!

Very good!  I did do the dry roasting first at 350, for 30 mins. shaking every ten minutes.  I then seasoned them with olive oil, worchestershire, and onion powder.  Roasted them another 10 minutes at 350.  Very good, but could use more seasoning, so don't skimp.  Not sure if this is good for my diabetes, but I have eaten a half of a can already, yum!!!

Cook for less time and don't pat dry if you don't want them all the way crunchy, would make a good topping for a salad. Cooked as the recipe states is good for a healthy snack. I will make this again.

Interesting flavor. It was like eating nuts. Loved it. I like garbanzo beans so decided to try them roasted. Will make again. I did not use cayenne pepper, just the oil, salt and garlic salt with regular black pepper.

I rinse my chickpeas thoroughly with water in a colander, then thoroughly pat them dry. I use vegetable oil instead of olive oil. Also, I only use salt and pepper because I like to use them on salads or to eat them straight off of the pan.  My kids love to eat them as well.

Every ten minutes i shake the baking sheet to roll them around some, it helps to keep them from burning. but it was absolutely fantastic, another seasoning suggestion, Old Bay seasoning.

I did one  tbsp of oil and they came out great! I felt two was too much. I read another review and they mentioned they used no oil and seasoned while cooking. I will try that next time. Either way they’re great for a guy like me looking for a easy to make healthy snack! Thanks =)

This recipe came out good but I need to make some tweaks. I cooked at 450 for 30 minutes and they came out very hard almost not chewable. So next time I will try 400 degrees and I think it will be better. I just added turmeric, salt and pepper and just a slight spray of olive oil. Tasted great just too hard for me. I actually prefer them a  little chewy or slightly crunchy.

I followed the commenters’ advice and roasted the chickpeas plain for 30 mins at 400°. Then I added 1tbsp olive oil and spices.

I added .5 tsp salt, .5 tsp cayenne pepper, .5 tsp garlic powder, .25 tsp cumin, and .5 tsp chili powder. 

I think this recipe would go good with lime and garnished with parsley.

To add to my last review I drive roasted them at 3:50 for 30 minutes took them out of the oven and put them in a bowl added them one and ahalf teaspoons of EVOO, Salt, pepper, garlic powder & cumin (used what I had definitely going to try other spices) Mix them together in the bowl then add them back to the oven laid out flat again turned the heat up to 400 and continued to roast them for another 30 minutes after those 30 minutes I just shut the oven off and let it cool down for another 30 minutes… As you are roasting them every 10 minutes shake the pan around to Rotate them as they’re roasting. Even the next morning these were still nice and crunchy for the first time doing it I nailed ??it hope everyone else enjoys

I  made these according to the recipe except I decided to stir them after 15 minutes, and good thing too because by that time they were burnt on bottom and still soft on top. I'll have to try a different recipe for these.

Though very tasty, the temperature is too high to roast these without making a mess!!! The chickpeas started popping and made a huge mess in my oven. I suggest lowering the temperature to 375F to avoid the headache.

After reading the other reviews I cooked 10 minutes at 450- then 20 minutes at 350 and at the end 5 more at 5 minutes.  I used paprika, a little salt, cayenne spice and red pepper for an extra kick. Came out great! Will make again!

If someone tries this before me, please review.  When some of you get the dry, granular ham coating in the foil pouch, use that as the spices for chickpeas.  It should come out like honey roasted nuts.  I tried it once on nuts and it worked pretty well.

A little soggy. I was hoping for crunch. I could have towel dried the beans and or cook longer. I was afraid to burn them.

The first couple of times I made this I either cooked it too long or not long enough. This time, I stirred it after around 15 minutes and then let it cook another 15 or so minutes, and I think it turned out great!

Do not follow temp or oil amount. Half the oil, lower temp by at least 50 or even 100 degrees. 30 minutes at 400, 40 at 350. Doing it as described will result in mostly burnt chickpeas.

I've been eating this straight from the can my whole life until I found this recipe! WOW! I've been missing out. I didn't have any EVOO so I used cooking spray, I also added chili powder, garlic salt (instead of salt), cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes! So good! Thank you!

Really great snack (almost addictive!) but after my first try, I've followed some advices found in the comments section. I roasted the chickpeas without any flavoring for 30 minutes than I added salt/pepper/chili powder/Garlic powder and sriracha sauce and putted them back in the oven at 450 for another 15 minutes. At this point they where still a bit soft so I turned off the oven and let them cool completely in the oven, and voilà! Crunchy spicy chickpeas :P

I dry roasted them per others’ suggestions.   Then I sprayed with olive oil and sprinkled onion and garlic powders and sea salt.   I popped them back in the oven for 15 minutes and they were great.

This is a really great snack or protein for a meal. Make sure you roast them long enough to get that nice crunch. I haven’t figured out the exact time. I want to try this with cinnamon sugar some time, but haven’t gotten around to it. Another great Allrecipes recipe!!

These are delicious!!! To keep them crispier longer, I take the skins off and bake them for 15 minutes with NO oil. Then, I sprinkle them with olive oil and the spices I’m using and cook them for another 15 minutes. Then I turn the oven off, and leave the oven door open so they dry without burning. Delicious!!

I've made this twice today. The second time around, I got MUCH better results cooking for 50 minutes and marinating the garbanzo beans and spices with olive oil/lemon juice in a gallon size ziploc baggie for around an hour.

So tasty! I wanted them a little chewy to put on a salad, so I reduced the roasting time to 20 minutes.

Seemed that it was best to drain & blot chickpeas, then bake for 400 for 30 minutes, add 1 T olive oil and spices and then bake again for same time & temp. If still soft, keep in oven with temp off till crispy. Later in the day, I had to toast these bkz they softened. Will keep a can of chickpeas on hand to try again.

Roasted only for 25 min. I followed the directions without reading any reviews and next time I will really spice them up and may add a bit of honey. Overall awesome...

A simple and yummy recipe. I used canned and well drained  chickpeas. I tossed them with a tablespoon of olive oil and seasoned them with salt, pepper, and grated Parmesan cheese immediately after I took them out of the oven. A healthy snack I'll definitely make again! Thank you!

Made per the recipe and some came out soft. Next time shell them first as some of them were crunchy....guessing it was the shelled ones. Do not double....perfect for the 2 of us. Great substitute snack instead of chips.

Made it again and this time peeled them first..all are crunchy now! Keep an eye on the time towards the end and of course test one first. Added cumin to the spices too.

This is very gourmet, but I have a dehydrator. So I soaked fresh beans for over 8 hours first (since it's more ecological not to use cans in aluminum) and then I pressured cooked them for 15 minutes. Then I blotted them and added the oil and salt. I also used a lower heat 400* and moved them around at ten minute intervals. Next I added some spices w/vinegar, once taken out of oven. Now here's the catch: Since they don't stay crunchy unless warm, I placed them in my dehydrator for about 4 hours and 125*. This dried them out completely and they kept their crunch! If you have a dehydrator I highly recommend this last procedure because you will see the difference.

I followed another reviewer's advice and dry roasted them first.  They are crunchy and just what I wanted.  I used to buy dry roasted chickpeas at HEB when I lived in Texas and haven't found anything that matches up.  I think this recipe is the winner.

Followed other suggestions by baking at 400, not tossing with oil/seasonings until 20 minutes in but stirred every 10 minutes with a total time of 40 minutes.  Came out very crunchy but tasty!

I enjoy the flavor of chickpeas and when I took these out of the oven they tasted pretty good  and had a nice crunch. After sitting out for a few hours they got soggy. I  May eat them but won't make them again. I followed the recipe as written.

I didn't have special sea salt so I used regular. I tried to follow other's advice and dry my chickpeas a little bit on low beforehand. I betchya it would have been a five except for an epic failure on my part to crank up the oven after the initial half hour on low. I did my oil. spices and s&p, and put them back in to toast up and.... mushy insides after the alloted time. Aaargh. Next time, turn up the heat.

I made these with dry chick peas. I pressure-cooked them, drained and blotted them, then dried them in a 400 degree oven for half an hour. After that time I shook them and watched every 10 minutes until they were , for the most part, crunchy. I then sprayed them with cooking oil, sprinkled with salt, garlic powder and dry chipotle pepper, rolled them around on the cookie pan and let them sit overnight in the still-warm oven. First attempt: delicious! So glad I found this healthy alternative to other "road food snacks"!

I just made these, using the suggestions from other reviewers, and they turned out perfect.  I had bought a bag in the store and so I was excited to be able to make these myself and save myself some money.  I did as others suggested and cooked them at 300 for 30 minutes and then oiled them with coconut oil and seasonings for another 15 minutes. I felt they needed more seasoning so I went ahead and oiled them again and added even more seasoning (to taste) and cooked them another 10 minutes at 300.  I must admit, I have an industrial convection oven in my home so I think that enabled me to keep the temp at 300 (equivalent to 350 in a non convection oven) and helped to dry them out because the giant fan that is part of the convection cooking.  I will never buy seasoned chickpeas again and will forever be making my own.

In my toaster oven 450 @30min was borderline- some burnt, some mushy. Some olive oil and homemade BBQ dry rub- fantastic! Another batch at 350 for 45min- nailed it. These are so good I'll tell the kids when I make another batch.

I honestly don't know where I'm going wrong. I soaked my chickpeas over 24 hours to start. The first batch i baked time and temp written in the instructions. They burnt fast. The not so The remainder went to the chickens. The second time I tried, I lowered the temp for about 40 minutes. Then I turned it up and browned the peas to a nice golden color. Looked yummy...but they were incredibly hard.

Since I didn't have any garlic salt, I used salt and garlic powder instead. These were good and I would make this again. I did have to shorten the cooking time to about 22 minutes to prevent burning.

Made it this afternoon. Very good, very filling. 
There were both crunchy and soft ones in the mix (so maybe I did something wrong). Husband liked the soft ones and I liked the crunchy ones.

I did what another reviewer suggested and roast for about 45 minutes first, then added the oil and seasonings and roasted again until firm, using a stone pan.  So crunchy good and so inexpensive when compared to the store bought peas. Thank you!

I used blackened spice and some salt. I ran out of garlic. It's still delicious.

I made this and it was awesome! Thank you for the recipe! Only change he made was using regular bacon, sautéing the onions and celery in the bacon fat and added a can of sweet corn. Best chili I've had yet!!!

Tried roasting at 375 for 30 mins dry, then 30 mins with oil/spices.  next time will try 400 for 20-25 mins each time.  these nuts were quite hard the way I cooked them.  I think sneak attacking them with heat might make them lighter and crunchier?? I don't know.

I made these one night as a snack and I thought they were nice when hot but not as much when they cooled. My roommate on the other hand ate them all night and she loved them, she has asked me to make them several times.

I followed others' advice and baked them at 350 for 20 min, then turned it up to 450. Before 15 min was even close they started popping out of the pan, onto the heating elements, and setting off the smoke alarm! My oven is accurate, I soaked the peas overnight and blotted them dry. I don't know what happened--I think I'll try again at 350 for a longer time. There are so many variations that I'm anxious for them to turn out.

This recipe was great! I just made it tonight for my commune and everybody loved it! Its healthy too which is an added plus. I didn't use any garlic salt but I put in tons and tons of cayenne pepper. Mine only took about 1/2 an hour to cook in the oven and would have been burnt to a crisp by 40 minutes.

I was really exicted to try these.  I hadn't had chickpeas ever until about 8 months ago I tried them on a salad and their awesome.  I had gotten an email from all recipes regarding this recipe and couldnt wait to try it.  I looked at alot of the reviews and decided to bake at 300 for an hour as not to burn and they are a nice and toasty brown, but very chewing.  I'm wondering if two tablespoons of olive oil is (two) much.  If maybe thats why their not drying out well.  I will try them one more time with less oil.  I did pat dry, well and gently tossed the oil and spices (garlic salt, onion powder, seansoned salt, seasoned pepper, kosher salt and lemon pepper) together and placed on a nonstick foil lined cookie sheet, lo and slow, but not was I was hoping for.

Just made these and they turned out really well! I didn't make much, so I decided to start with 20min before I checked them. 2/3 of them burned! I don't know if it's because my oven is a convection or what, but I'll definitely take other users' advice next time and start at a lower temperature and turn it to 450F at the end. I dry roasted them and added the seasoning afterwards, and it was nice! A really crunchy, fun snack.

I've been wanting to try these for sometime now and glad I did!.. I followed directions but added a little onion powder as well.  I over did my garlic powder, my fault!  I think after making them once I'll know by color for next time.  The ones I like best were slightly chewy in the center but crisp outside and were probably done at 35 minutes but I baked mine the full 40.

Just took these out of the oven, can't believe how crunchy they are, they do remind me of corn nuts (which I love).  I cooked mine at 375 for 1 hour, none popped and all are cooked to the crunchy state.  Will make again and use more salt, I used garlic salt and cayenne pepper, tasted halfway thru when I shook the tray, sprayed with PAM and sprinkled with regular salt, but I think it needed  more salt at the first stage. Put mine in a gallon zip lock bag, shook to coat, put on a pan with foil...no clean up:)

I took the advice from Kelly's review below and roasted the chickpeas for about 30 minutes on 450 before seasoning them and it worked great! They came out very crunchy! I added garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and thyme.  This is a great snack and a good addition to salads!

It was OK.  Not something I'd make again though.  My husband thought they had a strange flavor and he thought they were OK but never asked for them again and we never finished them.

On the one hand they were tasty.  It was like a guilt free cornnut.  On the other hand they exploded all over my oven.  I had to take the rack out to clean out the lumps of charcoal the next morning.

I love this recipe. I use very little oil, and usually use chili powder, paprika, and cayenne. I've never had problems with them not being crunchy, although I have burnt them at times. But burnt or not, they're great!

My peas started popping within a few of putting them in the oven.  I turned the heat down so that the whole pan wouldnt explode all over my oven.  I took them out when they were lightly brown, not as dark as the photo.  Some were crunchy all the way through and tasted like nothing, others crunchy on the outside with a dry mealy texture inside.  I can think of a lot of ways to use chick peas, this is not one of them.

They were really good right out of the oven but once they cooled they were kind of mushy...not a bad snack.

Dry roasting first is a must to avoid soft peas.  I will make these again, but play around with different spices.

I didn't like this recipe at all, but my daughter ate them and said they were okay. My boyfriend said they didn't taste very good.  We won't make again.

I love these; a great snack!  Remind me of corn nuts flavored anyway I want!  Definitely have to make sure they are cooked until cruchy though

I love this as a snack and can eat it all myself if I want but I don't feel as guilty as with eating other things. I do however have on suggestion- You definitely don't need this much oil- 1 tbsp is more than enough.  I also made this for my co-workers who loved it too! It's my new go to savory snack.

Thanks to Kelly Bradshaw's tips these turned out exactly as I was hoping they would : ) So easy and healthy, I've finally found something to snack on instead of peanuts! I dry roasted them and just added sea salt and a bit of chilli when they were done.. yum!

A great, healthy snack.  I think I might play with the seasonings a little next time; I'd like them to be a little more spicy.

Kind of a disappointment. Maybe I didn't cook them as long as I should, although I followed the recipe.
I'll just stick to hummus.
