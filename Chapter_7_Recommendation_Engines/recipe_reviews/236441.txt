I made three small changes. My local Walmart did not have gruyere cheese so I substituted an equal amount of swiss. I also omitted the parmesan only because I did not have any on hand and I used evaporated milk in place of the half-n-half. I served this over whole wheat toast--HUGE hit in my house. We ate every goshdarn bit of this. LOVED IT. The kids actually asked me to make this again this weekend. This was inexpensive to make and really filled my husband and two kids up!

We enjoyed this, and for once, I even had Gruyere in the fridge.  I served this over English muffins, and it just didn't make sense to cut the hard-boiled eggs in half, so I sliced them.  The sauce was very thick, so I did thin it out with some additional half-and-half, but then it thickened up again in the oven.  I'm not convinced that this needs to bake for 20-25 minutes, and in the future, I'll plan on 10 minutes max.  It had nice flavor, is something a little different, and I'd serve this to company.  Garnished with a sprinkle of paprika, but chopped parsley would be very nice, too.

Made this the weekend after Easter, so had the bits & pieces leftovers from the ham...put about a cup finely chopped ham in the white sauce. I think you could cut the flour back by 1/2, does get really thick even with thinning prior to putting the oven.  Served on toasted english muffins with a tiny sprinkle of paprika on top, very good and filling.

Great recipe to use up hard boiled eggs from Easter. I didn t have Gruyere so I used the Mexican blend shredded cheese. It came out fine. Next time I will use Swiss I love Swiss. Added a splash of Worcestershire to sauce and 1/4 thyme basil marjoram and parsley. Sprinkled top of casserole with the Parmesan cheese and smoked paprika. I like the recommendations of adding some crumbled bacon or ham as well but I didn t have any. Very easy quick and very good.

Ok I really liked this but used a heavily changed version that a friend showed me. I used 18 eggs(sliced) added 1 cup of fried and crumbled bacon added 1/4 tsp marjoram 1/4 tsp thyme 1/4 tsp basil and 1/2 tsp parsley. Then cooked for 30 minutes.

Instead of slicing up the eggs I put them in a plastic sealable bag and mashed them with a rubber mallet. Our family has added this to the round table of entrees.
