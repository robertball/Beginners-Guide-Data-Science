Based on what others had said about the weak cherry flavor I exchanged 1/2 of the butter for strawberry applesauce(which also helped cut the fat) and use 1 & 1/2 tablespoons of the cherry juice. The cherry flavor was more pronounced.  Cookies turned out great - will make again.

Try using almond extract instead of vanilla for more "cherry" flavor. Good texture cookie. I added cherry icing.

I just made these.The 4 star rating attracted me.Thankfully,I made a tray of 8 cookies,"just to try." They were so bland,despite my adding extra cherry juice and almond extract.They probably could use some brown sugar in place of all white sugar.I'm going to try and salvage the rest of the batter and add some coconut and chocolate chips to the batter.I'm not sure why anyone would call these cookies chewy.They're actually quite dry.We'll see how it goes!

I love these cookies.  Doubled the cherry juice and added almost 2 tsp of Almond extract.  Tasty and chewy. We did not find them dry at all.

The coookies looked beautiful, plump with a very nice texture...but the taste was bland.  I even added more cherry juice, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Maybe if some brown sugar was used.  I don't know, probably wont try them again to experiment.

I thought these were pretty good.  I added more cherries and some mini chocolate chips because they were a little bland at first.  I'd make them again.

I had run out of brown sugar and wanted to try blueberries instead of raisins.  Very moist, but I don't understand where the flavor went.  The blueberries' flavor comes through, but I expected more zing than I got.

After reading other reviews I decided to make some changes of my own.  I cut the shortening to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup cinnamon applesauce.  I cut the vanilla in half and substituted almond extract.  I also used 1-1/2 Tbsp cherry juice and pecans instead of walnuts.  After I had everything mixed I added a little extra flour to make up for the added wet ingredients.  Baked per recipe and I must say they turned out very moist and very yummy!

Like others, found first try bland, used dried cherries and cherry cider in place of marachino cherries... also used other suggestion here of cutting some of the butter with applesauce.

Other than adding more cherries and walnuts we followed the recipe. These cookies are just ok. They are pretty bland. With 3 cups of flour these cookies have a very cake-like texture. Next time we will heed the advice of others and add almond extract and even more cherries.

Average cookie taste. Maraschino cherry flavor was not flavorful enough for me. Ok for a cookie plate, but not a star.

I used 1.5c chopped frozen Vans cherried, 2tsp almond extract,  and a tbsp kirsch. Absolutely wonderful cherry flavour. Also I made it into a bar cookie as all my baking sheets are in the freezer with cherries on them- am betting this version is every bit as good as the posted recioe!

Everyone in my family seems to be very happy with these cookies. Its definitely a keeper :) I had to cook them for 12 minutes, unlike the 8-10 the recipe recommends. Oh, and they weren't very " Chewy " at all.. But they were indeed very delicious.

These are really good. After reading some other reviews about the cherry not coming through, I doubled the amount of juice and added a whole 12oz jar of chopped cherries instead of just 1/2c. The cherry flavor was there but not overpowering and there were enough pieces that each cookie got plenty of cherries. I don't really taste the walnuts in them, so I don't know if they're necessary or not, matter of preference I guess. Way better than raisins!

These cookies were much better after a day of sitting on the counter in a ziploc baggie.  The flavors were able to meld together much better, and we all thought they were quite good.  I did like the taste of the cherries, and my granddaughters loved to pick those out to eat them first!  Thanks!

First time I made these, I followed the recipe fairly close. Cookies were good but lacked a bit of flavor. Next time I amped them up by adding a bag of dried cherries chopped up. I also doubled the amount of salt since they did taste a bit flat. My family loves them now.

There's is something wrong with the measurements of this recipe. 3 cups of flour made it very dry. I would say 2 would have been plenty.

I made these as per the recipe and really enjoyed them.  The cherry flavor is not very strong, but that was fine with me.  I think next time I will use brown sugar instead of white sugar and add a little almond extract just to see, but I enjoyed this.  I really liked the texture with the oatmeal and the nuts.

These were really good and they freeze well also. (I rolled into to balls before freezing) The oatmeal and cherries are a good combination and they are not overly sweet. Will definetly make again!
