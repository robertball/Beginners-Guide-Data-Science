This recipe was tested by the most picky of food critics...middle school students.

I teach a culinary class through Family and Consumer Sciences at a middle school and gave this recipe as a cooking lab.  

Yes, I heard the familiar, eww...black beans, onions, tomatoes.  However, I told them to try it.  Well, let's just say the room was quiet and mouths were full when they tried it.  They loved it!  I had many kids tell me they were going to make it at home for their parents!

This recipe was very easy, affordable, nutritious and really yummy!

I like to heat up the tortillas on a skillet for a few minutes to toast them and make them more "homemade".  It really makes them taste even better!

These are super simple and delicious. Every Friday is Taco night at our house and I was looking for a change of pace from the ground beef variety.  I added 1 C. frozen corn and some fresh cilantro.  I also had to use a fresh tomato because I was fresh out of canned tomatoes. I also added a little water to prevent mixture from drying out (since I didn't use the canned tomatoes).  YUM!  We prefer corn tortillas for tacos and they were perfect with this recipe.  Will definately make again.

This is a sure thing -- easy & very tasty! I followed the recipe as shown, but threw in a tablespooon of lime juice and used 6" corn tortillas. I will definitely make this again.

We love these. I cheat and use salsa instead of the canned tomatoes and chiles (and we don't use the avocado).  I usually make a big batch and any leftovers can get rolled into burritos and frozen for a quick meal.

These were SO good and SO easy to make! I followed the recipe almost exactly as written. Only changes I made were I substituted dried cilantro for the dried oregano and I added 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper. I topped them with sharp cheddar cheese, pepper jack cheese, sour cream and homemade guacamole. Will definitely make these again and again.

This is a very easy and delicious recipe.  I made them one day ahead of serving them for the flavors to blend and served them on homemade tortillas.  The Cafe Rio sauce that I made for the sweet pork tacos I also served worked well here, too.  Even your most ardent carnivore won't miss the meat!

Nice and satisfying.  I scaled recipe down to 4 servings so maybe the scaling was off, but I think next time, I'll use less chili powder as that seemed to be the predominant seasoning.  I used Green Mountain Gringo salsa (yum!) instead of diced tomatoes and green chilies.  I'll make these again. Definitely serve these with fresh chopped cilantro!

Made this for my husband this week.  Of all the vegetarian recipes he has ever had this was by far his favorite!   Very good!  Will make again and again.

I know this recipe has had great reviews but it just didn't wow us.  The oregano seemed out of place (cilantro would have been a better choice for us), and I think I would have preferred filling the tacos with freshly-diced tomatoes instead of cooked canned tomatoes...that wouldn't have been that much more work.  It certainly was worth trying, so thanks for the recipe.

I half the recipe, added 1/4 c sweet frozen corn, 1 zucchini, added 1/2 tsp powdered garlic, and kept the spices the same. Very tasty!

These were pretty good.  Followed the recipe exactly except substituted whole wheat tortillas for the regular ones.  I think the next time, I would add sour cream.

We loved these.  They are very filling!  Instead of avocado we added a bit of reduced fat sour cream (and more cheese than the recipe called for.)  These make great leftovers as well.

This was pretty good. Nothing wrong with the recipe, tastebuds just weren't going 'wow!' I always appreciate a black bean soft taco recipe though, and we love black beans, so enjoyed trying this recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

Very good.  Will be added to the once-a -week vegetarian line-up.  I added a T. of lime juice to the beans.

Amazing Recipe.  I used a can of black beans and a can of black eyed peas and used pickled jalapenos instead of canned green chilies.  Also, I skipped the avocado and served the tacos with shredded lettuce and sour cream!  Tomorrow I'll use the leftovers as a bean salsa and serve them with chips!!

These are a great way to do vegetarian tacos. Even my kids (5, 3 and 2 years old) love this filling. We use it as a topping for nachos, too and it is always well received. Thank you for sharing!

We really liked this recipe, but what we use it for more than anything are the seasonings.  We use this seasoning mix in all our taco and fajita recipes.  Great flavor.

omgoodness these were yummy! I changed it up a little, but I took the basic idea.  I added corn and used a packet of taco seasoning instead of the spices.  Also I used corn tortilas and they were perfect.  Can't wait for leftovers tonight!

This has definitely become a staple at our house.  I have made it with canned black beans, home cooked black beans, and home cooked pinto beans.  I always add about a cup of frozen corn in too.  The finished dish has great color

These were great with sour cream.  I also didn't have the avocado so I left it out.  Great alternative instead of the traditional meat tacos.

I ended up making this pretty close to the recipe except added half black beans and half kidney beans. It ended up closer to a chili taste than a burrito taste. I ran out of tortillas and used it as a burrito bowl, placing it over brown rice, addding fresh tomatoes, cheese, avocado and sour cream. It's a good quick meal to warm up on a week night.

I used Fire Roasted Diced tomatoes to give this more flavor and for some heat I went with a Hot Chipolte salsa that compliments the beans very well. Chiuaua Cheese is great also. (I used the Mex Mix cheese once and it seemed bland)

Once you get the fixings in these, they taste pretty good. I added sour cream and salsa along with the cheese and avocado. However, the mix in itself was a little bland. If I make again, I would use 1.5 times the spices.

This was amazing.  I absolutely abhor vegetables in general (onions and tomatoes especially) but the texture and flavor of this was simply amazing.  I will be making this regularly from now on.

Friday night is taco night and this was a wonderful surprise to my husband and small children.  I always make the kids a small batch without the cumin, chili powder, and green chiles.  I added ro-tel instead of plain tomatoes, and a few jalapeno rings, diced to ours.  So scrumptious, we'll make again and again!  A real keeper!

Very good! I did add a bit of leftover chicken and a jalapeno to it. I also garnished with sour cream, but didn't have avocado. :( I will definitely make again, but probably make them a bit spicier. I like things a little hotter!

I am new to vegetarianism and this is one of the best vegetarian recipes I've tried.  As stated by others, it is perfectly spiced, very colorful (made a nice presentation), and you really won't miss the meat!  I followed the recipe exactly, with one exception---I used whole-wheat tortillas instead of flour (to cut down on refined carbs).  Also, I would use a soup pot instead of a skillet, as the mixture was overflowing in my skillet.  Also, there are some additions/substitutions that could be made:  for a little more spice, mix in some hot sauce (1-2 tsp.) and 1/4 cup salsa (drain the juice) with the tomatoes; for more color, substitute 1 can of red kidney beans for 1 can black beans; it would be more calories/carbs, but guacamole instead of just avocado add cooked spanish rice would be nice additions.

so great!!! Thank you! My only change was to add corn for taste and color. We try to have vegetarian meals once a week and this was one of those that you'll never 'miss the meat'. I'm sure it freezes well too. Thank you, thank you, thank you. My husband, toddler and I all loved it.

These are really good.  I have been making these alot.  I like hard taco shells better, so I use those instead of soft.  I also use the diced tomatoes with chiles.  This is great for vegetarians.  Even my husband who loves meat will eat this.

I made this for a potluck and just set it up 'taco bar' style with the filling in my mini crock pot. I used corn tortillas and served with an avocado dip. Everyone enjoyed these, however no one asked for the recipe. I gave it five stars for the simplicity and good taste.

This recipe is so simple and inexpensive to make. This is a great meal to make on a busy weeknight because it only takes a few minutes to cook. The flavor was really good too, and both my five year old and two year old loved it so I will definitely make it again sometime! I saw someone suggest adding corn to the taco filling, which I think is a good idea so I might try that next time. This was an easy meal that I paired with some Mexican rice, and quite filling even without meat. Thank you for the recipe, Lynn!

I doubled the green chilies and cheese and left out the oil and avocado.  These had a great flavor, but were definitely more like burritos than tacos.

We used a pound of dry beans, 4 T taco seasoning mix, 5 cloves garlic and a 7 ounce can of green chiles.  Made excellent tacos - rave reviews with husband and kids.  We just garnished with regular taco fixings.

Excellent! We halved the recipe but used the full amount of onions and added 1/2 cup of shredded chicken. Added a little more spice and 1/2 cup of corn. Delish! This is our new staple recipe for tacos...

Very good recipe for under 300 calories per serving. Didn't have the tomatoes or chilis so I substituted with cans of Rotel Diced Tomatoes w/Green Chilis and Rotel Diced Tomatoes w/Lime juice and cilantro. The Rotel added nice heat to the dish. I took another reader's advice and cut the cumin in half. Thank you! Anymore would have been overpowering. I felt the recipe was missing something. Chopped fresh cilantro really perked it up. I also think fresh lime juice would help. The mixture ended up with much more tomatoes than beans. Next time I will reduce the amount of tomatoes. Overall, it had great flavor after I adjusted it to my preference.

These are great tacos and can easily be made completely vegan by either subbing the cheese or removing it completely. I added corn to mine and served them in homemade wheat tortillas. They were great.

I like nearly everything with black beans. Really tasty! I've made these a number of times...the last time I made these I had only one can of black beans so I substituted a can of pinto beans & I think with the 2 beans it was even better!

I have been making these for years, and they are wonderful.  Even my meat-loving husband approves. Don't leave out the jalapeno peppers!  If you prefer less heat, use the "tamed" variety.  We buy them "deli sliced" in a glass jar, and I chop them up finer.  They add a lot of flavor.

This came out looking/tasting like a thick veggie chili, which was kinda weird to then put in a tortilla. I served it to a group of 12 and no one complimented it. Probably wont bother with it again.

This was just okay for me, although my husband and daughter liked it.  I thought the chili powder and cumin overpowered the taste of the other ingredients.  If I make this again I will decrease those spices for certain.

These are wonderful!  My husband won't eat regular taco meat anymore.  I make it with a little extra garlic just because we like garlic.  It actually tastes better the second day.  This makes more than my family can eat so I freeze half for another night that I don't have time/desire to cook.

These are now my favorite soft taco.  They were absolutely delicious.  The only thing is they were a tad spicy for my family's taste, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.  Next time, I'll just go easy on the spice.  Thanks for the delicious, fast, easy and budget friendly recipe!

i liked this a lot, and the recipe seems to be pretty forgiving. i cut it in half, was somewhat careless measuring my spices, guess-timated half a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis, and threw in a chopped green pepper with the onion. i put it in warmed whole wheat tortillas with chopped tomatoes, lettuce, and some salsa - i know, lots of tomato products, but i love tomatoes :) if i were a sour cream fan i'd use that - the cold tomatoes/salsa had nice contrast. i'm going to make some brown rice to make a taco bowl as an easy lunch to pack for work. thanks for a great/quick recipe!

M-m-m-m-m!! I loved these!!  I used 2 cans of Ro-tel and added a can of corn.  I realized that I was out of cumin (the horror) and oregano.  So I used a bit more chili powder and some fresh chopped basil from my garden.  A dollop of sour cream put them over the top.  I can't wait to eat them as left overs.  Totally hit the spot with me and my husband.  The kids will come around when I make them again.

This was the basis for supper tonight. I had some rice, though, I needed to use,...especially since my green chillies were actually hot jalapeños, and I needed more than the cheese and avocado to calm things down a bit. BUT this was so good, and I would not have ever thought of putting oregano into a taco. We really liked this...and I tried it from the pan BEFORE adding the rice, and it was good, so even though I tweaked, as needed for tonight, it really is good and quick and easy.

This was delicious! I added way more spices, hot sauce, used green onions and fresh garlic, and finished it off with lime juice and fresh cilantro. This would also make a delicious burrito filler or nacho topper. It'd probably also be great on top of rice.

We call this "sloppy beans" & We love this recipe, although we aren't too strict on what gets added in or taken out. We like to add whatever fresh veggies we have lying around, especially peppers, and we'll eat it as a burrito in tortillas with quinoa (we've replaced rice with quinoa in our diets). My boyfriend is convinced he does not want canned tomatos in it, although we haven't tried it yet, but he'll do salsa, which is very good in it.

Delicious! I made this in a wrap and also in a hard taco shell with some shredded lettuce! I also made this and placed it into a wrap shell (placed a wrap on a scrunched up piece of aluminum foil sprayed with PAM and lay a wrap on it and baked it for 10 minutes - it crisped up and took the shape of a bowl) - Really good!

These were so quick and awesome!  I did have to make a bunch of changes the second time I made them because I didn't have most of the ingredients.  I didn't have avocado and didn't have a lot of the spices, so I just substituted some taco seasoning.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes with chilies already in them.  I also found that this works good with corn tortillas and with sour cream.  Thanks!

Fantastic.  Relaced the diced tomatos with mild salsa.  Thought I had tomatoes but nope just sauce in the pantry.  Other than that followed the filling ingredients to a T.  I did mash half the beans and kept the other half whole per personal prefenence.  Will make again and again.

I've made this a few times now and never seem to get tired of it. My boyfriend said it makes Taco Bell taste like garbage. I used one can of black beans and one can of small red beans. I also added some cooked rice to the skillet and cooked the filling for a lot longer than recommended. I like the filling to be very firm and not runny or sloppy. The spices were absolutely perfect. Hard to believe this is a vegetarian meal. Deeeelicious!

These were more like burritos since I only had larger flour tortillas, but that wouldn't affect the flavor.  And left off the avocado since I dislike it.  The flavor was good but there was something a bit "odd" about them - I couldn't say what that means.  I think they would have benefited from some sour cream which I didn't have.  I'd be willing to make these again, but I don't think I'd want them too often even though the flavor was to my liking.

Great recipe. I only had one can of black beans in the pantry so I added in some mushrooms and zucchini in between the onion and bean step. Guacamole is a great complement to these. Next time I will be adding in fresh cilantro + lime juice to the mixture in the end!

I played around with the spices a little (cilantro rather than oregano), but ultimately this a great base of a recipe that should be part of anyone's recipe book.  I plan on making this many times and adjusting what I add so it doesn't get old.

This is very tasty!  Probably more like 4 and 1/2 stars for those that love a little spiciness to their food.  I used salsa(had just the right amt.), instead of tomatoes, since I only needed 1/2 a can of tomatoes for a half recipe.  If there are any left I think I will make up the tacos, wrap and freeze to microwave at another time.

This is a truly lovely recipe.  Just as stated in the title it is spiced just right.  The chili's are a great touch! I like the fact that the ingredients are not mushed together, so all the textures can be experienced.  The things I changed were simple, and not taste altering.  I substituted a can of red kidney beans for one can of black beans. To add color and sweetness I added chunky pieces of yam or what New Zealanders call "kumera".  I heated the yam in the microwave until their peels were soft, and began to pull away from the skin when touched, that way they were easy to peel.  I then let them cool, peeled them, and cut them into chunks, adding them at the same time as the beans and spices.  The result was a very colorful dish.

These were good, and I enjoyed them, but I don’t think I will make again. They are a little spicy, so warn your kids, or make adjustments. I made as directed, but added lettuce, sliced olives and sour cream to the tortilla before wrapping. I think the crunch of the lettuce was a good addition.

used one 10oz can mild rotel with one can black beans to halve the recipe.  Rotel very spicy.  Jason liked it, but need to reduce spices further for teh rest of us.  Reduced chili powder to 1 tsp.  Good with taco chicken meat all over rice.

My 7 year old son requested these for his birthday dinner!  They are very good, and easy to make.  I didn't make any changes.
