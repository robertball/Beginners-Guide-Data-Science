I thought I had already found the perfect pie crust recipe on this site - until I tried this one!  I substituted butter for the shortening (avoiding the transfats).  I used it for a chicken pot pie recipe and it was the most delicious, tender, flaky crust imaginable!  Remember to use very cold water and do not knead the dough any more than is absolutely necessary or you'll end up with a tough crust.  This will now become my one and only pie crust recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this one!

I was a little worried about this crust because of the vinegar.  I've never heard to do that but it was delicious!  I didn't have any shortening so I used butter and it gave it a great flavor.  I used bread flour (again that's all I had) so i used a little more flour than it called for and the recipe ended up making enough for me to make 6 single pie crusts!  Will definitely do this with all my pies!

I tried several recipes from this site and this was my least favorite. There are too many unnecessary ingredients. It was extremely sticky and hard to work with. It turned out very salty.  On the plus side, it was very flaky.

I was excited to find this recipe, mine had been lost.  This is an excellent way to make a lot of crust at once, and it tastes great.  You may need to add a little water at the end if it is too dry.  I managed to eke out six single crusts of different sizes. A great help at Thanksgiving!  Thank you Norma for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was sticky.  I tried to make it with my kitchenaid mixer, and rolled the dough out right away for a pie.    I could not place it into the pie plate without it falling to pieces. I threw the whole batch out!

My family has been using this very crust recipe for generations now.  I was going to post MY recipe on here, but then I found this! This is absolutely THE crust recipe to use. You can use this for apple pies, chicken pot pies; it's great for both dinners or deserts.  I'm never going to even try another recipe - everyone raves about this one.

I also have used this recipe for over 40 years, but had never mixed all of the ingredients, ie. shortening along with the other wet ingredients. This will be a great time saver.

40 minutes is VERY deceiving. You did not add the 2-4 hours of refrigeration to make this dough workable.  And this crust is NOT as flaky as most of the other recipes available here

This is the best recipe!  I never made my own crust because people always told me how hard it was but this is definitely not hard.  I love how flaky it is.  I did add quite a bit more flour to make it manageable.

I love this pie crust! It is flaky and the taste is great! It was a little hard to work with so I cheated and divided it then put the ball of dough into my pie plate with a bit of Pam sprayed on the bottom and formed the dough to the plate. Worked great and everyone loved it! Thanks!!

Delicious & flaky -- perfect for Chicken Pot Pie.  Added an egg white wash before baking & it was beautiful!  

Definitely not a low fat pie crust option though....

this was ok. I used it for a chicken pot pie. I don't think it would be as good on a dessert pie though...

One word to describe this crust--FLAKY!!! My husband dug thru the garbage can looking for the package because he could not believe that I made this crust from scratch! This worked for savory (beef, broccoli, and cheese pie) as well as sweet (peach pie). Will use again and again!

A good pie crust recipe, I did add much less salt, as I do not like using a lot of salt and a TBSP seemed like too much for my tastes. After a about an hour in my fridge, the crust was easy to work with. 
Made handpies for my mother-in-law and she was happy...thats what matters!
