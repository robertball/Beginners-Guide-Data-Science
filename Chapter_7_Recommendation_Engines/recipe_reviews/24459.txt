I would recommend a football shaped cookie cutter, but if you don't have one (I didn't) then they're still really cute if you outline the footballs with white icing and cut them after that. Really cute!

Of course these are great brownies because of the brownie mix! YUM! However, this drizzle business!! First, I recommend that you actually have a cookie cutter to use. Second, although it won't taste as wonderful as the white chocolate, I recommend getting a tube of white cake decorator 'paste'. Getting the drizzle to work was tough goin'! The gang got a kick out of the effort and loved the brownies!

These were a hit at a bake sale!  I used an egg shaped pan by Wilton and made the laces with thin vanilla icing, for a quicker version.

Brownies with frosting.  Can't go wrong, but nothing special.

I would have gave it 5 stars if the white drizzle was easier.  The brownies were packaged, so there is no comment there.  Everyone loved them (even if the laces looked crazy) at our Superbowl party.
