This recipe was great.  Be sure to pay attention to the can sizes.  I almost used the wrong amounts.  (Not the recipe's fault, just that I always buy larger cans of sauce and smaller cans of tomatoes!)  I didn't have canned whole tomatoes so I used diced tomatoes.  I am sure this changed the recipe slightly, but it still turned out great, so don't hesitate to try this recipe if you have a different tomato type.  :)  My kids, who usually don't like zucchini, loved this and ate the zucchini!

I liked this. I cut all the cook times way back. I used a honey comb shaped pasta and it looked pretty with the red and green colors in the dish. I used my 3" tall frying pan and everything fit. I sauteed 1 lb Jones Creek burger in a tablespoon of heated oil. I drained it on paper towel. Then cooked the zucchini and garlic in another tablespoon of safflower oil for 5 minutes. Then added seasonings including some garlic salt. Lastly I added the tomato sauce drained meat pasta and a can of Italian plum tomatoes I cut uo with scissors. I heated on medium for 5 more minutes. ty

my whole family liked this. I kept all of the ingredients the same. except when cooking I browned the meat and cooked the pasta then I put it in the crockpot with everything else. I put the crockpot on low for 2 hours took the kids to practice came home 2 hours later and dinner was done and waiting for us.

So delicious! When you mix the oregano and basil together it makes an amazing aroma!

Quick and easy. My whole family loved it. I used pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce and left out the basil and oregano. Thumbs up!

I made this recipe "as is". Sometimes you need a simple dinner that is filling cost-friendly and satisfies the unique preferences of many. We skipped the salad and bread since we do those sides frequently and opted for strawberry shortcakes for dessert. A little savory and a little sweet made for a complete meal.

This recipe was OK. I found it to be a little on the bland side.

Super yummy. Used Trader Joe's gluten-free corn pasta and it was excellent.
