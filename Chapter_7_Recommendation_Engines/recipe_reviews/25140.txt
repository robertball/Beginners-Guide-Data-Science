Fabulous! We loved it. Was quick, easy and delicious. I didn't have any leftover meat, so I bought some "wafer-thin" (1/4 inch) boneless center cut pork chops. Marinated them for a little while in soy sauce, then seared them with a bit of oil. Took only minutes to cook. Chopped them up and proceeded with the egg foo yung recipe. I used an omelet pan with just a splash of oil, cooking one serving at a time. Cooked til golden brown, turned, browned the other side, and then kept them warm on in the oven while I cooked the rest. The patties cook very quickly so it didn't take long. The sauce is simple and perfect for this dish. Was a bit thin, so I added a little more cornstarch to thicken. Sprinkle a bit of chopped green onion on top for garnish. I served this dish with steamed rice, store-bought spring rolls, and Chinese Cabbage Salad II (recipe on this website). A wonderful, satisfying and healthy meal!

I am so glad I found this recipe. The egg foo yung came out exactly like they do at my local place. I added some powdered ginger, I think it gave the recipe some added mppphhh:.) I also used canned bean sprouts. You can make this recipe using canned or fresh ingredients, or a combo of the two. The first time I made this I made them vegetarian because I lacked some of the other ingredients. All the times they have tasted great. The great thing about this recipe is that you can expand on it and make it your own. I have tried shrimp, chicken, and beef egg foo yung. When I placed the batter in the pan, the ingredients beside the egg did stay just in the middle. It wasn't a problem though. I just spread the ingredients. Whether you choose to use the amount of called for ingredients or just veggie, etc., the amount of spices, etc. can stay the same. The sauce was good. It was simple. Same as the egg foo yung, it can be expanded on. Using fresh chicken stock, etc.

Very good!  I thought the gravy went along with it well.  Instead of chopping up so many vegetables, I just used a can of La Choy Chop Suey vegetables.

I thought this was delicious. It's my boyfriend's favorite chinese meal and he thought it was better than anything he's had at a restaurant. I pretty much made it as the recipe indicated. I was free and easy with quantities and it didn't seem to matter. I did use beef boullion cubes instead of chicken. As far as the egg spreading, I did add corn starch as someone suggested, but I still doubt that's a big deal. Just keep an eye on the patties until they set and sort of scrape the egg that separates into the patty and you're good to go. I made mine in an electric fry pan and put the lid on while they set. One thing: I would increase the amount of the sauce by half again as much. Other than that, absolutely delicious. Also, suggest rice as a side.

i was surprised at how much this tasted like a chinese joint's egg foo yung.... very tasty.  it might take a couple of tries before getting the timing down for turning over each batch.  but even if they are a little messy, the taste is still there.

I love egg foo yung so I was very anxious to try out this recipe. I was actually surprised how well they turned out. I did add sherry and soy sauce to the egg mixture. The recipe didn't state how much oil was needed, so I poured about an inch into my wok. They browned up beautifully and looked very authentic. Every chinese restaurant I've eaten in has always served theirs with a rich brown gravy which is what I used in lieu of the recipe sauce. Hubby and kids were very happy with this terrific dish. Thanks Debbie!

I thought that this recipe was delicious.  I didn't use all of the meat because it seemed to be so much.  So I used the pork and chicken and omitted the ground meat.  Maybe next time I will try the ground meat.  I recommend trying to cut your pork and chicken in smaller pieces when preparing.  This helps keep the egg from falling apart when it comes time to flip.  The sauce was delicious, too!  Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this on the spur of the moment tonight. My guest, who loves egg foo yung and has it often when we are dining out, said it was the best egg foo yung she ever had in her life (and she's really, really old!). I had to thaw, dice and cook all the meats, so it took 1 hour from printing the recipe to sitting down to eat it. I don't use bouillon cubes, so I boiled down 2 cups of homemade chicken broth to equal 1-1/2 cups for the sauce. Other than that (and leaving out the yukky celery!), no changes or adjustments were made. Oh, and I liked it, too! Thanks, Armycookwife!

This was quick and easy.  I used a bag of frozen wok vegetables and cut my time in half.  The sauce recipe could be cut in half if you're not big on soy sauce! A great taste overall.

Delicious and very quick to make. I only subbed out the celery for some diced green pepper (no celery on hand). The sauce seemed a bit thin, so I added a bit more cornstarch to thicken. Other than that, it was a great recipe.

Scaled this recipe for 2 but since I tweaked it a bit based on reviewers' notes & my hubby's suggestions, it yielded 4. What I did: INGREDIENTS For the egg mixture: (1) used 4 vs 3 eggs (2) used 2/3 vs 1/3 cup bean sprouts [though hubby said it was too much. next time i'll stick to 1/3 cup] (3) used 3 whole shrooms, sliced vs 3 TBSPs diced (4) used 2/3 cup cooked ham vs required meats (5) added 1/4 cup water chestnuts (6) skipped the salt (7) diluted cornstarch for each batch of egg foo yung For the sauce: (8) doubled all the ingredients (9) added 6 tsps of sugar (the original recipe was too salty) (10) added 1/4 tsp ground ginger (11) added green onions, for garnishing First, I QUICKLY stir-fry the veggies (cooking the shrooms 1st) & cooked ham. I set this aside, separate from the beaten eggs. After 4 tries, this is what worked best for me: To make 1 serving, dissolve 2 tsps cornstarch in 1 tsp cold water, add 1/4 cup beaten egg & 1/2 cup veggie/meat mixture. Place a can w/ NO LIDS on an oiled & heated pan & pour in the egg mixture; fry one side for 3 mins. After 3 mins, run a fork around the insides of the can to separate the egg from the can then slip a wide spatula (as wide as the can's circumference) under the egg mixture & can & QUICKLY flip it (can & mixture) over. I used a 28-oz can, about 6" high & about 4 to 5" in diameter.  My hubby couldn't believe we could eat gooood Chinese food at home! Thanks for the recipe & reviews! :-)

What a tasty recipe, just like the restaurants.  It's so easy to change around depending on what leftover meat or veg you have on hand.  Last time I put frozen peas in like one of our local Chinese restaurants do and that was good too.  A little ginger powder in the sauce makes it even better.  I'm thinking tuna cans with both top and bottom removed would be a good tool to contain the mixture.  I'll be trying it!

I used all pork because that's just what I had to use up but I would do that and/or the chicken next time.  Ground beef just doesn't sound like it would belong in this.  I didn't have the time to do these individually at 1/2 c. each.  I did the whole together which doesn't give you the look of Egg Foo Young but the taste was definitely there!  Thanks for a great keeper!

This recipe is fine but for a real restaurant taste you HAVE to salt the egg mixture. For 8 eggs I add 4 short shakes from my salt shaker. The sauce is not right either so here is the secret- make your chicken broth and soy sauce mixture first (the sugar is not necessary)then  the cornstarch water slurry in a separate bowl. Heat a big saucepan and add 2 tablespoons of vegetable or peanut oil and 2 tablespoons of flour and stir that for a few minutes. If you skip this step the flour will taste raw. Now pour the stock soy mix in and whisk it. When it becomes a thin gravy add the cornstarch slurry too. Whisk that as you pour it in or you will have lumps- if that happens pour it into a blender. This is the authentic sauce you will find in the restaurants. Their gravy is much thicker than just a clear cornstarch sauce, but not a regular gravy either- the cornstarch silkens the sauce and this is how to do it. Hope you like it!

I didn't put any meat in mine, just added extra vegetables (and used green onions instead of regular onion) and it was really really good. Tasty, easy to make and even good as leftovers the next day.

The recipe gave me a good base to start with, however it needed a few tweaks.  The omelets were VERY thin, so I mixed up about 1/2 cup of pancake mix and stirred it into the egg mixture. This thickened the omelets to a perfect 1/2 to 3/4 inch.  The sauce was nothing like any restaurant I've ever tried. It was so overpoweringly salty and the soy was all you tasted. I threw out the sauce and just warmed up a jar of beef gravy. I think regular brown gravy would be perfect, truly to match the restaurant taste.  As far as the ingredients in the omelet... go crazy with it. I used burger, shrimp, mushrooms and chicken... they were VERY tasty.  As far as the amount of oil...you really don't need much at all.. just enough in the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking. If you have a really great nonstick pan, you can omit the oil all together.

These were surprisingly good. Very easy to make and had the right taste. I didn't care for the sauce, and next time I'm going to try using beef broth instead of chicken.

My husband said that this was the best egg fu yung he ever had.  I did tweak it tho.  I didn't have any celery, so I added a 1/2 tsp celery seed for the flavor.  I used wild chanterelles for the mushrooms, so I cooked them with the shrimp before adding.  Oh, and I used shrimp in place of the meat.  Plus I added a couple cloves of garlic while the shrimp and chanterelles were sauteeing.  Finally, I added a healthy squirt of sriracha and a tsp of peanut butter to the sauce.  There you have it:  best egg fu yung my husband ever had!

We are big Egg Foo Young fans, and this recipe cooked up wonderfully. My husband liked this recipe better than the Egg Foo Young from our favorite Chinese restaurant.

Excellent!  Added pork that had been marinated in soy, Chinese rice wine, & green onions.  Added some cornstarch just before frying the pork, allowed to cool, then added to the above recipe.  Parents LOVED it (and me too)! This is a keeper, for sure!

I sought out this recipe looking for an Egg Foo Yung sauce recipe.  The sauce for this recipe was a great disappointment - first it was too thin and second the flavor was not that tasty.  I had to completely alter the recipe to make it to my liking.

This was excellent egg foo yung. It essentially was a veggie omelet but the sauce totally made it egg foo yung.  The sauce was excellent!  It doesn't need to be super thick like a gravy.  We cut calories a bit and left out 1/2 of the egg yolks and added extra egg whites. I also just used chicken and used water chestnuts in place of the mushrooms.  We cooked it in our omelet pan and it turned out great!  I'll be making this again soon!  Thanks!

I made this recipe using only bean sprouts, mushrooms, onion and shrimp as fillers with the egg, salt & pepper.  The egg foo yung was firm and delicious and the sauce was also a huge success!  Great flavor and perfect consistency.  Everyone loved it and I will be making this again and try different fillers.  Thanks!

This was the first time I ever tried Egg Foo Yung (I don't know what it was - I just had this craving and alot of extra eggs on hand!) I omitted the celery because I don't like it but it was very good. Not ever having it before it was as I imagined it. But I thought the sauce would be a little sweeter. Next time I make it (and I will) I will add more sugar to the sauce.

First time I tried making egg foo young and it came out great. I made rice and had them over it so next time I will double the sauce. I did not add any meat. I did add about 1/8 teaspoon of ground ginger to the recipe. Also I used my big fry pan and made one at a time but what happened was the 1/2 cup of egg mixture spread out too much making them thin. Next time I will still do the 1/2 cup per serving however I will try using a smaller fry pan in hope that they will come out a bit thicker.

I loved this recipe. I used a cup of chicken and excluded the pork & beef.  Best one I have found out there so far. But prob wont look any further I am very happy with this one and the gravy was awesome.

Wow!! Kids couldn't eat this fast enough.  I used 2/3 C cooked chicken and 1/3 C of ground beef. I may put more sprouts in next time. Does not need double the sauce in my opinion.  Hands down best Egg foo yung ever tasted. Yummy!

This recipe tasted just like the Egg Foo Yung I love at my favorite chinese restaurant. I substituted green onions for onion and added 1/2 cups of finely chopped carrots. I made it for a party and everyone loved it! I didn't think it would reheat well the next day but it actually made really delicious leftovers.

Excellent! I do not give the 5-star rating very often, but this deserves it! I substituted out all the meat and subbed in an extra cup of sprouted mung beans. Thoroughly enjoyed; thank you for sharing!

I just have to say "Thank You!" This was wounderful. I didn't have celery,so I used a little more bean sprouts then called for, used all chicken, had a pack  of sliced mushrooms, used half chopped in veggie mixture, other half in gravy, stir fried the veggies a little bit [let cool] to incorporate the flavors some.] Beat the eggs seperatly from the veggies, but not over beated.For the gravy I used 1 1/2 cups of beef broth instead of water, I didn't boil it first, and a splash of sherry from another site. My husband looked at me and said, "this is really good!" Yea!

Delicious...just took me longer than the time stated...guess I'm a slow chopper. Cut recipe in half for husband and myself. Once ingredients are together, it didn't take long at all to cook and could mix the sauce at the same time. I should have known better, but remember to mix the cornstarch into the cold water before adding to the hot mixture so it won't get lumpy on you. I needed to add a bit more cornstarch to get it to thicken the way I like it. Delicious meal with plain rice (topped with sauce) and Chinese Cabbage Salad I (on this site).

Loved it and omitted meat to make vegetarian.  I also included green onions.  I let the eggs set while cooking, then split it into groups when flipping so that it was more like patties. AGAIN: thought that 1/2 of the sauce was enough for 4.  Used a full Tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken.

This was really fantastic.  I only used ham for the meat because thats what I had and it worked great.  These really do taste just like what you get in a restaurant.  I also added some green onions to the top once everything was plated.

This was really good. I followed the recipe closely, except I used beef "Better Than Boullion" in the sauce instead of chicken boullion cubes, and for meat I used only chopped up leftover roast pork. And I also added about a 1/2 tsp of ground ginger to the sauce.  The sauce did come out salty, but this was my fault, as I may have been a little heavy handed with the beef base.  The egg patties, however, were great--restaurant quality.  I'll take the advice of another reviewer and use the tuna can idea to shape the patties next time, as they were a bit of a challenge to keep together.  I think that hint will do the trick.  Once I lighten up on the beef base, this will be perfect.  Great recipe--try it!

This was a tasty recipe. The only reason i gave it 4 was b/c the sauce needed a little something, so i added 1tbs of oyster sauce. Mmm. Even my 16 month old enjoyed this. I did have some shrimp to use up so i did use that instead of the other meats. The thought of ground beef made it seem like asian hamburger helper

I am always trying new recipes, and this is a keeper. It did taste just like a chinese joint's egg fu yung, like AIDANKWSF said. I think I will try someone elses suggestion and add a tablespoon of cornstarch to the egg mixture next time, because the egg did spread some. The sauce was very good, I used the beef bouillon, and only used finely chopped ham as the only meat item.

Nothing special here, sorry.  Recipe seemed bland so I added some grated ginger, soy sauce and seasame oil to the egg portion of it...and it was still painfully bland.  The gravy portion of the recipe has one dimension - salty.  I would rate this recipe comparable to something you'd  get from a airport or mall take out Chinese buffet.  Nothing  great, nothing horrible.  I suggest you choose another recipe

My version of this recipe was low sodium and vegetarian based.  Which automatically cuts the fat, calories and cholesterol as compared to the original. Also, I used heart healthy Wessen 100% vegetable oil.  In addition to the thinly sliced celery stalks (I used two), I didn't have any mushrooms on hand, but I used a bag of fresh, shredded "slaw" mix (cabbage/carrots), then half of a medium sized white onion, half of a thinly sliced green bell pepper, a little bit of finely chopped, fresh cilantro, green onions, half a can of drained bean sprouts (used other half previously in a different dish), a few dashes of sea salt, freshly ground pepper and garlic seasoning, a dash of hot red pepper flakes, and veggie broth for the sauce.  At first I thought I wasn't doing something right, since the bowl of veggies and eggs seemed to get very soupy (I added more "slaw" mix).  But they actually came out fantastic!  Also, I used only one teaspoon of raw brown sugar instead of the processed white sugar the sauce recipe called for.

I chose to cook in a skillet the first time I made this.  But I think I'm going to use my wok instead and see how that turns out next time (just for kicks, and I'm going to add shrimp too).  My  modified healthier version of this recipe was a HUGE hit with my family.  I was told this was hands down the BEST Asian dish I've ever made.  We won't be ordering take out anymore that's for sure.  No restaurant would make this as healthy as I did.  Also, I made about 12

THIS IS AWESOME!  I will make this again and again.  My husband absolutely loves egg foo.  Takes just as good as the restaurants. He thought the Foo sauce was a little salty, I thought it was just perfect!   Great find... Recipe I'll keep and pass around to all who want a good egg foo :)

The only change I made to the recipe was to use all roasted pork instead of three meats.  I tried to cook it as directed, like pancakes.  It wouldn't set up and hold.  The only way I could get it cooked was to scramble it like an omelet.  I tried to eat it this way, but I found it to be inedible.  My husband ate it because he was hungry,   We aren't picky eaters...

I made this dish without the meat and used some extra bean spouts and mushrooms.  It was delicous - just as I would expect from an authentic Chinese resturant, and on the current Weight Watchers 360 program it came to a scant 4 points including gravy (assuming 8 servings).    I will be making this one again!

I have made this dish twice now, and both times have been a knock out. I love egg foo young, and grew up as a staple of our Chinese takeout, but it is very unhealthy. I was looking for a recipe that I could serve to my family that's healthy and flavorful. I made some changes- I only used chicken, which I had grilled earlier with an Asian spiced BBQ sauce, then cooled and chopped it. I think used about 5 thighs. Then for the sauce I used a quart of chicken stock, added one chicken bouillon cube, a shake of Chinese 5 spice ( get a good quality one from your local Asian market) and a shake of fine garlic powder. I also doubled the soy to give it that dark color a d rich flavor..it's best to use low sodium as you're using quite a bit of chicken broth and soy. I simmered that for about 30 mins while cooking the egg foo young, thickening it at the very end. My dad always says the gravy is the secret and the second version I made yesterday, was much more authentic tasting to both him and myself. The omelet recipe is perfect. If you love egg foo young, you'll love this recipe!

A solid, 5-Stars from here! This recipe is dirt-simple and, once the basics are incorporated it just begs for a few variations.  When I serve it, I just call it Eff Foo Yung WITH[Fill-in with whatever is available]. Vegitarian editions suffer no loss of flavor and 'foo yung' i s a wonderful way to use up bits of leftover veggies and/or meats etc.  For veggie additions the pieces may be raw in most cases, but must be small.  Meats should be cooked, but I often incorporate small pieces of raw seafood, shrimp, scallop, fin fish etc.  The Mung bean sprouts, obviously, but be raw, well washed and dried and I also clean them a bit.  We like robust flavors, so I often add GARLIC and toasted SESAME OIL if compatible with the other ingredients.  The SAUCE is the real secret to a good, tasty 'foo,' so make a good one.  I use a robust stock, chicken or beef) (veggie if necessary) adding garlic, sesame oil, usually more soy saucce than called for and yes, a pinch or two of MSG.  (I also put a pinch on MSG into the egg/veggie mixture. No one around here fusses about it and it does enhance the flavors.  A decent 'foo' is so easy, it has become a Comfort Food item here.  Served with rice (variety of choice) and perhaps another side veggie, it is a balancecd, enjoyable meal that can be served in under 45 minutes.  It is also ideal for a large table as the 'foo' patties will hold well in a 200F oven for an hour or more. Jazz it up a little and Five earned Stars!

This is our new family favorite and must be made at least one time per month if not sooner.  This is a great recipe to use with leftovers especially chicken.  I have only used chicken in this recipe and usually left over chicken from a roasted chicken earlier in the week. For people on the go this recipe is so easy and fast. Use boil in bag rice and  You can get precooked chicken and make a full meal in less than 1/2 hour.   The foo yung sauce is the key to this great meal,  it is easy fast and delicious. Try it you will not be disappointed

Amazing.  I made this without any added meat but followed the rest of the patties and sauce as written and it was as great if not better than any take out I've had before.  I was also thrilled to find this recipe as I made it with gluten free soy sauce...the first time I've had this in a long time since going gluten-free.   Thanks for posting!

I have loved Egg Foo Yung my whole life but haven't had it in over 10 years. I am an inspector for the local board of health and see these kitchens on a daily basis. So since I am too skeebed to eat at a chinese restaurant I decided to try making it on my own. EVEN if I was ever brave enough to return to a restaurant ..... this is BETTER than I ever had at a restaurant and paid $15.00 for! This was fabulous and I actually made it two nights in a row. I made it for myself a couple of nights ago and it was so good that when I was having a girls night in the next night I made it a chinese theme night. It was a HIT! I made it true to the recipe with no changes. We also made homemade spring rolls from this site and I served it with green ginger tea I bought at my local supermarket. We used chop sticks and served it on asian themed dishes I have. it was so good and so much fun to have a "Chinese" party that we are planning to do it again soon. Everyone was so impressed. THANK YOU SO MUCH!

I didn't use any of the vegetables listed here because, frankly, I just didn't have them. I needed a recipe for dinner that used a lot of eggs and this was absolutely fabulous! I also didn't use the salt, but we LOVED the sauce, it was very good! I use flour instead of cornstarch to thicken my gravys simply because we like the taste better.

This is very tasty and I would make again.  I mostly followed the recipe, but only used pork for the meat.  I used the smallest skillet I had, and I had no problem with spreading.  The only reason I didn't rate it higher is due to the texture;  it's like an American style omelet and not even close to the restaurant style

egg foo yung has always been a favorite of mine but had not found a recipe that was right.  I finally found it.  I meade the patties with veggies only and five eggs.  I used boxed chicken broth instead of cubes (I find them too salty).  Friends and I get together occasionally for a movie night and dinner.  I plan on making them when get together again next week.

This was a good, easy recipe for the Egg Foo Yung patties, but I thought the sauce was a bit too salty. If I was to make it again, I would use LOW SODIUM soy sauce.

Like some of the others I had to improvise with what I had - used just chicken, mushrooms, and some mixed veggies. I also, cooked the mixture all together in one small pan so it would all be hot all at once, (used a plate to help me flip it) and cut into four peices to serve. 

Loved the gravy for it, I'm thinking of making that just for a basic stir-fry.

My husband is the one who made this because this is one of his favorite chinese dishes.  He said it tasted great but it was too much effort to make and that when he does want this he will stick to just buying it and saving himself a lot of time.

This takes a little time to make, but it is worth it. So much better than the resturant one. The sauce is better too. Like store tomatoes and home garden tomatoes. No comparsion. This is a winner

This was a great recipe.  I had some left over ginger, so i chopped it up and mixed it with the sauce.  It gave it a nice aroma with just a hint of ginger flavor.  The leftovers hold up very well.  I took some to work and had to copy the recipe for all the gals in the office.

I have been hungry for egg foo yung for a couple of months and knew it was easy to make.  I made two plain for me and the rest I added pork for my dh.  The only thing I will do different is double the recipe for sauce.  Soooooo Good!

Loved it. We made it to the recipe with one exception. No ground beef but 1\2 cup chicken and 1\2 cup pork. Got both of those at the deli counter at the grocery store; easy. We sauteed the eggs and fillings in a little olive oil in a 6" diameter pan so it was easy to spread out the filings evenly in the eggs. We garnished with sliced green onions. Our 11 year old liked it.

Great use of leftovers.  I minced leftover vegetables and added them to the mix.  I also added some curry power and ginger for a little more oriental taste. The sauce was too salty for me, with boullion and soy sauce together. I guess one or both of those should be low salt.  I had plenty left over, so I'll see what happens if I add some plum jam to it tomorrow.

Very good, my husband said it was delicious. I used only fresh veges,  (previously frozen) wild caught shrimp, meat from a chicken thigh and a piece of ham. In addition to the recommended veges, I added some finely chopped broccoli and asparagus as well as fresh ginger and garlic, which I also chopped finely. I think next time I will experiment with beef bullion in the sauce and see how it's is. Thanks for sharing.

This is by far the best egg foo yung I've ever had. Make twice as much of the sauce as the recipe calls for. Also, I sauteed the veggies before mixing with the eggs.

This was really good and incredibly easy to make. I used only chicken because that is what the BF wanted. Next time I think a thicker, darker sauce would make these pop more! Thank you for the inspiration DEB

Delicious!   I used leftover thanksgiving turkey chopped fine for the meat, added green onions, mushrooms,  and chopped water chestnuts for the veggies.   Sauce was very good on top, a tad thin - I might add more cornstarch next time.  I may never order this as take- out again - so easy!

Mine turned out great,   I cut my recipe in half because it's just me and my dad, still had 3 big patties left over.   I made plain fried rice to compliment.   I kinda cheated because I had made shrimp stir fry the nite before and had plenty left over to make the egg foo young.  ( My stir fry contained,  sweet onions, mushroom, thin sliced carrots & sliced almonds;  right at the end I throw in a half a bag of raw cabbage coleslaw mix, saute lightly.)     I cooked the egg foo young in a cast iron skillet and used crisco oil, it was about 1/2 inch deep in the pan.    My Dad loved it and we will enjoy eating the left overs.

I made a veggie version with 12 medium eggs and extra bean sprouts and used red peppers instead of mushrooms.  I cooked big ones (a heaping cup) the size of my smallest teflon skillet (with a spray of pam) and it made 5 large servings, more if serving with sides.  The sauce is a bit bland and needed more cornstarch,  I used splenda, low sodium soy sauce and broth and that may have made a difference.  I added more soy sauce, rice vinegar, fresh ginger and black pepper.   I have read these freeze well and am giving it a try.

This is an excellent recipe and so easily adapted to your liking.  I had some mushrooms and eggs to use up so I made this.  Didnt have the meat but it wasnt necessary. My son loved it.  I should have thickened the sauce a little more though but the flavor was all there!

This was not a hit in our house...even for our teenager who devours anything and everything. It was just really bland. I even added ginger as another commenter suggested to spice it up, but it didn't help.

I was happy to find this recipe! I made mine vegetarian, using left over veggies. I didn't have time to try the home made sauce, so I used a jar of brown gravy instead which was quick and fine. I'm sure the recipe sauce is even better. I did enjoy the dish and will make it again.

Enjoyed this very much.  Did not make the sauce, as I like the taste of the main ingredients.  I also like to cook until there is a modest amount of crunch to the mixture, that I would not do with standard fried eggs.  The amount as made supplied about six good servings.  You can almost use anything except possibly fish.  Will try more experimenting.

I made  a vegetarian egg foo yung with grated baby marrow, grated carrot, bean sprouts, mushrooms finely chopped, red peppers finely chopped,  corn off the cob and spring onions. I also made my own vegetable stock and added the stripped corn cobs into it--it was delicious.

I have made this recipe twice this past week in two different Asian style dinners. One time I used it as the protein and the other, it was a side to a lo Mein chicken vegetable dish. You can change up the meat or have no meat (mine was meatless) and I used shallots instead of white onion. EXCELLENT and EASY. A new fave for our family.

This was delicious!  I had never eaten Egg Fu Yung before, but I needed to use up some bean sprouts, so I tried it.  I added ginger, like another reviewer suggested.  My husband loved it and we will definitely make it again.

An excellent recipe! The only thing I did differently was to skip the ground beef and pork in favor of only chicken. 
It tasted great and I will definitely give it another go.
The sauce is the real deal!

The husband & I really liked this. I used leftover roast beef for the meat portion. The sauce is a perfect compliment. 
I do use low-sodium soy sauce.

Very good! My wife is on a low carb diet so I made these. Used medium cooked shrimp  (remove the tails!) and cut them into threes. Recommend changing oil out every 3 patties.

It had flavor but how to cook it is the question. How much oil? Do you fry it like potato Latka? I think not 1/4 inch of olive oil is not the way so I used another pan with slight oil. That worked better but they fell apart, to much liquid. Next time I will whip the whites then fold them in.

Good base recipe for egg and veges. I used pork only, cooked with Teriyaki sauce, Chinese 5 spice, fresh ginger and Lawry's seasoning. For the minced veges, I used bok-choy, mushrooms, sweet onion, fresh garlic and a small sweet red pepper, along with bean sprouts and chopped bamboo shoots. The sauce wasn't flavorful enough for us, so I added a bit of Chinese 5 spice and a bit of Teriyaki, in addition to soy sauce.  I used low sodium chicken broth.

I made this for breakfast today. I love all the vegetables; I used some leftover ham that I chopped up instead of the other meats, but would have used them if I had them handy. That was the only change I made to this recipe. The egg part turned out great. I sauted all the vegetables and meat before adding to the eggs, then cooked them as the recipe stated in the same pan. I made the sauce in the microwave. It was too thin and very, very, very salty. I will make this again, but will tweak it. It was a lot of prep time and the oil for cooking the eggs is not listed in the ingredients.

The only meat I used was pork and I ground it up in the food processor. I thought the combination of flavors was quite tasty...just as good as my favorite Chinese restaurant.  The sauce was ok...not sure what was missing.

Excellent!!  Just like Mom used to make except the sauce was waaaaay better (Mom just used brown gravy with soy sauce)!  Very quick and tasty.  I made a double batch of sauce to use on the rice we served on the side - love it, love it, love it!

It was wonderful! I used what veggies and meat I had and it was still incredible! I made it with only scallions, fresh bean sprouts and shrimp. I was amazed. Can't wait to try it with water chestnuts, pork and celery as well. Don't change the sauce. Yummy!

Very good recipe.  I used beef bouillon rather than chicken, and I used chicken and tiny shrimp.  It was missing a little 'something', but I'm not sure what.  I also found the mixture to be a little thin, and made wide thin patties as opposed to thicker ones.  Still, my entire family enjoyed this recipe, and I will definitely make this again.

This did not turn out well at all. I gave it 2 stars because it was edible, and I ate it because I didn't want to waste all of those eggs. I know it was probably me, but I just felt like it was missing something. It turned out like a very bland mushroom/bean sprout omlette.

Fabulous!  No meat on hand, so we just added a few more sprouts, celery and mushrooms (which were from a can).  Outstanding!  A keeper for sure!

We love this recipe and make it frequently with whatever we have in the house.  I always add more bean sprouts.  I also include cabbage, bok choy, and red onions--all excellent.  I've never used all three meats, but it's excellent with turkey or chicken or as a vegetarian dish.  I use a small nonstick skillet with just a spritz of oil to make approximately 6-inch patties.  They're contained while cooking, easy to flip, don't stick, and cook up quickly.  This recipe is a keeper!

Super recipe!  My husband requested I make egg foo young.  His mom used to make it when he was a kid.  He thought this was great and it has definitely become a regular in our menus.  Thanks so much!

Had no celery, but I don't remember my old Chinese takeout having celery in it anyway.  Turned out fabulous, the whole family loved it!

This was good but way to much effort & the deep frying of the egg smelled up my house for 2 days. My local chinese place has an awesome yellow gravey that I 've never seen duplicated. Much much much easier to order out & at probabily the same cost.

This recipe does take some time and effort to prepare. Every time we crave chinese food, we head to a local restaurant and always get the egg foo young.  Although this recipe is not quite as good, it comes close and the sauce is just as good.

This was much better than I had expected it to be, but just not the same as some chinese restaurants I have eaten at. I will make it again, though.

I made this one night because my husband asked if I could make it.  Now he makes it almost once a week.  I can't tell you how many times I have re-printed the recipe for him.  It is one of his favorites.  He says this foo young sauce is one of the best he has ever had.

Mine resembled scrambled egg because that is what the egg foo yung I've had in the past looked like. Husband told me it should look like little eggy patties! (I've yet to have it in the US) I omitted the ground beef as I didn't like the sound of it. I wish I'd used fresh bean sprouts - I thought the canned type was a bit squishy and bitter. This was ok for a change, but I doubt I'll make it again. Thanks though.

This was really good.  I am vegetarian so in the gravy I used veggie stock and in the patties i just added a lot of bean sprouts.  Next time I would try more veggies like waterchestnuts, carrots etc.

I am giving this 4 stars ONLY because the taste was EXCELLENT.  The texture, however, was a different story.  I halved the recipe, and the only things I did differently were to use chicken as the only meat and sub green onions for the regular.  When I added the 1/2 cup measures of the egg mixture to the skillet, the eggs really spread out, while the veggies and meat remained in globs.  I was able to push the eggs back into the globs.  Then it was time to turn them, and they all fell apart.  So I added the remaining egg mixture to the skillet and cooked and stirred until the whole thing was done.  Next time I would not even try to make patties. Egg Foo Yong can be made as one big round.

The recipe didn't turn out quite as well as I had hoped. I wasn't too fond of the ground beef and felt it was all a bit dry. My boyfriend and I had to add a ton of soy sauce to give it more flavor. I think I'll stick with good 'ol stir fry! :)
