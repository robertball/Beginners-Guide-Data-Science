Delicious! My husband loved it also. I used vanilla yogurt.  The hint of almond was very nice in this. Next time, I'll peel the bananas first and THEN freeze them, or I'll let them thaw a bit before peeling.  Trying to peel frozen bananas was extremely difficult!!  The peeling was difficult to remove, as were the "stringy things" that sometimes adhere to the banana from the peeling. I had frozen stubs for fingertips, and it took way longer than the listed 2 minutes just to peel the bananas!!  Otherwise, it was excellent!

This is the best smoothie I have tasted out of all my allrecipes.com smoothie experiments. Not only was it delicious, but it even looked gorgeous! It scaled very well, I scaled it to serve half as much as normal, and it turned out perfectly. The consistency was just right. I used frozen blueberries and vanilla yogurt, and it was a dream. Thick (just how I like my smoothies), and sweet, but not overpoweringly so. Definitely a 5-star recipe.

This smoothie has such great flavor.  I omitted the blueberries since they were out of season but the kiwi had a wonderful, distinct flavor.  I didn't freeze my banana and it turned out fine - just not as slushie (which is what I prefer!)  This is going on the morning smoothie rotation!

Maybe I did something wrong, but I made this twice and both times the kiwi flavor was so tart it was like sucking on a lemon. I make lots of smoothies with other fruits, but I won't make them with kiwi again.

I loved this recipe and am planning on making it a lot. I didn't use kiwi though, don't like it. Used unfrozen bananas, frozen blueberries, vanilla yogurt, honey and vanilla extract. This is what I had on hand. I didn't use ice because of the frozen blueberries. Excellent, nice and thick, really cold and refreshing. I am going to try it next with mixed berries in place of the blueberries for something different. Thanks a lot for this great drink!

Spectacular, though I had to modify based on the ingredients I had available.  I didn't have kiwi, so I used mangos.  I omitted blueberries completely and substituted vanilla for the almond extract.  The taste weighted slightly to the banana side, but no complaints at all--I love bananas.  I'm looking forward to trying this as written.  Thanks for the great smoothie recipe!

I made this for my boys (3 and 7) and I, and we all loved it!  I made it the same except I didn't have kiwis on hand, and my bananas weren't frozen.  It was still delicious--the flavors blended wonderfully and the consistency was what I've been looking for.  I've tried other smoothie recipes, but this is the best by far.

well, it was good,  but here is a tip....dont use vanilla extract, not even a little and dont use very much honey at all.  other than that, this smoothie was delicious and if not for the extract and honey, it would of been 5 stars.

Making this smoothie today proved why freezing chunks of banana is both smart and handy! I always have blueberries around, fresh or frozen, but bananas not so often.  Thinking ahead and freezing a bunch made it possible for me to make this tasty and a little different smoothie for Hubs.  Some reviewers commented that this was tart, and in a negative way. Hubs agreed about the tartness, but in his mind, he said, that was a plus. Since I used vanilla yogurt I skipped the almond extract which didn’t appeal to me anyway. I first made this for him eliminating the ice and adding some milk – he was not impressed.  Said it was too thick (even tho’ I added milk) and not cold enough.  I reblended it adding the ice cubes and he said it was MUCH better, something to keep in mind if you’re tempted to skip the ice cubes!  He reported a subtle banana flavor.  All smoothies being pretty much the same, he said this one distinguishes itself from the little bit of tartness.  Ultimately, he described this as “nice.”

I cut the ice in half to substitute cold water for a smoother consistency in blending.  The 2nd time I made it I substituted soy milk for the yogurt, eliminated the ice, and added 1 Tbsp. flax seeds - sublime!

Great smoothie! I used fat free plain greek yogurt which is a great source of protein, omitted the honey and since I used frozen fruit I omitted the ice. Delicious, the kiwis gave a nice tangy flavor!

Husband liked it but I did not. A few key things I would change IF I made this again: Use vanilla yogurt and either reduce or omit the almond extract and I think it would make it 4 possibly 5 stars.

I really enjoyed this smoothie, I didnt have plain yogurt so I used vanilla, then added a little extra honey and since I used vanilla, I didnt use the almond extract.  Thanks for this recipe.

Wow-zers! This was fantastic! I used almond milk instead of yogurt and almond extract (2 bird one stone) and opted out on the honey (fruit is already sweet!) The second time I made this I added strawberries and it was good but I feel the recipe didn't need it.

Love smoothies! Nice tip: buy the ripe markdown bananas at the market. Peel, slice and freeze in large freezer bag. When ready for smoothie, just pull out as many pieces as you want. Makes the smoothie so cold and thicker. Yum!

I used fresh bananas, plain greek yogurt (adds a nice flavor) and vanilla extract instead as it was what i had on hand right now and turned out really good.

This was yummy!  I forgot to add the almond extract and added 1 cup of fresh spinach and about 1/2 cup of milk.  My 1 year old loved it!
