Wow This recipe was great. I served it to friends and they really liked it over rice!! To take away from the spicyness I added a little brown suger. When I went to clean up at the endof the night there were no left overs.That's a great sign in my home!!

My husband did not care for this.  I thought the flavoring was excellent.  We both love jerk and we used a Jamaican seasoning that was just right.  This is a very pretty dish.  Was a shame the quality of the shrimp and scallops I used was not as good as the other vegetables in this recipe.  I will enjoy the leftovers.

This was very easy.  I added about a tsp of garlic powder to it.  I marinated the shrimp and scallops for about 20 minutes before I cooked them.

Very good and pretty fast to make i'm a college student so speed is very necessary, and personally I think a little garlic would help, but those are just my 2 cents

I mixed this dish and the marinade in with Zanaran's Caribbean rice for a complete hot meal.  The sweetness of the rice took bit of the bite of the jerk seasonig.  My family loved it and so did I!

This is an amazing recipe!  Extremely easy to make and looks/tastes chef quality.  Fantastic for a get-together as it makes a beautiful presentation when served of a bed of nice green leafy lettuce.

I made this recipe with a seafood medley that was supplied by my local fish monger.  It turned out quite lovely - wonderful on salad for a light but satisfying lunch.  I can't say it was mind blowing but was a very good, very solid recipe.

This was great!  I made it as an appetizer for the Superbowl and it went over great!!  It's a fantastic dish with just enough spice to give it a kick!
