This recipe originally comes from Betty Crocker. I've been making it for years and it is delicious (and very, bery sweet. I often melt about 3 squares of chocolate for the top, since one isn't usually enough to cover the whole thing.

I prefer these to the seven layer bars.  I had these at a tea at a teacher's house, and begged for the recipe.  They are now on my husband's top five cookie list. I used powdered egg whites instead of a raw egg (used equivalent of two) to decrease risk of salmonella.

This is our all-time family favorite. Sometimes I use peppermint extract in the frosting layer and add a little green food color. I also use unsweetened chocolate in the crust, and drizzled over the top, cuts back on the sweetness, but it is still very rich. I use egg substitue in the crust, I think that can prevent salmonella? We also cut them very small because they are so sweet.

I have been making this recipe for years also and is always a big hit.  For the top layer I use 1 square of unsweetened and 1 square of semi-sweet or German Chocolate. You need at least 2 or 3 squares to adequately spread over the white/sugar layer.

I first made this recipe last Christmas, for a family get-together, and they disappeared. I always omit the nuts, though, because I'm not a huge fan and a number of my family members are allergic. Also, even though 1.5 oz of chocolate for the topping seems too small, I've found that it still spreads over most if not all of the dish, and the thinness makes it nice and crispy.

A family favorite for many years. Still looking for a way to spread that final layer of chocolate...such a pain.

Not bad.  Never been crazy about coconut in baking.  Double the chocolate for the top layer.

This is also a favorite at our holiday get togethers.  I read the recipe wrong the first time I made them and combined the final chocolate with the frosting.  Pretty good and saves the final spreading step.

These tasted so-so but were a mess to make & eat. I think you need more moisture (butter or maybe sweetened condensed milk) relative to the dry ingredients like graham cracker crumbs and coconut to hold the base together. I live in low humidity and wouldn't make them again. A huge hassle to keep them in one piece--I had to weigh them down overnight in the fridge with a gallon of milk.  You absolutely need to double or triple the German chocolate on the top to get coverage.

This has been a go-to recipe for our family for years. Even people who are not fans of coconut tend to like this bar. I think the explanation for the comments about one square of melted chocolate not being enough to spread over the top of the frosting may be because I believe the original recipe had you thinly drizzle the chocolate in fun patterns over the top of the frosting...it gives it a fun look and eliminates the total pain of attempting to spread a layer of melted chocolate neatly on top of the frosting.

This has been a family favorite for many, many years. I use 2 squares of semi-sweet chocolate in the graham cracker mix, as we like a bit more of a chocolate taste. I also add 1/4 c. of softened cream cheese to the frosting. For the top layer, a large bag of melted milk chocolate chips can be substituted.
