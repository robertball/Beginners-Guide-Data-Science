This salad was very good! A great addition to our 4th of July BBQ. I added lemon zest and juice to the recipe and used cilantro instead of parsley. You can cut down on the oil to lower calories and fat.

I've made this three times already! Love it :o) It's a very forgiving recipe so you can use just about any type of bean and it still tastes great. I even substituted green beans for the garbanzo beans once to reduce the carb count and it was yummy. I've also used chopped vidalia onion when I didn't have green onions on hand and enjoyed that too. The possibilities are endless! FYI: In a time crunch, I used zesty italian dressing instead of making the one recommended. While it was good, it wasn't as tasty as the homemade recipe. I would take the extra time to make it next time and always make sure to mix it up in advance to allow the flavors to marinate and develop.

Very good.  We like these types of salads, so it was right up our alley.  I backed down on the oil, subbed cilantro for parsley and added some lemon juice and tabasco sauce.  Next time I'll up the green onions and back down on the cilantro.

Made this for lunches and it did not last long in our house! Couldn't find northern beans so I subbed white kidney beans. I think you could really use any bean combo you like. Artichokes add a lovely zing!Loved this recipe. Thanks Sistalulabell!

This is excellent.  I just made it and put it in the fridge, so I know it will taste better in an hour.  I left out the green onions because my husband doesn't like onions.  I used an extra tablespoon if balsamic vinegar, a 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and basil instead of parsley.  I also added 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  This recipes is great!  Awesome pantry cleaner.  Thanks!

There is evidently a typo with the recipe, the list of ingredients lists "black eyed peas" but in the authors notes she refers to "black beans", which is what I have been using with success.
I'm trying to control my cholesterol with high fibre foods and beans are good way to do this, I'm told. This meal is a Saver and will be made repeatedly. I love garlic but my spouse and daughter are not as keen mainly because they have to work with the Public in retail; so next time I will reduce the number of  cloves by half.

Vegan!  Add corn, wheat, or rice as a separate dish and you have a complete protein.

I used two cans of garbanzos and one of blackeyed peas because that was what I had.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It could have used a little more zing.

This is a great summer salad.  I made as written and ate it for dinner throughout the week. Perfect to come home and not have to cook.

I followed the recipe exactly, but was surprised by the brownish appearance from the balsamic vinegar. Also, I followed the recipe exactly only cutting the oregano back and black pepper back, to taste, but I still found it a bit tart and herby tasting. I guess, I just like all of the ingredients in the salad, but thought the seasonings and vinegar just gave them too strong of a flavor.
