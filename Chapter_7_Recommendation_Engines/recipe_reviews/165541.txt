I would use less mint next time and maybe add some red onions and roast the corn, but otherwise my boyfriend really liked it and it went well with The Best Burger Ever recipe. It is super easy to make.

I wanted to use up some of the mint we have growing in our yard.  I think I've decided that mint is for mojitos, not eating.  Just did not care for the flavor, nor did my husband.  If you aren't big mint fan, I wouldn't suggest this dish to convince you.

I have made it twice and enjoyed it both times. The first time I only had balsamic vinegar and my husband preferred that version. This recipe really allows the corn and mint to shine.

I used normal tomatoes instead of sun dried tomatoes, and it still turned out delicious! My family loved it! Perfect for summer too.

OMG Delicious! Thank You.  Used only 1/2 c fresh mint bc of a previous comment. Added halved cherry tomatoes when served bc I don't care for sun dried toms.  Next time I may try some onion but this was PERFECT!

So far so good. I am taking this to a Canada Day BBQ. I made some changes. Only because I didn't have any sun dried tomatoes. I used red roasted peppers.
