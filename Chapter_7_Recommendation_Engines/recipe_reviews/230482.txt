I tried this and it was amazing. Very moist. I did tweak a little by adding vanilla, nutmeg, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar and two kinds of chocolate chips, semi sweet and dark chocolate. My family can't stop eating it.

This recipe worked out really well as muffins. I baked them for 22 minutes at the prescribed temperature. Very moist and fluffy. We'll make them again. :)

This bread was excellent. I also followed everyone's advice and used 1/2 brown (I actually used dark brown) and 1/2 white sugar. I added a 1/2 teaspoon more cinnamon, 2 teaspoons vanilla and used 4 bananas which I believe made it just that more moist and delicious (not to mention I had 8 bananas I wasn't going to eat and didn't want to throw away 2). I ended up making 2 loaves and added walnuts to one. Lastly, I used a metal pan coated with unsalted butter for each loaf, turned the oven off at 55-60 minutes and let it continue baking while cooling which prevented the burnt or hard outside while also not sticking to the pan. I will definitely keep this as a favorite and make it again!

Everyone in my family LOVED this recipe.  After seeing other reviews, I did use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also added 2 tsp. of vanilla extract.  My preference is to not add any more than the one tsp. of cinnamon, or it overtakes the other flavors in the recipe.  This is a wonderful and delicious recipe I will use again and again!

I revised the recipe like many others, adding 2 teaspoons of vanilla & changing the sugar to 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I didn't have a glass pan so I used an aluminum pan. I greased the pan very well but the bread stuck to the bottom of the pan. The bread tasted good.

I followed everyone's advice and added half brown sugar, vanilla, and less cinnamon. I think a tsp of cinnamon would have been fine, I couldn't taste it at all 1/2 a tsp. However, I didn't have a glass pan like it suggests so I used a metal one. The outside crust got a little too done before the inside was done. The crust was just harder than would be ideal. It wasn't burned tasting or anything but I'd suggest maybe a cooler oven for longer if you use metal. This was delicious and very easy!

Only change I made was to add a few dried cherries I wanted to use up.  Lovely and perfect banana bread.  I have only ever made banana bread with oil in the batter, not butter.  What a difference it makes.  

FYI, if you make more than one to two changes to a recipe, you have made a new recipe and should not rate the original based on the changes you made. 

What if I made spaghetti and meatballs and substituted ketchup for the tomatoes and hot dogs for the meatballs, and then said the recipe was icky?

I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was amazing! I know we all like to tweak recipes but my suggestion is to try it like it was written.Super moist without being smushy. Kudos!~

I tweaked the recipe to be dairy free.  I found one review that said instead of 1/2 cup butter, she did 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 yogurt.  I don't do dairy, so I used a vegetable based butter and vanilla soy yogurt.  I also did what many of the reviews said and used a combination of brown sugar, but instead of white, I used raw sugar.  I also through in dairy free dark chocolate instead of semisweet chips.  The bread is really good and it baked really well!  I only needed 60 minutes.  I'm happy it turned out so well without using any dairy based products.

Banana bread is dead to me now unless I use this recipe and include chocolate chips. I only swapped 1/2 the white sugar for brown and replaced cinnamon with vanilla extract. Baked for 60 minutes and it was perfect. Just make it. Your whole family will be eating out of your hand (probably literally).

Easy to make, crowd pleaser.  I have been looking for a banana bread recipe forever that would turn out moist and have some extra "pizazz", like the flavor from the chocolate.  This is definitely a winner, and if I can make it, anyone can!

This was soooo good! I doubled the recipe and gave one loaf to a new neighbor. Now I think she'll be a friend forever! I heeded someone else's advice and used half brown and half white sugar and also added nutmeg. Finely chopped pecans would also be a great addition. Since we always have over-ripe bananas in the freezer, this will be often made in my kitchen. I did drain the extra liquid off the thawed bananas before using. The loaves were ready in my oven in just over an hour.

We love this recipe and I've now made it 4 times. It is very flexible.
Here are my most recent changes and it turned out absolutely delicious!

1) White whole wheat flour
2) Apple sauce instead of butter
3) 1/2 c Xylitol, 18drops (almost 1/4tsp) Now brand liquid Stevia (instead of sugar)
4) 2 tablespoons orange juice (instead of milk, to make it dairy free)

I did sprinkle some sugar on top to insure that it got brown, but I don't think that was needed. If you haven't used an applesauce substitute before, I think it makes the bread less silky, however, my family didn't notice.

------ previously ----------
What a great recipe! I've made it twice. This second time, I made the following changes:
1) 1c white flour 1c whole wheat flour
2) coconut oil instead of butter (make sure the coconut oil is *completely* melted and add it to the sugar rather than vice versa, otherwise it just sticks to the bowl.
3) 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/4tsp liquid stevia
4) flax milk instead of cow's milk
Even with the changes, it turned out great! It was slightly drier, so next time I do whole wheat flour, I'll add a couple more tablespoons of milk (it was still quite moist, though). The sweetness is spot on and it browned nicely.
Next time I will mash the bananas more so it is more banana-y

Good recipe, very moist bread. Like others I tweeked it by adding vanilla and half brown half white sugar. Also I did a crumble topping with melted butter, brown sugar, and oats.

70 minutes would have been way too long.  This was done in my oven in about 55 minutes.  Just a reminder to always check on things as your baking.  Never assume how long it's going to take the first time you make something in a particular oven.

Other than that, it came out great.

AMAZING!  I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 scoop (1/4 cup) chocolate protein powder.  So delicious that I made 2 batches!  This will be made again and again!  I made loaves (3 small) a batch of mini muffins, and a large loaf to share.

I've made this a couple of times now. First time I used a metal pan, took about 80 minutes. Second time I used a glass pan, took about 90 minutes. But, both times used 1/2 cup of raw sugar and 1/2 cup of Truvia. Also both times, I added about 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and used 1/4 milk (mixture needed it). Also, I used organic eggs which are usually much smaller so I used 3 eggs instead of two. Perhaps, that is why it took longer or maybe it's just my oven. Also, added one tablespoon of vanilla the second time and a teaspoon of ground cinnamon. I think the second time it was just a bit better than the first. Next time, I'm going to try to use 1/2 cup of coconut oil instead of a stick butter for a healthy fat option (did that previously with a packaged banana bread mix, and it was fine).

This recipe is wonderful! I tweaked it a bit to make it a little healthier and it tastes even better than the original (probably due to my LOVE for dark chocolate chips instead of milk!). I use Ghirardelli's 60% cacao dark chocolate chips, add a teaspoon of vanilla, instead of white flour I use half white and half wheat, and instead of white sugar I use half brown and half regular! ENJOY! I literally make this bread every other week!

This was was absolutely delicious! (Unfortunately I only had mini chocolate chips so it was pretty chocolatey, if that's the case in your kitchen I would recommend decreasing chocolate chips by about a quarter cup. Also, I did do the brown sugar substitution after reading all of the reviews.) Still, I love chocolate, so it was still wonderful and My husband ate almost the whole loaf in 2 days! I think from now on when I buy bananas he will let them get too brown on purpose so I will make this bread! Thank you for this recipe, will definitely use again!

Pretty generic recipie - did not wow me. Cooking time to long. Missing key ingredients such as vanilla extract and nutmeg. Use brown sugar instead of white and the ratios are a bit off for a pan this size. Defiently would not make again.

Amazing! Really, really yummy. I read the other reviews and did 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of regular sugar (actually, I used sugar in the raw...had no white sugar) and did 1/2 tsp of cinnamon instead of a full tsp. I also had slightly less flour than the recipe called for (1 3/4 cup rather than 2) and it still turned out absolutely delicious. I made mini muffins instead of bread and baked each batch for 15 min. Yum!

I made these as muffins and ended up cooking them about 25 minutes. Easy, delicious, and moist.

This is an excellent bread, and so easy and quick to make. I didn't change a thing with the recipe. The bread is very tasty and light. I think it will even be better after sitting for a little while. My husband had to taste it just as soon as it was cool enough to eat.  I will definitely  make this again and the only change I will make is to add a cup of finely chopped walnuts. For some reason I like nuts in most of the breads that I make.  If you make this once, I'm sure it will go into your "save" file. This one is a keeper.

Fantastic! The amount of cinnamon was perfect. Moist and full of flavor. I would almost add another banana though. :)

Love this recipe! Very moist and flavorful! My changes: I do not add any salt because I use salted butter so no need to add extra. Also, I add 1 tsp. vanilla extract, use 1/2 cup granulated and 1/2 cup brown sugar (as most here have done), and I add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Yummy!! Also, I bake this in a glass dish (not a bread pan), and cut and serve it like a coffee cake. It is always a hit with friends and family! :)

I have made this 3 times now within the past 2 months, probably the best banana bread recipe I have found. I have used both metal and silicone pans, and find that I have to reduce the cooking time a lot 45-55 minutes, be sure to use a non-stick spray such as Pam for baking (old schoolers make sure to grease and flour), if not it will stick in a bad way. As for tweaking the recipe, both ways turn out great, very different flavors.

Took the advice of some other reviewers and added vanilla, nutmeg and substituted the 1c white sugar for 1/2-1/2 of brown and white sugar. Added walnuts to the top before baking. Baked for 20 minutes in muffin-form. Amazingly decadent!

This is a very sweet and very good banana bread with both a great banana and a great chocolate flavor. I reduced the cinnamon to half, used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, and substituted wheat flour for 1/4 of the white flour. In addition, I realized I only had 1/2 of the required butter so substituted the other half with vanilla yogurt. My family could not get enough of it. We ate it for dessert!

family really likes this recipe.  I doubled it to make 2 loafs, one I put chocolate chips and the other with none.  I added a crumb topping. 1/2 brown sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1/4 butter. turned out wonderful, pictures to come.

Loved it! I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white and it was sweet enough for us.  I added the soda, powder and salt to the flour in the measuring cup and stir, this eliminates one bowl.  This took exactly 1 hour and 10 minutes, spot on! Thanks for sharing.

This turned out very dense and spilled over to make a huge mess in my oven.  I have never had a bread do that and I am not new to making homemade bread.  We also didn't care for the banana/chocolate combination but that is personal preference.

This was delish and gone in two days.  I did swap sugar  with half regular half brown.  Other than that, followed it to a tee.  Mine did overflow a bit in the oven, I used the right size pan, not sure why that happened.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great.  Nice and moist!  Next time I will try vanilla instead of cinnamon because I though it was a little overpowering.

Very good!  Took another reviewers suggestion to do half brown sugar, half refined and to add vanilla.  I also used white whole wheat flower and cut down bake time by about 10 minutes as a result.  Very very good!

Made this recipe yesterday for the first time and it turned out great! I tweaked it a bit here and there but main difference was that I used Bob's Red Mill-Whole Grain Brown Rice Flour to make the recipe gluten-free! Wasn't too sure how it would turn out considering I had used a different flour but it came out wonderful. Also didn't have 9x5in. loaf pans so i used 11x3 loaf pans (not glass) instead. Just had to cover the bread with foil after it had been baking for a while because the edges were getting all browned but the inside definitely needed more time.  Overall, it's a keeper!

Very good! I often make it half Splenda, half sugar for calories and because my husband is diabetic- always just as good! The only change I make is I smash the bananas instead of slice.

Amazing banana bread.  My kids beg for it.  I half the salt and put about 3/4 cup of sugar instead of a full cup.  I also add a cap full of vanilla just cause I love vanilla.  But this recipe is great.

So I got pretty drunk, made this with the following adjustment 

Instead of white sugar I used 1/2 white. 1/2 brown
added crushed walnuts
doubled the cinnamon.
used margarine with olive oil.

Note the cook time of 1h10m is perfect.

Amazing.

This banana bread is amazing. I read some of the comments and decided to do a little tweaking. I used a half cup of white sugar and a half cup of brown sugar instead of one cup of white sugar. I also added a tsp. of vanilla. It came out really well. It tastes wonderful.

I made this recipe but switched up the ingredients, I also added Nutella to make it extra choclatey. It was awesome and moist - I think that when you add extras like chocolate spread and chips you should lessen the amount of sugar. I also used brown sugar in stead of white and whole wheat flour in stead of all purpose. But super tasty!

I made this recipe tonight and it was awesome! I made the same changes as many others did- 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar, and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. The teaspoon of cinnamon was perfect, not at all overwhelming. It was delicious!

My whole family loves this bread and I think they are not eating the bananas just so I make it. First time I followed the recipe just has it was written and everyone loved it. Second time I did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and they loved it then too. We love cinommin so it was not strong to us.

I just made this recipe and I love it! The first time I've had banana bread turn out perfectly! I did change the recipe like other people said with putting 2 tsp of vanilla in as well as instead of a whole cup of white sugar, splitting it to a half of white and a half of brown. It turned out so well! Never had banana bread just slide out of the pan so easily before! I also made a few muffins because my loaf pan is a bit small, so I had a loaf and 6 muffins and the muffins were awesome!

I made this a few months ago, and never saw the need to find another banana bread recipe ever since. Regularly stock this in my chiller, I usually bake 2 loaves at once and they will disappear within 3 days. This makes a moist and delicious banana bread, all with very little effort.
I only change the amount if sugar - cut it to 1/2 cup brown sugar and it's sweet enough for me. I bake it for around 55 minutes in metal pan, any longer will make it less moist (and less delicious for me).

Followed this recipe as is.. probably could of used one more banana.  Does quite have a heavy banana taste. But it's okay.

I also did half white sugar half brown sugar and added a touch of nutmeg and extra chocolate chips. It was absolutely scrumptious. It was super moist and fluffy. I will definitely be saving this recipe and making this again soon.

I didn’t have semisweet chocolate chips, and so I grated dark baking chocolate.  Overall, I liked that it wasn’t as sweet as other banana breads but rather than a cup of grated chocolate, I would only put 1/3 cup in. That didn’t stop it disappearing when I took it into work.

I made this exactly like the recipe and  it was very good. Made mine in a metal pan. Did get a bit of a dark crust but was not a problem with flavor and texture. This recipe is a keeper and will make again.

Did not like it at first...but after a night in the freezer we took it out for the party and BOOM!  This is a dessert bread for sure.  Next time we'll do frosted or glazed muffins (cupcakes) out of it.

Make this and if you don't love it, freeze it and you're welcome.

Delicious and I’ve now made many times. I add more bananas usually, because I have ripe bananas and it seems to me you can’t go wrong with additional bananas. Thank you!

Followed the suggestion of others to do 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, and subbed vanilla extract for cinnamon since we're not huge cinnamon fans. Made as muffins and took about 25-30 mins on convection bake. Very tasty!

We mixed the dry ingredients together and  then took a couple of tablespoons in a separate bowl to coat our chocolate chips which kept them from sinking to the bottom. I think next time maybe I would not add as much of the cinnamon but I am still learning how to bake and cook so I'm not sure. I will definitely make this again!

I will definitely make it again. Very good recipe. The only change I made was doing 1/2 of the cinnamon so the flavor was there, but not over powering the overall flavor of the bread.

Swapped out butter for applesauce and kicked the sugar down by 1/2 c. Added a pinch of nutmeg, wish I had vanilla. But very happy with it! Next time I'll make it with vanilla and bake for a little shorter duration.

I’ve made this bread several times! It’s delicious and moist. Everyone asks for more when I bring it 
I do half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white. 
Honestly don’t have to add eggs into it if you don’t have any. I’ve forgetten eggs once and you couldn’t even tell. The bananas act as a replacement.

Really enjoyed the bread - and very easy to make! I took the advice of some others and added a little vanilla - probably about a teaspoon and was generous with the cinnamon. . I also used turbinado sugar. Really nice flavor. My oven had it it done in about 55 minutes - glad I was paying attention! 
Recommend!!

I took some people’s suggestions and used half where sugar and half brown sugar. I end up using 5-6 bananas when I make it, I think it makes it even softer and more moist. I also accidentally used 2 cups of chocolate chips but that honestly made it even better! My friends and boyfriend love when I make this and it doesn’t last very long.

Delicious and moist! Never thought of putting chocolate chips in banana bread but it makes perfect sense now. Used my Pampered Chef 4 mini loaf stoneware. They were cooked perfectly, unlike my experience with using larger loaf pans where the bread dries out too much on the outside and is underdone inside.

Way, way too much cinnamon. Cut at least in half. Salt is also a bit heavy. Was overdone at 60 min - so reduce cooking time by at least 10 minutes and be sure to check around 50 min. Comes out dry. Maybe add sour cream?

It had good flavor but was a little bit dry. Next time I will bake for 50 minutes and check it every ten minutes thereafter.

Lovely recipe and simple! The cinnamon amount is just right, it gives the bread some depth, but you don't taste the cinnamon outright.  I don't know why people were cutting it back! I think if I make it again I might see if I can use a touch less sugar, but that's about it. Fantastic recipe! P.s. I used half white sugar, half brown sugar.

Be sure to use the three full-sized bananas. I had two full-sized bananas in the freezer to use and I can see why three bananas would have been a better texture and a better banana flavor. My error, not the recipe! It is a nice snack bread,.

It was good but I will be using the ideas provided in the comments with vanilla, nutmeg and splitting the sugar with brown. I also added walnuts to mine.

I think the crust was a little hard, so it could probably use less time, and 1/2 cup brown sugar would've have probably made the flavor better, but otherwise it was really good.

Made a double batch with 2 extra bananas and a teaspoon more of cinnamon.  It was enough to make 24 muffins which cooked perfectly at the 22 minutes recommended! I also made a cake bread with the chocolate chips added.  Half the family does not like chocolate, the muffins are for them.

Just made this today. Excellent! But I made a few tweaks suggested by others. I did half cup of brown sugar, (not dark), half cup of white sugar. And I added in one teaspoon of McCormick Vanilla extract, (in addition to the cinnamon). I baked these as muffins, with liners, at 325 degrees for exactly 24 minutes and they turned out absolutely perfect. I put a little cream cheese on one as soon as they came out of the oven. These won't last long!

I didn't want to add sugar as bananas have plenty, so I just doubled the amount of bananas and it came out delicious, super moist, but held up fine structurally. My girlfriend who doesn't like things too sweet enjoyed it as well as my 5 year old daughter whom loves sweet everything so I argue the sweetness was very balanced.

I didn’t add the cinnamon just for personal preference. Also I won’t be adding an entire cup of sugar next time, it was a lot . Other than that it was super moist and delicious!

I concur with bakers who recommended 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar - result was fantastic! Made a slight modification and used peanut butter chips in place of chocolate chips and was really happy with the taste.

1. I added all of the aforementioned subs (vanilla, 1/2 brown and white sugar) but I also used nonfat plain yogurt in place of the milk, toasted walnut pieces,  pumpkin pie spice (2 tsp-ish) and I take at least 2 extra bananas and just rough slice/chop into big chunks and stir them in with the walnuts and chocolate chips.

2. I followed the recipe, mixing each group of things in it's own bowl, then adding together carefully. But I stirred the flour into the wet ingredients like when making macarons. Once around the bowl, then down the middle. It gently mixes the ingredients together without losing the air generated by the baking powder/soda and yogurt. 
The bread was so light and fluffy, the batter rose in the bowl and the loaves each puffed up and made a gorgeous crust! 

I also knocked 10 minutes off the bake time, because for my oven, 70 minutes made the bread too dark (in my opinion). I realize, of course, that I basically rewrote the recipe for round 2, but my first time was by the book, and I stick by those 5 stars! Highly recommend, either way!

Made muffins instead of bread, 12 normal and 24 mini. Baked at 300 with a dark pan (not glass) - 20 mins for the mini muffins and 24 for the normal muffins. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, like many of the other comments. Replaced the chocolate chips with walnuts and cashews, and my parents and their friends loved them! (I'm not a fan of them myself, because they're not very sweet nor do they have chocolate, but that's also because I'm a teenage girl lol). Also melted my butter just a little bit and that made mixing a lot easier.  Great recipe!

I had a lot of bananas and made a double batch - 1/2 with a cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 with a cup of chopped pecans. I did not put in the cinnamon, but did add about 1 tsp vanilla. I cut the sugar back by about 1/4 total; next time I will cut it down to 1/2...likely from the chips, but we found it a bit too sweet. It baked in about 75 minutes and turned out lovely. I will make again.

I made this exactly as directed, and it is very good. The only thing I would do differently next time is to divide the batter between two 7” x 3” pans instead and bake for 45 minutes. With such a big loaf, it takes a long time for the middle to get done, and by that time the edges are over baked. Two smaller pans would solve this issue.

I had covered the crust with aluminium foil after 40mins. It helped to keep the crust from burning.

I'm reviewing while the bread is baking...smells great.
I make my own brown sugar, so I used all brown sugar, and I used chopped dark chocolate drops.  Now  I need some more ripe bananas (which I get sometimes in the produce dept; sold at a cheaper price. Believe me they disappear quickly. I want to repeat the recipe and freeze a loaf or two.  I forgot her name.....but thank you for this recipe.   :-)

After Searching for a new receipe as I lost mine, I found this gem!!  Made the following Changes:
Added I tsp Vanilla, Change the Sugar to 1/2 cup each of While sugar and brown sugar.  I added Crushed walnuts to top of Some before baking.  I also made these muffins Cooked 325° for 24 minutes. So moist and flavor WOW. The receipe made 18 muffins.  Just to know l used z bananas and did use paper cups wl metal muffin pan ... the chips did not sink to bottom.. but one muffin has already vanished and others will soon!!

By far the best banana bread recipe I have ever made. The cinnamon tips the scale in flavour. Next time I will try it with nuts and vanilla.

These were amazing! Took the suggestion to add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and vanilla. Added an extra banana. Wanted to add brown sugar ( but didn’t have any on hand - will try next time). These were one of the best items that I’ve ever baked! Will be making again. I made muffins for 22 minutes- perfectly cooked.

This is the second time this week I make this recipe. I halve the recipe and it makes 12 muffins perfectly. 
As per other reviewers, I do half white half brown sugar and add vanilla, and I'm pretty heavy handed with the chips, because you can never have too much chocolate. 
Delicious! Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Amazing! I never review recipes but this one deserves it. I grew up waiting for each holiday not just for presents but for my moms banana bread and this is such a delicious take on the classic bread. The only thing I’d change would be to maybe add some walnuts!

This was so delicious! I  used honey instead of sugar and coconut oil instead of butter. It was enough for 2 loaves and I had extra to share! It was so moist like a  cake. When using honey, you have to add 1/4 tsp of baking soda to the mix and I also snuck in some ground flaxseed. I will be making it again and I will be adding this to my recipe book. Thank You!

I used the half brown/half white sugar and almost 4 bananas with some cut banana put on top of the cake before putting it in the oven.  Had to cook for almost 1h20min - at 50 min, it was not cooked at all and I used a glass loaf pan.  I just kept adding 10 min more each time and kept using a long kebab skewer.  It looked like it came from a nice bakery.  I greased the pan with butter (not a lot) so it released easily.

People couldn't stop raving about how moist it was and the flavour was so rich.  It was the butter and brown sugar for sure.

Wow! Love this recipe!! I took some others advice and made little changes: like 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar (instead of all white sugar), I added a tsp of vanilla, and a “sprinkle” of nutmeg, also I added 4 bananas (instead of 3). The best part is I cooked in a muffin pan for 22 minutes. I added chocolate chips to half of them at the end before cooking (see picture). They turned out really soft/moist. This will be my new go to recipe for banana bread.

I made it in two bowls not three.  Did the butter and eggs and mixed the bananas and milk in a separate bowl . Then mixed the dry ingredients into the same bowl and It turned out amazing and so moist!
This one’s a keeper already in my Fave cookbook

Best banana bread I've ever made, hands down. I didn't have any chocolate chips, but otherwise followed the recipe. Not too sweet, perfect texture. Made muffins, too...they were gone before the loaf was out of the oven!

I make these as muffins for my guys pretty often.  For me, this recipe makes 12 full muffins.  I use a baking spray with flour and they always slip out with no issues.  Also, I have to bake them at 325° for 35 minutes to get them perfect.  I use 1/2 cup white and brown sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla, a few shakes of nutmeg and I add an extra tablespoon of milk since I use almond milk.  They are always delicious for a dessert or breakfast!

This is hands down the best banana bread recipe I’ve used. The chocolate chips really add a nice little sweetness. I accidentally omitted the milk, but I don’t think it affected the bake what-so-ever. I added a tiny bit more cinnamon & baked for 60 mins. I’m sure this won’t last in my house seeing as I almost devoured the whole pan myself.

Super moist! I used 5 smallish bananas instead of 3 and vanilla Greek yogurt instead of milk since that’s all I had. Like other reviewers I used half brown and half white sugar. I also added 1/4 tap nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla.
After baking for 50 min I noticed the top was getting quite brown so I covered it with foil. In all it required 70 min of baking time.

I always read the reviews prior to making something. The 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar was perfect as well as the addition of vanilla extract. Will make again for sure!

I followed the recipe exactly as is but instead of cinnamon (since I don't like it), I added 2 teaspoons of Vanilla. I left it in the oven for 60 minutes instead of 70. Oh, I also added way more chocolate chips than the recipe calls for, butttt that's a preference. The bread came out delicious! Will definitely have to make it again.

I did 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white instead of 1 cup white. I also added 1 tbsp peanut butter to the banana/cinnamon/milk mixture. It came out really nice!  I’ve never made banana bread before and I felt like a pro with this recipe! Super simple

Banana Bread would have been amazing but the chocolate chips completely took over the flavor. I will be making again but skipping on the chocolate chips or adding half as much.

Overall, the basic recipe was good....moist and tasty!  I did make changes....but more personal preference based on other reviewers comments.  Did the half sugar/brown sugar.  Added 1 tsp. vanilla.  Used 4 bananas.  Used dark chocolate chips.  Added pecans.   I also used a little trick that Tyler Florence uses in his banana bread recipe.  I took about 1/3 of the smashed banana and added it to the butter, sugar and egg mixture and then beat it with the hand mixer to make it smooth and fluffy.  I added the rest of the banana as the recipe instructions stated.

I loved it. Its the best loaf I ever made. I did make 2 changes though. I put 3 teaspoons of cinnamon. I put 1 1/4 chocolate chips instead. I made sure the sugar and butter had a whipped consistancy.  Everyone loved it.

Love this!!!!  So I had 4 bananas turning and used all of them, I may have gone alittle heavy on chocolate chips but didnt mind.  Didnt have baking soda but had baking powder which if you triple that measurement with double acting baking powder you get the same results.  Just make sure to test your baking powder by putting alittle in water and if the water starts to bubble you know it's still good.  Just alittle tip I found out not too long ago.

I made a minor change when I made this by swapping out 1/2 white sugar for brown. I also dropped the cinnamon as I’m not a fan of cinnamon and chocolate together. I also added fewer chocolate chips (closer to 3/4). This recipe is pretty good and it’s easy to put together, but I’ve had MUCH better banana bread.

Delicious.   The only changes I made were to decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup and then used half white and half  brown because some reviews said it was too sweet. Ne xt time I will bump it up to 3/4 cup.  I made muffins out of these and it was sooo good. I used  mini chocolate chips.

I don’t understand this. I’ve made this twice following the recipe exactly. Both times it comes out raw/liquid in the center. An extra hour in the oven with foil to try to prevent the outside from burning and it’s still liquidy. The oven works fine for everything else. What’s going on?

I put 4 bananas and half brown sugar / half white sugar like some suggested. Made small loaves so I followed the cooking time for muffins as someone else had wrote in a review. Covered in tin foil for half the cooking time then took it off. I also put some pecans on top of each little loaf that I made for some extra crunch. Best banana bread I have ever eaten!

Lovely recipe—I tried the half and half sugar too, not because I didn’t think the white sugar wouldn’t work but because that was all the sugar I had in the pantry. I loved the result, for a dessert item or muffin, but it was too sweet for a brunch bread. Would make again 100%, exactly as I had if I were making it for a potluck, but maybe with half the sugar and half the choolate chips if it’s for breakfast/brunch.

Alterations to the recipe I did:
+1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar
+2 tbsp milk
+1 tsp cinnamon
+added a mix of semi-sweet, milk, and white chocolate
+placed a row of chocolate chips on top of the batter
This tasted really good but I had to increase the amount of milk and use brown sugar so it was more moist. Very easy to make!

I used 4 bananas instead of 3 (cause I had 4) and also did the 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon + 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, as well as added some vanilla to the mix.  Instead of 1 cup of white sugar, I used 1/2 cup of white, and 1/2 cup of brown.  I also used closer to a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I ended up making 12 muffins (325 for about 45 minutes) and then a small 8x4" loaf pan which was only about 1/2 full, and cooked that for an extra 12 minutes or so.  Everything  was delicious.

I would make it again. I added chocolate chips to the top of the bread. My mother owns a bakery, and she said this banana bread was better than the one they make at the bakery.

I've made it several times using the alterations in the top comment (half white and half brown sugar, half semi sweet half dark chips). It's a fantastic recipe. I usually add walnuts, Pecans also turn out great. It's just consistently delicious.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! My absolute all time favorite banana bread, and my husband’s too! So moist, and the chocolate chips stay melty for DAYS! We have to pace ourselves so that we don’t eat the whole loaf in one sitting. Have made before and will make again and again.

I took your advice and used foil inside my glass pan, but I baked mine on the grill. I couldn't regulate the temp below 350 so I watched it carefully but it still took an hour. I used mini semi-sweet chips. My husband and I couldn't wait to try it so we cut a piece after the 10-minute cooldown.  It was awesome!

A very reliable recipe.  Good flavor (I used half white and half brown sugar, plus dash vanilla extract) and easy to make.  My only complaint is that this recipe is full fat, full sugar, white flour... so of course it is yummy. I can't eat it without feeling guilty and wondering how to tweak it to be healthier.  Of course this doesn't stop me from stuffing my face, but I do ponder how to make it healthier....

I love banana bread. Adding the chocolate chips was perfect. Why didn't I think of that. Loved this recipe.

It was raw in the middle, but I blame some of my changes and I would like to try again. 
Changes:
Used 1/2 all purpose, 1/2 cake flour, instead of all purpose 
Used dark chocolate chunks instead of semi chocolate chips
Used 1/2 dark brown sugar, instead of brown sugar 

I thought the cake flour would make it fluffier, and I like chunkier chocolate but that may have affected the moisture, and maybe dark sugar has more water content.

I made this and followed other people's suggestions by using a half cup of sugar and a half cup of brown sugar. it turned out very moist. The reason I gave this recipe only three stars is because of the cinnamon . It may be my personal choice, but I did not like the taste of cinnamon in my banana bread.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was amazing! It turned out very moist. I did not have a glass bread pan but it still turned out great. I did alter the recipe slightly. Like many of the other reviews, I used a half cup of white sugar, half cup of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of vanilla. My family absolutely loved it.

Absolutely delicious, followed the recipe and it did not fail! So yummy this will be one I make again and again. The bake did take me about 15min longer but may be just my oven.

I would make it again! But I added a good amount of nutmeg and what I did was I mashed up on my bananas first then I put the vanilla, then the brown sugar, a little bit of white sugar (so about half a cup of the brown and one fourth of a cup of the white)then I mixed all that,then I used real salted butter and melted it,mixed all of that then I added the eggs whisked them together  with the milk and then I slowly added it to the flower.

Directions were easy to fallow. But this Banana Bread is very lack luster. Would not suggest this recipe. There is something missing.

I didn't have ground cinnamon so I didn't use any. As for the milk, I used almond milk instead of regular (the less of an allergic reaction I have the better) and I doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves. It is sooo good! I will definitely be making it again. I might replace the butter next time with a lactose-free or almond based brand if they sell it at stores and I'll see how that turns out. Thanks for the recipe :)

This is my go to banana bread recipe. My son and his college roommates ask for this on a regular basis! I’ve made it as written and think it’s great but I have tweaked it over the years. I only use 2 bananas instead of 3 unless they’re very small. With 3 I find it never cooks properly in the center. When I add the chocolate chips I use 2 different kinds. 1/2 milk chocolate chips and 1/2 semi-sweet or dark. Fantastic! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Excellent recipe! I think this will be my favorite now. 
It's perfect for having with a cup of coffee in the morning, or for serving guests. Everyone who tasted it, loved it!
I have a few suggestions: fist, I used about 2/3 of the sugar in the recipe, and it was sweet enough- but Im not a big fan of very sweet cakes and cookies. 
Second, I used about 2/3 a cup of chocolate chips and added some walnuts. Next time though I will use about half a cup of chips and half a cup of walnuts, as the chips kinda take over the banana, and walnuts might even it out a little.

HINTS:  use 100g of  BROWN SUGAR instead of what is in the recipe - too much sugar in the recipe.  USE 100g about 1 CUP of BROWN SUGAR only

Use BLACK BANANAS - ie yellow bananas that have gone black

BUTTER THE PAN  & USE PARCHMENT PAPER IN THE PAN - I used butter, lots of it, couldn’t get it out well & it broke.

Very nice & light & the best banana bread ever using my hints.

Delicious!!! Keeper recipe.
I used half wheat pastry flour and half all-purpose, 4 medium bananas (instead of 3), added 2 tsp vanilla (bc I love vanilla in everything), and reduced the sugar to 3/4c (instead of 1 cup). 
I did muffins instead of a loaf. Recipe made 24 mini muffins and 12 regular muffins (total 36).
These are awesome.

Made this recipe and I stuck pretty close to the original recipe.  I did add vanilla and walnuts.  Turned out really good.

Made this recipe for the first time exactly as indicated in the recipe. It was DELICIOUS!! So delicious that it flew and there wasn’t any left for the next day!  Next time I’ll need to make more than one loaf.

Loved it!!!  But 70 minutes might be a little long for my oven as it was a little poverty cooked.  Butter helped moisten it up to eat.  My loaf today is cooking for 60 minutes now as my last 2 batches were over cooked.

I like to make this recipe vegan. I substitute coconut oil for butter, applesauce for eggs, and almond milk for dairy milk. It turns out great. 

This time I also used a darker chocolate and half white sugar, half brown and those tweaks were a nice touch too.

I've made this a few times. It's a good move when I don't get around to eating some bananas fast enough. I like adding pecans and some instant espresso mix. I use 1 cup of sugar, half granulated, half brown. My coworkers and family make this stuff disappear in a hurry. 

The recipe is also nice in that you can substitute random things for the bananas and get delicious results. I threw in strawberries and a little cayenne pepper once and got some tasty sweet and spicy bread from it.

Really good recipe for my three extremely overripe bananas, although I found it just a touch salty. I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar, with an additional dash of nutmeg. I will definitely make this again!

Great tasting recipe! I subbed half a cup of applesauce for one of the bananas because I only had two. (I sub apple sauce for bananas in many recipients so i knew it would be just fine) Everything else I followed as written.

I doubled the recipe & baked this delicious Banana Chocolate Chip Bread this morning. I did add some nutmeg, vanilla & used the mini chocolate chips. I also used half white & half brown sugar like some of the other bakers did. I measured out my mashed ripe bananas and it came out to be 2  1/2 cups for the doubled recipe. I will definitely make these again  :)

This is delicious! Per other reviews I did 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added some chopped up walnuts because I love banana nut chocolate bread! It was really yummy! I did bake it in a tin pan because I didn’t have glass. Overall it baked through but after the first try I noticed the top of the bread was a bit undercooked. Second time came out better, leaving it in 5-10min longer but I still have to experiment a little with the oven heat/time to get it 100% perfect.

These turned out wonderful. I doubled the recipe, but followed the recipe exactly other than that. Made 12 muffins and 1 loaf. Both were very moist and perfectly sweet.

Leave it in the oven for an extra 5-10 minutes after the oven is turned off to make sure the inside is cooked through. Used 4 bananas and you can taste it much better. Subbed applesauce for eggs and maple syrup instead of sugar. Super moist!

This was absolutely delicious! I will be making it again. I did use half a cup of brown sugar along with half a cup of white sugar. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla but otherwise followed the recipe. I used metal pan so I lessened the cooking time by 10 minutes. Tasty, moist and wonderful!!!

This was some of the best banana bread!  I listened to other reviewers and subbed all white sugar for 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  The bread started to brown too much during cooking, so I just covered it with aluminum foil until it was done.

oh this one is delicious with a few minor tweeks. 

I added a splash of vanilla.
I added 2-3 tablespoons of milk instead of just 1 to my mashed bananas. 
I used 2/3 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar. 
I added about 3/4 cup of pecans.

This turned out amazing! I added a half a cup of chopped walnuts which gave it the push it needed to be a 5 star bread to me and my family. It ended up needing 2 hours to cook for me, but my oven is old. Will definitely make it again.

In addition the the above mods (1/2 brown sugar, vanilla, nutmeg), I freezed my overripe bananas and then thawed them out... I also added 1/4 tsp ground cloves, and split batter into 3 mini loaf pans, used mini semi-sweet chocolate morsels, and baked at 325 (convection) for 47 minutes.

This is a truly excellent recipe. I did a little twist on the theme, swirling dollops of nutella through the loaf, and topping it with cacao chips. (Yep, on top of the chocolate chunks I switched for chips in the recipe). The bread was incredibly moist and flavourful. I would use this recipe again in a heartbeat! Of note: a lined pan is highly recommended with this recipe.

I made it with GF flour instead of all purpose flour, next time I will bake for 1 hour instead of 1 hour and 10 mins.
Taste great though.

Turned out very good!  I made a dozen muffins instead of a loaf. I ate two after they out after they cooled.  Also, instead of 1 tsp cinnamon, I used 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cardamom, and 1/4 tsp coriander.

This turned out better than I thought it would! The bread was super moist and it didn't take long for prep and clean up. I definitely recommend for breakfast or a tasty afternoon snack!

I doubled the recipe as I had bananas I didn’t want to waste. Increased the cinnamon by a teaspoon, added honey roasted pecan pieces, Special dark chocolate pieces and blueberries... cooked it in dark metal pans for 55 minutes and turned the oven off to cool it down and give it a few more minutes of cook time without burning the edges.. excellent recipe, super moist...

Really easy to make.  My husband loved it!!! Moist and flavorful, I made a double batch to freeze some and share.  I did add a splash of vanilla to the batter.  I also used mini chocolate chips which gives you chocolate in every bite.  Tastes like a chocolate covered banana.  Yummm.

My boyfriend LOVES banana bread and when I whipped out this one, it pretty much changed his life forever. My alterations: used partially thawed frozen bananas,  melted butter, and a chopped up chocolate bar (dark chocolate and espresso). SO delicious... tasted more like a cake than a bread. Making it again today for Valentines!

Love this recipe !! Took the advice of previous reviewers and did 1/2c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. It came out soooo delicious!! I probably should have greased the bottom more since it stuck. Not pretty, but oh so good ! This will be my go to recipe for banana bread!

Easy recipe to follow and was the best banana bread I have ever had. Our entire family loved it including the kids. We made two loaves and we ended up giving one to my wife’s parents because they liked it so much.

I made this bread.  1 cup of chocolate chips is too much.  It’s too sweet.  It’s over powering.  My 8 year old even says it’s too sweet and picked out the chocolate chips!  I would advise cutting them back.

I tried this recipe out last night, my additions to it was some walnut pieces. It came out absolutely delicious! I'm not a baker and have tried several other recipes which have come out somewhat on the dry side. I'm very impressed with this recipe and will definitely use it again.

I usually do not like banana bread, because most I've had are too sweet. I took a chance and made this bread today with the help of my boys who are learning to bake with me. We followed the recipe exactly.  It was very easy to make. It is delicious!! It is not too sweet! The chocolate chips make it even better. Thanks for sharing this recipe so I can actually enjoy banana bread, and cut down on the waste of ripe bananas.

I made this recipe, and made a few modifications. Instead of 1 cup sugar, I did half a cup. I also substituted the tablespoon of milk, for two tablespoons of plain yogurt. The bread came out moist, soft and delicious. I will be making this recipe again.

This is a good solid banana bread recipe which my family enjoyed.  I followed the recipe, except for adding some leftover chopped pecans to use them up.  My family prefers my standard banana bread, which calls for sour cream (giving it added moisture).  However, if I don't have sour cream on hand, I will make this bread again, but will probably try half brown sugar/half white sugar for a little more depth of flavor.

I baked this and it turned out delicious! Made some minor adjustment to my personal taste like less cinnamon, a little vanilla and nutmeg. Has anyone tried to add carrots to this? I’d love to hear how that turned out!

I'm giving this 5 stars based on it's ease of preparation, and the final presentation of the bread.  I made this for gifts, but never got the chance to taste it myself.  Whenever the recipients give me their feedback, I will update my review.  1/16/18:  One of the persons I gave this bread to says that it was very good!  Now I'm going to make one for myself!

This banana bread is amazing! Super moist and delicious. I did find that one recipe is enough for 2 loaf pans so I split it into two loaves instead of one. I also love nuts so I used 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup walnuts with some extra sprinkled on top. I love cinnamon so added extra as well as vanilla. I make this whenever I have bananas that need to be used!!

It was a nice tasting banana bread overall. I didn’t have any chocolate chips so I left those out and it still tasted good. I did find that it was a little dry but still good.

I also made the changes that were suggested by the other Bakers. I used one teaspoon of vanilla, I use Splenda and brown sugar Splenda in replace of the regular sugar because of diabetes.I used 3 1/2 bananas, I was not going to save a half of banana from that mornings cereal.  I also use milk chocolate chips because that's all I had on hand. Do not over bake, do not overmix. I made them as muffins. I will definitely make these again and I saved them in my recipe box they are that good.

VEGAN alterations so my whole family could enjoy: Subbed almond milk and used coconut oil in leu of butter. Omitted the eggs entirely as banana is a great binder on its own! Baked in two smaller loaf pans for 45 minutes. Turned out amazing!! Will definitely consider this a staple recipe!!

Very moist, I did add the 2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar as suggested and it came out great. This is also a good standard receipe for plain banana bread, banana nut bread etc. just take out the chips. I like how moist it is almost like a cake. very Delicious

The only changes I made were to cut down the amount of sugar by about half and mash an extra half-banana, but otherwise this recipe is wonderful. Super yummy banana bread

Made a couple of loaves of this delicious bread yesterday. My family loved it. I used Callebaut Belgian chocolate 60% cacao - amazing flavor. It took about 85 minutes in the oven to get a good bake - in brand new gas oven. Will keep this recipe for future use. Great job!

I had quite a few overly ripe bananas and decided to make this recipe. I followed it exactly except for using milk chocolate chips and baking it in a bundt pan. I let it cool 10 minutes, but parts of it stuck. Next time, I probably need to grease and flour the pan and let it cool for 15 minutes. Really good.

I followed the recipe and did a little tweak of my own. I used olive spread instead of butter, brown sugar instead of white, and dark chocolate chip instead of the semi sweet one. It turned out delicious! I would definitely try this again.

Great recipe. I left out the tablespoon of milk it I thought ithe batter looked a little loose.  I also made them in mini loaf pans, easier to pack in lunches. Because of this, I only needed to bake them for 30 minutes.

Ok so this is probably my 2nd review EVER for a recipe on the net and I'm not even kidding about it. 
This is hands down THE BEST BANANA BREAD I've ever had (and made). Seriously. The way it came out; I didn't add choc chip and didn't miss them either. I replaced butter with oil as I was out of butter (and its hot outside to go buy one), and it came out super soft, risen beautifully and tastes heavenly. THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE.

Oh my that's good! I subbed 1/2 the flour with whole wheat and added some vanilla. It's moist flavorful crisp crust just lovely. My loaf pan is missing and I was afraid the one I has was too shallow so I used an 8x8 and tweeked the bake time.

I followed many reviewers' advice and substituted half of the sugar with brown sugar, then I used 1/4 cup of coconut sugar, and 1/4 cup granulated sugar, and I also added in some chopped walnuts. I have to say, this is the most delicious batch of banana chocolate chip bread I have ever made! The bread was very moist and very filling! My whole family loved it, as well as my coworkers! Will definitely be making it again... waiting on the rest of my bananas to become super ripe!

Today is the third time I am making this wonderful recipe.  I made one loaf for one of my offices and the other for home.  Everyone LOVED it and couldn't get enough of it!  I don't eat carbs and sugar, but was tempted to taste what I baked. Omg, it was delicious!  So moist and delicious!  The chocolate chips are a nice alternative to nuts.  The third loaf is for another one of my offices.  Can't wait for them to try it!   I didn't change any of the ingredients but saw others added vanilla and substituted 1/2 of the sugar for brown sugar. Next time I may try that.  I definately recommend this recipe!

I followed the suggested tweak by splitting the 1 cup of sugar between ganulated and light brown and then I baked it in a bundt pan for 45 minutes.  The bread was perfect - moist and chocolatey.

I read the reviews and did the 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/2 C sugar, and also added 2 tsp vanilla. However, I really wished I cut way back on the salt... in my opinion 1 tsp is just too much. Most likely because I used salted butter instead of unsalted... but when I bit into it the bread just tasted salty even with my sugar/butter glaze poured over it... will try it again but will only do maybe 1/4 or 1/2 tsp salt if any at all.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 granulated.  I also turned off the oven at 60 minutes and left it in for the remaining 10 minutes.  It was super moist and delicious!

Was looking for a good banana chip muffin recipe and used this one instead.  Works just as well as muffins - Excellent recipe, followed other reviewers suggestions as well with the vanilla and sugar.  I accidentally put in 2 cups of chocolate chip though.  Too much baking, my mind is gone but it's still really tasty, just extra chocolaty.  Recipe yielded 17 muffins for me, baked at 325 for 23 min.

For the first time I made a recipe without looking at the reviews first. This was good, but I definitely will try the brown sugar and sugar mix. At the last minute after the bread was in the oven I thought I should have added vanilla extract. I always add vanilla extract to almost everything I bake. I hate this new oven I have but it cooked about 75 minutes instead of 70 and it was still moist. All in all good recipe will make the necessary adjustments for next time.

Followed the recipe exactly except coated the chips with a dusting of flour and made muffins.  It made about 28 muffins and they were a big hit!  Everyone loved them and I'll definitely be making them again!

I've tried making banana bread several times before, but every time the bread doesn't come out done inside! The timing and temp in this recipe had the bread perfectly golden on top and perfectly done inside. I used dark chocolate chips because dark chocolate is my favorite. Great taste! So happy i finally found my go-to banana bread recipe!

This was a great recipe! It was my first time making banana bread and it turned out perfectly. Like another reviewer suggested, I made muffins instead of a loaf of bread. I baked them at the recipe temp for 22 minutes and they were perfectly done. I didn't have any baking powder on hand, so I substituted 1/2 tsp of baking soda and 3/8 cup molasses. I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar like a couple of other people since I love  brown sugar! I brought some extras to work and had several compliments and requests for the recipe. Will make again!

This is my go-to recipe when I have bananas that need used up. Absolutely  delicious with a good balance of sweet and rich and always guaranteed to be moist! The only thing i ever change is I put 1/3 cup of brown sugar and 2/3 cup of white sugar, I enjoy the taste of the molasses in it.

I've made this twice and it's definitely a keeper.  Very easy to make and a great way to use those mushy bananas.  I did cover the top loosely with foil about halfway through cooking because it does take every bit of an hour to cook till done and the top gets browned really quickly (plus I sprinkled it generously with cinnamon sugar because....well....cinnamon sugar!) then removed the foil for the last couple minutes.

I made this and kept to the recipe except that I added walnuts and made them as muffins because I didn't have a loaf pan. It came out very good. It didn't have as much of a banana taste as I thought it would since the bananas I used were very ripe. I would make this again.

Fabulous and easy to prepare. I did all the mixing by hand and it still came out great. 
The only 2 changes I made were using 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar as well as dark chocolate chips.
Definitely a keeper!!!

I just made this today. My daughter loved it! 
1. I didn't have 3 ripe bananas, so I just put 1 (big) ripe banana, and halved all the other measurements and didn't put cinnamon(hubby not a big fan). 
2. Instead of 1 cup flour, I put 1/2 flour and 1/2 almond flour. 3. Put a lil less sugar (instead of 1/2 cup, 1/3 cup). 
Made muffin instead of bread, I could make 12 muffins, baked for 25 min. 
The muffins were so fluffy and amazing! Loved it going to make them often.

Here's the situation: You'e trying to be like all those people on Pintrest making pin-worthy loafs that will get shared again and again with captions like "Finding Balance with the occasional Sweet Treats" but you don't really know how to bake. You make this simple  recipe, take your loaf of b-bread to work, and whadudya know? People love you. You learn to love yourself. You no longer need social media. Thank you, AllRecipes. 

For real: It was super easy to throw this together. I reduced the amount of sugar in half, and added nutmeg to the cinnamon. It's definitely not as decadent, but will be perfect for breakfast coffee. Keep it in the oven for a solid 80 mins.

Made it yesterday for the first time.  Really good.  Super moist, which was surprising because my convection oven was set to 325 and I'd planned to take it out early.  I got involved in other things and forgot about it, so it was in ther for about 10 extra minutes and the top was very dark brown.  I was afraid it would be dry.  Not at all.  The only thing I would change is to add chopped walnuts for better texture.

Very fluffy and moist. I used the 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla. Hubby doesn't like chocolate with banana so I left out the chips and added 1/2 cup walnuts. Made 24 mini muffins and 12 regular size. The minis are yummy, the others are still in the oven. 12 min. on the minis.

This recipe had much too flour which ruined the texture. I also would use sweet chocolate chips and not semi sweet; I've used other recipes before which turned out really rich, I just thought I'd try something new but I won't be using this one again. Overall the bread did not have a moist , yummy chocolate taste.

This is an easy to make chocolate chip banana bread. My 9 year old helped me but could have easily made it on her own. Recipe was made with 4 alterations to the original. 1.) I used gluten Free Cup for Cup All Purpose Flour instead of regular flour. 2.) I used applesauce instead of butter. 3.) I added vanilla bean paste, about a teaspoon. 4.) I reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. The bread turned out perfectly, moist and delicious. It did take longer than 70 minutes to bake as other reviewers have stated. Mine took an extra 30 minutes.

I made the recommended substitutions such as half white sugar and half brown sugar, increased cinnamon and vanilla extract. I didn't have a glass loaf so I baked in a metal loaf pan at 300 degrees for about 75 minutes or so.  Cake was moist but not overly moist. Buttery texture but not overly so. Will add to my permanent rotation of recipes!

Used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar as others did and added a little vanilla because I love vanilla! Followed the recommendation and baked in a glass pan. Luckily I grabbed a slice that night since my son and his friends ate the rest of the loaf . Next time will hide some (or make two and hide one!).

The vanilla - cinnamon -- 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar modification is the best.

Very good indeed, I like to cook it as muffins. Vanilla rather than cinnamon for us. Sometimes I use coconut oil and butter, half and half. Always tasty.

When I made with 3 banana, the bread came out dry.  Today I made using 4 banana and came out better.  I also reduced the sugar instead of 1 cup, I used 2/3 cup and is just right.  This is so easy; no need for mixer.

Used an 8x8 pan but followed the recipe otherwise. Thought it was the perfect amount of moisture, and the chocolate chips were a great addition!

I loved it!  The only change I made to the recipe was 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, as some others had suggested.  I also cooked the bread as muffins.  They came out really beautiful and moist.  I baked them for about 25 minutes.

I didn't read the comments before making, so pretty much followed the recipe to a T.  The only thing I did change is I did not have 3 bananas (only 2) so I added a bit more milk and a little plain greek yogurt for moisture.  It turned out incredible!

The grandchildren loved this chocolate banana bread.  I followed the recipe exactly and the time in the oven was about right.  However I think you need to test it as ovens can vary.

I followed a suggestion I saw to do 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown instead of 1 cup white sugar, and I think that was a good call. Also, rather than 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips, I used around 2/3 cup of semisweet chips and 2/3 cup of pecans. I think I'm in love with this banana bread.

I followed the advise of others and went with 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar and loved it. Next time I would like to try adding almonds in as well.

Delicious! My very picky eaters love this recipe and always request it. I follow the  suggestions of others and use 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar, 2 tsp vanilla extract, mixed both dark and semisweet chocolate chips. I omit the nuts as well and bake them as cupcakes. Same temperature for about 20-23 mins

I made them into muffins and baked using a muffin pan instead of one big loaf  in a loaf pan coz I didn't have that at home (1 batch yielded a dozen), and I didn't have white sugar on hand so I used golden yellow sugar instead (ROGERS golden yellow sugar from the superstore)... turned out great. We all loved the muffins; a friend ate 5 muffins in one sitting. 
Btw, I used 4 bananas instead of 3, wasn't sure if the bananas were smaller than medium-sized so threw one more in just in case.
Also, I did about 20 minutes at 350 in the oven; then added around 3 minutes at 325 (approximately; just kept checking the oven to see how they looked).

I added a teaspoon of vanilla, about 1/2 cup walnuts, changed the sugar to 1/2 cup each white and brown sugar, and used Belgian semi-sweet chocolate chips that I got at the local chocolate shop.  It turned out excellent, but I'd use roughly half the chocolate next time.

This is a moist, choclatey, slice of  yummy. I tweaked it a bit by using all brown sugar, adding 1/2 cup flax seed,  using all whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt, and replacing the butter with an equal amount of coconut oil. It did take a bit longer to cook,  about 15 minutes longer. This is a recipe I will make again and again. My friends all loved it and wanted the recipe.

I had no butter in a blizzard so I used vanilla Greek yogurt instead (same amount as the butter). It came out delicious! It took 80 min to cook and the ends were a little dry in order to get the middle sone

I enjoyed this more than any other banana cake recipe I've ever made.  The only  difference was that I added only half a cup of sugar instead of one cup, found it quite adequate.

I made this today, doubled the recipe and baked it in a cake pan. It turned out absolutely perfect. I didn't alter any ingredients, just upped my baking time and watched it closely. It's like a jumbo loaf of deliciousness! I will definitely make this again.

also changed sugar to half brown half white, added some vanilla and nutmeg. Bread was pretty good, only baked it 55 minutes and it was 100% done not sure if my oven is super hot. Next time I would add another banana and maybe a bit more milk, bread came out a tad dry and not enough banana flavour but pretty good all the same

I made this and it took forever to cook  at that temperature.  I kept putting it back in for another 10 minutes.  I couldnt get the middle to cook.  The ends tasted awesome!  Very disappointed.

Tweek- I used wheat flower.(only bc it is was all I had in the house) It came out great. Got rave reviews from my mom who is the expert baker in the family.  I like the suggestions for vanilla and brown sugar and will try that next time.

AMAZING!!!!! I followed the advice of my fellow All Recipe cooks and did the half brown sugar, half white sugar, and added a double teaspoon of vanilla. The only other modification was that I wanted to give this away so I made it in three mini baking tins. If you use the mini tins the timing for this is 40 minutes exactly. I had absolutely no problem getting the bread out of the pan. It literally rolled right out of it. I had greased the pan with olive oil cooking spray.

The ONLY tweak I made was using milk chocolate chips :) I just prefer them. This recipe is a great starter recipe!  The bread is well formed, medium weight, great texture BUT lacks slightly on the banana flavor. I will be using it again and will make a couple changes myself :)

I doubled it and added 1 3/4 cup nuts and I only had 5 bananas so I added 1/2 cup applesauce. I also did half brown sugar and half white sugar and added vanilla.   I made muffins and bread and both were delicious.

I cannot get this recipe to cook through.  It says about 70 minutes, and I have had it in almost 80 and it is still not done.  It rose, but it won't cook through and I know the outsides are going to be dry by the time I get it out of the oven.

I made this recipe because I wanted something a little different from the regular banana bread.  This was fabulous.  I made it just like the recipe indicated. Very good heated up in the microwave with butter.  My husband loved it too.

I cut the sugar in half and made muffins instead.  Baked for 22 minutes and they turned out very moist. Really liked them and will make them again.

It was good. We really didn't like the addition of the chocolate chips.  They seemed flavorless, in comparison to the bread, and they made it fall apart too easily.

Amazing. I tweaked some things as other mentioned.... 1/2 C brown sugar  & 1/2 C white sugar instead of the 1 C of white. I also added nutmeg and a dash of allspice... and a little extra chocolate chips just because. It was great. I also cut the butter in because I didn't read the recipe all the way and used large bananas.

My son just told me this is better than my regular recipe but the only real difference in the two recipes was the brown sugar. I did half regular sugar and half brown plus added 1 tsp vanilla per review suggestions. I didn't have a whole cup of chips but 3/4 was plenty. I didn't measure the cinnamon just shook a little in. I baked it in an 11X7 glass Pyrex for about 35 mins. Last night we had it with a scoop of ice cream. I gave him a small piece with his cereal for breakfast this morning and he wanted some for snack when he got home from school. It's addicting. Thanks for the recipe.

Tasty Tasty Tasty. I made as written except for using milk chocolate chips. The second time I made it I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. They were better this way. Next time I will reduce the butter as well as this bread is very buttery using 1/2 cup.

I have made this recipe (1/2 brown sugar as others have suggested). Makes about 22-24 muffins after 22 minutes at 325 degree oven. I am not a very good baker. But this recipe is a winner for me every time. I have had to make this four times in just the last 3 months. My son requests this muffin every school morning! I freeze them then defrost in microwave about 20 seconds and into the toaster oven for 7 min!

Great recipe, thanks for sharing! Definitely will make again.  My changes were: substituted coconut oil for butter, brown sugar for white and reduced the amount to 2/3 C, added 2 tsps vanilla extract, and used whole wheat flour.  Half the recipe made 9 regular sized muffins, baked at 325 for 20 min and they turned out really moist and fluffy.  Another user recommended 22 minutes, so next time probably will bake them 2 more minutes just to see if it makes a difference.

If you like a little dark (not too hard) crust, with a nice balance between airy and dense interior to your banana bread, this is it.  Added vanilla per other reviewers, but the texture of this bread is excellent.

I used 4 bananas (small) and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla. The bread is so moist and chocolaty...served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert last night. The grandkids loved it.

This is an incredibly moist and delicious banana bread. I've tried a number of banana bread recipes and this is by far my favorite. This bread is full of flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. The texture is moist and just firm enough - not too cakey, not too bready. I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract into the banana mixture and I like the way it tastes! I used a convection oven and it took more than 70 minutes (more like 80) when I baked it in a ceramic loaf pan.

The best banana bread I have tasted. I followed the recipe (adding 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to taste) and made muffins. I hate changing any recipe before I've tried it, but I only had 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, so I also added 1/2 cup of raspberries.  The recipe made 18 muffins and I baked them at 325 degrees F for 30 minutes. They came out light, fluffy and super moist. The raspberries worked really well with the chocolate. Definitely a keeper - only problem is, you can't eat just one!

I made this for my husband, the only thing I changed was using peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips.  It turned out amazing!  It was also a big hit at the office...will definitely make again.  Now when hubs goes to the store he intentionally buys extra bananas!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and I got a nice, moist, sweet bread.  The only problem I experienced with the recipe is I am new to high altitude baking and the center fell a little.  I really liked this bread and will certainly make it again when I have those too ripe bananas on the counter.

I only had 2 and a half bananas, so I added  1/4 cup of sour cream to make up the difference. We used mini semi sweet chocolate chips. I did do half white sugar and half brown sugar and added a bit of vanilla.  I took it out at 45 minutes because we like ours a bit gooey in the middle. This bread tasted so good still warm. The kids n husband, and myself of course, loved it. Thank you for this recipe.

Super moist and delicious. I substituted Stevia for sugar and it was still amazing. I also only used 3/4 C of chocolate chips and it was plenty. This will be my  go-to banana bread recipe.

It was still moist despite having to be adapted for the high altitude of Denver. I baked it at 375 degrees, reduced the baking powder by a 1/4 tsp and added a TBS more milk.

I had 4 small, overly ripe bananas I needed to use quickly.  This recipe sounded really promising so I tried it.  I am SO happy because my family loves it!  It's now our favorite homemade bread.  I have made this 3 times now.  
Plus, after reading reviews of others, I tried different sweeteners with equalling the correct amount of 1 cup.  I mixed sugar, brown sugar and Splenda - different amounts to equal 1 cup.  They all tasted great.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  :-)

not what i was expecting :/ i thought iwould like it from all the good reviews. Made it exactly as stated. i thought i would enjoy the cinnamon because i love cinnamon but it shouldnt be in banana bread... was to out of the norm tasting for my banana bread! also could taste a lot of baking soda or something.. i mixed everything well so that wasnt the issue. unfortunately just not to my standards of banana bread! but we ate it and it is edible.. just not what i was hoping for at all :/

This recipe is perfect. Super moist and delicious. At first I thought it would taste too sweet but wow! I used a pumpkin pie spice mix instead of just cinnamon, but other than that there were no substitutions. Will always come back to this recipe

I've made this recipe twice with a few adjustments. I used 1 cup brown sugar instead of white,  1 extra ripe banana (so a total of 4), 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon, and added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the banana mixture. I also used dark chocolate chips (yum!). I used a 6-muffin pan (it makes 12) and heated it for 25 minutes-- it was delish!

Totally awesome.  We are not big banana bread lovers but I had some bananas that really really needed to be used.  Found this recipe on Allrecipes and like many others used half white and half brown sugar.  My husband and I ate half the loaf after it came out of the oven.  Exceptionally good!

I made muffins instead of bread 22 mins at 325. Prefect! They are really good, I used dark chocolate morsels and added a half cup I rough chopped pecans. Half cup of Brown and white did the trick and a large pinch of nutmeg.

It was okay. The flavor of the chocolate chips was so strong for me that it made the rest of the bread taste bland by comparison. If I were to make it again I might add nuts or some other flavors to give the rest of the bread a bit more oomph.

This bread was absolutely moist, delicious and easy to make.  My oven runs hot so I only cooked it for 50 minutes and it came out great. I took others suggestions and added 1 tsp of vanilla but kept the recipe the same other than that. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe, very easy to follow. For our family, half a cup of sugar was more than enough. I might even do less next time.

Ummmmm, this was SO good!  I scanned through other reviews and added the vanilla, and the 1/2 brown sugar along w/ the 1/2 white sugar, NO nutmeg though.  I added a smidge more choc chips, and used organic bananas and gluten free flour.  This one is a keeper!  My 12 year old son loved it!

I have made this recipe 5 times and I absolutely LOVE it! It turns out perfect every time.  It isn't hard at all and I made it after I came home from the hospital after having a baby and had it for breakfast the next few days. Bringing it to the cabin this weekend and I know it will be a big hit. Thanks!!

I've made this many times and have adapted it per suggestions and my own ideas. The 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar is the standard now. I also add 2 different kinds of chocolate chips (minis and chunks), pecans, extra cinnamon, and at least 1 tsp. vanilla. I use Einkorn flour (easier on a gluten-sensitive stomach). The result is always great -- my go-to banana bread.

The best banana chocolate chip bread I have had or made. I used half the amount of white sugar and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Also have made it with half butterscotch chips and half chocolate and it was fabulous!!!!

Super yummy! I made it with half whole wheat and half white flour. Definitely need to melt the butter not just soften. Could reduce the chocolate chips a bit.

My only sadness is that I made two batches  instead of simply splitting the recipe into two pans.
It exploded all over my oven before I realized it and could emergency pan beneath them. 
Still delicious.
Just know it to only fill the pan halfway.

Very good. I modified as follows:  1 extra banana, 1 t vanilla, 1/2 t nutmeg, 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c of white sugar, 1 1/2 c chocolate chips. I made these into muffins and mini muffins. Will make again.

This could easily become a staple in my baking rotation. It's as easy as any banana bread recipe, and the chocolate adds a touch of decadence. Yes!

I've made this going on 5 times and it's delicious. I've had to make some changes though. I'm not sure how people are getting a perfect bake without reducing the temp and upping the time. I set the temp at 250 and bake it for 90 minutes give or take. If I do the 350 for 60mins, as directed, then I get a dry outer layer and a completely uncooked inner layer. I also like splitting the amount of white sugar and using half brown sugar, but it tastes great either way. I also use milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet, and I use 3-4 overripe bananas instead of measuring as dorected

Great recipe. Tweaked a little: less sugar, more cinnamon and a teaspoon vanilla. Very moist cake :)
Baked it in a bread metal pan and left it in the oven for fifty minutes.
It's perfect.

This was delicious! I did substitute milk choc chips for semi-sweet because that's what I had on hand. Also, I used a bundt pan.  It was the first thing to go at the school breakfast.

I used half whole wheat and half white flour, and brown sugar instead of white. I also doubled the recipe because I had 6 brown bananas to use and it came out fabulous!  I liked the fact that it called for so many bananas which is why I chose to test this recipe. My kids loved it and they ate it all up in a flash. I will definitely make it again.

I've made this about 3 times now and I love it. It's very moist and taste great. However, I usually add a bit more cinnamon because I love it and sometimes I'll also add half semi sweet and milk chocolate chips.

Warning: very addicting!  This is probably one of my favorite banana bread recipes I've ever made, with a few modifications - 1/2 cup white sugar; 1/2 cup brown sugar; 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon; 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg;  1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  Super moist, perfectly sweet and #scrumptious!!

The best Banana Bread ever!! I added 2 tsp of vanilla,  1/2  cup of brown and white sugar as suggested. Since I live in a high elevation, I added 2 Tablespoons of flour.

Couldn't give it 5 stars as I made the changes others suggested (1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white, 1 tsp vanilla).  It was absolutely delicious and incredibly moist.  I used 3 large bananas.  Will definitely make this again!

I always use the exact recipe the first time I make something so no, no changes.  I may try some of the ones in the reviews but that is a big may.  The recipe turned out a delicious, perfect chocolate chip banana bread as is.  I baked it just before I went to bed and my menfolk had eaten half of it before I even got up this morning.

This is a good recipe. I added ingredients that help with lactation including wheat germ, Brewers yeast and oatmeal. I also subbed in sliced almonds and organic whole wheat flour and just added a bit more milk and it turned out great and healthy tasting! The only thing that I'm surprised about is that this recipe does not call for vanilla extract...I think I'll add a bit next time ;)

This is the best recipe for banana bread that you will ever find.
We made ours with crushed pecans instead of chocolate chips, and it was amazing.

Deelish!  All this cooking to get my son to try a banana!  I made a few changes to make it look appealing.  I added  2 T of cocoa powder with an additional T of milk and instead of chocolate chips I used mini M&M's - love the colors!.  In an attempt to add protein and fiber I used 1 cup oat flour with 1 cup regular white flour, 2 T ground flax and an additional egg.  With full cheeks husband and son give it a thumbs up!

This Recipe was great. I made some minor adjustments. Used 4 bananas instead of 3 because I have small bananas. Also adjusted baking time cos I had a non glass pan and this makes a difference. Bake until center is dry when you put a tooth pick but still soft. Make sure you let it sit after baking. This helps a lot. Taste was amazingly amazing:) Alone was great and added some Nutella on top of couple for presentation. Totally recommend.

After reading the comments, I doubled the recipe (only switching cinnamon for vanilla and switching 1/2 the white sugar for brown) and made it... DELICIOUS and oh so moist!! It was a liiiiittle too sweet for me but everyone else loved it! I'm going to try it with 1/2 the chocolate chips next time but thank you so much for the recipe!!!

First time I've ever made banana bread and the entire family loved it. I made with GLUTEN FREE flour because one of my kids has Celiac disease. I also used both brown and white sugar. The next time I'll cut down to two bowls and just add the bananas, milk and cinnamon after my sugar and eggs are mixed together. I'm really not much on baking so if I can make this, anyone can.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is amazing!!!  I did add about a TB of vanilla and 2 cups of mini chocolate chips.  Also, I used 3/4 C brown sugar (not white sugar).  I just prefer the brown sugar and vanilla and have two boys, which is the reason for more chocolate chips.  They both LOVED them!  I thought the recipe was pretty awesome myself!

I made it once, it was good and then I followed the suggestions of some of the commentators. I added a tsp of vanilla (I kept the tsp of cinnamon) and I changed it to half a cup of sugar, half a cup of brown sugar. It was great! I would definitely make it again. I also made a double batch and cooked one "regular" size loaf and two slightly smaller loaves.

Best banana bread i ever have.  My daughter has a dairy/soy allergy so I substituted hemp milk and Earth Balance Dairy/Soy free spread and it was still AMAZING.  YUM

Loved this recipe!  I read many reviews and edited to use the half and half sugars (brown and white) and the vanilla.  It was moist and spectacular!

Turned out great...followed couple of suggestions. 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar. Also used metal pan greased and it came out just fine. Moist and delicious recipe that is easy to make.

So good. I love this recipe and so does everyone else who has tasted it! Instead of making a loaf, I put these into cupcake tins and make little muffins. That is the only thing I change and they come out perfect every time! Thank you for this recipe!

I made a couple of changes: 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 granulated sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, decreased the chocolate chips to heaping 1/2 cup.  This is moist but not soggy.  the best recipe I have come across, yet, for banana bread.

It was fabulous!  I made it into mini muffins, used gluten free flour, one half brown sugar and one half white, one fourth cup butter and one fourth cup canola oil,  and added one teaspoon vanilla.  Definitely will make these again and again.

Love this! I served it to several friends who also liked it, including one who is not a banana bread person. He ate multiple slices. Really enjoyed it. (I took the suggestion of others to use 1/2 brown and 1/2 granular sugars.)

Yummy recipe! I only made one adjustment... Reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. Cooked it for the recommended time etc. came out delicious! I also didn't add salt too. The chocolate chips (I used mini) and bananas were sweet enough and 1/2 cup of sugar was plenty! Thanks!!

Love this recipe. Only one I use now... Sooo good, and my 2 year old loves it too! I have made it as it is, and i have tweaked it and it is very forgiving no matter what you do... I have even used half whole wheat, half coconut flour with honey, and more banana instead of the sugar...i have used this recipe as cupcakes and mini cupcakes too.  Also freezes well!

I made the chocolate chip bread, but added a little vanilla to the mixture.....came out light, moist, and so amazingly good that the kids and my husband devoured it in one day. This is a bread that doesn't last long in our house!

Definitely use 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar. I also subbed vanilla instead of cinnamon and doubled the milk.  My pan is aluminum also, so I followed a reviewer suggestion to turn the oven off after an hour and just let the bread sit in there for ten more minutes. It's a keeper.

Very moist and delicious bread! I was slightly worried it would't turn out since I didn't have an electric mixer on hand, but hand mixing turned out to be just fine. I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 white sugar. Will make again!!

I would definitely make this chocolate chip, banana bread.
I only made 3 small changes: added vanilla extract, used water instead of milk and added cinnamon to the flour mixer and the banana mixer.
Anyways, thank you for the recipe and i really loved it and i will post a pic soon!
Thanks:)

Makes a lot of batter! I would suggest an 8x8 pan or muffins, because in the recommended glass loaf pan it burned on the bottom before baking in center.  Taste was good though, after cutting off the burned bottom! I cut back on sugar and my kids still liked it...used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup stevia.

I've made this recipe twice so far and both times it turned out fantastic. The first time I used 8 oz. Chocolate Chips. The second time I used 4 oz. Chocolate Chips and 4 oz. Pecans. Next, I will be using 8 oz. Reese's Peanut Butter Chips! Can't wait! It's so moist, delicious, and easy. The hardest part is waiting for the bananas to ripen!

I made this, but I had to rework it a bit. As it says 3 bananas, I googled the equivalent in cups, which said 3 bananas equals 1 cup. After I thawed and mashed my bananas, I had 4 cups...so I quadrupled the recipe. It was so dry, I couldn't even get all the flour/dry ingredients to mix in. I ended up thawing another 7 bananas to get a decent consistency. :-/. I then added extra chocolate chips and also added walnuts. The end product was delicious!

Like other reviewers I also used 1/2 c. white & 1/2 c. brown sugars but I used almost a T. of vanilla. I used 4 bananas instead of 3 and made muffins so I could make 1/2 chocolate chip and 1/2 without. Made this way we ended up with 16 muffins. Very moist!

This recipe came out exactly the way it should have.  I made it because I had a lot of old bananas to use up and I was trying different banana bread recipes because my boyfriend doesn't like my grandma's recipe.  He likes chocolate chips in his banana bread.  I hate them in banana bread.  That said, this recipe was easy to follow and I made it as described.  Neither of us liked it that much.  He would recommend using sweet chocolate chips.

I made this for and took it into work and it was a huge hit! I used 5 bananas though because they had to go! I also did 1/2 c semi sweet and 1/2 c milk chocolate chips because that was what I had :-)

I loved it but next time I would use slightly less chocolate chips, maybe 2/3rd cup instead of a whole cup, but it was fantastic

Just made this and it was wonderful! Moist on the inside and a nice crust on the outside. 

I made some of the recommended changes and added 2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 cup white sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of 1 cup all white sugar.

I also didn't have any chocolate chips, so I used raisins instead. Love it!

SO GOOD! SO EASY! First time making banana bread and it turned out perfectly :).  Did 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar as suggested.  Added 1/4 tsp vanilla and baked 16 muffins for 20 minutes.

I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and a little extra cinnamon.  I also used whole wheat flour and omitted about a quarter cup of sugar and it turned out perfectly! I'll be adding this to my cool weather baking collection!

This is the third time I've made this bread and I think I've got it down pat. Like some other folks I made a few changes. Added 1 tspn vanilla extract, 1/2 tspn nutmeg, used about 1/4 cup of sour cream instead of the milk. I just love sour cream. Make sure to mix your chocolate chips into the flour mixture so they don't all fall to the bottom and then add into the liquid.  Baked for 65 minutes instead of 70 but that depends on your oven. The house smells soooo delicious!

Made this recipe exactly as written, except that I used a dark metal pan rather than a glass one. Next time I will try half brown sugar and half white as other reviewers have recommended, but I think it's pretty good as-is!

This bread was delicious! Moist, and with just the right amount of banana. Instead of sugar, we used evaporated cane juice and pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon. It turned out beautifully! My two daughters were also able to make this (with supervision), and it turned out fabulously.

This recipe is delicious just the way it is!  I did not add a thing.  I was too lazy to get out the mixer to beat the butter and sugar, etc. So I used a potato masher to mash the butter and sugar in with the banana mixture.  That was the only thing I did differently and it still turned out amazing.  My son shared it with his friends at school and their moms asked me for the recipe.  So yeah, a total hit in my house.  It disappeared quickly!

Really good moist and fluffy! I swap milk for mayo, and an extra banana, makes it richer but no changes are necessary.

Was all excited to make these, had mixed up the batter and discovered my kids had eaten all my chocolate chips.  As I was searching through the pantry I found some pecans and craisins (cranberries), so I threw in a cup of craisins and 1/2 cup of pecans.  They were awesome!  Not the chocolate fix I wanted but still very good.  I made muffins and cooked them at 325 for 24 min.  I also used half cup of white sugar and a 1/2 cup brown sugar and 4 bananas.  Will definitely try again with chocolate chips.

This was probably one of the best banana breads I've ever had, definitely the best I've ever made. Everyone who's tried it has loved it. 
I made a few changes. I used half a cup each brown sugar and white; 4-1/2 bananas (because that was what I had) and therefore I needed an additional half cup of flour to get the correct consistency; I added a cup of chopped walnuts at the same time as the chocolate chips; for some added texture I threw in half a cup of shredded unsweetened coconut with the banana mash. I'll probably up that to a cup next time. Also I made this as muffins. I greased my muffin tins with coconut oil and baked them for 30 minutes at 350°. I got exactly one dozen muffins. I think it would work well as mini muffins too.
All in all, a great recipe. Will absolutely make again.

This banana bread tasted very salty to me. I followed the recipe exactly and I probably should have read the reviews first. Definitely use less salt. Maybe the brown sugar would help with that.

This was my first attempt at banana bread and it was definitely a success.  Easy to make - especially for someone like me who isn't a "baker" - and absolutely delicious.  It was a hit with everyone.

So delicious!  This is my go-to banana bread.  I adjust it to be dairy-free.  I substitute (1/2 cup) coconut oil for the butter.  I use dairy free chocolate chips and almond milk instead of regular milk.  I have a dairy allergic toddler.  Oh and I took other's suggestion to do 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  And I usually add 1/2 tbsp of vanilla but forgot to this time.   This banana bread is a HUGE hit!  It takes 75-85 minutes at 325 for me using a glass loaf pan.  It must be due to my substitutions.

YUMMY! The BEST basic banana bread recipe I've tried so far. I tweaked the recipe as well.  I only added 1/2 cup of white sugar, no brown sugar, added 1/2 cup of walnuts, 1/2 cups of chocolate chips, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and topped it with a simple chocolate cream cheese frosting. Also it's pretty sticky so the best way to go is the glass pan. It's not a metal friendly batter at all.

This turned out pretty good. I followed the recipe except I didn't have baking soda so I used a total of 4tsp of baking powder and omitted the salt. I wish it were a little more banana tasting. Next time I might add another banana and cut the amount of cinnamon in half.

Wonderful bread! Easy to make.  I used dark chocolate chips instead of semisweet and it turned out wonderfully.  I had to cook it almost fifteen minutes longer than what the recipe called for, but that might have just been my oven.  I will definitely be making this again!

I love this one!  I made it into eight mini-loaves.  I modified the recipe by adding a cup of chopped apple and half a cup of walnuts.  (I should have added more walnuts).  I brushed the dark metal pan with oil, and removed them straight after, and they didn't stick.

LOVE this recipe!!

Used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat.  Used applesauce instead of oil.  Added 2 tsp of vanilla.   Also used 60% cocoa chips.  Very good bread!

I made a double batch, because I had 6 bananas that were over ripe. I doubled everything, but I think next time I might only use 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips. My husband says all he could taste was the chocolate. I LOVED it just the way it is!

We found that using parchment paper instead of greasing the pan helped to ensure the outside wouldn't burn. It worked out perfectly! This recipe was very good! My friend and I made it with Reese's peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips and it was delicious.

This recipe is PERFECT!! I usually make the recipes with sour cream to give it that extra moistness, but this recipe is perfect as is. So moist and very delicious. I made them as muffins, baked for about 22 min as another reviewer suggested. Made about 20 muffins. (Maybe would have made more if I could stop licking the spoon!) This is the best banana bread recipe I've ever come across!!!

I got a crazy craving for banana bread late this evening.  So here I am making it 9 pm.  I get my first bite and it was worth the late night effort.  So moist and delicious.  I have made it before and followed the recipe.  Its a huge hit at my fire house when I bring some in to work.  I think the longest a loaf lasted was MAYBE 30 minutes.  I love this stuff!

FANTASTIC! My fiancé hates cake, so for his birthday I made this. He's also not a huge fan of chocolate (silly, right?). So, I changed the 1cup semisweet chocolate chips to 1/2cup and added 1/2cup  walnuts. PERFECT. Nothing better than bananas, chocolate and nuts.

Thanks for posting!

Easy to make, had all of the ingredients, only alteration I made was I did a half a cup of chocolate chips ans the other half peanut butter chips. Took a lot longer than 70 minutes, probably 7 to 8 extra.

I doubled recipe. Changes I made, did 1 cup white and 1 cup whole wheat flour but I took out 4 tablespoons of the whole wheat flour. 1 cup of brown sugar, used 1 cup of egg white mix. 1 tsp salt, since I used salted butter, bananas were close to 2 cups. Baked for 26 mins.

Picture perfect results, and super moist and tasty!   I doubled the recipe which was just the right amount to made 5 gift-size breads.  I used 3 c. white flour and 1 c. whole wheat flour, 1 c. white sugar and 1 c.  brown sugar and  buttermilk instead of regular milk.  In addition to 2 t. of cinnamon, I also added 1 t. vanilla, 1/2 t. allspice and 1 t. freshly grated nutmeg.  I used my potato ricer to mash the bananas -- got the job done.  Baked in about 45 minutes at 325º.  New go-to recipe!

Awesome! Moist and delicious. At high altitude I baked it for about 82 minutes. Also used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. Nice caramel flavor and delicious!

Turned out really good. I added 1 cup of pecans and ommited the chocolate. I thought it would be too sweet since I had planned on topping with a maple glaze. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup regular per a majority of the comments. I didn't even consider cutting back on cinnamon (1 t is not that much with the dense ingredients). I actually had a glass loaf pan and cooked it for 55 minutes. I had enough batter to make 6 muffin tops too. Very easy recipe.

These are excellent. I like to make them a bit healthier, so I used 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour instead of 2 cups reg. flour. I also dropped sugar to 1/4 cup and added 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of rest of sugar. Also used dark chocolate chips. Husband loves them too! These are a keeper!

I made this tonight because I had some leftover bananas that were going to go bad. It turned out to be fantastic! I don't usually like banana bread, so if that tells you anything, this is amazing!! 

Grease the pan really well though because a portion of the bottom of the loaf stuck to the pan when I made it.

I made this recipe and OMG delicious!! I tweeked it a little bit, I doubled everything but used cane sugar instead of white granulated sugar, and I used baking flour. I also added in 2 cups of oatmeal (the old fashioned oats) and a splash of vanilla. Tiny bit dry (probably because of the oatmeal) so I'll add a bit more milk next time but this was a great recipe!

I enjoyed this very much. I have several tweaks, of-course, as most of us do, the half and half sugar/brown sugar and vanilla extract tweak. But when I first made this it was to recipe for the most part and it came out great. I made several other little tweaks later on, but this recipe as it sits is nice...

This was DELICIOUS!  I did like others suggested and used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla as suggested. It was very moist and very delicious. I am definitely saving this recipe and will use it the next time I get some ripe bananas.

This is an excellent recipe.  I did half white sugar and half brown, and I also added 1 tsp vanilla and a dash of nutmeg.  I baked mine in a silver metal pan, and it was not done after 70 minutes.  It took mine about 1.5 hours to bake all the way through.  My toddler LOVES this!  He started screaming when his piece was all gone, and then he licked the plate!

This recipe is wonderful!  Made this on a whim last night since I had some extra ripe bananas.  Very moist and flavorful.  Used 4 bananas, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 1 tsp of vanilla and the remaining ingredients.  Also, followed another's advice by turning off the heat at 55 minutes and let bread finish baking in oven for the last 15 minutes.  Will definitely make again.. maybe in muffin tins next time. Thanks for this lovely recipe!

I am not a big banana fan, but the recipe turned to be too yum, everyone at home loved it. I didn't have bread pan at home so made in other pan, just make sure if the pan is not as deep as bread pan it would be ready in 45 min.

This recipe was good apart from the amount of salt that goes in. I'd only put half as much in so you couldn't taste it

I did a few changes and they are as follows: Used one bowl for starters...put eggs, butter, bananas (used 4) into food processor...did dry ingredients, 1C wheat flour and 1C white including cinnamon in a bowl...added walnuts and choc. chips plus mixture from processor...mixed it all up and put it into a 9x5 glass baking chip..baked for a little more than 70 minutes..really tastes good and so simple.

Good. However, 70 minutes would be waaaaay too long to bake this. Yikes. I had it in the oven for 55 minutes and even that was too long. I'll make it again, but will definitely take it out much sooner.

Banana Chocolate Chip Bread Allrecipes.com Made this and it's Yummy ? I I Added 1tsp vanilla Extract, to the Cinnamon Banana milk mix. For Chocolate I had 1/2 cup Dark Choc Chips and 1/2 Reese's Choc chips. Used 8x8" Glass pan and size was still perfect. If you don't have ripe bananas just put them in a cookie sheet in the oven for 40 min and let cool for 30 min ( can put them in the fridge to speedup the cooling process).

I substituted 1/4 cup of coconut flour for 1 cup of the AP flour.  Then I further reduced the AP to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of cocoa.  Omitted the cinnamon and added chocolate chips.  It's a favourite with the kids.

Made this with some bananas that were going bad on my counter, and it was amazing. The only thing I changed was that I put in a splash of vanilla and made it in a bundt pan with some walnuts sprinkled on the bottom -- incredibly moist with just the right amount of chocolate. will definitely make this again!

This is a very yummy and moist bread! It was best fresh out of the oven because of its caramelized crust (I baked it in a silicon loaf pan). I'm allergic to eggs, so I subbed an additional two tbsp of milk and two tbsp ground chia seeds. The only other mod that made is that chocolate chips came in a 300g bag, so I just dumped the whole thing in. :)

Delicious, moist and easy!   I have made this as a loaf and had great success, but I prefer these as muffins/mini-muffins so I can cut down on cooking time and send them as treats in school lunches.  I follow the recipe almost exactly, except I like to add an extra banana and I use a heaping tsp of cinnamon.  The cinnamon gives this product a little edge over other banana breads.  As muffins these freeze great!  I have made this recipe close to a dozen times and highly recommend it!

Good recipe, it's my first time making it.  I made it exactly the way it says, but I think next time I make it, I'll replace 1/2 cup of white sugar with brown like the other review says.  I used a non-stick pan instead of a glass pan, greased it, the loaf comes out no problem at all.  I also would add 1-2 teaspoon of vanilla extract next time.  Very yummy, my family loves it.

Came out fantastic. I did the 1/2 sugar 1/2 dark brown sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla and its really good. For some reason I had to leave it in my oven for 15 extra minutes and up the temperature from 325 to 350. Then again that might just be my oven. Definitely gonna try this recipe again but change the oven temp to 350.

This is a good recipe but like some others I added vanilla extract (2 tsp). I feel it needed one more banana so I will try 4 next time. Overall, it was good.

Awesome recipe! Moist and delicious. I made a coffee cake topping of 2 tbsp of melted butter half cup of brown sugar  1/4 tsp of cinnamon and pecans mixed then drizzled over the top. It made the muffins very sweet and decadent. I also added 2 tsp of vanilla to the banana mixture and used half cup of brown half cup white sugar. They turned out dynamite. The muffins only need 22 min at 350

Easy to make, and very delicious. I did what the other reviews said by using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, also added vanilla. Yum!

I made these into cupcakes, followed the recipe exactly but added 1/2c of chopped pecans. Everyone loved them! My hubby ate 3 within 5 minutes. Keeping this recipe!

This came out really well with only 1 small substitution. I used mini choc. chips instead of regular ones. The regular ones seem to sink to the bottom of the pan and make the bread stick. I also greased and floured the pan so it would slide right out. I HATE when the bottom of the bread sticks! It was tasty and moist. I'd recommend it.

Delicious! I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and also used half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white. I used both milk chocolate and semi-sweet chips, came out perfect. Great with a glass of milk

This recipe came out great, my family loved it and my mom wanted me to make another one for her coworkers, they loved it too. I made one to bring into my brother in the city outside town but it got eaten before we left.
