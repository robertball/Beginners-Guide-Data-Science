Okay, this is how to make them look like full cupcakes, bake another batch in regular cupcake papers, filling only half way. Take those cupcakes and put them on top of the baked ice cream cone cupcakes frosting them together, and voila! you have nice BIG full "scoops" of cake

Works just a well with a cake mix.  Just be sure not to overfill the cones as it will be a big mess.

very simple and fun. I used boxed cake mix and the kids loved it. The flat bottom cones fit perfectly in a mini muffin tray.

Made these and received rave reviews!!! Kids and moms liked them a lot. Have fun with it : ) Also to use a a carrier , I used a clothes box (put together) and traced the bottom of the ice cream cone onto to it. (just a little bigger than the cone itself) Make the amount of circles that you need for the amount of cupcakes made then cut out the circles. I covered with tinfoil and poked the a hole in the center of the circle and tucked the foil underneath. This helped with the decorating to. Hope it helps.

I love this recipe!  I cheated and used a cake mix, but my toddler son who is allergic to cow's milk finally got to have "i cweam in a cone" once it was frosted and showered with sprinkles.  Even my husband couldn't turn them down!

These are great! Served at my son's 6th birthday party, the kids went wild for them. I used milk chocolate cake mix and a combo of chocolate and white fluffy icing, the kids like the chocolate and the adults enjoyed the white icing. The cones were nice and crunchy really good. I did have to use 2 cake mixes to make 24 cupcakes and had enough left over for a small 2 layer. Worth making!!

Works for both sophisticated entertainment (see photo) or fun kid parties.  It doesn't taste extraordinary, but is a cute idea.

I made these for my 4 year old's birthday party, then let the kids decorate them on their own.  The kids seemed to really enjoy it, but when I decorated one for me, I was disappointed with the consistency of the cone and the cake together.

Made these for my daughters 3rd birthday, all the kids loved them!!  I used a package of colored cones (blue, pink & purple).  I also made them a day before, which resulted in the cone being a bit chewy, but no one seemed to care.  I also made them with strawberry boxed cake mix.  A tip I found online: for storage/traveling, use an empty egg carton turned upside down with holes cut out for each cone- worked perfectly.

I made these for my son's 3rd birthday and they were quite a hit! I had these many years ago at another party and unless you have an VERY tasty cake recipe, these will taste bland. I don't like buying store bought items, however for this I did buy a vanilla cake mix and it was quite tasty. I also made an amazing frosting from this site - White Cake Frosting 1 and piped it onto the cones. They literally looked like ice cream cones from Dairy Queen! Add some little sprinkles, crushed cookies - whatever you like! Thanks so much for this recipe!!

I filled my cones only 1/2 way and then topped them with actual ice cream instead of frosting.  This was a great "cake and ice cream" treat.

Nice idea, but didn't work too well for me. It made the cones get really soft. I guess if you eat them right away it would be ok, but you can't make them for the next day.

I love this recipe! It is so creative, and everyone always loves these tasty treats! I frosted them with a large star tip and they looked just like a soft-serve icecream, especially when I added sprinkles.

This gets 3 stars because it was cute. I used mini ice cream cones to make it look super adorable. That was a success. However, taste wise..Negative! The cones got incredibly soggy over time. So if you make these, I would suggest eating them within an hour. However, I did manage to get a nice picture out of these. =)

I had a tough time trying to figure out out how to get these to my Daughters class without them falling over and making a mess. My first idea was to cut holes into a card board box to support them, too much work. Then I thought of dropping them into a paper/wax cup. Once you drop the cupcake cones into the cups then place all of them into a cardboard box, cover with plastic wrap wallah...zero casualties.

I loved this idea - I also also cheated tho (box mix) but I used a piping bag with a star tip and made it look like soft serve with jimmies.  My daughter's preschool class was over the moon!!!

awesome, fun recipe, the cake in the cone was a bit not all there in flavor and texture but as a prebaked recipe it was cool. Next batch will be made with strawberry cake mix.

My 5 yr old daughter wanted a "Glee" (TV show) themed Birthday party and I searched high and low for an acceptable cake.  I ended up using these, and staged them with Chocolate icing as "microphones".  HUGE HIT!!!

i used this recipe for the idea and the baking times but used another cake recipe.  what a really cute idea!  i made these for my daughter's 2nd birthday as her treat to take into daycare.  the kids loved them and it was less messy for them to hold the cones in their hands.  i had no issues with the cone bottoms burning, and i baked them on baking sheets.

Made them for a bake sale. I used boxed mix just because I had it on hand. I put them in a plastic cup and added M&Ms at the bottom. Very cute.

I actually didn't try this after I made it.  I like to see the reaction from people that try my baked goods and I made a bunch of other cupcakes that day.  My 5 year old nephew just couldn't stop eating this cupcake.  He would say "auntie chrissie this is good" and just kept eating away.  So according to my nephew it is delicious and the best and I highly recommend it when being made for little kids.

I made this recipe with two groups of pre-schoolers, they thouroughly enjoyed it, and benefitted from measuring the ingredients in cups. though I must say you get nowhere near 24 cakes from the mixture, more like 6 or 7!

These come out tasting great, but the recipe for 24 makes 16 full cones. My question is how do I make them rise, rather than overflow?

I must have done something wrong, maybe overfilled them, because they all fell over and I ended up with a huge blob mess.  Edible but ugly.

This was so much fun to make.  I too used box cake mix.  I was a little worried during the cooking because it smelt a little like the cones were burning but they turned out great!  The kids had so much fun eating these and so did the teachers.  I was able to fill 24 regular size cones.  This would be so fun to make with the kids as they could do the decorating.  Feel free to see my photo

Fun recipe! They turned out great for us and we got 24 exactly. Get the regular sized cones, not the large sized, to get the right number of cupcakes (unless you want a few really big ones!).

I am a cheater too and used box mix. Worked perfectly.  I love cupcakes and thought this was a fun twist. Next time I will make it for my little cousin to see her reaction :)

These were really plain and I didn't like them too much. It could have been made more interesting with different extracts or add-ins, perhaps. If I make this again, for a birthday party or something, I will be experimenting with the recipe considerably.

These are great - I am glad that I stumbled across this recipe.  I plan on making them at my Son's 6th birthday and letting the kids decorate and pipe frosting on them. I made a half recipe to try it out and I recommend using the recipe as is. Also, the cones are chewy the next day so I plan on making them the day of the party and hoping they still have some crisp to them. Thanks for the recipe!

I needed something for the kids and found this recipe.  I wanted it to be sweeter so I made the cake strawberry flavored and added a touch of sour cream to puff it a bit.  It worked famously, and they were a big hit!

Great idea, my summer birthdays love these. I did this last batch both ways - filling the cone and with the upside down cone that Betty Crocker uses. FILLING THE CONE IS MUCH EASIER. Both will require lots of icing, but the filled cones are actually round at the top, where the upside down cones are square.

These are very good and cute but a word of caution - eat these on the same day!  I made mine a day or two in advance, frosted, decorated, etc.  The frosting(?) made the cones collapse at the mid point in the cone.  The cones weren't crisp anymore - they were soft like the cake and chewy.  I am not an expert but i think the moisture in the frosting was the culprit here.  In the end i had ugly little pools of frosting and bent cones. So much for my efforts.  Almost forgot, i used a box mix in my recipe.

My daughter made these for a bake-off.  She added about 1/2 cup of mini-chocolate chips and frosted them with a chocolate frosting. (We didn't put them in the cones for the bake-off, but liked the idea) They tasted like chocolate chip cookies.  Supper yummy.

This is a great recipe, however I had to make 1 1/2 batches of batter to fill the cones,  otherwise the cones come out very flat.  I made these for a bake sale and they were the first thing to sell out!!!

I used a different cake batter recipe but followed the rest of the instructions on how to fill and bake. Mine took longer to bake but probably from the more dense chocolate cake I used. I loved them and couldn't be happier with how they turned out!

Great idea! My daughter loved them for her birthday and she got to help with decorating. I took the advice of another review and did a half full cupcake pan batch and used those to fill out the cones so they were a little fuller. Make sure your cones aren't cracked or filled too high. Used 2 box recipes with some left over, used frosting to add cupcake tops to cones. Frost and decorate! Simple, fun, and delicious! Thank you!

Good! Except when they're not in ice-cream comes then the bottom tastes like cornbread; good cornbread for the record but not fluffy and moist enough.

Great results; the  children loved them.  I made them for my grandson's birthday as a treat for  his classmates.  We were able to cut out a template for transporting the cupcakes by using a large cereal box and then covering it with foil. The candles allowed plastic wrap to tent over the cupcakes without upsetting the decorations.  My son told me  I made the same type of cupcake for my son's eighth birthday in the Eighties!

Can't stress enough, don't overfill the cones or it really will be a horrible mess.  I used my own cupcake recipe in the cones, but it's not much different from the one provided.  Finished product?  Even only a few minutes out of the oven the cones, which I expected to be crispy after being in the over, were soggy and spongey.  Happy I tried this out before making these for my children's birthday.  Seemed like a great, fun idea, but if I won't eat these, I know my children won't.  Back to the drawing board. . .

I was OK the cake was a little flavorless but I think if you were to put chocolate chips or something they would be better.

It was good. I suggest adding more milk because the cupcakes were really dense.

Easy and fun recipe. I make mine with brown white and pink icing so they look like ice cream.
