I'm giving these 5 stars even though I had trouble with the baking time because they are so tender and tasty!  I made half a batch just as the recipe suggested, using a small cookie scoop with a yield of about 20 cookies.  I smushed them down with my meat tenderizer for the design to about 3/8", and the final product turned out to be about 1/4" high and 2" wide.  I say I had trouble with the cooking time, and I don't think it is with my oven, though I will test it to make sure it is calibrated correctly.  After about 35 minutes at 250, I turned the oven up to 275 to finish off the first batch.  The second batch I cooked for about 30 minutes at 275.  You really just want them to start to turn golden brown.  The end result is a very tender and light cookie---just perfect with a cup of coffee!  I'm surprised these made it with only one review after a whole year of sitting there!  I'm glad I found these!  Thanks, Proud Albertan!

These are seriously good cookies. The only adjustments I'd make would be to add a bit more almond flavoring.

These are the perfect shortbread cookies and so pretty when you squish them with a meat tenderizer. Would be fabulous half dunked in chocolate

Really Good , however the baking temp. seems wrong
so I tried 350 degrees for about 20 mins. in stead of 250 and removed from oven when edges became golden grown.


                         Thanks for sharing

Not very good. Very plain. Shortbread cookies should have more flavor. Did not all the way. Even cook after 30 minutes.

Cookies came out great.  Changed baking time to 30 min at 250 degrees then upped temperature to 275 degrees for 10 -15 min .  Also, chilled dough for 1 hour, formed in to log and then chilled.  Then sliced in to 1/4" pieces. Try rolling cooled cookies in icing sugar or adding butterscotch chips to dough both came out excellent.  These cookies are easy to make and just a few ingredients, that are on hand. Also used baking paper on cookie sheet.  Cook til a medium brown.  MAKE SURE  AFTER YOU BAKE FOR 30 MIN CHANGE TEMP TO 275 AND COOK FOR 10 TO 15 MIN MORE.  IF NECESSARY COOK EVEN LONGER.  WHEN DONE THEY SHOULD MELT IN YOUr MOUTH.  I've added all sorts of extra's like:  heath pieces, choc chip, peanut butter and once I dipped them in chocolate.  These cookies are fun to experiment with.

They were tasteless, even with the flavoring, and a strange consistency.  They baked for over thirty minutes.  I won't try them again.
