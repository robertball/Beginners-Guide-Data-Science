I enjoyed this recipe very much. I would advise those trying it out to be careful not to add too much brown sugar and tomato paste. Also, for those who favour a more spicy flavour, double the amount of curry powder.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!  Always looking for something to do with all of those chicken legs that go on sale.  The only change I make is:  I use 1 red pepper, 1 yellow pepper, 1 orange and 1 green for added color.  I have never added raisins only because I don't bake alot and so I never have them on hand.  Try this recipe...it becomes a staple in your menu!

No need to change a thing. This recipe works just as well with chicken breast filets, no worry about the bones! Easy and tasty.  Second time I made this I cheated and broiled the chicken just a touch instead of browning on the stove.I'm only cooking for 2, but made the full amount of sauce because the leftoves do indeed go with just about anything.  I love this recipe!

This was indeed different. My husband thought it was OK but said it would be alright if I didn't make it again. I found it on the sweet side.

Tried 3 times, adding more spice each time.  Just too bland for us.  Also, using meat on bone is too inconvenient in such a saucy dish.  This dish was okay, but not great... I'll probably never make it again.

This recipe was FANTASTIC!  I used just drumsticks for the chicken pieces (as that was all that I had).  I also didn't have any chicken stock, I know...who doesn't have chicken stock...so I used vegie stock instead.  And I didn't have tomato paste so I used a whole diced tomato instead and just threw it in with the vegies!  I couldn't believe how good it was!  My fiancee gobbled it up and he seriously considered eating the bones!

I made this dish for fathers day for my husband and father and they LOVED it. I followed the recipie except for the curry, I didn't have any so I used a little savory, thyme, and oregano, it came out great. This will be a regular dish at my house.

Really 4.5.  Loved the raisins in this dish!  For those of you who didn't have raisins, you've got to at least try it once with it.  Didn't change a thing.  The chicken was amazingly tender.  Served over brown rice with a sweet potato.

This was excellent!  I agree about the use of meat with bones and how it would be optimized using boneless but this worked just fine.  We also like curry so I doubled what it called for.  My husband loved it!

Boyfriend was not impressed. He said the raisins were too sweet and did not meld well with the chicken. I was hoping this would be deliciously different...will not make again!

Interesting...my husband liked it (but he likes everything), and I thought it was just a bit too weird (and I'm usually pretty adventurous). The curry flavour didn't really come out. I don't think I'll make this recipe again.

This was a delicious recipe, but we honestly found it a bit bland considering all the ingredients and prep put into the meal.   I don't think I would make this for my family again. Disappointed by the lack of flavour.

I'm sorry but but my husband said it was OK and needed a little something. I too thought it was too bland. Great base like the other person said but it needs more spice. We did like the raisins though. I thought it had more of a Morroccan flavor rather than creole. I will have to keep looking for something  more memorable.

I wanted to try something different with chicken legs and just made this dish.  Weirdly delicious!
 I think all I would do next time is increase the amounts of seasoning or add something to give it just a bit more intensity of taste.  I would definitely make this again.

Love this recipe!!!! I added to 2 tablespoons of curry, and added a teaspoon of cayenne. Didn't have chicken stock so I used chicken broth. I omitted the raisins, Still came out wonderful.

I made this yesterday and was definitely impressed. However, I had a lot of extra topping, so I made rice which went perfect with it. This is a dish that with rice can be a meal on its own.

Didn't think it was bland at all.  Ended up adding 1.5 tablespoons of curry powder.  Only made two chicken breasts, but made the full amount of sauce.  Froze and will use over rice.

Delicious!  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and doubled the curry.  I baked it 30 min loosely covered.  Will make again!

Incredible. The recipe once cooked had a lot of sauce I saved the sauce and poured it on rice for another meal and I still have a ziploc in the freezer with the already cooked sauce which I plan to use to make MORE creole chicken.

I had 6 adults and 6 kids go through 25 pieces of creole chicken- It was a hit!!!!

I made this great recipe for my wife as a surprise, she absolutely loved it as did I.  I went a little wild with the seasoning and mixed things up a little, I seasoned the chicken prior to adding the brown sugar with spanish adobo.  In a separate bowl I in also added some more adobo to the brown sugar mix, oregano, garlic and curry powder and fresh grated ginger.

This recipe was really delicious. My husband and I loved it. The only change I made was that I used Jerk seasoning instead of Curry powder (weird, I know, but I didn't have any curry!) and it was delicious! Thanks, Corwynn!

Deliciously different.  I made this exactly as written, except with bouillon cubes and water instead of just the bouillon.  We served it over spaghetti - husband and I both enjoyed it - especially the sweet contrast with the tomato sauce.  Kids gave mixed reviews -

Very good! Made exact except for the raisans which I didn't have...oh, and I burned the brown sugar even though you warned me! ..that's OK, was still good.  Served it over egg noodles.  For those who like the heat, kick it up, you know how!

I made this for Christmas,2006 and my guests loved it so much they are still asking when I am making it again! The flavours really mesh well and made for a delicious change from the ordinary chicken recipes.

My family really liked this recipe although I added quite a bit of green tabasco sauce to spice it up and extra curry!  Also did a red pepper instead of all the green and cut down all the onions.

This was a fabulous dish, reminding me of Trader Joes Birani Rice.  Easy to make on the stovetop in about 10 minutes using precooked chopped chicken!  Would also use red bell peppers for color.

I didn't have all of the ingredients, so I substituted cream of chicken for broth and stewed tomatoes for paste.  It smelled SO GOOD!  I served it with brown  rice mixed with a fruity chutney (it was a gift and the chutney jar said it went well with curried dishes).  I loved it, but it wasn't the misses' cup of tea (peppers or curry).

I followed this recipe pretty closely - and I was pleased with the result. I wouldn't change anything, and I certainly would not omit the raisins. Even my partner who does not like raisins, said they made the dish. I had thighs and drumsticks, so I used those instead of whole legs. Took off their skin and tossed them in the brown sugar. Quickly fried in the oil on all side before putting them in the baking dish. I used peanut oil (groundnut oil) because I didn't have olive oil. I think the can of tomato paste I had was just under 6oz - didn't have any other paste, so I only used that. I had a package of golden raisins, so I used those (probably not a full cup). I have a milder chili powder, so I used 2 Tablespoons of that. Didn't feel like going out to pick fresh parsley late last night - I used about a teaspoon of the dried parsley instead. I've read at least a couple reviews saying they didn't enjoy the recipe and they burned the garlic because there was too much going on. I line everything up before I begin cooking the garlic/onions - that way I can move quickly and add things right away. Also, make sure your oil isn't so hot it instantly burns the garlic. Hope that helps - the recipe is worth a try.

I made this recipe as posted.  I think it's odd that it's called "Creole Chicken" because it truly is a chicken curry dish.  It's not spicy at all, which I knew going into the recipe based on the ingredients.  I suppose one could use a very spicy curry if they wanted extra heat.  However, we loved the dish and served it over rice with peanuts sprinkled on top.  The raisins are a must!!  Curry + raisins=dynamite combo!  I usually cook with coconut milk when I make curries, so it's nice to have a "lower fat" version to make.  The brown sugar rub was interesting; I liked it.

Didn't have tomato paste so used BBQ sauce.  Served this dish with rice and the sauce was superb over the rice.

I've made this recipes numerous times and even my picky hubby likes it.  We are not in love with it, but we like it enough to have it as part of our meal rotation. What's missing in this recipe is SALT.  If you find it bland, rub salt on your chicken along with the brown sugar. When I did that the last time, it made the dish from good to great! I like to use garlic salt for another dimension in flavor. I've never made it with raisin though, but mainly because I'm not a raisin fan. Beh.  Making this again tonight - can't wait!

I think of this more as a curry chicken and I did double the curry and added ginger.  Amazing!!!!  this will go in my rotation!!!
