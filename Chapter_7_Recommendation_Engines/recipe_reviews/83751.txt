This wasn't the pilaf I was looking for, but I thought it turned out pretty tasty.  I served it with some shrimp scampi and it complimented it well.  I reccomend adding garlic and mushrooms like one other reviewer suggested.  Also, you don't need to add the salt as most broths already have quite the salt content.

I made this with homemade vegetable broth and everyone loved it. Tonight I am making it with homemade chicken broth and I know it will be great. Don't use that so-called Parmesan in a can! Use the real stuff and grate it yourself, you will be surprised at how much better it is!

Really good and easy.  I added sauteed mushrooms and red and yellow peppers at the end with the parmesan.  As another reviewer mentioned, use real parmesan cheese.  A must!

Put a couple of pinches of saffron in the chicken stock (that explains the almost neon yellow looking color in the photo).  I've made risotto tons of times using the regular method (add stock, stir, add stock, stir, repeat for 45 minutes) and was a little nervous about attempting to cheat.  I don't know how I managed it but this came out even creamier than my usual risotto. **Delicious** I'll be making risotto far more often than I used to.  Please note, it took much longer than 12 minutes... more like 35.  But as long as I didn't have to stand there and stir, and it came out better than my traditional risotto it's a keeper.

This recipe was super easy and really tasty.  Was very similar to risotto, without all that stirring.

Very good!  I halved the recipe for my family of 3 and it made the perfect amount for 4 people.  This was so much easier than risotto.  Definitely add fresh parmesan.  It is great as written but I like the idea of adding mushrooms and/or garlic next time, both are favorites in my family.

Yummy!  I messed this recipe up severely the first time I made it and almost gave a bad review but realized it was user error!  I added 1T instead of 1t pepper and couldn't eat it (it seemed like a lot, but I thought I was following the recipe! :))
So if you add the right amt. of black pepper, it's great!  I also have made it with minute rice (cooked in beef broth instead of water) with carrots and peas added, and it is delish - not as creamy but a quick and easy alternative (and good if you don't have arborio rice :))
Overall definitely a 5-star recipe, and something I'll make again and again!

Good but not great.  Came out mushy.  Not a substitute for making risotto the slow way.

I have to say.. much easier than regular risotto- did take a little longer to cook than stated in the recipe- but the taste was awesome!! Real parmesan makes all the difference. I'll definately make this again.

I served this to a group of friends who all liked it.  By itself it didn't have a strong flavor, but paired well with veggies.  Will make again.

Oh, yum!  This was fantastic!  I cooked a bit longer, but left it a bit "toothy" because our family isn't big on al dente.  I disagree with other reviewers about the parmesan.  I love fresh, but didn't have any so used the old parm-in-a-can and it was soooo rich and creamy and perfect!  So much better than stirring a perfect risoto.  Definitely try this one!  All I added was some garlic.  mmmmmmmmmm.  Great compliment to slow-cooker chicken.

Added 1/2 tsp pepper and it was still very peppery.     Used veggie un-chicken broth instead of chicken broth.  Also added less parmesan cheese than called for, about 1/3 cup.

Creamy and delicious.  I only added 1/4 cup of the cheese and we added pepper to taste on our plates.  I also added fresh baby shitake mushrooms and two cloves of garlic.

Yum yum yum.  Turned out great.  Took a bit longer than 12 minutes for me, but not much.  Added some garlic in with the onion, and a bit of thyme to balance the thyme in the chicken I served it with.  Awesome.

family really liked this.  I ran out of arborio rice, so had to use 1/4 c of my basmati/brown mix (2 parts basmati, 1 part brown) to round out the recipe.  but it was really good.  even very picky hubby ate it.

I thought this was real good, my family was indifferent. This really wasn't hard at all. I did think it was a little too peppery. If I made this again, I'd cut back on the pepper, add garlic and take another reviewer's advice and add a little lemon. Perhaps some garlic as well. I also used fresh grated parmesan.

This recipe was pretty good but I would make a few changes next time.  I would cook it for 15 minutes and it needs something to brighten it up a little.  I felt it was a little bit bland.  Maybe add a little lemon to it would be good.

This rice has a great flavor.  I had to add about a cup of water to the broth to get it cooked through, but it was very good.  My husband had a second helping.  I think next time I will mix in some stir-fry vegetables.

This was okay - I felt it was missing something. It took me well over 20 minutes to cook this and even then it was still a bit tough and nutty. It defintely needed more chicken broth - went through almost 3 cans.

I loved this recipe!  I had arborio rice in the cupboard but was always afraid to make risotto with it.  I just knew I would mess it up.  But I found this recipe and it was so easy to put together & tasted delicious!  I easily  halved the recipe because there are just two of us.  The only thing I did differently was adding a couple cloves of fresh minced garlic and two diced jalapeños along with the chopped onion when I sautéed in the olive oil & butter.  The jalapeño added a fantastic bite to the finished dish, and contrasted nicely with the creamy arborio rice.  I especially loved that I could let the rice sit for quite a while before adding the broth for the final cooking step.  It all came together very nicely after simmering for about 15 minutes. I did use fresh grated parmesan.  We reheated the leftovers tonight and it was just as delicious.  : )

So good!!! I made this recipe tonight for dinner alongside grilled salmon and sweet corn on the cob. I added the Bella mushrooms and fresh parmesan cheese as suggested. It was a hit! My hubby and two sons loved it!!

Loved this recipe. Had arborio on hand, and needed a quick side. My only substitution was that I found myself out of onions, which almost never happens,  but I  did have a clove of elephant garlic. It turned out great.

I've made this recipe numerous times. It was fine as written but I personally think it is improved by adding tomato and basil when the chicken broth goes in.

The taste was good and my granddaughter ate it. Having said that, it was very sticky and if I decide to make again, will add more broth at the end.

Sautéed the onions (also added in minced garlic) in some smoked chorizo fat and butter, then added the smoked chorizo in at the end with the pepper and parm, pretty tasty!

It's fine but definitely not as good as authentic risotto. Given the time savings and how little effort this takes though, it's good enough.   I think in the future, unless I'm pressed for time, I will stick to the creamier and more labour intensive version instead.

Modified... One red onion. One stalk celery. Two cloves garlic. All finely minced. Saute onion and celery in oil and butter. Add garlic with rice. While simmering rice, chiffonade 10-15 leaves of basil. Roast one red pepper, peel skins, and mince. When rice is finished, toss with basil, minced red pepper, and cheese. Serve with whatever! :)

I liked this recipe and will make it again, but with less pepper.  My husband adores pepper so I added a little extra for him, but the pepper really pops in this recipe and was WAY too much for me (although my husband thought it was great).  I used fresh parmesan and garlic as reviewers suggested and also some hot sauce because we like our food spicy, and other than the pepper, it was fantastic.  I served it with sauteed red bell peppers.  Yum :)

I ended up throwing out my parm, the first time I made this.  I decided to use the Gouda I had on hand. It ROCKED! Today, I made it again with parm, and decided the Gouda definitely gave the rice more  flavor, and will be using that from now on. I love the smoky flavor it gave.

Great recipe. I added sauted portabellas at the end and it turned out fabulous. As a side note this is a dish that needs to be served immediately, as the longer it sits the thicker it gets. Took it to a holiday party and everyone loved it. Served it with grilled steaks and a spicy creamed spinach.

I have never made arborio, and was happy to find it at my store.  This was a great side dish.  I let it sit for a few hours after I sauteed the onion and I think it helped get it moist and ready to cook quickly when I was ready. Everyone loved it, and was excellent as left overs.

I followed the recipe exactly - very boring dish.  I'm giving it three stars because it may work as a base.  Perhaps throw in mushrooms, peas, even grated carrots?  Overall, disappointing as is.

We enjoyed this SO much!!  Definitely most like a risotto; it turned out nice and creamy.  I sauteed some crimini mushrooms and threw them in just as the onion was done; didn't have low-sodium broth but used 2/3 chicken boullion cubes + 1 vegetable cube, leaving out any additional salt.  Also added a bit more water (maybe 1/4 cup), as I like rice a bit moist. As others have said, FRESHly grated parmesan is a must...we love parmesano-reggiano though I probably haven't spelled it properly :)  A very easy and enjoyable recipe...will definitely make again!  (Hmmm...maybe next time make it a main dish with some chicken and garlic thrown in...?)

This was very good, I used it in my stuffed zucchini, great flavor, went very well.
