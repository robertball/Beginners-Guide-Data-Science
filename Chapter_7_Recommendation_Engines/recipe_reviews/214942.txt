This is really good, although we always use the chard stems, even freeze them for soups in the winter.  Our garlic scapes (sprouts) are long matured by now, so used "mexican" onion which is like a green onion but with a big bulb, and some sliced regular garlic and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top to serve.  Will look forward to trying it next spring with frozen chard stems and the actual garlic scapes.  Thanks for the idea.

A great, simple pasta dish! I substituted 3 green onions for the 1 large onion and added 2 sprigs of kale. Delicious and light!

Yum!  I messed this recipe up and used all of the Swiss chard and not just the stalks.  It was still very very good.  My husband also liked it.

This is tasty. I didn't have chard, so I used kale and threw in some other veggies that I had on hand. Topped it with a fresh Parmesan and it was yummy. By the time the pasta was done cooking, the veggies were done and I did put some of the pasta water in to add moisture.

Very good and simple! I separated the chard leaves and sautéed them prior to the onions/scapes and used spring onions. Tossed the sautéed leaves and stems in with everything else for added flavor and texture. Made enough for four modest servings or two generous... Almost ate it all myself!
