This was great. A tasty change from traditional popcorn or caramel corn. The only change I made was to pour the popped popcorn in a brown paper bag, then pour the hot peanut butter mixture on top, close the bag and shake it to coat the popcorn. It gets the popcorn coated evenly and is less messy.

This is good, and though most would not bother to do this... it actually freezes well, when wrapped in plastic wrap. We don't eat lots of sugar, so I use about two cups of this sweetened popcorn to a three cups plain (lightly salted) popcorn. (personal preference; this is good as is, just too sweet for me.)

This turned out great - we'll be eating it often around here. Perfect treat for the kids & it was easy to put together.  We did not use microwave popcorn, so I compensated by adding 1/2 t of salt.

I wasn't as impressed with this recipe as others seemed to be.  I think the honey flavor competed with the flavor of the peanut butter rather than complemented it.

Quick, easy and delicious. I made mine with fresh air popped popcorn. 2 batches 1/2 Cup kernels each yielded the perfect amount of popped corn. Also I buttered a giant stainless steel serving bowl and used a silicone mixing spoon to toss & coat the popped corn worked great nothing stuck to the bowl.

This was delicious!  Did as a previous poster suggested and put the popcorn in a brown paper bag to shake the coating.  Tried to leave it spread out on wax paper to dry completely, but my boys wouldn't stop eating it!

I have made several versions of carmel corn and must say this was very messy and just not good. Sorry.

This was a great tasting recipe, me and my friend made it. However, there was too much popcorn and not enough sauce. Next time I will be using only two bags of popcorn. Also, the biggest bowl I had, which was quite big, was too small for all the popcorn, it was very hard to mix it, and we ended up using our hands. The peanut butter mixture was too hot and we ended up burning ourselves, next time I will try the paper bag method. None the less, this was very tasty and addictive and will be made again - SOON!

I made this for my grand-daughters & they absolutely loved it. I am sure this will become a favorite. To mix it I used an aluminum wash pan which gave plenty of room to mix it up.

This is amazing popcorn. If you love peanut butter, make sure you have people to help you eat this, or it is dangerous to have around. We use 2 bags of popcorn to have the level of sauce coverage that we like. Otherwise it's the exact recipe.

excellent just as written!  It is such a popular treat for our family to share with others or just for a family night at home.  I've made this for youth group outings and birthday parties and it is a hit every time!  I love that is is better for you and less sticky than caramel popcorn.  We put any leftovers in airtight storage bags and it keeps for days!

I used PopSecret's Homestyle microwave popcorn in this recipe. I followed the recipe exact. We all really liked this popcorn. I swear, it seemed as soon as I brought it into the living room, it was gone.

The kids like it. It's sweat  and peanut buttery. I added peanuts to it.
