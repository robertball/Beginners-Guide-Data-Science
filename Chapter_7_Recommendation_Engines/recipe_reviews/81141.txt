I found this near same recipe a few years back. As I recall the woman who submitted it won a rather substantial amount in a baking contest. The difference is she had no butter in her filling, used pecans and 1/3 cup cranberries.  This is one of our favorite Christmas cookies.

This was awesome!!  I had to give my family the recipe it was so good.  I also increased the cranberries to 1/2c and the walnuts to 4T.  It is also good with pecans.

After reading through the reviews, I decided to follow Marie C's advice. I had to bake them a little longer (33 minutes). They were good, but I think they're missing a little something. I'll be making them again, but will probably add a little grated orange rind!

I formed the pastry into a ball and placed in the refrigerator to chill.  For the filling, I finely chopped 1/3 cup of cranberries and 1/3 cup of pecans in my food processor.  Since I used unsalted butter, I added ½ teaspoon of salt.  I also added ¼ t. of pure orange extract and 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. I removed the dough from the refrigerator and cut it into halves.  I placed one half onto a floured pastry cloth and replaced the other half in the refrigerator.  I rolled the pastry and cut with a 2 ½” cutter, laid the cut rounds of dough on top of each lightly sprayed, mini muffin cup and used a tart tamper to form the shells. I filled each shell about 3/4 full. Recipes makes  a tasty and festive addition to a holiday cookie tray!

I find the usual tassies a little bland so I also increased the cranberries to 1/2c and pecans to 4T (and was eating the filling with a spoon it was so good), and I would've been happier with even more of both. This is a good cookie and a nice change from the usual tassie.

These were very tasty, but I really didn't taste the cranberry. The next time I'd maybe cut back on the amount of nuts and add more cranberries.

I doubled the recipe to use an eight ounce package of cream cheese, this yielded 33 tarts that baked in 25 minutes. I used chocolate chips for the nuts because I needed it to be nut free. Next time I would not double the filling as I had quite a bit left. They were very tasty!
Next time spray top of pan with Pam for easier removal and clean up.

I made these with the addtional nuts  and cranberries. also addes the orange zest...very good. but I think I needed to  bake them a little longer due to having a hard time getting them out of the pan.  They were nice n brown ,did run over so had a hard time telling  if they were done. so next time  I will bake a little longer . still are very good ......

They seemed quite similar to an English recipe, the Bakewell tart. Quite good, the pastry with cheese is somewhat interesting. The filling is a bit drier than expected. My kids liked them but didn't jump out of their skin.

These are lovely on a buffet table and very tasty. I too added a little more cranberries and nuts. Next time I will try some orange zest as some suggested. Thanks for the recipe.

Took quite a bit longer to bake than noted in the original recipe; I ended up with a total oven time of about an hour.  It was delicious and not too sweet, which is maybe  not so great for others, but I loved it.  Will make again.

I used dried cranberries instead of fresh. The dough is a little sticky to work with, but I kept chilling it in between batches. My only complaint would probably be that the recipe as is only makes 12 in my muffin pan!
Update on 6/11/16: made it using the dough recipe from Brandy's Blackberry Cobbler on this site... It was just right, flaky and a little salty to set off the sweetness of the filling.
