Nope. I'll pass on this one. NEVER make a blended Margie Slush. On the rocks is the ONLY way to go and triple sec is a respectable publican's taboo. Cointreau is a religious rite among serious devotees of the fruit of the Evil Cactus. Add more tequila and less of the sweetening liquer and then 'float' a shot of Amaretto on top and - voila! - you have what is known as the Cadillac Margie. 

PS. Did you know that the Margarita was named after Rita Hayworth, movie star and dancer, whose real - and Mexican name - was Margarita Cansino?

One of the best margaritas I've had in a long time. I usually just follow the recipe, but I didn't have triple sec. For some reason I decided to use sprite and it was delicious!
