This soup was awesome.  I was looking for a good, 'regular' beef vegetable soup that used normal ingredients.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  The only changes I made were that I used a 46 oz. bottle of V8, 2 cans of beef broth, 2 16 oz. bags of frozen veggies, a package of onion soup mix and instead of  the spices noted, I put a little oil in bottom of pot put the stew meat in the pot and sprinkled them with pot herb (a dried herb mixture found in spice stores and supermarkets made for soups and stews).  When the meat browned, I added all of the other ingredients and some basil and black pepper and simmered for several hours.  Served w/rye bread and butter for dipping.  DELICIOUS!  Will make again and again! Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the best vegetable-beef soup I have ever had. I live alone and made a big pot and froze what I didn't eat in individual servings.  When I put it in the microwave, to defrost and heat,  it was just as good as when I first made it.  I substituted V-8 juice for the tomatoe juice and Thyme for the Basil. I also added a little crushed red pepper and some granulated Beef Bouillon to boost the flavor.  This is a permanent recipe in my house.

This recipe was great!  I tried it with 1 jar of regular V8 and a jar of low-sodium V8 and a package of onion soup mix and had no need to add salt.  Talk about an awsome recipe

This soup was really good.  A comfort food for a cold day.  I did make changes, however.  I added 1/3 Tsp. sage, 1/3 Cup red wine, and 3 Tbsp. Worchestershire sauce.  I used 1 quart tomato and 1 quart V-8 juice.  
Thanks for a great recipe, Lisa!

This is a wonderful soup and we made it with leftover
grilled steak. I used V-8 juice and fresh vegetables.
One last substitution was thyme leaves instead of the
oregano.  The "teen" ate 2 huge bowls and finished
off the leftovers, as a snack, the next day.

My husband ate 4 bowls at one sitting!  He loved it.  I am just learning to cook and this was so easy and almost fail proof.  I added beef broth, stewed diced tomatoes and worschester sauce to add more flavor.  Also added canned pinto beans and butter beans. Will defintely have again.

This is a fabulous soup!  I made it today and it turned out great.  I did add some extra tomato juice & vegetables, but everything else I did exactly as the recipe said.  Delicious!  I will definitely make this one again (and again....and again!)

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted an easy hearty vegetable beef soup that I could make a huge pot of to have leftovers for a few days.  The seasonings gave it a strong flavor at first but it evened out and was hardly noticeable in the leftovers.

This is an easy recipe that tastes awesome and even pleases my husband who dislikes most vegetables.  I usually add extra seasonings and sometimes I add extra meat.  I can heartily recommend this recipe.  I have made it multiple times and each time it turns out great.

I just made this soup today and my family loved it!  I've never made soup before but the recipe seemed so simple, I figured I couldn't mess it up...I just had to get over my fear that it would end up tasting like seasoned tomato juice with mushy vegetables (because of the 2-3 hour cook time)!  I guess the key is the long, slow simmer of everything together because it definitely tasted like soup - amazing soup - and the vegetables were not mushy (once I got a low boil, I turned the heat down from "4" to "2" and kept it there until it was done; about 2 1/2 hours).  I did as others suggested and used V-8 vegetable juice instead of straight tomato juice and added Lipton onion soup mix, 3 tbl. spoons of  worchestershire sauce, 1 tbl. spoon of dried thyme, 4 cloves of minced garlic, 3 cans of beef broth, two extra potatoes to thicken (because of the added broth), an extra pound of beef stew meat and an extra bag of frozen mixed vegetables.  I'm so elated that I made soup that I'll probably never buy canned soup again!  This one is definitely a keeper (with the adjustments)!  Also, I did have to add salt because I used low sodium broth and low sodium V-8, and I'm sure the frozen veggies added water and, therefore, contributed to the need for salt.

Loved this recipe. Great comfort food that's easy to make (except for browning the meat . . . I always make a mess!). My portions = 1 46oz V8 original, 1 46oz V8 Low Sodium, 2 16oz bags of frozen mixed veggies, 3lbs cubed chuck beef, 3 large potatoes, 1 packet Lipton Beefy Onion dry soup mix, 2tsp of salt, all the seasonings listed x 2 plus a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper. I went with these portions b/c I could only find the 46oz V8 bottles at my store so I improvised. I cooked for 3 hrs in stock pot on low. A great way to boost the beefiness is to do your browning in batches, and for best browning (vs boiling) you should always have room between the pieces when you put them in the hot oiled pan, don't turn until pan releases the meat (otherwise you rip the seared side off) then continue to brown, you should have a very browned pan so after you take the meat out between batches put a ladleful of the V8 mix into the pan and deglaze, then scrape the mixture into your stockpot w/ the browned meat.

I scaled this back to 6 and it was more than enough for 3 adults and one 8 year old and the soup bowls were huge.  Served it with Amish bread (this site recipe) still warm from the oven and it was a great meal; hearty, filling and delicious!

Good recipe.  I found that I liked it better the second time I made it by adding a bay leaf, and using V-8 juice instead of plain tomaoto juice.  It's a keeper, though.

This is definitely one of my favorite soups!  I chopped the beef into smaller cubes, and sauted it with onion and garlic.  Instead of 2 bottles of V8, I used one with 2 cans of beef broth, 1 can of water and some onion soup mix.  I followed the rest of the recipe except the addition of 1/4-1/2 tsp. of chili powder, a pinch of crushed red pepper and added orzo 10 minutes before serving.

Best Veg Beef Soup ever! I changed just a bit...

I used1 V8 (1 qt) and added 2 cans of beef broth and 1 red onion, diced.  I used 1 tsp of each spice listed except no parsley. Should have used 2 tsp of salt though.  I browned the meat in a little oil then added the onion, potatoes, veggies, broth and V8 and spices, and cooked for 2 hours.  The meat was so tender and the flavor was out of this world! So good!

This was pretty good! It snowed 5 in today so this was pretty good on a day like today! I used V-8 instead of tomato juice, 16oz of Swanson Beef broth. I also added garlic powder and Lawry's Seasoning salt when I was browning the meat. Oh, and added 2 handfuls of elbow macaroni...turned out great!

My son and husband loved this recipe. I did change it a little by putting beef base in it. Next time when I make this recipe I believe I will use V8 juice instead. It did'nt have enough flavor in it for my liking.

Yum.  Will make again.  Only change: I used 2 cups of original V8 juice and 2 cups of beef broth.  Added 2 cups(cooked and drained)rotini pasta.  So easy and everyone enjoyed it.

This is a wonderful v/beef soup.  I did change it up a bit though.  I used one large can of V8 and 2 cans of beef broth, instead of all tomato juice.  I added some of my frozen tomatoes from the garden.  I also added some onion, celery, and carrot that I first cooked a bit in some oil.  Also added 2 tsp of beef bullion and a bit of red pepper flakes.  Yummy!!

A very good base recipe. I did sear the meat, and used V-8. Next time, I will add additional spices and more veggies to add some complexity - some red wine, worst sauce and maybe a packet of stew seasoning mix...

I thought this was a very good easy vegetable beef soup, some are so difficult to make, this was easy, I also made a few changes, cause I thought it was too acidy from the tomato juice, I added 16 oz of beef broth, and worchstire sauce, taking the idea from the suggestions, also garlic and 2 bags of veggies, it turned out delicious. oh yea and 2 tsps of sugar to cut the acid also

I have officially found my "keeper" of vegetable soup recipes.  I did change it up a little bit, though.  I used V8 juice, added a packet of onion soup mix, doubled the vegetables, added 6 cloves of garlic (of course!), and added a dash of worcestershire sauce, added a dash of hot sauce, and omitted the salt. MUCH better than the canned stuff.  I will try making it in the crock pot to get the beef even more tender next time.

I made this recipe using pork b/c it's what I had. I used tomato-vegetable blend instead of just tomato juice. I added one can of stewed tomatoes cuttup and I cooked it in the slow cooker for 1 hour on high and then 4 hours on low. Next time I'll cook it for 6 hours total; the potatoes weren't quite cooked. Besides that problem this soup received a good grade from the family. I'll make it again next fall.

I actually used the basics of this soup and put it all in a slow cooker without browning the stew meat first, and it was great. I also used the hot and spicy V8 juice and I think it really gave it a good kick.

Warm, comforting old-fashioned vegie soup.  I substituted 1 can crushed tomatoes for the tomato juice and also used some Bloody Mary juice I had.  I also added 2 cans of beef broth for my hubby - he likes a lot broth in his soup.  I used fresh carrots, celery and onion instead of the frozen and it was still done in about an hour.  Loved using the fresh stew meat - will make this often!

Just made this recipe tonight and it was delicious! very easy to follow and perfect for beginning cooks. I did tweak a few things; added one chopped onion and two cloves of garlic to the meat, used low sodium v8 juice, added two beef bouillon cubes,  added thyme to the spices, and sprinkled a little more of them than the recipe called for, used fresh veggies instead of frozen, and cooked it in a slow cooker for 5 hours on high/med. Definitely my new go to for vegetable beef soup!

I have been looking for a good, basic, simple homestyle Vegetable Beef Soup and this recipe is just that. I made only a few adjustments to suit my own taste, but all in all stayed pretty true to the recipe. I used V8 in place of half of the Tomato juice and Beef Stock in place of the other half. I also added Thyme in place of the Basil. Used a cut up Chuck Roast in place of the Stew Meat and added a chopped onion when browning the meat. Other than that stayed true to the recipe and the soup came out great!

My family really enjoyed this soup. And with a family of 5, there were no leftovers!  I used leftover meat and potatoes from a very large pot roast. It worked out well.

Excellent soup.  The only change I made was to add water and a little beef base.

Really really good.  I scaled it down to fit into my crockpot, and added some beef bouillon to offset some of the strong tomato flavor. And I used ground beef instead of stew beef, and added some chopped garlic. Very awesome.

This was good- but not 'rock my socks' good.  I used V8 in place of the tomato juice as other reviewers suggested and added a packet of onion soup mix, but it was still missing something- thus the 3 start rating.  This was very easy to make-I did mine in the crock pot all day without browning the meat (I threw this together at 5:15 am- so there was just no way I was adding another step to the process) and the meat was soooo tender. This soup provides a nice base for experimenting- thanks for the recipe.
