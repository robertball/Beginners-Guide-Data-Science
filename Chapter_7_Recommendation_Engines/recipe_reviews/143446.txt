Yummmmy! I also like a little more veg in my potato salad - I add diced cucumber & some diced red or green bell pepper for color. And for a little heat, try a splash of Tabasco or some red pepper flakes. Make a BIG batch! You'll WANT more the next day... and the day after that...

Different and delicious! I was concerned that the barbeque flavor would be overwhelming, but it wasn't.  Just the right amount of barbeque flavor! I kept going back for seconds (and thirds)!  I omitted the onion (personal preference). You may want to add some celery for crunch, but I think it's fine without it.

This is an AWESOME potato salad! I scaled the recipe back, used green onion instead of red 'cause that's all I had and just did the mayo and bbq sauce to taste. I LOVED the sweetness that the bbq sauce added...not too much, but just enough to make it interesting and delicious. We really could not stop eating this. I think this would be great with some shredded cheddar added, but I'll expierement with that next time (not that it needs anything else, because it's wonderful as is). I used 'Sweet Baby Ray's Original' bbq sauce. This is a definate keeper and one that I will make often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was a great potato salad.  I am always up for making different version of potato salads and thought this with the bbq sauce sounded like a good one.  I made half the recipe since this recipe is a big batch.  For the paprika I used a little smoked and sweet paprika, along with adding in some italian seasonings, parsley, and chopped celery.  It was pretty good but I still think it needs an extra little something to it.  I could barely taste the bbq sauce in it.  So next time I may add a little more along with some chopped bell pepper.  I also think some bacon and maybe some shredded cheddar cheese would be good in it as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will make again for sure!

I was really surprised at how good this is!  I usually prefer potato salad without onions, but I tried this both ways, and the onions really bring out the flavor.  I used a milder, sweet onion, finely chopped.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will be making this again and again!

I took this to a barbeque this weekend and it was a hit with everyone.  I must say it was better the next day!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated with the exception I added chopped celery and real bacon bits.  A keeper.....

One of my favorite potato salads, and so easy to make!  Everyone enjoys a little twist on a traditional recipe.

hands down the best potato salad ever. I hate potato salad but I love this one. I had to use a brown onion cause it's all I had but it came out just fine. Brown onion a little more spicy then red so I just cut down on pepper. My family loves this and Im hoping it will go over well at the pot lck tomorrow :0)

I used less potatoes, so used about 1/2 of the mayo and bbq sauce (used brown sugar bbq sauce).  Next time I might try adding a little celery for crunch and maybe a little dry mustard powder, but I really did enjoy this recipe.  A nice change!  Thanks for sharing!

I miss the mustard flavor in traditional potato salad BUT that being said the barbeque sauce adds a nice sweetness (I used honey bbq as that's what I had).  Still seems to be missing something for a kick but over all a yummy recipe.

I really like this recipe.  It is wonderful especially with my love of potatoes and barbecue sauce.  I did a couple things different.  Because I do not eat mayonnaise I used a got milk yogurt instead and I also added fresh corn - right off the cob (so good) and a little more barbecue sauce.

This was a hit with the family.  I actually have never made potato salad before, so I didn't really know what I was doing.  I cubed the potatoes too big and I did not dice the onions or eggs as I should have.  However the taste was excellent and my five children loved it.  I will definitely make this again, making sure to chop/cut appropriately.

Always requested and always enjoyed. You can add or subtract ingredients you would use in a "normal" potato saled but the key is the barbeque sauce. The color is funky and is at it's best in the first 2 days but it is fabulous!!! A great change from the normal potato salad we still enjoy!

I made this for a BBQ and everyone loved it! I left out the onions and only used half the eggs the recipe called for. The barbeque sauce gives it a unique flavor.

First, BBQ sauce is everything. I use Sweet Baby Ray's. I always add bacon, radish, onion, black olives, and celery. Sometimes I change the meat up to turkey bacon, pepperoni, smoked sausage, etc. Whatever I have around. I also just taste as I go. I like more BBQ sauce than is listed. The recipe as is is pretty bland and basic.

I enjoyed making this potato salad! It changed things up a bit. I also added some celery for a bit more crunch. I highly recommend this for the summer. It was a hit with my boyfriend!! MAN POTATO SALAD!

Not great as written.  Needs salt, needs heavier seasoning.  Needs bacon and more egg.  Sounds weird, but I can even see this with pulled pork mixed in!  I would definitely back off the mayo and up the BBQ sauce next time.  This has definitely piqued my interest- I'll be trying it again with a major overhaul because I think this one has the potential to be wonderful with big changes.

I make this all of the time with a few adjustments. I use onion powder instead of onions, seasoned salt instead of plain salt, and add sweet relish. So delish.

I made this for the first time yesterday for a 4th of July bbq, and it was a big hit!  So yummy and so easy.  I added some bacon bits, as suggested by another reviewer, and I think it was a great recommendation.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

This makes a nice and different side dish.  I microwave my potatoes whole until done.  Then I sliced them, layed the slices on my cutting board and put them in the fridge.  Once cool, I cubed them and put them in the sauce.  I omitted the onion and egg for dietary reasons.  Plus barbecue sauce on eggs?  Not sure about that.  Must be okay others have given this recipe high marks.  Also, I used light mayo and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  I will be making this again.

Just OK.  The BBQ sauce gives it an ugly color.  I have tasted better Potato Salad.  It needs something more.  I won't be making this recipe again.  I did just as the recipe states.  I received no compliments and no recipe requests.  Sorry.
