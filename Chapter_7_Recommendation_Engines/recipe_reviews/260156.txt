Even better than I expected. The oil and spice ratio is just right - the vegetables are flavored sufficiently, but it they aren't swimming in oil. I suggest mixing the spices into the oil first, then pouring over the vegetables and mixing to coat. That way you don't have to grease the pan either. I dislike warm feta, so I skipped that step and just sprinkled it on top after serving.

I used different vegetables - broccoli, potato, cauliflower, yellow bell pepper, fennel, carrot zucchini, and green onions, basically what I had in my fridge. Easy, healthy, and delicious. What else can you ask for?
