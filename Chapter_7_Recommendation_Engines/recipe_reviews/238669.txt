Loved the crunchy topping of crushed cheese crackers and corn flakes. More flavorful and crispier than other suggested toppings for this very typical hash brown casserole.

Excellent. I used russet potatoes shredded instead of a bag or hash browns. Reheated very well after two days. No real loss of taste. 

The white pepper and Cayenne are a good combination. Not overpowering but good taste. I did not use the sour cream.

I have also made it without the crackers and used more corn flakes. I think this is better if you plan to reheat it.

I will make this again with the changes that I made: added garlic and fresh asparagus, exchanged out for cream of asparagus soup.

Loved it!  I added a little pinch of salt, extra cheese and some crispy bacon crumbles and it was delish!
