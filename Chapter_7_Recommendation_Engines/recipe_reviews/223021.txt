Made as written except for two small changes. Rather than buying a tube of anchovy paste I used a dash of fish sauce instead. The other change is that I chose not to blister my tomatoes on the grill but kept them raw out of personal preference. This turned out really good. I didn't expect to like the peaches in this but they worked nicely. I do however recommend to use firm ones and not ones that are overly ripe. The one thing I would have preferred was less noodles ,  more dressing, and more hot sauce (use Sriracha), but that is an easy fix for next time.  I might even add some bean sprouts to the mix and add chopped peanuts as a garnish. This right here is what I consider a PERFECT summer time meal! Thanks for sharing!

Good!  Like others, I substituted fish sauce for anchovy paste.  I didn't have peaches, so doubled the cabbage (red) and I didn't have basil.  It still came out great!  I would love to try again exactly as listed but this is a nice versatile recipe.

So good, so simple, so quick! Love it! I can never make a recipe just As Is, I always have to customize in some way- I made my own marinade for the shrimp, added mushrooms and more veggies, and of course sriracha! Delish!

Good, but I would make changes.  I would only use 8 oz of the thin noodles, not the stick.  Also, increase bok choy amount for more green and crunchy.
