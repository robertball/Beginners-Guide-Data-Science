A must for morning commuters trying to save money on coffee beverages!  Recently tried using leftover Christmas peppermint candy canes as a stir stick - SUPERB!

If you put in all the recommended cinnamon, it is way too much.  I suggest cutting it at least in half.  Globs of cinnamon were floating on top and also settled on the bottom.  This would also look better if put in a food processor or blender to make the consistency finer.  I thought the amounts of coffee, chocolate and milk powder were just right and the recommended serving amount tasted perfect.

this was very easy to make. i made this exactly as the recipe said. i added 2T. of cinnamon before i remembered my sister doesn't like it (i divided the mixture up and gave to my sisters & mother in law). this is a good recipe but next time i make it i'm leaving the cinnamon out. i love the spice but not in this. this is a good recipe & we will probably always have this on hand now. thx for the recipe! : )

Great recipe and so nice to have it on hand for when company stops by.  I too opt to leave the cinnamon out of the mix, but rather add a bit of whip cream on top of each mug and finish with a  sprinkle of cinnamon .

I made this exactly as directed.  I love cafe mocha but this did not compare.  I really didn't care for the finished product too much.   It was easy to prepare though.
