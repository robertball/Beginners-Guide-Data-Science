Easy! Love it when all ingredients are from the pantry. We don't use Splenda. I used a rounded tablespoon of regular sugar sprinkled on top of 4 salmon filets. The whole family said it's a keeper. I'll be sharing the recipe with friends.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. I wish I would have had extra marinade to brush over the fish since I always throw out the marinade that is used with the raw meat. Otherwise, my husband and I found this to be a great recipe. It has a different and flavorful taste--I would also probably experiment with adding lemon or butter in the future. Thanks!

Threw this together for a barbecue and it was an absolute hit! The ingredients were all on hand, and easy to put together. I skipped the Splenda/sugar altogether, and ended up grilling these in foil packets. The ingredients really complimented each other and highlighted the salmon. Will definitely be making this again!

Great recipe.  I did not have splenda so I skipped that. I put the salmon on the grill meat side down I cooked it for about seven minutes, filipped then sprinkled it with 2 packs of sweet and low. Everyone in my family loved this salmon.  This one is a keeper for me.  Thanks for sharing SpecterXP.

I love a good salmon, any day. Having said that. We didn't like the sweet aspect to the grilled fish. Not in the least. Nor the overly vinegar taste either. I followed to a T as instructed and barely basted. But it still had that sweet taste that really was off putting for both my husband and I...he said had it not had the splenda on it nor so much vinegar, he might have enjoyed it better. Sorry, it won't be made again.

This was a hit with the entire family and some of them are the pickiest eaters you will ever meet.  My daugher who doesn't even like fish unless it is fried and doesn't taste like fish said " This is actually kind of good"  I didn't change not one thing with the recipe which is almost unheard of.  I am also changing my eating habits to eat healthier and there is no reason I could eat this and not feel guilty but the whole family liked it too and didn't feel like I was feeding them "diet food"

This is pretty sweet but very good.  I love the fact that it is a healthy way to enjoy salmon.  We will likely make again.  I did marinade for around 3 hours and then made a 2nd batch of the sauce for basting rather than use the leftovers from the raw fish.  Delicious Salmon from this site still tops the charts for us for salmon recipes.

Very good! We usually do an Asian glaze on salmon, so i was a little nervous about this, but it was quite tasty! :) Followed except for the 30 minutes of marinading (didn't do it) and used a squeeze tube of fresh basil that I had instead of dried.
