I made this exactly as written, but I used creamy PB and made homemade fudge sauce.  The taste was fantastic, but the texture was not.  The peanut butter layer froze *solid*, and could only be sliced by removing the entire dessert from the pan, laying it on the countertop, and sawing it with a heated bread knife.   The ice cream sandwiches melted into a sticky mess, but the top stayed solid, so it was not visually appealing once I did get to serve it.  I don't know if it was a mistake I made in preparation, perhaps, or maybe that I used creamy peanut butter instead?  The guests LOVED the taste, but it wasn't worth the effort that went into sawing it apart.

Only change I made was, used caramel topping instead of chocolate. It was yummy!
