I added 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the butter, and the cookies turned out just the same.....but a little healthier!!

So yummy! We both ate them all up in 2 days.  Only thing different that we did was omit the peanuts and put a tablespoon of peanut butter instead. :) I am going to make these again TONIGHT!

These have always been my favorite cookies, though I know them as 'No Bake Cookies' and usually omit the coconut and peanuts and use a tsp of vanilla extract. A tip for people who find the cookies too crumbly, or too gooey, it's very important that you only let the wet ingredients boil for one minute (minute starts when it comes to a boil) and wait a bit before adding the dry ingredients. Move the wet ingredients off the burner and let it simmer down until it's no longer bubbling, add the ingredients then and you should get well set cookies. If you wait too long they will turn to powder before you can get them into drop cookies!

I've made these for years, we simply call them "no-bakes" and I dont add any nuts or coconut.(peanut butter after the boil instead)  Just a note for the boiling process, stir all the while its on the burner, when it come to a hard boil(one you can't stir down) keep stirring and boiling for one minute,( i count it out one-thousand one, one-thousand two, etc.) then get it off the burner right away, then stir in the remaining. avoid scraping the sides of the pan too, as it gets sugar-y consistancy. this should help those who had the 'too runny' or 'too hard' problems.  Also stir together the sugar and cocoa before adding the wet ingredients, this allows the cocoa to mix better.

I found with this recipe that I had way to much dry ingredients. When all mixed together, I had a nice powder-type cookie dough....I boiled the stovetop ingredients(maybe too long) and perhaps lost too much of the wet ingredients. I doubled the wet ingredients and it worked much better.
Pretty crumbly for little kids.

This was a very easy cookie to make.  I wanted to have chocolate chips in the cookie with a plain oatmeal haystack, so I omitted the cocoa powder, nuts and coconut.  Once I mixed in the dry ingredients, I added semi-chocolate chips.    But as you might have imagined, the sugar/milk was so warm, the chips melted immediately. HAHAH.. but the cookies were great nonetheless.  I also tried adding a few drops of coconut flavoring in the 'dough' for a few cookies, for those of us who like coconut flavor but hate the texture!  Overall great and easy to make cookie that you can experiment with.

These were very good.  I did leave out the peanuts, though, because I have never eaten haystacks with peanuts, and didn't know how they would turn out.

I followed the recipe exactly as it is posted, as advised by Izzy&jujusmom, and they came out perfect.  The peanut/coconut combo sure tastes great!  Equally as good was that they took just minutes to mix, boil, mix and spoon - soooo simple.  And within minutes, they were already setting up.  

An hour ago I was scrambling to decide last minute what dessert I was going to take to our 4th of July neighborhood party and now the Haystacks are done and I can relax.  

A keeper recipe for sure!

I substituted 1/2 cup peanut butter for the peanuts and melted the peanut butter with the wet ingredients. It turned out excellent. It reminded me of the no-bakes my mom used to make.

This was sooooo incredibly easy to make!  One taste and we didn't want to take them to our potluck dinner, but rather we wanted to save them for ourselves.  Yummmmm.

Great recipe and sooo easy! The only changes I made were omitting the coconut and I added about a tablespoon or so of peanut butter like a previous review recommended. Make sure if you leave the coconut out you add a bit more oats. These were all gone the next day, and I've already been asked to make a second batch!!

I had all these ingediants on hand !  The cocoa powder was sweetened so I cut back on the sugar.  I replaced the nuts with peanut butter.  I spread these in a 9 x 12 pan and swirled caramel topping in like you would "marble" a cake.  Not only delicious but very nutricious!!  i have made these at leat 3 times in as many weeks.

My mother made these for us when we were little kids (and I'm 59). I made them for years for my kids and siblings. Everyone always loves them and they are the most requested cookie I've ever made.  My recipe does not include nuts.

We've had haystacks since I can't even remember! It was always a great afternoon snack after playing hard outside! Great recipe!

So easy and so tasty. I always add a little kosher salt from my salt grinder after I set them to cool.

I add 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Instead of nuts.
The recipe is just as easy. 
Keep in mind this recipe is for cocoa, coconut and sugar lovers.
It doesn't taste like milk chocolate. 
It's my favorite holiday daintis food gift.

These cookies are awesome!!! So easy to make. I love this recipe for baking weed cookies cause it calls for such a large amount of butter.  You can pretty much add what ever you like to them. I add extra coca power, pecans, extra coconut, vanilla extract, pine nuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, millet seeds, chia and maca powder. Anything goes. They keep great in freezer. Special treats at hand all the time!!!

I use this recipe. But just a question why do you need the butter to be soft if you are melting it? Applesauce is not going to make the recipe any healthier...lmao,  unless you add no sugar!

These are one of my favourites - followed the recipe exactly, boiling for the 5 minutes and added the dry ingredients and everything became one solid mass - even tried rolling them in my hands - what a crumbly mess.  Definitely will  make again and only boil one minute.

Great!  Followed the recipe but left out 1/2 cup of oats just in case it was too thick. Rolling boil for one minute ... Ended up adding the left out oats ... Was worried they wouldn't set well because then it seemed too thick, but 1/2 hour in the fridge and they turned out perfect! I like the nuts added rather than peanut butter which is common. Great recipe!

I put 2 of them in saran wrap, secured them with red ribbon and a tag thanking them for coming. I am going to be giving them out along with a Christmas card as they leave my “Champagne and Homemade Desserts Soiree  " we are hosting this Sunday. All of the recipes came from Allrecipes. I 
will definately be reporting back on Monday on my guests reactions.  This is one of those recipes that with supervision is a wonderful opportunity to bake with your children. It is a guaranteed winner! I grew up calling these "Chocolate Hermits". Has anyone else heard them called that?

Made it without the nuts and I had a bunch of dry mix left that I couldn't get to stick.  Will have to eat remaining with spoon. Otherwise very tasty.

I've made these twice. The first I followed the recipe exact, but the second I cooked the cocoa mixture for too long and they turned out crumbly. Definitely only boil for 1 min. But a very good recipe.

these were very good my boyfriend and our friends really enjoy these. one suggestion maybe a bit less butter, and instead of 1/3 cup of cocoa powder i added 1/4 cup it makes them a bit darker and i like the chocolate taste i will be making these again and again. Very good

Made these and noone in my family liked them. They didn't have a chocolate flavor at all.
