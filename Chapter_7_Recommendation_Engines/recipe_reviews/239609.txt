This salad is delicious!  First time around I made it exactly as written and everyone loved it.  Leftovers the second day were still good!.  Second time I made it as a main dish and added some grilled chicken.

I omitted the Brussels sprouts, cut up green cabbage and added quinoa. My husband and I loved it!
