If you don't have a grill, this marinade is also good for baking chicken in the oven.  I put the marinade in a ziploc with frozen chicken and let it thaw and marinate overnight. The next day I put it all in a pan, wrapped the chicken with turkey bacon, topped it with cheddar cheese, and cooked it at 375 for about 30 minutes and then broiled for 1 or 2 mins to make the bacon crispy. Served w/baked potatoes & green beans.  Good stuff.

I chose this tonight because I didnt have a lot of time, and it sounded good.  But before I started cooking it I read the reviews.  So I figured I had to modify it a bit so...  to cut back on the "tang" of it I added half a packet of powdery Ranch dressing & a couple splashes of EVOO.. I think that helped it a lot because it was delicious!  My kids devoured it.  I was worried they wouldn't like the dijon, but no one mentioned mustard at all!  I also used chix tenderloins instead of breasts so the 15 mins or so I let it marinade was fine.  If you use big breasts, I'd say at least an hour.  I also just used my handy dandy indoor grill. (just throw it in the dishwasher)  Served with baked beans (leftovers I had to use :)  and carrots.  Good quick chicken dish!  Thanks for the idea!

This was great, the chicken was very tender. I baked the chicken in the oven at 375 and the only thing I would suggest is to not try to get all of the mustard marinade into the pan if cooking in the oven. I put all the marinade in and it tasted mustardy. But still good!

I found this to be a fantastic base recipe.  I omitted the tarragon and instead added about 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, and 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar.  I tossed the entire mixture into the blender and it was AWESOME.  I marinated the chicken in it for about 4-6 hours and then baked some and grilled the rest.  It was fantastic both ways.  When I make it again I think I'll let the chicken marinate in it over night.  It comes out very flavorful and very tender thanks to the vinegar.  I hope those of you who like cilantro try my variations... you'll LOVE it!

I was in a pinch for a quick chicken recipe last night and decided to try this one because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I was extremely pleased with the results!  Suprisingly, the chicken had a lot of flavor with this very simple marinade.  I think this is the easiest and fastest chicken dish I've ever prepared!  I didn't alter the recipe at all! Thanks so much for sharing Pam!

I thought this was a fantastic marinade. MY boyfriend and I love it, and we're having it for our anniversary dinner tonight. Anyways, I cooked it for 30 minutes at 375F in a tinfoil pouch, and it tasted wonderful. Really easy!

I enjoyed this quick chicken meal.  The marinade was fast to make and had the ingredients on hand. Nice flavor to the chicken with little fuss. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested to bake it in the oven since I don't have a grill and would have been put off on trying this one.  Thanks

I made this recipe 1 serving, and had to use fresh lime juice instead of lemon, and i enjoyed it.

A nice and simple, low cal meal.

Wow, this is really tasty with Natalie's addition of the turkey bacon.  I prep everything in the morning right in a glass baking dish, cover with plastic and pop in the oven in the evening.  Don't leave out any of the ingredients, we tried leaving out the lemon once and it didn't taste the same.  VERY good!

This is a great recipe. However, I did make some changes. I cut the lemon juice in half, and added a tablespoon of soy sauce instead. I also added to cloves of garlic minced, and then pan-fried it instead of grilling. My boyfriend and I loved it! It was my favorite chicken recipe yet! Thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly, but broiled the chicken instead of grilling it.  Do not know what others meant who said the chicken is too sharp - if anything, we found it a little bland. Would make again.

I LOVE this marinade.  Though, to be honest, I don't really use it as a marinade.  I put the chicken and the "sauce" in a pan and let it cook that way.   It is a very sharp taste as a result.  But I really like it that way.  It's a staple recipe in our house - even the kids eat it up!

I took the advice of others and baked this wrapped in bacon. I added cheddar cheese on top and broiled for 2 min. at the end to crisp the bacon. HUGE hit with my husband and roomate

For not being able to cook at all and always ruining chicken this was so easy and came out great. I'll try marinating the seveal hours next time just for more flavor. Boyfriend said it was the best meal I've cooked for him the whole two years we've been on our own together!

Good grief! The chicken tasted like hot dogs because of the strong dijon mustard flavor. My husband loves hot dogs but not this stuff! We ended up ordering take out for supper.

A great last minute marinade, made the chicken very moist and tasty.  Marinaded the chicken while i made my side dish, about a half hour to an hour.

My husband loved this recipe..and he's very picky. I didn't have worcestershire sauce, so I used steak sauce and soy sauce.  I also didn't have dried tarragon, so used basil instead.  I actually put all the sauce on top the chicken (did not marinate), then baked it at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.  Perfect!

The chicken turned out ok. I agree with others that it could marinate for longer. Also, I didn't care for the flavor of the tarragon, just a personal preference, so next time I will omit. Will make this recipe again and just try marinating longer. I liked that the flavor was different from any other marinade that I have used.

Thi recipe was very simple. I marinated the chicken in the refridgerator for 8 hours. The result was a little bland for our taste. The kids still dipped in BBQ sauce.

I put the marinade ingredients in with the frozen chicken while it thawed.  I substituted marjoram for tarragon and added some parsley and a few dashes of cayenne pepper.  I cooked it in the oven at 375° for 30 minutes.  This had a good, unique taste and came out very moist.

This marinade is sooooo good ~ don't let the Dijon scare you.  I grilled it on my indoor grill and it turned out fabulous ~ juicy & tender!  We've made this as our main dish and for chicken sandwiches.  Definite keeper!  Thanks for sharing Pam!

My husband and I both loved this recipe!  I didn't have dried tarragon, so I substituted Italian seasoning.  I only had 3 chicken breasts, so I used a little less mustard and it was perfect.  It has great flavor without overpowering the palate.

This was delicious! I prepared as directed minus tarragon because I didn't have any. I also cooked via foil packets in the oven for 30 minutes at 375 but it could have done with 5 minutes less cook time I think.

My fiancee and I love this chicken dish. We have it about once a week. I sometimes use tenderloins instead of breasts and usually bake it at 375 for 20-30 minutes. We like to pair it with Asparagus (salt, pepper & fresh lemon juice) baked at 375 for about 7 minutes

Sorry, but didn't like this recipe.  My kids couldn't get even one bite down, and I could see my husband suffering to get it down.  My husband is picky and he said it had a weird flavor and was too tangy.  I didn't mind it, I thought it was ok, but not my favorite.  I wouldn't recommend this, but would recommend the parmesan chicken, huge hit!!

I marinated some chicken this marinade this morning for an afternoon barbecue at a friend's house.  Instead of spreading it on, I put everything in a zippie and made sure all pieces were coated.  It had a lovely, light flavor.  Simple and delicious, we'll definitely make this again.

I liked this recipe. I baked it in the oven as a previous reviewer suggested. My boyfriend wasn't as happy with it as I was, but the kids seemed to like it. Lots of flavor and very easy to make. The finished product didn't make a really appetizing presentation, but it tasted good. Thanks.

This recipe wasn't bad and I would possibly make it again in a pinch, however, it wasn't one of my favorites.  The mustard was much more prevalent than I would have liked.  I would honestly probably add a little bit of honey to the marinade to help level the taste if I made it again!

I give this 4 stars because my finicky 8 year old ate this without complaining, but I thought it was heavy on the mustard.  I added 1+ T of honey and some extra lemon juice. Next time I would use less than the 1/4 cup mustard.

I had to sub out all but 3 ingredients (chicken, Worcestershire sauce, pepper), add in a little advice from some previous reviews (Olive oil and vinegar worked like a charm, and even I managed to make this come out really, really good. I was really worried that it would taste too mustardy (I had to use just regular mustard), that it would overpower the chicken, but it just faded into the background. Following the advice of using a little vinegar, and olive oil, the chicken came out juicy, not even a hint of dryness. I marinated it for only about a half hour in the fridge (again, worried about the mustard), and followed the other advice about not getting too much of the marinade into the baking pan (yes, I had to bake it, also sage advice), and it came off the tin foil with no problems. I'm really happy I found this recipe, my girlfriend and I will be using this again and again.

This was a quick easy & tasty recipe. Served with wild rice pilaf (rice a-roni), steamed broccoli, & canned green beans topped with some butter.

Very easy and tasty - I substituted ranch dressing for half of the mustard, baked with crumbled bacon on top.  I can see this in a slow cooker as well - the sauce would be good on rice or noodles.

This was a good recipe.  I tried it first exactly as given and it was good but not overly so.  I then made it a second time but when I marinated the chicken, I put it into a baggie and sealed and let it set for 15 minutes in the fridge then an additional 10 on the counter before putting it on the grill.  The flavor is absorbed more fully in the baggie.  It also allows you to rub the chicken together to make sure the marinate has complete coverage.
My family liked it better this way.  I will continue to make this recipe.  Thanks for the new idea.

I think it needs to be marinated for a bit longer than 15 minutes and maybe just a tough more of the mustard.  But i like flavor exploding from the food.  The way it is might be just right for those that arent into a lot of zest.

Very good start! I added a little lemon zest, 2 cloves of garlic and a tablespoon of honey and substituted the spice with italian seasoning. The marinade was fantastic! I unfortunately used chicken thighs and with all the lemon juice tenderizing it, the texture ended up feeling like the chicken wasn't cooked at all. So use regular white meat chicken and I will definitely make this again!

I made this for my sisters and their families one night and everyone liked it. I though it was a little dry but I think that's because my grandma said it would be fine if I just left it in the oven for a little longer until everything else was done. I will definitely rerate it when i make it again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed the instructions exactly except used fresh tarragon instead of dried.  I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours in the fridge.  With all of the flavorful ingredients, I was expecting a lot of flavor in the chicken, but there wasn't.  It was pretty bland for my taste, so I won't be making this again.  Oh well, at least I used up some of my tarragon!

This was good. I put the chicken in the marinade and then froze it. I took it out the night before I was going to cook it. So it marinated for a lot longer. It had a good taste. I added frozen broccoli flowers to it in the last 10 minutes to add some color and some vegetable. I will make this again!

This was very good!  I let it marinade for about an hour, but will definately try to marinate it over night next time.  It is a very light marinade when cooked and surprisingly the heat from the dijon does not pass on to the chicken.  My young kids LOVED this.  I made and extra batch of the marinade to for my husband and I to use to dip the cooked chicken in.  It was also very good today served cold on a salad.

I really, really like this marinade recipe. I used it to bake boneless chicken breasts in the oven. I added a bit of water to the bottom of the dish so it wouldn't dry out. It made the chicken very tasty and with no oil used, it's still very low in fat.

Pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly except for two things.
I used grapefruit juice instead of lemon juice, because that's what was available and I only put one teaspoon in.
Then, I sprinkled some chili powder over the top before baking it.
Turned out great.

I thought this chicken was pretty good. I did make some modifications to the recipe. I used only about 1/4 a cup of mustard, and since I only had stone ground mustard, I used that instead of dijon. I used fresh taragon because I have some growing in my garden. I also added a few tablespoons of olive oil, a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of fresh ground black pepper. I let that marinate in a zip lock bag overnight in the fridge. Then I sauteed the chix in butter (everything tastes good with butter.) After re-reading the recipe, I realized I forgot to add the worcestichire sauce. It did taste like it was missing something and that was probably it. Overall good chicken though, tender with tasty flavor.

Roomie and I enjoyed it, but I think I was more fascinated by how easy it was, as opposed to the overall flavor. I used a stove top grill pan, but will try a real grill next time.
