Once could certainly argue that this needs "seasoning," but I would argue this is perfect just as is - I like the fresh, clean, unenhanced flavor of good, fresh vegetables.

A classic, simple and tasty side dish.  Thoroughly enjoyed the fresh taste of the corn and zucchini.  Very nice Sara B.

Coming from a Hispanic background, in our culture we call this "calabacitas and corn" it's the same recipe only we add some mild or hot green chili to the bunch. Adds a nice spice and flavor to the whole dish.

This was very easy and quick and it's extremely versatile. I cut down to only 2 T butter; I liked the brown butter taste. I added some minced garlic and some leftover rotisserie chicken to make it a nice one skillet meal. I sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top, and we all gobbled it down. I will also use the recipe again when I just need a side dish- corn and zucchini go well together. Thanks Sara B!

This simple dish was simply delicious!  For two of us I used two ears of corn and two small zucchini and the rest the same.  I think it is key to chop the zucchini not much bigger than the corn kernels so it does not over power the sweet corn.  My new favorite way to eat zucchini!

This is the best recipe, it is super easy. Since I started making this recipe in winter I used frozen corn, about 2 cups.

This recipe is awesome! I make it all the time! Sometimes I use olive oil instead of butter and add red bell pepper for flavor/color. One of my favorite veggie dishes!!!

Easy and tasty. I added shredded fresh basil at the end for even more summery flavor. I also used only half the butter  called for in the recipe--still plenty buttery. Delicious side dish (served it w quesadillas but I could see it as a side for any number of main dishes).

This is a quick, yummy summer side dish that gets rave reviews each time I make it.  I do use 1/2 butter, 1/2 olive oil, and have also added cilantro for a little extra flavor.

This is the perfect side to a summer BBQ. The salt and butter were the only accompaniment needed. I used prepackaged corn on the cob to save time. It was delish!!

This was very good. I started with the onions, then the zucchini and a bit later added the corn so it would stay crispy. We had company over and we all really liked it as a side dish. Also very pretty. I used some fresh basil as suggested by another reviewer.

This was so good.  I used a pattypan squash instead of zucchini, since I had a nice one from the farmer's market.  I used one leftover ear of corn that had been grilled.  Using suggestions from others, I added one minced clove of garlic to the onion, and topped the whole thing with grated Parmesan and basil from the garden. We served it with yellow rice.

It was pretty good.  I found it a bit bland, so I added a can of Old El Paso chopped green chilies and a bit more seasoning.

I love this recipe! It is such a quick, easy and tasty way to get veggies on my family's plates. I use McCormick's minced onion when I'm short on time and that is just as good. Also, I  use frozen corn. This is definitely a part of our regular rotation. Thanks for posting!

I made this when I had a Zucchini overload which was months ago. So, I don't remember what I did to it. I do know that it was very good and we had it several times. Another great AR recipe!

This was great! I added a red bell pepper and used a can of corn (it's not the right season for fresh), and we really enjoyed it. Since the recipe is pretty basic, I'm going to try it with other veggies, as well—I think it'd go great with yellow squash, green and yellow bell peppers, and so on. My only tiny complaint is that it isn't very colorful, but the red bell pepper did help. Thanks for the recipe!

made it once with butter as written; added garlic and a few grape tomatoes at the end of cooking time. So easy, so delicious. Made it a second time with olive oil and same additions for vegans--also incredibly delicious and simple. Served over coconut rice? Insane.

I really liked this.  Great combo of flavors.  Can't get fresh corn?  Frozen works just as well and we can get fresh zuchinni here year-round.  It's a very nice side dish and I'm sure that adding some variety (such as peppers) would work well.

It was a nice, healthier side dish we enjoyed! I made a few changes: instead of a fresh onion, I used dried minced onion because my fiancee does not like the texture of onions. It worked using that and is handy if you don't have an onion around! Next, I used olive oil instead of butter. I would suggest using a pan covering for the veggies while it simmers because it seemed like it took longer to cook through the zucchini and the corn was browning a little as a result. Other than that, it was good!

As is, I found this very very bland. I tried a similar recipe that had cheddar cheese on the top and it was every worse. I was let down when this was finished. Only change I made was reducing the butter to 2 tablespoons upon making that similar recipe and finding it way too greasy. Then, I got an ingenious idea and stirred in 4 large tablespoons of deli style large chopped pickle relish into 1/2 the recipe. Oh yum, it tasted like a fresh chow chow recipe. I may attempt that again. ty

Great! I made as written except I reduced the butter by half. With fresh veggies this dish is perfect with just salt and pepper. On a side note, I would not try this with olive oil because it doesn't brown like butter, and the butter flavor is excellent.

As a noncook this recipe is awesome and easy without an overwhelming amount of ingradients. I ended up having to cook the onions a little longer then suggested, but everything turned out deliciously. Saved and will make again. I love how easy it is and how it doesnt break the bank for someone who doesnt quite have the home garden thing figured out yet(plants die in texas lol).

As Naples34102 so rightly stated..."Perfect As Is"!!  I totally agree!  I did add some fresh chopped basil towards the end to add a little depth of flavor.  So Delicious to be So Simple!!  Thanks, Sarah B, for a wonderful recipe!

Excellent recipe.  Like some of the other reviewers, I cut the amount of butter in half and it was still creamy and wonderful.  For seasoning, in addition to salt and pepper, I sautéed 1 small clove of garlic, finely minced, toward the end of the cooking time for the onion.  Then added 1/2 tsp of dried thyme while sautéing the zucchini and corn.  My husband loved it and we’ll definitely make this again soon.

I rarely comment on a recipe, but I had to for this one. It is EXCELLENT! I changed nothing from the original recipe except to stir in some chopped fresh basil from my garden at the end. The basil adds something magical. Yum!

Frozen corn worked well, just add the corn a couple of minutes before the zucchini.

So simple and great.  What I like best is it can be so easily modified for portion size or taste.  The only things I changed are I used canned corn, olive oil and just a touch of butter and threw in a bit of Italian seasoning.  I look forward to making this again and discovering ways to change it up.

What a refreshing way to use zucchini. I used steam fresh corn which I only cooked 4 minutes in the microwave and then added it after the zucchini was browned. I also added 2 fresh Roma tomatoes when adding the corn. Tossed it all together and cooked for 2 minutes more, topped it off with Parmesan cheese and served.  Nice side dish!

While it’s a simple dish it has a wow factor to it. I don’t always have corn on the cob at home but I always have frozen corn. I’ll just use two cups of frozen corn and it still tastes great.

Less IS more. Perfect pairing and another corn combo to add to the family's regular rotation. I made NO changes and am rating it as such. This has taken a place with our family's other corn dish, corn and green beans. Yummy and thanks for sharing.

Very good.  Very simple.  I really think caramelizing of the onion is important.  i too got away with 1/2 the butter.  I added a little  cooked chopped bacon because I had it on hand.  Bacon makes everything better.   Very versatile.  I could see adding herbs.  Diced Chilis.   Edamame possibly.

and I blanched the corn before cutting off the cob..  Thank you Sara for a great recipe.

Nice way to use up leftover corn and zucchini.  I  added red pepper for color and added flavor.  Can add Parmesan cheese if desired.  Very fresh and clean flavors.

Made it twice already and LOVED  it!  It is even great cold.  I used a Vadalia onion just since that is what I had on hand.  This recipe combines the best of summer.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

Delish - I added some fresh jalapenos, parsley and basil along with some garlic from the garden and it was amazing...even good on quinoa/chia chips as a snack (warm or cold) ... will make again for sure.

This was too simple to be so delicious. Now I have a great way to use up all of my garden zucchini. We used this as a side dish  with a roasted chicken. And then something miraculous happened, my husband asked for seconds of a vegetable side. That alone makes this recipe a keeper. I made it as written. No changes required.

Okay, so we have been making this in butter just with yellow squash which pairs perfect with the zucchini (all of the farmers even grew them together, which were friends so family farms they'd love sharing to show off their hard work lol) however my kid is very PICKY NOW! I know this corn is key. I'm making this with yellow squash added, I am giving it 5 stars since I the moment I read "Fresh Corn" to my favorite dish I knew it was a winner. My kid loves loves loves fresh, or canned corn in the winter like myself. Never touch frozen. We just can't like it lol. Thank you for corn though! More veggies are going to make it in her!

No changes. Loved it as is. Wife liked it a little but she's a picky eater and doesn't care much for zucchini. Her loss - my gain!!

Be careful not to burn your onions. I followed the recipe as written.  I was the only one in the house that liked it, but I also love just corn sauteed in butter until the corn turns medium brown. Tastes like grilled corn to me! Never thought to add zucchini. I will make for myself again!

We will make this again, I would say it is 4 1/2 stars.  I made a couple changes.  I used frozen corn and I used margarine.  I cut the zucchini in corn sized pieces.  I added about a teaspoon of dried basil.  I added everything at once and cooked it on medium heat with a lid on.  I cooked it for about 15 minutes.

Great easy recipe I also added garlic salt and a bit of onion powder for flavour and instead of green onion I added garlic scapes and only used about 2t butter - don’t over cook just stir fry quickly and remove from heat

Turned out great, after reviewing a few of the reviews, I decided to add some Tony Chachere's creole seasoning to it when cooking it.  My dinner guests commented how great it was.  Will defiantly make it again.

We used 12 oz. can of shoe peg corn (because we were out of fresh corn on the cob) and we peeled the zucchini. This dish was awesome!  Can't wait to make it again with fresh corn!

Great all purpose side.  Next time I will not saute the onion first but include it with the zuc and corn. Hubby said the onion was too mushy.  May want to add chopped red or sweet pepper next time for color, but it is wonderful as it is. I would have added fresh basil if I'd had it.

This recipe hits the sweet spot for me. Fresh like a salad but the corn and chunky zucchini make it hearty.

I find it critical to use small zucchini as larger ones tend to end up too soft instead of crisp to fit with the corn.

Also I have had a lot of success by taking some tips from another excellent corn recipe using
up to 1 tbsp chili powder  and 2  cloves garlic minced: 

Add the garlic in with the corn and zucchini and the chili powder  about halfway through maybe 2 minutes later.

Good, but needs a pinch of red pepper flakes or some diced jalapeno.  Used a can of well drained corn and added some red bell pepper I had on hand.  Added the leftovers to some store-bought jambalaya--worked out really well.

Made this side dish for company this weekend.  Didn't change anything in recipe.  Everyone, even the two picky eaters, really loved it.   The sweetness of the corn is a perfect pairing with the zucchini, which doesn't have a lot of flavor on it's own.

Wow, I'm surprised by how simple and yet somehow great this was. The fresh corn makes a huge difference! Also this makes a lot...I cut down to 2 zucchinis and 2 ears of corn (left everything else the same) and it was still quite a lot of food. No complaints here because I'll have leftovers for lunch today! Anyway I am usually guilty of overcooking zucchini so I followed the timing exactly and it was perfectly tender-crisp. Yum!

I substituted onions for the corn, and had corn on the side. (Granddaughter loves corn but not zucchini or onions) I will make this again, and probably many different variations of it. Yummy veggies.

Delicious! I used a whole small, sweet yellow onion and it gave the corn and zucchini so much flavor! My 10 year old asked for seconds and wanted to take leftovers to school tomorrow. Too bad there wasn't any left! He asked me to triple it next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

Phenomenal; rave reviews from family and guests!  I like to keep vegetables "healthy", even for company meals.  Both the zucchini and sweet corn are exceptional at this time of the year, making this dish perfect, for summer entertaining/barbecues.  The sweetness of the corn is highlighted.  I did reduce the butter to 2T, added chopped red bell pepper for color/flavor and seasoned with Penzy's Sunny Paris, a versatile and amazing salt free seasoning, featuring sweet shallots and chives layered with herbs and pepper.

Awesome recipe.  Followed the recipe, with these minor changes, used combo. of olive oil & Can't believe its not butter (health reasons).  Used 1 cup of frozen corn "too lazy to go the fresh route",  red onion rather than white, added garlic powder, Kosher salt and red pepper flakes to taste.  I served it as a side with sandwiches.   This is will be great to serve in the Winter months.  Living in upstate NY we always have zucchini in our markets even in those cold months.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us all.

I decreased the butter just very slightly and added a very small amount of fresh garlic and dried cilantro.  Otherwise it was made as written.  We enjoyed it a lot!  I tried a bite with parmesan on it, since many had added it, but  preferred the fresh taste of the vegetables without the cheese.

This was super good, but it could do with less butter. I think I'll try to cut the 1/4 C down to half, about 2 Tbs. next time and see how that goes. Great recipe!

Delicious, fast week night veggie.  I used 2 small zucchini and 2 small summer squash. I only used 3 tbl of butter. It came together very quickly. As another reviewer mentioned chopping everything similar in size enhances the flavor.

very easy and good.  I added fresh garlic and, at the end, chopped seeded tomatoes.  I sprinkled a little Parmesan cheese at the end.  I plan to use the leftovers in a corn chowder.

It's the browned butter which makes this recipe work—simple and delicious without either bacon or cheese. If you have no small zucchinis, a larger one works just fine if you take care to cut it into relatively small dice. The visual contrast of corn and zucchini is attractive, and the nutty undertone of the browned butter intoxicating.

What a great combo of veggies - one I would not have thought of!  I did add garlic salt and a bit of oregano as previously suggested and used canned corn.
I'll do it again and use some different seasonings - it's so fun to play with this one.

I used 2 small yellow squash and 2 small zucchini with seeds removed.  I added approximately 1/3 cup dry parmesan cheese  I used 1 can of whole kernel corn to save time and mess.  Very appealing to the eye and tasted great.

I cubed the zucchini, and fired up my Evo grill, which is a large slightly arched griddle cooking surface.    The grill was a little too hot when I put the butter on it, and the butter flew right off of the grill.  I ended up not using much butter at all because of that, and used a little salt & pepper.  The combination of fresh shelled corn and fresh zucchini is fantastic!  I followed the recipe loosely with regard to portions, but used only the listed ingredients.  Use freshly shelled sweet corn for exceptional flavor.  This was a HUGE hit at a table of nine. Everyone loved it.

Loved this. Always looking for new side dishes. I added quite a bit to this however. I added one tsp of bacon fat, 1/4 tsp chicken bouillon, sprinkle of smokes paprika, salt/pepper, and I also added one tsp of minced garlic with the veggies.
I let everything cook down and slightly caramelize then added a splash of chicken broth to deglaze. It was great, I served with chicken thighs and couscous. Even the baby ate it!

Great, easy side dish. I did add cumin and a little garlic. I served this with steak and some sliced avocado.  Next time I will add some green chiles, to spice it up a bit.

Made this today for Church potluck.  Added 1/2 T. of Johnny's Garlic Seasoning to it and left out onions, and it was gone! Quick!  Next time will try adding diced tomatoes with green chilies for something different!  Loved it!

Very good! The simplicity of this meal is wonderful when the veggies are fresh and showcasing their wonderful flavors. My daughter, who always avoids zucchini, enjoyed it and said we should make it more - that's always the mark of a winning dish!

The only thing I did different was to add garlic to the recipe but I tend to add garlic to just about everything. I agree with other reviewers that this is a fresh tasting recipe and not burdened by overwhelming flavors.

Super simple and summery. Very satisfying. The only thing I did differently was to add another ear of corn. This would be good with a little chopped fresh basil, too. Yum!

This simple recipe proves that simplicity is best. I seasoned mine with garlic pepper and a bit of salt. You can season it with any of your favorite seasoning, or just salt and pepper. It's delicious and healthy, and a great way to use some zucchini! I have corn that was freshly cut off the cob in my freezer already so I got to skip that part. I don't see why you couldn't use frozen corn thawed in it's place, but I'll be honest, fresh off the cob does taste better in my opinion.

This was really good.  I browned half the butter, cut the onion, and added the rest of the butter later to melt in while it all cooked.  My family really liked it a lot.  Succotash without the tomatoes.

I found this recipe in my latest All Recipes Magazine, and knew I had to try it. I think I ate half of this dish in one sitting! I followed the recipe, as written in the magazine, except  I don't like to do a lot of salt so I just sprinkled a little bit of kosher salt at the very end of the cook time. 
I had to use store bought produce for this, so I can't wait to make this again when the locally grown sweet corn and zucchini are available.  My teenager didn't like this dish (but only because he doesn't like corn). So next time I make it-- I won't even have to share!

I first cooked two slices of bacon (chopped up) before adding the onion. At this step I used olive oil instead of butter because of the already rich flavor of the bacon grease. In addition to onion, I added half of a jalapeño. Though depending on how spicy you like things, I could have easily gone with more. The rest I used as normal, adding butter, salt, and pepper to taste.

Simple and delicious! I steamed the corn in the microwave beforehand. Then I sauteed the zucchini, and when it was about done to my preference, I added the corn. I had to fight the urge to add more flavoring and spices to this, but it's perfect the way it is and just adding sea salt and pepper. I've made this frequently, and this time I added a few squirts of lemon juice. Great recipe!

This is my new summer time go-to staple!  I saw it in featured in Allrecipes Magazine's June/July/August issue and was inspired to try something new for a family BBQ.   Just like one of the reviews suggested, I used frozen corn and it turned out great.  I  used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil.  The white onion really complements the zucchini and corn flavors but I think I might try added a little mild green chili next time.   Great for all ages and very easy to transport.

There is nothing like fresh vegetables in the summertime!  I think this was a near perfect dish.  When the vegetables are fresh you don't need added seasonings or sauce to make the flavor shine through.   I made exactly as the recipe stated except I didn't use a full half cup of butter.  I only used about 3 tbsp. and it was enough for us.

This is a fresh, clean dish on its own, or you can kick it up a notch with a few additions.  I love to add a bit of diced red bell pepper and a little garlic.  Either way, this is about the only zucchini dish my husband actually likes - and he like it a lot!

It was easy to make and it had a very nice taste. I was able to use less onion (Onion give s me heartburn) and slightly more corn (Four ears) and it came out just as good.

I've never left a review before, this was THAT good. Seems like it'd be a bit boring, but no, the flavors mix together so wonderfully! We doubled the recipe and did cut corn off the ears, but next time will probably just use frozen corn. I did add some parsley from my garden, a bit of dill and a bit of parmesan reggiano/asiago cheese mix, but not a lot.

This was really fresh and tasty. I served it as a side for taco night, adding a little cumin.

Best Zucchini recipe we have tried. I just can't seem to leave a recipe alone so I did add a couple shakes of Italian seasoning, fresh basil and a touch of garlic. Fantastic!!!

Deliciously buttery, with a touch of salt makes this one of my top side dishes. Fresh corn will always taste the best so try it over frozen if you can.

Easy, fast and delicious.  What more could you ask for?!  It's a great side as is.  I add it to rice (without the onion)and serve with my Cajun Chicken Wings; submitted, but pending approval.

I needed a quick vegetable side dish.  I had 2 ears of corn and one medium zucchini. I took another reviewers suggestion and added some crushed red pepper, and diced the zucchini fairly small.  Turned out great!  Easy, fresh, and delicious!

What a great recipe.  I let mine sit over night for better flavor.  Or you can prepare it early morning to have it ready for the evening meal.

I made the recipe as-is, but added fresh basil at the end, as another cook advised.  However, I did sprinkle in a little dried basil as the dish was cooking...........mmm.  Delicious and healthy!

I love this recipe because it's so versatile, I don't think you can make it wrong. Its good as a veggie side dish with a good protein such as chicken or pork chops, but it's even BETTER sauteed with some cumin, chili powder, cayenne, oregano, salt, and pepper with some sliced bell peppers too - and put inside fajitas! I'm not the most skilled cook in the whole world but this is so easy, definitely 5 stars.

This dish was a big success at a potluck.  I used fresh corn and zucchini chopped very small.  The only alteration was using 3 T of butter. No leftovers.

My family really liked this recipe.  It is very easy to make.  I did cut down a little on the butter, and added some garlic powder.  Next time I think I will add some parmesan cheese as others have suggested.

This is a great recipe which is easy and fund to make. My wife and I added a little touch of parmesan cheese and it taste delicious.
