Very nice.  I'd definitely suggest coating the pie plate with cooking spray, though.  My crust stuck like crazy to the pie pan, and I use a glass pie pan.  I don't have high protein wheat flour, so I just used regular ww flour.  I'm not sure if that made any difference or not, but it really didn't get crumbly.  I added wheat germ to get a bit of the texture of a graham cracker crust--about 2 tablespoons, and I added about 3 tablespoons more flour than it called for.  It also took longer to bake--about 5 minutes more, but that tends to depend on your oven.  I ended up with extra, almost enough to make another pie, so I'll find something to do with that.  Thanks for the recipe!
