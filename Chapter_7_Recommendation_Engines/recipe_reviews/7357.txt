I made this recipe for my dad's birthday. The cheesecake part was a hit but the sour cream topping ended up being scraped off by most. Next time I'll just stick to a chocolate top layer. Thank you.

If you love the combination of mint and chocolate, this cheesecake is AWESOME!  It is well worth the time and effort involved.  My only suggestion is to use a 10-inch rather than a 9-inch pan, in order to fit the whole mixture.  I made this recipe for a party, and had none left over, much to my chagrin!

Excellent recipe. I only changed one thing: I used chocolate graham crackers instead of wafer cookies for crust. I melted the chocolate along with 8 tablespoons of butter and blended it in with the crumbled graham crackers, and pressed it into a 10" springform. I followed the recipe exactly for the filling, but ended up with about 1/4 cup too much (even for a 10" pan!), which I discarded. I baked above a water bath. When it had cooled overnight, I made the glaze as the recipe called for as well as added about 1/8 cup of Bailey's Irish Cream and it gave the glaze a nice mild taste of liquor as well as slight coloring. Thank you Bonny for the wonderful recipe! I will definitely make this again.

This is the biggest cheesecake I've ever made!  The recipe makes more than even a 10 inch pan can hold- and I even left the sour cream topping off because the pan was full to the brim.  I baked it in a water bath that I had set in the oven while it preheated.  The finished cake was rich, minty, and full of dark chocolate flavor.  I did not put sugar in the crust, and used only 1.5 cups in the filling.

A very expensive cake to make,  but I tried it for Christmas. The reviews inspired me. However, it turned out very dry. Maybe if the recipe gave directions for handling the cake after the baking was over it would have turned out better. (There were no directions for this step.)         In previous cheesecakes, recipes directed you to leave in oven until cool or overnight with the door ajar.I did this twice, because it was baked twice. Thus, the result was so dry it split when cut.

Wow, I put this cake in a bath while cooking and left it to cool overnight in the oven (door closed) I just checked it this morning and it looks perfect. No cracks, it is the nicest looking cheesecake i've made. Can't wait to taste it tonight. To make it easier I used oreo cookie crumb base. I used choc. chips and mint chic. candy bar insted of bakers chocolate. On the top I sprinkled skor caramel bits. Also cut the recipie down by 25% and had just the right amount for a 10" pan. Will adjust rate after the taste test.

Thank you to whomever submitted this recipe!  My friend said she wanted a cheesecake for her birthday and her favorite flavor was mint chocolate.  This was one of the few recipes I could find and it turned out amazing!  Everyone loved it and the cake (which was gi-normous!) was gone within an hour.
Thanks!!!

wonderful cheesecake.  As expected, it was quite rich and had a great subtle mint flavor.  I used white creme de menthe in the sour cream topping for a little additional mint flavor.

This cheesecake tasted fabulous! It did make a lot more than a 9 inch spring form pan can hold and since i didn't have a 10 inch I used a 8 inch disposable pan in addition to the 9 inch spring form and made two cheesecakes.  As amazingly good as it was i don't think i would make it again.  It has a LOT of calories and uses some pretty pricey ingredients, and takes a day and a half to make.  It was nice to try once though.

I made this for a ladies Christmas luncheon and got rave reviews! I ran out of time and so I used some fudge icecream topping for the piping and it worked! Thanks for the recipe!

This came out great and was requested from my mother-in-law to definitely make again for the holidays. Instead of chocolate wafer cookies, I used Thin mint GS cookies. I didn't add the sugar to the crust since the cookies have enough sugar in them as it is. I misread the recipe and didn't have enough of the bittersweet chocolate for the topping, so I melted chocolate chips instead. I'm not sure if this is why my topping was too soft for piping into a lattice design but the chocolate glaze on top (which was basically a panache was delicious. As recommended from others I omitted the sour cream topping step. I also used 1/4 teaspoon peppermint oil since I couldn't find the extract at the supermarket I went to. All in all an expensive dessert indeed but I think it tasted as good or if not better than the ones you buy for about $40-50 at those cheesecake specialty shops. Yum !

This cake really is delicious, but like so many others here I made a few adjustments...
- I also made the crust out of thin mints...or at least the Kroger knock-off brand (also omitted the extra sugar and chocolate and it worked beautifully)
- I also put the cake in a water bath, and had to bake it a little longer than one hour. I then left it in the oven (turned off) for another hour. No cracks and perfect consistency! However, there's a lot of chocolate in this on top of it being a traditional cheesecake; it really should chill overnight.
- I didn't do the sour cream frosting or the chocolate lattice...I used the leftover cookies and then some chocolate peppermint patties for decoration (they also make perfect slicing markers)

I did not alter the cake batter itself, and it was a huge hit. I will definitely make this again!

I made it gluten free by crumbling flourless fudge cookies (from this site) for the crust. Both the cheesecake and cookies are a hit!!

Made this my first cheese cake. My family is spoiled with the sweetness of Jello brand cheese cake so they weren't as impressed with its bitter taste. I think it turned out fine. I learned to melt the choclate real slow or it will burn. I burned 2 batches before I figured it out.  I'm surprised nobody has mentioned that adding the cocoa made it turn brown. The picture is a white cheesecake. Hey what about adding green coloring to the mix? I think adding the cocoa made it more bitter too. I'm going to leave it out next time. Because most people were on the fence about the sour cream I'm leaving it out too. Since the cake is choc I used white choc to decorate it. I found some YORK mint drops (like M&M) to put on top too. I'll have to eat 1 myself and the other goes to the party. By the way I baked this is a disposable tin pan because I don't have the ring, it barely cracked at all.
