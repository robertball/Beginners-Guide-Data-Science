Don't know when I had such fun with a recipe. After reading all the reviews, I made additions and changes. Omitted cheese since had none on hand. Mixed can cream of mushroom soup,can cream of chicken soup, 1/2 can evaporated milk, sauteed onions,garlic and mushrooms, 2 chopped (leftover from Easter) hard boiled eggs, a few chopped olives and the ham. Added the noodles and covered with crushed potato chips. My husband said it was the best casserole he's ever had. Thanks Kathy for your recipe.

I had leftover ham from Easter Dinner and came across this delicious recipe today. I am a cheese freak, so I added extra sharp chedder cheese and some Dijon Mustard(2 Tbs). Since this was my first time making this particular dish, I have no idea if the added mustard was a plus or a minus ... 
All I know is this dish was fabulous and I will certainly be making it again, perhaps next time without the Dijon, to see what the difference is like. 
Thanks for a great dish. Now why didn't I think of this recipe?

The sauce barely covered the amount of noodles that was required, I added a little garlic per previous reviews and it still turned out horrible. In fact, the only thing I could taste was the garlic, the rest had no taste at all.  My daughter of 5 years somehow managed to eat her serving but the rest of us passed after the first bite. This is my first allrecipes failure.

Wonderful! Very easy to make lowfat - I omitted the cheese, and used lowfat soup and milk (stir soup & milk with a wire whisk in a separate bowl - much easier to work with when adding all ingredients together). I also add 1/8 tsp. pepper.  Note that 3 cups uncooked noodles results in 2 cups cooked noodles.  Be sure and cover the dish with foil before baking.  Tip:  if you want to fit this into a 13x9x2" casserole dish, TRIPLE the ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was simple to make and went together very easily.  It's what I call a comfort food.  Definitely not something to serve to guests, but delicious for hubby and me!!  I used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and 2% sharp cheddar cheese, along with 2% milk and this tasted wonderful.  My husband had no idea he was eating low fat, you can't tell the difference!  I also used canadian bacon instead of ham and added some cayenne and garlic powder to spice it up a bit.  I also found that mixing all the ingredients in a pan on top of the stove for a few minutes helps with the cheese melting, and reduces the time in the oven to about 15 minutes.  I think the less time spent in the oven, the creamier the dish will be.  Just a thought!!  In all, an excellent meal we will have again!

I thought this was a great, quick meal although I did make some changes. I used a can of cream of celery and a can of cream of chicken. I also added mushrooms and peas but thought this might go very well with broccoli or asparagus too. Great comfort food. Quick and easy!

This was a great casserole.  I used no yolk egg noodles and reduced fat mushroom soup.  I took anothers suggestion to saute garlic, fresh mushrooms and onion to add to the dish.  I also used skim milk instead of canned.

This recipe sounded good so I went to the pantry to see what kind of "cream of" soup I had. :(  None.  So I decided to concoct my own version of ham and noodles!  I made a basic white sauce (butter, flour, milk) to which I added about 1-1/2 t. Dijon mustard and 2 slices of American cheese (in pieces), some salt and pepper and a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce.  
While boiling about 2 c. of noodles, I chopped up the leftover ham into little cubes and tossed into the white sauce.
After draining the noodles, I poured the ham and sauce over them.  Mixed well.  Took handful of oyster crackers and put them into a plastic ziplock bag and rolled over with a can to crush. In small frying pan, I melted butter and mixed in crackers. I browned them and after scooping up a bowl of the ham and noodles, I sprinkled the crackers on top. I found that the browned cracker crumbs added a nutty flavor. It was great!! I'm on my way to get another bowlful...

I followed Jenny's suggestions:  I used 1 can of Cream of Mushroom, and 1 can of Cream of Chicken soups. Instead of regular milk, I used 1/2 can of evaporated milk.   Added crushed potato chips before I baked it.  I liked it!  Hubby said it was OK but he is not a big casserole eater!

Best comfort food ever. I skipped the soup and milk and just used the Cream Soup Base recipe from this site, to which I added a teaspoonful of garlic powder. Instead of cheddar I just used two slices of American, which I melted in with the cream soup. Could probably skip the cheese altogether next time, or else add a lot more for a more macNcheesy taste. Used elbow macaroni and added a carrot and some dried parsley. Excellent recipe and so easy to modify. Next time I'll add some frozen corn or peas or something too, there was plenty of sauce. UPDATE: Made this again, scaled to 6 servings. I left the ham at 1 cup, and used a combination of mozzarella, cheddar, and cream cheese. Added a dollop of honey dijon mustard too. Came out creamy and yummy! Also sprinkled some bread crumbs on top, but it didn't add much to the flavor so I don't think I need to do it next time.

My husband said this was the worst dinner I've made, and then we went to Burger King.
I followed other reviewer's advice and added muchrooms and peas and I added a potato chip topping. We picked out the mushrooms and chips and left the rest. 
Too bland and the textures were just not good.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe!  I even made it for my friends.  Loved it.  I used cream of chicken soup, added dijon mustard, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, garlic powder and crushed saltines on top.  Big hit!  Will definately make again!

I thought this tasted good. Its a classic basic casserole. I doubled it because I didn't see any reason in only making 4 servings. I added 1 cup of frozen defrosted peas and carrots and a crushed butter cracker topping. The topping worked well on it. I baked it for only fifteen minutes. I didn't want it drying out or the topping, I put on it, to brown too much. It reminded me of a ham version of tuna noodle casserole. I worked in the yard most of the day and was looking for a quick and filling casserole like recipe. This worked well. ty

Like many of the other reviewers, I adapted this recipe with extra ingredients. Instead of canned cream soup (they all have MSG) I made my own cream soup from the Cream Soup Base recipe on this site (although I modified that too and used heavy cream and water to subsitute for the milk). I sauteed onion, garlic and parsley and added it to the Cream Soup Base, along with real bacon pieces and shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I used a lot more noodles. After mixing my noodles and Cream Soup, I also added peas and mushrooms. I poured it into casserole dishes, sprinkled the top with more shredded sharp cheddar and some italian herb bread crumbs and baked for about 20 minutes. My 74-year old mother-in-law (an amazing cook) loved it and asked to take home the leftovers. I consider that a HUGE sucess! In fact, I forgot to salt my noodles when they were cooking and forgot to add pepper to the Cream Soup while cooking, so my recipe had no added salt or pepper and it had so much flavor, I didn't even miss them. (This coming from someone who salts everything!) Thanks for a great recipe idea!

My husband and I both loved this; and it's so incredibly easy!  Based on a couple of other reviewers, I sauteed some diced onion and added, but I think this recipe would have been a "5" on it's own.

I made some fantastic changes to this wonderful "starter" recipe. I sauteed my ham in a pan with Olive Oil, added a whole/small white onion, added fresh minced garlic, black pepper and added a bay leaf- all the while boiling pasta shells. While rinsing the pasta- i used a can of cream of chicken soup with herbs and a can of milk. mixed it all together- put in baking dish with cheddar cheese on top....so flavorful!

If you saute some onions and garlic in butter (or margarine or low trans spread), then add to this mixture, it greatly improves the flavor.  I also top with crushed potato chips before baking.

Recipes like these are so great because you can add whatever vegies and seasonings you like. I used two cans of low fat, low salt cream of mushroom soup, sauteed fresh mushrooms, lots of garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and parsley and parmesan cheese. I topped it with fresh bread crumbs and dotted with a little butter. My family loved it!

I made noodles from scratch, used cream of chicken (my kids hate mushroom), sharp cheddar, skim milk, and leftover ham.  Delicious.  Will definitely be making this again & experimenting with the recipe!  NOTE:  For those of you expressing some frustration and/or confusion, the half can of milk doesn't mean CANNED milk.  It means to fill the soup can halfway with milk!

Wonderful way to use up left over ham. Family loved it even my picky 6 yr old daughter who said "it doesn't look good but it taste good". I also added the sauteed onion and garlic. Thanks for sharing this simple tasty recipe.

Excellent dish. Used cream of celery and cream of mushroom. Lots of extra cheese. Rigatoni pasta. Hubby went back for seconds and that's all the confirmation I needed!

It should have used extra sharp cheese, since it was very bland. I did not like the fact that there was canned soup in there. When it would have been just as easy to create a white sauce, and add mushrooms. I did not see any point in the canned milk, and the recipe did not state if it was condensed milk or evaporated milk. I put a thermomiter in the dish and it was not hot in the center at the time in the recipe.

This was so good!  I didn't expect it to be, but it really was.  After reading the other reviews, I added sour cream, 1/4 tsp each of garlic powder, salt and pepper and finely ground onions.  I think it was the onions that gave it the extra flavor it needed. 

Super yummy and easy to make!  Definitely  make again.

As other reviewers have said, it is a very basic recipe.  I added too much to list here and it became an entirely different recipe. (which I may just submit after I tweak it a bit more) Bottom line is play with it a LOT.  Add things that your family likes and it may become at hit at your house. :)

This basic recipe was awesome with just a few minor tweaks. I sauteed and added onion, some drained canned peas and used cream of celery soup. I also added garlic salt as mentioned by a previous reviewer. With these additions, my family loved it and I will definitely make again, maybe with broccoli flowerets instead of peas. You could really add just about anything to this. Definitely worth a try!

I agree with other reviewers in that this recipe is a good starting point, but it is by no means complete.  Here is what I did:  sauteed 1 medium, diced onion with 1 clove minced garlic and a few sliced mushrooms.  Added 4 cups of cooked noodles to a large bowl along with onions and mushrooms, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1.5 cups diced ham, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup milk, 1/2 cup each of cheddar and provolone cheese, salt and pepper.  Mix together well and add to a greased baking dish...I also added some buttered, crushed Ritz crackers to the top (this added a nice crunch to the dish).  All in all, not a bad dish, but it definitely needs some pizzaz.

This turned out to be a great receipe w/additions.
I used Green Giant mushrooms w/garlic, shredded gourmet blend of cheddar cheese, 1 onion, 100% Lactose free fat free milk & I mixed 2/3 can of fat free cream of mushroom soup with 1/3 can of cream of chicken w/herbs. First I melted 3 tablespoons of butter, added my onion and mushrooms. I sprinkled a little Seasoned Pepper Blend & garlic powder on it while it cooked. I then added the soup and added milk a little at a time to get the right consistency. I added the ham. I continued to add Seasoned Pepper & Garlic powder until I got the right flavor. Meanwhile I cooked the egg noodles. I poured the egg noodles into the cassarole dish. Then I added some cheese to the soup mix and mixed. I poured the ham mixture over the noodles and mixed it well, then I sprinkled some cheese on top of that. I topped it off with some buttered garlic & herb bread crumbs. I put it in the oven until it was bubbly. My husband LOVED IT!!!!!

Very good.
I added an extra can of mushroom soup and a can of asparagus (all i had).
I also added shredded cheese instead of cubes.
My company was not so sure about the veggie of choice but ate it and loved it.
I will def be making this easy dish again.

Delicious and a good way to use leftover ham.  And for a dish with noodles, it reheats suprisingly well in the microwave.

This is a very simple recipe, but it would taste a lot better with little green english peas.  This is a good recipe if you're in a hurry, but it's definitely not one for guests.

My 10 year old niece found this recipe when she was looking for something similar to a recipe they serve at her school.  (Yes, she is one of those kids that actually likes school lunch! Weird, I know!)  She made this mostly by herself, with my assistance with the stove and the oven.  She used cream of chicken soup, and she used torn up cheese slices, because she said that would make it more like the school lunch type.  She loved it, ate 2 helpings (and she is tiny!) and insisted on taking the leftovers home with her.  Thanks for a recipe that made my niece very happy!

Loved it!  I was skeptical because the person a few reviews down said it was gross, but we loved it.  I used shredded cheese rather than cubed and added garlic salt and peas and it was delicious.  I will definitely fix it again next time we have left over ham.  Thanks BOBKAT2000!

Great recipe for using some of the leftover ham. I doubled it up because of the amount of ham left over and the food still came out great. I also added some thinly sliced shallot and some finely chopped garlic that I also had left over from the week and that worked well too. The family loved it.

Quite tasty!  The only creamed soup I had on hand was cream of chicken, so I had to use that (we usually use cream of asparagus since my husband doesn't like mushrooms).  Also used elbow noodles, since that's what I had.  Next time I would change the cubed cheese to shredded to melt more evenly throughout, but all in all very tasty!

Very Easy. I used Cheddar Cheese soup.  I added 3 Tbsp finely chopped onion, 1 Tbsp dried parsley, 1/4 tsp each garlic powder, salt and pepper. and 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese. I also topped with 1/2 cup pretzel crumbs, 3 Tbsp melted margarine nd 3 Tbsp shredded Cheddar cheese.

In a hurry to make dinner and get my kid to practice on time, I hastily decided to sub a can of cheddar cheese soup and omit the shredded cheese altogether. Thought it might turn out a little bland, but instead I was pleasantly surprised how well it complemented and enhanced the ham's flavor. My family raved and requested that I make my version from now on.

Well, this was totally ordinary! It was very bland.  I had to add garlic and onion powders and a can of peas and one of mushrooms. Am not impressed with this casserole, although it did have the important advantage of being quick and easy.  Might be worth it for some families just for that factor.

This was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!! Actually, I can't say that, because I have no idea what the original recipe tastes like. However, with the additions made on the suggestions of others, it was great and definitely good for family or company. Here are the changes I made: Cream of chicken soup rather than mushroom, skim milk rather than canned, grated cheese rather than cubed and the addition of another can of soup, garlic powder, pepper, dijon mustard, Tabasco, cooked onion, celery and broccoli, and a crushed potato chip topping. Mushrooms or peas would also be great. Thanks for the recipe!

 instead of cream of  chicken, 1 chopped onion, peas and topped with bread crumbs.
Will use this often.

Good comfort food!  I doubled the recipe and used 1 can of 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of chicken soup.  I added a small can of sliced mushrooms and a regular can of baby green peas.  I also threw in some garlic powder and onion powder for good measure.  I topped it with buttered bread crumbs.  My husband loved it and I even got my 17 month old to eat some!

Thanks for a simple, but very good main dish.  Much to my surprise my husband liked it.  I did add sauteed onion and garlic, kosher salt and pepper and 1 cup sour cream added to the soup with half can of milk (2%), as well as some steamed broccoli.  It was a little runny so will cut back on milk next time.  I followed other reviewers suggestion and just put some sliced Velveeta on the mixture, than topped with crushed Ritz and dotted with butter.  Definitely not a recipe for a weight watcher or someone watching cholesterol.  Of course, that's what makes it good!Will make again but do believe the extras (garlic, onion, etc) are necessary to avoid it being too bland.

Love this quick meal! It's always a hit with the kids and a great way to use up leftover ham. I usually make two at once, eat one now & freeze one for later! Using a different type of cheese each time I make it keeps it from getting boring.

I liked this recipe a lot. Though I doctored it up quite a bit. I sauteed onions, green pepper, and garlic and added it to the mix. Also added a small can of sliced mushrooms (drained of course) and sprinkled cheese and french fried onions over the top. It was awesome!!

I served this  to my daughter and her family.  Second helpings all around!  I did not stir in the soup, milk and cheese, but instead combined the soup with 3/4 c. fresh milk and poured it over the ham and noodles.  I topped that with 1 cup of grated cheese, which, when baked, looked very appetizing.  Three other changes made it very tasty-one additional cup of ham, 1 cup of frozen peas, and 3 tablespoons of grated onion.  We will serve this again.

I also added cream of chicken soup, peas, sourcream, seasoned pepper, and sauteed onions & mushrooms and ritz crackers on top w/dots of butter.  Was very good and family liked it.  It was still a little bland, next time I will add more garlic & shredded cheese and perhaps use colby/jack mix.

This was great ~ but, after reading a few reviews, I did make a few changes. I added a can of cream of chicken soup along with the cream of mushroom, a can of sliced mushrooms (drained), 1/2 a cup of frozen peas, and almost 1/2 c. more of cheese (we're cheese-lovers). Thanks for a great starter recipe Kathy.

Great Recipe - Thanks!!       Changes I made:  1. added a can of condensed cream of Chicken soup (in addition to soup in recipe!). 2. Used a cup of shredded mozzarella cheese (instead of Cheddar cheese).  3. Added 1 tbsp of Dijon mustard and 1 tsp garlic pepper. 4. Used 3 cups of cooked dumplings (instead of 2 cups egg noodles). 5. Added one 12-oz package of cooked (al-dente) petite green beans - adds a little "crunch".     Remember - you don't need "leftover" ham - you can buy a package of pre-cooked diced ham at most grocery stores!

      Top this all off with crushed Ritz crackers and generously dot with butter.   Don't be a food snob! - - this would be very nice to serve to guests in the Fall/Winter with homemade bread and a nice salad!
     p.s. - it would be more clear to if the recipe stated "evaporated milk"....for new cooks, that is!

This was really good, with a few personal modifications.  I started with a 16oz bag of frozen egg noodles (par-boiled).  I added these to a sauce I made from 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, about 3/4 c. milk (I didn't measure), sauteed onions and garlic, sliced mushrooms, cheddar cheese and a generous T. of dijion mustard.  Poured in a 13 x 9 and topped it with Cheddar Fried Onions.  It was delicious!  It's a great starter recipe with a lot of room for variation.

A great way to use left-over ham.  I doubled the recipe and didn't have egg noodles on hand so I used elbow macaroni.  I also used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of celery soup.  The result was a very creamy, very cheesy dish.

Pretty good...a little salty, I think next time I will use low sodium soup...Definitely add the peas!  I also topped off with cornflake crumbs.

Easy to make, it tastes like you'd expect.  You won't be disappointed by the recipe, but neither will you be wowed.  Think tuna noodle casserole with ham and cheese.  I'll serve it again but not regularly.

My kids and I loved this recipe.  My husband didn't care for it as well.  I added a little more ham and cheese.  I also added cracker crumbs on top the last 10 minutes of baking.  I will make this instead of mac and cheese from now on.

My mother used to make a recipe similar to this and I couldn't find hers. I chopped 2 cups of onion and sautéed them until they were translucent, then added the cubed ham and browned it in a pan before adding the rest of the ingredients. I placed this in the casserole dish and sprinkled some Italian seasoning over the top, then into the oven.

Just made this recipe for the first time. It is delicious. I took some some advice from the reviews and added a bit of my own touch. I used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom, 1/2 a can of evaporated milk, doubled the cheese, added one celery and 1/3 chopped red onion. Also a pinch of garlic powder.  Turned out great!  Thanks for sharing

Had left over spiral ham and cooked bow tie pasta.  Cooked on the stove top; cream of celery soup and milk, then added ham and noodles.  Then, sprinkled on colby monterey jack cheese.  Very good for a 5 minute dish.

I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of chicken and 1/2 can of water and I used shredded swiss cheese instead of chedder since that's what I had.  I also chopped up a small onion and added a little bit of milk before sticking it in the oven.  The family loved it!

We absolutely loved this! The reason for four stars is because the recipe calls for cheddar cheese but instead I used a bag of pizza cheese which included mozzarella, romano, parmesan, and provolone. I used quite a bit more than 1/2 cup inside and more on the top and I think that is what made this dish. I also used a can of cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and it was great. I will definitely make this again and do the same way next time.

This dish was excellent! Like the other reviews, I added some of my own things. I used 1 can of Cream of Mushroom, and 1 can of Cream of Chicken soups. Instead of regular milk, I used 1/2 can of evaporated milk. I didn't mix the cheese in with everything else, but I did add it on top of the mixture and put it back into the oven to melt. This was a great way to use our leftover Christmas ham!

This is pretty tasty!  I had some leftover noodles to use up, so I threw this together on the stove top. I used Canadian bacon, skim milk,ground pepper, and a dash of garlic powder.  I would make this again, it was so easy!

We really enjoyed this and what a great way to use up those little bits of ham.  I used cream of celery soup as thats what I had.  Also sweated a half of minced onion in margerine to add some flavor.  I used about a cup of sour cream and cottage cheese instead of the milk.  Added more longhorn cheese and some cajun and garlic seasonings.  Hubby had 2 helpings!

This dish was wonderful! It was easy to prepare and had an excellent taste. Next time, I will leave the lid off to help evaporate some of the milk so it won't be so runny. We will use this recipe next time we have leftover ham!

My mother used to make the same dish only she used spam instead of ham and it was delicious. Now I hardly make it myself because my husband and kids do not like cream of mushroom soup. But I make it every once in a while anyway.

This was pretty good, and lends itself to LOTS of tinkering.  Used pasta bowties (no noodles!) and Campbell's Roasted Garlic Mushroom Soup,  plus added chopped frozen asparagus and curry powder.  Nothing I would serve to company, but when you've got literally pounds of leftover ham, it made a nice change from ham & cheese sandwiches.  :-)

Wonderful dish!  My husband and I loved it.  Following other recommendations I used a can of cream of chicken & 1/2 can of cream of mushroom, about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, pepper, regular milk instead of canned, shredded cheese, frozen peas topped it off with crushed ritz crackers dotted with butter and it was DELICIOUS!  My husband agreed it's definitely a keeper recipe.

This recipe was alright, my 2 year old loved it, but my husband and I thought that it was missing something... I added a few drops of hot sauce, some peas and made a thin bread crumb/cheese crust on the top (that was the best part).

Pretty good, I used cream of broccoli soup and added some frozen broccoli instead of peas.. came out great, next time I'll have a second can of a cream soup on hand since I added more ham and noodles to the recipe it became sort of dried out.  Definately wouldn't make with a salty ham tho! (Our ham was very sweet and not so salty this time!)

Ok, this was really easy, and quick, but not spectacular in the taste department. Really kind of blah. I doubled the recipe and used 1 can (1/2 fat) cream of mushroom and 1 can (1/2 fat) cream of broccoli. I added the peas and some leftover pre-cooked bacon. My husband was not a huge fan and coated his with pepper, our friend who stopped buy enjoyed it and took the rest of the leftovers home for his lunch. I topped it with the french fried onions, which I had never had before and that was the best part. I guess because we are not huge ham fans this isn't the best recipe for us. I would make it again if stuck for something.
Thanks anyway,
A.

This was merely "okay".  It's tuna casserole made with ham - which I should have figured out from the ingredients.  I ended up adding about another cup of cooked noodles, 2 cups didn't seem like nearly enough to cover the 9x9 dish, or for four servings for that matter.  I also added peas - I can't imagine how completely blah it would have been without!  It lacked flavor, and I didn't care for the texture of the chunks of ham with the noodles.  Wouldn't make again.

This was wonderful! I did add 1 cup frozen peas which after reading the reviews probably helped to get rid of the "soupyness". It also thickened up during the baking process. Thanks for sharing, will definately be making this a regular in our house.

This recipie was so easy to make and my hubby LOVED it.  Will definitely make it again, only I think I will add a can of peas and some mushrooms to it to add some extra nutrition and flavor but it was good!  I recommend it for anyone looking for a quick meal.

chicken instead, and added about 3/4 tsp sage,
some pepper, and regular mustard.  Definitely a

It was okay, nothing great. It was to mushroom soupy. I would add chicken cream soup instead and add a lot more ham and cheese. Sprinkle top with cheese. Maybe add vegetables.

This recipe was very good and easy to make, but was a little 'soupy'.  Next time I make it, I will reduce the amount of milk called for, or eliminate it altogether.

This was yummy!!! I doubled this recipe because I had lots of leftover ham. I added a little salt, pepper and parsley (for color). I also added a little buttered bread crumbs on top. I will definately be making this again!!! I would have added some peas, but my husband prefers them to be separate.

I thought it was very tasty. I did utilize previous peoples' experiences and I added 1.5t of dijon mustard, 2 dashes of tabasco sauce, a handful of pineapple chunks, and crushed saltines on the top. I also used shredded cheddar instead of chunks. I think it could use a tad less than 0.5C of shredded cheese. A bit cheesier than I liked. Otherwise pretty good for a casserole.

We love this recipe!  I add a little more ham and cheese than what the recipe calls for, and the last time I made it I added onion, mushrooms, garlic powder, and about a teaspoon and a half of dijon mustard.  It was wonderful!  I think it was the mustard, but my husband didn't stop saying how much better it was.  He even called me after he ate it for lunch!  Very good!

My family enjoyed this recipe, though it didn't make much.  I added 2 tablespoons of Ro-Tel Diced Tomatoes with Green Chiles and that really spiced it up!  I also used a pie plate to cook it in.  My 2 year old loved it!  Next time, I will put something like bread crumbs on the top to prevent the noodles from hardening.

Very easy and good too.  I would grate the cheese next time, mine did not melt as well as I would have liked.  My boyfriend liked it too.  Suggested that maybe next time we could put cracker or bread crumbs on top before baking.  The recipes says that is serves 4, but we didn't think that it was enough for 4 people and we aren't large eaters.

I substitued a box of macaroni & cheese, added 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup, extra milk and 1 cup of canned pineapple chunks.  Then I sprinkled with bread crumbs on top and baked.  It was delicious.  The pineapple chunks really added extra flavor!!

Great recipe, however I added a little garlic powder and a dash or two of tabasco sauce to give a little more depth of flavor.  Also threw in a bag of frozen mixed vegetables for more color.

What to do with a million pounds of leftover ham?? This was great. Everyone loved it, even my picky 7 year old. I added peas and used Velveeta. Might try adding bread crumbs or crushed crackers on top next time.

I made it. It was surprisingly better than I expected. What I did differently: Sauteed scallion whites, some mushrooms in a bit of butter. Mixed everything else in the pan I sauteed the scallions and mushrooms in, added some chili flakes and mixed again. Put in some left over pepper cheese in spaces on top, sprinkled some Panko on top and popped in the oven. It is delicious and flavorful. Yum!

I loved it with changes. I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery (both low sodium) and two soup cans of milk. I added about a cup of sour cream, a little spicy mustard,  8 oz. of Velveeta and a handful of grated Parmesan cheese. I also added broccoli because cheese goes so well with broccoli. I used a 12 oz. package of egg noodles, and sprinkled some mozzarella and cheddar cheese on the top.  I cooked it in a  9x13 pan covered for about 35 minutes and then removed the cover and cooked it an additional 5-6 minutes. Some others had suggested putting bacon in it, but I felt it was salty enough without the bacon. I did however put crispy, chopped bacon on the table and let the others decide.

Changes made: I doubled the recipe.  I used packaged cubed Ham. Lightly sprinkled ground Oregano in the mixture, used 3/4 cups shredded cheddar cheese. Scattered several cubes of Velveeta cheese on top of casserole before baking. Delicious

Good way to use left over ham. Used what was in pantry: cream of chicken, celery seed, shredded cheddar, with crushed chips on top. Covered with foil first 25 minutes, and crisped the top under broiler last few minutes. Tastes good.  Salt and pepper to taste.

Reduced recipe for two and added frozen green peas. Baked in a 9x3 loaf pan. So creamy and delicious. I will definitely make this one again!

As a Child Mom made this....The only difference was she used Tuna, frozen sweet peas, and hard boiled eggs. "Tuna Casserole"  Great comfort food from the past. Thank you!.

I love this dish. My family & I have made it for years. While it's good with cream of mushroom soup it's better with cream of chicken.

My husband and 12 year old picky daughter love this recipe.  The only changes I made were sea shell pasta instead of egg noodles, club cracker crumbs on top, and some chopped broccoli mixed in.

This recipe was ok.  I read some of the reviews and added frozen peas, salt and pepper, and a whole can of milk instead of just 1/2.  Way too soupy.  I needed a spoon to eat it.  I also added bread crumbs on top and sharp chedder cheese.  My 2 year old loved it but I thought it was just so so.

We love this recipe at our house and it always comes out right after Christmas and Easter!  I use very sharp cheddar cheese, add little black pepper and throw on some bread crumbs and even my 3 year old gobbles it up.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought that this was a wonderful recipe.  I added a whole can of milk instead of just half and it gave the noodles plenty of liquid.  The noodles started to brown on top after 15 minutes, so I stirred it once and continued to cook it.  Thanks for this easy and delicious recipe!

My husband and I both liked with suggestions of others;  Added extra can of cream of celery and full can of milk.  Added mushrooms, garlic powder and green onion.  Use 1-2 cups ham.  My husband didn't find enough meat.

Great recipe - lots of room for flexibility.  Like others I have changed the soup flavor and substituted the vegetable, (we like broccoli).  The french fried onions (that I previously only used on the infamous Thanksgiving green bean casserole) were a really tasty addition.  Yummy!  Good comfort food.

For some reason, all four of my children loved this very simple recipe!  I wasn't thrilled about it and I don't think I would serve it to guests (it didn't look real appatizing) but if the kids will eat it- it works for me!  A used bow tie pasta since I didn't have the egg noodles in the house and I added some frozen peas.  Very easy and a good way to use leftover ham...I would certainly make it again.

This is a great recipe for a very filling meal, one that's fast to cook, and for the cook who likes to tweak.  I added cream of chix, used monteray jack & colby shredded cheese and garlic salt.  I've also alternated between lima beans (my favorite now), peas & corn as the veggie add-in.

The only reason I gave this a 4 is because I used several hints by other reviewers and it wasn't the same recipe!  I added sauted green onion (from the garden) and mushrooms.  I also added steamed broccoli (from the garden).  One can of low fat/low sodium cream of mushroom soup and cream of chicken soup were used.  You could use steamed carrots, asparagus, or sauteed celery, too.  This recipe would work with chicken, too.  Thanks, Kathy, for providing a good basic recipe.

This was a really quick and easy recipe.  I didn't have time to go shopping, so just used whatever I had in the fridge.  Like the other reviewers, I changed it around.  Doubled the recipe, added a can of cream of chicken and cream of celery (didn't have another can of cream of chicken).  Added a little pepper, frozen mixed veggies, used one can of 2% milk instead of the can of milk, and changed the cubed cheddar to shredded cheddar.  Pretty good with salad.

Very good. Even my little picky eater ate it up! After reading through the reviews and changes made by others I decided to change it as well. That is why I didn't give it the full 5 stars. I added a can of cream of chicken soup (along with the can of cream of mushroom). I substituted shredded cheddar for the cheese cubes. Next time I will try using low sodium soups since the ham makes this a bit salty for my taste. I've also made this recipe with chicken instead of ham & it's just as good.

Without any changes or additions, this recipe would be pretty bland.  I did give it three stars because it was a good starting point.  I added an extra can of soup (cream of chicken), doubled the cheese, and also added some garlic powder and minced onion.  It turned out really yummy and I will be making it again, but only with the additions.

Made this last night. Took the advice about adding  precooked vegetables, dijon mustard and a few drops of hot sauce.  This dish NEEDS some additional flavor!!  I am a vegetarian, so divided it up and added the ham to my husband's portion before baking. Baked it for about 25 mins., then topped it with some French's french fried onions and baked for another 5 or 6 mins.  It's a very versital recipe -- could add anything.  Didn't have canned milk -- used regular 2% -- that worked just fine.

I am not sure what I did wrong, but this was so salty! Maybe next time I will try using the soup with less sodium to see if that helps. Other than that, it was great! My husband loved it, salt and all.
