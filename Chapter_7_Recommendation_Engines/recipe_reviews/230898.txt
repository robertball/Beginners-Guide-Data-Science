Great recipe! A couple things I would change- LESS CREAM CHEESE, and make sure it is extra softened! I served this appetizer with tortilla chips, and mine was firm enough to crack the chips! Delicious, gooey, bean-y dip! Thank you Philadelphia!

This went over great at my party. My friend who didn't like cream cheese loved it. She will now eat many other dishes that are made with cream cheese.
