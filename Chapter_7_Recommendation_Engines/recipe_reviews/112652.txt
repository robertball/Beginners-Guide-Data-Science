This is mine and my husband's favorite candy.  Every year starting in July he asks me if I am going to make these for Christmas.  We use a local blackberry wine and they are fantastic!!!  I wish I could give them more than 5 stars!

What a delicious recipe! The truffles can be rolled in toppings, or simply enjoyed by themselves. My son and I are chocolate lovers, and we agree this is a 5 star recipe. He thought it was neat that the "candy" had wine in it, haha!

First I have to say that I don't eat sweets but made these for my hubby and friends for Valentine's Day.  I gave them out early because we were not going to be here on V Day.  Anyway, everyone really enjoyed but said that they were very very rich, almost too much chocolate.  They also said that they could not taste the wine.  Easy to make though.  Thanks for posting the recipe

This was my first time making truffles.

The recipe is very easy.  I was worried when I took the chocolate out of the fridge because it was very hard and crumbly.  It softened up nicely with the heat of my hands and rolled very well in just a couple of minutes.

These little chocolates are *very* rich!  I wouldn't recommend making them any larger than the 3/4 inch balls in the recipe.  Maybe even make them a little smaller.

I made the recipe as directed and the wine flavor was just a hint.  It complemented the chocolate well, but I will try just a little more wine next time.

To decorate, I dipped the top of the ball in just the tiniest bit of sea salt - these were a HUGE hit!

I used sweet blackberry wine my family received as a Christmas gift and the taste was incredible! Dark chocolate cocoa or powdered sugar works great.

Added 1/4 cup blackberry wine.  They were great. Glazed white choc on top that I drizzled and a beautiful pink frosted pearl for my daughters wedding.  Lots of compliments.

These are really good. Expect I added about half a cup of wine. I don't understand why it says just a tablespoon.

Really liked it.  But we did modify it.  We don't do alcohol and wanted different flavors as well.  So we started with this recipe, and for Orange Truffles added orange extract and zest (to the chocolate center).  For Rasberry, added Raspberry extract.  And for chocolate, we added vanilla.  All of these worked really well!  

The challenge we faced with all of the recipes, as we didn't know how to melt the chocolate best or how to dip / drizzle the chocolate well (until the end).   

First I burned the melted chocolate a bit (really need to keep it melted on a LOW heat (remove it need be).  We don't have a proper double broiler, so we simply used a corningwear salad bowl over a boiling pot of water.  Not letting the bowl actually sit in the water was helpful too.

With the dipping, I made quite a mess trying to use a fork, a tooth pick, my fingers...etc. to coat the centers.  Finally, my son worked with me.  I rolled the centers and dipped the bottom half of the balls in the chocolate, and placed them on the wax paper.  He then took a spoon and drizzled the melted chocolate over the centers.  This worked!  Next year we'll have a lot more pretty truffles than this year's!   But we will make them again.  :-)

BTW, this made probably 80 truffles - plenty!  With a little more detail for this novice, we'd have rated the recipe a 5.  Thanks for sharing!  And Merry (belated) Christmas!
