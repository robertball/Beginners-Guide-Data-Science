Nice! Yesterday, I filled them with warm Greek yogurt and topped them fresh pear slices warmed in maple syrup. Today, I made them without the vanilla then filled them with wilted spinach, sliced ham and cheddar. Easy and good.

I cooked mine on medium heat and it worked well! I slipped and put too much salt in... but other than that, they were delicious.

Excellent!  I put 2/3 cup of flour instead of the half cup. They were just a little too thin before.

These are very similar to a crepe. The baking powder makes them spongier than a crepe. These were very good the next day, too. Thank you for the recipe.
