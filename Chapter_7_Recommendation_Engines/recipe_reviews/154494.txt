I made these and the family LOVED them!  So did the neighbor kids!  (I did tweak it slightly and added more vanilla and a tsp of peppermint.)

Absolutely TO DIE FOR. I used extra-dark chocolate chips. We loved them. Very easy for my oldest boy to pretty much make solo, with me looking over his shoulder. He had a lot of fun making this and the look on his face when he added the Hershey's syrup? Priceless. NOTE: Baking time is a little off on this recipe. Ours were done at just under thirty minutes. I think had I not paid attention and just told my son to go the full amount, we would have had burned brownies.

Thank you Kristin!  This is a very forgiving and malleable recipe.   For some reason we were out of chocolate syrup, so I added one square of Baker's semisweet chocolate and half a container of chocolate flavored icing to the mix.  Hubba hubba!  I'm just not sure the kids are going to get any of these.  It would be a shame to allow anybody but me to eat them :) great without frosting or with.  This is my first batch of scratch brownies, and is the recipe I will always turn to :)

I followed the recipe as written, no substitutions or additions.  The brownie had a strange texture, not really a brownie or a cake some where in the middle very airy and somewhat chewy.  Don't get me wrong it was good, will get eaten, even better with some icing on top.  I just don't think I would make again.

Oh.my.gosh.these.are.yummy. I just made these and we ate one after they cooled for about 45 minutes and they were delish! I can't wait til they're cooled down completely and the chocolate chips are solid again.(UPDATE: These are awesome once the chips have solidified again). They're quite good and so ridiculously simple to make. The only thing I did differently was I used one less egg and the syrup I accidentally bought the other day (sugar free). It had a slight wang to it but the flavor was really good. I took away an egg to try to make them denser and less cake like but they were still a lil fluffy, with the exception of the center pieces because I undercooked them by about 5 minutes to make them fudgier. Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make these again.

UPDATE: 4 days later and the entire batch I made is GONE so I am making another batch of these yummy brownies! This time I did 1 1/2 times the recipe so they'd last a little longer. My husband and daughter LOVED these, as did I. I forsee making a lot of these in my future as the demand seems to be high for them! :)

These were alright as far as brownies.  Mine seemed to be "cakey", but it might have been my fault.  Instead of putting 1 cup of chocolate chips in  it, I just sprinkled some on the top of half of the pan because I was afraid it would be to chocolaty for us.  I had recently mad another recipe that was almost bitter chocolate flavor.  I would definitely put in the chocolate chips if I were to try it again because I think they need the extra "chocolaty moisture."  They did have a good flavor though...thanks Kristin.

These are oh so chocolatey and delicious!  Made them for a family get together and my family ate them up.  I even used the Chocolate Syrup from this site.  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chocolate-Syrup/?prop31=2

These were not my cup of tea.  I followed the recipe exactly and found them to be expensive compared to other recipes...overly sweet and disliked their bitter after taste.    To add insult to injury...They stuck to the pan and I was forced to run to the store to purchase a box mix to fulfill a bake sale promise.

These were great! I think next time I'll reduce or eliminate the chocolate chips. I think they were a bit distracting from the nice texture and flavor of the brownie itself. I also need to check the brownies after about 32 minutes to keep the edges from being overdone. But they are REALLY tasty!

These were awesome!  I made them for my youth group and they loved it!  Not a crumb was left...some of the kids ate 2-3 bars!  The only substitute i made was the chocolate syrup.  I didn't quite have enough so i added some butterscotch caramel by Mrs. Richardson.  Definitely will make these again!

I was looking for an easy recipe and this certainly fit the bill. It's fudgy, moist and the right recipe for a chocolate lover.

Not bad but not what I expected from the reviews.
The texture was cake like, not strong enough in chocolate and not sweet enough for my taste.  My husband liked it but found it had an after taste of something we can't put our finger on.
It is a pleasant desert with icing or ice cream, but only fair on it's own.  
Will probably not make this again.

I have made browies with cocoa powder, brownies with melted chocolate, brownies from a box, but had never made brownies with chocolate syrup before.  While these baked up beautiful and my kids liked them, I have had richer, fudgier brownies and won't be making this one again.

I made the recipe as written.  The baking time given would have been too long in my oven; I took them out at about 30 minutes.  I was hoping this recipe would be an enhanced version of the original Hershey syrup recipe, but it wasn't.  It was lacking in flavor and the texture was less than appealing for me.

OMG!!!!!!!! These brownies were so awesome! I found myself liking the bowl and spoon! I added 3/4 cup of walnuts... I made them for dinner, and I didn't even want my husband to know.  I wish I could keep them all to myself! I will definitely be making these brownies again!

These were very tasty.  I do have to say that 40 minutes in the oven seems way too long.  I had my timer set for 30 minutes and the edges came out a little overdone.  I did use a dark non-stick pan.  Think that I will try a glass pan next time to see if that makes a difference.

Moist and fudgy.  Four stars as made, five stars by adding frosting (Sour cream chocolate frosting from this site).  I made half a pan with nuts and half without nuts.  I will be making this one again.  Thanks Kristin for sharing.

These were sooooo good! My sister and brother are currently chowing down. I left out the chocolate chips and used a lot less syrup, and the brownies came out fluffy and cakey. They were also finished at about thirty minutes. Not what we expected to happen, but they're still great nonetheless!

There are no words.  Every other brownie recipe that I saved will now be deleted.  OMGosh, these were sooo yummy!  They were absolutely perfect.  I just wish they were thicker and that would be easy to fix.

I am going into 6th grade and I made these myself and before they were cooked they smelled yummy and oh sweet sweet goodness. My family was surprised that I made these myself and so am I! I LOVE COOKING!!! i would say 35 min. not 40 because i did 38 and that was  a bit to much. Try them,Make some!!!

This is a very good recipe but I will tweak it a little the next time I make them. The recipe says to mix all the wet ingredient together... Well next time I will mix the wet ingredients minus the egg. Once that is mixed enough I'll THEN add the egg. I felt like I had to mix them all together too much to get them to blended, causing the brownies to be a little cake like but also kinda tough/very chewy. Not soft and fudgy due to over mixing the egg. Eggs you really only want to mix JUST enough to blend in when making brownies. I will also add a dollop of mayo next time for some extra moisture. Maybe even a little extra oil. I like my brownies very moist and gooey!

These are fabulous! Honestly this is my first review on Allrecipes but had to comment! They are so easy that there is no reason to buy boxed brownie mix again! Mini chocolate chips make them better than regular size chocolate chips in my opinion! My ONLY issue is that I made these for a bake sale and individually wrapped they do not look very appealing.  Once someone eats one of these chewy, yummy brownies, the presentation is irrelevant! My husband and kids could not stop eating these brownies!

These were ok. I used dark chips and dark cocoa do the flavor with the syrup was very good. My oldest really loved these. I was looking for a fudgy brownie. This isn't it. This is a chewy cake brownie. Made exactly as Written. It's brownies- so it's not bad. It was the texture that dropped the rating.

I loved everything about this recipe. The brownies were soft on the inside and chewy on the outside. The chocolate chips gave them a lovely richness. I don't think there is anything I would do to change this recipe but I would encourage you to make a double batch. Thanks for the recipe.

I made these for my sister last night. I made them just like the recipe except I used white chocolate chips instead of semisweet. I cooked them the full 40 minutes. Big mistake! They wound up cooked on the top but burnt on the bottom. They stuck to the pan. They were hard to get out even though I had greased my whole pan. I've never had this much trouble with a brownie recipe before! I'm the main baker in my family and am willing to give this recipe another shot,because thr batter tasted so good! I think I'll reduce the baking time by 10 minutes, because 30 minutes is the usual cooking duration for any brownie recipe.

I was looking for a brownie recipe that was dense and fudgey and thought these might do the trick. These were pretty yummy but they turned out a little more cake-y than I was hoping for. I'll keep searching for my dream brownie recipe but in the mean time I'm sure I'll have no trouble finishing off this pan ;)

These were the hugest hit and my all time favs now! I make them with mini silicone brownie pan and bake on 350 c for 15 minutes. Think I will try half with the peppermint, sounds like it could be rather yummy!
