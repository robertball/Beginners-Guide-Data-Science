Of course you can fill sufganiot with cheese for Chanukah, remember the story of Judith the heroine? she used cheese, because of that cheese is one of the ingridients used in Chanukah. Now, I agree in filling the sufganiot after is been fried. Thanks Rachel for this recipe!

This recipe makes good sufganiot.    We mixed ours in a bread machine and let it rise until more than doubled in volume -- about 1.5 hours.  We rolled dough to about 3/8 inch thick and cut into circles about 2.5 inches in diameter.  Then let rise until again doubled in volume.  Fry in oil until lightly browned on both sides.  Let them drain/cool on a drying rack over paper towels, puncture through to the center with a small thin knife, and then fill through that slit using a cake decorator with a long thin tip.  We filled some with raspberry preserves, some with Marion berry, and (at our daughter's request) some with marshmallow fluff.  We sprinkled confectioners sugar over the top - rather than rolling them in it.  Nothing wrong filling them with cheese.  Happy Chanukah!!!
