At first I wasn't sure about these, they were kind of fragile once you took off the paper around them and poured the gelatin on them. But once I set them in the fridge for awhile and then frosted them they were really good !

Just made these for a mom's holiday brunch. They looked really pretty on the plate and tasted good too.  Only thing I'd do differently next time is to poke deeper holes in the cupcakes.  It was my first time making a poke cake and I didn't poke deep enough with the fork.  All in all - I'd make again.

Must be kept cold. I took them to an outdoor function on a hot day and they got mushy.

I was looking for one of my old recipes to see if any one had posted it. I think that the crushed candy topping is too overwhelming. I have been making a similar recipe for years. I make it as a cake with the white cake mix, after it's done i poke holes and pour Strawberry Banana Gelatin liquid over the top and top it with whipped cream and refridgerate for 1 hour. Its a wonderful,light, fluffy simple cake that everyone loves.  Tip: i use low fat jello and whipped topping you cannot tell the difference
