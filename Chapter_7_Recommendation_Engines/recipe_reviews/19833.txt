This is my favorite recipe.  The only change I make is to spread chocolate Smucker's Magic Shell on the crust before adding the filling.  That way, it gets hard when the pie is frozen and it has the hard chocolate just like a nutty buddy.

Easy to make and delicious.  I only filled two store-bought pie shells, though.  A friend tried this same recipe and used all three. I guess it depends on how full you like them.

Excellent. I've made it twice and it's gone in 5 minutes. However I've only used creamy peanut butter. I dislike crunchy

This recipe is fantastic. I used a chocolate cookie crust and sprinkled chopped nuts and mini chocolate chips around the outside of the crust for a dramatic effect!

This was really good and very easy to make. I added smuckers magic shell like others and put chocolate chips around edges.

Very easy!  The first time I made this pie it was a hit!  I used reduced-fat graham cracker crusts, reduced-fat cream cheese, reduced-fat peanut butter, and fat-free Cool Whip and it turned out just fine.  Next time, I think I'll try Magic Shell instead of chocolate syrup so it will look and feel more like a nutty buddy ice cream cone.

Great recipe. I add more peanut butter and use a chocolate cookie crumb crust.  It taste like a snicker's icecream bar.  Yummy!  All three pies are gone very quickly.  My hubby can eat one all by his self.

A friend made this for dessert the other night and it was fabulous! I can't wait to make it myself. Taste just like the ice cream!
