This recipe is TERRIFIC!!  I served it with grilled zucchini, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with parmesan, salt and pepper.  One word of caution, however: living on Puget Sound, we eat a lot of fresh fish... and good quality tuna should never be cooked "well done" or opaque in the middle as you will end up with VERY DRY fish.  It should still be pink in the middle!  Thanks for the GREAT recipe, Doreen!

Absolutely great!  Really, Really scrumptious.  I cooked it on the stovetop using a cast-iron skillet, and it was still really great. A definite keeper. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

I used this marinade on Ahi Tuna steaks and they were just fabulous.  I added a bit more garlic and a few shakes of salt.  Also, be sure to not overcook!  Very tasty!!!

Good but not great. I wouldn't cook the tuna steaks as long as they advocate here. They came out too dry. I might try it again but cut the cooking time.

This was the best Tuna recipe I have tried thus far, and I have tried a least a dozen from various sources. This is the only one I have cooked more than once. It is simple and delicious.

I customized this by using a scant 1/4 c oil, 2 lg cloves garlic, 1 tbsp tarragon vinegar, 1 tbsp dried tarragon leaves, 1 tsp black pepper, and 1 tsp salt. Blended all together in food processor leaving the garlic fairly minced.  In a glass pie plate poured it over 2- 1/2lb pieces of 1/2" thick fresh tuna make sure some gets on the bottom of the fish covered with plastic wrap and put in frige 30  min. Removed plastic put in preheated oven at 350 degrees cooking in the marinade.  After 10 min flip cook another 10 min then flip again for 10 min if you want it well done as hubby wanted it. Personally I would have taken it out after 20 min with a little pink in the middle as 30 made the tuna dry.  Cant wait until it warms up outside to try this on the grill will try xlg shrimp and scallops on the grill with this recipe!

Great all the way, followed the recipe to the tee, cooked on grill at high heat about 7 or 8 minutes per side and tuna came out medium rare which is almost perfect. For myself I like tuna more rare, but the wife does not. If you like a rarer tuna I suggest cookong 5 minutes per side on high heat.

As mentioned by another reviewer, good but not great.  I recommend adding more garlic.  Although this recipe is easy, I won't make this one again.

This was good--not great, but good. I liked the flavor of the tarragon (I used fresh), but I wasn't so crazy about the vinegar with the tuna.

I did not have tarragon vinegar, so I soaked terragon in vinegar before I added the vinegar to the recipe. I also used the tarragon  as directed in the recipe. We liked this and I will make it again. Tarragon does not overpower the mild tuna flavor. Also!! When I was reading through the reviews, I noticed another Seattle area person said that tuna should be pink inside when cooked otherwise it is too dry. I concur! Don't Over Cook!

Nice tuna recipe. I agree with the reviews that decrease the cooking time. If you have a 1 in thick tuna steak, I wouldn’t cook anymore that 5 min per side. This will give you a nice pink center. I used fresh tarragon (about 2 stalks worth), white wine vinegar, and a little extra garlic. Turned out great!

Excellent!  Cut the cook time in half, and marinade overnight.
