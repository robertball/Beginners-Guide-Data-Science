this recipe is easy to make, and the bread for it is fabulous. I follwed the recipe very closely and it turned out bland I think its missing something will have to play with to figure it out

Add a little red cooking wine, garlic, and salt and this has a good flavor.

It was kinda bland so I added red wine (not a lot) basil garlic powder salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper. I let it simmer for a while probably like 3-4 hours and I made homage bread to top it! It was an awesome recipe!

The only change I made was to use 42 ounces of reduced-sodium beef broth instead of the condensed broth and water.  Delicious!
