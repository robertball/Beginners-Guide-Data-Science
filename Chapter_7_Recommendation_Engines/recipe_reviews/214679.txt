I was very much looking forward to trying this recipe for me but to my surprise, my hubby instantly fell in love with this and he doesn't even like bell peppers of any color. First bite in and he was praising it like he has only done a few others from this site. Don't get me wrong, he enjoys many from here but this one really stood out to him to the point he was talking about it the rest of the night and already asking when we would have it again. This recipe is great hot or cold and I agree with him in the fact it should be part of our regular rotation. I added green onion to the top because we like it so much and it was good but not necessary. All of the flavors blend splendidly with one another in this and I wouldn't change a thing. Thank you for sharing geranium and congratulations on your Packers ;)

Made this for the Recipe Swap, flower girl, and it was great. :) I used kalamata olives and my own cherry tomatoes, quartered, cus that's what I had, and a grilled chicken breast left over from the night before.(had been basted while grilling with lime/butter), and I used fresh herbs. :) Made a gorgeous presentation in the peppers, too. Added my photo til you take one of your own! :)

This was a very delicious recipe!  I made it exactly as written.  I would suggest that for the amount of dressing, I would use a scant cup of orzo or even a little less because it did need a little more dressing.  A little garlic in the dressing would have worked well, too.  Serving it in the pepper was a nice idea but totally not necessary.  Actually, I might even just dice up a quarter of the pepper and add it to the salad.  It just depends on your presentation.  I was thinking that adding a quarter cup of toasted pine nuts would have been perfect with this!   You can see that this is a versatile idea that will become part of your cooking repertoire.  Thanks for posting, geranium!  UPDATE:  I microwaved the little bit of the leftover pasta the next night, and it was delicious served warm, too!

Very good salad, either hot or cold.  I did make a few changes though; I think it would have been better with a little fresh parsley & I did not serve mine in red pepper cups.  Remember to add more vinegar and evoo before eating leftovers!

This was really, really good. I liked the dressing a lot. Didn't use red pepper cups, and added some fresh parsley from the garden. Thanks!

This was great for a hot summer super.  I used the breast meat from a store bought roasted chicken and kalamata olives.  I added a half of a large cucumber seeded and chopped and 4 green onions sliced very thin. The flavors were great and the dressing was just the right amount--not too heavy but flavorful enough to know it was there.  This will be a summer staple.

Hi all,  I just made this & it's in the fridge cooling.  I didn't want the chicken, just wanted a nice side dish. I won't serve in the pepper cups though its a nice presentation for sure. I didnt have tomatoes so I used 1/2 can of diced with jalapenos instead but would be better with fresh I know. When I made the dressing I just added 3/4 tsp Italian seasoning instead of basil & oregano & a dash of lemon juice.  My husband who didn't understand what a Orzo salad was just said mmmm, when I gave him a sample :-)

Very tasty! Did not make any changes, per se, but did leave out the olives and fresh sprigs for topping it.

Oh my, this was so delicious. I changed a couple of things for personal preference. I used cherry tomatoes instead of grape tomatoes. I left out the black olives, but put cucumbers in and doubled the amount of feta. Last change was only 1/2 tsp oregano. I didn't bother with the pepper cups.

Delicious!  Left out the chicken this time and added some diced red onion, hothouse cucumber and canned chick peas.  Looking forward to leftovers!

This was very good. I halved the recipe  and we got 3 good-sized servings. The only planned change was to chop the pepper(I used green because it needed using) and mix it in. After mixing, I decided to add a half dozen more grape tomatoes for color and the veggie value. I was afraid it would be too much dressing but was glad I used it all. We'll definitely make this again but perhaps with the additional change of using kalamata olives.

Fantastic! I made this just as written for the most part.  I didn't have onion powder so I just added a small handful of fresh diced onion and I topped it with fresh Basil leaves.  Oh, and I used kalamata olives instead of black.  I loved the presentation and taste of the bell pepper cups.  My whole family raved.  :) Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Found this after searching orzo pasta salads and it has become a household favorite! I don't serve it in pepper cups, instead I just chop up the red pepper. It is great served cold. It's hard to have just one serving! And very easy to make! My husband likes it as much as I do! Yum!

Tasty combination!  I made it a day ahead and refrigerated overnight, and it turned out pretty dry the next day - so I doubled the dressing.  That turned out to be too much... I'll make this again to do some more tweaking.  I was a little turned off by the nutrition stats - but in my opinion, it makes WAY more than four servings as written.  More like 8-10 servings, in my estimation.

used recipe as a guideline - 1 cup wheat orzo, 2 chicken breasts, extra tsp dijon mustard, no olives, cut up red peppers and red onion and mixed everything together - could definitely be served warm or cold

This recipe turned out great!  Made a bit different as I didn't have feta cheese or red bell peppers.  I separately baked boneless, skinless chicken thighs in the oven.  The orzo pasta dish was made earlier in afternoon and left to cool to room temperature.  I used a lot of small cherry tomatoes and another whole tomatoe to use it up.  Added 1 whole can of black olives (kids love them).  Served this pasta on a plate with warm chicken served on top.  I didn't use feta cheese (didn't have any) or put into red bell pepper cups.  Just great.  Perfect for hot summer dinner.

We loved this salad!  I used all the ingredients, except the olives, and chose to chop the red bell pepper rather than stuffing it with the mixture.  This made a nice salad for packed lunches.  Thanks, geranium for sharing, it is a keeper.

I really wanted to love this, but it turned out the dijon was too powerful for me, taking over the great flavors of the other ingredients.  I knew it was  risky for me not liking Dijon, but my husband loves dijon so I knew it work out -- he thought it was great.  Easy to make, but probably won't give it another try.

This was absolutely wonderful and everyone raved about it.  I used smoked chicken breast and diced the red pepper rather than using it as cups.

Rated this 4 stars only because I made some changes. I didn't serve this in red peppers but chopped red and green peppers and added to the orzo. Also chopped some chives. I seasoned the chicken with a spicy seasoning to give it a very slight kick. Used Roma tomatoes because that's what I had on hand. Made the dressing as written.  I will make this again.
