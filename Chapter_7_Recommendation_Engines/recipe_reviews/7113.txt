I really liked this recipe for a few different reasons...1st being the small amount of sugar...second the applesauce vs. oil...third the cinnamon... fourth...they were so darn good!!  I did add the whole eggs tho, and I doubled the recipe and added a whole bag of bitter sweet chips.  Yummy, thanks Angela!!

My family loves these muffins!  I make them as mini-muffins, as they seem a bit chewy as regular size muffins.  My daughter (a semi-picky teen) would eat the whole batch if you let her!  Makes about 48 mini-muffins; I bake them for 5-8 minutes.

Go ahead and use the two whole eggs--they're not that bad for you.  Reduce sugar to 1/2 cup and add 1 tsp. vanilla.  I also just use one of those individual servings of applesauce, since that's all we ever have around.  Although I wouldn't call this my favorite muffin recipe, the muffins keep well, travel well, freeze & reheat well, plus they are a snap to make.  Finally, I haven't met a kid yet who doesn't like them, including my picky middle child who has a penchant for those huge "name-brand" grocery store muffins.  Although they don't taste very much alike, he finds these to be an acceptable substitute.

I'll admit I love making theses. 1 thing I tried that I like better is using light brown sugar, instead of white sugar.  Try it I think you'll it like it too!

great recipe ... as many other people I altered it based on what we had inthe house so \i added more chocolate chips, some crushed pecans, ground walnuts and oats, and didn't have applesauce so i melted some margarine and used 2 whole eggs but used a bit less sugar and added a teaspoon of honey and a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  They turned out GREAT!!! thanks!!!!

These are really good for a low-fat version of a banana muffin. My 2 year old loves them for a snack. They're a little more dense than I'd like, but I'd still make them again. Next time I'd add an extra banana and a bit more cinnamon for added flavour. I didn't add the chips and they still turned out yummy!

These muffins have become a staple in my house. I usually make mini muffins as a healthy, delicious snack for my two year old.  He can't get enough of them.  sometimes I use splenda instead of sugar and throw in a little more than 1/4 of applesauce (basically an entire single serve container).  Will definitely keep this recipe around for a long time.

These muffins are great! I use Splenda instead of sugar to lower the calorie count and it works well too. The chocolate chips adds richness but the applesauce and splenda takes away the guilt! Great recipe!

When i saw how healthy this was made, i jumped all over this recipe!  I tried not to change it, but i did....i used 1C flour, and 1/2c whole wheat flour.  I used brown sugar instead of white, added a touch of vanilla and used 3 medium sized bananas.  I didnt measure the bananas, though, figured it was more than enough and then some.  Turned out great!! I baked it in a 9x5 loaf pan for 46 minutes!

Very good muffins!  I altered the recipe a bit when I made them.  Added 1 tsp vanilla, reduced the chocolate chips to 1/4 cup, and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Also substituted half that sugar with Splenda.  Very easy recipe.  Thank you!!

Virtually moldy applesauce in the fridge called for creativity.  Squashed canned pears seemed to work fine.  I hate wasting the egg yoke, so just added two whole eggs.  I'm alive to tell about it, and the muffins are great!

Great muffins, especially since they don't have any butter or oil.  These were good after school snacks for my kids.

I modified this recipe slightly.  I used the whole egg, used half white sugar, half brown sugar, and mini chocolate chips because I didn't have the normal ones.  I liked how these turned out but they are not the best muffins I have ever had.  They were a little rubbery but I would still make them again.  Next time I might try just using the whites but I didn't want to waste the yolks.  I also would not recommend using mini chocolate chips.  I definitely like it better with normal sized chips.  Overall a good recipe but falls short of great.

I thought this was very good...I modified it based on our tastes...whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon, and brown sugar instead of white, and whole eggs instead of just the egg whites.  They were a little bit browner than I would have liked at 15 minutes, so next time I will cut back on the time a bit.

very good.  I did add more chocolate chips.  i also greased and floured the muffin tins as I was out of muffin liners.  I also added a streusel topping: brown sugar, flour and butter.  about a heaping teaspoon on each.  I also use brown sugar instead of white sugar .  thanks so much for this easy, great recipe.  I loved the idea of using mayo!

These were very good muffins, but I did make a few changes.  I used 2 whole eggs, added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/4 cup of milk and reduced  sugar to 1/2 cup.  Made a great base recipe and the muffins were moist and had the perfect consistency.

Very tasty!  Gotta love that they are a lower in fat than other traditional muffins.  My only mionr complaint is the texture was a little spongy to me.  Thanks for sharing!

These muffins were great!  I left out the chocolate chips, though, which was fine.  I used all whole wheat flour instead of white.  I used one single serving of Mott's apple sauce.  It already had sugar, so I used 1/3 cup of light brown sugar.  I added a little extra cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla.  They are great tasting AND guilt free!

These were GREAT! Loved the use of egg whites and applesauce and NO butter and NO oil - thank you for sharing!

I even reduced the chocolate chips to 1/4 cup and added a 1/4 cup of natural creamy peanut butter. Took the calories up slightly to 177 based on our ingredients - but the added peanut butter flavor and added protein were what we wanted.

The more banana the merrier for this one - I use up whatever bananas that I have, and I made these with whole wheat flour and they are just as good. Thanks for a good one!

i think i was also expecting a more cakelike muffin.  these came out a little rubbery and just not a whole lot of flavor.  i probably will not use this recipe again.

Great recipe, and lower fat!  My kids (about your age) loved them.  My youngest is allergic to eggs, so I made some without the egg whites, and they were awesome too, and actually rose higher!  I made them without the chips (since I had none handy).  Still great!

I didn't have applesauce, so I just used more mashed bananas. The muffins were delicious and I love that they are low in fat. One problem about no fat, though... they do not do well in paper muffin cups. In fact, about a third of the muffin was left behind. Too bad, because they taste great! Next time, I will butter all my muffin tins instead.

Quite good! I used 1/2 Non-Fat vanilla yogurt in place of applesauce. Changed the flour to 1 C flour with 1/2 whole wheat flour. Added some grated semi-sweet choc. & some pumpkin pie spice too! Baked in an 8 X 11 pan for about 18min.
GREAT WAY TO USE UP THOSE RIPE BANANAS!!! AND NONE OF THE GUILT THAT GOES WITH THE FATTY VERSIONS.

I made these muffins into mini muffins - they turned out just a bit too dry inside.  My 2 year old loves them though.

I love banana muffins, I always try to buy one on my way to work in the city.  These are great because they are low in fat but they do have the added treat of a few chocolate chips.  I made this recipe as six large muffins and increased the time by five minutes.

WOW! Are you kidding me???? THESE are low fat? No way! They are soooooo good!!!! I didnt have chocolate chips but did have wafers so I just chopped those up. I read a review they were chewy but didnt find that the case at all. If you find them rubbery, then you overmixed them. The recipe says to mix just until moistened. Do not beat! These are fabulous! My health nut friends are going to love them. THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Very tasty! I also added a few more choc chips.  Used muffin cup papers and they stuck to the paper.  Will likely spray tin or cups next time. These won't last long at my house.

Followed directions exactly and they were great! I will definitely make them again.
Just make sure you adjust temp and bake time as necessary. My oven runs hot so I did 375 and I used a mini muffin pan so they only needed about 11 minutes.

These were pretty good for what they were. I don't like choco chips in my banana muffins but thought the kids might. That being said I used three medium bananas for the banana, used no applsauce, 1/2c sugar, and two whole eggs. They were deliciously moist and not too sweet to eat for breakfast.

I made this recipe with some substitutions:  first, I only made half the recipe, 6 muffins.  I used half whole wheat, half regular flour; half white sugar, half brown sugar; and Ener-g egg replacer instead of the egg whites.  The muffins tasted great.  I would actually use less sugar next time since my bananas were so sweet and ripe.  I'll definitely try this again, maybe subbing blueberries for the chocolate chips, and adding ground flaxseed.

These were a great combination of chocolate and banana, and the applesauce kept it all together without disturbing the flavor too much.  They were also just the right amount of sweetness.  The texture was a little bit rubbery though, more condusive to a bread than a muffin.

Great recipe and didn't feel guilty!  Also, made it with blueberries and added about 1 tsp reduced fat cream cheese, balled up, into the center of the muffin.  Had to add a little extra applesauce.  Turned out awesome!!!

When mixing the muffins it seems really dry but they turn out excellent.  A little more chewy than normal but they taste so good they have become a favorite for work lunches and evening snacks.

Wow and not a good wow....followed the recipe and these muffins are pretty 'rubbery' , would make a great tennis ball. I don't recommend this recipe at all.

I agree with another reviewer that these are kind of chewy in the big muffin form.  For a diet muffin, these are pretty good.  Of course they don't taste as rich as a full fat muffin.  I followed the recipe exactly, using mini chocolate chips and only got 10 decent sized muffins but my tins are a little bigger.

These were good. I used melted coconut oil instead of apple sauce. They rose nicely and made 12 large muffins. Will add this to go to muffin recipes.

I left out the applesauce (didn't have any in the house) and used 2.5 bananas and ~1/8 cup of olive oil. Turned out great! Super moist and great flavor!

Rich tasting and good weight - feels like you are getting a sumptuous muffin. I substituted whole wheat pastry flour for half of the AP flour. I used liquid egg whites (1/3 cup), "mini" choc chips, and cinnamon applesauce.

These are so good!  It is hard to believe they are low fat!  I used half wheat/half white flour, just a tad less sugar and the whole egg.  Will be making agian.

I thought this recipie was very easy to make. I only had cinnamon applesauce and I made them into mini muffins. I also used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate. They are a little rubbery, but the kids don't mind. This has made a great after school snack.

I guess I was expecting a more cake-like muffin.  Although the toothpick came out clean, it seemed like they weren't done and the texture was rubbery.  My search for the perfect low-fat banana muffin sadly continues.

These were awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly and I was very impressed.  I do have to say they're better freshly baked, but nothing a few seconds in the microwave couldn't solve.  Also, I don't think it needs the cinnamon, but that's a personal preference thing.  I will make these as often as I have brown bananas.

I'm a "reduced fat fanatic" and these were the best I've made.  I altered the recipe slightly by using dark brown sugar instead of white and lowered the amount from 3/4 c to 1/3 c.  I also added 1 t of vanilla and 1/3 c of walnuts.  Instead of white flour, I used whole wheat pastry flour and they were great.  The whole family loves these.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were absolutely great! I just added my own personal touch in these which I think made them perfect. I omitted all but 1/4 cup sugar and used 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, used about 1/2 bag of mini chocolate chips, splash of orange extract and a scoop or two of vanilla cocoa (love the stuff!) I also made them into mini muffins. Baked them at 350 for 7.5 minutes, rotated them and baked for an additional 4. They came out so moist with the perfect mixture of fruit and chocolate flavors. Will definitely make again with the same revisions.

I find myself using this recipe all the time, although I did tweak it.  I substituted whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour and only use 1/2 cup of Splenda instead of white sugar.  Also, I use the 1/4 cup to make 12 muffins. Sometimes I will add some pecan nuts to the mix as well.

After having read the other reviews I was a little disappointed, the texture wasn't...fluffy at all, it was more like bread. They didn't really rise either, and although at first they smelled very nice like bananas, in the end they just came out sweet and had no special flavor at all. It's great though that you don't have to add any fat. I may make these again.

I thought these were really good and I will definitely be making again and again.  The only change I made in my first batch was using 1/4 cup of Egg Beaters instead of the two whites.  Next time, I may try using some wheat flower, as another reviewer suggested for a bump in the health factor.  If you are looking for something very healthy and low-fat AND very tasty - this is definitely for you!

These were really good.  They were easy to make and my kids loved them.  The only thing I would change is to omit or maybe 1/2 the amount of the chocolate chips (my kids even agreed).  They were almost too sweet.  Overall a great recipe.

This was pretty good . The lower fat makes them good to have around the house for snacks, but I wouldn't recommend as a gift or for company.

Delicious! Everyone who tried one loved them. You definitely won't miss the fat. I used white chocolate chips, one whole egg instead of two egg whites, a full teaspoon of cinnamon, and a pinch of both nutmeg and cloves. I also made these into huge muffins that rose up over the top of the pan, and ended up with 8 muffins instead of 12. I'll definitel make them again!

Great recipe!  I made a triple batch (had a lot of bananas) and tried the recipe as written first (which everyone should do before reviewing...), which gets 5 stars on its own.  The other batches I substituted nuts or coconut for the chocolate chips for variety, and they turned out great as well!  No, they don't taste like grocery store or coffee-shop muffins, but they do taste great and they're 1/4 of the fat and calories of those others.  Thanks, Angela!

These muffins are very moist and flavourful, you can't even tell they're low fat!  I used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup white, reduced the chocolate chips to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg for a spicier healthier muffin.  Total calories per muffin: 130

Muffins are a little dense and rubbery. Also extremely difficult to take out of paper liners. If I was to attempt this recipe again I will try a lower heat - like 350 - for longer and oil the pan instead of using liners.

These were great! I adapted them due to previous reviews. I used 1/2 brown sugar instead of white,  one xl whole egg, doubled the cinnamon, and added frozen blueberries instead of chocolate chips. This is a good base recipe as it adjusts well to changes.  Mine made twelve nice sized muffins and cooked perfectly at 400 for fifteen minutes.

Good, quick, easy muffins.  I like that you just mix it all together in one bowl and away you go!  I used margarine instead of applesauce because I didn't have any.  Also used whole eggs rather than the whites only.  I feel like 400° is a bit hot for them as they came out blackened where they were in contact with the muffin pan.  Still nice and moist inside though!  Next time I would add more chocolate chips and try baking them at a slightly lower temperature.

Very good! I followed other reviews and added vanilla and 2 whole eggs. My husband usually doesn’t care for my healthier recipes but he couldn’t tell with these. I also added 2 scoops of my protein powder.

These were delicious. I used a mix of chocolate and peanut butter chips because that's all I had. Also I accidentally forgot to add the sugar (...baking with a toddler makes me forgetful...) and you couldn't tell at all. They were plenty sweet without it. So if you want to cut out a few calories, they work well relying on the sweetness of the rest of the ingredients.

Great recipe.  If you use really ripe bananas and are heavy handed with chocolate chips you can omit the sugar entirely.  Lol. I forgot the sugar and they still tasted great. I will definitely make them again.

I found these muffins spongy and not very flavorful. If I was to try them again I would definitely alter the recipe with some of the suggestions written in the other reviews.

Love these! Made them with whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 cup of sugar.  Also added a dash of ground cloves and nutmeg. I left out the eggs whites by mistake (left them on the cup next to the mix!), so I had to remove the mini muffins out of the oven 2 minutes after they started to bake. The pan was slightly warm so the chips melted a little and the muffins became chocolate banana muffins with bits of chocolate. Delicious. Kids loved them and they're somewhat healthy.  I baked them for 8 minutes.

Great recipe! I ran out of butter but had applesauce- this was perfect. They came out great and my husband inhaled two of them! I made a few changes based on the reviews I read. I increased the baking power to 1 ½ tsp, increased baking soda to 1 tsp, used whole eggs, reduce the sugar to ½ cup, and used about a cup of pecans instead of chocolate chips. The muffins rose nicely and not overly sweet. I plan on making this again! I read that others had issues with it being spongy. Just a note-  Do not over mix. Over-mixing makes it spongy- When I combined the wet and dry ingredients, I stirred it together just enough to get it all moist and leave it alone. It’s so easy to over mix.

Delicious and super easy! I would imagine using really ripe bananas would make these even sweeter.  I'd reduce the baking time to 13-14 minutes.

Will be making this again for sure. Only thing I changed was using the whole egg instead of just the white, and adding a splash of milk as my batter was slightly too dry, I do live in an extremely dry climate so not sure if that was why I just needed slightly more moisture. There was just enough balance of banana, chocolate, flavour, and they were nice and moist!

I made these just as the recipe mentioned except I doubled it and didn't have enough banana so I added a little more applesauce! They were pretty dense, but delicious! I have never tried baking with applesauce, so I was very impressed!

Very good.  I didn't have any applesauce, so I used butter.  I also reduced the sugar (used brown) and added 1 tsp vanilla too, as another review suggested. I didn't have time to smash and measure the bananas, but I used two bananas (both prob about 7" or so).  Very good!

Deeelicious!  I overcooked mine just slightly due to having a hot oven but they just got a little crispy on the outside, (in a good way) but we're still soft, moist and spongie on the inside.  Just the way I like my banana muffins!

Great recipe! Was looking for a recipe that utilized applesauce and not too much sugar...this is it! I added whole eggs instead of whites and added some cocoa powder. I made two batches...one as cupcakes and the other as bread. Delicious! Will definitely make again!

Made this recipe as listed. Very good, not too dense like some muffin recipes, moist and irresistible out of the oven. Didn't measure the bananas, just used three ripe bananas. Even my brother loved them and he hates banana muffins! Made in mini muffin format as well. Those turned out great as well.

These are awesome muffins.  I didn't think they were chewy at all.  In the essence of making them slightly healthier than they already were, I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour, half light brown sugar and half white sugar, and added some nutritional yeast as well.  Cooking them slightly longer than 18 minutes made the outsides slightly crispy and the insides nice and soft (but not chewy).  This will be my go to muffin recipe from now on!!

FANTASTIC!  Took this as a snack for my son's preschool and after years of taking snacks, this is the only snack I've ever gotten a compliment on.  My son begged and begged for them.  I added vanilla and some brown sugar.

Really liked working with this recipe, but did have to add about 1/2-3/4 cup of milk (I eyeballed it).  The batter beforehand was so dry it certainly needed some moisture added to it.  They rose really well and I actually made 12 regular sized muffins and a loaf. Awesome with coffee or tea..........

Good- mods:  1 whole egg, 1 C frozen (un-defrosted) blueberries instead of chips.  A sweet muffin that rose well.  Made 6 jumbo muffins and baked at 375 for 35 mins.  Would play at reducing sugar next time.  Will use again.  Thanks!

These turned out really great. Better than I expected even. I added a teaspoon of vanilla. I couldn't really taste the banana but, it might have because mine weren't ripe enough. Overall this is a good recipe, I will make these again.

Nice flavor,  but the comment about them being chewy in the larger size is not untrue.  I will try them again in minis.

These muffins were quite good.  I did add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  Best part only 3 WW points.  A little dense but with coffee are perfect for breakfast.

Really good recipe - I used 1/2 a cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white, and I used brown sugar instead of white and they turned out great! My only complaint is they only made 10 muffins! That would be fine if they weren't so good that they got gobbled up almost immediately! I think I'll double the recipe next time...

YUM! My 2 yo daughter and I made these today and they are delish!

I didn't have any eggs so I used 1/4c egg-beaters. I also used 1/2 the amount of chocolate chips. We made 6 regular sized muffins and the rest mini muffins. Perfect snack for my daughter!

I'm working on my hot-running oven, but even so these turned out great! Perfect snack for when you wake up hungry and just want to go back to bed quick.

Wow! These came out awesome. I LOVE banana bread and chocolate so this was like heaven on earth to me! I doubled the bananas and the chocolate chips. I also added 1/4 c extra flour.

Very good muffins.  I added more cinnamon and a little less brown sugar as others did and they were very good.

I didn't care much for these.  The texture was a bit heavy and, as with lots of other lighter versions of foods I've tried, it just seemed like there was something missing.  My toddlers eat them but I think that's just because they have chocolate chips in them.

Great recipe! They didn't last long because everyone wanted them for breakfast. I substituted the chocolate chips with raisins. Yum! It was so nice to not add a lot of fat...

Excellent recipe. Used unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 c Splenda + 1/2 c white sugar. Also used 1/2 c wheat flour. Goofed and poured in 1 c chocolate chips (darn!) but they turned out great! Next time I will increase the Splenda to 1/2 c and see what happens. I will definitely make these again!

So good, I omitted the chocolate chips, mainly because I didn't have any, and I didn't measure the bananas, I just put in two of them, tastes great.

These muffins were yummy! What a great way to use up mushy bananas. I feel so good I did not waste food! LOL!! Next time I will try it as a bread. I also used mini chocolate chips. I like them better than the bigger ones when it comes to muffins and breads.

I did not think this recipe was that great. I tried making the large muffins and they were over done on the outside and rubbery. Next time I will just try the regular muffin size. The flavor was ok. Nothing to brag about.

Great recipe!! I used it as a healthy snack for my son's class and the kids just loved it. I altered the recipe by making mini-muffins with mini-chips and it came out just fine. I made a double batch and had enough to last for a week so my kids would have a healthy snack too!!

These are so good, you'll be shocked the fat is missing.  My husband, who hates it when I cook healthy, couldn't stop eating them...and I had made him his own batch of regular (fat-packed) banana muffins.  Thank you Angela!
