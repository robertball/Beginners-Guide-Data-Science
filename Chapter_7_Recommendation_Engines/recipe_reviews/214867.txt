The mango butter was good, if you like mango butter. It is more of a sauce, and I recommend whisking it together once you've reduced it. It has a sweet and salty type tang to it. I personally didn't realize how sweet it was going to be, and I didn't use much. I prefer my fish cooked with lemon and butter and/or capers. So this wasn't for me, but I encourage you to try it if you were interested enough to pull up the recipe!

The mango butter is a home run topping for fish! Even though I messed it up.  In a momentary lapse of judgement (brain fart) I used a whole stick of butter thinking it was a 1/4 cup.  As the sauce was reducing I tasted it and was surprised that the butter was so prominant.  Ooops. I ended up adding more honey and red pepper flakes and also added a little brown sugar.  The end product was just ok by itself but is HEAVENLY when eaten with the fish. Next time I'll use the correct amount of butter. Oh yah, I used tilapia since that's what was on hand. Thank you for the recipe, this is what we call a "do-againer" in our house.

This is a great recipe!  Easy to make.  The mango sauce is perfect.  I ended up putting it into a blender because it separated (butter), then just served it over the grouper. Hubby loved it too.  We even caught the grouper:) Yum!  Thanks so much!

Loved the mango salsa; I imagine it would be a great addition to any mild white fish recipe.  Definitely cut down on the olive oil - I only used a tablespoon to brush the filets before cooking.  The butter in the sauce is more than enough fat for this recipe.

BEST Grouper Recipe ever. Perfect for company,  rave reviews ,  the mango sauce has a little sweet and little spice but doesnâ€™t make flavor of the fish.

Made a few minor changes - used less olive oil in the topping,  subbed onion for shallots and chardonnay for sauvignon blanc for what I had on hand, used tilapia instead of grouper as that is what I could purchase fresh, used a mix of mango puree and chopped mango pieces, and added some green peppers cut in small pieces.  Served with white rice. Very flavorful.

This is a great recipe!   There were a few ingredients I didn't have,  so I substituted the white wine with a combination of mirin, apple cider vinegar, dry vermouth and red wine and used a little onion and garlic since I didn't have a shallot.   I reduced the amount of olive oil and used 1-2 tablespoons of brown sugar instead of honey.  Other then that, I followed the recipe and  I will definitely make this again!

Terrific recipe.  My grocery store did not have fresh grouper at the time, and I didn't want to use frozen, so I used this recipe with fresh halibut instead.  It turned out amazing!  This is now one of my favorite recipes for fish; yummy and simple.

Love this sauce! The first time I made it with grouper (just like the recipe called for). But now I use it for all my fresh seafood, as it's great on both salmon and scallops. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

You taste more butter than mango. It was good but it needed a little something... Maybe to thicken it up. I also grilled the grouper vs baking it.

This was super easy and made enough sauce that it can be used again or cut in half for only two people. We used 1 pound of grouper, portioned into two pieces and the fish took a bit longer on a electric stove for about five/six minutes on each side on 8. I also mashed the sauce with a potato masher for a smoother consitency since my husband cut the mango pieces a bit large. This is certainly a keeper!

This was very disappointing...there was way too much olive oil in the sauce. Not sure if I will make again.
