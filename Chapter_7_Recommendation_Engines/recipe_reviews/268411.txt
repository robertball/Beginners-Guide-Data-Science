This pie was lovely coming out of the oven. It set perfectly. Unfortunately, it was a waste of persimmons.. My very ripe, sweet persimmons turned into a tasteless custard. I did add extra spices because the amounts given in the recipe were negligible. I should have known better and also added honey or sugar. 
Do not waste your persimmons. If they become too ripe, add them to a smoothie.
