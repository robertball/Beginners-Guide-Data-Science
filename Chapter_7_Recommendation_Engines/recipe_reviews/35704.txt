AWESOME DILL PICKLES! First and last recipe I will use and they are crunchy!  For added zip I added in a couple slices of jalepeno peppers (with seeds) and in each jar I also added a heaping 1/8th tsp each of dried mustard seed, dill seed, and celery seed. If you like really hot and spicy pickles add in a few dashes of red pepper flakes in addition to the jalepenos.  I also believe there really is something to chilling the pickles before you start canning. The recipe states to wait 8 weeks before eating the pickles.  I was so impatient the 1st time, I sampled them after 3 days.  They were good, but the different spices had not blended and could be tasted separately.  By waiting, the flavors combine and "mellow" into a more balanced (and great!) flavor.  I waited 3 weeks before sampling another jar and they were definitely better than the ones I tried after 3 days.  Pickles can be stored for a couple of years in a cool dry place like a pantry.

These are absolutely the best pickles!  To ensure a crisp pickle be sure to cut about 1/8" off the blossom end of each cuke because enzymes located there can cause soft pickles.  I also like to chop up the garlic cloves and then just put about 1 teaspoon in each jar, rather than the whole cloves.  If I have them, I also pop a fresh dill flower in the centre each jar after the cukes are in.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful!  We make and can these every summer and always get rave reviews.  I have found that picking the cucumbers when very small results in the crunchiest pickles.  Also, you can substitute 1/3 Tbsp of dill seed for the dill head.

I found this recipe was very easy to follow and I did follow it to a tee but they still turned out pretty mushy. I made sure that I filled the ice regularly and kept the pickles really cold for just over three hours. Does anyone have any hints?

I finally opened my first jar last night and they were delicious.   I was hoping for super crispy pickles, but suspect the hot bath method might have made them a bit soggy?  It was my first attempt at canning, too, and this was a great way to be introduced. Thanks, Sharon!

These pickles are great! It was really hard for me to wait the full two months to try them but I did and it was well worth the wait. I added some alum to the ice bath and then rinsed the pickles well before placing them in jars. I was really pleased with how crunchy the pickles turned out. I also placed the jarred pickles in a hot water bath for 10 minutes to seal the jars and it worked well.

This is THE pickle recipe, no doubt about it. You can also use this recipe as the base for pickling other stuff, like green beans.  TROUBLESHOOTING YOUR PICKLES  Unfortunately, Allrecipes doesn't have a great way to search through the comments or reply to people, so useful comments get buried, so most of these topics have been covered but people are asking so I'm bringing it to the top.  Pickles too salty: this can happen if you leave the brine boiling for an extended period, boiling off water and leaving a high salt concentration.  Pickles too mushy: you may have processed the jars in the boiling water too long. Many people successfully seal the jars by boiling them upside down with water just above the lid for 5-10 minutes. A 15 minute immersion boil is to keep the lawyers happy. OR you may have used cucumbers that were too large or old. They need to be small and young--think of the size you see in the pickle section of the supermarket. Try to get the greenest, wartiest ones of the bunch. OR enzymes from the blossom end of the cucumber may be sabotaging you. Cut 1/8" off the blossom end before placing in the jars.  What's Pickling Salt? It is not the same as Pickling Spice. It is basically non-iodized salt. Kosher salt works really well. Iodized salt will make your pickles blue!  Try to use a ceramic or Teflon coated pot for the brine; contact with metal clouds vinegar solutions, and you may not be able to tell later if the cloudiness indicates spoilage.  Hope this helps!

I have used this recipe for 3 years now.   Each time they have come out crisp and delicious! When I printed the recipe long ago the recipe had a "review" from Sharon that stated she did not use a water bath, that the directions had been changed due to health regulations.  So when I make them I stick with the "original" method.  As per the original recipe, I invert the jars into boiling water (enough to cover rim) and boil for 10 minutes.  I've never had a problem with jars sealing and the pickles are crisp.  I do soak the cucumbers in VERY cold water with lots of ice for 2 hours.  I then quarter the cucumbers before putting them into the jars. I also add a bit more vinegar and water to make up for my pouring abilities since I tend to spill some of the liquid.  The first time I made these I was short on the liquid for the last jar.  These pickles are the BEST!

So far I have canned about 20 cans of pickles using this recipe!  We only let them sit about 2 weeks before my b/f HAD to taste one and my goodness they were delicious after the 2 weeks!  So crisp and tastey!  LOVED them.  I couldn't find dill heads so just used the dill sprigs and its wonderful! Sometimes after I let the brine come to a boil, I turn it back down until I get my jars packed, then turn it up and come back to a boil and fill the jars.  If you let it continue to boil, you will boil away too much liquid and end up with salty pickles.

I like the taste of these pickles but have had ongoing problems with getting them to seal and then stay sealed.  The first batch, I loaded all the jars and then poured in boiling vinegar mixture.  No jars sealed so I put them in a water bath 10 min. and they all sealed and stayed sealed for the whole year.  They were very good and still crunchy.  Tried another batch, seeing if I could get the vinegar mixture hotter, etc. and still the same results.

This year, after reading other reviews, I kept the jars hot in the dishwasher, filled them with cukes one at a time and filled one at a time with vinegar left boiling on the stove, putting each cover on right away.  They all sealed.  I was relieved.  Then, a few days later, I heard one of them pop.  I looked and all the jars were cloudy with bacteria and had unsealed.  I had been extremely careful washing, sterilizing, etc.

I would definitely recommend just biting the bullet and sealing them with a water bath.  After what happened to my latest batch without doing that, I question whether it's safe to do them without it.  I think they still stay crunch enough doing this.

This is my third season canning sharon's recipe.  20 pounds yesterday (small ones), 21 quart jars, fresh dill (grocery stores can order it for you), not the same with the dill weed or dill seed and garlic. Alway crunchy, add some fresh ground pepper to some jars, yummy.
Store in pantry, and hopefully they make it to Christmas. The do get even better the longer you let them sit. Enjoy!

I have a family recipe very similar to this for "salt dills", the only difference is reducing the vinegar in the brine to 2 cups and using a whole cup of canning salt.  I also like to drop in a couple of red chiles.  Extra hands in the kitchen also helps!  We like to make chips & britneys (spears), and open the chips after a week.  Divine!  Aunt Bea would be jealous!

Everyone is correct- best dill pickle recipe ever.  I've been using Sumner variety cukes and they are perfect with this recipe.  A large picnic cooler works well for icing the cukes as it holds the cold for a long time.  I sampled the pickles after 4 hours and they were sensational!  I place a batch of wide mouth quart jars in the oven for about a half hour before canning, then take one out at a time as need it. Tops and lids go into boiling water though.  Every person who's sampled these pickles has asked me for the recipe.  Thanks Sharon.

NEED TO KNOW... a lot of recipes for canning pickles often leave out this important tip.  If you don't want mushy pickles, you need to trim 1/4 off each end of the cucumbers.  The end connecting to the vine has an enzyme that makes mushy pickles.  Frustrates me when I see recipes leave this off, because its hard work..you want good pickles!

I used this recipe last year and made 100 pounds of pickles. They all turned out perfect! My Dad said they were the best pickles he'd ever had and he was raised on a farm!! My 3 teenage boys and their friends ate them all within two months once they were ready. I did a lot of research on canning pickles. I used Sharon's original recipe and did not process them in a canner. I inverted them in a shallow pan of boiling water (just covering the rim) for 7 minutes. Every single jar sealed. This is how my Grandmother processed her pickles. I mixed things up and did some spicy, some garlic and others with a lot of different spices. I think the most important thing I came across when I was reading the entire internet was to use only good cuks...no spots and cut off the blossom tail. It makes the pickles mushy. My garlic also turned blue at first...then they looked normal. I'm going to do 150 pounds this year. Hopefully they'll last longer!!!

This is an excellent version of a tried & true garlic dill pickle recipe. I have a couple of additional tips with respect to ensuring your pickles turn out crunchy.  Well water (unsoftened, non-chlorinated - e.g., no city water), especially if mineral rich (think: rust in the tub) is excellent for guaranteeing crunch.  Another great trick is to put a grape leaf in the bottom of the jar with some of your dill.  These tips I got from my great grandmother. A rule of thumb at my house: We open our first jar at the Thanksgiving dinner table - it's much longer than the minimum cure time of 8 weeks, but they are that much better by then, or hotter if you've added pepper for heat.

I tried making them as the recipe was written but processed them in the canner for 7 minutes.  The flavor was great, but they were very soft.  So, today, I retried them and made some changes.  I spoke to a woman who has canned for probably 50 years and she told me both her and her daughter put grape leaves in the jars.  Her daughter processes them in a canner, but she does not. She doesn't refrigerate them during storage.  She said - they're pickles, right?  Makes sense since that's how they are made in big pickle barrels.  Grape leaves (any kind) have something in them that breaks down the enzyme that makes pickles soft.    I also read many places on the internet to cut off the blossom end really well and cut or scrape off any remaining blossom stub.  This supposedly is the source for the enzyme that makes the pickles soft......4 months later, I have been using a batch that I didn't water bath.  They are AWESOME! and haven't had problems with them spoiling.  DON'T water bath them.  Turn jars upside down if you have problem getting them to seal.

I have just found this recipe again.  YEA!  My daughter and I canned these pickles last fall and my family has requested them for next season.   They want us to make as many as possible.  Comments are "they are better than any brand that I have purchased."  A beginner could have success with this 5 STAR RECIPE!  MAY I GIVE THIS YEARS REVIEW.  THEY NEVER FAIL.  I BOUGHT A 1/2 A BUSHEL OF CUCS FROM THE LOCAL FARMERS MARKET AND I MADE 20 QTS.  THEY TURNED OUT SOOOO CRISPY.  IT HAS TO BE THE ICE COLD CUCS THAT DO IT.  I AM TEMPTED TO ORDER MORE CUCS.  THEY WILL GO FAST.  I HOT WATER BATH FOR 5 MINS AND ALL SEALED WITHOUT SOGGINESS TO THE PICKLES.  "I" NEED TO DO THIS TO INSURE A GOOD SEAL. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE PERFECT PICKLE!!!!!

HEAVEN - I AM IN DILL PICKLE HEAVEN!!!!!!  Oh My Word - these truly ARE the BEST Dill Pickles that have ever crossed my lips. They're crispy, they're crunchy, a delcious delicacy & everything anyone could want in a perfect Dill Pickle. Definitely better than any store-bought. OK - so  cheated & snuck a taste 2 days after they were canned & stuck that jar in the refrig to snack on. Got worried cause I cut the salt back to about 1/2  {per a reviewers comments about being a bit to salty} and then read sometimes that too little salt can make your pickles mushy. They are perfect!  Plan to leave the rest alone until they've had time to develop their full-bodied flavor. Yummm - NOW I want to run & make MORE! They're so good unable to imagine going through the winter without being fully stocked! Thank You Sharon for this WONDERFUL RECIPE. Brings back memories of my favorite aunts dill pickles I always loved. Unfortunately she never shared hre recipe with me.  FORTUNATELY for everyone -  YOU DID! Thank You, Thank You, Thank YOU!

I just made 2 1/2 batches of these pickles yesterday.   In place of dill heads, I used 1 tsp of dill seed (upon reading other recommendations).  8 hours later we were just dying to try them out.  They are REALLY good and crispy!  Can't wait to eat them in 8 weeks!!  YUM!!  Made spears, whole dills, baby dills, and sandwich stackers.

I still haven't tasted them since I did it a couple of weekends ago.  I did about 45 jars and everyone sealed.  I used the wide mouth jars and didn't have any issue with them sealing.  I also make fresh tomato sauce and don't have problems canning those, so I thought I would share what I do.  -I filled the pickles in the jar with the rest of the spices & garlic.  I jammed it as much as possible.   -I put the thin lids in boiling water when the brine was close to a boil.   -Once the brine came to a boil my wife filled the jar I made sure there was nothing on the rim of the jar, if there was I used a paper towel to wipe clean. Immediately after I took a thin lid out of the boiling water and put it on and then used the spin cap and tightened it as much as possible and turned the jar upside down.  -Once I finished all the jars, I laid a blanket over the jars to keep them worm longer.  After about 12 hours, I returned them to the case not upside down anymore.  This is how I can my tomato sauce too.  I have been doing that for 3 years and never had a problem with anything not sealing properly.  I will write a review when I actually taste the pickles...I have high hopes.

Best pickle recipe ever. I think the dill heads (seeded dill) is best, but in a pinch baby dill + a dash of dill seeds will do. Hope I don't get in trouble for this comment but, I have noticed a lot of "mushy pickle results" lately. My suggetion is to "cold can". A hot water bath is what the FDA insists be required for food safety, but a responsible canner or one that can use a computer to find out how to cold can might want to use. That is what the author's original recipe stated. That and the cold water ice bath are the key to a scrumptious pickle. My neices and nephews ask for them every summer. What more could you ask for in recipe? The only thing I wish to add for all those who wish to not be 100% purist is to half the white vinegar w/rice wine vinegar. It is in the vinegar isle of the grocery store and it usually Japanese. The flavor is a little bit smoother, but still has that garlic bite. Love it. Give it try and please comment. This is what my family LOVES!

I am very very pleased with this recipe. It was easy enough to make every other day as I picked buckets from my garden. Plus, after exhausted research, this is the first dill pickle recipe I've ever made that turned out actually appealing. I did some tweaking though. I soaked in ice water, then cut about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch off the blossom ends. I had a various assortment of cucumber sizes to work with so some jars were made with whole cucumbers, some were made with halves, or quarters of the larger cucumbers. What I found out, is that the skin causes the crunch...so the more skin, the crunchier they are. So, my whole pickles are crunchier than my quarters, but for our family, the halves are perfect. Crunch but easy to eat. I seasoned as the recipe called for and water bathed them for only 6-8 minutes instead of 15. All my jars sealed and I figure a little water bathing is safer than none. Plus, to my delight, after waiting only 2-3 weeks my pickles were wonderfully seasoned and nice and crunchy. My husband, a huge fan of the Clausen Brand refrigerated Kosher Dill Pickles, was thoroughly pleased with their flavor and crispness. He actually rated them BETTER than Clausens and the best pickle he's ever had! It's a clean tasting pickle with no funny aftertaste.  Thanks a bunch to the submitter! I'll never use another Dill pickle recipe.

I just made these and my family sampled one jar due to it not sealing.  These were great even after one day!  I had so much fun canning that I'm going to go out and get more jars!  BTW-just make sure that your brine doesn't boil down.  Your pickles will be too salty if/when that happens.

great recipe, and the top reviews really make it shine. To have crisper pickles, use LOTS of ice and keep replenishing, but ALSO weigh the pickles down in the sink with something heavy. this will ensure that they don't float, which is a big cause of soft pickles since they don't benefit from the cold bath as much.

Can someone tell me what the original recipe was?  These were great, but if they were EVEN BETTER before....I just don't know how to do it without a hot water bath.

To all those who did not process your jars in the hot water bath and the jars came unsealed. The purpose for the hot water bath is to seal the jars. The rubber gasket in the lid has to get really hot before it can form a seal on the rim of the jar. As the jar cools the air inside the jar compresses and pulls the lid tight thereby forming a seal.

Fantastic recipe for those who may be a bit nervous about canning. I soaked in bucket w/ a ice container in the middle, topped with water and sat in fridge for about 4 hours. I just made 20 qts of whole & spears, and 14 qts of sliced. I stuffed the garlic, dill, peppers of choice, and mustard seed, added cukes, topped with the dill again & a grape leaf. Poured boiling vinegar/water/salt solution into jars, sealed with the lid & ring that had been preparing in hot (not boiling) water, and inverted onto a towel on the table. We did the process outside on the campstove burner, therefore left the jars outside all night upside down. In the morning, all jars had sealed and I couldn't stand it either, I only waited 2 days before sampling! OMG! My excuse was that I didn't want to store all those jars if they were going to be yucky-lol!  They are wonderful, crisp, dilly, and so I hid the open jar in the back of the fridge to continue melding the flavors. Plus to hide from hubby, haha! Great recipe, I will share with many others.

Oven?  I didn't read any direction that said use the oven.  These are excellent!!  My garden is producing 2 foot long cukes (no kidding) and what a better way to use them up!!  I added peppercorns to the jars before sealing. Of course being as impatient as I am, I opened one after 2 weeks, and they are delicious and crispy. I have also used this recipe for pickled cauliflower and received rave reviews!!  Thanks so much Sharon 10 stars!!

I have never attempted pickle making before. I tried this recipe and have been waiting to open a jar. I thought you had to wait 8 weeks to try them.  But I recently read that someone ate them 2 days later!  Did I do something wrong or read the recipe wrong?  Or are you supposed to eat them WITHIN 8 weeks?  If someone can tell me, I would appreciate it.  Thanks.

First, this is great recipe. I've been using it a couple of years and have never had a jar go bad or taste bad. In reading some of the reviews I see people complaining about soft pickles.
So, I wanted to point out a couple items. (These items are also listed in older reviews.)

1. You need to use pickling cucumbers. The ones you buy in a grocery store ARE NOT pickling cucumbers. Go to a farmers market and order you cucumbers.
2. Also cut off 1/8" of the blossom end of the cucumber. The enzymes located there can cause soft pickles. You can leave a short piece of vine at the other end. Do this even if you are quartering the cucumbers.
3. The hot bath / processing time is way to long. (Required by lawyers:) Read through some of the older reviews about processing times.
4. Use only pickling salt. Period!

Again this is a great recipe. I add additional items to mine to my own taste. But make this recipe once (you'll love them), then adjust to get your own "specialty pickles"!

August 2009-I made these again, this time I made 7 quarts. After filling jars with garlic dill and cucumbers I mixed the brine solution in a large bowl and dipped in a large measuring cup, put this in the microwave till boiling and filled one jar, lidded and ringed it then inverted on a towel. I did this for each of the 7 quart jars. Every one sealed the same night. No metal pan and brine is always at a full boil. July 2009 I made these two days ago using cold canning method. I added 3/4 tsps. per pint of Pickle Crisp by Ball(box says it is calcium chloride and will improve crispness of pickles). 2 of 7 pints sealed immediately. I removed the rings and lids from the other 5 and one by one I nuked each pint for 3 minutes on high. Wiped the rims,replaced the lids and rings and inverted. Several hours later I checked them and all had sealed. The next evening I checked them all again and 1 had unsealed. Surprisingly it was one of the original two that had sealed so quickly. So I had to taste them and even after only 48 hours I was amazed at how crispy and delicious they were. WOW! I am keeping an eye on the others before I put them into storage because another reviewer said two weeks after canning she had a bunch of jars come unsealed. I am impressed with the ease of this canning method but even more so by the taste. It will be interesting to taste them over the weeks as they continue to develop. I can't wait until I can get to the next farmer's market to buy more cucumbers and I

Yum!  These are super easy!  If you're cutting the cucumbers into spears I'd recommend cutting and then soaking in ice water.  Also, I ran out of dill heads.  1 teaspoon of dill seed is equal to one dill head.  It's not as pretty but tastes as good!  My kitchen is small and hard to maneuver around with everything so I ended up bringing the brine to a boil and then taking it off the heat while I packed the jars with the cucumbers.  My pickles are still quite crunchy.  I also am paranoid so I did do a quick water bath to seal but didn't keep them in more than five minutes and they're still crunchy.  Thanks for a great recipe!  It's a keeper!

WOW!!! These are the best pickles I have ever had. I can't stop eating them. They are super easy to make. The hardest part is waiting a few months to eat them, but boy are they worth it! So crunchy and yummy!
Thanks for the advice from other users about the water bath. The first batch I made I did process them in a water bath for 5 minutes and they were fine. With the second I just followed the directions with hot canning supplies and boiling brine and skipped the water bath - they sealed just fine.
I also made spears and chips. The spears were really crunchy and the chips were a little less crunchy, but still fantastic. My mom actually prefers the chips. :)
Thanks for a FANTASTIC recipe. I'll be making these every year with our huge crop of cucumbers from our garden!

Turned out great! Except when canning them you don't need the 20 minute bath. If you have a mason jar then just keep them in the boiling water (lids included) until your brine is ready. Then take out the jars, fill them accordingly and seal it with the hot lid. This will seal them without the extra time in the boiling water!

WARNING**DO NOT USE WIDE MOUTH JARS**Checking the jars after 3 weeks, I found 5 WM Pints had unsealed! I think it's due to the wider lids. Will use reg.jars next time.** Made these when Sharon first posted the original recipe and they were PERFECT! Lost the recipe, came back and found it changed. Made them again the processed way and they were tasty but MUSHY! (Husband still loved them...yakkk) Checked back again to see everyone else with the same complaint, wanting the "original" recipe. Read all the reviews and tried again today, using the cold pack process. Using wide mouth PINT jars while majority are using Qts. Wonder that and if packing loose or tight is a factor in sealing? Also, came back from a trail ride yesterday with vines of grape leaves tied to my saddle. Will add them to but not sure just how many/what sizes leaves to put in jar. Tons of fresh dill at peak in the garden along with fresh cukes. Garlic will be minced & fresh ground pepper added. So off to slice and ice... Aug.23, 2009 - UPDATE from 8-12-09 Post...Pickles were excellent! THE BEST but........all the wide mouth pint jars did not seal :( So I took the advice to fill a skillet with water, bring to a boil and place the jars in, up-side down so the water covered the metal parts and boiled for 5 minutes. Remove

These are so easy to make. I didn't see a yield anywhere on the amount of liquid, but it was enough for 6 quarts of pickles. Had some extra, not sure if it would have done 7 or not, but I ran out of small cucumbers.   I turned the jars upside down for about 10 minutes right after I canned them, and they sealed perfectly.  Just make sure the ring is on toght!

This was a lot easier than I thought it would be!  I followed all the instructions, except I used dried dill weed (1 T. per 1 quart jar) and added 1/4 c. of sugar to the brine.  I also did the boiling water bath, since I want them to last for a long time. I opened a jar today and they are SO delicious and CRISPY!  Great Recipe! :)

These pickles were great.  I tried them after three weeks and they were just as good if not better than store bought dill pickles.  I followed some of the reviews.  I soaked my pickles in ice cold water for about seven hours, which helped them maintain there crunchyness.  I also added a little more garlic and dill than the recipe called for.  In addition I did not use the traditional canning technique because I had read that by giving the canned pickles a water bath they would come out soft.  Instead I stored the pickles in the refrigerator.  In the past I have stored pickles in the refrigerator for months and I have never had a problem with them spoiling.  What I really liked about these pickles is that I know what my family is eating.  There are no perservatives or additives just natural ingredients.  I will make these pickels again.

THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE!  We grow a lot of cukes in our garden and I tried this recipe last year.  Ended up having to do another batch.  I think we ended up with 16 large jars of pickles.  They are so crispy and delicious.  I experimented a little and added some fresh jalapenos from our garden to a few jars and they, too, were awesome.  In fact, my brother ate the jalepenos that we added to the pickles and suggested we try pickling jalapenos so we'll be doing that this year.  THIS IS A KEEPER!

These are great. I actually made these a couple of days ago. I used mini seedless cucumbers and sliced some lengthwise and some in circles. I couldn't find fresh dill head so I only put the fresh sprigs in. I did add onion slices to the jar as well. Instead of doing the water bath, I inverted the jars and put a towel over them. The next morning all the jars had sealed except two. Those I put in the refrigerator and tried out today. They were delish after only a day or so! I can't wait for the others I put in the pantry. This is so easy to do for a first timer!

My first pickles!!  This was about as easy as it gets.  I used an ice chest to soak pickles.  Works great and keeps the ice for a long time.  I added a couple of big chunks of ice with my cubes.

I put up 4 jars of pickle spears and a jar of green beans this past weekend, using this recipe. I'm putting up 4 more lbs. of cukes and another 2lbs. of green beans today. We are waiting another week to try the pickles, but the green beans are FABULOUS, crispy and flavorful. I kept everything iced for about 6 hours, so don't know if that made a difference or not. The brine is a perfect balance of salty-sour. For 1 pint jar of green beans, I added a 1/4 tsp of pickling spice, 1/8 tsp crushed red chile (HINT: get packs of this when you order pizza, that way you always have fresh crushed chile on hand - It seems to me that chile looses its flavor quickly once you open it's container), three sliced cloves of garlic, 2 sprigs of fresh dill and 1/2 tsp dill seed.  I kept the brine at a simmer and pulled the jars from hot water just berfore filling, and every thing sealed just fine.

Just made 27 jars and these pickles are amazing.  I experimented with a teaspoon of hot crushed peppers in some jars, and a sliced jalapeno in other jars.  Both added a "zing" and tasted fantastic!  Tried them just after two weeks - seemed ready!

Great recipe.To keep the pickles firm,add a grape leaf,or 2to3 green grapes to each jar,the grape leaf is the best. I have had pickles for 3 years without getting mushy.

I followed the recipe but didn't process the pickles. They all sealed and two weeks later all the lids are unsealing and the pickles are spoiling.  I am so upset... they so good that I made two batches and I have had to throw away 10 quarts of pickles. I will try again but will follow the instructions to process them.

Ok, a little help here please... I'm not really willing to go off of everyone's anecdotal evidence that I probably won't get botulism and die if I don't follow the USDA recommended canning method, because it is JUST anecdotal evidence, and the USDA put that step in because just enough people got sick to make them think twice about it.  So I inverted the jars and filled the pot with enough water to go about halfway up the jars, boiled it for 15 minutes.  Now what?  Do I leave them inverted until they cool?  Do I flip them right side up?  Do I stick them in the fridge?  When I took them out of the pot of water, they started fizzling; I'm not sure if air was coming out or going in.  The bottom of the package that the jars came in said don't boil the lids & leave them rightside up after filling, and don't continue to tighten the bands after the initial tightening.  I'm reading the exact opposite on all three points on this website.  Yeah, I want crisp pickles, but I more want to make sure they seal, which they don't seem to be doing.  How do I ensure that they seal?  This is my first attempt at canning, so any advice is very much appreciated.  They smell & look awesome, though; I put cauliflower, cucumber & green beans in each jar.  I can't wait to try them; I just hope I don't have to eat them all in the next three days if they don't seal!

I didn't know the difference between a dill head and a dill sprig, so I just bought a bunch of dill sprigs and stuffed them in the jars.  I added banana peppers and red pepper flakes to some of the jars.  I used kosher salt because I couldn't find pickling.  Also, I didn't do the final sterilizing step.  I opened the first jar just two weeks after I made the recipe and they were, according to my partner, very good.  I'm not big on pickles, but he ate the whole jar within a few days, which I take as a sign that they're pretty delish!

I just opened the first jar. These are absolutely the best dill pickles I have ever eaten. There is only one problem--I didn't make enough! They disappear in a flash! I'm headed to the farmers' market for more cucumbers while there is still time. Thanks for this perfect recipe.

This is a delicious recipe! If you don't do the boiling water bath (which I don't do) make sure you keep the pickels in the fridge. Otherwise they will spoil quickly. As for spears, yes they work very well. I always buy giant cumumbers to use and cut them in half and then in spears.

I agree with Sharon, skip the hot water bath; for crispier pickles they should cure under refrigeration.  I'm going to try adding some peppercorns to each of the 8 jars for more kick!

These had great flavor, but were not crispy AT ALL.  I definitely soaked the cucumbers in the ice water just like it said, but I think water-bathing them for as long as the recipe says is way too long.  I may use this recipe again, but I will water bath for a much shorter time.  I am going to have to throw the whole batch out because no one will eat them. :(

These pickles are delicious, and I'm not a big fan of dill pickles.  Rather than soaking the pickles in ice water, I used 1 cup of pickling lime (but it at Walmart at the end of the season) and 2 gallons of cold water.  Let them soak in a 5 gallon food grade bucket for 12 - 24 hours, then rinse them very well.  The cucumbers are very crisp and you haven't tied up your sink, or tub, for hours.  I also added a teaspoon of celery seed to the brine.  My husband couldn't wait the full eight weeks, so he opened a jar after they had been canned for two days.  He thinks they're awesome.  Thanks for sharing, Sharon.

We got a deal on a crate of pickling cucumbers and huge bags of fresh dill and garlic.  We canned 48 quart jars and a few as refrigerator pickles.  This recipe is perfect - only change was we added a couple of hot peppers to each jar.  One thing to remember it to cut a slice off the blossom ends so pickles stay crisp.  Enzymes in this part of the cuke causes softness over time.  Simple and straightforward recipe - if you never canned pickles before then this is a great place to start.

Fantastic! I skimped on the garlic because I thought that 2 cloves per jar would be too much. Now I regret it. My pickles turned out with a good bit of garlic taste just not as much as I like. But I sure can't fault the recipe for that! I'll be making these pickles every summer now. Maybe mincing the garlic up instead of halving the cloves.  Thanks much. My friends won't stop hounding me for pickles!

ALSO! If you add a single sliced jalapeno with seeds per jar you wind up with the BEST spicy dill pickles I've ever had in my life! Unbelievable! I'll never change this recipe!

Always my ONLY recipe to use when canning - I use the ice bath for 6 Hours when I can, but even just 2 hrs makes 100% difference with regards to crispness.   I put 1/4 tsp of mustard seed and 1/2 a Jalapeno in each jar also (these will get spicier the longer they are stored :)   Like most here my water bath time is way shorter -- usually about 8 minutes for me :) ... 95% usually seal by the next morning (and I hear that lovely pop in about half of the jars within the first hour, even ! ) Any that do not seal by morning, go right in the Fridge as Refrigerator pickles, which are the only true way to get that Claussen crisp -- however this canned recipe with the short water bath are the crispiest I've ever had, next to refrigerator pickles!!

We have been trying to get back to our original pickle recipe and have tried many in that process. These are definitely the best we have made in a very long time. We added grape leaves, some hot pepper, and mustard seed to some of the jars. Fabulous.

This recipe is the best. Its the second time we've pickled using it. We did 79 quarts out of 2 bushels of pickling cukes. Its hard having to wait a couple months to try them again. We did some with 4 cloves of garlic, crushed the cloves, dill , and a few with some jalepeno slices. We used the ice in a cooler to store and wash the cukes as we went along. Keeping them on ice is the trick.

These pickles are wonderful!  I did not feel the liquid would be hot enough to seal the jars, so I microwaved each jar for 2 minutes then I cleaned the rim and put the lid and ring on.  I left the jars upside down until they were cool....All my jars sealed.  It was not bad adding this extra step.  I did not want to process them.  Each jar microwaved while I prepared the next jar.

I sligthly bungled this recipe on my first time making pickles-- (used pint jars instead of quarts and still processed the 15 minutes, and my pickling cukes were on the ripe side) They still turned out reasonably good!  They are fairly crisp and the taste is great. These things I think helped: I cut off the blossom end completely (1/4 inch or more) and scrubbed each one very well with terry cloth wash cloth.  Also, I kept my jars hot in a 250 degree oven.  They had a 5 hour bath in a scrubbed cooler with two bags of commercial ice and a gallon or so of water.  They were COLD!  I think with them being that cold, you need to hot water bathe them a bit because they cold cukes will cool down your hot brine a bit too much to get a good seal.  Checked with my very experienced neighbor...she swears by a 5 minute very strong boiling bath (starting with time they reach a boil again after putting them in).  Her pickles are always crunchy and she has never made anyone sick! Good luck and try to buy local!

This is the first time I have ever made pickles, and I looked at a ton of recipes before I chose this one.  I followed the recipe exactly in terms of water/vinegar/salt, but "doctored" up some of the jars with extra garlic, some onions, some with jalapenos, a couple with a red chili pepper, and some just as the recipe called for.  I entered a pint of them in our local county fair on a whim, thinking no way would a first attempt win anything.  I won first!   :)  Great recipe that I will use again next year.

This recipe is so delicious!!! This is my first time making dill pickles and I could not wait for 8 weeks either, after about 3 days we tasted them and they are delicious. I do suggest you read the other comments.  I chopped the garlic and substituted the head of dill weed for dill seed.  Turned out wonderful.

My Mother used to love tiny whole dill pickles and we often made several jars of those from her recipe. We never used the water bath and as long as the jar stays sealed the pickles will keep on the shelf. Be sure to leave enough "head space" so that the jar has room to seal. One thing that we found is using water that doesn't have chlorine helps keep the pickles crisp....so if you know someone on well water beg a few gallons from her.  My Grandchildren always look forward to a day of canning pickles and we do the cucumber washing outdoors so they can splash as much as they like.:) They pack their own jars and add garlic to their taste and label with the name of the one who packed that jar.

I just opened a jar of these after waiting 8 weeks. They are very very good. Really crunchy & not too salty like some of the store bought brands. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I made them exactly to recipe. Next year I might add some hot pepper flakes.

I did four quarts Aug. 14 (10 days ago),and this morning I noticed one of the seals was popped up. I put the other three in the refrigerator, but I do not know if they will be safe to eat since one has lost its seal. Does anyone know if these will be safe in the refrigerator? I have checked every day and hope if kept in the frig, the other three will be safe to eat. I noticed some air bubbles when I moved them. Is this an indicator that they, too, will go bad? I have not tasted them yet, but I had to put a rating to post this...

These are SO good! I soaked my cukes in a cooler with ice and a bit of alum for about 5 hours.  I also cut them in spears.  I did not put them in a hot water bath... I packed my pickles in hot jars and put hot brine over them and used hot lids after adjusting the 2 peice lids I turned them upside down for 24 hours, every jar sealed. I couldnt wait the full 8 weeks I had to try one after only 24 hours... they were so good already!! nice and crunchy!  I will be making these again!!!

This is the best pickle recipe ever.  The key to fantastic pickles are to buy them small and chill them on ice for 4+ hours (I prefer 6 or 8).  Everyone loves these pickles and I can never make enough!

Thank you, Sharon, for giving readers the detailed process. I needed the information about how to pack the jars. I have been experimenting with ways to increase the crispness. I'm curious about the updated USDA requirement of the water bath.  (My grandmother did not do that for pickles).  The only additional tip I would add, and it may not be critical, is to run a plastic knife or spatula around the filled jar to remove air bubbles before the canning.  (Only repeated instructions I've been given).  Do we know if this is necessary?

I have had to buy extra boxes of Ball jars to keep up with family and friends requests for these bad boys!

If you boil the garlic with the solution, the garlic wont turn that icky green color.

After filling the jars with the water/salt/vinegar, flip them upside immediately and let them seal. If the top does not move at all when pressed, it sealed. I always refrigerate them, and start eating them after 1-2 days...they never last a month.

Sharon you are my our pickle hero!

This is the recipe my grandmother has handed down in our family, without the water bath step.  Our pickles are always crunchy.   The one difference is we add a clove or two of garlic to make garlic dill pickles.  It's a great and easy recipe.

These are the best dill pickles I have ever made! Can't wait to make them again! EXCELLENT! Soaking the cukes in ice water for at least 2 hours makes sure they are super crunchy when you open the jar . . . even a year later!

This is definatly a keeper recipe... I have never canned before, and it was easy (except I thought the lids sealed instantly, and had to get advice from my mother LOL) We broke into first jar in 1 week and they tasted great!!!! I will definatly have more cuke in the garden next year so I can make a ton more... I did use dill seed for the bottom of jar then topped with fresh dill weed...

Thank you, thank you, thank you.  This is finally like the pickles that my grandmother used to make. The brine mixture is the same. I couldn't wait to taste so I sampled some at 1 wk. Excellent!! I did cold pack method, which has worked for me in the past. Just made sure my jars, lids and brine were hot when packing. Agree with another poster that small pickles are crunchier. Thanks again.

These were soooooo FABULOUS!  I'm so excited that we've finally come to the point where we can eat them!  Thank you for sharing!  Mine were nice and crisp!  I did add some alum as suggested to help with that.  We have just thrown out any other pickles in our fridge... we won't be going back!

These were my maiden attempt at pickles, and I cannot wait until next year to make more.  Despite being processed, they are still crunchy and flavorful, and beat any store-bought pickle hands down.  I did use pint jars instead of quarts, as I halved the recipe, and added the following to each jar:  2 dill heads (not sure what the difference is between sprigs and heads), 2 cloves of garlic each cut into quarters, 2 allspice berries, and a heaping 1/8 tsp of a mixture of dill seed, celery seed and mustard seed (thanks to another reviewer for the last item).  I also used the smallest cukes I could find so they wouldn't be super seedy, and I cut both ends off to avoid the enzymatic effect from the blossom end.  Finally, I only processed for 5 minutes.  I know that is not recommended, but I was terrified they would be mushy.  I didn't have any grape leaves to add, so figured if they didn't seal I could always put them in the fridge.  Happily, they did seal after being inverted for a few hours, and are still looking beautiful 6 weeks later with no spoilage and great taste.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

I have tried a variety of pickle recipes and this is by far our favorite.  The ice bath is critical. We add hot peppers and a rolled up grape leaf or two to each jar.  Those additions are how I learned to make them in Israel. Everyone who tastes these, gives them rave reviews.

Fantastic pickles!  Very easy.  The kids LOVE these pickles!  I've made 2 batches so far with cukes from our garden (4lb 1st batch, 5lb 2nd batch).  I soaked the cucumbers for 4 hrs. each time.  I used 1 tsp. dill seed in each qt. jar in place of dill heads, and I added 1-1/2 tbsp pickling spice to the brine.  I did not use the hot water bath and my jars sealed just fine.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's a keeper!

Excellent! I to decided to go to the hot water bath to be on the safe side last year... I regretted it. Pickles were not soggy, but not crunchy either. After talking to some of my canning veteran friends, this year I am going to skip it!

These pickles are VERY good but mine turned out soggy!  I soaked them in ice water (in a cooler with ice packed around them) I made the brine, packed in spears in hot jars.  After I packed them I boiled the packed jars upside down in boiling water in pan for 5 mins instead of the hot bath like everyone recommended but they did not seal.  I ended up doing the hot water bath anyway b/c some did not seal.  Also my garlic turned blue?  What am I doing wrong?  I also didn't know you can get the flats of the lids wet?  I always thought they had to be dry.  Any help would be appreicated!!

We just finished our last jar of these wonderful pickles. I made several batches last summer and my friends and family all loved them. Just like the ones my grandma used to make! Thanks for sharing what will now be a staple in our household!

I sliced my cucumbers and they were still crunchy.  i only made one batch from my garden last year and my family ate them so fast I couldn't tell you if they last two years.  I will make more this year. I hope I have a great crop of cucumbers so I can make lots of pickles

I do not have any canning jars so I cleaned off a huge jar with anti-microbial dish soap and ran extremely hot water on it for 10 minutes. I packed the jar with the pickles and spices and filled them with the brine...then I refrigerated it. Could not resist the temptation and tried the pickles after 24 hours...  Three days later, 7 pounds of pickles are gone and I'm making more today!

My family has made a similar recipie to this one for generations. However, we add a small yellow chilli pepper to the jar and also use cold canning process even with the brine. (It is important to use NON idodized salt, and no metal during the process to prevent clouding.) Once the jars are filled, they are then inverted on the counter to keep air out and put on a towel to catch any leaks as they begin to ferment. Every day they were tightened until they finally sealed. The salt and vinegar, are the preservatives - not heat.

Additionally, we like to can them whole but to serve them cut into thick slices marinated for a few hours in the pickle juice with fresh cucumbers and white onion with just a touch of black pepper to extend the servings in a jar. Makes a nice mix between fresh and the crunchy delicacy of these dilly delights! 

In my family, Granny rewarded us for doing chores, by getting a glass of pickle juice - that is how integral to our family this recipe was! ;)

I used cider vinegar instead of the white since I like the fruity flavor better.  I also used the red pepper flakes to give it a little kick and used minced garlic instead of the cloves.  Works great with green beans, too - even the ice water bath.  My son says they're excellent!

mmmmmm these turned out SO yummy.  I had a dickens of a time finding "heads of dill" though so I bought the baby dill and also added 1/4 tsp dried dill seeds to each jar.  I also cold canned them and didn't have any that "unsealed".  The trick I use is to invert them for an hour or so.  That way the rubber seal on the lid gets good and hot and the jars seal better.

I was waiting for these to cure before posting my review.  Made these back in August - they are fabulous.  I'd almost given up on homemade dill pickles, because I never liked how they turned out. These pickles are crisp and tasty.  Can't wait for next summer so I can put up a lot more!

This was a wonderful recipe. Cut down the recipe for the amount of cucumbers that I had and it turned out wonderful.  I only made 2 Qts. and could not wait and they were all eaten in 2 days.  Now I have to make lots more to fill the need...

Excellent recipe. I used however for pickled Turnips. I skiped the soaking for a crisp pickle especially with turnips. Also for turnips, if you want to try it, add few slices of Beets on top before sealing. This will add a pink color to the white turnips. Very tasty. Goes good with Greek Salads and Hummus.

This is a knock-your-socks-off dill pickle recipe. I couldn't find the dill heads, just sprigs. But we made it last summer with the cukes from my 6 year old's garden. We ate a couple jars after 8 weeks, but then forgot about the other jars in the pantry until this summer. WOOH!!! When we at them this summer they were fantastic! Very strong flavour that everyone loved. We're making a lot more this year to accomodate all the requests!

these are great and the exact same recipe my mother in law uses, but with differences:  we use table salt instead of pickling salt we never process them because the pickles go soft and mushy the cukes are soaked over night and then scrubbed before being put into the jars with a small jalapeno pepper and small garden pepper for colour and really a fight for the kids when they are opened:-) they always seal up because after you close the jar flip it upside down and it ensures it will seal, but only if it is at a rolling boil for at least 3 minutes!   happy canning!

Just opened a jar I made after waiting only a month. Pickles are crisp and yummy. I used pickles that were picked less than 24 hours and refrigerated overnight then I iced them for 3 hours, cut the cucumbers into chunky cubes to shorten the wait time. This is the perfect recipe.

My first attempt at making pickes, and they turned out GREAT!  Crunchy and dilly, just what I wanted.  I think the key to getting them crunchy is to bring the water up to a simmer when canning them, not a full rolling boil.  Then the jars still seal, but the pickes don't turn into a pile of mush.  I am saving this recipe to make again and again.

Ours weren't as crunchy as we'd hoped but that's probably because we didn't use a special type of cucumber. We had a bountiful harvest this year and used the excess for this recipe. We were already opening the jars after 2 weeks and they were fabulous. We had many jars to play around with; adding onions & red pepper flakes. Good stuff. We (including our 2 year old) even ate the pickled onions & garlic straight from the jars.
(BTW, the smaller your cucumbers are, the crunchier they will be.)

Great recipe! I doubt I will ever buy store bought pickles again.  These are much better. Sampled two jars so far and they keep getting better.   I grew pickling cucumbers this year and luckily found this recipe.  I chilled the cucumbers overnight in the fridge since I had a crunchier variety to begin with.  They turned out great.  I followed the recipe and a bit of advice of the others by adding a dash of  mustard seed and celery seed to each jar.  Also, used dill sprigs and a teaspoon of dill seed as dill heads were nowhere to be found. We like the whole pickles best but did some spears.  All the jars sealed (short water bath) but two. Lots of crunch and love the flavor. Easier than I thought it would be. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

i have made 3 batches so far. i have sampled 2, and my goodness.....i am proud of myself! i have never made pickles. this year i have them coming out my ears, these are better than store bought. i have tweeked each batch with more or less garlic, hot pepper. YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS BABY.  i do soak the cukes in ice water, and do the hot bath.
now i'm doing them for the second year.  i gave away numerous jars of these and everybody loves them.  my kids eat a whole jar in 2 days!

This is my first attempt with Sharon's recipe.  After filling and sealing the jars half did not seal properly.  I got my bath water boiling, put the jars in, waited for the water to boil again and then left in for 5 minutes.  After pulling the jars they had lost about 1 inch of mixture.  All lids were secure???

Thank you for posting this pickle recipe!  I had intended on sharing these with family and friends as Christmas gifts but I had so few left after my own family devoured jar after jar. Wonderful flavor and SO crisp and fresh tasting!  (Even for a new & inexperience canner)

These pickles taste like Vlasics and are super delicious after only 1 day (can't imagine how much better they will get :), but I had my tribulations.  First attempt canned 14 quarts attepmting hot lid/hot brine method of sealing.  Panicked when the didn't start "popping" to seal after a couple of hours, so I inverted 7 in boiling water for 5 minutes and placed the other 7 upright in boiling water just until boiling.  They all sealed, and they are both still crunchy.  Second attempt...tried another 14 quarts with hot lid/hot brine method, didn't panic, next morning only one sealed.  Attempted inverted method again, 4 jars leaked brine.  :(  Now attempting upright method but worrying this batch will be soggy.  Will update later with info.  For those that got a bit soggy, you may try a pinch of alum in each jar..this works for my other recipes.  In the future I will heat until just a boil and pull out.  Thanks for sharing.

I made these pickles last year for the first time, and they were such a hit, I am working on my second batch right now!  We love everything about this recipe, it is so easy!  My 3 year old daughter likes the garlic that is in the jar as much as she likes the pickles.   I also cut the cukes into spears to squeeze in as many as possible per jar.  Lovely!

Where is the 6 Star rating?!  In a word, incredible!  So simple, yet such amazing results!  I prepared the recipe essentially as submitted by Sharon, but was forced to improvise when I could find no fresh heads of dill at ANY of my local stores.  I also had no dill SEED, so relied solely on my baby dill heads, lots of it, to give that essential flavor.  While they were dilly enough, my jars did SLIGHTLY resemble a kelp bed from the baby dill I used. Terrific punch of pickle flavor, and a crisp texture as a result of the soaking. I also inverted my jars in a low-level water bath to make sure I got a good seal, and I'm glad I did.  I don't think the brife & shallow bath harmed the crispy texture, at all.  

Sharon, thank you for a wonderful recipe!  It will be my new stand-by, and I can't wait to try this recipe using other veggies. Thank you!

As others suggested I added some red pepper flakes to the mixture.  We waited 4 days before we opened them and boy were they good!
Several people have tried them and were really impressed with my results.

I have finally found a dill pickle recipe that I will use.  Perfect pickles!  I canned some whole and made spears.  Taste was great after only 1 day.  Will continue using this recipe and pass it along to others.

My mom used this recipe for years but this was my first attempt at canning. These pickles are AMAZING. They are crisp, not too vinegary and have a little zip (I added a dried red chili pepper to each jar.) Next year, I'm canning twice as much!

I have made these pickles several times now, and had already written a review in the past.  I have adjusted the recipe a bit and wanted to share my results.  I have added a dried red pepper, chopped garlic, 1 tsp of Alum in each jar and about 1 TBSP of peppercorns.  I do have to say that this really added a lot.  It gives a little kick but is not too overpowering.  Excellent pickles!

Excellent recipe, my whole family LOVES these pickles. Since it was my first time ever doing pickles, I was VERY happy taht this was sooo easy to do. I did soak my cucumbers in icewater for a couple of hours first, but did a second batch with my leftover cucs that I had put in the fridge, and only soaked them for about 30 mins and they turned out fine as well. I passed on the water bath also, and they are crunchy and crisp! Excellent recipe, I wont bother trying any other one!

I made these pickles at the beginning of this week and have been tempted to try them since.  I finally gave in and they were awesome!  Crunchy, garlicy, delicious.  This was my very first time canning anything and the outcome was amazing.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I was looking for a recipe for crispy pickles, and i found it here. I made them today and I can't get some of the jars to seal. They keep popping back up. I read alot of reviews for this recipe and I have faith that it will be good. SOme of the jars I re-bathed them, and hope that they will not be wilted.  Thanks Sharon for sharing and definitely a great recipe and so easy to do. Hubby and I can't wait to try them in a couple of months. Again thanks.

Wow! Wow! Wow! These are so good! I just caught my husband drinking the brine after we just finished a jar at dinner. I canned these 2 weeks ago. I just can't imagine how good they'll be in the 8 weeks suggested. Very simple to make. I did skip the hot water bath. Thanks Sharon. You've got a big hit here!

These are awesome.  Everyone is always asking for them.  You don't necessarily have to wait the whole time - sometimes we only wait a week, and they're still delicious.  I do let them sit in the ice water sometimes overnight and it doesn't seem to hurt.

I have been gardening and canning for forty years and this is the best tasting, crispiest dill pickle recipe I have ever used but for the life of me I cannot keep the jars sealed! The jars and lids are sterilized and the brine is boiling when I pour it in but within three weeks the seal break.  I check them daily and refrigerate immediately should a seal break and are able to use them. Am I the only one with this problem?  I have never had a sealing problem with any other food I preserve.  One person finished with a boiling bath and I shall try that but was concerned that they would lose their crispness.

Make sure you use pickling cucumbers. I did this recipe first with what was on hand - Marketmore slicer cucumbers I had grown. The flavor was good but they were mushy. Tried it again with pickling cucumbers purchased at Sprouts and they turned out fantastic. Crisp, flavorful, and better than any store-bought pickle I've had. I like to throw in some whole peppercorns and jalapeno slices for an extra kick.

I also trim the top of the pickle about 1/4". The end where the stem is connected will leave a tart taste. For a little extra zing I add one hungarian waxed pepper for each jar. Slice the top only and leave the seeds in. I definitely agree soaking the cukes is essential. You can also add two teaspoons of alum to the brine to keep them firm.

Pickles mushy?  Here's one solution.  The end of the cucumber that held the flower contains an enzyme, that if not removed, will cause your pickles to be soft.   While cold water bath etc will help, if you do not trim the flower end off the cucumber, it will be soft when pickled.

This is a fantastic pickle recipe!!!  I have not had luck with making pickles and had given up making them until now.  I followed this recipe and the suggestions below.  I made dill, kosher and jalapeno versions.  All I can say is that every jar that we've opened has been a winner and have gotten rave reviews.  I will definitely be making these again next year AND will be doubling the recipe because the ones that I made this year will not last the winter!

I have been making pickles for many years, and this is a great recipe. The ONLY reason I am not giving 5 stars... is sanitation.  Soaking cukes in bathtub, or sink?  I always use a large container which has been sanitized, and don't use tap water.  The later processes are not enough to kill off bacteria that is likely to find its way in during the soaking, and even the salt and vinegar may not be enough to get what the limited heating up during the bath process misses.    Again, great recipe...  just be careful with the processes.  Sorry, my OSHA background takes over sometimes :)

Great Recipe!  Only thing i would like to add, we ready about pickling in the Blue book guide to pickling and it suggested to cut 1/16" off the end of the pickle.  They said otherwise an enzyme is released that causes the pickle to soften.  We did it with ours, but are still waiting to try them!

These are fantastic. Made them last yea -- making them again right now -- and they'll be my go-to dill pickle recipe from now on. I made 1/2 my batch last year with grape leaves and 1/2 without. The ones with grape leaves were noticeably crisper so this year they are all getting them!

turned out well, but very heavy on the garlic. May have been the garlic i used...fresh, giant heads of it, but still. next time i will go lighter on the garlic as it seems to get enhanced when it sits. otherwise, a good, easy recipe!

Everyone who has tried these pickles raves about them!  My husband loves them - has a couple spears with lunch nearly everyday. I also made some as slices that are great for burgers. Good and crisp with great flavor.

Simple and delicious, my first time out making pickles and my family is impressed. No one could wait two months to try them, they are just right and very crunchy!

Great recipe!  I don't do the boiling bath method though, I steam them.  I cover the pickles with boiling brine, put the lid and rings on, and then but them in a tall pan with a little water in the bottom and a lid on the pot.  Once the water comes to a good boil, I time the pickles for about 3 minutes and then take them out.  The pickles are nice and crunchy!

We just cracked open our first jar...after 8 long weeks, lol.  They are pretty good.  I find them a bit salty, so we will cut back on that next time.  They are not Claussen pickle crunchy, but they are crisp.  I'd definitely make these again.  Btw, we did not do the hot water bath with these.  It took them a long time to seal, but they eventually did.

These are awesome.  The secret is the salt-vinegar-water ratio and this recipe is absolutely perfect and WAY better than any store-bought pickle. And you can experiment with pickling spices, garlic, adding hot peppers, etc.  Thanks for the recipe - it's the best one I've found!

Absolutely amazing!!! My first 8 quarts are gone within 2 weeks! They sure didn't make it 8 weeks! I live a very small town and could not find dill sprigs or dill heads, so I substituted 1 t. dill seed and 1 t. dill weed and they are FABULOUS! My friends and family just use the packet mixes. Now they are dying to get the recipe from me!!!! Thank you Sharon!!!!!

REALLY liked these!  I sliced them into chips with my mandoline, let them sit for a few days and couldn't resist and dug into them way too soon, still delish!  Can't wait to make these again next season!

I have never made pickles before but had too many cucumbers not to try. This recipe was pretty easy to throw together. I did not have alot of fresh dill so I used dry at the end, and in a few jars we added jalepeno peppers for zing. Its been eight weeks, and WOW. These pickles are fantastic.  The hot ones are too hot for me, the rest are a huge hit.  My family are pickle fanatics and they all gave 5 stars.  Thanks!

Super! FANTABULOUS!! Wonderful! First time I ever made dill pickles,I didn't do the water bath , 2 jars didn't seal. I struggled for 8 weeks to let them set but it was well worth the wait! Have been to 3 Labor Day Parties, brought these pickles to every party and everyone raved about them they even ate the garlic! Woo Hoo! Thank you!

We had a TON of cucumbers from our CSA this year so I ventured into the world of pickles with this recipe. I knew that I was not using proper "pickling" cucumbers, but I couldn't let the cuces go to waste. They were a bit mushy since I used the "wrong" kind of cucumber (I had to cur them into spears to fit them in jars). Nevertheless, I used the inversion method, added mustard seed, dill seed, and celery seed to the brine, and minced the garlic before adding it to the jars. I made a total of three batches, adding 1 jalepeno/pint with the first batch (deemed not spicy at all). Just made the third batch and added strips from 3 hot peppers per quart and we'll see how that goes. Our only problem is that we've never been able to wait the recommended time to eat them. We've already devoured the 7 quarts I made last month! I don't think that the remaining 13 quarts will last us through winter, but I know that we will enjoy every jar. Thank you for the great recipe!

These pickles are great!! I only boiled in the hot water bath for about five minutes (just long enough to seal the jar) I also added whole black peppercorns, sliced jalapeno peppers fresh from the garden (with seeds removed) and a dash of red pepper flakes to each jar. Next time, I might just leave the seeds in because we like it hot! The amount of garlic in this recipe is right on!!

This was our first attempt at pickles and the results couldn't have been better.  We did soak the cuc's and they stayed nice and crispy.  Even some ladies in the family that have been making pickles for years, asked for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing

These are very good.  Only recommendation is making sure the cloves of garlic are smashed a little when you put them in as I think it helps the garlic flavor process better.  It does work for spears, but you will need to let them store on shelf a little longer as it takes a bit longer for the flavor to work through the cucumber.  Definately the way to go for cucumber slices.

I've been using this recipe for 3 or 4 years now and have passed it along to at least 2 other people.  My granddaughters and their friends love these pickles; they usually eat at least one and more often two jars of these when they spend the night.  I cut the cucumbers into spears and try to keep the pickles in a spare refrigerator.

This is my first time trying pickles and I was soooo happy with these!  I opened my first jar 4 weeks after pickling and boy were they good!  This recipe is easy and delicious.  If you are thinking of trying pickling and are scared, don't be.  This recipe is great.  I gave mine a boil bath for 5 minutes and that was enough to seal the jars, and still leave the pickles  crunchy.  Best dill pickles EVER!

I made 3 jars of these pickles just 2 days ago and my teen daughter has already finished off 2 of the jars!! I have never, EVER made pickles (or canned anything) but wanted to try for fun. Don't know if I was supposed to cut the cucumbers up, but I cut them into spears. I won't even attempt another recipe as this one made perfect, crisp pickles. Be forewarned though, my daughter says they are like potato chips- you can't eat just one!

The flavor of these pickles is awesome! Mine turned out pretty mushy though, but I only soaked them for 2 hours. I would recommend soaking as long as you can! I will make again, thanks!

These are fabulous!!! My husband could only wait a week (instead of the recommended 8) before trying them, he liked them so much he canned another batch for me. Very crispy, similar to the "Kosher" store brand.

I like it better when the water has cooled. Other reviewers agree.  I now make the recipe with whatever dill I have and sea salt.  The smaller version is 3 parts water to 1 part white vinegar.  Ajust sea salt and dill, and garlic.  I like to add pickling spice.  These don't last very long inour house.   I like them the next day too.

I use 3 1/2 cups white vinegar and 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar in each batch instead, and add either a jalapeno or habanero to each jar. All our friends loves these pickles and ask for jars each year. Have also used this solution with reduced amount of salt to can sliced jalapenos.

I have made this recipe for a number of years and it is very good. My mother-in-law said to put a grape leaf in the bottom of the jar to help add "CRUNCH". This works every time!  Also, I make sure that the brine is boiling when I add it to the jars.

I've been making these pickles for three years now.  I grow all my own ingredients.  The recipe is fine as written and you don't need to change it.  Naturally, we all do that anyhow.  What I do, that I learned from others, is chop the flower ends off of the cukes so that they stay firm and crunchy, and I add a small grape leaf (wash first) for the same purpose - the results are great.  I don't add chemical astringents.  Sometimes I add a little pickling spice for a change, or a hot pepper in the jar for a little zip.  I use fresh dill heads ALWAYS, but you can substitute I guess.  Never had a failure.  I eat them every day, give the pickles as gifts, have tastings with the kids, compare batches like wine vintages.  It's fun.  I haven't bought a jar of pickles in a two years.

Very good flavor, but discolored and went soft after a month or so.

To icecoolputer - Safety first! That's why you need to sterilize your jars. You don't want to get dust, foreign particles, etc in you pickles (especially if your jars have been sitting on a shelf since last harvest). It is easy to sterilize the jars in your dishwasher either with a complete wash or hot rinse. ***This recipe is easy and straight forward. My pickles look great in the jar.....can't wait to taste them.

This recipe is excellent and highly recommended!  I use a bunch of garlic both minced and full cloves and toss in some finely sliced red bell peppers to give the jars a nice little touch of color!

This is a great, tangy pickle juice recipe that could use a little less garlic, but is overall very tasty.

Not as crispy as I would have liked, but the taste is perfect -- every bit as good as the most expensive from the specialty store shelves.

We all love these pickles.  I wish I could make them crisper, but I know it's because I give them the full 20 minute water bath.  I'm afraid of spoilage, even though I know others have done it.

Made this recipe 5 weeks ago and just sampled a pickle and wow are they good. Came out nice and crispy with a perfect amount of dill and sourness too. Even my wife (who is so so on pickles) loved them! I'm giving a jar away today to my daughter. I am planning another batch and will be up sizing to a bigger batch. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I wasn't a fan. They weren't crispy enough. Also, I think the taste was a little off on some of them. Probably will tweak the recipe more. Although the boyfriend loved them.

This recipe is flat-out FANTASTIC! We followed it exactly and used cucumbers from a farmer picked the day before.  We waited 7 weeks, and they are better than store pickles.  We made a couple of jars with hot peppers stuck in them.  The regular recipe is 100% the best recipe for pickles we've ever tried.  Awesome!

Excellent recipe!  This was my first time making dill pickles.  Glad I picked this one.  My in-laws came by and ate the last jar - said they tasted just like their mawmaw's.  Best pickles ever.  This is a keeper!

Wow, if I would have had this recipe years ago, I would be neck deep in pickles every year!!  These are as fantastic as everyone before me has said.  I did not process them in a hot water bath.  I did as one other member suggested and inverted the jars as they were filled and covered them all with a blanket overnight.  In the morning they were all sealed.  I had enough brine and cukes left to make a pint of spears.  I knew I would want to taste these before 8 weeks so I put them in the fridge and could only hold out for two days.  OMG  so so good, and crisp!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!

This was my first attempt at making pickles and they turned out perfect.  I am so excited.  Fabulous recipe, my whole family thinks so!  I did the cold canning method and they all sealed but one.  And they also turned out perfectly crispy.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I used this recipe when I had a big garden in the midwest.  My husband says they are the best he's ever had!  I now live in the mountains and haven't done any canning in 2 years.  I just couldn't put it off any longer and hit the farmer's market this morning.  I am canning tonight (due to the heat!)and we are looking forward to using this recipe again.  I have never had a problem with mushy pickles since I let the cukes soak all day in ice/water.  This is the best recipe I have ever used for dills!

I will definitely make this my standard Dill Pickle recipe.  Really good.  I added about 1/4 tsp. mustard seed.  I made spears, just because the cucumbers I had were so big.  I'm going to make whole pickles and probably some sandwich stackers too.  Excellent.  Thanks!  I boiled some in a hot water bath for 6 minutes and left some out with just the boiling brine.  I did boil the flats first.  All of my jars sealed.

I halved this recipe and it came out perfectly! 1 lb. of cukes per quart is right on! I was bummer out to find one of the jars broke in the water bath. I've never had that happen before but heard that it can. All sealed nicely. I used baby dill and more garlic. I'll be making these again as soon as I find some jars!

These pickles are absolutely fantastic though  Also - if you use new, very immature fresh garlic from your farmer's market you will not have the problem of 'blue' garlic in your jars.  The young garlic can be a pain to peel but worth it in the end.  We will be making double last year's output and I am sure it will still not be enough.

This was my first attempt at making homemade dill pickles. Very easy to follow and the pickles look great in the jars. I also cut them into spears and added a few jalopeno peppers to some of the jars. I can't wait to try these!

This is our first attempt at making pickles and I must say it was a piece of cake.  We tried a variety of plain dills, spicy, whole, speared, and sliced.  We couldn't wait the 8 weeks so we opened a jar of the slices after about 5 days and, WOW!  They are fantastic!  We thought we had made to many jars but if they continue to get better as they age, we'll need to make some more.

Followed everyone's advice and didn't do the boiling bath. I did slices and they were even crunchy. Tastes like pickles bought chilled, not from the shelf. Excellent recipe, ours tasted good after just two days. Next time will try adding a little mustard seed.

Thanks! My mom has used this recipe for 50 years and I lost my copy.  I do not really like to can or wait 8 weeks, so I simply slice the cucumbers and leave on the counter for a day to cure then refrigerate.  Yummy, they are ready in a few days.  I also tried to make a relish with this recipe and it turned out really yummy too.  I added a few turns from a pepper mill for a little added zest.   Thanks again.

I have never had dill pickles turn out good so I gave this recipe a try...one last time. The pickles are awesome. My family ate a jar in one sitting. My dad grows all the cucumbers so he said he will be bringing more next summer. Thanks!!

This is the first recipe we could find that actually resulted in crisp pickles. The spices need some adjusting for our taste but otherwise a good recipe.

My daughter and I prepared a batch of pickles with this recipe and we could not not believe how good they turned out.  We loved it!  Now we will make additional batches to last us the winter. We would totally recommend it to you (in the words of my 8 year old daughter).

I made my first batch of these about 3-4 weeks ago, so they really haven't had enough brine time.  I cheated a little on my last jar--I decided not to seal it and just make refrigerator pickles instead.  I just was lazy, really, as my canner holds 7 jars and I didn't feel like canning the 8th jar.  At any rate, I've tried the ones I made into refrigerator pickles and they are pretty good.  Not fully flavored just yet--I can distinguish separate flavors, but still really good.  I totally screwed up and used pickling spice instead of pickling salt.  For those of you who are wondering, no, it's not the same thing.  Pickling salt is actual salt without any impurities (so you can probably use regular salt in a pinch)--pickling spice has mustard seed, cloves, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, mace, and a few other ingredients I'm not remembering at this moment.  So, this batch will be spicy in comparison to what the recipe reads but that's okay.  I made another batch of these a week ago with actual pickling salt so we'll see how different that one is when I break open those jars.  Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you, Sharon, for an easy and delicious recipe! I had never made pickles before, but had to do something with a bumper crop of cucumbers. These pickles turned out crisp and so tasty! Everyone who has tasted them wants a jar and "my" recipe ;-)

Great recipe!  The pickles turned out nice and crisp!  They are a little salty for me, I will cut back on that next time. Other than that, very good!!!

The taste was wonderful. I am sure I will be making them again. I just wish that the cold ice water would have helped the pickles stay crispy. But it didn't. I may try soaking them in alum, then rinsing the pickles next time to see if that helps. I did make one change to the recipe. I used garlic scabs instead of whole garlic since I had them on hand.

I tried these last year and they turned out perfect. The lids sealed without much processing in the water bath. This year I am having such a hard time with the lids sealing that I have to process them twice. So I'm sure they'll be nice and mushy, even though I did use some pickling lime. I'll have to wait a few weeks and see what happens.

This review is perhaps a bit on the hasty side.  It's been 6 whole days and I was craving some egg salad and needed some pickles so I broke into a jar.  These are VERY yummy and perfectly crisp...can't wait till they reach their fullest flavor! This recipe is a keeper!    The only note I made was to use 8 1/2 lbs of cukes since the last jar was a little short.

I just finished making about 14 quarts of these pickles.  I used the cold pack method and only 4 of the jars have sealed.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I followed all the details the recipe offered and wish I knew how others seem to have no problem sealing theirs.  I would do a water bath to get them sealed but they've been cooling now for about 3 hours, so I think I'd have to boil them quite awhile.

Me and my husband were so excited to try this recipe after searching and searching on the web.  We followed the recipe exactly.  I have to admit, we couldn't wait 8 weeks but it has been 4.  We opened a jar last night :( I will say this though....they were nice and crunchy BUT they were SO sour, way to vinegary.  Will they taste any different if we let them sit for another 4 weeks.  I don't understand especially after reading all the excellent reviews.  We made 12 jars and I certainly don't want to throw them away.

Excellent!  It has a bit of a kick in a good way.  These pickles never lasted long in the fridge...we ate them right up!  The hardest thing about the recipe was waiting for them to be ready, after knowing how good they were going to be!

This was my first attempt at pickles.  An all day project, but fun.  My pickles were mushy when we ate them - could be that my ice bath didn't stay icy?  Also, go easy on the garlic or eliminate all together.

These were pretty good. It was my first time making pickles. I would say it'd be good if it had a little less dill. Make sure also that you use very fresh cucumbers.

I love this simple recipe.  I found it several years ago when I first joined All Recipies.  I used store bought cucumbers to make my original batch but have since added many plants to my yearly garden.  I use this recipe for pickling green beans and asparagus as well.  When I make a batch I like to add extra ingredients to the jars for a variety of flavor profiles.  Extras I like to add are jalapeños, habaneros, really any hot peppers will do, slivered onions, red pepper flakes, dried dill seed (whether I have the dill weed or not), mustard seed, celery salt, and whole peppercorns.  I like to mix and match as I go.

I don't like sweet pickles at all. This is by far the best garlic doll pickles I've ever made and ate! Everyone asks me for this recipe and then they're shocked at how simple it is to make. Goes to show that simple and good ingredients make for delicious food.

We make about 50-75 lbs of these pickles every year, now I can't get my kids to eat pickles at restaurants or store bought. I've created pickle snobs! I have found that soaking them in ice water and processing them for the required time and then getting them out on a cool night to cool off quickly, allows for a much more crisp pickle, don't over cook them!

This is the only recipe I use for making dill pickles(and I have tried many).  My batch is usually pretty small, so I do everything up to the water bath. Instead, I put a large jar in the refrigerator and let them cure in there for about 2 weeks.  Crispy and delicious

These had the perfect crunchy texture, but they were very garlicky. I would call them garlic pickles.

This will be my third year of making pickles with this recipe.  I tend to need more brine.  TIP:  You should trim of a bit of the flower-end of the cucumbers to keep them crisp, there's an enzyme present at that end that will make for mushy pickles if you don't.  Otherwise, you can add chemicals "pickle crisp" or whatever to curb this if that's your bag.

Lovely! I waited a bit too long after harvest to process, so they didn't turn out as crunchy as I like, but that's my screwup. Next time I'll be more vigilant.

My pickles got moldy after 2 weeks. I am glad I waited to ensure they'd turn out OK.  I consulted others and they said they vinegar-water ration needs a 2-1 ratio and Ball recommends a 1-1 ratio. It's possible that because I could only get my water to 200 degrees that had an effect but I would check this recipe for safety.

I tried these and they were good but WAY TOO SALTY. I did not over process the brine and make it have a higher concentration of salt. I ended up throwing some out because of it.

Made these yesterday and after canning most of them put a bunch of whole pickles in a gallon jar and added jalapeño and banana peppers along with original ingredients.  This large jar is in the fridge and had to have a taste this morning.  Oh are they good!  Can't imagine how much better they will be in a few weeks.  Crispy and delish! Hope the ones I canned come out as good as these.

I thought these were extremely salty and sour. i followed the recipe exactly but scaled it down to do the few cucumbers i had in my garden. they could have been crunchier but i chalk that up to the fact i used pretty large cucumbers. 2 or 3 to the jars i had. they were a little mushy in the center. But by far the main issue was how salty they were.

These are wonderful! My 5yr old loves helping make these and marking the jars for the 8 weeks when they will be ready.  I did add extra garlic to each jar b/c we love garlic but other than that I did everything as the recipe calls.

This was my first time making pickles. They look like they turned out perfect (I don't know because I haven't had the pleasure of eating them yet...it's only been 1 week). I followed other people's instructions on leaving out the bath. The only downside is that my garlic turned blue - assume it's some sort of chemical process, but it really doesn't bother me. Thanks for the recipe!

These turned out great, even though I had to stop soaking the cukes (my daughter broke her leg!) and soak them again later. Very crunchy, just a great texture. They turned out a bit salty (even for me), but I attribute that to mistakes I made (too much water boiled off while I filled the jars), not the recipe. I may add a bit more dill next time, but I'll definitely make them again next year.

I don't know what I did wrong but this was inedibly salty. Tossed the whole batch. I gave it two stars because I'm willing to admit the problem was most likely something I did.

The first jar that I opened at around 1 month was very good.  By the time I opened the second jar, the pickles were too strong for my taste.  I haven't dared open another jar yet.  It was a fun recipe to try though!

What a great recipe! My batch turned out wonderfully flavorfull but not too salty like my mom's. I especially appriciated the crispness!
