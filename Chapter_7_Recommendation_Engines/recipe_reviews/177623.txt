My Favorite Lasagna Recipe by Far! Have made it 5 times for family get togethers.Love that one cant even taste the spinach! I usually get the Ragu or Prego sauce with mushrooms. This is definetely a keeper! for all those busy moms like myself that dont have the time to make their own sauce.Word of advice, wait about 25 minutes before digging in for this lasagna hold its shape. Enjoy you wont be dissapointed!

Wow! Very Impressed! I've made Spinach Lasagna for years and this by far is the EASIEST and TASTIEST version I've come across. I added 5 cloves of minced garlic (lightly sauteed in olive oil), equally divided in the cheese mixture and tomato sauce.  Also used some extra tomato sauce with veggies.  My whole family said it was one of the best lasagnas they've ever had! Fabulous! This will be my new "staple" recipe for lasagnas.

This is very good and very easy. The only thing I did different was just about double all of the ingredients except the noodles and the spinach. It just need more filling and sauce and it was perfect!

This is a great recipe! I added ground beef and bacon to make it a bit more hearty and it was wonderful! (If you do this be sure to have extra sauce available because the added meat throws off the ratio. I used a different brand of sauce and it was still fabulous!

This was a great recipe - I'll definitely be making it again. No boiling the regular lasagna noodles makes this super easy as far as clean-up. The only change I made was adding one beaten egg to the ricotta, mozzarella, spinach mixture. If you need a really easy lasagna recipe, don't hesitate to make this one!

Wonderful and easy. I end up using 9 lasagna noodles instead of 6, making 3 layers of 3 but otherwise keep the recipe the same. I used fat free ricotta cheese and wheat noodles. Wonderful and makes great leftovers!

Great recipe! I also added sauted onions, carrots & zucchini and used a jar of spaghetti sauce. Also replaced the ricotta cheese with 1% cottage cheese to try to reduce the fat content. I will definitely make this again!

This really is the easiest lasagna recipe ever. I added a package of silken tofu to the ricotta to increase the protein since we are eating vegetarian. I also used 9 noodles and increased the bake time by about 10 minutes. My cheese wasn't browning, so I put the broiler on low for the last few minutes. We really liked it, and my son didn't know the tofu was in it until I told him.

I had never made lasagna and this recipe gave me an excellent place to start!  I did decide to add some heat to this recipe in adding two minced habaneros.  I also added some ground Italian Turkey.  If you like your lasagna to be on the fuller side, I would recommend doubling the recipe.

I used a 9x13 baking dish, the thin lasagna noodles (takes 4 to do one layer in 9x13 dish), 1 1/2 jars of Prego spaghetti sauce, and an Italian cheese blend in addition to the mozzarella cheese.  Also, I added the cheese on top before cooking for 40 minutes, then cooked for about 15-20 more minutes without the aluminum foil in order to brown the cheese.  This was very easy to make. My family and I enjoyed it.

This turned out really good, and like the title states extra easy.  I added mushrooms sauteed in OO and 3 garlic cloves, jar of marinated artichoke hearts.  I ended up using 6 cups/2 jars of sauce and 3 cups of cheese. We like everything extra saucy and cheesy.  I will absolutly make again!

I used whole wheat noodles and fresh spinach and accidentally forgot to put in the ricotta cheese in, but the dish still came out really well.  I will definitely try it again.

I made this on one particular night with friends and family. The cheese and sauce was heaven in the mouth and went well with the pasta noodles. Everyone kept getting extra servings till we all finished the whole casserole in just hours!

loved this. dont make lasagna often because of the time. this was simple enough and taste was good. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta... it was a little cheaper.  added broccoli, onion and carrots with the spinach. next time will double other filling ingredients. Even my 8 month old daughter loved it.

Being a vegetarian, I really wanted to find a lasagna that I'd love and one that my carnivore family would love also.  And this is it.  It was amazing.  The spinach gave it a unique taste.  I didn't necessarily have all of the ingredients, so I improvised.  When I pulled it out to put the cheese on top, I added Italian seasoning also.   I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

I've tried, unsuccessfully to make lasagna several times in the past. When I found this recipe, I decided to give it another go, and it was the best lasagna I'd ever made. And very easy. I added in browned hamburger meat to the sauce but kept all of the other ingredients the same. I also upped the size of the lasagna to a 3qt pan. I found, with the exception of the noodles, that this could be done without having to alter any of the quantities. The noodles were upped to 6 for this.

This is the first time I have been successful in making lasagna. The noodles came out cooked without the mess of having to preboil them (which I never get right and end up with torn pieces). Assembly was a snap. The filling was yummy. I can see where you can add shredded carrots or zuccini or whatever and you could certainly add meat to the sauce if you like but this is an excellent recipe as is. A great way to get the nutrition from spinach. I don't think it's really 8 servings though. They would very small. I got 6 reasonable portions for just under 400 calories per serving.

Perfect!  I double the recipe and make two pans at a time because my teenage son will eat half the pan for dinner and the other half for lunch the next day!!  Skinny teenage boys are bottomless pits so this saves me time and money!  Great as is or add cooked Italian sausage and/or ground beef to it and use 9 noodles per pan...3 per layer.  I use 8 or 9 inch x 13 or 14 inch glass baking pans for this....never fails to disappear quickly!  Really, one of our favorites! Thank you for this recipe!

Really good recipe for lasagna.  Can't believe how easy this was to make and had same results I had when using a much complex recipe.  Will use this recipe more often.

This was incredibly flavorful, easy, and adaptable to my changes. I can't believe that you don't have to boil the noodles beforehand!  I was actually out of spinach (because it went bad), so I mixed basil with the ricotta instead. I made an extra large pan (and could have used twice the ricotta) but I made it work- by adding extra mozarella. I added mushrooms and sauteed garlic to the sauce. The time and temperature suggested in this recipe worked perfectly.

Ths turned out great. but i agree with others - must use more ricotta and more spinach. i used fresh spinach though that i sauteed with garlic, added garlic salt to the rocotta and spinach mix. and cooked the lasgna noodles. i used fresh "exotic" mushrooms too which added taste instead of the sauce with mushrooms ready made.

I would increase the spinach to (2) 10oz packages. I didn't feel like there was enough.

Good lasagna recipes are hard to come by but this one was very easy and very good.  I used the shredded Italian mixture of cheese you can buy and whatever pasta sauce I had in the pantry.  I also sauteed up some ground beef and added chopped mushrooms.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks.

This recipe was extra easy!  The spinach made the dish!  Great ingredient!  I used Healthy Harvest wheat noodles, and instead of using 6 noodles I used 9.  I thought 6 noodles would make it too thin.  I also didn't add the 1/4 cup of water.  I wasn't sure why this was included in the recipe.  Any thoughts?  This dish was even better the second night, reheated as leftovers.  A side salad is a nice side to this dish.  I would make this again!

This was really good. I used 2 jars of the sauce just because I like saucy lasagna and threw in some fresh mushrooms too. It was good that night but really really good the next day as leftovers.

Super easy and so good!  I accidentally put all the mozzarella in the ricotta/spinach mixture, so I had to get out more for the top.  5 kids under age 9, including a neighbor who claimed he doesn't like spinach, ate it up!  Raw noodles cooked perfectly.  Definitely a keeper!

Best lasagna I have ever made!  The only change I made was browning some ground beef.  I then made the top layer lasagna noodles, sauce, ground beef and cheese.  I also cooked it just a bit longer.  My daughter who despises spinach even loved this!

This was the only lasagna I've made that turned out great!  And the easiest!  My toddler had seconds and he hates everything.  I added a little garlic salt, garlic powder, minced onion, and Italian seasoning to the cheese mixture and used whole wheat lasagna noodles.  It was yummy!

A little too spinachy but quite tasty. Much easier to make and quantity is more reasonable than classic lasagna. I added parmesan cheese to the top layer. I served it with a side of zucchini, but next time I will substitute zucchini for some of the spinach.

Very easy. Very quick. Very yummy! (I added about 5 cut-up artichoke hearts because I wanted to use them up and they definitely added to the dish. Probably wouldn't make it without them, actually.) Proof that lasagna doesn't have to take forever to make. Next time, I'll probably add one more layer, though, as just two layers of noodles seemed kinda wimpy.

Fantastic!  I'd never made lasagna before, but my fiance was really impressed with this.  Sooo easy!  My only caution is to allow *plenty* of time for the lasagna to cool before eating it.  I let it stand for 30 min, and even then, it was just barely cool enough to eat!

Great easy recipe. I made a few changes that make this recipe even easier, first I used 9 oven-ready noodles to make 3 layers and I skipped adding the water, second I seasoned the spinach/cheese mixture with salt and pepper and split it into thirds to make 3 layers, I didn't drain the spinach which makes mixing easier and gives a little extra moisture for the noodles.

I was looking for something quick and easy to bring for lunch with my mother-in-law. I made this in 40 minutes and it was delicious. My mother-in-law asked for the recipe. The only change I made was to sprinkle the top with parmesan cheese before it went in for the final 10 minutes of baking.

This was a great and easy recipe.  I did add ground meat that I cooked in Italian seasoning.  The family loved it!

Have to agree, this is a super lasagna recipe and a twist from the usual ground beef version. Took a double pan to a church dinner and got rave reviews from a very international crowd. Nothing to change. Just pure awesomeness!

This is probably the easiest Lasagna recipie that I have tried out. Best part - did not have to cook the sheets. I added @ 3 layers, sealed it with foil and popped in oven for 40 mins then broiled them for 10 mins to get the top layer crusty by melting the cheese. This one is a keeper

So easy and so delicious! I was initially hesitant about using uncooked noodles but they come out perfectly. The spinach gives the dish a nice texture and color, and is a good alternative to the traditional meat lasagna. This has become a family favorite.

Very good.  I added an egg to the ricotta mixture as well as extra oregano, basil & marjoram.  I also doubled the mozzarella both in the ricotta and on top of the lasagna.  My son who normally doesn't like spinach or ricotta cheese ate the combination in this dish without any complaints.

This recipe is AMAZING! Though the first time I made it for my family, the cheese tasted a bit past it's due date. The next time I made it, the noodles were full of tiny black bugs. Though since I live in Thailand, this was no big surprise! I would definately recommend this recipe for all CHEESE lovers!

Easy and delicious.  I added some basil, garlic, s+p and an egg to the ricotta mixture.  Also added chopped meatballs. Topped with parm cheese.  Skipped the water, didn't need it.  Used no-boil noodles.

Loved this!!  I used fresh spinach since I had it on hand, and I just sauteed it with some garlic in olive oil.  I used a Paul Newman's jarred sauce and a low-carb lasagna noodle, and I baked it in a 9" square casserole dish.  It was outstanding!  And super easy! I will definitely be making this one often!

This was really good and simple to make.  My meat-loving husband was skeptical about this dish since it did not have any meat, but he ended up having 3 helpings.  
I made this dish earlier in the morning without adding the water, covered it, and placed it in the fridge.  At dinnertime, I baked it for 50 minutes without adding the water, and let it rest for 20 so it could set properly.  Thanks for a super easy, yet super tasty, lasagna.

My husband and I made this Lasagna tonight and it was delicious. We never made Lasagna before and it was so easy. The only suggestion I have is that instead of adding the water, you soak the noodles in warm water beforehand for a few seconds. It will help immensely.

I agree!  This was FAST, EASY, and TASTY!  I used an 11x7 pan and just broke off the corners of the noodles so they would fit better in the rounded corners of the pan.  I would definitely make this again and recommend it to all my non-cooking friends!

I added salt to taste to the filling.  If I didn't I think it would have been bland.  Other than that it was great!  Super easy and the kids loved it (amazing).

I made this for my parents on Father's Day and it was a hit! I also added garlic and sliced mushrooms to the layers.  The only negative comment I got was that there was a sweetness to it - probably from the pre-made, jarred spaghetti sauce. Next time I'll try adding some oregano, basil, and thyme to the sauce to cut the sweetness, or just make my own spaghetti sauce.

I've made this recipe 3 times. Everytime it turns out perfect! I think the next time I made it though, I will end up making my own tomato sauce. Very easy, and very tasty. I always use my stone ware pan so I don't have to add water to it like other reviews have said.

So easy! And great for my vegetarian kids. Lots of iron in spinach. I added more noodles, just to completely cover the layer in the pan, 8 noodles instead of 6.

I got this from Campbells website about 4 or 5 years ago, and its still my go too recipe! Its a great base too, sometimes I'll add pre sliced fresh mushrooms and pre sliced black olives. Its also great to add Italian sausage to it too! Although I never miss meat when I eat this!

I have a go-to lasagna recipe that is amazing, but very time consuming. I was looking for something super easy with spinach, and this fit the bill. It was somewhat bland, but overall not too bad considering how quick and easy it was to make and how few ingredients it took. Next time, I might spice it up a little with more cheese, maybe some parmesan, or other veggies.

Love how quick and easy this was to make.  Prep time is under 5 minutes!  I, also, never made a lasagna without cooking the noodles first, and was a bit skeptical, but it turned out great.  Very yummy too!

I have used this for Sunday dinners and small group at church and it was received really well by everyone. It goes together fast, and is easily gluten free with Prego and gluten free noodles. I have made additions - with onion, sausage and zucchini,Basil, more layers, extra sauce and extra cheese.

Cooked the recipe exactly as written.  Did not like the taste of the Prego sauce.  Found the Prego sauce to be on the sweet side.  In retrospect, with spinach and with vegetable lasagnas, I think I prefer an alfredo type sauce to a tomato-based sauce. 

I did like the fact that the recipe was easy to make, and that the lasagna noodles cooked all the way through without having to preboil them.

However, I would not make this recipe again in its present form.

I changed things to save a little money. I sauteed down fresh spinich, and made my own meat sauce (halved it for spaghetti later on). I did a smaller pan, but there was some left for a little mini lasagna too. This is AMAZINGLY good. I also boiled my noodles before doing them. Plan to make again- but next time a bigger pan or two so I can freeze one for a quick dinner after work. Super delish!

This had too much tomato sauce for our liking.

First time making lasagna and this one really took no effort at all. I brought it to a small potluck and there were no leftovers! Will make again! I used an 8 x 8 pyrex dish and a different sauce because I couldn't find prego.
