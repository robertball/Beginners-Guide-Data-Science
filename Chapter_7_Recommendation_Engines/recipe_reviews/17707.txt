This recipe is really good, here's a little hint.  Instead of the flour for the thickening, add about 2 tlbs. of cornstarch to  3/4 cup of ketchep, mix it up well until there are no lumps and pour the ketchep mixture in the hot sauce, it's thickens nicely and ketchup is a must in sweet and sour sauce I think.  I added lots of chopped different colour peppers and onions.  Yummy over rice.

This was amazing! I used corn starch (2 TSP) in place of Flour to lower the WW pps and it is still amazing!

This was a great for a quick put together meal.  I didn't have celery or the pineapple but it worked really well substituting mandarin oranges and dried cranberries.  I also added a clove of minced garlic, onion, sliced carrot and used corn starch to thicken.  Tastes great using pork also.

To give this dish that orangey color, I added four tablespoons of catsup. I cut back on the sugar because I used pineapple juice instead of the chunks. I also used cornstarch to thicken and not flour. With my chicken, I dipped the pieces into egg and then into cornstarch and deep fried. Once done, I put everything into my crockpot and let it simmer. Everyone at our Christmas party said it tasted very authentic and I suppose due to my slow cooker, the chicken was incredibly tender. Thanks so much!

Simply wonderful!  Finally, a recipe that makes anything we can get at a restaurant pale in comparison.  I followed several hints from other people: ommitted celery (we don't like it), used 1/4 cup of soy suace, 1/4 cup of vinager, & 1/4 cup of ketchup; also would suggest taking about 1/2 cup of the hot liquid out, mixing it with the flour and then returning it to the rest of the mixture to avoid lumps.  Took this to a pot-luck, served over white rice, and it was all but licked clean.  The best part: my family loves it.  Thanks!

Oh my gosh,  this is to die for!  I just made it, & I can't wait for supper to eat it!  I had to "sneak a little taste" of it already, & I can't believe how something that was as easy as this was to make, can be soooooooo good!  I know my family is going to love it! There will be no leftovers tonight!  Thanks Sal, for submitting this recipe!

I love this recipe!!  The sauce is very tangy, but really good.  I think it would be too tangy if you didn't serve it over rice.  I'll be using this recipe from now on!!

Wowza! This is absolutely delish!!! I must admit, I was a bit skeptical at first.... I am NOT a fan of uncooked celery OR water chestnuts, but I was pleasantly surprised that I liked both in this! I pretty much followed Sal's directions to the letter except for a couple of substitutions. I had a red bell pepper to use up, so I added it (along with one green bell pepper). I cut all of my veggies (except the water chestnuts) into medium-sized chunks. Since my grocer was out of 20 oz. cans of pineapple in juice, I used almost all of (3) 8 oz. cans worth of fruit and juice. My final change was to sub 2 T cornstarch for the flour called for (I have never had any luck with flour as a thickener). NOTE #1: DO NOT add katsup to the sauce! I was tempted to (as a thickener and to impart some color), but I'm SOOOO glad I didn't. If you have red food coloring, use it instead. It only takes a few drops to turn your sauce a traditional red sweet & sour color and you won't have to compromise a great recipe to do so. NOTE #2: Be sure to whisk your thickener (flour or cornstarch) into your liquids BEFORE adding to your hot skillet. Bring to a gentle boil, stirring constantly until thickened and THEN turn the heat down and add your chicken / veggies. Other than needing more chicken (personal preference), I can't think of any way to improve upon this recipe. Just  be sure to serve with plenty of rice to sop up the yummy sauce! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Sal. This is a winner for sure! :-)

Delicious and easy to make.  I left out the celery and used one green and one red pepper.  It looked and tasted great.

Can't wait to make it again.  Didn't use all the green peppers, celery, water chestnuts, or pineapple, and it was very delicious.  Serve with lots of rice.

This was a decent recipe, but I altered it a little to suit my taste.  After I cut up the chicken, I mixed in minced ginger and garlic and let it sit for a bit.  That really improved the flavour of the chicken.  I added quartered onions and sliced carrots in addition to the green pepper and celery.  Since I had some fresh pineapple, I used that instead and compensated with orange juice instead of the pineapple liquid I would have had from the can.  I prefer using cornstarch mixed in with a little cold water instead of flour.  But otherwise followed the rest of the recipe, turned out pretty good.  The vinegar/sugar ratio is right-on and gives the dish a nice sweet tanginess.

This sauce is excellent, and very simple. It's very rich, however, so serve it with lots of rice!

DO NOT USE CRUSHED PINEAPPLE! I would probably cut down on the vinegar too, as the recommended amount makes for a very very strong sauce. I think with some tweaking to suit your families tastes, this could quickly become a fave!!!!!! ( I know I am still experimenting!)

I loved this recipe; nice and sweet to the pallet.  I cooked the chicken in the microwave for 4 minutes in a pampered chef container and it came out juicy and tender.  Also, I added broccoli to the recipe for more veggie kick!

I made the sauce only. I had some prepared egg rolls last and wanted a dipping sauce. This was so dang good! I was a little leary about the color of the sauce because all the sweet and sour sauces I have ever seen are red. I shouldn't have worried. It was fabu. Can't wait to get to make the whole recipe. Thanks Sal!

Very good - I worked with what I had on hand, so I left out the celery and water chestnut, and used a whole red pepper instead of the half green pepper. Delicious!

I fixed this for dinner the other night and even my picky eater loved it.
I added sliced carrots and 1/2 a red bell pepper for color.  It was fantastic.
I will fix this again, often!!

My husband said this is pretty darn close to restaurant sweet and sour. I took some others' advice here - changed the order of cooking around a bit, too. I added 1 clove minced jar garlic, 1 cup chopped broccoli, 1/4 cup onion. Omitted the flour and water chestnuts. I sauteed my vegetables in 1 T oil until they were crisp tender, then added the vinegar, juice, soy sauce & brown sugar; also used 1/4 cup cornstarch smoothly mixed with 1/4 cup ketchup - stirred that into it, thickened and it was *awesome*. Definitely will be making this again - fast, inexpensive, delicious. Thank you!

This is the best homemade sweet and sour chicken I've ever tasted. I've made this recipe for many people and all of them have just about fainted it's so good. I also made it using soy-meatballs instead of chicken and it was scrumptious!

This was much better than I thought it might be as the vegetables were more or less just heated. The celery and water chestnuts gave it a nice crunch. I used a combination of different coloured peppers and adjusted quantities of everything based on how much I had. We used corn starch to thicken but added it closer to the end of cooking, first mixing with hot water.

Another winner, thanks for the recipe! I also fried my chicken in a cornstarch coating, and then subbed cornstarch for flour in the sauce (mixed with ketchup). We didn't have -ANY- of the veggies but even without this was a great recipe. Sure to be a winner with the veggies too.

Turned out great!  Definitely a keeper! My only adjustment was adding a quartered onion and sauteing vegetables with fresh ginger root (later removed) and fresh minced garlic before adding them to the sauce. I used cornstarch, instead of flour and let the sauce reduce a little bit with the piece of ginger root that I later removed.

Very quick and easy. Hubby loved the flavor, but didn't like how brown the sauce was. Flavor was a bit tart for me, 2nd try I cut the pineapple chunks back to a 14oz can. Will make again! Thank you!

In the words of my two year old... YUCK!  Way too sweet and the appearance of this concoction resembled brown gravy!  Will not make again!

The best homemade sweet and sour sauce I've ever made! I sauteed an onion, one green pepper and one red pepper first until the onion was cooked. Then added the ingredients to make the sauce, thickened it with cornstarch mixed with a bit of cold water, and finally added the cooked chicken (bought 8 large cooked and breaded filets from the hot deli section at the grocery store and sliced them up!) and the pineapple. It's a meal that's tasty, the right combo of sweet and tangy, and incredibly easy for week nights when you have no time!

I really enjoyed this recipe but I would definitely say that there is about three times more sauce than needed. I will make it again and cut the sauce ingredients in thirds.

Omg, this is awesome! The only adjustment I made in the sauce was substituting 2T cornstarch for the 1/4C flour. I stir fried the veggies in peanut oil for a few minutes before adding the sauce, which I prepared in a separate pot. I used yellow bell peppers and added some onion and a few carrots. The sauce is perfect as is ... not to sweet, not too sour. Oh, and I used rice wine vinegar because I had it on hand. I would give it 10 stars if I could!

I was not in my own kitchen making this dish which made my life difficult. I only had one medium saucepan so I fried up the chicken with a bit of pepper and garlic powder and cut it into pieces after it was cooked. I deviated from the recipe and cooked the veggies first because I don't like them raw. I took them off the stove then cooked the sauce and added the chicken and veggies back in. It was delicious and my grandma said it was the best chicken she ever had. She was probably exaggerating, but it was really good. Will make it again! oh and I used cornstarch instead of flour. I also only used a forth of a cup of vinegar.

My husband said this was better than restaurant sweet and sour chicken. Like others, just a couple modifications, cornstarch instead of flour, added some ketchup to taste.  Also, I made it a stir fry and browned the chicken in my wok and then added green peppers, onions and water chestnuts.  Added the pineapple to the sauce just before adding it to the stir fry.  I made the Fried Rice Restaurant Style from this site and served together, we ate ever bit of it.  Thanks for sharing the great recipe.

Awesome!!  This recipe was so good, and really easy to make.  I used a 1/4 cup of vinegar instead of 1/2 and it turned out great.

Very good! However, I reduced
the vinegar to about 1/3 cup and it was
plenty tangy. I think the 1/2 cup the
recipe calls for would have been too much for my taste.

It was pretty good...it was a little sweet.  To help w/the color of the sauce, I added a little red and yellow food coloring to it while thickening and it turned out more of a "traditional" color.  I would definately make it again!

I used less sugar (1/2 cup) as suggested by other reviewers and thought this was a great low fat alternative to the sweet and sour chicken you get in Chinese restaurants.  I was a little nervous about the color of the sauce, but it was very good.  My husband liked it too.

This is a wonderful recipe.  It is not only nutritious, but quick.  My kids ages 19 months, 4, and 7 all loved it.  We served it with rice.  I used fresh pineapple instead of canned.  Thanks Sal! :-)

The sauce was a little too sweet for me, but otherwise a good recipe. Next time I may leave out the pineapple juice and just add pineapple to cut the sweetness.

This was a bit too sweet for our taste, so I will cut back on the brown sugar next time.  But other than that, it was a hit.  I also used Wondra rather than regular flour because I am terrible at making smooth sauces.   It went well with fried rice.

Yummy! I cooked chicken in a large skillet then added sauce ingredients (using cornstarch instead of flour, premixed it in the soy sauce to avoid lumps), let it thicken in the skillet then added the vegetables (substituted 1" pieces of vidalia onion instead of the celery). Less dishes to wash! Simple, easy, delicious! Perfect!

This brings me back to my childhood! My mother would make this at least once a month! It is AWESOME! It is so quick on those busy nights!!! I did add a little ginger, garlic salt, and about 1/2 cup of diced onion to the chicken when it was cooking. But this is for sure a keeper!!

This has quickly become a new favorite in our family.  Each time I have made it I am reminded just how wonderful it is.  One friend of mine made this and called me immediatly afterwards.  She said that she and her husband agreed that they had never eaten anything this good in a Chinese restaurant before!

Too strong as written.  Taking the advice of other reviewers, I cut the
sugar down to 1/2 a cup.  But it was still a bit sweet for me and overall
the whole sauce was way too strong.  (The flavors are right though.)  I
needed to mix it in with a ton of rice to make it balanced.  Next time
I'll cut the sauce mixture down to 2/3rds or 1/2, perhaps adding a little
chicken broth if it needs diluting in order to cover the chicken and the
rice.  With this change, it'll probably be a decent though not exceptional
four star recipe.

This was pretty good. My husband liked it also, that's always a good indicator of a praiseworthy dish. I decreased the vinegar a bit, omitted the celery and water chestnuts, used two whole bell peppers, and thickened it using a cornstarch and water mixture rather than flour. Will probably make it into my regular rotation of recipes. Thanks for a keeper!

I made this dish before I read any reviews. I have learned not to do that again, because if I had, I would have known that the sauce has way too much vinegar.  It was good, but not what I dreamed it would be after all of my slicing and dicing (I added lots of other veggies).

So excellent!  I followed previous suggestions and only used 1/3 c. of vinegar and the sauce was just right.  The thing I like about this recipe is that you can throw in any vegetables you like and it still tastes wonderful.  I also served over brown rice to up the nutritional content.

I had to give it a 3 b/c I liked it but it was a little too sweet, and my boyfriend could only eat a little b/c he said it was way too sweet for him.  I would recommend reducing the amount of brown sugar to reduce the sweetness of the dish.

I didn't enjoy this recipe at all and would never make it again.  I am giving it three stars because it was easy to prepare and my boyfriend did like it however he would never have me make it again!

It's really good, but a little sweet.  I think you could use less brown sugar

I made this recipe for dinner this evening, it is definitely a keeper.  I just added some baby carrots quartered for color.  The taste was amazing, my 7 year old grandson even enjoyed it. this will become  a regular recipe in my collection.

I thought this was way too sweet. However, my hubby and son loved it and told me it was a keeper recipe. I did mix 1/4 c. catsup with 2 Tbl corn starch to thicken as recommended by others. I followed the rest of recipe as written.

I made a couple of changes and it was fabulous.  I used a package of frozen popcorn chicken (walmart brand and baked according to directions) and I skipped the listed veggies and used a frozen chinese mix of veggies (cooked of course).  I held back on some of the pinapple to make room for all the vegetables and chicken.  It was so easy and quick I will make this again and again.

We thought this was really good!  Everyone, kids included really enjoyed it.   I think I would decrease the sugar next time.  I did decrease the vinegar qty - as others suggested.  The can of pineapple I bought was only 14oz, so I added OJ to make up the difference.  We will do this again.

This is so good!! I was upset that there weren't any leftovers for lunch the next day. I followed the common advice in the reviews and used corn starch to help thicken the recipe.

I loved this recipe, I didn't add the pineapples or water chestnuts, and i did cut down on the vinegar. It was so good, perfect sweet and sour ratio. My hubby said it was a bit sweet but not in my opinion, i did add some broccoli with the sweet peppers and a bit of jerk sauce to cut some of the sweetness. I'm in heaven it was perfect, def  will become a staple in my cooking

Followed others suggestions and used cornstarch instead of flour. I doubled the recipe, added brocolli,and red pepper.
I made the sauce on the stovetop, then poured it over the veggies and uncooked chicken strips in the crockpot. Cooked on low 3-4 hours, added pineapple chunks last 1/2 hour. Served over brown rice and was delish! Crowd pleaser and will make again!

Was very delicious, I didn't particularly like the pineapple chunks so next time I will leave them out. I used lots of different vegetables, and the water chestnuts added the perfect crunch. Served it over white rice and was thoroughly enjoyed. Will make this again, maybe trying with pork next time.

This is Wonderful!!  I cubed the chicken and sauteed it in sesame oil.  Based on the 1st review I mixed 2 T. cornstarch in 3/4 C. ketchup and use that as a thickening agent instead of the 1/4 C. flour.  Used green and orange bell pepper.  Will try adding unsalted cashews next time.

This was very good!  My husband loved it, and I thought it was good as well.  I did use flour to thicken the sauce, and it worked fine, but I did have to turn up the heat a little to get it to thicken.  Very good recipe!  Thanks!

It was a big hit in our house!  Even my pickiest eater liked it.  I didn't change much except to add a pack of frozen stir fry veggies which I thawed  first.  I put them in the sauce to warm through, then added the chicken.  It didn't get as thick as I would have liked so I just added the rice in at the end, mixed all up and served.  I will make again!

Just tried this recipe for the first time tonight.  It was really just perfect!  I baked 2 lbs of boneless skinless chicken thighs first and stirred them in just before serving over hot rice.  Hubby and kids said this one is definitely a repeater!

This was delicious. However, I really made a lot of changes. First of all, I used drumsticks and I browned them in some oil first. I removed the chicken and added it to another pan containing the sauce mixture. I carmelized the vegetables in the first pan. (I used red, yellow and green bell peppers and onions). I let both cook for about 15 minutes, then put them together in the same pan, added the pineapple and cooked for about another 5 minutes. I too had used some extra pineapple juice. It turned out great... more like an Hawaiian dish than Chinese!

My family like this, but next time I will use less vinegar.  Probably start with half as much as is called for and add as needed.  The vinegar was a bit strong and I added more sugar and ketchup.  Needs tweeked, but definitely a keeper.  It will get added to our "Family Favorites" folder in my recipe box.

Yum!  We had this for dinner on Friday night and my husband has requested it again for tonight.  It tastes just like carryout Chinese.  I did follow the other reviewers suggestion of mixing ketchup with cornstarch and I also dipped the chicken in soy sauce and flour and cooked it some vegetable oil.  This will definitely be in our meal plan rotation!

This was fantastic. The best sweet and sour I've made. Very easy too (some of the recipes on this site were way to complicated. THis one was not). I didn't have peppers so used broccoli and onions. Everyone in my family loved it. Served with brown rice.

I have tried many many variations of Sweet & Sour. I have finally found THE ONE! I had to change it up a bit as I only had 10 oz of pineapple chunks so I substituted a 10 oz can of mandarin oranges juice pack. I also took another cooks suggestion and used the cornstarch mixed in with the ketchup and omitted the flour.  I added big chunks of sweet onion also. My husband isn't a hugs "Sweet & Sour" fan but he loved this! I will definitely keep this one in my Recipe Box.

This was fast and easy.  My 6 year old liked it (which is always hit or miss).  I did reduce the vinegar (and used apple cider) and brown sugan, and made the thickening sauce from 3/4 c. ketchup and 2 TBLS cornstarch.  I tossed the chicken with teriyaki sauce before stir-frying.  I WILL make this again.

This is the best recipe ever for sweet and sour!  I've been making one very close to it for years.  I use cornstarch rather than flour, I just prefer it to flour.  Just mix it in well with the brown sugar before you add it and it is always going to be lump free.  I also serve with a lot of rice and I also like to sometimes use round steak cut into strips rather than chicken.  As far as the veggies go you can pretty much change them up for whatever your family likes and it still turns out great.  Very good.

I made the recipe as written, other than seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper before frying it in olive oil.  The sauce was delicious!!  As another reviewer suggested, whisk in the flour a bit at a time and it won't get clumpy.

First time making Sweet & Sour Chicken. My husband likes it & I could take it or leave it. This sounded easy & we had the ingredients on hand. It was VERY good. I will make this again. Thanks Sal

I loved this recipe.
At first, I thought the flour was going to stay lumped, but overtime it blended well.  
I left it on the stove a little long but thinned it with water and it was still great.

This is by far the best sweet and sour anything recipe I've tried, and I've tried several.  I changed up the vegetable a bit and used red pepper, onion, celery and then the pineapple.  The vegetables don't really matter though because it's all about the flavor of the delicious sauce.  It's alse very easy to make.  I did thicken with corn starch instead of flour and disolved it in like an 1/8 cup of vinegar and 1/8 soy sauce do it wouldn't water it down if I desolved it in water.  I'd do it that way again, or perhaps with chicken stock.  To cook the chicken, I rough cut three large breads and sauteed them in about a tablespoon of butter and that's it.  You can make it all in one pan if you sautee the chicken first and then set aside and make the sauce in the same pan.  I used a stovetop wok and it worked perfectly.  Thanks so much for the post.  I'm going to try it with meatballs next time.  YUMMY!!!

Very good. Although I accidentally chopped my peppers and celery very fine to almost a puree. It was still good. I will definitely make this again. A very fast meal. I precooked the chicken in the crockpot, so all I had left to do was sautee the veggies a little bit, make the sauce and that's it. A quick fix! YUMMMMMMMMMMMMY!

I thought this was good. The hubby and kids thought it was only ok.  I added baby corn and water chestnuts as suggested by other reviewers.  We'll be having this again even if they didn't care for it as much as me.

So far this is the only dish 6yo DS will eat from allrecipes.com and I've made quite a few dishes (including drinks). I thought it was OK but DS said it was great. My version came out a lot soupier than the pictures. I saute the chicken and peppers first and then add the sauce mixture and other vegetables. This was a first for me to use flour for a thickener (as I usually use cornstarch) and got lots of lumps, which I strained out before adding to the chicken. Will make again and DS appreciates this recipe!

YUM-O! I did not change the sauce recipe at all (ketchup? yuk!), but I did use more chicken and veggies (I used onions, peppers and broccoli), and because of that I made extra sauce (using o.j. instead of pineapple juice). It is sweet, but I don't think it's too sweet. My tip: add the flower slowly whisking constantly so that there aren't any lumps. Awesome over brown rice!!

As others have noted, I thought this was a tad on the sweet side, but I did add 2/3 c ketchup which served to both thicken and enhance the flavor.  I added all varieties of peppers, which colored the dish.  The prep time is deceiving.  I thought it took significantly more time, because unless you buy cooked chicken you need to allow for the chicken cooking time and the chopping of chicken and vegetables.  All in all a good meal.

When I tasted the sauce when it was cooking I thought it would be way too strong, but once it was mixed with the chicken, veggies, and rice it was perfect. I coated the chicken in flour and also added broccoli. I will be making this again for sure.

Wow! I wasn't sure about trying to make my own Sweet and Sour, and I saw some recipes with tomato sauce, and that didn't sound like something I wanted, so i tried this recipe, and I am not dissapointed.  This is by far the best sweet and sour I've ever had. I didn't add much pineapple chunks, and I measured the ingredients by eye.  I recommend this to everyone.

I cut back the vinegar to 1/4 cup the second time and the sauce was much better.  I used pork for this and it was good.  Added some broccoli as well.

This was wonderful and so easy to make.  I 1/2ed the recipe and it make plenty.  I used cider vineger instead of regular.  This is something I will make again and I will make it often.  I don't think that there was a speck left on anyones plate at the end of the meal!

Excellent recipe, though a little too sweet for my personal palate. I used a real pineapple rather than canned, so I had to guess at the amount of juice, but it made for a fantastic presentation. I'll probably use less sugar next time, though.

Simple recipe, I had more than 1lb of chicken, so I altered the recipe. I prefer to use fresh pineapple, we let it ripen, cut up & get juice. Added a shake or two of soy sauce, lots more fresh pineapple. Yum, will make again. Great starter recipe to develop & make your own??

This was awesome. I also used cornstarch for thickening, and substituted gluten free soya sauce, sauce was nice and smooth.  I didn’t have peppers or water chestnuts so I used sliced carrot and onion. Also when I added the pineapple I also added grapes tomatoes that we halved.  Served over white long grain rice.  It was quick and easy,tasted great and was very filling. Will be making this again for sure.

I liked it.  Super simple! I think next time I will reduce the amount of flour used. It was just a tad too thick for me and you could pretty much taste the flour.  Other than that, it will become part of my repertoire!

I used potato starch instead of flour...maybe use a very small amount next time, I used 1/4 cup and as soon as I whipped it in the whole sauce turned to a thick gooey solid! Had to add a lot of water to fix that and therefore cook the veggies and chicken separately.  Still, it turned out delicious!

I used some veggies/peppers I had already diced, and it turned out very well.  A bit to sweet for me, so next time I won't add sugar...thinking just the pineapple with juice will be enough.

I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband liked it a lot.  In fact,  the left overs (which I intended to serve tonight) were gone when I awakened this morning.  So either Hubby ate a lot of Sweet and Sour Chicken 11 as I slept, or a very hungry ghost has taken up residence in my refrigerator.  
We both agreed, though, that it was a bit too sweet for our taste.  So next time I make it I think I'll cut the brown sugar in half.  And....there will most certainly be a next time.

Followed the recipe as is, minus the celery ( personal preference) This is a different sweet and sour than i'm used to but I LOVED the flavor! Will make again,  my husband who refuses to eat homemade Chinese food went back for seconds. Keeping this recipe!

This was so easy, versatile and good!  It is as delicious as any restaurant dish.....REALLY!  I very quickly stir fried some onion, broccoli, thinly sliced carrots and peppers once the sauce was done and the chicken was browned and cooked through. Then I added veggies and served over rice before they got soft. To the sauce I added about 1/4 tsp each of minced garlic and ginger, and a squirt of ketchup. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch. Mmmm mmm good. Use pork or even store bought meatballs.

This was so GOOD. Instead of flour, I used corn starch and   adjusted the vinegar and soy to 1/3 instead of 1/4 cup . I also added minced garlic, and ground ginger along with sesame seeds. This was good enoughfor company and I will added it to the line up.

I really enjoyed this. I used the same  ingredients listed in the recipe except for lite soy sauce. What I did do differently was to cook the veggies separately for just a few minutes, so they were still crunchy but not raw. I had a little leftover rice and a small baggie of noodles in the freezer, so I got the noodles and husband got the rice. Delicious both ways.

Simple and effective - and more importantly, super tasty. I did cut back on the sugar as I'm not a fan of overly sweet but the proportions of sweet, salty & acid worked very well. Definitely making this again ... and again ... and again. Thanks!

Very easy and tastes great.  Kids and husband ate it up.  I used an extra chicken breast, and would therefore consider doubling the sauce to have some extra.  Also added cashews instead of water chestnuts.  Will make again.

I have made this sweet & sour chicken several times now and enjoyed it every time.  I modify the recipe a bit to match my family's tastes.  I don't use the celery and water chestnuts.  Instead, I add onion cut into about 3/4 inch wide pieces.  My step-sons are very picky, especially with Chinese food, and they love it when I make this sweet & sour chicken.

Made this for company and my only changes were to stir fry  the chicken first,  otherwise it wouldn't be the least bit crispy.  Then I also stir fried the veggies, added back the chicken and poured the sauce over and heated to thicken.  Also added 1/2 cup of cashews (hubby loves).  It was delicious and I will make again.

Way too sweet and very unappealing looking. I made as recipe states but added 1 cooked sliced carrot, about 1/4 c diced red pepper, 1/4c diced onion & 1 clove minced garlic.

This is a delicious sweet and sour chicken recipe. I was skeptical reading the ingredient list with all the brown sugar it called for and the thought that it could be too sweet. I followed the recipe as written and it was incredibly tasty. In fact my family liked it so well that this will be our go to for some great sweet and sour chicken. The next time I do make this for my loved ones I will add some ketchup and use cider vinegar. I will also add a touch of fresh garlic to the mix. Overall this recipe is hands down, five star good! 
Thanks so much for sharing it.

The ratio of ingredients has some issues. I had to double the sauce recipe in order to make it work. Way too much chicken and too little on the Vegies, especially water chestnuts. I added wasabi and sriracha sauce to get some flavor. Could benefit from a little garlic, onion, as well as ginger. Also added pepper and a pinch of salt.

So good! Even my pickiest eater liked it. I omitted the celery, I used one red and one green bell pepper. Also added a cubed yellow onion. I agreed with another reviewer as all sweet and sour sauces I have tried have been red, I also added the 3/4C ketchup and substituted cornstarch for the flour. The sauce was thick and delicious. Will not use any other recipes now. AND... It was even better the next day!

yes I will definitely make this again! I added the 1/4 cup ketchup that others suggested and I was glad that I did. I only used 1/4 cup vinegar however next time I'm going to use the 1/2 cup that the recipe calls for. My family loved this meal!

This was very good! I made a half recipe, using frozen multi-colored pepper strips that I had on hand (would increase the amount the next time). Per some of the recommendations, I used corn starch in place of the flour, dissolving it an equal amount of ketchup. I did find the celery to be a little hard, so also next time, I would saute the celery for a few minutes beforehand, maybe adding some onion slices, as well. I used apple cider vinegar and also added garlic and onion powder. Skipped the water chestnuts because I don't usually have them on hand. Served with jasmine rice that I made in my rice cooker. Thanks for the great recipe, Sal, that came together fairly quickly.

My family and I loved this!  I used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar, unbleached flour to thicken, and I did use shredded pineapple in a can and it turned out just fine, but I love pineapple.  I didn't mind it not being red, the taste was amazing! Served over rice,  yum!

Good recipe. I made the sauce a bit too thick, not sure the exact resolution... probably less flour, but the flavor was very good. We will probably make it less sweet next time as well (less brown sugar).

My family really liked it! Omitted the celery and water chesnuts. As a few reviewers noted, i added 2 tbsp corn starch and 3/4 ketchup to the sauce, omitting the flour. Added 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. Used a pack of diced tri-color peppers. I used 2 lbs of chicken tenderloins, each one cut into 3 (to make bite sized pieces). I dredged them in flour and fried in a bit or corn oil until light golden brown before adding to sauce. That helped the sauce stay on the chicken.  I have to say there was sooo much sauce. I almost doubled it since i had more chicken than the recipe called for. (Next time i will use like 1.5 lbs chicken and half the sauce.)  Served over white rice. Yum.

I was looking for a recipe to use some leftover chicken and came across this.  Loved it!  I omitted the celery and will add broccoli next time, as others have suggested.  The sauce was so tasty - very glad I found this - thanks for posting!

I was really impressed how well this recipe turned out. I was surprised at how easy it was and how delicious it came out. I made it for my brother and me.The only downside was that I used white wine vinegar because that is what I had and I think it made the vinegar flavor too strong. Next time, I will use regular vinegar and less of it. Great recipe!

This was delicious!  I used cider vinegar as recommended by another reviewer and about 1 TB of lemon ginger balsamic vinegar. I scaled it to 3 servings, but next time, I'm going to make the full amount, because I want leftovers.

Easy and excellent!  I sauteed the vegetables (added onions, carrots and red bell peppers, deleted celery) before adding to sauce.  To novice cooks (like me!):  I used 2T cornstarch instead of flour - it took a while for the sauce to thicken - increasing heat to simmer helps (I mention this because I needed my sis to coach me on the sauce!).  Good advice from previous posts of adding cornstarch to small amount of the sauce before adding to the pan.  Also loved the idea of using the rotisserie chicken... I'll definitely make this again!

DELICIOUS is all I can say. My family loved it. The only thing different I did was add some garlic and onion powder. I do think it needed that, as it gave it more flavor. My family begged me to make it again soon, so I guess this will become a regular staple in our house!

Excellent recipe!  The sauce was a good light flavor.  I loved that it called for plain, unbreaded chicken.  I made two changes: 1-orange juice instead of pineapple juice(I was trying to use up some fresh pineapple in the fridge so there was no juice) and 2-I only had red peppers on hand and it gave the dish a good burst of color with the green celery and yellow pineapple.  This is going to be a staple in our home! Thanks!

This was delicious.  Next time I will use more vegetables - broccoli, carrots, edamame...  Also the pineapple was too sweet in the sauce.  I would put it on top as a garnish or leave it out altogether (not the juice, just the chunks)

I had this recipe a long time ago, but lost my recipe book. I could remember the ingredients but not the amounts to use. This recipes is exactly like the one I lost except it uses flour instead of cornstarch. I got rave reviews when I made this. Instead of chestnuts and celery I used a green and a red pepper. Next time, I might try different vegetables like broccoli and snap peas.

This was a quick and easy meal and tasted great!! I did add ketchup as others recommended and used 1/4 cup vinegar and 1/4 cup of water instead of the full 1/2 cup of vinegar.  I also didn't add water chestnuts because I didn't have any. Thank you for this recipient, I will definitely be making it again!

Great recipe! My husband and son loved this one as well. I took the advice of others and traded the flour for 2 tbs of cornstarch.  I served it over white rice and also added broccoli and red bell pepper which gave it some great color (and flavor).  I think next time we'll try it with shrimp instead of chicken, but either way, this one is a keeper.

Today I made the recipe and my family and I enjoyed this delicious and heavenly dish!!  I read other reviews.  I just only added 1/2 cup of ketcup and reduced down to 1/2 cup of celery.  I followed all these ingredients.  The sauce became thickened!.  I grilled the chicken before I chopped them and stirred them in the sauce sauepan.  It smelled so sweet!  Next time I will make half of floured chicken and grilled chicken separately because my 5-year-old girl wanted the floured chicken.  The sauce tasted the exact flavor from Chopsticks restarant!!  That is what I desperately looked for many many many years!!   Thank you very much, Sal!!!  This recipe is in my box!!   You should win this recipe!

I have not made this yet. I was really appreciative that cornstarch was recommended instead of flower. My youngest daughter has a wheat allergy and it is a challenge to adapt recipes

Excellent s&s sauce -- thankfully, not as coyingly sweet as some. Good consistency and easy to make. Definitely a "keeper"

This recipe slays it with everyone I make it for!  Follow SUSANJOANNE's suggestion with the corn starch and ketchup and your golden.  Also I add a variety of veggies other than listed. Mushrooms, baby corns, onions, red and yellow bell peppers, in addition to whats listed already.

Excellent recipe.  The only thing I might cut back on is the brown sugar.  It was a little bit too sweet.  I made it with red pepper, water chestnuts, peanuts and served it over rice.  Delicious and very easy!

The sauce was PERFECT!  The reason I rated it 4 stars is because we don't care for celery.  We used 1 red pepper, 1 green pepper, and a head of broccoli with 1 lb. of chicken.  We also used crushed pineapple instead of chunks because that's what we had on hand.  Served it over brown rice...Delicious!  I plan on adding this to our regular menu rotation.  Thanks, Sal!

Awesome recipe.  I came home this evening having no idea what I was going to make for dinner, but had a taste for sweet and sour chicken.  This was quick and easy and tasted GREAT!  I did use the ketchup and cornstarch tip that another review mentioned.  This is a keeper

Delish!  My hubby was very hesitant about eating this dish because the chicken was fried and battered.  However, once he tried it, he found that he liked it quite well.  I will definitely be making this again in the future.

Very easy and very good.
Because I didn't have green pepper and water chestnuts around I used carrots with the pineapple and chicken.
I tossed the chicken in some flour seasoned with salt and pepper and threw that in the pot first to brown.  Then I pulled it out and made the sauce using only 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a couple squirts of ketchup.  I thickened it with flour and water because I'm out of cornstarch at the moment.
It was a great dinner.  Very easy to make and will make again!

OhhMyyy I just love this recipe. I added yellow, red and orange peppers and a carrot along with all the stuff called for. I used left over chicken nuggets cut up from McDonalds instead of the chicken strips because my silly husband thought buying a 50 pack would be yummy for SuperBowl Sunday. Needless to say they didn't get eaten and I didn't want to waste them. I did everything else the same. The sauce is what made this. I couldn't believe how great it tasted.(because I made it). sal this is a great recipe.
p.s. If you are making this and think after you add the veggies that you need more sauce, wait! I saw how full the pan was and started to make another batch of the sauce so I would have enough for the chicken. But after simmering just a couple of minutes and then dumping the chicken in it was fine. I couldn't believe it, even with the extra veggies I added it was a perfect amount. I will be serving this over rice(even though hubby hates rice) and see how everyone likes it. :)

This was my first time making sweet and sour chicken. I fried my chicken with a liquid batter and I used the cornstarch, apple cider vinegar and ketchup. It was really good and the kids loved it.

Thought it was pretty good!  I used stirfry veggies instead of the suggested veggies.  Sauce is thick and a littel goes along way with the rice.  Some suggested to make a lot of rice with it and that is true!  I will make it again.

I've never met a sweet and sour sauce I didn't like, but neither I, nor my very open-minded husband liked this.  It was very strong, but not in a good kind of way.  We ended up eating everything else and just throwing away the sauce.

Really easy to put together and good taste.  I've also made this one with a vegetarian sausage instead of chicken.  Very nice.

I serve with a basmati or a jamine rice.

I tried making this dish with a few alterations based on reviewers' suggestions: started with the reserved pineapple juice, 1/4 c. soy sauce, 1/4 c. vinegar, about 1/2 c. brown sugar and ketchup to taste. The result was so disgusting that I wanted to throw it out and start over, but I didn't have any more pineapple juice. My hubby added about 3/4 c. white grape peach juice that we had on hand, and that made a world of difference. Then I mixed in 2 t. hot chile paste (since we like things spicy) and we wound up with a wonderful sauce. 
I would suggest stir-frying the veggies until crisp/tender and then the chicken until almost ready and then adding the sauce and simmering for a few minutes. I also added one onion, cut in larger chunks. With the variations, I would give it a 4.

Wow this is so good I make it a lot now. It is however very sweet I think I will not use so much pineapple next time since it overpowers the dish to me.

After reading the reviews, I stuck to the Sweet and Sour Sauce I recipe because I had tried it already and liked it. Though, even in that one, I made some changes such as using the pineapple juice along with bits of crushed pineapple instead of water and also adding more ketchup. Instead of peppers and chestnuts which I didn't have, I just added some frozen peas and carrots. I served this over rice and made homemade egg rolls to go with it. My husband and I loved it!

This was a super, quick recipe.  I didn't use the water chesnuts as I don't care for them and I didn't have any celery on hand or I would have used it.  I used the frozen, honey-battered Tyson chicken nuggets, baked them according to the box directions while I was putting the sauce together, and added them to the sauce when it was done.  Excellent! (and fast, too!)  I'll definitely make this again.

Nice flavor, easy to make, a big hit served over rice.  I too used red bell pepper instead of the green.  I also added sliced carrots.

Yum! The only thing I changed was to cook the veggies a bit in a separate pan before adding to the sauce. As other reviewers noted, you could definitely substitute or add whatever veggies your family prefers. Even my husband, who dislikes all asian food, loved this! A keeper!

GREAT! My kids gobbled it up! I added red bell pepper instead of green, added carrots, and broccoli. Omitted the chestnuts and celery. I'll try snow peas next time as well.  Lots of great color and taste. I did not add as much chicken since I loaded up on veggies.

Awesome recipe! I've made it several times always to great reviews.  I used broccoli, carrots and onions in place of water chestnuts and celery because it's what I usually have on hand. Great as leftovers as well!

I followed the recipe exactly and my family gave me rave reviews.  Quick and easy, this fits the bill when we crave Chinese food, but don't feel like getting take-out.

Neither my husband or I were thrilled with this recipe. It was a little too sour for us, and we thought the chicken either needed to be seasoned or fried first. However, it was very easy to prepare. Thanks anyway.

I wasn't that keen on it due to not really being a fan of sweet and sour sauce.  However, I cooked it for my Mother, and she said it was very good.  It wasn't too strong and had an authentic flavour.

1/29/04  I served this Sweet & Sour Chicken to 12 at the Senior Apts. where I live.  I added sliced carrots and  served it over rice.  It was a big hit with them.  We have a Cook 'N Eat Dinner every Thursday night and usually have between 12-15 attend.  The meal costs them $3.00.

Excellent flavor. I added this to my menu!  Not quite a "one-skillet dish" if your chicken isn't pre-cooked but definitely worth it still!

Yum! This was an easy and delicious dish.  There was plenty of sauce, which tasted great over rice. My boyfriend usually doesn't like fruit mixed with meat, but even he enjoyed it.  Very tasty!
