11.18.17  This pilaf has a harmonious balance of savory and sweet.  You first taste the savoriness of the unique spices,  next comes the sweetness of the raisins and pineapple, then you get nice crunch from the almonds.  Thoroughly enjoyed this, wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.   Just follow the instructions, and you'll have an outstanding rice pilaf.   Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very good! Skipped the pineapple because I'm allergic, but added carrot and celery for a little extra crunch will definitely use again.
