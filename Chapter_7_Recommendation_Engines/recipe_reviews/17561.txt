This was great! I do have a couple of suggestions. I put S/P & Cumin on the steaks and seared the meat for about 1-1/2 minutes on both sides over a high heat in a pan with a little oil. I put them in my crock pot and spread some sliced onions, zucchini, red pepper and green peppers over the meat. Here is the clincher - I put a 16 oz jar of Peach Pineapple Salsa all over that. NO Water -you get enough liquid from the salsa. I cooked them on High for 2-1/2 hours. Oh my heavens does it taste good. It really tasted that good. Be bold and try a different type of salsa, if you like eating it on chips, you should like it in this recipe. I made rice to go with it - awesome.

I wanted to do something different with cube steaks than the usual gravy or swiss steak and this fit the bill.  Easy with few ingredients.  I eliminated the peppers because they don't agree with members of the family.  I added a can of mushrooms and also browned the meat first before putting it in the baking dish.  If your store sells the Black Angus cube steaks, I recommend getting those as they are usually more tender. I also didn't add any additional liquid.  I topped it with some monterrey jack cheese in the last five minutes. I served this with black beans and rice.  Very easy and delicious, I will make this again.

Very quick, easy & tasty!  I added shredded cheddar cheese on top after baking...yummy!  My husband & 2 yr old loved it.  My husband doesn't like rice so I served with baked fries.

VERY GOOD!  Didn't add any water...the salsa provided plenty of liquid.  Hubby gave it the thumbs up, which means it's a keeper/add-it-to-the-recipe-book-good.  Even my picky 5 year old thanked me for "this yummy food".

Just an additional note.  The second time I made this dish, I misestimated the amount of cubed steak I had.  I didn't have enough for the whole family!  So I added boneless, skinless chicken breast to the pan and covered it as instructed.  Delicious!  So this recipe works with chicken also!

Recommend it highly.  Medium salsa seemed light on this - the kids didn't mention any spice.

This was a fantastic quick dinner.  The only thing I did differently was I sprinkled Roasted garlic and Red Bell Pepper seasoning over the peppers and onions, then topped with pineapple salsa.  Next time I will top with some cheddar or jack cheese the last 10 minutes or so.  A very well received dinner.  Thanks Tracie!

I tried this recipe last night for my family. It was quick and very easy. It tasted real good. So I have chose to keep this recipe. I served with Mashed Potatos instead of Rice.

When I first ready this recipe I didn't understand how this simple combination of ingredients could have so many stars....but I had all the ingredients on hand and decided to give it a shot. We were all pleasantly surprised at how GOOD they were. I am definitely making these again!

Very tasty recipe! The most tender cube steaks I've ever had. I did not add any water and I am glad I didn't. There is alot of liquid after cooking. I may not add extra onion or pepper next time. A nice change to the usual cube steak recipes.

Although there is a lot of sauce, you could serve this in a taco, which we did, and ate them as a sort of fajita. Note: if you're trying this, do not use soft tacos, as they get soggy and easily fall apart. Left out the green pepper because of my allergy. Overall not too bad, will probably just try over Spanish rice next time.

I did not like this recipe much.  We like hot foods, so we used hot salsa, but once it was added with the onion and green pepper, it was way too hot, and we could not eat them.

This was good but it's definitely not for my kids.  I put mild salsa but we are so used to eating chicken and fish that we have to get used to the texture of this.  I would make it again.

Sprinkled with pepper and cumin and omitted the salt. Quick pan fried the cube steaks first and didn't add any extra water. Medium hot salsa and these turn out so tender!  I've made this one a few times and always very good!  Thanks!

This was very tasty.I used mild salsa. It definately has a zing though. We had it over rice. It was a hit with adults, it had a bit too much spice for the kids. I will make this again.

My husband and son enjoyed this recipe. After I cooked the steaks there was some water left over in the pan, I then added cooked rice to the steak and cooked until the water was gone. This was delicous. Will make this recipe again.

I thought it was a good easy recipe, but my husband wasn't crazy about it. It definitely benefits from cheddar cheese on top. I'll probably stick with my usual cube steak recipe.

I followed all the instructions except for the bell pepper and hubby though it tasted like cube steak topped with picante sauce.  Just blah.

The next time I make this I'll use the thickest salsa I can find and/or drain off some of the salsa juice. The meat cooks fast so be careful to not overcook it like me. For me it's only 4 stars but my son would give it a 5. I will make it again.

Followed directions closely except put a little picante sauce on bottom of pan first. A zippy twist on cube steaks for those who enjoy Tex-Mex fare.

What an easy recipe..All I did was season the meat per the recipe and poured salsa on top. Homemade salsa at that! I had some leftover rice and added it to the juice towards the end of cooking...Very good. My skeptical husband even liked it! will keep this one around.

Great recipe!!  I left out the Green Peppers(due to not having any on hand) and it was great.  I served with "Rice A Roni - Spanish Rice"  Whole family Liked it (which is rare)  Thanks for the recipe.  What a change for Cube Steak!!

Tasty!!  I didn't have the green pepper, but it was really great anyway.  I'm always looking for ways to use cube steak and this is a keeper!  I made it with the Simple Mexican Rice and a veg! YUM!

I used bottom round steaks instead of cubes and cooked them for an hour. As others suggested, added cheese after I took the foil off, and cooked for another minute to melt it. Delicious, easy to prepare and can be made at the same time you are using the oven for something else. Just reheat in the micro and it's still wonderful!

I would give this recipe five stars,but my husband said four! These were absolutely delicious!!! Very tender! I used garlic pepper, seasoned salt, and a little chilli powder to season the cube steaks. For salsa, I used mild salsa. I did not use green peppers because they are not a favorite here. I baked the steaks for about an hour and out cheese on top of each steak as soon as I took them out of the oven (the cheese melted). I served with Dirty Rice and Corn. I will definately fix these again. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

This dish seems to be a good use of cube steak.  The overall flavor is very easily manipulated due to the possible use of a wide variety of salsas. Something to experiment with!

This recipe wasn't bad, but the sauce was pretty runny, due to the salsa and water. There wasn't much to really soak it up in the recipe.

This is a good old fashion spicy dish. Well I added hot salsa and some hot sauce. WOW did it have some kick to it. I left out the pepper, not really into the whole pepper taste. Did lots of onions and added some onion powder. This is a good dish that is quick and easy for the summer time.

Great hit with hubbie...just left off the Salsa for the finicky kids!  Because it is baked in the oven, you can tailor the toppings for whomever your baking for.  Will use this recipe again!

I make homemade salsa so I omitted the bell pepper and onion. I cooked it on the stove rather than in the oven. I browned the steaks first, drained the oil and added the salsa. Wasn't bad and we might have it again.

Remember: Regardless of the way you cook this, almost all the flavoring comes from the salsa, so be careful what you choose!

Easy to make and yummy.  Meat was very tender and tasty.  I used 1/2 onion, no bell pepper, and no water.  It was delicious and I will make again.  The clean up was a breeze since everything was in one pan.

I didn't like this at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and the cube steaks shrunk up and were very chewy, not tender at all.  I'm not sure why they turned out that way.  Maybe cooking them at a lower temp for a longer time would help, but I won't be trying this again.

What a great way to "spice up" cube steaks!  I followed the recipe as is, because I think it is perfect.  Thanks for the great idea.  It definitely turned a potentially bland meal into a "wow!" meal.

I made this tonight; hubby loved it.  I liked how quick and easy it was to make.  I didn't have cumin so I used a bit of Emerill's Southwest essence.  I also used a jar of peach salsa (which I picked up last week on sale--first time I've tried it!)  The blend of flavors over rice was fantastic.  BTW, I only used 1/2 of the onion (hubby is not too fond of them).  Anyway, this goes into my permanent recipe box to be served again and again.

The cube steaks turned out very tender, which I didn't expect. I served them with fried potatoes, as DH doesn't like rice. This was a much more flavorful way to prepare cube steaks than my standard mushroom soup gravy dish.  I'll be adding this recipe to our regular rotation!

This recipe was a nice change from how I usually cook cube steaks.  I've always made them using Cream of Mushroom soup as a base for gravy.  I didn't have any Cumin on hand, so I used Taco Seasoning instead.  Worked great!  Also, I added shredded cheese on top after it was done cooking as one review suggested.  Was very good!  Very quick and easy too.  I will make this again.

It’s very good, I substituted cumin by using garlic powder and chili powder which complimented the salsa. I did not have green peppers, and used red instead as well. Covered with Mexican cheese at the last 10 minutes to melt evenly. Moist, flavorful and definitely filling to enjoy at any time. Definitely will have this recipe more often!

I love this recipe. I have been making it for years. My Dad made it a long time ago and I looked up the recipe and found it here.  It’s a favorite at our house. You can switch it up and use different salsas and peppers. If you like it hot substitute hot rotel tomatoes in place of the salsa. Mmmmm deliciousness!!

This tastes good.  It was quick, easy, and inexpensive.  The steak is pretty tough though and there is a LOT of liquid in the bottom of the pan even though I didn't add any extra water.  I removed the steaks, put the cooked rice into the liquid, put the steaks back on top, and stuck it back into the oven for another ten minutes.  I shall chop the leftover steaks, stir them into the rice, and use them in burritos or something, I think.
I made this again and it didn't turn out nearly as runny.  I assume it was because of the brand of salsa I used.  I discovered, this time, that adding some pepperoncini to my plate made this a LOT better.  My husband likes to add sour cream and cheese to his.

Easy to make. I took a extra step and soaked the beef in eggs & milk overnight. The beef was able to be cut with a fork. Also added shredded cheese & used fresh salsa. Came out great.

I did not do this recipe exactly, as I did not have enough salsa to cover the meat, onions, and peppers in the pan. I mixed salsa, fire-roasted diced tomatoes, and spicy honey BBQ sauce from Kraft. I also seasoned the meat with garlic, salt, pepper and pan seared it first. But, the recipe was super easy and fairly quick, and I should have made more since everyone liked it in my family.

Add a little cheese, serve with rice & beans, and you've got a family meal!  I bet this would be great with chicken as well.  Advice:  EASY on the water, and lightly brown the cube steak in butter before baking.  Enjoy!!

I used spanish rice. It went together really good.   Only thing is i would prefer is the peppers and onions be smaller.  I'll prob chop them next time.   Shredded co-jack gave it a lil extra too.

Good recipe. You dont need to add water, as the salsa makes plenty of liquid.  I also added garlic powder and chili powder to the cube steak.  I broiled some cheese on top for the last few minutes.

Yummy and quick recipe for cube steak! I forgot to add water and I'm glad; the fresh salsa I used added plenty of liquid. Because we love garlic I would add a bit next time.  I served it over rice, with a salad on the side.

I fixed this Saturday and it was very good. Adding the water may not have been necessary and next time I think I'll use a hot-style salsa to give it a little more kick. Don T.

I liked the recipe. I used half onion and next time I will use half a green pepper.  I added onion powder to the meat. Do not add water, too much liquid. I also had to cook mine to an hour.  My husband said it reminded him carne guisada. I think I might try beef stew meat with this recipe. All and all its a keeper.

These were good. I only cooked mine for 40 minutes and they were a little tougher then I would have liked so will def cook them longer next time. Great flavor. Added cheese over the top of them at the end and baked until it was melted.

This was a delicious new way to prepare cube steak. I found that I had to cook mine for an hour, but it was still very tender. Perhaps I'll use thinner cuts of cube steak next time? The flavors were very good and may have been better if it were marinated, but I guess it depends on what kind of salsa you use as well. Will be making this again and playing around with the recipe to find that perfect balance of flavor and tenderness. Thanks so much!

I never had cube steak before this and was thinking it was going to be ok nothing great. Wow I was wrong! This is my first time commenting because of this recipe! It's simple and excellent! I added peach & pineapple salsa and pepper jack cheese with no additional water per another reviewers suggestion! We were shocked at how good it was!

A family favorite!! You won't fry cube steaks again after trying this. However, the only change I made is that I added a cut up red pepper and did not use the cumin.

This was very good! Only thing just like other review's is that it was very watery. I would change it so it wasn't so watery. Other wise very good! I did top it with cheese which gave it that finished taste! Served with green beans and mashed potatoes.

Oh my this was so good. I took the advice from some of the other posts. Sprinkled garlic powder with the cumin. I had some of those cute little peppers that I sliced up with the grn pep. I did not add water, there was gracious plenty without it. Baked it for 1 hr, sprinkled Colbyjack shredded cheese over it the last 10 min. Served it over yellow rice (made like the package with a little dollop of sour cream stirred in for yumminess) Thickened the sauce with a little corn starch & water served it over all. Roasted asparagus on the side....my family's tongues were slappen' the top of their heads it was so good! Thx Tracie!

A bit spicy for us, so I'd either use less cumin or lower octane salsa (I used medium).  But it was delicious and just what I was looking for!

A nice way to use cube steaks. I marinated my steaks in the salsa for a couple of hours before cooking, and I think the salsa helped to tenderize it. I would definitely not add water, because cooking these covered keeps a lot of moisture in it already, it seemed to be too watery to me.

My oven is broken, so I took another reviewer's suggestion, and prepared this in the crock-pot.  I used peach/pineapple salsa and onions and green peppers.  The meat was nice and tender, but I thought the flavor was just ordinary.  Maybe it would be better if baked.  My husband really liked this, but I wasn't crazy about it.  Thanks anyway.

Oh my, what a fantastic recipe. The meat was tender, the sauce had just the right amount of kick for my taste and it was out of this world on the white rice. Made sting beans out of my garden and what a meal.Omitted the peppers because I didn't have any on hand and added cheese on top. Used half mild and half medium salsa. Gotta love the one pan recipes. It's a keeper. Thanks Tracie for sharing the recipe.

I'm not sure why this receip got such great reviews.  I followed the recipe and the meat was tough.  I might attempt again but this time I'll cook at a lower temp for a longer period of time.

This was an easy meal. Everyone even my 5 year old liked it. I did change a few things though. First I marinated the steaks in garlic and olive oil then when I cooked the steak I browned them on each side before putting them in the oven. I used mild salsa since we were feeding the kids and they were not spicy at all. This will be made at my house again.

We liked this one and I will make it again. However, I didn't like the cummin, so will go with just the salsa next time. Curry might be an alternative if more spicy taste is needed. It's a good, quick dinner.

Very good - would really give it 4 and a half-found the cumin a bit strong for me but I find it strong all the time and always cut down.  Perhaps mixing it with the salsa might help.  I used all red pepper but think I will try it with half green and half red.  I liked the fact that the cube steaks really did get tender - they have always been tough the way I previously prepared them so I never bought them.   I did cook it a lot longer though-an hour plus.  My other half really liked it too.  Thanks. Will do again.

quick, easy, but not that great. Not
bad, but not great.
