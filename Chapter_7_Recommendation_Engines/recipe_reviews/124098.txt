This was delicious! I really liked the flavor from the mustard.  But there's no way only 4 eggs will hold all those vegetables together.  I used 8 eggs (well, egg substitute) and made two quiches out of this instead.  Will definitely make this again though.

A really good and healthy recipe. I agree with the other reviewer, though, who said 4 eggs wasn't enough and this was true for me when I made this. I actually used 6 large eggs, but kept everything pretty much the same. Great way to use garden veggies and make a tasty, good-for-you meal.

This combination of ingredients in scrambled eggs/omelet was something I use routinely.  The Dijon mustard, on the other hand, was completely new and foreign to me â€“ in eggs that is!  Cooked green pepper is a little strong for my tastes, so I used a mix of orange, yellow and red bell pepper.  I did cut back on the Dijon a little and for me it was just right.  I have to say it did add a kick of flavor to otherwise predictable tasting eggs.  Rather than Monterey Jack I used Asiago cheese, which was very compatible.

I halved this, using three eggs. It was cooked in a eight inch skillet on a true "medium" flame...which ended up with the extra egg taking more than 10 minutes to get it to set up, but that made a nice browning on the bottom. (not burnt). Used Cheddar because that's what we had.

I changed the way this recipe was prepared just a bit. I used one small sweet onion, yellow pepper instead of green (noone in this house likes green peppers), and I added 8 cloves of chopped garlic. I sauteed the vegetables (leaving the tomatoes out, so they wouldn't get mushy) and once they were ready, I cooled them a bit. I wisked 8 eggs with the water and dijon mustard and a little Frank's Hot Sauce (I took other reviewers suggestions and upped the eggs) and folded them in the vegetables I set aside and poured it into a greased 8x8 baking dish and sprinkled it with cheese. (I used 2% shredded sharp cheddar instead of pepper jack, that was all I had on hand.) 350* for thirty minutes and wa-la, egg omelette.....the cheater way. At serving, I sprinkled it with the chopped tomatoes. Same recipe with just a few small changes. I agree, the dijon was an awesome addition.

MMM... The dijon mustard gives it a really nice flavor! I added broccoli, garlic, and spinach. Because of my additions I had to add two more eggs. Really easy to make, too.

I omitted the green bell pepper as we aren't huge fans, and added more tomatoes instead. Four eggs is definitely not enough to hold everything together, so I threw in another two which was perfect. This was filling and pretty healthy. Thanks, Donna!
