This was good. It is a little expensive to make but good.  I did think it needed more salt than the recipe called for. I ended up adding some paprika after tasting it but it didn't end up needing it. I plan to play around with this one a bit to suit our tastes. Great recipe though and one worth making if you are vegan. It was super simple.
