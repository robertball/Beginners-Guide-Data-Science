Overall, the recipe did have nice flavor, but might need some minor tweeking. Instead of using 4 red peppers, I used 2 red peppers, a white onion, and an anaheim pepper. I couldn't find coconut milk powder, but I found coconut powder and used that. I also could not find curry leaves, so I used about 1 tsp of curry powder. I was a little confused by the recipe saying to add cayenne, when it's not on the shopping list. I assumed it meant to add the paprika. I didn't have ginger garlic paste, so I added about 1 clove of garlic and 1 tsp of fresh ginger. I also used fresh turmeric. I thought 1 whole lemon was too much considering it was already a bit bitter, so I only added the juice from half of a lemon. Maybe it's the American in me, but I thought this recipe lacked a little sweetness that I thought could bring out some other flavors. I added some white sugar and salt to taste. If I were to make again, I would consider maybe adding coconut powder to coconut milk to add some natural sweetness and additional coconut flavor.

I made this with the wife and it was delicious.  We didn't have besan flour so we used regular all-purpose and it seemed to work well.  Also couldn't find curry leaves so we looked up a recommendation of substituting it with basil and lime zest which work out well also.  We substituted the chicken with shrimp and served it over penne.  For some reason the recipe read to use cayenne pepper in the instructions but wasn't listed on the ingredients list (it read to use hot paprika).  Love it and will make it again

I added a 7oz can of green chiles and used coconut milk instead of powder and water. Because of kids I used smoked paprika (recipe calls for hot paprika, then says add cayenne pepper?). 
Needed salt and pepper. I think a saut√©ed onion would help it out.
