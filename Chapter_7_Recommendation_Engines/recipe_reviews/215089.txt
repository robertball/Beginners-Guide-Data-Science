With very minor variations (I use 2 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. baking powder and add 3/4 tsp. nutmeg) I've been using this recipe since 1982 - because it is so superior to any other. Moist, pleasantly spiced and delicious, and the addition of the pineapple, as well as the raisins and walnuts, gives this zucchini bread it's unique character.  I've always been proud to serve or gift this bread and when I do, it's not unusual that it's followed by a request for the recipe.

One loaf has been dug into with great gusto by my DH! He said it was utterly delicious, as is, then lightly toasted one slice with a dab of butter and all I could hear was the ummmmm, ummmmm's! The pineapple gives it a tangy moistness, the raisins give it the right amount of sweetness and the wonderful crunch of the walnuts makes this a keeper for all seasons!  Your timing with this recipe in the midst of a bumper crop of zucchini, was perfect.  Thank you for sharing.

The pineapple and raisins are a great touch. I "healthy-ed" it up a bit by using 2 c WW flour instead of all white flour, reducing the fat content by using unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, and reducing the sugar by 1/3. Came out very moist and yummy, and was still moist the next day (other recipes seem to dry out overnight). DH told me to be sure not to lose this one as this is his favorite zucchini bread recipe (I've tried many this season with a bumper crop of squash).

Great recipe.  Very moist cake.  I did half white flour, half whole wheat.  Half veg oil and half applesauce.  I used zucchini, pineapple, and half jar of chopped maraschino cherries leftover from another dessert.  No raisins or walnuts.  Perfect coming out of the oven after 1 hr, 5 minutes.

This is our favorite zucchini bread recipe and my family has been using it for years. Great texture (not overly moist), wonderful balance of flavors and textures and bakes up perfect everytime.
I shred the zucchini and leave it to drain for a few min in the sink while I get the rest of the ingredients together. Follwed the recipe with the exception of using dried cranberries and almonds (personal pref) in place of the raisins and walnuts. Two loaves disappeared in just a couple of days. We will continue to use this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This was great! What I love about these quick bread recipes is that you can tweak them to suit your tastes. Because I like spice I always add more vanilla, cinnamon, and then nutmeg, allspice, etc. and it still tastes great. Also in this recipe I grated more zucchini that what was called for and I used it all (about 3 cups) and the pineapple gives it extra moistness. Family and friends loved it!!

This bread always turns out great, it's always moist, and stays fresh for days.  We always a ton more zucchini (probably double).  It's great too, because you can add just about anything to it.  We've thrown in grated carrots, cranberries, blueberries, and banana!  Very versatile, tastes great, looks great!

Fantastic!  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 white whole wheat flour.  I also used the foil pans by Hefty, and the recipe was split evenly between 3 of those pans, which are on the smaller side.  Because of this, it only took 45 mins to bake.

YUM! I'm on a diet but like to have a filling, healthy snack each day, and this is it! To make it healthier (and less caloric) I used half whole wheat flour and replaced half the oil with applesauce. I also doubled the vanilla and added a dash of nutmeg. This bread will fill you for hours.

Delicious recipe, the pineapple and zucchini favors work well together.  I poured rum over it while it cooled off.  Added a nice carribean flavor to the bread.

Yummy all around.  I wish I had used golden raisins, but I don't keep them on hand.  Doubled the recipe (to use up more zucchini) and it filled 3 large loaf pans.  Maybe a coarse sugar topping would make it better.

Excellent moist and delicious.Holds together well.Used pecan pieces for nuts and currants in place of raisins (just personal pref) the toothpick method worked well for doneness, as the sweet pinapple juice makes it brown on the outside quickly....YUM

This is my favorite zucchini bread recipe.  I've been making this zucchini pineapple bread since the 70's when it first appeared in Country Women as a contest winner.  The only exception is that I put 3/4 tsp. nutmeg.

This was very good. So moist and yummy. I left out the raisins and walnuts so my daughter would eat it. Love the  pineapple in it. I think next time I might  even add a little more pineapple to it.

Made this today. LOVED IT! I sliced into it before it was completely cooled because I couldn't wait! Only thing I changed was by accident: I mistakenly used a 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple instead of 8 ounces. I used the whole can anyway since I love pineapple and it was delicious and moist. I'm making this again for sure!!

WONDERFUL BREAD!!  Used 2C white & ! C wheat flours ~ 1 t. cinnamon 1/2 t. nutmeg & 1/4 t. ground cloves.  Only 1 Cup white sugar and 1/2 Cup brown sugar ~ 3/4 C oil & 1/4 C applesauce & full teaspoon vanilla.  Two smallish zucchini = about 2 cups which I 'grated' - no draining needed.  GREASED my pans - worked well - cool 20 minutes after removing from oven - they release easily !

This bread has a nice flavor and is very moist but I was hoping for a 'wetter' consistency.  I will make this again but next time I will add more pineapple and zucchini, perhaps doubled.  I increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon.

followed the recipe pretty much as written except instead of adding nuts and raisins, I added a cup or so of blueberries and made them into jumbo muffins.  I also reduced the oil to a 1/4 cup and subbed the rest with applesauce.  so good!  this is definitely a keeper :)

This zucchini bread is excellant. I don't taste the pineapple and believe the addition helps to make a nice moist bread. I did add 1 Tablespoon of vanilla and my preferance was to leave the raisins out. Best to cool completely, cover and have the next day. I used two 8x8 square pans and they baked in about 45 minutes.

I love this bread, but I did make some alterations.  The only things I changed were, I left out the oil and simply added a 15 1/2 oz can of pineapple in its own juice.  Added juice and all.  It was still very good and moist, and probably better for us.

I got this recipe from my late sister, Nancy, in the 1980's.  I have made this about 5 million times.  I even make and mail it to my son, Mark, in California.  Everyone that tries it, loves it.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

This zucchini pineapple bread is awesome!  
I reduced white sugar by half and it was still plenty sweet for our taste.  Will reduce to 2/3 cup sugar next time.  Used fresh pineapple but am sure canned is fine too.  I did not use extra juice from cutting the pineapple and it was still very moist! 
Big hit with my husband and friends!  Will definitely make again.  May try with fresh mango  instead of pineapple too.

I have used this recipe for several years now. Everyone looks forward to when I’m going to make it. I cut down on the sugar to 1/4 less than the recipe calls for.

We got two loaves and a dozen muffins from this recipe. My family loved it and it freezes well. Easily could become a favourite around here.

I was afraid the fruity qualities of pineapple and raisins wouldn't go well with zucchini, but I was wrong. The fruit is pleasant and not overpowering at all. Parchment paper definitely helps in getting this slightly crumbly (when it's still warm) loaf out of the pan in one piece. I flash froze some then stored it in freezer bags so we can take out a single slice, zap it in the microwave, spread on a little butter and yum!

My grandchildren loved this bread, however I called it "Pineapple Bread", leaving out the word zucchini.  Very moist and flavorful, freezes well.  I baked the recipe in three smaller pans, rather than the two larger ones.  This worked very well.

Good but kinda bland. The base muffin flavor was good but next time I would add more pineapple and maybe some more spice.

This bread was so moist and the best tasting I have ever had. I have made it twice and everyone  loves it. I will be making it again soon.
