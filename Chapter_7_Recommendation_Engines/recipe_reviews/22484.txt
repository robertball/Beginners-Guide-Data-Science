Just a suggestion I found helped keep the cheese in the pepper. When you cut off the stem end leave enough of the pepper so that you have a solid end. When you cut the pepper in half it looks like a little boat. This keeps the melted cheese from running out.I precook the bacon  slightly so that I don't have to turn them and bake them at 400 till the bacon is crisp instead of broiling them. I've been doing this for years and have always had good luck. Joan

The guys really digged these at our last football party.  My only suggestion is pre-cook the bacon to at least the soft stage to make sure it is crispy and line the baking sheet with foil for easy clean up.

These were pretty good.  I used pre-cooked bacon and only broiled 2-3 minutes.  I also have made them with cream cheese.  I mixed shredded sharp cheddar, 4 oz. cream cheese and a few seeds for some heat and broiled for 2-3 minutes.  My family liked this better.  By using the pre-cooked bacon and only broiling for 3 minutes, my cheese didn't melt all over the pan.

This recipe was fantastic and easy to make.

I cooked them as long as it said to, AND I never did turn them. Most of the cheese stayed in the poppers, and the bacon was cooked just fine!
I added a little water to the bottom of my broiler pan to cut down on any smoke that might occur.

We had these for Super Bowl Sunday, and my husband and I had fun making them  (AND eating them!)

I will never get store bought poppers again!  thank you!

Try pre-cooking the bacon and adding it chopped to the cheese filling.

This recipe is GREAT!!! I made these for a turkey fry party and they were a bigger hit than the turkey! I took the suggestion of adding some seeds to the cheese, and it worked great. Also, I shredded the cheese in my processor, mixed the seeds in and rolled it into balls...it fits in the pepper better. GREAT! Works really good with turkey bacon too.

This was a very good treat.  I cooked them in a cupcake pan (3-4 in each section.)  This way the cheese didn't melt out and eaveryone enjoyed them!!

Easy to make, since there are only 3 ingredients, but preparing the jalapenos can be time consuming.  An important precaution - protect your hands when seeding the peppers.  Jalapenos can cause some really severe skin irritation.

This recipe tasted OK, but was incredibly messy to make.  It is hard to wrap slimy bacon around a slippery pepper, and make sure it stays in place. When cooking them, the main problem was keeping them in the broiler long enough to get the bacon to crisp up, without all of the cheese melting and running out.  For the second batch, we precooked the bacon about halfway, but this only helped slightly.  Overall, I would not recommend this recipe.  It was just not worth the mess for the mediocre results.

I had to cook these a bit longer than I thought I would have to get the bacon done. I think next time we'll cook the bacon a bit before wrapping to cut down on the broiling time and keep some of the cheese in the peppers.

this is a great recipe!  a guy at work makes them all the time.  he stretches the thinly sliced bacon all the way around the pepper so that you can't see any of the pepper.  he cooks them on a broiling pan and places them in the slots so all the bacon drippings fall into the bottom pan...which makes the bacon crisp up.  he cooks them for a lot longer though...usually 45 minutes.  and to add an extra kick, he dust each popper with louisiana seasoning.  there is nothing better!  they are awesome warmed up later in the microwave!  another hint is to cut then freeze your cheese before wrapping.  that will help it stay inside also.  happy eating!

This tasty recipe is quick and easy.  I have made it a couple times and received many compliments.  I did run into the same problem getting the bacon to cook so I switched up the recipe a little bit by using proscuitto to wrap and provolone to stuff and that was really tasty as well.

This recipe tasted ok, but a little greasy.  I  tried an earlier suggestion of cooking the bacon a couple of minutes before and I still had to flip the peppers to try to get the bacon done and almost all the cheese ran out.

I made these and people at my oscar party LOVED them- I thought they were fine.  I did partially pre-cook the bacon and thought that perhaps I cooked it too long- in the end product the pepper was barely softened- I will do these again without pre-cooking the bacon or I'll try reducing the amount of pre-cook time on the bacon.

This is a really good recipe and went over well.  I made the filling ahead of time and added real crab meat to it, onion and some seasonings. 

I fried the bacon up a head of time too, just enough get some of the fat out of it.  I used thick sliced bacon.  I took some of the bacon juice and added it to some honey to paint on after I had the peppers stuffed and wrapped. 

I cut the jalapeno's in half (length ways) with the stems on, the stems added to the *look*. 

Everyone liked them.  The filling I had left over I used for cracker dip.  For extra heat I added some seeds to the filling. I'll definately make these again!

These were delicious. Four stars because of the mayo content. I only used about 3T. and will use less next time. Other subs were fresh basil, maybe 1T (because I had it in my herb garden)and a bit of garlic. I had small biscuits so did not feel that part was overpowering at all. Be sure to drain the tomatoes completely.

Made these for a large birthday party, but ran out of time.  Ended up halving the jalapenos, put in a 9x13 pan sides touching, thawed frozen meatballs - sliced them and layed inside the jalapenos, heavily sprinkled 4 Mexican grated cheese over all and then sprinkled real bacon chunks over all.  Baked until done and cheese well melted.  Excellent!  Used 30 extra large peppers, which made 60 halves and all were gone and they were the most commented on of the appetizers!  The flavor was the same, but much faster and easier and will make these many times again in the future!

I haven't tried this recipe, but I just tried something very similar.  Instead of bacon it called for thin sliced salami, and to solve everybody's melting cheese running out of the jalapeno popper  -  use the salami to cover the hole in the top of the jalapeno and secure it with a couple of toothpicks!  That would probably work with the bacon too if you didn't want to substitute salami.

I have now severed these a dozen times. Yesterday again at a football functions.  I have to tell you they are so good, they are off the tray in five minutes or less.  At this point I kinda wish I didn't bring them thats all they went me to do now.  Thank you Mayfranks, did not change a thing, they are great the way they are.

very good - made indoors on a grill pan / press (from Pampered Chef) to help use up the abundance of jalapenos from our garden. for three ingredients, it was super convenient!

I used this as a base recipe. I used 4 jalapeno peppers, 2 oz cream cheese, 1/3 cup sharp cheddar cheese and 8 slices turkey bacon. To cut down on time I pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave instead of broiling it. Turned out great! Will definitely make again.

ive done this recipe many times, its delicious if done right. instead of just using cheddar cheese i used cream cheese with italian seasoning, onion powder and garlic powder mixed in. then sprinkle shredded cheese on top of that. then i wrap the bacon around the pepper and secure it with a toothpick. its a little more work but it really made the difference. how much cream cheese you use per pepper depends on your preferences, i like the pepper filled with the cream cheese to lessen the heat of the pepper but my hubby likes less cream cheese cuz hes a heat lover. it really is worth a try!

Let's see... bacon and cheese... I think that combo would make anything 5 stars!  This was no exception, it was delicious!  I am overwhelmed with jalapenos in my garden right now, so it was a great way to use up my abundance.  Also, unless you want "soft" bacon, cook it a little bit before hand.  I like mine with a little crunch!

What a great recipe. I didnt read the other reviews before I made them, so I didnt know about the cheese melting out, but all I did was scoop it back up and poke it back into the pepper under the bacon. Made these for a "guys night", and they were a HUGE hit. I even ate a few and they were so yummy. They will be a part of every guys night here on out.

You can add diced tomato, red onion and cilantro with shredded cheese. It helps if you pre cook the bacon. This is great on the grill.

My best friend's son who's 14 and PICKY adores this recipe!!!! It's a huge hit, smells great, and is sinfully easy, not to mention frugal. My only suggestion is really LOOK at the bacon you're buying. Opt for meaty pieces, and if I have a very fatty area I'll usually cut it off and toss it.

Very quick and easy to put together.  (by the way I didn't use half as much cheese as the recipe calls for)  Next time I'll leave some seeds in the peppers for a bit of bite.

Simple, great recipe!  Definitely keep the tops on the peppers to hold the cheese in.  I precooked the bacon and only used 1/2 piece to wrap.  Very nice option for people who don't like cream cheese!  Definitely will be making these again, and again!

Hubby enjoyed these more than me.  It was tricky to keep the bacon wrapped.  If I make these again, I may chop the bacon and add it to the cheese.  Baked on a wire rack to keep peppers from tipping over.

My husband and I made these tonight and they are great.  After seeding and halving the peppers, we put them in the microwave for about 30 seconds.  We put the pre-cooked bacon in the bottom of the peppers, topped them with the cheese, then baked them in the oven at 400 degrees until the cheese was bubbly.   Yummy!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These are great, I mean how could you go wrong with bacon, cheddar and jalapenos! I love Mexican food and my mother always jokes that there must have been a mistake at the hospital because there is no way I am here child. She absolutely hates Mexican food. I work with Better Recipes and am always seeking out Mexican Recipes  because they are my favorite! I made these the other day for a dinner party and people could not get enough, they vanished within the first 10 minutes!

very tasty and not too spicy.  i added marbled cheese into my version and enjoyed the results.  Found that the cheese ran out of a few of them...but all in all a very good starter to a meal...or as a snack during parties and games.

I made these for a Christmas party and they were a hit! I cut the raw bacon in half down the middle lengthwise before wrapping, and it was plenty. I think using a whole piece would be too much.  They're greasy, but very yummy!

Loved 'em! I used super-thick cut bacon, and put them on the grill. It gave the jalepenos a nice char, and imparted a smoky flavor. I couldn't flip the peppers over to finish the bacon on the other side (or else the melted cheese would drip out), so I finished them under the broiler. 

I will be making these again later this summer when I become inundated with jalapenos from my garden!

I LOOOOOVE BACON AND CHEESE! I tried a similar recipe to this one, and  I can't pick a winner! I think it could've used a little less cheese though. It kind of overpowered the bacon....

I substituted shredded mexican cheese and grilled them instead of broiling. After all, it is grilling season. Husband LOVED them, had a little smokey taste from the grill. Fast, Easy, Very few ingredients, whats more to love.

I think these would be better with some type of cream cheese mixture in the middle as opposed to the cheddar. They were easy enough though, although I did kind of make a mess with all the bacon grease but hey, that's what happens when you cook with bacon. I did precook my bacon for a bit, although I'm not sure how necessary that was.

I did some research on this recipe for a few days before trying to make the jalapeno poppers for a Super Bowl party. There is no wrong or right way of making this recipe. Everyone at the party loved them. However, I expected them to taste better. The first time I used Cream Cheese, Shredded Cheddar Cheese, Bacon (fried before mixing it in), dip the peppers in egg after stuffing and then bread them with bread crums. I was determined to make a yummy popper so I decided to give it another go. The second time I cut them in half took out the seeds...you know the ususal. Then for the mix I used ranch dressing (regular or bacon flavored works fine), shredded cheddar cheese and a pinch of garlic salt. I was out of bacon. They turned out lovely the second time. Even better than the first time. Didnt even miss the bacon. My boyfriend LOVED them. I did use gloves as others suggested to do. And baking them was perfect.

These didn't last long at our Superbowl party! I filled them with cream cheese, and like others, I pre-cooked the bacon a little, then baked them at 400 for 20 min.  To prevent them from being too greasy and to help the bacon crisp up, I baked them on metal cooling racks set in foil-lined baking sheets. The racks also held the poppers in place while cooking, so there was no cheese leakage.

Great recipe and the reviews helped with the assembling/cooking. I cut the ends off, slit the pepper down one side, scooped out the seeds, inserted cut sticks of cheese. pre-cooked the bacon, wrapped the pepper and then broiled them in a cupcake tin, keeping the peppers upright. Family loved them - Thanks!

These are great! I have made them several times, and they're always a hit! I have found that it is better to partially cook the bacon first before wrapping it around the jalapeno. We like our bacon crispy.

We loved this recipe. I made a few changes to it. I used shredded cheddar, molded and packed it into thoroughly towel dried jalapenos after seeding and cleaning. The cheese stayed in  well. I also precooked the bacon half way and pressed the bacon till very little grease was left. My fiance and I loved 'em!

I made these BUT with a few changes based on the comments I read.  I used about 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 cheddar cheese.  I put this in the microwave for about 10 seconds to make it easier to mix.  I then put in some bacon bits and a few seeds to give it a little kick. After mixing, I filled the peppers with the mix. Next I put them in the oven at 400 for about 20 minutes and finished them off with a quick broil to make the tops brown.  I made these for the first time a few days ago and since them my husband has requested them twice.

I blanched peppers before baking....and I did as another reviewer suggested and cooked bacon then crumbled and added it to crm cheese mix. SO much easier and still just as good.....if not better because you got the bacon taste through the whole pepper and not just in one bite! I did add some garlic and cumin to mix (just because we love garlic and cumin)

Awesome!! Made these for the superbowl this evening & they were a hit! I also read reviews before I made these and followed the advice to cook the bacon to soft stage and glad I did cause watching them cook in the oven made me want to eat them before they cooked hehe...The only problem I had was the bacon shrunk & broke apart on some poppers but my own fault for wrapping the bacon to tight around the jalapenos. The bacon gives these a great smokey flavor which you dont even miss the breading or deep fat fried taste. I baked mine in the oven at 350 degrees for about 15-18 minutes. They came out great! Will be making these more often, recipes going in my recipe box thats for sure. Thanks a bunch for posting!!

What a hit!  I made these last weekend for a poker party and they were awesome.  Some thought they may be too hot but they weren't at all.  The only changes I made from reading other reviews was to mix cream cheese with shredded colby jack and I used pre-cooked bacon and broiled for 3 minutes.  These were excellent fresh out of the oven and still good an hour later.  Everyone enjoyed them and two people asked for the recipe.  Very easy to make and no clean up afterwards (use aluminum foil on baking sheet).  Next time I think I'll add some of the seeds to the cheese mixture to make a bit spicier.  Thanks so much, I'm making them again this weekend for Super Bowl party.

We have made these for years!!! They are so yummy. Make sure you wear gloves or wash your hands really well after you finish with the peppers. We mix the cheddar with cream cheese. It makes it smoother than just by it's self. We also make some with cream cheese and smoked salmon. Definately pre book the bacon a bit and we also add a pineapple or mandrin orange slice to the top just to calm the spice a bit.

Simple but yummy. I took previous reviewers advice and cooked the bacon a little before wrapping which seemed to work well. I used shredded cheese and didn't have any issue with the cheese running out. I left a few seeds in which added just a little heat. I think I'll try this with more kinds of cheese to spice up the flavor.

I stuffed the peppers with both Cheddar and garlic cream cheese, and they turned out great. I also put them in the freezer for 10 minutes before broiling to let the cheese harden so it didn't melt out. I served with ranch dressing, and my family and friends loved them. next time I will make more. Perfect for a football game.

i decided to try this bc im on the atkins diet and these turned out well..HOT.  My peppers were extremely hot.  i do suggest cooking the bacon some beforehand and also, try to get a thick sliced bacon...this helps when wrapping the pepper up, and also the bacon helps if your peppers are extremely hot.  i served with home made blue cheese dressing and celery.  i also stuffed some of the peppers with cream cheese...which my boyfriend preferred.  i will try these again but i am going to try to cook the peppers some first to soften them up and will scrape some of the flesh out to not make them so hot.  best advise...test the heat of the pepper first to avoid making the heat too much.  all in all, a great snack and meal

To ensure my bacon is done, I bake my bacon for a few minutes beforehand. That way as soon as my cheese starts to melt, they are ready. I leave a little of the veins in the jalapenos to keep a little heat and I like to try different cheeses inside.  I make these up for the grill often. Simple, tasty and easy!

Turned out great! Substituted shredded parmesan cheese for the cheddar.  Also baked them a little longer to get the bacon crispier.

Although i haven't tried this recipe,I have made Bacon wrapped poppers for years now, i have a couple of suggestions if you lower your oven rack and bake 3/4 of the time and then raise to broil 1/4 time this will help "crisp up"your bacon without having to turn your poppers,also if you boil your Jalapeno halves(BEFORE YOU STUFF & WRAP) for about 10 minutes then dump them in ice water to cool off this helps soften your peppers for those who like softer fully cooked peppers (like myself).Hope this helps....

These are great.  I always have a surplus of peppers from my garden so I freeze them.
These frozen peppers are perfect for poppers. Easy to cut and work with.
I have made these many ways, here are a few opinions I have. 
I just lay a piece of lean center-cut across the top. Too much bacon (in my opinion) and you will be limited to eating 3 or 4 at most. Even when I wrap bacon around, I have never seen any reason to tooth-pick anything. I bake them cup up at 450F til bacon is desired crispness. 
Honey and pineapple whipped cream cheese are my favorites.

great easy recipe!  I made these while cooking with friends, and a few of the girls who NEVER cook decided they want to try making these next time.  One note, even though they didn't come out overly spicy anyway, I tried soaking half of the jalepenos in water to dilute the heat even more... that didn't seem to work.  in fact, that half seemed spicier, although I question whether that was the water, or just a hotter batch of jalepenos.

Awesome!  My husband loved these!!  I left some of the seeds and ribs in so they would be a bit spicy.  We have a jalapeno plant so we will be making these all summer.  I do have some problems keeping the cheese in them, so I will be working on a technique to keep them together.  I did precook the bacon slightly as well, so any other tips would be greatly appreciated!

First, excellent recipe for those who love spice!  Yum!  I made about 40 of these little guys for a church picnic, and to take to the in-laws, for Memorial Day.  They were a hit, no leftovers.  Due to time constraints since I had to make other appetizers, I pre-cooked turkey bacon the night before, then chopped it and sprinkled it on the peppers.  The cheese and bacon melted together.  Delish!  I would experiment with other cheese and meat combos, too. Or maybe cheese, bacon, and tomato?  Thanks!

This were really good, but I made another recipe that was super simple. All it was was jalapenos, cream cheese, and bacon. I prefered that version. Although this one was still very good!

These were good, but the peppers weren't entirely cooked. And although we all like spicy food -- we were all running for the water (even though the seeds were removed).

These turned out quite lovely. I made them during a football game and added a little bit of cajun seasoning to just enough cream cheese to hold the cheddar together. They did need to be baked a lot longer than said to get the bacon crisp and the peppers were still a bit too crisp for me. With some tweaks next time they will be great.

These are the best! Use a 3 cheddar blend for full-bodied flavor.

This recipe is great. 

The only thing I do different is keep the jalapeno intact and just cut a slit to take out the seeds and add the chunk of cheese. Doing it this way prevents the spillover and gooey mess that's created after the cheese melts.

we make these all the time. but we cook them on the BBQ. i use block cheese cut up into little squares and stuff the pepper. we make these ahead of time and take them out to the lake or camping and its a quick "hot" snack. Also for those who cant handle the heat, try the yellow peppers stuffed with pepper jack cheese. they are great, a little heat with a little sweetness! another hint, instead of toothpicks try placing a few on metal scewers.

Very good, we prefer the cream cheese & garlic filling best but this is a nice change off pace.

These are such a hit whenever I make them!  We love them!  I put a grill insert into my baking pan and make them on there so that the excess can drip away.  I also prefer Monterey Jack cheese to the cheddar, and President's Choice bacon to any other (it rolls more easily).  As another reviewer suggested, be sure to keep the cheese face up - that way its sure to be there when your done! Enjoy!!!!

I prefer to stuff the halved chiles with shredded cheddar mixed with cream cheese, as the cream cheese counteracts the heat. I also find that cheap, thin bacon works best; thickly sliced bacon was too hard to wrap around the pepper, and took much too long to crisp. I've also just laid a slice of bacon across the top of the pepper, but wrapping it gives you more flavor & crunchy texture.

I made these and was really excited because I love spicy food.  I took extra care in preparing them so that the cheese did not come out, but very disappointed!  Lacked flavor.  Very boring!  No one ate them at my football party!

I have used this recipe many times. I mix cheddar and cream cheese for stuffing and add 2 or 3 salad shrimp to each one before wrapping, never have any left over. I sometimes crumble and brown some breakfast sausage and use it in place of the shrimp. Still no leftovers.

I've made this a couple times now, and I felt after signing up you needed some kudos! Basic dish with simple ingredients. This recipe was a great starting base to get creative, switching up cheeses or adding some extras to make the poppers really stand out. Thanks for posting, it is delicious!

Solid. Add Cajun spice before adding bacon to spice it up even more.

This was very easy and very good. Everyone loved them. They weren't as spicy as I thought they would be which was a good thing. I did throw the peppers into boiling water for about 4 minutes to soften them after slicing them. Also learned after the first couple...do not slice the stem side off....those did ooze out. Just pull the stem off and slice down the middle. Will definitely be making again!

Good recipe. I added cream cheese to the cheddar. This was super easy.  I think half a piece of bacon would work great and then you will get more of the heat from the pepper.  We found that the jalapeno lost its spice because of the cheese and bacon.

The tips from "PARVEU" worked awesome!!!!  Thanks!

This recipe is "Rediculous Good"! My husband loves these so much, that my "honey do" list can be cut in half with the threat of these! He actually gets upset if I make them for dinner partys, because he doesn't like to "SHARE" them.  

Suggestion: It is much easier to wrap the bacon with 1-2 toothpicks per pepper.

I precooked the bacon until halfway done. I wish I had baked/broiled the jalapenos halves before stuffing and wrapping them to soften them up a bit. Left a couple of seeds inside before putting the cheese in. Still, the guys we had over for the NFL draft downed them like there was no tomorrow!

This was just ok for us. A little too spicy even with the seeds and membrane taken out of the peppers. Be sure to wear rubber gloves when working with jalapenos. I didn't and my hands stung for a couple of days.

Tastes pretty good, but it's really hard to get the cheese to stay in the jalapeno. I've tried this recipe multiple times, but always find the cheddar leaking into the pan and becoming mostly unsalvageable.

These were good, I like my bacon really cooked to where its not fatty feeling so next time I think ill cook the bacon a little before wrapping it around the pepper. Most people enjoy bacon still a little soft but I cant. But this recipe is easy and good. I still gave it 5 stars even though my tastes are different w/ bacon.

Love it! A bit tedious for seeding the jalapenos, but use gloves!
It is important to quarter the bacon.  I found the longer, skinnier pieces worked much better.  Use cream cheese for a variation.

EXCELLENT! These are easy to make and taste super. I prefer using cream cheese instead of cheddar...I also microwave the bacon for a few minutes just to cook it a bit. 5 STARS!
