It's very good with V 8 instead of the Tomato juice, and an added onion instead of the onion powder.

I have been making this soup for years. It is one of my favorites. You can add or omit any vegetable you want. I usually use onion, celery, green pepper, can mushrooms, frozen corn, carrots & potatoes. I have also added broccoli and cauliflower.

I used frozen corn, carrots and Grean Beans, omitted the peas, and fresh potatoes cut small enough to cook quicker.  It does make a lot but it freezes well.  I will be trying stew meat next time.

My son made this tonight and will make this for his scout troop on their next Campout. So easy and all my kids liked it! We left out the asparagus and peas, but followed the recipe otherwise.  The only thing he wants to change is add a little more beef and add some water to make it more soupy, and less cabbage (it was hard to judge the size of head to use). We browned the meat right in the soup pot and just put everything on top. Was fully cooked in about 30-40 minutes on the stove.
