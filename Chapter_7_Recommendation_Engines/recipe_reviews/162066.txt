This recipe is similar to my mother's except for the cornmeal. She used grits instead. I always enjoyed her crispy fried Scrapple with eggs and bacon in the morning and I was a picky kid. Thanks for posting this!

Terrible. Terrible. As a native Maryland/Pennsylvanian, I hoped this scrapple recipe would break the Rappa Scrapple Co. Stranglehold on our family. Alas, no spicing can disguise the solid gelled cornmeal flavour of this. Ham based scrapple can be good; this is not. A sad waste of expensive ingredients.

I made it with leftover cornbeef & ham.   One ham hock seams to small (  I used  2  hocks for peas soup, it was 1/4 cup of meat)  I will try with 1# of sausage or ham and no cheese.
