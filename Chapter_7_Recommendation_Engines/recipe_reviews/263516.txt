I don't like the original recipe because it has too much sugar and oil. 2 cups of white sugar is too much. Remember that the carrot and pineapple are already sweet so I reduced the white sugar from 2 cups to 1 cup (so much better). The oil I used was 1/2 cup of coconut oil (melted). I didn't use butter only coconut oil and it's perfect. This would be a healthier version if you need to watch your sugar intake.

I made this for Easter. It. Was. Delicious. I followed exactly as written. But did use vegetable oil in place of the coconut oil.  Thanks for sharing!

Easter bunny approved! I made some substitutions though... I didn't have enough coconut oil (or any veg oil) so I used 1c melted vegetable shortening with a 1/4c coconut oil. Instead of pineapple I used 8oz of chopped fresh strawberries. And toasted almonds instead of pecans. No butter in the icing either. And decorated with sliced strawberries. DELICIOUS!

I made this and used vegetable oil instead of coconut oil, and walnuts instead of pecans. It came out deliciously! It was easy, straight forward, with amazing results!

I made this recipe as a birthday cake and it was delicious!  I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg to the cake batter because I enjoy those flavors and only used 1/2 cup of walnuts because I'm not a huge nut fan, but the crunch and nuttiness lent to a great taste profile.   I also cut the sugar from 2 cups to 1 and 3/4 in the batter and for the frosting went from 3 cups confectionary sugar to 2 cups.  Chef Jon you did it again!  My fiance loves your easy, but tasty recipes.  If you ever do a live demo, let us know! ;D

Great flavors in a moist and hearty cake!  I cut the sugar in half and used 1/2 cup coconut sugar and 1/2 cup date sugar.  Also substituted a cup of applesauce in place of the pineapple since that's what I had on hand.  Added raisins and dates, about 3/4 cup. Used fresh ginger in place of dry, 1/2 tsp nutmeg in place of cinnamon (upsets hubby's stomach) and wow, the flavors were sublime!  Will make again and again.

I made no changes. If I were a child I would love it but I am old and the overly sweet overly oily cake was just 
Not to my taste anymore.  I have nothing against sugar or fat they both are great in cake, thats why I made the cake in the first place.   The cake has eye appeal and if you like real sweet you will like this.

Good but Too sweet. Second time I made it I used only 2/3 of the sugar in the cake recipe and only 1/2 of the sugar in the frosting.  Much better.

We loved the taste of this cake!  I didn't make any revisions but since I have different size cake pans I made a medium and small cake.  We won't use any other carrot cake recipe than this one.

This is the BEST recipe for carrot cake I have EVER had!
My entire family LOVED this recipe. I accidentally used a 20 ounce can of pineapple (drained) instead of 8 oz. I also placed the final batter in a sheet pan so they would bake faster and would feed more guest. Lastly, my icing only required 2 cups of powdered sugar (by my taste). 
All in all, it's a crowd pleaser!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!

Really good cake, I doubled the frosting with a little less cream cheese. And I ran out of coconut oil so I used all butter but a little bit  less around 1 cup and 2 tablespoons I also used extra walnuts instead of  the pecans.

Not bad.  I used the cream cheese icing recipe Chef John had posted somewhere else though.  I also left out the pecans.  I served the cake at a gathering and received a lot of positive feedback.  Sadly, I didn't get to have any myself.

This cake is excellent! I made it almost exactly as directed, with these differences because of availability and allergies:
-Substituted canola oil for coconut oil
-Omitted pecans and walnuts 
This was moist, very tasty, and was a smash hit. Actually our group of 9 finished it off in one evening; people just couldn't stop picking away at it even after dessert dishes were cleared.

I have a new favorite carrot cake recipe! I make carrot cake for my husband's birthday every year, but I decided to try a new recipe. I've made a few of Chef John's recipes and they've all turned out great, so I trust his judgement that this is a good one too. I didn't really alter much, just used pecans instead of walnuts and 3/4 coconut oil and 1/4 vegetable. Oh, and I added a sprinkle of nutmeg too. Made in two 8in cake pans for a double-layer cake and cooked it for 45 mins. Great texture and flavor, love the addition of the crushed pineapple. Nicely done, Chef John.

I made this recipe as written, only added 3 cups carrot, 1/4c chopped dates, 1/8c finely chopped candied ginger, and just over 1/3c raisins to the batter, and the zest and 1/8 c juice of one orange to the frosting. did find that this recipe with  the mods made 3  med sized rounds, which i had really hoped to be able to do by making 2 batches of this recipe and hopefully a little batch of muffins- but I didn't have any more oil for it- so was very pleased with that.  2 rounds would've overflowed and made a big messy in my oven. I was surprised how wonderfully this turned out. truly award winning. It did require that I double the frosting recipe, but then again I did get a whole extra cake round that was not accounted for in the original recipe. My cake turned out SO beautifully, and disappeared way too fast to even get a proper photo of ONE slice.

I prepared this cake as Chef John instructed. I thought it was very good and everyone else (3 people) at the picnic where very complimentary...

I didn't give it five stars because it was the first carrot cake I have had in ten years and I felt unqualified to rate it :( .
