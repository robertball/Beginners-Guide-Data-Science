This was pretty good but not as good as I was expecting. It was a little bland. I ended up sprinkling more brown sugar over the top to add more flavor. Next time I might even use cinnamon butter just to add some "zing".

This was a very good recipe. The only thing I did differently was I did not use instant rice. The picky eater in my family actually came back for seconds. Thanks Linda

This tastes a lot better than you'd expect it to taste.  I mixed the cheese in with the rice and then sprinkled a little on top during the last few minutes of cooking.  The next day, I mixed in some leftover roast chicken into the leftover rice, microwaved it - and that was REALLY good.

This was really easy to make and very flavorful. We barbecued ham steaks and were looking for something to go with that. This was a great side dish as the pineapple flavor worked well with the ham. Will definately make it again.

Yum! This was awesome. My fiance love this dish. I mixed in some cheese with the rice and pineapple and sprinkled some on top. It was a nice change. We made this with baked chicken.

I loved this recipe! Being a big fan of cheese, I added a lot more cheese than it called for. I also added a spoonful of sour cream and a dash of cinnamon. I was really sad that we didn't have any left overs. I'm definitely making this again!

We enjoyed this as a side to Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs this evening. I used regular rice rather than instant; cooked it up in an electric rice cooker, and followed the recipe from there.  Thank you, Linda!

I haven't made this recipe yet but I have made pinneapple rice before and I suggest using jasmine rice for this.  The Pinneapple and Jasmine Rice tastes really good together.

This was delicious!  I used Jasmine rice instead of instant or regular as some have suggested.  The "nutty" taste was the perfect compliment to the other flavors.  I used 12 oz of pineapple and used more cheese than called for.  I mixed the cheese in with the other ingredients and sprinkled some on top to bake.  The next time I make this I will not bake it.  The rice is hot enough to melt the cheese and I won't have to heat up the entire kitchen.  It could really pass for a dessert too...YUM!

Pretty good, but not as flavorful as expected. If I make this again I will definitely cook it with pineapple juice and add a lot of cheddar cheese stirred in.

Definitely add more cheese, brown sugar & cinnamon to rice mixture. Also, save drained pineapple juice & add enough water to prepare rice. Adds nice flavor & it keeps it from being too soupy. I would give this 3.5 stars..a little different, but not stellar

I wasn't that impressed. If I ever try to make this again, I would probably drain the pineapple and mix cheese in with the main part of it. It was just a little too watery and.... different, for me. I agree with others that chicken would go well with this.

I wasn't expecting this to be all that great but it was. It would be nice as a side with ham.  It was very simple to make and had a very light sweet taste.

A bit bland.  This recipe needs something to give it a heartier flavor, but I'm not sure what ingredient to add.

YUMMY!  Based on other suggestions, we used Jasmine rice.  Cooked it in a rice cooker along with the pineapple, butter and chicken broth instead of water.  When the rice cooker switched to "warm" mode, I stirred in the sugar and a dash of cinnamon then topped with cheese.  Replaced the lid long enough to melt the cheese, and it was ready to eat.

I was really excited to try this dish, but I can't say it was exactly what I was looking for. My husband really likes rice, but I don't.. and I was hoping this dish would bridge that gap.  It was alright.  Nothing stellar, but not horrible either. I didn't find that the flavors were blended together much, maybe will try again and mix cheese in, instead of on top.

I found this recipe and it's DELICIOUS. I modified it, using long-grain brown rice (1 part rice to 2 parts water) - bringing to boil, cover and reduce to medium heat cooking until water is nearly gone. I didn't add the salt or brown sugar but stirred in a couple Tablespoons of butter. This is a good tummy filler and nutritious. With the sweet pineapple combined with the cheese - it curbs MY cravings. Refrigerate leftovers - it keeps several days reheats without loss of texture or flavor. Great for dieters - I've lost couple pounds adding rice to my diet over past couple weeks. Enjoy.

This was SO good! I served it along with grilled ham steaks and we ate the whole pan.  My husband has been making comments about it all evening since dinner, so it was a winner!  And really quick and easy to throw together too!  YUM!

I have to admit, I had my doubts when I first read this recipe, but I was making pork chops and wanted something different as a side dish.  I did not use quick rice, but just cooked rice the long way like I usually do.  I also used Colby cheese instead of cheddar.  This was Fabulous!  Both my foodie boyfriend and my picky 12 year old son LOVED it.  The pineapple adds a nicely sweet flavor to the rice that meshes nicely with pork.  I will absolutely make this again and may put it into steady rotation when I make pork.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Not bad needs some tweaking to make it not so sweet but it was tasty and went well with the orange chicken we had for dinner. We did not do the cheese but I can see how it would be a nice addition to the dish.

We all really enjoyed this, and that doesn't happen often.  Usually someone doesn't like something.  I wasn't sure about the cheese, so I only put it on half.  Both sides were finished.  Thank you for a quick recipe at the last moment.  Ally

Made with beer lime grilled chicken and it was great all blended together on  your plate.  Good meal for hot summer nite - light and not too filling.  Easy to make.  I struggled to find a "1 quart cooking dish" and didn't have enough pineapple to double the recipee and use my 2 quart - ended up having to use more of a baking pan.  It came out fine.  Guess I need to add that to my shopping list.
