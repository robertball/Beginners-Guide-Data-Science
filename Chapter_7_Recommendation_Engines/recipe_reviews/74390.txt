REFRESHING! A nice little cookie that really bursts with lemon flavor! If you are looking for a more subtle lemon taste, omit the rinds. I rolled in confect. sugar, placed on platter then for extra presentation, sifted more sugar on top. Very pretty cookies! Reminds me of the Lemon Coolers cookies that Nabisco used to make! Only better! Thanks!

A pretty good cookie.  The first batch, I didn't cook quite as long as the second batch.  I thought the second batch was better.  Make sure they have browned nicely on the bottoms before taking them out, they'll be a bit crisper that way.

Having just moved into a house with a Meyers lemon tree in the yard with a full load of lovely lemons, i have been trying out lots of lemon recipes.  This one is just amazing and the cookies are perfection.  Light, rich, lemony.  Wonderful texture.  i followed the recipe exactly and it turned out just right.  I highly recommend - and use fresh lemons:)

These cookies are very easy to make, and very tasty. I made my first batch as the recipe states. The only thing I might change is leaving out the almonds as I don't care too much for any type of nut. I do love the citrus taste, it is very light and refreshing. I will be making these for my Christmas cookie/candy platters.

Made these with no cream of tartar, pecans and a little extra zest. Otherwise followed the recipe. Chilled for an hour. They are so much tastier than I expected! Like lemon bars in cakey shortbread form. So tasty!!

Pretty good.  Mind were a bit softer than I would have liked but others really liked them.  I double dipped mine in powdered sugar to get the look I was wanting.  I would probably make this again, especially in summer as it is a "refreshing" type cookie.

Followed recipe exactly and they turned out perfect!  Could be one of my new favorite holiday cookies!  I may even add more lemon next time; however, they are great as written.  Make sure you wait the 5 minutes to roll in the powdered sugar.

Very easy to make.  They took a few minutes longer to cook in my oven, maybe 15 or 16.  They didn't come out crispy like others have reported.  They were delicate and somewhat soft even after the extended booking time.  The friends and family loved them and they disappeared quickly.  My new favourite cookie to have with tea!  My only issue was how fragile they appeared after transporting them to a friends house.

Pretty good.  I'm not a huge fan of crispy cookies, and mine turned out a bit soft so I was fine.  I'm not a fan of rolling in the sugar after baking, though.  Maybe I should've waited longer, but the sugar kept melting so I just gave up and my snowballs are more like melting snowballs.  They still taste pretty good, though.  thanks for the recipe!

Nice lemon flavor. The sweetness of the powdered sugar balances the tartness of the lemon really well.

I was a little disappointed in these.  Not sure what I expected but felt like they were nothing special.  Probably won't make again.
