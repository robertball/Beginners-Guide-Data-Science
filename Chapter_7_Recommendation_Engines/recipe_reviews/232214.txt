Thanks lovestohost for the review! I really only put the recipe for myself. GREAT idea about cutting the sugar in half -- I'm definitely going to try that! I like the toasted almond flavor more than the carmelized sugar flavor. I can't keep out of them as they cool either! They are DELICIOUS on salads - especially paired with my sweet sour salad dressing. I'm in the midwest and we have a restaurant called Max & Erma's that has an AMAZING house salad. It's served with bacon red onion sweet sour dressing and toasted almonds. I posted the almond and sweet sour salad dressing recipes so I could easily find them!

Delicious! I can't stop eating them as they cool so I'll happily eat any leftovers from tonight's dinner salads as a snack. Super simple preparation that really elevates your salad in both flavor and texture. I chose to cut the sugar in 1/2 and found that perfect for our tastes. I can't wait to toss some leftovers in some warm buttery salty popcorn! THANKS for the recipe!

Seriously elevates any salad you make. My boyfriend (a carnivore) even ate some with a bite of lettuce. Super good and quick. Just keep in mind they keep cooking a shortwhile after you have taken them away from anything hot.

I used this recipe to guide me.... I added 2-3 drops of orange oil (Young Living brand), 1-2 Tbs bacon grease, 1tps of black pepper and a sprinkle of Cayenne pepper. Amazing!

This recipe was surprisingly delicious and easy! While at the beautiful “Historical” Davenport Hotel in Spokane, Washington, we had a delicious spring salad topped off with toasted almonds! This recipe created the perfect toasted almonds as we recreated the salads for 15 back in Seattle for a Father’s Day celebration. Thank you!

Very easy. Here are my thoughts. I found another recipe that used 2 Tbsp of sugar per 1/2 cup of almonds. I thought that was a good ratio. I started the sugar first and when it started getting some color added the almonds. Right after I dumped them on a sheet pan I threw a little turbinado sugar on them. Made them all fancy looking. I bet fancy salt would be fun too. I will try spices next. I think cayenne would be interestng or good chili powder.

Very easy to make and adds a real nice touch to salads. Only using half the suggested sugar the almonds were more than sweet enough.
