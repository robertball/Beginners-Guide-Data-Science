My niece just loved this and it was perfect for her "snack time" at school.  She's too little to assemble the pita herself or at least that's my thought so I assembled it for her and added some cheddar cheese. I kept the ranch dressing in a container for her to dip the sandwich into. I added a little bag of red grapes and off she went!

Great for a quick lunch. Also spread on tortillas and rolled up. At this point you could slice it into generous slices for a pinwheel effect.

And, as the cook notes, there are numerous combinations for this sammy.

great idea!  Sure beats the standard sandwich lunch I pack for my teen. My son is in Junior High and he says the other 4 boys at his table all eat something from the lunch line, like chips or cookies and they all ask for something from his lunch because his is a fresh lunch made with real food.  I always pack an extra piece of fruit for a friend that has no lunch.  This will be a great addition to our sandwiches and easy to pack another pita for a friend.  Its not true what they say about kids and food,  they really do want to eat well but either parents cant afford it or parents just don't take the time.

I loved this, so easy. I did cheat a little, added shredded cheddar cheese because I am a cheese nut. Thanks for sharing.
