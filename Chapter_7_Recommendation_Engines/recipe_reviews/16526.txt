I've been making this salad for years.  However, us Sicilians make it a little different.  Also, another trick is to use fresh bocconcini (the smaller fresh moz. balls) and to use very fresh Roma (chopped) tomatoes or cherry/plum tomatoes.  I add a lot of balsamic dressing with only a splash of olive oil (plus at least 3-4 cloves of fresh chopped garlic).  Mix together and let the flavors marinate together (it tastes delicious when the balsamic vinegar and garlic flavors soak into the cheese).  Just a little Sicilian twist to the caprese salad.

My fiance and I ate this nearly every day when we were in Italy.  The submitter isn't lying - top-quality ingredients are essential.  Use tomatoes on the vine, not beefsteaks.  If at all possible, use Buffalo mozzerrella, it is absolutely, UNBELIEVABLY moist and delicious and tastes nothing like the over-processed variety (if you live in the mid-Atlantic, Wegman's has it).  I personally like to drizzle a little good Balsamic on at the end and sometimes sprinkle some kosher salt on top.  Mmmmmmmm......

This is a traditional Italian favorite in our family which is at its best in summer, with juicy, flavorful, red-ripe Roma tomatoes and bright, crisp fresh basil. Simple and just plain delicious, even with nothing more than a good, crusty bread!

It doesn't get much better or much simpler that this - it's absolutely delicious! It's so fresh and so good I could have eaten just this for dinner with a side a crusty Italian bread. It make a beautiful presentation on a platter. A definite crowd pleaser!

I love this salad.  I use only the freshest mozzerella and drizzle 2/1 ratio of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

Caprese is also great on lightly toasted italian hard rolls.

Simply drizzle your roll with EVOO and toast lightly.  Then layer with cheese, tomatoe, fresh basil, salt, and pepper.  You can also drizzle more EVOO and balsamic vinegar for a stronger taste.

Try it with a twist and add a layer of sun-dried tomotoes.

Very good! I added sliced black olives to mine. I also added balsamic vinegar (same amount as oil). The only thing I would change is to maybe let the cheese sit in the oil, vinegar, basil mixture a little bit to soak up some of the flavor.

I used a mozzarella cheese that was rolled in red pepper and sundried tomatoes currently sold at Wegman's grocery stores.  It was much more flavorful than using plain mozzarella.  I also used fresh basil rolled and chopped and then sprinkled a dash or so of balsamic vineger along with the olive oil.  After salt and peppering the alternatly sliced tomatoes and cheese I would let it marinate and soak up the flavors for full effect.  My husband loves this recipe and its so easy.

I don't make this any longer because you can't find fresh mozzarella where we currently live, but it is the best.  Other reviewers are right, you have to use fresh ingredients to get good taste.  I also recommend letting the cheese marinate in the oil for better taste.

I've been making this for years and love it!  Red, ripe, JUICY tomatoes are a must.  I also like a recipe where all the ingredients are combined in a bowl and can be carted to potlucks without much fuss... juicy cherry tomatoes cut in half (sweet 100's if you grow your own...or ripe large juicy tomatoes cut into 1/2 cherry tomato sized pieces), little mozzarella balls halved (or larger pieces cut into cubes), chopped basil, sea salt, freshly ground pepper and olive oil.  Mix all together in a bowl and chill.  When it is about time to serve, let rest at room temperature for a bit... the salt draws the juice out from the tomatoes and mixes with the olive oil...makes the most sweet & succulent dressing!

Good basic caprese.  Be sure to use fresh mozzarella (packed in water) & large basil leaves.  A big hit at our house before a lasagne dinner.

This is a classic salad if made with the very best ingredients you can find.  When purchasing my fresh mozzarella for this I saw that the brand I usually buy now sells fresh mozzarella in a roll.  The package shows you how to unroll it, then fill it with your tomato slices and basil leaves and then roll it back up.  Then slice the roll crosswise into little colorful pinwheels.  I made this recipe using that product and drizzled my caprese pinwheels with EVOO and a balsamic glaze.  Then sprinkled with salt and pepper.  Makes for a very pretty presentation of this classic salad.

I had been making this recipe for years before I found out it was Caprese Salad. I find it important to salt the sliced tomatoes on each plate first and let stand for awhile to drain much of the excess water out. Then layer with the freshest mozzarella I can find. Not the rubbery stuff. Basil, like tomatoes fresh from my garden. For olive oil (sorry Italians) I use a good Greek oil as I like the flavor better and the best Balsamic vinegar I can find. 40 or at least 20 year old. It makes a huge difference. Any good Italian bread with hard crust but soft insides for dipping up the residues and a nice red or white Italian wine with a fresh taste. I live for the summer and this salad and it is ALWAYS a surefire hit. Some good prosciutto on the side maybe.

To get a real Italian likeness, its important to use high quality olive oil.  Let it sit at least 15 minutes for the flavors to absorb before serving.

With a recipe this simple, the ingredients become of absolute importance. Do not even attempt to use dried basil or cheap olive oil. Get the best fresh Buffalo Mozz and the juiciest vine ripened tomatoes. Serve this with some crusty bread and a crisp wine for an elegant and impressive light dinner.

the photo looks wonderful. If I may suggest first , using only Buffala mozzarella. It's more expensive but a higher and finer quality. Also cut slices equal to that of the tomatoes and layer them in a circle, tomatoe, cheese, large basil leaf. Then drizzle vergine oil, and a sprinkling of balsamico.

This was a snap to make - it tasted simple and fresh and was a perfect pairing with grilled 'Basil Shrimp' recipe.  Some of the basil leaves I had were very large so I took scissors and cut them into a leaf shape for a nice presentation with the tomatoes and cheese.  I also let the plate of Caprese sit at room temperature for about an hour to allow the flavors to meld together - great recipe!

So simple, and so good! A nice change from the usual lettuce salad.  I served this as the first course, followed by Chicken Fettucine Alfredo (another great allrecipes.com recipe).  It was the great beginning of a wonderful Italian meal!

WOW!!  Made this as the app but deserves leading role, middle of the table treatment!  My only tip is extremely obvious: this will be as good as the ingredients you use, so go for the freshest tomatoes, mozzarella and basil you can get! Thanks :)

This is a great recipe.  I have also used it as an appetizer by wrapping the basil leaf around a smaller & thicker mozzarella slice and using cherry tomatoes.  Skewer the whole thing with a party pick and drizzle with a balsamic vinegar or a balsamic reduction along with the olive oil!  They make a beautiful presentation on a platter for a party.

I took this to work for lunch & forgot the salt & pepper, but it was still very good.  Beautiful presentation, too, and super easy. It was a lot of salad for my 2 person family, though.

Really simple recipe - when put together with good quality, fresh ingredients it tastes just like the way you find it in restaurants.

Love this summer salad!  I agree that freshest mozzarella balls & basil chiffonade is the finest way to serve this Italian beauty.  2 parts balsamic & 1 part EVOO...perfect!  Thanks for sharing!

I make this as Hors d'oeuvre.  I use the small balls (1/2" dia. purchased in a tub with the liquid, very fresh sold at our grocery store) of mozzarella, grape tomatoes, basil, put on toothpick...salt, balsamic vinegar and EVOO sprinkled on top.  Place on a large platter and they will disappear before your eyes.

I would have given this a 5, but it really needs some fresh garlic (which I did add to mine). Otherwise, can't go wrong with tomatoes, mozzarella and fresh basil!

I make this a lot.  If you can buy balsamic glaze it is in the vinegar section of the grocery store.  It is like a balsamic reduction.  Amazing on this salad and tomatoes in general.

Wonderful change of pace from normal lettuce salads.  I shredded the cheese (used Queso Fresco Mexican white cheese instead of moz) and used 2 TBS. of red wine vinegar and 2 TBS. virgin olive oil for a little more tang. It's nice and quick, too.

Buy fresh! Fresh mozzarella, fresh tomatoes, and fresh basil! Go to the farmer's market for the tomatoes- it will be worth it. An average tomato will make an average dish. The freshness of the ingredients is really what makes this so delicious.

Some people may be purists and disagree with me, but Balsamic Vinegar is also a must for this recipe. Just a splash will do it. I love Caprese!

It is also wonderful with some slices of avocado tucked in!  A local restaurant slices a whole large tomato horizontally, layers with fresh mozzarella slices and avocado slices, then skewers with a sprig of rosemary.  Serve on a bed of 4 basil leaves, drizzle balsamic around the base...very showy!

I love this & we eat it all summer, especially for cook outs. Difference: I use balsamic vinegar, olive oil, ground garlic(not garlic salt) and some sea salt. I grow my own basil and only have to buy the fresh mozarella (cheaper at Sams Club or Costgo). It's a favorite!

YUM--Being italian we make this ALL the time. I never get sick of it. The only thing I do different is add dried oregano. When making for large crowd I cut fresh mozzerella into cubes (you can buy the round bochonchini but way more expensive this waY). Buy cherry tomatoes and place them both on a toothpick with fresh basil leaf. They present beautifully and are much easier to eat. Also taste better after theyve been saoked in...I usually place the ingredients in a ziploc bag with everything and then shake rattle and roll.

I used fresh roma tomatoes and sliced up the basil instead of using a whole leaf. I also used fresh mozzerella which is a MUST for something like this! I bought the high-end stuff from whole foods to make veal parmigiana, and used the remainder for this salad. In addition to oil, I drizzled balsamic vinegar on top and let sit for about 30 min before serving. Really easy, fresh, and delicious! enjoy

As other reviewers have stated, make sure you have the very freshest ingredients!  I love, love, love good caprese and chianti!  I also drizzle balsamic vinegar with the olive oil.  

I made this with little balls of mozarella, halved grape tomatoes, snipped basil, sea salt, fresh pepper, olive oil and balsamic vinegar for an office luncheon.  It was a huge hit!  Everyone wanted my "secret recipe"!!!

I've tried this with ricotta salata or feta instead of the mozzarella with wonderful results.  Also, Fleur de Sel makes a wonderful flavor on the tomatoes.  Salt with care if using a saltier cheese such as feta.  Also dot the finished plate with capers.

This is a great summer bbq salad. I used Kraft Balsamic Vinegar dressing instead of the olive oil and lots and lots of garlic.  To spice it up, you can also use pre-shredded "Tex-Mex" cheese.  If you use some yellow tomatoes you can make it even more colourful. This salad gets rave reviews from family and friends and its soo easy!

The flavors in this salad are spectacular and it is also very colorful.  I loved it and served it with veal piccata.  I did however use spicy Italian dressing rather than just olive oil.

use only buffalo mozzarella and fresh basil - add some aged balsamic to the dressing - and kick it up a notch by adding thin slices of sweet onion - build as follows: tomatoe slice - onion slice - cheese - repeat again - and end with third tomatoe slice - the onion really adds a depth of flavor - try it!

A frequent and easy salad prepared in our home.  Only addition is to add balsamic vinegar in an amount equal to the olive oil.  We generally use smaller rather than large tomatoes and cut the fresh mozzarella and tomatoes a bit thinner.  Easy to serve with a small flat spatula.  Fresh basil is a key!

I made this for a family reunion that I had my home. One tip I would give, is with the mozzarella. Put it in the freezer, before you slice it and you will get much thinner slices.  I had many people that put it on a bun and ate it as a veggie sandwich.

I cut these in half and wrapped them in a lettuce cup which was easy to eat and totally delicious.  Whenever guests have these, the conversation turns to the delicious food in Italy!  Be sure you use fresh tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, garden basil, sea salt and freshly ground pepper. Let it marinate in the fridge for at least an hour.  Mmmmmm!

I make this tomato ensemble every year when tomatoes are fresh and in season!  You will want to use the "fresh" mozzarella balls - that's important.  Also, a drizzle of good balsamic vinegar will top these off nicely!

My mother has been doing this for years.  The only difference is she adds a slice of prosciutto.  It's a staple at every gathering.

This is a great combination that is both tasty and colorful.  Personally, I found the basil a bit overpowering and in the future I will sprinkle with chopped basil instead of using an entire leaf for each tomato.

This is pretty tasty as written, but instantly goes into 5-star deliciousness category with a swift drizzle of balsamic glaze or a homemade balsamic dressing. Quick, fresh, satisfying, and gorgeous. Get the best fresh mozzarella you can afford for this beautiful salad. It's worth it! :)

Fabulous salad.  Be warned, however, Caprese is only as good as your ingredients.  If your tomatoes have no flavor, neither will this salad.  Ripe, homegrown tomatoes, fresh mozzarella packed in water, and fresh basil leaves make this outstanding.

Very simple and good! I used a mixture of 1/3 balsamic vinegar to about 2/3 olive oil and poured quite a bit over it, since I didn't have long to let it marinate.  Would be even better with really fresh garden tomatoes and a high quality balsamic.

This is my all time favorite dish during the summer - I can't get enough of fresh plum tomatoes straight from the vine and fresh snipped basil. We always have fresh mozzarella cheese in the house.

This is a great simple recipe my mother and I always make together.  We also add balsamic vinegar- which she now found in a spray bottle...I thought it was silly at first, but it's fun because she likes to douse hers and I like just a little bit.

A very nice basic recipe. Unfortunately a great vs a so-so Insalata Caprese is so dependant on the quality of your ingredients...I wasn't able to find buffalo mozzarella locally which I think would have made a huge difference to the flavour of this dish. The only fresh mozzarella I could find at short notice wasn't that great and I also would have loved to have had some fresh tomatoes from dad's garden. Will definitely be making this again though.

This is probably my favorite salad in the world.  


Caprese salad, with the ingredients listed, has such a pure, fresh taste...  Try it as-is before you alter it!

For those who want to put balsamic vinegar/garlic on top, it's all a matter of personal preferece, I suppose, but it takes away from the authenticity of the dish.  

Give this one a try!

I've been looking a long time for a good recipe for Insalata Caprese, and this is the one! The presentation is gorgeous, and there's a lot of flavour going on here. For a change, I substituted bocconcini cheese for the mozzarella, and added a little bit of balsamic vinegar, too. The boyfriend and family loved it. Thanks for sharing!

I used this recipe as a general guideline.  I added a side of spinach leaves and used a store bought greek feta dressing instead of making my own. Very good.

Made this a few hours before dinner and was not at all enthused.  None of my dinner guests were either.  One day later however, the leftovers are delicious.  I'd advise making this a day in advance to allow the seasonings to permeate the cheese.

This is one of my favorite salads to eat anytime of the year. If you can, try to get fresh buffalo mozzarella (made from water buffalo's milk instead of cow's milk)..it gives the salad a creamier taste. Also, try to chiffonade the basil.

This is SO GOOD especially when tomatoes are in season! I have also used the mozzarella that is in the little balls shape-just for fun-and threaded them on toothpicks with cherry tomatoes and basil, drizzled with the oil and salt.

This has been a staple in our home for awhile now.  We like it on a bed of spinach and then use balsamic vinaigrette over the top.  We then sprinkle the plate with raspberries, blackberries or blueberries.

I could eat fresh tomatoes, basil and mozzarella every day.  Definitely use really fresh ingredients - homegrown if possible.  Tasteless supermarket tomatoes don't deserve to be in a recipe like this!

I loved this recipe. I put salt, pepper and garlic powder directly on the tomato before adding the other layers. I was cooking for one so I only used one plum tomato and wished I made two. I might try the vinegar suggestion on the next one but this was yummy as is.

I used cherry tomatoes and mini mozzarella balls.  chopped up the basil, and tossed it all together with the oil, s&p and balsamic vinegar.  let it all reach room temperature (and soak up the liquid) before eating!

This is delicious, yummm!!  Another spin:  Once, in San Francisco, I had sun-dried tomatoes with melted fresh mozzarella on Italian bread with fresh basil, served with some kind of garlic olive oil for dipping.  It was fantastic.  Has anyone had something like this?

Simple, elegant, and tasty.  I love how this is the authentic recipe.  My husband has however asked for me to make the one using balsalmic vinegar next time. Oh well, suppose we should see which one we like more.  I served it to our Japanese friends who don't know how to cook Italian.  Served it with Bruschetta II, American Lasagna, Roasted Garlic Bread, roasted eggplant, and My Mother in Laws Eclair Cake.  Wonderful line up.

The beauty of this recipe lies in its simplicity. I did follow the more Sicilian method (with balsamic and fresh garlic) and used smaller Campari tomatoes. It made a perfect appetizer and is now a house favorite!

This was super easy to prepare and was very light and refreshing on the palate.  Next time i think i'll cut the basil into thin strips though as it was a little difficult to eat whole.

I have eaten this salad many times since arriving in Italy. It is one of my favorite recipes. I sometimes add italian spices sprinkled on top if I do not have fresh basil around. Great for an appetizer or a quick lunch. I always use bocconcini, the smaller fresh moz. balls. I imagine the packaged cheese would not even compare to this.

Fantastic and easy!  I used only a fraction of the EVOO and added a very light drizzle of aged Balsamic as well.  Choose quality tomatoes and cheese for an out of this world treat.

I like to chop up the basil and put it on top of the mozzarella.  My kids eat it better this way (vs. large leaf).  I boil down some basalmic vinegar and pour on top.  Delicious.  There are never any leftovers.

My family's enjoyed this recipe many times over the years; we never tire of it. It's a good base from which to add your own special touches. And one of my favorite variations is fresh asparagus spears that have been cooked slightly and chilled to room temperature. Vary the dressings according to what you're serving as a main course. I often use flavored olive oils or balsamic.

This was a terrific summer salad idea. I believe the fresh ingredients are what make this dish. I used fresh basil from my garden and garden fresh tomatoes. I found some mozzarella at a local market that was delicious. I drizzled just the olive oil as directed at first to this dish. However my basil is at peak and very strong flavor, so I drizzled a bit of Balsamic vinegar and the toned down the basil and I liked it much better with both oil and vinegar. Great appetizer idea for summertime when ingredients are fresh.

I've always seen people make these. Didn't think about doing this myself until I got into having fresh basil all the time. This was a nice little treat for myself and my girls...my guys...aren't into fresh basil and tomatoes...so they passed. But I did serve multi grain crackers with this and my girls totally ate the plate gone. Nice little light lunch on the run or a light snack before a big meal. TY!

Made it for a dinner party 2 hours ahead to let the flavors marry.  I lined them alternating on a dinner tray to see all the colors.  On one line, I sprinkled balsamic vinegar--because that is my favorite.  That was the first line to go!  None left and the room was absolutely quiet with everyone savoring this lovely appetizer!

We love to make this with summer tomatoes and the basil we grow in our garden.  Use the best olive oil you can find, as it makes a big difference. This is my teenage daughter's favorite lunch!

Tasty, beautiful and popular.  All good reasons to make this again and again. Served it as an appetizer with chunks of olive bread and olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the side. Even my toddler dished up a little plate for himself and enjoyed it. I used my home grown basil and next summer I am going to grow my own tomatoes just for this salad!

I agree with other users.  It's really good with balsamic vinegar, too!  If you want an extra little punch, green olives or capers are delicious with this as well.  I've also seen roasted red peppers used in this dish too.  All equally delicious!

The perfect summer salad when you have home grown beefsteak tomatoes. I also always add roasted red peppers (the kind you buy in a jar in the supermarket) and a little balsamic vinegar.  Delicious!

This is a delicious, refreshing, and simple recipe to make. The key is fresh ingredients, so I recommend buying local tomatoes and basil. Also, to add flavor, I diced my basil and added a little oregano and balsamic vinegar to the platter. It was a hit! Mmmm.

Great recipe!  I make it all the time.  As an alternative, try it with Provolone.  Its a little stronger tasting than fresh Mozzarella, but still great.

I have made this for the past several years, and we love it. My husband has decided this year that he really likes it with crumbled Blue Cheese in place of the Mozzarella. That's really good also.

I made this for 45 seniors at an independent living center. I used fresh New York State tomatoes, fresh m,ozzarella and beautiful fresh basil. I sliced all my tomatoes first and salted with kosher salt and gave a good grinding of fresh black pepper.
Every one got 2 slices of tomatoes and cheese and 2 basil leaves. I drizzled with EVOO and sprinkled with balsamic vinegar. OUTSTANDING!
Thanks for sharing!

This is one of my favorites, but I also sprinkle a little balsalmic vinegar on top for extra flavor.

As crazy as this sounds, if you omit the mozarella you still have a wonderful taste and it's filling. I ate 4 tomatoes myself yesterday with a touch of olive oil, salt, pepper and fresh basil for lunch. I also added balsamic and it was outstanding. Try it without the mozarella if you are on a diet like me :)

my husband made this as an appetizer for dinner tonight and what a delicious surprise!  I absolutely loved it.  I think that marinading the cheese a bit or dressing with some balsamic vinaigrette would really enhance the flavor and make it taste just like it does in Italy.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Family loved it (except for 10 yr old who "doesn't like vegetables").  I committed the big faux pas of using dried basil but in a pinch it worked.  I also added balsamic vinegar to the olive oil as one other reader suggested and it added great flavor!

Delicious, simple and elegant!  I was wondering what I was going to do with all the basil I'm growing this summer.  I found tomatoes on the vine that were smaller than normal, cut them in half and tore the basil leaves in half and they made great bite-sized appetizers.  I did add a sprinkling of balsamic vinegar as well as the olive oil.

My hisband and I love this. My son is a chef and I made this for him and he really liked it.
I also add a slice of cucumber and a slice of red oniion. It is very good.
This makes for a nice change from just a salad.

Caprese salad is always a hit at our home. Don't use the bars of cheese marked mozzerella cheese. Only the fresh balls (usually packed in water) will do for this salad.

This is the BEST side dish OR appetizer in the summertime! I like to use roma tomatoes because they are more firm and don't forget to reduce the olive oil and add minced garlic and balsamic vinegar before drizzling over it. Yummy!!

Excellent basic recipe.   I think we enhanced this recipe by sprinkling on some pine nuts.    The pine nuts seem to complement the flavor and add some texture.

Good Recipe, but if you want to kick it up to the next level, use Buffalo mozzarella cheese. Found in specialty cheese departments of large supermarkets.  Comes from Italy.  Good stuff.

DELISH!  I chopped the basil in slivers to top it...I even sliced some very thin slivers of garlic...I used red wine vinegar because my family isn't much for balsamic.  I've made it 5 times in 2 weeks!

The way I do it is put a slice of mozzarella then a tomato slice on top. Overlap these in a platter. sprinkle fresh garlic. In the summer I used fresh basil,oregano and parsley. Drizzle with olive oil. Salt and pepper to taste. Leave at room temperature. That is what makes it taste delicious.

Delicious, one of my favorite salads! I like to use the tomatoes on the vine, as I think they have the best flavor. I also add a drizzle of balsamic vinegar just for added flavor. 5-star recipe as written, but the balsamic just takes it over the top for me.

Well, I think you can never go wrong making this recipe. I can't even count how many times I've made it. I get a little worried when the tomato isn't ripe but it's always comes out delicious make sure to get FRESH mozzarella and fresh basil not too much olive oil and sprinkle sea salt. Delicious!

I made a small batch: 1 tomato, a few slivered basil leaves and a few slices of mozzarella drizzled with evoo and balsamic vinegar and I did take the advise of others and sprinkled a little garlic powder.  So dang good and I ate all of it in 3 minutes!  Maybe I'll control myself and let the flavors blend together the next time I make it - I'm sure it'll be AMAZING!

It was very lovely. I would have liked the oil to taste a little bit better, so I had to "doctor" it up a little with italian seasoning, but it was a big party hit.

I mix the oil, basil leaves and red wine vinegar (same amount as oil) in my food processor and drizzel over my on-the-vine tomatoes and Precious all-natural mozzarella cheese. Delicious!!  I'm addicted to this salad. So delicious and easy to make.

Excellent recipe.  Our family "trick" is to lay out the tomatoes and allow them to soak up good quality balsamic vinegar AND a spinkling of rosemary flavored salt for at least 30 minutes before assembling and eating.

This is one of my favorite foods. It's so easy to make, and SO delicious! I like to chiffonade the basil and sprinkle balsamic vinegar on top.  Also, I tried using grape tomatoes cut in half, each with a little slice of cheese on top.  So pretty and so good!

Heirloom tomatoes and fresh mozz is the only way to go with any Caprese. I think more EVOO and less Balsamic is better, but that is just this Italians taste.
This is truly a super summer treat!!!

You just have to buy bocconcini cheese which is with the ricotta cheese at most supermarkets.  Make sure you buy the largest pieces possible because they sell them in small pearls also.  Better yet, buy it fresh from an italian market.  I chopped the basil so I didn't have to eat the large whole leaves and sprinkled a cap full of balsamic over the plate.

After all what is better than home grown tomatoes, fresh basil, cheese, all drizzled with a high quality olive oil. Yum. Who needs dinner?  Just pair this salad with a good wine, and some fresh french bread to sop up the excess olive oil and your set.

I did all but the basil. I'm afraid I just didn't have the basil so I just added garlic salt with parsley! Loved it and eat the whole thing! ?? So amazing but not something I can have every day.

I followed the recipe, had smaller tomatoes so cut them up in to bite-sized pieces, as I did for the mozzarella.  Very good, I'll be interested in to try this next time with some drizzled balsamic!

The colors of the flag of Italy!  I slice the tomatoes (Roma when possible) and cheese as per the recipe.  I then plate them as described.  If I have fresh basil from my garden, I put one large leaf in with the cheese and tomato (tomato, cheese, basil, repeat...).  If all I can get is store bought, I roll up a bunch of leaves together, slice them into thin strips, then distribute them evenly over the tomatoes/cheese.  After that, there's a generous sprinkling of kosher salt, then into the fridge for about an hour (very important!).  I serve them with a quality olive oil and balsamic vingar (also very important) with a pepper grinder to pass around.  If there is ANY dish (salad, appetizer, entree, dessert, etc.) anywhere that requires less effort for so much great flavor, I have yet to find it.

Best with freshly picked heritage tomatoes.  Add a little salt and fresh ground pepper and you essentially have a meal in itself!

I used Organic Heirloom Tomato’s and chopped the basil so it was more evenly distributed.  I also added a bit of MiaBella Balsamic Vinegar.  The Heirloom’s really add a unique flavor which pairs well with the vinegar.

Absolutely wonderful !

I tore up the mozarella; ate the salad with toasted bread.

It can serve as a very light meal or starter.
