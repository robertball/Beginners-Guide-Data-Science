my mom has made this recipe (under a different name) for years.  She has made it with chocolate or pistachio pudding for a different twist!  She also doubles the recipe and makes it in a 9 x 13 pan for parties and such.

My children and I really enjoyed this recipe. We all love food with lemons. I however did make a couple of changes. I added more cream cheese in the bottm layer and left the cool whip for the topping. It was delicious!

So very tasty!  Used a pre-made graham cracker crust, and tried banana pudding.  Definitely will make again.

I love lemon, so I was so excited to find this recipe.  Unfortunately it was just OK for me.  I thought the pecan pie crust detracted from the flavor of the rest of the pie.  I may try this again with a regular pie crust.

This was a very good pie and an easy recipe. Next time I will coat the sliced bananas with lemon juice before I add them to the pie, as they browned fairly quickly and became somewhat soggy. Will make this pie again.

This is really good.  The crust is light and melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  I prefer this topping to the usual meringue and certainly the recipe is easy to put together, although I couldn't find instant lemon pudding in my store and had to make the cooked stuff.  Next time I MAY cut back a bit on the confectioners' sugar and add a wee bit of milk or cream to the cream cheese.  This is a fantastic pie.
