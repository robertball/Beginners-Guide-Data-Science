This is a great panini sandwich recipe! I made a vegan, slightly healther version: I used Westoy's "chicken style" seitan (http://www.westsoytofu.com/products/detail.html/seitan/chicken-style-seitan), Vegenaise egg-free mayo, and Daiya vegan cheddar cheese. I also spread olive oil on the outsides of the bread.

This sandwich was an interesting idea.  With the new year comes a push to be more nutrition conscious, and so I'm trying to sneak produce in wherever I can.  I don't usually care for fruit with meat, but I thought the apples in this created a pleasant sweetness and crunch.  It was mentioned that the chicken salad may be better cold, and I think that might be true.  I did make a couple of changes, I used swiss and cheddar which made the salad a bit sharper tasting, and used walnuts instead of pecans.  I think I might like to try this cold, but it was good.  For the record, if you're thinking of getting a panini maker, they are a real life saver a the end of a busy weekday, it took me 20 mins to make the chicken salad, and then I had these sandwiches assembled and grilled in ten minutes.

These panini's ROCK!  I didn't have Dijon so I used regular mustard.  I also used 2T. plain yogurt and 2T. Mayo instead of just 1/4 cup Mayo,  and I used wheat bread instead of white.  (I'm always looking for little ways to make my food a bit healthier!)  I did love the walnuts and apples in this recipe because it gave such a nice twist.  It didn't make a difference to me for the mix to be cold, because the cheese melted nicely over everything.  I threw these in the George Foreman for a quick and easy dinner my whole family enjoyed! Yumm-O!

This was my FIRST recipe and try at a panini.  It was a great starter recipe.  I didn't use the dill, apple, or pecans.  Instead I put onions, parsley, and cilantro.  It was delicous!!

super easy.  my husband & I loved it.  Last night I made it for a second time.  I only had Monterey Jack cheese so that's what I used.  I also added a little bit of seasoned salt to give it a little kick.  I doubled the amount of chicken to 2 cups and there was more than enough sauce. It was delicious.

Really yummy and easy to make.  I did the chicken salad ahead of timeto let the flavors blend and toasted the pecans a little.  A huge hit with my little ones!

Wow, never would I have thought to make a Panini with chicken salad. It's fantastic. I didn't really follow the recipe, more the idea! I don't want all that bread so I used 2 slices of Whole Wheat. I didn't really think cheese would be that great so I left it off. Used toasted slivered almonds. I didn't have an apple but I used sweet onion, celery and red bell pepper. Easy to play around with & my end result was fantastic. Thanks for broadening my mind to the fact that you can grill chicken salad.

This was soooo good. I made it with chicken once, and the next time I used diced ham and left out the apples. A very quick, easy and yummy recipe!

This was delicious!!  I used ciabatta bread and instead of the chives I used green onion!  Love the crunch the apple gives to this.  Thanks!

I just made the salad without putting it in a panini. I added baby spinach, tomatoes, olives, and balsamic vinegar, and it was delicious!

A little too much dill for my taste.  Otherwise this was a delicious sandwich.

This can really go either way.  the first time I made it, it turned out great. I used French Bread instead of White bread and I think I used a little less apple for fear I wouldn't like it (I also don't like pecans, so they werwe left out entirly).  This last time, I used white bread and a little more apple and I wasn't as big of a fan.  I will def make again, just less apple and I will probably go back to the french bread.

Really tasty!  Added a smidge of chopped red onion to the salad, and omitted the pecans. Good hot or cold!  Used thick slices of french bread, buttering the outsides- will make again!

I liked this, but it could definitely use a little more punch. I used jewish rye bread (because it makes such good paninis) and left out the cheese. I think next time I will add more mustard and some additional treats like hot peppers, more apple, and maybe some other veggies.
