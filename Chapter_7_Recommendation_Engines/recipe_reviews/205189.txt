Yummy, moist and healthy! I didn't have apple butter so per another user's suggestion, I used applesauce instead. These turned out great! The spices are just the right amount. And only 1 point if you're a WW person :)

These were pretty good. I made half of the batch with nuts, the other without. I personally liked them better without the nuts, but that's just because I'm not a big fan of walnuts. I really liked the fluffy texture. These are lightly, not overly spiced. For some reason every time I make pumpkin cookies I have an allergic skin reaction so I have to wear latex gloves :-P Edit: Beware! These cookies get very sticky on the surface after a while. It doesn't affect the taste, but it is kind of weird.

TASTEY!! It's the end of August and I pulled out a pkg of pumpkin puree (AR's Pumpkin Puree) I had in the freezer... and then goodness happened:) As I was adding the spices I got an excited flutter in my stomach reminding me of Fall and all things autumn. Thanks for an excellent recipe. I changed a couple things out of necessity(didn't have on hand or allergy) but I'm sure it didn't change the main objective or flavor/texture, it came out as described. Changes: whole wheat instead of all purpose flour, allspice instead of pumpkin pie spice, applesauce instead of apple butter and chocolate chips instead of walnuts(allergy). Very good recipe!!!

I thought they were pretty good, but they were kind of mushy on the inside. I would add a minute to the bake time, but besides that, they were fine.

I LOVE these!  I thought they might be a little heavy on the spices, but the balance was perfect, and I love the slightly different texture the oats add.  These will be in my favorite cookie file for sure!  I didn't add the nuts, no one here likes nuts, but the light muffin like texture is perfect!

I don't like pumpkin, but made these for my son's school.  Everyone loved them and my step-dad said they were like pumpkin bread, only cookies.

I thought I'd get into the fall spirit with these cookies. They were very good. I didn't have any apple butter, so I used applesauce. I will make again.

Excellent cookie! It is the combination of the spices, pumpkin and apple butter that make this recipe a real treat. As I was mixing this up I wondered how shredded carrots and Crasins would go, so I tried it! 
make them small. You won't need more than 2 to feel satisfied!

i love pumpkin! this was average, expected more. if you think  of it as little drops of cake instead of a cookie, you may enjoy it better. i looked up a 5 star cream cheese frosting to add some flavor and it was better. think i'll rename these "iced pumpkin puffs"! probably will try another recipe though....just being honest!

Delicious if you like pumpkin spice cake.  This is very similar but in small little round packages.  I made these for a friend in the hospital that loves pumpkin bread along with a chocolate chip recipe from this site.  He shared the choc chop cookies w/ his friends, but no one was allowed any of his #1 pumpkin spice cookies.

These were more like a bread than a cookie.  Too thick and doughy for my families liking. I did like the accumulation of spices and the use of apple butter, but the final outcome just wasn't enjoyable.

I left out the walnuts just because we don't like them but left everything else the same. Super moist and very, very soft. Delicious!

These were just OK for me, not very sweet, so they're good with coffee in the morning.  You have to be very careful not to over bake or if they're the least bit dry, they're not very good.  I'm spoiled though, my very favorite cookie is TOH Pumpkin Chip Cookie they had in there magazine back in 2002, which I've had to doctor up with additional spices, they're to die for, but not as healthy as these cookies because they have lots of butter!  No wonder they're better, oh well.  It's always fun to try new ones.

These cookies were fabulous! They were easy to make, and reminded me of the fall season. I used pecans instead of walnuts, and I used more pumpkin spice, instead of ginger and nutmeg. The only downfall to these cookies is that they grew a sticky residue on the outside of them. Other than that, they were delicious!

These were not great. I felt adding the pumpkin pie spice was redundant, as it is made of several of the other ingredients already on this list. They are very bland to me, and a little heavy on the walnuts. Because of the blandness, I had to give it three stars. Maybe chocolate chips would bring them to another level.

I am so surprised.  These were very bland.  Odd, chewy texture.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I wasn't surprised that they were chewy, but I was surprised that they tasted awful.  I'm not a fan of wasting food, so we made a ginger spiced glaze that has at least made these edible.  We will not be making this recipe again.

I'm totally obsessed with these cookies!  Warmed for a few seconds in the microwave, they make a super delicious bedtime snack.  In addition to walnuts, I also add dried cranberries.  As well, I make large cookies, so this recipe ends up making about 28.   Baking time in my oven is about 14 min (instead of 12), but not all ovens are the same.

Mine turned out a little dry.  I used Quaker Oats (slow cooking type), the oats were a little leathery, but the taste was wonderful!  Because they were dry, and kind of tall, I sliced them and filled them with butter cream frosting (with pumpkin spice).  I called the.

These were ok..they weren't sweet  and the flavors were subtle so before i was done baking the batch I was already tweeking the rest. Had some apple pie filing so I cut the apples into smaller pieces, added more brown sugar, nutmeg and pumpkin spice and they were great..made cream cheese frosting to top it off and they were great!

Theses are really good!  My brothers who don't like pumpkin liked these. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly!
