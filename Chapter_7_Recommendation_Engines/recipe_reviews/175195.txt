This was so.... yummy! I made sure to put this in my recipes.  I doubled the recipe and it served 4 adults and 4 children.  I took julienned carrots and sauteed them in the same mixture of coconut oil, garlic and ginger until they were soft but still a little crispy.  Then I added a bag of frozen veggies (red pepper, green pepper and onions) to the carrots then added more hoisin sauce.  When the veggies heated up I put the chicken in and mixed it all up.  We had this on top of rice and it was delicious!  I will be making this again soon.

Servings are very small - I barely got three out of it.  I added snow peas in, but I would recommend adding more vegetables to balance out the chicken.  Other than that, the flavor is very good.

This recipe was great! I had to post a review because it was so good. I just bought virgin raw coconut oil & was looking for a recipe for it.  I didn't have hoisin sauce so I substituted thick teryaki sauce & it was so good & so quick. This will def. become a 'go to' recipe for me. Thank you!

I really liked the flavor of this dish-- sweet but not too sweet, with interesting flavors. Adding veggies stretches the servings-- I added green beans, thinly sliced carrots and quartered mushrooms. The mushrooms, especially, added a really nice flavor. I cooked the chicken first then removed with a slotted spoon and stir-fried the veggies in the remaining sauce. Added some salt at the table-- next time would add 1/2 tsp or so to the pan. Great to have a stir-fry recipe that's so easy but with depth-- will make again!

Very easy and tasty.  The only thing I needed to change with this recipe was to increase the amounts because I had 1.4 lbs. of chicken thighs to work with (I prefer thighs to breasts in stir fry).  I also threw in some fresh chopped asparagus to add some veggies to our meal.  Turned out great.  Even my 14-month-old loved it.  It's nice to have some recipes on here that use coconut oil.  It is a great, healthy alternative to the more common oils and adds a touch of flavor.

I added asparagus for the last 2-3 minutes. It added vegetables, but very few calories, and a lot of crunch to the dish!

Subbed in teriyaki instead of hoisin, and didn't have any fresh ginger so I threw in some spice instead. Turned out great! But o threw in some frozen stir fry veggies but they had a little too much water in them so the flavors of the chicken were stifled.

It was quick, simple and awesome. I also added some yellow pepper. My 2-yr old couldn't get enough of this dish. Thanks!

Next time try putting the same ingredients in the ingredients list as you have in the picture... I wanted to cook what I saw in the picture and shopped for different ingredients...

Good for a quick stir-fry but I prefer making my own sauces.
