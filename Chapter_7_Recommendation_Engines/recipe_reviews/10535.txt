This is a wonderful and very easy recipe to make. I had so many requests for it this year I had to make 500 cookies. I found that with about a quarter of a cup less flour it worked great and was much easier, and faster in a cookie press. I decorated with M&M's and Rosebuds which bake with a wonderful toasted chocolate taste. This is my third year making them and will make this recipe for years to come. Everyone in my family has requested the recipe, and asked that I bring it every year for Xmas. Merry Christmas everyone :o)

This is THE classic recipe for traditional Scottish shortbread (the ONLY shortbread)  The others pale in comparison. Ironically, the simplest and easiest!

I was in the mood to experiment with a recipe that I could use to make cookies on a stick. This was a winner. Nice buttery flavor and the sticks stayed in the cookies. These also held up to the handling when I iced them. I did add some vanilla to the recipe.  I am going to try lemon or almond as well. Thanks for the recipe.

I used this recipe today and added a a touch of my own ....I added some lemon zest to the sugar before mixing into the butter. It added a nice aroma and a slight citrus taste to these delicious cookies.
I used small animal shaped cutters and made my own zoo of animal "crackers"
Thanks for sharing this easy and delicious recipe.

I just made a batch of Valentine cut-out cookies for my kids school's birthday party.  The dough is extremely easy to handle unlike other cutout cookie recipes I have used.  I like them as they are not too sweet but my kids find them just 'okay'.  I put 'red sugar sprinkles' for decoration.  They come out rather pretty.  I will make it again for cut-out cookies.  I have added 1/2 tsp of vanilla; but I may add another 1/2 tsp next time to enhance the flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated and they turned out perfectly!  Friends were so eager to take them home when I made them for the first time yesterday, that I've had to make more today!  For those reviewers that found the dough too hard to handle/sticky, I suggest perhaps the dough was not chilled enough.  Also, rolling out the dough between greaseproof/wax paper might help.  I added vanilla extract in my second batch, and although delicious, I think I prefer them just as the recipe states.

A lot of butter but oh so good.  I usuallly make shortbread with a recipe that includes cornstarch but these don't have that dry taste.  Will be making this one again! I baked them about 22 min and my oven temp is exact but mine were probably a bit thicker than 1/4"

Followed previous reviewers advice and rolled into balls, pressed down on center and baked (like a thumbprint cookie).  Cooled them and filled with holiday jelly from Stonewall Kitchen.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar. Oh My gosh!!! These were heavenly! Very quick too!

Fabulous! Do resist writing a review after eating this cookie straight from the oven though . It is shortbread and it needs a little time to 'mature'. If it's eaten as soon as it's done, the buttery taste is very overwhelming and blah. Save it for a day(or two!) and come back and let me know if this isn't the most delicious shortbread recipe there is!

The taste of this cookie is the only reason I gave this 3 stars. I doubled the recipe and followed it to a T. When I tried to knead the dough and roll it out - DISASTER. It fell apart, stuck to the well floured/icing sugared rolling pin, and wouldn't cut out. It was a nightmare. Like I said, after 2 hours of working with the dough in SMALL batches and finally getting it to cut out, the taste was awesome. Totally not worth the hassle though. I'll use a different recipe next time because there's other just as tasty but easier to make shortbread cookies out there.

I made this recipe because I had too much flour leftover from other cookie baking. These were gone before the cookies I spent hours to make. Be careful because they can fall apart easily. A great recipe if you need something quick.

this is a great recipe, they turned out great.  I did not cut them out, I use about a tablespoonful at a time and rolled them into ball and pressed red and green cherries in the centre for the Christmas look.  They looked and tasted great.

For taste, I would give this 10 stars.  Melt in your mouth, buttery cookie.  Let edges LIGHTLY brown on cookie, too.  Brings out the nuttiness of butter.  I did try to use this in my cookie press with frustrating results.  Could be my press, though.  I wrapped up the rest to chill in fridge. Will press into round pans, prick with fork, bake and cut into wedges.

yummm....tastes great and so simple to make.  if you are using cookie cutters i would recommend using larger ones as it was tough to get the smaller shapes to turn out right with the dough.

Yummy!  Very good!  I added a lemon glaze over cooled cookies for a bit of flavor, as they were a bit bland.

Just what a shortbread is supposed to be: not too sweet, and when you break it apart, you can see the flaky layers :) What I liked about this one is that it keeps its shape and crumbles IN your mouth, not before you get it there. And, if you're a clumsy one like me, no worries...when you drop them, they don't break! After years of searching, this is going to be my shortbread recipe. Thanks a lot!

This is a great recipe, with few ingredients. It tastes exactly like the authentic Scottish shortbread I had at the Highland Games this year at Ligonier, PA. Only reason it has 4 stars is because roll-out and cut cookies are so much more time consuming than drop cookies. They are not too sweet,  but very rich and would be delicious paired with a dark roast coffee.

This recipe is awesome.  I had my husband measure out the flour and he used a wet measuring cup and it still worked out great.  I will keep this for years.  To counteract the "lack" of seasoning other reviewers complained about -- we added about 1/2 tsp of freshly-grated nutmeg.  It gives the cookies a hint of flavor.  These are wonderful!

I tried this just his morning and was disappointed. My children did not care for them. There was no taste to them.

They kept their shape great. But the taste was very dull and blah. Would not make this again. I was very disapointed.

Very good, simple recipe.  Worked great.  I actually completely melted the butter (I almost always do that for the sake of thorough mixing, though it doesn't always come out right).  Also ran out of flour, so had to use an extra 1/2 cup of sugar and reduce flour by about 1/2 cup.

Sprinkled with powdered sugar fresh out of the oven so sugar would melt slightly.  Made a delicious fresh cookie, and still tastes good the next day when stored in tin foil with a loose seal (they were still warm and I wanted to go to bed).

We didn't really like this shortbread recipe.  The dough was easy to work with and held its shape well but I found the cookies bland.  They tasted too much like flour.  I would suggest reducing the amount of flour in the recipe if you are going to make them.

These taste pretty good - light, crispy and buttery - but mine did not keep their shape at all. I'm hardly the world's best cookie maker, so I'm not surprised they didn't work for me. Oh well. Thanks, anyway.

This would be great as a base for something, like jam and fruit.  It's a bit bland.  Still, I can see using this for nice teas.

Really really great recipe. Light and crisp and melt in your mouth all at the same time. Love the simplicity of this recipe too. I’ve made this a few times, always with consistently good results. One thing I did a little different after having trouble rolling dough after chilling was to roll the dough right after mixing it, and then chilling. Way easier to roll, chills quicker, and I can cut them and cook them on a whim, great for late night sweet attack. The dough really wants to stick to the pin when I’m rolling it warm, so I go really slow, use minimal flour for dusting, but I keep my pin well floured. As I’m rolling very slowly, I’m watching to make sure the dough isn’t sticking, and if I see it does, I immediately back the pin up, going back the way I came. It will fix the would be hole in my dough. I’ve dipped these in chocolate, and used orange or lemon zest, and today I’m making a batch with dark choc chips for a going away basket I’m making for a coworker.. soon, I will be using this recipe as my shortbread for my new cookie business:) thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe turned out great for me! I only has 1 1/2 cups of butter so I only used 3 1/2 cups of flour ! I added vanilla1tsp and 1/4 almond extract for a great flavor right out of the oven!! Will definitely use this recipe again and again!

This is one of the easiest rolled cookie dough recipes out there!  I would add a bit of flavoring next time, but I was amazed how nicely it rolled out.  No more sugar cookies for me!

Is it the use or the amount of confectioner's  sugar that makes this a little too sweet for my taste? A nice recipe for roll-out cookies, otherwise. We prefer a little more buttery flakiness and found this was a little too sweet only.

These are so very easy and delicious.  I put it in a cookie press and made little trees and they turned out so festive.. I have made these several years now and they have always turned out perfect.. Love it, thanks for sharing.

I like the fact that there are only 3 ingredients. The dough was pretty difficult for me to work with though, and the cookies crumbled easily when transferred from cookie sheet to cooling rack. I don't particularly like the taste because there isn't enough sugar for me, but my friend who was helping me loved it. So I guess it depends how big of a sweet tooth you have.
