This recipe was so easy, but I didn't have Liquid Smoke, so substituted Dale's Seasoning instead.  The result was amazing.  Our party guests loved them!

I had a recipe like this years ago and it also called for bourbon. So I added a generous splash.  It was a hit today!

The grandchildren loved this, but the adults would have preferred Little Smokies instead of all beef wieners. The sauce is great. I used hickory BBQ sauce instead of liquid smoke, as the submitter suggested in the cook's note.

I don’t recommend making these...unless you’re prepared to gorge yourself! They’re awesome, super simple, and cheap. I make them as a snack for me and the husband at home on Football Sundays.

Absolutely fell in love with this recipe! Easy, economical and yummy. I didn't have liquid smoke so I used Allegro Marinade instead. My Husband took it for pool night and they cleaned it out!! Thank you for this recipe--it's not only my new go to recipe, but my daughter's favorite.
