Made this for guests tonight, and they all had seconds (some thirds).  It makes quite a bit!!!  Things I did differently:  I breaded the chicken pieces with a mixture of 1 c flour, 1/2 t garlic powder, 1/2 t salt, 1/2 t cayenne pepper.  Then sautéed the same. Removed the chicken and used the 1 c water to deglaze the pan.  Added the rosemary and lemon zest to the water.  Reduced it a little.  Added the chicken and sauce back in, and followed remaining directions.  Pretty delicious!

The sauce itself was bland. The lemon was the only flavor we caught.

I will start off saying we all enjoyed this dish. I did make a few mods, though, due to convenience and preference. We had dried rosemary on hand and like Blender Woman, I've never cooked with fresh rosemary or sprigs of any kind. I wanted to avoid the bits stuck in our teeth. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts as I'm the only person in our household that eats chicken thighs, not to mention how much more work that would be. I had lemon juice on hand and much prefer its flavor to zest so I used that in its place. Our store only had regular rigatoni so that's what I used for the pasta part. Quite a few changes but I believe it still had the same base flavors. I really liked the zing the lemon gave the sauce!

I was really surprised at how much we liked this. I never buy jarred sauces, since I like to make my own, however the simple addition of rosemary and lemon really transformed this whole dish. It tasted homemade! To make the chicken easier to chop, sauté the chicken thighs whole, then chop when cooked. Also chop up the rosemary.  A great recipe to have on hand for busy week nights.

We thought this was pretty good. I really like the hint of lemon. I did use chicken breasts since that is what I had. I sauteed the chicken with garlic, and onion. Also added extra seasoning to the sauce. Quick and easy.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  The directions are a little basic.  Olive oil is listed in ingredients and 2 tablespoons is way too much for sauteing the chicken. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I finely chopped the rosemary and my family decided 1 sprig was not enough.  Next time I will use 2.  It was quick and easy to make.

I really liked this one.  I cheated a little and used frozen pre-cooked breaded chicken but it allowed me to go from rolling boil to table in about 15 minutes.  Nice flavors, quick meal; what's not to like?

My family loved this recipe! I added chopped bacon and cooked it with the chicken (bacon makes everything better :) It was easy to put together and didn't take too long to prepare. I kept to the recipe except for the bacon but if you're trying to eat healthier I think it would still taste great as posted. My husband and I were stuffed but still wanted more. My little girl even ate left overs.

I thought this was a really easy and delicious meal.  I liked how the lemon zest brightened up the sauce.

Due to my family's taste buds I added extra garlic and lemon zest than the recipe called for which I think made it much tastier.  The recipe is easy to follow and make and is family friendly.

This was a nice dish, quick and easy.  Any chicken dish that has lemon zest or finely chopped rosemary works for me. My husband thought the sauce was a little bitter, but that may be because he doesn’t like a lot of garlic.

This was delicious! I used a leftover garlic red sauce from steak pizzaiola and it turned out great. I added a little extra seasoning but other than that, I followed the directions.  I had to use mezze rigatoni but I don't think that makes much of a difference. Thanks Barilla!

I can't say I have made or tasted anything like this. I really liked the undertone of the lemon. I bought a mini microplane grater and finally got the chance to it. One downside is I have never cooked with chicken thighs, where they had to be cubed before cooking. Oh my, did I find that time consuming. I would highly suggest a cut up version, of them, or have a really sharp knife or pair of scissors handy. I bought fresh rosemary, and have never used it before. I found that some of them can kind of get lodged in the teeth that size. I suggest maybe chopping them, if just a bit. I would have never thought of this unusual combination. I thought it was okay. It could use some additional sauteed vegetables as other than the seasonings the only additional main ingredient is the dark meat chicken.

I made this today for my neighbor who cut my lawn for me. I usually make my own sauce but this is good to keep on hand. The flavor was good. I did add 2 Tablespoons of tomato paste to the sauce. Easy and good. Next time I will add some onion, mushrooms and some red pepper strips. All 3 grocery stores in my town didn't the Mezzi Rigatoni so I had to use Barilla Mostaccioli.
