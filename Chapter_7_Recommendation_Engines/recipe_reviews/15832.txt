Definitely the BEST dish I have ever made, hands down! Perfect blend of fresh, fruity, and sweet. Combines the summer flavor of pineapple with the winter comfort of pie.

I gave this 5 stars for 2 reasons. First, this is the easiest pie I think I've ever made. Second, this is one of the most delicious pies I've ever made. For personal preference, I will have to cut the sugar in future pies. Thanks!

I made this for my mother's birthday dessert.  Only thing I did differently was add a pinch of salt, and I brushed the surface of the top crust with a little of the liquid from the pie so it would brown nicely.  Pie is as good warm as cold.  Very light and good.

This was okay...the flavour was really nice. I think that next time I try this pie, I will use crushed pineapple instead of the chunks. A great change from the usual!

This recipe was soo yummy!!My whole family gave it a five out five stars. I was a little unsure about making pineapple pie, but the reviews were good. The only thing I did differently was that I didn't add any lemon juice because I didn't have any on hand. Although it was awesome without it, i think the lemon would bring more flavor. I also only put in 1 cup of sugar. Thanks so much for the recipe!! :)

Way too sweet for me BUT I made this at the request of an aging uncle who loves pineapple pie with chocolate ice cream - and he loved it.

This turned out Amazing. I am not one for too much sugar so i cut the sugar to almost half, especially since i was using canned pineapples, which already contains alot of sugar and the outcome was perfection. I also prefer flavor in my deserts so I added 5ml of vanilla extract and 5ml of almond extract and sprinkled 5ml of cinnamon before mixing in the crushed pineapples. After it was ready i decorated it with dark chocolate (lines across and along). I will def. be making this more often. Thank you

I loved this pie!  And I'm not really a big fan of fruit pies either, but this was delicious.  It went over well with everybody.  I used canned pineapple, but other than that I kept it the same as the recipe.  I did drain the pineapple as I read in other reviews and I'm glad I did.  I can see how it wouldv'e turned out to watery if I hadn't.  I served it with almond extract flavored whipped cream and the flavors did really well together.  I will definily be making this again!

I used frozen pineapple (thawed first) and this was so easy. A great change from your traditional pie recipes and a big hit with the whole family.

I was very skeptical about pineapple pie, but was completely amazed when I made it.  I would recommend you let it cool fully before you cut it...we just couldn't wait!  Fresh pineapple made the difference, no spices or extra seasoning needed! Wonderful on a cold winter day. Yum!

I prepared this recipe exactly as is, using fresh pineapple. I didn't care for it but everyone else liked it. Beats the "usual" pie ;)

My dad used to swipe pineapple from the officers mess on his destroyer. I made this for him for Fathers day. I read the recipe and thought, wow thats a lot of sugar. Cut it back to one cup, nothing to think about. Still plenty sweet. Waiting for it to get cold, now. Good thing I made two!

This was delicious! I did double the filling because I had a good sized pie dish, and cut back the sugar a little, but it was so good! I definitely recommend trying this!

This looked beautiful out of the oven. I'm not sure what happened but this turned out to be a train wreck. It cooled completely and was super super runny all the way through. I'm gonna try to make it again as the family was looking forward to it I hope it turns out better this time.

I used fresh pineapple and used a bit more than 2 Cups  and this turned out so tasty! Was great warm about an hour out of the oven and also good the next day chilled but I think it was best when warm.

I followed the recipe as shown and it came out runny. Definitely missing a thickening agent. If I were to make it again I would add corn starch or tapioca, perhaps cook it on the stove a bit before baking.  Also cut back on the sugar.

What a great pie!  My mom loves pineapple so I made it for her and her game night friends,  It was so tasty, I'm afraid I will be making more Pineapple pie for more game nights.  Great job!  I put egg wash and sugar on top of the top crust but that's the only  addition or change that I made.

I will not be making this ever again. It is far, far to sweet. I cannot get over how sweet this was and how it killed the flavour of pineapple. I cannot understand the high ratings for this recipe, This is the first time I have ever rated any dish this low. If you want a good pineapple desert look elsewhere because this is not it. The texture of the filling was also not good at all. I have nothing good to say about this recipe in any way, shape or form. Terrible.

We love this pie! We make sure to use fresh pineapple. Normally we just use a whole pineapple which is about double the amount  added because 2 cups isn't enough to fill a 9 inch pie crust well.

This made a beautiful yellow pie for Easter.  I used cookie cutters to make Easter bunny cutouts from dough for the top crust.  I used fresh pineapple and reduced the sugar to 1 c per others' suggestions, and I subbed Eggbeaters for eggs.  The pie was a little flat, and I think I will try a deeper crust with more fruit next time.  But everyone liked it.  Thanks for the recipe!
