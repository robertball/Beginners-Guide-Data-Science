This is a great watercress soup recipe. I've been looking for something similar to one my Mum made up years ago and most other recipes have potato in them, which makes them far too filling. I've tried this a couple of times now and my only amendments would be a) using a vegetable bouillon - I used homemade chicken stock the first time and it was too fatty and b) using whipping cream as it's a slightly lighter texture. It also needs quite a lot of seasoning to bring out the flavour, which I prefer to add at the cooking stage. All in all a really tasty soup which is as nice cold as hot. Thanks!

Today I made this recipe for the first time.  I followed the recipe as written, which is my custom the first time I use it after I change it to fit my personal taste.  Happily I will in future make it with NO changes.  It is tasty, easy to make and makes an elegant presentation.  I think that it is destined to become a great company dish.

I purchased watercress because I have never used it before and wanted to try something new. I added dried basil, garlic powder and sriracha after stirring in the watercress to add some flavor. This was very easy and I will try it again.

I have never had watercress soup before. I was given a bunch of watercress and figured this was a good use of it. It is pretty good. It is a nice cold day soup. I sort of seems a little "one note" to me so I may add a little spice next time. But it was super easy to make.
