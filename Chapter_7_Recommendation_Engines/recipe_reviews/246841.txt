This was a delicious soup! Made it mostly following the instructions. Didn’t really add anything different. However I did use my instant pot so the order of cooking was a little different. I sautéed the onions and then added the garlic after the onions were nearly done. Then I added a little or Oregano And sautéed a little longer. I deglaze the pot with a little white wine.  I then added the 4 cups of water and the chicken soup base. I threw in two frozen clump together chicken breasts from Costco. I cook these for 25 minutes and then did natural release for 15 minutes. Took the meat out and shredded it threw it back in the pot added all the rest of the ingredients and it was amazing! Thank you thank you for sharing this recipe.

I make this often with different colored bell peppers and lots of onions  sauteed with chili powder and cumin, blooming the spices.  I add fresh tomatoes at the end and all the different colors are amazing.   We call this tortilla soup and squeeze a bit of lime to go with the avocado for serving.  It's a very healthy soup! Thanks for posting!

Ahhhhhmazing!!!  I put this up there as a Tie for #1 with a Chicken Tortilla Soup I found here on AllRecipes.  Minimal  changes made is I used already cooked shredded xcken the store makes out of the rotisseries that don't sell (helps with added flavor and also laziness),  I completely de-seeded the peppers just in case (will not do so next time for more spice) and I think my garlic cloves and large onion must have been really large because I didn't use all of them.   Wouldn't change a thing!  Thank you for not listening to your husband and sharing.  This is a keeper for sure - and I will always give due credit to SerenaBloom and AR =)  No pic as it was gone before the flash went off.

Easy, flavorful, I make mine spicier, matter of choice. Use rotisserie or left over chicken added at the end to save time. Breast meat is too dry for us. Used my own chicken broth but a good store bought one is good too, unsalted so you can control it. Don't know why one reviewer said it took ALL day! A bit of chopping but...we love lots of cilantro  & garlic and you can spice it up anyway you want. Thanks this is great!

This is a keeper/make again recipe! Delicious and very healthy.  Don’t fail to add the toppings of fresh cut pieces of not too soft avocado, chopped onion, fresh cilantro and the crumbled cheese (I found and used the kind specified at While Foods).  Toppings add even more interest and texture to the delicious soup. I appreciated the comments to not use overly dry chicken – – even though the chicken is in soup, moist pulled or cubed chicken is best. Thank you for this refreshing and tasty recipe!

Delicious. Used mild canned chopped jalapenos and the soup came out surprisedly with a little spice anyway! I used fresh sliced jalapenos for garnish into an extra kick. However what I will do next time is cut the onion down considerably. It was a little too oniony for my taste. Otherwise it was delicious.

This soup is a definite keeper! If you like Mexican cuisine you will love this soup! I  I think some additional zucchini, ellow squash, carrots , corn could be added  if you wanted to.

It was delicious on its own.

Very good and easy recipe. Light soup but filling! I didn't add the jalapenos until the end when it was served. Used chicken stock instead of bullion. Cooked the chicken in stock and used that stock as well (so I added about 6 cups of stock total). The last thing I did a little differently was add Orzo pasta when serving for those who like a chicken noodle soup. Definitely will be making again!

The broth was just meh, but with all the toppings it becomes quite a meal. Only difference was I cooked the chicken in the broth to give it flavor, I find just cooking chicken in water is bland.

Very good!  I will be making this again for sure.  Thank you for sharing!  The only thing I did different was cook this in the instant pot.  I sautéed the onion, garlic and some jalapeno then added the chicken broth, lime juice, more jalapeno and frozen chicken and cooked for 8 mins.  It was perfect!

Too much lime and as another reviewer said, not enough body. I added lots of other ingredients including garlic, cumin, another chicken cube, black pepper, mushrooms,  fajita seasoning and pepper to step it up. It was good with the additions but I didn't find the avocado added much to compliment the sour in the recipe.

This was good! I did make a few changes to my liking ?? I doubled the recipe -  I seared the chicken breast in avocado oil and baked in oven for 20 mins. Also, I added a can of black beans and pinto beans. Once I had added all ingredients, I placed squeezed limes in the soup while it simmered for about an hour. Served over white rice for my guys and quinoa for me. We topped with green onion, diced tomato, crumbly queso, cilantro, and a dab of sour cream and to cut the heat ?? I think I heavy handed the jalapeños. Will def make again!

The preparation of this soup took all day because I didn't have the correct cheese.  I decided to make  it  since I had the time and it was relatively easy.  The soup  turned out delicious but next time I would just use feta.  The soup was even better the next day and the addition of tortilla chips gave it a nice crunch.  I will be making this again! Thanks

It's weird looking back on recipes from when I was new to cooking. I make this so differently now. For one, I use the instant pot to cook the chicken breasts in a heavily seasoned broth. I shred them into relatively big chunks. For the soup itself, I use 2 large sweet onions, 6 cloves of garlic, 3 celery ribs, 4 carrots, cilantro (stems and leaves), avocado, lime, etc. I saute the onions until fragrant and stir in the garlic. Saute for a minute or two more and remove to a bowl. In the same pot, over high heat, I flash fry the jalapenos.  Remove those to a separate bowl. Add the celery (finely diced), sliced carrots, onions and garlic. Saute for a couple of minutes and deglaze with good quality stock. Season this with onion powder, garlic powder, powdered oregano, lots of cumin, fresh black pepper, a bay leaf, and sea salt. Allow this to simmer until the vegetables are tender. Reduce the heat and finely mince the cilantro stems. I stir this into the broth along with the jalapeno and chicken, season with lime juice and ladle into bowls. Top with fresh cilantro leaves, avocado, and a soft melting mexican cheese and more lime juice if you desire. Much more body and depth of flavor. Always taste your soup as its cooking and adjust the seasoning. I use a lot of aromatics, typically. We love cumin around here.

I really enjoyed this soup. It would be a great soup to have on hand when I’m sick. I used rotisserie chicken instead of in cooked chicken. I also used reduced sodium chicken broth instead of the powdered chicken broth.

We loved this soup!  It was really easy to make and so tasty!  The only things I did differently was I used a yellow onion instead of white, a rotisserie chicken and cojita cheese because that is what we had at home.  I will be making this often as we have a lime tree and it gives us something to use the limes in.

This is my favorite soup to make. I opted to use chicken broth instead of bouillon and add more liquid, only because I find this recipe a little “dense” and prefer a more liquify soup myself. I love how mexican influenced this is. Absolutely perfect ??

Made this for our Shabbat meal and we loved it.  I tweaked it by sauteeing the onions and some hatch chilies in some schmaltz and olive oil before adding garlic along with some fresh ground cumin and a bit of oregano and crushed red pepper.   I used homemade stock seasoned w salt and pepper and the cilantro, but added cubed fish instead of chicken.  We loaded our bowls with avocados, fresh jalapenos, and shredded cabbage then ladled the soup over garnishing w cilantro and green onions.

This soup is so delicious and different!  I modified it a little based on what I had on hand, like I usually do, but the what a great base recipe to start with.  I substituted roasted hatch peppers for jalapeno, made chicken bone broth, used frozen sousvide chicken breasts and shredded in chunks by hand, and added diced tomatoes. Next time, I  might add frozen corn and some black beans. The combination of spicy, savory, and tart, with the texture of avocado are delightful. I just add the avocado last and ladle into bowls to maintain the texture.  I will definitely make this again!

It's so simple and good! I used part of a rotisserie chicken. Don't forget the onion, avocado, cilantro, queso fresco on top. I think that's what really makes it awesome!

Increased the herbs and garlic. Added frozen corn. Served with rice for added body. Hubby had with chicken. I ate it without. Great both ways.

OMG......Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  I usually have to double or triple this because my family likes it so much!!! It is truly better than anything I have had in a restaurant!  The only thing I do differently, I put all the onion and cilantro in with the soup!  Thank you again!!!

Delicious!  Thanks for sharing.  The flavours blend perfectly.  I threw in a can of corn, just because.  However, it would be wonderful exactly as is.  It is difficult to find queso fresco where I live.  Ricotta or paneer are good substitutes.

Loved this soup! And will definitely make it again.  I’d been looking for another clear broth based soup to add to my winter basics and this fits the bill very nicely. Used left over rotisserie chicken and ready made low sodium chicken stock/broth. And since queso fresco is not readily available where I live, used feta cheese instead. Thanks for not listening to your hubby and sharing this recipe

I loved the flavor of this soup! It had the perfect amount of spicy hotness. I sauteed the onions first and added the garlic and broth and a few slices of the pepper to infuse more in the broth. I cooked the chicken in the broth, then pulled it out to cut up and returned to the soup. I used some shredded cheddar-jack instead of the queso and it was declicious!

Very Good.  I will make it again!  I substituted 3 C of bone broth plus 1 C water instead of the bullion and 4 C water.  Used a small can of jalapenos, half the large onion (based on other reviews), and mozzarella cheese.  Topped with sour cream to cut some of the heat and green onions.  Very good combo of flavors1

This soup is kind of amazing. The depth of flavor is really lovely. Like,comforting and refreshing at the same time. We didn’t bother with the cheese, we thought the avocado was perfect alone.

I did not make any changes.  I love this soup!  It is thin so make sure you add plenty of the toppings at the table.  The spiciness of the lime infused broth marries well with the fresh cilantro, onion, avocado and queso fresco.  I will make this again and again.

All the ingredients I love in one dish!
You have to LOVE lime, but if you do, this is a WINNER.   I did use Costco rotisserie chicken to save time. 
My sister and daughter came the next day and cleaned me out. 
Next time I will double the recipe and add more jalapeños.  
All the time is spent chopping the ingredients. Otherwise it’s a quick meal. 
Thanks for sharing this one!!

I'll start by saying I LOVE lime, so when I saw this I knew I had to try it.
I didn't have queso, which imo didn't really matter too much.
Will definitely be making this whenever I'm in the mood!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I had to make one substitution, and added a bit to it, but the general flavor profile was great. The addition was in the form of chili powder, just because I'm a New Mexican and I have different spice standards then a lot of the folks who post recipes here. Also, I made it for my boyfriend, who is allergic to cilantro, so I substituted fresh dill, and that turned out really great! Either way, this was an incredibly easy recipe that got great results.

Thank you for the recipe! This was amazing! I don’t think it was too much lemon at ALL as some reviewers said! As a matter of fact, I added more lemon right before serving. I am big fan of lemon and lime. 

I followed the recipe with minor adjustments to my liking and convenience. I also used the rotisserie chicken as one reviewer mentioned. This made it more flavorful. For chicken stock, I ALWAYS use “Better Than Bouillon” roasted chicken flavor. I even added some ghost pepper for some EXTRA kick! Again? Thank you. I’d give it 10 stars if there was any.

My husband doesn’t like jalapeños so I substituted with some crushed red pepper flakes- I also had to use 1 lemon in place of one of the limes. But, it was still delicious! Light enough to eat year round! Thank you for sharing!

Very good but I only got a small bowl the first time so I made it again. Used 3 jalapeños to spice it up more. No worries of having leftovers.

I'm going to rate the recipe 3 stars as written.  It has winning ingredients, however I found it to be bland and without body, mostly tasting of lime and water.  No fault of the submitter, soups in general need to be seasoned to taste.

I was able to turn it into a 5 star recipe by adding LOADS more garlic, more chicken bouillon (to taste), a dash of pepper, and introducing cumin to the recipe (to taste).  After those additions, this recipe was out of this world.

Very tasty! I also made it without chicken and added two cans of black beans to make it meatless.

Wowza! Favorite new soup! Will be a regular, for sure. The flavors are delightful! I used a rotisserie chicken and stock, and added a pinch of cumin. Can’t wait for my next bowl!

I found the recipe and shared it with my husband. He wasn’t interested.  But I decided to make it anyway. When I started,  he came into the kitchen to try to find out what was smelling so good. He absolutely loved it. He said please please make that again.

I used a quart of chicken broth instead of water and bouillon. I garnished the soup with seasoned tortilla strips. This is a fresh, green, alittle heat chicken soup!

Loved it. Used a box of chicken bone broth from the pantry and added a tsp of "Better than Bouillon" chicken base.

Otherwise, made as directed.  For just the two of us, 2 large Haas avocados would be enough for first night and left overs.

Will use the third for guacamole.  Warm corn tortillas and butter would be yummy with this, too, to change it up from chips... whatever's on hand.    Thanks for a great recipe.  I had it all in my fridge and just had to run out for fresh avocados.  Also added a dollop of Crema Salvadorena on top, but sour cream would work.

Used more tasty remnant bones and scraps (some from smoke roasted chicken!) instead of the 'ole dry (even when poached!) stringy breast and generated my own stock with enough flesh from the bone carcasses. Used an entire "grocery store" bunch of coriander to get a cup of chopped leaves. Very, very, tasty and hummin' with the fresh herb and the lime.

Great taste, very nice change of pace from my regular soup lineup.  I did only use 1 jalapeno to match the heat factor I prefer.

It was very good, I was nervous because it didn't call for any powder spices but I resisted and made it just as recipe said except only one jalapeno because I know how sensitive my boy can be and it was great! I'm making it again tonight!

Maybe the best recipe I have ever made. My wife said it was the best soup she has ever had.  It was the fresh lime juice that really knocked it out of the park. Spicy but not too spicy. We need more recipes like this.

NO changes...it is AMAZING...I think I would cut back on the jalapeños because I almost had to bring the first extinguisher out! LOL...But, it is delicious soup and I will make it again and again. Love the dollop of sour cream and the more cilantro, the better!!

This dish is amazing! I was hesitant to top it with raw white onion, but boy was I glad I did! Citrusy, spicy, crunchy, creamy.... The flavors and textures made it foodie heaven! I used Monterey Jack cheese and chicken base (from a jar) to make the broth.  I will definitely make it again!

Very delicious!  It was a bit too spicy for me, so I removed the seeds in the jalapenos and only used 1/2 of the onion.  Otherwise, it was fabulous!

My husband and I really liked this soup. It would make a refreshing summer soup.  We used big juicy limes, so it had a strong lime flavor. I also cut the ribs and seeds out of the jalapenos, so it wasn't quite as spicy as I'd like, but I'll remedy that next time by garnishing with a few raw slices, as well. I used a quart of good chicken stock rather than the bouillon/water.  Wasn't sure about the raw onions and cilantro garnish, but they really added to the soup's flavor.

This is an amazing recipe. I don’t see a reason for additional seasoning personally. I over “chickened” but that was about it. My meat and potatoes husband loved this and was surprised how filling it was.

The best soup I've ever made, or eaten (and I'm a soup lover). So quick/easy, and budget friendly. Wasn't sure whether to leave the seeds in the jalapenos or not. I didn't, but probably would not have been too spicy with.

Thanks so much for this Excellent recipe!

As written it seemed there was some missed places to really deepen the flavor.  I used chicken thighs and cut them before hand, pan frying in a bit of olive oil and a mix of spices.  (Chile spice, cuman, garlic, a little salt and pepper.) 

I also used Chicken broth rather than the water and bullion cube.

All said, it was easy to cook, and a wonderful lunch on a cold day, without being heavy at all.

Soup turned out super good. I added lemon grass and I think it helped with the lime flavor

This was excellent!  I followed tips from others that said to use chicken broth or stock and cooked the chicken in the broth- making a one pot dish.  I also added some lime zest at the end.  Husband said this is a keeper!

I made this soup per the recipe.  The taste was well balanced.  It definitely is not very spicy if you only use what the recipe calls fall.  Family loved it and it will become a staple.

Thus is a great soup, so refreshing and not too spicy. I’ll like to try it with chipotle instead of jalapelos just to compare degrees of heat and the smoky taste from the chipotle chilies.

This soup is great! I made it just like the recipe instructed.  However I would make the following change.  Don't add the jalapenos and lime juice until they very end when you put the chicken back in.  The Jalapenos will maintain the crispness and the lime will maintain it's tartness.

Very Very good
I used homemade chicken broth because I was making up a batch of shredded chicken for the week and usually reserve the broth for soup.
 I added celery because I can't have chicken soup without it.
Otherwise I made the recipe as written
My hubby said the jalapeno smacked him in the face, but both he and my son liked it.
If you want a flavor punch with low carbs this is a recipe for you. I can't see a cold standing up to it either

This soup was even better than I thought it would be. I will definitely make it again! It didn’t make very much though, so next time I will probably double the water and limes. Other than that, it was perfect!

This was so good I made it twice in my Instant Pot, the second as soon as the first was gone! I did the first step on saute, then switched to manual and added the remaining ingredients and frozen chicken breasts. I cooked on high for 18 minutes and it was perfect.

I made this veg friendly and it was great! I wished it was spicier so next time I may leave the seeds in from one of the peppers and see how that helps. I did add red bell pepper, corn for color, and more onion, and simmered for about twenty minutes in vegetable broth. I forgot to add the additional water, but it worked out great! I added the lime juice at the end and topped with sour cream, avo, green onion, queso fresco, chopped cilantro and diced tomato. I did mix in cooked chopped chicken to individual bowls for the carnivores. Men were happy! Thank you!!

Will make this again.  I hate washing multiple dishes so I made this in a single pot.  I make the following modifications.  My wife does not like a lot of raw vegetables so I added all the onion and cilantro up front using butter instead of olive oil. I cooked the chicken in the vegetables/broth so I did not lose any flavor from the chicken.  The remainder of the recipe I followed.  Only 1 pot to wash!

Will definitely make this again. I followed the recipe exactly but used the broth from boiling the chicken and some low sodium broth instead of the bouillon. I seeded the jalapeños but think that I should have left the seeds or I might add a third one next time. Someone asked if this would freeze well. It freezes very well if you don't add the avocado and other toppings until you serve it.

Nuts! I have to remember to take a picture of my dishes BEFORE we start eating. 
Anyway... We all enjoyed this dish very much. I recently found a very similar recipe and used an idea from that recipe in this. 
I took 2 avocados and pureed them with a little (1/2 - 1 cup) chicken stock, then mixed it in at the end. It makes for a creamier soup which we all liked with the first avocado/chicken soup. 
Other than that... Oh wait! I used a bone broth instead of the powdered bouillon. One less thing to mess around with. 
Came out amazing!

So Delicious!   I cooked as your recipe stated except I boiled the chicken with the chicken bouillon and  then added the lime, onion, cilantro, etc., mixture to the pot rather than discarding  the cooked chicken broth.
I served it over a little rice .  Thank you for sharing

Best soup I have ever made! I stuck to the recipe. Good with or without the queso.

I love this soup so much, I just doubled the recipe for company. Unfortunately, plans have been postponed. Does anyone know if this will freeze?

This recipe is super easy and tastes very fresh with the limes and jalapeno carrying the palate.
