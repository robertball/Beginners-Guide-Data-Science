I hate to be the bearer of a bad first review, but for us just about everything was wrong with this "guacamole."  No onion?  No jalapeno?  No cumin?  Mayonnaise?!  Even worse,  a third of a cup of "10% (half and half) cream?"   Since I didn't want avocado soup, I added NONE.  Good call!  This was the most bland, uninspired, boring expenditure of two avocados ever.

I liked this. I added red onion and a seeded chopped jalapeno, but left out the mayo. I knew I'd add/leave out these ingredients just by reading the recipe. But thanks for the idea of using cream. It made it super silky.
