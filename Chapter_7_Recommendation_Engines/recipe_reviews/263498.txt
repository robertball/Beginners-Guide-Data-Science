Five for taste, but three for instructions. Blending the pesto, sun dried tomatoes, chicken and shrimp into the sauce creates an less than favorable presentation. There’s no reason why the sauce can’t be spooned over the pasta and the chicken, shrimp and tomatoes laid strategically on top. The pesto really didn’t lend much of a flavor profile to the dish and it could be left out.

Good recipe (however very fattening).  I made the recipe according to the directions and it was so rich, we could hardly eat it.  I think if you sub lite cream cheese for the full fat cream cheese, fat free 1/2 & 1/2 for the heavy cream, cut the pesto a little, and use 2 cups of cheese you'd be able to sleep after eating this dish.

Not enough flavor. Of course adding salt after it’s done helps but I shouldn’t have to add anything after it’s done if it’s good. I followed directions to a T and was underwhelmed. I would make some minor adjustments that could go a long way with being more flavorful

Very nice recipe ! Very rich with flavor although the pesto didn't add much to the flavor in my opinion , but it was great ! After my family tried it they loved it because it tasted " like it came directly out of an authentic little Italian restaurant ." its filling so , makers beware hehe !! :) 5 stars and will be added to my family favorites

Not sure if it's just me but I wasn't expecting this to be a healthy recipe, it's Chicken and Shrimp Alfredo. Anywho, my family and I LOVED this recipe. I made a few changes:

- No pesto (not a fan)
- Added Sausage
- Added Cajun Seasoning (the kind that's not salty)
- Used Fettuccini Noodles

This was so yummy. Next time I make it I am going to add peas, mushrooms, and fresh spinach. Thank you for the awesome recipe

It has good flavor but it is very rich. Hard to eat much of it. Will add less cream cheese or lite next time.

Yes I will make it again. I didn’t have  the cheeses it called for so I substituted mozerella for them and turned out great!

This was delicious! Unfortunately, I didnt have the pesto so I can only imagine it would be even better with it.  I did throw in some snow pea leaves for color and to add a veggie.  I also doubled the sundried tomatoes just because I love them.  Definitely a keeper!

I made it without shrimp, and less pesto.  It was delicious! I also added a glass of champagne to the meal.  Yum.

I did not like this. Made it without pesto and less parmesan cheese and it was bland and a bit runny.

It was great added mozzarella instead if the Parmesan and added a pesto sun dried combo mix. Added an extra cup of milk. Perfecto

I was not a fan of this recipe.  I'm a cheese lover but thought the cheese overwhelmed the dish.  If I were to make this again, I'd also cook the shrimp separately before adding it in.  Every bite tasted like cheese and shrimp.  The chicken was completely lost.

I made this exactly to the recipe and the results were very very good.  Since I live by myself, I cut the recipe down to 4 person and it worked just fine.  I would recommend this to anyone not on a diet.
