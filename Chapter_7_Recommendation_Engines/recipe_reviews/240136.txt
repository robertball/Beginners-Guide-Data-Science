Delicious and exactly what I was looking for to replicate restaurant style pork belly apps I have tasted. I didn't have smoked paprika on hand so I combined a little bit of chipotle chili powder with regular paprika. Followed the rest of the instructions until the pan frying. The reserved pork fat didn't work out for me - too much liquid in the fat and a LOT of splattering. So I used refined coconut oil instead. Wowza! Amazing! Crispy outside and with that luscious melt-in-your-mouth fat inside. I served it on a simple arugula salad with drizzled olive oil, sea salt and cracked pepper. I just got another pork belly in my farm share and I can't wait to make this again!

I tried this recipe, and it was awesome!! I am a big Pork belly fan while my family is not but the crispy Pork Belly makes the fat more tolerable than if is Braised or cooked differently and personally I love sweet pork especially bacon so I added cinnamon sugar to my seasoning and it turned out Great.

I made this for a gourmet dinner.  Served it as the salad course with wilted romaine lettuce made with the fat from the pork belly and some bacon fat.  It was fabulous

I love this recipe. I did not read it until the day I was making it so I did not let it cool as long as it should have, but it still turned out great! I would have loved a sauce to go with it. 
I will definitely make this again!

This was the first time I cooked pork belly.  I followed the recipe exactly. The crispy parts were tasty but I didn't care for the rest. My husband loved it. Next time I will slice it thin before frying.

We liked it.  Very subtle smokiness from the paprika.  Served it with Chef John's polenta.  Good stuff.

Great recipe, however it has one glaring error: the actual recipe from Chef John calls for a 1 1/2 pound skinless pork belly: NOT just 1/2 pound!

Too freaking good. I did add some fresh ground allspice, cuz I could, and use shallots cuz wuz out of garlic.
My guinea pigs / Test Dummies thought I went and bought it from a 4-star restaurant. did not believe I could make something that good. Maybe I'll get from 5 star next time comment from my crew.

This was really good. It was something different for a dinner meat choice. I purchased a large chunk of pork belly that I make bacon with and I cut a piece from that to make this recipe. I will definitely make this again.

Followed the recipe for pork belly with celery root purée. Delicious!! Melt in your mouth belly!! Celery root purée was amazing, tasted like celery, but bumped up a big notch. Totally recommend. Takes time, but worth it.

First time making pork belly.  The only alteration was roasting fennel seeds in the pan before adding the fat to reheat and crisp the pork belly.  Absolutely delicious- better than the pork belly I had on a recent cruise.  I will definitely make this again.

Wonderfully tender, crispy, and tasty!  I think the olive oil detracts from pork taste, so don't bother.  Instead of a celery root puree, I made cheesy faux mashed potatoes (daikon, butter, cheese, sour cream, heavy cream, olive oil, garlic to taste), complementing the pork belly beautifully.

Oh yes!!!!!  I always get it when I am out. Now, I can treat myself to this absolutely tasty recipe.  Be sure not to over cook the fat side so as not to allow it to get too crispy.

Followed recipe exactly except forgot to remove skin before cooking. No big deal. Removed it after cooling in fridge overnight. Crisped for lunch the next day. Melts in your mouth good! Even Better with salt.

Mine didn’t look as pretty but it sure was delicious! I cooked it a bit longer than the recipe called for and the meat was falling apart and so tender.

I bought several packages of pork belly on sale, but they stayed in my freezer for months because I didn't know how to prepare them.  I fixed one, but it was unmemorable, and I wished I hadn't bought that meat, even at a bargain.  The one that I fixed using this recipe was a hit with my family, and it was so easy I would do it again.  Cheap, easy to prepare, and delicious...a winning combination!

Delicious!  I left the skin on and it crisped up nicely in the frying process.  I also used this basic recipe to prepare pulled pork and it turned out equally well.

Cooked, exactly as directions said.  Found 200 degree oven not hot enough. Did not render the fat to eatable. Would not make again.

I've actually made this twice. I used the smoked paprika the first time which gives it a fabulous aroma and I liked the taste. This time I used five spice powder. That was really good also.  While this recipe takes a long time, it is really easy.  The hard part was finding the pork belly where I live.

Could not get into it the sweetness normally associated with pork bellies .  Any suggestions on how to achieve? I followed the recipe reasonably, except used regular paprika.

Chef John has amazing meals. This was a crowd pleaser.  I will make again. Easy, just takes a lot of oven time.

Spot on to recipe and a piece of cake to do.  Make sure to use a nonstick skillet to brown the pork belly, it's very delicate.  The  celery root puree is absolutely the perfect foil for this.  Highly recommended.

After smoking a pork belly yesterday, I  rendered and finished some for breakfast today. Added a liberal amount of salt and paprika (I will try smoked paprika next time) and starting the frying in coconut oil. It really went great with the egg yolks.
