Great recipe! I marinated the tofu in the pineapple juice, ginger and tamari for about an hour, then drained off the marinade to mix with the other sauce ingredients. I also stir-fried the tofu for a few minutes in a separate skillet before adding it in with everything else, to give it a firmer texture.

My husband and I agreed that it tastes as good as a restaurant's.  I stirfried the tofu a bit before mixing it with the other ingredients.  I did not use veg oil. Instead, I used sesame oil.

This recipe has very well written directions, and the colors are very pretty, but unfortunately I found the finished dish disappointing.  To me the flavor was bland, and there was no hint of sweet or sour to it. The only distinguishible flavor was the sesame oil, which I would leave out if I made it again.  I chose to omit mushrooms, and did add a can (11 oz.) of mandarin oranges.  I used kuzu (kudzu) powder instead of arrowroot, and my sauce did not thicken - probably my fault.  If you don't have arrowroot I would recommend going back to cornstarch.  I also chose to use Jasmine rice instead of brown.  I would also recommend cooking the green beans & carrots briefly in the microwave to cut down on cooking time - mine was way longer than 3-5 minutes.  I probably will not make this again.

My tofu didn't turn out very well. I think I might try making it again with tofu that has been frozen first.

This dish was very easy and flavorful.  I thought the sweet and sour came through beautifully, and is a nice flavor for adults and children.  I doubled the sauce portion, simply because we are sauce people.  The only change I made to the recipe ingredients wise was to use Bragg's Aminos instead of soy sauce.  You really could use any veg you want for the stir fry since the sauce is what really makes the dish.  Lastly, mine thickened up perfectly using the arrowroot.

Very good. I left out the mushrooms, beans, and zucchini for a more Chinese restaurant feel. Leaving these out also yielded more sauce.

I liked this, but my non-vegetarian husband did not. My vegetarian kids thought it was ok, but they refused to eat the pineapple.

The sauce tastes really good.  The pinapple juice and syrup were an interesting twist.  After this meal, I'm not a bit tofu fan because I mistakenly used the "extra firm" tofu.  I pretty much turned this meal into a stir fry using spicy stir fry sauce.  I can't resist when I have soy sauce out and that many vegtables in the pan.  Can wait to use some flank steak, or a big tube steak.

This is definitely a keeper. Made twice. First time sesame was strong. Second time I used seeds instead of oil, much better. Not super sweet or sour. Much milder than I expected, in fact, but definitely comes off as something you'd pay good money for at a nicer Chinese restaurant.

The tofu and vegetables came out very well, but the sauce was a little dull.

I made this recipe mostly as written, even though I knew I would be the only one eating it.  I figured that if it was good, I could freeze the veggies in small portions for an easy meal later.  That did not happen!  I ate this everyday for 3-4 days until it was completely gone!  I will absolutely make this again!  The changes I made were: I only used 1/2 lb of tofu, and I marinated it a while in some of the sauce before cooking it; I used Braggs liquid aminos in place of tamair, cornstarch in place of arrowroot (I just didn't have it), and powdered ginger instead of fresh; I used only the veggies that I had on hand - green peppers, mushrooms, zucchini, and carrots; I cooked the veggies for longer than 3-5 minutes, just to suit my taste.  Now, if only I could get the rest of my family to love veggies as much as I do... !
