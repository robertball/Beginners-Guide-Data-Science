A very nice recipe - sort of Asian fusion, I'd say. It does take a bit of prep, but the sauce is especially good. The recipe was bit unclear as to how long to bake in the oven (for those of us without a meat thermometer). I checked mine at 10 min and it was VERY rare, but at 20 when I took it out it was pretty well done. I'll probably go with 15-18 minutes in the future. I also did add just a pinch of flour to help the sauce thicken up. Served with risotto cooked in toasted sesame oil, and it was very yummy.

I agree with other reviews.  The sauce is a bit salty, I would cut the soy sauce in half.  Overall, it is a tasty duck.

Very good. We followed everything but instead of flipping the duck when in the sauce pan, you should use the rendered duck fat and constantly pour over the top of the duck breast to cook the top.. this is the best way to get a tender breast with the juices trapped in.

I don't think it was too salty. It was quite good, not self-thickening though, which was fine. And the person who said it was tough from being overdone using less time, probably undercooked it. I've found duck needs to be done at least close to medium to be tender. But it depends on the thickness. My close to one inch thick breast took a good 30 minutes. And I assumed the honey went in the sauce, even though the recipe left out where to put it. Was enjoyed with garlic mash and carrots.

I made this for dinner last night, and it was a big hit with my family. None of us had ever had duck before, and instead of using the breast, we had legs. Even with the tough meat of the legs, the end result was still a very delicious, tender meal. I served it with parsley potatoes and a spinach salad. I reccomend serving this with bread, so you can soak up some of the delicious sauce. Also, some other reviewers commented that the sauce was too salty. I guess you could say that it was rather salty, but I did not feel that it was too salty. I think that it would be easy to adjust the ingredients; maybe a little bit less rice wine? Anyway, I highly reccomend this recipe. Thanks for posting!

I alternated the duck with the chicken and it turned out great!  The sauce was smooth and blended well with the chicken.  Not sure where on the recipe to use the honey as it's not in the directions.  Served this with roasted potatoes and veggies along with a spinach salad.

Great recipe! I halved the amount of soya sauce because I made chicken stock using a chicken cube, and found it wasn't enough. I made it 1 1/2 tablespoon instead and it was perfect.

The two pieces of duck breast I used were of different sizes. Since I like my duck well-done with just a hint of pink while my husband likes his medium, I put the duck breasts in the oven for about 17 minutes and both came out the way we wanted it.

I got the sauce together a couple of hours before cooking and sieved the sauce before boiling it in the pan. This way, the ginger had time to soak and  it is ideal for those who find biting into grated ginger a little too overwhelming.

My husband absolutely loved this duck dish and couldn't stop saying how much he loved it :)

The duck itself was quite time consuming to prepare, but the sauce was amazing! I can see this working with chicken or pork, any kind of meat really. I served this with roasted potatoes and parsnips and steamed green beans.

I found the sauce for this very salty and it didn't thicken on its own, I had to add cornstarch. Next time I will try reducing the soy sauce and vinegar to 1tbsp each.

We thought this was good the sauce was a great compliment to the duck.  The only thing I didn't like was the duck was overcooked and a little tough and I cooked it for less time then the recipe called for.

I've been cooking duck breast frequently after finding this recipe.  It's so easy to cook that I would suggest anyone try this one.  I would do 5 minutes on the fat side for a nice golden brown and 12-15 minutes of cooking time once it's in the oven.  I found my digital thermometer at 160 was really well done and I think duck breast should be medium to medium rare.  Also if you're going to use the sauce i would go minimal to no salt on the bird before you start cooking as it will get too salty and you can always add once it's on your plate.

WONDERFUL!  Followed recipe as is - did have to pop our duck breasts back in the oven for about 10 more minutes for a more well done breast - still had some light pink. The sauce was wonderful with the duck, and it really wasn't greasy or anything.  Fabulous job!  Tasty and enjoyed by both my husband and I.

I had never taken the time to review any of the 40 or 50 allrecipes.com prepared to date -- and some have been very good -- but this one pushed me over the edge. I cook duck 2 or 3 times per year and have a couple of recipes that I thought couldn't be beat, but this topped them both. I do suggest cutting the cook time by at least 5 minutes for a tinge of pink in the center of the thickest part pf the breasts. Also, such a fuss has been made about the sauce (thickened with a little corn starch)  that I quadrupled the recipe. Smart move. It is as good as everyone says. I'll use it on the legs and thighs, put some in the duck soup, and have a little left over for experimentation. Thanks for sharing this delicious dish.

This was truly delicious and easy!  We cooked the duck breasts without the skin on and thought that it was wonderful just the same. 2nd time we cooked dish - we determined that may be better pan sear duck on high/both sides shorter time, then put in the oven to roast and also felt that rare to med rare is more our preferred meat temperature.  A little chili powder goes a long way.

The breasts were skinless, so I didn't have as much fat as I would have liked to work with in the sauce.  I like the idea of slicing it thin;  it helps to find missing shot pellets.

I used rice wine vinegar and it didn't seem to make it too sour.  I would maybe try apple juice instead of wine.  

I didn't want to open a new plain tomato sauce, so I used leftover pizza sauce.

Never, ever cook duck until it's well done.  Take it out at 140 and let it rest!  Duck & Goose is like cooking beef!

WOW! My husband and I made this the other night and we didn't  even speak when we were eating just did the "mmmmm" face. He talked about it the next day even. We did look at the other comments and made changes. We did not put in the oven, just cast iron and basted fat side down for 8 mins then turned over for 2 mins. then let rest for 10.  I made the sauce on the side so we could taste it first before pouring over the duck breast.  We are in love with the sauce. Served with roasted baby carrots and a salad. Will definitely be on our rotation. We ordered 4 breasts online for $29.95 since they don't sell them locally here.

I cooked the breasts for 6-8 minutes skin side down then turned over for 1-2 min. Did not put in the oven. Took them off the flame when temp measured 130 for med rare! Perfect. Doubled the sauce and used 1/2 ginger as it was a bit overpowering. Used organic low sodium tamari sauce

This is a fabulous way to make duck breast, but as written there is not enough sauce. I tripled the amount of tomato sauce and added more rice vinegar to get enough sauce. You have to really watch the breasts to ensure you do not overlook them, as the recipe is not clear on time.

Just put my knife and fork down, had to write a comment..what a delicious and easy recipe, absolutely loved it. Thanks for posting. This was my first time cooking duck, turned out perfectly. Sauce was great, had a lot of leftovers, but I think it will go good in a stir fry or whatever. Not too salty, just right. Thanks again!

This is the first time I've cooked duck and I found this recipe to be very simple but yet tasty.

Really good, but we only used one duck breast because it was pretty large, had some sauce left over because we still made a full batch.  Wouldn't change a thing.

I use this recipe to prep duck when I make Duck Fried Rice at Christmastime.  It's a great way to do it because the flavors aren't overpowering, and cooking the duck this way the night before really gets the flavor profile just right!

This is the best recipe for duck breast I have ever tried.. I have made it many times and didn't change a thing.
