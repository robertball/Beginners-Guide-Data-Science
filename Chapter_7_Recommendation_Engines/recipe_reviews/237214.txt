I used straight molasses in place of the brown sugar, but I would simplify this recipe next time going with a balsamic glaze in place of brown sugar and balsamic vinegar. It'll be easier to make a reduction with the glaze and broth together. One of my teenagers loves and craves a good leek recipe now and then in a quiche or over noodles.

While I canâ€™t say this side dish LOOKS appetizing it is quite tasty. The celery took longer to cook than I thought (maybe my matchsticks were too big ??) but it was enjoyed.

I used chicken broth in place of vegetable and cut the brown sugar in half after reading the reviews. Good recipe that goes great with wild game. Thanks for sharing!
