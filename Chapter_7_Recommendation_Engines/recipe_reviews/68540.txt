Father, forgive me, I used chicken broth and added chicken parts, I could hear them clucking in protest the whole time... cluck cluck, cluck!
It was great! A major hit. A mexican man where I held the function came out of the warehouse and meekly approached me and asked me what it was I was cooking. When I told him, he quietly told me that he came out because it smelled like his grand-mama's house when she would make menudo. He seemed really moved by the whole thing. I have to say this is a wonderful soup, I had to keep adding liquid as I went because it can tend to steam off, and it just continued to get better and better. Make a batch and put it in the fridge, you'll have something delicious and hearty to eat all week!

I hate to be the voice of dissent here, but I really didn't enjoy this very much.  I followed the recipe exactly and think I might like it better with some tweaking.  I like spicy foods but all I can taste in this is a lot of heat.  Less chili powder?  Less cumin?  I'm not sure what this needs.  I tried serving it with little dollops of sour cream on top, but this didn't really help. I will probably not make this again.

This stew was AWESOME!  Definitely delicious.  I added okra, zucchini and tiny red lentils, which made it very hearty.  I will probably expirement with different veggies each time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  :)

This tasted great but I sure did not like the hominy. I'd substitute whole kernel sweet corn next time. Maybe also add cubed sweet potato and sliced squash (the squash during the last 10 minutes, as it cooks quickly). These are in a Mexican Beef Stew recipe I have that is similar to this, and they work well.

We make this at work and get requests for the recipe everytime we serve it.  We follow the directions exactly, but I like the idea of adding pinto beans to give it some good protein.

I am a new vegan but have loved Mexican food forever, and this is the perfect vegan replacement for my favorite chicken tortilla soup recipe- so delicious and so flavorful you don't even notice the absent of meat or chicken broth.  Another amazing thing about this recipe is that it is SO EASY and can be tweaked depending on what veggies you have on hand. Hard to mess this one up.  5 stars!

Delicious!!! We changed a few things, but not too much.  We used broth instead of boullion, no celery and (accidently, although...YUM) added double the chili powder.  Very hearty and good for clearing the sinuses! I think the hominy adds the mexican flavor but I am not sure.

This stew was very good.  I added two jalapenos because I like things extra spicy and some kernal corn with the maize.  After simmering I added cornstarch/water mixture to thicken it since it didn't seem very "stewish".  If I make this again I'll add about half the amount of seasoned salt -- as directed this stew is too salty.

I love it! As a new Vegan, previously, my idea of cooking was heating something in the microwave or boiling water for spaghetti. So I'm VERY new to cooking! So I always follow recipes exact and don't "tweak". 

I saw the recipe and it sounded delish. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it rocked! I'll definitely be making this again!

I uploaded a picture. The bf is kind of skeptical of foods that do not involve meat, but he was convinced this was possibly the best he ever had. 

I kept all quantities, just changed the way they were fullfilled:
2.5 cups of chicken broth (had open from earlier in week)
2 cups of water/ 2 chicken bullion cubes
nearly 1 tbls chili powder
nearly 1 tbls cumin
14 oz hominy (was not sure if he liked it- so didnt want to stress the hominy)
14 oz frozen corn (to balance with hominy)
14 oz tomatoes with green chili (bf cannot do too much heat)
28 oz canned diced tomatoes (plain?)

only used 2 pots! boiled potatoes, carrots, celery in sea salted water. drained. same pot boiled broth/bouillon. At same time started the onion et al in enameled cast iron. combined all in that pot and simmered. DIVINE

I took this good recipe and made it superb:  Added a diced jalapeno to the onions and garlic; replaced canned tomatoes with 28 oz fresh, diced tomatoes plus a can of chile peppers; added a can of drained black beans; reduced the bullion to 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon of arrowroot; at end of cooking, added a bunch of chopped cilantro and 4 pureed tomatillos.

Excellent recipe!  I made the following changes, which I think bring out and mellow some of the flavors:

I used a 14-oz can of white hominy and a 14-oz can of chili beans (Bush's or similar);
I omitted the celery;
I added 1 tbsp oregano.

Instead of briefly boiling, then sauteeing the potatoes, etc., I heated the olive oil, sauteed the onion until lightly browned, added the chile powder, cumin (double the amount called for) and oregano, sauteed for 30 seconds, then added the potatoes and sauteed until lightly browned. Then I added four minced cloves of garlic, sauteed 1 minute; added hominy, beans, tomatoes and chiles, and broth.  I followed the recipe from there.

This produced a nice blend of flavors (not too hot or bland).  Topped it with cheese, radishes and shredded cabbage as other readers suggested--it was great!

Very tasty! I just made this for dinner. I used one 15.8oz can of hominy and added one can of rinsed pinto beans for additional protein. I had no seasoned salt, either. So I had to sub for equal parts garlic powder, ancho chili powder, oregano and salt. Soooooo good. Thank you!

Yummy. I sometimes change the amount and types of veggies, and it still comes out great. I also add tortilla chips as a garnish.

This was quite tasty, but more like a soup than a stew. I liked the addition of hominy, which is not something I have eaten before. I used Rotel tomatoes with chili, and it was spicier than most food that we eat, but still enjoyable. It makes a lot--I froze half & hope to enjoy it later.

I love the spice in this dish but I think I would probably call it a soup rather than stew.  Maybe I just added too much broth?  I added light red kidney beans instead of hominy (never used it) but next time I will add corn too.  I served it with crusty bread but it would've been better served with cornbread.  Overall, delicious and flexible dish - thanks!

I was out of beef bouillon so I used chicken instead. I cut the cumin down to 1/2 Tbsp, added a little garlic powder, and dumped in a can of black beans (drained of course). I love the flavor of this soup and think it would be easy to add just about any vegetable, or even meat, to it and still have delicious soup.

If I were vegan, I'd probably give this another star or two, but alas, I am not, and have eaten much tastier, heartier soups.  Also, I think the cumin/chili powder amounts are a little off--I ended up having to use a lot more to make this have any spice to it.  I think it's a pretty good simple soup overall!

I scaled this recipe up and made it for 60 hungry college students at my church. It was the favorite dinner yet this year! Then I just had to make it for my family, who also greatly enjoyed the flavor! Excellent recipe! Just the right level of spice-- not too hot, still very flavorful!

Pretty good. I will use diced tomatoes instead of rotel next time, too spicy! I exchanged corn for the hominy and that taste great. I also served mine with sour cream and shredded cheddar to mild it a bit.

It was really good but made a few changes, as usual.  Did not use hominy and instead added corn, black beans, chipotle peppers in adobe, and a can of sweet cream.  The sweet heat was delicious. Top with a little shredded cheese and serve with tortilla chips.  YUM!

I doubled the carrots, celery, onions and garlic.  I used 2 cups of frozen corn since I couldn't find hominy and I used 28oz diced tomatoes and 3 chopped japholnes  since I couldn't find the right tomatoes.  I also used my own veggie broth.

Quick, easy and very tasty! I used the one-pot method suggested by another reviewer. The only other things I did differently were 1) omitted the seasoned salt (I didn't have any) and 2) used a can of plain diced tomatoes and a can of green chilies because I did not have the tomatoes with chilies already in them. Everyone loved it and had seconds. This is a keeper!

Tasty! Four star because we left out some ingredients (cumin, used tomato based chicken broth) and added more veggies. Might use less spicy next time, but not if the husband has anything to say about it!

not a vegan, but we liked it.  Even the kids liked it!  It was better the first time we made it, so now I have to figure out what we changed and undo it.  I would definitely make this again.

This was a big hit! I substituted one 15 oz can of pinto beans and one of black beans for the hominy (didn't have it) and thickened it with about 4 Tablespoons of cornstarch mixed in cold water, at the end. It made the broth a nice, stew consistancy. I will add corn next time I make it. Everyone loved it! Some added more chili powder or hot sauce to make it hotter.

Everyone loved this dish.  The only change I made was adding a chopped jalepeno and skipping any salt (bouillon is plenty salty already).  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was very good. I omitted the hominy and added cilantro, as suggested by the original recipe. The stew came out very nice but it wasn't too filing and was kind of thin, so I probably wouldn't call it a stew myself. I like one reviewer's suggestion of adding okra, zucchini and tiny red lentils & will probably try that next time. This recipe isn't really one that you could mess up with additions. :)

Pretty good, but not exactly a stew - more like a minestrone with chili powder. I've made it twice now, and I liked it best when I threw in some red quinoa for protein, texture, and to add to the stewiness (I used it instead of hominy because even though I love grits I never got hominy!). I could imagine mashing a bit of the potato to add some thickness. In all, a fine recipe to play with.

This stew is AMAZING!  My husband made this and said he followed the recipe exactly, except for using "better than boullion"  instead of the cubes.  This is full of flavor, and even a little spicy.  Our 3.5 year old couldn't eat it, but we sure enjoyed it ourselves.  THANKS for an outstanding, easy recipe.

This is a fab. dish! I made this for my friends who are vegan and raw. They chose to "cheat" when they arrived and smelled the wonderful aromas. My husband who protests Vegan/Vegetarian lifestyle, LOVED IT! I highly recommend it!

We loved this. Because I used posole (dried hominy, blue and white), which takes forever to cook, I made the stew in the slow cooker. Instead of canned tomatoes, I used 3 fresh ones and about 10 oz of locally roasted and frozen green chiles, which gave it lots of heat. I also used half red and half green chili powder, reduced the cumin just slightly, and omitted the celery. I served this with whole-wheat tortillas and topped it with sour cream (Tofutti), which added a lot to the flavor and mellowed the heat. Definitely a keeper—and fairly easy to prepare!

The hominy reminds me of menudo that my grandmother would make, which I can no longer eat since a vital ingredient is a cow's stomach lining.

In memory of that delicious menudo, I served this soup with a splash of lemon juice and sprinkled oregano and shredded cabbage on top (I also pinched some oregano in the soup while it was cooking). Freshly diced white onion or radishes would also work well as soup-toppers too. There are so many flavors and textures in this soup, yet there are few ingredients and little work involved. Try it!

I skipped the celery (didn't have any), used corn instead of hominy and broth.  It was very good and tasted great as left over lunch during the week.  It was hearty enough that it wasn't crying out for crackers or bread to accompany it.

I added alot of variations to the recipe. It was a good base recipe to get me thinking though. :) I used a can of veggie broth w/ a packette of Taco Bell Chipotle seasoning and some cornstarch stired in, replacing the cumin. I also added lots of frozen veggies and tweaked it more.

I did 3 potatoes and 1 large sweet potato and that's how I would do it next time , too. I also used a can of plain diced tomatoes and then added a can of green chili peppers. A good soup for me, but I'm not sure I'd serve it at a dinner party because it's still a little plain for some reason.

This was delicious! The only variation I made was that I cooked it all in one pot. Sautéed the onion, carrots and celery in olive oil for about 10 min, threw the garlic in for another 3 minutes and then added the rest of the ingredients. Served it with chopped cilantro, avocado, jalapeño and fried tortilla strips on top and it was amazing! The fam demolished it.

I changed it up a little bit, I diced a fresh tomato and green chiles instead of using canned, also used organic vegetable broth instead of bullion, I added zucchini and garbanzo beans, also added a little more cumin than what the recipe called for, turned out delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

This is one of those reviews where you realize the cook didn’t really follow the recipe at all! 
But this recipe is a great jumping off point when you have a can of hominy sitting in your pantry and you have no idea how to use it.
I didn’t drain my harmony I mixed it along with a can of undrained pinto beans three cubes of chicken bouillon and maybe a cup of water. Then I threw in the seasonings some onion and celery and it was an amazing lunch soup! So easy!

Made this a few times because vegan friends and vegetarian family were coming for dinner. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I did make a change... I used 2 sweet potatoes and 3 red potatoes... Didn't cut the sweet potatoes to small because they get mushy. Delicious. Totally a keeper.

Good but too spicy, will cut back on spices next time. I already cut back on the seasoned salt since that seamed like a lot of salt.  Will try again.

I am always looking for vegan recipes and this one I will definitely make again. I was hoping this would taste like menudo but I didn't think it did. Maybe it does for others. The only thing I would probably change is not is to boil the potatoes for 10 minutes, I'll try 5 min next time, cause my potatoes were really mushy by the time I ate it. Otherwise it was delish!

I've made this twice now, and I love it!  My family loves it!
I used vegetable stock instead of the water/boullion.

Thanks for the recipe.

Yeah, it's pretty good. I added double the amount of chili powder because I like it spicy! I usually don't cook or at all but this was fairly simple.

My family loves this dish and only one of us is completely Vegan. We make it regularly and serve it with the Vegan Cornbread recipe. The only thing I changed was adding more hominy so we can use yellow and white. This dish is already beautiful but the added colors of hominy simply enhance it. I've shared this with many family members who aren't vegan and they now make it too!

Loved it! Made it last night, my husband can't stop eating it either.  The funny part is he doesn't realize it is vegan.  He keeps calling it "spicy potato soup."  Having leftovers tonight, taste great the 2nd night when all the ingredients have the chance to mix and sit all night in the fridge.

We are doing a Daniel Fast so I looked up some Vegan recipes.  This soup was amazing (for something without meat). I added corn and used chick peas instead of hominy (that was by accident.)  I also used veggie broth instead of the cubes. The soup got even better the next day and we ate with wheat tortillas. Will recommend and use again for future fasting.

My husband went nuts over this recipe. Too salty though, next time I won't add any. I used rotel for the crushed tomatoes, added black beans and zuccini squash, and 1 cup of milk (trying to cut the salt). I used a bit of cornstarch. We did not feel like it was a low calorie dinner. I'm trying to lose weight but love flavorful and filling foods. This was a big hit!

This stuff is awesome!  Also good with a little sour cream and/or cheese on top.  We serve with sourdough bread or tortilla chips.  Very hearty dish, and none of the carnivores in my family miss the meat.

The only things I changed were using regular stewed tomatoes instead of the ones with chilies and using regular salt instead of seasoned salt.  Maybe it's just the fact that the hominy creaped me out (I'd never even seen it before and it wasn't at all what I expected), but I made it two days ago and haven't touched it since I tasted a few spoonfuls when it finished cooking.

Waaay to spicy for me and the kids. I think it is the tomatoes with chilies that makes it so hot. Next time I will use one can of tomatoes with chilies and two cans of diced tomatoes without chilies. That should cool it down a bit.
