These were very good!!  I added thin sliced grilled pork meat because that's my favorite combination, but of course you can just put shrimp by itself. the dipping sauce is not quite the same as the one in my favorite Vietnamese restaurant, but it is good. My advice is to adjust the herbs to your preference, don't use something you don't like because their flavor will come up quite clear in your palate (not subtle like when they are cooked into something).

Awesome!!!  My husband and are no cooks but these turned out to taste like restaurant quality!!  We used boiled shrimp from the store and added bean sprouts as well.  We also used regular basil (I could not find Thai basil at the store).  The video was very helpful as well.

I served this to friends and we all loved it.  So much that the last one got eaten at 8am for breakfast as we were going away and couldnt stand the thought of wasting it!  I subbed oyster sauce for fish sauce, and scallops for shrimp, that's what I had on hand.  YUM.  Also made it  again with matchstick carrots and diced red pepper instead of the shrimp, very good.  Very versatile recipe.

I used a peanut sauce instead of the dipping sauce with this recipe, but overall, I didn't think the spring rolls had much flavor.  From an eye appeal perspective, I thought they needed a little bit of color.  If I make these again, I'll add some grated carrot, maybe some very thinly-sliced red bell pepper, and most likely, more mint.  But these are all personal taste preferences.

Very refreshing and the dipping sauce is tasty! Although I might cut down the amount of fish sauce next time, a tad too salty for me

I added julienned cucumber and some avocado. Poured the 1st dipping sauce right into them, and served with a peanut sauce. They were great!

The dipping sauce was not very good, in the opinion of my family. There was too much vinegar, which over-powered the other flavors. I had to add lots more sugar.

I noticed this has been commented on before, but I found the dipping sauce was a bit weak until I tripled the amount of sugar.  That did the trick and it was delicious!

I just made the dipping sauce so I can't rate the spring rolls! 
It was pretty good, I added a little extra sugar, a splash of sesame oil, some ginger paste and a little dab of curry paste.

Will definitely make again, I also shredded a few pieces of daikon in the sauce. Lime is the key with a good quality fish sauce.

I made these less the mint and cilantro. Both my wife and I don't like cilantro, and don't ever remember having these with mint. I did add bean sprouts and chopped green onions tho. I did make the peanut/hoisen dip and we also used seafood sauce, the kind you dip chilled shrimp in. We've used that dip for years eating these, and find it's a perfect fit. Anyway these are a light, refreshing meal or appy for an Asian style dinner. We also made Ebi sunomomo, and had before the wraps. Yummy!??

This was my first batch. It took me a few rolls to get the hang of it, but next time, they'll be firmer. I used tofu instead of shrimp and those turned out good.

Spring rolls were very good! Dont stuff them too full or they may split as i learned. I made peanut sauce and I will make them again!
Prep and divide your ingredients as suggested!
