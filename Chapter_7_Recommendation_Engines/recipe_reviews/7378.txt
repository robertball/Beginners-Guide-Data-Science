BOTH the extracts were left out in this recipe.. I simply stirred them into the egg and sugar mixture. Then I sifted and folded in the flour mixture rather than using the electric mixer, and continued. Note that the baking time may be too long for some; mine turned out very dry at 45mins. 35mins - 40mins would have been fine... Plus, it dried out too much, and it seemed rather bland, though my white chocolate cream filling saved it. I'll try again- with reduced baking time.

This cake was very easy to make.  It doesn't taste special, but I think as a sponge cake, it does its job well.  It will make a nice "base" for fillings, frostings, or icings.  A very neutral recipe.  It holds its shape well and looks nice.  I served it with a nice lemon frosting and everyone loved it.

It was okay. I just made it a few hours ago, and even made frosting because I was so excited for this cake. The image made be believe that cake would be sweet, moist, and delicious. Mine was dry and flat. Just to note...it is probably not so much the recipe, but my modifications, and my baking level of expertise (low), which included: 1.5 tsp. of vanilla and a flat baking pan (not sure the size; standard size, I guess). I had a piece with my whipped cream cheese frosting, and was only mildly pleased. Hopefully it will taste better tomorrow, after a night in the fridge. Next time, if there is a next time, I will use more sugar (possible powdered) and less vanilla.

Delicious! But for me 30 minutes in the oven at 175 Celsius grades was enough.
