I followed the recipe except added some chopped carrots. This was good, but I will make some changes next time I make it because it ended up reallly greasy. Next time I will crisp the bacon then set to the side and discard some of the grease. Add pork chops and brown on each side before adding the potatoes, carrots and onion, the potatoes were a little mushy. Very easy, leave it and forget it until it's done!!!! Thanks for sharing.

I loved it! I used real bacon bits and put them in the pan first and let them brown. Then I added potatoes and carrots and let that cook a little. I seasoned the pork chops w/ rosemary and garlic powder and browned them on both sides before adding to the pan. I used a cup of beef broth instead of water and seasoned all of it w/ onion powder, pepper, and parsley (at the end). Yummy!

I was looking for a different way to make ordinary pork chops - and it definitely won my husbands approval.  I added more seasoning to it, as we like our things really seasoned, so added garlic pepper & Natures Seasoning.  The pork chops were cooked perfectly too.

I was a bit skeptical to try this recipe since it was new and didn't have any reviews, but WOW. It is amazing!!! I did substitute onion for one clove of garlic because my husband doesn't like onions. Thank you for sharing this recipe! It has found its way into my recipe box!

This was a good "starter" recipe, but it definately needs something more.  My family and I both agreed that making gravy for it would have been better, and next time we will do without the bacon cooked into the whole dish and actually crisp it and then put it on top instead (we do not like bacon if it's not crispy!).  The only variations that I made while creating this dish were I used turkey bacon and onion powder (due to texture preferences).

Excellent recipe. I decided to eject some of the fat and used packaged bacon bits instead frying and retaining the grease.. I also followed the advice of another review and seared the pork chops first. I used red potatoes and left the skins and packaged onion, celery, pepper & parsley mix. Lots of color and flavor. Much appreciated for a fast and tasty meal.

I gave the recipe 3 stars for the simplicity of the recipe. But that is where the good ends. Unfortunately, I can not say anything else good about it.

Wanted to make this recipe with rice instead of potatoes, so made these changes...

Cooked bacon (cut in half) in iron skillet till almost crisp.
Added pork chops (season with s & p, minced garlic and seasoned salt) and cooked with bacon and onion till brown.
Took out bacon and chops, poured in 1 cup uncooked rice and stir fried in grease 1 minute.
Added 2 cups of hot water and 2 chicken bouillon cubes.
Put chops back in with rice mixture and simmered half hour, covered.  
Serve with slice of bacon on top of chop.  Yum!

I followed the directions closely except I poured off some of the bacon grease, browned the chops before adding potatoes and used 1/2 cup chicken broth instead of water. My husband really liked the dish, but I thought it lacked flavor.

This was very good! I also reduced the amount of bacon grease and seasoned mine with Tony Chacheres Creole seasoning, salt and pepper. This will also make a good recipe to make when camping since it's basically in one pan. My husband loved it and I will be making it again!

I used rather thick pork chops and found them to be very dry.  I loved the flavor, but would check chops after about 20 min next time and go from there.  Otherwise, very tasty and easy!  Thank you

The recipe turned out pretty good. Just found that the pork chops were still a bit pink even when cooked as the recipe said - so they had to be placed in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes. However, everyone seemed to like it. Made gravy out of the drippings, and the bacon flavor in it was superb!

I too am of Irish decent and my grandmother cooked something just like this and it's delicious!  For the people  who complained about the recipe not being clear on when to add ingredients please try reading the entire recipe word for word before starting to cook it.  She clearly states when to add the bacon.  The beauty of this dish is that it's not only easy but so versatile so everyone can add or delete ingredients that suit your families tastes.  This is true Irish, stick to your ribs,  comfort food using what you have on hand so feel free to use what you know your family loves.  I brown my bacon first, set aside to cool then chop in pieces.  Then I brown my chops in the bacon pan drippings for that wonderful added bacon flavor.  For those of you who said your meat was undercooked try browning them without the lid and use a lower temperature.  Not everything needs to cook on the highest setting your stove has.  If your chops are very thick then delay adding your veggies for a few minutes and just cook your browned chops in the water covered a few minutes longer before adding your veggies.  I also go ahead and season my chops as they are browning and added a clove or two of garlic in the drippings  with them as they brown.  For those of you who are afraid of having clogged arteries from eating a little fat all you have to do is once your chops are browned take them out to drain on a paper towel before adding the chops back in the pan.  If you have a lot of bacon grease in y

This is truly "comfort food." It's not meant to ultra spicy or have any zing to it. It's a simple, old-school skillet meal that warms the tummy and makes you smile. I crisped up the back and later topped off the skillet with  it just before serving. Instead of using water, I used chicken broth. Salt and pepper all you need, just as the recipe states. My husband and I LOVED this recipe. Thank you!

Overall this is a good recipe.  My only hesitation was cooking the raw porkchops with my veggies for only 30 minutes.  I ended up pulling the porkchops out and browning them in some garlic infused grapeseed oil, then putting them back in the pan with my veggies.  The flavors were truly delicious, and the pork chops were very tender.  I did substitute a sweet potato for one of my regular potatoes, and I added sliced portabellas.  Will make this one again.

Great recipe! I tweaked it a bit after reading some reviews that called for more flavor. I added beef bouillon to the cup of water. I also used thick-cut bacon and added it back only when serving. 

The biggest change I made was to brush on Jake & Amos Bacon Dressing to the chops before serving. After removing the chops from the potato and onion mixture, I placed them in a frying pan over medium heat and brushed on the Jake & Amos Bacon Dressing, turning once to apply to both sides. This added a nice kick to the flavor!

My only change was to add chicken stock instead of water.  I thought it needed jacking to counter the blandness as others but I knew this would be a keeper for my wife and I was right.  She wants it in the rotation.  And, as previously noted, the recipe is silent on what to do with the bacon, that needs to be fixed.  I wanted to follow it closely as possible.  So I didn't add the bacon back.  So 3 stars.

Great recipe! I used unpeeled red potatoes and green onion instead. I also browned the chops in olive oil with salt, pepper, and paprika first and removed them to cook the bacon. My pork chops were done before the potatoes, so I removed the chops and continued cooking the potatoes. I used the leftover juice as a dipping sauce. Next time I may try using a cup of German beer rather than water. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! Give Grandma a kiss for me!

I, like many others, found it very bland and added garlic, rosemary and chicken broth instead of water. It's a great starting point for a meal, but screams for a lot of help. Also, brown the meat and pour off some of the grease.

I gave it five stars because not only did I enjoy it, my husband really liked it, too -- and he's not easy to please! I used some beef broth along with water -- and I also used five potatoes instead of three, which gave us some leftovers.  Next time I will make six pork chops to go with the extra potatoes.  Very tasty!

added a clove of garlic and a tsp of curry, but otherwise did the recipe as is and it was a stunner! served with glazed carrots. Kind of a German feel without the odious heaviness.

Not a gourmet meal but easy, good and fast. We really enjoyed it. I will definitely make it again. Now that I’ve made it as written, I may add a couple of herbs next time.

Good one. Will do this one again. I did drain about half of the bacon grease off and used beef broth instead of water.  About 10 minutes before the end of cooking I added sliced red and yellow peppers,  diced up bacon, and diced green onions. 

Next time, I think I'll use the meat hammer to tenderize the chops a little bit before searing. Maybe add some mashed up garlic clove, too.

None-the-less....purty good eatin'!

I followed the recipe as written except I only had a russet (baking) potato on hand. Thirty minutes cook time was way too long and my potatoes turned to mush. The pork chops were tasty though. I will try this again with a different type of potato and keep a closer eye on the cooking. And I think I will add in carrots like some of the other reviewers suggested.
