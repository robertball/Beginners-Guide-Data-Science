First off I have to say that the prep and cooking time are right on with this one. Don't pick this recipe if you are in a hurry for dinner. That being said it was worth the wait. I used 1 tablespoon each of fresh herbs as opposed to the dried and think this was a wise choice. I used onion powder in place of onions because my husband won't eat onions and left out the capers because I didn't have any. After reducing the broth it concentrated the sodium so next time I think I would choose a low sodium broth/stock.  A few other reviewers mentioned the sauce not thickening up after simmering. Since the chicken is coated and browned in corn starch, which is a thickener, I thought that may help thicken the sauce in the oven. But I went ahead and took a little extra chicken broth and corn starch and thickened the sauce just a tad before covering the chicken. I'm glad I did. It was the perfect consistency when removing from the oven. The sauce is so yummy I kept taste testing while it was simmering :) The thighs were nice and tender but I may consider using BLSL breasts next time. We think this recipe is restaurant quality and definitely a keeper!

Very tasty.  Dredging the chicken in cornstarch is a great idea.  I've always used flour in the past but the cornstarch gave it a crispy lightness that is very appealing.

Let me start out by saying I did NOT change this recipe!  I did make a lot more because I started out with 36 chicken thighs cut up and therefore adjusted all the other ingredients accordingly!  I was forced to slightly change the cooking method because of my needs so I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't add the cream until much later.  I made everything according to the recipe (excluding the cream)a day ahead of time.  Then today I put the chicken with its sauce in my 6-liter slow cooker on "keep warm" which gets it very hot.  About 10 minutes before we were to eat, I added the cream (and a bit of sour cream - oops!  That is a little change)  For my large crowd this was PERFECT chicken!  There was some leftover and everyone was asking if they could take it home which is always what I hope for - no leftovers at all!  Thanks Faith!  A perfect recipe for me!

This recipe was delicious!  One of my daughter's, who is not a chicken fan, loved it.  The only thing is the sauce didn't get thick at all for me.  So I just poured it over the chicken as it was and let it bubble in the oven.  Will definately make this again.

Wow! The flavors together are delicious!  Only substitutions I made were chicken breasts (thin cut) to thighs and half and half instead of heavy cream. Will definitely make again and again!

I usually reserve a 5-star rating for those times I hear things like "Wow! This is incredible!" Or "definitely make this again!".  Those are exactly what I heard.  This was delicious and while it did take some time to prepare, it was well worth it.  I followed recipe exactly with one minor change - 3/4 tsp of Rosemary because I am always afraid it will be too strong.  That was NOT a problem.  What I like is that while each step is boiling/simmering, I could prepare for the next step.  I started cooking the chicken when I put in the mushrooms.  That timing worked out perfectly so that the sauce was ready at the same time as the chicken; probably because I used bone-in, skin-on thighs (oops).
I too had a problem with sauce thickness.  Maybe I'll toss a little cornstarch in after the first few minutes next time and there will be many next times!  Thank you Faith!

My kids totally loved this dish and are requesting it again. I steamed up some french green beans and placed them over a bed of steamed rice. I used boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs. After taking the chicken out of the oven. I sliced it up and then topped with the sauce. I will definitely repeat this mean and next time try some different mushrooms and a larger quantity than called for in the directions.

Yay!  I had ALL the ingredients for this recipe! Although the prep time was a lot longer than 10 minutes, this dish was superb!!  I ended up using more onions and fresh mushrooms because we really like them, and made sushi rice and fresh brussel sprouts that complimented the dish.  A keeper! :)

This recipe was really good, but. Little bland for me so I added extra rosemary, garlic and pepper to it the second time.  Delicious!!!    The only drawback is it doesn't thicken esily

My family love this!  I did make a few changes though.  I didn't have capers and I omitted the sage as I don't like the taste of sage.  Instead of Heavy cream, I used my Granny's old stand by 1 block of Philly cream cheese and it worked out perfect. I baked the chicken 1/2 way first and then poured the sauce over it and baked it 20 more minutes.  We loved it and I will definitely be making it again, this time with the capers!

I added some Parmesan to this (about 1/3 cup) but it wasn't necessary. Used cremini mushrooms. My lemon was small so I used all the juice... Not a good idea! The capers gave it a slightly odd taste. Been trying to find a recipe that makes me like capers, but it's not working. A good recipe, so I'll try it without capers and a just a teaspoon or two of lemon juice.

Amazing!  I used Baby Bella mushrooms because I sub that in every recipe.  Then I sautéed the mushrooms and onions first to add depth of flavor.  For the most part I followed the rest of the sauce recipe as written.  Instead of chicken thighs I pan fried butterflied chicken breasts, drained the grease and then dumped the sauce over the chicken to simmer together for the last 5-10 minutes.  Paired it with roasted cabbage quarters and rosemary potatoes to garner the reviews of “gourmet” and “10 out of 10” from the family.   As a bonus, it was one the most enjoyable meals to cook as well!

This was great although I think next time I will use chicken breasts as the sauce was more than needed for four chicken thighs.  I also had difficulty getting the sauce to thicken but the flavour was excellent.

This dish was very nice! I loved the way the chicken crisped up with the cornstarch....a new method definitely. The ingredients all complimented one another very nicely. I would suggest cutting back a tad on the lemon juice. I made this recipe exactly as it was suggested and IMHO, the lemon amount was too much (capers add tartness on top of the lemon). I served the chicken with mushroom risotto and roasted asparagus and carrots. I will make again, only I will try over pasta (as the sauce doesn't thicken too much). I would suggest cutting the lemon by 1/4 and sticking to the other measurements exactly. Otherwise, I would recommend adding mascarpone.  Thank you for sharing this lovely dish with us!

Served this tonight and everyone agreed~It IS Perfect Chicken!  I didn't have fresh lemon so I used about 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and am glad I didn't add any more.  It was just right.  I also cut the heavy cream back to 1/2 cup and it thickened up quite nicely in the oven.  Thank You for the Wonderful recipe, Faith!

I did enjoy this dish, but the sauce took quite a long time to make and although it was good, after all that time i expected something more stellar. i think all the time spent making the sauce raised my expectations.

Delicious beyond words!  i had all the ingredients , although I had chicken thighs with the bone in, took the skin off though.  Followed the recipe exactly, I used fresh rosemary since I had it and half and half instead of cream.  It was so good we couldn't believe it was just chicken.  Will definitely make again, and will use this sauce for other types of poultry.

Very good!  I baked it covered and longer than required, for an hour. The chicken was very tender.  Served over brown rice.

I made this for mothers day for my mom (i am 16). i followed the recipe to the tee and it turned out amazing.  She really loved it. The cooking and the prep times were spot on. The only thing i will say, and the reason i didn't give it 5 stars, is that although it said it would make 4 servings, it made less than that. It may be worth doubling the recipe. Otherwise it was really good and i will definitely make it again!

I wanted to try something different with my chicken thighs and this recipe was the right choice. I took my time as the recipe said and the sauce came out delicious. I used boneless skinless fillets as I did not have thighs. The dish was amazing. Thanks for sharing.

I made this using pheasant breast and it is an elegant dish.  The corn starch creates a light golden crust; the sauce makes the dish! I LIGHTLY seasoned the pheasant breast (season salt & white pepper)and pounded out to an even thickness. Pan fried until cooked through. Did not put in the oven. I used shallots in place of the onion and thinly sliced oyster mushrooms. Cooking the shallots and garlic first in butter until tender (not browning) and then preceded with the sauce directions. Make sure to use the Non-Pareil Capers in a vinegar brine for a delicate flavor, drained well. Using my homemade broth, the sauce was not salty. I would recommend using a low sodium broth.

I used chicken breasts  instead of thighs and tempura batter in place of cornstarch because that's what I had on hand.  I also omitted the capers because I hate them and tripled the mushrooms (I used crimini). Turnout was awesome... I literally licked my plate clean because I loved the sauce. 
If you're not getting a thick enough sauce, you're not letting it reduce enough.  I even walked away a little to long after adding the mushrooms, so I needed to add more chicken stock.  It's worth the wait.  I'll make it again for sure.

Tasty and outside my norm!
I normally don't make baked meat dishes with this many ingredients,  but this came out pretty well. I omitted the wine  (didn't have any :)) and used a schooch too much lemon juice. Was also my first time working with capers; they add significant texture to dishes. I'll need to adjust the ingredients next time,  but another surprise delight this was!

Made it exactly as recipe except I sauteed onions and garlic in a little olive oil for a few minutes, before adding the chicken broth.  I wasn't too sure about the cornstarch on the chicken but am now a believer.  Perfectly crispy with a wonderful golden brown color.  The sauce was perfection.  served over basmati rice with fresh steamed broccoli crowns.  Make sure to drizzle a little sauce on the broccoli.  It was perfect.  Another point in favor; there is no added salt , didn't miss it at all.  Capers, lemon and cream!  What's not to love?  
Thanks for a great recipe.

SO good.. although I made it with half-and-half and I'm not sure if that's why it curdled when I added the lemon juice or not, but it made the sauce look a bit grainy.  The flavor was still excellent though, so I'm giving it five stars. Will make again, and probably add the lemon juice and capers before the cream next time.

I love this recipe!  I add in some extra cornstarch dissolved in water along with the cream.  I had a hard time finding boneless thighs, so I used breast tenderloins, which worked wonderfully.  I think I'll be making this again and again!

This is a wonderful recipe!! The sauce was fabulous. I will make it again separately. I had homemade chicken stock that probably enhanced the flavors. I used extra onions and garlic and also added kalamata olives.

This is a little time intensive but WAAAAY better than just throwing a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and it worked equally well.  Excellent combination of ingredients and just plain white mushrooms work perfectly.

Loved it! I tried it because I never made sauce using this method....no browning of onions mushrooms garlic. I didn’t have much faith but it was really good. Didn’t change a thing except added more mushrooms. It was in the oven when I realized I added no salt or pepper. Checked the recipe and realized it didn’t call for any.m and you didn’t need any additional salt (I used low sodium broth) and it didn’t need any more. I put black pepper on my portion. YUMMY!!!

Really good!  Very simple to make.  Used way more mushrooms - a 1/2 pound package.  And, used boneless breasts instead of thighs.  Similar to Chicken Piccata  but the addition of cream and white wine really gives it a nice touch.  Will definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe, well worth the invested time to make it.  I am thinking I may double the recipe next time (except the chicken) so I have more sauce.  That sauce would be awesome over pasta or rice.

Loved this!!  Definitely going into favorites!  I didn’t have any rosemary so I substituted 1/2 oregano and 1/2 basil. Worked great - husband is picky eater and loved this one!  Great idea with the corn starch - lighter than flour coating and so crispy. ??

Very tasty. I should’ve paid attention to the reviews that said the sauce could be a little thin (cause mine was), so next time will add some thickener, but really a delicious dish!  Thanks!!

Since I am an inexperienced cook, I kept to the recipe exactly. I made it two nights in a row...….the first night for my husband who is a sharp critic....(HE LOVED IT!!!). He was a very good sport as he played the role of guinea pig for the next night when  I served it to 5 others and they also loved it. GO FOR IT AND ENJOY!

Oh ya!  This is goooooood.  Definitely company-worthy.  It takes time, but the melding of flavors is worth it.  I followed the recipe fairly closely, but subbed chicken breast tenders.  Worked the rosemary in my mortar and pestle, followed another reviewer’s suggestion of making a slurry of 1Tb cornstarch with 1Tb chicken stock to thicken the sauce before pouring it over the chicken.  I had a bit of extra chicken, so I layered it in the 9x9 pan; next time I’ll use a larger pan so every piece develops that tasty, golden shine.  And there WILL be a next time!

The flavor is absolutely 5-star. I followed the recipe to the letter (timewise, too) and the sauce never did thicken. So, I served it with mashed potatoes it the "gravy" was loved by all. Thank you!

I and my family really enjoyed this. 
It took a lot longer to make than I thought, but I'm still a novice cook, so it was probably me. I think next time I'll use a little less lemon (not the recipe's fault, it was totally me), but otherwise it was a good recipe and, importantly, it was laid out plainly and clearly, with all the steps and measurements, so even a newbie like me could follow it.

I didn't have any fresh mushrooms so I used some that I had dried, I did not change anything else in the recipe. Turned out very good and my wife requested that I make this often.

Awesome recipe! Left out onions and used flour for the dredge. Delicious and leftovers are great too.

See previous 4-star review, forgot to ask for advice on how others might improve the sauce, what type of thickener to add and how much.  Thanks

The flavor was yummy, however the sauce could've been thicker.  It was soupy and I let it simmer for a long time--never really thickened.. Next time I'll just throw in a little wondra!

My family LOVED it!  I uses the same pan I fried the chicken in (cast iron) to bake the chicken, less clean up :-). Will definitely make again, huge hit at my house!

Excellent recipe. Followed directions exactly. My 1/2 lemon yielded 2 Tbsp of juice. Result tasted too "lemony." Will reduce to 1 Tbsp in the future.

Very tasty, rich in flavor, savory.  One downside is It did take a decent amount of time to complete, so have the time to commit and patience for it to come together.  As good, if not better,  than a restaurant meal.    Served with brown rice.

It tasted okay, though the sauce didn't thicken.  I just couldn't figure out what this recipe wanted to be.  We start with onions, garlic and wine, we go on to rich herbs, then we add a whack of cream, and then we go to lemon and capers.  That's the basis for four different sauces. 
Any one of these combos would have been fine, but all of them together was just confusing taste-wise.  I tried it two nights running, just in case I missed something the first time.  Nope.  Won't be going here again.

I made this exactly as instructed.  While it was very good, it was not worth the effort.  I’ve made plenty of things just as good in less time.  

The 10 min prep time is nowhere close to the amount of time needed.  Expect to be standing over the stove for the better part of an hour.

Absolutely Delicious! I only made changes because I was out of certain ingredients. No onion so I use two tablespoons dried onion flakes. For capers I used heaping teaspoon of thyme, and topped with fresh parsley. I used a little less 8000 in a iron skillet so I could cook it in the oven in the same pan. I did not think the sauce was hard at all to make especially because you can make it ahead of time. Most of it is just simmering/reducing the sauce. Very Hardy perfect for guests and super delicious!

Delicious...Tastes like Piccata but with cream.
This recipe does have several steps, but they create the layers of flavor! Sauce is delicious!  Pork loin chops were on the menu so I replaced the chicken.  I did not have chicken stock, so I used veggie stock and some beef stock.  Followed the recipe to a tee, but added marinated artichoke hearts which brought it home with flavor!

Made exactly  as recipe instructed, with the exception of the sage. I didn't have any...sooo....i made without. For me, the sauce took a lot longer to reduce than the recipe stated, but I allowed plenty of time to make it. So not a big deal.

Because of the long prep time for the sauce, I  doubled the recipe, hoping it would be good - so we could get 2 meals out of it.

I loved it, and my husband, who always gives me an "alright" when I ask about a recipe...said it was really good, a keeper .  Very happy about that, because I wouldn't take the time to do it again if we both didn't love it.

I made this for my husband, because it's not a dish for me. So in the words of Mitch, who went back for seconds, "Mm, Mm, Mm, OMG, this is so good, Mm, Mm, Mm..." those were about the only words he was able to get out.

My husband loved the sauce - but for me too many dishes to wash and labor intensive so not worth the effort.  I think there was too much lemon, made it a bit sour. There are better recipes out there - probably won’t make again.

Made this tonight 2/5/20.  Didn’t change a thing and it was DELICIOUS!  My boyfriend couldn’t get enough.  Restaurant quality indeed!  I read a few reviews where the sauce didn’t thicken - mine thickened perfectly.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and ladies ... while it takes time, my guy made time for me tonight!  Winner, winner chicken dinner indeed!!  ??

Delicious! I happened to have a really huge 
 boneless skinless chicken breast, so sliced it into four long strips. Plenty for two people.  Turns out, I have a recipe for pan-seared rainbow trout that has the same sauce, except it also uses fresh tomatoes,  and it always gets raves when served to guests. Pretty sure this one will be a hit with guests who don't love fish. Thanks!

Labor intensive?  One easy dish to put together, IMO.  A suggestion:  use large oven proof frying pan to brown chicken.  Drain off fat, add the sauce to pan,then bake.

This chicken WAS perfect! I didn't have cream, so I used whole milk with a little sour cream, and the sauce was thin, so I added some water and cornstarch at the end to thicken it. It was delicious. I will definitely make it again. Husband said he loved the sauce.

I used this as a base to make this dish.. and changed it. I used chicken stock, half white wine, half sherry wine, and poultry seasoning instead of solely sage or solely rosemary. I also added fresh rosemary to the poultry seasoning. From there, i added a little corn starch to thicken the sauce. Everything else was true to recipe for the sauce.

I made this tonight and it was delicious!  I am on a low carb diet so I omitted the corn starch to keep the carbs as low as possible. I do not think this would have made a different in taste, only thickness of sauce. Definitely will make again!

To simplify this (and because it’s what I had) I used Trader Joe’s cream of mushroom soup, onion powder, fresh garlic, chicken Bouillon, wine, cream, capers, and lemon juice. I didn’t add extra water so it didn’t require a long reduction time. Extra mushrooms would have been nice. It was fast easy and delicious served over rotisserie chicken cut into strips and egg noodles!

This recipe is delicious but it is true that the sauce does not cook down. I tried the usual tricks but none worked. It is best to enjoy this as is. Serve over pasta.

I used half and half rather than heavy cream and thickened the sauce with corn starch. The sauce was still thick and had less fat.

This was so delicious.  I made exactly as written, with one change - used chicken breasts instead of thighs, just a personal preference.  This is a weekend dinner for sure.  You need the time to properly reduce the sauce - no shortcuts.  If you have the time, it’s worth the wait.  Absolutely fantastic.

I would rate it a 7 if I could. The only change I made was I left out the mushrooms because I am allergic, other than that  I stuck to the recipe, thanks!

I don’t usually write reviews but for this I must. It is amazing. I change NOTHING and serve it over quinoa with a veggie side. I have made it with thighs, breast, and tenders. Each time my guests wanted more! When I tell my husband this is on the menu, he skips happy hour with the boys. It will always be on our regular menu! It is worth the cooking time!

This was so yummy! I have to make a double batch so we can have leftovers. Only one adjustment, I omitted the sage because I didn’t have any on hand.

So creamy and delicious!  I didn’t have rosemary or sage left in my pantry so I substituted poultry seasoning (which has sage & rosemary in it). I had no issues with the sauce not thickening, just keep simmering. I served it with couscous and steamed green beans. My family of 5 ate all of it!

The "perfect" did not disappoint! It was delicious. I added cut up asparagus to it for some more veggies. I also like chicken breast better and it works just as well, just reduce the cooking time a bit.

This was a great recipe. My entire family loved it. I made some changes to suit my family's tastes. I replaced the sage with thyme and I increased the sauce ingredients for excess to serve over potatoes or pasta. I also used skin on thighs and just extended the cooking time as they take longer. This recipe pairs well with asparagus, potatoes or pasta.

I used unsalted chicken broth and I believe it would’ve had more flavour had I used regular broth.  I found the recipe rather bland overall.   The sauce didn’t thicken enough for my liking.  I didn’t like how the chicken fried up using the cornstarch either.

This is so delicious my husband thought he was eating at a restraunt.  The chicken was moist , the sauce was creamy with just the right amount of lemon.

I made this for a family dinner and they devoured it. I doubled the mushrooms and thickened the sauce a little more like another reviewer suggested.  I used garlic powder because I had a moment of extreme laziness. Other than that, I followed the recipe. We served it over rice and had peas and a Caesar salad with it. Delicious! Definitely adding this to my favorites!
