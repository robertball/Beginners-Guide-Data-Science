This is a tasty and simple salad. I left out the olives as we don t care for them. I also used slivered almonds as I had them on hand and pine nuts are so incredibly expensive. The dressing is a little on the tart side but has a nice fresh taste. I enjoyed the addition of the feta cheese as well. This was a great use of my fresh garden spinach.
