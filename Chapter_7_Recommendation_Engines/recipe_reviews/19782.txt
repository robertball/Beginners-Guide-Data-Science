I made half this recipe for about 40 people.  Got lots of compliments on it.  However, it wasn't spicy enough for my taste, so I added Cayenne pepper.  I'll definitely make it again!

I scaled this recipe back considerably to make enough for 6-8 people and it was great.  It freezes very well too-

It was a good basis for a simple chili if you don't have a mix packet; however, it needs more uumph.  We added salt, more chili powder and more onion.  After that, it was pretty good.

This is now going to be my permanent favorite(and only)chili recipe.It turned out exactly the way I hoped it would.Most of my family cleaned their bowls and asked for more.The little kids weren't to keen on it,but they ate it.Next time I'll reduce the chili powder as they found it a bit spicy.The rest of my family agreed it was just perfect,though.I made a few changes;I added some frozen corn and used navy beans instead of pinto beans,as my family isn't crazy on the big ones.All in all,a great recipe!

I added about some water to the mixture as the last ingredient, since many had complained about it being too thick, then let the chili simmer without a lid for until it was the perfect balance of soupy and thick.  I thought it was perfect!  Thank you!

My husband and I both agreed that this was one of the worst chili recipes we've ever tried.  I followed the recipe as directed but WAY too thick and bitter. I even tried to "doctor" it up, but it still was terribly bitter.  Sorry!

I really liked this recipe.  It was simple and VERY easy to make.  If you're short on time, you can also substitute the dry pinto beans for already prepared canned beans, but I would wash and drain them first.  I'd definitely make it again.

I made 1/2 the batch. A little bland but with potential. No one in my family of 8 liked it so I had a lot to play with. I doctored it up bowl by bowl until I found the right blend. On the second 1/2 batch I added 6 small cans of sliced mushrooms about 1 cup yellow mustard (be careful with the mustard, just enough to lighten the color a little) and about 1/2 cup worcestershire sauce. I also used 5 onions diced small and canned kidney beans instead of cooking raw beans. Everyone LOVES it this time around! I can't even freeze any because they eat it up so fast! Next time I will make the full batch! This is very quick, CHEAP and easy when using canned beans!

Very good,except I used beef broth
instead of straight water,plus I like
the use shredded beef (brisket) instead
of ground. I had to cook the beans alone
as my wife doesn't like pintos (but they
are my favorite of all beans).

I used bison meat and with this basic recipe, it cooked up terrificly!
I used the calculator to make 4 servings (it is just two of us) and it came out perfectly.
My husband loved it, and I liked it because I cannot deal with anything spicy.
I did not alter any other ingredients in the recipe, and cooked the beans so that they weren't too smooshie or too hard.
I served this chili with a fluffy baked potato and hubby took it to work the next day with the chili on top of the leftover potato.
I froze the leftovers and hope that it tastes just as good when it thaws.

Somwehere between 4 and 5. This came out great despite my little cheats here and there. Nothing too different. I just used already prepared ingredients in some cases. For example, canned organic pinto beans and already minced garlic in oil. I also like to use olive oil when browning onions. I added roasted red peppers and used crushed organic tomatoes where anything to do with tomatoes was called for. No tomato paste. Turned out awesome. Thanks for posting.

sounds so much like what I came up with myself. I don't much care for my own which is why I'm trying to find a different one. My tip, don't forget the cumin. It really makes a difference.

Recipe was good I added 1 1/2 cup of water before simmering for an hour so would not be thick. Was a little bitter I also added an extra 1/2 cup of diced tomatoes and 1 tbs of garlic powder.

Very good.  It turned a little thicker than I like.  I might use less tomato paste and more tomatoes.

This is a wonderful chilli...super easy and easy on the stomach also. The whole family loved it...my kids have never had chilli before and getting them to take that first bite was a bit hard but after that they finished off their bowls and asked for more!

I fixed this recipe for my church and everyone loved it.  It is not too spicy nor is it too mild. It was also very easy.  My pots would only hold 1/3 of the recipe so I changed it to 33 servings.  That way I knew just how much to put in each pot.

I reduced the recipe down to a 10 serving, and I used New Mexico chili powder, because of its flavor, and added a 1/2 teaspoon of Cayenne  chili powder for some extra heat.

This is my go to chili recipe. I have been making it since 2004, and I always get compliments. I use canned beans instead of dried beans. We love to eat it over rice and add some sour cream and cheese. YUM!
