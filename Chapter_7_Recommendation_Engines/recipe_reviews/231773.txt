This meatloaf was quick to put together. I had all of the ingredients in the pantry.  It turned out moist but I think it's bland.  I think it needs more seasoning.  I will try making it again with more fresh vegetables in it and some parsley and maybe some onion soup mix.

I never thought of adding mustard to a meatloaf recipe but I love mustard so I did. I didn't have milk on hand so added a third cup of yogurt which worked great. I am an "oatmeal with everything" baker so perfect! Very easy very good and will make again.

Dawn's Meatloaf Haiku: "Mustard oats were fun different additions to try. Still a little bland." We enjoyed that that using mustard and rolled oats made for a more unique meatloaf taste but it was overly moist and underly (is that a word?) flavorful. Making again would require a heavy addition of spices and I would consider pulsing the rolled oats in food processor (or using quick-cooking oats instead) as I think the larger chunks coupled w/ the 1/2 c. of milk are what made this a very fall-aparty meatloaf.

I like the oatmeal as a change from breadcrumbs. Also added chopped red pepper.

I made it and it turned out great. It had a twist on it that made the difference in the flavor. Every morsel was eaten and I was the one that got the last piece.

This was just okay in my book. I made it as written adding the optional chopped onion (yellow) and omitting the optional salt. The rolled oats and mustard make it different from most meatloaves but it's not bad. Just nothing special I think.

Pretty bland and a bit on the dry side. Salsa and ketchup helped immensely! Probably won't bother with again. Too many other recipes to try!

Very easy to make but a little bland. I would add some spices or tangy BBQ.

Very tasty. I did use 2# hamburger and I food processed the oats so they were very fine. There was no grease to drain.
