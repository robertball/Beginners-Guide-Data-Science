Thank you for this recipe it was so good. I used instant rice uncooked and it worked out great. I mixed 1/2 tea. Allspice with meat because I like that flavor with green peppers.I salt and peppered my tomatoesand sprinkled them with basil. I did everything else the same as written.so good.

Very Good!!I liked the tomato soup (we don't like chunks of tomato). It didn't say to precook rice and I didn't.I put cheese on half and left the other plain.I thought it had a little bit to much rice. But will definatly make again (just with less rice).

These were really good! I added some seasoning salt since I like a lot of spices in my food and they turned out fantastic! I left the tomato off the top though since I didn't have one and added a can of petite diced tomatoes into the rice mixture instead. I also left off the cheese. The recipe doesn't say if you need to precook the rice or not so I did. I'll make these again! Thanks for sharing!

This was not my favorite stuffed pepper recipe. I used 1 cup of cooked rice and it just seemed too dry. I will go back to my old standby.

I'll try these tonite. I make a similar recipe. But I fry the hamburger & onion & garlic powder in a skillet drain then add jarred spaghetti sauce & white minute rice simmer it about 5 minutes. Meanwhile I would have boiled the peppers then fill them top with bacon (I use Oscar Mayer pre-cooked-takes 15 sec. in micro.) then top with a slice of american cheese. You can put some plain spaghetti sauce in bottom of glass baking dish then the peppers. Cook them 350 for about 10-15 min.

Recipe is great; food was awesome and easy to make.  I will definitely make again but ... rice MUST be cooked when added.  I did not cook and the rice was crunchy in the meat!  Bummer.            + Another Lancaster County Girl ??
