This was a rather ordinary tasting barbecue chicken. Nothing extraordinary. After marinating for 3 hours I was expecting a real Indian flavor. The flavors did not really come out at all. That's what I get for going for an easier recipe than other Indian type recipes with more ingredients found on this site. Will not make this again.

Not bad, but I found it bland, even after marinating for 3 hours.

Ok I agree as is it didn't have much flavor so I tweaKed it a bit. :) I made it for 2 servings. I put all the ingredients but used chicken thighs instead. I sprinkled in some curry powder, a dash of salt and probably about a tablespoon of tomato paste. I cooked it in the oven on about 450* for about 25 minutes. It was amazing!!! :D

I don't know if yogurt makes for a good marinade. I had plenty of garlic and used garam masala but my chicken burned on the grill and although it was juicy didn't have enough flavor.
