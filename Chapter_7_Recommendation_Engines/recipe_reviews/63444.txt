This was sooooooooo good!  I changed a few things.  I used light cream cheese and whipped topping to reduce fat and calories.  I also used only one tablespoon of sugar in the graham cracker crust and slightly reduced the amount of sugar in the filling, while adding more lemon juice (a full teaspoon).  This recipe was creamy yet light, and full of cheesy blueberry goodness!  The whole pan was gone by morning, and only four people shared it.
**ETA**  I made this several more times for my diabetic aunt and mother.  I subsituted 3/4 cup of splenda for the sugar, and it was JUST AS GOOD!  We also tried it with blackberries and sliced strawberries, and it was still absolutely delicious!

Picked ton a blueberries and thought I'd try out this recipe.  My only problem with is so far it that I think it's too sweet. (and I have a real sweet tooth!) Reducing the one cup of sugar by a bit probably would make it a little tastier, and adding a bit more lemon juice.  The lemon favour is not even there at all.

Yummy, cool and refreshing. I will make this again. I made the following changes...I used lowfat coolwhip and cream cheese, only 4TBSP butter in the crust, and only a scant 3/4 cup sugar in the filling. Used the juice of 1 lemon,note when you use lowfat ingreds. it will not firm enough to cut into squares, also an unbaked graham crust never holds its shape, so either bake at 350 for about 8mins or plan on having crumbs.

This is an easy and delicious recipe that we've made several times and everyone loves it!  We have made a few changes that make it even better.  Most importantly, USE FRESH BLUEBERRIES or other fresh fruit!  I like to make it in a 9 x 9 pan so the whole thing isn't quite so thick. For the crust, we like a bit more so we use 2 cups of graham crackers but keep the other ingredients the same.  You can buy pre-crumbled graham crackers and it makes it so much easier!  For the filling, we only use 3/4 cup sugar but we use a half teaspoon more of both vanilla and lemon juice.  Believe me it makes a difference.  Last thing, I've also made it with "lite" cream cheese and cool whip, and it's a little less rich but just as good, you can go either way.  This dessert is so good and we're happy to have found it!

Awesome recipe, Always a huge hit

Some Helpful hints....

Bake your crust for about 10 mins at 350 helps hold it together.  this is not needed but does help.

Freeze your squares, then take them out of the freezer about and hour before serving cut into squares when just soft enough to get a knife through.  Huge help!

This was so good, with a few changes--doubled the cream cheese and whipped topping so it would fit in a 9x13 pan (left the sugar the same--it was way too sweet without).  Increased lemon juice to 1 T, and I used fresh blueberries since they're in season.  Got rave reviews from everyone!

I hadn't read the reviews before I made it today - there is nothing wrong with the flavor but I really thought I did something wrong because the fruit filling did not firm up at all.  It's kind of like eating a cheesecake mousse.  The photo presently being used with this recipe actually looks pretty much like mine did.  Doesn't really work well cutting into bars, I truly think it would work better being served in little pudding dishes.  Also, as I read on one of the reviews, adding the vanilla was left out of the instructions so you could very well miss it.  It did taste good, but I wished it would have had a more firm texture.

I made this over and over last summer. It always disappears! I use a few blueberries and marachino cherries to decorate the top...instant party pleaser.

FYI...IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER COOK...the recipe calls for 2tsps of vanilla extract but doesn't tell you when to add it...so just throw it in and give it a good mix before you add the blueberries.

Have made this at least a dozen times to rave reviews.  Made it with Splenda for the diabetics in the family and no one can really tell the difference, also with lowfat cream cheese and cool-whip.  Fresh blueberries are also great, as are raspberries. Have not tried strawberries, but I'd bet they are great, too.

We served this for the 4th of July and our guests loved it; The fam can't stay away from it either! To fix the soggy crust I cooked the crust in the microwave for a 1 or 2 min. then froze while I preped the filling. (can't call it no-bake if you use the oven to bake the crust, now can you?) 

Only things I changed about the filling was using pwd. sugar (1/2 c.) and 1/4 reg. sugar. It was plenty sweet enough. Also added almond flavoring...personal obsession! :)

No crust necessary. Make the filling and eat it out of a bowl. You can also fill parfait cups and add crushed graham crackers or granola. Very Good!

Totally easy. Totally yummy.  So easy to adapt to your diet/taste.  I used 12 ounces of lowfat cream cheese, maybe 1/3 cup sugar, both vanilla and lemon extract, a couple Tblsp lemon juice and fat free cool whip.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

So delish & divine! I can't wait to try it with raspberries or blackberries. Very quick & easy. The graham cracker crust was a bit thick for me so I will be making it thinner in the future. Yummo!

I made these at my sister's tonight and she has a picky 2 yr. old running around. After dinner this was ready and he loved it! Along with my sister and I. But I did not add as much sugar as the recipe called for. I only used 1/2 a cup in instead of the full 1 cup and 1 tablespoon in the crust instead of the 3 tablespoons. I will also use more fruits in the future. I will be making these in the future! Thank you very much!

This is a good quick recipe that can be adapted to a few other fruits and crusts.  I used light cream cheese and light coolwhip and used half blueberries and raspberries. I made a ground almond crust  with grated lemon peel in it which I cooked then cooled before putting in the filling and it was enjoyed by all. Thanks!

This is a fabulous dessert for those hot days you don’t want to run your oven.  For presentation purposes and ease of serving, I made individual cheesecakes in small glasses.  I wish the glasses I used were plainer, so you can see the appealing swirled cheesecake filling.  Should you decide to do this in individual glasses, I recommend that you gently press the graham cracker crumb mixture instead of packing it down, otherwise you may need a jack hammer.

This was AMAZING! Rave reviews from family and friends. Per other review suggestions I only used 3/4 C sugar, tripled lemon juice and doubled vanilla. For crust used 2 cups graham cracker crumbs and used 9 x 13 pan.

Very good, it just needed a bit longer than an hour for the blueberries to thaw in the pie right, overnight works better.  Otherwise you need to sit it out before eating for a bit.

I was not impressed with this recipe at all.  I did read the reviews and reduced the sugar and increased the vanilla flavoring and lemon juice, also used 2 pkgs. of cream cheese.  I'm sure there has to be other recipes that would be tastier than this one.  Will not make this one again.  OK, I lied.  I tried it again and everyone loved it.  I increased the graham crackers to 2 cups, eliminated the sugar in the crust.  Used a 9x13 pan.  Put crust in freezer while making the filling. Used 2 pkgs. cream cheese, 1 1/2 Tbls. lemon juice & vanilla, left blueberries and whipped topping & sugar as stated. Put it in freezer, sliced easily while still frozen and everyone raved.  I guess I will be making this often this summer.

This was *delicious*.  I, too, cut down on the sugar just as a precaution and it was quite yummy.  It never actually firmed up, though, and I even put it in the freezer instead of the fridge for an hour.  I think it was my fault though because I forgot about the lemon juice/salt/vanilla extract until after I'd already put in the blueberries.  I think maybe increasing the lemon juice will help it to firm up some more too.  But it was still a delicious dessert!  Will definitely make again.

Absolutely yummy!! I brought this dish to a woman's group, devoured in 10 minutes and had many requests for the recipe. I did cut down on the sugar and I also had to increase the amount of graham cracker crust for my 8 inch square pan.

First of all..I will never use blueberries again with this recipie. It just didn't taste good at all..but the other part..cool whip with cream cheese and sugar was yummy..gonna try it with a diffrent fruit.
Also wouldn't hold up in squares well..it was so mushy and gushy and didn't stay well together.
No lemon juice on mine..
Only thing to change..add more something to the crust and change the fruit!

Oh my goodness! This is awesome. This doesn't cut real pretty but what the heck I would eat it with a spoon, it's that good. I did follow some of the reviews by baking the graham crust at 350 for 8 minutes, used one tablespoon of sugar in the graham cracker crust, 3/4 cup of sugar in the mixture with 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and 2 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Perfect.

It's better than I expected.  I did bake the crust for about 10 minutes and used 1 1/2 cup fresh strawberries and 1 1/2 cup frozen blueberries.  I liked the frozen blueberry effect of turning the mixture a light purple color, looks and tastes great.  Kids liked it too, wasn't too much of a cream cheese flavor.

If you're wanting your guests to rave over your dish...well then this is the one to serve.  It was received with everyone taking 2nds, 3rds, and 4ths of these refreshing mouth quenchers.  I did only add 3/4's of a cup of sugar to the filling as suggested by another member and I used the 4 tablespoons of butter in the crust along with baking the crust for 8 min. at 350 degrees which made the crust hold together very nicely.  I did only have 2 cups of blueberries and it still turned out very nice..in fact i think it was better with only 2 cups because you were able to enjoy the filling itself a little better and those who even didn't like blueberries enjoyed this treat!!  This will definently go into one of my favorites!

Great recipe! My only complaint was that it was practically impossible to get the graham cracker crust out of the pan without destroying the whole thing. It all tasted the same anyway, so it didn't impair our ability to enjoy this wonderful dessert. I used a glass casserole dish...next time I will try a metal pan and grease it with cooking spray...perhaps the crust will come out easier.

I wanted to test this before I take it to a potluck on Friday, and it is delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, used light cream cheese and whipped topping, and increased the lemon juice to 3/4 tsp. It came out a little thick for an 8 inch pan, but I'll be sure not to add all the filling to the pan when I make it again. But it's quick, easy to make, and delicious!!

Great recipe! I cut back on the sugar slightly, as other reviewers recommended and it turned out beautifully. The cream cheese mixture has a very nice texture. I've made it with fresh blueberries, with frozen raspberries, as well as fresh peaches just poured on top. It has been wonderful every way. I especiallly liked that I didn't have to heat up the kitchen!

Easy to make and tasted great, perfekt for a hot summer day.  The only change I made was that I had a pie crust at home and used that instead of making one with the graham crackers.  My husband loved it and he is not to crazy about blueberries.  Will make again and its just as good in pie pieces.

My entire family loves this light refreshing dessert. I make it every year with my fresh blueberries. I do add a little more lemon & a 1/4 less sugar to the recipe for my personal taste. I have also used Splenda in place of sugar which is just as good. This is a keeper

I found this to be super easy to make and super easy to adjust to your own taste or ingredients.  In my case I used frozen salmonberries from a few seasons before and pumpkin spice cream cheese I had in the back of my cheese drawer.  Worked out great.

I've made some graham cracker crusts before that didn't stick well, but this one held firm really well and perhaps even too well in some spots and my worry about the frozen berries thawing into the dessert to make things soggy actually made the last helpings' crusts the PERFECT consistency for my personal taste.  

Will definitely make again.

This recipe was just what I was looking for. Something easy to make and to use up all the blueberries I just picked. I did make a few changes though. Instead of making the crust myself, I bought two premade graham cracker crusts. I also used two packages of cream cheese instead of just one. Same flavor, it just makes it easier to cut. All in all, it's a very delicious dessert for summer.

My family loves this dessert.  I have made it twice, once with frozen wild blueberries and once with fresh chopped strawberries.  Both ways were very good.  I only use 1/2 cup sugar in the topping and none in the crust and it's still very sweet.

Hmmm... this tasted really good but was not even close to coming out in squares.  It was total mush (yummy mush though).  The only thing I did differently from the recipe is used chocolate graham crackers because I didn't have any regular.  The chocolate flavor combined nicely with the rest.  I'd love to try this again, but I'm not sure how to get it to come out the right consistency.

These are one of my favorites!  Makes a great dessert, but also good for a bfast/brunch.  I added the blueberries still very frozen....next time I will let them thaw a little so it gives off the blue-purple color when stirred in.  Looks very pretty that way.  I also made a little extra graham cracker crust because I like lots of crust.  They are delicious and very easy to make.

Great easy recipe.  I've made it twice and both times people have asked for recipe.  Wife's card club loved it. Works well in a 10" springform pan.
