I am also Brazillian and I make this cake all the time. Yes the icing is supossed to be absorved by the cake. It makes it really moisty but ugly..lol.If you dont want to do that for the icing you can get a bag of unsweeten chocolate chips. Melt it in a pan with butter. careful not to burn and spead it on top. The unsweeten chips will break up the sweetness of the cake a bit so its not so overwhelming and it will stay on top and look pretty.

Okay, I will try to update this when/if I ever try it again ... but my first foray into making this did not go well.  Actually, it tasted great (hence the 4 stars), but it looked like ... well, not good.  When I put the icing on, it just was absorbed by the cake.  If it was supposed to that, then great!  But it looked pretty miserable.  I made it for my daughter's school - I was supposed to bring something South American.  Most was gone before I left, but I figure it didn't look appetizing.  It was really moist and easy to make, though.  Like I said, I will update when/if I try it again.

First of all...I am not from Brazil! I have never had this type of carrot cake and I made it as a lark. Secondly, I admit that I toyed with the recipe a bit. I didn't want a huge amount of cake around the house - so I cut the measurements by half and used an 8x8 pan instead of the 9x13 pan. I also added a couple of shakes of pumpkin pie spice and a dash of vanilla and a sprinkling of corriander. The only hot chocolate mix I had in the house was a blend called "Mayan" which means there was a bit of cinnamon and other spice to it. It turned out GREAT! I loved the gooeyness of the soaked in icing. I will use this recipe again as a base and I think the next time I will throw in some raisins and nuts and make a cream cheese glaze. Even though I think it is more than likely fantastic made just as ordered in the recipe - my experimentation leads me to think you could do all sorts of things to this recipe to change it up - very versatile. The texture is moist and rich and it is just DELICIOUS!

Yummy!  Soft and moist, and a really lovely light orange color.  I only had half the amount of milk, so could only make a half  batch of the icing.  I left out the sugar- I didn't think it needed any more than the cocoa mix already has!  I used Ghiradelli's double chocolate cocoa mix.  I can't wait to make this again with the entire amount of frosting- its SO good with the cake!

Good cake but I was disappointed that just like the other reviwer, the icing was absorbed, it looked weird but it tasted good. I'm also from Brazil and it has been probably over 10 years since I haven't had this cake.

For the icing, start by putting a can of table cream in the freezer for an hour; this will separate the thick part from the watery part, which you'll want to dump so your icing won't be watery. Melt 4 tablespoons of instant chocolate in 1 tablespoon of butter. Let it cool and once it's room temperature mix in the table cream. Pour it over the fresh-out-of-the-oven cake, let it cool and set, and it's done! I personally like to make my cake in round pans so that it drizzles on the side! Also it will NOT mix in with the cake!

Yum, reminds of the time I spent in Brazil.  I just couldn't get the chocolate on top right. I used unsweetened coco, perhaps I should have used something like Nestle Quick.

This was a very good cake. I did succumb to putting vanilla and cinnamon in it. I made the right choice. It is pretty simple to make, so I will make it every time I have extra carrots around. The cake was soft and awesome, but the icing didn't turn out for me. I have to say, though, that this is the fist time I've made icing, so it might be me. Actually I found it didn't need icing after it cooled anyway because it had a nice semi-crisp top! My husband uses his coffee spoon to eat it with and just loves the taste combo.

My room-mate, many years ago, was from Brazil and she made this cake. I loved it and sense then I've been trying to find the recipe. Thank you so much for posting this, it's just like I remembered.

Not quite carrot-y enough for the Brazilian cake we have eaten in Brazil, but it was delicious non the less. We ate it all in less than a day! It is a keeper :)

It's a great recipe! I was just concerned about the amount of sugar the recipe asked for but the cake turned out great. I'm also brazilian and this was the first time I got the frosting right! I loved it!

I tried this recipe for my son's school project.  I must have done something wrong...My frosting DID NOT melt into the cake.  I sperad it all over and a few minutes later it was like a little crust....But it was VERY GOOD anyway... Not sure what went wrong, but good  anyway....what should I have done or not done to have frosting melt into hte cake???  maybe cooked frosting too long and it was too thick???   like I said, good anyway...  Thanks

I made it yesterday and it tastes great. Instead of this icing, though, I made a chocolate ganache with heavy cream and chocolate chips. Super easy.

My cake was still raw in the middle, I guess it could've used a few more minutes in the oven, even though it was in there for more than 1 hour.

I made this for my sister and her Brazilian husband.  They live in Brazil and this is a very common dessert there.  She said it tasted exactly like the ones there.  The whole family raved about how tasty and moist it was.  I will definitely make it again!

Great recipe. My mother in law makes this cake and everyone loves it... Decided to take her on and challenge her with this cake. Turned out very moist, but a bit dense. For the chocolate ganache I used 4 pieces of dark chocolate, milk, butter and sugar till I got the consistency I wanted. Didn't like the hot chocolate mix idea, it's super sweet.

I am Brazilian and this recipe is spectacular. One thing I always change is the frosting: melt 6 oz of 70% dark chocolate, add one tablespoon of butter and apply it to the cake.

I made this on the recommendation of a Brazilian friend for a Brazilian themed party and it was a hit. Super easy too. My husband especially loved it so I am sure I will be making it again.

Excellent cake, I shared it with friends and they all feel in love with Brazilian Carrot Cake! The icing was a bit grainy, but that may have been my fault and not the recipes's. I will definitely be making it again!

As in other carrot cake recipes, grating carrots is much easier. There's no point in putting hard carrots in a blender. I did it because that's what the recipe called for, and I wanted to try a different method. Anyhow, think I ruined my blender, even though the eggs were in the mixture and the oil. The chocolate frosting did turn out well, but there's a lot of it. The cake is very orange. The combo of the two wasn't to my liking. There's other carrot cake recipes out there much better than this one.
