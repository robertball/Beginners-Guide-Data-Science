Overall, this was good, but the spices were too subtle in my opinion. Next time, I'll double them and cook the chili peppers earlier instead of adding them at the end. I found it easier to dice the raw potatoes and then boil them for a shorter period of time, and I sliced the okra because the recipe didn't say what to do with it. I didn't use MSG. Update: I added vege broth to the leftovers, and it made a really good soup that enabled the brightness of the tamarind paste to shine. As soup, the amount of spice was just right.
