This tastes great! However, one key thing was left out- you have to have room temp egg whites.  If that had been in the recipe, it would have saved me a little extra work.  Maybe you all know that already though!  Some other hints, while we're on the topic of meringue, are to use a metal (not plastic) bowl and make sure everything is clean of oils of any kind.  Using an electric mixer really helps as well.  Hope that helps out anyone else who is also rather a novice in the kitchen!

This recipe works great even with canned sweet potatoes.  Just drain them well, and throw them in the mixing bowl.  

There is NO need for additional sugar.

Delicious. I added some brown sugar to the layer of walnuts because I was afraid it wasn't going to be sweet enough. I got compliments on this dish at Thanksgiving.

This was INCREDIBLY GOOD 10 Stars. My husband said "Restaurant Quality" I followed the recipe exactly as posted. The only complaint I have is that it is quite a small quantity. I did not bake it in a 9X9 it was going to be too little and to flat. Next time I will double up the ingredients. WOW we really loved it!

Made this for Thanksgiving this year, and got lots of good reviews :) It was yummy. There was some confusion, however, as to if it was to be served hot or cold... we went the hot route, but by the time all the fixin's were on my plate, and I was ready to eat, the sweet potato was cold. So use an oven, not a hot-plate to keep it warm before eating-time. (It made good left-overs btw :D)

Was a good dish to bring to a Thanksgiving potluck, got a lot of interest. Only thing I might want it a little sweeter.

I added brown sugar to mix, that being said, this is fabulous.  I will be making this often and have passed it on to friends and family.  Thank you for sharing.  WOW

This was good. I wouldn’t use this for a holiday meal, but it’s a nice change from my routine roasted sweet potatoes. The merengue flattened when it cooled and did taste a bit eggy, but I liked it

No sugar added to potatoes. Add sugar to meringue to form peaks. Going to try i without the egg yolks next time.
