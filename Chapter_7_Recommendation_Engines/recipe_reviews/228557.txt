Delicious, not too sweet, easy to make.  I added 1/4 t. of cinnamon (I LOVE cinnamon!) and 1/4 c. flour on the off chance the figs made the cookies too liquidy - these additions were perfect.  Next time, I might lightly sprinkle sugar on the cookies before baking just for a little extra pizazz.

I doubled the figs and left out the walnuts (we're not walnut fans) and YUM! very good. Nice and chewy and not too sweet, even with the extra figs.

I thought it was yummy, so did my co-workers.
I doubled the recipe because I bought a box (13 figs) for $5.
Cut 5 whole figs up into small pieces, instead of scooping the meat.  I did not put in walnuts because I did not have any.  Since figs were sweet I decreased amount of white sugar.
I placed on parchment paper instead of greased pan.
If you like figs, add few more in the batter, to your own liking.
I would make it again.

Left out the walnuts. Had some trouble with the dough being really sticky, but overall liked the taste of them. Kept the dough refrigerated between batches, that seemed to help.

Delicious! Recipe is great as written. The only change I made was to use pecans instead of walnuts, and I also minced the whole figs in the food processor and added to batter.

Made these almost as written -- I probably used more figs than called for and added a little more cinnamon (oh, and one time I added nutmeg) -- and they are delicious! I gave them to a friend and her son, and he said he never realized I was such a good baker.  :)  I accidentally melted the butter the second time I made these, and they still turned out great.  One thing I noticed is that the cookies on the bottom rack tended to get dark on the bottoms before they were quire done.

These were delicious. My edges did get a little dark but I loved the extra - little bit of texture it gave the cookies. They aren't too sweet but have a ton of flavor... and I typically love sweet desserts! This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing it!

This recipe was excellent. I used 1/2 tsp gingerbread spice instead of cinnamon to add a bit more flavour, and a few more figs than called for because they were turning. The cookies were all gone within an hour of baking them!

It was an easy recipe and tasted more like a sugar cookie than an august fig cookie. We also needed to chop our fig to get chunks of figs and we needed to chop our nuts too. Other than that they were delicious, not too sweet but not too fig-like.

This was a surprising hit.  I had fresh figs and needed to figure out what to do with them.  I made this exactly as the recipe calls for, except I did 1 batch without nuts just for those that don't like them.  Both batches were enjoyed.  I've already shared the recipe with two other people.

These cookies were kind of plain. I even added a little extra fig to the batter and I put the minced fig on top as it said to do before baking. I had previously made a different fig cookie that called for 1/4 tsp of clove. My husband and I liked them so I decided to add a little clove to my remaining batter and that seemed to do the trick to give these cookies that little something extra. I also used pecans instead of walnuts.

I made this recipe to serve 48 and it made 6 1/2 dozen.

I baked these cookies as directed with a couple of changes: 1) After washing the figs and taking off the stems, I used a food processor to chop up the walnuts and figs. Then I worked the figs and walnuts into the dough adding flour  to help with the stickiness of the dough. 2) I divided the dough in 2 balls and refrigerated for about an hour taking only one out at a time to work with. 3) Since I multiplied everything by 4, I needed to reserve more fig pulp to put on top. I set aside 6 heaping tablespoons and still needed to used some of my fig jam for the last batch. Maybe 8 tablespoons would have been better.

They taste great! They are soft and crunchy with the walnuts. The have a hint of cinnamon and the topping is what really made them delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly, though I may have been a little generous with the figs.  Used a small cookie scoop and got about 27 cookies.  They came out exactly like the picture!  Love the taste and texture.  This is a great use for the figs from my backyard tree.

No walnuts and extra figs.
Figs are so beautifully this time of year.
Thanks
