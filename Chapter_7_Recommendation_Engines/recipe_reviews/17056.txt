Good coffee flavor, but not very sweet despite the fact that I increased the brown sugar in them to 1/2 cup.  Due to previous comments about dryness, I increased the milk to 1 cup and mine seemed sufficiently moist.  This recipe easily made a dozen for me.  I doubled the topping ingredients per another reviewer's suggestion and was glad I did.  However, next time I'll omit the pecans from the topping.  They became very "roasted" and had a burnt flavor and appearance which greatly detracted from the muffins.  I'll just sprinkle the muffins with 1/4 cup brown sugar to give them a shiny appearance.

Everyone enjoyed these and were surprised at the unique blend of flavors.

They didn't *look* as pretty as I would have liked though.  Next time, I will play with the leavening agents to see if I can get them to rise higher.  Also, there wasn't enough topping to top them generously.  I would probably double the topping.

Thanks for a great recipe, Julie!

My family LOVED these muffins.  I made them for a friend and had to make two batches because we ate too many.  The coffee taste really comes through - they taste like an English Toffee Cappaccino! --  J. Jackson

Loved them!  Wonderful, rich, deep coffee flavor.  A bit crumbly, I'm going to try for a bit moister next time.  WILL be making these again!

The taste is very good, but they could be a little sweeter. Very easy to make. The muffins were moist the first day, but were dry by the second, even in a tight container. They're not real pretty, but as a guy, I don't care. This recipe is great for people who love the smell of coffee brewing but hate to drink it.

These muffins tasted great but were really dry!  Almost like a cookie dough consistancy.   But my muffin customers enjoyed dunking them in their coffee and ask for more.  Thanks!

I thought these were good.  I enjoy the flavor and because they're not so sweet I don't have the desire devour all at one time.  I can have my morning coffee by eating a muffin, gotta like that!!!

My family did not care for these muffins.  They are not sweet and have a VERY strong coffee flavor.  (They only have 1/3 cup brown sugar and the topping doesn't make them sweet.)

I read all of the reviews prior to making this and decided to make some changes.  I added in 1/2 t cinnamon (will probably up to 1 t).  Due to many reviewers talking about the muffins being dry and not a strong coffee flavor, I dissolved the coffee (I used a darker roast) in 2 T of water, this added some moisture and it helped to make sure the coffee flavor got distributed evenly.  My muffins came out moist (I cooked for 15 min) and had a strong coffee flavor.  Overall a pretty good recipe, especially if you want something a little different.  I could see uping the sugar to 1/2 c or maybe adding in 1/4 c white sugar, as has been said they are not very sweet.  ENJOY!

Very easy to make.  I liked the coffee flavor and actually could have done with a bit more.  I substituted vanilla soy milk for the milk and it added a nice touch of sweetness.  Next time I think I will add a little more vanilla soy milk and some cinnamon for more moisture and an extra flavor kick, but I will be making them again.

These muffins are just ok. I think they might be better if you added more sugar and maybe some cinnamon as others have suggested. They just aren't sweet enough, and the coffee flavor is so pronounced that they are bordering on bitter tasting. I added about a teaspoon more coffee, and baked them for 18 minutes. They came out quite moist, but lacking something in flavor.

I've been making these for a couple of years.  They are a favorite with my friends and family.  I haven't had a problem with dryness.  They are not too sweet, and have a wonderful coffee flavor.

I made this twice, thinking I read the recipe wrong, but both times the muffins came out very dry. At least it was fun letting my friends guess the secret ingredient (the coffee).

Although some reviewers thought this had too much coffee flavor, I substituted espresso powder for the instant coffee and I still didn't think the coffee flavor was very pronounced.  The only thing that gave these muffins any flavor at all was the pecans.

My husband loves these.  I increased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and increased the milk as well.  I more than doubled the topping too.  I used ground pecans instead of chopped.
these are great!

These were very nice, but quite crumbly. I will make this recipe again, but I'll let them cool longer than the 5 minutes before serving. I'm not a regular coffee drinker, so I thought the coffee flavor was ample. Next time I will also increase the amount of brown sugar and double the topping ingredients. I did not have a problem with the muffins being dry; they were sufficiently moist. I've had similar coffee-flavored muffins before, but they had chocolate chips instead of pecans; I like this recipe with just the pecans much better.

After reading the reviews, i decided to  double the recipe, add a bit more sugar, and changed the topping to a crumble mix. Instead of adding pecans into the batter, i added them with the crumble topping. Turned out 24 great lil muffins!

A very good muffin that isn't too sweet.  I toasted the pecans before using, added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and because I was short on brown sugar I topped them with cinnamon, white sugar and the chopped nuts.  Turned out very good.  My muffins were done a lot sooner than the stated baking time - about 15 minutes.  Good recipe, thanks.

I've made these muffins several times and they have always come out beautifully. My tasters said the muffins were a little bitter, so I added an extra half cup of brown sugar to the mix.

I agree with others in that these are not sweet muffins.  That being said, I loved the flavor - not your typical fruit or cinnamon muffin.  I had to decrease the baking time by a few minutes, so monitor yours closely. Since I wanted a sweeter version, I made a glaze using confectioner's sugar and cold liquid coffee and drizzled this over the cooled muffins - they turned out amazing.  The big guy loved these, so they'll be showing up with the morning coffee regularly.

ok, lightly sweet muffin.
