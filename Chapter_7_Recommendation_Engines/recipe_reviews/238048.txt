Coleslaw was very good, I added a couple tablespoons of soy sauce and loved it even better.

It was so easy and so good. I made it to go with my spring rolls,, and they went so good together. I will be making it again.

I love this!  I don't use beef ramen because I'm vegetarian, but there is vegetarian ramen (shrimp).  I also use a little sesame oil.
