Forget the butter...too messy! I rubbed my two tenderloins with olive oil and the seasonings. Everything else about the recipe is perfect and the pork was SO moist, tender and delicious! The leftovers make the most wonderful pork sandwiches. Thanks....a hit with the family, and so easy too!

This was really delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The only problem I had was getting the butter to stick to the loin.  I patted it dry first, but the butter just continued to come off on my hands, so I mixed the butter with the salt, pepper and herbs and was then able to get it to stick to the pork.  I will definitely make this again, we loved the contrast of the sweet preserves against the salty pork.

This dish was so yummy! The tenderloin was so perfectly moist and the glaze was to die for.  The only thing I did different was to put a fresh sprig of rosemary under and on top of the tenderloin.  You will want to make sure that you reserve enough apricot mixture to pour over the finished product!

Made as written with the exception of the sherry.  I didn't have any on hand and used a dry burgandy wine.  The tenderloin was wonderful and moist, but the sauce made it so much better.  I microwaved the remaining sauce and drizzled over the pork medalions. Will definitely make this recipe again.

This was very easy to make. I didn't bother with rubbing butter on the pork. Instead I sprinkled salt, pepper and some fresh rosemary on it prior to baking. For the sauce, I used fresh garlic, sherry and apricot jam. I didn't bother with the honey. My family really liked this dish. I served with roasted potatoes and saut√©ed sugar snap peas.

Made this tonight and it was a hit.  I loved how easy it was to make.  I made this recipe with only one minor change. I brushed the tenderloin with olive oil rather than using the butter, otherwise I followed the directions and it was awesome.  Served it with green beans and mushrooms and mashed potatoes and a salad.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I changed the recipe up a bit because I couldn't find apricot preserves in the store. I used peach instead, and grand marnier instead of sherry. My pork tenderloin wasn't dry at all, and the sauce adds everything you could want.

This was good and simple.  I used olive oil instead of butter.  Next time I make this I will omit the honey and add some horseradish and dijon mustard.

This was excellent!  My husband and I both loved it!  The only change was that I used "Hot Mama's Apricot Habenero Jelly" (google it -- she's out of Utah and it's great jelly!)  and used red wine instead of sherry.  I served it w/ rice I made in my rice cooker w/ vegetable stock instead of water and a side of green beans.  I liked the hot jelly and it gave it some kick!  Also threw in a 1/2 teaspoon of dijon mustard and left out the honey.  It tasted as though it had marinated over night -- couldn't believe it was this flavorful for only 15 minutes of the glaze at the end.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

This was amazing.  I used Merlot since I did not have any sherry, but I think it was delicious.  It also heats up beautifully in the oven.  I like my pork just a little pink, and it was very tender.  I basted the tenderloin several times with the honey apricot sauce.

I liked this the first time I made it however the second time I did not like it at all.  Not sure if it is the size pan I used or not but by the time it was done cooking it was practically covered in juices.  I prefer my meat a liitle drier and crispy on the edges but moist inside.

I love that this recipe is easy to make, it doesn't require weird ingredients and the KIDS LOVED IT. 

The only change I made was putting Olive Oil in substitution of butter and I used apricot, peach, passion fruit spread because that's what was on sale. 
It's a great recipe to have on hand and I will definitely make it again and again.

I found the recipe to quite easy and it was delicious.  First of all, I used a pork loin roast.  I made a few adaptations and they worked well.  I used minced fresh thyme mixed with garlic salt in melted butter and brushed it over the meat. For the glaze, I left out the honey and added 1 tsp. of grey poupon dijon mustard.  It was sweet and savory at the safe time and my husband loved it.  I will definitely be making it again, thanks for sharing the recipe!

I have made this twice and nailed it both times!! 1st time was for a work pot luck so I made it in my crock pot, odd experience but it turned out well. 2nd time We buttered and s&p'd the pork then marinated it in the apricot mixture -for a day and a half. I then baked it at 350 for approx and hour rotating a couple times.. AWSOME!!

Loved this! I agree the butter step is messy but IMO very much worth it! The house smells amazing and it adds that rich butter flavor, I used 1/4 of the butter the recipe called for. The leftovers were wonderful and very versitile definitely make more than you need. Will make again and again.

Very good! I didn't have thyme, so used oregano. I also didn't have Sherry, so I used 2 tbsp pineapple juice. I will make again. Our company was very happy with the meal.

Very nice!  I brushed the loin with olive oil, then wrapped it in bacon, seared it in a hot skillet until browned, then reduced the cooking time.  Since I didn't have peach, I used pineapple mango spreadable fruit in the sauce and served with coconut rice--will definitely do this one again!

I liked this recipe, but did have to substitute a Syrah for the Sherry and olive oil for butter.  It was a bit too much garlic for me (and I only used 1/2 the amount suggested), but I don't normally use a lot of garlic, so that is definitely an ingredient you want to adjust per your tastes.  Next time, I think I will use less wine in an effort to get the apricot preserves to "stick" to the pork better and I plan to add a little ginger and perhaps crushed red pepper to it.  I will definitely try again.

I used a 3.5 lb. tenderloin, but halved the other ingredients (because of the size preserves I had). I omitted the honey completely. I brushed the melted butter on the meat and then seasoned it. I used about 2/3 of the apricot sauce on the meat as it cooked and then served the rest on the side. Delicious!

Really good.  I served this with rice.  The pork was tender and flavorful.  Definitely better than the store bought pre-marinated stuff.

I used orange marmalade and it worked well.  I think I would try marinading the pork tenderloin in some soy and marmalade for a couple hours, next time.  I'd like that flavor to permeate and be more than a sauce.

My hubby liked this much more than I did.  I followed the recipe as written but halving it.  There was twice as much sauce as needed, and the butter does not work.  It didn't brown as I'd hoped it would with the sweet sauce on it.  I'll let him have the leftovers in sandwich form, which I'm sure he will love.  Thanks, Hope!

Great!!  The pork was incredibly tender and very moist- my guests raved about it.  I didn't have sherry so I used red wine. I also stirred the roast dripping into the extra glaze- delicious, but it thinned out the glaze so I added a bit of corn starch and boiled a few minutes.

This is the first time I have made a pork tenderloin and it was amazing thanks to this recipe!  I didn't use the honey since my Apricot Jam is homemade and already really sweet.  I baked it in the oven uncovered and basted it twice during the last 15 minutes and it was juicy, tender and very flavorful.  I served this with homemade mashed potatoes, stuffing and greenbeans with dinner rolls and my boyfriend and I were in heaven! This was so easy, I will be making this more often now!

This was EXCELLENT!  Even though I changed this up quite a bit, I think my end result was similar to the intent of the recipe.  We used a 1 1/4 lb. tenderloin and I opted to skip the butter - didn't think it was necessary. I thought the amount of glaze was excessive, so I only made 1/4 the amount in the recipe and didn't add the honey, as I thought it was sweet enough.  I reserved half of the glaze for drizzling on when serving.  Hubs grilled this and basted with the other half of the glaze.  It grilled up beautifully - looked fabulous!  This made for a wonderful dinner and required almost no effort ‚Äì quick, easy and DELICIOUS!

This was "Holy  Invite People Over For Dinner" Good!!  The only change I did was to use a lovely Brandy since I had no Sherry.  (There is a joke in there I know.)  Quick and easy to prepare.

Loved it.  Following the suggestion to use EVOO instead of butter, I roasted the meat for a little under 30 minutes before basting, and took it out a little early as well.  We like our pork tenderloin on the medium rare side. I had half the amount of apricot preserves on hand, but it worked fine.  I also followed the suggestion to use fresh minced garlic instead of powdered. I heated the sauce mix in the microwave to make it spreadable. I served the meat, sliced in 1/2 inch slices, over a salad of mixed greens (sweet frisee, red oak, lollo rossa, green tango),  that had been tossed with scallions, mandarin orange sections, and chopped smoked almonds with a homemade dijon vinaigrette. Drizzled the sauce on the meat before serving. It was superb.

All I had was fresh apricots, so I halved them, lightly touched them with a little olive oil then popped them on the grill for the last 4-5 minutes while my tenderloin that had been coated with fresh thyme, flat leave parsley, kosher salt, pepper and a little orange infused olive oil.  The tartness of the grilled apricots went very well with the pork medallions i got out of the tenderloin.

The seasonings and sauce were very nice.  Apricot with pork works, but the thyme, honey and sherry were great additions in their own right.

The recipe was followed as written, but the flavour was bland.  There are other pork recipes with more flavourful easy sauces / rubs / marinades to try.

This was really good and the kids all liked it, as some other reviewers mentioned. I used orange marmalade because that's what I had on hand and put it in the crock pot for about 5 1/2 hours. Great entree.

Me and my SO thought the sherry was overbearing. We couldn't put the extra sauce on the pork... But we both agree that if we omit the sherry next time, it will probably be amazing.

I used this recipe for a luncheon at church and served 80 people.  It was a big hit.  It was easy to make even for that many people and was delicious.  I got lots of compliments.  I will make this again; maybe next time just for my family.

Excellent!  This was a moist and flavorful roast.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  Even my 5 year old daughter, who is a very picky eater, tried it and asked for more.  We will be making this recipe again.

Very good flavor and very easy.  When I have homemade preserves I use our spiced peach preserves.  I only make about 1/2 the glaze that the recipe calls for so as not to waste homemade preserves.

Easy and tasty, will definitely make again. I did add Dijon mustard and some cayenne, which gave a nice counterbalance to the sweet. I used olive oil on the pork instead of butter just for ease and didn‚Äôt miss the butter. I would use this sauce as a glaze for ham as well. Really tasty, and the pork was tender to boot.

Made this using three small organic pork tenderloins I had just purchased from my CSA.  Made just a few  small additions, including about a tablespoon of soy sauce to counter the sweetness, and about 1/4 cup of white wine. It came out perfect and the family just gobbled it up! Tender, juicy, and the sauce worked! We‚Äôll be making it again in this house.

I used this on a whole pork loin. Brined it first. Was fabulous. Served it at Thanksgiving, along with three turkeys. It was almost all gone. Try it.

Very good, would definitely make again. I had only a 12 oz jar of apricot preserves, so added some applesauce to make up for that. I'm sure that it diluted the flavor somewhat but it was still good! Reading all the comments about the butter, I decided to melt it, put it it a bowl with the meat, get the meat all buttery and then add the seasonings. I then put it all in the pan for the oven. It seemed like a lot of butter, but just thought "oh well". Later, my son spooned the butter, drippings, and glaze mixture (from the glaze dripping off the cooking meat) onto his mashed potatoes, and said it was very good! I cooked the meat a bit too long, but it was still tender and tasty. I warmed up the bit of unused glaze to add to the meat at serving.

I've made better tenderloin recipes.....this one wasn't our favorite.  Maybe because I used no sugar apricot preserves or because I didn't sear the meat first.....just wasn't that great for us!

I made this recipe almost as it tells you too. The only change I made was use soy sauce instead of sherry and eliminated the honey. It was sweet enough without it. Came out very tasty and moist. Will definitely make again.

I made this according to the recipe and my husband and I loved it.  The pork was moist, tender and just the right light pink color.  I used the sauce to flavor my potatoes and served it with grilled asparagus.  I will add this recipe to my list of company meals.

This recipe was awesome, although I did change it up just a bit. I put my tenderloin on the grill, using the offset method of cooking (using the burners on one side of the grill, and placing the tenderloin on the other to avoid burning).  I carefully brought the grill temperature up to 400, and grilled for about 1.5 hours to reach the recommended temperature of the pork. 
Made the sauce as written, glazed the tenderloin through the cooking process, and it turned out perfect. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Made this as part of a bring-a-meal-to-the-new-mom dinner!  I never tasted it.  I received the longest thank-you text I have every received.  I was almost embarrassingly glowing and all abut the roast. She and her husband were wild for it!  I didn't adjust a thing!

This was really good. I made it just as written. Only one exception...I used soy sauce in place of the sherry. The sauce was amazing....over both the meat and the mashed potatoes I served with the meal. The cooking times listed were nearly perfect. Used my instant read thermometer and it was right on. Certainly want pork to be cooked thoroughly, but just a few minutes too long and it becomes quite tough and chewy. This was nearly perfect! Stick with the recipe and with the roasting time on this recipe, also!

We had our best friends over for dinner.  It was an absolute winner, everyone loved it!  I just put all the sauce in when baking it and when it was done I let the pork rest while I thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  Saving as a favorite, thanks!!

I loved it ...family was okay with it. I browned the loins in a pan first, then added the glaze mix. Cooked it for 30 minutes then started glazing every 5 mins. for a total of 50 mins cooking time. It was still juicy and there was plenty of sauce to put over rice. I have to add that I felt the alcohol needed to cook off and that is why I cooked it in the pan for 10 mins. before glazing the meat with it.

I have made this several times now and have done many variations, so I thought it was a good time to review.  This is a great recipe to use as a starter and change up to your liking.  My boyfriend and I both love this....he loves it mostly because it always makes TONS of delicious pork, and I love it because it's amazingly simple.  Here is what I do-I use olive oil instead of butter as many others said to do (though tonight I FORGOT the olive oil-and it was still amazing); I season with salt, pepper, and thyme as written; I don't use the honey because we try to watch our sugar intake and it's not needed.  I have made this with peach jam, no sugar and low sugar apricot jam, and apple butter, and all are delicious, but as others have said you don't need a whole jar.  Lastly, tonight I poured some hard cider in the baking dish and added slced apples, and the pork was incredibly tender, and it was so good with apples.  I usually serve with either roasted sweet potatoes or butternut squash and a salad.  Thanks Hope, for the recipe, I make it all the time!

Delicious and tender, easy to make, this is a keeper! I used coarse kosher salt and coarse black pepper, and substituted olive oil for butter in the rub. For two 1-lb tenderloins there was a lot of sauce, could have made half as much and still had plenty. Guess I'll have to make this again to use it up!

This was pretty easy and I am not the greatest cook. It turned out to be really good and my family liked it. I used olive oil instead of butter.

I have never written a review before, but I feel compelled to after making this recipe.  This is by far the best pork recipe I have ever had!  The flavors combine to make the perfect blend of sweet and tangy.  The pork is so tender it cuts with a fork.  Even my very picky kids couldn't get enough of this delicious meal.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe.  It is perfect just as it is. There is plenty of sauce to spoon over the pork. Yum!!!

Just made this for company.  Followed the recipe as written, but substituted a little orange juice and apple cider vinegar for the sherry and added some dijon mustard.  It was very juicy and tender and was a hit. Served it with roasted potatoes, peas/mushrooms/pearl onions and dinner rolls. Will definitely make this again for future dinners.

We loved this...the only thing we left out was the salt because we are trying to cut it out of our diets. Perfectly tender, great flavor. Can't wait to make again!
