I made this breakfast pizza today, and my family gobbled it up!  The only place in the recipe where I strayed, was instead of using crescent rolls for the crust, I used pizza dough that I bought at a health food store.  I followed the other reviews, and forced myself to use only 3 eggs (since I am notorious for using more than the recipe calls for), and I'm really glad I stuck to the recipe!  3 eggs was the perfect amount!  Note: Make sure you give your pizza dough an "edge", since the eggs will run over the sides if they're not properly penned in!  Buon appetite!! :)

Very good. I made a mistake the first time I made this recipe, I added two more eggs because it did not seem to be enough as I was preparing the pizza.  Big mistake, you need to follow the recipe exactly and it turns out great.

This was so good! I've made it 2 saturdays in a row now for my family. Instead of bacon, we used italian sausage taken out of the skins, and made sure to blot well. The first time I used garlic and butter crescents, the second time i used plain- the garlic and butter ones were AWESOME! I was also pleasantly surprised that the crescents stayed flaky despite being under all the filling. I added one more egg, and it seemed just right to me. I added 2 more eggs the second time, and it was definately too much.

While not the best breakfast pizza I've ever had, this is pretty good, and very easy and quick to whip together.  I would suggest adding some sort of meat- whether it be sausage, bacon, or ham, because I made it without and it was pretty bland.  Used a 13x9 pan, sprayed some pam down, and rolled out the crescent rolls.  Baked for 27 minutes and it was perfect.  The egg mixture doesn't seem like enough, but when it cooks it turns out perfectly.  Will make again.  Forgot- did bake this at 350 too, and it was just right.

If I could I would give this recipe more stars!  I first had this at a moms group I attend.  I was overjoyed when I saw this recipe on this site.  Anyhow, I have made this recipe several times now, and we love it!  It is nice to have something "different" for breakfast.  Also, I have to agree with other reviewers that the eggs don't look like enough, but the amount is perfect.

This was a great base idea. I cooked the crescent rolls for about 5 min before adding the toppings to prevent sogginess, used crumbled turkey sausage and added gravy. I also softly pre-scrambled the eggs to prevent leaking. Used Mexican blend cheese and it was great! Made two and used a pizza crust for one and crescents for the other--both great!

Very tasty and you can add/substitute ingredients to taste.  It doesn't seem like it's enough eggs when you put it all together but it's fine when it's all cooked.  My family really liked it.

Really Great! I used Pizza Dough I from this site instead of cresent rolls and shredded fresh potato(microwave for 45 sec.) I pre baked my crust for a few minutes so the bake time was much shorter. Thank you for the recipe- it's nice to know how to make this for myself!

Great breakfast.  Easy to make.  I only put sausage on half and doubled the hashbrowns.

Perfect as written!  No changes needed here other than serving with Frank's Red hot.  I've made this two days in a row.  The second time, I made a sausage gravy to drizzle over the top.  DELISH!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Really good!  I had a pre-made pizza crust which was 16 inches, so I used 5 eggs.  I didn't have any hash browns on hand, so I grated a couple potatoes.  This recipe is very versatile.  I've made it bacon and onions, and I also enjoy the flavor of adding some powdered mustard to the eggs.  My husband loved it!

Good recipe but to let everyone  know, you can do this in a 2 qt. casserole dish! I've done the same thing before except I added banana peppers. It's easier in a casserole dish,at least for me! anyway,good luck to anybody who makes it.

This recipe is one I've been using since I saw it in the Taste of Home magazine a few years ago.  Make sure to drain or blot the sausage so it's not too greasy. A popular favorite with an early morning church group I used to teach.

I asked my 3 year old what she wanted for breakfast and she said Pizza so I looked and found this recipe and had pretty much everything on hand. I used the sheet crescent roll, Jimmy dean turkey sausage crumbles, colby jack cheese and I ended up using 5 eggs and less milk. I think it depends on the size of eggs you use. I left out the hashbrowns because the kids don't care for hashbrowns. Both of my little girls loved their pizza with eggs

My family enjoyed this recipe a lot! I doubled the hashbrowns but followed the recipe exactly other than that. The one thing that I didn't like was the thinness of the crust. Because it was so thin, it ended up being super crunchy and overcrisp and dark brown, and I baked it at the minimum amount of baking. Next time, I may add another half container of crescent rolls to the crush.

Great for a house full of teenagers and little kids both.  I didn't have cresent rolls on hand but did have pizza dough....still turned out great, just had to bake longer. For the older crowd I added onions, mushrooms and peppers.

Very good.  I think I will copy another reviewer and do this in a 13X9 pan next time.  I used maple sausage and the taste was delicious.

I loved this but I did make changes to suit my pickyness. I only like brown n serve maple breakfast sausage links so I cut them up small and put them on the pizza and I used half the egg because I don't eat eggs but knew the pizza needed a binder and it came out so good it was devoured in seconds!

This was good, a little boring, but good. I made it exactly as called for and it was delicious, but missing something in my mind, not sure what. my only complaint with it is that the dough doesn't really roll flat enough to fit the pan. but a plus for me was that it tastes really good cold. and that i'm not a fan of eggs, and they didn't have a pronounced taste to it.

Excellent, excellent. I am making this for all of my colleagues because it is so good. I don't eat the frozen hashbrowns so I just grated a couple potatoes and put it in its place. The potatoes were thoroughly cooked when done. Also, the 3 eggs the recipe calls for is exactly what is needed, nothing more.

This tastes great! It is a little high in fat because of the crescent rolls and sausage, but you can always modify as needed. 

The thing is, ALL pizza makes a good breakfast. It is a balanced meal in a slice. You can also use canned refrigerated pizza dough, and put on whatever your family likes. You control the cheese, etc. Any way you make it, pizza makes a breakfast that is filling, won't cause blood sugar rushes, and will last kids until lunch at school.

LOVED this! I didn't have a pizza pan, so I used a 8x13 cake pan. Folded the edges and doubled the eggs and cheese. Very filling and very yummy!

This recipe is so good. The only things that I did differently was that I added cooked bacon (chopped up) and then I also had to use 3 more slices of crescent rolls (dough). I do think that may have been because my pizza pan was a little larger. I cooked the breakfast pizza on the top rack and then placed a cookie sheet on the bottom rack as there was a little drippings of the egg. (It was not a lot at all but I didn't want it to burn on the bottom of the stove). DO NOT PUT MORE EGGS ON THE PIZZA! It may seem like it's not that much eggs but it all works out in the end. I originally cooked the pizza for 26 minutes. Took it out and let it sit 10 before cutting it and when I cut it I noticed that the bottom of the pizza was a little soft yet, so Iput it back for about 8 minutes which helped a lot. THe bottom of the pizza was never hard or crispy but it was still VERY delicious. I had company over for Christmas and made this and it was perfect. EVERYONE loved it. What's neat is that you can put whatever ingredients that you want. Green peppers, onions, etc. Also, the pizza makes 8 slices and I found that everyone (adults) had two slices each. Lastly I think this would be something that you could make ahead of time (assemble) and then in the morning just take it out of the fridge and bake. SO GOOD!!!

I made my own version: covered the "crust" with chimichurri sauce, diced up pork and leftover roast, sautee'd onions and threw them in, sliced up a bunch of mushrooms and put a layer of those in there, and topped it off with mozzerella and diced red pepper.

I used potatoes o'brien and cooked slightly before adding them and used chopped bacon instead of sausage.  I also followed the suggestion to cook the crust for 4 minutes prior to adding the rest of the ingredients.  Everyone loved it!

Very good!  Just a hint, do NOT use a cookie sheet.  My eggs went all over the place and made an absolute mess!

This was a great change for breakfast!  I used italian bulk sausage, added an extra egg (4 total), added onions and topped with cooked bacon.  The crescent rolls are a little difficult to spread on the pizza pan, but they made the recipe much better than using pizza crust.

Very tasty! I doubled the recipe and used a cookie sheet w/ edges to bake. It seemed that I had a lot of filling ingredients to spread over the biscuits, but I took it to a work breakfast party and it was gobbled up!  Will make again.

I thought this pizza was great! I typically don't like breakfast "casseroles" because there are too many eggs and it takes forever to cook - 3 eggs is the perfect amount to keep everything together! I used saus. bacon, onions and green peppers - there wasn't a bite left! Also I used a 13x9 and when unrolled the cresent rolls fit perfectly in my pan! Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing!

I tried this recipe yesterday when my brother and his fiance came over for breakfast.  It was a HUGE HIT!!!! . Two things I did diffrent is I made these in 9 x 13 pans and made 1 with bacon and 1 with sausage.  Between the 2 pans it took 3 packages of crescent rolls.  There was none left over by the next day.  After reading the suggestions I added two extra eggs to accomodate the size of the pan and that worked out fine. I will Definetly make this one again.

It was edible, but that's about the best I can say for it. The worst part was the crust. The hash browns were a close second. there was not enough egg. This needs work. I have a few ideas I'm going to try and see if I can't create something better.

I just made this for a breakfast at work and people absolutely loved it!  I think the recipe is great, but I used 2 cans of crescent rolls (for a bigger pizza) and then added more toppings.  It was just great.  People keep asking for the recipe...and so simple !

This is a great recipe for a breakfast pizza, and allows the cook to add as many ingredients as they wish! I have made this pizza with fresh and frozen potato, both are good. You can substitute the sausage with pre-cooked, or even bacon! I have tried both of these options and it was fantastic! Like other reviewers have said, three eggs do not seem like enough, just be sure to pour it evenly over the pizza. 3 eggs are just the right amount, otherwise the eggs will fluff up too much and takes away from the pizza quality/feel.

This was the best breakfast pizza my family has ever tasted.  It didn't take even 15 minutes to cook.  Next time we make this we will add bacon along with the sausage.  I agree with the other reviews 3 eggs was plenty.

I liked this but I think there was a bit too much sausage.  If I made it again I would use half the sausage and more hash browns.  Beware of maple sausage....it is way to sweet!

I used the garlic butter crescents which gave a nice kick of flavor!  I also used 1/2 regular pork sausage and 1/2 hot.  I will add one egg the next time I make this.  Might add some mushrooms too!  Very good!

my 9 year old took one bite and said, "You gotta make this more often!" He told my husband, "Dad, you gotta try this!" Then he asked for another piece! This is really easy & really tasty! I used bacon instead of sausage and added about 1/2 tsp of powdered mustard for added flavor!

I made this exactly as written except I pre-baked the crust  for about 5 minutes. It was good but bland. It definitely need something else, scallions would have been a nice touch. Not sure if I will make again or not. Not withuot significant changes.

i had the original receipe from taste of home. it seemed somewhat different.  the second time i made it, i used cubed hashbrowns instead of shredded, and added some extra shredded mozzarella cheese.  as i don't have all of the kitchen gadgets (pizza pan),  i used a number 10 cast iron skillet..........perfect at 28-30 mins.

This was great!  Very easy to throw together.  I added peppers and used a 9x13 pan because that's all I had and it turned out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe, just changed a little bit to taste. I baked in a 9x13 pan. I also added cheese sauce (like cheese flavored chip dip, i just used the plain kind) for where the pizza sauce would be. We love cheese and didn't want it to be too dry. Great recipe.

Just made it, DH and I loved it! Small changes:  1. made it in a 9x13 and precooked the crust for 5 min as suggested 2. I cooked the hashbrowns beforehand because I like them crispy!  3. We only had brown & serve links in the freezer so I defrosted them in the microwave and chopped them into little bits 4. 20 minutes at 375* was plenty in my oven

No taste really.  Made this exactly according to directions.  Was very tasteless besides the sausage. Needs onion, maybe peppers, maybe seasoning salt, I dunno- something.  Won't make this again.

Being that we are from Texas we just love to spice things up.  We used Mexican styled potatoes and added chopped jalepenos.  We also added a bit of crunchy bacon on top because my boyfriend, like any guy, loves it! Will definitely make this again.

Made this for Christmas morning paired with cinnamon rolls and leftover ham from Christmas Eve.  It was delicious.  I love most any breakfast casserole type dish.  Easy.

My kids and I love this recipe.  I would prefer it w/ onions and peppers, but since my kids gave it a thumbs up it is worth 5 stars.  Discovered that Pillsbury now have "sheets" of creasent roll dough.  Made it easy to make a rectangle pizza.

This was suprisingly easy and delicious! Had a house full, and everyone loved it - even the kids. I did pre-bake the crust as recommended. My pan was larger than the crust, so the sides were not contained and I did have egg spillage onto the pan. But it was still eggy enough (is that a word?).
I used turkey sausage and mexican blend cheese and served with picante sauce. Yum!

This was only OK.  I would much prefer to have a sausage omelet, hash browns and croissants separately.  All together, it's a little bland and mushy.

Tastes very good. I used Bob Evans Original sausage, will try next time their Sage sausage for more flavor. Also will try and add some red and yellow chopped peppers. I pre-baked the crust as was suggested and it was not soggy at all. Even my husband liked it. Next time I will half the recipe since it is far too much for the two of us. 
P.S. Love the Taste of Home recipes

I made this twice, tasted great both times.  Second time I made it in a greased angel food cake pan (smartware).  It was thicker (obviously), looked great,and made handheld easy to eat pieces.

I make this all the time.  The only thing different I do is to cook the dough for about 5 minutes before you add the toppings.  Otherwise it seems doughy to me.  Also I add more potatoes and salt and pepper.  And more cheese!  I layer potatoes, salt and pepper, cooked sausage, cheese, eggs, more cheese.  Comes out yummy every time.  It really is versatile.  If you like more spice add it...if you want peppers and onions add it.

The eggs ran right off the pizza cust onto the pan - and I even made edges to the crust. If I make it again i'll make scrambled eggs and put them on top after.

This breakfast pizza was surprisingly easy and fast...and oh, so good! Luckily for my wallet, the store was out of shredded hash browns, so I shredded two small potatoes and microwaved them just 'til tender. The number of eggs is fine, and it's very important to make a ridge around the edge to keep the eggs hemmed in. Next time I might try some crumbled bacon and diced mushrooms....and soon. This is a keeper.

This recipe was fantastic! I wouldn't reccomend cooking the dough for more than 5 minutes. Then the edges rise and when you go to pour the egg mixture on, it runs off the side. I made this for my family and they absolutley adored it, even the picky ones.

I used ham instead of sausage and added onion because I already had some chopped up in the fridge. It turned out really great! Next time I will use spicy sausage, and if I use onion again, I might also add chiles.

This is a great recipe, very easy to follow and quick to make. My children loved it! the only thing I would do differently is use a spicy sausage as I thought the overall taste was somewhat bland, but my personal preference is much more spice. The fact that my kids loved this is huge as this will be something I would make when the girls have sleepover guests.

My two picky eaters (2 and 4 year olds) ate it!  It is definitely a BIG HIT.
Slight modifications:  We used a pizza dough, added mushrooms and used a tablespoon of black olive tapenade in with the eggs.

This was hands-down THE best breakfast pizza we've ever made AND had! I must say that getting the crescent roll dough into a circle was a bit of a challenge, but well worth the effort! I'm gonna see how I can make this a freezer/make-ahead-friendly pizza. I would love to already have them made and all I would need to do is make the egg, pour it over, and go lie down until it's done! To make it and wait for it was about an hour and that's a bit of a long time to wait with preschoolers right after waking up. Overall, though, this was awesome and my kids and husband loved it! Thank you!

I made this for an Easter breakfast at church this morning, and it went over really well.  I don't care a whole lot for sausage, so it wasn't my cup o' tea, but people really seemed to like it.  I added chopped green and red pepper when I was browning the sausage, used homemade pizza dough, and about 1 1/2 cups of hash browns rather than 1 c.  I also realized after I poured on the eggs that I had no Parmesan, but I don't think anyone missed it. :)

Loved this!  So easy and delicious.  What's great is you can customize it to your liking (much like regular pizza).  I added spinach and mozzarella to mine.  The rest of my family added bacon.  I also used some leftover potatoes I had instead of hash browns.  The cresent roll dough was nice and flaky throughout.  My 4 year old son said, "Mommy!  Make this again and again!  I love it!"

Delish-I used refrigerated pizza crust dough instead of the crescent rolls as that's what I had. Think next time I'll halve the sausage as we though there was a but much but the flavor is great. Would also be good with some onions and bell pepper added in.

I've made this for my ladies' Bible study group a couple of times and they loved it.  It would work with pretty much any type of meat as I even used bacon bits!

I bought a pre-baked pizza crust and I didn't have hash brown, reason why I think the eggs were runny at the beginning. It was great, everyone loved it. Next time I will use hash browns.

This was very yummy! I used pizza crust since I had one I needed to use up. I also needed to add and extra egg. I will absolutley make this again! Next time I think I'll add chopped onions and maybe green peppers.

The whole family loves this!  It's so easy and feeds large groups when we get together with family using only 1 pan! The only thing I do different is add more pepper and use a 13 x 9 pan instead of the round pan.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made two of these this morning, using turkey sausage.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was written.  I left one at home for my kids and took the other to work.  They got rave reviews at both locations.  This will be our Christmas morning breakfast!

Made this for my family on Thanksgiving morning.  Everyone loved it.  I will use more hash browns next time or leave them out all together because you couldn't really taste them.  Make sure you seal up the seams well so the egg doesn't run out.

Just tried this today and can't believe how good it is!  Was tempted to add another egg because it didn't look like it was going to be enough, but I'm glad I didn't.  Will be making this more often that's for sure!!

I use this recipe all the time but I could never make an edge tall enough to keep the eggs from running all over the place.  When I do it I brown the crescent rolls slightly and VERY LIGHTLY scramble the eggs.  I spread the eggs on first then add toppings.  Be creative a lot of different things taste great.  Mushrooms...peppers... YUM

Great taste with all low fat/non fat ingredients.  I used the reduced fat crescent rolls, 40% reduced fat Gwaltney bacon, fat-free cheddar cheese, egg beaters with skim milk.  It's really a nice breakfast and still healthy.

I made this with the non-perforated crescent roll dough so I just unrolled it into a 9x13 greased pan.  It was very bland for us - I think if we'd make it again, I'd need to add onions and peppers.  We used a lot of ketchup to get it down.

This was awesome! I took the advice and used pizza dough. I put it on a pan and baked it for about 5 minutes. Then took it out and put the ingredients on it.  My daughter who hates to eat eggs, ate it and loved it!  I will be making this again!!!!!

I have made this recipe twice. Second time I added a 4 oz can of green chilies.  I also did not have a pizza pan so I used a pie plate. I had to adjust the baking time but it made a very thick breakfast pie.

This was super easy and very good.  I usually don't care for breakfasts bakes with eggs because they are "too eggy" - but this was a perfect mix and the kids loved that we had "pizza" for breakfast.  Thanks so much!

This recipe was very good and a welcomed change from the norm of pancakes or french toast in my household. I did make one change but not on purpose. When I started to make this I realized I didn't have Parmesan cheese on hand so I had to eleminated it all together. It still turned out great. Thank you for sharing a great recipe.

This is the best breakfast pizza I have ever made.  I made it 2 of them Christmas weekend and used leftover ham instead of sausag.  It was a big hit.  Everyone loved it.  Even my 3 year old son loved it.

I made this recipe years ago and lost the recipe.  I'm so glad I found it again.  I use the big crescent rolls - they are just easier to spread out in the pan.  I've used sausage and ham for this - if I'm in a hurry I use the pre-packaged diced ham from the deli section - works great!  I usually use 4 eggs - have done it with 5 - just takes an extra 5 mins or so in the oven to the get eggs done.  I like it plain but my husband insists on covering it with ketchup - which is how he eats most things with eggs. :)
