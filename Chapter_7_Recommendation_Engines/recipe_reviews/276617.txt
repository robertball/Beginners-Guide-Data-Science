10.27.19  Made this today to serve as a dipping sauce for Smoked Paprika Potato Wedges also on this site.  This aioli lives up to the recipe title because it is ideally spiced with balanced layers of sweet and spicy.  That little bit of sesame oil is distinctive in a very special way.  I can envision  lots of other other ways to use  this recipe.  This one's a keeper!

Great as written and would go with many different things. I used it as a dipping sauce for spring rolls and then used the leftovers for a dressing on a salad. Perfect combo of flavors!
