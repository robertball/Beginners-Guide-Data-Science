I thought this was very tasty considering it has walnuts rather than pine nuts. A little less expensive to make with very good results.

Honestly, this pesto had a little too much tang for me. In my experience, it seemed to have a little too much oil. Could've been user error, or too much pesto for the amount of pasta I used.

Turned out great. I would definitely make it again.
