This is one of the best asparagus recipes I have ever used, and I LOVE asparagus.  The only change I made was to add garlic into the oil with the prosciutto, and then again with the asparagus.  I also used some leftover chicken stock I had around instead of the water.  YUM

Was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover Easter ham and a pound of fresh asparagus but wasn't in the mood for something creamy.  This filled the bill!  I increased the amount of ham to 8 oz and cut the asparagus into 1 - 1 1/2 inch pieces.  Added a bit of chopped red sweet pepper for color.  By increasing the amount of ham, this became our entree which I served alongside homemade rice pilaf.  Excellent!  Hubby especially liked the added touch of freshly squeezed lemon.  Thank you.

This was absolutely scrumptious. The lemon really brought out the flavor of the asparagus. The texture was perfect, crisp, but cooked. I used pancetta because I had some left over from another recipe. The result was perfection! Another superb Chef John recipe!

Occasionally you come across a combination of flavors that is simply heaven. It may be out of season for asparagus, but the store had these lovely thin stalks that were so sweet and tender I just couldn't resist. Luckily I had a chunk of left over ham in the freezer that I chunked up.  I also sauteed some red and yellow bell peppers to the first step and those were a wonderful addition. I followed the directions to the letter and the result was perfectly cooked vegetables that were perfectly infused with the smokey ham, garlic and lemon.  I slurped up the entire thing for dinner.  It may be simple, but this is one of the best things I've made in a long time.

Loved this simple and refreshing asparagus recipe!  I used one tablespoon of oil based on some comments and next time around I would cut back on the lemon juice a little.  Thank  you!

Simple and really tasty. Letâ€™s the ingredients speak for themselves and only took as much time to cook as stated. Prepared by a 10 year old!

It was okay, tasted mostly like regular asparagus.  Medium high heat, is maybe too hot. I had the burner between 6 an 7 (out of 8) and that seemed to hot the ham was going to burn if cooked in oil for 4 minutes so I cooked it for less time, same with cooking the asparagus before pouring in the water.

Love this! I saute the garlic with bacon cut in thin 1/4" pieces, then add the asparagus and cook as instructed. After adding the lemon I top with a little Parmesan cheese.  Perfection!

I loved the flavor the lemon gave it at the end. The ham didn't really seem necessary. Asparagus has such a strong wonderful flavor on its own without the ham or prosciutto. Will definitely make again, just without any ham or prosciutto. Maybe ill try sliced almonds in its place.
