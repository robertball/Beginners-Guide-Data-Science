Best cornbread I have EVER made!  I have struggled to find good-tasting vegan cornbread, and simply none live up to the expectation I have of its taste and texture.  Until I tried this one, that is!  This is perfect.  The tofu gives it that fluffier consistency I was missing with my close second favourite that involves flax seed as an egg replacer.  When I made this, I substituted honey for the sugar.   I should also add I thought i worked best to make in muffin cups instead of in a square baking pan. I loved it and have made it more than once!  Definitely a "keeper."

This was overall pretty good. Sometimes vegan recipe makeovers don't taste anything like the original (that's not always a bad thing), and while you could tell there was something different, you could also right away identify it as corn bread. My tasters gave it the thumbs up. My one comment is that it was really dense. It didn't have the sponginess and softness of cornbread--almost more dumpling-like, with a pretty doughy texture even when cooked through. That aside, it was still very tasty and enjoyed by many.

Wow, wow, WOW! This is really amazing cornbread! My teenage son has been strictly vegan for a few years and mentioned he'd really missed cornbread, so I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I've tried soooo many vegan recipes for foods that are meant to replicate non-vegan dishes and it's a hit or miss thing if you expect an exact match for taste and texture. This recipe is a home run! I added about 1/3 cup of creamed corn, used a muffin pan, and reduced the cook time to 18 minutes. This was better than the non-vegan cornbread recipes I've tried - and I've tried a lot. The taste was exceptional and the bread was fluffy and a little crumbly, which I love. Definitely sticking with this as my go-to cornbread!

we made this with a slight variation- used equal parts lemon infused olive oil and coconut oil in place of veg oil.  WAS DELICIOUS! We are making again today and adding some zest... makes a super nice lemony coffee cake ish thing.

I made this almost as instructed.  It came out great.  I always appreciate a good vegan swap.  Unfortunately, I didn't have tofu.  I figured the tofu was adding the binding, the moisture, that an egg would have added, so I substituted my favorite egg swap.  I used a heaping tablespoon of ground flax seed, then added warm water until it made 1/4 cup.  I stirred it then microwaved 18 seconds, then stirred it briskly.  It thickened up to be like an egg or like pureed soft tofu so I went ahead with confidence.  I made one other change.  I added a small amount of whole kernel corn (canned, drained) -- about 1/4 to 1/3 cup.  The bread was tasty.  It was less fluffy than I prefer and had less cornmeal, I think, than I prefer.  I will definitely make again (it is that good, and healthier for us) but next time will try a bit more corn meal and a bit less flour.  Also I may try substituting some of the flour with whole wheat flour for health reasons.

Best cornbread. Hands down. I make it all the time and even carnists say it's amazing. I double the sugar, add a tsp. of vanilla, a tsp. of apple cider vinegar,  and use half cornflour and half cornmeal.  I also make a maple "butter" using earth balance and grade B maple to go with it. So good!

This turned out great!  Super simple and no one could tell that it wasn't traditional cornbread.  I made it with rice milk, which is a little thinner and lighter than soy milk, so that may have helped with the consistency.  I would definitely make these again.  The only change I would make is possibly adding a bit more sugar, but that's just because I prefer sweeter corn bread.

We try to eat vegan or vegetarian many nights out of theweek and go completely vegan a couple months out of the year and found we really missed corn bread. I was excited to see this recipe. I never have tofu in house so I subbed in plain applesauce and worked no problem. I have also used an egg when not vegan. We also wanted to make it more wholesome, so I subbed in whole wheat flour for reg flour. Really tasty. I also didnt have soy milk one day so I just used water and worked ut amazing. Also have used rice milk and its a vreat alternative as well.  So by trail and error, we found this recipe, w a few tweaks, really works for us! Its also really flexible for whatever you have in the house.

As other reviewers recommended, I made muffins instead of bread. I also used vanilla soymilk because I couldn't find plain-sweetened at my store. The muffins were delicious, and had just the right density and texture!

I am not vegan but I was out of eggs and so was looking for a recipe sans eggs..... This was absolutely amazing!!!! Def going to make again! I actually did not have any soy on hand so I used regular 2% milk- so wouldn't be vegan recipe anymore, but nonetheless delicious! I also used white sure instead and did not use tofu.

Thanks for this wonderful recipe. I halved it, excluded salt & sugar, and used what I had on hand--sweetened almond milk, olive oil, coconut oil.  I missed the salt, but the cornbread was delicious!

Are you an omnivore invited to a vegan chili dinner? These were a great take-along. Although the consistency is denser than the original, all the flavor is there!

This cornbread is fantastic!  I needed a recipe that was dairy-free, but used an egg in place of the tofu, as I didn't need it to be vegan.  Otherwise, no changes.  I wasn't expecting much, since my usual cornbread is buttermilk-based... and I was very pleasantly surprised!  This may have just replaced my regular recipe!  It was the perfect in-between cornbread for me.  Not as sweet and cakey as Northern-style cornbread, but not as dry and crumbly as Southern cornbread, and with a hint of sweetness that Southern cornbread doesn't have.  Great texture, great flavor, just right on the amount of sugar - I can't say enough good things about it.  A recipe that my dairy-allergic daughter AND other family members can all enjoy gets 5 stars from me for sure!

Subs: apple sauce for tofu, whole wheat pastry flour for all-purpose, coconut oil for the oil. Also added 1 c fresh corn kernels. Baked it in a greased cast iron. DEEELICIOUS!!! All the meat eaters gobbled it up before the vegans could even get to it.

We’re not vegan but had friends over who are.  Used flax seed and water combination to 1/4 cup measure instead of tofu. Vegans asked for recipe referral, we ALL enjoyed.  Made with tofu chili.

I accidentally made a change by forgetting to add the silken tofu, and it was still great!  It fell apart a bit  more easily than cornbread from a box with milk and egg, but my whole family enjoyed this bread!

This was a huge hit with my son who is allergic to dairy. I substituted Pure Maple Syrup for the sugar and Crisco Vegetable Shortening for the tofu. Came out just perfect. Also works well with Robin Hood Gluten Free flour.

Amazing! I made mine into 6 Texas size muffins. I only made slight variations to the recipe. I used organic whole wheat flour and whole grain cornmeal that had a medium grind. I don't by plain soy milk, so I used organic vanilla soy milk instead. I also used organic sugar. Despite the variations, the corn muffins turned out absolutely delicious! They're easy to make too. Can't wait to do it again.

This was the best corn bread I have tried (even compared to non vegan recipes I used to use)! I used almond milk and stirred in about 3/4 cup corn kernals.

I made it and used stevia for the sweetener plus 2Tbsp of maple syrup. I also added coconut oil instead of Cisco. It was awesome. My son the chef couldn't taste the difference.

I loved the taste of these.  And I thought the texture was nice too.  I didn't find them overly sweet at all.  For those who find them a bit on the dry side have them with some salt free margarine.   I've made them a few times now because they are so simple and so tasty.

Not only does this cornbread taste great, but it is super easy to make.  The texture is dense and the favor is excellent. It doesn't taste like anything thing other than cornbread. The sweetness is just right and not overpowering. I used coconut sugar because I did not have Turbinado sugar on hand.

This is the best cornbread! I made it has muffins for thanksgiving. So good! However if your making it has muffins watch how long you put them in for.
