Instead of straining off the liquid (and onion sugars), just cook with the lid off on high, stirring occasionally. I made these to go with some collards (which needed that extra sweetness from the onion to counter the bitterness of the greens). Worked beautifully!

So easy! I put them into the slow cooker the evening before and let them cook all night. The house did really smell in the morning and for a long time afterwards, but if you put out a bowl of vinegar on your counter it quickly absorbs the residual smell. I used regular yellow cooking onions and didn't add any sugar, which worked great! I have made this a few times and I prefer to make large batches and then freeze them in a few different portion sizes for later use. I don't plan to ever go back to the stove top method!

3.5.19  Used the slow cook feature on my 6-quart Instant Pot®, and the uncooked sliced onions just about filled the pot.  They cooked on “less” for about 16 hours.  I then used the “saute normal” feature on the pot, and cooked down some of the onion liquid, but did reserve some for today’s dinner, French Dip sandwiches.  In a word, these onions are DEEE-LICIOUS!  Last night, used them on a grilled cheese and bacon sandwich, and over the weekend, they’ll be heading into some French onion soup. I scooped the caramelized onions into the cups of a muffin tin lined with paper cupcake liners, and then put them in the freezer.   When they were frozen, I removed them the muffin tin, and transferred them to a gallon-size zip-lock bag.  Caramelized onions add such incredible flavor and sweetness to so many dishes, but they do take some time  to caramelize, often time you don't have for a weekday dinner.  It is so convenient to already have them on hand, and they can be quickly defrosted in the microwave.  If you have a food processor for slicing, this is so very, very  simple to make;  you just have to allow the slow cooker enough time to work its magic!

This was the easiest way to make carmelized onions I've ever tried. The up side was that they were perfect and tasted fantastic. The down side is that it takes 10 - 14 hours to completely carmelize the onions using the slow cooker. If done for 10 hours, there is a lot of liquid to be drained off for use in another dish (French Onion soup maybe?). If cooked  for the additional 4 hours with lid slightly off set, the liquid evaporates and the onions become a deeper caramel color. If you don't need them right away, this is the way to go as they can be frozen; otherwise they'll need to be done in the skillet which is definitely quicker but much more labor intensive.

I made this and the only thing is, I did it overnight and so the edges of the slow cooker got sort of black.  Other than that, the onions were wonderful.  I would do it again but during the day so they can be stirred once in a while.  I really wasn't upset with the odor of the onions, it wasn't that bad.  Next time I would double the amount of onions.  Might as well make a big batch.  Nice that there is no sugar added. Just the sweetness of the onions.

I loved the smell of the onions...I added thyme and a bay leaf to 3 large sweet onions and 3 small yellow onions. I shouldn't have added a tsp of sugar as it wasn't needed.
they cooked down and caramelized wonderfully. I will always do this if I have the time. so easy to set and go.

Onions turned out great.  Doubled the recipe and used my bigger pot on low for 10 hours.  Cooked outside on deck so house wouldn't get smelly.

Great and easy to make. I used them in the slow cooker french onion soup recipe on this site.  Started the evening before hitting the sack and in the a.m. added the rest for the soup.
I would suggest adding a little sugar depending on the type of onions you use. Mine were the ordinary yellow onions

Wow, love this method.  Just slice and throw in slow cooker with butter.  I started checking them around 8 hours because I couldn't believe it could take so long, but 10 hours later and they were perfect -- a slight crunch.  If you're not going to use them right away, you want a little crunch because they will cook a little more when you reheat them.  If they are mushy, as one reviewer complained, then you likely overcooked them. Every crock pot's settings are different.  I have two crock pots, and low on one of them is medium on another.  My daughter recommended adding a little white wine, which I may try next time.

filled my 5 quart cooker with home grown onions and they were delicious!  Put them over a roast beef, on a sandwich (heated them in microwave for 30 seconds) and plan on freezing the rest for other things

Made to serve with country steak  and cubed roasted potatoes at church weekly community café.  Was a hit with all partakers.  Used onions in ring form. Will probably quarter slice the onions next  time.  Gave it a four rating

The onions taste great, but I won't make them again. My hoiuse smells like onions. It took almost 16 hours of cooking on low for them to get to the caramelized stage. This does make a lot of onions though and they do taste great.

This is a good method, but I HIGHLY recommend plugging in your crockpot outdoors if your climate allows .  I do mine on a patio table.  The smell of cooking onions is way too much to take after a couple of hours.

I made this on the stovetop. Cooked my onions in olive oil and butter combo on medium/high for 10 minutes then added the salt and lowered temp to medium for 40 minutes. Only stirring once every 10/15 minutes. Came out great.

I used a bit less butter and the recipe still came out great. I put the slow cooker out on the back porch, so no onion aroma to overwhelm the inside of the house.  I used the broth that was created as a base for a superb chicken soup.  So far I have added the caramelized onions to mashed potatoes, chicken cacciatore, breakfast omelets to name  a few uses.  I also froze small batches for quick recipe add ins  on busy days when I am short on time .
