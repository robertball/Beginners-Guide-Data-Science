This is fabulous!! I made a double batch the first time, which as good because it went really fast. No suggestions to make it better, other than making a lot of it!

Loved it! Even my husband and daughter who don't like cranberries want me to make it again.

The store I went to didn’t have any red Chile peppers so I used jalapeño instead. This is a big hit with my family and a great recipe. One I’ll make over and over.

I love this. It is nice to make cranberries that aren't loaded with added sugar like my usual Thanksgiving Cranberry sauce. This is nice and fresh and raw too. It reminds me of the cranberry salsa I used to be able to get on grilled fish tacos in fall at my favorite taco shop.  I can't say the cranberry flavor is strong. It is just all around delicious similar to other sweet fruit salsas you may have had with the sweet element contrasted with cilantro and red onion. My mom commented that it was 'sweet' and my cranberry hating sister said she loved it. I served it with Fritos Scoops as an appetizer before thanksgiving dinner this year. It was a hit and very festive!

I used jalapeño bc I didn't have time to reconstitute dried peppers.
