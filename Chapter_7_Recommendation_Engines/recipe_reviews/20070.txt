These were great but i did make a few modifications.  I only had all purpose flour. I brushed them wth melted butter before baking. To make butermilk, add 1T vinegar to a measuring cup ten fill with milk and let sit for 5 minutes.    Literally only take 10 minutes to bake! The kids were begging for a snack but I really wanted to make them something different and these were PERFECT!

It was a fast, easy success! I loved how the instructions didn't require a bread machine. 

PS- It works perfectly fine if you use all purpose flour for wheat and Karo Corn Syrup for honey.

These are pretty good--a nice wheat pretzel!  I've been on a pretzel kick lately, & I've always made yeast pretzels, so I thought I'd give this one a shot.  A little sweet, and yes, it's dense and heavier than yeast pretzels, but I expected that.  One:  it has ww flour in it, and two:  although baking soda will allow it to rise, any dough made with yeast is lighter in my experience.  I used vanilla rice milk (all I had) with a bit of lemon juice instead of the buttermilk.  I intended to make 12 pretzels but instead cut out 9 pieces of dough--don't ask me how I managed that piece of wisdom!  At any rate, for the reviewers who expect huge pretzels like the mall, don't be fooled by pretzels you make at home.  They are never that big!  You'd have to make 1 pretzel for every 4-6 pieces of dough!  Also, there's no need to use as much water or baking soda as called for in the boiling here.  I use a large skillet and just fill about 1/2 way with water, then toss in some baking soda--it works out for me, and you can boil several pretzels at a time that way.  You really just want a baking soda bath--as long as water and baking soda are present, you're fine.  These are really good with the Clone of a Pretzel Dip, also on this site.  Thanks for the recipe!

The directions are little unclear as to what to do with the water and soda at first.  Once you get over the slight confusion it is a wonderful recipe.  I made it with my kindergarten class and they loved it.

I have made multiple pretzel recipes from this site and I always have the same complaint no matter how they taste: They never make a pretzel the same size as the ones you can buy at the mall! I cut this recipe in half because I was making them just for me and I didn't need 12 pretzels. I didn't even get them as big as regular mall pretzels and it only made 2!! So if you are thinking that these will come out making 12 pretzels that are the size of 12 auntie anne's pretzels, you will be disappointed. However, this is true for every pretzel recipe I've ever made. If you actually make them the size they are supposed to be, you will get 12 little pretzels the size of your palm at best. ANYWAY, what I have determined is that no matter what pretzel you try, they always taste the most authentic if they have the baking soda bath. However, you do NOT need so MUCH!! There is always all this baking soda water left over. Cut the amount of soda bath in half at least, if not just a quarter. uncooked dough doesn't soak it up much. Also, this dough is not hard to work with at all, as some people stated. If you brush them with butter half way through baking for a buttery taste. These are OK and will do in a pinch but the yeast ones are more authentic tasting. Find a yeast recipe with a soda bath and you're golden. And bake them on parchment to eliminate sticking to the pan. To compare to something store bought, these are most like SuperPretzel that you can get in the grocery freezer section.

Delicious and FAST! I didn't have buttermilk and so I used milk mixed with some vinegar instead. I also used Karo syrup instead of honey. After kneading the dough on my kitchen aid, I formed pretzel sticks. I brushed with milk, sprinkled some with grated parmesan an some with ground pepper before baking. The sticks were delicious! Crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. I did not boil them before I baked them but they turned out fine. These were quick and tasty. Would definitely make again.

I really loved this recipe! I used only whole wheat flour and like others did some substitutions for the buttermilk and honey. I was able to use the dough to create some other amazing breads too-one that I filled with salmon and topped with a nori seaweed strip and another that was filled with curry and covered with bread crumbs on the outside. I'm looking forward to creating even more things with this and sharing them with friends and family.

For a soda pretzel, it is very good.  My daughter made them several times.  She got blue honor ribbons at the county and state 4-H fair with this recipe.  We used sea salt as the topping.  The wheat flour gives it a golden color all throughout.

I was dying for soft pretzels and had no yeast when I found this recipe. It makes a nice pretzel, a little heavy.  I might try some yeast recipes later to compare.  If you have a craving, try it.

I liked this recipe. I used it in a kindergarten class , scaled to 1 serving, so that each child could make a soda pretzel and a yeast pretzel. A lot of the children liked the soda pretzel better. It is a bit heavier as other reviewers have said, but tastes really good.

My daughter and I made this for a little snow day fun.  They are easy and yummy.  We didn't have wheat flour or buttermilk so I had to substitute since a trip to the store wasn't an option.  I thought they still great.   We out some of them around hot dogs that we cut in half to see how they would turn out and they were delicious!

I was looking for a recipe that didn't involve yeast. Even though I was hesitant, these were actually really good! I only got 1 before my dad finished the rest, and he's pretty hard to please. I'll keep this recipe.

We enjoyed these. A quick fix when you're craving soft pretzels! The baking soda/water mixture is WAY to much, and I even halved it to start with.  I used sour cream instead of buttermilk, and it worked great.

Great recipe!  I was looking for a pretzel recipe that didn't call for yeast, as I didn't have any, so this worked out splendidly!  Also, I didn't have buttermilk so I put 1Tbs lemon juice in the 1c of milk and let it sit while I was boiling and sifting, and it worked just fine!  Thanks!

I gave this a three because I actually liked the taste and the fact that these were a healthy alternative to "mall pretzels." That being said, here are my negatives: my kids didn't like them, they stuck so badly to the cookie sheet that I had to scrape them off vigorously and lost the bottoms, the dough wasn't the easiest to work with. I probably would not make these pretzels again--but I would eat them if someone else made them! Thanks for the recipe.

I subbed vanilla soy milk for the buttermilk and corn syrup for the honey, because that is what I had on hand. After rolling them, I twisted them around hotdogs and baked them, and they were a huge hit with the hubby and kids.  I made two without the hotdogs and they were a little drier but not over dry, and you could tell they were wheat.  All in all, an easy, great recipe.

I give them 4.5 stars for being so darn easy!!! They were a hit at an Oktoberfest party we went to last weekend.  I served them with the Cheese-Beer dip from another recipe, and got lots of raves, which surprised me a little because I was worried they'd be tough withought any yeast! Not so!

I honestly really wanted to like these, being healthier than your typical big, soft pretzel.  But these are very dense, very heavy pretzels.  On the plus side, these are much quicker to make than your typical yeast pretzel.  Adding some dipping mustard did make these a little better, but they just weren't great.

Fantastic pretzels for the speed of preparation! My girls made these with their cousin this afternoon. These taste great with cinnamon sugar or salt. Used white whole wheat flour along with all-purpose. Texture was not that heavy; I think the trick is not to overknead, also to let sit a few minutes before putting into the oven (to naturally rise a little).

I LOVE soft pretzels, but I can't always drive/walk/bike to a pretzel place, so I tried this recipe. These did the job! The best part about them; they are really easy and fast to make. Delicious! I highly recommend these when you have a craving.

Well I just took my first batch out of the oven have to say I'm very disappointed.  I did read the other reviews, and some had said the taste gets better after sitting.  I hope so - or my dogs will get these for treats.

Awesome recipe when the kids are dying to making pretzels and there's no yeast in the house.  Had no buttermilk either so substituted plain yogurt.  Awesome.  Kids thought it was a little heavy on the wheat flour so I might switch the wheat/white ratio next time.  Very, very good though as is in my opinion!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE. I read the other reviews and was skeptical but I had a craving at 2am that I could not ignore. I searched for a no yeast recipe since i dont have any and while i live in NYC, finding yeast at 2am is a task. I did whisk the buttermilk and my recipe was for 4 so I did 3/4 white flour and 1/4 unbleached whole wheat, I also added unsalted butter and coarse kosher salt after i took them out of the oven. Cooked in 5 minutes and was BETTER than the yeast recipe. Im making more at a reasonable hour.

My whole family really likes these pretzels. They are a great healthy snack. I first made them for my husband for a snack at work but the kids liked them too.

I initially disliked the taste of these pretzels, which reminded me more of bread than pretzels. After a few days, however, the honey taste came through-and they taste great!

I used 3 cups 100% whole wheat flour, instead of the split all-purpose and wheat.  Flour rose just fine, and tasted great.  I did have a little trouble getting the salt to stick. Next time I may try putting salt on the tray first and place the dough on top of the salt while they rise. Then flip them over before baking.

Even though I was expecting these to be dense, I was not expecting the little pretzel shaped bricks .

However, I did butcher the recipe and used all-purpose flour only, milk/vinegar in place of buttermilk, and corn syrup instead of honey. The dough was runny and I had to add a ton of extra flou .

By the end they did smell okay, and tasted almost like pretzels... So there's that.

Not really very pretzelly, but still good. I had a hard time shaping the dough but the result was delicious.

I made them without the salt or the soda soak and they are delicious! Melt a little bit of butter on top and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar for a great sweet treat.

I saw the mustard in my fridge and knew I needed some instant pretzel gratification. This recipe is very quick and works well. I easily veganized them using apple cider vinegar and almond milk in place of the buttermilk and replacing the honey with agave nectar. While they're obviously not the same as soft pretzels made with yeast, they are very good (and so much faster when you really want a pretzel) and I will certainly get a lot of use out of this recipe.

These are Delicious! And fast too! Its okay to use all purpose flour instead of whole wheat. I suggest when making it with whole wheat flour, you should add a little more honey to it to give it a little more flavor or else it just ends up  with a plain taste. You don't need to add extra honey if you're using all purpose flour. Also, I just made the buttermilk with vinegar and milk. Overall, it tasted great.

I wasn't super impressed with this recipe.  They tasted ok, but not really like pretzals, just tasted like a biscuit to me.  I could have tried making mine a bit smaller and I might have had more success.

A sweet/savoury kind of pretzel that cooks well without yeast. Perhaps too sweet to meet expectations, I'd suggest experimenting with egg. Kneading dough next to a pot of boiling water was sweltering and was the worst part of preparation.

I made the recipe as is except for making pretzel bites instead of whole pretzels. These were tasty, but more like bread than a pretzel. I will keep looking for another recipe.

Love this simple recipe. We make these every Lent. With kids, it's nice to have this recipe that is fast and doesn't need yeast. I'm also of Irish heritage so lots to talk about between tradition of pretzels for lent and cooking with soda from Ireland. Very tasty! Need to use the soda water when it's fresh. Very straightforward recipe. Nothing to alter. Super tasty with some mustard. I've had to start doubling the batch because my family (4 kids under 14) eats them all up fast.

Delicious! I almost never have yeast in the house, but was dying for a pretzel. I only had all purpose flour and these still came out even better than the ones at the mall! Thank you so much for sharing.

These came out better than I thought they would. Very simple to make, and quick. My dough was a little loose (could be from the humidity here) so I had to add some extra flour. I easily made these dairy-free by subbing soy milk + lemon juice for the buttermilk. The family enjoyed them, I'd make them again when the craving strikes!

Taste was good but dough was odd. Did not want to pull together. Very very firm and would not roll out to save my life. I just cut it into sticks and baked it. Should have added some salt to the dough

Made these with my 8 year old cousin. Super easy and she had a blast! We only used all-purpose flour and had to add a little extra milk because the mix was a tad dry. Although I think it was because she added a little extra flour...but she measured everything out herself which made me so proud! They came out wonderful and looked amazing! So excited to teach her cooking skills :) Thank you so much for sharing a quick, non-yeast recipe!

Great recipe! I beat 1 egg for an egg wash and brushed it on the pretzels before baking, and halfway through brushed with melted butter then sprinkled with salt. Resulted in a beautiful batch of browned pretzels and tasted great.

I was kind of surprised that the pretzels turned out pretty small, but I really liked the texture.  I replaced the buttermilk with 1 3/4 tsp of cream of tartar mixed with 1 cup of skim milk. I used some salt on nine of the pretzels, and cinnamon and Truvia on the remaining three.  While both were good, I really liked the cinnamon and Truvia ones - they tasted almost like cinnamon rolls to me!  I didn't think they tasted like pretzels you'd get at the mall, but they were definitely delicious!

I must have done something wrong with this recipe because these did not taste good at all. They have a very strong bitter after taste and they taste too much like baking soda. The dough itself is very bland. The only thing I changed was soy milk for buttermilk. Everything else I followed to the dot.

These were so-so, no real pretzel taste.
