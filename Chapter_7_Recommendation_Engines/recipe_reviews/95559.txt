AWESOME!!!  Made a few adjustments based on preference and what I had in my spice cabinet... VERY forgiving :) Instead of ancho chile powder (only had regular), I put a large whole dried ancho chile, used fresh rosemary, cut nutmeg and allspice to 1 TS (instead of 1 TB) each and added 1 TS corriander... Not sure why thyme's listed twice...? I just put the 1st amt since too much thyme can be overpowering, maybe the 2nd was supposed to say oregano??? Anyhow, just skipped that part... everything else according to recipe. Blended it all in the food processor til it was even, makes A LOT!  I only used 1/2 of it on a full rack of ribs; peeled membrane, soaked 30 mins in apple cider vinegar + worcestershire + splash of liquid smoke (DO THIS! makes ribs super tender and juicy!), then patted dry and rubbed GENEROUSLY. Wrapped in foil, only marinated 4 hours, will do overnight next time! Baked them at 200 for 2 hours (meaty side down!), removed from foil and finished off on the grill with a bourbon molasses glaze and it was SO GOOD!!!  LOVE the herbiness of the rosemary & thyme with the sweet of the sugars and glaze... GREAT alternative to standard BBQ ribs. Thanks CC Ryder!!!

Excellent. Wonderful flavour, and now the only rub we use! I haven't used a smoker, but it works well cooked slowly in the oven covered with foil, and adding a touch of liquid smoke.

Impressive mixture of flavours, this one hits all the right notes. I will caution any newbie 'rub'-ers out there: 

1) Using table salt is a no-no - the coarse salt used in the recipe should be measured. Substituting the same amount of fine table salt will leave you with an unpleasantly salty rub.

2) If you are not smoking, then as a bare minimum, slow cook for at least 4 hours with this rub. I tried the first batch for 3 hours in a slow oven and the pepper was still overwhelming. Another hour and the heat seemed to 'melt' into the other flavours. 

3) Another good reason to go slow (4+ hours) with this rub is it will force you go 'low' in terms of temperature. This rub has a lot of sugar and will burn at higher temperatures.

As an inexperienced bbq'r from up north, i gotta say this recipe got me rave reviews. It was well worth fiddling with the timing to get a smokerless version that worked in my slow-cooker/oven. 

God Bless America.

Oh Yeah, this is THE rub! Make sure you mortar and pestle it before using to crush some of the spices and make them refreshed! AND ya gotta remove the membrane on the back of the babybacks or the flavor won't get to the back of the rib. I use a needle-nose pliers (clean well before and after!). I wash the ribs, and dry them well before applying rub, cover with saran wrap and let sit in the frig for 24-48 hours before smoking. Take a gander at my finished photo. Beautiful! I use a great dipping sauce made from Trader Joe's Sweet and Smoky Sauce, Frank's Red Hot Sauce and Cholula Chipotle Hot Sauce; each guest gets a warmed bowl of sauce to dip as needed, but sauce is NOT necessary! We smoked the ribs for about 4.5 hours, we do not like it to fall off the bone, but be more firm. You can also use this rub for a full pork tenderloin and smoke it...YUMMY!

Used this on smoked brisquette and it came out succulent and incredibly tasty, the family loved it.  Also used it on grilled chicken breasts and they were some of the tenderest, most flavorful grilled chicken I've ever had.  We left off the various peppers for a sweeter taste, but are looking forward to a spicier version next time.

wow.  what a great 4th anniversary meal.
i cooked them in the slow cooker for 4 hours and then transferred the ribs to the barbeque, using the juice to baste them with.
served with coconut rice, grilled mushrooms and sauteed green beans:it made my husband very happy!

I have to admit: nutmeg and allspice in a rid rub made me skeptical of the whole thing. I keep trying different rubs on my back ribs and enjoy my ribs without sauce. Rub only with that perfect caramelized layer on top of the most tender meat. I have never written a review before and registered only to do so for this rub. My search is over. Best rub ever, I intend to find the specialized powders for the next batch. Could it possibly get better?

This was a good rub and doesn't have to be exact when measured. But the nutmeg I will leave out next time, just had an aftertaste that didn't sit well with ribs....Omit the nutmeg and you will really enjoy this

o my GOODNESS!!!!  I cannot find enough words to sing the praises of this rib rub but let me try...I live in KC-the BBQ mecca of the nation-this is by far the best rub I've tried to date.  It will replace my Oklahoma Joe's rib rub from now on.
Thank you CCRyder

This is my "go to" rub! I even keep it made up in my refrigerator.  Usually rub down my baby back ribs and let them sit in refer overnight.  I bake (tightly covered with foil) on a rack at 300 degrees for 2-2-1/2 hours.  After cooling I grill using your favorite BBQ sauce. Meat falls off the bones - these are the best!

The chili and cumin added a taste we didn't care for and it was very dominant.  If to use again would not add these ingredients for our taste preferences.

I've used this rub several times now on smoked pork butt roasts, and smoked whole chickens. It's important to rub the meat generously with this blend the night before as the directions say. For chicken or turkey rub the inside as well. I think every ingredient is a perfect match for pork and poultry. I've smoked the butts for as long as 17 hours @250 °F, and chickens for 7 hours on average with no problems of burning or bitterness. I appreciate that CCRyder81 shared this great recipe with us…thank you.

I typically prefer savory over sweet when it comes to smoking meats but thought I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did.  I used this recipe serving ribs for a party of 10.  There was enough rub to adequately cover 4 full racks of spare ribs with the tips still on.  Since it was a large party, I only used the black pepper and the chili powder.  I left out the ancho and the cayenne and found the heat to be perfect.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I smoked them indirect at 220 degrees on my big green egg for 8 hours and they were absolutely amazing.  Hands down the best ribs I've ever eaten and I've eaten a lot of em.

This is my "go to" rub for all pork I smoke - ribs, butt and shoulder.  Rub the meat, wrap in plastic and put into the refrigerator overnight.  Smoke the next day and you'll have great tasting meat.

even though I was not able to find some of the more exotic ingredients (hungarian paprika and the special chile powders), I substituted reggula paprika and chile powder and it was tasty.  Also halved the sugars.

This was super delish, I only let it sit on the ribs for about an hour, then threw them covered with foil on 280 for 90 minutes then tossed them on the BBQ to finish then off.  This would also be great on tri tip.***update, I made this recipe times 4 and stored it, put it on all meat it is delish!

Wow! This rub was so delicious. My ribs came out tender, flavorful, with that awesome "crust" that comes from the mixing of the fat and sugars. I used baby back ribs. Rubbed generously and let sit for an hour. I slow-roasted in the oven at 250 for almost 3 hours, then tossed them on the grill 4 minutes each side. The slow-roast portion was strictly because I was going to a friend's house for a bbq and didn't want to monopolize the grill. As it turns out, this is a fantastic way to ensure tender fall-off-the-bones ribs!

Tried this past weekend. It was very good, but I think that the sugars may have lead to a faint burnt flavor in the ribs. I'm not really complaining as between 3 people 2 whole racks of ribs were devoured. I smoked mine for 2 hours with indirect heat and hickory wood chips soaked in half beer half water and glazed them the last 20 minutes.

Loved the flavors of nutmeg, allspice, and all the rest.  Delicious!  After the ribs were in our smoker for a couple hours I started brushing on a mixture of 1 cup apple cider, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup BBQ sauce.

Great Recipe, a little on the spicy side for some of my guests. Slow cooked ribs in smoker (hickory chips) for 3hrs at 250F.  Marinated over night.  Substituted New Mexico pepper and ancho pepper with a medium hot chili mix and chilpolte.

This recipe was great!  I prepared the rub the day before to allow the ribs to sit in the fridge overnight.  They came out zesty and flavorful with a little sweetness. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Well...I can die now! I followed this rub recipe to the letter and the babybacks I smoked came out beautiful. Spicy (but not too hot), sweet, and very flavorful. The ingredients seem to compliment each other. Very well done!!! 
I read somewhere that "CCRyder81" has a BBQ sauce recipe that goes well with this rub but I can't find it anywhere. So if you're reading this CCRyder81, I am VERY interested in your BBQ Sauce recipe! PLEASE POST IT! :)

My husband said and I quote "This is literally the best meat I have ever tasted" He is not easy with the compliments either - he said he would eat this every day.  I used it on St Louis Ribs and cooked them on my gas grill.  So amazing.

We have tried several different rubs, both home made and commercial. I haven't been impressed with any of them until this rub. All I can say is WOW!!! The balance between sweet, smoky and spice is perfect! There is a depth of flavor that I just love. We didn't have the ancho pepper so we just had to leave it out. We also smeared the pork shoulder with mustard and then applied the rub all over. The mustard helps the rub stick to the pork. We then only smoked the meat with the wood chips for half the time it was in the smoker and then finished cooking it without the smoke, and we also sprayed Apple cider on the meat every 45 minutes. All I can say is AWESOME!!!

All the ingredients are readily available at your local supermarket, but the flavor is immense.  I followed the recipe exactly to get a baseline and find no reason to change anything.  Letting the rubbed ribs sit in the fridge overnight really let's all the flavors meld nicely.

I just made ribs today with this rub and they were amazing! It was my first time smoking ribs and I'm still new to using the smoker but it was perfect.  I rubbed the ribs, refigerated for about 4 hrs, let them come to room temp before putting them in smoker.  Smoked at 330 F for 3 hrs then wrapped in foil and cooked another hour then let them sit in the foil for 10 mins or so before opening them.  I don't know if it did anything but I added a bit of raspberry vinegar to the pan of water in the smoker since I've read to use apple cider vinegar to tenderize and didn't have any.  Thanks for this rub recipe.  I will be using it again and again.

This recipe made quite a bit of rub, I have used this on ribs, chicken breast, and a whole chicken.  The mix of flavors is great!  Another reviewer was spot on about using much less regular salt if you don't have sea salt.  I used 1/4 cup table salt, but next time I make this I will most likely only use 2-3 tablespoons.  If you are basting the meat with prepared BBQ sauce near the end, this will add even more salt.  I thought the heat was just right, spicy but definitely not too hot.  On another note, I did not have allspice or nutmeg.  Based on substitutions I found on the internet, I used 1/2 Tbsp Ginger and 1/2 Tbsp Cinnamon.  I thought it turned out great!

Delicious! My husband and I have tried several different rib rubs. This has got to be the best! He asks for it often. We typically bake the ribs for a little while and then finish them on the grill. However now that the hot weather is here I think we're going t smoke a rack. Thanks a ton!

This was fantastic. We cut the recipe in half for a full rack of ribs. I didn't have ancho chili powder so that was omitted. Also reduced nutmeg and allspice to 1/2 teaspoon and cayenne pepper to 1/4 teaspoon. Our ribs were so good and had the perfect amount of spice.

WOW! OMG! WOW!  No other words to describe it! WOOOW!!! Hands up  and surrender to the taste of this mix!  Give up all your searches because you've surely found THE ONE !
I'm a pretty experienced griller, but I did never smoked before the last weekend when I've used for the first time my new water smoker. I was really worried about anything from the timing and the temperature control, the rub to use on my pork ribs. I gone for this one because of the reviews... and it was one of the best choices I've ever taken. THANKS!!!
I've changed a little the mix according to my taste: I've used a fourth of the chili powder, halved the salt, cumin and the thyme and I've skipped ancho chile because I couldn't find it on time.
Literally immersed the ribs into the rub, pat them a little then foiled with plastic for food (dun't remember the name in english) and put in the fridge the while night.
I've cooked the ribs for about 5 hours at 110/120 °Celsius... inside the water smoker where I've put beer and apple juice with the water and used hickory wood chips, previously soaked with some whisky, for the smoke.
As bbq sauce I've used my own recipe.
How did it go? Well 15 pounds of ribs for 20 people, got brushed away within few minutes!!!!!
Finger liking for real! I could have done more without worries! ahahaha
Thank you again, you made my first bbq smoking experience the best ever.

Great homemade rub recipe.  I always make a batch of this and keep it in pantry in a Mason Jar for ready to use on all sorts of grilling.  Very nice taste...It usually takes me 2 days to prepare my ribs...I usually start by removing the membrane from the rib.  The first day I put the ribs in a Ziploc Bag with either jalapeno juice and/or pickle juice (I always keep the juices from these two items on purpose or buy one and just use the juice from it) Let marinade overnight...the next day I take them from the bag and lay them on Seran Wrap and heavily season using this rub on both sides.  Wrap them up good and put them on a cookie sheet and let them marinade overnight.  The next day I am ready to smoke some bad boy ribs.  PeRfEcTo

We tried this first on ribeye steaks and thought it was only okay for that, but then put it on pork ribs, and it was an awesome combination. But I actually came to write this to let people know that this makes an AMAZING seasoning for popcorn! With melted butter it tastes a lot like BBQ potato chips, but with popcorn. Super popular at our party!

"I said see, C.C. Rider. Oh, see, what you have done!!" I'm gonna' be smoking ribs until the end of my days 'cause of you! ^_^ This rub is fantastic. I didn't have the specific chile's the recipe called for so substituted with chili powder and reduced other ingredients accordingly. The nutmeg and allspice gives a depth of flavor that's missing from other rubs. WARNING ON THE SALT: Must use sea salt. If you substitute with table salt, it will be too salty. I didn't have sea salt and used pink Himalayan salt and reduced the amount by 1/3. Excellent rub which had all 6 of my guests proclaiming Best Ribs Ever! Thanks, CC Ryder!

My go-to rib rub. Always get compliments. Rub the ribs, let sit in fridge for 4 hours or more wrapped in foil. Bake at 225 degrees for 2-2.25 hours, then remove from foil and finish with some sauce on the grill for the char.

A little too spicy but the ribs were amazing after marinating overnight. Also used the rub for shrimp kabobs just before grilling and they were also amazing. Will use less chili powder & cayenne pepper next time.

I had just gotten a smoker two years ago and was looking for a rub recipe to make from scratch for my first batch of spare ribs. I didn't change a thing. I did question the nutmeg.  (Nutmeg really? I've had it in my coffee but never my food.) Anyways the ribs were Amazing. I've since used this rub for chicken it was Awesome. (Just make sure on a whole chicken because on chicken parts it way over powering.) Brisket was unbelievable. I think the best I've ever had.  I've tried other rubs but keep coming back to this one.  Try it an you'll see why.

Found this looking for a good rub for Memorial Day cookout. It was a hit. I made 2 batches and omitted the salt on the second batch and then combined both batches. It was AMAZING!!!! Some of my group said it was spicy, but they couldn't quit eating it. It covered 3 racks of ribs and a Chuck roast and I had a enough left over to put in a mason jar for the next cook out. I let them sit over night in the fridge before cooking. Thank you for this awesome rub!!!

Fantastic! Made baby backs and St Louis ribs twice now, in our Big Green Egg (see photo) with a few chunks of apple wood for smoke - 2-2-1 for the baby backs and 3-2-1 for the St Louis ribs. Followed the recipe as written and scaled it to fill a nice size jar. I rubbed yellow mustard on the ribs so the rub would adhere well, generously seasoned the ribs with this rub then let them sit in the fridge all night. Really great, complex, and balanced flavor. Happy to have found this rub. This one is so perfect, I'm not even going to look for another one. Thanks!

I use this recipe all the time just as written. It rocks the socks. Ground Rosemary works best and is one of the more important ingredients.

Very good for ribs and chicken...also found another use for the rub: barbecue sauce. I mix a couple of tbsp of the rub with a squeeze of ketchup, a bit of brown sugar and a splash of cider vinegar to make a sauce.

I used this rub but had to omit a couple things. First I could not find and Ancho powder so I just left it out. I HATE cumin so I left that out as well. I could not find HUNGARIAN paprika so I just use what my wife had. This was the best of 4 rubs I tried that day. I love this rub and recomend it to any and everybody!

The flavor is fabulous, although I did find it extremely salty.  I made a second batch and omitted the salt and then combined the two to cut it in half.  Just as delicious!
