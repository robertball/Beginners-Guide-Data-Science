It was tasty enough and easy to put together. My biggest issue was that it took longer to cook than 15 minutes. I had to microwave the vegetables after 15 minutes because the rest of the supper was done. I recommend allowing 20-30 minutes for cooking on the grill. I would also cut back on the lemon next time.

Didn't use the tomatoes because by the time I cut everything else up, there was way more veggies than hubby and I would ever eat.  Otherwise made exactly as directed and served beside Chef John's BBQ Chicken.  Really good.  I'll scale it back next time because we ended up tossing quite a bit. Makes enough for at least 6 servings.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. I think next time I'll omit the tomatoes and add some acid, probably a red wine or Balsamic vinegar.

We loved this.. picky kids not so much. Will make again. I did get someone to eat squash using this recipe so I guess overall it was a winner.  nice change from our basic bbq side dishes.

I actually made this in the oven thanks to some finicky  Tennessee weather the day we were scheduled to grill out but they were fantastic!  I let the vegetables marinate for most of the afternoon and added some of my own fresh herbs from the garden (mostly parsley and basil.)  I used a yellow bell instead of red since that's what I had on hand but the beauty of this one is that you can use whatever veggies you want!  Plus, you can put these together ahead of time if you're cooking for several people and have one thing marked off your to-do list.  I can see how this method would be beneficial on the grill as you can cook your veggies easily without having to worry with skewers, also.  Super easy recipe for summer on the grill or you can utilize the oven in the winter (or during torrential downpours on the 4th of July...whoops!)
