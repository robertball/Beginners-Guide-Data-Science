4.27.17   This is not your Mama’s chili, and definitely is “outside the box.”  It may not be for everybody, but it was a hit in this house.  I like the combination of ground beef and pork for chili meat, but the thing that really makes it unique is the spice blend.  Be bold, give it a try, and you just might find out that you’ll enjoy it as much as we did.  So glad I tried this recipe, it will be made again!

Hey everybody!  I'm so happy to see this recipe published, this is my signature chili, I've been making it for many years.  Happy to share with you.  Couple if things, if you don't like the taste of cloves, move on.  If you don't like a pop of sweetness, move on.  Like most chillis this tastes best made a day ahead, but don't hesitate to make the day of, still great.  Freezes really well.  I like to do leftovers served on spaghetti, topped with shredded cheddar, Cincinnati style.  Don't be afraid of the almonds, they add a nice texture to this, and the raisin/olive mix gives it a great sweet salty taste. I’m not a huge fan of beans, so I developed this for only one can, but feel free to add another can of black beans.  Garbanzos would work, too, if you want more beanies and a little more fiber.  Hope you enjoy!  Saveur

This won first place at my church's chili cookoff! I did it in the Instant pot - 25 minutes high pressure, then slow cook low for rest of the day with the olives and almonds.
