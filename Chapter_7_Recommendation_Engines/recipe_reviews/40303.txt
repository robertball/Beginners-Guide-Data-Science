Oh so good, strong but no harsh liquor flavor.  I am serving this at my holiday cookie exchange this year and I expect to have to use some designated drivers. A little drink packs a wallop, be careful!

I give a 4 star as is, but a 5 star with this change.  My sister made these but with sugar free cranberry flavored drink like crystal light instead of orange juice and the grenadine.  Fantastic!

So yummy, not a big sweet and sour fan so we put in some pineapple juice/sunny delight instead. Made a big pitcher of it for a hawiaan BBQ party.

To dmg, try a splash of lime to cut the sweetness, OR just squeeze the lime garnish into your glass.

Use just a splash of sour mix; add a little pineapple juice and you have 5 stars

This recipe tastes great.  I highly recommend it.  However, it is very sweet.  Does anyone know of something that I can add that would reduce the sweetness, but still make it taste great.  Watch out! This drink will knock your socks off before you realize it.

Substitute the rum with Malibu pineapple rum and add .5 ounce Chambord. Shake vigorously and pour into glass. Great summertime "yard work" drink
