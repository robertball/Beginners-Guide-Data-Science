I cooked this dish for the first time and served it to 8 people at a luncheon recently.  It was fabulous.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I changed the recipe somewhat.  I used 3/4 cup of butter instead of 1 cup, but I think it could be cut back even more.  Also, I added more onion than called for and I sauteed the onion and celery a little to release their flavors before adding them to the chicken/rice mixture.

I taste tested the prebaked casserole to see if it really needed all that salt. The flavor was yummy without it.I was excited to try something new, I knew we would enjoy it. The problem was when it came out of the oven, it had lost about 40 percent of its flavor. The rice apparently absorbs everything that made this yummy tasting before baking. It is a great casserole. I love the cruchiness of the waterchestnuts and the cornflakes. I will be making this again to see if I can solve the mystery of the missing flavor. Perhaps a little sherry or soy sauce? Oh, I also added 1t garlic powder and some frozen peas. It was still very good even with the flavors that disappeared while baking. Maybe it really needs the salt that I left out, but I felt the soup, butter and mayo added enough. Thanks for sharing,Behr!

My family and I really liked this recipe.  I made it as directed, only changing the amount of white pepper to half.  It's a great recipe to make for one dinner and freeze the rest for another.  It's nice and crunchy and very tasty, and freezes very well.  I have made it several times so far and it's always come out great!!!

I liked this but reduced the fat quite a bit - use lowfat soup (any cream of anything flavor) and lowfat mayonnaise and just enough butter to moisten the cornflakes. I also finely crushed the cornflakes. Great recipe when you are helping out a hurting or sick person's family...you make one dish for your own family and one for theirs. Or freeze one for those frantic days.

I halved this recipe but used whole cans of mushroom soup and water chestnuts.  I didn't measure the other ingredients, but just used what looked good to me and it came out very well.  I also used hickory smoked almonds because that is what I had and I wanted to use them up.

This is a family favorite!  I cook the chicken & rice the night before and just throw it all together the next night for dinner.  It is SOOOOO GOOD!  Has lots of flavor.  The only thing I leave out is the white pepper.  It makes it a little too spicy.

Make sure you let it firm up for awhile before you serve it.  Otherwise, it's quite runny.  I used cream of chicken soup instead mushroom, and water instead of broth, and it still turned out very good.  It's packed with texture - a real adventure for your mouth!  =)

My husband and I loved this reciped, my girls are very picky so they wouldn't touch it.  I did make some changes, I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup, left out the water chestnuts.  I used more onions and celery and sauteed them in a little bit of butter before adding.  I do think it would be to dry without the extra can of soup.  Also I only used one teaspoon of salt.

This was "OK" --not good enough for all of the work involved--I boiled up some chicken breasts with salt and bay leaves--deboned and cubed them, and cooked up the rice. I then followed the recipe as written with the minor exception of using light mayonaise--the cornflakes and almond topping were definetely the best part(WAY too much butter though, I'd cut that in half), but the rest of it was just a chicken in a cream sauce nothing to write home about.

Though there are just two of us at home, I made this huge recipe for my husband and myself.  It's wonderful!  We both had seconds tonight, and will have some for lunch tomorrow.  I can't wait to bring this to a potluck!  I will keep this recipe and share it with friends!  Thanks!

I got together with a friend to make and freeze several different recipes.  We sat down with our two families to eat it and not a single one of us could eat more than two bites!  Not sure where it went wrong, but we both cook frequently.  White pepper maybe?  It just had a terrible taste and was unbearable.

I can't say that this recipe is quick or easy, but it sure is good!  It's worth all the trouble!  This has become my standard "meal to the sick" dish.  Everyone of my girlfriends who has a baby requests it!  It is a huge recipe so be prepared to freeze some.  It makes 2 9 x 13's easy!  Delicious!

It was very time consuming but that wouldn't matter if it tasted good. I only wish I would have read the previous reviews further instead of looking at the 5 star rating.

I changed it around a lot. I liked the base of the recipe so I went off that and added some items. I didn't have mayo so I used NonFat Miracle Whip which gave it a really good kick in my opinion. I didn't have water chestnuts so I kept them out. I seasoned the chicken while it was cooking with seasoning salt and lemon pepper. I added some corn, and edamame for some veggies inside for the kids and I left out the salt and white pepper. It turned out really good and tasteful. I would do this again for sure.

Made this just like the recipe, but with chipotle mayo and it was delicious!  It was a bit salty.  Maybe cut the salt in half.

This has been a family favorite for the past 5 years.  I find the prep time to be much longer than indicated, although nothing difficult.  I cut back on the amount of butter for the topping.  DELICIOUS!

I will gladly give this one 5 stars. My wife and I could live on casseroles and we both really liked this one. I did cut everything in half and it still was plenty. Will try freezing some left overs.Didn't change a thing as far as ingredients. Thanks tallships

Just made this for the first time and figured that much butter must be a mistake.  So, only used 1/4 cup and used Rice Krispies instead of cornflakes.  It was great.  People that said it was dry must have a problem somewhere. Maybe some bad rice?  Thought it was delicious and a great casserole to take to a potluck.

There is way to much butter -- I think you could decrease the amount in half.  It is a little bland so try to add a spice to spice it up a little.

I had no idea what to expect when first trying this recipe, but was excited to try something new. And I was happily surprised...it tasted wonderful! I don't use celery or the water chestnuts, just family preference. Instead I added small pieces of fresh carrots and green beans. I parboiled them and then added to the mix. You don't need all the butter for the topping, as many others have stated, but of course we love the topping so I use a little less butter but add more cornflakes. This has been a weekly request around our house. Thanks Behr Kleine!

This was excellent!  It has a mild flavor but my guests enjoyed it, especially the crunch factor. I put it into two pie plates and froze one for this past weekend.  It was still crunchy and good. Served it with whole green beans with garlic butter, salad and garlic biscuits.

This recipe was very yummy although I would cut about half the butter out for the topping and crush the corn flakes (only a little), other than that I didn't change a thing and my family loved it.

This recipe turned out pretty well.  I used reduced fat mayo, yogurt, and mushroom soup to cut back on fat.  It had a nice crunch to it and was tasty.

Absolutely the best casserole I have ever made.  It's time consuming, but well worth it! I have made this casserole for many of my friends and family members and have been asked for the recipe every time.

This is a great recipe.  Our favorite version is to add a can of french cut green beans and then substitute french fried onions for the corn flakes and butter.  The recipe has lots of crunch to it and reheats very well.

I had to improvise a little on this recipe since I didn't have any yogurt on hand.  I used one cup of mayo instead.  I used two 8x8 pans and put half of the recipe in each.  I baked one and put one in the freezer for later.  My family loved it!!  I substituted lime juice for the lemon, since we are all lime lovers.  WONDERFUL RECIPE!

INCREDIBLE!!! This is an awesome casserole! Makes a HUGE amount, if you have a family of four or less, you may want to cut it in half!

I sub. Honey Bunches of Oats for the topping and it was wonderful! A nice sweet touch. Also, didn't need nearly as much butter then, only 6T.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed instructions exactly with the exception of using black pepper instead of white. The rice dried out in baking, the sauce was bland, the crunchy almonds blended in with the now crunch rice, and the chicken was chewy. No thanks.

I love this recipe. I have been making it for a couple of years now and everyone that I make it for absolutely loves it. I definitely recommend it for a family meal. I don't add the almonds up top, but everything else I do add.

My husband liked this dish and my 2-year old loved the cornflake and almond topping. But...I wasn't crazy about it. It just kind of tasted funny. I probably won't make it again.

Good casserole. I added worsterchire, a dash of seasoning salt, and used crushed Ritz instead of the corn flakes and sour cream instead of yogurt. I left out water chesnuts and chicken broth. You can make it the night before and just bake the next day. A staple meal in our house.

I took the advice of others and sauted celery and onion.  I also added a can of mushrooms. I added frozen peas for color and nutritional value. Next time I will cut the white pepper in half, as I found it too hot for our taste. A good recipe and I will make this again!

Not impressive at all- the taste was bland and the casserole looked really unappealing - very white.  It really seemed to be missing something.  I wouldn't make this one again.

Very good casserole dish!  I followed the collective advice of other reviewers: added fresh sliced mushrooms and sautéed them with the celery and onions; toasted the sliced almonds; reduced the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons, reduced the pepper to 3/4 teaspoon, and reduced the melted butter to about 1/2 cup.  I made everything but the topping the night before and then refrigerated it.  Added cornflake topping before baking, and increased baking time to about 1 hour.  Guests loved it, and had several requests for the recipe.  Only additional suggestion I'd make would be to add a bit more flavoring, as the casserole is mild though with lots of pleasing texture and crunch.  Maybe an Asian 5-spice?? I'll certainly be making this again!!

Tastes great and freezes well!  After reading other reviews, I did cut back on the white pepper.  I shredded my chicken the night before, which made it a quick meal to prepare after work.  I've already added this to my family cookbook. Thanks, Behr!

This was the first recipe I tried from Allrecipes.com and I definitely picked a winner. I made the 2 casseroles - one for a friend whose daughter was in the hospital, and one for me and my husband. It was excellent with a great variety of tastes and textures. The next time I will probably use less pepper, but everyone loved the original. I will make it again!

This was sooo yummy! I added a box of frozen chopped broccoli and 1/2 C. shredded cheddar cheese. I also used Rice Krispies for the cereal topping! I'll be making this a lot! I also used low fat sour cream (instead of yogurt), mayo, and cream of chicken soup. Thanks for the great recipe!

I loved this and so did my family.  I substituted sour cream for the yogurt (only because I didn't have it on hand).  I also used Ritz crackers on top instead of the corn flakes.  Did not use white pepper, used regular black pepper.  I also used the left over turkey from Thanksgiving that we had frozen.  Thanks for a great recipe.

What a great casserole!  I made some alterations, shared some with my aunt Doris, and decided it's a "keeper".  This makes a huge amount so make sure you're hungry.  Takes awhile to assemble but well worth the effort.

We liked this casserole but I wish I'd left out the white pepper.  It was too strong.  I'll keep trying other chicken casserole recipes before I make this again.  It was very easy & quick to prepare.

Excellent chicken casserole dish - everyone loved it.  I used 1 teaspoon salt instead of 1 Tablespoon and used 1 Tablespoon fresh lemon juice instead of 2.  I also poached the chicken breasts prior to assembling with other ingredients.  I made and refrigerated this a few hours ahead of serving time and did not put the crunchy topping on until time to bake.  Definitely makes a lot - I will cut recipe in half for 4 people in the future.  A keeper!

I'm pretty sure the salt amount was a typo.   I always add salt to taste anyway.   People can always resalt their food later.

I didn't find this to be sour at all.  I made it for dinner on Sunday and then used the leftovers for lunches at work over the week.   It worked out very well.

Only problem was finding almonds!

Thought this was a good dish.  Saw the comments about the salt, so omitted the extra tablespoon.
Recipe did not say how to cook the chicken, so I just boiled it and then used the broth from that instead of purchasing broth or mixing it up from the bouillon.

This dinner was pretty good.  I was leary about putting 1 tbs.of salt in.  It was too salty, I would put half the salt in.  I think it would be better with at least one veggie in it.  Maybe broccoli or baby carrots.  I'm not sure if it's a keeper or not. I'd give it a 7 out of 10.

I made this recipe for two the only changes were, no almonds which I shall make sure I have next time. I also put some fresh baby spinach at the bottom of the baking dish. No cornflakes so crushed up some potato chips 5 minutes before end of cooking. Did not add any salt. Great supper!

I made this recipe, and then tried it before I baked it and it tasted AWFUL. The white pepper definitely gives this dish a funk. So then I doubled everything else (imagine making more rice, cooking more chicken, etc) to try and salvage the dish. It was edible after the extra effort, but still not great. I think most people probably just use balck pepper instead of white pepper, and end up with a decent tasting casserole. That is what i would do if I was going to make this again.

I added sauteed mushrooms and parsley for color. The good thing is that it could be made ahead of time.  The bad thing is that it lacked flavor, much too bland for my taste.  I won't make it again.

This recipe is great! My roommate and I absolutely love it, and we can eat the leftovers for days (if they last that long.) I don't use white pepper and usually use canned chicken to speed it up a little, and it still tastes great! Also, I skip the butter  cracker topping and just sprinkle with more almonds before baking.

I have had this recipe for a long time...since it was first posted and it is soooooo yummy!!! I shared this with my family and they eat it all of the time, as do we.  Thank you so much for sharing!  I did, however, modify it by only using 1 Tbsp butter, and only enough cornflakes to cover the top.  We seem to like it less crunchy.

This was very good.  Used light sour cream (instead of yogurt) and light mayo and basmati rice.  Next time I'll try brown rice.

This takes a while to prepare but it's good. I omitted the onion and used brown rice. I also used cream of chicken soup since my husband isn't fond of mushrooms.The waterchestnuts, celery, and almonds give it nice texture. I also added some minced parlsey for added color.

I always laugh when reviews say it's great but I changed this, added this...did this differently.
I loved this recipe and yes, I added to it.  I added a box on frozen peas and pearl onions for color.  Only because it was already in my freezer.

Came out great, really simple to make. It could use a bit more seasoning in my opinion as it was quite mild. Reheats very well as leftovers.

I also think this would be a great wrap filling.

I pretty much stuck to the recipe, except for a few changes.  I boiled the chicken in water seasoned with salt and pepper.  I then used that chicken broth (1 cup) and I replaced the rest with 1 cup of white wine.  It was very yummy!!  I will add more onions next time.

This is my husband's favorite recipe!  I agree with the other posts - you can cut way back on the butter, save some fat grams & be just fine.  I also microwave the celery in the chicken broth to soften them up just a bit.  I'm amazed at the posts that say it lacks flavor.  We find that the white pepper really adds a zip to it!  I've also found that you can substitute cream of celery or cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom & it still tastes great.

Excellent recipe in general but next time I will reduce the amount of rice as others suggested and the amount of cornflakes and butter was WAY too much. Half the amount of each would be about right. I have also made this with turkey and used mushrooms instead of celery and it was very good.

Although this recipe was good it seemed to have a little too much butter and almonds.  When I made it I used light mayo, non-fat yogurt and light butter, but it still had a heavy taste. Next time I might reduce the butter and the overload of almonds by 1/2 cup.

I read the reviews first, sauted onions,celery, & almonds, added 1/2 t. of white pepper.  Still too much rice.  Good flavor but the rice overwhelms the chicken.  I didn't have mushroom soup so I substituted with cream of chicken.

Good recipe.  I made it with brown rice, wheat flakes and 1/2c butter and 1/2c olive oil and low fat soup.  Very good this way.

Yummy, Im a cook so I decided to make some changes-Omitted yogurt, added extra mayo, added soy-sauce, added sugar, always panfry, pre-cook chicken, and than wallah, oh added one can cr of shroom, and one can cream of chicken. Also, omit cornflakes and use crushed almonds instead to make a more oriental casserole. To each is there own and if you dont like it, adjust it or simply dont eat it..Smiles...

I love almond chicken dishes, so I knew
I had to try this.  I had my brother and
his wife over to test it with us.  We 
all loved it. my brother couldn't get 
enought and my sister-in-law even go
too full on it. It was a big hit.  I had
to make it again.  My family loves it. 
Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe took a long time to make and
when we finally ate it.  My family of 7
literally gagged on it.  It is nauseating
and sour tasting.  Never again.  I'm really
sorry, but this one is bad.

I made this recipe twice.  The first time my  family wasn't crazy about  it because they said it tasted "sour".  The second time I made it, I left out the lemon juice, and then I  added 3 TBS of soy sauce, 3 TBS of sugar, and 1 1/2 tsp almond extract.  This made all the difference and my crowd loved  it! Also, the recipe doesn't say to, but I precooked my chicken each time.

Very good, very easy, and it looks terrific.  I would add something "green" maybe peas, to give some contract color.  Other than that, I will use this often, I already gave the recipe to three people.

We went nuts over this casserole!  Instead of using rice, I broke up half of a box of angel hair pasta into small pieces and added it (uncooked) to the sauce and chicken. Just 45 minutes later, it was done to perfection!  As I often do with sauces and casseroles, I added 1/4 cup of dry sherry, along with a bit of rosemary.  
The butter amount seemed excessive, so I reduced it to one-half cup.  Will reduce even further next time.  I sauteed the celery and a whole onion before adding to the mix. The almonds (which I slightly roasted in a frying pan ahead of time) and water chestnuts were so delicious.  This will be a regular in our house!

Good but not great... that is until I doctored it up a bit. It was pretty flavorless after it came out of the oven (to be fair I used less salt and pepper than it requested) so I added soy sauce along with some other spices I had around, baked a few mins longer, and that helped a lot.

I make this often.  I leave out the water chestnuts, but other than that, it's great as is.  People always love it and want the recipe.

WAY too much butter in this recipe!! Maybe I'll try again but cut the butter by 1/2.

I liked this.  I used cream of chicken and mushroom soup, and unfortunately didn't have any water chestnuts because that would have added another dimension.  I found the cornflake and almond topping really tasty.

Enjoyable comfort food.  It reminds me of a casserole my grandma used to make.

I read the reviews and made a couple changes to this recipe including lowering the salt and the lemon juice.  Tastes great!

I really did something funny with this recipe, and it turned out great anyway!  I tried to make this with the recipe for 'Mock Chicken', which is actually tofu that has been frozen and then quick thawed.  Well, it still had the consistency of tofu, but didn't have much flavor so, the way I see it, it just added some extra nutrition and firmness to the casserole.  I also used 1 chicken breast, which I cubed and put in the casserole mix raw.  It turned out delicious!!  The only change I would make next time is to saute the celery first so it's a little more cooked rather than crunchy.

We made this recipe ahead of time and froze for future use.  It still turned out well and I have a picky husband.  I wasn't sure about the water chestnuts, but they added a crunch to the casserole that was wonderful!
