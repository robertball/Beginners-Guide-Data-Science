Excellent Recipe, here are my modifications:
- used Veg Ground Round instead of text veg protein
- added a little white wine and only 2 cups of water, not 4
- 2 cans of kidney beans used
- 2 cloves of garlic only.  I put everything in a crockpot (sauteed garlic, onions & celery first) and left it on low all day until supper.  Delish!!

I was expecting this to be a thicker chili, not so watery.  My husband LOVED it and calls it bean soup rather than chili.  The next time I make it I might try a little less liquid.  I also used it without the textured protein because I couldn't find it in the store!

It's the best Chili I have ever had and if you kind of makeup and add your own things as you go along it's even better.

This recipe was a great jumping off point for chili to feed a hungry potluck croud.  I omited the celery (seeing as I didn't have any on hand).  Due to another review, I cut down on the water by one cup.  Then, when I doubled the recipe - I didn't have enough chili beans, so I substituted some kidney beans (drained) instead.  I wanted my chili meaty, so I substituted about a pound and a half of browned ground beef for the second cup of TVP.  The result was delicious.  I am sure that it would be equally tasty made accoring to the recipe - but I would hold off on part of the water, and see how thick you want it.

I like to flavor my TVP, we also like to add various pepper powders and cilantro of course. I also use chili tomatoes, not stewed and usually add much more cumin and chili powder to taste and throw in some hot sauce.

Wow! This is good! I made some changes though: took the advice of some other reviewers and added a cup less water. I also used kidney beans as I couldn't find chili beans. I added a little white wine as someone else suggested. I added a bit more chili powder and a little cumin. I used turbinado sugar instead of brown sugar. I used petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed. Thanks for the recipe. I have faith in my ability to cook with TVP now. :)

I halved the recipe, adding about a teaspoon of minced garlic, substituting one can of kidney beans for a can of chili beans, and adding about a cup of TVP, dry. My roommates and family absolutely loved it! I think it's my favorite chili.

There was no flavor at the end after following recipe to the T. Except I used ground beef which should make it better. It tasted like campbells bean and bacon soup... didnt' taste like chili at all, it was soupy,  I even excluded the 1 cup of water as reviewers said and still consistency of soup.

This was my first time using TVP.  It was great!  This is a slightly sweet chili recipe, not very spicy at all.  I used a can of black beans instead of one of the cans of chili beans, because that's what I had.  I added cumin because I like that in chili.  I also added a half a can of tomato paste because I had it left over and thought this would be a good way to get rid of it.  I was very happy with this recipe.

It was good. I tripled the recipe for a vegetarian crowd. They enjoyed it. I added smoked paprika and chipotle pepper powder.
