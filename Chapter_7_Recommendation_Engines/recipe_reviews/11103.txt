This is the ONLY Buckeye recipe I use because not only does it taste better with the graham crackers, it also doesn't use tons of confectioner's sugar. Once you've tried this version, you will wonder how you ever made them with all that sugar! I double this recipe and make smaller balls as they get heavy on the toothpick when you dip/coat them in the semi-sweet melted chips. This recipe has become a family tradition with my own family and now my extended family. I can't show up for the big Christmas gathering without it!

Delicious! I like this Buckeye recipe because it has the graham crumbs in it. Gives them a bit more body and firmness. Try them!

A coworker shared this recipe with me almost 20 years ago and I lost it. I am so glad to find it here!  The graham crumbs give the pb filling a Reese's like texture.  This recipe is so much better than the pb and confectioners sugar alone. For those who had difficulty dipping, you can purchase a dipping loop in the candy section of your craft store, it makes dipping easy.

Good & easy. I used a 1/2 T. measuring spoon to make the balls & did not get 36. It only took 1 bag of chocolate & that was enough to coat all but 2. They are good uncoated too! I would make these again.

This is the recipe my Mama & I always make! The graham crackers cut down on the sweetness of other Buckeye recipes and, in my opinion, the texture they provide remind me of Reese's Cups! We always use the Gulf Wax (brand)/paraffin wax, too, instead of shortening. It makes the chocolate a little harder & alot more shiny! You usually find it in the canning section of the grocery store; where you'll find Sure-Jell, canning jars, etc. :) TIPS: 1). Either buy a box of graham cracker crumbs or use a processor to FINELY grind them. It's best not to have big chunks (if you can help it, but they're still gonna be good either way!) 2). BEFORE you dip them, put the balls on a cookie sheet, put a toothpick in each one and FREEZE them for about 20-30 min. It will make them easier to dip. Even if you don't use the toothpicks, still freeze them instead if just refrigerating them. It gives you more working time. And it's best just to take a dozen or so out at a time, get those dipped, then take out some more. (Unless you're really fast, which I am not!)  :p Hope the tips help those who had "dipping issues"! :) EVERYONE always says these are the best Buckeyes they've ever had!

Spectacular!  Great for entertaining as they add a definate gloss to the holiday table.  These are so much better with the graham cracker crumbs versus without.  Crunchy and sweet.  It can get tricky if the chocolate gets too hot, as the peanut butter can start to melt and get into the chocolate sauce.  If this starts to happen, remove the chocolate from the double boiler for a half a minute or so and replace.  They are addicting!

Not a good Buckeye recipe as far as ease of chocolate covering.Followed the recipe to the letter. Buckeyes would not release from fork nor would they stay on a toothpick when attempting to dip in chocolate. Cannot present these in public as is. Will go back to my old recipe.

Love them.  The graham crackers give a great texture to the peanut butter. First time I followed recipe exactly which turned out fine, but not quite sweet enough for me, so I doubled the sugar the next time and they were fantastic! Still way less sugar than other recipes.

Very nice recipe! Love it and it was very popular with everybody who tried them. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems, it was pretty easy to make. I will definitely be making them again, and again, and again...

Time consuming but addicting. Recipe adapts well with gluten-free graham crackers and dairy-free chocolate. Didn't do a very thorough job of crushing my graham crackers, so there were teeny bits that gave it a lightly crunchy (but not nutty) texture.

Definitely glad I made this recipe over the others - the graham crackers make all the difference!  I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup generic store brand creamy PB (lower sodium, lower fat) and one cup natural creamy PB.  I should have poured more of the oil off the top of the natural PB as the mixture was too creamy, and I had to freeze the balls before dipping.  I liked the more peanut taste from the natural PB.  I can't figure out a good way of closing or covering the holes but that doesn't change how great they taste!

OH MY GOODNESS!! These are so incredibly yummy!  I didn't have any regular graham crackers so I used the chocolate graham crackers and it is a hit with the whole family.  Definately a must have treat throughout the year!

Meh. I used this recipe to cut down on the sugar, but I now realize that I prefer my buckeyes without graham cracker crumbs. Even though I powdered the crumbs finely, there was still a certain unexpected sandy texture. I'm hoping that the crumbs will absorb some moisture with time and become less grainy by tomorrow. The flavor is good; the texture leaves something to be desired.

This recipe is a lot like my grandmother's recipe that I was trying to replicate. Instead of crushed graham crackers, I used rice krispies, which is what I recall my grandmother using in her recipe. These were a huge hit and didn't last long.  This recipe doesn't make a large amount, so I plan on doubling it again for next year.

I tried this recipe mainly because it had no added butter and it had less sugar than lots of other recipes I looked at. This recipe is still very rich, even without the butter and I love the texture the graham cracker crumbs gave it. I have to say - the PB flavour was more intense compared to a couple other recipes I have used before. It's a very yummy recipe which I will definitely add into my rotation of candies.

I've been using this recipe for years, only I substituted the shortening with 2 Hershey bars, there's paraffin wax in the Hershey which helps the chocolate harden and not stick to you fingers

Yummy!  Pretty easy, too... I doubled the recipe, and made the peanut butter centers in the food processor.  I ended up using chocolate bark instead of melted chocolate chips, because I had some on hand that I needed to use.  Took em' to a church potluck and they disappeared within minutes!

I made these for Christmas and they went before any of the other cookies that I made. I used half cruncy peanut butter and half smooth.  I did have to freeze them before I dipped them in the chocolate mixture.  Also, I increased the amount of graham cracker crumbs to 3/4 cup.  They are difficult and sticky to roll, but well worth it.  Try adding a little bit of vanilla extract, too.

Made these the first time this Christmas and had trouble keeping them around long.  My family started hoarding them.  There is a little bit of a trick trying to coat them in the chocolate and not having them fall off the fork/toothpick/ chopstick - but well worth the effort.

This was my second time making buckeyes, and I think I prefer this recipe with the graham cracker crumbs in them.  They seemed to hold their shape a bit better.  I did have to put them in the freezer prior to dipping.  Not sure I am entirely crazy about buckeyes, but if you like them then this is a good recipe for them.  Very rich, make small balls.

Good recipe, but too sweet as written. I added more peanut butter (about 1/2) and needed to add a bit of warm water to process. 
Used coconut oil in place of shortening, semi sweet and dark chocolate, 1 tsp of vanilla, and a dash of cinnamon in the chocolate. Nice.

Very good, basic recipe! I leave some of the graham crackers in small chunks to add a little crunch, but ground finely would perhaps mix better. Instead of trying to dip the PB balls into the chocolate with a toothpick, I just dunked them and placed them in cupcake papers. They looked like fancy chocolate from a box, so I was fine with that.

Those balls are impossible to keep on a toothpick or fork.  Waste of my time & money.  Good luck to someone who can get it to work.

With WalMart's natural peanut butter (which I think is creamier than my regular brand), I needed to add double the confectioner's sugar to make the balls more firm.

Fabulous recipe! The graham crackers give a necessary texture.  I added a bit more peanut butter because I found the mixture to be a bit dry with the recommended amount.  Will definitly make again and will continue to bring to family events.

Very yummy peanut butter balls. I used about 1/4 cup crunchy peanut butter with the rest creamy. For some reason I could not get these dipped in the chocolate properly, but I do not think this was related to the recipe or directions - I just think it was not my day for dipping!
Will make again.

These turned out really well. They were one the most delicious desserts I made this holiday season. However, I did think that they were one of the most difficult. You have to be really careful with the temperature of the chocolate as well as how long you leave it in the melted chocolate. I had the problem of leaving it into long - trying to coat it completely- and the chocolate would melt. But in the end they turned out great and were very tasty.
