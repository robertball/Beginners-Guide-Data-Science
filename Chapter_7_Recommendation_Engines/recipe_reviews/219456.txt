Could not tell ingredients were reduced fat/calories.  I would not use the slow cooker again.  Instead I would heat in the oven until cheese is melted on top.  The slow cooker seemed to dry it out so it wasn't very creamy like a dip should be, (if it cools you can always heat again in the microwave.)  I did leave it in the cooker for the duration of a football game, so that could be why it dried out.  I also used frozen checken breast chunks instead of canned chicken. My kids loved it and I made it into a sandwich similar to a tuna melt the next day.  It was wonderful!

I followed this recipe to the T except light ranch - I used fat free. My husband made love to me as a thank-you because of how good this was. I also ate it with pita chips.

Made no changes to this recipe. It didn't last long! Nobody knew that the ingredients were fat free. Will use this as the "go-to" dip for parties. Any talk about easy!

This is always a huge hit!!  This is a go to for potlucks!  I have had the not healthy version and I think this healthier one is just as tasty!!  One change I have made for personal preference is instead of ranch dressing, I use 1 cp low fat greek yogurt, 1/2 cup skim milk and a packet of dry ranch mix.  I also microwave or bake it, I've never done this in the slow cooker.

I made half the recipe, but next time will do entire recipe.  This dip is delicious, and was eaten within two days. I did slightly decrease the hot sauce for preference, and shredded one large pre-cooked chicken breast for a half recipe, didn't have canned. Heated in oven at 325, covered, for about 25 mins, until cheese was melted well.  Served  with celery sticks and everyone loved it. You could easily use low fat ranch too to decrease calories further and no one will know the difference. I think if I was leaving in a crockpot, I would add some milk to keep from drying out.  Thanks for sharing!

I made a few modifications to make it less fattening and reduce the dairy. I made my own chicken, used veggie shreds (cheddar cheese), Toffuti cream cheese (non dairy) and fat free Ranch and I added 1 Tbsp blue cheese. This reduced the calories by 70+ and reduced the fat by 11+ grams. Plus it was delicious. I think I could even cut the ranch to 1/2 cup due to sweetness or make my own Ranch with soy yogurt or Toffuti sour cream and seasonings. No one knew it was low fat and loved it.

Ahhh, perfection!! Please trust me, forget the full fat version of this recipe that is also on this site and use this one - you will NOT miss out on any of the fabulous, delicious flavor, but you will happily skip all of the extra (unnecessary) fat and calories that are in the other version. I did not change one thing and my guests devoured this dip! And don't hesitate to play around with the amount of hot sauce you add to this dip depending on how "hot" you would like it to be. Just customize it to suit you and your guests!

My husband and I LOVE buffalo chicken dip but I never make it because it's always so greasy and gives us both tummy aches! I couldn't imagine a low-fat version being as good as the original but it IS and even BETTER! I doubled this recipe to serve to a group of 30 guys and it was GONE. And everyone was asking who made it! Saving this to make again and again! 
Substitutions: I replaced half the neufchatel with plain greek yogurt , added sauted onion (about a half of one onion) and minced garlic, and threw in one stalk of chopped celery.

Also think this is delicious. Have made several times for Saturday night dinners in our ER. Never a drop left and no one EVER comments that it tastes reduced calories. I also makes a great Halloween dish. Carve a yuk face with a wide mouth with this coming out...who said pumpkin vomit was not DELICIOUS!!

I make this dip for every get together and then some. I've even had friends ask me to make it for them. I make mine right on the stove and keep it warm in a small slow cooker. My husband love it with Wheat Thins but I prefer lots of celery.
Its a great recipe! Perfect for football season.

I added 1 more can of chicken, substituted 5oz low fat blue cheese for 5 oz of the cheddar cheese and used hot sauce on top of prepared dish (we like it spicier).  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!!

This was very good.  I used two boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 10oz each), diced and sauteed in a bit of olive oil, with garlic powder and onion powder liberally sprinkled on, and cut the hot sauce to 1/2 instead of 3/4 c.  It still had a slight kick; for us, any more would have been too much.  It was really good with celery.  Also, it seemed so thick that I added about 1/c of water, a little at a time, till I got more of a dip consistency.  

For four people the quantity was way too much, so I'd cut it in half if I made it again.  One downside is that it needs to stay warm, and should be in a wider shallower container, a chafing dish or a wide crockpot.  We didn't have those, so kept it on the stove, which meant it wasn't very convenient.

VERY TASTY. Did not add cheddar, no need. Replaced ranch with BLUE CHEESE. 
Serve Hot. No need for Crock Pot or Oven if served immediately after cooking over the stove.
Also cut celery and carrot to serve with chips/crackers.

Just 2 of us so halved recipe using regular ranch and taco flavor cheese on hand. Always enjoy at parties but usually too spicy. This was perfect!! Served w pita and flatbread crackers. Very tasty and neither could stop dipping! Will be making again.

Simple, fast and healthier. No one noticed the light ingredients. I melted ingredients before adding chicken in a square ceramic baker in microwave, then added chicken and cheese topping. Baked at 350 until hot, slightly browned and bubbling. What a hit!

It was amazing. I used fresh chicken breast and cooked it with the seasoning that I liked and used more buffalo sauce and used extra sharp cheddar cheese and Colby Jack cheese.

This was easy and delicious. I followed the recipe almost  as written except I added a dollop of sour cream and cut down to 1/4 cup for the hot sauce since we aren't fans of spicy.  I will be making this again.

I make this for my work parties and t’s always a hit with my crockpot being literally scraped out clean. The only thing I do different is to cut the hot sauce back to only 1/2 cup, and it still has plenty of zip.

I cut this in half for 4 people and it still made a lot more than we needed.  I also browned ground chicken breast instead of using the canned chicken.  This was incredibly good!

I loved this, as did our hosts where this was served as an appetizer at their home. I used rotisserie chicken breasts, added at least another half - cup of Franks Wing Sauce.

It came out kind of soupy. I don't know if it was because I used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese which may be thicker. I think I would use less dressing next time.

I used mild cheddar cheese instead of reduced fat cheese. This allowed the cheese to melt to the consistency I desired. My sister-in-law asks for this every time we have a get together. Definitely a crowd favorite!

I only wanted to make half the recipe.  I added part blue cheese dressing and part ranch dressing.  I only used 1/3 c. hot sauce (I used sirracha),  and I ended up using 2 cans of chicken.

I made this as written, but with just a little less cheddar cheese than called for.  It was very good, everyone loved it!

I used 1 lb of fresh chicken breast I cooked for 20 minutes, cooled and cubed. I can't eat spicy due to medical reasons so used tabasco sauce as I could adjust the heat and used dressing I found that was a mix of Ranch and Franks's red hot. I baked in the oven at 325 for 20 minutes and served with pita chips. I will use it again.

Very easy recipe to make and take along to a party. I used shredded chicken breast and 1/2 c Hot sauce so it was just right. I used the crock pot so that it didn't have to be heated up at the party,  and that worked well.

Love this! I followed the recipe exactly and chose Frank's buffalo hot sauce. The only modification I used was grating my own cheddar. I read a review for another recipe that said the bagged shredded cheese can make it thicken up in the crock pot. It was just enough to fill my mini crock, and as long as I stirred it every so often it was great even several hours later! I served it with tortilla chips and celery sticks and it was a big hit!

I used full flavor ingredients (rather than the healthier low fat versions). Fabulous 'bring a dish to share' appetizer. Served it with celery sticks and a variety of chips/crackers/crusty bread.

Tastes great you won't miss the extra calories. I used a hidden valley ranch packet with lite sour cream instead of premade ranch and I heated it in the oven at 350. It was a huge hit. Will definitely make again. Great with veggies and crackers.

I made this for a potluck. I used light cream cheese and it was delicious! Came out more like a spread than a dip though. I am going to try it in a wrap like someone suggested on here.

The Neufundal cheese is with the cream cheese, but very hard to find!! Loved this dip though. I had it with pita chips, and tortilla chips! It was delicious. I'm sure it would be great at a party, but my husband and I had leftovers serval times over the next few days!

My husband & I loved it!  It was easy to make.  The only thing that I did different was instead of putting it in the crock pot I baked it in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 after sprinkling the cheese on top.  You could get away with not putting the cheese on top if you want to save calories.  Will definitely make again.

The first time, I made it in the Crockpot--the second time, in the oven. The oven method is so much better. The Crockpot seemed to dry it out, and make it thicker. The flavor was fine both times.

As is this recipe is delicious!  I've made it many times.  My family don't like to get their fingers dirty with real buffalo wings (wussies) so I started making this for sports parties.  
We prefer it with lite blue cheese dressing in place of the ranch.  I sometimes double the chicken and use the mixture in wraps with thinly sliced celery, sweet onions, and shredded lettuce.

I made this, but added crumbled blue cheese. I served with sliced cucumbers, celery sticks, waffle cut carrots, and sliced red and yellow peppers. For chips I served red quinoa and chia seed nachos. Huge hit with everyone and they never suspected it was a low calorie version.

I got this recipe from a friend in Buffalo and have always used reduced fat ingredients. My only difference is instead of ranch dressing I always use reduce fat blue cheese.. The kind found in the produce area at the grocery.. I NEVER have  leftovers!  A definite hit at any gathering.

This was a delicious dip. You could not tell that the ingredients were low fat!!  I used fresh chicken breasts that I just boiled and shredded. I mixed it all together and baked it in a 350 degree oven until it all started to bubble.
