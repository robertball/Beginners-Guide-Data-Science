This turned out very nicely, the meat was tender with a mild subtle flavor. I also added some minced garlic.

I lovely Mon-Fri night dinner that's really easy to prepare and to cook. I used ground ginger instead of grated which seemed to work fine. I just need inspiration with what to put with it :) !

Very easy to prepare but they did lack some flavor even after I added some minced garlic to add some kick.

We didn't like this at all.  The flavour of the beer was very intense and the other ingredients paled.  Maybe it is because I am Canadian and our beer is stronger.

this is good, but it reallys needs to marinade overnight, not just four hours.  Still, my kids loved it as did my DH.

I made this for a family gathering and they were a huge hit.  The meat stayed very tender and everyone wanted the recipe!

I marinated my chops for about six hours in this.  They had a very mild flavor that didn't over power anything.  They were good though.
