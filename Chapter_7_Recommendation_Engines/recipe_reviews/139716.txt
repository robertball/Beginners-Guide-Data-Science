Because this proved to be just the right amounts of both Splenda and lemon juice for me I'll consider this a valuable reference recipe so that I get it right every time.

This tasted as good as any homemade lemonade I tasted, which surprised me. I love lemonade in the summer, but know it is loaded with sugar, so I don't make it as often as I would like. I used the calculate button and changed the servings to make as many glasses as I wanted. I used Truvia, as I didn't have splenda, and it disolved right in the water. I may have more lemonade this year now when I get the craving.

I did have to make a few adjustments due to running out of Splenda, but it turned out great.  Used 1 cup of Splenda and 3/4 cup sugar and followed the recipe otherwise as directed.  Made it for our 4th of July celebration and everyone including the kids are raving about it.

I've made this over and over. Even the reluctant, anti-sugar free people love this lemonade. I love it over crushed ice. Yummie!!!

This is good..but we are not Splenda fans. The sugar substitutes we like are Sweet 'n Low and Equal. Other than changing the sugar substitute we like this recipe.

My fourth time making this!! I loved this every time. Twice I made it with store-bought lemon juice and twice I have made it with fresh lemons from my tree! Works great with Splenda and regular sugar.

This is a staple in my house. Here's a twist if you like mint. Try putting 2-4 mint leaves in the lemonade before refrigerating. Leave in pitcher as decoration and taste this is a Southern American this to do. Now it's coming back as people start infusing water with juice from whole fruit. The steep time for this will vary to the strength of flavour you want. 4-48 hours. Also, if you muddle/crush the leaves slightly it will increase the flavour. The number of mint leaves also matters too. Try other herbs too for a refreshing change. Lavender is really nice in teas too. Iced earl grey with a few lavender stalks.

OMG...This is probably the BEST lemonade I think I have EVER HAD, sugar-free or not, but since I've recently started watching more closely what I eat, this sugar-free version is EXCELLENT... plus there's (give or take) 200 calories for a 2-LITER pitcher of lemonade...you can't beat that!  The only thing I may do is cut the amount of sweetener I dissolve in the saucepan by maybe 1/4 or even 1/8 a cup...besides that, this recipe is PERFECT!

I was looking for a home-made lemonade but this one used 9 lemons, which I thought was a lot. It called for Splenda but I replaced that with Truvia as I don't use Splenda and read that one reviewer also did this but I thought it was way too sweet and tasted more like sugar water than lemonade. I will be looking for another home-made lemonade recipe without Splenda and uses less lemons.

I don't drink soda but lemonade, limeade, Hibiscus tea. This recipe is delicious as well as easy to make, surely it will be a regular drink with lunch/dinner.Best part it's sugar free, Diabetic since 1989.
