I made this with tortillini noodles instead of rice and it was delicious.  Also, I just used plain frozen spinach not the souffle and it was still great.

This is an excellent recipe.  Make sure you season the chicken before you brown it.  It tastes better the second day!!!

I used crumbled Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs... worked very well as a substitute.

This recipe is delicious! I've made it several times according to the recipe and I've found that a few small changes help tremendously. First I brown the chicken on both sides (not cooking all the way through) and put that on top of the rice mixture along with the bread crumbs and cover with foil instead of putting the rice in by itself. After 25 minutes I take the foil off and cook the rest of the way. Also I use Italian flavored bread crumbs, which kick it up a notch. The last thing is I substitute brown rice and you can hardly tell the difference. Very delicious recipe! Thank you!

A simple casserole...nothing spectacular.  I did not try crushed Ritz crackers, but that certainly would be more flavorful than plain breadcrumbs.  Edited 6-30-05 to add that this is the exact same recipe as the Cheesy Chicken Florentine recipe submitted by Stouffer's on this web site.

Thought I'd like this a lot.  It wasn't bad, but it was more like spinach souffle with chicken & rice ... Oh, yeah.  It was.  :)  I only made half the recipe & it was plenty - would serve six.

I love all the ingredients in this dish, but was dissapointed with how flavorless it was.  I may try again adding more spices or taking some of the other reviewers sugestions of using cracker crumbs.

I used the Ritz crackers as one reviewer suggested becasue I thought it would be tastier than bread crumbs. I thought this was good; my husband really liked it; teenage daughter inhaled the spinach part but wasn't too interested in the chicken. There isn't anything complicated about this, but it seemed to take a little more time and effort  than most "easy recipes". It probably would help if I had some leftover rice ,rather than having to cook some for the recipe. I would make this again.

Really tasty!! I really liked this recipe! It made a mess of the kitchen but was well worth it. I took the advice of another review and used Ritz crackers as the crunchy crumble on top. YUM!!!

I coated the chicken first in flour then egg wash then in seasoned bread crumbs and cooked it in hot oil instead of just browning it, it was really good and flavorful. Having a rice cooker helps to make this recipe an easy one too!

I got this recipe off AllRecipes.com a few years ago and it is awesome!  My whole family loves it so I have to make it at least once a month.

I enjoy this a lot. I've madr it with chicken but I've also used fish instead. It does make a lot so I usually cut it in half.

Added extra cheese, onion and a touch of garlic.  Had lost the recipe and stouffer's no longer list it on line.  So glad to find it again.

My family loves this meal! However I double the bread crumb/cheese mixture on top of chicken and only use 1 spinach souffle in rice mixture.

Requires a lot of dirty dishes since several things need to be cooked seperately.  Will probably make one more time to see if it turns out better next time to warrent the extra work.
