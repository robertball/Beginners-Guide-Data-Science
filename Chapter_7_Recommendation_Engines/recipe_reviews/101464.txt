While the taste is there, this is too much meat for the amount of other ingredients. I made this with 1 lb. of beef with 16 oz of velveeta and one cup of salsa (actually I used Rotel) and I liked it much better. Thanks!

Made this for a party and placed it next to a platter of ice cold jumbo shrimp. This dip was the FIRST thing to go. Go figure! Everyone asked me how I made it-- I was a little embarrassed to tell them how easy. :)

This didn't turn out well for me. It was very salty.
