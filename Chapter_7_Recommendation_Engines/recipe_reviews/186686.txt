The sauce needed to be thicker. I would add another tbs of cornstarch. I cut the chicken down to 1 1/2 pounds and added a fresh stir fry mix of snow peas, broccoli, and carrots. I didn't have apricots (just the jam) so my husband suggested throwing in some raisins instead. I'm glad he did I think its what made it as good as it was and no chopping apricots. We do much prefer the apricot Glazed Chicken from this site which is very similar. Another tbs cornstarch, a tbs of soy sauce and mare another 4oz of jam or a little less broth and this would be 5 stars all the way.

It's ok.  It's just too sweet and I used the "No sugar added preserves" and half the dried apricots suggested.

This recipe is terrific! I did need to add 2 tablespoons more of corn starch than is suggested, and I also served steamed asparagus with it, it was an all around great dish though, my family loved it!

A big hit! I used garlic flavored oil instead of olive oil.  Also added a spicy jerk sauce.  I took a short cut: cooked the chicken then removed it to a plate and sliced into strips, then returned it to the pan--easier than cutting raw chicken.

I made only half this recipe since it is only the 2 of us and it was absolutely delicious. I normally do not care for apricots but it was just the right sweetness for the sause which is great over the rice. I found the sauce to be perfect.

This is a great recipe when you don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. I added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper because my husband doesn't usually like sweet dishes.  I didn't put the apricots in; just a couple of tablespoons of the preserves. He cleaned his plate! This is so easy to make.

I added some garlic to the onions, and finished it with some bottled lime juice to brighten it.  It's delicious!  I served it with aborio rice -- it's what I had, and served quick fried sugar snap peas.  Very tasty!
