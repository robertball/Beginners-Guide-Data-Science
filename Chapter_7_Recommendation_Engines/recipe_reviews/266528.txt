Loved this! Left out the cloves due to personal preference and it still turned out great! Needed a little bit of salt but that is all.

This is sooo good! Tried it with beef roast first and then with a pork roast the second time. Both delicious!

Great recipe that had a nice amount of "heat".  A Dutch oven is mentioned but not the use of it's cover in the oven.  Perhaps this is taken for granted? Beef easily fell apart and made delicious burritos with red onion, cilantro & salsa.  A Keeper!
