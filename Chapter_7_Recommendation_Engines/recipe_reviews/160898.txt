Very spicy flavorful dish!  Crunchy peanut butter is a must!  I added some evaporated milk to the pureed pumpkin and then to the sauce at the end to thin it out a bit and made it a bit more creamy.  Delicious on rice.  I used jalapeno (seeds and all), since I didn't have the chile pepper. . . had a nice kick to it.  Next time I think I'll add some red pepper to the sauteed vegies, as well, and maybe some fresh chopped cilantro on top.  Would also be good made with chicken.  Thank you for the recipe. . . great way to use some of our leftover pumpkin from Halloween.

It could be a little thinner sauce. Otherwise, very good!

Surprised how delicious this tasted over spagetti noodles! I happened to have all these ingredients on hand and it came together very well. I used thawed butternut squash from my freezer instead of pumpkin. Used less coriander. Used less peanut butter because I thought it would overwhelm the other ingredients but it didn't. Strong orange juice flavor. Used less ham because I'm not a big meat person. Could cut out the ham entirely and it would be a delicious vegetarian dish.

Yumly!  Had no peanut butter on hand, so ground up some almonds into paste instead (actually had to add some oil to get our weak grinder to make it into 'butter').  The satay was a bit thick (maybe because of the almond 'butter'?), so we added a little broth from the soup I served alongside this satay.  That did the trick wonderfully.  Did decide to cook the satay a little longer because the pumpkin flavor was still obvious as an aftertaste until it was cooked longer, and hubby does NOT like pumpkin...  That also worked very well, even by his standards!  Only had a jalapeno pepper on hand, so sub'd that.  Also had no coriander seed, so sub'd a little extra cumin along with a bit of fennel seed and caraway (as per suggestions which came up via an internet search).  I'm one to add a touch of sugar and/or salt to balance out seasonings & did so here. My youngest two children (young teens) both enjoyed this a great deal, our youngest son in particular.  My husband who claims to hate pumpkin is pretty impressed with the fact that a surprising number of the pumpkin items we have tried from this site have been enjoyable.  This might not be his first pick in dinners, but he'd never turn it down.  He would have even enjoyed seconds if the kids hadn't eaten it all up before he got to it.  Thanks, Hushai!  This is going in my cookbook, though I'm likely to add in some fresh spinach at the end, both for nourishment and color. I might also top this with defrosted peas for the same reason.

Needed a change and liked this dish very much. Had to substitute crushed red pepper for the serrano. Sauce was a little too thick so I added a little half-and-half which made it creamy. Served over organic brown rice with chopped cilantro on top. Will make again...Thanks for submitting this!

I cut the servings down to one and used cut up turkey as I had no ham, and cut back on the peanut butter by about 1/3 and followed the recipe otherwise.  Like other reviewers said, the result is like paste - I had to  add 3/8c. chicken stock to get it to a reasonable consistency for serving but it's quite tasty. I served it with rice.

Way too much peanut butter. I'm a novice cook and after reading the comments I wish I had the same experience as others to know not to put as much peanut butte. I could practically spread this paste on toast and jam.
