Ended up baking them for 45 minutes (since I hate frying food). Halfway through I flipped them and added more honey/dill. Turned out excellent; my family has been begging me to make them again.

This was good.  I melted the butter, honey and dill together and basted the chops while cooking.  Keep temp low so you do not burn.

Big hit with my husband and 2 year old!  I baked it rather than frying.  At 350 for 1 hour, flipping them over after 30 minutes.  Came out very tender and well seasoned.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a nice simple way to prepare pork chops. Because of the reviews I added a little bit of margarine to the pan, reduced the heat to med-low, and added a bit more dill on each side. They're a little plain, but still tasty.

This had an interesting, but really good taste to it.  My husband even liked it.  I will be making this again and will be on my favorites.

This was a pleasant surprise. I never would have paired these two flavors together but it really brought out the flavor in the pork. The only difference I made was par cooking the chops in butter so I didn't burn the honey. I also used fresh dill from my garden. Came out really good.

Great easy port recipe. I did a quick 30 minute brine on the pork and cooked it in my cast iron skillet. I premixed the honey and dill with a little melted butter.

Not my favorite but I did enjoy the unique flavors of mixing honey and dill.  It was refreshing to try something with tastes that are not used often.

This was just ok, there was not a lot of flavor. I used dry dill and quite a bit at that, maybe I should have used fresh. Sorry Miller5.

These were very good. My chops could have been a bit more tender, but I think next time I'll just coook them longer. I did add a bit more dill than the recipe called for because I wanted to make sure I could taste it through the honey. Will make again.
