I am a bartender of 30 some years and this was great. It was also the easiest of any I have ever tried.

I combined this recipe with on eo fthe other coffee liqueur recipes on this site to make it a bit easier.  I used instant espresso rather than ground coffee beans to eliminate the straining.
This recipe is wonderful.  I've made it for Xmas gifts for 2 years now, and my friends beg for it each year!

Yummy, yummy!  One alteration - I only had 1 1/2 cups of vodka, but I put the whole amount of coffe mixture in.  Seems to give it a more concentrated coffee taste.  Yum Yum!

This is a good recipe. I personally brew the coffee first before adding the sugars, etc.  It makes for less mess later on.  I also use flavored coffees a lot such as chocolate flavored or whatever I want to try at the time.  It is very important to make sure the coffee/sugar mixture is very cool before adding the alcohol (vodka) so that the alcohol does not evaporate.  This drink is sure to tickle your fancy if you like coffee flavored liquors!

This is a beautiful (and cheap!) thing. I only made a half-batch to test the recipe. I bought the cheapest vodka I could get, and it worked perfectly. Since it was a half-batch, I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 2 TBS brown sugar (instead of all white). I only had pre-ground coffee, so I added an extra 1/2 TBS, and it was caramel-flavored - yummy! I also only used 1 cup of vodka instead of 1 1/4 cups. Next time, I'll use 3/4 cup so the alcohol taste is lessened and I think I'll add the vanilla when I mix in the vodka to try to get more of the flavor, but this is great! Oh, and an easy way to strain it is to place a coffee filter in a large funnel and place that on top of a tall container so when you pour it in it will drip away at its own rate while you do something else. Thanks, Janet, for an excellent recipe!

This really packs a punch with both flavour and alcohol content.  I made this for christmas presents and it went down very well.  While I wouldn't change a thing I do think that if you use a cheap quality vodka then you should use less cos it just burns, but with a good quality vodka, you can use the recipe amount and end up with a very rich and smooth finished product.

I did change this up a bit but used the basic recipe and it is DELICIOUS stuff! My daughter declared it better than the "real" stuff. I tried it with the coffee grinds in the water but after spending 15 minutes and making a big mess trying to get all of the grounds out I threw that batch away and started with a really strong brewed chocolate flavored coffee. I used 3 cups of coffee and simmered the ingredients for 30 minutes until it reduced down to about half. Then I threw in a handful of ice to cool it down and added the Absolut vodka. Didn't wait for it to sit for a few days. The batch was gone in 2 days and I'm making another batch as we speak! One caution.... DON'T let this stuff boil over on your stove. You'll be cleaning the mess for hours as the sugar will immediately harden and create a cleaning nightmare.

Easy and good!  Better than store bought.  Made one with cheap Vodka and one with a little better (Gordon's).  Use the better Vodka makes a big difference.

I gave this one 5 stars! It sure beats paying the high price at the liquor store. Instead of straining the coffee grounds, I emptied a family sized tea bag and inserted the coffee grounds and resealed with a stapler...worked GREAT!

Not as good as the known brand. I halved the recipe for the first time around. Since the recipe did not half easily, I followed another reviewers advice and used 1/2 cup white sugar, 2 tbsp brown sugar, and one cup of vodka. Instead of straining the coffee, I put it in a tea strainer in the pot. There was too much of a sweet coffee flavor and with only 1 cup of vodka it was still too strong.  I'll either try another recipe or stick with store bought.  Thanks anyway.

I did not have coffee liqueur and needed it to make a tiramisu cake. I found this recipe and had all of the ingredients and wow! My cake tastes like a restaurant/bakery cake.  I decided to have some on the rocks to compare to store bought. Pretty good and close.  I added some carmel liqueur and  bingo........

This was great stuff! The only thing I changed was to use instant coffee so that I didn't have to strain it. It's awesome. I put it in those "olive oil" dispensing bottles and give it as a gift. People love it.

Great!  I have used this recipe for years, and my friends still request it at gatherings.  I sometimes use different flavored coffee beans to add a twist.

Tastes great! The only hard part was removing the grounds, I made quite a mess in my kitchen. Probably won't make this one again. I used Splenda to make it healthier.

Did not really care for the flavor.  Was both very bitter and very sweet at the same time.

Tasted nice.. I topped mine with a little whipped cream and a dusting of cinnamon. I accidentally used too much coffee when heating on the stove, but it tasted fine to me.
