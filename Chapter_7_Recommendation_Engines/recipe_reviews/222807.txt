You can also add half a package of frozen spinach or 4 cups of fresh chopped spinach for an added twist!

Reply to comment above - sorry you found the recipe too hot but the recipe only calls for 1 tsp of chilli powder/cayenne.

Very easy to make and not too time consuming, which is nice.  The flavour was pretty nice.  I added some potato chunks and it worked well - just a couple of potatoes cut up into small cubes.  Ate it with basmati rice and naan bread.  Yum!

I cut the lamb into small chunks to increase flavor and cook faster. I mixed the lamb with spices and ginger, garlic, basil, dill pastes and refrigerated it for an hour. I made this with two onions and spinach to have the lamb be subtle, and the dish not overly meaty. Came out delicious! Lamb curry is one of my favorite dishes to order in Indian restaurants and now I can make it myself! It was one of the best dishes I've ever made.

I give this recipe only 4 stars because it is EXTREMELY spicy. I cut the Cayenne pepper back to 1.5 tsp. and added some plain yogurt at the end and it was still VERY spicy. I realize heat is a personal preference, but this just seemed a bit much. It was also quite thick - I ended up adding water to thin out the sauce so I could simmer without scorching it. Aside from that this was super! My husband declared it "really, REALLY yummy." When we make it again, we will probably cut the cayenne back to 1 tsp. We found that roasted vegetables (carrots, broccoli, onions and potatoes seasoned with olive oil, salt, pepper, cumin and just a touch of cayenne) went with this very well.

I have made this so many times, it's really one of my go to recipes.   Made it as directed the first time a few years back, and it was wonderful!  Since then, I have tried a couple modifications based on what I have on hand and you really can't mess this up.  I generally use beef, prepare as directed, then add to my slow cooker with a can of diced tomatoes and a bit of water then set on low for 6 hours or so.  The other night, I added some yukon gold potatoes and carrots that I wanted to use up and it was excellent.  Have fun with this recipe and thank you for sharing!

This was very good however was this supposed to be made w/o any liquid?? I added a bit of water otherwise it was too sticky and getting burnt.

Wonderful recipe and so fast and easy to make! Made according to directions, would only change the amount of salt: 2 teaspoons is way too much. Would cut to 1 tsp or less. As to the spiciness - it is a spicy recipe! The chili powder can be cut down for less spice

Great recipe! The lamb was VERY tender and the spices were a perfect blend. I used Aleppo chili pepper (actually I had my wife add the chili pepper--according to her I make everything too HOT--she used two large pinches and the heat was spot on.) I added chopped cabbage leaves from the garden (but would use kale, spinach, or some such green).  I did add about 1/4-1/2 cup of water after adding the leaves and then let it all simmer for about an hour.  The last 5-10 minutes the lid was off to allow it to thicken slightly.  This would be great served over rice, but because we're both doing the Whole30, no rice for us!

When I try a recipe here, I try it exactly as the author laid it out.  Can't complain if you change it from the original!  Now I LOVE lamb and especially curried lamb.  I tried this recipe as it was written and it had to be the absolutely worst example of curried lamb or Indian food I had ever tasted (and I have tasted some bad recipes).  Flavor was lacking (for Indian food) and it just tasted wrong.

Very tasty recipe!  I took the advice of a few of the previous reviewers and added potatoes, spinach, and about 3/4 cup of water to the pot.  I also was careful with the cayenne since we donâ€™t prefer anything too spicy. It was very easy and very delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

Everyone loved this!  I used the slow cooker to cook it.  The meat was very tender and flavorful, and the sauce amount was just right (I added 1/2 cup of water).

This recipe is amazing!!  Everyone has loved it.  I just added a little water for more sauce.  Served it over yellow rice.  Added some tzatziki sauce at the side.  Sweet peas.  Lovely red wine.  Fantastic!!

As suggested by another member, I added cubes potatoes to the onions, and fresh spinach within the last 5 minutes. Also used ancho chili powder.

What a fantastic recipe!! I've never made my own curry before and this was a great place to start. This is one of the only recipes on this site that I didn't have to doctor. The spice level is perfect and it smells wonderful! I paired it with basamati rice and naan. Delicious!

This is a really great recipe and extremely forgiving. I make it often and I no longer measure the spices.  I always add potato and a little broth, so the potato cooks through. Occasionally I will add peas too!

I doubled the recipe and added a potato and a cup of diced carrots. Went very healthy on the spices with 2 tsp of chili powder plus a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. It was hot but not overly so. Best Indian dish I've ever made!

I enjoyed flavor of spices in this curry. I never cooked using garam masala seasoning, and this was a great dish. Ever since I started preparing this recipe, I have been cooking it more often. Thank you!!
