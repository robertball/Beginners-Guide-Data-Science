I give this 4 stars on the condition that you add an additional egg.  I mixed this recipe and then read the reviews. Two stars!  Oh no!  I looked at some other recipes and I didn't see much difference except maybe more eggs, so I added another egg to the batter.  It took a little over 35 minutes to finish baking, but I ended up with a cake that tastes just like it came out of a box - which is what this is supposed to emulate.  My guess is that the other reviewers didn't use self-rising flour.  Remember the recipe for self-rising flour is 1 cup AP flour, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt.  Maybe the difference was the egg: anyway I got exactly what was advertised - within 5 minutes anyway.

Later...

I used the exact recipe this time (only 2 eggs) and it turned out as before - just as light and fluffy as a box cake.  The cook time is still 35 minutes for me.

The batter tastes just like yellow cake. I think this recipe and others like it are rating poor because of the "Self Rising" flower is not being used.  Add 3 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt to the "All Purpose" or "Cake" flour.  Follow the recipe and pour the milk in slowly.  
Cheers

I did as other suggested(using 3 eggs), cake came out just good, the 2nd time I  added 1 box of instant vanilla pudding to the dry ingredents, 3 eggs, and 1/4 cup of sour cream and it was fantastic. I used two 9in pans, cut each cake in half, making 4 layers with frosting between each. It was SO GOOD  my mother asked for the recipe and she's a "old school" baker, everything she makes is from scratch and always good.

Not very tasty, and does not make good cupcakes. I have my own bakery business and I do not recommend this recipe.

***IMPORTANT NOTE!*** Simply use self- rising flour, follow the instructions, and don't beat the batter too much! I was a bit dubious about even trying this recipe, seeing so many conflicting reviews from other users. Despite my doubts, we tried it. And it turned out great!! All 7 kids loved 'em (we made cupcakes with Hershey cocoa frosting). So, I was satisfied. :) 
Simply follow simple directions, and have a simply delectable treat! :) :)

Made this recipe twice- once exactly as written and second time substituting butter for the shortening and adding about 1/4t salt (1/2t if using unsalted butter)...much tastier this way! Changed the procedure as well after reading some articles and other reviews on the website. First make sure butter, eggs and milk are all room temp.  Sift together flour, sugar and salt, twice if you have the time. Combine all wet ingredients except butter. Whip up butter really well on its own. Then alternate dry and wet when adding to butter, taking care not to overmix at this stage.  I added choc chips and made cupcakes, came out great- really tender and moist- and actually tasted even better a day later.

I tried this recipe following DANHARGRAVE'S recommendations.  I only used 2 eggs and alternated adding the liquid and the flour.  The cake was light and fluffy and a good substitute for a yellow cake mix.  The cook time in a glass pan was around 32 minutes.

I made this recipe into cupcakes, and took them to a picnic. They were devoured! My nieces and nephews wanted more, and my kids ate the remaining 4 cupcakes in our fridge as soon as we got home! I used AP flour and added the baking powder and salt as another reviewer suggested. That was the only change though. Very good!

This turned out perfectly, and tasted just like yellow cake from a box. I did use 3 eggs based on others' suggestions.

What a wonderful cake!!  I was making a pineapple upside-down cake, and couldn't get to the store for boxed pineapple mix.  I found this recipe, and added 3/4 cups pineapple juice to the mix, decreasing the milk to 3/4 cup.  It took about 40 min to bake, and was AMAZING.    I'll be making this again without the pineapple, and probably keep the milk at 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 cups just to keep it extra moist.  I didn't have self-rising flour, so I added 1-1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt to the recipe and it was perfect.  Thanks for a wonderful and easy cake recipe, I hope I won't ever have to turn to boxed mixes again!

I added one egg after reading reviews.  Also used all purpose flour and added 3 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt.  Made perfect cupcakes and I will never look for another yellow cake recipe.

These cupcakes are don't require a ton of ingredients (which I like) and are easy to make. I substituted butter for the shortening to make them slightly healthier, used 3 eggs, and I did use AP flour & added 3 tsp baking powder in place of the self-rising flour.  The texture of the cupcakes is moist, but a little dry around the edges (that could just be my oven baking them too fast around the edges). They do taste VERY similar to boxed cake mix which is what I was looking for. Next time, I may add a little more vanilla extract juts to give them a little more vanilla flavor.  Bake time for the cupcakes was 18 minutes at 350.

Hopefully, the photo I took of the cupcakes I made from this gets accepted so that you can all see the lovely results.  The only changes I made to the recipe were a stick of unsalted butter (instead of shortening), 1/4 tsp salt, evaporated milk (instead of reg. milk) and 1 tsp of baking soda (as I used all-purpose flour instead of self-rising).  I baked these for just 20 min; they are glistening and moist and have a gorgeous color.  Not sure what everyone else has been doing wrong, but perhaps they should stay away from baking.

Very good. I made my own self rising flour as well. If you want to make cupcakes out of these make sure you make 24 of them. I made 12 and they were huge and took forever to bake. Didn't look as appealing as they should have. I guess everyone had a failed experiment now and then. They tasted great though.

This is okay (I made it as-is) but nothing to rave about at all. It's not very flavorful and needs a lot of icing to make up for the lackluster center.

This was very easy to make and came out delicious and fluffy. I wouldn't say it's exactly like a box-mix yellow cake, but it is quite good.  I did follow the advice of the other commenters and added a third egg, plus baking powder and salt to my flour. I used two 8-inch pans, as that's all I have right now, and the cooking time was 35 minutes exactly.  I would definitely make this again. It's an excellent recipe for making a quick and easy cake with few ingredients.

I have to admit that I don't make cakes from scratch. However, a few months ago, I needed a b-day cake in a hurry and did not want to go to the store yet again that day.  So I found this recipe and made it.  The kids loved it!!  Even for a no scratch cake baker like me it turned out great!!!Will make again.

Excellent!...thanks for sharing.  I did the AP flour with baking powder as well as an extra egg.  I also doubled the vanilla and snuck in a tad of almond and coconut extract...about 1/8 teaspoon of each.  Super moist cake...one of my new favorite recipes.  As a previous reviewer said...follow simple directions.  Impossible for the cake to flop!

I used this recipe for the start of pineapple upside down cupcakes. Definitely could've been better.  I ended up throwing away about half of them because they got moldy cause nobody really cared for them.  I did substitute pineapple juice for the milk; maybe that's why they turned out kinda dry.  I won't use this recipe again.

This was okay, but not what I would call "really good".  Now I can at least say that I tried it, but I wouldn't use this recipe again.  There are a few other Yellow Cake recipes that I'll try for now.

First off, I am not a fan of home made cakes.  I find them too dense.  I made this cake and it wasn't as dense as most of the other homemade cakes I have had in the past.  But it was far from fluffy.  It's flavor was good, but texture wasn't my favorite.  i won't make this cake again

I just finished making this recipe- and it was excellent! I made 2 dozen muffins instead of a cake, and they turned out divine. I think the reason most reviewers are not getting the best results is due tot he fact that they're not really doing the 'self-rising flour' themselves. It's really easy, there are suggestions on doing self rising flour in the other comments. Aside from that, this recipe was a dream- spongey, sweet and delicious!

The cake was very easy and quick. I used butter instead of shortening, and we loved the results - it was delicious. I frosted it with the Decorator Frosting from this website. Also, I cut the recipe in half and did one 9-inch round cake layer, because I know I'll eat the whole thing no matter how much I make!

I just made this recipe and it is great! Because I didn't have the self rising flour, I used all purpose flour and added 3 teaspoons of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt.. Better than the box.. Very moist and soft too.

I agree this was a heavier cake, and had a little baking soda taste to it (???), but it wasn't bad.  I used it for a jello cake and took it to a pot luck.  No left overs, so I guess that says something!  Good recipe when you don't want to go buy a box cake mix.

Not sure what everyones problem is with this recipe, its just plain simple. Follow the directions, use the correct flour and bake. Came out perfect, watch the shorting since if you add too much it will be super moist and soft!!!(don't talk on the phone while measuring) ha-ha 
thanks for the quick recipe. Add buttercream frosting and you have one perfect cake!

Terrible! i read the reviews and used the suggestions. i added another egg, the baking powder and salt. Cake stuck to my greased cake pans horribly and was a crumbly mess. Good news is that i was only baking it for my dog's birthday

This was ok, but I dont know that I would make it again.  I did not have self rising flour, so I did add the baking powder/salt like othe reviewers suggested.  It rose up nicely and I thought it was going to be nice and light, but it really was more dense almost like a shortcake.  It also had almost like a crust on it - maybe I over baked it, but i only baked for 30 minutes and at 325 degrees because I have dark pans so I dont think that was it.  It was nice and moist, but again, more like a shortcake.  I made it to serve with berries and whipped cream, so it was fine for that, but definitely nothing like a boxed cake.

This recipe was a terrific base.  I made my own self-rising flour (2 cups all-purpose flour, 3 tsps baking powder, and 1/2 tsp salt).  As for additional ingredients to the ones listed in the original, I added an extra egg, a packet of sugar-free butterscotch pudding, and 1/4 c light sour cream.  It turned out an amazing texture and flavor!  I went all out with chocolate frosting and whoppers on top for Mother's Day, but this would be equally good with just cool whip or homemade whipped cream.  YUMMMM!

These were not to my liking! I followed recipe exactly (with self rising flour) except I did use 3 eggs instead of 2.  They had no taste--even my 3 year old wouldn't eat them.  Will definitely go with the box next time.

I cut the recipe in half cause I just wanted a quick fix (and it's just my husband, one yr old son and myself). It did the trick but did not taste just like the box. Maybe I should of added more egg like others suggest. Kids would still love it though.

This cake wasn't very moist and it was pretty dense. It tasted okay. It wasn't as good as a box yellow cake mix. I definitely used sel-rising flour, so that wasn't the problem. I used three eggs based on other reviews

This cake was the best  cake I've made in a long time. Very moist and had a wonderful flavor. I followed the recipe, made no changes, and used a 9x13 pan for a sheet cake. I made the Chocolate Butter-Creme Frosting (also from this website) and the whole thing was awesome! I am doing it again for Mother's Day.

This is a great and easy recipe.  I needed to make a cake from scratch because of a cottonseed oil allergy.  This is found in most cake mixes.  I followed the suggestions of substituting butter for shortening and adding an egg.  I did use the self rising flour.

I used this cake as a base for upside down pecan coffee cake.  The result was not fluffy as others described it, but rather dense.  I hesitate to say that this is a bad thing because the buttery density is actually quite delicious with the pecan/brown sugar topping.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  I will use it as written for a dense, simple butter cake,and if I want something lighter to frost, I will add a pinch more baking powder and an extra egg white.  This is a good basic recipe that I can play with.  I absolutely LOVE that it calls for self-rise flour.

Very good cake!  I added an extra egg. I didn't have self rising flour, so I sifted cake flour, a pinch of salt (1/2 tsp) and 3 tsp of baking powder.  I also used butter flavor shortening.  Yummmmm...good!

This went together in no time; I was very pleased with the resulting cake, and a bit surprised at how (too, too) easy it is to prepare that many calories' worth of temptation for just the two of us. Could spell trouble!

An absolutely delightful, soft, fluffy cake.  Beware - do not use for cupcakes, allthough most reviewers have had success, I found the cake was simply too light and fluffy, and when we try to remove the paper the cake just disintegrated.  This is the only recipe I use for a standard cake pan, however and I would challenge anyone to find a better recipe.

This recipes is great, I am now making my third one for the weekend.  The first one went so fast it was surprising.  I must say that I used the 3 egg recommendation and it work very well. I will use this for now on when I need to make a cake.

Very good flavor, crumb texture not as fine as box cake. I'm not much of a baker, but it saved me a trip to market for a box cake. My husband thought it was great and I  would certainly make it again.

I had to use the other reviewer's substitution for self-rising flour.  I also used 3 eggs instead of 2.  The texture of the cake was great!  I used this as a base for an apple cake.  The final product tasted a little salty but I may have mis-measured the salt in the flour.  I would definitely use this recipe again.

Super flat and dry. Not good at all. It was fast, but not worth it.

Great, versatile basic cake mix. that comes out super fluffy. Easy to add fruit preserves, marshmallows or other extras. It's come out equally well using shortening, butter, oil or a combination of them. My family gobbles up this cake every time I make it. IMPORTANT: If you don't have SELF RISING flour, it's absolutely necessary to add the missing 1 tsp salt and 4 tsp baking powder to avoid a flat, overly dense cake.

This does not taste like a boxed cake mix. It’s much better. I followed this recipe just as written and it worked beautifully-was not too dry at all, and I even used gluten free flour instead, which tends to produce dryer results and this cake came out perfect. The layers were a little skimpy, so they ended up being not as full or rounded as a box cake would be, but it worked out perfectly for a four layer cake as I made. Didn’t have so much excess to cut off from the top before putting the layers together and frosting.

A bit drier than I expected ... maybe a little applesauce next time. But the cake is light, and a good quick cake.I also used the extra egg. Slightly cornbready ... not too much.

I added lemon zest  from a lemon to the batter with a little of  the juice then after cake cooled I made a fresh lemon juice/powdered sugar glaze to pour over the top.  It turned out really good without too many calories  and very refreshing.  I did use cake flour instead of self rising . Thanks!

I used butter since the shortening was hiding from me and added 1tbs lemon zest. It was pretty good! It could have been a tiny bit moister though.

I live on an island and the only way off is by ferry.  I needed to make a cake and didn't have a cake mix.  This worked out PERFECTLY!  It is better than a box mix and just as easy to make!  I'll be using this from now on....

I used 1 stick of butter to replace the shortening  and added an additional egg (3 total).  I was making Pineapple Upside Down cake so I used the one cup of juice from the canned pineapple rings instead of the milk.  This made a large (12") plus a small  (8") iron skillet, upside down cake.  Talk about a keeper!  My husband inhaled the large one, almost by himself. The other one went to work with me.  My co-workers were  beyond delighted. So moist and tender.

Very moist, super good. But thought it was strange that there was no baking powder called for, so added 2 teaspoons baking powder. Also substituted unsalted butter for the shortening.

I used three (medium) eggs, 1 stick of butter and about 1-1/2 cups buttermilk instead of 2 eggs, shortening and milk. It came out great, nice and fluffy and tasty. I don't know what the naysayers did wrong, but I'm guessing they used AP flour which would have made it dense if they added no rising ingredients to make the AP flour SR. Oh, the buttermilk gave it a great, tangy flavor, which needs no icing or frosting

I also just mixed everything together at once and it still came out lovely. I will make it again.

I made this with 3 eggs and sour cream as some reviewers suggested.  I also had some black walnut "dust" so added that to the flour (about 1/4 cup).  Gave it very mild black walnut flavor.  All in all a good cake.

I can’t believe anyone would say this was heavy or dense.  Perhaps the difference being that I was taught to always sift a cake. This recipe does not specify that step but I think it’s important when making a cake. I This is a tender cake, almost to the point that you have to refrigerate it before frosting it so it doesn’t tear the cake.  It’s delicious, quick and easy and my go-to yellow cake recipe.

I was hesitant to make this recipe after reading the less than positive reviews, but I just let mine cool and so far they are gorgeous, perfectly coming out of the pan and perfect consistency. I used all of the ingredients but subbed butter for shortening and added dry vanilla pudding mix to the batter before baking. I followed the suggestion from the review to sift the sugar, AP flour, and salt tough together (did it twice) and using room temperature milk, butter, and eggs. If it tastes anywhere close to as good as it looks, this will go into my vault of basic yellow  cakes that is anything BUT basic and so easy!! I plan to frost using the double chocolate cream frosting from this website, as well! I'll update my rating after I've treated it and post my pics later. Thanks for the great recipe and helpful tips!

The flavor of this cake gets five stars. But unfortunately it disintegrates at the slightest touch. I made this cake to use in a trifle. I followed the recipe exactly, no changes whatsoever. The texture is nice, and the flavor is great. But unless you're planning on eating it straight from the pan with a spoon, don't bother making it. It would be useful for cake pops, which require crumbled cake, but not suitable for anything else. After attempting to cut the cake for the trifle, I ended up with a few cubes and lots and lots of crumbs.

I used this recipe this past week for my autistic son thats on a GF/CF/SF diet.The recipe that i used for the self -rising flour was first making all-purpose flour from the book"cooking for isaiah" then adding the correct amounts of potato starch to make it self-rising.I used almond milk for the milk and YES i used the shortening.I did use 3 eggs because I have found in the past that GF/CF/SF Flour and mixes tend to be dry.This was a wonderful cake mix and will be used again for us.yes it was a little bit heavy(more like pound cake)we cut fresh strawberries and frosted it with an icing made of fresh strawberries.

Yummy! The batter made 6 large cupcakes and a small loaf.  They start smelling up the house after 7mins in the oven. There where so moist and spongey.  

I added 3tsp of baking powder and 1tsp of salt to the 2cup flour and stirred them realy well with a fork (10min).  I only used 1cup sugar but I wish I had used 1/2cup (I like things watered down).  I added 1 box of cook&serve vannilla pudding & 3eggs and 1 tblsp of vannilla extract.  I added the eggs in 1 by one slowly while using my hand mixer till all was creamy (no lumps). 

Preheated at 375 & turned down to 350 to bake for about 25mins (or so).  Perfect they came out bright yellow with narry a brown spot on the sides or bottom. Perfect. Yeyy! See pics I upload

I'm proof of why this got such bad reviews! I used all purpose flour and it turned out horribly! It was dense, tasteless, and I couldn't swallow it. I read the review and found out how to turn my flour to self-rising, I tossed out the first batch and remade it the way it was suggested. Best ever! Yellow cake is my favorite, it wasn't as yellow as I wanted it so I added 15 drops of yellow food coloring. And topped it with home-made chocolate frosting!

This cake tastes nothing like boxed yellow cake. I cant seem to find a good yellow cake receipe. I was worried right after I made it because even though the batter tastes alright it didnt look yellow at all which just didnt seem normal. When it came out of the oven it was flat and VERY dry. It reminded me of a sponge cake because it was so dry and airy.

The first time I tried this recipe I added an extra egg, like the reviews suggested. The cake turned out semi-fluffy with good flavor, but the layers were very thin. The next attempt I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect! Light, fluffy and wonderful flavor. This recipe is a keeper!

Used this to make a Honey bun cake with since I didn't have a yellow cake mix box handy. I followed another reviewers advice and used a stick of butter (no shortening) and added an extra egg (honey bun cake calls for 4 but only used the 3). Also followed the recipe using milk and omitted the oil from my recipe for the Honey Bun Cake. Ended up having the best one I've ever made. Extremely moist. Don't think I'll ever use a box mix for it again. Cake was gone in less than a day. Thanks for the terrific recipe.

My kids loved it. thats why Im giving it 4 stars. I added the extra egg, but I used (salted)Butter. Since I am not a salt eater, this combined with the SR flour made it a little intense. I will use unsalted next time.

I used this recipe as the base cake to make the "Creamy Orange Cake" recipe on A/R.  I wanted to find a quick "from scratch" recipe because I scaled it to 1/2 a recipe and made a 9 inch cake.  This cake was perfect for that!  I am sure I will at LEAST use this recipe as a base for poke cakes in the future. I only used 1/2 c of sugar (a little less than the 3/4 it would have been for half of the full recipe)  I also may try to use applesauce in place of shortening to lighten it up.  I can't vouch for this cake 'stand alone' as it was doused with jello, but it certainly did serve my purpose well!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was okay, but me and my friend tweaked it a little bit for cupcakes. Because it was so heavy and thick the first time, we used a 1/2 stick of butter instead of shortening, and substituted 2 egg white for the eggs, and beat them separately, and folded it into the mixture at the final step. This resulted in really light, fluffy cupcakes. Just make sure not to overfill them!

This recipe is exactly as advertised.  It is a quick, easy recipe which is almost identical to the results attained with a box mix.  The texture and color of this cake are fantastic.  For my personal tastes, the cake was a wee bit bland--something fairly easy to remedy.  Others, however, thought the taste was perfect.  Regardless, I will make this cake again.  Thank you.

Just made this cake.  Have not tasted it yet but have cooked and baked for many years.  It seems this cake is more like an old fashioned cake, not a ready mix (Box Cake). That is not bad, but it will not be light and fluffy.  Probably will not make it again.

The top is really nice and crusty, and the inside is soft... not bad... I did make sure my ingredients were room temp, and beat for a really long time after each addition of ingredients. Also, I used less sugar... (half as much as flour... 1cup flour to 1/2 cup sugar) and it was plenty sweet for me. Also replaced shortening with butter.

I had changed a little with this recipe, I added a little baking powder, and some vanilla.  I also used half shortening and half butter.  It still did not help the bland taste.  I do not reccomend this recipe.

I have been looking for a good "from scratch" recipe to make fresh fruit cake. After trying several, this is the one. Just pour the fresh fruit on top and bake. The fruit mostly settles to the bottom, but some remains through the cake.It did take 35 minutes to bake, but it is worth the wait.
I am a hobbyist cook, otherwise, I cook and my wife cleans up after me.

The cake came out ok, I added the baking powder because I didn't have self rising flour, and it came out good. But to me it didn't taste like a yellow cake, but more as of a muffin.
