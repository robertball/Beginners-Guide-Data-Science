These are good – too good.  I’m familiar with the light, crispy, sandy texture that the powdered sugar/oil/cream of tartar combo produces in a cookie and these turned out just as I imagined they would.  I wanted a really cinnamony cookie so I tasted the dough and decided to double up on the cinnamon.  Even at that, however, they weren’t overly cinnamony so I was glad I had made the addition. Diehard cinnamon lovers may  want to add even more cinnamon and/or add cinnamon extract or cinnamon chips.  But make no mistake – sticking to the recipe just as is would have produced a great cookie too!  The dough was a little on the goopy side and I was almost tempted to add more flour, but after a few hours in the fridge it was just fine.  I rolled the cookie dough balls in sugar as well as flattening them with a sugared glass and placed them on ungreased cookie sheets.  Not a fancy cookie but still a beautiful, sparkly, tender, cinnamon-sugar cookie.  Loved ‘em.

I wish I could write a review without rating. I may revisit this rating.

I made these as I was out of molasses for another recipe.  I thought the butter and oil ratio seemed high but as a knitter, there is a saying: "Always trust the pattern".

When my dough was mixed, it was extremely gloppy and could not be rolled into balls properly. I did separate the dough into individual portions and 'rolled' into a cinnamon and sugar mix. 

I love cookies with oil in them as that gives them a 'melt in your mouth' quality and one can make a crispy outside by rolling in sugar. One can take some sugar from the recipe and put it on the outside if one doesn't want to add more sugar to an already sweet recipe. 

I disagree with calling these "Cinnamon cookies". The amount of cinnamon in the recipe does not lend to these tasting of cinnamon.  I added a Tbs of cinnamon in the dough and rolled them in cinnamon and sugar. They still were not very strong tasting but were very good.  

I know I'm all over the place with this review.  Basically, as the recipe is written I would not make again. I would, however, tweak this recipe and perfect it, except, one can find another oil cookie recipe here on AR and add cinnamon to taste.  

I'd rather not give a bad review for how a recipe tastes. Each has her/his own preferences and how can one rate on that?
It was how the dough consistency turned out for me, that I am not happy about. The final product, tho the dough was irritating to work with, was a mel

I LOVE that these cookies are light and crispy. I didn't use the colored sprinkles, myself. I formed balls with the dough, and then rolled the balls of dough in a bowl of cinnamon/sugar mix, then placed them on the cookie sheet and flattened them with the glass.

Awesome!

i like how you took this common recipe and added such a simple ingredient like cinnamon to change the taste. it gave it a sort of spice yet sweetness. but it didnt over-power the original sugar taste.

This is a great recipe.  No need to roll out dough and cut cookies to make evenly round cookies.  I used macadamia nuts and they were delicious! I think I may put a little less vegetable oil just because I'm grease-aphobic :)

After reading other's remarks, I halved the recipe (I just needed a few cookies to add on the side of an ice cream dish drizzled with melted dark chocolate mixed with heavy whipping cream) and instead of using 1/2 c. oil, I used 1/3 c. I also doubled the amount of cinnamon. The first batch I left rolled up and they were fairly thick (1/2 inch) after cooking. And fabulous. I wanted more of a wafer so smushed the second batch after rolling in cinnamon sugar (cinnamon sugar also on the bottom of the glass I used). Same fabulous cookie, just a little lighter and crispier. Will use this one again. Super easy. I wasn't even super careful when measuring. Dough was easy to handle. A+

good, but a little too sweet.  You might want to try adding a little less sugar.

Brought some to a meeting and they were a HIT!  EASY to make with my 4 year old too. *revised* I forgot about these (just for a little while) until I looked in my box.  Everyone loves them just as much this year!  Won't be forgetting this again!

These are great! They taste like shortbread cookies with a hint of cinnamon! The only change I made from the directions was that I combined the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and cinnamon ahead of time. Then I cream the sugars and butter so when that was done I gradually added in the egg, vanilla and flour mix. I also didn't them in sugar. I bake them for 10 minutes, and they turned out very soft and crispy! I also used a 1/4 cup to make bigger cookies and baked those for 15 minutes. They turned out just as great! Next time I'll add in more cinnamon to the recipe so I can taste more cinnamon!

Best recipe of Cinnamon Sugar Cookies!!! ( I have tried many) and this is my favorite by far!!!!
The only change I made was to use only 1/2 of teaspoon of cinnamon with the dough, and then rolled the balls with a cinnamon/sugar mix before flattening them with the glass (I only did this because my daughter likes them cinnamonny!!!!!
Thank you for posting this recipe!!!

Ok so I love baking and I wanted to make some sugar cookies for my fiance.  He loves them.  And and I saw this recipe and tried it.  I did as someone suggested and rolled the balls of dough in cinnamon and sugar before I baked them.  They turned out great and everyone loved them.  I'm making more this weekend and already have people asking me for them.

These cookies were delicious and very easy to make.  My daughter especially liked sprinkling on the colored sugar.
