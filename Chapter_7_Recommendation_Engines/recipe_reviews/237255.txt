This "Sekanjabin" recipe is for a syrup which can be used to make a drink (sharbat-e sekanjabin). Iranians like to dip lettuce leaves in the undiluted syrup as well for a refreshing summer snack. Thank you Desert Damsel for sharing your recipe.

This was very good, and very reminiscent of the "shrub" drinks of "olden times".

I replaced the Mint with 2 cups of Rose petals, and simmered them in the pot for 20 minutes, then strained them out.

I LOVE sekanjabin...
my grandma is the master of sekanjabin and my mom right after her. Sekanjabin has been used to cool the core body temperature for hundreds of years in Persia.
make the sekanjabin sherbet specially on those hot summer days when nothing else can cool your body. pour some of this amazing syrup in a glass of water and add ice. drink and you feel like you're just  born.
