Delicious! Thanks for the recipe! Perfect with a cup of tea. Dough was really sticky, so I put it in the freezer and then worked really fast to make the '8' shapes. Also made round circle cookies from the 'holes'. I haven't baked in awhile, and my boys gobbled them up. I still have some dough leftover that I am going to freeze (makes alot of dough). (: (: (:

this cookie is pretty good.  It does enhance tea or coffee.  It is a nice little treat.
