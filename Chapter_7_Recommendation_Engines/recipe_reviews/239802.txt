SO much better than I expected! I was only looking to use up some chickpea flour, but found a gem.  I can't stop 'sampling' them. 
The peanut butter flavor is just enough to offset the chickpea flavor, very subtle. 
I used only 3/4c sugar and 1/2c butter (what I had) and 3/4c oats. I added cinnamon, because everything is better with cinnamon :)  I might even use less chocolate next time (I can't believe I just said that) because the cookie flavour is just that good.
Thanks for a fantastic recipe! This will be a treat for my GF friends.

Excellent.  I substituted Spenda brown sugar for the regular brown sugar and 2 whites for the 1 whole egg.  I was afraid they were not baked enough because they looked basically the same after 12 minutes of cooking, but let them cool 5 minutes, and they were terrific.

These were so easy to make and smelled delicious when baking! The only small change I made was to add cinnamon (my husband likes cinnamon in everything!)They were a big hit with both my husband and son. What a yummy way to get fibre and protein!
