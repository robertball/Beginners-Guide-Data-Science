Best Jamaican Jerk dry rub I've used.  Beats store bought rubs and sauces hands-down.  I used it as a dry rub on Chilean Sea Bass, and the results were nothing short of incredible.

For the Sea Bass, I reduced the salt content - it seemed to high for seafood.  However, the recommended amount of salt works fine for meats.

This dry rub also makes a delicious addition to standard BBQ sauces.

The aroma of this was wonderful, both when I mixed it and then when I grilled the meat.  I scaled it way back for just a single use, but will make more and store it in a jar to keep on hand.  I had some boneless pork in the freezer, so made the dry rub into a paste using canola oil and let the pork thaw and marinate overnight in the refrigerator.  The meat was flavorful and tender.

This was way too hot for me and I love spicy food.  Next time, I will cut the cayenne in half.

We scaled back the recipe the first time because it was sooo much.  It came out absolutely awesome.  We had a group of friends over and make dinner with this and they went nutty.  So now we have made the full version and use it on everything.  Grilled Tilapia, Jerk Chicken...even Jamaican Fried Jerk Chicken...so good.  Thanks alot for this one!

I used this seasoning mix on boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I sauteed in a mix of olive oil and butter, about 4 minutes on each side.  I then served it with a mango salsa.  The spice had just enough kick in it to make one say "hmm, what's in this?"  It was a big hit!

This rub has decent flavor but it is not Jamaican Jerk. I've worked alongside a true Jamaican who would cook for us all the time and this rub does not taste like Jerk anything.

I've made a lot of different rubs for ribs, chicken, beef, pork chops but this might be the last one I ever make. It is that good! After I made it, I was a little worried with how it smelled and tasted, but after I grilled my chicken breasts, I was amazed at the flavor & aroma. I got my breasts moist with olive oil, put the rub on both sides and let it soak in for about an hour or so. Then grilled them up & yum! Even put a little rub on some yukon gold potatoes that I cut up  along with some whole garlic cloves some diced fresh ginger & sweet onions with a little olive oil all wrapped up in foil on the grill.  Made for a very tasty, easy & relatively quick dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

i made this for use in an experimental recipe.  My son is a huge jerk fan; "hotter the better" type.  His doesn't smoke me but all the rest of the famdamily can't go there with us.  So following the reviews i too made small changes: in place of all the salt i used half and the other half onion powder to cut back on the sodium (wife's sensitive), as for the hot i used equal amounts of chipotle, chili, and cumin to match the measure called for.  It is truly awesome and hits the profile accurately without being overbearing anywhere for all involved.  It proved to be "da bomb" on bacon as part of the experimental dish, was great on ribeyes.  We will try it on a B/C chicken this weekend.  OBTW, if you want to know how a spice blend will taste sprinkle a small amount on a slice of cucumber and insert it spice side up, chew.  If it doesn't overpower or seems light repeat putting the spice side down on your tongue.  That will give you a fair assessment of how a dry rub will taste.  Smoke will intensify the flavor but you will know real quick if you like it or not.  Thanks for the recipe and y'all for the input, it was a great help with a great recipe.  Thanks again to all for sharing!

I scaled this down to 4 servings and it was great!  I rubbed it on boneless, skinless chicken breats and threw it on the grill.  Everyone loved it.  I will make a bigger batch next time.

scaled it down to 10 servings. I am going to use it on steak tomorrow but I tried a little after I mixed it. The only thing I changed was 1/2 chili powder and 1/2 cumin since I don't have chipotle chili powder. Nice balance of flavors with a kick.

Forget the servings converter.  Use the numbers in teaspoons instead of cups.  Still makes enough to fill a spare spice jar!

I scaled it back to 4 servings for 2 chicken breasts. Marinated chicken for 1/2 day and then broiled in oven 15-20 minutes or until chicken no longer pink. Used the chicken in Mango Chicken Salad wraps :-) Yum

Excellent rub.  I cut back some on the cayenne, as suggested by others.  Used the rub on grilled chicken.  I am looking forward to trying it on other items.

I used this last night for dinner and it was fabulous! I marinated rib-in chicken breast with Lawrey's Jerk Marinade and put this rub on prior to grilling. The reviews were in agreement.....juicy and flavorful! It's going to the top of my summertime grilling list for a wonderfully different flavor profile.   ChefRed

This is a wonderful addition to my dry rub stash! I scaled it down to 40 servings, and used it on a pork tenderloin and froze the remainder! Amazing! My mom loved the dish so much she asked me for the recipe. I mixed up another batch of rub, gave half of it as a gift to her in a cute little glass container and stored the rest in my freezer. This is a classic! I recommend using best quality spices; Penzey's is my hands-down favorite!

After preparing and using Creole and Caribbean spice mixtures for a few years, I was looking forward to trying the Jamaican Jerk Dry Rub.  Even though I cut the cayenne in half thanks to other reviewers, it was still overpoweringly hot.  This surprised me since we usually love spicey food.  I was disappointed since I bought the chipotle chili pepper especially for this recipe and it was quite pricey.  I found there was much too much allspice in this recipe, as well.

excellent rub! I adjusted the serving size down to 6 and had enough for 3 steaks. Loved how the rub created a "crust" on the steak after it was grilled! Husband loved it! He eats ketchup on everything even if it has been marinated but did NOT use it on this!

Incredible rub. I don't make 832 servings worth, but I do make a bunch at a time and keep it on hand. It's so easy to reach in spice cabinet and douse it on any white meat. I've used it on both chicken (tenders, boneless breasts, bone-in pieces, etc.) and pork (tenderloin, chops) and every time it turns out nothing short of spectacular. Jerk chicken and honey mustard is a combination that you can't go wrong with!

This is very good, but it really doesn't taste like jerk chicken you get in Jamaica to me.  Very good though and a different dry rub with the clove and cinnamon taste.

The kids used this for pork loin chops as part of a social studies assignment where they had to make recipes from the Caribbean (scaled way down). It is hot, but very good. We made pineapple salsa to go with it and balance the heat. I think I'm going to make a batch to keep on hand.

I didn't have any chipotle powder, and I halved the cayenne as others recommended. I used this as a rub for a chicken I baked for dinner, and my boyfriend and I both loved it.

This was a good base recipe! We just reduced the serving size to 20, and then modified the salt and the cayenne pepper so it wasn't too salty and spicy! It reminded us of our honeymoon in Jamaica where we had the best seasoned lamb legs ever. Thanks for sharing!

Great on wings!  Made these for the Mayweather v Maidana II fight.  Like Drake said, "0 to 100 real quick!"  They were gone; with a lot of cleared sinus too!

This seasoning blend was fantastic on chicken thighs!  I reduced the recipe by substituting the word "cups" with "teaspoons" and then cut those amounts in half.  I had enough to fully season 4 chicken thighs and some leftover.  I thought the amount of cayenne was quite a bit so I reduced that (from 4 to 3) and it was perfect spicy for me who likes some "zip."  If you don't do spicy foods well, I'd take it down even further.  This paired amazing with a side of rice made with coconut milk and with chunks of pineapple/mango/banana.  A tropical dinner of sorts!  I will be making this again & think it would go great on pork chops also.  I didn't have time to marinate either, so that's something to try for me in the future (still good without!)

I use this rub on EVERYTHING!  Fish, chicken, pork, beef, veggies...  It is DELICIOUS!!!  Obviously, we convert the recipe down to a more managable size, but with as good as it is, I can see why it is so large, we would go through that much in a couple of months.  My favorite is using it on salmon.  It pairs well with the flavor of the fish.

It IS spicy, so cutting down on the chipolte and cayenne for those that don't like the heat should do that, but not take away from the flavor.  It is also extremely salty, so I cut down on the amount of salt I use.  Just taste it as you go.   I am SO happy I found this and MOST thankful to Lovinlife posting it!

Love this rub! I put it on chicken or pork.  To make a regular size spice bottle full, just change the serving size to 25.

I scaled the recipe back to 20 servings to use for a whole chicken.  It was very good though I would probably reduce the cayenne pepper next time since it was fairly spicy.

excellent!!! i know real Jamaican Jerk is supposed to be spicier, but the amount of heat in this recipe was perfect for my bf and i! Great rub for fish or chicken! Scaled down the recipe to an amount for a small spice jar (about half-cup)

I agree with another reviewer. There is way to much Cayenne in this recipe (and I like spicy foods). I think if it was cut down to 1-2 cups, it would be better. Otherwise the flavors mixed very well (I used it on some pork chops).

I’d rate it 5, but I had to do too much math before getting to mixing up the spices. 48 tsp per cup for anyone else ready to cut this down to a reasonable amount. This was pretty good on chicken legs.

I adjusted the ingredient quantities to make 4 servings and used the rub on four chicken quarters. Didn't want to have a lot left over in case it wasn't I was looking for. As it turns out, it was what I have been looking for in an authentic jerk seasoning. Next time I make up a batch, I'll make the full recipe and store whatever I don't use in my spice cupboard for future dishes. Nice!

Made a much smaller portion. I substituted the cup size to tablespoon size and still have plenty left. Used on grilled chicken legs and thighs.  Was delicious, the whole family loved it and ate everything.

I cut this down to 50 servings and I probably should have gone down to 25.  I cut the cayenne in three, added more garlic than was called for, and added a touch of ginger.
I was frying up two pounds of chicken tenders.  The results were fantastic.  Some people thought I used too much spice and I made a few of them with a lighter coating of spice, but I like jerk seasoning to slap me in the mouth with a BAM!

I don't know if this is comparable to a true jerk rub, but it was darn good! Used about 1-1.5 tsp p/chicken thigh (approx. 6 tsp rub mix for 4 bone-in chicken thighs, part of which some of the rub was added under the skin). Let the chicken marinade with the rub for 1 hour (longer time preferred) and grilled. The chicken was moist, tender, and flavorful. Scaled the recipe down to 25 and made a small container worth of the rub for future use. Can't wait to use this rub again!

If you don't want to make that much jerk  rub substitute "teaspoons" for "cups" and you will have a decent amount. One teaspoon of Allspice,  5 and a half teaspoons of garlic powder, etc on down the line. That aside this was awesome jerk! Everyone LOVED it! If you don't want it too hot (and it was hot!) halve the amount of cayenne. This was so flavorful it is my go to from now on. Thanks for submitting this recipe!

I scaled this one down from cups to tablespoons, then did a bit of taste testing before adding the cayenne. My son's palate dictated the cayenne  proportion, settling on only a rounded teaspoon.  While I would like a bit more heat, we tried this out on chicken leg quarters that I baked.  My mixed experience with jerk dishes in the past, led me to prepare the meal hedging my bets: inexpensive chicken pieces, a safe green salad,  mango salsa,  plenty of white wine.  This turned out so well that our dinner conversation centered on the many different ways we could use this delectable blend!  Guests at our frequent summer barbecues can expect a  (mild) Jamaican twist to much of our summer fare.

A seasoning worth keeping in the cupboard.  Fantastic on chicken and steak, especially for those cuts you plan to sear on the grill.  I'm certain I haven't scratched the surface of what this stuff is capable of enhancing. Highly recommend keeping a generous helping around for use though.

I cut this recipe back to about 2 servings and it was still a lot. I originally made this rub with plain chili powder because that's all I had. It was OK but not great. I bought some chipotle seasoning and added it to my mix and that made it really good.

CONVERSION to manageable portion:  This will fill a 4.5 oz shaker container: 2 1/4 t allspice; 1/4 c salt; 3 scant T garlic powder; 2 T sugar; 1 1/2 t chile powder (ancho powder works great!); 3/4 t ground cloves; 1 T thyme leaves; 1 T black pepper; 1 1/2 t cinnamon; and then there's the cayenne.  The recipe as written in this portion calls for 2 T which is way, way, way too much IMHO.  I use 2 t rather than 2 T which works out great - it has a kick but won't kill you or overpower the recipe.  I mix in a baggie, then pour into empty shaker container (see my picture in an old lemon pepper container).

Had decent flavor. I used it on chicken breast. Tried to copy a blackened jerk chicken breast dish that I like at a bar that I go to frequently. The seasoning could not duplicate the taste I was looking for. There was too much of a cinnamon flavor coming out in the meat. Didn't care for it.

This seasoning is awesome:). I just made it and cut the serving size dwn to 50. I used it to pan fry some boneless chkn thighs to top my salad. Mmmmmmmm!!!!! Just like the other reviews BE CAREFUL WITH THE CAYENNE. Put a SMALL portion in then taste and just add to your liking. And I also did not use the chipotle chilli powder. Its great w/o it. I plan on rubbing my thanksgiving turkey down with this before I fry it.

I just tried this recipe. Didn't have any chipotle chiles so I substituted mole powder, and I left out the garlic powder. Then I halved the cayenne.

Added the powder generously to boneless chicken breast and cooked on a hot grill. Everyone loved it except my roommate, who said it was still too hot. When you smell the powder, the clove is overpowering, though once it cooks the flavors are well-balanced. I made a dry rub that called for more sugar recently and it was really too much. This one definitely gets the combination of salty, sweet and spicy in the right proportions.

I have leftover powder, so I'll definitely be making again.

Made small amount of this rub, scaled back for a couple of grilled rib-eyes to try it on. Marinated for 20 minutes,wonderful flavor and aroma. Had a bit left over, rubbed on some chicken breast tenders, marinated half hour while I cut up some veggies for a stir fry. My 5 yrs old grandson ate two helpings, stating it was "the bestest chicken ever"...
Good enough for me, going to try it on a roast chicken today, thanks bunches. I keep a small bottle in the spice cabinet now.

Excellent results!  I made it for the crew at the firehouse last night and it received rave reviews. I also made a jerk inspired barbecue sauce that was used to glaze the chicken during the last bit.

Really authentic and takes me back to our annual trek to Negril.  I do change the quantity to 10 servings  which is plenty to rub all over 1 whole cut up chicken and I used 2-3 Tbsp. in a pot of collard greens with 2 Tbsp of hot cherry peppers cut up during the cooking of 1 bunch of fresh greens and round out the meal with black beans and rice or pink beans and rice any time I need a Jamaican fix.  Thanks for sharing and thanks to allrecipes.com for allowing us to easily adjust the serving size so we don't have to end up with 26 cups unless we want to.
