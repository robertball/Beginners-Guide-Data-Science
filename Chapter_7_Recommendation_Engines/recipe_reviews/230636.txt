This was delicious!!! I couldn't find the Italian Herb Sauté Express Sauté Starter so I looked up it's ingredients and added them my self. 1/2 stick butter, about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, no salt, crushed red peppers, garlic and onion powder, basil, sage, and rosemary. I was out of marjoram, oregano, thyme, and savory so just omitted them. I also made the linguini homemade with semolina flour. I then followed the ingredients and process as listed. I will make this again.

My daughter in law made this at my house and it was full of flavor!  We all loved it and I'm thinking this might even taste good with chicken instead of the shrimp, although this was a great meal as is!

Update:  If you don't have the saute express just use olive oil and butter or margarine and Italian seasonings, it is a great substitute and still just as flavorful and you can control the amount of fat.  Also, it tastes just as good with angel hair pasta, thin spaghetti, or whole wheat thin spaghetti.  This is quick and full of flavor!!

It's easy and quick.  Used already cooked shrimp, just din't saute it as long before adding other ingredients.  Turned out great!

This is a very tasty dish and very easy to make.  Unfortunately, Land o Lakes has discontinued the Italian Herb Saute' Express Sauté Starter ingredient.  As a substitute for next time, I will use an herbed butter.

I’ll be making this over the holiday. It’s very good. For anyone who does Sous Vide cooking, I recommend doing the shrimp this way. Awesome!  And FYI, I finally found the Italian herb sauce starter in the dairy section. By LandOLakes located by the butter.

Turned out great and my boyfriend loved it! Yes it was a little heavy but that's what you get when making a recipe with creamy sauce. It was quick and easy also! I would make it again :)
