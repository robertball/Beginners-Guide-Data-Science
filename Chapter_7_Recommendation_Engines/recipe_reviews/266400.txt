I made a couple of mistakes. Namely, bought packaged prosciutto. Sliced way too thin, and too narrow. Brie cheese sliced a bit thick.
Have to say though, was absolutely delicious. Used a sprinkle of Himalayan salt.
Taste was out of this world.
Will do this again, and perfect!
Canâ€™t post pic, was a little untidy, but highly recommend.
Thank you
