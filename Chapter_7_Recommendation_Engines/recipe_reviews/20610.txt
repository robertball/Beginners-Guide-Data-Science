YUM!  Made this today for me and my toddler.  He loved it!  I didn't freeze the banana so it would be easier for him to drink through a straw.

This was awful... The apple made it gritty and tart, the juice made it really sour. The best part was the banana... I will never make this again!

Okay, but won't be making again.  I froze the banana with the peel still on--perhaps peeling and then freezing is better, considering how difficult it is to get the peel off (should I have known that??).  Mixing 8 oz of milk with 1 1/2 bananas of medium ripeness is better and easier to make.  Bananas need not be frozen.

Good smoothie recipe.  Apples are usually not an ingredient found in smoothies due to their grittyness ( I'm assuming), but this tasted refreshing.  I didn't freeze my banana ( I was in a hurry ) and did add a tsp of almond extract.  I used a blend of carrot/orange juice and really enjoyed the mixed flavors and texture. Had this with cinnamon toast from this site. Thanks Jim!!

This was excellent! I used a red delicious apple and it was not gritty at all. My five year old liked it very much as well.

This was ok...different but ok.  I added a couple of scoops of fat free whipped cream in the blender to take away the gritty taste that everyone was talking about, and it turned out nice and creamy.  I just think that the apple brought a sour taste that I wasn't too crazy about.  Maybe it would taste better with a sweeter apple...unless tart smoothies are your thing.  But my 7 yr old son like it so we're giving it 4 stars.

A bit too much banana for my son's taste. Now use 1/2 banana or two apples.  Other than that, It's quite tasty.  Other fruit combos are next.....

Great recipe. Very tasty.  Try it with a bit of cinnamon and leave the skin on the apples for a bit of a variation.

Turned brown and was a bit sour - but I still liked it.  That was probably because I used a Granny Smith apple.  I stirred in about a tablespoon-ful of brown sugar and MMM it was good then.  I might try using mango or another slightly sweet juice, and not putting any pure sugar in.

This was fantastic after my workout.  No added sugar so it's all natural- certainly one way to get your quota of fruit!  I used a red delicious apple to great effect.

Tastes fresh, like applesauce with a hint of banana!  We used a granny smith, 
so it was a bit gritty, but we liked the texture--different.  We didn't experience it turning 
brown as in other reviews, but some types of apples brown quicker than others.
We'll make this again!

Very good! The Gala apples made it a little too tart for my taste, I think I will use sweeter apples next time, but will definitely make this again - very healthy, easy and tasty!

Nice smoothie, if you have frozen bananas on hand
This also needs to be served right out of the
blender. I let mine sit and it turned brown from the bananas.
But it tasted alright, as long as you can get over the fact that it's brown.

Really good smoothie. And I know it defeats the purpose a bit of a low fat smoothie, but I added a half cup of light ice cream. :)

This is a very yummy smoothie!  It is so easy and is made with ingredients I almost always have.  I used vanilla yougurt (organic) in place of the milk.  My kids think smoothies are a special treat!  i like the kind that don't take forever to blend and require ingredients that are costly.  This fills the bill!

This recipe was a cool, refreshing, nice summer beverage. I changed the recipe just a little. I used, five blocks of ice, 1/2 cup of plain dannon yogurt, 1/2 of strawberry-orange-banana juice, 1 banana, and one gala apple. I'm eating it right now, it's delicious. I reccomend it for any smoothie lover.

Definitely a good source of fruit in the day's diet!  Didn't have a Gala apple - only a Granny Smith and that was very good in it too.  I did add several ice cubes because the banana wasn't completely frozen and also a small amount of vanilla because in my opinion everything tastes better with a little extra vanilla.

Changed a few things based on what I had on hand: juice was strawberry banana, apple was Granny Smith.  Also addede 1 tbsp.  flax seed.  Tasted great!  Next time I'll double the recipe so we can have more!

This was good. I used coconut milk and orange juice with mango. I also threw in some spinach. Next time I make it I will follow the recipe as is. Thanks for sharing!!

This is the perfect breakfast for anyone who:
a) has "old" fruit that would otherwise be tossed out. (I'm single - it happens!)
b) isn't a breakfast eater but needs a quick boost.
I didn't bother to freeze the banana. I just threw in the brown withered thing and the wrinkly apple in with OJ and voila! A smooth and tasty meal replacement!

Wonderful recipe, I used Braeburn apples and it was great. (When I have forgotten to freeze the banana, I just add a 1/2 cup of ice.)

Delicous. I tried a varity of apples for different tastes. Tart, sour apples not quite as good as Empire or Macintosh, but this recepie leaves a lot of room for creativity and flavour adventures!

This was ok for a try, although I'd only make it again if these were the only ingredients I had. The apple made it thick and it didn't have much taste. Without ice it is warm and gritty. After I added one and a half cups of ice and a teaspoon of sugar it was ok.

This is wonderful in so many ways!   Just the way it is or sometimes I put frozen strawberrys in it, or frozen blueberrys instead of the apple.  Thank you very much This is a wonderful recipe.  I do use 100 percent pure orange juice its is more expenxive and/or takes time making fresh juice but it is well worth it!

I made the recipe as stated, except that I subsituted homemade applesauce for the apple.  It needed something more so I doubled the orange juice and added some plain yoghurt.  Plus I always put 1 tbsp ground flaxseed in my smoothies.  I prefer the Orange Banana Smoothie recipe I tried yesterday.  I guess the apple-orange-banana combination is a bit too muddy for me.  I probably won't make it again.  Although maybe it would be better with some cinnamon added.

I Loved this! I didn't have time to freeze the banana, so I added four ice cubes instead and it turned out great! I love how sweet it is without the sugar that most recipes put into these smoothies. This is one that I will defenately make again!

I made this because out of shear coincidence I had all of theingredients on hand, while I wasn't sure how the apples would taste (since their not usually used in smoothies) I made it anyway and to my surprise it wasn't bad.The reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the texture, it was gritty (it's the apples) I like my smoothies a bit creamier so I added about 2Tbs of vanilla yogurt. It's an ok recipe, but I think i'll stick to berries instead.

My 10 year old daughter absolutely LOVED this!  I broke the banana into pieces and froze it, along with the apple pieces.  I didn't have any orange juice, so I used Sunny D and she loved the flavor.  I'm sure she'll be asking for this over and over again!

My husband and I liked this recipe. However, we did make some changes. First, we used 3 bananas and 2 apples, omitted the OJ, and didn't measure milk. Second, the bananas weren't frozen because I hate working with frozen bananas. The apples weren't peeled (didn't see the point) and they were McIntosh (matter of personal preference, those are the only kind of apples I will buy). Due to the bananas not being frozen, we threw in some ice (didn't measure that either, just kept adding some until it was thick enough) and we also threw in some honey. The end result is yummy. I'm drinking it now. :)

Pretty good! Not the most amazing smoothie but still yummy and easy to make for those times when you don't have a lot of berries in the house. I added ice instead of waiting for a banana to freeze and also added a few drops of vanilla after reading some reviews about the juice making it sour. After drinking it, I think it would have been fine without the vanilla but I personally enjoyed the extra sweetness.

I made the recipe as is, and it's yummy!  Several people complained that the apples made it gritty, but it must depend on the type of apple.  It did not turn out gritty for me.  I used tart apples from a friend's tree.  And even with the skins on, this smoothie tasted great.  Unfortunately, my friend does not remember what type of tree she has.  In addition to making the recipe as written, I also added flax seed and vanilla protein powder to increase the fiber and protein.  Still tasty!

This was definitely one of my favorite smoothies I've ever made, if not the best. I froze both the banana and the cut up apple (I used a Fuji apple), didn't use quite so much orange juice, and skim milk instead of 2%. It was very thick and creamy, and packed with yummy flavor. Lots of people are saying it was grainy and too tart... not at all. I didn't notice any graininess. If someone is saying that this was too tart, they either used a sour apple, put too much orange juice in it, or are just used to smoothies packed with sugar and artificial flavoring.
 Bottom line: This smoothie was refreshing, flavorful, and has a  great texture. Will DEFINITELY be making again.

This is a good recipe, although I did make a few changes.  To begin with, I used a Braeburn apple instead of the Gala as that it what I had on hand.  I mixed a little lemon juice on the apple to prevent browning since that was a problem with other reviewers and it was not gritty in the smoothie.  Also, I added a few frozen strawberries which gave it a nice sweetness.  I added just a little more milk and a small amount of low-fat vanilla yogurt to make it a little creamier and to thin it out a bit.  Overall, this is a nice smoothie with just a few minor changes.

This is a great recipe! I don't know what people are talking about... If they think that its a weird texture then they need to blend it longer. I put more milk in mine and it was great!

Loved this recipe!  I did not think the apple made it gritty at all...however, I have a Blendtec blender which is very powerful. I also did not freeze the banana, so added some ice.  I am following the Paleo diet so this fits right in.  Will definitely drink this again.

Made 4 servings (plus ice and a handful of spinach to make 6 cups) to fill kidlets' cups and a quart jar for me. As is without the addition, kidlets loved it. Even with the addition, they still loved it. Will make popsicles next time.

I like making variations on this one,which is so easy. The bananas,orange juice,and milk stay the same. just replace apples with fuji apples,pears,and peaches...so far.

I tried this and subbed out a few things:

1/4 Cup of Rice Dream,
2-3 Handfuls of Frozen Raspberries
1 Banana (Chopped)
1 Gala Apple (Peeled, Cored, and Chopped)

In a blender combine banana, frozen raspberries, apple, and rice milk. Blend until smooth. Pour into glasses and serve.

Although this is more of a one serving thing.

I've tried it and it was the bomb dot com. But substitute some ingredients. Instead of a frozen banana, I used a raw and fresh banana and instead of orange juice, I used mango juice, you barely taste the mango! Love it ??

So easy.  Very good.  I used plain yogurt, instead of milk,  with a squirt of agave to sweeten a bit.  I used one banana and only a third of an apple.

This is a super easy and nutritious smoothie recipe which only uses 4 ingredients. Don’t throw away your aging bananas! Freeze them and reserve them for use in smoothes. This creamy recipe has a nice tang from the orange juice.

I was unimpressed with this. Replaced the milk with almond milk, and gala apple with pink lady. The taste was O.K., but the texture was unappealing.

I didn't think it was as tart as everyone claimed it was. On the other hand, I didn't fall in love with it. The smoothie was very gritty and the flavors of the bananas and apples didn't go well together. Overall, it was a refreshing treat, but I'm not sure if I would recommend this to a friend.

Very good. I like my smoothie very thick so I added avocado and I wanted to add some greens to it so I added some baby kale.  Instead of milk, I added some coconut water, just enough to get the blender running. Loved by me and my 16 month old niece. And yes, the banana needs to be frozen to make it thick and rich. And common sense would tell one they need to peel the banana first. That was a funny review.  Will make again. Thank you.

Just OK--a little bland.  Needs a little something--cinnamon or ginger.  Would probably be more flavorful to use 1/4 c.  vanilla yogurt in place of the milk.

It was pretty good, but the apple gave it an odd taste. I added some dark honey to mine and set the blender to the absolute maximum. Tastes pretty good now! (Though i did add a little too much honey...)

It was ok.  It was a good way to use my frozen Apple slices and frozen bananas.  It was creamy but a little tart so I added 2 packets of Truvia and a little cinnamon.  I might use a little less orange juice next time.

Since I can't have dairy at the moment, I made this using vanilla almond milk. It was ok, but I can see how using plain milk would make it very bland. I added 2 t of sugar, and 4 T of oatmeal since mine had a very watery consistency and I felt it helped a lot. But this recipe does need some tweaking to make it interesting.

I really loved this smoothy. I froze my banana and used fresh orange juice. It was delicious and creamy.. Will definately make it again. Thanks

I made it slightly different. I didn't freeze the banana and i used a pink lady apple. I will definitely make it again.
