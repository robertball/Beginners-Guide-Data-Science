I've never made turkey or even turkey breast before and this was a really easy recipe to follow.  The breast came out incredibly moist, juicy, and tasting faintly of sweet potato.  The apples and onions complement this flavor very nicely.  

I didn't have a cooking bag, roasting pan, or apple juice so I had to make some alterations.  Instead of apple juice and soy sauce I used apple cider vinegar and some extra salt.  Instead of a roasting pan all I had was a casserole dish so I could only fit half the fruit/veggie mis under the breast and the other half I roasted seperately.  Because I had no bag I had to baste the breast regularly with some extra liquid/seasoning mix and cooking the breast took twice as long as the recipe said it would with a cooking bag.

In the future I will probably decrease the sweet potato, increase the onion, and actually use the apple juice as suggested to get more apple flavor.

I didn't have an oven bag, so I missed out on what would have been some excellent gravy.  Otherwise, this was wonderful.  The sweet potatoes had a great flavor, and the turkey tasted GREAT!  I don't think the apples really contributed much though, so I may leave those out next time.
