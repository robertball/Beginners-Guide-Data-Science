It sometimes seems that some of the most satisfying recipes/dishes arise when I'm leaving town and wanting to make use of what I've got in the fridge so it doesn't go to waste - and when a last minute trip to the grocery store seems wasteful. So with some remnants of red, orange, yellow and green peppers, a couple of chicken breasts in the freezer and a partial package of orecchiette (little ears) pasta in the pantry I threw together one heck of a fine meal with this recipe.  It comes together quickly and easily with a minimum of steps.  It uses just a few, simple, fresh and delicious ingredients with classic piccata style (lemon butter sauce and fresh parsley) flavors.  But five stars?  You bet.  Just because it’s easy, and just because it’s humble, doesn’t mean it isn’t worthy!  Other than not measuring precisely, and other than adding a little glug of white wine, I followed the recipe pretty closely.  Oh...and as always, in consideration of Hubs’ sensitive innards, I left out the cayenne.  (But if I was to add a little kick I would have preferred crushed red pepper flakes) As I mentioned earlier, I tossed this with orecchiette pasta and, to complete the meal, I served it with a Caesar salad.

This was a very good dish, but I admit I didn't "cube" the chicken breasts (I see now that doing so would allow more flavor to be absorbed).  I did add juice of one half lime to the lemon juice, however, and used one red / one green bell pepper for even more color!

It was pretty tasty, but not really worth the cost of all the produce and all the effort. If I had it at somebody else's house I'd definitely enjoy and compliment it, but knowing the cost and effort that goes into it I now know it's really not worth it. 

A few things to make sure of if you do decide to make it: It calls for way too much onion. The colorful peppers were nearly hidden by all the onion, and it made it look like there was very little chicken. Use half as much onion. Also, be sure not to overcook the peppers and onions - I didn't have this problem, but I could easily see it happening. Finally, add capers! Chicken Piccata just ain't Chicken Piccata without capers. (I've always considered them part of the definition of Chicken Piccata.) They add a lot of flavor and complexity to this recipe.

I served it over bow-tie pasta. I was glad I did, as it would have otherwise been kind of plain. Reducing the onions by half would make it look a lot less plain because the colors of the peppers would show better. 

All in all, a tasty meal - but one I probably won't have again.

Good, easy recipe.  I have to laugh at Marshall Gatten who doesn't think it's worth "all the produce and effort"!  He must usually eat TV dinners - that's the only thing easier I can think of, lol.

Excellent!  This combines some of my favorite flavors.  I used olive oil and an extra clove of garlic.  Make sure that you follow the recipe precisely to deglaze...it creates a wonderful sauce.  I agree that it might be a little better with the onions diced rather than in wedges, but that is a minor detail.

This was fast and yummy.  I chopped the onions instead of wedges.  Cooked garlic with red peppers.  Added herbs de Provence to sauce.  Cooked farfalle pasta separately, then stirred it into the chicken mix in the skillet at the last minute.  Yum!  Topped with a little pares am cheese.

I liked this.  I will use it some this summer as it is quick and not to heavy.  The chicken picked up the flavors nicely.  I added some italian seasoning to with the red pepper and i really like the complexity it added.  I also marinated the chicken in lemon juice, white wine, butter, salt and pepper overnight.  I think marinating is a good idea for this because it might be bland without it.  I served it over white rice for a nice simple and quick meal!

The wife and I both enjoyed this. I added some jalapeno pepper to incorporate it into the jalapeno rice pilaf we had made (also from here). I also added a tomato to it about a minute before it was done to add a bit more variety in the flavor. Came out great!

This was really good!  I served this over rice and it made a great meal.  I used red, yellow and green bell pepper and it was so colorful and tasty.  We will be having this again for sure.

There's lots to like about this recipe, and the wine selection is perfect, but nevertheless, as a major recipe tinkerer, I changed it up a lot.

In place of vegetable oil, I used extra virgin olive oil -- this is an Italian recipe, no?  (I suppose you can use vegetable and olive oil in combination if you wanted to save money, and reduce the chance of scorching.)

I used orange bell peppers only because it's what I had in stock -- they're similar enough to red in taste, and color-wise looked better in combination with the other ingredients anyway.  I cut them into small strips rather than dicing. (Yellow bell peppers might have been the ultimate choice.)

As for the onions, I was afraid they would take too long to cook and end up too bulky in the result, so I quartered the quarters.

At the stage of adding lemon juice, I also threw in 3 to 4 tablespoons of the Pinot Grigio and 2 tablespoons capers (drained!) -- we can't call it "piccata" without capers, can we?  Since there's more liquid at this stage, and I wanted to tame the capers a bit, I deglazed for 1 to 2 minutes.

One thing missing from the recipe was the stove heat setting.  I cooked at medium most of the time.

It turned out pretty well.  Yum!

UPDATE: I also forgot to mention that I separately cooked some angel hair pasta and served the piccata over that.  It was a scrumptious combination!

This recipe got two stars because the chicken came out pretty good and probably because I marinated it. My wife called the flavor "blah". The meal was very bland and overall disappointing.

A very colorful version of chicken piccata and so easy to achieve.  Agree with one reviewer that it could do with less onions and a bit of white wine as well as the lemon juice.  
Certainly going in my files for company dinners that I want to keep simple and attractive.

Very good!  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and reduced to 2 TBSP and used a sprinkle of dried parsley instead of fresh.  I also diced the onions instead of wedging.  Served over mini bowtie pasta as suggested by another reviewer.  This is a quick and easy dinner if the chopping is done beforehand.  Each serving is approximately 1 1/4 cups.

I give it 5 stars because it's a very nice meal that requires little effort and most of the ingredients were on hand. I served it with brown rice and I used half the amount of onion and diced it. I think 2 large onions would have been way too much.

Super easy and tasty. Had more flavor than expected with just the few ingredients. I saved time and money by using my grocery stores pre-cut frozen pepper and onion blend and used olive oil instead of veg oil. Do cut up your chicken to get the most flavor out of the dish.  I served over pasta and with garlic Texas toast. Will defiantly make  again

Pretty good, but I did find it a bit bland.  I meant to add capers and white wine as per one reviewer, but I forgot.  Also, I'll probably add a little more heat with red pepper flakes or jalapeño peppers.

This was a great Recipe. I made it with pasta and salad on the side and it was a great dish. I marinated the chicken with lemon, black pepper, and salt before I cooked it. But everything else I did as the recipe said. Both my husband and I loved it.

Very bland.  Did I do something wrong? Not sure how this has a four star average.

Good news . . . I used the left overs to make awesome chicken tortilla soup the next day.

This ended up being pretty bland.  Lemon didn't do much to brighten up the sauce.  This ended up tasting like an old family recipe we cook frequently and like better.

loved this! used a teaspoon of solid ready chicken stock to add flavor.  Also left just a touch of garlic and onion in pan to add flavor to the browning chicken. Light and very tasty!

This dish was simple. I followed the recipe. It reminded me of a stir fry. I would not make this for company or anyone I would want to impress.

Delicious! Slightly altered the recipe: used less butter and added mushrooms and a teaspoon or two of garlic powder. Otherwise, made according to directions and enjoyed very much.

This was very tasty and fairly easy to make. I tweaked it a bit from other reviews...used olive oil,added Herbs to Provence to sauce,topped with parmesan cheese.Will cut back on my pinch of cayenne pepper(cleared out the sinuses) and cut my veggies in strips rather than chop. I cooked angel hair pasta separately and added to pan. If you use strips, when you pick up a bite with fork you can get each of the additions on it!

I ended up making more of the sauce to drizzle over some side pasta or rice.  However, I've deviated from the recipe depending on what I had in the kitchen.  Sadly, I didn't measure or write any of it down, but everything has been tasty (sign of a good base recipe for me)!  I know one time I made the sauce creamier; another time I made it basically as the recipe stated, just scaled it up a bit.  Also, I used red, yellow, and green peppers to use them up and really liked the mix of peppers.

This was good and didn't take long to make. I used a bag of frozen peppers and onions with one lb of b/s chicken breast. Followed recipe and directions. Served with garlic butter pasta which made it a nice light dinner.

To me a recipe is a guideline and then I alter it to our taste. First I marinated the chicken in white wine and lemon juice. I increased the Cayenne and added garlic to the veggie mixture too. We tossed it all with bow tie pasta and it was delicious.

Boyfriend loved this recipe! I used a little white wine in the with the lemon juice. I also let the chicken sit in a ziplock of butter, garlic, and lemon juice before browning it. I used mrs.dash lemon pepper seasoning on the chicken directly to give it more flavor, too. The cayenne pepper gave it a wonderful kick. My bf is italian and he loved this version of chicken piccata !

Very tasty and colorful. I made a vegan version using Gardein veggie chicken. I also made a few mods based on other reviewers' suggestions: I added capers as well a bit of pepper and vegan parmesan at the end, and served it over spinach fusilli.

Ok, so I only had half a red pepper, but would that really have added THAT much flavor.  This strenghtens my belief that 'tasty' and 'flavorful' are defined differently by culture.

This was good and it was quick and easy, too. I tripled the 'sauce' because I tossed it with some bow tie pasta. I added some capers and a little white wine to the mix  and served it with a nice green salad. Hubby liked it, I liked it. Well done! Thanks!

Great recipe and I followed it exactly.  It's quick and easy.  No tricky techniques and it's so versatile that it can be served with any number of sides, I served mine with some linguine.  I also love that it's just one pan.

Very good!  I used boneless thighs, cubed, multicolored peppers, in strips, and regular yellow onions, also in strips.  Didn't have parsley, but it was still colorful and delicious.

I thought it was just ok but my boyfriend seemed to like it alot.  I halved the recipe for the two of us.  I think I might add more lemon, garlic, or red pepper next time.  Just seemed a little bland to me.

I’ll definitely be making this again. I came across it looking for an alternative to chicken fajitas, and it was an easy way to get the whole family to eat healthy. I used paprika instead of the cayenne pepper and added thin slices of lemon instead of just the juice. Turned out great!

I made this twice.  The first time with chicken -- as some suggested, I added capers and white wine.  Yummy!  The sauce was so good, we thought it might go well with other dishes, so the second time I made it with large sea scallops -- also with the capers and white wine.  Also outstanding!

A tasty dish!  I only had 1 bell pepper, so added kale (goes nicely with the lemon) and a little zucchini that were in fridge.  I used olive oil.  Also added some nice smoked paprika in place of cayenne.  I'll cut back on the onion a bit next time and probably dice it, or cut into narrower strips.  Served with pasta.  Would be nice with rice or quinoa as well.`

I used crushed red pepper both when heating the oil before sauteeing the onions and peppers, as well as in place of the cayenne.  I also added a splash of white wiine and extra butter to make more of a sauce.  served over bowties.

I am giving this recipe a full five stars because it is so easy.  I used multiple kinds of peppers straight from the garden. This dish assembled quickly enough that I was able to put it together between stops at home before heading back out to a soccer game.  All I had to do when we got back home was make some rice. The taste of the dish was enough for me to go back for seconds!

My family LOVED this recipe. I added some boxed chicken broth and more butter to make more sauce.

I made this the other night because the recipe looked good and it got such good reviews. I used olive oil instead of veg oil, used a red pepper and a green pepper, added some extra garlic, white wine, and some sliced portbaella mushrooms, and served it over rice. It basically had no flavor.

This recipe was extremely good.  Would have never thought of putting garlic and lemon together in the same recipe, but it's restaurant quality like something that would be served at the Macaroni Grill.  Definitely a keeper!

I don't know if I made it wrong, or I just don't care for the flavor.  But mine turned out way to acidic and there wasn't any sauce when it was done, just really really lemony chicken.

This was really good and really easy - I used way more garlic, but other than that I stuck the recipe - YUM!
