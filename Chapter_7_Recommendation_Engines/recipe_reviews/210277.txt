I used blueberries and blackberries in mine, and honestly, I completely skipped the making the tarts bit. I just used a pie crust I got from the store. Totally admit it. If you want to make this a lot easier, I suggest doing that.

The raspberry jam + the butterscotch and berries mix, though? I'd recommend it.

But it's ONE HUNDRED PERCENT GOOD. Perfectly sweet, and according to my app, surprisingly healthy.

I used strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries in this, and because I was making it for my dieting father, I cut the butterscotch in half and used a little more jam to make up for it.  It was definitely plenty sweet, so I would probably continue to make it that way in the future.  The crust didn't hold up well the next day - the sauce made it fairly soggy, so I suggest eating it within the first day.
