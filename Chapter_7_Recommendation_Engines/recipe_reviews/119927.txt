We really love this casserole.  I make a couple changes to suit our tastes though.  I arrange the tater tots into rows so that there isn't any space in between them.  Then I spread a 16oz container of sour cream on top of the tots before I bake it and sprinkle on some shredded cheddar cheese and sliced olives during the last 5 minutes or so.  With these changes it's one of our favorites!

This was pretty good.  I used black beans and rice instead of ground beef because I'm a vegetarian.  I spread a layer of sour cream, cheddar cheese, and black olives under the tator tots and served the finished casserole topped with salsa.

What a wonderful dish!  Both my husband and I loved this.  I made a few changes for personal taste.  We don't care for onions in our house so I substituted the onions for 1/2 t. onion powder to add flavor.  My grocery store doesn't sell the nacho cheese soup, so I used a can of cheddar cheese soup and to add flavor I chopped 1 heaping T. of sliced jalapenos and used a 4.5 oz. can of diced green chilies.  I added these to the beef mixture at the same time as the taco seasoning.  I only used 1/2 c. water since the green chilies are a bit "watery".  I did have to bake this for an extended amount of time.  After baking for 55 minutes and the tater tots were STILL not browned I upped the temperature to 450, baked for another 10 minutes and they came out lovely, nice and brown and crunchy!  YUM!  I then topped it with 8 oz. shredded Mexican blend cheese as soon as it came out of the oven, then served with salsa and sour cream!  It was delicious!  Definitely a keeper!

I really liked this! I used cheddar cheese soup instead and also put sour cream on top along with shredded cheddar cheese. I thought it needed something, so I put salsa on the individual servings for those that wanted it.

This isn't exactly gourmet, but my family and I thought it was delicious.  It was also very quick and easy to make.  I found that if you want the tater tots to get crispy and brown you should follow the baking directions on the package of tater tots rather than the directions given in the recipe.

Amazing! I was vacationing for a week and the group made me make it 2x! Used cream of cheddar soup, added Mexican corn and a can of tomatoes w/ chillies. The best part was we diced up some jalape√±o peppers and threw them in. I let it cook for 35 minutes and then broiled for 5. Then threw on the extra cheese. Mmmmmm

Pretty good stuff.  Super easy to make.  I would definitely suggest following the tater tot baking instructions.  I baked it at 450 for 20 minutes and the tots were perfect.  I then pulled it out of the oven, put some shredded cheese on top, then put it back in for a few minutes to melt.  The kids loved it.

Needs jazzing up. 1 1/2 lbs of meat,instead of 2 lbs. Salsa added to recipe would help a lot. Top with sour cream.

I made this for my husband and I, thinking there would be lots of left overs for the week!  No such luck!! I had enough to take a small container to work for lunch. It was delicious - I'm renaming it Mexican Sheperds Pie! I only had regular cheddar soup so I added some authentic Mexican salsa sauce (not salsa, this is a concentrated hot sauce). I think next time I will try and sneak in some black beans for more fibre and a little more salsa for extra kick.

My kids loved this!  Only changes made were that I added cheese on top of the meat mixture and followed the tater tots heating instructions for cooking this...aka i heated the casserole without the tater tots for 20 min at 350 from the fridge then added tots and heated at 450 for about 18 min.  Super family friendly...my kids devoured it!

This was surprisingly good.  I only used 1.5lbs of beef I added a can of black beans, olives, and jalepenos.  I wasn't sure if the flavors would combine well, but it was just delicious!!!  I can't wait to eat the leftovers.

My family loved this! I didnt actaully have the nacho cheese soup on hand, so I put half the meat mixture in the cassarole dish sprinkled shredded cheese and the put the rest and sprinkled more cheese, then put the tater tots on top. I'm sure when I make it next time (with the soup)it will be even better! * I've also found that melting some Velveta in the meat mixture also works like a dream!

Good family meal.  I left out onions (son won't eat them), added a can of green chilies, and topped the meat mixture with shredded cheese.

This is a tasty casserole, but I have tweaked it for our own personal tastes too. Basically All I add is 2Lbs seasoned taco meat, the tater tots, but I use real shredded cheddar cheese approx 1 1/2 lbs (we love real cheese)  I bake the tater tots first, then brown the meat and add the taco seasoning. But here is the interesting part I put them in my slow cooker in layers first some cheese then tater tots, then meat and repeat. I keep it on warm setting and then take to pot lucks. It is a great easy meal that kids love. I have added salsa and sour cream on the side for those who are more adventurous, but for those picky eaters at the 4-H pot lucks it works well.

I am a first year school teacher who is also a newly wed and my husband loves this! The only thing I do different is add a little bit of green pepper along with the onion while the beef is cooking. I also use salsa instead of the water it tells you to use on the taco seasoning mix. Instead of the nacho cheese soup I use 4 cups of finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese between the beef layer and the tater tots. It makes for a gooey mix!

Good recipe for something quick to eat.  Instead of tator tots I used french fries and omitted the cream of mushroom soup and used the nacho cheese sauce from this website.  The kids loved it.  I also cooked the french fries for a little bit before putting together to make sure I had crisp fries.

Sounded better than it tasted!!

Was not one of the better recipes I have tried from this site.  Followed the directions, and substituted cheddar cheese soup for nacho cheese (per a recommendation from other reviewers), and the tater tots did not get crisp after cooking for the specified 30-35 minutes, ended up turning on the broiler.

Hopefully it will turn out better for everyone else.

I had to make this recipe twice to even get a taste!  I made it the first time on a night I was gone and there were no leftovers.  My hubby and boys just loved it.  I only use 1 lb hamburger when I make it, too.

We love this dish! We top the ground beef with black beans and corn. Then we top that with 2 cups sharp cheddar. (We don't use the cheese soup.) Then the tater tots and bake until they are golden & crispy! We serve with salsa & sour cream! If we have black olives & green onions, they go on top! Delicious!!!!!

pretty basic, but tasty enough and good for a family that can't agree on anything taste-wise.  Added salsa, since I couldn't find "nacho cheese soup" and had to use just cheddar cheese soup.  Think next time i will add chopped tomatoes and olives as well.

SO GOOD!  My boyfriend couldn't get enough of this tasty dish.  I pretty much stuck to the original recipe with just a few minor changes...I added black beans as well as 8oz of sourcream to the mix.  I also cook my tater tots while I was prepping the casserole so they were about half cooked and I also put tots on bottom of dish covered with mixture then added more tots to the top and covered with cheese when almost finished cooking and turned to broil the last 2-3 minutes to get the tots on the top crispy...very good!  This will be a regular dish in our house.

This was an amazing dish.  I made it both for my family and for a friend.  We ate every crumb, no leftovers at all.  I used a frozen bag of corn, and added a can of pinto beans and some salsa as I mixed it all together.  Also, since I doubled the recipe, I used plain and nacho cheese soup.  Also, I followed the advice of others, and cooked at 450 for about 20 minutes.  This is a new favorite for my family.

This is a good solid recipe and I give it 4 solid stars! I didn't have the cheese soup, so I cubed velveeta and melted it in with the beef mixture. As a result, the dish was not spicy at all. I will definitely make this again on a "comfort food" meal night!

Delish!!!!  We added cheese on top the last few mins and also completely covered the top with tator tots.  My son who LOVES tacos now asks for this rather than tacos!

I made something very similar to this, using this recipes concept. We used cream of mushroom soup instead of nacho cheese, as I dont like nacho cheese. We added mexican cheese mix on top near the end of the bake. Instead of corn we added tomatoes and olives to make it more like a taco casserole. It was realllly good! Just a little strong with the flavor. (from soup probably)

Awsome recipe! Instead of the corn, we used Mexicorn. (It's corn with peppers in it.) We all loved this one! Thanks for sharing.

This was a really good recipe for a quick meal. I didnt have nacho cheese soup so I used the regular cheddar soup with a can of chopped green chilies mixed in. I served ours with shredded cheese, chopped tomato, lettuce, sour cream, and salsa.  Kinda ended up being like tacos minus the shells :)

My fiancee made this for a small group of us last night and everybody loved it and asked for the recipe. She served it with shredded lettuce and Spicy Taco Doritos on the side and we crumbled and mixed them in to our own desire. It served 5 and the dish was licked clean. It was amazing. ;)

I would have given this one 4.5. It was a great recipe to build on. As written the kids love it and I like it but feel there is something missing. I have used both kinds of soups and that doesn't make a difference. I do add olives and scallions when it done- along with melted cheddar under and on top of the tater tots. I think what is missing is hot sauce as soon as I put on some hot taco sauce and sour cream it was much better until I think of something else in the cooking process. I like this recipe and can build on it. So easy too- thanks for sharing.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I have to agree with some of the reviews that it is a bit bland and the tater tots don't get cooked enough. Added tostitos salsa con queso, sour cream, and salsa for more flavor.

I made a cross between this and Tater Tot Casserole IV..  I used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef and 1 lb sausage. Cooked with 1/2 large white onion. Drained and returned to pan. Added taco seasoning and 1 cup water. Mixed in 1 small can mushroom soup, 1/2 cup salsa and two diced tomatoes. Poured a bag of frozen corn in my 11x15 and covered with meat mixture. Sprinkled 1 cup mild cheddar and topped with a bag and a half of tater tots. Sprinkled 1 cup cheddar cheese on top of tater tots and baked for 45 minutes at 350. This was delicious!!

This was YUMMY.....I did take advice of some reviews and added some stuff on my own....I used a half cup onion and can and half of cheese soup. Also used half cup sour cream...Think it was better the second day as leftovers.

Not bad for a kid meal, I found that the pan size is going to come into play.  To large of a pan and I don't think there is enough meat to tater ratio.

I make a casserole just like this one...with a few changes.  I use 1 pound of meat with 1 packet seasoning, an 8x8 pan, nacho cheese sauce or queso dip, and a layer of salsa.  Also I sprinkle the tots with lawrys.

Great  recipe I couldn't find the nacho soup so subed out cheddar cheese soup, and do agree that it needed a little spice added at the end, some hot sauce worked fine. I added the tater tots in a row also as someone mentioned and I turned the heat up to broil for the last 3 minutes before I added cheese to crisp up the tots worked great then added cheese and poped back in the oven for 1 1/2 minutes and viola perfect! Served with salsa, sour cream and tortilla scoops chips individually!

Very flavourful.  I also used only 1 lb. of ground beef but found there seemed to be too muchy liquid.  I simmered it for about 15 min. before putting it into the casserole dish to get rid of some of the excess liquid.  Will make again.

We actually really liked this.  I only used 1 lb. of beef and mixed a little salsa in with the meat after adding the taco seasoning.  I also used cheddar cheese soup since that's what I had on hand.  With some sour cream on top, it was pretty good!  Next time I think I'll add a drained can of Ro-Tel and garnish with sliced scallions, also.  It was quick & easy though so I'll keep it in my "repertoire!"

This tasted okay...a little disappointing because it wasn't appealing to look at. It's something different to have once in a while.

I really thought this was going to be better than it was. I thought it was too dry- maybe needed less meat or some cheese. I don't think I'll try it again though.

This was really good. I did add a few things. I put sour cream on top of the tots and cooked it uncovered for 30 minutes. I then add black olives and cheddar cheese on top and cooked it for about 5 more minutes. Will make again.

I made this exactly as the recipe says (except it needed baked for a lot longer to cook the tots) and my 5 kids and husband loved it!  Hubby and my teenage son put hot sauce on it and I also would mention that I think some shredded cheddar would be great melted on the top at the end of baking.

my family loved this casserole!  I did make a few changes and used some suggestions from other reviews.  I added chopped garlic and chopped jalapeno to ground beef, omitted corn (not a big fan) used jarred salsa and sour cream on top of meat mixture. baked according to package of tater tots, then broiled for about 5 minutes.   YUMMY !!!!!!!
