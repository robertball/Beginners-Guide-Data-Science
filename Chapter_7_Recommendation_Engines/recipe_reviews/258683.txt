This was absolutely delicious! I am a huge fan of both coconut AND almond so this was right up my alley. My daughter & husband preferred the Gevalia recipe we tried earlier this month featuring cookies & cream ice cream, bc they are chocoholics. I liked them both equally!

No need to brew a hot pot of coffee. That's already taken care of with Gevalia Cold Brew Concentrate. This recipe is great! Very refreshing and just the right amount of sweet! Will  make again!

My husband flipped over this delicious coffee drink!  It was sweet, thick, & creamy and had a wonderful blend of flavors from the coconut, vanilla ice cream, and coffee.   This is the perfect dessert or afternoon treat!
