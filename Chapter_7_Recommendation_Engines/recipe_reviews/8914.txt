We really loved this.  Instead of using the chow mein noodles, we used rice noodles from the can.  I also cut down on the amount of peanut oil.  I will make this over and over again for my family and friends.

We loved this salad!  I used spinach leaves along with the regular head lettuce.  I diced the chicen breast and cooked it in olive oil along with the green onion.  Once the chicen was cooked through, I added the dressing (in which I used the balsamic-blend rice vinegar) and let it simmer for about 15 minutes.  I poured the chicen mixture over the prepared salad and, being hot, it wilted the spinach.  It was SO good!  I was a bit late with the idea to add mandarin oranges, but there will be a next time, so....  I served this with egg rolls also found @ AllRecipes.

Our family really enjoyed this recipe. We added our own stuff to it and used top ramen noodles (dry) for the noodle part. Will definitely serve this again!

To give the salad extra flavor, put in "Japanese Chicken Wings" (using breasts, not wings) instead of regular chicken.

I've made this recipe several times and it has become an absolute favorite in our house. The dressing is the key (I add just a few drops of sesame oil but otherwise follow the recipe for the dressing to the letter).

All I can say is yum.  This salad disappered like no other salad.  I substituted random nuts from my trail mix for walnuts and it was still great.  Perfect for that leftover chicken that is no longer tempting alone.

The ingredients in this salad are fine except for the dressing.  What is a salad measured on?  It's dressing!   The ratio of oil to vinegar is way off.  A classic oil and vinegar dressing uses 1 part vinegar to 3 parts oil.  The vinegar in this recipe - although measured in Tablespoons equals about 1/2 cup, as does the oil.   The sugar - is about 1/4 cup.  This dressing is out of balance, either increase the oil or decrease the rice vinegar  or increase the sugar and it really needs to include at least a tsp. of black pepper.  Sorry, but we love Chinese Chicken Salad and dressing this isn't it.

Everybody loved this recipe.  I made a couple small changes like I used regular veg. oil that I had on hand, added a little bit of soy sauce for color, omitted celery and walnuts and added cucumbers to the salad!!  Delicious!!

This is a good basic recipe but to kick it up a notch I added mandarin oranges and about 1 T chopped flat parsley.  I also replaced half the lettuce with shredded cabbage and the walnuts with sliced almonds due to what I had.  I substitute ramen noodles for the rice noodles (just crushthem in the bag with your fist, toast lightly in a dry pan)... :)

Good recipe. I didn't have peanut oil, so I used sesame oil. Also, used ramen noodles. I think you could use less dressing than this recipe calls for. When we ate it as leftovers, it was pretty weighed down with the dressing, but still had good flavor.

Wonderful!  I served this with Chinese-style pork ribs and house fried rice.  It was a perfect light complement to some heavier soy sauce laden foods.  Excellent!

Great recipe!  Didn't have to change a thing.  My husband loved it, especially the walnuts (most salads have almonds or peanuts).  I think we'll be making this every week!

I had a diabetic friend coming for dinner so I made this without the noodles and used splenda in place of sugar. I also used pecans in place of the walnuts. All four of us just loved this and we will be enjoying this one all summer long!

This was soo good. I used 2 chicken breasts on the george forman grill and used a little Pampered Chef asian seasoning on them. I used 1 head of Romain lettuce. Instead of the noodles I used that "chow mein" in the asian section. It is crunchy and looks like little slightly curly sticks. I used almost the full amount of peanut oil but then added a few splashes of sesame oil. It gives it such a delcious nutty flavor. I did not use salt and it tasted great with out it. I also subbed toasted almonds for the walnuts. After the chicken was done cooking, I used my salad chopper (Pampered Chef) to shredd it and also added dressing to it to make it extra moist. I added it to the salad while it was still hot. I also added fresh mandarine oranges. It was the best chinese salad I've ever had!!

Made this today to today for my brown bag lunch. Left out the noodles because they didn't fit iin the bag.  Added mandarin oranges because it wouldn't be Chinese chicken salad without baby oranges!  Delicious!  Had enough for me and several coworkers!

This taste just like the salads I used to get from a tiny little chinese place. I have also substituted crunchy chow mein noodles,which work in a pinch.

This was good, but I never did find the Chinese noodles, even though I looked at a lot of stores. Not sure if I was looking for the right thing. The ones I bought ended up tasting awful. The salad was good though.

Pretty decent salad. I used tofu instead of chicken and it tasted good.

I love this recipe!  I used 3 oz of ramen noodles instead of the 6 oz noodles and I used a blend of spinach, raddichio, and other lettuces.  It was perfect paired with the homemade Egg Drop Soup.  I couldn't stop myself!

Four stars with a couple changes:  A couple tablespoons of sesame oil, a few craisins, pecans instead of walnuts, and soy sauce on the table for those who want it.  A bit of trouble with all the chopping and shredding but worth it.  I'll fix it again.

GREAT!!!I added the spinach leaves and heating the chicken and salad dressing for about 15 minutes and served. It was a big hit! They really liked it warm.

We chose to make this as a full meal for my husband and I and boy were we very pleasantly surprised!  This salad had a great flavor, total lightness that just left you wanting more!  And the left overs even kept nicely for lunch the following day!

The only thing we did differently was leaving out the green onions (I'm not a huge fan) and using sesame oil instead of peanut oil.  But still very good!!

We'll definitely be making this again, and are even eager to make it for a light salad for guests.

Great dish ! The rice noodles are wonderful instead of those heavy traditional ones. My suggestion is to use spinach not iceberg lettuce. More vitamins, and more flavor. But i would definetly tweak the dressing to your personal taste.

I absolutly loved this salad.  I did not put celery and sesame seeds in it, but it tasted fantastic!  I normally hate vinegar, but in this recipe, the peanut oil and sugar really balance it so it doesnt taste at all like vinegar.  I will definatly make this many more times!  Thanks!!!!

Perfect as is.  I served it as part of an Asian-influenced meal but it would be just as good as part of any meal.

Absolutely awesome!  It tastes just like what I get at a restaurant.  I didn't have walnuts so I used slivered almonds instead.  Delicious!

I used Roasted Garlic flavored seasoned rice vinegar, and I poured a little soy sauce and minced garlic to the pan I cooked the chicken in because I really like garlic. Served it to a bunch of ladies in a crafting class holiday potluck, and everyone RAVED about it!
