I really don't understand what I could have done to mess this up. My husband and I made this this morning and it ruined my day..okay a little dramatic but it was no good. We used peanut butter instead of cashew butter and also used less than the recipe called for. I was driving to work and took a sip and it was terrible so I thought maybe because I brushed my teeth pretty recently that the orange juice was tasting funky. I got to work an hour later, took a huge gulp, and couldn't even swallow it. I think I am going to try this again but without the peanut butter.

The cashew butter made this nice and thick.
