This dish was very simple and tasty enough. I used shredded colby jack because that's what I had on hand, so I had to double the milk to keep the sauce from turning into paste. Definitely had to add plenty of salt and pepper to taste, and I added some veggies to give it a healthy kick.  Would make again anytime.

I used about 3/4 of a 16 oz. bag of noodles to make this dish. I'm glad I didn't use the whole bag because there wouldn't have been enough sauce for my liking. I added a little extra milk, and some boneless chicken to this, I didn't even USE the garlic powder (I didn't have any!). It came out really good! Will make again.

It was quick and easy!! My family loved it!!! I make it all the time now, especially when I'm in a hurry. Also, if you add some olive oil to the noodles when they are cooking, it makes a difference when you drain them, they don't stick together as much. Otherwise, it was terrific!!

This recipe had an unpleasant aftertaste and the sauce wasn't sufficient to cover 16 ounces of cooked noodles adequately.

Yum!  This was great! I was reluctant to try it based on the ingredients it called for.  I decided on it because it was quick to prepare. My husband, who does not care for egg noodles, loved it. I added sauteed chicken breast and used whipping cream instead of milk.  ...making it even more sinful.  Add brocolli, asparagus or peas. Tasty dish.  Great for kids too.

This reminds me of a version of chicken spaghetti my grandmother made when iI was a child.  I made a few changes to the original recipe...I substituted whole wheat angel hair pasta for the egg noodles and cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom.  I also added some steamed broccoli that I sauteed in garlic along with some cooked chicken.  My husband loved it!

This was good.  Next time I will use cream of broccoli instead of mushroom.  I used shredded cheddar instead of processes.  Good stand by recipe for a quick and easy dinner.  I still prefer by regular mac & cheese recipe.

Easy and delicious.  I added chicken  to make it a more filling meal and I used a clove of garlic instead of garlic powder.  This is a rich and creamy pasta dish.

Bf really liked this--he had two servings.  I ate a few bites and gave him mine.  But that is not surprising at all, considering I don't like cream of soups, mushrooms, creamy sauces made with milk, or processed cheese.  Bf likes all that stuff, though, so I mostly made it for him, and I'm glad I did because he did enjoy it.  We'll rate it based on his enjoying it.  :o)  It was certainly quite easy, as well.  I made extra pasta so I could have some with tomato sauce, so I didn't plan on using all of the pasta anyway.  I just kept adding the pasta until I felt it was coated lightly and couldn't manage any more sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used 12 oz. of noodles, 3/4 cup of milk, added 1/4 cup of sour cream, jar of sliced mushrooms and added 1 cup of cheddar cheese  after the fact.  It was really good but I felt like it was still missing something.

it is not the best meal I had.  I notices also that is has an aftertaste  and  i suggest adding a little more milk to make the taste lighter, but I also had worse, so I give it 3 stars

This was excellent!  I used evaporated milk and shredded jack/cheddar cheese.  My husband raved about it and asked for seconds!  A definite keeper around here.  :)

Very good and simplistic recipe!!  Added cream of chicken soup, as I'm not a mushroom fan, added some more cheese and milk.  Also used ground turkey with this (sauteed with onion and garlic), and added broccoli for some nice color and crunch!  Would make again and again!

We used about 1/2 the garlic powder that the recipe called for and found this to be plenty. We are meat lovers and if we had any chicken thawed we would have used some and all agreed that this would have been better with some grilled chicken. For the ease preparation and the pretty good taste we gave it 4 stars.

This pasta was very quick and easy!  I only had spinach egg noodles and rather than processed cheese I used grated parm cheese and added some fresh mushrooms!  YUM!  Thank you.

Phenomenal! this is the recipe I use for my mac and cheese - with ajust a couple of tweaks. I add broccolli (chopped) and I crush ritz style crakers and put under broiler for a few mins. Excellent recipe Hillary Thank you!

I don't write a lot of reviews, but I wanted to give a shout out to this recipe!  I made this the other night for dinner, and had the leftovers today for lunch.  As a general rule, I don't make any changes to the given recipe unless the reviews were pretty bad.  The only changes I made were subbing fettuccine noodles in for the egg noodles (we were out of egg noodles) and using Campbells Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic in place of the regular cream of mushroom and the 1tsp of garlic (we didn't have any regular cream of mushroom on hand).  I used Velveeta 2% for the "processed cheese cubes."  It was EXCELLENT!  I was afraid of it being bland for the lack of ingredients, especially no veggies or meat.  But it was so good we will definitely be making it again and again.  Even my husband who thinks 'anything without meat isn't a meal' loved it and asked for it again this week!  I do think we will always use Campbell's Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic in place of the regular CofMushroom & 1tsp of garlic - Just because it's one less step and it tasted great.

This was so good and even easier to put together.  I used small shell noodles and made as directed.  Will be making this gem again for sure.

Was pretty good & I'll make it again when I need a quick side on a night I don't feel like cooking.  Definitely not gourmet but a hit with the kids.

I LOVED it!  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to double the amount of sauce (I like my noodles swimming in sauce).  I wanted to use cream of chicken soup, because my boyfriend hates mushrooms, but I only had one can.  So, I used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom.  I really didn't have processed cheese, so I just mixed a bunch of cheeses...4oz of cream cheese, 7 slices of Kraft American cheese, and a cup of Sargentos 4-cheese Mexican shredded cheese.  Believe it or not, the noodles tasted so good!  My boyfriend LOVED them as well!  I am definitely making this one again, but I think I'm going to add some shredded or cubed chicken to make a full meal out of it! Yummers!  Thanks!

I first made this per the recipe.  It was good, although I found it to be a little rich and thick for my tastes.  The changes I made were as follows:  I used whole wheat angel hair pasta, colby jack cheese, and a couple of spponfuls of sour cream to give it a little tang, and added a little more milk to think out the sauce.  This was a good recipe and will try different soups and adding vegetables for a nice side dish.  Thank you.

A lot like hamburger helper without the beef. Better with fresh garlic.

My husband and I like to fry up diced chicken breast flavored with garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder and pepper to taste and add to the sauce.
DELICIOUS!!!

I accidentally used garlic salt instead of garlic powder (I didn't add any additional salt or pepper) but it turned out excellent! I also used mozzarella cheese and I/3 cup of milk and I only used 12 oz of pasta. I really liked it and will definitely make it again!
