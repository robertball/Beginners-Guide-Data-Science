This is seriously one of the best things I've eaten in a long time. I made this on the stove instead of in the microwave, used half fat free evaporated milk/half regular 2% milk and I poured a little cold fat free evaporated milk over the top along with the brown sugar and pecans. All of us LOVED this oatmeal and wished there was more for seconds. But there was not. Next time, I'll double it. Excellent for cold winter mornings.

This was fantastic!  My husband accidentally bought quick cooking oats, so I decreased the cooking time to 6 minutes in the microwave.  I love that it's easy to control the amount of sugar in this recipe--less for me, a little more for my kids.  This will be a Fall staple in our house.  I can make up a batch and reheat servings before school.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was pretty good. Definitely better than most pumpkin oatmeal recipes I have tried. I only had quick oats, so I had to use those. I would definitely recommend the rolled oats. I made 1/2 recipe and it made 4-5 servings. So, the actual recipe, written as is, would make at least 8 servings and not 4. I microwaved it for 8 minutes and it seemed just right. Be patient, it will take at least that long to thicken and the liquid to absorb. I sprinkled mine with the optional brown sugar and pecans. I definitely recommend them. I probably added a little more brown sugar than suggested. I then added milk to my dish, as I always do with oatmeal.

My family really liked it. I made it with almond milk - in order to be dairy free. Much more filling than ordinary oatmeal.

Follow recipe to the letter.  But mine was super thick after 6 min.  Nice flavor.  Might make large batch and put in crockpot to cook overnight for an easy breakfast with company.

I tried this after cooking but before adding the optional ingredients--way too much salt, and not enough pumpkin. The saltiness was OK after I added brown sugar, but there still wasn't much pumpkin flavor. If I make this again, I'll omit the salt and increase the pumpkin.

I made it as written except for using a whole can of pumpkin, which is about  1 1/2 cups.  Microwaved for 10 minutes.  It tasted really bland.  I added 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 3 shakes of pumpkin pie seasoning.  Then it tasted too heavily of ginger to the point it sickened me.  I think if I were to make it again, I'd double the spices (except for ginger),  skip the pumpkin pie spice that I had added, add the 1/4 cup brown sugar, and probably stick to 1 cup of pumpkin.   The only thing that somewhat saved it was adding some chocolate chips.  Still threw out most of the batch.  The kids didn't like it either. I just don't think the combination is right.

The oatmeal didn't have the amount of flavor I was looking for. It was  pretty good though. I might make it again. I had to add a little bit of whip cream to cool it. I liked how easy and quick it was.

I cut the recioe in half to  serve 2. After reading others reviews for more flavor, I doubled the spices, came out good but next time I would not double the allspice.

This was very good! So yummy and filling. I made only 1 serving, and I was able to share it with my 3 year old. I used pumpkin pie spice for the same amount of all other spices. I added 1 T brown sugar when it was cooking and still topped with a little more brown sugar. I really thought it needed a sweetner in the oatmeal. I used quick oats, and it only took 3 1/2 minutes to cook.

I was excited to try this, but it wasn't as good as I hoped. I was missing the nutmeg, so that might have played a part. Again, it wasn't awful, but I felt it was missing something.

Quick and easy with great texture.  I think I was hoping for more of a pumpkin pie flavor, rather than just squash oatmeal.  I might try it with maple syrup or something.  Great basic recipe for instant oatmeal, though!  (Maybe apple-cinnamon instead of pumpkin?)

This recipe is wonderful. I have had several friends ask me for the recipe. It is a great starter and then I add other ingredients to make it more personal. I use pumpkin spice, which is a mixture of all the listed spices. I used vanilla almond milk instead of milk due to a lactose issue. I also add a few drops of mexican vanilla. I do not care for pecans so I use walnuts instead. The first few times, I made the recipe as stated with my the changes listed in my review. Last week I added some fresh blueberries that were about to go bad. Mmmmm that was good. I have also added marshmallows if I really have a sweet craving. This recipe is so great! Kids love it too!
