My kids loved them both in taste and in using the "guts" to make muffins. 

I didn't have ghee so used regular butter. The recipe made about 27 muffins instead of 12. 

Pureeing the pumpkin guts in my blender was kind of hard because the strings got wrapped around the mechanism at the bottom and it would get stuck. Eventually it got the job done.
