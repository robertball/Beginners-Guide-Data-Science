Three stars as written, five stars  after modifications. Based on my experience making ice cream, I had to make a few changes to make this recipe work for me. I was concerned about the incredibly large amount of bananas, and the texture and consistency it would lend to the ice cream--that many bananas surely would compete with the "cream" in ice cream (as other reviewers indeed noted). As it is, I used half as many bananas and it was plenty banana flavored. Because bananas are sweet on their own, I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup and it was perfect. I like my ice cream rich, so I added an egg, and replaced the milk with half and half.  I also left out the vanilla as I felt it wasn't necessary. Finally, I eliminated the nuts just because that was hubby's request, and used good, chopped, bittersweet chocolate rather than the chocolate chips. A food processor or blender isn't necessary and only makes more dishes to wash. Whisk the egg for a minute or two till light and fluffy, add the sugar and whisk another minute or so to dissolve it. Mash the bananas with a fork and add to the egg/sugar mixture with the cream, half and half and lemon juice.  Chill for several hours before churning. It turned out intensely rich, velvety, and packed with fresh banana flavor--a 5-star ice cream.

TIP: You must freeze ice cream for at least two to three hours after you make it in your ice cream maker if you want it to be like the consistency of ice cream you get from the grocery store, this is called tempering. When it comes directly from the ice cream maker it is very much like soft serve ice cream.

This was fantastic...much like the famous brand.  I reduced the sugar by half and used very ripe bananas, and it was plenty sweet with a very intense banana flavor.  I also used a frozen bittersweet Lindt chocolate bar instead of the chips and added a hint a cinnamon to add a homemade touch.  One trick to making ice cream work in an ice cream maker is to make sure both the canister and the paddle are very, very frozen.  I usually freeze at least 2 days ahead of time and remove canister from freezer just before mixture is ready to pour into canister.

I am diabetic and used equal sweetner to cut the sugar out.  My grandkids loved this ice cream when we made it last weekend.  It was very easy and delicious.  They want to make more next weekend.  It was a hit!

this is really good.. i was a little doubtful of "banana" ice-cream.... but it was quite delicious!! make sure you use overripe bananas for the best banana taste. i used my cuisinart ice-cream maker to make this.. and it was overflowing so i would make it in two batches like the other reviewer said, or just halve the recipe. the ice-cream was tasty and very easy to make compared to the other ice-cream recipes i've used so far. try!

This ice cream is almost better than the famous brand's. It doesn't seem like overripe bananas are required for this recipe; I also prefer adding regular-sized chocolate chip, or even chocolate chunks, than miniature chocolate chips. Will be made often at home.

This ice cream was delicious, and tasted almost better than Ben and Jerry's Chunky Monkey!  (Super easy as well!)  For my half-gallon maker, I used 5 bananas and doubled the rest of the ingredients.  It turned out great, and wasn't runny at all!  I would say that it turned out a little like the consistency of cool whip, and twice as good!  Thanks for sharing! ^_^

DELICIOUS.  The one change I made was to use regular cream instead of the heavy kind so it wouldn't leave such a taste of butter fat in the mouth.  Turned out great!

Oh My Heavenly Goodness!  Wow, this is such great ice cream, everybody in my family LOVED this.  I did cut down the sugar by quite a bit since my bananas were VERY ripe and VERY ripe bananas are VERY high in sugar and HIGH SUGAR=Soupy Ice Cream.  I would HIGHLY recommend this recipe, just watch the sugar, the riper the bananas the more you should cut down the sugar in order to get ice cream and not a smoothie as some reviewers complained.

Also, try using Manzana(baby) bananas, their excellent flavor really shined through this ice cream.

We took the advice of everybody and made it this way: 2 bananas, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 egg, 1/2 TBsp lemon juice, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 1/3 cup heavy cream, 3/4 cup milk, bittersweet chocolate.  It was perfect!

Our family loves chunky monkey ice cream and I misplaced the recipe I used to use to make my banana ice cream before so we were anxious to try this recipe.  I hesitated to use the lemon juice called for in the recipe because I was concerned it would give the ice cream a tart flavor.  I added the lemon juice anyways because i thought it was a small enough amount that we wouldn't be able to taste it.  I assumed it was just to keep the bananas from browning.  I should have gone with my original instinct.  The ice cream had a tartness to it that took away from the flavor of the banana.  It did not have the flavor we were hoping for.  We will try making the ice cream again, but next time without the addition of the lemon juice.  I feel that since the bananas are frozen immediately after they are peeled and processed, they shouldn't brown but if they do, I'd rather have a little browning and be able to enjoy the flavor of the banana without the tartness.  Thank you for a good base for banana ice cream

The banana is a little overpowering. Next time I will cut back a bit. Other than that it was good.

Delicious, but taste of bananas is almost overpowering. If you like bananas and chocolate together, you have to try this.

Ben and Jerry's Chunky Monkey has been my favorite forever.  I tried this, and it was so good!  The banana flavor is so intense! Plus its healthier because the Ben and Jerry brand has so much fat in it.

Love it!  Definitely will be making this again. The honest, natural flavors are head and shoulders above the synthetic flavors found in store bought ice cream!

I used 3 small over ripe bananas and almonds because that is what I had in the house.

there's no denying this ice cream is delicious as is. i just enjoyed another bowl last night with a little chocolate syrup. it was the perfect recipe for me because i had a bunch of bananas that were getting very ripe and i just couldn't bear making (and eating) another loaf of banana bread. the only thing i really did differently was use about 3 cups of heavy cream and 1 cup of half and half because i'm cheap and wanted to make another ice cream from this site, blueberry cheesecake (fabulous!) and didn't want to buy two quarts of expensive heavy cream. while this recipe isn't nearly as rich as the blueberry one, it's still fantastic. nuts, chocolate, chips, bananas...what's not to love?

This is a really good start for a banana ice cream.  I wasn't in the mood for nuts and chocolate so I made some changes.  I mashed 5 bananas with a potato masher, added my milk, cream, sugar and vanilla.  I omitted the lemon juice because I didn't have any.  I froze the banana batter in the ice cream maker and when it thickened I added 1/4 cup of sweetened flake coconut.  It is delicious!  Next time I plan on adding a bit of pineapple and pecans to make a "tropical ice cream".  Yummy!

I guess I like bananas more than the rest, because I didnt think 4 bananas was even CLOSE to too many! thats crazy-talk! I actually omitted the 'extras' to make a basic banana ice cream, and then added crushed oreos in the last 10 min of the ice cream maker's cycle. super yum. Plan to make again with super over-ripe bananas next time, because my only complaint was my bananas were not spotted brown, so the banana flavor was too "green", IMO.

I love banana ice cream and I think this recipe is okay but has potential to be better.  It is very sweet and very thick.  Next time I will cut the bananas and sugar content in half.

We all thought this was great banana ice cream.  I used Nestle choc. chunks and stirred in nuts and chocolate after churning stopped.  Then froze for a few hours.  I doubled the recipe for six and had some left over.  Served with white cake. Deee licious!

Pretty good.  My husband liked it.  I did use 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 c (equivalent) sugar substitute.  It did make more than the Cuisinart ice cream maker could handle though; by just a little bit.  Next time I'd just freeze it in 2 batches.

This recipe did not work out at all.  It was not ice cream.  It was a big smoothy.  Even after days of freezing.

I followed this recipe to the T, and ended up with glorified frozen banana mush.  It didn't work out at all, and though it tasted okay, it most certainly wasn't ice cream.

I just made the plain banana ice cream with none of the added extras.  I'm not a big fan of bananas, but I loved this ice cream!  It's very simple to make - I used a small chopper to mash 1 1/2 large bananas and then put them in a bowl, added the cream, milk, sugar and vanilla and mixed by hand.   Since the bananas were so ripe, I used a little less than 1 cup of sugar.  I didn't add the lemon juice and I used almond milk instead of regular milk.   I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before putting it into the ice cream maker.  I have a 2 quart Cuisinart and it only filled it up halfway.  Delicious recipe that I plan to make again!

SO yummy, I had to get it out of my house and give it away because I couldn't stop eating it!!  I didn't have mini choc chips, so it was just banana walnut, but SO delicious just the way it was!

Very good and easy to make.  I would have liked for it to have been more banana-y tasting, so next time I'll add one extra banana.  Everybody else thought it was fine as prepared. :)
