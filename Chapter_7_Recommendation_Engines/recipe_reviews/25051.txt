This tends to be dry & flaky on the top. I think if a little vegetable oil and water were added and maybe 1 egg reduced, it would be more moist.  Otherwise, this was very chocolately & good.

Today I have used 3 recepies to make brownies and then did taste test comparisons with my sons. We all agree these are the best and far more superior than those we have ever bought in a bakery.(I omitted the nuts) Thank you for this fab recipe!

I tied the pecans in a bag and attache with a ribbon to the jar because some people don't like nuts in their brownies.  This gave them an option

Pretty good.  A touch dry but nothing a glass of milk won't solve.

I thought this recipe was great. I did not use in a gift jar, if just made the recipe. I also frosted my brownies with chocolate frosting. The only thing I would suggest is not flouring your pan or use very little flour.It looked horrible seeing that flour thru a clean pan.

These brownies are great. However they were dry so I adjusted the recipe a little. I used 1 cup of vegetable oil instead of butter, and I used 2 eggs instead of 4, and I added a splash of vanilla extract and 1/2 cup of milk and cooked them in the oven of 350° for 30 minutes and they turned out moist, fudgey, and perfect. Thank you for the recipe.

Take the Servings down to 12 and it will fit.

This recipe had good flavor, however, it was extremely dry! I followed all directions and even took the brownies out of the oven before I was supposed to, and they were so dry you could barely swallow! I would say maybe add some oil or something to give them some moisture.

Made a half batch just to see how good this would be. Holy Moly!  It’s excellent!  Wonderful for gift giving, simple to make and delicious! I use dark chocolate cocoa powder since that’s all I buy.
