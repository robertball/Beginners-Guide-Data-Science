This was a nice change of pace for pork chops, I did a few things differently. First I dip the pork chops in the oatmeal, then in the cream mixture, then back in the oatmeal. I know everyone thinks the first coat will come right off, but trust me it doesn't and the coating comes out much nicer. I do beleive this is probably the reason why I used more like 3 cups of Oatmeal and hardly any of the cream mixture. Second I used fat free half and half in place of the heavy cream to cut down on the fat and calories, the flavor of the sauce was very good, a little sweet (but hey what did I expect the recipe is called SWEET maple pork chops) but I think because of the fat free half and half it had a hard time thickening I added a little cornstarch to fix that up. Third I bought 2 packages of pork chops, for a total of 8 chops, I could only fit 6 chops in the pan with the onion/garlic/basil/maple syrup mixture. The remaining 2 chops I put in the frypan after I took everything out and cooked covered on low for 10 minutes by themselves. Having tried the chops both ways I don't feel this affected the taste at all and I would cook the chops this way when I prepare it again as it left the coating crispy and in tact on the chop. I definetely had trouble with the coating staying on the original 6 chops. Lastly I in no way used a quart of oil to fry these in, if I were to approximate I'd say I used about a cup or so. We did enjoy the recipe, and I'll be making it again. THANKS!!

I joined allrecipes just so I could rate this recipe and give credit to the person who suggested double dipping the chops in the oats. THE OATS DON'T FALL OFF it makes the coating nice and thick and really tasty! I now do this with everything I bread it's AWESOME for chicken cutlets!! So thanks for the recipe it's great--but even more thanks to LOVECED for her advice!

I gave this 5 stars because it had a very nice flavor but it was a big mess, the oatmeal wouldn't stay on during cooking, there was more in the skillet than on the chops.  Next time I am going to try putting the oatmeal in the blender first to make a powder out of it, then dip the chops in it.  Also, I see no need to use a whole quart of oil, next time I will use a small amount in the skillet, I think that the oats will stick to the chops better that way.  I don't see why all that cream is necessary, seems like you would only need a cup to dip the chops in.    But it does have a nice flavor and is worth trying again, and hopefully I'll get better results

The only reason I rate this a 3, is because the flavor is absolutely delicious. However, the actual recipe as far as quantity goes was way off from what I found. 3 cups of heavy cream for the coating is entirely too much. Turned out to be maybe 1 cup needed, and 2 cups in the trash. In order to coat the pork chops, a lot more than 1/2 cup of oats is needed as well. I don't see the need to double-coat them either, as when you put the chops into the liquid after putting the oats on they just fall off into the liquid, which wastes more oats. Most of the oats fell off while frying also, and for pan frying, you need nowhere near a quart of oil. Following the recipe exactly would mean throwing away at least 2 c. each of oats, heavy cream, and oil..which really spoils the recipe for me. The flavor of the sauce is incredibly good, but in the future, I will prepare the pork chops in a more practical and less wasteful way, and then make the sauce seperately.

Wow...these were absolutely amazing!! It took a while to prepare, but in the end, the taste was out of this world, and very much worth the effort. Some of the oatmeal did come off, but not enough to alter the taste. I fixed this meal for a special occasion, and it will stay that way. We could easily eat this once a week, but the high fat and calories would show eventually! :)
UPDATE: To cut the calories, I used Promise spread in place of butter, half and half instead of the cream and used butter lite syrup. The taste was still amazing, and I will prepare it that way from now on.

This was an excellent recipe.  A quick recipe that had complex flavors that make it seem like a difficult meal.  The actual amount of oats needed was closer to a 1/2 cup per chop, the amount of cream was closer to one cup for the breading and one cup at the end for the sauce.  The amount of maple syrup could be reduced to a 1/2 cup to avoid making the dish overly sweet.  Also, depending on the size of your pan, the amount of oil could be reduced to 2 cups for browning chops.  I would say this was an intermediate level recipe.

This dish is fabulous.  My whole family raved about it.  Big hit with the kids because of the sweet taste.  Used extra thin pork chops and doubled the portions except the maple syrup.  Some reviewers did not like it too sweet and if I had doubled the syrup it would have overpowered the dish.  Made it with panko (Japanese bread crumbs) which seemed to stay on pretty well.  I also cut way back on the oil.  I also used fat free half and half as another reviewer suggested.  My husband is asking me to make this dish for the holidays!  Thanks so much for this scrumptious recipe.

Wonderful! I was looking for recipes to get rid of a gallon tin of Canadian Maple syrup, and was a bit iffy about preparing this, but the reviews sold me.
It turned out so great!! My extremely picky mate scarfed down his chop and helped himself to another. The dish smelled divine cooking, it looked so great plated up too. (I served the chops on a bed of whole wheat angel hair with maple green beans.)
I agree with the others, I used a lot more oats then called for, and I did not need near the amount of cream for the breading (I used 2 cups and still threw out a good 1/2 cup or more). I will be adding this recipe to my favourites!

We tweaked this recipe some...used much less oil for frying, added some grated Parmesean cheese to the oats for dredging, replaced the maple syrup with a tablespoon or so of Dijon mustard and added more mushrooms...sort of defeated the "maple" aspect, but since there was basil and garlic we made it a little more Italian

Way too sweet for our liking. Followed the instructions of other reviewers and double-dipped the chops (oatmeal/cream mixture/oatmeal again) -- that worked really well. Also listened to others and reduced the cream and oil by more than half.  I think next time I'd try half the maple syrup to see if that make it less sweet because pork chops should not taste like candy!!

This is a very good recipe. It can get a bit messy but is worth it. It also is very sweet, so if you are not into having something very sweet, cut back on the syrup a bit. I've shared this with my friends. Definitely a weekend dish.

The pork itself is quite nice as the oats add a slight nutty flavour but the sauce ruins it. I did make some changes. For dipping, I reduced the cream to one cup and added a dash of cinnamon. For the sauce I reduced the maple syrup to half a cup (as many reviewers complained the dish was overly sweet), used canned mushrooms (didn't have any fresh) and dried basil (I don't usually have fresh herbs). The combination of onions, garlic and basil in the sauce make it taste not good. I have tried other pork recipes on AR that use a combination of sweet (like brown sugar) and fruit (like apples) that taste great. I think that the sauce could be tweaked to incorporate fruit, maybe apple or pear with the cream and maple syrup or maybe omit the cream and reduce the maple syrup until thick, along with some "autumn" tasting spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc) to make a very tasty dish.This modified version would be great with a salad, maybe some mashed potatoes. Will keep this in mind when I try my hand at creating a recipe that will work. Thanks for all the ideas.

Compared to how lovely this recipe sounds, I was a little dissappointed.
It was interesting, but too sweet for my liking. Sweetness of maple syrup together with cream was a little sickening.

The oat coating was lovely, shame you put it in the sauce only to lose the yum roasted crispness. I might try it again, seperate the sauce and pork, use it as a dipping sauce.

Excellent recipe!  Followed recommendations and cut cream and oil and added bread crumbs to oats.  Also dipped chops first in breading, then cream, then back to breading.

Interesting flavors, but the oatmeal coating was thick and chewy and greasy.  Maybe I didn't do something right, but I didn't care for this dish.

Tremendous! Made this for my husband and then for my parents and it was a success all around. A restaurant down the street makes something similar and my family thought this was better. Only issue was some of the oatmeal fell off while cooking...but it still was fantastic! Great dish for guests or dinner party.

I took a look at this recipe and thought it was surely a disaster... boy was I wrong! It was delicious. The onions were a nice compliment that brought the sweetness down a little. I used way less cream than what was called for but used a lot more oats. Messy but worth it. I just wish there was a healthier version so I could make this more often.

Excellent!  I used italian bread crumbs instead of oats and they stayed on the chops.  I also only used enough oil to pan cook the chops--just enough so that there was oil around them, but not covered.  The chops were moist, very flavorful and the whole family loved them.

My husband said, "you should make pork chops like this all the time!"  I cut back on the oil (it seems like the original recipe meant to really "fry" the chops, not just pan-fry).  I also only used 1 cup of cream for the coating.  Sure, the oats came off here and there, but they just added to the yummy sauce.  I absolutely love this and will make it over & over!

my coating came off therefore making the texture of the sauce nasty.  Good flavor though.

Loved them.  Very easy to make.  Had a little trouble with the oats sticking but some were still there in the end and it was delicious!  Highly recommended to try.

I like it, but I, too, like several others would do some things different.  A lot less oil for sure!  I only used half of what it called for and it was still twice too much.  Needs more oats, and using the blender is a good idea.  I didn't use all the cream, and it didn't need it.  We really enjoyed the maple flavoring!  I didn't measure out the syrup, I just squeezed some over each chop.  I will try this again!

The coating would not stay on so all of the oatmeal was just in the bottom of the pan.  And the sauce was way too sweet. We had to throw all of this mess away and order pizza.  Definately will not try again.

My husband, I, and mother in law loved this..It was a hit! I used Great Value Pancake and waffle syrup. It only had 5% Maple Syrup in it. I also put them in the oven while finishing the other 6 porkchops and waiting on company. It was about 20 minutes in the oven on 300 and they came out so juicy and tender.. The only thing is I read a review that said crumbs fell off and so I blended like she suggested on the 1st porkchop. The breading fell off immediatly so I  layered porkchop with quick oats and they stayed on so much better. I took the other breading that fell off and lined the casserole dish with it. We loved them and will definetly make them again...Just some suggestions...

This was different...perfect as that's what I was looking for...it was VERY SWEET and I think the syrup overpowered it just a wee bit.  I WILL be making this again, but LESS syrup and MORE ONIONS and MUSHROOMS! :) I agree with others that MORE oatmeal is needed for the crust and LESS cream (I used 1/2 and 1/2 and it turned out FINE) for dredging.  Also, I didn't use NEAR that much oil either...more than to "coat" the pan, but not enough to drown them....(I eyeballed it) Also, I didn't have ANY problems with the Oatmeal falling off either ~ Great recipe.  Different and just a wee bit TIME consuming, but GREAT!! ~ It's a keeper for sure ~ Thank you :)

The pork chops turned out great.  I dipped once and my oatmeal coated well and adhered just fine (very little came off during cooking process).  It was quite sweet but we did enjoy the maple flavor.

The breading of oats was a very nice change of pace, great texture.  However, the maple flavor was a bit too strong for my husband's and my liking.  My husband prepared this dish and felt it was too much effort for the taste.

EXCELLENT! EVERYONE ENJOYED IT! NO LEFTOVERS! MADE A FEW CHANGES. ADDED 1 CUP OF QUICK COOKING OATS INSTEAD OF 1/2 CUP.

I used fresh carrots instead of mushrooms (I'm the only mushroom fan in my family) and dredged the chops in ground oats.  It smelled GREAT but the sauce was WAYYYY too sweet, leaving a candy aftertaste.  I would make it again but use just a tad of brown sugar--to go with the oats--and just make it more of a basil cream sauce.  My son who is a sugar hound loved it, but I only ate the pork and tossed the pasta I served it with--too sweet for me.

My kids thought it was okay but too sweet. I thought it tasted better the next day. I followed the recipe precisely. I might try again but this time; put the oats into my food processor to make a powder (was a bit chewy to coat with the oatmeal), cut the cream by 1 cup (was too much sauce), add more mushrooms, change the quantity of syrup to 1/4 - 1/3 cup and add a bit more spice and extra pepper for some bite....maybe some freshly grated Parmesan cheese. This recipe has a good flavor, just too sweet and trust me...I like sweet! But the 3/4 cup of maple syrup added an overpowering flavor and sweetness.

This was a big hit with the whole family! Wonderful flavor. I did not coat the meat, just seared on each side in a little olive oil after seasoning with salt and pepper. I then took out of pan and set aside. I added chopped bacon, onion, and mushrooms to the pan and let cook through until bacon was crispy. Then I added two cloves minced garlic, 1/2 cup syrup and the seared pork. I let this simmer until pork was cooked tender. Next, I added 1 to 2 cups skim milk with 2 or 3 Tbls flour to thicken and make creamy. This turned out great. There were no left overs!

This was very flavorful but a tad too sweet. I would add a little less of the syrup next time. All in all, juicy and tasty and easy to make.

This was awesome!  My daughter wants it for her birthday dinner.  The only thing I did different was to use Patanko Bread Crumbs instead of Oats.  I served it with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and steamed Broccoli.  YUM!  Thanks for sharing.

This was a very yummy and different way to enjoy pork chops.  I did do what others suggested and I didn't use that much cream or oil.  I also dipped each pork chop in oatmeal first and then the cream mixture.  I believe this did help keep the oatmeal on the chop while it cooked.  I will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe and so did my boyfriend, it will be added to my favorites.  I did leave out the onions because my boyfriend doesn't like them.

This recipe was amazing. Everyone who came to Sunday dinner was so impressed and delighted with the sweet flavor and the tender porkchops. The only thing I changed was I had to use more oats for the coating than the recommended amount. Some of the oats fell of during cooking but this made the sauce have a great texture.

I made this recipe and my husband LOVED IT. We both love the sweetness of maple syrup so adding this to a main course was just heaven.  He thought it was the best thing I've ever made.  Thanks for a winning recipe.  The only thing i did differently was added extra oats, this fell into the sauce and helped add texture to the dish.
