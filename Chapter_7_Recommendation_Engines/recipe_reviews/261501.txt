A definate remake! We all loved it. Next time I'd shred the zucchini instead of slice and don't add salt.

I thought this was great! I used Kielbasa sausage and added about 1/4 cup vegan protein broth so it wasn't quite as thick. Because I used kielbasa I followed another rater's suggestion to omit salt.

Fantastic recipe. Some modifications I personally plan to make are:

- Less onion. Half is too much
- Get pre-riced cauliflower. It's a huge pain to grate and extends cook time significantly
- If using uncooked sausage, remember to start cooking it while cutting up the veggies.
- Use more sausage since the recipe doesn't reference how much sausage but just how many links. The sausage I got is smaller and even 3 links was too little.

Everything else was spot on!

I craved this after I ate it once!  The zucchini isn't necessary but overall it was delicious

I really like this recipe, I use brats instead of sausage because that is what I have on hand and sometimes I add red peppers to give it a little more kick

terrible, nothing like the picture. Very bland flavor, and I added red pepper flakes for a little heat. 1st recipe from allrecipes that I didn't like.
