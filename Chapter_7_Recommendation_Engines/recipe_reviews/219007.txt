Im not a huge pork chop fan but I decided to try this recipe out for something different.  I used 4 large thick pork chops and cooked them for the full 45 minutes.  The apple topping was awesome tasting, pretty thin which I tried thickening up with corn starch which didn't do too much since I used too much apple juice.  Next time I will use an extra large sauce pan so not as much liquid is needed to cover the apples.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very yummy.  I think next time I will thicken the juice with some cornstarch, and serve on the side. It kinda takes away the crispy of the chops. 
Otherwise, easy to prepare last minute with pantry ingredients.

I made this for my family, including my grandsons.  Everyone loved it.  The apples really made it special.  I did use some of the sauce from the apples to drizzle over the meat.  It was great, gave it sweet and savory flavor.  I will be making this again, I'm sure.

Not a fan of this at all. It was so overpowered by the apples that you couldn't taste the pork.

This sounds delicious altho if I prepare it I'll probably leave off the apple component.

Our family found this recipe to be really great. The pork chops were so tender and juicy! I saved the left-over apples and sauce and used it on pancakes the next morning!  What a great topping it makes!

I used chicken, minus the apples part. Family LOVED the lemon pepper chicken by itself! So easy
