Thr chicken was tender and had a tomato-ey taste, but I felt the blue cheese got lost in the crockpot. I think it would be  better to top the chicken off with a bit of dressing.. would get more of the flavor since there is a LOT more liquid in this than you'd probably eat. I am going to try shredding this up in a wrap and adding blue cheese to it that way

I made this as written (except I didn't have as much vegetable juice so used what I had (approximately 32 oz) and reduced the hot pepper sauce to accommodate my kids' tastes) and it was great!  I cooked it on high for 4 hours.  It took minutes to put together and the chicken was tender.  I think shredding it would help with the amount of liquid, and possibly serving it with or over rice.  Even my pickiest eater liked this.  Thank you!

I cooked on high for 4 hrs and the chicken was very tender and moist. I used Ting Tang bloody mary mix and didnt have horseradish on hand but the mix had plenty. I also had no celery salt but it didn't seem to miss it. Served it with a simple green salad and some baby red potatoes and cauliflower which I roasted after tossing in Everything But the Bagel seasoning. Worked well! Will definitely make again!

This recipe is not very good as written. Honestly, I could not follow it completely, because other reviewers had said there was too much liquid and also not to add the blue cheese dressing to the liquid use it on the side. I am not sure if that’s supposed to be a 64 ounce bottle of V-8? Or a 46 ounce bottle of V-8 my store doesn’t sell 46 ounces V8? Either way it was still way too much liquid, all the spices and other flavors completely got lost. Because others felt that was too much liquid I only used 32 ounces, After I dumped it in it was still too much, I ladled out at least a cup if not 2. At the end the flavor was completely lost. And so I added the spices again, everything except for the chicken, V8, celery, and blue cheese. My suggestion is far as flavor would be, mix the spice and add the V8 one cup at a time. Until the flavor is to your liking. I’m kind of a spicy wimp, and it didn’t have any kick. And as others suggested, it would probably be pretty good shredded but you still wouldn’t need that much liquid you can always add more.

The chicken came out nice and tender, and almost fell apart while I was taking it out of the crock pot.  My husband isn't a fan of blue cheese so I substituted Ranch and it was tasty.  I liked the spicy kick, and the dish went well with rice as a side.

Tried the recommendation of leaving the blue cheese dressinv for a topping in the tortilla.  Not much flavor in the dish.  Probably won't make again

I felt it was 'okay.' Would cook it again.
