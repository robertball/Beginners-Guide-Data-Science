These might be okay appetizers, but these are not quiches. To make PERFECT mini quiches, use the Cream Cheese Tart Shells recipe on this site and also the Basic Quiche by Shelley. Use a mini muffin tin. I placed a tiny cube of pepper jack cheese, a tiny piece of canned mushroom and a tiny tear of frozen spinach (defrosted) in each cup, then filled with the egg mixture. Baked at 350 for 15-20 minutes until edges were beginning to get golden. Ah, they looked and tasted very professional!

OK, I have made several batches and here is what I came up with...cook your 6 slices of bacon, drain, meanwhile mix 2/3 C Bisquick, 4 eggs, 1 1/2 C sharp cheddar, 1/2 C Monterey Jack cheese, dash of ceyenne, 1 1/2 T fresh chopped parsley and the green tops of 4 green onions chopped.  Bake as directed in the origiinal recipe.  I actually used a few dashes of ceyenne pepper, and a few shakes of salt.  They were really good, had more of a quiche consistency than the original recipe.  Very good, freezes well, just heat and serve.

I served these at a baby shower and have never had so many people ask me for a recipe! I followed other reviewers' advice and cut the Bisquick to 1/2 C and cheese to 1 C. Perfect! I made 3 variations: as listed (the best); spinach, artichoke  and swiss/mozzarella cheese mix(very tasty); crab, onion & swiss (not horrible). Easily portable and sooo easy to make. Thank you!

This is an awesome little recipe.  I used five eggs (instead of three) and 2/3 cup of buttermilk biscuit mix (instead of 3/4 cup).  It was not at all rubbery like a previous reviewer stated nor did it taste more like muffins than quiche.  I was very happy with the way they turned out!  My friends loved it and asked me to share the recipe and even my picky three yr old loved them.  Will definitely make again!

These were great, my coworkers couldn't stop complimenting them. However, I did do a little bit of tweaking. I doubled the recipe, but I cut the bisquick by about a third, as I noticed a lot of people saying that the recipe was a little dry. With less bisquick, it was perfect! I used tomato, onion, spinach, and mushroom.

These aren't very good. I think I should have ignored the previous reviewers who said that they reduced the quantity of baking mix and got a good result. I'd rather have something that resembled a muffin or a biscuit over the tough, rubbery items I've got. This recipe is never going to yield anything like a "quiche" so I think it should be taken for what it is and not modified to attempt it. I would rate this even lower but I don't think it is fair to the original submitter since I didn't follow the recipe exactly.

This is a nice little recipe, but I think calling them "quiches" is a little deceptive - they are much more like little bacon/onion/cheese muffins.  Quite good but I wouldn't serve them as an appetizer, they are more like a brunch item.  I made them in mini muffin tins.  - they are yummy little bit sized breakfast treats!

We love these and make them often - Very easy!  We always mix up the ingrediants with sausage, cheeses, mushooms and/or asparagus.  We do add another egg and bake them in reqular size pan. Always a hit at our home!  Thanks for sharing!

I've been making a veggie version of this recipe for prolly 5ish years now. And no it's not "exactly" a quiche but they are yummy, super easy, transport and keep well...  and I always have people ask me for the recipe. I make mine exactly as stated regarding the amount of baking mix and eggs but vary everything else.  I usually go lighter on the onions.   I use 1 can of cut asparagus spears, drained and chopped smaller paired with thyme, white pepper and swiss cheese OR 1 heavy cup of chopped broccoli floretts with black pepper and cheddar cheese OR artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes with lemon pepper and a feta/ mozzarella blend.  Enjoy.

I thought I would try this recipe but cut back on the baking mix based on the comments sent in.  I cut the baking mix in half and added green pepper and a little more bacon and onion.  I got very good reviews on these when I brought them to a party.  Everyone loved them except for the kids.

These are good, but definitely not quiche.  They're more like mini muffins with the amount of buttermilk baking mix called for in the recipe.  Even after using four eggs and half the amount of baking mix they were still a little too "puffy" but they were still good.  I used cheddar cheese and did half with bacon and half with ham.  I guess I'll be searching another mini quiche recipe.......

These were delicious and easy to make! I made one batch of bacon & cheddar, and batch with broccoli & cheddar. I didn't have parsley, but they were still great. My whole family loved them, even my picky 5 yr old daughter :-)

OK, 5 stars for taste, 4 stars for not actually being a 'quiche' but instead sort of an eggy muffin type thing. Tasted good, came out nice, but not a quiche. We ate them for dinner with a side of veggies and another side of fruit. I had to make some substitutions based on what I had/didn't have on hand. As written they would be yummy. As I made them, they were also yummy but in a different way. :)  I had onions and green & purple bell peppers in the saute. Added salt to the saute. Skipped the bacon, didn't have any. Used a package of shredded italian cheeses as I didn't have cheddar. Used some basil chiffonade as I didn't have fresh parsley. It made 12 regular muffins, on the smaller side. So, like I said, I got a much different flavor but the method worked and the taste was good. Will make again.

These were good. No, not a true quiche, but for all the naysayers who reviewed this, one look at the recipe tells you what you are getting. I made these to toss in the freezer for grab and go breakfasts and snacks. They are very tasty, quick and easy to make. Easy to customize add-ins as well. Thanks for a great idea, Jayne!

Like others said, this is not a traditional quiche, but regardless it is still a great fast recipe for breakfast/brunch that you can modify to suit what is in your kitchen and to your family's tastes. It is easy to make it more "eggy" for more of a quiche-like consistency by increasing eggs or decreasing the baking mix. I used 4 full eggs and 2 egg whites. I also used a whole grain baking mix and cut the amount to 2/3 Cup. I made a variation with left overs in the fridge and included flaked salmon, 1/4 C frozen spinach drained and thawed, a small zucchini shredded, some provencal herb seasoning, garlic powder, and did 3/4 C of Swiss/Emmenthal Cheese. Once I mixed it all together, I threw in a splash of milk to moisten it a bit more, and baked in full sized muffin tins. Everyone loved them, and even my very picky 16mo toddler gobbled it up.

Very quick and easy recipe.  I don't have bisquick mix, but I do have complete pancake mix, so I used that.  Works just as well.  I have real bacon bits in the fridge, so I just dumped some of those in instead of cooking bacon.  Made it even faster.  They are cute and yummy.  I like the fact that I could make this in less than half an hour, as well.  We had for Christmas breakfast and I didn't have to make the night before or make us wait forever to eat.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  To make these more Weight Watcher friendly, I used two cups of egg whites in place of the eggs, left out the bacon, and only added a cup of cheddar cheese (regular).  I also added broccoli, which made them super yummy.  I didn't think that they were too biscuit-like; mine tasted very much like quiche.  I will definitely make these again!

These are pretty good.  I used ham instead of bacon and cheddar instead of american, I also added salt and pepper to the batter, a little too muffin like to me, so next time I may cut back on the baking mix or add more egg.  This is a great thing to grab out the fridge, pop in the microwave and eat before you run out the door in the morning.

I made these following the recipe but used a little less onion.  Next time I will use the whole thing and maybe add a little garlic.  I baked for exactly 12 min.  They were very good and disappeared quickly!

These were GREAT!  I made a couple of changes based on what I had on hand.  I sauteed onion, bacon and mushroom together in a pan and spooned a small amount into each mini muffin cup.  Sprinkled a bit of grated cheddar cheese on top of the bacon mixture and then spooned in the bisquick and egg mixture.  In all, I probably used only about 3 or 4 tablespoons of cheese in 24 mini "quiche" bites. Baked at 350 for about 10 minutes.  They puffed up slightly and were DELICIOUS.  Will definitely make these again.

There's too much baking mix and not enough eggs so the end result was more of a biscuit with a bit of egg than a mini quiche.

I baked these just as instructed, but I also have to say they are nothing like a quiche.  They were okay, but were too much on the dry side for me.  Will not be making these again.

I have made these mini quiche as an appetizer at least 5 times and have always gotten rave reviews. They may not be a true quiche, but they are very tasty. I have made different flavors by changing the meat or cheese. I have a teenage daughter that does not eat pork, so I usually make these with turkey bacon & swiss cheese. I will be making them for an appetizer for her birthday in a few days and plan on making the turkey bacon/swiss and using turkey ham diced with sharp cheddar. Very yummy!!!

Mmmmm..no way a quiche.  Not great..not bad.  I wouldn't serve as an appitizer to my company.  I would stick to the Athens mini filo shells for the mini quiche. Nice presence and much tastier.  Nice try with the Buttermilk baking mix, but a no go for me.  Also had to add a bit of water as the mix was just too thick.

These are not quiche, in my opinion. I found them dry and the only real flavour was of the bacon and onions. I used green onions because the flavour was milder and I made these primarily for my children to eat.  A point worth noting is that I do make my own baking mix using: 1 cup of flour, 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt and 1 Tbsp of shortening.  I use a fork (or pastry blender) to mix and these works out very nicely as a homemade baking mix.  So all in all, we prefer a more 'eggy' quiche, so we probably won't be making these again.

Very Fast and good recipe. Easy and flexible recipe. I used diced ham and swiss cheese ... or whatever is left in the fridge. Kids, Baby and Daddy love these. I will use this recipe for an afternoon tea party coming up. They can be served hot or room temperature.

I made this dish to bring to a baby shower. I rate it only 3 stars because   the quiches were more like little "doughy" balls with bacon in it. There is nothing smooth about these mini quiches. I don't think I'll make them again.

My sister and I made these for Father's Day and they were wonderful! We used only 1/2 cup of Bisquick and 1 1/2 tsp. dried parsley and the flavor and texture were perfect. We served these alongside the Stuffed French Toast with some mimosas and fresh fruit for a great Father's Day brunch!

Not so hot of a recipe as written but pretty tasty if you change the bisquick to 1/2 cup and the cheese to 1 cup as recommended by another review. I love the size of them for my kids. They're a perfect little breakfast for them in the mornings!

I've made these for a morning playgroup.  All of the moms and one year olds were eating them up!  I didn't think they were too dry, like some of the other reviews said.  I used 2 cups of cheddar cheese b/c I like that better.  I think it's a great appetizer or brunch food.  Even better that the kids loved them!

These are addicting! Very easy to make with common ingredients I had on hand. These taste just like appetizers I've had (and loved) at wedding receptions. I will definitely make these again. The only variation I used was 1 cup cheddar cheese instead of the american. YummY!

I was not at home when I found this recipe, but it sounded so good that I had to try it. To prepare it for the two of us and using what I had on hand, I modified it as follows: I used a well-greased 8"X4" loaf pan and baked it for 12 minutes in a preheated (350 degree)toaster oven. I used 2 eggs, 1/3 cup Bisquick, 3/4 cup cheese (a mixture of sharp cheddar & 4 cheese Italian blend), 1/4 cup finely chopped smoked turkey ham, 1 large slice of onion (finely chopped), 1/4 tsp. dried basil, and a dash of crushed red pepper flakes. This mixture seemed a tad thick, so I stirred in about 1 T. milk. Although nothing like a quiche in appearance, it was very filling and tasted superb. I will make this again and again.  Thanks for a wonderful, flexible recipe.

These tasted good but I thought they would be more like quiche and less like muffins. They aren't bad, just misleading. I think I might try less baking mix like others suggested and more egg. I did enjoy the taste of these though.

While these were quite tasty, they are NOT quiches by any stretch.  They would better be described as what you would get if a biscuit and a quiche had babies.  Or a very eggy muffin.  If I fix them again, it will not be to replace quiche.

I prepared this recipe for breakfast this morning. We were very pleased. Quiches were delicious. I tried quiches before (in a very fancy restaurant), and I can say the result is up to the standards. I did not have buttermilk mix, so I used 1/2 pancake mix and 1/2 cream instead. The result was fabulous. Great texture and taste.

I give this 5 stars based on "hope03's" review. I used the Cream Cheese Tart Shell and the Basic Quiche recipes. I filled my mini quiches with a small slice of smoked salmon and about a 1/4 tsp of cream cheese. I poured the egg mixture over and baked at 425 for 30 minutes. It was spectacular! I will be making these again!

Very yummy recipe! The only change I made was using part-skim mozzarella cheese instead of american and cilantro instead of parsley.  To keep them on the smaller side, only fill the mini cups 3/4 of the way and make sure to grease the pan well!  Will make again for sure!

As one poster pointed out, these are not quiches, but they sure taste like it. They were quick and easy to make, easy to transport and were the first things to go at a 100 person BBQ. I experimeted with my favorite quiche fillings - mushroom/swiss/tomato, ham/tomato/cheddar, mushroom/leek/swiss. Fantastic addition to a party!

These are so yummy and easy! I had vegetarians in my group, so I used onion, spinach and artichokes in my "quiches", and it turned out great. They have great presentation as well. I'll definatly be making these again, and trying out different fillings.

These were okay. Tasted kind of like cheesy biscuits. Easy to make and they smelled really good.

I've made these several times, and they are always really good. I prefer them as written with onion and bacon, but made them today for some friends with garlic mushroom, swiss cheese and crab, and plain tomato and onion. Delicious and easy! Thanks, Jayne!

I agree with Chellebelle that this needs to be taken for what it is.  If it gets modified to the point of actually tasting like a quiche, it isn't going to be "easy" anymore.  And easy is one thing it's got going for it.  It did taste quite biscuity, but I didn't think they were dry and I could taste some of the other things coming through (mostly the cheese).  I just didn't find them to be the most exciting things, and while they were OK once, I  doubt I'd make them again, and I don't care to attempt to modify it into something it's not.

Delicious! Perfect for  breakfast/brunch, or anytime you need a great, no-fuss appetizer. I can totally see these being worked into my next get-together. While it isn't a traditional quiche, it has all the great flavor. Thanks so much for sharing!

Very easy to make. I used a smoked cheddar and swiss cheese and it gave the quiche a very light smokey taste which I liked very much. I served this for breakfast with fresh fruit. This would be great for a brunch and is so easy that you could make this for a crowd.

I made this recipe for my daughter's Brownie's X-mas party, they were very good!  I doubled the recipe and used less baking mix so it would'nt be too dry, and they turned out delicious, and very easy!  I recommend this recipe for a quick fix appetizer!  I'm making it today for our annual family X-mas eve party this afternoon!

I just made these with cooked spinach that I sauteed with the onion instead of bacon (am vegetarian). I used cheddar cheese instead of American..and followed all the ingredients as in the recipe and they are divine.. I recommend that you add salt and pepper. No need to change the bisquick or egg amounts in my opinion.

After reading so many poor reviews, these came out WAY better than I expected :) So, it's not exactly a quiche but it definitely isn't a muffin. I added about 1/3 cup sliced asparagus, increased the eggs to five and reduced the baking mix (I didn't have any; used Bob's Red Mill GF Bread Mix) to 2/3 cup. I also added a splash of milk. Next time I will either add one more egg or reduce the baking mix down to 1/2 cup, as others suggested. I yielded 10 short, regular-sized "muffins". These will be awesome to take to school in my lunch; perfect for eating during lecture on those back-to-back class days.

This recipe needs addition of milk or half-and-half to make more of a quiche puff dish, rather than a buiscuit.

This was more like a mini cheese muffin, but it tasted pretty good.  I added caramelized onion.  I doubled the recipe and it made 60 mini-muffins.

Not really "mini quiches" but rather biscuits.  I followed the recipe exactly, but used sausage (finely crumbled) instead of bacon because that is what I had.  Made one recipe and it made 1 1/2 mini muffin sheets, not 2.  Will double next time.  8 minutes in the mini muffin pan was perfect.  Taste was very good, had compliments!!  Will make again.

Glad I added an extra egg. This was still very dry. Less baking mix, more eggs. Also added garlic powder, salt and pepper and a dash of hot sauce for flavor.

I would agree with most other reviews on this page: these aren't really quiches. They're more like biscuits or muffins. I made mine without the onions and using cheddar cheese and they turned out alright, but a little bit chewy. I suggest maybe putting in one more egg and definitely not as much cheese, maybe only half the amount of cheese.

These were so simple and quite good.  I did substitute finely chopped broccoli for the bacon and mozzarella for the cheddar.  I would definitely make them again, though they might be better termed "breakfast puffs," than "quiches."

I made three batches of this stuff for a church function tomorrow.  In the first batch, I only added 1/2 c. baking mix, and wasn't pleased with the results.  It tasted bland an insubstantial.  I added extra baking mix to the 2nd and 3rd batches, with spinach and salt and thought they were much better.

This is easy, quick and delicious. I have been using it for years; it is a good basic recipe. I omitted the buttermilk mix and substituted one level teaspoon flour but without the flour, it is even better. I opt for lighter versions ergo removing the 'flour' aspect of the recipe. You can also subsitute the bacon with a 290g (140g drained) can of mushrooms or some spinach. Makes lovely appetizers and very moreish. My house keeper just learnt how to do it in five minutes; it is so simple. I have read the comments and believe that recipes need to be adapted to accommodate individual taste and availability of ingredients. I agree with the comment to use one cup cheddar. All in all, just a good, basic, simple recipe; measurements are fine.

I make this time and time again.  However, I do make a few modifications.  Instead of bacon, I use turkey bacon, and instead of eggs, I use Egg Beaters.  I try to make it healthier!  As for cheese, I experiment with whatever kind I have.

This isn't really a quiche, per se, but it's a good brunch item or snack anyway.  I made the recipe with half the onion and bacon, then added some chopped carrots and tomatoes.  It filled 12 regular size muffin cups.

These were simple to prepare; used shredded Swiss instead of American cheese because I thought the flavor would be better. More of a traditional quiche lorraine. Also added a smidgen of nutmeg.

These tasted pretty darn good.  I followed the recipe and also added spinach and mozzarella (ran out of cheddar).  I also used Morningstar "bacon" to cut down on fat which I didn't miss at all in this recipe.  It doesn't taste exactly like a quiche as others have stated,and if you overbake these, they will turn rubbery.   I baked mine for 10 minutes, and they came out pretty good.

Wow!  These are great!  I only used 1/2 cup baking mix and have tried several variations.  The bacon, onion and cheddar is the best!  Thanks for the great recipe!  A new favorite at bible study.

It's an easy and quick recipe. I changed a few things though. Instead of bacon, I used hot dogs and chopped them into small pieces and fried with just a little bit of butter (ham would probably be very tasty too). I used 1/2 cup of Bisquick and any type of cheese you have at home will make it tasty.

Okay! So I am new to this cooking game but with these awesome recipes, I am well on my way to becoming a "five star chef!" This recipe is simple, yet tasty! On the advice of other reviewers, I added chopped spinach and sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top before baking! My daughter loves these and now I have an easy to make breakfast filler for our usual morning rush. Thanks!

Easy recipe, they always disappear fast at my house no matter what ingredient combo we try.  They really are more of a muffin than a quiche, but delicious nonetheless.  The recipe is good as is, or you can substitute different types of cheese and add-ins such as spinach, green onions, shredded zucchini, really any ingredients you happen to have on hand.

I made these for a friends baby shower. I did some with ham some with bacon and some with asparagus. They were so super simple to make and were a hit at the party!

This was a great recipe.  I used it with my preschool class for the letter Q.  The children loved them and gobbled them up.  Out of 21 kids only 2 did not like it.  I did not put in the onion.  I doubled the bacon, put 4 eggs, added some salt and italian seasoning, and put 3 different kind of cheese.  We used cheddar, mexican blend, and parmesan.  We had about 3 cups of cheese total in our mix.  We baked them in mini-muffin pans.  They baked beautifully.  Thank you for the recipe.

Like many others, I thought this was too buiscuity.  I will try it again with more eggs and less buiscuit mix next time.  I like the concept, though, but I would like a more eggy consistency.

Used 5 eggs and 1/2 cup baking mix and 1 cup of cheese. I don't like chopping onions so I used 1/4 tsp onion powder. They were good, but not the best

It was pretty good. I changed it up a bit to fit my taste. I added a couple extra eggs, some green chilies and little spinach. I think next time I would not use quite so much cheese and I may substitute half of the the cheddar for pepper jack to add a little kick. But a good base recipe.

These tasted great, but were a little rubbery.  I think more egg would help.  I will try them again with less baking mix and more egg.

Just made these for the first time. They came out perfectly, but the taste was somewhat bland. Would diced jalapeno be a good addition??? Or anything else to perk them up.

While these aren't really quiches, they are quite tasty egg muffins. I made these modifications to fit our tastebuds and use ingredients in my pantry: used cheddar instead of American cheese, used dried parsley instead of fresh, used onion powder instead of fresh onion, and omitted the bacon. Next time I'll try making some with broccoli in them.

Sorry, but these were not very good.  I even took another members advice and reduced the mix and played with different ingredients, but it didn't help.  I was very disappointed considering I made them for a baby shower.  Maybe these would be better titled "Buiches" instead of quiches, considering they're essentially bisuits.  I think these would be better suited for a breakfast or brunch item.

These were tasty little treats!  I made them for over night company b/c I wanted something quick and easy for breakfast without making a mess.  Everyone loved them!  I used precooked bacon and hot pepper cheese.  I am making some tonight with sausage and cheddar cheese for breakfasts for the rest of the week. I am going to make them "normal" sized instead of mini this time too.  Thanks for such a quick and simple recipe!

I make these for friends all the time and so far everyone has loved them and requested the recipe.  Maybe they aren't exactly Quiches, but I wouldn't be able to come up with a better name- they're delicious whatever you call them! :)  I also used Cheddar cheese instead of america- just because thats what I had, and less onion when I make them for kids.

These were good & easy to prepare.  I used 1 cup swiss cheese - next time I will use 2 cups.  I also used 1/2 cup baking mix.  I cooked mine for about 12 minutes - next time I'll cook a little less.

These are really good, but I agree with whoever said they weren't really quiches.  They taste more like popovers.  If you are looking for a recipe for mini quiche similar to the ones you can buy at bulk foods stores in the frozen section, this isn't it.  But they are good!

This a very tasty appetizer although I'm not sure I'd call them Quiches - these are dry in comparison. More in line with something called a Sausage Bite from another web-site but, as I said, very tasty - I will make them again.

Made this recipe with a few changes. Changed it to be gluten-free and, instead of baking mix, I added gluten-free flax and ancient grains flower(half a cup) and a half a teaspoon of baking powder. Also, instead of onions I used some dried chives and added some diced ham. I used pre-cooked bacon and placed strips of pre-cooked bacon at the bottom of mini muffin tins. Then I sprinkled a bit of shredded cheese on that before placing the mix in the muffin tins. It was delicious! Both kids loved it, even the super picky one.

This recipe was well-liked at a work breakfast potluck.  I followed another reviewer's recommendations and used 4 eggs, 1.5 cups cheddar, .5 cup Monterey Jack, 2/3 cup Bisquick, 6 slices bacon, about 1/2 onion (which I did sauté a bit before mixing in because I'm not a fan of a lot of raw onion), and some sliced green onion.  I used a 24-cup mini-muffin pan.  It seemed impossible that 4 eggs plus the other ingredients would fill all those spaces, but it did.  This version of the recipe leaned towards a muffin-type texture, but not so much to taste bad.  Next time, I may experiment, perhaps using another egg and slightly less Bisquick.

It was super easy to make.  I should have followed the reviews, and decreased the pancake mix.  It was a bit too doughy of a flavor, when I followed the recipe exactly.

This was a simple and delicious recipe.  I did change a few things....used turkey kielbasa in place of the bacon, added pico de gallo and extra cheese....love the cheese!!!  It was wonderful.  Even my husband loved it.  Definitely going to try this again.

I followed the advice below and used 4 eggs and 2/3 cups of bisquick, I also added a dollop of sour cream.  I used a dash of cayenne and paprika as well.  I made two batches , one with Turkey bacon, cheddar and green onion tops and one with parsley, fresh mozzarella and finely chopped portabella.  both were very yummy and a big hit.  easy to make!

Made these for a bring and share party and they were a hit! 

Instead of the buttermilk baking mix (we don't get that here!) I used 1/2 cup self-raising flour.

I was dubious that the mixture looked so thick at this point but when I mixed in the bacon and onion it softened out nicely.

I added some of Ina Paarman's Potato Spice to the mix and it came out lovely. I will definitely be making this again!

Loved them!! So they aren't technically quiches, but they are hands down the best breakfast muffins that I've tried (and I've tried a lot). 4 stars because they did need salt and pepper, which I added as suggested by other reviewers and 1 c. Velveeta is perfect...2 cups was a little too cheesy, if that's possible. It overpowered the bacon and onion. 
I made 2 batches, the first followed the recipe exactly and other I fidged a bit...used 2c cheddar and jack cheese. Both were made with turkey bacon and a homemade whole wheat baking mix to which I added about 1/4 c yogurt (helps with the whole wheat). They were great. I can eat them on an empty stomach and they don't mess with my blood sugar but keeps me full. Some other moms sampled some and now want the recipe. woohoo!

Pretty good.  We didn't do bacon, but had broccoli, artichoke, shredded carrot and zucchini.  I pan cooked the veggies before adding them in.  Added the extra eggs like others said and I added a little milk, garlic powder, paprika and Italian seasoning.  I also made my "bisquick" mix myself with just flour, baking soda and baking powder and salt.  
I used to work for Head Start and that is what was made there from time to time.

Great little bites. My Dad couldn't stop eating them! I used some fresh thyme in place of parsley, cheddar cheese with a little grated Parmesan, and subbed about 2/3 cup flour with some baking powder for the pancake mix. They baked up nicely but were done before they got brown on the top- I'm careful to avoid overcooked eggs. Good recipe to have on hand for my mom's MOPS meetings.

These were good but a little dry as mini muffins. They either needed less cooking time of more liquid.

Sherri G.'s suggestions were great.  More like how I make quiches.  Sometimes, I add cilantro instead of parsley for a fresh taste.

Follow the "most helpful" review by Sherri G. for great results.  I look forward to experimenting with the ingredients for different variations.  They were very popular at my brunch party.

I used Lorelei's suggestion and it came out pretty good. I would go even further and use 6 eggs, and maybe even less baking mix.

No, these aren’t the same consistency as your typical quiche. They’re better. They are little eggy bacony cheesey muffins of happiness. I did use four eggs per other reviewers. Loved them. They are so convenient to just take along to work and re-heat.

I've been making these for years. I don't add the bisquick so then it's LOW CARB! It's so hard to find low carb recipes that are portable so these are amazing for on the go. Any cheese works. I mostly use cheddar or mozzarella bc I never have that much American on hand. Also, real bacon bits work great if you don't have bacon slices. Plus they're already cooked which eliminates a step. Great recipe!

I just made these also and thought they were great and easy.  Like others, I used cheddar cheese, ham and green onion.  I'll keep base recipe (eggs and baking mix) but use different ingredients depending on what we have in the fridge.

These are very good, but they are definitely not quiche.  More like a biscuit.
