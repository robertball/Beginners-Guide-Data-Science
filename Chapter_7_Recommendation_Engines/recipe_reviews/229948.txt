I was looking for a slow cooker white chili recipe, and I found a great one in this! I doubled it (my bag of beans was 1 lb, so it just worked better). I used two garlic cloves (crushed) instead of garlic powder, and about a tsp of dried cilantro as I didn't have any fresh. I started out with just the jalapeno that's called for, but at my taste-test partway through cooking, it was super bland, so I added two cans (4 oz each) of diced green chiles and a pinch of red pepper flakes (the recipe notes mention additional peppers and I definitely agree!!). Even with those additions, it had just a touch of kick. If my toddlers weren't eating it with us, I'd probably add still more heat. Also per the recipe notes, I put in half of the cumin at the beginning and half at the end, so it wouldn't get lost during the 8-hour slow cooking. The only other slight adjustment I made was to use my immersion blender a little bit while I had the chicken out to shred. That thickened up the chili just enough to my liking. (I also added about 1 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper towards the end, as the chicken stock I used was unsalted.) The end result was delicious, and was enjoyed by me, my husband, and our 1- and 3-year-olds! I'm very happy to have this chili to add to my winter meals rotation.

I made it last night and the only issue I had was that it calls for way too much liquid. I used one can of white beans and next time would add a 2nd can. I will probably also put one of the cans in the food processor and then add it to make the chili thicker. It's delicious but basically soup.

I think the reason some folks found this recipe too soupy is because they used canned beans instead of dried beans.  If using canned you could use a lot less stock.  I added more heat, too, but this is a great recipe!  Thanks!

jgrollman, did you use 'dried' beans and then add a can of beans at a later time or simply used only canned? I ask because dried beans will definitely soak up the extra liquid called for. If you did not use dried please do try the recipe again because it's really good!

Good recipe.  Served in bowls over brown rice, with Mexican shredded cheese, diced tomatoes and sour cream.  Next time, however, must spice it up....tastes way too bland without adding some more Mexican spice.

This recipie was very easy to put together and hearty on a cold evening! I garnished with fresh tomatoes, cilantro, shredded cheese, & sour cream and used flour tortillas for dipping. I will definitely be making this again :)

Very tasty.
I made this exactly as written except for using an entire jalapeño (just right as far as heat goes).
Still, as a few others pointed out, too much liquid!
This had nothing to do with the beans, since I used dried beans not canned.
My solution was to add some wild rice at the end...!
Let that cook about 30 minutes on high in the slow cooker with a touch more cumin.
Definitely a keeper recipe for all my family/critics!!!

I don't normally like chili, but this was really good! I added four cloves of garlic and half a can of green enchilada sauce instead of jalapeno since my husband doesn't do spicey. The garlic intensified the flavor. I would normally cook beans from scratch, but only had one can of white beans. I reduced the liquid by using one cup of chicken stock. So good, I'm really impressed!

Agree with jgrollman - it came out like soup not chili. I thought it was soupy when I put it all in the crockpot but figured it'd reduce while cooking. Well, 8 hrs later on low and exact same consistency - very disappointing for me as I was looking for a chili not a soup. I'd say half the liquid and double the beans for the desired consistency, or pure some of the beans and add back in. I am not sure what I will do with my crock of bean soup. The dog is hungry.

Great flavor, but I made one change when preparing the dried beans.  If you soak overnight and discard the water, you lose most of the water soluable nutrients in the beans.  Instead, I suggest rinsing the dried beans in cold running water to clean off any surface dirt, then soak in fresh water.  Use that soaking water to cook the beans.  Some people say this gives diners gas, but if you eat a regular, high-fiber diet anyway, you don't really get any gas.  Thanks for posting this nice recipe.

I like the fundamental idea behind this recipe, but it came out extremely bland.  Next time I will add more jalapenos, salt, hot pepper sauce, etc.

I won't do this one again. Like others had stated, it's super bland if you follow the recipe exactly.  By the time I added enough other spices to make it 'chili' it wasn't the same recipe. There are better white chili recipes out there than this.

Fantastic white chili! I use ground chicken or turkey browned with a teaspoon or two of minced garlic, and bump up the flavor with a little sriracha, canned corn, salt/pepper and additional cumin. My preferred toppings are sour cream, tomato, cilantro, chopped onion and mexican cheese with nachos on the side.

I thought it was one of the best slow cooker white chili recipes I've tasted. I'm a hunter, and I had a couple of pheasants left in the freezer, so I used them instead of going out to buy chicken. I forgot to get fresh cilantro, so I used some dried. The pheasant really worked well. The next time I make this I'm going to use a couple of wild turkey thighs and drumsticks, which usually end up as a soup ingredient. I thought the cheese enhanced the recipe, but I also had some without and didn't miss it. The only seasoning I added was a little salt to my bowl after dishing it up. I can't wait to make it again. Good recipe!

I tried this yesterday and it really is a great starter, you can add just about anything you want to this. The Mexican oregano is key to this it brings out the flavor in the chicken especially if your using boneless skinless. I do have to admit I did use the raw beans and it did need some extra cooking time. For even more flavor I tink you can use bone in skin on breast and take it out shred chicken and put back in before stirring together. You do need to add salt and pepper though. I also took advice from previous reviews and added a can of Diced green chiles and it did give it a some spice. Next time I will add more raw jalapenos.
Great start thanks for the recipe.

Very nice base recipe, but I agree with everyone else - it needs more spice.  I added a 4 ounce can of hot jalapenos and a bit more cumin, and personally could have used more.  I noticed one person described this as too "liquidy", but referenced using canned beans.  The recipe calls for dried beans - so if you use canned, it WILL be more like a soup.   The dried beans soak up the excess liquid as they cook.

Forgot to mention--I used one can of beans "as is" and mashed the other in the slow cooker with a fork. I also left the chicken alone and when it was done cooking, took the breasts out, shredded them with forks, and threw it all back in. We really liked the chicken shredded vs cubed.

I'm kind of disappointed with this recipe.  Mine turned out like beans, chicken and chicken broth.    Didn't come out anything like the picture, trying to figure how to doctor it up to make it better.  Disappointed.

It's a good recipe, but I added salt, pepper, chili powder, and two chopped up slices of Canadian bacon in the last hour of cooking. The results were excellent!  This recipe is a keeper.

Good recipe. I doubled and think there was too much liquid, maybe it's my crock pot. I would go heavier on all spices/herbs jalapenos and onion... Top with sour cream. 2.5 time chicken too.

I really liked how easy this was.  I used canned beans, drained (I smashed one can and stirred in at the beginning of cooking to add thickness and the other I left whole and stirred in at the end of cooking time ).  I used 2c broth, but would likely cut back to 1c broth to make it even thicker (as other reviews have stated, when using canned beans you don't need as much liquid). I also used 2 cans of fire roasted diced green chiles since I didn't have any jalapenos. I used garlic powder, but would use real garlic next time.  Made this for a school potluck, so was able to cook in the slow cooker over night and just bring it with me in the morning! Loved that!

This recipe was very good.  I followed the recipe as written, but ended up with a soupy texture.  I blended part of it up to thicken it and then it was a much better consistency.  It definitely was not spicy at all, so my 2 year old ate it just fine.  To spice it up, I topped with Rotel instead of plain tomatoes, cheese and sour cream.  Very filling!

Pretty good, though it needs some type of acid.  We didn't put the tomatoes on top, so that might have helped.  Also think it might be nice to add some frozen corn.  We added a splash of heavy cream since we had it on hand, and topped with cilantro and cheese.

I loved it, better than red chili not a real strong flavor. I did add jalapenos and green chilis to give it more flavor.

I followed the recipe just like it was except I added 2 cans of fire roasted green chili's and then the entire jalapeno. About 30 minutes before it was finished I mixed 2 T cornstarch with some of the hot liquid, mixed well and added that back into the soup to cook for the last 30 minutes. This gives it the perfect consistancy in my opion. It was a big hit with my husband!

I used the ingredients as listed (dry beans/not canned). I cooked it on low for 8 hours. It was pretty flavorless and a very soupy mixture of beans and dry chicken. Not dense at all. I don't know what went wrong but I'm extremely disappointed. Do you think maybe I let the beans soak too long in the water overnight? Perhaps that's why the beans didn't soak up enough of the broth, i don't know :-/

It was way too bland.  I plan on experimenting with the spices and jalapeño to get a better flavor.
