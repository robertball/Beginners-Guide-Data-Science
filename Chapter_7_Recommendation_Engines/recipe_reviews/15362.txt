This was surprisingly amazing! I took the suggestion of other reviewers and added a block of reduced fat cream cheese, and also substituted fresh lime juice for the lemon because it made more sense with the avacados. I increased the amount of condensed milk to about 10-12 ozs. based on similar recipes I've found (many other recipes like this call for a full 15 oz. can), and everything fit perfectly into a 9" pie crust. Definitely chill this for at least 6-8 hour if not overnight for the best set/flavor, and look for good quality, ripe avocados as this is the KEY to this recipe. Still can't get over how fresh and unique these ingredients taste together - wouldn't have expected it! Thanks so much for the recipe...this will be a new summertime favorite! :-)

For God's sake stop reading and make this pie NOW!
The texture is yummy, and the flavor is out of sight.  It's a breeze to make, and everyone will want the recipe.

So easy and so superb!  I am a huge avocado fan and have been DYING to try this recipe out!  It is absolutely heavenly.  I made 2 pies.  Per each pie, I used 2 avocadoes, 2 LIMES,  1/2 of a 300ML can of condensed milk, and about 1/4 cup cream cheese. Blended it in my food processor and poured it into a prepared pie crust.  I chilled this for like 12 hours.  Tasted like KIWI for some reason.  SOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!  Will make this so many more times!

We all loved it!!!  It was hard to imagine what it would taste like and it was a very nice surprise.  We enjoyed the sweet and tangy taste.  I also think that this recipe is one that an elementary classroom, Brownie or Girl Scout troop would enjoy making.  Thanks for the fast, great tasting recipe.

This pie really is amazing... I thought it was a cool idea, but I didn't really think it would taste as good as it does. Interesting texture and taste. I made it exactly as the recipe depicts, except used lime instead of lemon juice and a little less than half a cup. Will definitely make this again.

Loved it wasnt sure at first my mom tried it and told me it tasted like Kiwi she was suprised when I told her it was Avocado. Next time I will take the others' advise and let it set longer or use cream cheese but it was delicious my husband ate every last bit of it.

i was reading that avocados are excellent food to eat, omega-3's and the right kind of fat to have. Never ate an avocado before, found this recipe...oh MY GOSH!!  IT IS SO GOOD.  Thank you for this woderful find, the family loved it!  I did add a third of a block of cream cheese, as per other reviews suggested. Didn't necessarily need it, but got rid of the package fromt he fridge that way.

I made two of these pies. The first was a bit to tart for my taste and not very solid but very tasty. The second I used less lemon juice, covered, and let set in the refridgerator for a bit over a day. The pie was more solid and had wonderful flavor. I would suggest maybe a bit of cream cheese.

This was absolutely wonderful! I had to double the recipe because I only had a 14oz can of sweetened condensed milk but then I only had 1/2 cup of lemon juice. It came out great and everyone loved it--good thing I made two!  Next time I will put a little more lemon juice in it--probably 3/4 cup for a double recipe.

My bf, who loves avocados, was a little apprehensive.  But after tasting the mixture he couldn't wait to eat the chilled pie.  I purchased individual crusts and filled those.  I used most of the mix.  Topped with banana and strawberry, this dessert was a huge hit!

I served this in those little phyllo tartlet things from the freezer section.  Then I topped with a dab of homemade whipped cream, then zested orange on top.  Talk about easy and delicious!!!!  They were a huge hit at the party I took them to.    For easy transportation I scooped all of the filling into a gallon size ziplock, and cut off an end when I got to the party.  Assembly was effortless, and it looked so elegant.

Like other reviewers said, I added a brick of cream cheese and used a larger can of condensed milk.  I also didn't want it too lemony so I used 1/4 cup lemon juice.  Was great with the modifications!!

When I made this, I started with 1/4 cup lemon juice but after tasting it, I realized it needed the full 1/2 called for in the recipe. Unfortunately, the amount of lemon necessary almost overpowered the avocado flavor. I think this would be much better as a cake filling. I suspected that it would be INCREDIBLY intense/rich, and I was right; I personally couldn't eat more than a spoonful. I can't imagine eating this as a straight-up pie without anything to offset the richnesss. It's a strange recipe; not BAD strange, just strange. I think it could be stellar in the right context.

Yummy!! So easy to make - just whipped it up in a Magic Bullet and poured into pre-made graham crust. Couldn't be easier! And so tasty! Very creamy pie, with the lemon giving it that "key lime" taste. Highly recommended!

Amazing!! I replaced the lemon juice w/ lime juice. It turned out like a more subtle key lime pie only w a hint of Avacado (genious!).  I have always liked key lime pie only I've always thought it was too strong, this fixes it all

Rating this a 4 simply because I'm willing to try it again. Overall, i don't think i was sold on how it came out the first time. 

2 year olds opinion: "banana??" she liked it
Husband: "Less lemon more condensed milk please?" he wasn't a huge fan
8 month old: "Mmmm." she wanted more..but to much dairy to give her more.
ME: it was ok. willing to make a second and third time. I would like to try it with less lemon and more condenced milk (for my husband). I would also like to use the otherall idea and see about making a nonebake keylime/avocado cheesecake out of it. 

The pie itself tasted ALOT like a keylime pie, but with hints of avocado.  I used a chocolate gram crust because a reg one wasn't available at the store. doesn't store for long periods well. should be eaten right away.

ohh.. it doesn't specify what kind of avocado works best. I used 1 of the large ones. i believe it was a 'west indies' type. I chose this type of avocado based on its smooth sweet taste. Hass tend to have a little bit more bitter and less sweetness to them (though I like them much better). I assumed the recipe meant 2 of the smaller Hass avocado? but i'm not sure. I would  like to try it with a few Hass and see if i like the pie better this way.

I loved this!  I'm a HUGE avocado fan (love them in guacamole, smoothies, and perhaps most of all plain), so I made this dessert over the summer but forgot to review it.  It was delicious, very fruity due to the lemon juice, but with that rich avocado undertone, and that's my kind of dessert.  And it was definitely one of the easiest, quickest desserts I've ever made.    As other reviewers suggested, I added in some cream cheese.  However, I think I would have preferred it had I simply followed the original recipe.  Next time, I'll leave out the cheese.  Thanks!

I thought this pie would be wierd, but since I like avacados so much, I thought I'd try it.  I am so glad I did!  I used lime juice instead of lemon, and added an 8 ounce package of reduced fat cream cheese and it was out of this world!  This is a very good pie for people who love avacados or even people who don't!  YUMMMMM!

Everyone laughed when I said I was going to make avocado pie. However, upon tasting it they declared it a winner and went back for seconds. The simplicity of ingredients and work involved to make this is incredible. Definitely has a lemony taste so beware if you don't like tartness.

This Avocado Pie is surprisingly refreshing & delicious. I took it to a pot luck and everybody was not too sure if they would like it. Much to their surprise it was very good. I had several requests for this recipe.

Didn't set right. Super tart. Will try another avocado pie recipe that calls for less lemon juice & avocado, and more sweetened condensed milk.

Absolutely loved it! Made some alterations of course. I used lime juice instead of lemon juice, 4ounces of cream cheese,and added a 14ounce can of condensed milk.It was a little too rich for my blender...but I finally got it blended smoothly. I tried it the next day and it was wonderful. I served it to my family and introduced it as Key lime pie...they did not notice the difference and loved it! I later told them the truth and they were astonished!

Blending in a 8oz package of Cream Cheese pushes this recipe into the 5 star category. Give it try.

Very good! This was a little on the lemony side for me though, so I might reduce the juice slightly next time. I also think I may try lime juice for a variation though., I will definitely be making again! Yummy! I didn't find the avocados to be overpowering at all. Great recipe!

When you tell people you're making an avacado pie, they raise their eyebrows. Most likely they're expecting guac-in-a-crust, but this pie is sweet and tangy and amazing!

It tastes like a creamy lime pie.  Yummo!  I didn't tell the kids it had avocado until after they ate it.

Delicous. I topped it with real whipped cream. It tasted better when chilled longer. I got up in the middle of the night and had another piece. I used a Honey Maid graham cracker crust which I think made the difference. I have used store brands before and they weren't as good. I used the original recipe.

We were sent a doz very ripe avocados for Christmas - it was so much fun to use them in this recipe - which was yummy!! Plus the joy of telling everyone that we had avocado pie for Christmas! Made it exactly to the instructions - next time might try lime juice just to be different.

Simply delicious, creamy & perfect for a hot summer day.  I used 3 Hass Avocados, 1 pkg of Neufchtel Cream cheese (1/3 less fat)& 2 T Lemon freshly squeezed.  Using less lemon so the flavor of the avocado stayed dominant.  Topped with lite whipped cream...excellent.  Had some filling left over filled dessert glasses & topped with whipped cream & a few sprinkles of grated lemon rind. Yummy & elegant looking.

Absolutely AWESOME!  I accidentally put twice the amount of condensed milk, and it was yummy and sweet even still!  Must say that my accident kind of drown out the avodaco flavor, but it was of course still just a sweet and tart pie.  Absolutely delicious!

What a cool concept. I wish, though, that the type of avocado was specified. Here in Florida, we get humongous green skin ones and dainty little Hass avocados. I chose Haas because they taste better, but only ended up with about a cup to use in the recipe. Is this too little? Other than that, it was very easy to put together in the blender (with the addition of a 1/3 cup of cream cheese) and I wholeheartedly agree that it tastes a bit like kiwi. Also, I made my own crust with crushed Nilla wafers and a stick of margarine. Then I baked it at 375 for 5 or so minutes. Yum!

This pie is ok, nobody at our family get together was enthusiastic about it.  It is easy to make and the taste is unique.  I would suggest a little more lemon juice and a little more sweetened condensed milk...to make the avocado taste less powerful.

This pie is definitely unique.  I thought the lemony taste was a little strong, and the consistency was kind of wierd.  My fiancé liked it, but unless he asked, I wouldn't make it again.

I'd recommend doubling the recipe, as this recipe doesn't fill up the pie pan very much - I added my own topping of sour cream mixed with a little bit of powdered sugar (use your own judgement on how much of each) and it made the pie even better :-)

This pie was quite tasty.  My boyfriend and I made it with a homemade regular pie crust which work fairly well.  We also used lime juice in place of the lemon, and I think next time we make it that we will cut down on the citrus juice, I felt that there was to much in it and over powered the subtle avocado.  I also want to try it with the actual graham cracker crust, I think it would a nice little sweetness to it!

I love avocados and maybe because I was expecting it to taste like avocados, I was disappointed.  I made this for a gathering of lady friends and we all agreed it was more like a creamy key lime pie than avocado.  You probably need the lemon juice to keep the avocado green, but it overpowers the delicate avocado taste.  Good, just not enough avocado flavor.  Maybe more avocado, less juice?  Not sure.

I made some changes to the original recipe like some of the others. I used fresh lime juice rather than lemon and I also added a half of a package of cream cheese for nicer texture. I also did something a little different, I added a few sprigs of fresh mint to the avacados while they were pureeing in the food processor. The mint brought a nice fresh taste to the pie. I ended up calling it mojito pie because it reminded me so much of the refreshing beverage. Like another viewer, I felt that the pie was too sour. I would definately cut back on the amount of lime juice the next time I make it. I love this recipe and will make it again for sure!

This pie is quite nice!  Even for those who are not big avocado fans, it's great because it ends up tasting rather like kiwi fruit more than avocado.

I do double the amount of avocado in the recipe and am happy with the results.

You can also substitute cream cheese and confectioner's sugar for the sweetened condensed milk if you like - it changes the texture a bit, but not in a bad way.

Lots of room to tweak this one with good results!

This was too tart.  We like key lime pie but this was not a good kind of tart. I made it as written and it was lip puckering tart.  I couldn't taste the avacado at all.  All I tasted was sour. If I was to make again I would definetly cut down the lemon and increase the sweetner.  Not sure it is worth the $$ for good avacados.

Wow!  You would really have to like avocados to dream up this recipe.  It's like guacamole with sugar in it.  It wasn't bad, it was just weird.  In the future though, I'll stick to eating avocados with chips.

Great texture and flavor - very unique! I took it to work and got a lot of compliments. Tastes quite a bit like key lime pie, but with the avocado flavor. Very smooth texture if you process it well. I topped mine with cool whip. It's a keeper!

My version of this pie is to mix the Avocados with Cream Cheese and Sweetened Condensed Milk, then instead of lemon juice, mix in one package of Lemon Jello and half of a tub of Extra Creamy Cool Whip, pour into the Graham Cracker Crust, chill until set, then frost with the other half of the Cool Whip.

I made this as smaller tartlets. I used fresh lime juice instead of lemon. I added about 3/4 package of cream cheese - used 14-15 oz sweetened condensed milk. After they have chilled overnight, I'm going to sprinkle a little crushed pineapple on top and whipped cream. I can already tell from the batter that these are going to be delicious!

Delicious with a luscious texture when prepared just as written.  I like to mix in a little lemon or lime zest and serve with strawberry coulis and whipped cream.
