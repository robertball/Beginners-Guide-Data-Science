First off... I absolutely love Chef John, and have never gone wrong with his video recipes!  So I'm a little biased..
This was the first time I had ever made a pecan pie.  I followed his recipe almost exactly, and was blown away! Amazing!!

My only 'issue' was something that I brought on to myself- I didn't have the pie weights that Chef John used in the video, nor did I substitute with dried beans or rice.  Instead, I followed the instructions on the ready-made crust packaging, which told me to use a fork to puncture the crust prior to baking.  Not good! It totally messed with the integrity of the crust, and did nothing to prevent the crust from bubbling up.
Next time, I will use pie weights, or beans, or rice, or whatever!
The pie didn't slice quite as nicely as Chef John's, but that could be because I didn't let it cool completely.  BUT- warm, gooey Pecan Pie from the oven totally trumps proper plating.

I've made many pecan pies before but this recipe sounded really good. The taste was excellent, but the filling was runny! The crust stuck to the bottom and sides of the glass baking pan. I have been baking for 70 years, so I know I followed the recipe to the letter? Why did the filling not congeal?

This pie is good, but I found it disappointing. For years, I've been making a super simple pecan pie with a few ingredients. This was a lot more complicated - longer ingredient list, toasting the nuts, cooking the filling - and it didn't taste as good as my simple standby. You'll get a good pecan pie if you make this, but you can get the same flavors with less work.

This is definitely a 5 star recipe and should be a package deal with Chef John's pumpkin pie recipe if you're in charge of pies at Thanksgiving.  I made both of these for a holiday dinner with 8 adults, 2 kids, and the pies were GONE!

I made this pie for Christmas and it was a hit! I left out the burban because I do not care for the flavor and the pie was delicious. I will be making it again.

Absolutely love Chef John's recipes. Made the pecan pie and it came out great. I didn't have bourbon so I substituted some red wine and it was just fine. I didn't blind bake the crusts  as instructed  but did not have any problems. I even made one with a layer of semi sweet chocolate chips on the bottom of the pie and it was heavenly.

Absolutely the best pecan pie we've ever eaten, including those from bakeries and restaurants!  Just the right amount of sweetness and texture.  I didn't use the bourbon, and I also didn't blind bake the piecrust first.  Still came out divine!  For those having problems, make sure there are no cracks or holes in your crust and make sure the filling doesn't cook over and get between your crust and the pie pan.  Chef John hits a home run again!

This is the absolute best pecan pie recipe ever. Over the years, I've adapted recipes to just make a more flavorful,  pie with the perfect balance of  "gooeyness", amount of pecans, enough top shelf bourbon without being too boozy and the all important flaky crust. I had so many collected recipes with scribbled notes and changes all over them, yet none of them had hit the mark until I stumbled upon Chef John's. One pie was all it took. I loved it, and my Thanksgiving guests were going back for more, which is unusual for pecan pie, because most of the time it is too sweet. This is the perfectly balanced recipe. Don't panic if you can't get enough pecan halves for the entire pie. I have used pieces for the body of the pie, and placed the photogenic, perfect halves on the top where they stay for their close-up. Just hold back about 1/2 cup of the filling to mix with the halves & pour over the main filling with the pieces. I do serve with barely whipped cream, I like it to have more of a glaze consistency, and only add 1 TBSP of sugar during whipping, the pie is sweet enough.
Thank you, Chef John.

It's pretty good recipe but in my opinion the sugar must be cut  in about 30% easily. It just came up too sweet to my taste.

Love this recipe. Roasting the pecans makes all the difference. My guests loved the taste.  I followed the recipe exactly and would not suggest any changes.

This was even better after two days, so make ahead and save time.  I just put the pecans in the filling and poured all in the pie and it turned out fine.  Good with whipped topping. I did not prebake the crust as I just wanted to try the recipe and that worked.

Other then cutting down on the sugars I made this as recipe stated and it was so awesome!  My guest raved about it and wanted the recipe which I gladly shared.  It had a crunchy candy-like texture.  Next time I plan to play with it a little and add some chocolate chips!  Thanks Chef John....this goes in my "Keeper" file!!!

It was my first time making pecan pie, and I made it according to directions, with one tiny change... I threw a handful of chocolate chips on the crust when it came out of the pre-bake. This pie was part of a Thanksgiving Morning Pie Buffet, and of nine different pies , this was by far the favorite. It turned out beautiful!

First time making a pecan pie. The video helped to understand how to put things in, recipe was simple to follow. I used a 8" pie plate and 2 cups of pecans just didn't seem like enough. I wasn't sure what a typical pecan looks like when done... I added a handful of "un-toasted". In the end, it turned out super good and will make again for sure.

I detest runny pecan pies. This recipe is not runny, probably due to the candy process of boiling sugars and bourbon together. takes a bit longer than most recipes, but so worth it. I made this at thanksgiving, thee were others pecan pie offerings at the party, this one won out. Do not rush the cooling period on the sugar mix.  Now if I could just master the crust...

I thought I'd give this a try just for a change from my old stand-by recipe on the Karo Syrup bottle. The taste was all right although no big improvement but it was definitely too runny. I'll go back to my stand-by.

This was a huge hit! I served this at Thanksgiving and got so many compliments. FYI I used a little less of the sugar mixture than I needed to avoid the filling being too runny and I'm glad I did.

This sounded good, although a lot more involved than most pecan pie recipes. I was intrigued by the pastry treatment, and therein lies the problem... I didn't have pie weights, and my pastry is too tender to put paper & pressure on, so I just prebaked it for a bit... The pie looked gorgeous coming out of the oven, until I lifted it and could see that the bottom crust - well, actually I couldn't see because almost no crust showed. The syrup soaked through and down the sides, and I ended up making another pecan pie (just the one from the Karo bottle!) to take to my dinner with friends because this one couldn't be removed from the pan with a chisel... From other reviews, it seems I'm not the only one who had this same issue, so... I might try this again (the flavor was good) but without the crust treatment...

Do not precook a store-bought crust.  I did and it was disintegrated by the time the pie was baked and stuck to the glass pan.  Could hardly peel it off.  Filling was good.

I over baked b/c the middle didn’t seem set and so baked a little too long (it was  very chewy), but absolutely delishes . I did leave out 1/4 cup of sugar and this will be my go to pecan pie recipe. Thank you for sharing. Looked perfect.

No changes other than checking it after  30 minutes and glad I didn't wait any longer.  It was definitely done. My pecan pie eaters raved about it  and were no longer upset that I changed my regular recipe.

I’ve made this one several times and I think Chef John is awesome! I did a little variation..I used 1/4 light Karo and 1/4 dark Karo, 1 tbsp of Molasses and the tbsp of Makers Mark Burbon. Everything else is the same. Turned out beautifully!!

My family loves pecan pie so I have tried several recipes. This is their hands-down favorite. The bourbon brings about such a wonderful flavor but it doesn’t overpower it or cause it to taste boozy at all. This is a keeper for sure.

Living in NZ and making this for dessert at a friend's barbecue gave everyone a true taste of deliciousness!! Perfect recipe, we have Queen brand of glucose syrup which is from corn and it worked perfectly.  I used Edmonds sweet short crust pastry, blind baked the crust for about 12 minutes at 180C.  Will be using this recipe from now on, thank you Chef John!! :)

It really helps if you use quality ingredients. Don't use cheap bourbon!!!  Be sure to use pure vanilla extract and use fresh pecans.  Use sea salt or Himalayan salt.  This will take this recipe to a whole new level.  Enjoy!

Made for Easter family dinner exactly like the recipe (except store-bought crust - 'cause I'm lazy and Jim Beam vanilla whiskey). Wonderful results! Chef John never disappoints. When I tell my wife I'm going to make a Chef John recipe, she always says, "Go for it."

I love pecan pie overly sweet and this recipe was just on the verge  of needing more sugar, so I know it’s perfect for everyone else. I followed the recommendations to add 1/4 cup of butter (melted) and  combine it with 1 tablespoon of flour. I missed the step to cook it over the stove, but it turned out fine. FYI-I didn’t prebake my pie crust. I saw a reviewer  poked holes in the pie crust, that should only be done for pies that don’t require baking. Great pie!

I found myself without a regular oven and needed to make pecan pie. Due to the precooked crust, filling, and toasting the pecans, this recipe worked wonderfully in my toaster oven!! It was better than any pecan pie I've ever had and I will never go back to the 'old' way. Well worth the effort.

Wow! My review is premature but couldn’t resist. Because if this heavenly pie tastes half as good as it smells, this will be in the permanent rotation. Having compared SO many pecan pie recipes, the technique and ingredient list of this one caught my eye. Caramel being my favorite flavor, that is what this smells like. I liked that you cook/boil the filling, that it contains flour as a thickener and binder, that it has a reasonable — not crazy — amount of sugars, that it calls for a blind baked shell, that it uses a lot of pecans, that those pecans are lightly toasted to heighten the flavor and there is some bourbon in there that rounds everything out. The only correction that I would offer is that my bake time was closer to an hour. Will update after we taste tomorrow. Thank you Chef John!

Me and other family members found this too sweet. Followed recipe as written. As another reviewer said the pastry stuck to the pan. I don’t think I will try it again not sure how to make it less sweet and still have the right consistency.

Turned out great. Great flavor and firm but still moist and easy to cut.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved; it was so good! Mom made her own traditional crust (no pie weights, but I did precook it before putting it the filling), so I can't vouch for chef John's. In the filling, I used a tad less white sugar and a tad more bourbon. The toasted pecans gave a great flavor, and it was all very delicious.

This was so good, but don't even think about cutting in to it for at least 3-4 hours unless you prefer a runny pecan pie. For a perfect pie, chill for 12 hours.

Mine was a bit chewy also.  The crust stuck to the sides and about 1/3 down the pan.

Great Recipe! I absolutely love Chef John. This was my first attempt at a pecan pie and it turned out deliciously! Will defiantly be making this again. :)

This was awesome!!! My husband loves it even more frozen. I used the homemade butter flaky pie crust and it was a great addition to the Thanksgiving table.

Oh. My. Goodness, this is a fantastic Pecan Pie.  Even my husband, who doesn't like pecan pie and only tried a bite to be polite because I was so ecstatic about it, loved it!
