This was just ok for us.  Despite reading the prior reviews, I was still surprised at how bland this soup was, even with increasing the dill weed and ground mustard.  Mr. LTH liked that it was "hearty", but I wasn't a fan of the texture.  I'm glad to be getting a lot of nutrients, but I don't think we'll make this one again. Thanks for the recipe, tgirlz!

This is just an ok basic recipe. I found it bland and had to add more dill and mustard powder after the salt and pepper. Also I used 8oz. of chedder instead of the 6oz. and didn't find it that cheesy. Will try a different recipe next time.
