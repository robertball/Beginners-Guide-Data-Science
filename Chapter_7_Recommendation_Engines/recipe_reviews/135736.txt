Pretty good cocktail but I think traditional Pi√±a Colada without Irish cream is more delicious. I also added more pineapple juice and cream of coconut.

Good, but not sure that I like the Irish cream in this drink.  I added more pineapple juice and cream of coconut to my glass to cut the taste of the Irish cream . . . and I like Irish cream, but not in a pina colada!  I also think this should be mixed altogether in the blender so that it's all cold and the crushed ice melts more than it does with just half a cup of the mix.  Not sure that this is my ultimate pina colada recipe.
