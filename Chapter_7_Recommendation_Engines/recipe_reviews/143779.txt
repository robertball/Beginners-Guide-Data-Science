As I was making this dish, I really started to wonder how it was going to work out - it just seemed like so many different flavours  to be adding into one bowl, but it worked out really well and we all loved it. I served it with coconut rice. It has a very refreshing flavour from the mint and the lime. Thanks!

I omitted the chicken breast and red chile pepper; added 1 large red bell pepper and 1 jalapeno on hand--which added nice color interest. The flavors melded well--although I would have liked more dressing to allow people to serve themselves. This recipe definitely served 6 people ample helpings.

This is a keeper for us.  We used chinese cabbage instead of iceburg, pomelo instead of grapefruit (milder and firmer), and offered toasted crushed ramen noodles, chopped peanuts and pepper flakes as toppings.  Yum!    I think next time I'll let it sit overnight to let the flavors come out more and and try toasting the coconut first.    Thanks for the recipe!

It's a good idea but it would need some adjustments. It was way too acidic.  I would use less lime juice and some salt to the dressing.

Well, there are a lot of different flavors going on here. The one thing that I thought kind of sent the flavor balance over the edge was the grapefruit. I also thought the dressing could've used a little something more. It was a good starting-off point. With a few tweeks, I would make again! Thanks!

Just didn't like it. 
I cook to live, not live to cook.  I am not a good cook, I try to do a good job and make food as good as I can, just much rather be doing so many OTHER things.  I probably did something very wrong.

2.15.16   Had large shrimp on hand, so I just cut them into smaller pieces.  Followed the recipe to the letter, tasted, and then added another Thai chili pepper to kick up the heat.  I think it could have used a bit more dressing, and I will add a splash of soy sauce to the dressing in the future.  We enjoyed this salad.
