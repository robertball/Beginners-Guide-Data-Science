I think this is a good healthy recipe - especially when I see all the recipes with bacon, cream etc - this is simple, easy to cook and I think among the more healthy recipes

Since I was cooking for more than 1 child I decided to bake this.  I scaled the recipe for 6 but only used 2 tbs of maple syrup and I baked it at 400F for 20 minutes.  I think it could have used more apricots for the scaled version.  I also think in the future I would shred the sprouts in the food processor.  All in all, this is a good idea with a tasty result.  Thanks, Shahana
