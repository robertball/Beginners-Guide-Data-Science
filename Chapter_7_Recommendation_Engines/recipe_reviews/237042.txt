Followed the recipe except I substituted Truvia Baking Blend for the white sugar.  The recipe doesn’t state to use a mixer or to mix by hand.   I used the KA mixer on the “Stir” setting, which was a lot easier than mixing by hand, and it had a nice crumbly texture.  Set the timer for 45 minutes, and it was overdone which unfortunately resulted in a somewhat dry cake.  It just wasn't as moist as I expected, particularly since it had buttermilk in it.  Granted, this may be an issue with the temp of my oven, but  in the future, I’ll start checking for doneness at about 35 minutes.  I also will add 1 tsp of baking powder, as I would have liked more rise on the cake.  On the positive side, really enjoyed the flavor of this simple coffee cake, and I will make it again.

I followed the recipe except for one change, I added cinnamon to the batter after I took out the one cup for the topping! My family loved it!! Have made it twice in less than four days! Thanks for the amazing recipe!

Personally i would just buy the Krusteaze mix. it taste better and is far cheaper considering this recipe calls for two sticks of butter. Not that this recipe taste bad its fine.

Made it for a class project and everyone loved it. It tastes best when warm. I think I'll make it again pretty soon because it was great.

I followed the advice of other reviewers by adding 1 tsp of vanilla, mixing the cinnamon into the crumbly topping, and baking for 35 minutes.  I also lessened the white and brown sugar from 1 cup each to 3/4 cups each.  

I've made this several times. We love this coffee cake!

I had to make 3 different coffee cakes for a breakfast carry-in at school.  This was a nice basic recipe.  It was best warm from the oven, but once completely cool, it didn't have near the flavor it does when served warm.  I did really enjoy the crunchy topping.

This is a wonderful basic coffee cake, delicious warm from the oven with fresh strawberries.  I added a little vanilla for warmth.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I like that it's not overly sweet as many coffee cakes are. I pulsed the ingredients together with my food processor and it came out great. I only baked it for 35 minutes and it was perfect. The only thing I would do differently is mix the cinnamon into the topping before sprinkling on top for more even distribution.
