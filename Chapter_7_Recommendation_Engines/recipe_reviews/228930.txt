Just posting a few hints to those of you trying them.  I had in the initial recipe that I sent to allrecipes that you need to have wet hands when you pad these out.  Ground chicken is a much wetter consistency than beef or turkey.  We have had these with toppings of cheddar cheese and bacon, extra pineapple slices, avocado and just tonight we tried the new Siracha Ketchup on the market.  That was a winner!  It doesn't hurt if you want to make a batch and freeze them....that's probably one of the easiest ways to handle them, however I've made them so much that I find it's just easier to keep my hands wet.  Hope these hints help....enjoy!

We add a few more jalapenos & throw them in the freezer while we heat the charcoal grill up to let them set a bit.  Very yummy!

These were ok.  I used teriyaki marinade because I had an open bottle in the fridge.  That may have been why I was underwhelmed.  This recipe has potential though.  I will try it again and tinker with it.  Maybe some kind of spiced mayo will do the trick.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious flavor combination.  Had to add about half a cup of plain bread crumbs to form the patties  - too loose to form without the breadcrumbs.  Will make again.

I've made these more than once. I substitute the terryaki with 1/4 cup of sweet Vidalia onion dressing and they are wonderful.

Pretty good!  I was surprised that the consistency was a little 'wet'- and didn't hold shape like it would if it was just ground beef or chicken. But they still grilled fine- I used my indoor grill (plates on top and bottom. I started just glopping it into a ball and the grill pressed it down nicely. Tasted better than just plain burgers. Probably will use more pepper next time (I didn't use jalapenos.)

Too wet. Burgers did not hold their shape. Instead we ended up making it into a ground beef dish.

Very tasty! I used homemade teriyaki sauce, nice and thick! Topped them with lettuce, bacon and sriracha mayo and put them on Kings Hawaiian rolls.

Could be a little bland , kicked it up with a little ground jalape√±o pepper ground with the chicken. also used sriracha ketchup  like another reviewer wrote helped a lot with flavor . my mixture was to wet maybe I didn't drain the pineapple enough or my chicken had to much moisture so I added breadcrumbs to dry it up a bit and cooked on a griddle, It would of went right thru the grill grates as wet as it was.

Very wet consistency.  I thought maybe I didn't drain the pineapple enough but I can tell from the other reviews that this is how they are.  I just added bread crumbs to help form them into patties.  They grilled up ok.  Kinda bland but I didn't use the jalapeno.  Next time I'll spice it up a bit more.

Made these according to the recipe and really enjoyed the flavor.  As others have mentioned, the ground chicken was very soft.  Adding the teriyaki sauce made it even softer.  I shaped them into loose patties, placed on a place and popped them int the freezer for a while so that they would hold their shape when I placed them on the grill.  I have two more in the freezer so we will be enjoying them again real soon.

This came out quite good. The only thing I did differently was add some bread crumbs and an egg, to help hold it together while cooking. I'll be making this again, for sure.

These were not very flavorful and I did add a bit of bread crumbs as suggested and greased my grill etc... and they totally ALL FELL APART. Won't make again...
