Excellent! I loved this tasty breakfast! I'm making it again tonight. This is so versatile, you can easily use different fruits or milks. I made it with non-fat milk last night, but tonight I will use almond milk. The consistency is perfect. I might use a tiny bit less cinnamon (personal preference), but other than that, the ingredients are spot on. Yum!

This a good idea to start with but needs tweaking.  I used half the cinnamon and it was still too much.  I did not like the taste of uncooked cinnamon.  I also replaced the chia seeds with hemp seeds, as uncooked chia seeds sets off my irritable bowel.  Next time, I will use vanilla instead of cinnamon.

I do love the idea of having a cold oatmeal to eat in the hot summer, and not having to heat up my house cooking it.

Update:  I used 1/4 tsp. vanilla instead of the cinnamon and it tasted much better.

Wow, this was good. And so easy. And so customizable. I used my homemade almond milk instead of regular milk, and added fresh fruit the next morning plus a splash more almond milk to loosen up the texture just a bit. In my next jar, I added a tablespoon of unsweetened shredded coconut plus blueberries. In the jar after that, I added a few chopped nuts and fresh peach. There's really no end to what you can do with this excellent base recipe.

I love this recipe, though I took it in a different direction. I used a stick blender to blend the entire thing and added more milk to get a smoothie. It is awesome I've made it everyday this week. I make a different variation every morning. My favorite so far is a Tbs of peanut butter and a tsp cocoa powder along with some cayenne for a little zing. This keeps me full and stops the snacking till lunch. yum!

I've been trying different overnight oatmeal recipes lately, and I really enjoyed this one. I make 3 or 4 at a time, so I have them on hand for a healthy breakfast or snack. I used almond milk and vanilla greek yogurt, and cut back a bit on the cinnamon (to about 1/4 tsp) per jar. Having one of these in the morning keeps me satisfied until lunch!

You can alter this recipe in so many different ways so it never gets old!!!  Milk, almond milk, coconut milk, plain yogurt, vanilla yogurt (I can't hang with you, Greek yogurt) blueberries, strawberries whatever you want to use!!!   I'm so impressed right now.  So many ideas lol!

This recipe was a great jumping off point for me because the base ingredients really made for a hearty product. I like a certain consistency so I tweaked it a bit. (More oatmeal, less honey and cinnamon and I made it with a smidge more yogurt. I used Noosa!! Delish??) fresh berries really added a great texture. I'm not normally a soft oatmeal fan but I'm diggin this creamy cooking alternative!

I know it says this is best with berries - but my favorite fruit is chopped apple.   I like to chop apple and almonds and add them in the morning.  YUMMY!

I have made this 4-5 times now. I use vanilla instead of cinnamon, as others suggested. This gets the ratio just right, so I also use it as a base for other flavours. (Others have turned out too thick or too funny). DO NOT SKIP the chia seeds! I think they are essential to a successful overnight oats recipe.

I like making oatmeal like this the night before. And it's so convenient in a jar. However, I did not like this one cold. I had to cook it in the microwave for 60 seconds, and then I liked it.

So good! I didn't have chia seeds but used everything else. Layered oatmeal and blueberries until the jars were full. Perfect breakfast!

I found this recipe in the magazine and wanted to try it. I have never had cold oatmeal or chia seeds before. It was pretty good, but maybe I have just need to get used to cold oatmeal? I cut back on the chia seeds by half and cut the honey back because I used sweetened almond milk and regular vanilla yogurt and it was still too sweet. Next time, Ill make it less sweet somehow and maybe even cut back on the cinnamon a little. I used bananas and they were a nice addition. It was very filling and something I will probably experiment with in the future.

Fantastic! Made it 'dairy-free' with coconut milk and So Delicious' Dairy-Free yogurt. Used about half the cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers and subbed in maple syrup as suggested by the author. Prepped a second jar of dry ingredients while making this yesterday so it will be even quicker to assemble tonight! Thank you!

This is a great base recipe to work with. Here's a recent rendition I tried that turned out great. Multiply recipe by 4. Use 2 cups mueslix instead of oatmeal. Use milled flax instead of chia (just as good but cheaper).  I always use almond milk and leave out the honey and cinnamon. Yummy!

This is really easy and a delicious, healthy breakfast. I substituted maple syrup for honey and flax seeds for chia seeds. I also added fresh sliced banana in the morning instead of blueberries. This is a super versatile recipe, and so good that I ate it for breakfast and lunch!

This was so delicious. I had tasted a chia seed pudding before and could not stand the texture but in this recipe it just has the texture of oatmeal. It was super delicious! I cant wait to try different berries.

Easy, yumtastic & healthy! Perfect for the morning rush.  I did make a few changes: doubled the berries, used unsweetened almond milk,  halved the cinnamon,  added vanilla and I think that's it...great idea!

Excellent!  But this is a LOT of cinnamon.  I didn't add the full amount because I ran out, but it still had a VERY intense cinnamon flavor.  So you should probably cut the cinnamon in half or so.  The next morning, I added strawberries and sliced almonds.  Delicious.

This is a great basic recipe!  You can change the ingredients any way you like to suit your taste.  I made mine with cashew milk,and frozen blueberries but any milk/fruit combo would work.  It sure makes busy mornings easy.

Delicious - I used almond/coconut milk and a few sprinkles of cinnamon. I also added a large pinch of shredded coconut.

I don't like cinnamon in my oats so I left it out. I have T2 diabetes, so I used 1.5 teaspoons of Truvia brown sugar blend and plain nonfat yogurt bc that's what I had.  It was delicious!  I usually eat steel cut oats, but this is a welcome change. Its a keeper!

I honestly didn't like this. The reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it's mostly a texture thing for me and I know that's not the recipe's fault. I did add walnuts to my mix for some extra protein and crunch.

So good! My concerns were 1. I had never made/eaten overnight oats, wasn’t sure if I would like it cold. 2. I had never eaten chia seeds, wasn’t sure what the taste/texture  would be like. 3. This seems like a lot of cinnamon for a single bowl. —> It turned out so good I can’t wait to eat it again! I love cinnamon and the cinnamon/honey combo is what made it for me. The cold oats didn’t bother me, and I couldn’t taste the chia seeds so that was fine and I still get the health benefits. It reminded me of a pudding with some texture to it. Can’t wait to make it again! I loved having breakfast ready for me without having to decide what sounded good in the moment.

Perfect as written! Very easy to create new flavors and/or diet needs too. I made with almond milk and almond yogurt to create a dairy-free version. Dairy-free version minus honey and oatmeal creates Whole30 version. All delicious. I made a version with blueberry yogurt and fresh blueberries (no cinnamon). I made a version with strawberry yogurt, chopped strawberries and a sprinkle of mini chocolate chips on top. Endless possibilities!

Really enjoyed this recipe but do think that the greek yogurt could use some modification. Next time I try this recipe, I will definitely try a little less greek yogurt as I feel like it slightly overpowered the taste last time I tried it. If you're a big fan of greek yogurt shouldn't be a problem for you!

I loved it!!! I don't like to eat hot oatmeal so this was wonderful for me. My husband liked a lot too and he has everyday  oatmeal for breakfast.  We only added a little bit more of honey but just because we like sweet oatmeal. Would I make this again?... Oh Yes!!!...I see myself eating this in the near future.

I had been wanting to try the no-cook oatmeal for awhile but was skeptical.  This was AWESOME!  So easy, time saving and delicious.    The only change I made was to cut the cinnamon in half.  Thanks for posting!

Made it last week.  I loved it!  Was not sure if I could like eating it cold but it was really good. Followed the recipe as is but used chopped apples instead blueberries, added almonds and rasins.

I love this recipe! I experimented a little worth the milk to oats ratio and found that I like a 1 to 1 measurement best. I also omitted the cinnamon and replaced it with a few drops of vanilla extract, just to add a little less punching flavor. It's so nice to have a recipe that allows for plenty of variety; adding blueberries is good, adding raspberries is good, adding mashed banana and peanut butter is good. Love it!

I love this. I have never been a lover of oatmeal. I know it's good for me and I should be eating it but, yuck! Since trying this recipe(it was in the magazine), I love oatmeal this way! I make two batches and eat it for breakfast over 4 mornings! Thanks!

I have tried this recipe with some adjustment.
I used strawberry and full cream milk.

It's the best overnight oat recipe I've tried so far.
The texture is rich and creamy because of greek yogurt.

Of coarse I had to make changes, coconut milk in lieu milk, and goat yogurt replaced Greek yogurt (only because that is what was in the frig).  Both the wife and I loved it with blueberries and bananas, which were folded in the next day.

This recipe was SO easy to make. It was good but WAY too much cinnamon (and I love cinnamon). I will try again with just a pinch of cinnamon and vanilla Greek yogurt (vs plain) for a little more flavor. Blueberries and bananas are my favorite mix-ins.

Made this for a work breakfast.  I personally don't like greek yogurt, so used low fat vanilla and flax seed. Additionally, I used only 1 tsp of honey and made 4 different kinds.   Banana-walnut, apple cinnamon, blueberry and berry.  For each kind, I used different seasoning (cinnamon, cardamom, vanilla, & nutmeg.  Each flavor was a big hit.

It is a little strong on the cinnamon, but the recipe can be altered as much as you want to suit your tastes.  The texture is a little off, but otherwise, it is delicious.

Great idea and time saving method, particularly for warmer weather on its way.  The texture is satisfyingly creamy.  Many fruit and spice variations are possible.  I have already substituted the milk/yogurt for kefir.  I prefer to add the fruit at the time of eating.

Super easy!  I don’t use the amount of cinnamon the recipe calls for.   It’s way too much in my opinion.   And I used a mixture of chia/flax/hemp seed and I use almond milk.   This is a great tasting recipe, I eat it cold with sliced strawberries.   I highly recommend!

I give it 2 stars because it's a pretty decent base recipe. However, unless one likes the taste of oats and bitter chalk, 1 tsp of cinnamon is FAR TOO MUCH for less than 1 cup of finished product. So much that I threw away my first attempt at anything with chia seeds. I would start out with no more than 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Maybe even 1/8. Shoot...I would not have wasted it if I had sprinkled in the cinnamon.

This version gets the proportions just right. It's a great "basic" "starting point" recipe, perfect for modifying with your own preferences. I use yogurt with artificial sweetener so I don't add honey or any other sweeteners, and with fruit it's plenty sweet enough.

Would make again! 

Might try using more oats and less honey, but that's just a preference.

Easy to make and very tasty.  I make enough for four servings.  I add less honey and use either vanilla almond milk or coconut milk.  I also use vanilla yogurt and then add only a half teaspoon of honey.  Excellent recipe!

I actually made 4 servings with the full fat coconut milk instead of yogurt, I also added a few drops of vanilla.  In 2 of the jars,  I put banana, with cocoa powder (1 tsp) and instant coffee (1/4 tsp) and swapped out 1/2 of the chia for ground flax. The other 2, I put unsweetened applesauce with cinnamon and other spices. I added a 1/2 scoop of vegan protein powder.  They all looked really dry so I splashed some filtered water in each before mixing.

I decided to give this recipe a go and it’s great! I used half the amount of cinnamon because I’m not a huge fan and it really made a difference. I love that I can prep several jars at a time and have a healthy breakfast waiting when I get up.

Surprising great! I did use half the cinnamon and added blueberries and strawberries in the morning. 5 out of 5 guests loved it! I’m making it again tonight. One guest wanted soy milk, so I obliged. She asked for the recipe. One of tomorrow’s guest doesn’t partake in ANY dairy so I’m using vegan (almond milk) yogurt and soy milk. I won’t make the other 4 people suffer with that kind of diet but the wonderful thing is that I can make everyone happy. Perfection!

Wow, wow, wow!  I haven’t been this excited about a recipe in a while!  I absolutely loved this.  I really wasn’t sure how it was going to come out but I’m so glad I tried this.  I left out the honey and cinnamon, just a personal preference. Are used three packets of Stevia and frozen blueberries. Delicious! I also tried it with fresh strawberries, even better! Thanks so much for the recipe. I think this will be my breakfast every day for the summer.

Waaaay too much cinnamon (which made it hard to eat). But I think if I decrease it to 1/4 tsp the recipe would be great!

I made this a couple of times and I will continue making it. My daughter loves it for breakfast. I use whatever fruit we have on hand and only add a bit of cinnamon.   
Great breakfast recipe for on the go occasions.

Great recipe. I did add about a tsp of coco powder, no berries (as I didn't have any), little bit of brown sugar. And then when it's was ready to eat I topped with a sprinkle of granola and roasted walnuts. 

I followed other people's instructions and cut the cinnamon down. Definitely be making this again.

This has become my daily breakfast with a couple of minor modifications. I use unsweetened vanilla almond milk, 1 T of Splenda (instead of honey), 2 T of flax seed meal (instead of chia seeds) & 1 full cup of frozen berry blend. I set up a whole weeks worth of breakfasts in 5 minutes, it’s low cal (262), high fiber, high protein, high in HDL, filling AND delicious! My nutritionist gave me a big thumbs up on this recipe.

My only changes were to cut the cinnamon to scant 1/2 tsp and I mixed in a little granola before I ate it.  I loved this and have made it again adding chopped almonds in the morning for a healthier crunch!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It's very easy to make and a tasty breakfast. I will continue to make this while tweaking the ingredients and amounts, just to experiment. Depending on the amount you're making, this can easily be made and kept in a bowl rather than a jar, although you will need to securely cover the bowl. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who likes oatmeal.

This is my go to breakfast everyday. I add coconut chips, almond slivers, pumpkin & sunflower seeds, dried blueberries or cranberries or cherries depending on what I have on hand. I also change up the spices: pumpkin pie spice is yummy during the season. There are so may different recipes that you cannot get tired of this. Funny I cannot (NO WAY) eat cooked oatmeal, but this I just love. I use soy or almond milk. No cows milk.

Did what others suggested and cut back cinnamon to 1/2 tsp and cut back on honey to 1 tsp...it was fantastic!  So easy and love that I can make a good breakfast at night so my sleepy head can stay in bed just that bit longer!  :)

My fav overnite oats now. I used unsweetened almond milk, though. For sweetness i used a bit of splenda. Of course a squirt of whip cream!!! I'm assuming 1 tsp cinnamon is a typo? I used 1/8th tsp for this amount.

You guys literally I'm the worst, laziest cook EVER! I recently started packing my lunch because let's be real- buying lunch can be super expensive. The only thing I did differently was add granola bc I don't have chia seeds.... yet. Made this overnight took it to work. It is the easiest, most convenient, most delicious to go meal I can think of. Made one for my boyfriend also and he ate every bite. So all in all I would say try it! I had mine cold but hear you can heat them but you know... that takes too much time :P

Been wanting to try this for awhile. I liked it ok.  I do not like honey so skipped that. I could see doing all kinds of different variations on this recipe. Thank you.

Very versatile. I make a batch of four at once and they last well. I've used non-fat/unsweetened almond milk and coconut milk, and non-fat milk, all with great results. I use about one third of the cinnamon and add a sprinkle of salt for each serving.

Too much cinnamon.  I suggest you just shake it in until it looks like a good amount to you. 

Anyway, I make changes to suit my toddler with intestinal issues. Instead of milk, I fill 1/3 c. measuring cup most way with prune juice, then to top with milk. the other 1/3 cup is flavored kefir and milk mixture. I also use 1 tbsp ground flax seeds instead of chia to add a smoother texture (toddler's choice) and I use a bit of maple syrup instead of honey to round it off.  So I guess that's lots of changes, but the spirit of the recipe is still there.

I tried it with plain yogurt, honey, vanilla and cinnamon, and again with whole milk and maple syrup and didn't care for it at all.  I didn't care for the 'uncooked' texture, and didn't like that it was cold.  Maybe it's a matter of just getting used to the taste, but I don't need to get used to something when there are so many other better tasting ways to eat oatmeal.  Sorry.

I wish I had read the reviews before making this. Although the recipe is very basic and you can build off of it, the quantity of cinnamon is too much especially because my toddlers were going to eat it. Definitely going to try Vanilla next time to mellow it down a little and maybe just a small pinch of cinnamon or even pumpkin spice.

This was delicious, although there was way too much cinnamon in the recipe. I made it a second time and used 1/4 tsp, which was much better. Also added almonds. Yum!

I am no fan of having cold oatmeal, but I gave it a shot. It wasn't bad but not outstanding either. I will go back to my conventional warm and mildly sweet oatmeal.

Reduced cinnamon to 1/2 tsp.  Added 1/2 tsp. Vanilla.  Used maple syrup instead of honey and reduced to 1 tsp.  Very good recipe, better than some that only use milk.  The yogurt really gives it a nice body.

This recipe has far too much cinnamon! Without the cinnamon I think it would have been nice but the cinnamon made it inedible and it went in the bin. I'd say either completely omit the cinnamon or only put in 1/4 of what the recipe says.

I did alter it slightly.  I skipped the cinnamon (agreeing with others that I'm not a huge fan of it raw), also skipped the honey.  I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk, and added part of a scoop of vanilla protein powder.  I also cut the chia seeds down to 1.5t from the 2 and doubled the blueberries.  Can't do the cold oatmeal so I actually heated mine up a bit before eating.  Great grab'n'go breakfast!

This is a great, easy, healthy recipe  that can be adjusted to any type of fruit you want.   For me it was different to eat oatmeal cold, but it could be warmed up if you preferred it that way.  For it to be healthier I don't think the honey is necessary.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely gorgeous. Just like everyone else, I only used half tsp of cinnamon. 
I'm just about to make it again for tomorrow morning!

I have tried multiple overnight oat recipes and this is the best. I cut the Cinnamon in half and I don't use chia seeds. Great recipe!

Delicious and very filling.  I use unsweetened almond milk instead of dairy milk and used a small container of pineapple Greek yogurt, so I didn't need to use the honey.  I have made this recipe twice and the 1st time I used the 1 tsp. cinnamon,  which was too strong (but a half teaspoon  probably would have worked with peaches or apples and vanilla or apple flavored yogurt).  The second time I used a splash of vanilla in place of the cinnamon and it was better.  I am excited to try additional variations by adding coconut, banana chips and various berries.

This was absolutely delicious. 
I did however make a few changes
I did not use the Honey, Cinnamon,  or Chia seeds as I did not have those on hand.
I added Splenda for sweetness and sliced banana's and strawberries. 

It made for a great on the go breakfast and I plan on tweaking the recipe the next time I make it.

My kids and I love this recipe. We use honey flavored Greek yogurt. But what makes our recipe is that we use Montana Huckleberries instead of blueberries. We make enough for breakfast and an afternoon snack.

So tasty and easy to make! The ingredients keep well in case you don't want to commit to making it every day for a week. The only tweak I've made is to use a dash of cinnamon instead of a teaspoon. Love this recipe!

I reduced the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp.  It was hard to get the honey blended by shaking it, and by morning the honey was harder,  so it didn't want to mix.  I might use agave nectar instead next time.

This tasted pretty great. I didn't have any cinnamon so i just didn't add it. I also used ground flax seeds in place of chia seeds. I was worried with how much it would end up swelling to, and it was a decent portion with a banana mixed in.

This is a great recipe, and very versatile.  I couldn't find chia seeds in my grocery store, but Kroger does offer an instant organic oatmeal with chia seeds.  I used the maple syrup and brown sugar flavor and added no other sweeteners.  Basically I pour 1/3rd cup instant oatmeal, 1/3rd cup milk, and 1/3rd cup greek yogurt (plain or vanilla) into the pint jar and shake.  I have added both fresh and frozen fruit, including blueberries, strawberries and peaches.  Very filling and complete meal, and I don't need lunch!

I make this all the time to have ready for a quick breakfast. My favorites are strawberries with vanilla, instead of blueberries and cinnamon. I have also done chopped pears , applesauce with cinnamon. Or, bananas with maple syrup and pecans. YUMMY

Loved this. It is so easy and very filling for breakfast. I cut back on the cinnamon for personal preference. I just used a 5 oz tub of the Greek  blueberry yogurt to make it easy.

This is so good! I made it the first time as written (except I added a tsp of vanilla) and i really liked it but I wanted it a little thicker. The second time I made it, I doubled everything but the milk and found it a little too thick so I will probably double everything except the milk (I will use 1/2 c of milk w the doubled ingredients) and I think I will get the perfect consistency. This is so easy and so healthy. I just had a baby and I love that I can make this in advance and have it ready whenever I am hungry and have a chance to eat breakfast:) 

I add 1/2 c of blueberries and two large strawberries. I am also going to try some slivered almonds with poached diced pears.

I followed the other reviews and used less cinnamon and I was very happy with the result.  I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk as well  but that was the only change I made.  This will certainly become a regular in the work breakfast rotation!  So easy to make a few ahead of time then just grab and go!

This recipe has been my go-to oatmeal breakfast for several months now. I instead use almond milk and raw honey.  I think this recipe tastes great, is convenient, and has such healthy ingredients.
