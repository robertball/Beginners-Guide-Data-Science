Don't add sugar to the filling in this recipe! Traditionally Hungarian Kifli is seved dusted with powdered sugar, or served with a small bowl of powdered sugar on the side to dip into.  Allowing each person to create their own desired sweetness...just a tip.

I agree with the poster below... DO NOT add sugar to the filling. It's not suppossed to be an overly sweet cookie, as to why it is dusted with powdered sugar.

This is probalby the closest to my grandmother's recipe, but as any good Hungarian knows every family had thier own small spin on things. 

You can also add prune preserve or apricot preserve as a filling if walnuts are not your thing (or there is an allergy).

Great cookies.....but I agree with the reviewer below.  You need to add at LEAST a 1/2 cup (or 1 cup) of sugar to make them taste good.  Also, what I do, is roll, or sprinkle them with powdered sugar when still slightly warm.  Maybe they are for diabetics, I dunno.....These have been part of my holiday cookie tray for 2 years now.....

This turned out really well. I couldn't stop eating them. My Gran used to put sugar in the dough but I did not. I did put two pitted prunes in each one instead of the nuts and they were great. Gran used to make them with lekvar that she made. The prunes tasted the same. I accidentally let the dough sit for a week in the fridge. It actually puffed! I would use this dough for a pot pie and I will try it. Superior!

Although I liked this recipe, I think that next time I will add sugar to the nut mixture. It was VERY bland tasting. I would recommend adding sugar to when you add cinnamon and possibly sprinkling with sugar before baking if you are interested in anything remotely sweet.

Not bad, a much lighter version of the Kifli recipe my great grandmother brought over from Hungry.
