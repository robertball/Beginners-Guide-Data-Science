I made this for a Christmas dinner side dish this year and got rave reviews.  I did tweak it a little...I sauteed the onion first, chopped up the broccoli a little and increased the Ritz Crackers to about a 1/2 sleeve.  I also used sharp cheddar for a stronger flavor and added a tablespoon of garlic salt and used low sodium mushroom soup instead

THANK YOU for a recipe that calls for REAL CHEESE and not process cheese spread or Velveeta or any other goo that's not real cheese!  I had no crackers so I left them off (DH is gluten intolerant anyway). That said, I also had to make my own cream of mushroom soup (couldn't take the chance that Campbell's has wheat in it) but that was no problem. I had leftover rice, and broccoli flowerets and onion cook in minutes in the microwave, so I basically just stirred everything together and heated it up.  Thanks for the inspiration!

Loved this casserole. I made it as a side dish with our pork chops and it was great! The crunch of the Ritz on top really made this dish stand out. I didn't have enough cheddar on hand but it was still really good. I did, however, cook the rice separately as we do not use instant rice-therefore i omitted the water. I will be making this casserole again !!

This darn broccoli casserole was REALLY good!!  My tweaks: I cooked the rice first and replaced the water with milk, used reduced calorie cream of chicken instead of mushroom, used 1/2 sleeve of wheat ritz crackers, and about a 1 and 1/2 cup of cheese instead of 2.  I also added a little pepper and garlic salt to the mix.  AWESOME!! :)

I had planned to eat leftovers the next day...but there weren't any!!  I added 1 can cream of celery soup, substitued milk for the water, and used fresh brocolli (2 stalks) instead of frozen.  I added some Italian spice for flavor, and cut the cheese in half....my husband asked if we could have it for T-Day!!!!

Good and easy recipe.  I'm the guy that is always designated to bring paper plates and napkins to the family get togethers.  So when I brought this broccoli casserole everyone was nervous.  Turned out to be a hit.  One family member said it was the best she's had.  
I made a few changes...substituted milk for water, and increased the amount of milk by 1/2 cup...and doubled the amount of crackers and butter for the topping.

I subbed a cup of milk for the water and used more crackers than called for. This was delicious! I would use very little onion next time.

I use cheddar cheese soup instead of the mushroom soup and 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup milk. This ones a keeper. Fast and easy to put together.

While it was easy, it didn't have much flavor.  Maybe adding some hot sauce, garlic or herbs would have given it the extra kick it needed.  May try again with some revisions.

This was okay, nothing spectacular.  No one had any complaints but they didn't love it either.  I did have to add about an additional 1/2c. of water and bake a little longer because the rice was not done in the stated time.

I found this to be absolutely scrumptious, and everything I was looking for in a side dish casserole. Boiling pasta, cooking rice... if I'm going to cook the food in the first place, why bake it for an hour? This took minutes to prep and tasted awesome. I used brown instant rice, cheese soup instead of mushroom as I am a cheesy broccoli fiend, and used the whole 16oz frozen bag I had. I am not a big fan of onion and like lots of recipes, decided to use onion powder instead of fresh chopped: worked great for me. I will most definitely be making this again, it's the perfect veggie/starch side when you're main event is meat. Thanks SO MUCH for sharing!

made this just tonight- really good! my gf & i raved over it and leftovers will be kept for tomorrow's lunch. i made some tweaks, tho. instead of uncooked rice, i used broccoli & cheddar quick rice and cooked it first in the rice cooker.  also used panko herbal crumbs instead of crackers.  and didn't use frozen broccoli but fresh ones, steamed just a bit. it's in my opinion that the quick rice supported the flavor for this dish. we'd do this again, with guests to impress 'em!  do this recipe! (we baked it for just 30 min- easy)

I've made this twice; the second time it was wonderful because I sauteed the chopped onion first, and also nuked the frozen broccoli for 5 minutes before tossing everything together (and cut it up since it was whole florets).  ALSO, I used Club Crackers instead of Ritz, and believe it or not, this made a huge difference!  My family loved it.  I threw in some leftover cooked chicken at the end for my son, but I prefer it without the chicken.

Not bad, not great.  I did add 1/2 c. additional water but it could have used another 1/2 c (1 total cup extra) easily.  Took 1 hr 15 minutes to cook.  Definitely needs salt and pepper.  Not sure if I'll try again.

Very good; will make again.  Used instant brown rice, and because I was rushed used dried minced onion and added a bit of freeze dried garlic. Leftovers were just as yummy.  Leftover chicken would be a nice addition.

Update:  I've made this many times; it's good comfort food on chilly days.  Adding fresh mushrooms makes this recipe even better.  I melt the butter in a small glass bowl, then add the crushed crackers; that saves some cleanup.  Adding your choice of dried herbs to the cracker mix is nice, too. 

When I make this the morning of or the night before, I don't bother thawing the broccoli.   Leftovers freeze well, and it's always nice to have a ready-made side dish on hand.

I made this broccoli rice casserole as part of my vegetarian Thanksgiving Eve dinner and it was divine! It was just what I was looking for... broccoli was the star of the dish, NOT butter! The only changes I made were using veggie broth instead of water and omitting onions altogether (used 2 tsp of onion powder instead... boyfriend hates onion texture). I also sprinkled a handful of French fried onions on top along the cracker crumbs. My new favorite broccoli casserole!

Doubled the recipe, and made the following very slight changes: Used butter instead of margarine, and one can cream of chicken soup with the one can of cream of mushroom called for. Onion was a bit too much for me, but others in the party didn't mind (I asked). Raw onion and my stomach do not get along, but cooked onion (absolutely no crunch left) does not bother me at all. The onion in this recipe didn't cook as well as I thought it would. I may chop it in the food processor next time instead of by hand to see if that makes a difference. If not, I'll leave out the onion.

This recipe has been a staple in our menu for years; I started out making it for my family, and now, I make it for my husband and for big family events. It is always a hit! My only modification is adding half to three quarters of a sleeve of Ritz crackers. The topping is perfect, so I like to have a lot of it.

It was very good. I used one half cup water and one half cup milk, instead of the one cup water. I didn't use the onions. I used onion powder, and added some salt. I will definitely make it again!

We made this as a side dish for our homeless community and got rave reviews. This is easy to fix and we just changed the servings to 75.

This was good, just the recipe I was looking for.  I doubled it for Easter dinner.  I doubled everything except the onion.  And I added a few more crackers. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  I will definitely make this again.

Was good, but I think I'll add a little more cheese next time.

My husband made his for our big thanksgiving dinner.  It was loved by everyone.  He used milk rather than water, used a whole sleeve of crackers and 12 oz frozen broccoli.
