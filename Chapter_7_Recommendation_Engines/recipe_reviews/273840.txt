Great recipe that my partner said he would order in a restaurant! I looked at similarly titled recipes here and none had the ease of ingredients and preparation for such a high-quality dish.  I did bake the chicken earlier and warmed in the dish as the recipe states. I subbed in half and half, and it worked perfect (with a lower fat/calorie count). I used it to thin the sauce as needed. Fantastic recipe -- try it.
