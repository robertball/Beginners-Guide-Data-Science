Sweet and sticky and flavorful. I also tried it by substituting honey for the grape jelly and loved it. Colas are a great BBQ sauce ingredient. I recommend Dr. Pepper too.

Ok... this is not 5 star dining, but it is absolutely 5 star taste. The chicken comes out so tender and flavorful- it even looks delicious (grilling is the only way to go). Guests marvel, my family looks forward to it, and I love the compliments I get when I serve it.
