These were just "okay". They needed to be baked for longer than specified and they were crumbly and fell apart. I did add a small handfull of chocolate chips to the top. It made them quite sweet but just didn't do it for me. They did seem to taste better the second day.

I did not care to much for these. They were dry and bland. The need somthing to make them sweeter. Plus the baking times arent quite right. I don't think I would prebake the bottom, or only bake for about 5 minutes before adding the other toppings. The middle was no way creamy. I think this could be a really good recipe but needs some major tweeking.
