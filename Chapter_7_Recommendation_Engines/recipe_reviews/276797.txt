So will make this again ... my way!   

Cut asparagus into thirds...added to Frying pan with olive oil, butter, a minced clove of garlic (frozen cube) and abundant cracked pepper.  Scorched until done (el dente).  

Placed on bed of ricotta...off to side a bit to show of Ricotta smear (ricotta was NOT completely buried).

Fantastic!!!!!
