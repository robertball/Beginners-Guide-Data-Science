Well, this turned out delicious with just a few changes. First of all, I added one small chopped red pepper because the more veggies the better!  I used one can(14.5 oz.) petite diced tomatoes (undrained), in place of the fresh tomato.  I figured this would help with the dryness other reviewers mentioned.  I doubled the garlic, basil and oregano. I use much less pasta, otherwise it will be dry.  I skipped mixing together the parmesan and crackers,(who needs more dishes to wash), opting instead to just sprinkle them both on separate at the end,(I only used about 6 buttery crackers).  I would highly recommend this recipe as a way to help use up your abundance of zucchini.  Give it a try!

With a couple changes, this recipe is SOOOO good!!  Like previous posters I added a can of cream of chicken soup to the main mixture.  I also added a pound of browned italian sausage.  I used bread crumbs in place of the crackers.  Unbelievebly delicious!  I ate it 3 days in a row!!

This was a very good dish.  I did a little altering but it turned out really good.  I added ground beef and a small can of tomato sauce.  It was wonderful.  We have an abundance of zucchini in our garden right now, and it was nice to enjoy a different dish that used our zucchini.  Thanks!!

YUM!  I rated this 4 only b/c I "tweeked" the ingredients.  I heeded the comments of others about being dry, so I omitted the crackers & used only a fraction of the amount of pasta (~1/3).  For additional flavor I added red & green peppers.  Again, YUM!   With mods, this dish is a favorite w/my family!
P.S.  I simply cannot imagine adding canned soup to all these wonderful fresh veggies & herbs.

Use 1/2 c. fresh grated Parmesan cheese and 1/2c. dry Italian bread crumbs for topping.. doubled the garlic and use 1 can  fire roasted tomatoes--didn't drain.  If it still looks like it's going to be too dry you can always add a small can of tomato juice or V8 juice  and extra shredded mozzarella cheese.  If you need to feed meat eaters add a link or 2 of turkey/chicken Italian sausage--sliced or crumbled. Serve with a salad and garlic bread.

Very good, I used 4 large ripe plum tomatoes, added a chopped red pepper, doubled the basil and oregano and left out the celery flakes -- didn't have a full cup of mozzarella so I just sprinkled in what I had -- everyone enjoyed it!

SO GOOD! I used whole wheat spaghetti noodles (it's all I had) and I halved it because it's only for me BUT I put in the full amount of seasoning - a very good decision. I used a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes since I didn't have a large tomato on hand, and this helped to keep it from getting too dry. I added a can of mushrooms and left out the salt and pepper (mainly because I forgot). So filling and healthy! I will definitely make this again!

I LOVED this recipe! I added Yellow Squash to the mix and a little of the Mrs. Dash Onion & Herb for a little extra flavor, but it still turned out AWESOME!!! Loved it and would definitely make it again!

Fantastic!  The onions looked so good in the pan, I decided to add some sherry to them.  It added a little more sweetness to a delightful dish.

Tasted great!
Tweaked it a little. didnt have onion at home so replaced it with artichoke hearts. No parmesan so only used mozzarella cheese in and on top. Worked great. Used a can of crushed tomatoes and added a little milk too. Used some breadcrumbs.

Great recipe!

Good base recipe!  I added a pesto cream sauce due to others saying it was dry. I added green onion and fresh tomato. I also added Pecorino Romano with bread crumbs for topping.

I enjoyed playing with this recipe, but I can only give it three starts because I can't even imagine how dry it would have been if I hadn't made alterations.  I cut out the cracker/ parm filling entirely.  Then I used 2 tomatoes instead of one.  I also added half a can of tomato paste and maybe 3/4 of a cup of water.  I baked it with Panko bread crumbs on top.  It was great.  I would add even more paste/ water/ maybe milk? in the future.

Glad i read suggestions regarding doubling up the garlic.  Next time I plan to double up on both veggies and herbs.  I added chicken breast pieces and it came out great.

YUMMY. Definitely add the canned diced tomatoes and double the spices like other reviewers suggested. I left out the celery flakes and don't think it was missing anything. I even used whole wheat rotini and the kids ate it!

I thought this was a good mix, I might add more veggie mixture to it next time. The only thing I left out was the cornflakes and celery flakes. I really enjoy these types of pasta dishes!

This was great! I followed some suggestions and did some of my own alterations. I used the full amount of pasta. When I added the zucchini to the cooked onions, I put in 2 c of quartered Sungolds and cherry tomatoes (I had a LOT from my garden). I increased the oregano and basil, skipped the celery flakes and added red pepper flakes instead. Finally, I stirred one c of cottage cheese in with the pasta and veggies. I topped with parmesan (no crackers) and had extra parmesan on the table for those who wished to add a little more. Rave reviews - even from my zucchini-phobic 11 year old!

LOVED IT! Fast and easy to make. Turmed out delicious. I only put premade bread crumbs on top of the dish (instead of the parmesan mixture). I served it with some baked salmon, it was perfect....

It was o.k.  Not my favorite. Seemed a bit dry too-maybe I overcooked it. There are other zucchini recipes I like better.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. I was great. I added yellow squash, fresh spinach, yellow pepper canned tomatoes and used seasoned bread crumbs and it came out wonderful. You can really make this recipe your own with whatever veggies you have.

It was a hit with my family tonight.  I did take others advice to add a can of tomatoes.  Also added ground beef and fresh spinach.  So good.

I followed this recipe except for substituting bread crumbs for the saltine crackers and I have to say it's way too dry. I think it's missing an ingredient - oil or more tomatoes. Although I liked the green zucchini and the red tomato in the fry pan- very pretty! I think I would wait until my native tomatoes ripen in Aug and put several in with the zucchini. I should of read the reviews! The rating is for the recipe 'as is' not the potential of what it could be.

It has a great base...but was a little dry the first time I made it. The 2nd time I made it I added squash and 2 cans of diced tomatoes w/the juice. I also added cooked, shredded chicken to the recipe and put more basil and garlic. We will definitely have it again!

Quick, easy and not very flavourful. I added an extra tomato, and it still needed a sauce of some sort, so I mixed a few tablespoons of tomato paste with some water. I didnt add the crackers, as a reviewer suggested but the next time I try this, I will add them. definately needs 2 or 3 tomatoes and whatever extra flavours you enjoy.

This was very disappointing made following the recipe exactly.  It was very, very dry and the penne got tough and overcooked.  The topping was also dry.  The recipe did not call for covering it but I did with foil, which helped.  Will not make again

This was the second time to make this, and didn't have any noodles, so I grabbed some Jasmine rice I had on hand.  Gotta tell you, it was Fantastic! I will never be making this with noodles again!  The flovors blended so well with the jasmine rice!  Thanks for the recipe, but you gotta try it this way too!

Followed recipe for the most part.  I don't like basil or oregano and had celery salt not celery flakes.  I do agree though that it was dry.  I don't mind it like that, but wouldn't want to serve to company.  Will probably use more diced tomatoes next time, or try the cream of chicken soup.

Good base.  I love zucchini so I added more and made sure it stayed firm by adding to the pan with the onions at the last minute.  I added red pepper flakes for some much needed kick.  Next time I will leave out the crackers.  I used skim cheese and whole wheat pasta for a healthier dish and it was yummy.  Makes a GREAT side dish.  Thanks for the good recipe!

This was delicious and I will make it again. I didn't have the crackers so I used bread crumbs with the Parmesan cheese on top. I add more vegetables (2 zucchini & 2 yellow squash)when making this in the future. I add a can of diced tomatoes to prevent it from drying out.

This is delicious!  I was craving Mac and Cheese but didn't want some heavy, guilt-ridden recipe... "Adult Mac and Cheese", my husband called it, and my kid thought it was great, too!  I used half zucchini and half yellow squash, it looked more colorful that way.  Next time, I might try it with a can of those fire roasted tomatoes instead of regular... I love that flavor.

I messed up and forgot to add the pepper (both black and red).  I'm guessing this is NECESSARY.  Otherwise, there is no flavor.

This is excellent. I made just a minor change. I doubled the recipe because I have a big family and I added a can of cream of celery soup and a can of cream of chicken soup and one can of milk. This gave it a creaminess and prevented any dryness. Other than that I followed everything else in the original recipe. I make this every year with my garden zucchini and tomatoes. My family loves it!

Made this as the recipe is written and thought it was lacking flavor and it was a bit on the dry side. Wont be making it again.

My husband really liked this recipe, I liked it also, but I thought it was a little dry. I did replace the tomatoes with the petite diced tomatoes (with juices) like others suggested. I also doubled up on the garlic and added one small diced yellow squash.

I will make this recipe again, but I think I will add more liquid to the recipe and leave out the crackers.

I thought this recipe was delicious!  The key to it not being dry is to only bake it for 15 minutes - not 25 minutes - thats way too long and dries it out.  I also added some crushed red pepper flakes for some heat and a little extra Olive Oil as this is really your "sauce".

Next time I want to try adding some Marinara sauce.  I think this would be really good too.  Maybe some chicken or shrimp too!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe! So did two of our friends who also ate it. We added a can of cream of chicken soup like other reviews suggested. My husband said next time he would like more tomatoes in it but that's just a matter of personal preference. It tasted great!

WOW!!! Was this good!  It will definitely become part of our menu rotation.  I gave it only 4 stars because I changed the original recipe.  I followed other's suggestions and added cream of chicken soup and Brats; because I planned on grilling them but it rained, so I just cooked them off on the stove and threw them in the mix.  I also used bread crumbs instead of crackers, but next time will mix cheese and crumbs 50/50. This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

It was ok - I added chicken, tomato paste with a little water, and chopped red pepper (which helped a lot).  I did a combination of bread crumbs and saltines with some extra spices, and I agree that it might have been better with just bread crumbs vs saltines.

We made this tonight and really liked it. We used wheat crackers instead of saltines and an eggplant instead of zucchini (it's October and the zucchini in the store wasn't looking so good). We also added two cubed chicken breasts like other reviewers did. It was very tasty and we plan to make it again- it just lacked a little of the "wow" that five star recipes have.

This was a great recipe. The only changes I made were to add 1/2 cup water when cooking the zucchini and then used 1 can petite diced tomatoes, without draining, instead of fresh tomatoes. It was really good. Next time I might use tomato sauce instead of the water.

Made this dish for tonight's dinner.  I added one pound of ground sirloin for the protein.  Tasted good, but was on the dry side.  It needed some kind of sauce.  Next time I'll add Alfredo sauce and mushrooms.

I am always looking for different recipes that include zucchini, as we always have more than enough coming out of the garden.  This casserole could of used a little more flavor.  The different ways you could change it up and still keep the integrity, is my test on how well it will go over with my family, and my family ate it up.  This is one I will be using, more than once, every year.

Excellent.  I substituted a can of diced tomatoes for fresh, put in almost 2 c. mozzerella, kept pasta at 8 oz.  sliced the zucchini thin in the food processor.  It was deeeelish.

Want a low-sodium low-fat version?  Saltine crackers are extremely dangerous to people who need low-sodium and trans fat free diets.  I suggest Rye Crackers or Wasa in place of the saltines.

Dry,tasteless, my family wouldn't eat it. If you choose to make a zucchini pasta bake don't follow this recipe! I've made one since to a recipe I made up and it was fine- I fried flour like a bechamel sauce, added cream & sundried tomatoes, used breadcrumbs and covered the cheese on top with a sprinkling of paprika and chilli powder. Mmm!

I agree with the other reviewers...it's BLAND.  Not inedible, but definitely not a repeat!

This was very tasty and fairly simple. I actually added some mushrooms, and some spaghetti sauce and crushed tomatoes that I had leftover from making another recipe earlier in the week. My husband always wants meat in his meals, and he even loved this and said it was delicious without any meat. Will definitely make this again!

Versatile recipe. I read previous reviews & for this first time making it I used crushed tomatoes along with the fresh tomato called for in the recipe. I also browned a lb of ground chuck with the onions. I am taking care of an elderly parent...she ate it all-not a bite left :-).

I wanted to make my husband something new last night, and I chose this recipe.  He liked it, and told me that he would rate it 4 out of 5 stars (I am currently dieting, so I couldn't eat this).

I did take the last person's advice (who commented on the recipe) about adding a can of cream of chicken soup to the mix, and also adding a meat product to the mix...I added sauted ground beef though, not sausage.  I think that without adding the can of soup, the recipe would have been dry.

Thanks, and I will keep this in my recipe box.

The topping was very dry.  I would mix
the crackers & cheese with a little melted butter and then place on top of
the Penne before baking.

Good flavor, but very dry. I agree that sauce of some kind should be added. This dish has  potential.

This was easy & good for using up the over load of veg from the garden!  It tasted great but I did add 3 tomatoes to use up the last couple I had.  Also didn't really measure cheese or anything.  On the top instead of crackers I used the end of the packet of barbeque flavoured chips/crisps.  That added some great flavour with the parmesan & I was too lazy to blend it but it was still good though I had crushed the chips.  It would be good with added sausages I reckon.  My husband loves sausages & I think that it would add a bit more flavour & make it a bit heartier as a full meal though it suited me as is.  But sausages chopped into bite sized pieces I think would be good worked into it.  Also was good reheated the next day for lunch!

I love zucchini so anything with it is good to me.  I think the saltines could be skipped, with just the parm. on top.  A good quick dish.
