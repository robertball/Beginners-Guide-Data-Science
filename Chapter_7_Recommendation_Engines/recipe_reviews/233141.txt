What a great recipe!! Fantastic way to pack a meal with nutritious vegetables. Closely followed the recipe but added 4, chopped sweet peppers and used almond milk instead of whole milk. After washing the kale, immersed it in a solution of water, lemon juice and salt, and then vigorously massaged it for about 3 minutes. There was not a trace of bitterness in the cooked kale. Total bake time was about 60, rather than 50 minutes for the center part to firm up. While two of us felt the seasoning was spot on, one person added several drops of Frank’s Red Hot sauce. After tasting a piece, I might add some hot sauce to the recipe next time but this quiche certainly stands out without it. The sad part is that the entire quiche is gone without even a tiny piece leftover for tomorrow’s lunch. MATTSBELLY, thank you for sharing a great veggie dish.

It was absolutely delicious! I did modify it (like most do!) I use whatever leafy green is going to go bad next, one time was collard greens, this time swiss chard. both times delicious. Added mushrooms too. I cooked the veggies in a cast iron skillet, so rather than transferring it over, i poured the egg mix into the skillet and put the whole thing in the oven. I added a scant cup of bisquick as well, make sure its light and fluffy! thanks for the recipe :D

Perfect base recipe! I never leave anything the way it is written which sometimes works but often times it doesn't. In this case it did! I used the full 5 cups of kale, 1/2 cup carrots, 1/2 cup shredded zucchini and about 1/2 cup tomatoes. I also added some fresh thyme a little bit of mustard (1 1/2 tsp ish) and extra pepper. They taste wonderful even though I forgot to add the cheese! I think they would be even better with a little bit of salsa on top. Also, I baked them in medium sized muffin tins because I want to freeze them for quick snacks later so the cooking time was about 30 minutes. This is going in the recipe box!!!

I have to confess that I cooked the veggies in bacon grease instead of oil. I also mixed the cheese and veggies together and put them in the pie pan, then put the egg mixture on top, which I think is less messy and tends to have a better consistency.

I am so excited about this recipe.  It is packed with veggies and so delicious!  I did make 2 modifications.  I substituted zucchini  for the carrots because I didn't have carrots on hand but I've got loads of zucchini.  I also omitted the parsley.  Because the zucchini has a higher moisture content it took longer to bake by about 10-15 minutes.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It is definitely one of my new favorites.

This is a good recipe to use with Kale. I took the advice of another review and massaged the Kale in a solution of water, lemon juice, and salt. I made one quich without cheese and it was good as well.

This is outstanding!!!  I increased the recipe ingredients by half, using 8 eggs and 1 1/4 cups milk.  I subbed spinach for kale, otherwise made it as the recipe was written. (Just increasing ingredients by half) I did prepare the veggies the day before. The following morning, I whipped the eggs and milk, added the cheese and the veggies.  I baked it in a ten inch quiche pan for 60 minutes. Next time I will test it after 50 minutes. After baking I let it set for 10-15 minutes. It sliced so easily and made perfect wedges that stayed together and looked beautiful on the serving plates. I look forward to experimenting with other combinations of vegetables. I am also thinking of trying this recipe in muffin pans to freeze for quick and easy breakfasts. If I do that I will try to remember to write an update.

This is simply fantastic as-is with no substitutions or changes to the recipe (I'm notorious for tweaking things).   The flavors complement each other nicely, it's chock full of veggies (nicely brightened by the addition of parsley) and the cheese flavor actually comes through.   A definite keeper...and such a refreshing change from the glut of rubbery, bland, overpowered-by-crust quiche recipes out there.  :-)

A keeper!  Took me much longer than 20 minutes to make.  It took 60 minutes to bake.  Very healthy!

What a great recipe! Sautéed the veggies in cast iron skillet, poured egg mixture over and baked in the cast iron skillet. The cooking time was much less this way.  Healthy and delicious! Will definitely be making this a lot.

Granted, I just used what we had (turnip greens, peppers, instead of kale, carrots, tomatoes) - so maybe that accounts for the difference, but found the recipe a little bland...I added just about a T of flour and thought that the texture came out great... Just missing some seasoning....

I did not use tomatoes or carrots because I did not have them in my fridge.  I also used Jarlsberg cheese instead of cheddar.  I keep skim milk in the fridge so I used that plus 1/4 cup of Alfredo sauce to add some richness.  
The kids loved it and asked for seconds!

OMG.  What can I say but over the top. Made for my niece's baby shower yesterday as she has gestational diabetes and wanted a crustless option. More people ate this one vs. the Quiche Lorraine. Made it exactly as written but cooked everything in a little bacon grease and added a dash of cayenne pepper. Yummy.

This turned out great and I expect to make it again.  I subbed spinach for kale and added an extra egg, but used the other ingredients as listed.  I increased the temp to 425 and baked for 25-30 minutes in a glass baking dish which allowed me to get dinner on the table in about half the time.  I let it rest for a few minutes and it set up perfectly.

This is a great recipe! You have to like kale though, because 5 cups is a lot! I used what I had on hand. Kale, onions, garlic, mushrooms, bell pepper.  I diced everything fairly fine. I sautéed the kale separately, then the other veggies until they were dry. I had no problems with excess moisture in the quiche. I did use a crust, and poured the veggies on the bottom, then the egg, milk and cheese on the top. I used dry parsley. Mine baked in 40 min.  My husband and I loved it! Tasted very fresh, healthy. He put a little hot sauce on his. The grandkids took one bite and wouldn't eat anymore, and they like kale. I would like to try this with different greens, like spinach or chard.  I thought it was yummy and will definitely make again!

I made this for my parents and we all loved it. Fabulous  basic recipe.  My Mom can not handle garlic and this recipe was still great even without it.  I think next time I will make sure I get all the liquid from the cooked onions, as there was just a touch of water at the bottom.   But it didn't affect taste!  I will definitely make this again.   Thanks to all who reviewed and added their own take on it, and the great cook who shared their recipe.

Summer Garden Crustless Quiche Haiku: "Took longer to bake. Only made two small changes, leftovers better!" Mine was more like 70 min. to not be wet in the middle, so we were hungry and had burnt our toast in anticipation of eating the quiche on top of it, so that was a bummer, but the end result was really quite wonderful! Used half the cheese, and 3 tsp. dried parsley instead of fresh. (Would've preferred fresh if I'd had it!) I never thought to use carrots in a quiche, and I usually go w/ spinach as my green, but the entire combo of veggies here w/ the kale was awesome! The leftovers were better in my opinion as it had a chance to set more and then cut into prettier slices.

Tried this recipe tonight for the first time. Tweaked it in a few places, such as using Silk almond milk in place of whole milk and for veggies I used part of a bag of Cascadian Farm frozen kale and also part of a bag of mixed veggies (corn, carrots, peas). Sauteed the minced garlic in a pan with the partially defrosted veggies (so some of the water could cook off), omitted the onion (used onion powder instead). Used a combination of sharp and regular cheddar cheeses. Threw in a handful of grape tomatoes I had on hand. Cooked in about 50 minutes, as the recipe suggested. Having never eaten kale before, this proved to be a very useful recipe to aid me in upping my veggie intake. Thanks!

Absolutely fantastic! I made the quiche with less kale. I'm glad I came across this recipe because it happens to use all the produce I had picked up at the local farmers market. For sure going to make again, possibly with a crust next time.

I use a pre-packaged blend of kale, spinach and chard.  I also added a little bit of chopped up ham and a couple of teaspoons of pesto.  Sooooo yummy :)

It got eaten so quickly I didn't even have time to take a picture of it!  Not only was it gorgeous, it was delicious!!  I changed a couple of things, but only by accident or necessity.  I had only light cream in the house, so I used that instead of whole milk (no complaints), and I set the oven for 375 degrees, and it was d-o-n-e at 45 minutes; rounded top, gorgeously browned, and perfect in the middle (knife test).   This was, in fact, my first crustless quiche, and it was Fabulous!!

This recipe was as wonderful as everyone who raved about it said! I didn't change the recipe and it was just perfect as is with lots of healthy kale. People mentioned that it took at least 60 minutes to bake, but 50 minutes was perfect with my oven. I do agree that the author understates the prep time. Prepping the vegs, etc took 20 minutes, but then you have to pan cook them for at least another 15 minutes so prep is really more like 35 minutes, but worth the time it takes. Will share and make again! Thank you!

Guests and family alike loved this. I generally followed the recipe except used mixed baby greens - kale, chard & spinach - Dubliner white cheddar, and added a cup of diced ham. I prepared the vegetables and shredded the cheese the day before. Just before baking, I blended the eggs and milk, then stirred in the cheese, cooked vegetables, ham and parsley. I used a 10" pie plate coated with cooking spray. Since everything was chilled, it took 55 minutes to cook. This is definitely a keeper!

I'm trying to do away with most salt so I used amino acids and I added it to the egg mixture.  Also I used manchego cheese instead of cheddar.  Great!

Great recipe with exact portions! I make tj sans tomatoes because I didn't have any and it still came out yummy! What a great way to get your family to eat their kale. Make sure you cool the kale well so that it's not too chewy. I also made sure to cut it up into 1" pieces before sautéing. Next time I'll try this in a crust just to appease my curiosity. Thanks!

One of my favorites.  We usually add Smoked Salmon or chicken and serve it for dinner.  I regularly sub whatever veggies I have on hand.

This was tasty, and surprisingly flavorful despite the lack of seasoning used. The prep time was WAY longer than 20 minutes, and I baked it for an hour. My only change was to add goat cheese for a little extra flavor.

This is DELICIOUS and versatile! I've made this twice with some modifications. Considering the hand-chopping of the veggies, it took a total of about 75 minutes from start to finish. It's worth it. Both times I massaged the kale in water, lemon, and salt as recommended by another reviewer. Keeping the proportions of vegetables to eggs the same, I've used different veggies including tomato, bell pepper, and squash. You can use just about anything--just leave the watery part behind when you put them in to sauté. I baked them in a 325 oven for about 25 minutes - until the knife came out clean. Instead of a pan, I used a muffin tin so I could easily make as much as I wanted a little at a time so they were always served oven fresh! (They also reheated in the microwave well.) I doubled the batch and refrigerated it, leaving the mixture ready for a quick breakfast or snack for my hungry boys. I also served this for dinner once... it's a very flexible recipe and relatively healthy for a quiche :)

This quiche was very tasty, with a couple of modifications.  It was also pretty easy, but really time consuming. It took me sly least two hours to make. Before cooking the onions and garlic, I cooked half-inch pieces of bacon on medium low, and then removed them from the skillet. I then cooked the vegetables in the bacon fat instead of olive oil. I would also recommend added mushrooms when you added the garlic and onions. I’m sure the original recipe would be delicious too.

Made this 2 times. 1st time fresh spinach, no kale and 2nd time no onions (threw in some onion powder) and used 5 cups kale. Both times I used 1 can petite diced tomatoes, drained. We loved it both times. Served it with some ketchup mixed with curry powder. Delicious!

This was delicious and accommodates whatever you have on hand. I used fresh spinach rather than kale, a mix of sweet and green onion, and scapes.  I added diced red and yellow pepper, which I highly recommend. My quiche was perfectly done at 45 minutes.

This is a versatile, forgiving recipe. I've made it as stated, and with variations -- it's always good. I love spinach, and use it instead of kale. For cheese, I've used mozzarella, and both sharp or  mild  cheddar, depending on what I had available. 
I  have used pasteurized egg whites too, avoiding yolks...You can't go wrong. Leftovers are great for any meal. Have fun eating through your own variations!

Great recipe, the quiche looked beautiful and tasted delicious. The only change I made was to use a bag of baby kale, baby chard and baby spinach that I had on hand ( instead of the kale). My husband said it was the best quiche I had ever made. I will definitely make this one again.

This was delicious and turned out beautifully. I used frozen spinach instead of kale, added four sliced bella mushrooms, Herbs de Provence, anise seed to the vegetable mixture and then dusted the top with nutmeg before putting it in the oven. Thank you for this base recipe!

I added some chopped zucchini and a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper.....this was delicious! I used another reviewers suggestion and poured the egg and cheese into the cast iron skillet used for the vegetables for an all in one dish. This dish served as a perfect summer dinner with a salad and fresh corn on the cob, the a slice with a piece of fruit for breakfast!

I have made this several times. Today I did a no meat version. I had onion, potato, green & red pepper for veggies. I topped off the squares with tomato and a jalapeño. I should have added the cheese before the tomato, but forgot. Poured the egg mixture over it all. Today I used salt, pepper, cumin and old bay for seasoning. Needed more salt than I put in.

I didn't have all the ingredients so improvised, but was trying to keep it healthy.  Used a variety of baby greens, spinach, kale, chard, etc.  Used cottage cheese instead of milk (had no milk) and parmesan cheese instead of cheddar.  Also used a whole onion, no carrots, lots of garlic. It was awesome!

This was a good recipe to use up some leftover produce. I scaled it down to 3 servings, using 2 eggs. I had a small amount of kale on hand, but did add about a cup of chopped mushrooms to the onions. I subbed non-dairy creamer for the milk and Gruyere cheese for the cheese, with great results. I also gave it a few shakes of  cayenne pepper which worked well. Before baking, I topped it with a little Gruyere and parmesan cheese.  I used a small, rectangular glass baking dish. I found it to test ready after 35 min. With a quiche this delicious, I definitely don't miss the crust, along with it's extra calories. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this....I would not put the diced tomatoes in it as it made it too runny.  I added pancetta and that added lots of flavor.  I am sure it would be delicious if I hadn't added the pancetta....my husband encouraged me to add it!  He is NOT a vegetarian!

Used spinach instead of kale and substituted almond milk for regular milk due to lactose issues. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make again

I use this recipe as a base, substituing ~4 cups of other vegetables, based upon what's in season, several times per month and adding additional garlic and other herbs to go along with the chosen veggies. It lasts well through the week as leftovers.

I did use less kale (about 2.5 cups torn). I also mixed all the veggies and cheese together and placed in the pan first, adding the whisked egg/milk mix gently over top to ensure everything would be in every bite. It was perfect!

I made two  of these quiches for a family brunch. One, following the exact recipe, and one modified (instead of kale, I used spinach- as I do NOT like the taste of kale).   
This  recipe is a winner! The family loved them both.. Thank you for the recipe. 
Recipe update: The go -around, I used carrots, onion, spinach, tomatoes, green pepper, zucchini,  and mushrooms. It was awesome:-)

Delicious and very customizable.  I had some leftover steamed broccoli that I chopped up and threw in and also added some fresh chopped basil and lemon thyme because I like both with eggs.  I didn’t have as much cheese as the recipe called for so I only used the 2 or 3 ounces I had.  I made this for the two of us and had enough leftover for my breakfast for the next two days.  This is our new Sunday morning brunch dish. Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely wonderful!! We even added a little bit of red bell pepper in it. Excellent for those of us who are watching a calories and oh and added benefit is that it is a great source of protein.

Loved this, another good way to eat Kale. I did use another persons suggestion to rub Kale in a mixture of salt & lemon & water. before adding to the dish. I used my cast iron skillet to do the pres cooking then just added the rest of the ingredients,  stired well & put into preheated oven. 
Thank you for sharing

Really good!  I added 2 extra eggs, used almond milk since I didn’t have milk, and used a can of diced tomatoes, drained, because I didn’t have tomatoes.  I baked it for 1:15, and it probably could have baked a little longer.  I think it could use more spices, but it was very good as is.

Delicious quiche. Everyone loved it. I made it almost exactly by the recipe. My only changes were to use 1% milk (what I had) and I added a small amount of red pepper that needed to be used. I also used 6 eggs since the eggs I had were rather small. I will definitely be making this again. I want to try it with spinach.

I used spinach instead of Kale 'cause I'm not sure I like kale.  Put it in a glass pie plate & cooked at 325 for 1 hr. perfect!  Next time I'll add bacon bits.

The kale and carrot need to be well cooked.  I followed the recipe and thought the kale was quite limp.   I quite liked it, but my husband didn't. Don't think I'd made again, unless I improvised on the vegs.  Perhaps use more eggs to compensate for so many veg.

Awesome! I substituted spinach for kale and added sautéed asparagus and chopped mushrooms. I also drained the chopped tomatoes on paper towels first.  Will definitely make again!!!

Omitted the carrots (don't like carrots) and reduced kale about 2 cups.  I used Swiss cheese.  Very good

Loved this.  I used a variety of vegies, did not have kale.  Still worked.  This recipe has you saute the onions etc. first.  Important.  I did another recipe without this step and it was terrible.

Excellent!  I used fresh vegetables from our garden and didn't change a thing.  I will definitely keep this recipe handy when I have vegetables to use and want a quick meal.  Thank you.

This recipe not only looks and sound good, I find that I am looking forward to trying it out. I can also see that it is a great idea for people who are 'Gluten' intolerant. So, yeah, having a 'crustless' quiche makes great sense, and also offers a less starchy version for those who are trying to cutback on the heavy carbs in their diet.

I will make it again.  I do want to try it with spinach, but worry about the extra fluid.  Great to have a quiche without a crust!

I have made a similar quiche for years but have never used carrots or kale. The carrots add carbs and the kale makes it too dense. I use chopped fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms. I also use sharp cheddar cheese or swiss for a nice change. It always comes out light and fluffy and not so dark. Oh I also add a pinch of nutmeg.

Always a favorite in our house.  I just use whatever veggies I have around, broccoli is one of our favorite add-ins.  Today I'm going to try asparagus because that's what I have.  This is what my husband requested for Father's Day Brunch so you know it's good!

This recipe is so easy and delicious! I have made tons of variations with it by subbing other veggies for the kale, tomatoes, and carrots. The key is to keep the total quantity of your veggies to 6 1/2 cups and saute them with the onion and garlic like the recipe says. I use double the garlic! I've also subbed other kinds of cheese, gouda and cheddar are my favs so far! This quiche will slide right out of the pan for a pretty presentation, just make sure you let it cool for a bit before you start sliding.

I made this with Swiss chard from our garden.  Results: wonderful!  Have made it with and without crust and both are good.  Half spinach and half chard is my favorite...with at least half of the cheese Swiss.

I love this recipe.  I've already made it 3 times, but I chose to use different vegetables.  I did use the kale, but then included zucchini, roasted red pepper, mushrooms, and feta cheese.  My husband and I both agree that it's delicious!

Hate reviewing recipe when I modified it, but I used veggies on hand. Added 1 jalapeno, 2 green onions and sauteed and baked in same 12" cast iron pan. Added 1 extra egg, and was generous with massaged, salted kale. Needed only 35 minutes to bake. Yummy! Will make again.

This is a very easy and versatile recipe. I really like the absence of crust! I used baby spinach, diced a yellow tomato (garden is full of them) and omitted the carrot (didn't have any). The dish puffed up like a soufflé and browned beautifully!  This would make a great breakfast, lunch or dinner meal.

This is delicious!!! I used spinach instead of kale because I had it. Next time I will try kale as we have it in our  garden. I also used an extra egg as we have chickens. This was a good way to use vegetables from our garden and my husband raved about it!!

I used spinach instead of kale. I left off the carrots and used a whole onion. I added tomato chopped, seeded and put in a strainer to lose excess moisture. I used whole milk.  It took 50 min to cook and came out very good. I had cheddar-guyre cheese which worked quite well and had great texture.  I plan to make this again with what is in the garden.

Yummy! This is a great basic recipe. My family gobbled it up! Perfect for our picky child who doesn't like pie crust. Subbed in what I had fresh in the garden and fridge; spinach and swiss chard for the kale, added red pepper, mushrooms, and a dash of hot sauce. Prepped all the veggies in the microwave with a little olive oil. Great cold too!

Delicious. I used a small-medium zucchini, sliced thin, in place of the kale, and omitted the carrots. Added a little chopped basil.

This will definitely be made over and over!! As a gardener, I really appreciate the use of fresh veggies. We are having the leftovers for breakfast! My husband is not a fan of kale, and a big fan of spicy. As we were looking over the recipe, he suggested adding diced ham, 2 diced jalapenos, and chipotle  chile powder. It worked wonderfully! After chopping the kale, I massaged it with olive oil. It really did cut down the bitterness and smelled delightful when frying it.

Great recipe, as I can't eat wheat and it is crustless.  Did not use kale or carrots - instead a variety of chopped veg - broccoli, zucchini, red pepper, red onion.  Otherwise, followed the rest of the  recipe and it was delicious!

The beauty of this recipe is that  many substitutions work in the quiche.  I used diced ham and broccoli with the onions and tomatoes.  It  was tasty and still fairly healthy.  Since ham is salty,  I didn't add any salt.

Easy to whip up and delicious!  I used fresh spinach, onion and fresh tomatoes for my veggies, a little leftover ham and one cup heavy cream with 5 eggs and some Italian seasoning.  Very good!

This had an amazing flavor...please note that everything we used came from our homestead: garden vegetable, and our chickens' eggs.  We love the fresh flavors...and boosted the flavor with sea salt and ground pepper.  This made a beautifully hardy lunch for us and our grandchild.  We used a small squash,  small broccollini, a small kale, a large onion, 3 heirloom tomatos and a garlic bulb...I believe that you can actually any vegetable that your family likes.  The only thing I did differently is after saute'ing all the veggies (except tomatoes and kale) I seasoned with saute with some non-salt spice mix and then added the kale and tomatos.  Once the tomatoes were warmed and the kale wilted...I put everything in a pre-prepared uncooked pie crust.  I used a mix of cheeses: monteray jack, mild cheddar, havari and swiss.

This recipe was so flavorful. I did not have carrots, so I used grated zucchini instead. Delicious.

Delish!!!  This was very tasty.  I followed the recipe to the T.  Next time I want to try with mushrooms.. maybe fresh spinach instead of Kale.  There is so much you can do with this recipe.

4/19/16:  I used dried parsley because I forgot to buy fresh parsley.  I did use fresh plum tomatoes.   I baked in individual-serving ramekins, which reduced the baking time to about 25 minutes...   Otherwise no additions or changes, and it was DELICIOUS!  
4/22/16 update:  I made this again, but I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used mozzarella....  it was okay, but not nearly as good as with cheddar.

Easy, healthy recipe. I added 1% milk instead of whole milk and it turned out fine! I also had a bit extra so I baked some in muffin tins, for easy on-the-go snacks/breakfasts.

Healthy receipe with great texture.  Used extra 2 c kale leaves and 1/2 c more tomato. Taste could use more zing. Used shredded cheddar mix and mozz. Next time try adding parm/romano. Did not miss the crust.

I used 2 small bags of broccoli since this is all I had. Instead of parsley I used fresh cilantro and added a bit of paprika for more flavor. I added a bit more salt than the 1/4 teaspoon required because it was bland at first and also because I used half the amount of cheese required. Used 2 percent milk to make it healthier

5 Stars! I've made this recipe 3 times and it's turned out perfect each time. So yummy! The only thing I did differently was to add some crumbled bacon. Other than that you don't need to change a thing!

OMG!  Had tomatoes a plenty, so used four, cubed and dried, also two carrots, and two Vidalia onions....about 3 cloves of garlic.  Didn't have any kale, but added diced ham.  Sautéed all of this (adding tomatoes, parsley and ham last), then put veggies in 9 X 13 pan (too much for just a pie plate), and mixed in egg/milk mixure.  Baked for an extra 10 minutes, but let me tell you....DIVINE!!!  Served with sour cream and salsa!!!!  You can add anything to this recipe!!!
