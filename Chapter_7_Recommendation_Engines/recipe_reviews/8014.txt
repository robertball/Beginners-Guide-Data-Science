I made these into 12 cupcakes today while three guys installed a new air conditioner. I left three on one plate, and left the other nine on a platter. I told them to each help themselves to "a" cupcake. I went about my business and they with theirs. Next thing I know, I see two of three guys with frosting moustaches and the plate with nine cupcakes gone! They said thank you several times, proclaimed the cupcakes amazing and told me I was "a good woman." Once they left, I tried one myself--yep, they're good. REALLY good. When making the batter I used the coffee hot. I read somewhere that hot coffee or boiling water has some kind of reaction with the cocoa that makes it bloom and bring out the depth of its flavor. I frosted these dark, moist and chocolatey cupcakes with my own vanilla buttercream frosting. There are now two left for Hubs when he gets home!

Perfect! I made no changes. I too hesitated because I don't drink or like coffee, so I was worried that the cake would taste like coffee - it didn't! Instead, it gave it a unique flavor not  achievable with either water or milk.

The texture was wonderful. Here's a hint for novices: this texture is only achieved if your butter/sugar mixture does NOT separate when you add the egg. So scramble the egg briefly and add it to the mixture a little at a time). Instead of icing, I put (Stonyfield) yogurt on it (full fat and plain as I like it) while my husband ate his cake with vanilla ice cream. A keeper! Thank you. BTW this cake is just as delicious plain or with some walnuts in it.

I've made this cake twice in the last week: once for my future in-laws and once for my family. It was SO easy and absolutely delicious. I don't drink coffee so I was a little worried it would taste like coffee, but it didn't. This cake was moist, not too rich and with a nice crumb. I served it with vanilla frozen yogurt and berries. ONE THING: I found that it was done perfectly after 30 minutes...everyone's oven is different so  I always recommend checking early instead of too late!

LOVE IT!  Even my husband liked it and he's not a big chocolate fan.  This literally takes me 10 minutes to throw together once I have all my ingredients ready.  I get 16 cupcakes out of this recipe and bake them for 20 min or doubled, I bake it 50 minutes in a bundt pan or 40 minutes in a 9X13. My only change is using piping hot coffee instead of cold.  This cake isn't very sweet but it's ... just perfect.  If you have a big sweet tooth you might want to ice it with a fairly sweet icing.  Creamy Chocolate Frosting from this site is a great topper!  The cake is delicious plain or frosted and has a wonderfully moist texture that isn't wet or fudgy.  Don't worry if you're not a coffee drinker because it doesn't leave even the slightest hint of coffee flavor but it definitely enhances the chocolate so don't skip it!  It freezes well and was very easy to work with when making my son's robot cake for his birthday.  Absolutely fantastic and even better the second day!  Thank you!  This is what chocolate cake should taste like!

Due to the coffee that's added, this cake is quite moist; however, it is not a sweet cake and though I planned just to sprinkle some powdered sugar on top, I found that this was not enough, so I had to make some chocolate frosting to go on top.  Whipped cream would also make a good topping.

I have made this for my friends probably 6-8 times - for birthdays, for dinner parties, for a girls' night in. Each time it gets rave reviews. I just pour 200 grams (~7 oz) of melted plain chocolate over it, and it gets comments like "the most amazing chocolate cake ever".

I've also experimented - I've added freshly squeezed orange juice, and garnished with orange slices - that was a hit.

This cake was very easy to make, but in the end my batter tasted very very strongly of coffee. So I added 1/2 cup of sugar, doubled the amount of vanilla and added about 3 or 4 dashes of Coffeemate. Yes, Coffeemate (the vanilla caramel flavor). It tasted great in the end and I was very very happy!

I decided to make this recipe because I brewed a big pot of coffee for someone, but had a lot left over. I don't like coffee, so I wasn't about to drink it. You can't taste the coffee in the finished product - it just enhances the chocolate flavor. We have a divine family recipe for chocolate cake, and the secret ingredient is coffee. Just try it!

If you're making cupcakes, don't put too much batter in each cup. The top flattens out over the pan if they rise above the top of the cup once you take them out of the oven. This makes it very hard to remove the cupcakes from the pan with the top intact. A cookie scooper (2 Tbsp, I believe) was the perfect amount of batter for mini cupcakes. The mini cupcakes baked in 10 minutes and this recipe yielded 42 minis.

I used 2/3 cup of strong brewed coffee and 1/3 cup of french vanilla and hazelnut flavored Kahlua (coffee liqueur). It still amounts to one cup of liquid, but with a little extra kick!

I frosted these with the Coffee Butter Frosting from this site. Again, trying to use that leftover coffee...

This cake was indeed simple and delicious! Thank you J. Miller!

This was easy and excellent!!  Very moist.  Made a simple chocolate frosting and used Kahlua as part of the liquid.  Will make this one often.

Really yummy. Easy to make. Moist and dark. Comes out perfect all the time. 10 serving shown here will make a small size cake. I doubled the recipe to make a good size birthday cake. Both kids and adults will enjoy this cake. A word of advice, this cake is sooo addictive especially for grown-ups. I think it's because it's not sweet at all so you feel less guilty when you eat it. I also made it into cupcakes and again, a success! It made about 8 or 9 regular size cupcakes. I think cupcake is a good serving size. It definitely helps me not to over indulge.

I was so excited to make this cake. I have company coming over tomorrow and like to make cupcakes the night before and frost them the day of. 
I followed the instructions to a T and what came out was very disappointing. 
I love coffee, I love chocolate, but what came out of that oven tasted like neither of those two things.  The batter tasted great, no complaints there... but when I pulled the tins out of the oven, the cupcakes were black as night and had a very.... filmy taste to them.  
I read all of the reviews before I made them, used piping hot coffee instead of cold.. did that have an effect on the way they turned out??
Anyway, very disappointed. I've been using this site for months and this is the first recipe I've used that turned out different than expected.

I had a tall order to fill after trying several of the other chocolate cake recipes from this site.  This was the first one that really wowed me.  It's simple, no pudding or chocolate chips, and perfectly textured and moist.  I did use hot coffee, mainly because i forgot to cool it in advance, but most of the other recipes use hot, and it was delicious as ever.  The key to a good cake is making sure your butter and sugar is creamed well before you add the egg and vanilla.  I also lightly beated my egg before adding it to the mix.  The batter will be runny, but it ends up brilliant.  Say hello to my new basic chocolate cake recipe: not too sweet, but perfectly chocolate-y
UPDATE: I just made these into cupcakes (it made 16) and they only needed about 17 minutes to cook.

Simple perfection. I'm guessing some reviewers have some coffee with their sugar. If you don't like cofee to the point you have to counter out it's flavor, than this recipe is not for you. For the rest of us, simply perfect.

It was moist... but didn't taste like chocolate at all. Other people said it was good since it was moist and not that sweet but for me, this wasn't a keeper. Also, even though I floured the pans the way the reciped said to, the cakes didn't come out easily at all.

Absolutely, positively DELICIOUS chocolate cupcakes! My daughter has been asking for chocolate cake the past few days, so I decided to whip these up today. I took Naples advice, and added the coffee while it was still hot/warm, which I do think makes a difference in bringing out the cocoa flavor. This made 12 cupcakes (plus I had a little batter left over, which I made into 4 mini cupcakes using a mini muffin pan - just the perfect size for me to do my taste test). I baked the 12 cupcakes for about 16 minutes.  I topped these with a Nutella Buttercream (adapted from a recipe I found on Pinterest), and a chocolate covered espresso bean! So pretty and yummy. Saving this one to the recipe box. Thanks!

This recipe is easy and hassle free.. I followed the exact recipe and made it into 11 cupcakes, the baking took approximately 17 minutes.. They were moist and light and yummy.. eventhough I kinda expected them to taste richer since they looked so dark (probably because of the coffee).. I was too lazy to make some icing so I just sprinkled some powdered sugar on top of them.. I'm gonna be using this recipe again in the future but maybe I'll add more chocolate to make it taste richer..

I substituted 1 cup cold milk for the coffee (didn't have the patience to brew coffee)!  It turned out really delicious.  It was nice and simple, but moist and decadent.  I will use this recipe again, and I am putting it in my book of "great recipes I find on the internet".  :)

I was VERY dissapointed in this cake, I am giving this 2 stars simply for the ease of preperation, other than that I would have rated this 1 star. First off, I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly as written, I was shocked once it baked that it had barely risen and I was left with 2 super thin round cakes. Finally I had a taste and I had to keep tasting it as it lacked flavor. It was very bland! I thought it may be my taste buds but I had my husband and kids try it and they all agreed it is very plain. Very dissapointed all the way around.

A big hit at a recent party.  We couldn't wait for the cake to cool down so it was a bit crumbly, that would probably not happen if we waited :)  But yes, I made the cake at the event and people were excited to see that coffee was an ingredient.  Though you can't quite taste the coffee, I agree with the other review that it probably adds a certain dimension to the cake.

Delicious Moist Cupcakes! Not too sweet but still flavourful with a good frosting. I used one and a half long shots of espresso with the rest water to make one cup. That may have made them a bit more bitter, that's why the frosting made a big difference too. But I will use espresso next time again!  - I will let the espresso cool a bit though. Stayed fresh in the fridge for days - gave some to my sister three days after baking and she said they tasted fresher than the ones at the cupcake store!

Wow....this is the first cake I've ever baked from scratch and it came out perfectly! I made it for my girlfriend's birthday and she was very impressed. My mother used to make a chocolate cake with coffee, and I always remembered how incredibly chocolaty it was, so I went looking specifically for a chocolate cake with coffee, and I was NOT disappointed with this recipe. Great job! I can't wait for another excuse to make this again. I chickened out on the frosting and bought something at the store, but, maybe next time I'll take the plunge.

Made this cake exactly as directions read...and it turned out fantastic!  All the five star reviews are correct.  If you want a simple, delicious chocolate cake this is the one to try.  I didn't even frost it.  It is glorious in all it's chocolaty goodness without any extra bling!  You gotta try this one!

This cake is absolutely delicious, I made this for my family and everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe but used 1 3/4s of flour and 1 cup of coffee instead of 2 and it still came out perfect and moist. I also made a chocolate/coffee icing for it and it was the perfect finish!

Awesome and very flavorful cake. I used it with coffee butter frosting and also poured some homemade caramel on it then topped it with shaved chocolate. I used very strong coffee - still I wouldnt say it really tasted like coffee so much as a very deep flavorful chocolate. I found that two recipes made four layers for me.If you dont want it to break up when taking it out of the pan then dont put the batter in the pan till right before you pop it in the oven. My first two layers came out cleanly but because the last two had sat in their floured pans while I was cooking the first two I left a big chunk of cake in the bottom of the pans. This is probably because the flour and grease on the pan has time to be absorbed by the cake batter. So watch out for that.

Not bad. I made it in a bundt pan becasue I liked the look of it that way in some of the pictures. Maybe that affected it, becasue it was a little dry...? I topped it with buttercream frosting and it wasn't bad. I would make it again, but put chocolate chips in it and try a different pan.

Last week my friends and I went apple picking, so I had tons of apples on my hands. To make a tasty cake to stick the apples in, I altered the recipe by cutting out the chocolate and replacing the coffee with half milk half rum. Put in about 1-1.5 cups of chopped apple and baked for the same time. 

A little on the sweet side, but turned out great!

Brilliant recipe. Thanks so much. I added another tablespoon or 2 of cocoa because the coffee I added was so strong and I didn't want the chocolate flavor to be overpowered.

There is no reason to go searching for another chocolate cake recipe!  I love this cake.  No one can tell there is coffee, but it's so dark and rich and moist that people ask how I made it.  I only have access to Dutch processed cocoa, which may make a difference.  I did try a couple other recipes after finding this one and each time chided myself because they just weren't as good.  I'm so glad I have this one in my recipe book!

This wonderful recipe has prompted me to write my very first review of any recipe that I have ever tried and I have tried many.  The cake was FANTASTIC!  It was easy to put together and it was absolutely delicious.  It was moist, not too sweet, perfect amount of chocolate, just simply yummy!!!  I will definitely make this again.  Last night I just sprinkled it with powdered sugar; this morning (naughty me!) I ate it plain.  Next time I need a layer cake, I will definitely use this recipe by doubling it.  I also liked this recipe because the when the cake was baked it turned out to be a very nice thick layer, not a skimpy one inch high thing.  It will make an excellent two layer cake for a group or it is perfect as one layer for a quick and easy treat!

If I could give this six stars, I would. This is a phenomenal recipe. If I could just find a yellow and a white cake recipe of this caliber. I am a pastry chef, and hands down this is the best chocolate butter cake I have ever made. Awesome!

I, too, baked these into 12 beautiful cupcakes for 23 minutes and frosted them with "Vanilla - Chocolate Powdered Sugar Frosting", also from this site! The result?? Beautiful, cute, little cupcakes which everyone enjoyed to have more! The recipe is really simple and fuss-free without any sort of "modification" needed, except using hot coffee instead of cold like others; just don't be unduly alarmed by its extremely thin batter but they would texture turn our nice eventually.

Have made this cake again and again! It is now a favourite with anyone who has tried it! I made it with plain water (in place of the coffee) and missed ou the vanilla extract, but it was just as delicious! I am sure to make this many more times than I already have!

Lovely light texture with a delicate crumb, fabulous flavor!  I used freshly brewed coffee and dutch cocoa, and the recipe made 12 cupcakes that rose beautifully.  I am so happy to have found this recipe.  Thanks for posting!  I frosted them with Creamy Chocolate Frosting, also from this site, and it was a delicious combination.

This was not a bad cake, but wasn't great either.  I followed the directions exactly.  I set the timer for 35 mins. and that was too long.  This cake is very dark (would almost say black).  Was moist (at first), but kind of dry the second day.  A lot of crumbs.  Wasn't very chocolately or sweet.  I did not put frosting on my cake, but I think it needs it. I will probably not make this again. There are too many REALLY GOOD chocolate cake recipes out there.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made this recipe twice - the first time as written, and it was delicious. Quite dense, but some ice cream took the edge off that! The second time I made it, I used soy milk instead of coffee, added mint & dark chocolate chips, and used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp mint extract. It's in the oven now and after a quick peek I can tell already it has risen more this second time. In any case, my apartment smells great and I can't wait to try it!

This was really good, but, I added a few things after reading the reviews of it not being sweet enough. I added 1 1/4 cup of light brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup applesauce, two teaspoons of vanilla extract. This cake came out extremely moist and just sweet enough (not over overbearingly sweet and not bitter either)! I also sprinkled powdered sugar instead of frosting (I'm not too much of a frosting person anyways) and it was delicious...all with a nice warm cup of butternut toffee coffee :)!

I agree with other members, it's very moist but not too sweet. Although I increased the level of coco powder it's still not chocolat-ey. That has to be taken care by the frosting and the icing now. I did add more vanilla and doubled the recipe for 2 tiered cake. If you want something fudgey then go with a recipe that calls for melted chocolate rather than coco powder

Halved the recipe and baked in a standard loaf pan. In an attempt to lower the fat count, I used applesauce in place of butter...this actually made the end product sweeter than it would otherwise have been, but with this particular cake, that was not a big issue. Many reviewers had commented about this not being a particularly sweet cake, anyway. I let the cake cool and then used small cookie cutters to cut out little cakes. This is really yummy with no frosting as is, or served up with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I made this recipe into 12 cupcakes. I followed the recipe to a "T". My coffee was a little hot & strong but the cupcakes thoroughly pleased the 4th of July party I took them to. I baked them, for 22 minutes.
I frosted them with vanilla buttercream frosting with a shot of coffee and they were superb! 
I will keep this recipe for many occasions in the future and have fun tweaking it.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted to make a small batch of cupcakes - most recipes make at least 2 or 3 dozen, and I wanted a recipe that used what I had on hand.  I used Folger's instant coffee to make a strong cup of cold coffee so I didn't have to bother with brewing some coffee. Had a tub of the new Cool Whip Vanilla frosting so that made it super easy. We don't like cake or frosting that's overly sweet so these were perfect. I think because of the amount of liquid, there's not enough structure to the batter for them to rise a lot, so you won't get big rounded tops on them, but they make up for it by being nice and moist.

I am planning to make this for our weekend treat- I am rating it a 5 because it's simple and a small cake- so less to eat and easy to enjoy! Thanks for posting this, my mom used to make a small chocolate cake for special occasions but never wrote the recipe down. Now I have one too! I'll give you an update after I make it!

These cupcakes turned out so yummy.  It was full of chocolate and very moist.  I could not believe how easy they were to make.  I use another chocolate recipe off this site that I use all the time but I think I like this better.

Excellent! The coffee didn't quite make 1 full cup (Keurig), so I added Brandy to make up the difference! I left some plain and some frosted. Delicious! Cupcakes baked for 23 minutes.

Excellent cake - baked for 40 minutes.  Cake not super sweet so I used the Cinnamon Coffee Frosting recipe and it was perfect.  I don't like overly sweet desserts so paying attention to the ratio of a not sweet cake to a sweet frosting makes for a nice balance.

I have made this cake twice now. The first time it was with my daughter she is 6 so i needed short simple and sweet and I got all three we had fun cracking, mixing, and pouring. the second time i wanted to try it as cupcakes I read the cupcake guide and bumped up the oven tem to 400 for 40 min's and I tell you what they were the most moist cupcakes I have had in a long time. I took some to work and did not have to worry about taking any back and a couple people wanted to know where I had bought them from so great recipe and thank you for sharing it.

This was the best chocolate cake I have ever made.  I don't drink coffee and didn't even know how to use the coffee maker.  You do not taste the coffee in this cake. I am searching for the perfect icing for it.  I tried butter cream, but I want something that will not overpower this perfect cake!

OMG! Made this recipe, exactly as directed. I poured batter into cupcake tins instead of cake pan; made 12 full (high) cupcakes. Baked them at 350 degrees for about 14 minutes. I AM NOT a coffee drinker and you COULD NOT taste the coffee, at all. I also added the coffee before it was cooled. These were delicious and just about the most moist (cup)cake, I have ever made. I frosted these with the "Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting" recipe from this site. A definite keeper and staple in my recipe box. Thank your for the recipe!

This is the best chocolate cake I've eaten or baked in my life and chocolate cake is a constant for me.
My 3 and 9 year old girls went bananas over it.
My husband had 2 slices and he is a "pie person".
I will add this to our family recipe book. It's a keeper.
Decaff coffee works just great.
Thank you for the recipe!!

No more boxes of cake mix!  Hooray!  I was quite skeptical that this would go over since I have one in our family who thinks cake mixes set par...but this came out wonderfully.  I used hot coffee (a chocolate infused type) as suggested by some -- that made the batter a bit thin, but as it sat while I filled cupcake pans, the batter thickened up (and I don't think it made a difference between the first batch and the last).  Fantastic flavor and very nice texture, although perhaps a bit more dense than a cake mix would yield.  I am very pleased with the results that regular flour gave this (as opposed to cake flour).  Oh, and the ones that weren't gobbled up while cooling were topped with a vanilla whipped cream frosting swirl (though I may try a chocolate whipped cream next time).

Absolutely amazing!  I make this into 12 cupcakes, which were a little too large and went over the edge of the liner, so I will make more like 14-16 next time.  My coffee was still warm when I added it to the batter, but it didn't seem to hurt it at all.  Frosted them with Caramel Frosting IV from this site for a wonderful combination.

Perfect! Made it as a birthday cake for my husband and everyone loved it! He said it's a definite do-over. The only change I made was half coffee and half coffee liqueur because he wanted alcohol in his cake.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes and they turned out great! Really moist and great flavor (like some of the other reviewers I used hot instead of cold coffee)-- and it's hard to mess up, I'm living in a country where no one uses measuring utensils so I eye-balled all of the measurements and still turned out great! I will definitely make these again.

I know you're not supposed to eat cake batter, but hey, I live life on the wild side! :) The batter is better than any other cake batter I've had! I don't taste the coffee flavor very strongly in the batter, just a nice, rich chocolate-ness. It's a really nice, moist, and rich cake, and I doubt I'll make another box chocolate cake mix now that I have this recipe in my box. Really easy to make, too!

i always add coffee to my chocolate cake but have never added so much! This is amazing! With that heaping one cup of coffee (i used hot coffee), this cake turns out freaking moist and it literally melts in your mouth. Served it to a head chef, he was very impressed with the texture and the taste. it's not too sweet but sweet enough to go without frosting (he asked all sort of questions about the recipe ;p). everyone loved it plain. i can't thank you enough for such a great recipe :) Chocolate + Coffee, you'll never get it wrong. Bravo!

I used this recipe to make cupcakes, and it made 12 exactly. Moist and delicious.. Possibly the best cake recipe I've made from here so far. I changed nothing about the recipe except the cooking time (cupcakes only took about 20 min), and the results were fabulous.  I topped with Satiny Chocolate Glaze.. but this cake really doesn't need anything on top. I'll be making this one again very soon!

Yep these are pretty much the best ever! I added 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper I know it sounds strange but that's what the ancient civilizations used to put in Cacao before they had sweeteners it's delicious. It also intensifies the aphrodisiac qualities of chocolate!

Delicious! I made cupcakes instead of a cake. I also used a about 1/4 tsp almond extract and 3/4 tsp vanilla instead of only vanilla. This was a great idea. It reminds me of swiss almond chocolate coffee. Very rich and flavorful.

I used a Irish Cream coffee brew to make it and it tastes fantastic. Add to that a mild chocolate frosting laced with Baileys (in my case heavily laced) and it's a yummy combination. Definitely a hit with everyone at home.

This cake is a real winner! My children were concerned that it would taste like a coffee cake because of the coffee in it, but it didn't to their relief! It has a rich, moist chocolatey flavour. Easy to make too. The kids verdict was "YUMMY!!"

I followed this recipe exactly as is and it is delicious! There is a slight coffee flavor which I love. It made about 13 cupcakes and they were in the oven a little over 20 minutes. Will definitely be making again!

I made these exactly according to the directions with the small change of putting the coffee in hot as others suggested. I don't know if that matters but I trusted the reviewers.  They are not a sweet cupcake, but they are very chocolatey. I used cream cheese frosting from a can and the sweetness of the frosting was a perfect match to the cupcakes.  I made a dozen for my family for valentines day and they were a HUGE hit.  Everyone loved them and asked me to make more.  I love cupcakes, they are my favorite dessert so I am very picky.  I would make these again - they are the perfect chocolate cupcake if you like chocolate cupcakes.  I would like to make them as mini's because honestly a tiny one would be quite satisfying and...it would be enough.

They had a 'strong' coffee flavor as I made them.  But were not inedible.  They just aren't a go to for me.  I topped with icing and a scoop of ice cream.  These need cupcake liners if you are cupcaking it.

I've made these several times now. They are not my favorite but my family loves them. I tried using orange juice as 1/4 cup of the liquid needed and then 1/3 of it. Next time I think I will try half coffee half orange juice with some spices and extract. As written it makes about 16-20 cupcakes. I make them with the chocolate frosting recipe on this site.

Wonderful recipe! I made cupcakes, by doubling the incredients. The recipe said that it would make 12 cupcakes as it stood, but I ended up with 32 which actually should have been only 24. But, besides that, they were extremely moist, and nearly brownie like in texture, but extremely wonderful. The taste itself was very chocolately, and I don’t know if that was due to the addition of the coffee or not, but my husband loved them. I would have given this recipe five stars if it wouldn’t have been for the consistently when baked. One more thing, I also had to bake them for at least 21 minutes instead of 15-18.

I changed the recipe a tad to make it more moist and less coffee flavor for my boy's. I doubled the recipe, used equal parts white sugar/brown sugar, 3 eggs, equal parts buttermilk/cold brew coffee! Top with a ganache icing. Very moist! Everyone loves them!

I brought a modified version of this recipe to a St. Patrick's Day party, and they were a hit! I added whiskey to the coffee--put a generous shot of whiskey in a measuring cup and then fill to the one-cup line. Don't add the whiskey to the 1 C coffee or you'll have too much liquid. I topped the cupcakes with Bailey's buttercream. I also made the recipe as is for the kids with a vanilla buttercream, and it was very good. The cupcakes were moist and not too sweet.

Wonderful!  Much lighter than any cupcake I've ever had.  My first batch was delicious but needed a fork as it was toooo tender.  Tried another today with one more ounce of flour and that worked out better.  I frosted with plain vanilla buttercream and took to a party where everyone raved and asked for recipe!

One of the best-ever chocolate cakes! I made it for my husband’s birthday and topped it with a mascarpone cheese frosting. All the guests loved it... not to mention the chocolate and coffee lover who was bring celebrated! Soft and moist, with the right sweetness degree. And you can throw it together in no time. Most definitely a keeper! Next time I’ll try a different frosting. Thank you for the delicious recipe!

I made these cupcakes for a New Year’s Party and they were a big hit. They were so good I used the recipe for a chocolate cake a few days later. Also delicious!

I really liked this recipe.  I prefer chocolate cakes made with butter instead of oil.   I used my coffee hot, as many recipes call for boiling water in a chocolate  cake recipe.  The result was a firm, light and moist cake.  Will make again

Prepared tyke pan with olive oil and cocoa rather than flour. thank you for a chocolate cake recipe that I could actually make!

Quite bitter, but a really moist cake. Recommend a sugary topping to balance it out.

I thought this one looked good, but was a little concerned with the number of reviews stating that the coffee flavor was a bit too strong. I decided to replace half the coffee with milk and see how that turned out. Produced a very moist tender, dark chocolate cupcake with a hint of coffee flavor. Very good. Next time I would divide the batter into a few more cups than called for. Just dividing into 12 made them too full, they all overflowed and stuck to the pan around the edges.

My daughter loves the chocolate cake from Costco, the chocolate bundt cake.  She said this tastes just like it!  It is so good and chocolatey too much says my husband, just right says my daughter.  
I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa and our morning Don Francisco Vanilla Nut coffee.  Will be making this one again!!

I was looking for a "made from scratch" cupcake recipe.  This one worked out nice. I substituted chocolate milk for coffee (as I can't stand the smell/flavor of coffee.)  I added 1 1/4 c. flour rather than 1 1/8 as I'm at a higher altitude. It worked out good, will be pretty tasty with chocolate frosting. (IF I can get them frosted before the kids finish them off.

I've been looking for a good chocolate cupcake for my son's upcoming wedding. This is the winner! So good, I'm thrilled because it doesn't taste like coffee. Hub was initially disappointed when he didn't taste the coffee but the flavor and texture - super soft and moist, won him over. These are PERFECT!

I turned it into cupcakes and I was severely disappointed.
It tasted salty, it didn't rise properly and it had a weird texture.

Oh this recipe tastes so good, they are lovely and moist. And not overly sweet like most cakes/cupcakes tend to be. I hope to make these again soon. Because of the cake being a tiny bit tart you might want to use a sweet frosting.

I wanted a quick, easy chocolate cake recipe and this is perfect. It's not overly sweet and has that satisfying chocolate flavor fix. My husband requested it again and it's in the oven right now. This is our new favorite.

First, I'm surprised that this cake doesn't have thousands of  amazing reviews!  Second, I highly recommend you try making this one!  I've baked many chocolate cakes and this one is my favourite.  I find it the most similar to a cake mix from a box, in that it is super moist and flavourful.  I don't alter the recipe and it comes out perfectly.  I do not taste a coffee flavour, although I wouldn't mind if I did.  I think it's the perfect light, fluffy, moist, chocolate cake.

I'm not sure what's going on it other people's kitchens, but this recipe is great! Quick, easy, simple & not a ton of ingredients or directions. The ingredients, method, prep & baking are on point! Thanks. Great taste, look, texture & flavor! Mine came out just fine. The only thing is ...it only took 15 mins to bake & I also yielded 17 Cupcakes. 12 in my tin & 5 in ramekins.

OMG!!! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone raved about this cake, I will never make any other cake again!  The coffee (still warm) gave it a nice deep chocolate flavor. I doubled this recipe to make a 13x9 cake. I used the Creamy Choc Frosting from this site which is amazing as well!  Thank you so much for a great choc cake recipe!  I look like a super star to my family!  :]

I would give this recipe 4.5 stars if I could, but I'm giving it 5 because I think it deserves more than 4. This isn't the best chocolate cake I've ever had (see "Sandy's Chocolate Cake" on here for that) but it is the best quick and EASY chocolate cake I've had. If I'm wanting the best ever and have the time, I will still go for Sandy's, but I will definitely use this again when I just don't have the time or energy for all the extra steps, or don't have sour cream or yogurt on hand. Thanks!

So good! I was a bit skeptical at first as to whether or not I would be able to taste the coffee but I definitely could. I ended up putting a small caramel filling in it with a caramel frosting and it was amazing!

I loved this cake! I used very strong cold-brewed coffee (I'm a barista ;D I used undiluted cold brew concentrate from my cafe). It's been awhile since I made this- I might have added a little extra vanilla, and maybe cinnamon? 

At first I was disappointed with the sweetness- I tried a bit while the cake was still warm and didn't find it sweet at all. But once it cooled, the cake was perfecttttt. I almost didn't frost it. Heaven!

Makes 14 cupcakes. Batter was way too wet, so I'll decrease the coffee to 2/3 c in the next batch. I also added 1/4 c mini chocolate chips to the batter. Delicious!

Unbelievable that such a few simple ingredients could produce such a divine cake.  Had excellent flavor and a beautiful soft texture.  Followed another reviewer's advice & added HOT coffee--I do think it intensified the cocoa flavoring.  Thanks for a marvelous recipe!

I am a great cook but not always a great baker. ;)   This recipe was yummy, easy and it turned out awesome!   I was surprised that someone did not find it sweet enough - I guess I don't eat that much sugar.  It was a great balance for me.    I did add toasted coconut to the dry ingredients mostly because I was trying to use it up.   It made it very moist.  I used a mocha icing on it.

The first time I made it, something went wrong - full hour and it was still absolutely liquid. I was so disappointed, but decided to give it another try - all the good reviews can't be just imagination!
So yesterday I tried again and it was as if I had used a completely different recipe! It rose up beautifully, with just a little bump in the middle, it was perfectly cooked in 40 minutes, looks absolutely delicious. I haven't tried it yet, as I'm debating whether to bring it as a present all in one piece(I really do want to try, though). I'd give it a 5 had I tried for taste, I'm sure it's delicious.

VERY GOOD !   very easy...just warmed up some brewed coffee leftover from breakfast.  I don't like super sweet deserts  and this one is VERY CHOCOLATEY ....I did make a buttercream icing... used more cocoa than sugar in the icing because I added chocolate syrup to it. MY ONLY COMPLAINT... it makes a rather shallow cake for my 9 inch round cake pan (used new baking soda so that wasn't the problem). Done at 25 minutes.

I skipped the coffee, only because I had none since I'm not a coffee drinker.  I substituted Sprite and 3 tablespoons of vanilla yogurt.  Delicious and not overly sweet.  I topped with chocolate cream from this recipe (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/chocolate-filled-cream-puffs/detail.aspx).  This would be fabulous with fresh strawberries.  May try a chocolate butter cream next time for the frosting, and substituting guiness stout for the coffee!

This was the best cake I have ever made and I used decaf coffee that was choclate favored. I did not use a topping but it went great with whip cream or ice cream. A winner in my family!

Coffee can be a little overpowering, but top it off with a sweet frosting and YES THIS IS AMAZING!  I made the mistake of using a frosting that had peanut butter in it - which totally ruined the cake itself.  I am looking forward to making it with a sweet frosting and I can't wait to eat it!  Cooking time can be lessened, just keep your eyes on it.  I did use hot coffee out of the pot.  Next time will try cold, as recipes states.

I made cupcakes n they were very moist but I found the cake v salty .... mayb its because i'm using rock salt. My advice is to use just 1/4 tsp of salt not more. And dont pour in all the coffee ... u might hav to leave behind a few tablespoons, so add as needed.

This cake is NOT sweet.  Unfortunately I did not see that note on another review.  This would be much better with milk chocolate chips or something in them.  Perhaps a little less coffee and a little more sugar would have helped.  I will not make this again, just not my thing.

The best chocolate cake I have ever made. And I make an obnoxious amount thereof. Soooo moist and chocolaty.  No more searching for new chocolate cake recipes! Although I do think I will have to try replacing the egg with banana for kicks.

This was the most scrumptious of delicious cakes I have ever tasted.  In fact, I would go so far as to call it scrumptididdliumptious.  And this even though we used day-old coffee, omitted vanilla and salt, and almost forgot to add the butter.  Thank you, J.!

Fantastic.  Made these cupcakes this evening and it took all of my will power to limit myself to one.  I found that in my muffin/cupcake tin, it netted 12 cupcakes rather than 10.  This recipe is a keeper.

I was looking for a quick and simple dessert. What I found was one of the most amazing chocolate cakes I have EVER tasted! Fabulous taste and texture! Thank you so much for this recipe!!! As another reviewer mentioned, mine was perfectly baked in just 30 minutes. Will definitely be making this one again and again!

wonderful, rich and moist.  Made 12 cupcakes out of this batter.  Frosted some with buttercream frosting, but the ones without frosting were even better.

This cake is the first I made and it was awesome and easy! I spread a thin layer of chocolate syrup on top and it turned out great. Tips: Use 1/8 more sugar and half the cocoa powder to 1/4 cup. It will make the cake a bit less black and it will taste just as great!

This is exactly the recipe I was looking for to cure my chocolate cake craving. Moist rich and very chocolatey. I drizzled a chocolate glaze on top, but it's good enough to stand on it's own. Will definitely be making this again, though I might double the recipe!

Sorry but just did not like this cake. Don't know why, but to our family it was missing something.

Very moist with a good tender crumb. I added a thin chocolate glaze very good!

This is a great cake - makes a nice small cake for a small group (I iced it with cream cheese icing!!)
