Sorry, I wasn't too thrilled with this.  It was OK, but I won't be making it again.  It seemed I didn't like the tomato juice with this combination.

This was terrific!  Easy to make, tasty.. leftovers keep well in fridge.  I added more pickles because I like them and next time think I will bump up all the "stuff" in the recipe. The raisins add a nice sweetness, but I will use dried cranberries next time I think
