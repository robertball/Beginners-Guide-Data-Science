Tomatillos are small and green with a papery husk on them.  Depending on where you live, you might find them in the specialty produce section of the grocery store, or at a Mexican market.  Sometimes you can buy them canned, but for this recipe, I would advise the fresh ones.  Good luck!

This guacamole is great, but why not add a couple springs of cilantro?

Great recipe!

I was not sure if everyone would like this and it ended up disappearing faster than anything else during the Super Bowl.  The only change I made was reducing the amount of red onion I put in.  This is very good!

I was very impressed with this even before I served it.  You could just tell as you chopped up the ingredients and mixed them up that you were going to be in for something good. I did tinker with it a little though, but more just to personalize it to our tastes.  I left out the "hot" stuff which Hubs doesn't tolerate well.  I backed off on the onion a little so it wouldn't overwhelm, added minced garlic, a finely chopped jalapeno pepper, a small amount of fresh cilantro, and about 3/4 tsp. of cumin, all flavors I typically enjoy in traditional guacamole. I also chose to leave the avocados a little chunky rather than completely mashing them.  It took a fair amount of chopping for this recipe, but it was worth it.  I served it for a dinner get-together and everyone had at it.  A real winner.

I love this recipe! My husband and kids don't like guacamole, but they scarf this down like you wouldn't believe! I  brought some in to work for a pot luck, and ended up giving copies of the recipe to several people! I even grew tomatillos in my garden after trying this, and I had NEVER tried a tomatillo before!  Wow!! Great recipe!!

This is a delicious and seriously fresh dip.  My hubby couldn't get enough of it!  I made life easy and put all of the ingredients into the blender and used the pulse button.  The consistency was creamy and a bit smooth.  I added a whole jalapeno, some cloves of garlic, and some crushed red pepper on top of the hot sauce!  We like it spicy!  It came out delicious!

I thought this would be good, but when you eat it tastes like a stink bug smells. Its the tomatillos, they make the dip taste just like a stink bug, not a good taste. Skip the tomatillos!

Everyone loved this recipe but I didn't care much for this.  Maybe some extra lime and spices would have been better, it just tasted kind of bland to me.

Excellent guac!  I only used a half of shallot because I'm not a fan of raw onion and added a little cumin.  Very tasty!

Wow! Can't believe what a great addition tomatillos are to guacamole! What a great crisp taste it gives. I added cilantro (personal preference). Will make again!

This was really tasty and was eaten up quickly. I think we added more lime juice and red pepper flakes than it called for and much more salt and pepper...but my husband and I like things really seasoned.  Loved it!

Great! I've never used raw tomatillos before but I really liked this.  I didn't have red onion so I used green and added some cilantro because we love it.  It was only a bit spicy I might add a jalapeno next time if I want to kick it up.  Thanks!

Being from the chili capital of the world, NM, I use fresh chopped jalapeno peppers in lieu of hot sauce & red pepper flakes.  There are too many tomatoes used in this recipe.  I only use one tomato, add garlic salt to taste, a pinch of salt, a fresh squeezed lemon and fresh cilantro. I chop all ingredients in a food chopper, as the consistency is supposed to be smooth in lieu of chunky.

Turned out yummy after a couple additions like garlic powder and onion powder.  It was great fresh but became a little watery the next day...

This was delicious. The addition of the tomatillo really added a new dimension, I loved the texture and the tang! I used 4 avocado and only 2 tomatoes and added a a few tbsp of chopped cilantro. Thanks for a new take on guac!!

This is almost the way I have been making guac for years.  The only thing I add to it is a little ground cumin and cilantro.  It adds some kick and an authentic mexican flavor.  Make sure to add some lime or lemon juice to keep the avos from turning brown.

I made this for the first time for a BBQ and had pretty good reviews!  I personally like more avocado in my guac, but no one else seemed to mind.

This is a good recipe.  I had a hard time finding the tomatillo's at my local supermarket, so I went to the Latino supermarket and of course they had them.  I used more crushed red pepper than what this recipe called for and more tabasco sause, I like it spicy, but it really wasn't too spicy.  My mom could still eat it.  This recipe probally would be a little better with some cilantro in it.  My favorite guacamole from this website is LuvAnn's Guacamole, you should check that one out.

Yum!  This is very tangy and good guacamole.  Definately something out of the ordinary, the tomatillos really add a nice flavor in there.  Make sure to get nice deep green tomatillos when making the guacamole.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of cumin.  Thanks for sharing the great recipe, ill be making this one again!

Yumyumyum!! Delicious with fresh, chopped cilantro! I had to use beef tomatoes, so the colors weren't as vibrant, but it was still a delicious guac. My family gobbled it up!

Meh.  I would actually like to taste the avocado.  Maybe one less tomatillo would suit my taste better.  I also only used two tomatos, because 3 just seemed too much.  Other than that, I liked it with the red pepper flakes.

Yum, yum, yum.  Great change from plain salsa.  It's got a great tang with the tomatillos.  We'll be making this one at all of our get togethers.

I love guacamole and tomatillos and this recipe brings them together fantastically! All I  can say is watch out for the onions. They can be a bit strong.

This was exactly what I was looking for!  I did add 1 clove garlic crushed because I add garlic to just about everything!  We keep lots of antacid & breath mints around as a result! LOL  Great guacamole with the tomatilla twist!

Cilantro really adds to this recipe.  Tomatillas are great in any Mexican dip or salsa.  I use them whenever I can find them.  They keep well in the the refirg in a plastic bag with husks removed.  they are really not tomatoes but are related to the goose berry family.

Everyone loved this and it was super easy to make if you don't mind a little chopping. I added a few sprigs of fresh chopped cilantro, and it was perfect. The tomatillo's make for an interesting yet subtle variation on your classic Guac!

Wow! Never made guacamole before, but my husband loves it... this was a hit. I added two serrano peppers in place of pepper flakes and hot sauce, which made it pretty spicy. I also added a good bit of cilantro, and I just blended it all up in the food processor. Good creamy consistency, great flavor! Will make again!

yummy. this was delicious. great call on both the cilantro and limiting the red onion. i only put half the onion in there and still woke up w/heinous breath. yikes! plus, i couldn't find roma tomatoes, so i just used plum. one thing i laid off of was the red pepper b/c my husband doesn't like spicy as much as i do, but i did put way more than 3 drops of tobassco in there. i also thought this would be a great thing for the food processor, but since no one else tried it, i did it the old fashioned way. chunky is nice, but i think i may try beating it to a pulp next time. tho my husband says he liked it chunky.

I had no idea if I'd like this, but I really did!  Great flavor and the tomatillo's were perfect in this!!  Be sure to chop them really small dice so you don't get huge chunks.  I also added a little extra red pepper flakes. Yummy guac!

Using fresh jalapenos for the spice and roasting the tomatillos and peppers will give this a different and possibly better taste. (I prefer to roast tomatillos whenever I use them)

This recipe is was a huge hit.  I made it once and now it is what I bring to every party that I am invited to because everyone always asks for it.  I normally throw a little bit more of the hot pepper sauce in or add a hoberano pepper to add a little more kick.

Oho! This is some decent guac! Husband was hankering for a chip and dip snack, so I decided to throw this together. I made this with the juice of one whole little lime, and also some cilantro that was hanging about in the fridge looking miserable. Very good. Thanks!

This is a great recipe! I always add about a teaspoon of olive oil, cilantro, and either a jalapeno or Serrano pepper or both to give it more of a kick. We like things spicy in my house and do not omit the hot sauce but this still isn't overly hot with the peppers.

Really good guacamole!  Instead of red pepper flakes and hot sauce I used a seeded Jalapeno(a few seeds left in to add some heat). I added cilantro as I like the flavour, put it all in a blender.  I will make this one over and over!  Yummy:)

My husband loves guacamole so I decided to try this recipe. Although he will eat almost anything, he actually asked me to throw this away...Specifically he said the tomatillos made the guac sour.  Sorry!

A big hit!  Will definitely make again.  I didn't wait long enough for my avocados to ripen so I just peeled them and chopped then very fine with the food processor and it came out great.  Goes great with the fresh Corn Tortilla Chips.

This almost didn't make it to the party it was intended for. We loved this! I had a couple of Jamaican hot peppers left from making the Haitian Red Beans and Rice from this site, so I added those instead of the red pepper flakes; they gave it a nice heat. Plus, I added the last 2 tbsp of some freshly made tomatillo salsa for some extra zing (and more heat). This was a hit and will definitely be added to my arsenal.

Very refreshing! I added more than 3 tomatillos because they are so tiny and I wanted that extra ooomph. I added about 7-8 tomatillos and still loved it! Didn't need to add salt and ate it with low-sodium Tortilla Chips for a healthy and yummy snack :D

This was good.  I thought mine was a little watery, even though I did not add the seeds from the roma tomato.  Maybe I added too much lime?  Anyway, I would add garlic and salt next time.

This was amazing and has become our staple guacamole for all events. I cut the tomatillos in half though because they are a powerful flavor. Also I add a bit more hot pepper sauce or even jalapeno juice but then again I like spice! All in all, tomatillos are a must for flavor in guacamole.

I like my guac kinda chunky and this recipe lends itself to that.  The onion and tomatillo really give it some kick and the spic level is perfect.  Garnish with cilantro, if desired.  This guac is perfect for chip dipping or accompanying tacos.

I'll admit that I don't make this particular recipes, my boyfriend does, but it blows my mind every single time he does. It's a frequent request around here, and whenever it's made for parties and get togethers, it is always the first that gets eaten up, no matter how large a batch he makes. If you love guac, you're going to love this recipe.
