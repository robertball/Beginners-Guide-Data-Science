As soon as I saw the French Canadian reference, I knew I had to try this. This is a different twist on some of the concoctions I was raised on. It's very easy to make and made with common pantry items. I did cook the rice for a shorter time, because I had a feeling it would get mushy. I'd even consider cooking it less time, so that it's undercooked slightly.  Aside from the cooking time, I made the soup exactly as written. I ended up using about 3/4 tsp of garlic powder, and didn't add additional water at the end. The soup is nice and thick, and very filling. It makes about 6 good size servings. I did need to add salt and pepper since I felt it needed more flavor. Thank you for sharing your "penicillin" recipe! :)
