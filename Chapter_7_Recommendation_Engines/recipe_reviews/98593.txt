We made this meal last night, and it was surprisingly tasty, and oh so easy!  I halved the recipe and used turkey sausage instead of pork, and used crushed pineapple in its own juice instead of heavy syrup (along with the cranberry sauce - with whole cranberries)... and the result was great!  I would definitely make this again!

WOW! This is my kind of recipe very quick and very easy.  I plan on trying the sauce on baked chicken, meatballs, and pork chops.  It should work.  Warning: This one is sweet!

I loved this!!!  It was so easy, although have to say that it looked unattractive until it all cooked together.  I took it to a large party and everyone was asking for the recipe.  Wonderful!

This is THE kielbasa recipe!!!! It is exactly what i have been searching for for months now! It is the perfect sweetness for kielbasa. I never would have thought to make kielbasa with cranberry sauce, since the first time i had i think it was made with brown sugar and pineapple. It was delicios!

Very good although I did add about a 1/2 cup of diced Jalape√±os for more of a sweet-n-spicy flavor. Perfect!

I havent yet tried this recipe but it is also awesome with bbq sauce instead of the cranberry, any flavor works and add a touch of brown sugar on top. Cook it for as long as you can, crockpot is the way to go with this one...enjoy!

I made this yesterday for dinner and served it on hamburger buns and my husband just raved (me to) about how wonderful this is and so easy to prepare.  I added 2 T. of brown sugar.  I saw this in one review and after tasting with and without the brown sugar, I prefer the brown sugar in this recipe. Carolyn

This was good but not great.  I liked the taste of the sauce, I added a bit of cornstarch to the sauce before cooking but it still wasn't as thick as I would have liked it to be.  I thought the kielbasa was a little dry too.  Could have been the brand but I think next time I'd cover it while cooking to keep some of the  moisture in.

I followed the recipe except for I used crushed pineapple in heavy syrup.  The sauce didnt thicken after 1 1/2 hours in the oven so I took it out and simmered it on the stove for 15 minutes.  The flavor tasted like it was an after affect. I marked this a three because I had to dirty an extra pot to finish it and the taste was so icky I ended up throwing away the leftovers.

Excellent !  I varied it by browning the sliced Kielbasa first then put all the ingredients into my crock pot on low. Let it cook all day. Served with a side of fried rice.

Great weeknight recipe. So easy and good. I used boneless chicken (cubed)instead of kielbasa. Cooked for 1 1/2 hours and the sauce thickened beautifully. Poured the sauce over white rice.Yum. This is a keeper. Definately sweet but we like sweet.

Not as flavorful as I was expecting, but good. The sauce never thickened for me as well.

This was delish!  We used fresh cut pineapple and saved the juice to use. Also I cooked the kielbasa in a skillet then added in the cranberry jelly/pineapple mix and let it cook down. Put it over brown rice and it was sooo good! I could see it work in the oven but I like my kielbasa browned a little. Glad I found this!

Pretty darn good.  I added pepper flakes to offset the sweet.  My husband really liked it ... said it reminded him of sweet and sour at the Chinese restaurant.

Made this tonight, used turkey kielbasa and added diced zucchini and slivered carrots for a full healthier meal-very tasty over rice.  The sauce never thickened but okay as had plenty to pour over the rice!!

I didn't have pineapple chunks in the house so I poured orange juice in a large skillet and thickened it with cornstarch.  Then I added whole cranberry sauce and simmered it.  I also put in brown sugar to taste which in my case was about 1/8 cup.  I am pleased with how it tastes and looks.  I'll see what others think when I serve it tonight.

I love this 3 ingredient recipe. I Did add cornstarch to thicken it a bit. I would have loved the color to come out more of a red tent. The picture I submitted for this recipe was the best picture I ever took, hope you like it!

This was very sweet. But my kids enjoyed it. My husband and I couldn't eat alot of it. I cooked this in a crock pot all day. I also doubled the recipe for the sauce which I wouldn't do again. Even though I had double the kielbasa. The sauce never really got thick so I took sauce out and I cooked on stove till it got thicker. Kids loved it on rice. We all enjoyed it but it was very sweet. If you like sweet you'll love this.

This was just ok.  I used pineapple chunks in unsweetened juice (I don't buy anything with heavy syrup), and just one pound of sausage.  It cooked about 1 1/2 hours before the sauce started to thicken.  I was a bit put off by the grease that we could see on the top.  The sauce didn't seem to add anything to the flavor of the meat.  Probably will not make this again.

This was just ok.  The sauce never thickened, but that might be because I could only find pineapple in it's own juice so it ended up rather watery.  I didn't find the sauce enhanced the taste of the kielbasa at all, but I do think it would make a better sauce for meatballs.  My kids hated it, I thought it was ok, and my husband liked it, so I averaged it out and gave it 3 stars.  Don't think I'll be trying this one again.  I'll stick with the candied kielbasa recipe from this site.

Added an extra pound of kielbasa and cooked it at 375. It came out great! Put on top of brown rice, chopped broccoli and riced cauliflower. Boom! Now that was an easy tasty dinner.

I didn't have either the pineapple or the cranberry sauce so I used a can of mixed fruit in light syrup and a bottle of grape jelly. Came out great!

I cooked the sausage a little in frying pan to get some grease  out of it  and in another pan cut up onion and green pepper and cooked until soft. Severed over white rice and everyone loved it.

Not bad, not fantastic. Used pineapple chunks in natural juice (poured out half of the juice before adding), added chopped green pepper and chopped onion. Sauced thickened up fine after sitting on the counter for 15mins.

Very simple fast recipe that's wonderful. I did add some extras, though even alone it would be great, just sweet. I added green chiles and onions.

This is really good.  However, since I made some adjustments I gave it 4 stars.  I added brown sugar (2 Tbs).  Also, my sauce did not thicken after being in the oven for so long.  I separated the sauce from the kielbasa and added a cornstarch thickening and placed it on the burner. I would suggest doing it on the stove top from the beginning. (I personally added hot sauce in mine after I served the kids)

I love this dish and often times I will mix it with yams that I cut up with a little bit of butter in the baking dish and bake it covered for 40 minutes and the last 20 uncovered or until it gets caramelized on the top....it is that sweet and savory thing that you crave on a cold winter night!

Tasty, but nothing to write home about. If I have Kielbasa in the freezer then I'll whip out this recipe, but not something I'd cook regularly.

Super Easy! I added some jalapeno relish I had on hand for a little kick. Yum! Great for a quick meal.

Very Tasty, it needs something extra, like some kind of side to compliment it.  But other than that, it was perfect, my husband loved it!
