YUMMY!  I made this at a recent family gathering and it was a big hit!  Instead of topping with 1/2 cup fresh cubed bread I topped with 1/2 cup Old London Seasoned bread crumbs.  The extra seasoning gave it a nice taste!  I will definately make this again!

I changed this recipe a smidge just to make it a little healthier. I used instant brown rice instead of white, whole grain bread for the cubes, olive oil in place of some of the butter, and Campbells Healthy Recipe condensed soup (read labels carefully, the Low-Fat is really high in sodium). I tripled the amount of broccoli and used 10 slices of Kraft 2% american cheese slices instead of Cheez Whiz. Also, 1/2 cup of bread cubes (I used whole grain) is not nearly enough. I will use WAY more next time. We loved the end result!

I doubled this recipe for a crowd.  Used regular cooked long grain rice.  Used velveeta instead of 2nd jar of Cheez Whiz.  Used crushed Ritz crackers coated in melted butter on top instead of bread.  Pretty good.  Reminds me of the casserole our TX aunt used to make all the time.

Wonderful side dish! I did as suggested by a few other reviewers and used cheddar cheese soup instead of the cheez whiz, as im not a huge fan of it, and used two boxes of frozen broccoli. I added some garlic and fresh shredded cheese to the top too! REALLY good!

This is a favorite however I use Campells cheese soup instead of cheez whiz. It makes much less rich. AND leaves some healthiness to the brocolli

I tried this recipe for thanksgiving.  The only variation I made was to use a whole can on the cheedar cheese soup rather than Cheese whiz.  It is a healthier alternative and it is not SOOO rich.  It was awesome!  It was quick and easy to make and everyone at my dinner party asked me for the recipe!  Thank you!

I made this for Christmas Dinner.  It was delicious, even though I forgot to saute the onions first (was in a hurry and not thinking).  Basically threw everything together.  Very good and very easy!

Yummy. I couldn't find Cheez Wiz, so I just added a cup of cheddar. Instead of bread, I added some buttery chicken and used my favorite spices.

This is THE best broccoli-cheese-rice. I've tried lots. I don't like the bread cubes, though. I think they ruin it. So leave 'em out is what I say!!!

I have made a variation of this recipe for years. Instead of bread crumbs I grate cheddar cheese over the top, I also add chicken sometimes if I am serving with chicken. It's always a hit and great for potlucks.

Another great dish I found.  I have had this before but cream of chicken was used.  I prefer this recipe and do not use bread crumbs.  Very simple and great to use as leftovers in taco's.

We liked this dish a lot, but we found it VERY rich.  I made a few minor modifications to mine; instead of using minute rice, I used regular cooked rice and I only used about 1/2 cup of cheez whiz and two american cheese slices.  I think we will make it again, but will cut down on the soup and cheese.

This is very simple to make and VERY delicious.  I highly recommend it as a nice side dish.  To turn it into a casserole as a main course, just add some chicken and Viola!  A perfect dinner casserole!

A friend brought this dish over to my house the day I came home from the hospital after having my first daughter.  It was so wonderful to have a warm, healthy dish (she added chicken and used brown rice) because It didn't even dawn on me to make dinner.  It has always been a comfort food since.  I make it all the time for my husband and kids and we all love it. It's easy and tastes fantastic.
