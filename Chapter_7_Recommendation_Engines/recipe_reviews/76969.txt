I have never grated butter before, but it was a good idea for this recipe.  These turned out so good my husband doesn't usually like sweets but he raved over this. I didn't use frozen berries, just fresh and by the time they sat in sugar they had made a really nice juice on their own.  I served this with Easy Whipped Cream from this site and it was one of the best desserts I've made.  Update:  I made this a second time for the fouth of July and doubled the recipe.  Make sure to freeze the butter before grating.  I tried it both ways and it is much easier to grate the butter when it is frozen. It took a lot less time and it was a lot less messy!

Oh. My. God. This is the best shortcake I have EVER tasted!!! I didn't follow the berry instructions (I just used fresh strawberries with sugar & topped w/ whipped cream), just the biscuit instructions. A couple minor changes: I didn't have 1/2 and 1/2 so I used 2% milk - it worked perfectly. I didn't freeze the butter, but I did used very cold butter. Loved the grating technique. I also added to the recipe a bit of vanilla extract and about a scant 1/2 tsp of ground cardamom. I had never tried the cardamom before but had seen it in other shortcake recipes. Wow, was it ever a great addition. Anyway, this was soooo yummy. I will never look for a shortcake recipe again. One other thing - use cooking spray on the baking sheet. Thanks for a great recipe!

I only used the shortcake part of this recipe and they were so good!  I just dropped the dough in little flattened balls to save time.  The egg white and sugar were a really nice touch too.  Sprinkling two tablespoons of sugar over six cakes felt like a lot of sugar, but it wasn't at all once they were baked.  I served it with homemade whipped cream and fresh strawberries.  Yum!

This is the best shortcake ever!  I followed the shortcake recipe exactly, but improvised on the berries. I omitted the frozen berries and used fresh raspberries, marion berries and strawberries- a pint each with 2T sugar stirred in.  The shortcake is so tender and wonderful.  I was so proud to serve this to my husband. It would be perfect for guests.  Totally a keeper!

This recipe is exactly what I've been looking for to make great strawberry shortcake!  I only used a fork to cut in the butter and the butter was not frozen -- just used it straight from the refrigerator.  I also just molded 6 rounded "patties" and baked on the baking sheet and they were perfect!  Thank you for such a great and easy recipe.

Wow! These are so good! I loved the tip of freezing and grating the butter. I thought about skipping that, but am so glad I didn't. It works amazingly well and I've since used that trick with other recipes. Sugar sprinkled on top makes them good enough to eat without the berries (which my husband doesn't like). This recipe got raves at my house and from my company. Thanks!!!!

I followed this recipe exactly and it is AMAZING!  I did sift together the dry ingredients, but that's just my preference.  Also, instead of placing the dough into a loaf pan and cutting into squares, I just made 6 large hand shaped biscuits.  Cook time was the same.  This recipe was soooo easy and fast.  Definitely recommend the egg wash with sugar sprinkled on top...yummy!

Yummy!  This is the best strawberry shortcake recipe ever.  I have tried many shortcake recipes, and this one is the best by far.  I followed the shortcake recipe exactly, but used only fresh strawberries mixed with some sugar since I didn't have the other berries on hand.  Absolutely delicious!

This was AMAZING!!  I substituted fat free half and half for the regular full fat stuff and it was still great.  I also used cool whip and fresh strawberries.  Great recipe!

I am sure this recipe would have been amazing as written but I just couldn't put that much butter in, so I cut the amount in half. I also used my skim milk in place of the half and half. They turned out delicious, and underneath your strawberries and whipped topping I doubt you'd be able to tell the difference!

I've made this twice now, both times to great reviews but serving them warm was the best!!  I use UNbleached flour  and can't tell any difference in appearance, they are golden brown and delicious.   I didn't roll out just hand-patted six shortcakes - cleanup was breeze - one bowl, one measuring cup/spoons and no food processor to take apart and clean.  The egg white wash/sugar topping is worth the extra effort.  Restaurant quality.  Added 6/11/19:  Eight summers later this is still the only shortcake recipe I use - it's just so easy and actually faster than going to the store, haha.

The biscuits in this recipe were phenomenal! Buttery, flaky, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, mmmm. I added a little cardamom to the dough because I like it with fruit desserts. I made my normal strawberry mixture: Strawberries, Gran Marnier, sugar, lemon juice and a pinch of salt. I will definitely be making this biscuit recipe again!

Best shortcake I've ever had, hands down. And I've been searching! I didn't bother with the fruit or cream part of this recipe because I already make my own the way I like it. Also, like other reviewers, I just used whole milk with a splash of half and half to cut the fat a little bit and they were still great. I also patted them into round biscuits (not too much handling, still) and they were the perfect size/shape for splitting and serving. I think grating the butter makes this recipe what it is...definitely needs to be a frozen or at least SUPER cold stick, though! At the end, I cut the last stub of butter into small chunks with a sharp knife...I was afraid of grating my fingers :~) Try this one; you won't be sorry you did.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS with the strawberry supreme topping recipe from this site!!  These were quick and easy with a few simple ingredients.  I did not use frozen butter, just refrigerated.  I also used half heavy cream and half of the half-n-half for the milk portion.  I had a little trouble with the dough not sticking together but handling a little more and 1 additional teaspoon of heavy cream and it worked.  This shortcake is not too dense or too sweet.  You could easy get 8 biscuits out of this recipe.  Six makes them large sized biscuits so we cut them in half.  Will make again every strawberry season.

Very good. If you like a true shortcake with a somewhat traditional, dry, biscuit-like cake, you'll go for this in a big way. The sugar crusting on the top was perfect. I pureed half the berries to make sure there was enough moisture to soak into these. If I had just sliced up the berries, it would have been a little dry for our taste. Like shauna85 said, similar to a scone - a very dry scone.

Simply scrumptious shortcakes!  So rich and delicious... I only make this once a year when the strawberries are fresh and then dream about it for the rest of the year. I followed the recipe for the bisquits but added a tsp of vanilla and a pinch of cardamom.  Used regular sugar in the mix and sprinkled turbinado sugar on the top before baking. Served with fresh strawberries, "Supreme Strawberry Topping", and  vanilla ice cream. Thanks for the recipe, Pam!

These were good but tasted more like scones than cakes. They were very quick and easy to make. Grating the butter is so much easier than the usual rubbing it into the flour. Next time I make scones (or even pastry) I will try doing this again.

This was good shortcake, but I didn't like the "quick" method of preparing it.  I think it is so much easier to combine flour and butter by using a pastry blender.  My arm felt like it was going to fall off by the time I finished grating the stick of butter into the flour.  It is NOT EASY to hold the grater over the bowl while trying to press hard enough for the frozen butter to shave off.  Not to mention that the butter got very soft quickly after grating and I lost a good portion of the grated butter because it was stuck inside of my grater.  So I do not believe my recipe even had 1/2 cup of the required butter.  I will be keeping this recipe, but I have no problem waiting for my butter to soften and then cutting it into the flour with a pastry cutter or fork like any other pastry recipe.

These were so easy, and so delicious! My guests gobbled them right up. I tried a second batch the next day with a low fat milk, and they were terrible! Make sure you stick to the ingredient list, no matter how bad they are for you. :)

I love making shortcakes and my husband said these were the best i'd ever made!  I grated the frozen butter and then place the dough in the fridge for 1-2 hours until i was ready to bake them.  They were wonderful.  I served with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.

These biscuits are absolutely delicious! The recipe is great as is, but I did make two minor changes based on my own preferences. I used milk instead of half and half since I never have it on hand, and I cooked it in an 8x8 pan as one large biscuit instead of separating it. Other than that I followed the biscuit recipe exactly and they are absolute perfection! We ate ours with whipped cream and fresh strawberries.

These are wonderful shortcakes! Press the dough out to the 8 x 4 rectangle on wax paper (easier clean-up). Instead of spraying the pan with propellent chemicals or using grease, these did great just putting the squares onto parchment paper (and easier clean-up). Definitely do the "optional" egg white thing, and when the dough needed more moisture to stick together I just threw in the egg yolk instead of more 1/2&1/2 - just fine and no waste. Husband said that shortcakes are usually bland and "meh", but these were wonderful little butter cakes with biscuit appearance and consistency.

I don't care what other people said negatively about this recipe but I made it like it said and added the extra half and half (I used whole milk) and it is amazing.  The key is not to handle the dough too much, just enough to squish the dough together until it sticks to itself.  Gently push it into shape and cut it and separate the 6 pieces.  Do this as quickly as possible so the butter doesn't melt.  Brush the egg whites on and the sugar and you have perfection in a short cake.  Moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside.

I'm sorry to say this, but my friends and I were not a fan of this recipe.  It was very dry and bland.  I followed the recipe exactly and the results just were not good.  Sorry.  (This review is for the shortcakes only.)

Very delicious shortcake!! I did use milk instead of half-and-half and did not freeze the butter and grate it, but just used softened butter. Unlike many shortcakes (which dry out overnight) this one was just as delicious the next day.  I will definitely be making this again; it was wonderful. Would recommend.

Perfect shortcakes, like a biscuit. My five year old said it was his favorite cake I ever made. Will definitely become a summer staple. Thanks for the great recipe.

Super tasty and flaky.  I make it with 2% milk as I like using ingredients I have on hand and it tastes just as good.   Love the grating the butter trick. I have learned that the less you handle this dough the better it is.  I also full on dip the tops in turbinado sugar prior to baking.  Soooooo good.

These are good...very much like a tender scone.  I left about a teaspoon of butter out of the dough, because it became hard to grate, and I got lazy!  But I melted and used to brush the top of the cakes before sprinkling with a dusting of sugar.  I used about 1/4 cup sugar in the dough and a splash of vanilla and just a small amount on top of dough.  I'm not really crazy about an egg wash on my shortcakes, so I didn't use the egg white--the sugar adhered fine using the melted butter.  I also used about a cup of cake flour for part of the AP flour for a really tender shortcake.  We ate them warm from the oven with fresh strawberries and fresh whipped cream and enjoyed very much.

Snaps for Pam! This is really a 6 star recipe. Everyone in my family loved it. I followed the recipe except I rolled it into a ball then flattened it. The berry mix was strawberries, blackberries and raspberries. Very easy to make and even better to eat.

Perfect Shortcake recipe! Tender, perfectly sweet and very easy with excellent results every time. Don't forget the egg white brush/sugar before baking! We will continue to use this recipe over and over with all type of fruit. Thanks for sharing!!

Biscuits are too dry, too plain. If it could all be a little more delicate and flavorful, that would fix it.

I made this for my sister and my friend. We all enjoyed the cakes very much, however, the dough could be a bit sweeter. Perhaps adding vanilla and more sugar could solve this.

These are awesome! The shortcakes are not  sweet yet they are tastey, tender and flakey, almost like a scone. The dough is very easy to work with and they bake up with an old fashioned charmed look . I substituted 1/4 c. of whole wheat flour for regular flour  and added poppyseeds. Mixing frozen and fresh strawberries helps make enough berry syrup to go round for all the shortcakes. I sliced into 8 shortcakes because slicing into 6 makes for a pretty big serving.   This is now my "go-to" shortcake biscuit recipe. I'm looking forward to using other fruits for variety. THANK YOU Pam for yet another great recipe!

Mmm! Light and flaky! Don't skip the egg wash and sprinkled on sugar. So good! I used whole milk in place of half-and-half, since I didn't have it. I think one of the keys is minimal handling, which forming into a rectangle and slicing accomplishes.

Like many other reviewers, I only used the shortcake portion of this recipe and it was fantastic!  I've never had much luck making biscuits but with all the positive reviews, I had to give this one a try.  I followed the directions exactly, except I used 2% milk in the dough, as that was all I had on hand.  The dough seemed very wet after the addition of the egg and milk, but I went with it anyway.  I turned the dough out onto my lightly floured countertop, patted it into shape and made my cuts with a flour dipped knife.  Used the spatula to put them on a sprayed cookie sheet and topped with egg white and sugar.  These were sooo good!  I used plain old strawberries (as if there is any such thing) with a sugar syrup, whipped cream and got rave reviews from all my kids.  My 10 yr old was goofing off and dropped his plate without even taking a bite, but it was so good I didn't want him to miss out on it so I broke my own rules and made him another.  One note, making this into 6 biscuits makes large biscuits, you could easily make this into 8 biscuits and no one would feel shortchanged.  Hmmm, there's one more left, do I dare make myself another plate?

These are FANTABULOUS!!! We served strawberry shortcake at our 4th of July celebration and made these shortcakes. We served 28 people and everyone was saying how good it was and several people asked for the recipe. Grating the frozen butter was a pain, but I think I will try a different method next time. I have a grater attachment that goes to my food processor... I will give that a try next time (Wow! how lazy am I?)

This recipe is by far the best shortcake I have ever made! It's quite moist and not too heavy like you would expect.
It has that melt in your mouth quality and is absolutely divine! 
I made this tonight for a light spring desert and I got rave reviews.
If you're looking for a "perfect shortcake" recipe, as the title suggests it is simply the best!

I'm only giving this a 3 star rating because it just waasn't what I was looking for. The cake part was simple to prepare and had a good taste, but I didn't think that it was the right cake for shortcake. However, I loved the idea of using both frozen and fresh starwberries. That was an excellent idea which I have never thought to do before.

I had high hopes for this recipe...took the previous reviews in stride.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I was quite disappointed in the result.  The biscuit was ok, but that was it...it was too chewy and dry for my preference.  Not "melt-in-your-mouth" shortcake that I was hoping for.  The berrie mixture was great, and that was what redeemed the shortbread.  As a previous reviewer said, these do not make good leftovers.

I had never tried freezing/grating the butter before and it worked like a charm!  The only "negative" comment I have is that they really don't hold up that well.  They're best eaten the same day!  Delicious!

I did as one reviewer done. I patted it in an 8x8 pan.  I will say grating frozen butter is a PIA. Next time I will use a pastry cutter and just cut in cold butter then has been cut into cubes.  I added 4 TBSP of sugar to the dough and did not sprinkle any on top.  I think it had fantastic flavor.  This will definitely be one I use again.

Thank you!  This was awesome.  My family loved it.  I didn't have half and half so I just used milk and it turned out great.  I loved the idea of using the grater for the butter.  The shortcakes are so light.  They are absolutely yummy!

Yum!! I followed the recipe except didn't have half & half, so used 1% milk and it was fine. I also sprayed the baking pan with a small amount of non-stick spray. Instead of cutting them in half, we just crumbled it.  Easy and tasty!

Reminds me of the shortcakes that my mom used to make, only a bit better.  HOWEVER, I have come to prefer a homemade angelfood cake or etc.  They are more fussy, but if I don't have time for them, I'd rather just have strawberries and a touch of whipped cream with a cookie...........  But that's just me.  If I hadn't been served strawberries with light and airy cakes several times of late, I don't think I could have been swayed..... I did enjoy my mother's strawberry shortcakes through the years, but who knew?  now I'm converted....... Thanks for a nice shortcake to help me come to my conclusion though........  If my mom comes through when we have a lot of berries, I might make this recipe just for her........   I'm sure she'd love it, and it's certainly not bad eatin' - I've just been nudged in another direction of late.

Yum!  Just made these and they came out great!  I made them slightly smaller and got about 8 out of each batch (doubled the recipe so I could take these to a party).  I watched them closely while cooking to make sure that they didn't overcook.  I mixed some chopped spearmint leaves in with the whipped cream.  Wonderful!

Very tasty and easy. Although I have a pastry blender and am comfortable using it, I tried this method this time. I will probably use my pastry blender in the future because I think that is easier than grating frozen butter. I had fresh strawberries from our farmer's market and really used only the recipe for the shortcake. Also I added 1/2 cup cocoa to make chocolate shortcakes. Strawberries, chocolate and whipped topping = YUM! :-D

Very good.  Instead of cutting the dough and making this perfect looking we just dropped the batter on the sheet and cooked it that way.

I am glad I searched for a recipe rather than using my mom's shortcake recipe, after-all. (Don't tell her I said so, but this recipe is waay better than hers. haha) I only used 16 ounces of fresh strawberries and no frozen berries, and this was enough for 5 of the 6 cakes. The sixth cake was good just with cool whip on it though. (I used store-bought whip cream.)  Absolutely delicious! I will certainly make this again.

AMAZING!!  I was just craving something sweet after dinner and whipped these up in 5 minutes, but they're delicious and beautiful enough for company.  They came out PERFECTLY crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  My boyfriend couldn't stop talking about how "frickin' yummy" these were!  :)

Excellent shortcake recipe. I mady my own strawberry topping with about 2 lbs ripe strawberries and 5 tbl sugar. I put about 60% of the strawberries in between the layers of the cake and the rest I cooked and pureed for a yummy strawberry syrup. I put whipped cream on top of the shortcake and then drizzled a heaping spoonfull of syrup over it. Perfect!

UNBELIEVABLE!! I have NEVER tasted such a fantastic shortcake recipe EVER! So flaky and moist - I used real butter and whole milk as I didn't have half-and-half but turned out great.  I did my own fruit recipe but if you want a fantastic shortcake, this is the one!!

After reading all the wonderful reviews, I was disappointed in these.  I expected them to be sweeter.  They were just a regular old biscuit.  The only really good part was the outside that had been dusted with sugar.  My husband took a tiny bite and wouldn't even eat one.  I think if it's going to be a dessert biscuit, it should be much sweeter... and more "melt in your mouth."  I will look for another recipe to try.

THE best and easiest shortcake I have ever tried-all other recipes get tossed -this one is definitely a keeper. Followed the recipe exactly except I used light cream since I had it on hand.  Would not change a thing! Light as a feather texture!

These were okay. Since strawberries have come down in price I was dying to make a dessert. I followed the directions for the shortcakes and just used fresh strawberries with homemade whipped cream. First, my shortcakes took REALLY long to bake. at 12 minutes they were completely under-baked, at 15 minutes they still seemed really soft and not brown at all. At around 18 minutes I finally took them out (I wanted them to be slightly golden on top). These have almost no taste to them, not a shortcake taste at least. There is WAY too much butter, mine were very greasy. And they aren't sweet, in fact the biscuits I usually make are sweeter.

I made the shortcake portion of this recipe and it is by far the best shortcake I have ever had.  I didn't read the directions very well and added the egg white to the egg and milk mixture.  They still turned out great!!

These turned out beautiful, and they are so easy to prepare!  I can't stand those store bought sponge things they market as shortcake.  For me they were neither too dry or plain, just sweet enough and complimented the strawberries nicely with real whipped cream.  Thank you for posting this recipe, I've used it time and time again.

SO much better than my usual bisquick shortcakes!  I even cheated with the butter and melted it in the microwave a little to make the mixing process faster.  Great recipe!

After reading several other reviews I decided to give this recipe a try. I have always made the Bisquick recipe but now I will never go back to that type of short cake again.  I followed the recipe exactly, I just happen to have half and half and frozen butter on hand. The frozen butter is a little tricky to shred in the box grater as I was trying not to cut my fingers! I did the butter 2 tablespoons at a time and then mixed it in the flour mixture, that keeps the butter from lumping. They baked up BEAUTIFULLY, delicate golden brown and crispy crust.  I too only used the shortcake part of the recipe. I agree with another reviewer, you could cut these in eight biscuits and not notice the difference but I am sure you will want a second helping. They are awesome and I plan on just trying the biscuit with coffee in the morning and trying them with other fruit such as peaches. If you had 6 stars I would definitely give the recipe all SIX! GREAT recipe!!

Easy to make!  Spreading the VERY COLD = STIFF (pieces that spread easy and easily) butter flakes is the secret.  I hand-tossed every tablespoon.    What a lovely recipe.  I used a glass as cookie cutter; didn't want a mess today. Served hubby a hot one with butter / honey and HE told me to save the recipe! During dinner he said he wants to get mexican table cream to pour on for breakfast.  These are shortcakes but are very scone ......ish!  YUM!

I didn't try the butter method, but LOVED these shortcakes!  The dough was super easy, baked up beautifully and tasted even better.  Definitely use the sugar on top - it's not overpowering (as I thought it might be).  This is my go-to recipe for shortcakes from now on!  Thanks!

OH MY GOSH!  These were SO EASY, SO FAST, and SOOOOO YUMMY!  :)  I've never made shortbread before, but we had a ton of cheap fresh local strawberries (I only used the biscuits part of this recipe) and were craving Strawberry Shortcake.  I tried grating the butter, which mostly worked and might have been a lot less messy if it hadn't been 100 degrees today...  it certainly was fast.  Also, I decided not to roll out the dough as mine was kind of wet- instead I roughly shaped 6 balls and dropped them on my cookie sheet.  I will say the sprinkled sugar on top is a MUST! Makes all the difference! :)  Anyways- I will definitely be making this again and again this summer!  Thank You!

This review is based on a slightly modified version of the shortcakes only. I did not have butter or half-and-half on hand so I substituted equivalent amounts of Smart Balance tub spread and fat free milk.  Even with these changes, the shortcakes lived up to their name. The dough was easy to handle and baked into attractive, generously sized cakes with wonderful texture and just enough sweetness. I added sweetened berries and Cool Whip to mine but if I'm feeling decadent one day, I may go with the full monty version as printed here. For now at least, the shortcake recipe is in my permanent file. Thank you, thank you!

It really is the perfect shortcake. I don't have to look for a shortcake recipe any longer!
The only thing I would do differently is use a pastry cutter. The frozen butter idea is amazing - in theory. I found it to be an absolute mess in practice. It doesn't take long before it starts to melt, then there isn't enough butter for the wrapper, and that's when you've got butter all over your fingers. I prefer to use the pastry cutter. Besides this, I found it easy and absolutely delicious.

For this recipe, I used a mix of marionberries, blueberries, and rasberries. I did not freeze or grate the butter. I took cold butter and cut it into small pieces with a pastry knife. The result was a great recipe for a fruit shortcake. Another plus is the short baking time.

I have made this a million times.  I only use fresh strawberries with a little balsamic vinegar marinade.  Has to be the best shortcake recipe ever!  I recently made it with un bleached flour because that's all I had and it was perfect.  Seemed to cut out the mild baking powder taste it's always had.  Coincidence? Maybe.  We'll find out tonight when I make it yet again!

Absolutely foolproof!  This recipe gave me the most beautiful, moist shortcake I have ever made.  Grating the butter?--Genius!  Simply beautiful to look at and delicious to eat!

Loved this recipe.  I only made the biscuits for it then used sweetened strawberries and whipped cream.  I didn't have any baking powder (can you believe that??!) so I used half the amount of baking soda as a substitute.  I also just cut the butter in and it worked out fine.  It wasn't too sweet or too dry and it was perfect for short cakes!  We loved the flavor of these...I will be making these again!  Maybe next time I will follow the recipe exactly but I don't know how they could get better!

That Shortcake!  is easy and tastes great.. I had one
difference with it..I don't care for as much shortcake as some to with the strawberries...This recipe easily doubled the servings as displayed..Soft.. sweet.. and keep better than the usual ones.

Maybe I did something wrong. The shortcake is more like a dry biscuit. (Although I didn't add the sheen) the "candied" berries on the dry bisquit wasn't a good match. Noone touched these :-( 

HOWEVER! the "shortcake" recipe is a good and easy recipe for biscuits! ....

Absolutely loved the shortcake!!  I didn't go all out with the berry combo, but just used a simple strawberry in sugar to top.  Shared with a friend and her two little picky eaters - they all gave big thumbs up and smiles.

Very easy to make, tasted great, the only reason it got 4/5 stars was because the cake part was very crumbly, made it a bit difficult to both cut and eat. Other than that, it was very good!

Delicious!  I didn't have half and half for the shortbread, so I took a chance and used 1% milk.  It was delicious!  A definite keeper.  Much better than those weird sponge cakes at the store and just as easy as a Bisquick recipe.

*I just made the shortbread*
Excellent.  Easy, tender shortcake.  I pressed the dough into flattened balls, besides that, I followed the directions exactly and it was delish.

Very good recipe and easy using the grated butter technique. Its more like a scone or shortbread with just enough sweetness to compliment the strawberries.

I just used the shortcake recipe, not the berry recipe. It was amazing! Next time I will sift the dry ingredients...there were a few baking powder clumps. I tossed fresh strawberries with sugar and a touch of balsalmic vinagar instead of the frozen/fresh mized berries.Delicious!

I just used the shortbread recipe and it was perfect.  I loved the eggwhite wash with the sugar crystals.  Made for a nice crunchy crust with the macerated strawberries on top.  This is a keeper!!

Excellent!!!!!! These are the best shortcakes that I have ever made, or ever had.  The extra sugar on top made them crunchy.  My husband loved them! We went to the Strawberry Festival in Plant City, Florida over the weekend and my husband declined a strawberry shortcake there.  He said he would rather have the ones that I made instead. I also made my own strawberries recipe.

This is the way my mom always made shortcake, very simple but good - and not too sweet. I didn't have the kind of butter that could be frozen so I took a chance and just used regular butter, I don't know if that made a huge difference.. Also didn't bake them they way it said, just made them like cookies and had big balls of it, the same way you'd make cookies but bigger. Used fresh berries with a little sprinkle of sugar. Delicious :)

Great recipe!  Definitely recommend including the step of brushing the tops with egg white & sprinkling with sugar - added a sweetness & slight crunch that I think makes the shortcake that much better.  I've never frozen and grated butter like this recipe calls for, but since I have only basic kitchen appliances/tools, I found that it sped up the process nicely.  Didn't bother with the fruit suggestion, since I always do the same thing: fresh strawberries with a bit of sugar to get the juices flowing!

I had never tried making shortcakes before.  I used my Cusinart to grate the butter, so that took me a few seconds to do.  I followed the recipe and they came out fantastic.  Beautiful, but casual and delicious dessert.  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this!

These are excellent!! Don't over mix the dough, as that will cause them to become dense.  I follow the recipe exactly, sometimes adding a bit more milk a tiny bit at a time to get the dough to come together nicely.  I roll into balls and flatten once on my baking sheet, and then dust with sugar.  They have excellent flavor, are moist and light.  I make a strawberry sauce from fresh or frozen berries, as well I slice fresh berries.  I split the shortcakes horizontally, spoon on the sauce over the bottom shortcake, then the sliced berries next, and finally a nice dallop of fresh whipped cream and then top with the pretty sugared top.  Very beautiful presentation and so very divine!!

This recipe was good, but I liked the shortcake better without the berries and whipped topping. The salty flavor of the cake overwhelmed the entire dessert. Will make these again, but not for strawberry shortcake.

these were so rich I could hardly stand it. Not sweet, very biscuit-ish, but very rich with strawberries on top. My husband still prefers sponge cake (YUCK) but these are divine!

Oh my God!!! This was wonderful!! I love the grating the butter! They were tender and sweet.  I only added 3 tablespoons of sugar to the cakes and sprinkled pearl sugar and a little cinnamon on top. I did only make the cakes not the berry part!!

I used this shortcake recipe and topped it with strawberries, balsalmic vinegar, sugar and a tiny bit of black pepper and whipped cream and it was amazing.

I used fresh strawberries, and since I didn't have any frozen ones but still wanted the juice, I put some of the berries in the food processor and added it back to the rest of the strawberries.  Perfect!  I also used whole milk instead of half and half, and it turned out great as well.  My husband liked it (there's not much, especially desserts, that he doesn't like!).  Great recipe!

Made just the shortcakes last night, scaling the recipe down to 2.  Very good, but a couple of suggestions, of course:  First, it was not quite sweet enough. Perhaps you might add a bit more sugar.  I also added a big drop of Vanilla 'cause I like it.  Most important suggestion though, don't flatten them out too much like I did.  Keep at least 1 1/2 thick or make them like drop biscuits.  Then you get nice nooks and crannies for the egg white and sugar to collect in.   FINALLY, if you are only baking them for two, scale the recipe to three because they weren't quite big enough.  Flavor, with a bit more sugar, was great.  Next time I'm going to add a bit of cardomom like another reviewer suggested.  Sounds interesting.

Fantastic! I made this for a girlfriend's baby shower and it was a huge success.  I think the idea of freezing the butter and grating it is nothing short of genius, and the whole process was much simpler than I anticipated.  Instead of thawed frozen berries I substituted fresh strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries.  I added sugar to allow the berries to macerate while the biscuits were baking, and the combination of berries, biscuits and whipped cream was simply to die for!  I'll be making this again (and again, and again).

Good recipe, but not the one I was hoping for.  Very easy.  I followed it exactly, except I added a teaspoon or so of pure maple syrup to the heavy cream before whipping it.  I cut the sugar in half for the whipped cream as well.

I found these to be a nice balance between a drier biscuit shortcake and cake -- they were tender with a nice texture, buttery, and sweet. My husband doesn't care for biscuit shortcakes, but he liked these. It's an easy recipe and will probably be my standby for shortcakes from now on. Be sure to read the recipe thoroughly before you begin because it has a few twists from the usual. Pass the berries! Yum!

Nice scone-like biscuits, although a tad dry.  These were easy to make, which is always a plus.

These shortcakes are fabulous.  I followed the recipe exactly, and there's nothing I would change.  The biscuits are great on their own or with berries.  No more shortcakes made from baking mix for me.

These are very good, altho I would've liked more sugar IN the batter, rather than on top. Also, these are huge! If I make again, I'll cut into 8 pieces, at least!

These are excellent... just the right blend of softness in the middle with a bit of a crisp edge and the perfect amount of sweetness to set off whatever berry you serve them with.  My children are my biggest critics and there are never any left over when I make these (they'll eat them the next morning for breakfast with jam).  I don't bother with the grating of the butter (can be pretty messy) but just let it soften a bit and use the pasty cutter.  Or the two fork method works well too.

Oh My Goodness this is the best shortcake I have ever made. I made the dough just like it said and it was so easy. I did use a biscuit cutter to cut it out though. Perfect. This is my last search for shortcake,because it is the only one I will make from now on

These are super simple scone-like recipe.  I was scrambling to get a desert put together and this recipe was perfect.  Since I was preparing last minute, I didn't have my butter frozen. No worries, just use your regular cold butter with a pastry cutter and slice your butter in about 8 slices and blend it in a bit less fine than you would for a crust, or finer pastry.  I also didn't have anything but 2% milk, so I used it!!  I skipped rolling or patting out my shortcakes into a rectangle, since my counter-top was full!!  I just patted out right on my cooking stone, and sliced 6 ways ways, like a pizza, then moved the slices a couple of inches apart.  I set my timer for 10 minutes, but kept going until about 15 minutes, using refrigerated butter, 2% milk and a cooking stone.  The short-cakes came out perfect and my family raved!!

These were great!  I did use more sugar to sweeten them up a little bit and make them more shortcake-like as opposed to scone-like.  I liked the idea of shredding the butter, but in the end just used a pastry cutter as it was more of a pain to shred over the bowl rather than just use the pastry blender and get it done.  Loved that it has a lot of butter!  Makes these very tender and flakey.  Thanks for sharing!

Easy and delicious.  I made the shortcake part of the recipe and just used sugared fresh strawberries and fresh whipped cream.  I grated refrigerated butter and it worked really well.  It makes incorporating the ingredients so easy!  I used the suggested amount of sugar for the top and really liked it.  I also just divided the dough into six portions and shaped them into rounds with my hands.  So easy and delicious!

I used my food processor which to me seems easier.  I just cut the butter into small pieces and it worked great.   I baked them on parchment paper and lowered the oven temp to 400.  I think it could even come down to 375 to avoid getting too dark on the bottoms.  I like that you can make it ahead and put the shortcake squares in the fridge till ready to bake.  We served with fresh lightly sugared strawberries and cool whip.  The kids added vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce to theirs.

This worked great.  We had them for Christmas brunch with a variety of fruits.  My butter was just hard-chilled, but it still grated well.  No more expensive Bisquick from the import store for me!   For those of you who wonder about not grating the butter, how you incorporate your fats/oils into your flour really makes a difference in your recipes.  Therefore, the most similar method to grating the butter would probably be using a pastry fork, which is more work.

I have a confession to make. These shortcakes smelled so good that i ate one hot out of the oven(i'm blaming the dog)! I would definately add a teaspoon of vanilla. It really added to the flavor. I topped with fresh whipped cream and strawberries(what was left of them that is, after the dog got at em')! Very yummy. I will never use another shortcake recipe(sorry Mom)

I REALLY hate giving 3 star rating but this recipe was just okay.... The biscuits didn't have much flavour (I even added a teaspoon of vanilla) and tasted more like team biscuits...The idea though of grating the butter was terrific!!!
I'll keep looking for a good shortcake biscuit!

These were great and super easy to make. I followed the recipe except used frozen margarine instead of butter. I also made the Easy Whipped Cream recipe from this website to put over the cakes and fresh strawberries. A definite keeper!

I did not expect this recipe to work for me since I'm usually pastry challenged, but it was easy and surprisingly quick.  I grated cold (not frozen) butter and used whole milk (all I had on hand).  Delicious!  I did not find it dry or dense as some other reviewers.  Moister and lighter than a typical scone.

WOW these were awesome! I only used the shorcake recipe and I have to say I will use it again and again. The only changes I made were the following:
1. Only had fat free 1/2 & 1/2 
2. Only had unbleached flour
3. Did not freeze my butter (no time)
4. Cut them with a biscuit cutter because I wanted to use my Aussie cutter shapes which made many more than stated in recipe and kept eye on them in the oven. Baking time was about the same.
All I can say is these were the ultimate shortcakes.
They were so tasty and flaky, again the ultimate!
I believe grating the butter makes it flakier and lighter. I will use this method to make my other doughs ie- pies 
Thank you so much for posting the recipe!

This is a super yummy shortcake recipe! Easy enough with ingredients that are on hand and the result with berries on top is so pretty and impressive. I used whole milk instead of half and half. Also, I just used my butter out of the fridge and grated that. The grating still worked except it got mushy at the end. Thanks for a yummy recipe to add to my frequent list!

I made these ( used only the recipe for the biscutis) for the 4th of July for the first time and they were really good. I loved the tip about the flour/butter so much! It couldn't have made things easier. My biscuits were tender and had such a good taste. I didn't bother rolling out, I just scopped 6 mounds of it out and called it a day. I just served some strawberries mixed with a little vanilla and cool whip on top and it was great. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is by far the best recipe I've used for baking. It was way easier than I thought for how amazing the end result was. I've bookmarked it and will keep using it for friends and family. I'm sure it will become a family fave!!!

Super easy recipe and turned out really well.  Definitely use the Egg white to help give it a nice gloss.  I'd recommend a heavier sugar for dusting.

This is the best shortcake ever!  I made six round shortcakes.  In the future, I’ll make eight, six were pretty big. Other than that, I followed the shortcake portion of the recipe exactly and served with fresh, sugared strawberries and Reddi Whip. I took all to a dinner party.  Everyone raved!

Made this for the 4th of July and it was perfect. I had a lot of fresh berries to use from berry picking  so in lieu of crushing the frozen berries I just mashed some of the fresh berries.

These were so good. I made them for my 50th bday party. I ended up making 1 1/2 x the recipe. So easy, I'm gloing to use the butter grating trick again. The only change was I added a tsp of vanilla. I had so many complements on the actual shortcake. They're  light & not to sweet. I've been asked for the recipe. They were compared to scones. After the party I ate them wo topping. I'm looking forward to playing w the them some more. 

I made a compote of fresh blueberries &strawberries w 1/4 c sugar and apple juice. I also masserated fresh berries w sugar & strawberry/ pear flavored white balsamic (amazing stuff.) Mixed them together added fresh basil. Topped it w basil infused fresh whipped cream. Overall, super happy!

I only had buttermilk so I used it and I made a mistake and added the vanilla to the wet ingredients.  I loved them.  They were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside...just like me!

I made recipe in a glass 8 X 8 square pan and baked at same time.  Rose beautifully and I cut in squares for the people as needed and split square in half and served fruit on top.  Did not use frozen berries just fresh.  Turned out great and shortcake stayed fresh in square pan.  Less work than making into rounds and people can choose the size of their shortcake..

The flavor was decent but I thought they were fairly dense. For us there was too much bread-to-fruit even with just using a half biscuit.  I'll keep searching for something a bit flakier.

Very time-consuming and expensive to make.  Grating the butter was a nightmare and I will never do that again, for any recipe... the end result was disappointing.  The shortcake was heavy and tasteless.

Very successful and delicious- brought this to mother's day lunch with the folks and they all raved. Definitely freeze the butter. I had mine in the fridge and it started to soften in my hot little hands while grating and it got a bit messy. And I used less than a tbsp of sugar on the tops of the cakes. I too hand-shaped six round cakes but I found that 14 minutes in the oven wasn't quite enough - they still seemed undercooked slightly in the centre even after being toasted for a few minutes before serving, though nobody complained, quite the opposite. Maybe I didn't move the rack into the right position? I'll try one lower next time, which there definitely will be.

I'm not usually one to rate recipes, but this recipe is great. I only made the shortcake part. Having the butter completely frozen really helps the texture, but the gratings makes it so easy! Also, I cut them into smaller squares, as this recipe is a meal in itself.

I made this with frozen berry mix (raspberry, blueberry, blackberry) and fresh strawberries.    The frozen butter process worked well and the dough was easy to work with.   My only disappointment was the texture of the biscuits.  I thought they would be softer.  But my guests said they liked the hardness because it reminded them of a pie pastry crust.

I just made this recipe with wonderful results. And the idea of grating the butter is genius and I plan to use that method for other recipes. I followed the recipe as written and all the details the author included were very helpful. I only made the shortcakes as I had prepared strawberries yesterday. Thanks so much for posting this recipe, it is a keeper!

I have looked at several shortcake recipes and this is the first one I tried. Good choice! The shortcake was great. I didn't have half and half so I used whipping cream. I used fresh macerated strawberries which made the bottom of the cake a bit soggy so I plan to cut back on the sugar in the berries next time.

No doubt the best shortcake recipe.  The old standby Betty Crocker cook book quintessential recipe is out the door!  Use fresh berries, never use frozen.

Made a mistake and added all of the sugar to the mix. But they came out delicious, almost like shortbread.

My shortcakes came out delicious!! However, I did not like the grater method for the butter. It was difficult and made a huge mess. I ended up just dumping it in the food processor and that was much easier. Also, they never got quite golden brown on top, but the bottoms were starting to burn. Next time I will try putting the rack in the center of the oven rather than the "lower-middle." Thanks for the recipe!!

Perfect shortcakes! I baked a little less time, for lighter color than "golden brown". I will use the grated frozen butter technique from now on in many recipes. Thanks!

I only used the biscuit recipe, and it may have been because I used margarine, but there's far to much liquid in the recipe. I only used 1/4 cup of liquid and the mixture was still very moist. 

I also found that the biscuit needed more sugar as it was plain and floury. 
Otherwise, it had a decent texture.

Great recipe. I have used it twice in a week of discovering it. I did not use half and half but a quarter cup of skim mix with double cream.  It worked well.

This was so easy, I had it prepared and out of the oven cooling in 30 minutes.  They taste like a cross between a sugar cookie and pie crust...  Next time I will make them smaller, getting 12 instead of 6 because they are very rich and filling.  I didn't have enough fresh whipping cream so I used cool-whip for my topping.. still very tasty..

I'm living abroad for the year, and my kitchen has limited appliances. I followed the shorcake recipe, but then just topped the cakes with strawberries chopped into strawberry yogurt. This is a delicious, no hassle dessert, and I was excited to find a recipe that didn't require the use of a beater or mixer. Thanks!

The best Strawberry Shortcake to ever come out of this house!  The frozen butter was so easy to work into this recipe.I wish I had heard of this method before now,  I'm going to try this approach with my next pie crust.  The dessert got rave reviews and request for more as the seasons and fruits change. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

These shortcakes were amazing!!  They were so good right out of the oven.  I didn't make the whipped topping, just used extra creamy Cool Whip.  I used frozen strawberries and they were ok.  I'll use fresh next time.  These shortcakes are too yummy to cover with mediocre berries.  I'll definately be making this again!

I am usually not a fan of Strawberry Shortcake because of the spongecake you normally get with it. This recipe changed my whole outlook on shortcakes. The cake was definitely worth the time it took to hand make it. Best shortcake I ever had. I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

I really liked these, but my husband did not as much. He didn't care much for the biscuit/shortcake part. I think he would've prefered a pound cake type base. I made them with fresh berries.

This is the best shortcake I've ever made!  I've gotten lots of compliments on them.  I don't even bother with the egg whites, but I do sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on before baking.  This is now my staple shortcake recipe!

I have always been a sponge-cake kind of girl before I discovered this recipe. Used just the shortcake recipe, not the berries - my family and friends rave about the texture and flavor.  It is the best. This is one of those recipes I will pass down to future generations.

A very nice shortcake recipe. I have made it twice now. It was a lot easier to grate the butter on a flat grater than a box one.
I only used fresh strawberries as it seems wrong to use frozen at this time of year.

YUM!  I made this twice, once as a practice run and once for Mother's Day and it was a hit both times.  I used fresh strawberries soaked in a little sugar and halved the flour with whole wheat flour.  It's a great basic shortcake biscuit recipe and the grating butter tip is terrific- think I'll try that the next time I make scones.  Thanks!

Great cakes! I used Parkay Margarine oil (same amount but 50% less fat); I also used skim milk instead of half and half.  Also, I didn't have frozen butter so I forked in very cold butter.  They were great - maybe a little chewier and denser (my husband says they are more like a biscuit).

This shortcake recipe is awesome. It takes a little time to grate the butter but the results are well worth it. Very light, fluffy yet crunchy. The perfect foil to fresh summer berries.

I was looking for a homemade equivalent to bisquick biscuits -- these were very good but a little too hard.  Maybe I overbaked them?  I got lots of compliments on the recipe at the gathering I brought it to.  Thanks!

Wouldnt say its perfect but I did like it tweaked it a lil used cake instead of ap and added some cinnamon honey and a bit of soda.  I also used a 8 x 8 cake pan to shape it lined with plastic to pull it out easily.  But I would add more sugar cuz I like it sweeter, but thats just me :).
