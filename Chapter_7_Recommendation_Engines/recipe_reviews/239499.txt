I've been getting a lot of sweet potatoes in my weekly produce box and I don't really like them because they're, well...sweet. I was worried these would still carry the sweetness of the potatoes, but it's totally mellow and not sweet at all. They definitely need a dip or a sauce because they're a little dry, but they're versatile so you could add anything to suit what you're making. They would probably be good as a substitute for meatballs in a red sauce pasta dish. The only thing is change would be to add salt to the mixture. It's too bland without it. I added salt afterwards while they were still hot and they were fine. I'll be experimenting with these again!

I enjoyed these sweet potato sage balls very much.  These are not a usual potato cake.  They are quite delicate on the palate but also quite flavourful.  I had to use 3 Tbsp of mayonnaise instead of the egg.  I served them with some tartar sauce and the tanginess of the capers complimented the sweet potato and onion quite well.  The oatmeal was more of a texture input than flavour I think.  I served these as an appetiser with Popa's Pickled Eggs (there's why I had no egg left for this dish), marinated artichoke hearts and mild banana peppers.  The texture went well with the artichoke hearts but the flavour with the vinegary/hot peppers and pickled eggs really sent it over the top.  I used left over baked sweet potatoes that had been in the fridge for 2 days and they came out perfectly.  I obviously don't know what size a golf ball is so I was able to get 14 balls out of one batch.  Thank you Sueb for the recipe.

I did not care for this recipe.  These sweet potato sage balls were REALLY bland -- perhaps creative seasoning would help.  Great idea, but IMHO needs work.

I cut the recipe in half except for the potato and used 2 T mayo instead of the egg.  Yummy
