Fabulous chicken salad! I LOVE chicken salad and this is some of the best. The ginger is a nice touch and I love the combination of fruits and the crunch from the walnuts.  I used Hellman's light mayo that I cut with a little light sour cream to give it the dressing even more creaminess and the honey gave it just the right amount of sweetness.  This would be equally good with craisins or pecans.  Great by itself, but really good on whole grain bread! Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband is a picky eater, and we agree that this is the BEST chicken salad we have ever had! The only way I can actually let it set overnight is to not let him find out it's there.  Tip for the recipe, I don't buy extra minced ginger for the recipe, I just mince the piece that I used to boil the chicken. It's so much easier that way.

This is a great chicken salad recipe! The ginger was a nice addition I'm sure I will use again. I did not use the star-anise pod as I didn't have it but would like to try it the next time I make this recipe. The next time I make it I will probably just chop up the ginger that I boiled with the chicken as another reviewer suggested. I actually had some of this salad for lunch with a friend (on a croissant of course!) who called me the next day to tell me she was thinking about the chicken salad that we ate.....really good recipe!

I was looking for a more flavorful chicken salad and I found it!  This recipe is absolutely delicious, has a lot of flavor and is a perfect balance of ginger and fruit.  We ate it on croissants and it was a wonderful combination.  LOVE IT!!

I LOVED this and will make it often. I had oven baked chicken leftover so I skipped the first part. I used less fresh ginger - I'm pretty new to it. I also didn't have celery but had all other ingredients. Yum!

I just made this earlier today and it is fantastic! I did however make a few small changes. I added a couple small pinches of both rosemary and thyme to the water when I cooked the chicken. I also added a couple of pinches of both to the "sauce" along with a pinch of dill weed. I also used granny Smith apples for a little more tartness and did half and half with raisins and cranberries.  It turned out absolutely delicious with some fresh toasted rye bread.

Awesome. Delicious and so easy to make.  I substituted leftover chicken I had already baked and it worked out very well.  I will definitely tell friends about this one.  Maybe I should take it to the next office potluck.

Best chicken salad I’ve ever had! We took it on a camping trip and one of the guys said he’s never liked chicken salad but loved this one. Only thing I did different, I used grapes instead of raisins. Love the flavor the ginger adds....who would have thought?!?! Thank you!

This is definately a wonderful recipe.  I did, however, double the dressing as I like more.  I also served this in little mini filo cups, but, is great either way.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe.
