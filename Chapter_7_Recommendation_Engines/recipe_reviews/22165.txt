Horray! I made this recipe a few weeks ago but have been unable to "find" it to review it until now. Good soup! It is a little thick but can easily be fixed by adding water or broth. I was too scared to stick my bowls under the broiler so I placed the croutons ("garlic croutons" also from this site) and cheese over each bowl and melted the cheese in the microwave for a few seconds. Everyone really enjoyed this hearty soup. Thanks Miss Betty Crocker!!

Wow!!!!!!!!  Fabulous recipe-quick and easy, plus it tasted soooooo good!  The only thing I did differently was I added a 15 ounce can of tomato sauce and then filled the empty can with water and added that too-this thickens up quickly.  It was so easy to prepare yet the taste made it seem like it had been simmering all day!  My husband and sons loved this, I will be making this often!

A good, hearty Italian flavored soup recipe.  For more broth and to tone down the tomato alittle, I added 2 cans of beef broth.  Also, I added a couple of tablespoons of cottage cheese to each bowl of soup & mixed that in before topping with the croutons and cheese.
