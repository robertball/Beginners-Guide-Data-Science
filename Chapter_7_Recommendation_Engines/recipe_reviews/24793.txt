A great recipe for lemon lovers like me! But I have to agree that marinating for a couple of hours in the straight lemon juice is plenty.  Overnight would be overkill and probably just about disintegrate the meat!  Make sure you do use fresh lemon juice, as it imparts nice fresh flavor.  One point to note: browning the chicken takes nowhere near 15 minutes - about 5 minutes is right.  Adding the lemon slice & parsley is great too.  I've made this twice now; once with the brown sugar (only about 1 tsp. for 3 breasts though) & once without.  I don't really notice a big difference, but I guess it adds a nice touch. The sauce at the end is also very good over rice.

This is soooooooo good!  I will admit i made a few alterations based on past reviews. First of all, i did not marinate overnight, but rather placed the frozen chicken in the ziplock and let it thaw in the marinade. I took the chicken out mid afternoon.  I browned it as per the direstions but then added the brown sugar to the stock rather than sprinkling it on top.  I DID NOT reuse any of the marinade in the sauce, cause thats just gross! Instead i added a tbsp. of lemon juice. I cooked it uncovered so the sauce would reduce and it ended up coming out perfectly. It thickened nicely and looked delicious. I cant even describe how much my family loved this, and have been told i need to make this ALOT!

I used my own recipe for lemon chicken, but I converted it to how this recipe was prepared (marinating overnite in lemon juice, then frying AND baking the chicken). It made my recipe 100 times better, so juicy, the chicken absorbing all that lemon flavor. You've forever changed the way I make this dish...thank you!

Very tasty. I marinated the chicken for 2 hours & doubled the paprika. I drained the oil after removing the chicken & added all marinade & double the broth along with the brown sugar & 1 tsp of corn starch. Made plenty of delicious sauce to put on chicken! Served with brown rice/orzo on the side.

This is the best lemon chicken I have ever had. However, I've tried marinating it for only a few hours and overnight, and I think it tastes better if it marinates a few hours. I've also found that this dish freezes well. Also, a funny story about making this.. one time I decided to add extra paprika and gave a few extra shakes of it into the flour mixture. After cooking it and tasting it I realized I'd grabbed CAYENNE PEPPER by mistake. Not good with lemon and brown sugar!

Great recipe. The only alterations I made; half the amount of brown sugar and marinade in 1/2 cup lemon and enough olive oil and white wine to make another half cup. Oh, and i cut some fresh rosemary, which was a great addition! yum

This is the best Lemon Chicken I have ever tasted.
I made this recipe For a dinner party and they demanded I email the recipe to some of the guests. I never have enough time to marinate overnite so I'm usually left with a few hours. I also double the sauce because its great over rice.

Great recipe! Though as we like spicy dishes I added one more tsp of paprika. Also for those out there wanting a more lemon taste dish it might help to do the following: after squeezing all the juice of 5 lemons (1 cup) put the lemons in a food processor and put the crushed skins through a sift. It should add 1/2 a cup of very strong lemon juice! I also put all the lemon juice with the broth.

I made this for dinner last night, and my husband and I both loved it!  I found the recipe kind of last-minute, so I didn't get to marinate the chicken overnight (only for a half hour).  Regardless, it turned out great!  I was a little wary of adding brown sugar, but it definitely set this recipe apart from other lemon chicken recipes out there.  Without question, I will prepare it again!  Thanks, Megan!

This was an awesome recipe but I did as it said to marinate overnight and the chicken was waaaaaay too sour! I would try it again but only marinate for an hour at most.

My husband don't like when I try out new recipes (not that stops me) but when I heard "wow honey" neesless to say I was very happy. I wasn't too sure about this one either, but I was pleasantly suprised on how good it was. It was very moist, and had a nice flavor to it...the lemon & brown sugar worked very well together. I'm glad I took the chance and tried it!

Fabulous! I soaked the chicken in the lemon juice for about 45 minutes and it had plenty of flavor! Excellent recipe. I will definitely do this again!

This was tasty but the breading got a little soggy. I think I'll make it without the breading next time.

LOVED THIS!! Did mix brown sugar with the chicken broth vs  topping it seperately. Served with white rice. Only suggestion is to make more of the juice and warm it on the stove seperately from the chicken (Its that good that you want  more) and mixed with the rice.. It gives a sweet and sour taste. I marinated my chicken for 12 hours and the lemon was not over powering. Next time I will try marinating over night.

I was SO excited to try out this recipe. I loved it. My only complaints are that I don't think the brown sugar is needed. It took away from that lemon flavor and covered it up with a sweet taste that didn't blend too well in my opinion. Presentation wise...gorgeous. I was so proud when I pulled the baking dish out of the own. It looked like it was from a magazine. All in all a good recipe and I think I'll keep it.

Excellent recipe. A few changes: first add more sauce, second I used thin cut chicken breasts the last time I made it and it turned out GREAT!! I only marinated for 45 min because of the thin breasts and it turned out FABULOUS (way better than using thick breasts because the flavors are more potent. Because of the thin breast cuts I reduced the frying time to only 2-3 minutes per side and cooked in the oven at 350 for 12 minutes. Also I reduced the sauce for 5 minutes in a sauce pan before putting in the oven to make up for the reduced oven time. Honestly, one of my favorite meals!   Try pairing with the reciepe on this site for breaded brussels sprouts. My whole family loves both of these together!!

I followed somebody's previous suggestion and only used 1 cup of lemon juice mixed with one cup of water to marinate the chicken over night.  This was a mistake, the chicken barely had a lemon taste at all.  If I make this dish again, I will definately use 2 cups of lemon juice when marinating.  After frying it and putting in the pan with the chicken broth and marinade, I think it probably still needs more lemon juice squeezed over it.  The brown sugar tasted kinda funny but if it had been more lemony, it probably would have tasted good.  My suggestion is to follow this recipe pretty closely, if you want some flavor.  It still might need a little extra flavoring though, maybe just more lemon juice.  If you're looking for tender chicken, try "Amy's Egg and Garlic chicken", on this site.  It's the best chicken I've ever cooked.

This recipes was SO good! like many of the reviewers, i only marinated the chicken for a few hours and the flavor was perfect! The only thing i did differently was i used chicken tenderloins instead and they were so tender!! Iserved about four per person. and I  used 2/3 of the lemon juice for the marinade and with the rest i made my sauce sepeeratly-- i brought about two cups of water to a boil with light chicken stock and i added the brown sugar, lemon juice, and a rue (flour and butter) and it made an excelent sauce! served with wild rice and french cut green beans it was a smashing sucess!!

It is high time I review this recipe, as I've made it many times now. I follow the recipe exactly, except that I don't think I've ever used 2 cups of lemon juice (lemons get expensive!!).  I juice a couple and then just turn the chicken a few times to make sure it's evenly covered. I do marinate overnight; I don't think it gets "too lemony," but I do love lemon!

This is a huge hit every time I make it. I serve it over brown rice, which complements the tangy chicken quite well.

I love lemon chicken, and this tasted great. I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs because that's what I had. Also I fried the chicken in a deep fryer, instead of a pan before baking it. It turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.

I really loved this chicken.  I was looking for a easy recipe to cater a large family party, and was very pleased with the results.  I found that the flavor came out just right, not too lemony.  I marinated the chicken overnight.  My husband LOVED it.  I can't wait to serve it at the party!

I belive that the lemon flavor was too strong. I suggest to marinate the chicken for a few hours rather than over night.

My family loved this! I marinated over night and it tasted very lemony but we liked that. I did use the full 1/3 cup of brown sugar. Yummy

Oh My Gosh! This recipe is AMAZING! I made it for Easter. I knew I wanted to make a chicken dish and this is the one it suggested. Since, I found it at he last minute I didn't realize it needed to marinate overnight, so I pricked lots of holes in the chicken with a fork and put it in the fridge while I made the other side dishes. It probably marinated 1 1/2 hours and I forgot the brown sugar and it turned out fantastic! Everyone loved it and I was told that I know how to cook! LOL. I can't wait to make it again see what it tastes like marinating overnight and adding the brown sugar!

Thank you sharing this wonderful recipe Megan :)

I marinated mine for a full 24 hrs. I could have even gone longer. I did use tenders so I only fried for a few minutes.  Great lemon flavor!

I had to leave the chicken in the lemon marinade two days instead of one because of a change in dinner plans.  Big mistake.  The brown sugar did not offset the strong lemon flavor in the chicken. I'm not sure I'll try it again.

This is my newest recipe that I love to cook and NOT share!! It is so easy and tastes so good that I don't want others cooking it! LOL My family is burnt out on chicken, but my husband said 'yeah, now I could eat this once a week!' and my 8 year old daughter said 'Now we can make it instead of ordering it'!! WONDERFUL!! (I tossed all the marinade and used fresh lemon juice in the sauce as another reviewer added)

I thought this was really good, especially for how easy it is.  I only marinated the chicken for about 20 minutes in the lemon juice, just b/c of lack of time.  I also didn't measure the juice but I doubt I even used 1 cup for 4 breasts.  I also only pan cooked the chicken for about 5 minutes on each side, if that.  I'm always looking for new recipes for boneless, skinless chicken breast and this will definitely go into my rotation.

A strangle little recipe but Wow did my small dinner party love it. Marinated only two hours, used chicken tenders, tripled the 'sauce' used 1/3 to pour over before baking. The rest of the sauce  was reduced and  sweetened with a bit more brown sugar to taste (my fresh lemons were so tart!) then swirled in a cold pat of butter, this was  poured over chicken as it came out of oven. It is all about tasting to get the right sweet with tang! 4 stars cuz I had to tweak it.

Love this recipe, has rave reviews. Made it first for all my new uni friends and everyone asked me to make it again. I did make a lomon sauce to serve over the top (the thick lemony sauce often served in chinese restaurants) by boiling up lemon juice, left over lemon peel, and sugar to taste (white or brown is fine). It doe stake about a cup of sugar though!

This recipe was pretty good. I only fried the chicken about 5 minutes before putting it in the baking dish, and it still took exactly 30 minutes to bake afterward. The chicken was very moist and could easily be cut with a fork. I didn't have fresh parsley so I added dried parsley to the coating mix. I also omitted the lemon slices as I was out of lemons after trying to get 2 c. fresh juice for the marinade. I wish the sauce had thickened more; I like my lemon chicken saucy. I think when making this recipe again, I will make a second batch of the sauce to top the chicken with, but boil it on the stove to thicken.

For some reason I usually only have chicken thighs laying around the house. I used those and this recipe was great. The only thing I'm skeptical about it marinating them for a long time. After a couple hours the citrus will start to cook the chicken. I advise only marinating them for two hours at most. One hour on one side and one more hour on the other side. 
This chicken is really good.

Look no further, this is the best Lemon Chicken recipe out there!  Only change I made was to marinate only 4 hours and add an extra tablespoon of marinade into chicken broth.  Cook for 20 minutes then broil for 10.  Love it!

This lemon chicken was great!!  I only marinated the chicken for an hour and a half and it came out wonderful.  I did bake it for 20 minutes, and then broiled for 5 minutes and it came out nice and crispy.

I only mariated the chicken for 2 hours (because hubby isn't crazy about strong lemon taste)I myself love lemon chicken & 2 hours was just enough time to get that lemon taste. Anymore than than & it would have been to strong for us. I didn't think that the brown sugar would go good with the lemon taste but I have to tell you it was WONDERFUL!! (I told my mother & my sister also so that they can make it to.)I am definately making this again. Thank you so much for the recipe. Debbie

The lemon taste of this was very strong, BUT I love lemon so it was really good.  The juice also "cooked" the chicken so it was very tender and almost to the point of questioning if it was really cooked.  The breading became very soggy in the oven so I had to put the chicken on a baking sheet and put them under the broiler to crisp up the coating.  My fiance loved the flavor too, so next time, I will just remember to cook under the broiler for a few mins. or just leave off the the breading.

My 5 year old tried this and spit it right back out.  We thought it was just okay.  I had the opposite problem with my chicken, you could barely taste the lemon.  We tasted more brown sugar than anything else, which really didn't appeal to us too much.  It did look very pretty though!  One of the prettiest chicken dishes i've ever made!

Because I'm not a huge lemon flavor fan, I took the advice of others and only marinated for a few hours.  I was skeptical, but this recipe was very tasty-we enjoyed the mixture of lemon and sugar flavors.  I'll be making this one again.

Overall, the flavor of this dish was good.  But it was a messy dish to make and didn't turn out exactly like I think it was supposed to.  First, I marinated the meat only about an hour, and with only about a cup of lemon juice diluted with 1/2 cup of water.  It was plenty.  I can't imagine marinating it for a full day in 2 cups of full strength lemon juice!
When I fried the chicken, alot of the flour coating didn't stick to the chicken, although it was throughly browned.  I just transferred the scraps of coating from the frying pan to the baking pan for flavor.  When baking it, the brown sugar added an interesting flavor, but I would use less next time, it was too sweet.  I do think the baking made the chicken more tender.
Again, overall tasty, but needs several revisions.

This was really delicious.  I was only able to marinate a few hours, and it was still great.  I can imagine how much better it will be after marinating overnight.  The only thing is that I only had less than a cup of lemon juice for 4 breasts, and there was a lot left over. It seems to go a long way. Maybe next time not as much lemon juice, and a longer marinating time.  The meat came out so moist.  The kids even thought it was delicious and they don't eat anything.

This was great, and very easy.  The brown sugar is a delicious addition.  I will definitely try this again, but next time reduce the marinating time - it was a little too lemony!

I marinated the chicken over night, I love lemon. This was so not good at all.  I was able to use the cooked chicken in a spicy chicken soup, so it wasn't a total loss. I won't make this again.

I have a stupid question, should the baking dish be covered while in the oven?  I left it uncovered and all      the sauce burned to the dish.  The chicken was fine but I had no sauce to go with it, so I substituted marinara instead.  Thanks.

I must have done something very wrong! All I tasted was lemon... Maybe not enough brown sugar or  I let it marinate too long... :(  It was so pretty, tho!

Everyone LOVED this and I will be making this more often!  I only marinated 3 hours and the lemon was more than sufficient, I didn't used the leftover marinade though.

My breading came off in the pan, sauce never thickened. Followed the directions perfectly. Ended up having Carl's Jr. for dinner.

Great.  Great.  Great.  I was scared off by what some people said about marinating all night so I marinated it in lemon juice for about 4 hours and it was great.  I think all night would be even better.  I used one cup of lemon juice for TWICE the amount of chicken, put it all in a bowl and covered it and it was plenty of lemon juice. Also deglazed the pan with white wine after sauteeing the chicken, added stock to that and strained it.  That made a great sauce which I poured over the chicken before baking. Everything can be done in advance except pouring the sauce over the chicken.  Do that at the last minute and pop it in the over.  So good.

Made as written except for doubling the sauce. Excellent-not too lemony. Did have to increase the cooking time because my chicken breasts were so thick. Will be thrilled to make again.

This was easily one of the best chicken recipes I've ever had. Everyone raved about it and came back for seconds! I made a few small modifications: I only marinated the chicken in the lemon juice for a few hours instead of overnight, and I added a few tablespoons of melted butter to the sauce before putting the chicken in the oven.

This was really good, particularly since I had a few pounds of lemons brought to me recently. However, they were Meyer lemons and didn't impart quite the tart quality I would have liked in this dish. That said, it was still really yummy. Marinated for almost 2 hours and the chicken was extremely juicy, however, the little liquid couldn't sustain and my pan burned. Extra extra broth next time.

WONDERFUL! I also didn't marinate overnight or use the leftover marinade for the sauce. But I did use about two tablespoons of lemon juice and mixed it with the broth and brown sugar. I love lemon chicken, and since I have a lemon tree, I'll be making this recipe A LOT. Great lemon flavor and tasty sauce. I served it with asparagus risotto and it was a fabulous meal. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I tried this because so many people raved about it. I only marinated for two hours hoping that would tame the strong lemon taste other reviewers mentioned but to no avail. We ended up ordering in. Sorry!

Brilliant! One of the best Lemon Chickens I've ever had, I only marinated for 2 hours turning after one but it seemed just right. I also added the liquid before sprinkling with the sugar and I think this helped keep the skin sweet. It's now one of my favorites. Thanks.

Easy and super tasty tastebud zapper...
Made it with chicken fillets instead of the breast halves and was more than delighted with the result. 
Did find the 'sauce' stayed like a juice and not thick at all but I made plenty of rice which more than happily soaked it all up.

I used lemon concentrate. Marinated only for 4hrs. I used seasoned box flour. I omitted the lemon slices and squeezed fresh lemon juice over top of chicken before baking the last 10 minutes i broiled. Family loved it!

Excellent and pretty easy too. I sliced the chicken into strips and marinated in ~1/2 c. lemon juice for 4 hrs, and that produced a very mellow flavor, that blended well with the brown sugar. I took the others advice about broiling: the perfect combo for my chicken was 20 min bake/10 min broil. Great with mashed potatoes and primavera veggies!

I have a ton of chicken recipes and I will have to admit that...this one is at the top of my list. It is truly wonderful. I made it a few weeks ago and I will be making it again this week for a dinner party along with the honey roasted potatos that I got from this web site. The two together will be an incredible combination. Thank you for another fantastic recipe.

I made this last night for dinner and it was delicious. I marinated this over nite and I didn't find the lemon to be overpowering. I guess it is just personal preference. The only thing that I think I would improve upon is the texture of the coating on the chicken. I love the crunchy coating you get in restaurants on this dish, but am trying to keep fat and calories down. I will have to play with this and see if I can add more "crunch" to the chicken.

I only had one cup of lemon juice and a couple of hours to marinate, but it still tasted good.  I served this with Carrot Rice from this website. Great combo.  This chicken had a lot of flavor.

WAY too much lemon flavor!  The marinading overnight is just far too long...I think an hour or two would be plenty.  Or perhaps, just increase the lemon juice content in the sauce slighty and skip the marinade entirely.  The sauce is delicious and it is a shame that the chicken itself was ruined.  (It tasted if I had baked lemons!) Might try again, but with MAJOR changes.

I marinated this for about 8 hours and it was too lemony. Also, after baking, the flour coating became soggy. Maybe I didn't fry it long enough, but it was browned all over. Probably wouldn't make again.

I absolutely loved this.  It was phenomenal.  Easy to make for the most part.  Two cups of freshly squeezed lemon juice is a lot of lemons and I didn't have that many.  So I used what I had and used bottled juice for the remainder.  It turned out fine.  I also added more marinade than just 2 tbsp- maybe about 6 tbsp.  So glad I did.  Hubby wished there was more of the sauce.  My picky Kids didn't care for it too much but I don't care.  Will definitely make it again and they can have crackers and cheese.  lol.  Oh and I also only marinated if for a few hours.

I have been looking for a lemon chicken recipe that was similar to a local deli that I loved. This recipe hit it right on! Only thing I did different was use thin chicken breast, added a couple splashes of Worcester sauce and mixed the brown sugar with broth.  Was perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this chicken up until the finished product. felt the brown sugar ruined it. will make again, just no brown sugar as it took over the lemon flavor.

I used frozen chicken breasts and let them thaw in a bag of lemon juice for a few hours.  I made 2 cups of the sauce and I mixed the brown sugar in it "to taste". I also added some cornstarch and only drizzled a small amount of the sauce over the chicken before baking. The rest I thickened on the stove. Was good with brown rice. The extra sauce was really yummy. I found the chicken was pretty "tangy" from soaking while it thawed, but my husband thought it was fine. I'll probably make it again. Easy to make!

The chicken was way too lemony.  Would marinade it for only a few hours instead.

I marinated for about 2 hrs, the breading becomes soggy when you bake it.  I broiled it and made extra sauce to go with it.  Overall just okay.

I have been using Allrecipes for years but have never written a review. I marinated the chicken for 8 hours and it was WAY TOO STRONG - it tasted like I was eating a raw lemon, but I was biting into a chicken breast.  All 5 of us in my family hated it.  I even tried to make a broth-based sauce to balance out the tang, but the tangy taste was in the chicken itself and irreversable.  You have to really love lemons to want to eat this!

I enjoyed this recipe, it was great for something different. However, i didnt have parsley so i did feel as though it was missing something. I was also thinking Dill and maybe garlic would have added and mellowed out the very tangy strong lemon flavour.

Followed other advice and marinated while frozen only a few hours.  It was still far too lemony, but if reduced I am sure it will be a hit.  Fried for about 5 minutes on each side and it did take all of 30 minutes to bake.  Next time I will cut back on lemon and dilute with some water.

I thought this was good, but I found the lemon flavor of this to be a bit too strong. I only marinated the chicken for about 2 hours. The flavor was good, the chicken was tender, and the texture was really nice. Just a bit too lemony for me.

This recipe was great! I also did not marinate over night. I frozen chicken breasts for about 3 hours and they thawed quickly. The lemon flavor was just right for us so I think soaking overnight would be too strong. I would definitely make this again.

This recipe was good but VERY VERY lemon-y. I'll make it again but definitely cut the marinade time in half at least and use more brown sugar. Otherwise, it was very good and pretty easy to make. Very tender, which was great. I baked it for 30 min so it would brown more. Served with brown rice and green beans, great family meal.

Boy..was I disappointed.  Can't quite put my finger on it but we love lemon recipes around here and this just didn't cut it.  Sorry.  One main complaint was not enough sauce.  I'll stick to my own recipe that is prepared almost exactly the same way but uses frozen lemonade concentrate and an equal amout of water as the marinade and sauce.

Loved it.  The chicken is nice and tender and the perfect lemony-ness for us!  I used fresh lemon juice rather than reserving the marinade.  Other than that - no changes.  Definitely a keeper! (Update - I have made this for several years now and have found that chicken tenders are my favorite choice of meat. Still one of our favorites!)
