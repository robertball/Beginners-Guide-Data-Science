We just prepared this dish for New Year's Eve.  We followed the recipe as stated except used chicken breasts.  It was DELICIOUS!  I figured it would be too sweet, but it was not at all, we will certainly cook this again.  Thanks!!

I made this in the crock-pot using boneless skinless thighs, thus skipped the oil and browning. I made it the first time with all the ingredients and my only thought of change for the second time was to reduce the cumin by about 1/2. We truly ate it up...love this recipe, but have found it very hard to search for here on allrecipes. So, save it to your recipe box, now (Big smile)! I'd give it more stars if I could! Don't skip the ingredients, if you have them, use them. And if it's something you're not sure you'd like, try reducing a little of that ingredient. These flavors meld together quite nicely. It's not at all too sweet. Very flavorful!

I thought this recipe was great! I made just a few changes. I used half of the honey called for(in hindsight I should've either used all of it or halved the cinnamon ), I  used chicken breasts instead of legs, and I omitted the raisins and the saffron. 
Hubby loved it, I loved it, I will denfinately make this again!

I was skeptical about the mix of spices, honey, and tomatoes in this dish.  But it was such a crowd pleaser!  There we no leftovers.  I did not use saffron and it turned out just fine.

thought it was very good. Easy to prepare and not 'weird' - I'm feeding a 2 1/2 year old!
I only added half of the honey and it was still very good.

This was very easy to make and quite tasty.  Next time I will make it with boneless chicken.

This recipe was delicious and so easy! I had all ingredients on hand and didn't change a thing. Served the tagine over "Fruity Couscous Salad" (from this website), and the flavor combination was out of this world! Had no problems re-heating and got to enjoy the meal again the next day. This is a definite keeper in my recipe box.

I made this with the saffron and it was amazing!  I poured over cous cous and rice and it was great both ways!  A wonderful distinct flavor!

Great recipe! I didn't use saffron this time because I didn't have any but I will next time. Using bone-in tights really adds to the rich flavours.

I thought this was really good; the combination of spices is very interesting.  My kids were pretty neutral about it, and my husband wouldn't eat it.  Needless to say that I won't be making this again.

I didn't change the recipe, but didn't really care for the outcome either. I won't make it again, it just seemed wrong, as if it needed something else but I have no idea what to add to make it taste better.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I did not add the honey because I dont' like meat things to be sweet.  A nice mix of spices and reheats well.

This recipe wasn't bad. I only added 2 Tb. of honey, but I think removing it completely would help. I also used boneless chicken breasts. The saffron was great in it, I personally wouldn't skip it. But, there just seems to be something missing in the recipe that I can't put my finger on. Still good though.

good stuff.  i like my chicken simmer for over an hour on super low heat (since my husband was running late)...but it ended up being really good that way.
