I tried this recipe for company - 4 adults and 2 children.  The children ate but were a bit slow with praise.  The adults loved it.  Only problem with this is that there's WAY too much rosemary.  Also, there must be a misprint, because there's NO WAY you can make this with 8 cups of water.  My Dutch oven only allowed me to put in 3 and that was more than enough.

To compensate for the overwhelming flavor of rosemary - because that's all we could taste - we added more crushed tomatoes and beef broth.  Next time I made it I will use only a taste of rosemary.

But it was simple and very flavorful. Thanks.

Way too much water to be called a stew, so I called it beef soup and the family loved it.  I  decreased the rosemary and added other spices my family likes.  If you want a stew, I'd only add water to cover the meat and veggies and I'd add some flour or cornstarch, if needed, a half-hour before serving.  This is a keeper because it's so easy and the meat is so tender.

Excellent Stew!  I followed the other recommendations and used less rosemary, way less, only 1/2 teaspoon.  I also coated the stew meat in flour and browned in 1/4 cup of butter.  I'll make this again.

I was a bit wary about making this stew, but the other reviews made me feel otherwise.  I adjusted the rosemary to 1 tablespoon and the flavor was still overwhelming.  The meat was not as tender as it would be in a crockpot and all in all it lacked flavor.  My boyfriend loves to eat and he didn't finish his bowl.  I will never make this again.

Delicous!  Finally found stew recipe my husband likes.  Spices are outstanding so can probably play with the vegetables.  I just make half the recipe.  It is sooo easy - dump ingredients into a pot, put the cover on, and come back in 6 hours.  My kind of cooking.  Thank you Jim.

The best stew I've made yet. I used water to cover the veggies and added cornstarch at the end. Next time I'm definitely going to substitute barley for the potatoes.

We really enjoyed this one.  We did decrease the rosemary a lot--by 75%.

The recipe was wonderful.  I would probably cut it in half the next time.  This time I will freeze it for later.  Also, I would use about half the liquid unless you like a lot of liquid which I thickened with Flour/water.  Served with cheesy biscuits.  Yummy!

Very tasty stew. Cooking in oven not only made the meat tender, it made the house smell good. Easy recipe adaptable to any veges. Added more garlic to our taste and reduced rosemary.

I did it in the crock pot. Tastes great! I used 3 cups of water. High for five hours. Next time I think I'll add hot sauce!
