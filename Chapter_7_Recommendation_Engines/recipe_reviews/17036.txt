I love this recipe; it's a hearty, stick-to-your-ribs breakfast. The following are a couple tips for the best pancakes. Don't thin the batter with more milk. This washes out the pumpkin flavor. Instead, the batter should be portioned out with a 1/4 c. measure onto a moderately hot griddle; then the batter should be spread out slightly using a spoon or a small spatula. This creates the fluffy texture while keeping them hearty. Second, I used a food processor to mix up the wet ingredients. This makes a smoother batter as it breaks down the fiberous pumpkin. The result is a lighter pancake with a more pronounced pumpkin flavor. Third, I used a fresh, good quality pumpkin pie spice rather than measuring out the individual spices; this is an easier preparation, and the flavors were fresher  (I get my pumpkin pie spice from a local spice shop that grinds and mixes it weekly for the best quality). Fourth, I got the best results either using whole milk or evaporated milk. Low-fat and fat free milk products just left the flavor dull.

We ate Pumpkin pancakes at the restaurant, IHOP, last winter.  I have searched for recipes to try and duplicate the pancakes...This recipe took the first place ribbon!  Thank you so much!   It was very good and my family enjoyed them very much!

With a little tweeking, this recipe is fantastic.  I've been modifying this recipe for quite some time to perfect it.  I thought the pumpkin taste was too weak originally, and it lacked a true "pumpkin recipe flavor" without nutmeg.  Also, the cinnamon flavor was not noticeable.  Here are my suggestions:

1.  Add 1 1/3 cups pumpkin
2.  Add 1 Tbsp Cinnamon
3.  Add 1/2 tsp nutmeg
4.  Delete the allspice, vinegar and ginger

Here are my ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
Â½ teaspoon nutmeg	1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/3 cups pumpkin puree
1 egg
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

It makes a nice dense pumpkiny flavor pancake that is fantastic with any decent syrup.  I've made it several times and get rave reviews always.

As an old pancake/waffle baker I was eager to try this recipe.  I followed many suggestions in the reviews (2 eggs, 1 cup whole wheat PASTRY flour) and tweaked it even further.  My daughter had just eaten at a trendy breakfast cafe in Ashland, Oregon and claimed these were even better...lighter, etc.  Extra suggestions...add fresh nutmeg (1/2 t.), ground cloves (1 t.) increase cinnamon to 1 TABLESPOON and ground ginger to 2 teaspoons, brown sugar to 4 Tablespoons, ditto oil.  Also increase leavening to 2 TABLESPOONS ( I use only Rumford's and NO baking soda at all).  Finally, mix w. 1 plus cup of milk, let stand to absorb the dries and then add MORE milk to get that perfect pancake batter conistency.  Works well as waffles, also.

These pancakes are OUT OF THIS WORLD! They're moist and delicious!
As always, I used REAL pumpkin instead of the canned stuff (I think it makes
a HUGE difference and real pumpkins are so easy to cook--I just cut them in 
half, scoop out the insides, and then put them face down on a baking sheet at
425 degrees for about an hour. After they cool, the skins come off very easily. 
Then take the pumpkin and mash it with a potato masher. Just make sure that
you use the right kind of pumpkins--sweet ones like New England or Baby Pam.
The big ones at the supermarket will not work).
Then I put butter REAL maple syrup on the pancakes, but they're so good, you 
could almost eat them plain! 5 stars!

I used an electric skillet on 300 degrees...if you follow the recipe completely your pancakes will come out great.  Adding water or more milk takes away from the flavor.  Once you place the batter on the skillet, just spread it out a little with the back of a spoon...that will help thin the pancakes out.  Great recipe for picky eaters!!

AWESOME!!!  I start by making the recipe just as it calls to be made so that when I rate a recipe those who read the review know what the recipe might be like from my perspective if you make it LIKE THE RECIPE SAYS!!!  I know this might be a novel idea but please give it a try!!!!  I did have to add additional liquid as it was a bit too thick.  When I see a recipe calling for milk and vinegar, these two mixed together give you an emergency substitute for buttermilk.  Next time I will go ahead a use buttermilk!!!   To the person who used the pancake mix - do not rate recipes like this if you are not going to follow the recipe as you did not make this recipe at all!

My 2 year old has requested these pancakes on several occassions. For fluffier pancakes I add an extra egg. Most assuredly worth trying!

INCREDIBLE! I like making my own pumpkin puree and this is a great way to use what's left over if the sugar (pie) pumpkin produces more than the 2 cups needed for pies and breads. I didn't have a whole cup of pumpkin so I just scaled the recipe down with great results. I added a bit of milk to the batter to make it easier to pour. TIP: The pancakes will be lighter if you let the batter sit 5 minutes or so before cooking -- that gives the baking powder time to react and start making air bubbles. Absolutely the best pumpkin pancakes ever!

Excellent collection of spices in a slighty sweetened pancake. I needed to add about a 1/4 more of milk to get the pancakes thinner and I mixed the dry ingredients before the wet ones because I was worried the vinegar might curdle the milk. This is a keeper. I'll be doing some experimenting to add some whole grain texture to the recipe. Cooks magazine did a multi-grain pancake making a "flour" out of meusli.
I love IHOP pumpkin pancakes and these are just as good. The recipe is easy and the house smells good cooking them.

I used whole wheat flour, Splenda brown sugar blend, 1 1/2 teaspoons homemade pumpkin pie spice, and lowfat buttermilk. I used my 1/4 measuring cup to measure out even pancakes so they turned out kind of small because they didn't spread much but they're light and fluffy. My family dug them. I like that they use only a touch of sugar so you really get the pumpkin flavor. This is a great pancake! NOTE: I think next time, I might add a 1/4 cup of chopped pecans.

followed this recipe, except for slightly upping the cinnamon and ginger, and added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar for personal preferences.  OUTSTANDING!  I portion it out with a large ice cream scooper- it made 15 pancakes.  Perfect with a bit of maple syrup, and my kids like to put chocolate chips on top instead.  I've tried a lot of pumpkin pancakes and they are either too heavy, mushy, or they don't have enough flavor.  These are light and fluffy with great texture and flavor... make them NOW!  :)

What a great fall recipe!  These would make a great Turkey Day b-fast.  I made a few changes:  I don't like ginger and didn't have AllSpice, so I doubled the cinnamon and added a dash of Nutmeg (next time, I'll do just straight cin, no nutmeg).  I used Splenda brown sugar blend and whole wheat flour.  I also added an extra slash of milk because the batter looked really really thick.  I used canned pumpkin.  I thought these had a delightfully nice slightly stronger than subtle pumpkin flavor.  I served w/"Cinnamon Cream Syrup" from here (per prior reviews) and it was a pancake/syrup match made in heaven.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My family loves this recipe!  I substitute 1 C quick cooking oats & 1 C cream of wheat for the flour.  Also, 1/4 C eggbeaters in place of the egg and 2 T applesauce in place of the oil to make this recipe weight watcher (core plan) friendly.  I usually double the recipe and keep it refrigerated so that we can have pancakes on school days without going through too much hassle in the morning! Yummy!

Amazing, love the texture of the batter, and of course the pancake! Used evaporated milk for the milk, 2 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice to replace all of the separate spices, and then added about a tsp. of vanilla. Oh and, not that it needs it, but I used half cake flour and half all purpose flour just because I'm trying to get rid of the cake flour. I'm sure it would be just as amazing using 100% all-purpose flour. Fabulous recipe!

These pancakes were awesome!! Only change I made was to substitute whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour, and add a dash more milk. The key for me was to measure out the 1/4 cup servings, pour them into the hot skillet, and then use the side of the measuring cup to gently spread the batter out. Then, after they cooked a bit on one side, I flipped them over and gently pressed on them with the back of a spatula to flatten them a bit more and ensure that they cooked through. They came out terrific and I topped them with a bit of sugar-free syrup, butter spread, and chopped pecans. Yummy!!

I made this pancake recipe exactly as it was posted and I was NOT impressed. The batter was way too thick. It wouldn't spread out evenly (even with an offset spatula as was recommended in other reviews) so they cooked unevenly. I made half as is and then thinned out the batter with a bit more milk for the second half. While the second batch cooked better I found both batches to be spongey, like chewing a kitchen sponge, and while it tasted like pumpkin it could have used a touch more sugar as the bites I had that were light on syrup were bland.   I am a very experienced cook having been a sous chef in a restaurant and I know how to cook pancakes. I'll try this recipe again with some major adjustments but the original recipe is mediocre at best.

Excellent! Of course I tweeked it as follows: I used stoneground whole wheat flour, doubled the brown sugar, added 2T of molasses, increased the spices by 50%, increased the pumpkin by 50% and used buttermilk in place of milk and vinegar. My husband (who hates it when I try to "healthy up" a recipe) couldn't get enough of these! He and my daughter were eating them PLAIN after eating several w/ syrup and butter. They said over and over "these are delicious" and the yums and moans of delight were almost too much! A

I made these 10/20/2007.  Very yummy, everyone loved these.  Watch them closely on the griddle because they do burn easily.  I used 1 cup of pastry wheat flour in place of 1 cup of the white flour and I replaced 3 T of the white flour with milled flax seed.  I also made the hot cider syrup recipe from another pumpkin pancake recipe on this site and that was super simple and went well with these.  I also used the remaining pumpkin from the 15 oz. can I used and mixed it with 1 to 1-1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt and 1/4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice for a pumpkin yogurt to dollop of top of these.

Very tasty pancakes! I used fresh buttermilk in place of both the milk and vinegar. Also I had a little more than 2/3 cups of pumpkin (1 cup) and I added that into the mix. I added about 1 teaspoon of white sugar to the batter. The batter came together nice and thick. I scooped Â¼ cup of batter onto the griddle and they puffed up nicely while cooking on the grill. The aroma of pumpkin quickly filled up my house while the pancakes cooked. I made 11 medium size pancakes which was more than enough for the next two days. It was a filling, hearty and tasty breakfast. The pancake itself was fluffy and moist and I could taste a hint of pumpkin. This is a nice blend of spices in a âslightly sweetâ pancake. My family said that the pancakes tasted like âpumpkin pie.â Next time I may add Â½ tsp. of pumpkin spice to the mix. This is a nice change to plain pancakes especially for fall season.

Delicious!!  Made them as is except I added a teaspoon of vanilla and about 1/4 cup more pumpkin because some of the reviews said they didn't taste much pumpkin.

I made these pancakes for a group of children at church.  They devoured them!  The aroma had everyone in the halls wondering what delicious dish was being prepared.

This was a really good recipe.  I followed the recipe almost exact, the only thing I modified was the flour.  Instead of 2 cups white flour, I used 1 cup white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat, 1/4 cup minute oats, 1/4 cup wheat bran, and about a tbsp of ground flax seeds.  It makes for a really thick batter, but I just made sure to spread it out on the griddle instead of thinning it out with extra milk.  The only thing I wasn't too sure about was the ginger, as you can feel the heat from it.  I haven't decided whether I like that aspect yet or not.  I may just decrease the amount I use in the future, but overall, this was a really tasty recipe.  Thank you! :)

After seeing the rating, I thought I'd give a a try & I did not care for this recipe. The batter is tasteless & didn't cook all the way through unless I overcooked it & almost burned the outside. I followed the recipe exact. What a waste of my ingredients.

This is a hearty savory pumpkin pancake recipe. It's not too sweet, and the pumpkin flavor comes through. I put in more cinnamon, but that's a personal preference. A few drops of vanilla and little fresh grated nutmeg added some depth. I did not use allspice as I don't like it, and used half the ginger specified as I don't like a strong ginger flavor.  Hints: Don't overmix! Use a large spoon or spatula to fold the dry and wet together til they are JUST mixed. I took the suggestion of dissolving the brown sugar in with the other liquid ingredients.  Let the batter sit for ~15 minutes before cooking, the vinegar/baking soda/powder need to start working.  The batter IS thick, just spread out on the griddle with a spoon. I only used medium heat, anything higher would have burned my pancakes before they were cooked through.  This is a keeper recipe :)

These were pretty tastey as is. I made a batch according to the recipe as written, and my husband and I both agreed that they were a bit on the dry side. Also the spices were lovely, but larger measurements are needed. I tried this recipe again, only this time I used 1&1/2 cups of pumpkin, doubled the cinnamon and ginger, and bumped up the brown sugar to 1/3 cup. Much tastier! This would bring this recipe up to 5 stars in our opinion. One tip, too, if you are using brown sugar, whisk it into your wet ingredients to dissolve it. Mixing it into the dry results in lumps, and if you try to mix them out once the wet and dry are incorporated, you will way over mix the batter. I agree w/ another reviewer, don't add anymore liquid to this recipe. Just spread the batter about with the back of the ladle, or whatever you are using. Adding more milk will dilute the pumpkin and spice flavor. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were wonderful - no changes in the ingredients necessary. In the method I took a shortcut by putting all ingredients except for the flour and baking powder into a food processor and blitzed it for 30 seconds. Then I added the flour and baking powder and blitzed for about 20 sec's. - Now they were ready to fry. Quick easy and very tasty! My family loved it. Thanks for posting.

Unfortunately we were very underwhelmed by these pancakes.  My family loves pretty loves anything pumpkin, but these had little flavor and poor texture.  They were sort of chewy/gooey, even though cooked thoroughly.  I added a little vanilla for extra flavor, but they still fell short.  Sorry to say I won't me making these again.

These pancakes are wonderful!  I like to try a recipe as printed first.  This time I doubled the recipe to use the full can of pumpkin...and unlike some recipes this made a HUGE amount.  The really cool thing is that the left-overs keep wonderfully.  Toss them into the toaster on a darker setting, and they are as good as the first time around.  My 2YO says "I love pumpkin pancakes, Daddy!"  and anything that gets a stamp of approval from a 2YO, well that says something.  I'm anxious to try this again with some of the mods...but over all fantastic recipe, will definitely make again.  I love the flavors that go with pumpkin and this will be a family favorite for a LONG time!  Enjoy!

I've made these twice: Once with the recipe as written and once with a couple adjustments. They turned out delicious both times. I love them and will make them again and again. For the adjustments, I added two tablespoons of molasses to the wet ingredients and I increased the cinnamon in the dry ingredients. The result was a slightly sweeter, spicier pancake. Some people have said they couldn't get the pancakes to set. Spreading them with the back of a spoon to thin them out helped. Plus, these pancakes are very moist and cake-like, so they tend to be less dry in the middle than a traditional pancake.

Oh these are sooo good.  Followed the recipe exactly as written and at first I thought the batter was too thick (especially after the "test" pancake looked done, but was still raw in the middle), but lowering the heat on the griddle solved that.  The result -- perfectly fluffy pancakes.  Tried some batter in a Belgian waffle iron (sprinkled the raw batter with chopped pecans) and the waffles came out even better.  Served with Honey Butter (also on this site).  Thanks for a wonderful breakfast treat... or is it dessert??

This recipe made very light, fluffy and delicious pancakes.  I did have to add about 1/2 cup more milk because the batter was too thick.  However, they were more like gingerbread than pumpkin flavored so I think I'll tweak the spices and add more pumpkin next time I try the recipe.

Made them as written, except for two things. I used whole wheat flour and I doubled everything so we could have leftovers in the freezer. I used pumpkin puree I made myself. 

The pumpkin flavor is mild, but it goes very well with maple syrup. Next time I might go heavier on the spices, as they were quite mild also and I like them punchy. 

Next time I might also put the brown sugar in with the wet ingredients, as it's a pain to chase the lumps out with a fork when it's in the dry stuff. 

The batter is a 'dry' batter, not runny like a lot of people are used to. This is rather like a muffin batter, and spreading it around with the disher is an excellent technique. I make my pancakes very small--silver dollar style--so they will be easier to handle on my griddle.

DELICIOUS!  I followed the recipe except I exchanged BUTTERMILK for the "sour milk" the recipe was asking for (Sour milk combines vinegar and milk).  I made the batter the NIGHT BEFORE and simply pulled it out of the fridge the next morning and scooped it out.  The batter was thick, but the pancakes were still mighty fine!  :D

These were amazing! Subtle pumpkin flavor and the spices were not overwhelming. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to let the batter sit for a few minutes to allow the baking soda to react. The texture of these pancakes were perfect! These were so good, I ate them plain! My boyfriend topped them with maple syrup & loved them too. I will be doubling the recipe and making this for family this week. Thanks!

I took the advice of many of the women and pureed the pumpkin in a food processor for a better consistency. Instead of 1 cup, I used 1.5 cups of pumpkin puree. My husband and I also like the pancakes with more flavor so we increased the allspice and cinnamon from 1 teaspoon to 1.5 teaspoons. I added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin spice and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. We thought the original recipe was good but not enough flavor. Use a spoon to thin out the mixture once on the griddle, don't add more milk or eggs as it will take away from the flavor. We made this for my husband's office last year and it was such a big hit we actually ran out. I have made it several times at home and will be making it again for his office next week. This is a wonderful recipe.

I may have done something wrong because mine looked nothing like the picture and were WAY too thick. I tried adding milk after having mixed them up and discovering they were too thick but they were still too thick. I will not try this one again. The flavor was okay.

Absolutely, positively the best pancakes that I have ever had...no kidding, no exaggerating!!!!!  Unbelievably delicious.  Only thing I did different is I added a few shakes of pumpkin-pie spice to the mix.  The consistency was not too thick, just even out with a ladel when you pour onto griddle. I served with butter-flavored syrup (don't care for maple syrup), whipped cream and toasted pecans...a must with these pancakes.  YUM!!!!!!!!!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I am very happy to say this recipe taste is perfect, absolutely perfect- and this comes from a picky pancake perfectionist.  The batter, however, is too thick.  Thin it out with around 1 C more milk at least.  Even so- there are none left in the house tonight and it's a big batch, too.  These make a great Fall dinner pancake.  Good luck and happy eating!

I made these for breakfast for my 2 kids and myself.  We really like pumpkin and so these were  right up our alley.  To make them a little more healthy, I used 1 cup regular flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  I didn't have the ginger, so I left that out.  My batter was really thick, so I thinned it out with a little more milk and added a bit more sugar than called for.  I have a 15 month old and I haven't introduced her to syrup yet.  This is a great way to get extra fiber and vitamin A.  Thanks Ruth.

Made this twice and it turned out really amazing both times. I followed usual pancake prep methods (let vinegar sit in milk 5 mins, stir minimally, let sit, flip once) and was very pleased. They are very rich so one batch as listed fed 4 hungry adults and 1 toddler.

I am bit unusual since I made these on a hot May morning in Texas instead of a cool fall day. But I think that are great anytime of the year.  Very light and flavorful.  The only changes I made were to use two eggs instead of one and I added some vanilla extract.  And don't be afraid to add the vinegar to the milk.  Vinegar added to milk is called soured milk which is used as buttermilk substitute in recipes.  Make these today.  They are fabulous.

So, so incredibly good. First time making Pumpkin Pancakes & first time eating pumpkin pancakes. I subbed lemon juice for vinegar & honey for brown sugar. I didn't have allspice so didn't bother with it. I added in ginger, cinnamon & nutmeg. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe.

2/22/11 Thank you Ruth this was delicious.  The only changes I made were to substitute the 2 c of all purpose flour with 1 1/2 c all-purpose flour and 1/2 c whole wheat pastry flour.  I might try using apple sauce instead of the vegetable oil next time too.  Thank you!
11/10/15  We are still using your recipe.  Today, we substituted roasted beets for the pureed pumpkin.  We added an extra egg for more body.  Light, fluffy, delicious!!!  Thank you again Ruth

The recipe is perfect as is. The batter is a little thick so i measure out 1/4 cup for each pancake and spread the batter out with a fork on the griddle. An extra step, but totally worth it!

WOW!!! Nicely spiced vehicles for your maple syrup. This recipe works equally well with cooked, pureed sweet potato. I nuke them for 4 minutes, scoop out the flesh and mash it well before incorporating. Also, I use buttermilk in place of the milk and vinegar. I find that I end up using the same measure of buttermilk as of flour, otherwise the batter is too thick and the pancakes won't cook well in the centers. It's easy to tinker with the spices to suit your taste. I like to add a dash of cloves as well as those in the recipe, plus I double the cinnamon and ginger. These puff up nicely and come out tender and oh-so-tasty!

This was AWFUL!!!  Batter was too thick and too bland.  The pancake texture was extreme mush and all I could taste was raw pumpkin.  There wasn't any fragrant aroma of spices and no amount of maple syrup could make up for the taste.  Waste of my time and money.

these are great--replaced the oil with 1/2 cup of applesauce and added another egg.  No syrup needed these were so light and fluffy!

These pancakes are fantastic!! I have 3 fussy girls and 2 will eat-anything-in-sight boys and everyone loves these pumpkin pancakes. I have to double the recipe to make sure everyone gets enough. The only thing I do differently is omit the allspice, increase the cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons and I add a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. This is a keeper for sure!

These were simply awful.  All those that rave about the recipe recommend all kinds of tweaking.  Then the original should be scrapped.  I made it as written and the pancakes would not cook in the middle. The were heavy and tasteless.  I am a experienced cook, not a novice, and had been anxious to try pumpkin in my pancakes.  This is not a good recipe.  4 1/2 stars....not accurate.  I generally trust the star rating on allrecipes.  This one is way off.

I usually try to find something redeeming about any recipe or try to fix it in a way I'll enjoy but after 2 batches done in 2 different ways, they will never make it into my recipe box.

First off my biggest annoyance was the fact they did NOT cook in the middle and they would not flip for anything. The batter gunked up 2 spatulas and I kept having to rinse them off just to try and turn the pancakes. It was completely a waste of time trying.

Second, the vinegar the first time? Why? It made them taste so acidicy and there was nothing I could do to save the flavor. I added extra sugar, more flour, vanilla and nothing worked. The 2nd time I didn't use vinegar and it still tasted sour, just not as...bubbly. 

Although the pumpkin in the batter is what is making the pancakes doughy in the middle, it could be fixed but I don't have the patience or the ingredients to waste on this recipe. It was a total flunk in my book. I won't ever use this recipe again.

These are wonderful! I doubled the recipe right off the bat so that I could stock the freezer, and it made about 40 pancakes using a 1/4 cup scoop. Also, to make it healthier, I used skim milk, applesauce in place of the oil, and used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose. Oh, and since it didn't specify the type of vinegar I used apple cider vinegar. Delicious! Thank you for sharing!

Nice flavor and texture to these pancakes. I lowered cholesterol by using 2 egg whites instead of 1 egg. Chocolate chips sprinkled on the pancakes before flipping added a yummy flavor...of course. I'm sure these will freeze nicely and can be reheated in the microwave or toaster. Enjoy!

We have made this many times.  Usally using buttermilk and substituting in oats for some of the flour.  Also use butter instead of oil.

This is a great recipe, made it for overnight guests. I didn't have allspice, so doubled the cinnamon. Thinned it out with milk too. For a great syrup that compliments this better than maple... Butter Sauce--1 c. evaporated milk, 1 c. margarine, 2 c. sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla. Heat in saucepan, do not boil. Rave reviews! Top with toasted pecans.

Mmmmm. We liked these.  Hubby thought they tasted healther than the other pancakes I've been making.  I made them for hubby and myself on a rainy morning and it was very hearty and delicious.  Used 1/4 cup whole wheat and the rest white flour.  Added 1 tsp pumpkin spice in addition to the spices called for. Also added 1 tsp vanilla per hubby's request.  Used most of the can of pumpkin puree and used the rest as topping like applesauce.  (Mixed with butter and cinnamon). Poured butter and maple syrup on the pancakes -- we each had three pancakes and I froze the rest -- delicious and a nice change!

This is a stick to your ribs kind of pancake. I was looking for something seasonal that my son would eat and this is perfect. I added a little extra milk for our personel preference. But over all a great reciepe I even made extra to freeze and reheat on busy mornings.

These are the best pumpkin pancakes I've ever had!  Fluffy and light, and not too much spice.  I make them silver dollar-sized, and after breakfast we snack on them all day- they really don't even need syrup.  I made a few tiny adjustments-
add the vinegar to the milk and set aside for a minute to sour 
left out the allspice (don't like it)
increased the cinnamon and brown sugar a touch

I'm eating these pancakes as we speak and they're delicious! The only change I made was to use coconut milk instead of regular milk (I don't do dairy) and the rest was the same! They're so fluffy and they taste just like fall. Helpful hint: DO NOT skimp on the sugar. I tried to and tasted the batter and almost spit it out. After adding the sugar it was quite yummy :)

My family loved the pancakes. I substituted 1/2 whole wheat flour for 1/2cup of flour. These are great with apple juice thickened with cornstarch instead of syrup. Will definitely make again. Left overs freeze well.

WOW :) These were wonderful! Light and fluffy. Topped them with a maple/cream cheese glaze that I made with some leftover cinnamon roll frosting. Hubby and my picky boys all enjoyed and asked for them again! Will deff make again. Hopefully with fresh roasted pumpkin instead of canned. Can't wait till next time. Photo added :) BTW, my 11y/o says not 5 but 10 stars!

These were amazing!  Hearty, delicious, and perfect just as written!  The ONLY thing I did differently was add flaxseed because I add that to everything I can.

These don't taste like anything.

Update: I had some leftover pumpkin puree so decided to try them again. Halved the recipe, kept the pumpkin puree at 1 cup and doubled the spices, added nutmeg, and cloves. Has the faintest taste of of the spices, no pumpkin taste, and mostly tastes like nothing still. Sorry, can't even give it 2 stars still.

I did thin the batter down after the first few were cooked and they cooked better! I used soy milk as my daughter has a milk allergy and it worked well.

I really liked these, I used a little extra pumpkin and it came out a little thick so I will use the recommended amount next time and will try using whole milk.

These were scrumptious!  Very hearty and filling.  The whole family loved them.    The one change I made was I substituted 1/2 of the flour with oats to give it a little more fiber and substance.    Served with buttermilk syrup and they disappeared as quickly as I could make them.

These were the fluffiest, most satisfying pancakes. They weren't terribly sweet, which I really like. They tasted like a gingerbread cookie in a pancake. I served mine with roasted pecans, dried cranberries, and maple syrup, but I was also thinking that adding chocolate chips would be just wonderful.

A new family favorite! I've made these twice now and both times received rave reviews even from the pickiest eaters. Everyone is looking forward to the next time they are made.  The good thing about them is that they are hearty and my boys are full with fewer pancakes. Flavors are subtle and with the apple cider syrup from another recipe outstanding all around.

These turned out yummy with a little tweaking. I didn't think they were quite sweet enough so I added another tablespoon of brown sugar. I did add just a little nutmeg, but I love nutmeg. I also thought that this was very thick as is, and wasn't a good pancake batter. It wouldn't spread. So, I added maybe 1/4 cup milk. I don't think it hurt the flavor at all and made it much easier to work with. They were so light and soft and fluffy, and perfect with butter and syrup served with a side of bacon. The only thin I would have done differently is, I would have liked a little vanilla in it, but I seem to have misplaced mine.

Incredible! The pumpkin flavor is just right (not too strong, not too mild). But to make this even easier, I just used the canned pumpkin PIE puree. It already has all these seasonings in it. I didn't need to add anything extra except for the brown sugar and salt (in other words, I was able to omit the allspice, cinnamon, and ginger). And I think I was careful about the sugar, because the pumpkin pie puree is sweeter than just the plain pumpkin puree. Your choice. Whatever you do, these are awesome and totally appropriate for the season, but yummy any time of year!

These pancakes were very good but a bit too thick.  Even when trying to spread the mixture out on the pan, it wasnt able to spread out.  This gave us thick, dense pancakes.  They were good and very filling but I will thin it out a bit next time.    Also the pumpkin wasnt as dominant as I hoped.  I will add more pumpkin and decrease the oil to 1Tbs to compensate.    I will also sub half wheat flour to make it a bit healthier...

Has a very slight pumpkin taste.  My pankcake turned out very thick and sticky.  I substitute milk for buttermilk because didn't have any milk on hand.  I wonder if that made it not so great.

These were deeeeelicious!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, with the exception of subbing in buttermilk for the regular milk and then only adding one Tbsp. of apple cider vinegar.  I kept the spices the same as well as the pumpkin.  These pancakes were super fluffy and moist!  And the pumpkin flavor really isn't that strong. So for anyone worried that the pumpkin is overpowering, don't be!  All I had on hand was pancake syrup, but I think some real maple syrup or even some spice up whipped cream, and maybe a handful of toasted pecans, would be just perfect.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.  :-)

These had a very good flavor but the pumpkin made them almost to moist.  I cooked them a long time but the centers were still gummy.  Maybe next time I'll make the batter alittle thinner.

WOW!!! My own changes are: Make with two eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla, more spices such as 1 teaspoon of nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon each of ginger and clove. Also I used a whole wheat blend and added two scoops of ground golden flax seed.  Served with butter and wild flower honey.
Goes without saying, use the best ingredients and you can't go wrong.

I was nervous about making these. I hadn't planned on making them till the next morning, but the kids couldn't wait to try them. They are wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly and turned out great! The kids said it was one of the best pancakes ever! I served them with Cinnamon Cream Syrup from this site, great combination!

Although,the taste of these pancakes were very good, the pancakes themselves were not.  They were very doughy on the inside and I had to continuously add milk to the batter, to make it a pancake batter consistency.  I will not be making these again and will probably tweek my own pancake recipe to make pumpkin pancakes next time.

These had a good pumpkin taste and an ok texture.  They're not super sweet, so if you like that, sprinkle them with sugar and cinnamon, or eat them with syrup.  Half a batch made me about 8 4-inch pancakes.  Would definitely make again!

Also, they freeze well and are excellent upon reheating.

I substituted apple sauce for the oil and added another teaspoon of cinnamon. They were so yummy! I ate them for dinner last night, breakfast this morning, and as a sandwich for lunch. I just spread some peanut butter and blackberry jam on 2 small pancakes- it made lunch more interesting. I would definitely make these again.

This is a great recipe! I substituted the flour for whole wheat flour, buttermilk instead of the milk and vinegar, and let it sit for 5 minutes before I used the batter.  I topped these with some fresh whipped cream and they were amazing. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good base to start off of, but the recipe as is needed tweaking for my tastes.  I used a whole wheat baking mix so I left out the baking soda and baking powder.  I just used 2 cups of the mix.  I hate allspice so I deleted that too.  I ended up using a whole can of pumpkin, but I really like pumpkin.  I doubled the cinnamon and the ginger.  I also added more brown sugar, about 1/4 cup.  I also used skim milk and cut the oil to 1 Tbsn.  I kind of just tasted the recipe until it was how I liked it.  As far as the vinegar, use cider vinegar.  I have made these 3x and used no vinegar first, used white the second, and cider the 3rd.  The vinegar makes them fluffier I think, but white vinegar I could taste.  I used a lot of pumpkin so mine were very moist!!  I loved it though because I love the pumpkin pie flavor.  Also, the batter was a bit thick at the end so I added water.  My advice, taste the batter because if you do not like it in the bowl, you won't like it when it is done.  You can adjust from there.

Beautiful and delicious...

The other night I babysat 3 kids along with my two.  I thought...pancakes for dinner would be fun.  The batter consistency seemed more like waffle batter.  Like many other reviewers I had to add more milk (maybe 1/2 c. or more)to make pancakes.  I added a bit more spice as well.  When the pancakes were done I spread real butter on them and sprinkled powdered sugar.  It was a hit.  All the kids loved them (one of them is the pickiest kid I've ever seen).

I did use the new white whole wheat flour.  It added a bit of fiber but looked just like white flour.

Ever since I had these at IHOP a couple of weeks ago I have been craving them.  Well I found this recipe and it is just like the ones that I had a couple of weeks ago.  I used a 1oz scoop to make my pancakes and I flattened them out a little bit, as someone else suggested.  I also cooked them until the tops were no longer shinny in appearance.  And then flipped them over.  I also used 1.5 tsp of pumpkin spice.  I also triple sifted the dry ingredients, because some said that they were quite dense.  My 5 year old and 2.5 year old LOVED them!!!  I also made some cinnamon butter and spread that on top.  These will be made again and again!!!

Tasted like pumpkin pancakes should (I guess). A bit heavy - I added more milk after the first batch, but still doughy vs. light nd airy. Used pumpkin pie spice instead of the various spices listed in the recipe.

Excellent tasting pancakes, with just the right amount of spices.  Pancakes are light and fluffy, yet filling.  Great on their own or with warm maple syrup.  Absolute keeper!

This recipe was great but unfortunately I have gotten lazy and am used to complete pancake mixes where you just add water.  I just can't beat the convenience.

texture is light and fluffy.  The flavor of the pumpkin was so minimal in mine it was not at all overpowering.

Just made these. My daughter loved them. So moist and fluffy. I didn't have allspice but I had trader joes pumpkin pie spice. These are the best homemade pancake recipe. I put in a little extra brown sugar.  Thank you for a great recipe.I am sure ths will be a family favorite.

If you love pumpkin and pancakes go home and make these immediately!  I used pumpkin that I roasted and pureed myself.  They were amazing and I made them exactly as the recipe states.  I didn't, nor would I, change a thing. My husband who isn't exactly a big pumpkin fan made himself an omelet for breakfast and after having a bite of my pancake he ended up having two pancakes with his omelet!  They are honestly that good.  Enjoy!

I work shift work so on Thanksgiving when I'm on evenings we do brunch instead of dinner. Eggs, turkey sausage, and these pumpkin pancakes. Haven't made any substitutions and they turn out great every time. Top them with whipped cream and or maple syrup. Delish!!

I have been working on these pancakes for an hour now. They WILL NOT COOK ALL THE WAY THROUGH. 
I followed the recipe exactly, I have my griddle on high now which of course is just burning them. I tried medium, medium high.

Really good and moist!  My little one ate them without butter or syrup.  I thought the pumpkin flavor was a little weak, but that may have been because I used skim milk, which other reviewers mentioned waters down the pumpkin flavor.  So next time I may up the cinnamon or use pumpkin pie spice.  Also, this time, since my hubby doesn't like ginger, I used nutmeg instead - didn't think you could really have a pumpkin recipe without nutmeg!

This is a really good recipe but I found the batter too thick. My first batch of pancakes were not dry on top by the time the bottom was done, even though I heated the skillet throughly before pouring the batter. I added a splash more milk and it worked perfectly, maybe 2 tbsp more than the recipe called for. Delicious, fragrant and fast!

I've been looking for a recipe like this ever since I lost the one I had been using. The only thing I did differently is I used pumpkin pie spice instead of ginger. Everything else I did exactly as the recipe is printed. I found when I cooked these after I flipped them I had to press down on them to flatten them out or else they didn't cook in the middle. They were so thick. As long as I did that they cooked to perfection. I use my food processor to mix everything and poured the batter into a pitcher for pouring onto the skillet. I had a yield of 15 medium size pancakes. My family has no interest in eating plain pancakes after eating pumpkin pancakes. I would love to try this for waffles.

Great pancakes! I made one substitution: 2 tablespoons of applesauce for the veg oil.

Made these pancakes for 3 teenagers who were literally speechless they loved them so much!

The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly and was bitterly disappointed.  The second time I followed another reviewers recipe and used these ingredients and it was fantastic.  I also used a mixer and spread the batter with the back of the 1/4 measuring cup. "  1. Add 1 1/3 cups pumpkin 2. Add 1 Tbsp Cinnamon 3. Add 1/2 tsp nutmeg 4. Delete the allspice, vinegar and ginger Here are my ingredients: 2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons brown sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon Â½ teaspoon nutmeg	1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups milk 1 1/3 cups pumpkin puree 1 egg 2 tablespoons vegetable oil."

I love these. I tried Nancy's recipe with pancake mix. I was out of milk and use soy milk instead. Then my 10 year old son had the brilliant idea of adding chocolate chips and whipped cream! It was awesome!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY.
These had a nice flavor but were too dry and dense. I'm sure there's things you could do to make it fluffier like using pastry flour or extra eggs but I feel that if you don't follow the recipe exactly you can't give it a fair star rating so I always follow it exactly the first time. 
Next time I'll definitely add an extra egg, more milk and probably some blueberries or chocolate chips to make it fluffier and more moist.
EDIT; made them a second time with a few changes to make them HEALTHIER :)
sub 4 egg whites for eggs, sub 2 Tablespoons applesauce for oil, sub 1 cup protein powder for 1 cup of flour (depending on your brand of protein powder you may not be able to do this or you may need to add extra baking powder to make them fluffy), completely omitted brown sugar, sub 3 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice for spices and added about 1 cup blueberries. Added a few Tablespoons extra milk until the batter seemed to pour a little nicer. 
I found with these changes the recipe was a much better consistency. Pancakes were moist, taisty and liked by all. (Plus MUCH less fattening and fewer carbs)

Yum, yum! These were the BOMB!!! My husband isn't home for dinner on Tuesdays. He HATES pumpkin ANYTHING and I am IN LOVE with the stuff (ha!), so I use this night to make my favorite seasonal dishes. :) Not only were these EASY to make, they were SUPER delicious and even easier to eat lol! Because this recipe makes a significantly large batch of pancakes, I invited my neighbor over to help polish them off.... Other than adding ~ 1/2 c. of semi-sweet chocolate chips to my batter, using vanilla baking oil instead of regular vegetable oil (I had it, so why not???) and subbing pumpkin pie spice for the individual spices called for (I didn't have any allspice, hence the substitution), I made no "real" changes. This recipe needs no tweaks or enhancements - it's perfect as is! Maple syrup and a pat of whipped butter sprinkled with cinnamon were nice touches. Breakfast sausage links and steaming mugs of apple cider rounded out our meal. Thanks SO much for sharing your AWESOME recipe, Ruth! I now have a new seasonal favorite to add to my growing collection and my neighbor wants the recipe so she can make these herself! :-)

I have made this recipe two ways 1-with substitution and 1-exact to the recipe minus the salt (I never use salt in my pancakes) and both came out great. 

The first time I made them I was all out of allspice, so I used pumpkin pie spice and left out the ginger. 
I used frozen pumpkin puree (from our own cooked pumpkins).  

My 3 year old daughter has always loved pancakes, but since making these she now ALWAYS requests pumpkin pancakes :) I've been making these for 7 months now without any complaints. Great recipe!

Good Pancakes.   The batter was a bit thick, so I thinned it with about 2 tbsp of water.   I used whole milk since that is what we have in our house, so that could have been the reason it was thicker.  I will make them again.

Great pancake texture, but I screwed up and only put 1tsp of pumpkin spice instead of separate recommended seasoning.  Should have been at least 2 tsp of pumpkin spice. Also, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond.  Used buttermilk because I had leftover from another recipe and used whole can of pumpkin.  I will make again, but definitely more seasoning.

These were a crowd pleaser for a girl's sleepover. Everyone from the girl who only eats salad and drinks water to the girl who already had two Dr. Peppers that  morn, loved them. 
I used buttermilk in place of the vinegar and milk and also whole wheat/ww spelt combo. Next time I will add chopped pecans or walnuts as it needed some crunch.

This is not a good pumpkin pancake recipe.  Please note that many of the five star reviews have dramatically altered the recipe by modifying a mix.  That is not the same recipe as this one!! My family ate it only because we had it with a yummy cinnamon syrup.  The pancakes themselves smelled off -- like they were made from play dough.  What is the point of the vinegar?  Buttermilk is much tastier that sour milk (which is made by adding vinegar to milk and letting it sit for a few minutes).  We will keep looking for a pumpkin pancake recipe.

really great! these had a really strong pumpkin flavor.  I am not an avid pancake maker and these still turned out perfect.  they were easy to pour and to cook evenly. they were perfectly sweetened to allow plenty of maple syrup and not get too sugary. overall a fantastic thanksgiving breakfast!!

wonderful - made plenty - batter is thick so make sure you spread it out - used 2.5 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of all the spices - maybe a little less baking soda

These pancakes are extremely fluffy and delicious! Even a two year old in our group enjoyed them. It was easy to put together the recipe. I doubled it and got about 20 pancakes.

Used pumpkin pie spice, evaporated milk and spread out the pancake batter once on the griddle as other reviewers suggested.  Great additions to a a great recipe, thanks for sharing!  A new fall family tradition.

These were perfect.  I let the batter sit for about five minutes and it puffed up - the pancakes looked like restaurant pancakes.  I've never made fluffier pancakes at home.  Delicious.  I added 1t of vanilla, used 2 t of cinnamon, and used buttermilk instead of milk and vinegar.  Then I also added pecans after the first side was cooked, just before I flipped them and it was amazing.  I made a brown sugar molasses glaze from another recipe for syrup and it was just the perfect combination.

These were the BEST pancakes I have ever eaten! I made them for myself and for my son this morning and I can not wait to make them for the rest of my family this weekend! The only thing I did differently was I used 1/2 tsp of nutmeg instead of the allspice because I did not have any, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written...they are super moist....thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I've made this a couple times. As is, it's just "okay." The batter is VERY thick. I tried both low and high heats on my griddle and neither seemed to cook them through. It seems like 1/2-3/4 cup more milk makes the batter more workable, but it does "wash out" the flavor (as some others have mentioned). I've found that adding an extra 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree, doubling the spices (including salt), and adding 1/2-3/4 cup more milk is a good compromise. My family loves these pancakes!

I thought these were great, but they were a bit thick for hubby's taste. Definitely make mini sized cakes because they are filling. Great flavor.

Great recipe.  Love how they have just a hint of sweetness.  I doubled the recipe, then added an additional egg.  (Doubling the recipe uses up a whole can of pumpkin.) Used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 all-purpose flour.  I was heavy handed on the cinnamon because we like it.  Added vanilla also.  When I put the batter down on the pan, I sprinkled crushed walnuts for those of us that like them.  Used up leftover batter by pouring into a muffin pan, then sprinkling crushed walnuts on top.  Haven't tasted them yet, but they look beautiful.  Thanks for the recipe.  :D

I used to hate pumpkin growing up and now I devour anything remotely pumpkin flavored. I made this for my boyfriend and I for breakfast as a pre-Halloween treat. 

I followed the recipe according to instructions except altered somewhat according to the other reviews: I added an extra egg, a 1/4 cup more of pumpkin, an additional tablespoon of brown sugar (my boyfriend has an insane sweet tooth), and used 2 tsps of Pumpkin Pie spice versus the individual spices. I also found the batter to be a bit thick so I added some water. 

I also found that the pancakes need more time to cook on each side than normal pancakes (the batter is a bit thicker due to the pumpkin). 

The flavor was clearly pumpkin but not overly sweet. Almost like a pumpkin muffin in flavor. My boyfriend loved it (he ate 8 at once!) so it is a hit. Easy to make and beautiful end result color/texture.

I don't know what I did wrong. I followed the recipe and instructions to the T and the batter came out really thick. I know I am not supposed to taste it because of the raw egg, but I did anyways and the batter tasted really dull. I don't like to give up after the first try, so I will make these again, maybe tonight or tomorrow morning. I will read some reviews and take some suggestions from the others and we'll see if that works out a little better.
**UPDATE: As promised, I made these again but with modifications, added 1 tsp vanilla extract, added the dry ingredients to the wet by adding 1/2 cup of the flour first, then 1 tablespoon at a time till I got to the right consistency, I also used lemon juice instead of the vinegar. When finished I used a 1/4 measuring cup to pour the batter onto the pan, spread the batter softly with a spatula and flipped once the big bubbles started to appear. These were much much better this way. Thank you for sharing =)

Give the proper measurement of flour instead of a ton more than is needed.  I had no idea what the consistency of the batter was supposed to be either.  Not a great recipe!

These were just exceptional and my kids RAVED about how they may never be able to go back to plain old pancakes again.   If you happen to have buttermilk in the house, you can replace the milk and vinegar with buttermilk.

I used self-rising flour and forgot to add salt, but they turned out delicious!  I made vanilla syrup* to go with them which made them even better! 
*1 part water, 2 parts raw sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla, dash of cinnamon, heat to boiling, boil 1 minute, turn off heat and allow the syrup to sit in the pot on the burner until cool enough to serve.

Changed recipe for simplicity: 2 Cups Bisquick Pancake Mix, 3 TBS brown sugar, 1 egg, 1 1/2 cup milk, 2 TBS vinegar, 1 teaspoon allspice, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, and 1 can of pumpkin puree (not the giant!). 
This is a THICK batter, so spread it out with a spoon.  The inside consistency of the cakes were so similar to a pumpkin pie, SO GOOOD!!

I wanted to make pumpkin pancakes for a long time since I first tried them at IHOP. The batter was super thick so I ending up messing up the first pancake because the middle didn't cook and therefore the pancake burnt. Make sure you use lower heat on these pancakes because they burn fast. Spread the batter out right after you place it on the griddle. I thought these pancakes were a bit too hearty and condensed. I also didn't taste much pumpkin flavor in these. They were just okay to me.. I put syrup, caramel, and topped them with toasted pecans. The syrup and caramel added a nice touch though.

These had a wonderful flavor!  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour and added 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Other then that, everything else stayed the same.  I will make these again and again.

Although my family and I enjoyed these hearty pancakes, they need lots of tweaking to make them memorable.  The batter is very thick, so I used an ice cream scoop to get them on the griddles. I followed the suggestions of quickly spreading out the batter as it was placed on the griddle. I lowered the heat so they wouldn't burn before the center was cooked and they came out perfectly. Even though we all prefer thin pancakes, the texture and heartiness of these was perfect for a cold morning. On to the flavor...pretty bland. It seemed like there was plenty of spices added to the batter but after making one pancake as a test, I found it lacking in flavor. I had to go back and add another round of the spices, plus some nutmeg. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. I felt it was too late to add more pumpkin without ruining the batter but next time I will. The pumpkin flavor is almost non-existent. So, all in all, this recipe is a good starting point and I will make it again but with some changes.

Moist or undercooked?
It was difficult to cook these pancakes thoroughly. I don't want to give my family salmonella so I won't be making this again.

definitely a new favorite for me and the family.  Yum.  Had breakfast for dinner tonight, and they turned out great!  Only changes I made...I went a little heavy on the spices, added a tsp of vanilla, a tablespoon of molasses, and divided the flour to include 1 cup whole wheat.  It is a VERY  THICK batter, but, i didn't thin it out...just spread it into a circle with a spoon on a hot, oiled griddle.  DELISH!  thanks!

These were awesome! I am avoiding eating milk and eggs lately so I subbed 1 3/4 cups of Silk for the milk and half a banana in place of the egg. Nobody complained about these and I love that they barely have any sugar in them!

These pancakes were pure heaven.  They were fluffy but had a wonderful richness.  The pumpkin flavor was definitely there.  I had pumpkin pancakes at IHOP a couple of months ago and went on a search to find a recipe that was similar.  These came pretty darn close.  I served them to a friend who also enjoyed them very much.  I topped them with walnuts, whipped cream, and a bit of pure maple syrup.    Good news!  They also freeze well.  I had an abundance left over, so I let them cool, separated them with waxed paper, wrapped in plastic wrap, and froze.

These are really great. I soured the milk with the vinegar for a few minutes before tossing it in, and I used pumpkin pie spice because it was on hand. Other than the spice, I followed the recipe to the letter. So good! My husband grimaced at the idea of pumpkin pancakes, but said he would try them and see. He ended up eating two plates and very happily admitted he was wrong.

Wow with all the great ratings I was excited but....I can hardly taste the pumpkin...and the ginger i totally overpowering!  I even doubled the cinnamon since we love it and the ginger is what stands out over all.  We ended up putting chocolate chips and peanut butter on them (our favorite way to eat cinnamon pancakes) and the kids ate them fine but NOT what we expected, sorry.

I really liked the flavor of these pancakes but the batter prepared as the recipe calls is very, very thick. I thinned it out by adding milk. I tried this recipe for both pancakes and waffles and I thought that the waffles were superior.

I made these this morning and they were wonderful! I used whole wheat flour, and soaked it in the called-for milk (I used part buttermilk) overnight (it makes for better digestion, and lighter breads - you should try it sometime!) and I also used Rapadura (a dehydrated form of raw sugar) instead of brown sugar. Aaaah - scrumptious! Top with butter and real maple syrup for perfection!

GREAT recipe. Did everything in the recipe but omitted the vinegar.  Awesome flavor. Be sure to cook these pancakes in smaller portions and use your spoon to pour out batter and then spread out the batter a little more as they are dense and do not cook like normal pancakes.  I also took maple syrup and whisked in some ground cinnamon and heated. Poured that over and they were delish!!!

This is a great fall breakfast.  I made a couple small tweaks to suit our taste, extra spices and pumpkin.  I'll definitely be making these again. I might make the batter ahead of time to let the flavors develop more. Pumpkin pie is always better the next day so perhaps the same is true for these.  I don't understand the negative comments about a lack of flavor.  These had a nice fall flavor and pancakes are not typically loaded with flavor.  These are worth trying and make sure to use real maple syrup!  Thanks Ruth.

Absolutely fabulous!  The way I know I have a winner is when my kids whine at me:  "Mooommyyyy, I want another paaaancaaaake!"  Both of them did.  We loved them!  The only changes I made were to omit the allspice, which I didn't have, so I subbed nutmeg; added about 1/4 cup more pumpkin, because I wanted a big pumpkin flavor; and then added about 1/3 cup more milk to thin out the batter.  Delicious!  I took another reviewer's suggestion of using a spoon to spread the batter a little in the pan after pouring, which worked out fantastically.

I screwed this up majorly!! LOL.. this was was too mushy in the center and browned too easily. thought it was the temp. and too thin of batter, but still nothing worked in my case.. going to try this again, hoping it was just operator error, cause the flavor was there, but texture wasn't.. sorry..

Amazing as written.  I made the batter ahead of time and just cooked them at dinner time.  We all thought the pumpkin flavor was great  (much more noticeable than the other recipes we tried).  We did use pumpkin pie spice rather than the individual spices.  Also made another batch using Nancy's suggestion to doctor up a pancake mix.  Used Hodgson Mills Gluten Free pancake mix so our child on a gluten free diet could enjoy the same meal.  They came out great as well.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you !

Wow, these were so good. I love anything with pumpkin in it. Instead of the allpice, cinnamon, and ginger, I added 3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice that I got from this site. I would actually be able to eat this year round!

These were awfil I followed the recipe exactly. The outside was done while the middle didn't cook enough and was very mushy. These were a waste of time. My kids only took one bite and wouldn't eat anymore. I thought they were just being picky. I tried one and it was gross. It got tossed in the garbage. I even put a few pancakes back on the griddle to see if I could get the middle to cook more and all that did was overcook the outside of the pancakes. Will not make again.

Today was the 3rd time I made these. I double every thing and freeze 1/2 of them when done. I used whole wheat flour today and they came out fine. The grandkids loved them and they are better for me. Followed recipe exactly. The batter is very thick so when you put the 1/4 cup of batter on the griddle you need to use the back of a spoon to gently spread it out a little. 9/4/09 Made them today using 1/2 allpurpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat, added some pumpkin spice and flax seed. Love them. 8/28/10 Made them this morning, added some finely chopped pecans which made a good addition.

I thought the pancakes tasted kind of bland.  Try the suggestions of others for spicing up these pancakes if you are going to try them for the first time. The recipe was fine, even though the batter was a bit thick.  My husband and daughter thought the pancakes were good.  I, however, didn't particularly like the taste of pumpkin for pancakes and will probably now only use pumpkin puree for dessert-type recipes.  I thought a sprinkling of turbinado sugar perked them up a bit, adding a bit of sweetness and some crunch to them.

These were great to make and freeze, for a quick breakfast; however, I believe there is twice the amount of baking powder needed. These were so thick, even when I spread them out very thin, they rose and grew thicker. I didn't make the syrup and kids (10&8) loved them. They really do stick to your ribs, and I'll keep them in my file to make again, next time reducing the amount of baking powder. I hope halving the amount won't compromise the integrity of such a thick batter. Thanks for the post.

I studied the reviews before I started to make these and i decided to make them like the recipe except to add 2 eggs and 1/2 tsp. cloves and 2 tsp. cinnamon. They were more wonderful than I even imagined! I tried the cinnamon cream sauce, but prefer it w/ lite pancake syrup. I served them to guests at my B&B and everyone loved them! Wow!! You gotta try them. Remember to put them onto the griddle and immediately spread them out a bit so they cook through better.

These are absolutely delicious.  I serve them with whipped cream and powdered sugar and it's our new Christmas morning breakfast.  Excellent recipe, thanks!

These were stupendous! Very pumpkiny, and very moist. We devoured them with butter and maple syrup. Changes I made: I added a few pinches of nutmeg, used water instead of milk, and used whole wheat pastry flour.  I made them once with canned pumpkin and they were definitely not as good. Make your own puree! I've also used yams and butternut squash instead of pumpkin and it works wonderfully.

I subbed apple cider for the milk and used apple cider vinegar for the vinegar.  These are really really good, so be sure to make plenty!

What a festive way to make pancakes around the holidays!  I used Bisquik in place of the flour and baking powder, and I also substituted pumpkin pie spice for the allspice and ginger.  My entire family loved them!  It's a great alternative when your bored with regular old pancakes.

five hundred stars if i could!  so delicious.  the batter has a bizarre consistency that i was worried about, but the end result is delicious. they are moister than a regular pancake, so don't cook too long, they will only get burnt, not any denser.  thank you for a delicious recipe!

These were great pancakes.  I did change the recipe a bit:  half whole wheat flour/half all-purpose flour.  Instead of using milk/vinegar, buttermilk was used - same difference.  Because the batter was so thick, they were cooked at about 25 degrees cooler than suggested.   Next time we will add toasted pecans or walnuts.  We love the added crunch.  

The biggest change of all was that butternut squash was substituted for the pumpkin.  We have an abundance of butternut squash from our garden and frequently use it in lieu of pumpkin.  You really can't taste the difference.

My kids loved these pancakes and I felt good because they are getting a healthy dose of vitamin A!  Here are my changes:  used whole wheat flour, 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices, buttermilk instead of the milk + vinegar, 1 15oz can of pumpkin and no salt.  What a fabulous way to start your day.  Your house will smell wonderful.  Delicious and nutritious!!

We haven't made any pancakes besides these since I found the recipe.  The first time I made them I thought that the batter was too thick, so I added milk and they weren't bad.  The second time I made them I followed another reviewers suggestion and just used my measuring cup to spread out the batter and WOW WOW WOW!  They were FANTASTIC.  Amazing flavor and SO light and tasty.  :)

Yum!! I "veganized" this recipe, and it turned out fantastic! Instead of the milk, I added the same amount of plain soy milk. And instead of the egg, I added 1 Tbl. ground flax seed + 3 Tbl. water. I might increase the brown sugar to 4 Tbl. next time, but these were amazing! Fluffy and delicious! Easy, too!

I thought this recipe was really tasty. When my husband took his first couple bites, he said simply, "Wow!". Later I heard him bragging on the phone to his mother about how I made them! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the batter was very thick and I had to add quite a bit of milk to thin it out which may have sacrificed some of the texture. But, I would still make these again!

My husband loved these, but my 6 year old son just couldn't get himself to appreciate the idea of putting his favorite breakfast food through the horror of pumpkins.  Although admittedly he liked it untill I told him it was pumpkin inside the pancakes.

Yum, these are really good. Unsurprisingly they are reminiscent of pumpkin pie (without as much guilt!) - fantastic with butter and maple syrup, a little butter seems to really bring out the flavour. I had some leftovers and they were still great 1-2 days later, reheated in the microwave. Next time I'll try upping the spices a little, as suggested by previous reviewers, but still a 5 star recipe.

Good recipe. Nice pupkin flavor. Were a little heavy, but adding a bit of water helped. Letting he batter sit for a while improved the taste by letting the spices permeate the batter. I'll make these again.

This is the ULTIMATE in nummy pancakey goodness!  :-)
  I serve these whenever we have guests and EVERYONE LOVES THEM!  I do it a little differently than the recipe, never the same twice.  I use a mix of whole wheat, oat, and (a little) white flour.  I add at least a 1/2 cup of flax meal as well.  I use more pumpkin and always use two eggs instead of one.  I adjust the thickness by adding extra milk as needed to get just the right consistency.  Oh, I also use 1tsp of pumpkin pie spice on top of all the other spices.  With the flour mix it needs a little extra spice.  They take a bit longer to cook but are worth it.  These are healthy and delicious and I feel good about serving them to my family.  With the flax meal they get some additional Omegas in their diet. Try it...you'll love it!

I don't understand what all of the fuss was about with these.  I love just about anything with pumpkin but these had no flavor.  Very bland and didn't cook well at all.  I even added extra spices and sugar to give it some flavor.  It didn't help.  I won't make this again!

These pancakes are so good!  If you have thick pumpkin (Libby's, etc) make sure you add an extra cup of milk and one extra egg.  If you have soupy pumpkin, don't worry about it.  I added chocolate chips to some of my pancakes (I know that sounds weird, but don't knock it till you try it) and it was yummy.  Thanks for the the great pancakes!

I must give this a 5 star, even though I had to change the amount of milk by almost a cup and add an extra egg, it is a VERY tasty meal! My kids LOVE this and it is so simple to make! I have made this about 8 times in the past 2 1/2 weeks! =-) THanks for the great recipe!

These are divine! My kids swear they're the same as IHOP pumpkin pancakes. I took the wise advice of other reviewers, add a heaping Tablespoon of baking powder. These are really great heated up the next morning for a grab and go breakfast!

I found the inner pancake to be a tad too moist...overall taste was good and pancakes rise nicely.  I used Five Spice spice mixture in place of the individual spices and still received that wonderfully warm-spicey flavor (added the salt, too).  We warm our pure maple syrup and today added a bit of cinnamon...delicious breakfast on a cold Jan Saturday morning!  I'll use the recipe agin!

These were not good.  I followed the recipe, and they made the house smell wonderful, but they wouldn't cook in the middle no matter how much I flattened them or how low or high the heat was.  And they tasted like just dough.

These are very fluffy pancakes.  They are good, but could use st least another tablespoon sugar and 1-2 tesspoons spices.

I made the recipe as written. The pumpkin flavor was subtle, but the pancakes were hearty and very filling. I froze half of the cooked pancakes and upon reheating, found the pumpkin flavor to be more pronounced. I plan to make these pancakes again.

These pancakes turned out delish!  I have made them several times and they are always a family pleaser.  I have also made them with half oat flower/half whole wheat flower and they were still really yummy!

Delicious. I like the pumpkin flavor with the allspice and cinnamon. I tried 1 cup all purpose and 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and they turned out pretty thick and heavy. It might have been the whole wheat flour that made them so heavy.  The pancakes ended up rising to nearly half an inch which I really enjoyed.

Amazing!! Made a few adjustments as to what I had on hand. Used 2 eggs instead of 1 and started with one cup of whole milk. I also used 2 cups of whole wheat pastry flour, 4 Tbsp of brown sugar, along with 3 tsp of pre mixed pumpkin pie spice plus 1 tsp of cinnamon. After the wet and dry was combined, added about another 1/4 cup of milk. Also whipped up some cinnamon and brow sugar butter and used real maple syrup!! So good!!

Great recipe! But they're very dense and I recommend not putting as much at a time when cooking also make sure to spread the batter! Otherwise great fluffy pancakes!!! :)

Really enjoyed the flavor of these pancakes and will be making them again! I was afraid the ginger would be overpowering so I cut it back to 1/4 teaspoon but kept everything else as listed.

I followed Nancy's (the highest ranking reviewer) recipe. I wanted to buy Trader Joe's pumpkin waffle mix but they didn't have it, so I was looking for a substitute, and oh my god, is this stuff great. Normally you need syrup for pancakes, but with these one you don't! They taste delicious by themselves! I keep eating them as I make them! 5+ stars! I used Krusteaz waffle mix instead of whatever else everybody's using, don't think it matters though! It's a fool-proof recipe!

Love these pancakes! They are pretty easy to make as well. I usually make them exactly as the recipe states except that I omit the allspice (because I never have any). I think they taste just fine without it. The batter will likely be thicker than you're used to, but trust me, they come out perfectly.  Make sure they are fully cooked through or they will be doughy and mushy.  I tend to flatten mine out with the spatula to aid with the process and to gauge how "mushy" they feel.  Whether that works?  Who knows? :) But you should definitely try these!  I have eaten them with homemade cinnamon syrup and apple cider syrup (both recipes from this site).  Lots of compliments from the people for whom I have made these.

I made a big batch, mixed all the dry ingredients and then just add the milk, butter and eggs as needed. My kids love them. I have also used Spelt flour and have had great results.

LOVE this recipe - so do my kids are all their little friends who have had it. I usually use fresh pumpkin, or squash. Sometimes I substitute sweet potato for the pumpkin, and it also comes out great! Also, I put the vinegar into the milk to make buttermilk before mixing that with the wet ingredients.

Not liking this.  The first thing I found wrong was the ratio of wet to dry ingredients.  I was so frustrated I watched a video on here on how to make pumpkin pancakes, which shouldn't be hard but I am not a breakfast cook.  The video states a CUP of pumpkin not an entire can, every other ingredient and measurement was the same.  When there are too many wet ingredients it tastes raw and undercooked.  Too many dry and it didn't cook right.  I did not like the spices, too little pumpkin flavor and too much allspice.  I will experiment with the ingredients and read through more reviews because the concept of pumpkin pancakes sounds yummy.

This was a great recipe and the flavor was definitely there, but I had issues getting them to cook right in the center. I tried a cooler temp and then a hotter temp and neither worked. It seemed like they were overly moist so maybe I did something wrong. I did use a cast iron skillet which could have been an issue. I'm still giving this a good rating because the flavor was very good.

These are a weekly staple in our house! Pumpkin perfection! I use a griddle that I can shake to spread the batter evenly- it's a thick batter but don't mess with adding more milk.     I add more cloves because we like that spice and chopped walnuts to mine for some more protein. We have also discovered that a maple/agave blend (Trader Joes) is wonderful with these! Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

My kids were wanting pancakes but "not just the regular ones". I found this recipe and it was very easy to make and they are delicious! This recipe will definitely be a keeper. The first time I made them I followed the recipe...the next time I made them I changed the recipe to be gluten free. They came out just as delicious as the original recipe.

I made these with Almond milk and used my own pumpkin-spice, and they were lovely. :) I made a pumpkin syrup by heating together pumpkin butter, brown sugar, maple syrup, apple cider vinegar, butter, and a splash of lemon juice. Each batch seemed to turn out better than the last, so I think next time I'll let the batter rest while I make the syrup. That really seemed to improve the texture.

Best pumpkin pancakes I've had. Spices were a little overwhelming for me though.

I changed it up a little, but otherwise it was amazing! My family loved it, and asked me to make it again. To make fluffier I added apple cider vinegar. I also added a little more cinnamon, and I use butter pecan syrup. I was told that this was the best pancakes ever...

Awesome pancakes!  Left out the vinegar due to having none on hand and used 2 heaping tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of other spices.  This recipe is a keeper.  :)

DELICIOUS! They don't come any better than this. Fluffy and almost cake like. Great pumpkin flavor blended with subtle spices. I did not have any allspice so instead of 1/2tsp allspice I used 1/4tsp nutmeg & 1/4tsp ground cloves. YUM! Why on earth would anyone want to tweek this recipe??

I followed this recipe as written. The pancakes were mushy in the middle no matter how long I cooked them. Then I thinned out the batter with more milk and they were still mushy. I ate one anyway and it also could have used more flavoring and salt. Will not be making again.

Amazing! I omitted the vinegar, and changed up the spices to suit my personal tastes. The pumpkin flavor was right on. Topped 'em off with a handful of walnuts and some real maple syrup. YUM!

I will never make regular pancakes again in my life! These are the best ever! I used whole grain flour, 2 eggs instead of 1 and 1 tbsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the separate ingredients. I am going to try this recipe with soy milk next. Great recipe. I love anything pumpkin and these pancakes tasted like pumpkin pie. So good.

The middle of the pancake was raw and took too long to cook, so I ended up making VERY flat odd cupcakes. Tasted ok, but I don't know if I'd make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I quite liked these pancakes. They were moist and flavorful. I made it again yesterday using two eggs instead of one, and it is even better. They were fluffier with the extra egg. As is, it's a very good recipe. With an additional egg, this is a fantastic recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as is.  I used pureed fresh pumpkin.  These pancakes had a pleasant, soft and chewy texture and a light pumpkin flavor.  I have tried a lot of pancake recipes and this is a new favorite.

Fantastic! Basically my review is off of what I made up using this recipe as a base. 1 cup pancake mix, 1/3 cup milk, 1/3 cup water, part of 1 egg, 1 tbs of oil, 1 tbs brown sugar, 1/2 cup canned pumpkin puree, dash of pumpkin spice, dash of cinnamon. This made only 4 pancakes and they were incredible. I would imagine if you have all the ingredients for this recipe, it would come out amazing. It just so happens that I totally winged it since I didn't have everything the recipe called for. I will be making this again!!!

These pancakes are excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly, the family loved them.  Although, I did make chocolate chip faces on the pancakes I made for the kids.  Hubby and I ate them plain.  This is a nice change from traditional pancakes.

Like the spices of winter? I added extra ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg. Very spicy, it was almost hot to the tongue! But a perfect texture: like eating a spiced, hot miniature pillow.

Wowsa!  We had these for our Shrove Tuesday dinner, along with Cinnamon Cream Syrup (also on this site), and they were spectacular.  A great meal with crispy bacon on the side.  Not lo-cal, but a super treat.  Hubby had them again for supper at work that night.  A definite keeper!

These are really good! I plan on making these again. I used some pumpkin that I cooked up last fall and froze and they came out quite well. I didn't have all the spice so I had to improv with a 1tsp cinn and 1tsp nutmeg.

I just finished eating these pumpkin puncakes, and they are fantastic!  I made the recipe as written with only one small change - I was short 1/4 c. of pumpkin puree, so I added applesauce to make up the difference (I couldn't detect the applesauce - I think it just added needed moisture).  As other reviewers have mentioned, these do need a little help to get them to spread out, so I used the back of the measuring cup I was pouring the batter into the skillet with.  So glad I finally tried this recipe :)

I made these this morning and doubled the recipe so I could use 1 can of pumpkin (15 oz).  I followed the recipe excepting I used a pumpkin pie spice mix in place of the allspice, cinnamon and ginger and a wheat/white flour mix in place of all white flour.  They were a little thick (a little short on the pumpkin?) so I added about 1/3 cup more milk.  The pancakes were fluffy and delish.  I dipped them in just a little maple syrup.  Freeze the leftovers with a piece of wax paper between each pancake for easy toaster breakfasts during the week.

Wow!  Awesome pancakes!  The flavor and texture of these reminded me so much of pumpkin bread.  I did notice that many of my pancakes had gooey middles.  So they do take a little longer to cook than a normal pancake.  Next time I will make sure to remember that and cook them a little longer on each side.  I followed pretty much exactly except left out the vinegar, yuck, and added in 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  I served these with another allrecipes recipe, absolute best pancake syrup, and they paired so well together!  It was the ultimate pancake breakfast.  So good!  Thanks for this great recipe!

just ok for me, which was disappointing because usually 4+ star recipes usually turn out to be really good.  Everyone, you can't give a recipe a good rating if you changed something about the recipe.  Post your rating for the recipe as-is, and then post your modifications as a separate recipe!  Thank you!

These were okay. The pancakes were too thick for my liking and the flavor a little too subtle. I think I'll keep looking for a recipe more suited to my tastes.

Not too sweet, good pumpkin flavor, I added "heaping" measurements of the spices...we like our food flavorful!  I also added pecans to 1/2 of the batter...yum!  Will make these again...wonderful for a Fall breakfast!

These are AMAZING!  I did not alter the recipe and they turned out perfectly!  Just make sure to spread the batter out a little once on the griddle, otherwise they are really thick and take longer to cook.

These are a favorite in our house and we have made the m many times since I found the recipe last year.  The only thing we do different is add some chopped pecans.  Awesome!

I made these as written, but the consistency of the cooked pancakes was mushy.  No one in my family would eat them.  The flavor was good, though.

Loved these!!! The only change I made was used pumpkin pie spice in place of the allspice, cinnamon and ginger. They were a bit hit and I'm going to go make them again this morning...I froze half my batter last time so I could have them again another day and they came out great also.

Really delicious. We modified the recipe later by adding twice the sugar, adding another egg and separately whipping the whites into meringue them mixing with the rest of the batter.

My family loves to have this for brunch with pecans and caramelized bananas.

These were fabulous! I used almond milk instead of regular milk. I only had about 1/2 a cup of pumpkin puree (leftover from other baking). I also used about 1 3/4 cups of white flour and 1/4 cup of quinoa flour. I followed the rest exactly.

Delicious! Light and airy with a subtle pumpkin flavor. I did not have vinegar, so I took another reviewer's suggestion and used fresh lemon juice instead. I was worried when I could taste the lemon in the batter, but once the pancakes cooked up I couldn't taste it. Like other reviewers, I was also concerned that the batter was too thick, but it worked fine. Only criticism is that I used a bit more pumpkin than called for and even then I still wish it had more of a pumpkin flavor.

This was amazing!  I used my electric beaters to mix the wet ingredients to make sure the pumpkin mixed in well.  They were nice and fluffy!  My husband loved them with corn syrup instead of the regular stuff.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've been on a pumpkin kick and was wondering what to do with my leftover puree from my last baking adventure. These pancakes were the perfect solution! I used a lil over 1.5 cups of buttercream instead of the milk+vinegar combo. The batter was a lil thick so I add a splash more of buttercream at the end. They baked up thick but fluffy. I topped with warm maple syrup, toasted pecans and nutmeg whipped cream. I wanted to make whipped cream from scratch but the pancakes came together so quickly that I just ended up sprinkling some nutmeg in Cool Whip...worked great. The flavors were the epitome of fall with just the right balance of spice and sweetness. I only cooked a half batch so I'm already looking forward to tomorrow to whip up the rest.  Thank you Ruth!

Love the taste of pumpkin and it was quite good in these pancakes.  I cooked them on the griddle and they were nice and fluffy.  Served with eggs over easy and warm maple syrup.  Thanks Ruth for sharing.

I used fresh pumpkin puree and fresh ginger in these pancakes. They came out so good! I had leftover batter that I stored in the fridge and I think it actually tasted better after a day or two. Yum!!

Just made these pancakes and they were EXCELLENT. Note:  I made the following changes-used Butter Milk (instead of reg. milk), used 2 teasp. of Pumpkin Pie Spice by MacCormick (instead of allspice, cinnamon & ginger).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  I combined all dry ingredients together, wisking for 2 min. until well combined.  Then I mixed wet ingredients in a separate bowl until well mixed.  I then added little by little the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients until well combined.  The batter for these pancakes were PERFECT!  I suggest you serve these with real maple syrup, as there is not other syrup that can compare to the real deal!  Make these, you will not be sorry!

The batter was too thick so I would add more milk but we prefer a thinner pancake. The flavor was good, not too sweet but not too much spice. Just right for syrup.

I used 1 whole can of pumpkin instead of the 1 cup which made the mixture more pumpkin-y, which was a plus for me. Then I used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon. The results were very delicious. It made about 15 pancakes for me.

I followed this recipe to the T except even though I made half the recipe I added 2 Total Tablespoons of brown sugar, totaling an extra TB if it were the full recipe. The serving size is PERFECT, I was able to make 6 nicely sized pancakes with half of the recipe  These pancakes were great. Nice thick and fluffy. Cooked very easily. Try them with the syrup recipe on 'Pumpkin Waffles with Apple Cider Syrup' on this website.(see my review on that as well) YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! Thanks to the submitter of this recipe for something different to start the Fall off with!

AMAZING!!!  I followed other reviews and added 1 T of white sugar and 1 t of vanilla, otherwise made them as is.  Cooked them on an electric griddle at 300 degrees and they were so fluffy and melted in your mouth.  I will be making these a lot!!  My new favorite food!! :)

These were perfect!  I made these pancakes exactly as written and I'm glad I did.  No need to add more milk or another egg, don't listen to that.  Just make this the way they are written and you won't regret it!  Definately going into my recipe box which is reserved for recipes that are the best!!!

Absolutely wonderful! The best pumpkin pancakes I've tried--even better than our favorite B&B's!

I attempted to make this with my daughter, we didn't make any changes to the recipe and it was so thick the inside of the pancakes remained a pumpkin slush. We tried cooking it on low and didn't have any luck and then I attempted to put them in the oven to cook the center and it still would not become firm. My three year old wouldn't eat them. Maybe with some changes made in the reviews, but I wouldn't attempt these again!

They are dense and filling but a bit flavorless, I expeted them to taste more like pumpkin. I didnt try to improve onthem. Cream cheese topping or something.

I did half whole wheat and half all purpose flour.  Took advice and used extra egg plus a teaspoon of vanilla.  Also used pumpkin pie spice as I wanted to use my my jar.  Super tasty-almost like eating pumpkin bread.

Hubby made these for me for Mother's Day! They were AWESOME!!! The only changes are that he cut the oil to 1tbsp and added 1tbsp applesauce instead, he added 1tbsp of extra brown sugar, added 1tsp vanilla, and he omitted the ginger because we had none. They were fluffy and perfect! Tasted like something from a restaurant! Our 1yr old loved them too!

I used whole wheat pastry flour, so I increased the baking soda and baking powder by 50%.  I also used 4 tbsp brown sugar.  Medium-high heat burned them or left raw middles, so I switched to medium heat and they came out great.  Using the 1/4 cup measurement, this made more like 18 pancakes, but everyone liked them enough to make them again, and it was a good use of extra pumpkin I had in the fridge.

I made a few changes based on other reviewers' suggestions; I doubled all of the spices, used a little more sugar and added vanilla. This is a great way to use my frozen pumpkin.

I've made these several times now, and both my toddler son and hubby gobble them up!  Delicious as is - I don't change anything.  Not sure what the vinegar does, but don't leave it out; the recipe is perfect with it.  Don't forget to spread the batter around a bit with a spoon once you pour it into the pan, otherwise the pancakes will be too think.  I also ran out of ginger when I made these this morning, and I added nutmeg instead - still delicious!  Thanks, Ruth, for getting my boys to eat pumpkin!

Very thick batter. I used an entire can of pumpkin, skipped the vinegar, subbed white whole wheat flour and increased the spices. These are not sweet and need syrup in order to round out the flavor. They are good- just a bit thick- next time i will thin them out a bit. Thanks for sharing

I used whole wheat flour and butternut squash puree and it was smaching! My sons, 2, 4, and 6 thought making orange pancakes was hilarious and gobbled them up.

These were far too dry, probably in part because there is almost no moisture in the air today, and they did not taste very much like pumpkin.  I will make them again, but I'll up the wet ingredients by adding extra pumpkin and an extra egg, and I'll also reduce the flour by about 1/2 cup.

Fantastic!  So flavorful and rich!  I doubled because I have a lot of mouths to feed.  I also added a little bit more milk, because traditionally, we like our pancake batter a little runnier.  Also added nutmeg because I only had a tiny bit of ginger left.  DELICIOUS!!!!

Made recipe as stated. These were very gooood and very filling.  Hits the spot on this cold snowy day!  I had baked a pumpkin at Thanksgiving for pumpkin pie and had pulp left over, so I froze it for later use. I defrosted it last night. This worked out very well.

These pancakes were terrific. I didn't have allspice, so I threw in some nutmeg. Other than making that change out of necessity, I made the recipe as is and my whole family loved them.

This is a fantastic receipe just the way it is !  Loved it and was so easy to make. I had a few leftovers so I put them in a ziploc bag and froze them.  When my son asked for some the next week, I pulled the frozen ones out and heated them in the microwave.  Wouldn't change a thing !

I started making these pumpkin pancakes to get some fruit into my no veggie, no fruit son.  It worked like a charm.  I make it with both canned and fresh pumpkin, whatever I have on hand.  Now, I make up 1 cup of whatever I have laying around - banana, carrots, whatever - he doesn't know the difference.  They always taste amazing.  Love how little sugar there is - the slightly sweet flavour is just right.  5 stars all the way for this wonderfully versatile recipe!

Have been making this recipe for a few years now.  Love these..they are yummy and delicious.  I haven't changed a thing.  The only thing I do change with the pancake recipes is that I find it easier to make them on a lower heat setting...little less than medium....otherwise I tend to burn them :-O

Wonderful fall/winter pancake that is yummy all year long.  My husband who normally is only a buttermilk pancake lover had to admit that these were a keeper.  Made exactly to recipe...just topped them with toasted pecans, pure heated maple syrup and for those who wanted it...whipped cream.  Thanks, Ruth, for a great tasting pancake recipe!

These were so easy to make and delicious!!! I did add a little extra on the sugar, and added vanilla.  I did add and extra egg like another person had suggested. You really can't go wrong adding a little extra. Try these!!!

These pancakes are sooo good! All that spice made my house smell wonderful:) I added a bit of flaxseed to the mix, and I used canola oil rather than vegetable oil. I made cinnamon syrup (from this site) to top the pancakes. I will certainly make again! Thanks for sharing.

These were awesome!  I had a "long island cheese" pumpkin which produced 6 c of mashed pumpkin, so I was looking for things to do with it.  This was a GREAT choice!  I doubled the recipe and the only substitutions I made were using pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices, and lemon juice in place of vinegar.  The pancakes turned out perfectly fluffy and had this awesome creamy texture inside.  We served them with real maple syrup...wow.  Yum.

I did NOT try this recipe, but I wanted to give you this quick tip.  Krusteaz Buttermilk pancakes ("just add water"), the water, a couple of tablespoons of canned pumpkin, a couple shakes of pumpkin pie spice, and some chopped/broken pecans.  Serve with warm maple syrup.  You can do the same thing with mashed bananas & pecans!

I made these using pancake mix and added pecans!! OMG good! The shortcut of pancake mix made them so easy we had them on a school morning.

These were pretty good.  I'm not giving it a 5 stars due to personal taste.  They were really dense and I had to spread them after spooning it into the pan.  The flavor was really good though.  I think next time, I will add more milk.  They smelled amazing too.  Oh!  I almost forgot...I added 2 T. of ground flax seed instead of the oil.  I will make these again.

OMGsh!  Just started a family tradition with this recipe.  I do have to tell you that about 1 cup of chocolate chips make these out of this world!!  I made waffles with it.  To make it a little healthier, I used Splenda instead of the B.sugar and applesauce in place of the oil.  Be sure to spray your iron or griddle if you do substitute the oil.  I didn't have any allspice so I just added a little more cinnamon.  I have a family of 5 kids and 2 guest were over too.  Not one crumb was left.  Syrup wasn't really  needed either they were soooooo good!

I did not care for this recipe.  I make pancakes all the time and was excited at all the positive reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, and they would not cook in the middle. I listened to the reviews and used a spoon to spoon them and then spread them out in the pan.  I cooked them for way longer than I usually would and they were still not even cooked in the middle when I was done....I was very disappointed.

Delicious!  I love anything pumpkin and wanted to try them after having them at IHOP.  I followed the recipe, except for adding an additional egg (like other reviewers suggested).  The recipe makes a lot of pancakes.

I made these almost exactly as written - they are very fluffy and tender and delicious. The only changes I made were to add 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg because I love nutmeg, and to use melted butter instead of oil, because I love butter. I will be making these again and again.

WOW! Rave reviews from the whole family. Per other reviews I added an extra egg, 2 tsp. each powder & soda, and extra spices to suit my tastes, plus mini chocolate chips, cause that's how I roll.

sorry, but this was not good at all.  We couldn't get the middle to cook even flattening out and cooking till about burned.  I made it exactly as the recipe says.  It was very heavy pumpkin flavor, and very puffy, but they just wouldn't cook leaving a slime of pumpkin in the middle.

After having some really tasty pumpkin pancakes at IHOP, I wanted to try making them. This recipe is tasty. The only thing I did differently was add about 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar. I would like to find the syrup that IHOP uses with their cakes, but these taste great without anything extra. My 2 1/2 year old daughter and I noshed on these without butter or syrup.

Excellent.  The whole family loved these.  I did let it set for 5 minutes before cooking as other reviewers suggested.  They are quite fluffy and thick.  Make sure you spread the batter when putting it on the griddle.  I forgot to do that w/the 1st batch and some didnt get quite done in the middle.  Very easy and yummy.  I will be making these alot.

These are delicious.  When I went to my pantry, though, I realized I didn't have enough flour and made these with pancake mix as another reviewer suggested.  Excellent.  Definitely a keeper.

These were delicious. I was worried  that they were way too thick looking at the batter but followed reviewers' directions to suppress your instinct to thin the batter and to instead spread it with a spoon. This worked great and tasted wonderful. Thank you!

My husband like them but I wasn't thrilled.  I tasted the raw batter and felt it needed more pumpkin so I added 1/2 c. more.  Still didn't come near IHOP's.  But I froze what's left for my husband to enjoy.

Mmm Mmm! These are THE best pancakes I have ever made! I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the allspice because my family loves the flavor. I got my wisdom teeth pulled yesterday, so I was only able to eat a couple bites this morning but my very picky 12 year old and 9 year old LOVED these with some warm maple syrup!

great pancake recipe!! I left out the vinegar because my sister says it's not necessary. It just makes for a bit fluffier pancakes. but these were hearty and delicious! I also used organic pumpkin pie pumpkin in a can(which makes it a little bit easier to have pumpkin on hand) so I ldidnt need to add the spices. we all loved these, including my little girls! Pumpkin pancakes are thier favorite pancakes! Thanks for sharing!

I had no problems at all with the texture; they cooked up nicely with none of the issues other reviewers noted. My issue was with the overall taste. These just didn't have a great pumpkin flavor. I was  hoping for a pancake version of my favorite pumpkin drop cookie or pumpkin bread. These just didn't deliver. I'll keep searching for a great pumpkin pancake; this just isn't it.

So yummy with whipped cream!  I skipped the individual spices and put in two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice, and used butter milk instead of milk and vinegar.  This is a new comfort food for me!

What a nice seasonal treat!  With Maple Syrup... yummy!   RE the "soft in the middle" comments.  Just cook at a low temp(2.5 or 3 on an electric) vs.. a hot griddle.  They need longer to cook than a traditional pancake... probably due to the pumpkin.  Don't be afraid of the vinegar... you can't taste it at all and makes them fluffy (ever mixed soda and vinegar?).  Next time I think I would put the sugar in with the milk mix. b/c it's clumpy and hard to blend in without over beating.   Kids never suspected there was something healthy hidden inside!  I said they were "fall" pancakes!

Pretty good, for me not quite spicy enough, and somehow the pumpkin flavor gets lost when you put syrup on top...the batter was very thick...added some vanilla and did half whole wheat flour...will make again. Thank you!

I made these exactly as the recipe is written just a few days ago and they came out perfect.  I'm not sure I'll ever make regular pancakes again. Absolutely scrumptious.  They were a little squishy in the middle but it just seemed like a cross between pancakes and pumpkin pie and that's a good thing IMO.

Delicious! I made exactly as the recipe called for except I added a dash of vanilla. I used a non-stick cooking pan so using any oil (I sprayed PAM) made the pancakes flat and greasy so definitely don't use any oil in a non-stick pan. I topped with whipped cream and pumpkin spice sprinkled on top. Will use this recipe many times!

This is a GREAT recipe for perfectly fluffy pumpkin pancakes.  I did half white flour, half white whoe wheat flour, and they were delicious.  I had pumpkin pie spice, so I did one tsp. of that plus one tsp. of cinnamon. Great recipe I will use again and again. Thanks!

As is, these should be named gingerbread pancakes. They are good, but I was expecting pumpkin to be the dominate flavor. Next time I will omit the ginger and stick with pumpkin pie spice. I also used 1/4 cup brown sugar, perfect sweetness.

Exactly what I was looking for.  I used buttermilk instead of milk and vinegar (sour milk and buttermilk can be interchanged), these were fantastic!  Eat with a little heated real maple syrup.

These were really delicious and super simple to make.  To us, they tasted just like pumpkin pie.  I like them plain because they are sweet enough as is but DH likes the traditional butter and syrup route.  I believe maple syrup just covers up the pumpkin taste.  Very good!

These were pretty good. I love everything pumpkin and spice. I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose so that required me to add a few extra tablespoons of milk to get the correct batter consistency. I added dark chocolate chips to ours and topped with whipped cream, pure maple syrup, and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

I made these for the husband and kids and they were a big hit.  At first, they were coming out kind of spongy, like some of the other reviewers said in their feedback.  I found that you really have to let them cook longer than normal pancakes.  When you see the bubbles (which is a good indication with normal pancakes that it's time to flip), you should wait another minute or two.  They really crisp up beautifully and the taste is phenomenal if they're cooked thoroughly.

I love these, but I would have to say plain maple syrup doesn't do them justice. There's a really simple recipe on this web page for cinnamon syrup that makes the pumpkin flavor really pop :) Yum! I've been told that bay leaf, oddly enough, makes pumpkin taste more ''pumpkiny', so I'm trying to think of a way to try that out with this recipe. I've made it several times and plan to start playing with it a little to see how it comes out - but they're Phenomenal exactly as is too.  I'm going to try nutmeg and cloves while leaving out the allspice. I also want to try kefir (it's like a drinkable yogurt) in place of the milk and leave out the vinegar since the kefir has lots of lactic acid from the beneficial bacteria.

I made these exactly as written.  It's a thickish batter, yes, but I prefer a thick puffy pancake to flat ones anyway.  And if you use the 1/4 cup as stated in the recipe and spread it a bit, they should get done in the middle.  They are not big pancakes.  Made this way I got 14 of them.  I'd say this is anywhere from 4 to 6 servings depending on how much you want.  (Only 4 compared to a restaurant serving.)  They are subtle and not over-sweet, so don't expect sweet.   (The description says "barely-sweetened"!)  I prefer them this way and put nothing but some butter on them.  I think syrup ruins pancakes.  So why the 4? - well, cause they were pretty good but nothing grand.  I generally like pumpkin stuff & have never had pumpkin pancakes so thought I'd give them a try.  Seems like a good way to sneak in some veggie - the kids shouldn't notice.  (Though it seems to defeat the purpose just pouring sugar all over them.)

Ive made these twice and im so glad i gave it another go. The first time i made them i think the batter was a bit too runny so the pancakes came out a litttle thin to my liking but i cut back on the liquid and they came out great. I used whole wheat pancake mix to and added chopped pecans to the mix and they were SOOOOOOO GOOOOD!!! Try them, they are just delicious!

This is my most popular go-to pancake and waffle recipe. Turns out great every time. I occasionally will add more cinnamon and a dash of ground cloves. To send this over the top, I blend softened Smart Balance, honey, and cinnamon to top these with. Rarely do I even want to add pure maple syrup, but it still tastes wonderful with the extra sweetness. I have to say, though, that using fake syrups (as I call them) just make this too sickeningly sweet and take away from the wholesome ingredients. Plus, the store-bought pancake syrups are all HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) and can never taste as good as pure honey or pure maple syrup, which you'll use less of anyway because they're stronger in flavor for less product. Just my opinion though! Anyway, try these!

I followed this recipe as stated with the exception of using pumpkin pie spice to replace the individual spices.  This was a hit with my entire family.  They froze and reheated well (about 1 minute in the microwave from a frozen state).

Outstanding recipe!!  My husband is a pancake aficionado and he absolutely loved these pancakes.  Very hearty flavor.  Just slightly crisp on the outside but tender and fluffy inside.  I sprinkled some granola on the first side for added texture.  He was in pancake heaven!

I halved the recipe but kept the egg and spices the same (plus a little nutmeg).  It made 7 pancakes for me.  I did spread them out a little to make them a little thinner once I put the batter on the skillet.  It's like pumpkin pie for breakfast without the guilt!  I spread some pumpkin butter on them and added maple syrup for my first go-round.  For my "seconds" I spread some peanut butter on top and then the maple syrup.  Both times were great.

I made these today with some left over pumpkin I had in the fridge.  They were pretty tasty, although the first couple I cooked weren't quite done in the center because the batter was so thick.  I added about 1/4 cup more milk and after that they were fine.  I probably make these again, but I think next time I'll double up on the cinnamon, perhaps add a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, and a little vanilla.

Could hardly taste anything but vinegar, to the point that I was convinced that I had incorrectly copied the recipe and it was supposed to be teaspoons instead.  But I could taste just enough of what the flavor was supposed to be to know that it would be well-worth making again -- but with less vinegar!

Awesome recipe (made it from scratch and using someone's suggestion that involved using pancake mix)... my son requests is almost every morning!  I just make a bunch of batter, then pour whatever I don't use that morning in a gallon baggie, put it in the fridge, and cut the corner off to pour pancakes the next morning!

I used this recipe to get an idea on how much pumpkin and spices to add to my regular pancake recipe and with a few adjustments it really turned out great. I used 1 3/4 c. flour, 1/8 c. brn sgr, 1/8 c. wht sgr, 2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt, 2 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 1/2 c. milk, 1 c. pumpkin & 4 tbs melted butter. Thanks for helping me tweak my basic pancake recipe!

Delicious!  I did make a few changes, though.  Like previous reviewers suggested, I used 2 eggs rather than 1.  I also used 1 cup wheat flour & 1 cup white.  For the spices I used: 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. allspice, 1 tsp. cardamom, and 1/2 tsp. ginger.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla extract and 1 cup chopped pecans.  They were exquisite!  I'll definitely be making these again.

Great flavor and relatively easy.  One tip though...I have learned that a lot of things taste better with buttermilk so instead of the milk and vinegar (which is often substituted if buttemilk not available) use buttermilk.  I had to add a little more than called for with milk plus vinegar to get right consistency.  But the seasonings along with fresh pumpkin and buttermilk was yummy!

The only thing I changed was halving the cinnamon and allspice. I put in 1/2 tsp of pumpkin spice. Absolutely fabulous! DH doesn't like pumpkin, but he like these pancakes and two little thumbs-ups from my DD. Thanks for sharing!!!

I only give 4 stars because I modified the recipe as suggested and then it was 5! Made these for Halloween morning and they were amazing. Used evaporated milk and bisquick instead of flour.

I liked the less-sweetness aspect of this recipe.  There was enough pumpkin flavor, but I used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  It needed just a touch more spice.  I don't know if I will make them again, but i enjoyed them for breakfast today.

Wonderful!  I replaced 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat flour and added some ground flax seed.  I then had to add some more milk to make the batter the right consistency.  I doubled the cinnamon and they came out so fluffy and tasty!

Yum! My 6 and 2 year old girls gobbled these up. I made as directed except I swapped the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour. If you top with a tiny sprinkling of cinnamon & sugar, syrup and if you are feeling really indulgent some whipped cream, you'll have quite the breakfast (or dinner) treat!

Loved it!  My husband is not a pumpkin lover, but these had just enough pumpkin flavor for him to have seconds and request that I make them again.  Subbed half wheat flour, applesauce for oil, and used pumpkin pie spice in place of the individual spices.  Froze the leftovers and the kids and I have had them for breakfast during the week.  One thing I loved about this recipe is the servings is true to what I got.  Most times I have to double pancakes recipes to get enough for us.

These were delicious!  I used a 50/50 blend of whole wheat and white flour, 2 small eggs, a bit more brown sugar and added a tsp of vanilla.  The batter is thick but I had no problem once I poured it on to the griddle.  I will make these again and again!

We didn't care for the allspice/ginger combination in these pancakes. It gave it an odd aftertaste, and kept the sweetness from coming through. I will be making these again because I think the recipe has potential, but I will be decreasing the allspice/ginger, and would add some white sugar.

Yummy! Often add nutmeg and cloves too.  I usually increase the spices and double the whole recipe so that I can freeze leftovers to have on hand.  I use whole wheat flour as well. I serve this with warmed apple sauce, real maple syrup and toasted walnuts or pecans on top.  Sometimes go all out with whipping cream too.

This is a great seasonal treat. Less doughy than traditional pancakes.  I made a slightly healthier version.  I substituted soy milk for milk and used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose.  I will make these again for sure.

I made a batch of these this morning and the whole family liked them. They were so thick and puffy! I made a few health modifications by replacing the brown sugar with Splenda Brown Sugar Blend. I also used two egg whites rather than one whole egg. I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour. Finally, I cut the oil to 1 tablespoon and used a tablespooon of unsweetened applesauce as well. I measured the batter by 1/4 cup as stated and this recipe made 16 pancakes. I love pumpkin, so if I were to make these to my tastes, I'd add more pumpkin puree, but the less-pumpkin-loving members of the family thought they were just right.

Made this with half regular and half whole wheat flour, as well as only egg whites. Turned out great! Like others said, the batter is thick. Simply use 1/4 cup to pour and spread it out on the griddle. Turns out nice and fluffy.

My grand son (as well as the rest of my family)loves these pancakes.I have also tweaked the recipe by using the whole 15 oz can of pumpkin,so there isn't any left over.I use half whole wheat flour half white add a1/3 cup milled flax seed.I also add more milk as needed.I mix it the night before except for the vinegar which I add while I am waiting for the skillet to warm up.I like mine topped with apple butter.IHOP can't touch these!

We really liked these. The first time I made them some turned out mushy, especially at the end when the pan was really heated up. I made them again, smaller and at a lower temperature and they turned out great. Also, I added more pumpkin and cinnamon just for personal taste. They also freeze well and when heated up in the oven I think taste even better than the first time.

Absolutely delicious! I used fresh pumpkin - steamed (not boiled) & pureed in a blender. I followed the recipe exactly and these pancakes got rave reviews. Will definately be making these again. And again...and again.

These are the best pumpkin pancakes ever! The only thing I did differently was to add 1/4 c packed brown sugar instead of 3 T(because I like my sweetness in the pancake, not on top of it), and to use Silk eggnog instead of milk. This didn't hurt the recipe at all, and in fact added a little extra something. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent use of the last bit of cooked, pureed pumpkin from the Turkey Day cheesecake. Moist, dense, delicious pancakes. Sure to become a traditional post-feast breakfast favorite in my home.

Batter was definitely thick. Added more milk & it watered down the pumpkin flavor. Next time I'll make the recipe as is & spread the pancake batter out w/spatula on pan.

I almost didn't try this recipe after reading all the reviews about the batter not cooking, etc.  Glad I decided to try it.
I mixed the batter in my Kitchen Aid and had no problem with the consistency.  Once the batter was in the pan, just a little shake evened it out.  NOTE:  You need to cook this batter over a medium-low heat.  Pancakes turned out perfect and even my kids loved them.  Mmmmmmmm :)

These are amazing!! The best pancakes I have ever eaten.  Used egg substituted instead of egg, also used pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice because I didn't have any.  We also cut the batch in 1/2 and it made 5 good sized pancakes, perfect amount for about 2 people.  Yum yum yum!!

Yummy!  What a wonderful recipe.  My husband and I loved these pancakes.  Definitely a keeper.  I did follow other reviews and only added 1 tsp. vanilla to the wet mixture and substituted 1 TBSP Pumpkin Pie spice for the other spices.  I did that only because I didn't feel like measuring the others out.  Lazy!  Definitely spread the batter out with a back of a spoon!  EVERYONE MUST TRY THESE!  It's like eating pumpkin pie for breakfast.

These pancakes were unbelievable.  I substituted 1 c. whole wheat flour and increased brown sugar by 1 Tbsp.  Also had no allspice so subbed 1/2 additional tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. clove, and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  My picky eaters wolfed them down--great way to get whole grains and a little vegetable matter into your kids. =)

Awesome & filling!  Stored well in the fridge.  I mixed some cream cheese with maple syrup and powdered sugar for a frosting to make the leftovers a good portable Car Breakfast!

These were good. I followed the directions, but still tweaked it. I used about 1 3/4 c of 2% milk, 2 eggs (since so many recommended them not sure if I need another though), red wine vinegar since it was all I had (you couldn't taste it), I had to really add more spices since it was kinda dull without them, I added a tsp of vanilla, and sprinkled them with cinnamon and sugar before flipping them. I cooked them on medium heat. They don't bubble up so be careful or they might burn. I served them with maple syrup. This made 10 good size size fluffy pancakes. Will make again but with more spices. Thanks

Wow! These pancakes are very good. The batter is very thick but if you spread them out on the pan, they cook just fine. The pancakes have the perfect pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice flavor. They were a hit with my family. I have made another double batch to freeze for breakfast for the kids this week.

What a great breakfast we had this morning. A few strips of bacon served with these pancakes was perfect. I put together the dry ingredients the night before so it was quick to make up the batter this morning. The first few pancakes were a little thicker than I like so I thinned the batter with 1/4 cup milk. The pumpkin and spice flavour sparkled in this recipe. It wasn't overpowering at all. I served these with real maple syrup. Really yummy. Everyone enjoyed them. I do have some left over which I have stored in the fridge for heating up tomorrow. Thanks for a new autumn favourite. It's wonderful.

These were great. I served them with warm maple syrup with cinnamon and butter added to it. Definately tastes like fall.

AMAZING!!  I made these just as is and they were perfect.  I served them with the Cinnamon Creme Syrup found on this site and it was a match made in heaven.  One suggestion: don't pour the syrup on the pancakes directly.  Dip them in the syrup just before eating.  The pancakes soak up the syrup so fast you don't taste it as much when you pour it on.

Excellent!  I made half a batch, but still used a whole egg.  My batter seemed a bit thick so I just added a little water.  Very flavorful, beautiful color and nice, fluffy texture.  Will definitely make these again!

This recipe is really delicious and really forgiving. I wanted to make something different and I had pumpkin in the pantry, so I tried it and I'm so glad I did! I added some chocolate chips which I didn't feel all that bad about since there is very little sugar. Wonderful! My 2 year old is gobbling them up as I type.

It's a fantastic recipe.  I substituted homemade pumpkin butter for the pumpkin and spices.  I highly recommend letting the batter sit before using.  The ones at the end of the batch were beautiful!

I used a gluten free flour combination of: 1 cup Buckwheat Flour, 1/4 cup Amaranth Flour, and 3/4 cup Oat Flour. I also used 2 egg whites in place of the egg, splenda in place of the sugar, and omitted the oil. I ended up with a delicious hearty, healthy pancake!

This is a great recipe, and I used whole wheat flower and nixed the oil, just using twice the amount of pumpkin instead. Very healthy and yummy!

Call me a Gamlber but I sevved these to a breakfeast party of six without a tring them first. I warmed the maple suyrp, served with a side of bannanas, kwie, and strawberries, used the leftover strawberries to make mimosa's. The only change I made was slightly more milk, and cinnamon. I could not get a picture as they dissapeared so quickly, I feel sure someone would have bitten my are off if I slowed them down to get photo. What a Hit.

These are our new household fave!!! I found that I need to add about 1/3-1/2 cup more milk to the batter as it is very thick - but they turn out great every time I make them! Fluffy and thick - amazing with maple syrup from our own sugar bush! I top mine with real whipping cream, maple syrup and a vanilla/sugar grinder - amazing - I can't say enough about them - my mother-in-law raves about them to all of her friends! These will not disappoint!

Delicious!   After making a couple of batches of these wonderful pancakes I added a little more oil, about a tsp., a little more salt and I used pumpkin pie spice, 1 tbsp.  Also, I used 1 c. of silk nogg, or egg nog is fine too, and 1/2 c. 1 % milk.  This gave it a wonderful subtle flavor.
The pancakes are wonderful ~ not mushy in the middle like most pumpkin pancakes I've had...very delicious, my fave pancake recipe!

I used vanilla soymilk and these came out fantastic.  The batter was very thick but I scooped them out with 1/4 measure and they cooked up into nice thick pancakes.  Yum, thanks for the recipe!

After reading other reviews, I altered mine a bit. I doubled the recipe for my big family, but instead of doubling the pumpkin to 2 cups, I used 1.5 cups. The batter was therefore less heavy and had a nice texture. I also turned down the heat by 50 degrees and edged it up so I could control cooking speed. I also adjusted seasonings to my taste--just cinnamon and nutmeg, as we prefer. And as I usually do with pancakes, I used half all-purpose flour and half soft whole wheat flour. I make my own maple syrup with maple flavor extract and threw in a little cinnamon. Five stars for this filling, tasty treat!

So yummy! I made homemade pumpkin puree with a cooking pumpkin (Baby Bear) by washing the outside, cutting it in half vertically, scooping out the stringy insides (you can roast the seeds if desired!), put it in a microwave-safe dish with an inch or two of water, cover, microwave on high for 15-25 minutes until tender, scoop the flesh out of the skin, and puree with an emersion blender/regular blender/hand mixer. I cut the cinnamon down by about half (both my daughter and husband are allergic) and I let the batter sit for five or ten minutes before cooking the pancakes. The leftover pancakes were cooled and frozen - pop them in the microwave or toaster for a quick and delicious breakfast! Thanks for sharing, Ruth!

Wow!!  My whole family LOVED these!  I had some spaghetti squash that turned out more of a puree than spaghetti, so I used that instead of pumpkin.  Delicious!  My youngest was hesitant, took a tiny bite and proceeded to down four hearty pancakes!

Very easy to make and good texture. However, they were not sweet enough, so I'd recommend adding some white sugar.

So awesome!  I used soy milk instead of regular, and it was fine.  Like others suggested, I used the back of a spoon to spread the batter, and it worked really well.  Served with a fruit salad, this made WAY too much for my family of three.  So, I cooked the extras into pancakes, and froze them.  Now, we just pop one or two in the toaster in the morning for breakfast.  Really great recipe!

Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for sharing this recipe! Whenever I make pancakes they are always rubbery - but with this recipe, my pancakes were finally a succes!!! Must have been the addition of vinegar. These are light and fluffy - just how I like my pankcakes! I also tried this with sweet potato puree and it came out just as wonderful.

These were not the fluffy pancake that I was hoping for.  They were very heavy and dense.  I even added more milk to thin the batter out.  Don't think I make them again...thanks anyway!

These were great.  I used kabocha (Japanese pumpkin) puree and cooked at a lower temperature like many suggested.  They turned out very moist, but I had no problems with inadequate cooking.  If you're expecting a pumpkin pie type flavor, you'll definitely need to increase the spices, but I really enjoyed the mild spicing with maple syrup.

Great recipe, not really enough spices for us, next time I will use pumpkin pie spice and add a little more milk to thin it out some more.  All in all very good pancakes.

Perfect pancakes!! Just the right texture, very tasty, my husband and three kids all LOVED these pancakes! Only one thing I changed: I didn't have any allspice, so I substituted a little ground cloves and nutmeg and extra ginger.

Delicioius and easy to make.  I used 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon, allspice and ginger.  The batter was thick, which I like. After pouring the batter on the griddle, I sprinkled each pancake with pecans.  The pancakes were light, fluffy and flavorful.   I will make this recipe for company in the future.

This recipe is like warm Pumpkin Pie for breakfast.  My family absolutely loves it.  We love to serve it with diced bananas and whipped cream.  We also found that the batter is even better the next day because the spices are all stronger and more flavorful.  We always substitute applesauce for the oil and it tastes great and is a little healthier.  Yum yum!!!

This is fabulous!  I printed out so many pancake recipes and I have no interest in trying the rest of them.  I substituted oat flour (grind oatmeal in blender), put in 2 1/2 cups milk, and a tsp pumpkin pie spice.  Great with the maple syrup, great with whipped cream and the maple syrup, great reheated in the microwave and thats a good thing cause there's a lot of batter and only 2 of us.  Although my husband ate 3 big ones.

I thought these were awesome.  I love pumpkin and I love pancakes, and these were good.  Perfect for a cold morning or even dinner.  The batter does need to be thinned with milk, and you have to cook them slowly so they are done in the center.

I'm sorry to be this way, but....

These pancakes were a disappointment.  The thickness of the pancakes was a MAJOR issue.  No matter what I did, I couldn't seem to produce a pancake with a "done" center.  I tried many of the things suggested by other reviewers (add LOTS of milk, cook for longer, etc.), but I was still unsuccessful.

Although one could argue that this recipe was tasty, I think its record of producing thoroughly cooked pancakes earns this recipe a poor rating.  (I'm just glad I made a "dry run" with this recipe before I tried to serve it to hungry relatives.

Excellent recipe. I made it exactly and cooked them a little longer than regular pancakes. They are quite heavy.  My family is very happy with these pancakes.  We will definitely make these again.

followed exact recipe.  very nice change, great for company.  not sure about the "fluffy" comments made by others.  Mine came out very heavy and thick.  Make sure you cook until the center is done.  They took a little longer to cook than plain pancakes because of the thickness.  I will thin with more milk next time.

Quite good, but even with adding another 1/2 c of milk the batter was still awfully thick. Had to pat the pancakes down in order to get the middle cooked through. Very hearty and filling, my kids loved them too. We stuck the left overs in a ziploc bag in the fridge and popped them in the toaster for breakfast the rest of the week.

These are absolutely delectable, especially served hot with real maple syrup. The next time I make this, I'll either cut back on flour by about 1/2 cup or increase the milk... the batter was so thick and heavy that it couldn't be poured.

I dislike pumpkin pie and refuse to make or buy it for the holidays but my family loves it.  I thought I'd compromise and make these instead. My family loved these and anyone who likes pumpkin pie would and should try these.  I would have given this 5 stars because these pancakes were well received in our house but I couldn't eat more than a bite...sorry, I just don't like pumpkin! But my family tells me they're VERY good and I'm sure if I was a pumpkin lover, I would have loved these too.  Thanks for the unique thanksgiving breakfast Ruth!

If I could give this recipe more stars, I would.  These pancakes were awesome.  We had them one Saturday morning. The next day I woke up to my boyfriend making them again!
The only thing I would suggest is to add a little more pumpkin than what the recipe has.

These definitely satisfied my early-fall pumpkin craving. I didn't have allspice, but they still tasted fine. The final product was a bit heavy, though. Plan on fewer pancakes per serving than you would with a standard pancake recipe.

I love pumpkin recipes, and this is a good one! I am horrible at cooking pancakes, they either burn or are raw inside - especially when making thick pancakes like these.  They came out thick and fluffy, didn't burn, and were well cooked in the middle.  I also love the minimal amount of sugar used - who needs more when you're just going to smother them in sweet syrup?  Also good as a dessert base topped with pumpkin custard, ice cream, whipped cream etc.

I felt the pancakes were a little bland.  I added one tablespoon of brown sugar and more cinnamon to the batter.  my kids gave me mixed reviews.  The older ones like it the younger ones hardly ate a bite. I must have done something wronge.  I'll try it again.

This recipe is downright terrible. Let me preface with saying that if you NEED auto tweak a recipe to make it work, then you canât say itâs a good one. They came out WAY too thick. I had to add so much extra liquid to get it to spread. The taste is mediocre and the texture was doughy. Iâm very sad that I wasted my time and ingredients on this recipe

These turned out really good.  The only changes I made was to use almost the whole can of pumpkin and did not measure spices and added nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice to it.  My son loved these.

Very yummy! I added an extra 1/3 cup of pumpkin and added a little extra cinnamon. I also substituted 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground cloves, and a pinch of ground nutmeg in place of the teaspoon of all spice. Pancakes were a hit!

Always test the first pancake, usually gets better or perfect the second or third batch.  These where great. Light and fluffy.  The missus says "delicious".   She was worried it would taste to "pumpkiny"...if that's a word.  Followed the recipe exactly but added a little more milk to loosen the batter at the end cause it seemed to thick.  And don't over stir, it creates gluten.

We love these! I usually make them into small (silver dollar sized) pancakes, then freeze them on a cookie sheet. After they are frozen I transfer them to a ziplock bag and keep them in the freezer. Makes for a super easy, quick breakfast! We just grab out however many we need,  throw them in the toaster oven, and viola! Weekday mornings run a little smoother!

This was delicious.  I love to cook, but pancakes have always been my husband's thing, so it was only the second time I have made pancakes.  I always have leftover pumpkin, being a pumpkin fan, and this recipe was excellent.  The only items I changed were using  almond milk and coconut oil.

This recipe is great!! Couple changes I made: recipe calls for allspice and ginger (didn't have any of either!), you can use pumpkin pie spice and halve the cinnamon. Also recipe says medium high heat, I had to turn it down much lower to medium low/medium or they came off the griddle pan burnt/raw in the middle.

Wow these were so good! Followed as written. Took the advise of others and used a spoon to spread out batter on grittle, worked just fine. Batter is thick, just took a little longer to cook. Family loved them, will make again. Thanks

I love this pancake recipe! I've made it twice. Once with canned and the other with fresh pumpkin. Both were excellent. This has a lighter, moister texture than the typical pancake, so don't be fooled by the thick batter. I made a few adjustments as recommend. Added 1 1/3 cup pumpkin, 1 tbsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg as well. I keep the vingar since it aides the rise, and I've also subbed buttermilk for milk before (no milk on hand that morning). Didn't add vingar when using buttermilk and the results were still the same. Also used 5 tbsp of brown sugar and folded in the dry to the wet. Folding is key to achieve a light, fluffy pancake.

I made the recipe per the instructions and found the middles of the pancakes were too moist to be considered good.

Delicious!! Even when I substituted one cup of flour with one cup of chick pea flour to up the nutrition it was still awesome... This recipe is a keeper :)

Lots of ingredients and they take a while to make but my son loves them and it saves us a trip to IHOP. It makes a lot of batter so you can have them on more than one morning.
Not sure why so many people modify the recipe so drastically then review.  That isn't a true review of THIS recipe if you change the ingredients.  Just post your own recipe somewhere else.

I love this recipe. I didn't have any pumpkin puree in my pantry this a.m., so instead I pureed a banana. The pancakes came out perfect! Yummy and satisfying.

Flavor is superb!  Batter is too thick.   One reviewer advised not to thin with milk because it would take away on the pumpkin flavor so next time I make these I will reduce the flour to 1.5 c. and adjust as needed.

These are my changes: 
1-1/2 cups milk, 1-1/3 cups pumpkin puree, 2 eggs, 2 T. veg oil, 2 cups flour, 3 T brown sugar, 2 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. baking soda, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, pinch of cloves, 1/2 tsp. salt,  1/2 tsp. pumpkin spice.  I actually put all the wet ingredients in a bowl and whisked them, then did the same with all the dry ingredients...then folded them together and gently whisked them with a metal whisk.  Make sure you leave them on the griddle long enough to cook  through since they are thicker.  KILLER PANCAKES!!!  Super pumpkin flavor.

These pancakes were awesome!!  I was hesitant about the vinegar, but I think when combined with the baking soda, it made them very fluffy.  Be sure to not overdid the batter and cook at a little lower temperature so that the pancake cooks completely. Very Yummy!

I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices, and upped the total amount to a few Tbls, and used a whole can of pumpkin. We loved these. So awesome on a winter weekend morning!

Delicious!  I was looking for a sweet potato pancake recipe but didn't want the work of cooking/peeling the potatoes (and had a can of pumpkin in the pantry).  Looked at the modifications in a few reviews and modified a bit:  added an extra egg, used a whole can of pumpkin (about 1 3/4 cups), added nutmeg and some pumpkin pie spice (instead of individual amounts of allspice & ginger), extra cinnamon, used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and left out the vinegar.  These are thick, so they take a while to cook, but SOOOO worth it!  Moist and yummy.

I rarely eat pancakes, but this recipe sounded too good to pass up.  I followed the recipe as written, but I did add some chopped pecans and chocolate chips to the batter.  While I thought the flavors were good, the pancakes were way too mushy (almost raw) in the middle. I'm not sure how my additions would have contributed to the pancakes not being cooked through.

This is my family's favorite pancake/waffle recipe. These get gobbled up so quickly that I double the batch. I never seem to have allspice on hand so I add nutmeg and ground cloves. A cream cheese "cheesecake" spread is our preferred topping.

This was great! I made no changes to the recipe since I like to see what the original is all about.  Very thick batter; I was tempted to add a bit of milk before I read the reviews that warned: don't! The only change I will make next time is to increase the amount of spices.  Otherwise, perfect!

I just made these pancakes as written & loved them. I prefer more spices for next time. I did top them with the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup ( on this site)Just be sure to use a large pan so you don't have a big mess. I also roasted some pecan pieces for the top. Awesome! I had left over pumpkin so made pumpkin spice tea latte.

This recipe needs a lot of tweaking to come out right.  My first attempt I followed the recipe exactly...it was way too thick, and fairly flavorless.  (no idea how people are giving it four stars!)

The second batch I added the entire can of pumpkin.  It was still too thick, and I had to add an extra cup of water/milk mixture to thin it out to appropriate pancake consistency.  Even then, it never cooks right.  The middle stays pretty mooshy (likely due to the abundance of pumpkin puree, which unfortunately is the only thing giving it flavor).  I can tolerate the mooshy middle, but if you like to make pancakes and store for the week...I can't imagine these would hold up well.  

I'm not making a third attempt.  I'll just find a difference recipe.

We loved these pancakes! I added some to the recipe after reading a lot of the reviews. I used 2 C. almond breeze for the milk just because I had it to use up. I added 1/2 C. quick oats, 4 T applesauce,and 1 t pumpkin pie spice. That made a nice,thick and airy pancake. I added mini chocolate chips to my granddaughter's and chopped,toasted walnuts with  Craisins for my daughter and myself. Those were awesome! I'm still thinking about them.  Reminded me of First Watch pancakes-yummy! I'll make'em again for sure!

This Pumpkin Pancake recipe is a winner! My only comment is I thought the batter was too thick after I mixed it all together. I added, by eye w/o measuring about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of milk until the batter got to the consistency I felt would be easy to work with. Next time I'll probably add more milk to make it even thinner. The taste was PHENOMENAL!

These pancakes turned out awesome! I didn't have allspice so I substituted with ground cloves instead. Thank you so much!

A hearty pancake. I added chocolate chips, Yum!! I did think the pumpkin flavor wasn't as pronounced as I'd like it to be, but it was still delicious.

Had to make minor modifications, mostly because of what I had on hand. Subbed 1/2c of Soy Flour because I ran short on regular flour. I also used 2-1/2tsp Pumpkin Spice for the combo of cinnamon, allspice and ginger. Also used Almond Milk (unsweetened, vanilla). However even with these super minor changes, I don't think they affected the integrity of the recipe and hubs was super happy with it! This made a total of 22 pancakes (used 1/4c scoop to get even pancakes). Consistency was very silky, and they puffed up nicely. Very hearty, which was perfect. I did add a small handful of chopped walnuts to mine, although I didn't think it added anything. Just nice to have the crunch. We'll definitely make these again and will experiment with adding different things (granola, different nuts in the batter, dried cranberries, the possibilities are endless!). Thanks!!

I made these for my family over the Thanksgiving holiday and everyone raved about them!  The only thing I did a little different from the original recipe was add almost the whole can of pumpkin puree into the mix.  I felt a cup was too little.  Other than that, it's our new favorite pumpkin recipe!

Great pancakes.  I used fresh pumpkin puree and plain kefir (like buttermilk) instead of milk/vinager.  They turned out so nice and fluffy and full of flavor.  I added a little cloves (because I accidentally thought I had grabbed allspice, but thought why not!) and nutmeg (because it's good) and it was a great mix of flavor.

I added ground walnuts and used half wheat flour.  These changes thickened the batter so I thinned it a bit with water but the result was delicious and made about 20 small to medium pancakes.

This recipe is awesome! I resisted the temptation to thin the batter and just spread it out with the back of a spoon. Fluffy, melt in your mouth results. I did grate in a little fresh nutmeg with the dry ingredients, but otherwise didn't change a thing. Wonderful!

This was my first time making home made pancakes without a box mix. WOW. These are absolutely delicious!!! They are light, fluffy,  and hearty all at once!!! I made some changes since I didn't have all the ingredients. I didn't have milk so I used 1 cup buttermilk and half a cup of evaporated milk. I only used 1 Tbsp vinegar since I used buttermilk. I also added an additional tbsp of brown sugar, 1 tbsp white sugar, nutmeg, clove and pumpkin pie spice. These seriously taste like the consistency of IHOP pancakes which are my favorite!!! I was going to attempt a cream cheese glaze but decided to stick with IHOP syrup (which can be found at Walmart..you're welcome)

I've made them 3 times now and I can't get them to cook right. They have a wet texture, cook longer and then they are hard to cut apart with a fork and taste tough. 
I would love some advice, wish this was like amazon reviews where you can post a question and get an answer.

Delicious! I noted some folks say to cut back on the milk. I had some half and half that was approaching its expiration date, so I used that. I didn't measure, I just added as needed to get a thick pancake batter consistency. I'm thinking chopped nuts for the batter or topping would really work nicely.

I'm a pancake and maple syrup snob - grew up making our own maple syrup on our farm. These are hands down the best pancakes I've ever had. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and an half teaspoon of nutmeg. Great seasonal treat!

One of the best pancake recipes I've ever made. These are fluffy, fragrantly spiced, and reminiscent of gingerbread. This is the kind of recipe I'll make forever and pass down to my kids one day.

Amazing! I used 2% milk, whole wheat flour by choice, and I had to use white sugar and omit the allspice (because I didn't have any brown sugar or allspice) and they were still AMAZING. I spread the batter with a spatula or spoon once you put them on the griddle instead of thinning the batter. SO good, all of my kids (ages 2, 4 & 7) had seconds!

To be fair, I don't love pumpkins, so someone else might have made this a five. The pancakes were light and fluffy, they were spicy in a good way, and they were very filling. The recipe made way more than enough for my family.

I made this for the first time for my husbands birthday and he LOVED IT!  I didn't substitute anything but I forgot to buy all spice so I did the pancakes without it an it still came out great :) I am curious to see how it taste with nutmeg in the recipe . Maybe next time I will try that :)

I tripled the recipe because I make huge batches of pancakes and freeze them for easy breakfasts/snacks for my teenager.  I also added maple syrup into the batter and a little bit of salt.  Super yummy

Very good.  They were a bit heavy, so next time I'm going with the 2nd egg as recommended by another reviewer.  I also think the spices need to be kicked up a little bit.... so I'll either increase them, or use fresher pumpkin pie spice as recommended by another reviewer.  While this recipe still needs tweaks for perfection, it is pretty darn close as it is!!!  Great breakfast.  I served sprinkled with toasted pecans and real maple syrup.

Fantastic as is and SO easy!
The only think I sometimes change is I use half whole wheat flour instead of all white and they still come out great. We always double it and eat any leftover the next day, warm or cold.

These pancakes are very thick. Cook them slowly, over a lower heat than one would normally use with pancakes. My family loved them.

This recipe makes tasty fluffy pancakes. I tweeked the method slightly. I combined the milk and vinegar and let rest for 15 minutes and then added the baking soda to this before adding to other wet ingredients.

I doubled the recipe and used the pumpkin pie filling instead of the 100% puree. I also ended up using the whole large can of pumpkin which made the pancakes even more amazing.

This recipe was very good. I gave it a 4 star rating, because the batter was soooo thick. I thinned it down with 1/2-3/4 C. milk. I used almond milk, which is what I use for everything. It was still thick, but wow, what amazing flavor!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!  So fluffy and delicious. Only change I made was put in pumpkin pie spice instead of all spice and ginger.  Our neighbor comes over for breakfast when I make them because, in his words,"they are to die for"!!  Give them a try--you won't be sorry!

The first time I made these they weren't very good. The pumpkin made them too thick and heavy. I tried again following rokzane's suggestions....wet ingredients in the food processor, spreading out the batter, and using pumpkin pie spice. They turned out perfect! Light and fluffy and exactly what I was looking for on a cool, fall morning. My kids devoured them too!

I tried making this two different times. I even tried a lot of the suggestions, such as adding more milk, and different spices. What I found was that these were so extremely fluffy, that they would not cook all the way through. I even added HALF the amount of baking soda and powder that the original recipe called for. Also--I had to add about twice the amount of milk to even get them to a good consistency. That pretty much killed any flavor the pancakes had.

This recipe is only half way good if you do tweak so many things which doesn't make a 5 star recipe in my book.  We made this recipe as is and nobody at them and nobody liked the weird spongy texture.  The flavor was bland and off.  I cook homemade pancakes every Saturday morning and we tried this one twice and we are done with it.

We love pumpkin pancakes and these were not good. They were very mushy and had very little flavor. I also had to add probably an extra cup of milk to even get the batter at a consistency that was able to be put onto a griddle.. After looking at some other recipes, I think this one has way too much pumpkin purÃ©e in it. I think I'll stick to the Trader Joes boxed mix

After we poured the batter onto the griddle, we sprinkled chocolate chips on top.  Fantastic!  We didn't even use syrup.  My kids called them pancake cookies.  :)

These are DELICIOUS. I made them almost as written, just changing the spices a little. I used 1 tablespoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg. They were fluffy and had the perfect pumpkin flavor (I used fresh). Even my picky 3 year old ate all that I gave him and asked for more! I have saved this as my favorite pumpkin pancake recipe after trying many, many different ones!

Yesterday I thought, "Oh,I want pancakes for breakfast"! I had everything on hand, except I forgot to add the vinegar, never even missed it! These were light and fluffy, my cast iron griddle did a bang up job! Instead of all the separate spices, I just added a couple teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and an extra dash of cinnamon and vanilla extract. Thank you Ruth, Keeper!

Off the chart delicious! Great texture. Substituted flour with 1/4 wheat flour. Used home-pureed pumpkin. Served with whipped cream and sprinkled nutmeg on top. What a treat. Kids loved it, too. Thank you!

I followed the recipe as written, but did not like the end product.  The pancakes lacked flavor and were not light and fluffy. They were edible, but not incredible.

Making this recipe as written, the batter is too thick.  The flavour is good.  I will make again, but I will add applesauce to thin the batter and add more nutrients.

What a special way to celebrate autumn! Wow! I dazzled my family with this one morning and they were all devoured. I recommend measuring out the 1/4 C of the mixture as these are extra thick and fluffy. Too much bater and it will be hard to cook all the way through. This will be an annual regular!

I didn't like this recipe. I tried it as is and the pancake batter was so thick, it would not cook evenly. I had to add a cup of milk extra just to get it to a normal batter consistency.

These were not good at all. Very mushy inside. The outsides were coming faster than the inside. So turned the heat down so the outside weren't burn and they still wouldn't cook in the middle. After leaving kitchen frustrated, husband tried to salvage the remaining mix by baking it in a bread pan,  still didn't work.

I guess I was the minority here. I LOVE pumpkin pancakes but I did not love these. Followed the directions and made them in my electric skillet. The flavor was very bland. Dry outer edges and gooey middles. These took forever to get done and my skillet works great so I know that wasn't the problem. I've had much better pumpkin pacakes even after dressing these up with butter, cinnamon/sugar, and real maple syrup they weren't anything to get excited over. Sorry.

These are fantastic! The changes I made were 1 1/2c. of pumpkin, didn't use allspice, added heaping tsp. cinnamon, 1/2tsp. ginger, 1/2tsp. nutmeg, 1/4tsp. cloves. I combined the milk and vinegar and let sit while I whisked the egg, pumpkin, and oil (coconut) together, then slowly added the milk. Then I combined all the dry ingredients, in a separate bowl, by whisking also. Then carefully mix wet and dry using a folding method, ONLY till mixed. Do not add extra milk! The batter is thick, but scoops and pours just fine, and cooks up very light and fluffy. We all loved them!

I made it exactly as written and my pancakes came out bland and mushy. They never cooked through to a normal pancake texture no matter how long or how low heat I cooked them on; the inside stayed mushy and the outside burned. They tasted of raw pumpkin and the vinegar gave it a tang. Despite so many recipes claiming otherwise, vinegar + milk is NOT a substitute for buttermilk because the two just taste completely different and you can tell in the final product. This recipe is so, so flawed and I definitely will not make it again.

These were great. I did make a couple small changes - I used melted butter instead of oil, 1/4c brown sugar (a little extra) (I like my pancakes buttery and sweet!), and I replaced all the spices with 2t pumpkin pie spice. The batter was thick and makes very thick fluffy moist pancakes. Good stuff!

Made exactly as written and they were delicious! Actually, I guess I did make one sub, I used half whole wheat flour. They turned out perfectly! My 3 yr old ate 2 big ones, my 5 yr old (picky) ate one large one. I ate about 6! :)

These are so good! Definitely a favorite! I usually use pumpkin or a bunch of smashed up bananas. Both are awesome. I keep the spices the same. I always run out of allspice so have used cinnamon and nutmeg in place of that. I also use half flour and half quick oats which is awesome and better for you. When I make multiple batches at a time, my ratio of oats is more than flour-so not an even 50/50.  I make a lot a once and just freeze them in gallon bags for super easy quick meals later!! Definitely a favorite from friends who are over too! I make these for lunch and dinner also!

All I changed ingredients-wise was replace all of the allspice with cinnamon (don't have any allspice right now). So in terms of texture these are freakin amazing!! I found them to be super fluffy which I like, but everyone else seems to say that they are dense. I sifted the flour, for no real reason, and just per my usual method of making pancake batter I mix until there are small lumps, let it sit for a few minutes, then gently mix again to break up the lumps. This seems to get everything incorporated nicely without overmixing and makes for a light and airy batter. Oh and they taste amazing as well.

Yum! These are tasty when you first make them, but they get even better as leftovers, the flavors intensify.

I froze a few and they were still great when defrosted. Serve with pure Canadian maple syrup for sure.

Great recipe!  Made these on the first day of school.  The kids loved them!  I did tweak the recipe a bit.  I substituted half of the flour with whole wheat flour for some extra fiber, added an extra egg and an extra tablespoon of oil.   Turned out great!

These pancakes were really good. They are not perfect looking like AR fluffy pancakes, but they sure do have a nice pumpkin flavor. I believe I used Trader Joes canned organic pumpkin puree. I halved the recipe and got 7 pancakes, but by the time I got to already cooking I realized I forgot the egg! No problem, they still turned out fine. I also could not find my allspice, so I subbed pumpkin spice for that one spice and followed the other 2. My only advice is to not cook them too high and make sure the centers are completely done. Mine took a little longer than typical pancakes to cook all the way through. I will make these again. I like how little sugar they use and the added nutrition from the pumpkin puree. I read in the new Allrecipes magazine that they are MyPlate approved too.

These pancakes are wonderful. I had both  pumpkin and buttermilk to usr up, so I used buttermilk instead of regular milk. I also used apple cider vinegar in place of regular vinegar. Although the batter was thick, it was still workable, and prduced tender, fluffy pancakes that were a delicious change of pace. Thanks!

These were fantastic! I substituted 2 1/2 cups pancake mix but kept everything else the same (pumpkin, egg, milk, vinegar, oil and brown sugar). Also added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg.
The whole family just gobbled these up - didn't even need syrup!

Great recipe! I made it a second time, but using Gluten Free Bisquick. I also had to be careful to smoosh the batter out a bit on the griddle--if they are too thick they don't cook all the way through. Very delish though!

These are so good! I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all-purpose flour and added a few drops of vanilla and a dash more of the spices. For singles or couples who don't need 12 pancakes, you can package by serving or layer in a container, separating with wax paper and freeze. Pop into the microwave for a wonderful, quick breakfast with no prep. Cinnamon maple syrup on these is heavenly.

A deliciously perfect twist on traditional pancakes!  My allspice was expired, so I made up my own batch with cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. I also combined the vinegar into the milk and let it sit for 5 minutes before adding to the other wet ingredients. The overall pumpkin flavor was subtle, which was fine by me, but next time I will double the spices as I LOVE a lot of spice. I really appreciate a fluffy pancake and the texture was spot-on. Even my pumpkin-hating hubby gobbled down a couple, and 4 year-old DD and I SCARFED these down! I foresee these fluffy pancakes as a regular weekend breakfast staple during the fall/winter months. The toppings and/or add-ins are endless: sauteed apples or pears, sweetened pumpkin flavored whipped cream, a cream cheese or real maple glaze, raisins, chocolate chips, nuts.....

My mom in law requests pumpkin pancakes every time she comes to town and I make these. The only changes I make is using half wheat flour and half all-purpose, and applesauce instead of oil.

This recipe was delicious! Not as simple as it looks for a breakfast however it is an amazing start to a fall/winter day! I think that lowering the heat a tad and adding a dash or two of sugar would have made this recipe better. Although if you add butter and syrup they are perfectly delicious on their own.

They are really odd to pour on the griddle (very heavy, viscous - you have to spread them into a circle yourself) if you're used to regular pancake batter, but they taste great when they're done!

Have to say, I've tried several other pumpkin pancake recipes from this site.  Some were too cakey, others were too thin.  Some had an overwhelming pumpkin flavor, and the other wasn't pumpkin enough.  This was perfect!  Absolutely amazing.  Will make again and again this fall and winter.

This was so good!  The only problem I had was with the consistency of the batter. It was so thick that I felt the need to add just a little more milk to thin it out.  Other than that, awesome recipe.  My entire family, including my picky five year old loved these pancakes!

Wonderful!  The batter was thick, but it made it a bit easier to work with for my daughter who is a novice cook (and chose this recipe).  They were nicely spiced .  She cut them with cookie cutters and served them to us that way.  She also had dollops of whipped cream on the side which enhanced the flavors.  Lovely! will made again!

I have to agree with another reviewer that this turned out really, really thick. So thick I couldn't tell when it was time to turn it over because it didn't bubble at all. I don't like to add extra liquid because I always fear that this over-mixes it. I did use white whole wheat; maybe this made it even thicker. I also used my homemade pumpkin pie spice. I wasn't really that impressed with the taste, but my husband liked them.

I loved this recipe.  Ive been enjoying them for a few years however, they are very thick pancakes and I have been trying to make them thinner.  I stumbled upon whole wheat pastry flour and loved it!  It made them just the right thickness for us.  I also use my own spice combination because I just don't care for the allspice, I use 1/4 tsp of cloves instead.  Delicious!

I have made pumpkin pancakes before but they are often too dense to cook well.  I had leftover fresh pumpkin in the fridge and I decided to give this a try - it was WONDERFUL!  I did make one change - I used half white and half whole wheat flour.  Also, on a few of the pancakes as they were on the griddle I sprinkled dried cherries and chopped walnuts, which were absolutely excellent and really kicked them up a notch.  Pumpkin is loaded with goodness, and I am always happy to find new ways to introduce it to my kids (other than pie ;))
Saving for future....thanks!

Delicious!  Very fluffy, but not too light.  I missed adding the vinegar until the flour was in so I let the batter rest a few minutes and it became bubbly and perfect.  I rarely ever separate my dry ingredients when making a recipe, and this one was no exception.  The pancakes were amazing!            Wonderful recipe, a must try.

I have made this recipe so many times.  It is devine!  I double the batch and come out with 28 medium pancakes.  They freeze well too!  You can use egg, but if you're allergic egg replacer powder works fine!  It is so pumpkin-y and perfect for fall weather - but I make it year round!  YUM - thank you poster!

Hot off the skillet, topped with butter and maple syrup these are delicious! I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour but otherwise followed the recipe exactly . . . A recipe that I will be using again. Might try throwing the whole mix in my blender to get a smoother texture next time.

5 stars!  This is a great recipe! So light and fluffy.  I used white whole wheat flour (from Trader Joe's), fresh pumpkin, and dropped choc. chips on top while cooking.  I did have to keep adding a bit more milk while cooking for the consistency but this recipe is a keeper!

Great taste--perfect with a tiny bit of maple syrup!

For a healthier version, substitute applesauce for oil, half of the flour with whole wheat flour, and add about 1.5T milled flax seed for added nutrients and protein.

Mmm Mmm! This recipe is a favorite when sleeping over with friends. I doubled spices and tripled cinnamon. Whipped egg white separate and folded into batter for extra fluffy cakes. Also served with cinnamon whipped cream or maple whipped butter. Geez, I do love these and the mornings when I make them!

Excellent pancakes...I wouldn't change a thing.  My mom doesn't really like pancakes and she loved these! The spices are spot on and the pumpkin flavor comes through beautifully.  This is a recipe I'll be making often.  Thanks for sharing!

DELICIOUS!  I used pumpkin pie spice -  2T - as that included cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, etc. altogether and it was phenomenal.  Light fluffy pancakes.  Going to experiment adding raisins as well for a real pumpkin bread taste.  Absolutely a keeper!

I used canned pumpkin & ground my spices. Next time I used Aunt Jemima & pumpkin pie spice blend. Fluffy with the one egg. Good flavor. We had them for lunch with bacon. I'd do it again, though I don;t often make pancakes.

I feel like something's wrong with one of my ingredients. The last couple times I've made this, they just will not cook in the middle, even if I cook them on a lower temp. It's like they get sealed on the outside and stay gooey on the inside, instead of getting fluffy.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  I did add an additional egg as another person suggested.  My husband loved them! I served them with Pumpkin butter (from this site) and homemade syrup.

These are great! Only change I made was used pumpkin pie spice instead of all the separate ones. I served them with fresh whipped cream :)

These were, bar none, the BEST pancakes I have ever made for my family.  They turned out beautifully and I used every last drop of the batter to keep up with the demand.  First time ever!  Thanks for the great recipe!

these are perfect, as is.

i mix the milk and vinegar together first and let it sit (so it turns into buttermilk) while i put together the dry ingredients, then i add the rest of the wet ingredients to the milk.  i have five children, so i double the recipe and use a 15 oz can of pumpkin. 

the batter is thick, but all you have to do is spread the batter out a bit with the back of the 1/4 measuring cup that you use to ladle it out.  

absolutely fabulous!  and it makes lots!

Delicious. I thought they needed a little more liquid so I added 1/4 cup more of milk. The middle did not get completely done until I did. Very dense and filling. Otherwise, fantastic and worth a try.

I used the suggestion to make it easier with pancake mix. I also added more ginger because I like it. This was a hit with my husband and my two year old twins. That's hard to find around here!

Awesome pancakes. The only thing I changed was to add the vinegar to the milk to sour before adding it to the other ingredients. Doing it that way they were as lift & fluffy as the pancakes I usually make. Made a yummy Christmas breakfast for us.

EXCELLENT! Doubled this recipe for my big family of 5 teenagers and all loved.  Also added milk chocolate chips, about 5-6 per 5" pancake, for a special 'holiday time' touch.  This one's a keeper!

Great pancakes, that the whole family enjoyed.  I've made these two weekends in a row.  Went and bought a griddle, and they came out even better.  I used canned pumpkin.  The only change I made was replaced vinegar with 1 tBLS of vanilla extract.  Thought vinegar was weird choice.  We topped with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

hmmm - I'm just not sure about all of the raving reviews about these pancakes.  I made them for my son and husband, who both love pumpkin breads, muffins, etc, and neither of them finished their plates, much less asked for seconds the way they usually do with our regular buttermilk pancake recipe.  I thought it was okay, but would choose a good buttermilk pancake over these ones any day (but I'm not a big pumpkin fan, so that's not surprising). I'm glad I tried these, but they did not stand out to us and I definitely won't be making them again.

These were delicious.  I made one change though-I used the pumpkin pie filling, rather than pureed pumpkin...then I eliminated all the spices since they are already in the pie filling.  I used about 3/4 cup of the pie filling and added a little extra cinnamon and sugar.  They were great!

These pancakes were very, very good.  My husband really liked the taste and consistency.  The batter was very thick and heavy and I needed to move the batter around on the griddle to flatten them out even though I added a little more water to thin them out. Overall they were delicious.  I served them with butter, whipped cream and powdered sugar.  Very fattening but oh so good!

Very good -- light, fluffy and just the right amount of pumpkin and spices.  Doubled the recipe (1 can of pumpkin is 15 oz so worked out well) and made a huge platter of cakes.  Had them for snacks throughout the afternoon.  Yum!

My husband and I loved these pancakes!  I followed the recipe but only changed the vegetable oil for coconut oil ( a healthier oil).  We like using real maple syrup while eating at the table.  These pancakes had all the nice pumpkin flavor, and aromatic spices, and thankfully weren't real sweet.  They were delicious!  Very satisfying, but realistically more like 4 servings instead of 6.  A winner during the holidays, and all year round.

VERY dense.  Not just thick, but heavy.  I'm going to use less flour next time and more milk.  I used Cider vinegar this time, and will again, I think.  Next time I'll increase the spices by about double, and use melted butter instead of vegetable oil for a more buttery flavor.

This recipe was excellent!  I didn't change anything at all and I thought it was absolutely perfect.  I was nervous at first because the batter was a bit thicker than any pancake recipe I've made but they still ended up absolutely perfect.  My husband and I went straight to the grocery store after having them to buy more cans of pumpkin!

AMAZING! These pancakes turned out wonderful!! I added 2 eggs instead of one also a dash of nutmeg, and to serve I made a cream cheese filling with a package of cream cheese, couple of tablespoons of butter, and 3 table spoons powdered sugar, I filled the pancakes with the cream cheese (it wasn't very sweet) then topped with real maple syrup...HOLY MOLE they were amazing!!!! Hubby called um sinful! They were really really really good!!!! WILL make again! THANKS!

These were WONDERFUL!!!  Tasted like warm pumpkin bread!

I used the original recipe (not the short version since I already have the ingredients for the original) - and it was perfect the way it was!

Thanks for this great recipe!

I loved these-it IS a thick batter, but I found (as others suggested) if I just even out the batter in the skillet right after I pour the batter in, AND ensure I brown the pancake on both sides, it cooks- and tastes great. I've never seen a fluffier pancake. I did use melted butter, rather than the oil since I don't care for the flavor of canola oil, etc. The second time I made these, I couldn't find my allspice so I substituted several gratings of fresh nutmeg-and I liked that version too! (I also made a 1/2 recipe by halving everything-except the egg which I used one whole egg-and the recipe was great-and just enough for about 5-6 good-sized pancakes. BTW I just added the vinegar to the liquids mixture-no problem with curdling (as another reviewer had expressed concern with) Thanks for sharing this one!

Pretty good! If we make again, we'll probably add more sugar to the recipe. The spiciness was perfect, but even with the syrup, we thought they could be a littler sweeter. Only changes I made were to use 1 t nutmeg and 1/2 t cloves instead of the allspice. Thank you for the recipe!

I thought it was very bland and too thick. I added 1 more cup of pumpkin, 1/4 cup more milk, and LOTS more spice. Then I made cinnamon flavored syrup and topped it all with pecans.

Very good flavor, especially since it incorporates a cup of real pumpkin.  I made this recipe into waffles and they were delicious!! They have just the right balance of pumpkin, spices, and moisture.  I used dark brown sugar for a little more flavor than light brown. Highly recommended! Serve with 100% real/pure maple syrup and enjoy :) Definitely one of my favorite fall breakfast items, without a doubt.  I will certainly make this recipe for years to come

Delicious!!!  I substituted half the white flour with whole wheat and just added pumpkin pie spice and they came out perfect.  I was a little concern they may not cook fully because it's such a thick batter but  it cooked through and had a nice golden sear.  Will make again.

These pancakes are incredible! Our grandsons and my husband (husband does not usually eat pancakes) went crazy over these pancakes. I must admit, they are the best I have ever made. Light, fluffy, moist and I used oat flour in place of the white flour to make them healthy as well. This is a winner year round for us.

These pancakes are amazing! It's hard to get my kids to step out of the box with recipes... They like everything plain. This recipe was the perfect combination of a classic dish with a fun flavor! I'll definitely make these again.

These were delicious served with maple syrup. For anyone planning on using homemade pumpkin puree, instead of the canned, I recommend using 1-1/2 cups pumpkin puree (as long as it's been blended smooth) and reduce the amount of milk to 1 cup. Instead of adding all the spices separately, I just added 2-1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice. My 11-month old loved it and so did I.

Very nice recipe.  I used an entire can of evaporated milk, an extra egg white and added extra spice (cloves, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice) because we like them spiced!  Also a smidge more pumpkin maybe a tablespoon or two.  I may try a little vanilla next time as well.  Thank you!!

These were great! Perfect amount of spices. The batter was really thick but they cooked perfectly, do not add more milk to thin them!! Definately will be making these again when we have leftover pumpkin puree. Thanks!

Oh yeah these are great! I did add an extra 1/2 egg, changed the serving size and wasn't going to split an egg. I also added vanilla, ground cloves and some fresh grated nutmeg. Perfect pumpkin flavor, nice fluffy pancakes. I really loved these. I served with Pumpkin Syrup (AR). Thanks for the recipe I'll be making these again!

Not bad, but not quite what I was expecting either. Would probably make again if I had left over pumpkin puree, but I wouldn't buy ingredients just for this. It tasted a tad too much like a sweet pumpkin muffin or cupcake for my liking.

These didn't have as much pumpkin flavor as I expected, but they were still wonderful!  They are VERY moist and fluffy - great as just a normal pancake recipe!  Don't be shy on the spices - it seems like a lot when you're adding it, but I almost wish I would have added more!

These pancakes are great! I followed the directions exactly and used a spoon to spread them out as a reviewer reccomended.  They were gobbled by my husband and son! Using 1/4 cup per pancake we got 18 cakes so a few went into the freezer for later. We will make them again!

Put the vinegar into the milk and let it rest for 5 minutes, then mix the ingredients according to the directions.  The vinegar/milk mixture is a substitute for buttermilk.  If you decide to use buttermilk in place of the milk, then omit the vinegar.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla into the pumpkin mixture.  Amazing recipe!

Followed recipe exept I used almond milk and half whole wheat flour.  Served with buttermilk syrup from German pancake recipe, but I used eggnog (coconut milk) instead of buttermilk.  A great combo!

I made these this morning and followed the recipe exactly. They were delicious. They were perfect for a fall breakfast!(or anytime of the year) I topped them with homemade apples I had put in the slow cooker the whole day before with a bit of sugar and cinnamon.  I was in heaven. I'm glad that I made the full batch because I froze the rest and can't wait to have them a few more times this week! YUM! I will definately be using this recipe for a very long time! It is now my go-to pumpkin pancake recipe!! :)

I love anything pumpkin and I made these pancakes this morning and they were terrific.  The batter was nice and thick and they cooked up nice.  I do a monthly newsletter for my church and I always feature a recipe and this will be my November recipe.  These are on the menu for Thanksgiving morning.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I, too, am a fan of IHOP's pumpkin pancakes, and always wanted to find a recipe that could match them; this is it!! I recommend cooking them on low heat, so they cook all the way through, and then browning them a bit on medium :) These are wonderful!!

Very good. I'd probably give 4 3/4 stars because I would like them a little more pumpkin-y, but the texture and everything else was perfect. I did add a tsp vanilla like another reviewer suggested, so maybe I will try without next time as that could have masked the pumpkin a bit. Regardless, they were very tasty!

My family loved these pancakes.  They were filling but fluffy.  We used almond milk instead of milk because of allergies.  It was a great part of breakfast on a cold rainy day.  We will be sure to have these again in the fall.

Made pancakes exactly as listed with the exception of the brown sugar - i think i added a little more - these were wonderful.  My kids and husband went crazy over them.  Made them for dinner and now making them for breakfast  2 days later.  A wonderful treat for fall!!

Love,love love this recipe! We serve it with the cinnamon syrup recipe from this site. Good, hearty, flavorful recipe. The only thing I'd add to the instructions is to spread it out with the back of your spoon as soon as you put the batter on the griddle, otherwise it's a bit thick of a pancake for me, but still delicious!

I thought these pancakes were ok but I'm giving them 5 stars because my husband and kids really liked them. First pumpkin pancake recipe that my husband actually liked----and liked a lot. Will make again.

The flavor of the pancakes was delicious, but the batter was a bit too thick for my taste.  It was difficult to get them to cook through without burning them, even on low heat.

These were very good.  The batter is very thick 1/4 cup made pancakes about 4" in diameter.  The flavor could use more oomph -I think next time I will increase the cinamon and add nutmeg.  I did add white chocolate chips (a family fav).  I prefer a lighter pancake and because they needed a little more flavor I am only giving it a 4.

These pancakes were really light and tasty.  I followed some other reviewers' suggestions by blending ingredients (with a blender), and waiting a few minutes after combining the wet and dry ingredients to let the rising agents really do their thing.  Great use of left over pumpkin.

We really loved this.  Even my husband who won't eat pumpkin pie liked it!  I did leave out the vinegar because I didn't see what it could possibly add, and I added chocolate chips.

Great with 1/4 cup chopped pecans!  Use butter in the skillet or add to the pancakes afterwords to greatly enhance the flavor.  These are hearty, fluffy pancakes.  DO spread/flatten the batter on the skillet.  If you don't thin it with milk, don't expect to see bubbles rise to the surface as the pancakes cook - it won't happen.  Just watch it and flip when underside is golden brown.  Thinning with milk or buttermilk works fine too, but it does thin the flavor a bit too.  But most of pumpkin flavor is in the spices anyway.
It doesn't say what kind of vinegar to use - I used apple cider vinegar & will do so again. I think it brings out the pumpkin flavor.
This recipe is great any time of year!  As with all pancakes, mix wet ingredients into dry until just moistened and a bit lumpy.  Add pecans or  chocolate chips.  Thanks Ruth!

The pumpkin taste wasn't as much as I would like but I added a couple dashes of pumpkin pie spice and that helped.  I made the recipe as is and I must make small pancakes because I got over 20 pancakes out of one batch!

The texture of pancake is remarkably similar to the texture of puree pumpkin. This makes for a pleasant sensation as if one is eating a delicious, fluffy pumpkin. Not going to replace old-fashioned pancake recipes, but good for a change of pace.

very nice recipe, good way for me to use up pumpkin from pumpkin pie baking. I just added a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg, and a little less pumpkin to pancake batter ratio to keep the texture more pancake like, very good!

These pancakes were delicious!  I used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, and they turned out great.  I even added chocolate chips to a few.  These were served with warmed pure maple syrup w/pecans and were a huge hit with my family.  Thank you Ruth!

Scrumptious. We made it with 3/4 of the flour amt being wheat flour. We also used yogurt (in place of the milk and vinegar--which makes it buttermilk-ish). We also used honey instead of sugar. 
To top it all off...we just added butter on top, but my husband added cinnamon sugar syrup too. I enjoyed the fluffiness.

Made 3 or 4 batches of these at one time (48 pancakes) and froze them in ziplock bags - 4 each.  I keep one bag in the fridge and heat up 2 a day in the toaster for my daughter who LOOOVES these.  They are delish.  Thank you for the recipe!

There were only ok. I followed the original recipe exactly except that I added some crushed pecans for a bit of a crunch. The pumpkin flavor was not very strong and so they were no better than ordinary pancakes.

I just made these this morning for our family of five. They were absolutely delicious. Light, fluffy, and flavorful. The batter was very thick and I followed it exactly as written. To thin it slightly I added water to desired consistency. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Fabulous!!! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I didnt have any AllSpice(as I live in Austria at the moment and can't get that here) so I used half a teaspoon of Nutmeg, and half a teaspoon of crushed Cloves in addition to the cinnamon and ginger! :) My 2yr old son at 4.5 of these!!! We ate them with a little butter, maple syrup and whipped topping!! YUUUUUMMMMYY!!!!

Made no adjustments to this. I thought they had good flavor, but they were a little too thin for my tastes.

These were delicious! Very light and fluffy. Next time I'll add another Tbsp of brown sugar and maybe a little more pumpkin but wouldn't change anything else. I also fed these to my almost-2-year-old twins. They have never liked pancakes before, but they LOVED these and kept asking for more.

OOO soooo gooooood.  My niece, who doesnt recall having pumpkin before, loved them also!  Only changes I made, I used evaporated milk, and for the vinegar I used a pomegranate vinegar.  So so good!

Oh I loved this! And I'm not even a real fan of pumkin, but had leftover pumkin puree from Thanksgiving so had to put it to use and everyone LOVED it. Used pumkin pie spice instead of all spice and ginger and it was delicious.

Both my husband and I thought these pancakes were delicious. I'll definately be making these again. I used buttermilk instead of milk and omitted allspice only because I didn't have any. I also omitted vinegar, it just didn't sound good. Not sure why I would want to put vinegar in pancakes. Maybe there's a reason, I just don't know what it is. :)

Loved loved loved!  Added a tablespoon of vanilla and chocolate chips and used pumpkin puree from a pumpkin we grew ourselves!  Turned out perfect!  These take longer on the griddle than the usual pancakes.  Thank you!

Great way to use pie-making leftovers.  Last night I made a pumpkin pie, and had left over pumpkin puree, and extra pie filling that didn't fit in the shell.  I didn't have the heart to throw it away after all the work in roasting the pumpkin, so kept it for pancakes this morning.  I substituted last night's pie filling (mixture w/ evaporated milk, pumpkin, spices, etc.) for the milk, and otherwise followed the rest of the recipe as stated.  Fantastic!!

***** Best pancake recipe for pumpkin ever.   Dessert: Make small cakes.  Make a fresh blueberry topping to use along with maple syrup, and top with whipped cream.  I served this at a ladies brunch and it was a definite crowd pleaser.

I took the advice of some other reviewers, and I used the magic bullet for the wet ingredients.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose.  I didn't have allspice so I used 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead.  They were fabulous!!!  Super fluffy and moist and excellent flavor!

Very Tasty. I used Spelt Flour, upped Brown Sugar to 4T and used 3t Pumpkin pie spice. Resist the urge to thin out batter, just spread it around with spatula. Fluffy, light, delicious! Kids loved it!

I made this with fresh sugar pie pumpkin.  Either my pumpkin wasn't flavorful or the recipe needed more pumpkin puree because the pumpkin flavor was more subtle than I hoped.  The pancakes were still delicious!

I made these as writtten.  Nobody could taste the pumpkin and the spices really didn't shine through. Also the batter was too thick to spread on the griddle. Don't know if I will try again or try to find another recipe.  I love pumpkin pancakes and these were a great disappointment. Recipiehnd

Good pancakes, maybe needs a stronger flavor, possibly more spices or maybe using real maple syrup rather than store bought would make this 5 stars instead of 4.

these were pretty good but had a different texture than i'm used to due to the pumpkin. i froze the leftovers and heat them up for a quick breakfast and they freeze well too!

Delicious! The kids loved them and we will make again! Only needed to top with a little whipped topping - no syrup needed!

This was one of the best pumpkin pancake recipes I have tried.  I added a large handful of chopped pecans and it was even better.  My family raved!  Serve with real maple syrup, if you can...it does make a difference.

These were yummy!  I was out of allspice but it didn't make a difference.   Definitely use brown sugar for this and not white.

Nice!! These delicious and filling pancakes are a nice addition to my weekend breakfast repertoire.   I served them butterscotch sauce and natural maple syrup that I mixed 1:1 and warmed up.  In the middle of scarfing them down my daughters asked when I would make them again. Easy to make and delightful to eat.

Mmmm...delicious!  I used 2 rounded tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices.  My 2 yr old ate 4 pancakes, and that was after snacking on cereal while he was waiting for breakfast to be ready!  Definitely a keeper.

This is a great recipe!  With Fall upon us we cooked a fresh pumpkin and used that in place of the canned pumpkin - yummy!  I was really surprised that the pancakes didn't turn out heavy.

This recipe is fantastic!!!  You have to be in the mood for a hearty pancake when you eat these!  2 was more then enough for my husband.  I added an extra egg and a little bit of milk so they werent so thick.  I also added an extra TBS cinnamon, and brown sufar.  Added 1tsp sugar. omitted the ginger and used pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice.  Great tasting pancake!!!!!

I liked that these pumpkin pancakes actually tasted like....well, pumpkin. My husband, however didn't like that about them. you win some, you lose some. He thought they were too dense. They are definitely more dense than regular pancakes, and thus take a while longer to cook. I think they are delicious! His only complaints were the strong pumpkin taste and the density.

Not sure what I did wrong.  The pancakes would not get done in the middle and were very mushy.  Flavor was ok but most were not appetizing as I could not get them cooked in the middle before the outsides were quite done.  The batter consistency seemed ok. Thoughts?

Sweet mother of all things holy!! I halved the recipe (but still used one whole fresh egg) and substituted Rice Milk for the milk and Bob's Redmill Gluten Free Flour Mix. A M A Z I N G!!!!!! I got 10 decent sized pancakes out of it. I planned on freezing the leftovers but it seems that I have eaten all of them...

I followed the recipe to the tee, and it was soft, fluffy, and smelled very good.  The only thing I would add next time is about half a teaspoon of salt to the dry ingredients.

By far the best pancakes ever!  I used fresh pumpkin puree and put them on a waffle iron.  Yummy, will make again and try with bananas.

These were soooo yummy!  I served them with homemade blackberry syrup.  The changes I made...1/2 whole wheat 1/2 all purpose flour.  I also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla.  I didn't have vinegar so I used buttermilk in place of the milk and added 2 tbs.  My whole family loved these and I will be making again and again!

These were delicious! After reading other reviews I made a few tweaks.  I used whole wheat pastry flour, 2 Tbsp baking powder and no baking soda, 1 Tbsp cinnamon and 2 tsp Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus (it's kinda like allspice).  I served them with brown butter cinnamon syrup. Incredible! To make the syrup, in a sauce pan over medium heat, cook 1/2 cup butter for 8-10 min or until golden brown.  Stir occasionally.  Add 1/4 c maple syrup, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 cup chopped toasted pecans.

These are so delicious!  However, it makes a lot more than 12 pancakes, more like around 20.  I have made them with 1/2 wheat, 1/2 white flour.  Still exceptionally tasty, but I would recommend adding a little milk to the batter.

Very good pancakes. I tried making homemade pancakes a while back and they were nasty, then I tried this recipe and they were really good. I used 2 eggs and 1/2tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/2tsp cinnamon when I made these last night and they turned out perfect. I love them and plan on making them all the time now. I actually just bought a large electric griddle so I don't have to cook one at a time. Now I can just make them and eat with everyone else. Great recipe!

Yummy!  Such a great fall breakfast.  Perfect for when you have extra canned pumpkin in the fridge.  I added some buckwheat and an extra tablespoon brown sugar.  Would be great with pecans!  Came together really fast and cooked perfectly.  Great recipe!

Made these for Halloween Breakfast and they were fantastic!  The only change I made was using Pumpkin Pie spice instead of all the separate seasonings.  The other change I made was that I didn't have the vinegar.

No allspice on hand so I substituted 1/2 t clove, 1/4 t nutmeg and an extra 1/4 t cinnamon for the allspice.  Added some mini semi-sweet chips too.

Just made these and they turned out great with just the right amount of spice, nothing overpowering.  I did add vanilla and doubled the recipe for my large crew.  I found the batter thick so I added considerably more milk until it was thin enough for light fluffy pancakes other than that no changes.

My husband made these this morning, and they were awesome!  He did not use the vinegar, and he substituted the cinnamon, ginger, and all spice for a teaspoon and a half of pumpkin pie seasoning.  Since we always have a house full of guests who stay the night before Thanksgiving, we've decided to serve the pumpkin pancakes for breakfast Thanksgiving day.

These were a bit dense. Next time I might add an extra egg per other reviewers or I might just take my regular pancake batter recipe and doctor it to make pumpkin pancakes. Not a hit here at my house, made as written.

These were SO good! I followed the recipe exactly but used 1 cup skim milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream. Topped with pecans and powdered sugar (and syrup of course).

We made a double batch, but didn't have any baking soda.  While I was browsing the Internet for a substitute, my 3-yr-old dumped in a small canister of baking powder--23 teaspoons.  We scooped out what we could see and hoped for the best.  These pumpkin pancakes are indestructible!  So yummy and can withstand major alterations!  All 5 kids and my husband gobbled them up and we will be using this recipe again!

Used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour.  Didn't have allspice--added small amt of nutmeg and cloves instead.  Omit salt.  Used about 1 cup evaporated milk since I had some left.  ETA: I added some extra cinnamon and some vanilla another time and it was good.  Very dense.  Used for pancake and waffles.

Heavy and flavorless. I used this recipe since I couldn't find the one I clipped from a newspaper and was very disappointed. The one I made from the clipping was light and delicious. This one was dull and flavorless.

SO GOOD! I added a few sprinkles of pumpkin pie spice(just cuz). They are amazing. They are not too sweet at all. I worried they might taste more like dessert but with just a small amount of sugar they were PERFECT! Everyone loved them!

These are delicious pancakes!  My kids didn't like them, but the hubs and I devoured them.  Replaced white flour with whole wheat flour.  Edited 10/14: used half wheat half white flour, pumpkin pie spice in place of individual spices and applesauce in place of veg oil. Super yummy fall weekend breakfast! Kids liked them this time.

These were very good!  Perfect for pumpkin season (and any other season)!  I added pecans to some while they were cooking, and those were perfect.  These pancakes make me want to make the pecan jam on this website to pour on top.  Next time I think I'll add a tablespoon or two more pumpkin and an equal amount more milk because the batter was very thick (though this was because I used 1 1/4 c whole wheat flour and 3/4 c white flour).  I would also add more spices.  I used 1 1/2 t pumpkin pie spice, but next time I'll probably add at least another teaspoon of that and maybe grate in some fresh nutmeg.

Made this morning for breakfast, enjoyed them.  Would have liked a more pumpkin-y flavor.  Didn't have ginger, so sub'd pumpkin spice. Didn't add vinegar either simply because I didn't have it.  Would make again.

Yum!  These are just what I was looking for!  I only made a few small changes- sub 1/2 c applesauce for egg, sub rice milk for milk, use apple cider vinegar and as someone else suggested, I blended the wet ingredients in my food processor.  The result was a fluffy batter that spread easily on the skillet.  Delicious!

I so wanted to love these pancakes. The flavor was amazing, they just didn't cook in the middle. I think if I had thinned the batter down they would have worked just fine. I'll probably try them again with some changes. Mine were burnt on the outside and just barely cooked enough in the middle.

This made a TON.  I halved the recipe and did Nancy's suggestion of using a pancake mix, used a 1/4 cup to scoop the batter and got 10 of decent size and 2 mini ones.  the flavor is really good, but I found my pancakes were getting black before they were getting done in the middle.  I even had my temp down on my stove.  Not sure how to fix it???

I had such high hopes for these and followed the recipe exactly, but they just did not turn out right. The batter is very thick and not a very pleasant texture once cooked, kind of doughy.  My son and I also found them to be lacking in the flavor department. They need more pumpkin flavor and more spice. I ended up throwing most of them away and I hate wasting food! I noticed that most of the high ratings belong to those who tweaked the recipe in some way. I'm sorry to say that I will not be making these again. :(

These were great! I made exactly as the recipe stated, and they were perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. I served with maple syrup and a touch of whip cream.

These were so good!  We all loved them.  Served with maple syrup (which the guys loved) or just a dab of light whipped cream.  If you don't have allspice, you can substitute 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/2 tsp cinnamon for the tsp of allspice.  We will definitely make these again!

This a tasty pancake recipe. I had to add a little extra milk (1/4 cup), because the batter was too thick (even spreading them with a spatula, it's too thick, and they burn before bubbling enough to turn). The end result, while tasty, is a bit squooshy in the middle. The main picture for this recipe (which has been the main picture for a long time) is not a user-submitted picture (scan through them - it's not there) and is, IMO, not a picture of this recipe. This is important because if you believe you're going to get round dry pancakes, you're going to be disappointed -- these are misshapen, moist pancakes, so browse through the other photos -- they're more accurate to what your result will be. I would up the cinnamon also in the future. These will taste fantastic with a caramel syrup. Thanks for the recipe! (P.S. This recipe was tested with canned Libby's. Homemade pumpkin puree will be wetter, and thus may not require additional milk.)

These were fabulous!  Great way to welcome the fall season.  I skipped the flour, baking powder, etc. and just used bisquick.  Then I added the additional ingredients. They turned out perfect!  Just like Ihops.  mmmmm

Really yummy, I made this more simple by substituting pumpkin pie mix from the can in place of the pumpkin, spices and sugar. Very yummy with the apple cider syrup from this site that is listed as Pumpkin Waffles with Apple Cider Syrup.

Delicious! Big hit for me, my 1 and 3 year old. Creamy, but stayed together... I found making them smaller into little pancakes make them cook alot better and more evenly.

Ah-Maze-Ing. I had pumpkin pancakes at a restaurant, and when they stopped carrying them, I was definitely looking for a way to curb my cravings. This did the trick perfectly, and was easy to scale to feed a group of ten.

I make pancakes every weekend for breakfast and never have I had a batch turn out as soggy as these!  The flavor was good, but eating a pancake that feels like batter in your mouth kind of takes away from that.  I followed the directions, but they still just were not to my liking.  I'll stick to my old recipe.

We make this gluten free, just do a direct exchange for the flour with Bobs Red Mill All Purpose Baking Flour (this is the only recipe I ever use the stuff for and it works well and hides the bean flavor of the blend.) So if your GF and missing pumpkin pancakes try this one, its fantastic! One last thing... you MUST eat it with REAL maple syrup, seriously, the fake stuff just won't cut it with these yummy pancakes!

Fabulous.  Soft, fluffy, slightly spicy.  Used 1/2 whole wheat flour and instead of all the spices used the equivalent amount of pumpkin pie spice. I got 18 pancakes using a regular ice cream scoop.  I flipped them before bubbles appeared (like regular pancakes) because they were very thick.

I don't particularly care for pumpkin, but my picky 20 mon old toddler loves it, so I'm basing this review/rating on his reaction....and he LOVED them! He ate 4 pancakes! I accidently messed up the order of ingredients (separate bowls etc, what can I say it was 6:30am on a Saturday..lol) but they still turned out great.  Freezing the rest of the batch of a quick breakfast on a weekday morning. Awesome recipe!

I thought the first round of these were a little bland, but they were 5 star after adding vanilla and a bunch more cinnamon to the batter.  I didn't measure, but probably ended up with 2 Tbsp cinnamon total.  I also substituted one cup of whole wheat flour for one cup of all-purpose, and added a little extra milk to thin the batter.  My toddler loved these dipped in applesauce.  I'm going to freeze a batch for easy breakfasts for her.

These are very filling. I would add more cinnamon and leave out the allspice next time. We really enjoyed these, and ended up skipping lunch because we still weren't hungry! I suspect this would be a good breakfast for teenagers or kids in school.

so moist and delicious! these pancakes need an emphasis on the CAKE.  in fact, my stack seemed to melt together into a spicy pumpkin cake while I was eating them, and didn't really need any butter or syrup (although they were amazing with a little of both).   they are quite tricky to flip, especially if you add extra pumpkin like I did. I also added pumpkin spice seasonings and cloves along with the spices that were called for, and a little lemon zest to the dry ingredients.    DO NOT be afraid to add milk, especially if you were generous with the spices. I made a few without added milk and the dough was so sticky it was impossible to flip. I added about a half cup more to the rest of the batter to make it an easier consistency and the rest of my pancakes were just as delicious, and came off the pan much more neatly.

I loved these, but my husband and kids were not impressed with the deviation from the bagged buttermilk mix.  I did follow one reviewers suggestion to just add pumpkin and spices to the bagged mix.  MUCH easier than starting them from scratch.  I will make them again and do the same shortcut.

I use close to double the pumpkin, and a little extra of each spice, and it makes a delicious, filling, tasty pancake. Better than IHOP!

Super good!! I used 3/4 whole wheat flour, soy milk, and egg beaters and they came out great. I will definitely make this again. A great taste and fun to make. I did not have ginger and it still worked out. Thank you for sharing.

We had real pumpkin to use up and it makes the flavor really come through. This was an easy and tasty recipe for some yummy fall/winter pancakes! Thank you!

I had some leftover pumpkin in the fridge and decided to try these for our Christmas breakfast.  I did use larger amounts of cinnamon & brown sugar and added ground cloves.  I also used melted butter intead of oil. I added some sugared pecan pieces to the batter.  These turned out big and fluffy.  We will be having them again.

We love these.  I use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, and we eat them with applesauce instead of butter and syrup.  Delicious!

These were SO delicious. I was afraid they might be heavy due to the pumpkin, but they were instead light and fluffy. I followed the recipe to the letter, so I really recommend not changing a thing! Lovely recipe

These were incredibly dense pancakes even after adding one cup of additional milk.  Did not like the flavor.

The other comments really helped as I took several of those suggestions, such as increasing the spices and adding a little more milk.  We really enjoyed these.

Really good recipe, but I made some changes: I used 1 cup milk and 1 1/4 cups flour, but left all the other measurements as they are (except brown sugar I used maybe 2 1/2 tbsp).  I also used apple cider vinegar, which worked great. The result was a more moist and fluffy pancake with a terrific, juicy pumpkin flavor (I always use fresh, boiled or roasted pumpkin). I also put some nutmeg in and of course, added more cinnamon. In some of them I also added 100% pure cocoa chocolate chips, which are very bitter, and are absolutely delicious when combined with the spicy pancake and the sweet maple syrup.  Mmm-hmm!

Wow these were good! We could eat them all week long. I used my home canned pumpkin also, but I am not sure it would make a difference. I will make them often.

The texture is good and they certainly look beautiful... But they lacked the yummy spiciness that I have had in other pumpkin pancakes.  I would consider them edible.  Will keep looking for a good pumpkin pancake recipe.

These pancakes were light and fluffy and not too sweet.  The only modification I made was to double the recipe and add extra milk (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup).  Served with regular maple syrup.  YUM!

Easy and delicious.  I love that the pumpkin flavor is subtle, and that they're flavorful without being too sweet.  We topped them with honey butter (made from a recipe on this site!) and maple syrup.  They turned out so smooth and fluffy, and I followed the recipe closely.  I look forward to making these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

These out so good that my sons were begging for more.  Great flavor and texture.  I do recommend aging the batter for at least 10-20 min. before cooking.  Do not stir the batter again after the initial mix because that will make the pancakes tough.

These are pretty good, but after tasting the first few I made some alterations. I added more pumpkin (almost the whole can), more cinnamon and a little nutmeg. Then they were worthy of 4.5 stars. I added pecans to about half of them, and those were worthy of 5 stars! Yum! Great fall breakfast.

A wee bit on the bland side, despite the spices.  Just felt like it was missing something.  The 6 year-old had the brilliant idea to add pecans and craisins.  Didn't even need syrup then!    I also made it the second time with 1/2 c whole wheat (red) flour, 1/2 c white flour, and 1 c Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Baking Mix.  They were so incredibly soft!

YUM!  I used half whole wheat, fresh pumpkin (pureed), 2 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie seasoning and they turned out fabulous!  Will add to my banana pancake recipe and switch them up.  Sweetened them with agave syrup to serve and everyone loves them!

These pancakes were some of the best pancakes I have ever tasted. Even better then restaurant pumpkin pancakes. I also tweeked the recipe to make it gluten and dairy free. Instead of flour I used gluten free pancake mix (so I omited the baking powder and baking soda) and rice milk in place of the cows milk. I can't imagine that either of these changes would alter the taste.  These were so good. I can't wait to eat them again. Even my 2 year old liked them, and he isn't really a fan of pancakes. Thank you for the recipe!

A favorite!  We took some other suggestions and added the whole can of pumpkin, an extra dash of pumpkin pie spice, vanilla, and subbed out the white flour for whole wheat white and old fashioned oats.  I mixed the dry ingredients the night before and we made enough to freeze the leftovers.  They were extra tasty with the honey butter found on this site too!

Oh. My. Gosh.  These pancakes were the best ever.  My picky husband and even pickier kids all loved them!  I took the advice of another reviewer and added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar, as well as 1 t. vanilla.  Trust me, you're going to love these!

I really liked these pancakes. While trying to make my money go farther, I occasionally make breakfast for dinner and was surprised that no one complained about this meal. I stuck to the recipe but did add more pumpkin (about 1/3 cup more) and doubled my spices.  I made homemade honey butter to top them with and it was perfect. I will definitely be making these again very soon.

These pancakes were really delicious.  I followed the recipe as it was written and like them a lot.  I think next time I'll add more cinnamon, brown sugar and a splash of vanilla.  My husband and 1 year old daughter really loved them though!

I tried to do 1/2 wheat flour, 1/2 white.  Big mistake.  The wheat flour overpowered the pumpkin way too much.  I will try 3/4 white, 1/4 wheat next time.  This recipe made big, fluffy, thick pancakes.  Great texture.

I made these with canned pumpkin and they turned out amazingly. My bf and I were both pretty excited by how delish they are. This is a new standby recipe for us!

Yum! I sprinkled cinnamon & sugar over the top (instead of syrup) for a little extra sweetness.

This is almost unfair since I LOVE anything pumkin but these pancakes are fantastic.  Light and fluffy and the spices are just right.  It did help to spread them out just a bit with a spoon since they get so fluffy when they cook.

Yum!  The pumpkin makes them so deliciously moist and thick.  They were the perfect consistency.  I did add another egg and more cinnamon, but the recipe as is would have been fantastic, too!

Really good and easier than my previous recipe.  These are light and just sweet enough -- not too sugary.  I think next time I might try 1/2 ap & 1/2 ww flours.  Also, I think buttermilk could be subbed for the vinegar & milk in a pinch with no negative outcome.  Really good!

These were amazing! My husband loved the flavor and spice. I think a little maple or vanilla extract really enhances the flavor, and this recipe could use more cinnamon, but that is a personal addition, and would recommend that as an addition to taste, but as a recipe, this is pretty complete!

Awesome recipe. Loved the flavor of these. The texture of the mix was a little thick but I just added a little more milk and then used a spoon to spread them out on the pan. The only change I made was I used whole wheat flour and they still turned out fabulous.

Absolutely delicious!! One adjustment: in addition to the 2 cups flour, we added 1/3 cup whole wheat flour for a more healthy twist. The spices are just right, not too overpowering, but a pleasant touch.

Fairly good. I needed the same amount of milk as flour because otherwise they were too thick and didn't cook well enough in the middle. 
Many times later: These are also very good with butternut squash puree.

The best pancakes I have ever tasted, bar none. Follw the reviews not to add any more milk: the batter is supposed to be thick and so I pour it as a circle into my nonstick, and spread it a little to get it into good shape. Very filling and delicious. I think it's necessary to lightly grease the pan with butter for each pancake, and to cokk it a little longer than regular pancakes. I like them best plain or with a little butter but no syrup--I used pumpkin pie mix can instead of plain pumpkin puree and the batter was wonderfully sweet and spiced when I added a ts of cinnamon and loads of fresh grated ginger, didn't have allspice. May add some raisins, pecans, or choc chips to the batter next time. I like it best served with steaming cups of unsweetened coffee with a little milk, and fresh fruit on the side-- strawberries and grapes, next time I'll do peaches. May try another egg to give it a more egg-y taste( most pancakes do have 2 eggs) but it's not necessay. AWESOME!

Delicious!!  We loved them.  Cooked them at 300 deg since another reviewer recommended to cook at a slightly lower temp.  Spread them out a bit after putting batter on skillet.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very tasty! I made some adjustments to the recipe based on ingredients I had available and nutrtition!   I subbed applesauce for the oil, halved the sugar (topped w/ syrup, it doesn't need the extra sweetness), wheat flour, I used almond milk b/c that's all I had and I even used a bit extra to thin out the very thick batter some. It made 10 very dense 6" pancakes.   The flavor was quite good but a little dense for my liking. Will continue to tweak!

My toddler loves these.  It's an easy way to sneak some extra good stuff into her breakfast.  I make a whole batch and freeze.  30 seconds in the microwave and breakfast is ready!  My only complaint is that they come out a little too thick.  I'm going to try again using a mold this time.

These are definitely better than plain pancakes but could be improved.  They turned out very dense and rubbery, even though I made sure not to overbeat them.  I had to add milk to thin the batter as it was way too thick!  They also had an overpowering taste of baking soda.  Next time, I think I'll add another egg, increase the spices and sugar, add vanilla, use more pumpkin, and use apple cider vinegar instead of white.

Wow! These were fantastic. After reading the reviews, I added an extra egg to the batter. Keeping the portions to 1/4 c. and spreading it out ensured they cooked beautifully. They had great texture and flavor. I served it with Maple pumpkin syrup.  Mix 1/2 c. pure maple syrup with 1/2 c. or so pumpkin puree and a pinch of cinnamon. Heat it up until warm. Adds the perfect touch to these pancakes!

I made a vegan version of these for my boyfriend and they turned out really tasty.  I substituted soymilk for the milk, and used powder egg replacer for the egg.  I also added some chopped pecans since I love pecans.  Great with maple syrup!

So good, so fluffy.  I substituted half the flour with whole wheat and added 1 tsp vanilla and another tsp of brown sugar.  I let the batter sit for a few minutes and cleaned up while the baking soda and baking powder react with the other ingredients. I think this helps with the fluffiness.  I doubled the recipe and was able to get 16 big pancakes.  This is a keeper!

My husband loved these and he is NOT a fan of pumpkin anything!  I added a tsp of vanilla and some white sugar - other than that, I kept it the same.  I wasn't blown away by them, but they were really good.

We made these pancakes for our Christmas breakfast and they were a big hit!  I did make a couple of changes.  I used 1/4 c (4 T) brown sugar and added an extra egg.  I also omitted the ginger (heartburn sufferer) and added 1 more t cinnamon & 1 t vanilla.  These pancakes turned out fluffy and light and tender.  Another plus was that while I normally pretty much drown my pancakes in syrup, I found I enjoyed these best with just a drizzle.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was fantastic.  However, it was a little "heavy".  The flavor was very interesting and a great way to use up pumpkin.

LOVE THESE PANCAKES!!! My husband begged me to add this to my recipe box. He was kinda skeptical at first cause of the pumpkin added to the pancake batter, but first taste and he changed his mind... even our son loved these. A great way to get our son to eat another veggie! I topped these pancakes with the "absolute best pancake syrup" also found on this site... was a great hit with the entire family! THANK YOU FOR SHARING!!

I make these pumpkin pancakes every year for at least the last 10 years. September - March. I make exactly as stated (sometimes I double). Absolutely perfect. No reason to try any other recipe.

These were excellent! Light, fluffy and tasty. No need for butter just add a little syrup. I used the entire 15oz can of pumpkin and added chopped pecans. The leftovers were even great the next day.

Pleasantly surprised. I have tried many pumpkin pancake recipes and so far this is my favorite. They were light, moist and fluffy. Some pumpkin pancake recipes have tasted bitter to me. This one was plenty sweetâ¦ with that small amount of brown sugar.

I couldn't find my old pumpkin pancakes receipes that I've used for several years. It's our family tradition on Thanksgiving & Christmas to serve these for breakfast.  I tried it, and I have to say it moves to the top of the list as my favorite, and that's saying a lot considering I have three other recipes.  I added 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk to thin out the batter, and it was perfect.

This recipe made nice thick, fluffy pancakes but I did tweak it. The batter was very thick. I remember hearing that seltzer water makes matzo balls fluffier, so I thinned the batter with some seltzer water. I probably used to 1/4-1/2 cup to thin out the thick batter. Also, next time I'd halve the amount of allspice and use a little less cinnamon. I used a 1/4 cup scoop and got 15 pancakes out of this recipe. I cooked them over moderate heat to make sure they were cooked through.

I was not impressed with this pumpkin pancake recipe. The pancakes were very dense and really did not have much pumpkin flavor. I will look for another pumpkin pancake recipe next time.

MEGA 5 stars for me!!!!!!!!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and they were DELICIOUS!!!  I served these with maple syrup and, quite possibly, these were some of very best things I have ever put in my mouth.  YUM!  Easy and delicious!  I think I've found my 'signature' meal now!!  Thank you!

Excellent pancakes.  Fluffy and light with great flavor.  I substituted 1 tsp. nutmeg for 1 tsp. allspice since I didn't have the allspice.  It's a new favorite.

These are sooooo good!!! My husband requests these any time we have a day off together... for breakfast, dinner, or dessert! I subbed clove for allspice, an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. I like my pumpkin products to be a bit more spicy. I normally do this with my pumpkin pies too. My sister and parents use maple syrup and whipped cream on top of these pancakes, but my hubby and I just like to top it off with whipped cream. This recipe is the best. It is permanently on my fridge for easy fast access!

These are great! I played with the spices a little adding cloves and nutmeg along with pumpkin pie spice just because I like a strong spice taste. The whole family loved them :)

Very, very, very yummy! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I didn't have allspice, so I used a little bit of pumpkin pie spice. My only complaint would be that the spices weren't strong enough. I would definitely double them, at LEAST next time. Although I like things with lots of flavor... :) Fabulous recipe, thanks for sharing!

I thought WoW, I'm one of the few who didn't care for this recipe but on reading reviews I noticed people changed up this recipe often and then gave them 5 star ratings; some even using pancake mix and adding pumpkin and spice, while others used buttermilk, wheat flour and other things.  I followed the directions with exception of not having enough baking powder so I used a lil more baking soda; maybe this was my problem!  My son tasted one bite and said "I don't like them" and he'll eat anything with syrup on it!  We agree'd it's the texture and taste.  After mixing it was way "too thick" to pour so I had to add more milk which meant more mixing... Could that have been my problem?   They tasted rubbery and un-done even the really dark ones.  The batter wasn't sweet or salty enough on it's own, I tasted the pancake plain and it just wasn't good... I'd up salt and sugar if I were to try them again.  Threw them away...

Excellent.. better then ones we have had in restaurants.  I did use a few of the suggestions... used 2 eggs, 1 TBS cinn, 1 tsp ginger and ? 1/2 tp nutmeg. I used canned pumpkin.  I did the dry ingrediants first and then mixed the wet ones in the food processor.  Then I added the dry into the food processor.  I also used a spoon to spread them out on the griddle.  Thanks so much!

These are just divine.  The texture is rich and fluffy, the spicing is perfect and they're a lovely golden color.  Like pumpkin pie on a breafast plate!  My kids just loved them.  I did swap out 1/2 cup of the flour for King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour.  I served them with toasted pecans, warm maple syrup, and warm apple butter.   Yummmmmm.

Update 2019:  this time I used almond milk and half of the flour was spelt.  Still divine!

These  are just like pancakes from a pancake house, very fluffy.  I was worried they might be mushy in the middle, so I was careful to spread them out a little in the pan.  Great flavor, just the right amount of pumpkin for my husband and me.

These pancakes are so yummy! I was worried my kids would complain just at the sound of pumpkin, but they gobbled them up and asked for seconds! I made the cinnamon cream syrup from this site to go with the pancakes and together this made breakfast a special treat! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These were awesome, but I adapted a little as I went.
I used whole wheat flour for all of it, and my test pancake ended up so thick that I added extra milk to thin the batter for the rest. Still came out super hearty with amazing flavor! A lot of allspice to it, but still awesome, and oh-so-filling!
These work well for anyone on WW (2 points per cake) and they're going in my 'make again' file for sure!!

Great recipe. Per other's suggestions I added another 1/4 cup milk to make them a little thinner. I also used half flour and half whole wheat flour. These pancakes taste great with pure maple syrup!!!

These pancakes  made the house smell wonderful (and they tasted pretty darn good, too)! I made these with skim milk, left out the ginger and added in some toasted pecans.  Thanks for this great Fall breakfast recipe!

I grew my own sweet pumpkins this year, so we have been on a pumpkin everything kick.  These were absolutely fantastic.  No changes needed.  Enjoy!!!

I made these exactly per the recipe. My boyfriend, (the pumkin lover) gave them a 5+ star rating. I'm not a big fan of pumpkin so I thought they were just average but he raved about them so I'm giving them a 5 star rating. Easy to make and had plenty of batter for the next morning's breakfast.

I am making a second double batch now so we can have these great pancakes during the week.  They'll freeze nicely in baggies and microwave up quickly before school.  Truly a fantastic recipe.  I used flax seed oil instead of the 1/4 cup regular oil and whole wheat flour to boost the already healthy ingredients.

These pancakes turned out great!  My family really enjoyed them and were singing my praises.  The only thing I had to do differently was to use two teaspoons of Pumpkin Pie Spice because I didn't have any allspice.  I also just added a couple of shakes of cinnamon to the batter.  I'd like to try them with walnuts next time and maybe some wheat germ to add texture.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I made this recipe for a family breakfast on a Sunday morning. We all loved these pancakes. They are very heavy and hearty. Before serving I sprinkeled pecans over the pancakes. This a must try recipe, even my 3 year old liked them, he never mentioned that they were pumpkin and not buttermilk.

I thought these were really good.  I had pumpkin pancakes at IHOP and this is the first recipe I have found that even comes close.  I did substite 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour for the 2 cups of white flour called for.  I also sprinkled the pancakes with a few mini chocolate chips before I flipped them and I served them with real maple syrup and a little light whipped cream.  Delicious!  They were a hit with my 4 and 6 year old too.  I will make this again!  Thank you!

Loved this recipe. This is the only pancake I can get my teenage daughter to eat. She loathes pancakes but she loves these. What makes them even more wonderful is the syrup I found on here called Cinnamon Cream Syrup. Yummy!

I changed a few things about this recipe. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour+ 1 cup white, only used half the oil called for, and added 1 tablespoon of apple sauce and about 1/4 cup splenda. They were delicious!

a disaster! I'm just a novice cook and I did change the serving size to 2, which might explain the extra eggy taste.  But the pumpkin flavor was VERY minimal and the centers were mushy.  I won't waste my pumkin on these anymore.

Easy to make.  Didn't taste like the pumpkin pancakes from IHOP last fall, not as sweet, but ok.  Probably wouldn't make again because the pumpkin flavor was so subtle I don't think it was worth the extra ingredients.

Yum!  I love the smooth texture.  I used whole wheat flour and it still turned out great!  I also had to substitute a few spices out of necessity- I used 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg instead of allspice.

These are such a delicious change of pace from regular pancakes. The flavor is wonderful. I made a double batch the second time so that I can have some on hand in the freezer for microwaving.

Very good recipe.  I made a few modifications-I used finely milled whole wheat flour, and I tripled all the spices because as it is, it was too bland for my tastes.  I didn't need to thin it down, but I did spread it on the pan with the back of the spoon to cook it evenly.  I used fresh boiled pumpkin, finely pureed and drained.  I definitely will be making this again!

Absolutely super!! My only suggestion is to add chopped pecans, which add both texture and flavor.  Yum yum yum.  And whoever said fresh pumpkin, most definitely.

Rave reviews by all at the breakfast where I served these.  Nice spice mixture.
Later:  I continue to make these and am always asked for the recipe.  I now make a big batch and freeze them for my toddlers.  They love them!

These were delicious! They are thick, so my first batch was gooey inside until I threw them back on the griddle. I used half and half instead of milk because I had some about to expire. They were yummy-almost a dessert! Would be good with whipped cream.

Very good, thick pancakes. I added a little more sugar and a bit more spices. Delightful on a cool fall morning! They are thick, so if you prefer them a bit thinner add a touch more milk.

This recipe is 4 stars as written -- we had to add about 1/2 cup more milk because the batter was so thick.  But the taste is by far and away 5 stars!  Delicious!  Very fluffy pancakes!

We were not terribly impressed with these at first. About half-way through the batch I thought I would add some mini chocolate chips. We enjoyed them much more after that simple addition.

This pancake tasted really good. It was also nice because normally when I make pancakes it ends up a little runny but these stayed in place. I recommend topping the pancake with powdered sugar and maple syrup.

These pancakes were great! We didn't change a thing when making this recipe. It was almost like having pumpkin pie for breakfast!

Pancakes are my favorite food, and these were easily one of the best pancakes I've ever eaten. We put dry cranberries in them and they were delicious!

These pancakes were really good! i halfed the recipe and i had some left over. i substituted the ginger for extra allspice and i added extra brown sugar. Also, i sprinkled white and brown sugar on the pancakes while they were cooking, and it turned out great! i ate these with warm applesauce dusted with cinnamon...it was a very warming, comforting breakfast.

These were a little too heavy for my liking... but overall a decent recipe.  On their own, they have a very mild flavor so they taste a lot better with lots of butter and syrup on top!  I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the allspice and nutmeg. I would also add more sugar to the batter.

These are very yummy!  I used buttermilk instead of the milk/vinegar combo.  The batter came out really thick, so I ended up putting more buttermilk in to get the consistency I wanted.  I used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of all the other spices and I left the salt out.  They came out really thick and dense and tasted fabulous!

Having a 100lb pumpkin to use up I tried this recipe, normaly I don't follow to the "T" this one I did. Had a little taste I couldn't figure out. Maybe a little like Gingerbread? Will make again with vanila and nutmeg added and drop the vinagar

This is a great recipe! The whole family loved them.  I added a little flax and wheat germ and it blended in just fine.  I'm always looking for recipes that I can add flaxseed into.  I will definitely print and put in my recipe box!

Belch.  These were soggy and doughy.  The dough is super thick and takes forever to cook... and then they are still not a pleasant texture to eat.  Smell great though - what a disappointment.

These were soooo good!  And I even completely forgot to add the vinegar.  I wonder how it would have changed for me?  I also toned down the spice a bit by halfing the allspice & ginger, and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  So great, it's a new seasonal tradition for me!  Maybe next time I'll add the vinegar to see how it changes.

I loved this recipe. I was afraid that it would be too sweet, but it wasn't, it was actually quite light. I didn't serve syrup with these pancakes at all. I just topped them off with butter and whipped cream with a sprinkle of cinnamon. Delicious!

These were so good!  I wish i could give it 6 stars! I made these for dinner accompanied by fresh apple sausage.  We used real maple syrup that was served warm with some butter melted into it.  I did use nutmeg instead of allspice because I was out. After dinner my oldest daughter asked for these for her birthday!

This was a HUGE hit at our Hawkeye tailgate party prior to the Illinois game!  We prepped all of the dry & liquid ingredients separately the night before then combined at the game.  Fantastic on the outdoor griddle!

Wow!! Amazing pumpkin flavor. Even my 5 yr old daughter who doesn't like pancakes loved these. She ate them up & asked for more! I will absolutely make these again. If I didn't, my husband might just leave me:)

Good, not not amazing. The pumpkin flavor is very mellow.  I think next time I would add more pumpkin and def more spices.  Also, it was very thick so I had to add more milk which may have lessened the pumpkin flavor.  Would make againa dn serve with pumpkin butter

Great pancakes! I followed the recipe as it was & had no problem w/ it cooking in the middle as other people said. Maybe they just had their stove too high?  I didn't really care for them the first day I made them but I think the next day they taste better. Just pop them in the toasted and they are delicious! I will make them again.

My children and I loved these.  I left out the vinegar and used more milk than called for in order to make it less thick.  The result was right on!  Great for this time of year.  A keeper!

very thick even after adding extra milk and water.  took a long time to cook on low heat as other people suggested doing. By the time I was finished I was frustrated from standing over the stove for 45 minutes.  The first 8 pancakes turned out undercooked in the middle and messy looking and those got tossed. I got about 10 more pancakes done before I gave up.  Still had about 10 pancakes worth of batter left that i through away. The boyfriend, who normally inhales pancakes, took a few bites and couldn't eat any more.  he said that one pancake was enough because they were so heavy.  I thought they didn't have the flavor I was expecting.  Not worth the hassle. Next time I want pumpkin pancakes I think I'll just add pumpkin pie spice to my bisquick.  It would probably taste better.  Sorry.

My family loved these pancakes!  I followed the recipe to the "T" and they came out perfect.  I will continue to use this recipe.  Fresh whipped cream and toasted pecans are a must in addition to real maple syrup to top them off.  I did not have a problem getting them to cook all the way through as others have posted. Batter is thick but I had no problems with it. I would suggest playing with the heat at times as you would with any recipe.

Good recipe.  My kids loved them.  The batter was a bit thick but it helped if you spread the batter out a bit in the pan as another reviewer suggested.  I also cooked at a little lower temp so outsides wouldbh't burn before insides were done.

Be sure to cook fully as the batter turns out very thick.

Very good.  Used whole wheat flour and a touch of extra milk.  Added pecans and chocolate chips.  Love freezing these and eating them frozen as a dessert!!

Smelled great, but a little too...thick and heavy for my liking. Some people seem to be loving these, but I don't think I'll be making them again.

These were good pancakes, but unfortunately they didn't taste quite as good as they smelled!  Nice and fluffy.  I went exactly by the recipe, even though a lot of reviewers seemed to modify amounts, etc.  I have a lot of pumpkin to use up so I be making these again!

These were great - low in fat, not too sweet, and really easy to make!  I loved that they had more of a cake-like texture than other pancakes I've made.  I'll be making this recipe again for the winter holidays :)

This is a great recipe.  I, too, used buttermilk and omitted the vinegar, but added 1/4 tsp. of baking soda.  I also used self-rising flour (omitting the baking powder and salt).  I also added 1/8 tsp. each nutmeg and cloves.  I made a few pancakes with the thick batter, then added a few tablespoons (I didn't measure) of milk to thin it down.  The taste and texture of the pancakes didn't appear to be altered, only the thickness.  I chopped up some pecans and added to the batter (I love nuts in my pancakes) - yummy!  I will have to experiment further, though, because this recipe made 15 4" pancakes - way too many for the two of us.  This recipes goes in my file of favorites!

I had very good luck with this recipe and will defintely use it again. I added about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, and maybe an 1/8 teaspoon of both nutmeg and cloves. I used buttermilk instead of milk (and therfore omitted the vinegar). The batter was a little thicker than I'm used to, so I diluted with a bit of fat-free half n half, and added a few extra tablesppoons of pumpkin to compensate (I didn't want to lose the pumpkin flavor) I realize these are not insignificant changes and therefore skew my review, but with these changes the pancakes were absolutely fantastic. I topped them off with bananas sauteed in butter, brown sugar, vanilla and grand marnier--defintely not necessarily, but a wonderful addition. The whole family raved about this breakfast for days.

Delicious recipe!  I made these with gluten-free flour and they were wonderful!  Very good texture for gluten free.  My mom, who doesn't eat gluten free, also really enjoyed them!  Thank you for such a great recipe!!

Great!  I actually ran out of eggs, so I used 2 cups of milk and 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin in place.  Turned out great without the eggs!  I topped with apple butter and my hubby couldn't get enough of them!

i originally gave this 5 stars about six months ago.  still love the flavor, but can't seem to get the pancakes to cook thouroughly all the time.  at first i thought it was me, but after reading other reviews with the same problem - its gotta be the recipe.  will try with others suggested changes.

Very, very good!  The only substitution I made was lemon juice for the vinegar (was out) and added some milk per other reviews.  I also made some with chopped walnuts sprinkled into the batter. 
Made a warmed sauce concoction with 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree, 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup pure maple syrup with a dash of cinnamon.  Yum!

These were delicious! I loved the flavor. The only thing I would change is to add more milk to thin them out (they were very puffy and thick) and cut down on the baking powder/soda a little to make them less cakey .I served them with warm real maple syrup and some apple slices I baked with cinnamon and sugar. They were a hit!  I'll definitely use it again!

These pancakes were good. I added an extra T. of brown sugar (because I like my pancakes a little sweeter), and little more milk to make it easier to pour.  The pancakes were fluffy and moist.  Top off with chopped pecans and your favorite maple syrup.

Great recipe!  I cut this down to 1/4 as I was making it just for my 3-year old.  Still added 1 egg, used whole wheat flour and a little less spice.  The batter was a nice consistency (I'd probably add 2 or 3 eggs if making full recipe) and my picky son gobbled them up and had a nutritious meal!!!  Babysitter tried them and asked for the recipe!

I did end up having to add quite a bit more milk to thin them out and still had a hard time getting them to cook all the way through, even after cooking them on low as others have suggested. I bought Country Crock maple flavored butter and that was very good with these!

This recipe makes awesome, fluffy pancakes!  I believe the ingredients list is missing 1t ground nutmeg.  Also, these pancakes are perfect using whole wheat flour.  Try topping them with pumpkin butter, whipped cream, and some pecans--it will truly taste like pumpkin pie!

My boyfriend and I enjoyed these pancakes, but they were extremely dense.  I ate 3 smallish size cakes and was completely full!  The batter needs to be thinned out, for our taste.  It was hard to tell when they were done cooking on one side so some ended up with doughy centers.  Still good, and I will probably make again this weekend.

These were really delicious, simple, and elegant.  I used cider vinegar, but next time I will cut it down to 1 tbs.  I also had to add a little water to it because I thought it was too thick--but I like a thinner batter.  I added 1 1/2 to 2 cups of chopped pecans to the batter which made my breakfast company go "nuts".  Also, apple butter was a hit on top of these cakes.  It will definitely make again and again and again.

Although these did take quite a while to cook I am still giving them five stars.  They were wonderful!  I did make a couple of changes...I used already seasoned pumpkin puree in addition to adding the seasonings called for.  I used 3 tablespoons of butter in place of the vegetable oil.  Also, I used apple cider vinegar instead of plain vinegar.  It was a wondeful treat for my children this morning!

These pancakes were very thick, and did not have a very good flavor.  I added extra milk and an egg as recommended, but they still were not a very good pancake texture.  I also used a lot of spices, but it was still not very spicy.

These pancakes were not what I had in mind. I was hoping for a stronger pumpkin taste. I ended up adding another 3/4 cup of pumpkin and about 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice, but they were still a little lacking in flavor. They are worth trying, as many other people liked them. I just wanted something with more flavor (think pumpkin bread, but in pancake form!).

I loved this recipe. We did not have allspice, so we used 1/3 tsp of ground clove, cinnamon and nutmeg each. Delicious!

Just got done making these and my kids loved them, and they didn't even know they were good for them. I used a thicker pumpkin puree so added an extra half cup of milk and an extra egg and it turned out great.

Both I and my children definitely love this recipe!  I used my own pumpkin and added one extra egg.  I did substitute lemon juice for the vinegar and they came out perfect!  Way better than just adding pumpkin to my regular pancake recipe!!

these pancakes were amazing.  i substituted a cup of wheat flour for one cup of white to add some fibre.  i also topped with some leftover cranberry sauce and a dollop of whipped cream instead of syrup and it was absolutely scrumptious.

I think the consistency of the batter depends on how runny your pumpkin is.  An off-brand I have is really runny pumpkin, but Libby's is really thick.

That said, I made this with Ener-G egg replacer and used the equivalent of two eggs and just a little bit more milk.   My kids LOVED having this for breakfast on Thanksgiving day.  My husband and I also enjoyed them.  We had them with real maple syrup.  They were more filling than normal pancakes and we ended up with about half of them leftover.  

It made about 20 pancakes using a 1/4 cup scoop.

These were AWESOME!! I added another egg,a tad more milk, & a tablespoon more of brown sugar. I didn't have any allspice so I added a dash or 2 of nutmeg. The kids loved them and so did my husband! He said these were the best I have ever made! Great way to use up that left over pumpkin as well!!

I love these pancakes!  Thick and hardy, they taste great and are very satisfying.  I doubled the amounts of the spices and found that I could stand to add a little more.  So far I've made this recipe twice and loved it.   They eat great on their own (one could probably even carry them and eat like a piece of bread) but I like putting butter and brown sugar on them while they're hot.  So delicious!  Thank you for this recipe!

Very filling! I substituted old-fashioned oats (blended into a fine powder) for the flour, and 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice for the allspice, cinnamon, and ginger. Also, I used 2 cups of milk.

So yummy, they came out light and fluffy- the aroma was unbelieveable!  Sure I had to make some alterations- thinned it out a bit, but all good results are dependent on the quality of the ingredients, and the keen discrepany of the cook.

I don't care what they say, Ruth, this is a great recipe!

These were WAY too thick for me.  I also added a ton of extra milk but they did not get done in the center.  I gave up on the pancakes, and pulled out the waffle maker.  They still did not get done enough in the middle, and were rated "not that horrible" by my husband.  My kids usually gobble up my waffles, but these were only half-eaten.  Big disappointment.

I loved these pancakes!  I had leftover pumpkin from Thanksgiving pies, and this was the perfect way to use it!  I added a little extra milk to thin the batter, because it was quite thick, and I added some chocolate chips for taste.  This made a huge batch of batter, much more than the three of us needed.  I added some more flour and sugar (about 3/4 c flour, 1/2 c sugar, but it would depend on how much batter you have left over), and more chocolate chips,  to thicken the batter to cookie dough consistency. I dropped them on a cookie sheet and baked for about 12 minutes at 350 degrees.  The cookies and the pancakes were both great!  Thanks for such an easy and versatile recipe!

I'll give this a four because these just didn't have as much flavor as I was anticipating. It could be that I added two tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of what the recipe called for however. Next time I'll add more. My nine year old and two year old loved them! These are filling pancakes and though it did make 12 medium sized pancakes, everyone could only eat one - very filling. All in all pretty good variation and a good way to get vitamin A.

these were truly delish! Perfect consistency and soooo quick and easy to make.  I was out of cinnamon and allspice so I added a bit of nutmeg and clove to accompany the ginger.  It really would be much better with cinnamon.  I also added some vanilla.  Great pancakes-- I've been looking for a way to use leftover canned pumpkin and these are perfect! Thanks.

These were yummy and pumpkin-y, without being overwhelming.  My son (9) liked them.  The deep orange color is very appealing.  These would look wonderful on a buffet next to regular pancakes.  A lovely contrast.

My family enjoyed these pancakes.  I found that they were too thick and a little bland.  So I changed the milk to egg nog and increased it by 1/2 cup.  It became more flavorfull and thinner.  We really enjoyed the recipe.

The taste wasn't as sweet as I expected. I added  more sugar.  The recipe process stopped after the dry ingredients, that flagged me, then I questioned why use white vinegar? I cooked one without the vinegar, it tasted okay, after adding sugar, then before I finished off the batter I added the vinegar, it gave it a kick that I didn't think it needed.  Overall, quite a festive and different treat.

Tastes good, is filling, and gets more pumpkin into my diet.  Batter was too thick, difficult too cook all the way through so I used the ladle to push the top around and make thee pancake thinner.  Could also try adding more milk

Absolutely fabulous pancakes.  I amped up the spices with 1 T. cinnamon, 1 t. ginger, some cloves and allspice.  I did not need any additional milk.  The pancakes tasted wonderful and were light.

I made these for the first time this morning.  They were excellent!  The only changes I made were to add a bit more pumpkin and cinnamon.  Other than that, I made them per the recipe.  From now on, this will be my "go to" recipe for pumpkin pancakes.

We made this recipe into apple pancakes by substituting one cup unsweetened applesauce. (I had started the batter and then realized I did not have any pumpkin!) all the spices just the same. Everyone loved them!

This recipe is quite good. I made a few tweaks: (1) Instead of two cups of flour I did 1.5 cups and added 1/2 cup of oat flour to make the 2 cups. (2) I added a pinch of nutmeg to the batter  (I like nutmeg).  (3) Added a bit more milk to batter. Other than that the pancakes were amazing

I will make it again. It was an easy recipe. I like a little more pumpkin flavor so I added a little more pumpkin.

I donât know what I did wrong, but mine didnât turn out as great as everyone elseâs reviews. The only reason Iâm giving it three stars is to give it the benefit of the doubt that maybe it was me. these were very thin, and floppy. Trying to flip these with a nightmare. The outer edges cooked long before the middle was even close to being ready to flip. And even when they were done cooking they just crumbled onto the plate. Starting it on medium high led to it burning before the inside was cooked.  the flavor was ok...nothing special.

They were nice dense pumpkin pancakes. Very filling and tasty! I tweaked with Mexican Vanilla and fresh ground cinnamon.

I thought it looked really good because of all of the good reviews but then I made it and used exactly all of the ingredients and the right amount of them but when I tried to cook them it took me about half an hour and the middle wouldnât cook no matter what I did. I donât think that Iâll make these again.

Taste is great, but the recipe makes the pancakes unbearably thick and it sticks something terrible. Iâve tweaked the recipe with much more milk and oil/ghee to fix those issues.

I had to look back at the recipe to make sure I had followed it correctly.  The pancake batter was entirely too thick and I used fresh pumpkin puree which is actually waterier than canned.  Quite a disappointment.

My intent was to make a healthier version of the pancakes. I substituted all purpose flour for half whole wheat and half bisquick since I didn't have any white flour.  I also used skim milk and TruvÃ¬a brown sugar. My family LOVED the pancakes and I'm the hero today! Yay!  Definitely  thinking about pulling this recipe back out for Christmas morning breakfast.

Excellent.  This recipe will be made many more times.  I subbed 1/4c AP flour for Whole Wheat. Did add extra splash of  milk to thin the batter a bit.  Also I upped the cinnamon.  Served chopped pecans & fresh cranberries on the side.

Good pancakes.  I used 2 cups of buttermilk instead of the milk and vinegar.  Added a 2nd egg and used 1/2 c of whole wheat flour in place of the regular white flour, which I have found to improve the flavor and nutrition profile of regular buttermilk pancakes.  Will make again.

Only thing I changed was adding a little more milk to thin the batter. I'd suggest 2 cups, not 1 1/2 cups. Delicious recipe!

Followed recipe to the "T" . First batch turned out very thick, cake like and gooey. Second batch added more milk, nicely thick but gooey. In my cooking experience adding additional wet ingredients such as pumpkin puree they make them have an unsatisfying texture. Some people may like but just not for my family.

I subbed whole wheat flour and omitted the oil, added a teaspoon or so of vanilla extract. They were awesome! Mixture was a little thick for the first batch, added a few more splashes of milk for subsequent batches which helped. Even thinned out, the batter puffs up in the pan. Husband said "these are the best pancakes I've had in a long time".

These are the most incredible pancakes I have ever had. I didnât have vinegar, so I used lemon juice. However, that was the only substitution I made. I did use an immersion blender on the purÃ©e and liquids to thoroughly blend those together before gently folding them into the dry ingredients.  The batter was barely incorporated and lumpy. I definitely did not over mix it.

As many others have mentioned, when the recipe is followed, the batter is very thick a takes forever to cook through. I turned down the heat and let them cook until they were done. Unfortunately,  they were no longer pancakes at that point, but could better be described as "cakes." I was also not impressed with the taste.

I added some sugar, cinnamon and cloves, and put the rest of the batter into a greased muffin tin and baked them for 25 - 30 minutes at 325Â°F. They make delicious muffins !

Added cinnamon chips to them, which really added a sweet and more fall-y taste to the pancakes.

These are excellent and this coming from someone that doesnât usually eat pancakes. They are light and arenât overcome with pumpkin flavor or spice. Will make again. Surprise your guest with this breakfast.

The BEST!  I have made this many times for family and friends.  I get requests for it when people visit now.  I sometimes add some choc chip to the batter for the kids.  They love it.

This was great! Used the Savory Spice Pumpkin Pie Seasoning 1T; visiting adult son loved it for weekend brunch. Fed three adults with two pancakes for another meal.

made with homemade pancake puree from our garden that I had frozen the previous year.  The batter was really thick, and it made a lot of pancakes.  husband and kids said it  tasted almost like a pumpkin muffin.  Put homemade apple jelly or apple butter on them.  Everyone liked them.

This is a wonderful recipe. Instead of regular milk, I used soymilk (mixed with the vinegar in a separate bowl to obtain a buttermilk consistency), and instead of regular flour, I used gluten free flour - and these pancakes still came out fantastic! Easy to make, satisfying and delicious.

I was out of eggs so substituted 1 flax egg (1 tbsp ground flax and 3 tbsp water) used whey strained from homemade yogurt instead of milk and needed about an extra 1/4 as the pancakes were a little thick. I substituted 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg and 1/8 tsp cloves as I didnât have all spice

I made this for my daughter's friends.  One of them told me they tasted like baking powder.  I agreed.  They were alright  if you added enough syrup but alone they were blah.  I'm not sure if it needed more sugar, or cinnamon, or something else.

Taste great.  Add more pumpkin and cinnamon, if you like.  I made the gluten-free and normal.  I could not get them off the griddle fast enough.  Grill up the leftover batter and toast the next morning.  MMMMM.

I made these exactly as the recipe specified (no tweaks) and they were amazing!  I was really surprised - I expected them to be flat and gummy, but they rose up like regular pancakes.  They are a bit denser than regular pancakes due to the pumpkin (don't expect them to be exactly the same as regular pancakes) but oh, so delicious!!!  One tip I will share is that these need to cook a little bit longer than regular pancakes, so be patient.  I had batter left over, so I put it in the refrigerator.  I took it out this morning, gave it a good stir and cooked up another batch.  They rose even higher this morning!  Delish!!!  Definitely a recipe I will keep!  Thank you for posting it, Ruth!

I followed the recipe to the letter.  The batter is THICK but don't be alarmed and add more liquid!  I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to dollop the batter on the griddle and then sort of "smeared" it around to make the pancake thinner.  I served with maple syrup, toasted pecans, whipped cream from a can, and a sprinkle of nutmeg on top.  FANTASTIC!

Normally I read reviews before trying new recipes on here, but this one time I was just looking spur-of-the-moment for a pancake recipe that included some canned pumpkin. This one was unfortunately a bad choice for me. I really wish I had seen where people had said âthis is great with some tweakingâ and also the ones who said âdonât thin the batterâ though I donât think that wouldâve helped much... My husband and I were unable to eat what resulted from this recipe (and he will seriously eat ANYTHING).  Admittedly I did substitute almond milk because I didnât have regular milk, but that shouldnât affect things drastically. Although now Iâm thinking maybe it did? Milk + vinegar to simulate buttermilk?  If thatâs the idea, I feel the recipe should really have stated that. And then of course after the first couple were so crazy thick I thinned the batter with water until it was a little tiny bit closer to the consistency Iâm used to.  But (after we made ALL of the batter into what appeared to be passable, nicely cooked pancakes) what we wound up with were overly-chewy yet suspiciously moist in the middle. Like, not-cooked-all-the-way-through moist. Even tried popping one or two in the microwave for a bit to see if they could be salvaged that way, but they were just totally unpalatable. Iâm sure this recipe works fine with tweaks. Iâm sure the recipe author makes perfectly edible pancakes - maybe I would even like them. But I donât feel the recipe as-written gave me proper expecta

We substituted buttermilk in place of milk/vinegar, we run a B&B and make all pancakes/waffles with fresh buttermilk.  The batter turned out really thick and although we increased the spices it still tasted somewhat bland. We will make this again, guests loved it, it was not too sweet (good thing)

We cooked about 2 1/2 min on one side and 2 on the other on a 350F griddle... So 4 stars - good not great (lemon ricotta pancakes, now that's 5*)

These were perfect! More dense than fluffy, just an FYI. I used 2tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the mix suggested, just for convenience.

These pancakes are amazing. Donât try to make giant pancakes in a 11âskillet like I did the 3nd time. They were too big and burned before they could cook right. Make nice small size ones. Delicious

These were delicious. I used apple cider vinegar, because I didnât see any specification as to which type of vinegar to use, and apple cider vinegar seemed appropriate. The only change I made was due to not having the separated spices. Instead I used 2.5 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I whipped together a quick cream cheese, butter, and maple syrup sauce to top it off. It was a hit, my son said the combo was better than cinnamon rolls!

Kids and adults both liked it.  We had some left over pumpkin I was looking to use and this was the perfect find.  I didnât have a full cup of pumpkin so added a spoonful of sour cream and it turned out great.  We had it with maple syrup and bananas.  It also made a good amount for our large family.

These are light and tasty.   Easy to make and loved by my family.   Took some to a sick friend who also thought they were one of the better pumpkin pancakes she has had.  Will be making these again.

I made this recipe as per directions except that I added nutmeg to the spices.  I mixed the milk with the vinegar rather than adding them separately - not sure that makes a difference but I wanted the two to be well mixed.  The batter is very thick but they are a "meaty" pancake.  For me the batter made 3 large pancakes. (8" to 9")

So, I tried this recipe and I really was hoping for more pumpkin flavor and maybe more like pumpkin pie... anyway, I did use chocolate chips for one of the batches and that was pretty awesome!!!

Oh so yummy! The recipe as is = delicious. I added a dash of vanilla and about 3/4 cup chopped walnuts and my husband said it tasted like pumpkin pie for breakfast! Especially when served with whipped cream...yummy...

They were fairly bland tasting without the syrup and whipped cream I added, and a few of them turned out raw in the middle, but I think thats just because this was only my 2nd time making pancakes so I'm still learning!

Changed this to a gluten free recipe. Instead of wheat flour I added 1 1/2 cups of rice flour and 1/2 cup of tapioca starch. I didn't have all spice or ginger on me so I just left out those and added a teaspoon of nutmeg. Turned out great!

Outstanding recipe. Pancakes were very fluffy and the spices were just right. Don't know if I really needed the brown sugar in the batter since I put pure maple syrup on them.  The fewer calories, the better.

These were delicious! I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to pour the batter and spread it into a pumpkin shape on the griddle. It worked perfectly and they turned out great. My kids loved them! I recommend topping them with maple syrup and a little whipped topping.

Made pancakes and they were good.  They are thick so you have to cook longer than regular pancakes.  I made brown sugar and cinnamon filling and cream cheese drizzle that I found from another recipe and they were fantastic!  Will make again

I made these pancakes with my preschool students, two different classrooms ages 2 and pre-k. Even the pickiest of my students loved the pancakes and the students were heard saying, "I could eat these all day long." I posted the recipe for the parents because the students wanted to make them at home!!

Absolutely mouth-watering yummy pumpkin-ness for your belly. Do yourself a favor and follow this recipe exactly!! (Except maybe sub the individual spices for pumpkin spice mix, as was suggested. Worked great for me!). The pumpkin isnât overpowering but provides a gentle richness that allows the zing-y spices and fluffy texture to truly shine! Sprinkle with powdered sugar, sliced almonds, chocolate chips, and a drizzle of maple syrup and youâre in fall-heaven. I could go on but Ima go eat some more now.

Not bad Pumpkin Pancakes,  The reason I said "not bad" is because when I saw vinegar in a pancake recipe, I thought, "ewe! how gross!" and the pancakes were going to have a vinegar taste. I did taste the batter and it had that vinegar taste, but after cooking them, and eating them I could not taste the vinegar.  I really do not know what the vinegar does in a pancake mix, but this is a new concept to me.  
So I did make it according to the recipe and the pumpkin pancakes were pretty good I must say. I would make them again.  I did use real pumpkin (not canned) in which, after carved, I cut the pumpkin in huge cubes and boiled on the stove for 2 to three hours on low to medium heat until soft.  Then I drained the pumpkin and used an electric mixer until it became a puree.  I added the puree into the mix and then followed the rest of the recipe.  I did use 1tsp of pumpkin pie spice in place of the allspice, cinnamon, and ginger. I mixed the dry with the wet and with an ice cream scoop, I scooped the batter and put in on the hot griddle.  
Recommendation:  If you have some pecans, chopped them up finely. When you put the batter on the griddle, sprinkle the pancakes with the chopped pecans. This gives it a nice compliment flavor.  Also, make an Apple Cider Syrup to drizzle on top.  Add your favorite coffee blend with Pumpkin creamer or a glass of apple cider; talk about a nice Fall Breakfast.

I was very disappointed. I wish I read the reviews first since many 5 stars were rated on their own version of the recipe and not the original posted version. They are correct. This lacked in pumpkin flavor, needed more salt and spices. It was more cake like than a pancake texture.

I will definitely make these again!  I loved the ginger and allspice, and the kids gobbled them up.  I was out of cinnamon but I used a bit of cinnamon flavoring.  I used almond milk in place of cow's milk because I am dairy free.  Thanks Ruth!  Mmmm mmmmm good.

Followed the advice of others and used an extra egg and  more spices (2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and ginger). The grandkids LOVED them??

Made this recipe for a couple at our Bed and Breakfast and they were over-the-moon about these pancakes. I printed out the recipe just for them. Will definitely be putting this recipe into our fall repertoire. They are super fluffy and have just enough pumpkin to be flavorful to the taste but not overbearing. Just sprinkle with a dusting of powdered sugar and you've got what looks like a masterpiece.

These turned out perfectly! So fluffy and delicious, not overwhelmingly pumpkin or spice, but just right. The batter was a bit thick, but I used it as it was, just spreading it a bit thinner as I put it on the griddle, and the pancakes cooked up nicely browned on the outside and tender and cakey, not doughy, on the inside. I had bought some pumpkin butter from Trader Joe's, and it was perfect on the pancakes instead of syrup (although they were great with maple syrup, as well). Hearty enough that we made for a "breakfast for supper" meal.

I would definitely make this again. I followed the recipe but left out ground ginger since I didn't have any. It was delicious! It's lightly sweet and the flavor is not too strong.

I used the whole can of pumpkin and reduced the sugar, since they'll end up in maple syrup anyway. Very fluffy and so delicious.

We loved these pancakes, they are so flavorful you don't even need bacon! Note: the batter turns out thick, but as other reviewers have recommended, do NOT thin the batter with more milk bc it will dilute the flavor...and understandably our pancakes were thick but yummy.  I doubled the recipe (yielding around 17-18 (5") pancakes) so we'll have enough for dinner one night this week! All in all, a very filling, satisfying breakfast; one we will definitely make again!

Itâs absolutely delicious! I didnât have vinegar home so I substituted with lemon juice. I also added a 1/4 salt as mentioned by another reviewer. Everyone loved them! Itâs like having a little pumpkin pie cake :)

Made these tonight to satisfy a pumpkin urge.   All in all, I would say there isnât enough liquid in the recipe and it needs a spice mix update.    Authentic pumpkin pie spice contains cloves which are totally missing here, and while it seemed I was putting a lot of spice in, it wasnât because the mix was funky.    I used Libbeyâs pumpkin pie filling from the can.

These are great! I used buttermilk, and still added the vinegar, and they turned out perfect. Batter is a little thick, be sure to spread it some when you put it on the griddle. I added some chopped pecans to the tops of the uncooked side, then flipped...very tasty addition. I hate to get up in the morning to measure, etc, so I mixed all the dry ingred and wet ingred separately the night before, then all I had to do was combine them in the morning....easy-peasy!

I made this exactly as the recipe except for an equal substitution of apple pie spice for the spices. The pancakes were delicious in taste and my 2 year old gobbled them up. But the texture is not right. Almost as if not quite cooked all the way. Soft and not fluffy at all. I will try again using the recommendation of whole wheat flour and an extra egg.

These turned out beautiful. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great! I served them with my butter pecan syrup. (1 tablespoon melted butter, 1/2 cup of warmed maple syrup, and 1/4 c chopped pecans). Perfect for a fall morning.

I subbed 2.5 c dry pancake mix for the flour, bkg powder, bkg soda & salt because I'm lazy. Used 1 3/4 c evaporated milk (not skim) and ACV, and 2.5 t pumpkin pie spice to replace the allspice/cinnamon/ginger spices, also bc I'm lazy.  They were gobbled UP!

Delicious, fluffy, and flavorful--everything you could want in a pumpkin pancake! I didn't have milk so I used mostly water and a dollop of yogurt.

These are the best pumpkin pancakes I have ever had!! I only replaced the allpurpose flour with King Arthur premium whole wheat flour instead. This recipe makes such light, fluffy and delicous pancakes. I made these for my son's birthday yesterday. These were a hit! We will definately be making this recipe often.

My kids request pancakes every weekend and I was trying to get rid of old stuff in the pantry (canned pumpkin never used at Thanksgiving) so this recipe was a win-win. 
Armed with a can of pumpkin puree and a dream I started without making sure we had everything, per usual. 
Ended up having to substitute:
- milk with unsweetened vanilla almond milk
- applesauce for oil
- pumpkin pie spice for allspice
Not sure how the substitutions affected the end result since this was the first time, but they turned out great. Excited to make them again with WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS!

Very good!  I had fresh pumpkin left from baking Thanksgiving pumpkin pies.  Fresh is best if you can.  I did not use allspice because I wanted to control the spice, so I did cloves, ginger, nutmeg (1/4 tsp each) and kept the cinnamon as is.  Beat my egg before I added it to the batter and went to town.  Winner winner chicken dinner!  Kids loved it!  Super moist pancakes and full of flavor.  I added chocolate chips to the last of the batter.  Kids loved that too.  Itâs like ranch dressing for pancakes.  Very good recipe.  Fluffy, flavorful pancakes, not at all dense.

I followed the recipe exactly. They turned out wonderful. They were light, fluffy and moist. and I got rave reviews from all our relatives-adults and children. The thicker texture worked well for me as I could easily manipulate the perimeter to make perfectly shaped pancakes that usually run all over. My husband did say he wished they would have been more "pumpkiny". The flavor was mild but that worked for me so you could still taste the topping. I topped with cinnamon applesauce (yummy!!) I'll definitely make these again

A great recipe!!  I used fresh pumpkin.  Also I did use 1\2 cup of cream and 1 cup of milk.  I added a quick pour of vanilla.  Because I used up my pie spice I used cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg.  Definitely will make again.  My family enjoyed it Thanksgiving morning.

These were delicious! The only thing i changed was i used 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice because i didnt have the ones called for. Also the batter is very thick so i did what another reviewer said and put a 1/4 cup batter in the hot pan and spread out the pancake with a spoon. My kids LOVED THEM!

Followed the recipe as written the 1st time but everyone wanted it more like pumpkin pie.  Next try was 1/2 tsp each of cloves and ginger, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Everyone voted for version #2.

We like using whole wheat flour--use the same measurements for everything, but with the whole wheat use  1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour! Absolutely delicious. I will definitely make it again!

I questioned adding vinegar to the recipe and I was right!  I tasted the batter and it tasted terrible! I had to add considerable brown sugar to get rid of the vinegar flavor in my pancakes! There are better recipes out there!

I added a little bit of milk to thin the pancake batter. Cook it low and slow. The vinegar was a curiosity to me but the pancakes were delicious so I would recommend keeping it in.

This recipe is great! The pancakes are so fluffy and pumpkiny. I followed everything except I subbed half the AP flour for whole wheat. I was worried about the vinegar, but you can't taste it. Also, toddler approved!

The pancake is denser than most people prefer. Interesting recipe, but just fair to me.

Absolutely delicious! I substituted 1/2 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour, as I often do when I make pancakes, but it made it a bit more heavy than I'd like, when combined with the pumpkin, so next time I think I'll just stick with the regular flour. I also added some pumpkin pie spice (based on the suggestion of another commenter), along with the listed spice ingredients. The flavor is great! I also had many leftover to freeze. I definitely look forward to making these again.

I made it vegan and sugar-free with the following changes: used unsweetened original-flavor almond milk instead of cow's milk, used a flax egg (1 Tbsp ground flax + 3 Tbsp water, mixed, and let sit for 5 mins) instead of a chicken egg, and omitted the sugar (since I figured I'd add syrup to the top anyway).  We also used whole wheat flour because that's all we had.  These pancakes turned out soooo good.  There are only 2 in our household and we had leftovers for 2 more days, and they reheated in a frying pan just fine.

This gets 5 stars for taste, but I felt the batter was too thick.  I had to add milk as I went along (unsure of amount as I went more by sight).  As a disclaimer, I did use buttermilk in place of the milk and vinegar because usually mixing milk and vinegar is a buttermilk substitute.  This will be new go-to pumpkin pancake recipe.

My 16 year old makes these pretty often and they are delicious, especially with the cinnamon syrup recipe from this site. They freeze well, too- just pop them in the toaster right out of the freezer!

Made these this morning for breakfast! They were spectacular! I did add some chocolate chips and switched up the spices just a bit to suit my taste (cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice). I will be making these again for sure!

Will definitely make again...came out very fluffy and nice flavor.  I made some with chocolate chips and that was really good too.  Only reason I gave 4 stars was because I cook pancakes on low to medium low temperature.  They needed a little more time than normal pancakes to cook all the way through (wetter batter with the pumpkin) and if I cooked them on medium high heat I'm pretty sure that would have been very dark, if not burnt on the outsides.

These pumpkin pancakes were fabulous! The pumpkin taste came through, enhanced rather than overwhelmed by the spices. The batter is rather thick so the first ones I made were a little doughy, but after using a smaller amount and spreading it a little they turned out perfectly. Will definitely make these again.

I loved this recepie.  To make things easier I used 1 tbsp of pumpkin spice as it also includes nutmeg and I left out the vinegar.  This will be my go to recipe as it is very similar to my basic pancake recipe with banana.  Now I will just sub the pumpkin.

Best pancakes I've ever made, bar none.  My 4 year old granddaughter said the same thing.  Better than her favourite apple/cinnamon "Gramma cakes".  With local maple syrup and bacon, heaven on a plate!

I probably wonât make it agai, it was really hard to get the pancakes to cook evenly because of the pumpkin but maybe because Iâm not the most experienced pancake maker, who knows... but the recipe was great and they tasted good just were extremely hard to cook and flip.

I made this exactly as recipe states. It was delicious. Served my hubby and a neighbour and the three of us devoured them. I run a Bed & Breakfast and was trying out the recipe. I will definitely serve to guests. 

The only thing I couldn't find was how many pancakes this recipe makes. It is a large batch. About 20 average pancakes. Next time I would have the recipe.

These were awesome, even the next day. It makes a lot of thick batter, so we put the rest in the fridge and had more the next day. I liked it when the oil was really hot in the pan and it crisped up the edges. I'll be making them again!

Amazing! Like some other reviewers, I skipped straight to buttermilk rather than use regular milk and vinegar. Be not dismayed - this batter is thick! Just spread it out with a spoon right after you drop it (it drops more than pours). But very much worth the effort - we paired ours with pure maple syrup. So delicious!

We used dark brown sugar. Going to try golden brown next to time as it was not specified in the recipe. Did add some regular granulated sugar to the recipe. 
Made a cream cheese frosting drizzle instead of syrup. But everyone loved them. Will make again.

I doubled the recipe as I wanted to use the entire can of pumpkin.  This made a lot of pancakes!  Very fluffy and flavorful.  My kids liked a enough that they each had 4-5.  I liked that it has more protein and overall better than bisquick.  I substituted oil for coconut oil, but next time might use applesauce instead as the c.o. solidified before mixing with ingredients.  I froze the rest to have on hand and will also make again.

Absolutlely delicious! We are huge fans. I make these often for my three year old who just loves the "cake cakes"
The only thing I do differently is use pumpkin pie spice (it is what I have on my spice rack)
Thank you, Ruth!

I enjoyed this recipe, but making it as is, my pancakes were very dense. I had trouble getting them to spread thin and evenly to cook. The flavor was amazing, and between my roommate and I we finished the whole batch, but next time I'll try to change something around so that they're a little fluffier.

I swapped out the flour for a gluten-free blend. Then I discovered I only had half the amount of pumpkin called for, so rather than halve the batch I used applesauce to make up for the missing pumpkin. Used pecans and a few chocolate chips for add-ins...just stunning.

So delicious. I got at least   24 or more nice size pancakes.  Puff up so nicely.  Love the idea to use applesauce rather then oil. Will be sure to serve these to our grandchildren  when they come.

This was really good! I'm surprised by how little sugar the pancakes have in them, and by how much I enjoyed them given that I don't love pumpkin or pumpkin pie. It's a simple enough recipe, difficult to mess up, although I found a way and used tablespoons of baking powder and baking soda (luckily I think I managed to get most of it out). Thank you for sharing!

I did not like these. They were too dense and had to much spice for me. If you like a light fluffy pancake this is not a recipe for you! Not only that but i found the center didnt cook evenly either, it was mushy and gross.

Good pancakes in general.  The directions are missing some important steps.  The point of the Vinegar is to add it to the milk to curdle it; you need to add it to the milk about 5 minutes  before you add the milk to the rest of the ingredients.    I modified the recipe by using melted butter instead of oil and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.

Yes, I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and really liked it better! Also made a meal with adding the pumpkin pancakes with chilie over the top, this was great for lunch and dinner ideas.  Another time,  I tried 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white, this was also good, not too heavy and not too light. Another variation I liked was using  organic coconut milk and using 1/2  coconut flour and 1/2 white, this was good too. Topped with maple syrup for breakfast is delicious makes a golden morning. I want to do it everyday!

Turned out great. I used pumpkin pie spice mix instead of individual spices, and my cup of pumpkin was heaping. I might even add a little more pumpkin next time. Flavour is great, they turned out nice and fluffy but are heartier than a regular pancake. I will definitely make these again.

I cut the recipe in half and bec of that used 1 whole egg. I also added vanilla (shouldn't all baked goods have vanilla) pecans and cardamon (underused spice... think chai tea!) I left out the vinegar bec my milk was a little off already. (yes I know there is a difference between spoiled milk and sour milk)

I tried fellow reviewer RobnMandy's slightly modified version.
Result was a fabulous and flavorful pancake.  I will however add a touch more milk next time around as the batter was very thick and needed several flips for batter to be fully cooked.

I have made this recipe several times and it always turns out delicious.  It is a bit of work to get everything measured, but it's worth it for pancakes that smell and taste amazing.

Made these pancakes exactly as the recipe called for.  I use butter on the griddle for some extra yummy flavor.  Have also made these with oat flour instead of all purpose flour as a gluten free option.  Just add real maple syrup and enjoy!

These took about thirty minutes to make so I only make them for special occasions and supper.  The spices are not overwhelming and it's not too sweet.  My daughter and I love them with cream cheese between two pancakes and a little maple syrup (or sometimes no syrup.)  For Halloween and Thanksgiving, we cut them out with a giant pumpkin-shaped cookie cutter and throw in some mini-chocolate chips in to the batter (dark chocolate if we can find it.)

I made the recipe as is, except added 1 tsp. of vanilla and increased the cinnamon to 1 TBSP. as some reviewers suggested. Let the batter sit for about a half hour before cooking. Delicious. Did not even really need syrup. Will definitely be making these again (we had them Christmas morning). Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

We found these very good and flavorful.  I almost always make the recipe as directed. The only thing I might change is adding more spices as I love cinnamon.

I've made these at least 3 times in the past 2 months. That's how good they are. I just add a bit more brown sugar and  cinnamon.  I was looking for a recipe that matched if not  succeeded Denny's and boy did these hit the bull's-eye. These are better! Try them you won't regret it.  I store them in sets of two in the  freezer and put them in the  toaster for breakfast and they are as good as new.

I personally thought these were pretty good, but my husband did not, and my kids just thought they were just okay.  The batter was fairly thick, so it took a lot of work getting them out of bowl and spreading on the griddle, but once cooked, they didn't taste overly thick.  Not sure they were worth the effort --there were no requests to make them again.

Excellent recipe. The only adjustment I made (when I halved the recipe for 3 servings) was to use a full cup if milk. This did not dilute the pumpkin/spice seasoning, and was necessary as the batter was far too thick without the additional milk. Big thumbs up!

Good but a little too grainy for me. I added more milk to thin out the batter. Disappointed that I did not really taste the pumpkin.

Made these with changes. Opted for lite coconut milk for the milk (what I had on hand) and combined whole wheat pastry flour and white wheat flour for the AP. Used pumpkin pie spice (trying to use this up forever!) in place of the individual spices. And apple cider vinegar. Made a 1/2 recipe but kept the whole egg, so I guess it would be 2 eggs for a whole recipe. We thought the texture was fine, like a pancake. And they puff up a lot. We ate them plain but maple syrup would be good too!

The flavor was mediocre, and the batter didn't bubble letting me know it was time to turn the pancakes, so the first batch burned. I turned the temperature down for the second batch, and the pancakes were undercooked. I can't recommend these, and I'm not going to bother trying to improve upon them.

I followed the recipe as written.  I portioned out 1/4 cup scoops, and used the spoon to spread out the mixture (since it was thick). This worked perfect, and they came out fluffy and delicious.  I made these a 2nd time and added chocolate chips and that was good too.  This is a great change for the fall and seasonal type breakfast!

I made these 2 days ago because I wanted to test the recipe to see if it would be good to serve overnight Thanksgiving guests on Friday morning, well it was more than good these pancakes were out of this world, if I could give them more stars I would. Even my husband who really wasn't a pumpkin pancake in the past really loved these.  He said he can't wait to have them again on Friday morning after Thanksgiving.  I made them as written and they were awesome. Thank you so much...HOLIDAY BLESSINGS TO EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!

This recipe is da bomb! It's our go-to pancake recipe that our whole family l Ioves. I make double batches and freeze them in smaller portions for quick breakfasts.  They're good by themselves, with yogurt, applesauce, syrup, or applesauce/syrup combo (my favorite). I've added extra pumpkin, bananas, apple chunks, wheat germ...there's no screwing these up. They're amazing!

These are so good.  I didn't add as much allspice, and added 1 tsp. salt.  The vinegar works with the soda to make them fluffier in texture.  I didn't even use syrup.  Just a little melted butter.  I will make these again!

Love this recipe. I add 1/4 cup more milk because the batter is incredibly thick, but overall it is an amazing recipe that totally captures the pumpkin flavor. My kids are crazy about it as well.

These were great! Only change we made was only using cinnamon and nutmeg as I had no ginger or pumpkin pie spice on hand. Also added a splash of vanilla. Yum!

Nice and fluffy. You have to be strategic when placing the batter but that's just because of the great light texture the pumpkin brings to the mix. Family ate them up!

Awesome! Add a 1/2 cup flour. I like a thicker pancake. To make into waffles add 1 tbsp oil/butter per cup of flour. yummy!!!

These pancakes are great. The only change I made was to add 1/2 teaspoon cloves. I often add cloves to any recioe that calls for cinnamon and nutmeg or all spice. It just "pops" the flavor of the other spices. To those who changed the recipe by using pancake mix, please try the recipe as written with the flour, sugar, egg, etc. Taking the time to make as directed is well worth the few extra minutes it will take you. Since this recipe will not use the entire  can of pumpkin, just freeze what's leftover and use it to make a half batch of the pancakes.

I added more 1 tsp extra of cinnamon and cloves to add to the flavor. They are very sticky pancakes, so make sure to grease your pan frequently and cook over low heat.

they are tasty pancakes but kinda heavy not fluffy. I also had to add an extra 1/2 cup milk to thin them out so they would cook properly. We enjoyed them well enough but won't make them again.

I did make two changes - I used half & half white & whole wheat flour, and added more milk (maybe 1/2 c.), as it was too thick to pour. They were fantastic, and are now on our "Keeper" menu.

New cottage tradition for thanksgiving brunch! Didn't have allspice or ginger on hand but these were still amazing - taste and consistency!  Served with sautÃ©ed apples,  homemade apple cider syrup and a side of Canadian bacon.

These were great! Didn't make any changes but I didn't have vinegar or all spice so I skipped he vinegar and used 1/2 a teaspoon of ground cloves and 1/2 a teaspoon of ground ginger to replace the all spice. They came out delicious! Very thick like others have said. But I just spread them around and made sure they were done on the inside. 
I served them with an option of maple syrup or a cream cheese glaze. Everyone loved them!

Great recipe! I didn't have regular milk, so I used almond milk and it came out great! I also added a dash of nutmeg and cloves for a more spiced up  flavor.

I liked this recipe it was loved by the whole family and definitely a do again! The only thing I would change is adding more cinnamon, nutmeg, and due to a lack of pumpkin taste 1 1/2 cans of pumpkin puree.

I made these for myself and the kiddos this morning and they gobbled them right up!  That might have been assisted by the white chocolate chips that I put in them.  These have great pumpkin flavor and are a thick and hearty, yet fluffy pancake.  I will definitely be making these again.

This recipe is an excellent start to the perfect pumpkin pancakes. A little light on the pumpkin flavor, as other reviewers have shared, so next time I try these, I'd like to double the pumpkin and add less milk so they're not too wet. Very, very moist, as all things pumpkin should be! Adding mini chocolate chips is an obvious and welcome tweak, and I much prefer freshly whipped cream on my pumpkin pancakes rather than syrup. Also note that sugar is actually a wet ingredient, so the brown sugar should be added to the milk and pumpkin mixture.

Great recipe! I followed some other reviewers suggestions and increased the pumpkin to 1 1/3c. I also mixed the brown sugar in with the wet ingredients, not the dry. I increased the cinnamon to 1 TBSP and added 1/2tsp of ground nutmeg (eliminating the allspice). I also omitted the vingear and instead used 1/3c vanilla soy milk (its what I had on hand). Lastly, I sprinkled chopped pecans into the freshly poured pancakes in the pan. YUM!!!

They were really good however I would add some salt perhaps 1/2 teaspoon. It would definitely help.

This is a great basic recipe that can be tweaked for individual tastes and ingredients on hand. I adjusted the spices to my liking by increasing cinnamon to 2 tsp and omitting the others. I had a very thick butternut squash soup base on hand and used it instead of pumpkin. (Most canned pumpkin is actually other types of squash). We are a gluten free family, thus I substituted my own gluten free flour blend cup for cup. I used 1 cup + splash of milk for the proper consistency as well.

I made this exactly like the recipe except I left out the ginger (not a fan) and it was wonderful!!! I made it for coworkers and brought butter and cinnamon sugar to top the pancakes. I'm glad a made 2 batches because it was all gone!!! I will absolutely make this again!

These pancakes were amazing!!  The only thing different I did was add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, which I do in my pumpkin pies as well.  The kids had their pancakes gone before I was even done cooking.  This was definitely a big hit!

They are tasty! But medium high is way too high. They burned super fast with the inside too doughy. I turned it down to medium and it was perfect. The consistency is nowhere near normal pancakes, so don't wait till they're all bubbled to flip them, or they'll be black. The batter is super thick. But once you figure out the right heat, they taste great!

Loved this recipe just as it is!  Was tempted to use 1 1/2 tsp of the pumpkin pie spice after reading several reviews; however, I went with the spices called for and it came out perfect!  It's a little dense so I understand why keeping the 1/4 cup measurement is key when cooking.  This is a keeper!  Thank you!!

These are good pancakes--we like the texture and flavor the way the recipe is written.  However, I'd prefer a stronger flavor from the pumpkin and spices. Increase pumpkin by at least a third (a whole can would be great), and add some extra spice to give it a more distinctive flavor.

Would be five stars but they turn out far to dense. While cooked, they still tasted and felt slightly raw. With added spices (more cinnamon, some nutmeg and cloves, no all-spice), the flavour was good (not as bland as some suggest) and they do make a hearty breakfast. In my case it made 24 medium pancakes. I would not make again but my husband enjoyed so they may show up again in our kitchen. Might add pecans next try.

The first time I made these, I made them almost exactly (I used up some pampered chef cinnamon blend for the total spice amount-same amount though).  The next time, I forgot about the pumpkin shortage.  So, I microwaved a sweet potato and used that.  I also realized, after we ate, that the vinegar was still sitting in it's little cup.  I added another tsp of spice blend.  They were BETTER!!!  They still rose beautifully.  Not sure if it was the lack of vinegar, the sweet potato or the extra spices but yummy!  I will make them this way from now on.  A sweet potato is pretty simple to nuke....8-10 minutes for one that will yield a cup of meat.

Made the recipe as is, but did have to add milk to thin the batter out.  It was too dense otherwise.  Adding more milk did take away from the pumpkin taste, so next time I'll need to add more spice.  Will definitely make again!

Followed a few suggested tweaks and these pancakes were out of this world!! Used pastry flour, added tsp of vanilla, used two eggs and one additional tablespoon of brown sugar (probably not essential but what the heck!). Sifted all the dry ingredients once mixed. Flavorful, light, airy, but still substantial. My kids loved them!

I made this for the first time last year and loved it. It's become something in our rotation of weekend breakfast foods. My kids love it and so do their friends. It's full of flavor and has my favorite thing PUMPKIN!.. The only thing I recommend is adding a little more milk then what's in the instructions because it is too thick if you don't.

This is by far the BEST homemade pancake recipe I've ever used! The pancakes were incredibly fluffy, but moist and flavorful. The only change I made was adding semi-sweet chocolate chips for an extra treat! We'll definitely be making this again.

I used kefer instead of  milk&vinegar and 2 eggs. I used my own pumpkin purÃ©e.  Added extra spice.  I found it a little thick so added extra kefer. It is an excellent recipe and will make it again.

I have made this recipe many times.  Tonight, however, for the first time, I used non-sugar sweeteners in the batter and baked it into a sheet cake rather than making pancakes.  For sweetener I used erythritol and stevia drops, and I also always use whole-wheat flour.  To counteract the extra bitterness and stronger flavor of this flour, I also always end up using a lot more spice and sweetener than the recipe calls for (3-4x the amt. given in the recipe).  Finally, I always double this recipe, and use 1 can of pumpkin puree for the whole thing instead of only using 1 cup then having some leftover in the can.  Anyway, it turned out GREAT and I'd recommend this recipe to anyone.  Delicious!!

An excellent recipe that is also simple and tasty.  The pancake taste just like pumpkin puree, which is creamy, sweet and satisfying. Bravo!

Delicious. You don't need to change a thing. We followed a recommendation that you use 1/4 cup for each pancake and they were a great size. They made moist but fluffy pancakes with great flavor. One boy even ate his plain without syrup.

Here's the thing... I love these pancakes and make them all the time BUT they frustrate me all the time too. They always seem uncooked in the middle and are never a fluffy pancake. That being said I freeze them individually and microwave them as needed. Once microwaved they are fine and no longer "doughy" inside. I've tried a million different variations of this recipe to avoid the doughy inside but no matter what they never really fluff the way they should. But I keep coming back to this recipe because it makes me feel better giving my kids these pancakes rather than traditional ones and the flavors are great... Oh the dilemma lol...

I used a whole can of pumpkin instead of one cup, and the pancakes turned out great...very soft with great pumpkin flavor.  I have also added chocolate chips (at the request of my teenage son), and this addition was fabulous, too!

I loved that these were from scratch!  We served them with toasted pecans and warmed real maple syrup... Because we try to eat more whole grains, we used one cup all-purpose flour and one cup whole wheat pastry flour.  We also used one and one-third cup canned pumpkin, like another reviewer suggested. ..I omitted the vinegar, but next time I will  try it. It might boost the flavor a little?

Loved these pancakes. I was out of milk, but had some leftover evaporated milk so I used that, but was still short so I used about a half cup of light eggnog. Because of the eggnog, I cut the brown sugar by 1 tablespoon. Results were a hit with my hubby and 11-year-old grandson. Will definitely make again.

Flipping awesome!  I am not a huge fan of pancakes but these are exceptional.  I made these and a quick, cream cheese glaze (bar of cream cheese, half a cup of confectioners sugar and vanilla).  The two combined are delicious.

Good golly miss Molly, these were yummy! The batter was as thick as mollsses on a cold day. I added probably about an extra quarter to half cup of milk. I also made them "whole grain" by swapping the flour as follows: 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup ground flax, 1 cup of all purpose flour. Due to the thickness I cut into them to make sure they were done. The knife came out gooey the first time so I flipped them again until the knife came out just a tiny bit moist. The four year old loved them and so did the wife. Yum-a-licous. Served with whipped cream and real maple syrup. Plenty of leftovers to toast for breakfast during the week.

I substituted butter for the oil and just went ahead and put the whole can of pumpkin in without measuring one cup. These are moist and it takes a while to cook, but totally worth it. I would suggest that you make smaller pancakes - they cook better and are easier to flip,

Gluten Free: I made these substituting a gluten free flour blend for the flour called for, and they came out amazing without any added changes. Some recipes need adapted more, but this one worked well with just switching out the flour. My husband and I loved them, and I can't wait to make them for the whole family next time!

The only thing I changed was to add more milk, it was a little thick for my liking and I used 1 1/2tbsp of pumpkin spice.

Vibrant flavor in a tender pancake. This recipe produced the fluffiest pancake batter I've ever seen!
I had a surplus of buttermilk on hand due to holiday baking, so I substituted buttermilk for milk in the recipe.

Could not get them to cook through. If I try again I would add more milk and pumpkin to make the batter thinner so it would cook better. Made them exactly as stated in the recipe. Got to taste only edges that would cook. Would cut back a bit on the spices.

Wonderful! The only thing I did different was use a biscuit-pancake mix to save time. I added extra pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon. Topped them with maple syrup and a dollop of whip cream. I refrigerated the left over pancakes and finished them off the next day. We agreed they were better the second day.

These were delicious, but I did follow the suggestion of another reviewer and changed the recipe for ease: 2 1/2 Cup Aunt Jemima Original Pancake Mix, 3 TBS brown sugar, 2 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1 egg, 1 3/4 cup milk, 2 TBS vegetable oil, 2 TBS vinegar, 1 cup pumpkin puree.  Everyone love the pancakes!

AWESOME recipe!  I substituted the 2 cups of all-purpose flour with 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, and 1/2 cup of rolled oats, then added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder.   Also used a cast iron skillet.  Came out moist, fluffy, and perfect!

My two-year-old ate a whole pile of these even after she already had cereal and half an egg. Use less flour and add honey, vanilla and ginger for more flavor.

I made these exactly according to the recipe and although the smell was good and they looked good while cooking, they would not cook in the middle.  My pancake-loving son family didn't like them.  Unless I made many changes in the recipe, I wouldn't use it again.

Great recipe. I adjusted the spices to my liking (cinnamon ginger and nutmeg). I also added a bit more milk. I made a half batch (used 1 egg and halved everything else.) The kids loved them!!

My family loves pumpkin anything, muffins, bread pudding and even smoothies. But didn't care much about these pancakes and said they liked my plain pancakes or banana pancake better !! These pancakes were lacking something ?!
I followed the recipe exactly, except adding 1/4 cup more milk to  the batter that was very thick.

this is great! it has the flavor of a pumpkin type cake to me but of course the texture of a pancake. this recipe is all about quality. I cooked these in a well loved cast iron skillet and used real maple syrup. I also added chopped pecans to the batter.   LOVE!!! so decadent

Maybe one reason why this wasn't perfect is because I doubled this recipe and "eyeballed" the ingredients. Even after adding more flour, baking soda, and baking powder (which is where I thought my problem lay),  I realized another reason why the pancakes would brown on the outside and remain wet on the inside: the pumpkin. It's so wet, yet there's still a ton of milk in the recipe. Or at least, that's the best reason I can come up with.

Since the pancakes were too wet to flip, I started using the batter for waffles, and that worked much better. Still a little wet, but delicious. I'll definitely make these on Thanksgiving (as waffles) with whipped cream on top!

My kids love this recipe, and so does my husband. I use half wheat flour and they are delicious. The only thing I change is I only use half the allspice called for, but the rest I leave the same.

Love this.  Do not change the recipe.  Batter will be thick. Do not dilute. Just pat it down a little on the griddle.

Excellent recipe! I've made these for a few years and would highly recommend them to anyone. 

Makes roughly 12 cakes. The bit about mixing liquids and dry separately and then combining is a must! The first time I made these I confused the baking powder qty with baking soda qty, that was not a crowd pleaser. The next time I mixed everything together at once, and that made the cakes a little more "doughy" than third time when I mixed liquid and dry separately. 

Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing with the world

Great recipe for Halloween morning!

I made it egg-free by mixing 1 tablespoon of flaxseed meal with 3 tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Let it sit for a few minutes and use it in place of the egg. 

Also cheated by using a couple teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice in place of all the spices. 

I used apple cider vinegar but I'm really not sure it made any difference.

Super yummy. However,  to make it more healthy I substituted flower with almond meal and the brown sugar with organic coconut sugar. I also used sesame seed oil as a substitute.

I used Libby's easy canned pumpkin pie which already has the seasonings and sugar mixed in. I decided to double the recipe, so i dumped in the entire large can of pumpkin, 2 1/2 cups of milk, 2 eggs, 4 tbsp of oil, (I skipped the vinegar completely because I was out,) added 4 tsp of baking powder, 2 tsp of baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt and VOILA! Perfecto!!!

I was a bit scared with 2 tablespoons of vinegar so reduced it to only 1 tbs. Also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and instead of adding spices separately I used 1 tsp of gingerbread spice mix and oh boy.... you need to try this recipe - served with maple syrup and bacon it is the best thing in the world!

My family loved them. Used fresh cooked pumpkin. The batter is thick but like others said, don't want to weaken the flavor. Served with real maple syrup and salted roasted pecans.  Hubby wants me to make bread pudding out of them for Christmas breakfast.

I followed the directions and the pancakes did not cook in the middle.  I had to keep squishing them to cook in the middle, which left a flat unappealing pancake. I won't be making these again.

I used Namaste GF  Waffle and Pancake Mix. These were VERY good! I also blended all wet ingredients in a cuisinart as recommended by another person. Then I blended the wet into the dry with a whisk to break up large clumps. GF flours are tricky. I think you could cut back on the milk. Mine were thinner than I expected, but still tasted great! Using a 1/4 cup to spoon the mixture into the griddle made for uniform pancakes. Topping them with homemade whipped cream and candied pecans made them AMAZING!

It didn't have a strong pumpkin flavor. I would make it again, but I would make some changes according to other people's reviews.

While I like the taste of the spices, these were crazy thick and should really be used as a waffle recipe.  If it was a waffle recipe I'd give it 5 stars.  These stuck so bad to my pan even with a ceramic or tufflon coat with butter!  I had to add well over a cup of milk after trying it at the recipes amounts.  I'll probably stick to my normal recipe and add the spices as well as added pumpkin spice.  I think that made it.

I followed the recipe as written, only substituting coconut sugar for brown sugar (due to diet restrictions).  I found the pancakes to be a little bland.  So, I doubled up the spices on a second batch and that made a huge difference.   Thanks for sharing this recipe - my family really enjoyed the pumpkin version of pancakes.  
Also - try them with cream cheese instead of syrup.  They are delicious.

The batter is so thick that it doesn't cook evenly despite being spread out with a spatula. The texture is just like a sponge and not in a good way. It's also completely flavorless.

It was way too thick. Had to add at least 1/2 c of milk to get a good pancake consistency. Otherwise very good and extra pancakes freeze well.

Fabulous! My family eats a lot of pancakes so I always make big batches and freeze them so they can just pull them out and heat and eat! Well most pancakes are fairly dull as well as the usual add ins. I have been looking for something a little different and I thought pumpkin! I like pumpkin but not pumpkin pie so I have been looking for random recipes. Found this and thought sounds good. I made a few tweaks though. I used 2 eggs, 1TBS  cinnamon, 1tsp each clove and nutmeg as well as 2tsps vanilla and 1TBS white sugar. I mixed dry ingredients 1st. In a separate bowl whisked the pumpkin puree by itself before adding the other wet ingredients. Then I combined it all, let sit for 5-10min then did about 1/4C for each pancake. It is a thick batter but spread it out and it's fine. They turned out fantastic and this made 26 2-3inch pancakes.

I only used cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg for my spices because it's all I had in the house.  but I didn't miss the allspice at all.  I think the vinegar was the secret weapon here.  It made them super fluffy!

This recipe was a little too thick for my preference.  I added 1/3 cup of water to thin it out, but it was still very thick.  Great taste and the family loved it otherwise!  I added 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips to sweeten it up a bit!

Successful using soymilk.  A little to much baking powder flavor. added more pumpkin and milk.  original recipe comes out very thick.  Nice but they burn before they are cooked inside.

We really enjoyed these pancakes. I substituted soy milk for regular milk so that it was dairy free, and I increased the cinnamon a little because I like cinnamon. The batter was so thick that I couldn't even spread it, so I had to thin it out with a little more soy milk. The pancakes tasted good, but I didn't like the ginger in them. I agree with the reviewer who recommended skipping the allspice and ginger and adding in some nutmeg instead while increasing the cinnamon. That's what I plan on doing next time.

Every year when we're at the shore, we go to Uncle Bill's for pancakes, and they have the most amazing pumpkin pancakes, served with cinnamon butter and whipped cream.  My daughter loves them.  So I told her I would try and make them when we got home this year.  This recipe was a good base, but I did as one reviewer stated and added more pumpkin, deleted the vinegar and ginger, and added more cinnamon and nutmeg.  I'm glad i did up the spices, because these would have been pretty bland.  Next time I may up the spices even more.  They  were delicious, dense pancakes and I served them with cinnamon butter (from this site), whipped cream and maple syrup.  My daughter said they tasted like Uncle Bill's!  I will definitely make these again, but with all the changes.

I like pumpkin, especially in the fall so I did enjoy these. The biggest issue I had was that my batter was very thick. I ended up adding about 1/4 cup more of milk after I made about 8 pancakes and it was still fairly thick but manageable. I did not have allspcie so had to omit that, over all my husband and I enjoyed. Yummy with a cup of coffee

I made these for breakfast a few days ago and they were a big hit with my family! They have a great pumpkin flavor and totally reminds us of the holiday season. My only complaints are:
1) They were a little dense and moist rather than light and fluffy-probably my fault as I think I may have used too much pumpkin.
2) They had a little too much of a baking powder/soda taste-I will try using less next time.
I will make these again-they are overall a great pancake!

The basic recipe is great. I would not have thought of using vinegar, which I always use in pie crust.  I added pumpkin pie spice and twice as much cinnamon, added pecans to one-half batch and chocolate chips to the other.  Good enough to bring to our neighbors house.

This recipe calls for more ingredients than many pancake recipes I have made in the past but it is worth the extra work. They came out rather thick so I would add more liquid if you want to thin them out a bit. I also added some chocolate chips and caramel tim tams for a fun fall  dinner for the kids.

Thick and hearty. The only thing I changed was using coconut oil in place of veggie oil.  I used electric skillet on 300 degrees and topped my pumpkin pancakes with butter, syrup, crumbled pecans and a little more cinnamon. Fabulous, and I don't think I will be hungry again till dinner time.

Yummy. Doubled and just used whole can. Halved allspice due to taste preference.

Made this as written BUT it totally stuck to my electric skillet and made me use a lot of bad words. Switched to my good frying pan and they turned out great. Wonderful pancakes. Added some chocolate chips to a few. I also ordered a new electric skillet. Thank you for the recipe.

Nutmeg instead of allspice covered with 1 cup confec. 1 tsp vanilla and enough milk to thin a bit.  Makes a lot.  Try halving pancake recipe.

Absolutely perfect with no changes necessary.  I cooked on griddle pan at 350 until brown and dry.  Also, I only used the listed amount of cinnamon as I did not have allspice and the subtle spice level was perfect for our palate. I also used skim organic milk and it tasted delicious.  Thanks!

This was my first Christmas Brunch, usually I cook a big dinner but this Christmas time constraints made me have to change my plans.  I search for Christmas breakfast ideas and found this recipe. I loved it and so did my family. Most everyone were very skeptical about my choice. Christmas morning it was a huge surprise when they ate it they are still talking about it!

Delicious, easy, fast and scales well if just for the two of us (needs a little more liquid when scaled down). Thanks for the recipe!

Way too thick.  I added water and still had a hard time getting the middle to cook.  I made another recipe for these that called for buttermilk, that was much better.

I absolutely loved these!! I halved the recipe and did a teaspoon and a half of pumpkin pie spice instead of all the separate ones. I did use the full egg and I had to add more milk to get the right consistency.  They turned out so fluffy and perfect. Yummmmmmm

Me and my girls loved these pancakes! I served up the first batch with a little dollop of Cool Whip on top to make them more festive for the kids. My 4 year old ate 4 of them! I used the variation that RobnMandy posted and after the first batch were a little too thick for me, I added another half cup of milk. They didn't brown as well, not sure if it was the griddle or the extra milk, but they were still very tasty. Definitely do not toss the leftovers! They were good later, too!

A great base recipe that definitely needs a few tweeks. I added 1 tsp of vanilla. Other that that, made as directed. I liked them but the Mr wasn't impressed. There was a need for more sugar and spices as the end result was a bit bland. Also, the pumpkin flavor was faint so I'll increase that by 1/2 c next time.

This is the best pumpkin recipe ever!  The only change I made to the recipe was that I added more brown sugar-about 3 tbs more-because, well, I like things sweet.  My family agreed it was the best.

I am giving these pancakes 5 stars because my son LOVES!!! these pancakes.  He wants to eat them everyday!  I on the other hand have such a hard time making them, it's crazy! I make them every weekend and a few times I had to throw out a whole batch a few burned a few were raw in the middle I tried so many different ways of cooking them. I have a griddle in the middle of my stove and I used oil and they burned and stuck to the griddle. I tried butter and lowered the flame and they were raw.  I tried a cast iron skillet same problem.  Finally I tried butter and cooking spray and this seems to work the best.  The pancakes do not rise as high as I would like but who cares about me as long as my son loves them then I am giving them a 5!!!

They were everything I had hoped for.  We served with walnuts that were sauteed in a pan with a bit of butter and brown sugar, which was a great addition.  When making the pancakes once you pour the batter onto the skillet spread it out some with the back of a spoon.  This helps thin the pancakes and keeps them from being undercooked and mushy in the middle.

Tried this recipe this morning before work. Used canned pumpkin which was about one and a half cups so I adjusted everything else 1.5 times. I guessed at the 1.5 eggs. Used half wheat and half white flour. Also used apple cider vinegar instead of white just because it was closer and I was in a hurry. Also dumped everything into one bowl and mixed. Left my husband to add extra milk to thin the batter as he saw fit. Consistency of the final product was just fine. Next time I will add more spice or pumpkin pie spice as I like a little more zip in my pumpkin pancakes. Topped with real maple syrup. DELICIOUS!

Made these for the kids this morning. Light and fluffy! But I used 1 cup whole grain spelt flour in place of one cup of white flour (milder and lighter than whole wheat flour), and added 2t white sugar in addition to the brown sugar (to make it palatable for the kids), omitted the ginger and allspice (too strong for the kids), and put in 1t pumpkin pie spice. Super fast and easy, and with common ingredients. Nice fall breakfast!

Tried MrCook's recipe for pumpkin pancakes, there is way too much spice in it.  While the consistency was great, it was just too much.  I would recommend this recipe, halve mrcook to make it great.

Very easy to prepare, I used canned pumpkin and increased it by 1/3 of a cup.  Didn't have allspice so I added nutmeg.  The only issue was that my pancakes stuck to the pan which never has really happened before.  I oiled the pan adequately.  Also I added a little extra milk because the batter did look quite thick. However, the pancakes were delicious with good flavor, my family really liked them!

Substituted buttermilk for the milk.  Made a cream cheese glaze.  Outstanding.  

Oh, and by the way, I used Trader Joe's organic canned pumpkin.  Uh, canned pumpkin IS real pumpkin.  Frankly I find cooking sugar pumpkin a pain in the butt and don't taste any appreciable difference that would make it worth the extra effort.

Changes were: Used 1 C. whole wheat pastry flour, 1 C. reg. flour, 2 T. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and around 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, and 1 1/2 C. pumpkin, 1/3 C. ch. pecans.  Didn't add allspice, vinegar or ginger.  Did 3 T. brown sugar, 2 t. baking powder, 1 tps. baking soda.  Added 2 eggs and 2 T. oil Put spoon of batter in pan and spread it out w/spoon.  They were light & fluffy. Recipe amt. is huge, could definitely cut in 1/2 for 2 of us.

I modified this by substituting 1/3 whole wheat flour and adding ginger, toasted pecans, and ground flaxseed. The pecans sort of lost their texture--walnuts might hold up better. Other users urge not adding more milk, but as made, I had trouble getting these to cook all the way through--the batter is dense and does not flow, so these thick pancakes were sometimes still gooey in the middle. Keep them small and distribute the batter with a spoon to flatten slightly. Very tasty and filling, though, and my husband LOVED them.

I also used Aunt Jemima pancake mix like one reviewer did and it turned out great! Whole family loved it! I'd probably add more of the spices for more flavor but my four young kids and husband all loved it! It made just enough pancakes for us.

Kids LOVED it!  I followed the exact directions and it turned out very well.  I mixed the wet ingredients first in my Vitamix and then mixed in the dry.  Blended on high till smooth, poured, cooked and enjoyed.  Will most definitely make again.

It was delicious. I added a little white sugar and vanilla to sweeten the cakes, and I added toasted pecans.  My hubby loved these. (Try using pumpkin spice creamer in the mix too, it is really a good flavor.)

sooo good! Used the additional pumpkin (about 1/3 c more)as well.  Make sure to really oil your griddle well as the first few I made stuck to the non stick griddle I was using so with the next few I used vegetable cooking oil instead of just a light spray with the cooking spray oil

This recipe is delicious just the way it is. I sprinkled mini chocolate chips on the pancakes for the kids who like that while they were cooking. They are very light in flavor but the texture is amazing!

So... early fall day and it was time for pumpkin pancakes.  I got the following response... "These are the BEST pancakes you have ever made."  from two teenage step-kids and a husband.  HIGH praise.  Changes I made are as follows.  I used Pumpkin Pie Filling which has all the spices all ready, increased the pumpkin quantity to 1 1/3 cups and then added some extra nutmeg and cinnamon.  They really were great, light, fluffy, and excellent flavor.  Enjoy them!

I was scared reading the recipe, as it calls for vinegar.  I decided to make it as directed due to the high rating it received.  I liked them!  I couldn't taste the vinegar at all!  I used spelt flour in place of all purpose flour.  That is the only substitution I made.  I will make them again.

These were the best. The pancakes were a little thick so they were still gooey inside when I made them, but that is how I like them so I'm very pleased! Lovely pumpkin flavor.

I can't believe how many of these my daughters ate!  So good and good for you!  I changed the serving size to 10 to use a whole can of pumpkin.  Despite what the numbers on the recipe were after doing that, I used a whole can of puree and two eggs.  Turned out great.  I used one can of evaporated milk and a cup of 2% milk.  Also, using the adjusted measurements for 10 servings, I used 2/3 cup whole wheat flour and the rest regular flour with no problems.

Super moist (not gooey) and delicious! Also filling--I only needed one. You can definitely taste the pumpkin, and it was perfect on a Saturday morning with hot coffee. I am a vegan so used my usual substitutes-- 2 TB flax meal instead of one egg, and organic soy milk instead of cow's milk. Also didn't have all purpose flour so used whole wheat. Word of advice: the batter is super thick (may want to add milk as needed) and when on the pan it's thick enough that it may not bubble through, so routinely check on the underside so it doesn't burn.

These had a great pumpkin flavor.  I doubled the pumpkin, cinnamon, and ginger and added 1 cup milk.  I got 16 very large pancakes.  They were not very runny even with the extra milk.

These are delicious pancakes and they even tasted better the longer they sat because the flavors melded and that's not typical with pancakes.  I substituted buttermilk for the milk and vinegar and it worked out fine.  Delicious pancakes that I will make again.

We had breakfast for dinner today to mix things up...as I was craving pumpkin pancakes for the past few days and saw this recipe this morning and went out to buy all the ingredients.  I could wait until breakfast the next morning to make these.  By the way, I practice the alkaline diet, but really wanted pancakes since it is fall and I have a hard time getting my toddlers to eat veggies.  So this is a great way to hide the veggies in the pancakes.  So I did quite a bit of substituting and my rating is based on the substitute version and I always use organic everything.  I replaced buttermilk for the milk, I cooked a pumpkin to make my own pumpkin puree, used homemade apple sauce for the oil, apple cider vinegar for the vinegar, whole wheat flour for the flour (next time I'll try 1 cup wheat flour and 1 cup of ground oats), added one extra tbl of brown sugar (next time I'll use coconut sugar, it is the healthy version of sugar), replaced the ginger with pumpkin pie spice, and replaced vanilla extract for the allspice, next time I'll add 1 tbl of fresh lemon juice.  This recipe can hide 2 veggie and 1 fruit serving in the pancakes for the kids! hehe

Subbed 1/2 and 1/2 for the milk, used 1 1/3 cup fresh, cooked pumpkin, used 2 eggs and subbed pumpkin pie spice for the other spices.  Used the blender to mix the wet ingredients before combining with the dry.  These were good - not a very strong pumpkin taste.  I'll have to work with this recipe a bit.

Easy and delicious (even got two thumbs up from my kids). Only change I would make is to increase cinnamon and add nutmeg for a bit more spice.

I haved made this recipe several times with slight variations. I use Peanut butter instead of oil and add a little more flour and an extra egg or egg beaters to beef it up. I also love chocolate chip pancakes and will add chips and maybe nuts & raisins to make them extra hearty!

I'm about to make these pancakes again even though I had them several times last week. Make a batch and then freeze servings. They smell great even before being warmed up. I adapted this recipe by using whole grain flours and sweet potatoes. See my version at seesavesavor.com.

I made this recipe exactly as is-- turned out excellent.  Took advice from another review and did not add anything to thin, but just spread my pancake out onto griddle with a spatula.  They take a bit longer to cook than regular pancakes but they are very  filling, and a nice treat from the everyday pancakes.  My son loves anything pumpkin, and these were no exception

Made these for Christmas morning breakfast. Loved them! My husband ate them, but isn't a big pumpkin or pancake lover. Tried them with a pumpkin syrup, which was O.K. I liked them better topped with applesauce and vanilla yogurt. Would be good with baked apples and whipped cream too.

This is yummy! I used 1/2 C Whole Wheat Flour & 1/2 C Bob's 10-Grain Cereal in addition to the regular flour. I also added dashes of clove & nutmeg. Fantastic with butter & maple syrup!

These pancakes were delicious! As suggested by another user, I put all the wet ingredients, along with the brown sugar and the spices, in my blender and I blended it all up until it was smooth. I then whisked it into the dry until it was well blended. The batter is a little thick, but if you scoop them out with 1/4 cup and spread the batter around a bit, they turn out so good. I also added another tablespoon of brown sugar and a bit more cinnamon, but those were the only changes I made. It's almost like eating pumpkin bread in pancake form. Would also be good with semi-sweet mini chocolate chips in them. Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper.

I followed the recipe precisely, and these were delicious.  You have to spread the batter out a bit, unlike regular pancakes.  So good!  They also make great waffles.

Made exactly as written, and these were excellent! :) The only thing is that I think medium high heat was a bit too hot. I cooked mine closer to medium-low. Also, I used apple-cider vinegar (though I'm sure white vinegar would have been fine as well). I will definitely be making these again!

The recipe as is, is just okay. I followed all directions and found it was not sweet or "pumpkin" enough. I added a half tablespoon of nutmeg, about another 1/4 cup of pumpkin puree and about 1/3 cup of brown sugar and found it was more to my liking. Some of the reviews said the pancakes were too thick and doughy. I used a 1/4 cup scoop to measure the pancakes, flattening them out as I poured and I made 19 pancakes. I'm sure if I would've scraped the bowl real good, I could have made 20, but I was tired. I used honey butter and mmm, mmm, mmm, that was the kicker!

The recipe is good with the following modifications:

Use 1 C whole wheat pastry flour and 1 C flour. Add 1t cinnamon, increase the ground ginger slightly and andd 1t vanilla extract. Use 1 1/3 C pumpkin puree. Mix the vinegar and milk together to sour the milk. Replace 1 T of the vegetable oil with 3 T ground flax seed. Add a dash of ground cloves. Add 1t molasses. Add some extra milk as needed to thin the batter out. When the batter is ladled into the pan, you need to push it down slightly with the bottom of the ladle to spread it out since the batter is thick. It is best to cook the pancake on a cast iron pan.

I make these for my grandkids who absolutely love them!! The first time I made them, I followed the recipe and we thought they were wonderful. I wanted to make them more healthy so I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose flour and I use rice milk instead of milk (milk allergy). I also froze fresh pumpkin so I use that instead of canned. The texture is a little different but they taste great. The kids (ages 1 and 3) adore them with a little applesauce on the top. I usually make a double batch and then freeze them, they warm up nicely in the microwave.

These pancakes are moist yet light and full of pumpkin flavor without being overpowered by the spices. Finally, I have an autumn worthy Pumpkin Pancake recipe! Thanks, Ruth!

My kids love this recipe. I have made it several times. The only changes I made was to add another egg to yield a fluffier pancake and I added more cinnamon, just because my kids love it.

I took this as a starting point, but changed it a bit with awesome results.  Mixed 2 cups flour, 1.5 tsp baking soda, 1.5 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt.  In a separate bowl, mashed with fork 1.5 cups freshly baked pumpkin (baked at 375F x 1 hr, cooled).  Added 1 egg, mashed, added about 1 Tbs coconut oil, mashed.  Half cup at a time, added 1.5 cups whey from home-made ricotta (so easy! - look it up).  Mixed well (beat with fork).  Added to dry stuff and mixed with wisk.  This came out way thick for pancakes, so I added probably another cup of whey.  Fried on low-medium 4 at a time 3-4 " pancakes.  Kids ate 'til they could eat no more. Yum! Thanks for the inspiration!

I used this recipe with Carole's Sorghum blend to make it gluten free.  Added 2tsp vanilla and 1/4 milk.  They were delicious!

I love all things pumpkin but this is not what I was expecting from a highly rated pumpkin recipe.  They were just okay for me, I might have to mess with the recipe a little to my liking.

I loved this recipe!!!!!! I have never made pumpkin pancakes before, and was so excited to make this recipe; was not disappointed! The only tiny changes I made were: I used my homemade pumpkin purÃ©e, I omitted the spices, then just added 1 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice (I used the recipe on this website). DELICIOUS!!! I also sprinkled on a few chocolate chips as I cooked them, those were delicious also. Will definitely be making this again. The spice blend I used was perfect, not too strong!

I've made this recipe twice now-so easy and I have all of the ingredients on hand! (I keep portions of pumpkin in the freezer and just thaw out in the microwave). These are great. I'm still toying with how to make it less dense, though maybe that's just pumpkin pancakes? I've added pecans or chocolate chips to the batches I've made-delicious!

These are good, but the batter itself is very thick and difficult to scoop onto a griddle.

I wanted to duplicate Denny's pumpkin pancakes. I loved them and thought that they would be easy to make.  This recipe does exactly that.  I love nuts, so I added chopped walnuts.  Mmmmmm! Good!  Thank you, Ruth!

This was my first time making pumpkin pancakes and this recipe did not disappoint! They were filling but fluffy with just a slight pumpkin flavor. I followed the recipe to a T except I used vanilla almond milk as I was out of regular milk. I also followed the advice of another reviewer...measure the batter with a 1/4 measuring cup and spread it out in the pan a little so the pancakes stay light and fluffy. I think next time I might add more spices and/or more pumpkin for a stronger pumpkin flavor.

Fantastic!!  Love these!!  Have made them twice for my family....tweaked the recipe just a little; I use the whole 15oz can of pumpkin, and I use pumpkin pie spice + some extra cinnamon (we love cinnamon) 2 eggs and I throw in a half cup of instant oats. (Everything else the same)  With maple syrup on top it is heaven!

These were simply wonderful! I did make changes, cobbled together from several reviews. I used 1 c whole wheat flour, 1 c oats, 3 T brown sugar (we like them a little bit sweeter), 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp. baking soda, 1 T cinnamon, 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp salt. In a separate bowl, I gently beat the egg, added 1-1/2 c almond milk (we are allergic to cow's milk) and 1-1/3 cup pumpkin, slowly poured in 2 T melted butter, then added it all to the dry ingredients. The batter is VERY thick. I scooped it into the plan and flattened it with a wooden spoon. After flipping, flattened again. Note they take a long time to cook, I don't think they weren't done, I think maybe it was the moistness from the pumpkin, but we like them cooked so they weren't moist (felt undone) in the middle. If you want a thinner pancake, be sure to scoop a scant 1/4 batter so you can flatten them well. I learned if you scoop too much, they just won't flatten and you have a more puffy cake like pancake, which is not a bad thing. We just prefer them thinner. Also, this variation is not at all like a traditional pumpkin pancake, but if you are looking for a way to add whole grain deliciousness to a pumpkin pancake,this is the way to go. The oats give it a great texture...my teenaged son takes these to school in a baggie to eat cold at break or between classes.

These are delicious! I didn't have allspice on hand, so I just left it out and put in one teaspoon of nutmeg...I just love cinnamon and nutmeg combined. Will definitely be making these again. I modify the temperature, however. I put the oil on medium heat and turn it down as low as possible after the oil gets hot. Give the pan a few minutes to cool back down before you put the batter in. The cakes are ready to flip when there are air bubbles all over. The first pancake of any batch will ALWAYS turn out a little funky.

Well worth the high rating. I made waffles with the batter per my toddlers request. Only change was using 2 eggs instead of 1 per previous posters. I used Wearing pro Belgian waffle maker on level 3-setting.  My toddler and I both loved the waffles and we ate them plain without syrup or sugar ...etc.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable too, because I prefer that for baking. These turned out perfect, great texture and pumpkin flavor.

Tasted better made with turbinado sugar instead of brown. I even made some gluten free by just substituting the flour for all purpose gluten free baking mix.

Delicious!!  This has become a family favorite!  My husband is not a huge fan of pancakes but loved these!  I passed it on to my mom and they all love it, too!  I did not put in the oil or vinegar and added an additional 1/2 cup of milk to make up the difference.  I will eat these year round :)

As written, they were great, but  add 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1 teaspoon ground cloves they,  are even better. I do use 2 eggs. Batter is thick, spread out slightly using a spoon. Cook slow and low. Great job RUTH

I added an extra 1/3 cup pumpkin purÃ©e per another members suggestion (for more pumpkin flavor) and I did not like the results very much. The batter is heavy and the pancakes don't really rise with the added 1/3 cup of purÃ©e and you get some dense raw looking pancakes that I feel did not cook very well regardless of cooking time. It tasted like I was eating heated pumpkin purÃ©e.  I will try these tomorrow with extra flour and more rising agents and maybe an extra egg and see what I get.

Had to add more milk because the first batch was too foamy and wouldn't cook through. I also doubled the cinnamon because I didn't have allspice. They were very good with the changes.

This recipe is fantastic!  I took the advice of others and used 2 eggs and a tablespoon of cinnamon.  I also cooked them in my electric skillet at around 375 with a tiny bit of butter.  This was a wonderful way to get rid of some extra pumpkin I had in the fridge.  Will certainly make again!!!

OMG!!!!  Absolutely amazing!!!  Best pancakes I ever made.  I only did one tweak, by changing only one cup of the all purpose flour for whole wheat flour.  I always do that for my family's fibre intake.  Kudos to Ruth!  I used canned pumpkin purÃ©e.  This will be my new pancake recipe, and if I can figure it out, make them into crepes and stuff with prosciutto, cheddar cheese and asparagus.  Probably try them for Christmas morning breakfast for the family.

The batter was a little thick, so I upped the milk about 2 tablespoons and it worked beautifully.

I used almond milk instead of regular milk and they were perfect. Just a dash of lemon juice in addition to the vinegar   They are moist, fluffy and not too sweet.  Yum

The only thing I changed was using pumpkin pie spice because I didn't have any allspice.  These were fabulous!  I can't wait to make them again.  I made them with cinnamon honey butter and cheater pancake syrup, both from this site.

Wonderful flavor. Light and fluffy.  I substituted 1 cup of oatmeal for 1 cup of flour to gain more fiber.  I was skeptical about adding vinegar, but you can't taste it.  Great recipe.

As is, these were pretty bland but good.  I did read other reviews and this is what I changed to "better" them.  I used 1 c evaporated milk & 1 c 2% milk. 1 1/4 c Pure Pumkin. Then I added 2 Tablespoons Pumpkin Pie Spice and 1/3 c Brown Sugar.  Kept the rest the same.

Was so good. I was a little wary at first, but one bite was enough to make me fall in love with this recipe. I had a hard time finding out exact measurements for the changes people suggested. So here's what i changed based on what i read. I omitted the vinegar. Used 2 cups of milk, 2 eggs, 3/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and next time I would do even more. They were very fluffy and thick. Tasted delicious even with nothing on it.

As is, I'd give this recipe four stars. Our first batch wasn't sweet enough for our taste and didn't have much cinnamon or allspice flavor. The texture was great though. We tweaked the recipe the next time by increasing the cinnamon, brown sugar, and allspice considerably. I also added nutmeg and ground cloves, along with some Mexican vanilla and pecans. With those changes, I'd give it five stars. I love the added crunch of the nuts. We topped ours with the Cinnamon Cream Syrup from this site and also the cream cheese topping from the French Apple Pie with Cream Cheese Topping recipe. Both were amazing. This recipe is nice because you can change it to suit your own taste, and ours run a little more decadent. We'll make this again.

I like trying new pancake recipes and this one is very very good! Will definitely make it again and again through the season. I followed the directions and it turned out great, no need to add more milk or more spices. I baked pumpkin and pureed it with blender few days in advance - easy and all natural :) I am sure you can use buttermilk instead of milk+vinegar, usually this is what I use for pancakes, but using milk+vinegar is more convenient, since we always have it at home :)

Very good, fluffy pancakes.  One comment calls for upping cinnamon to 3Tbs -- that's WAY too much!  Makes the final very dry (picture trying to swallow a spoonful of cinn!).  Original recipe calls for 1 tsp, maybe increase to 1 1/2 tsp.  A good addition is a touch of nutmeg (maybe 1/2 - 1 tsp), and increasing the amount of pumpkin to around 1 1/2 cups (particularly if using fresh pumpkin, like I did).  Finally, I found the pancakes themselves could be a little sweeter, and added 1 Tbs of white sugar (might depend on how sweet your pumpkin is).  One batch feeds our family of four nicely.

You don't need any syrup! It's great and even better if you have pumpkin puree from a real pumpkin and not canned. All of my kids think they're wonderful. If you want plain soy milk works well too.

These were good. I had to add a little water to them, so they weren't so thick. A touch of honey and a tad more cinnamon would have made these extra special. For the vinegar I used white distilled as it didn't specify which type and only used 1 tablespoon.

Nothing too special to me. I would use the idea for adding pumpkin puree to pancakes in the future to get the extra nutrition, but overall the flavor was bland.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  They are very good plain too, tasting like a light pumpkin muffin.  Will definitely add this to my recipe collection.

Made this for the kids.  They whined at the concept but loved the meal!  Did not change anything.  I also made a second batch, substituting King Arthur Gluten Free Flour blend for the AP flour - and it turned out very well with no adjusting at all.  The gluten free person said that they were the fluffiest GF pancakes she had ever had!

These tasted great but I think I must have measured something wrong because my batter was really thin not so thick like so many reviews mentioned.  I thickened it up a bit and they were delicious.  We got way more than 12 cakes but I think that is due to whatever mess up I made.  I want to try again for sure because the taste was great!

I followed this recipe exactly and my wife and two kids (boys 2 and 4) loved it. I'm be honest, I was a little worried when I saw vinegar as one of the ingredients but did as I was told and was rewarded 

"These are the best pancakes ever" said my 4-year-old
"The pumpkin taste is not overpowering at all" said my wife
"Me more tan - ake" said the 2-year-old

this recipe is amazing. it is not too sweet or too dense. i used 1/2 wheat flour, almond milk, and fresh pumpkin. the fresh pumpkin gave it a less dense and lese overwhelming pumpkin taste. served with real maple syrup, these are a new go-to recipe!

yuuuuuummmmm!!!!!!!!!!! Just made these and they are amazing!
Took a few reviewers advice: added extra egg (sooo glad I did), added 1 1/2 teas vanilla, increased cinnamon to 2 teas, added in some dashes of ground cloves and nutmeg with other seasonings, followed rest as is. I let the batter stand for about 5 minutes before starting and let the griddle get really hot. Last time I made pumpkin cakes the batter was so thick so I was skeptically about a whole cup of pumpkin but I did it anyway and it was perfect....just dallop a bit on griddle and smooth out with spoon.
Seriously soo perfect !!!

Yum! I didn't have allspice- I used a couple shakes of nutmeg instead.  I would only make a half-batch next time, or make for 4 people.  We had 6 pancakes left over, and we agreed that 2 would have been plenty each.  They were big and fluffy and rich-tasting.  Served with whipped cream cheese topping, maple syrup and chopped pecans sprinkled on top.  Would be a delicious dessert-type as well.

These pancakes were excellent.  I used evaporated milk because I didn't have any regular whole milk on hand and I added *candied pecans to the batter to kick them up a notch.  Yum!

*toast chopped pecans in a dry skillet, remove from heat and stir in a couple teaspoons of real maple syrup

This recipe is KILLER!!! Sooo good, we were in Saturday morning heaven.  I had leftover egg nog from thanksgiving and used that to top up the milk, really made them rich and tasty.  The recipe, even when halved, was huge for two people.  We were quite happy to enjoy the leftovers on Sunday, re-heated nicely in the microwave.

Enjoy :)

Must try recipe.  I made few adjustments which made it a 10 star rating. Add one well ripped mashed banana, 1/4 tsp. cloves, & 1/4 tsp. fresh nutmeg. Let batter rest for 10 minutes and don't add any milk.  I also added chocolate chips and here is the trick. After you pour the batter, immediately sprinkle the chips and then softly push them in till they are no longer visible.  This way, they don't burn when you flip them over. Enjoy !! your family will love them.

This came out without any regrets.  In the past I have had trouble with the consistency of the finished product with adding the vinegar and the puree.  There was no vinegar taste which is very good.  I did use pancake mix instead of flour.  The spices have a good ratio.  Thanks for my first other than pie pumpkin recipe.

Loved the taste, and the thick batter made lovely fluffy, tall pancakes, but I guess I was too hungry to cook these, I would recommend lower heat for a longer time than you cook normal pancakes, mine were a bit gooey in the middle.

I'm always trying to get my kids to eat more veggies and these pumpkin pancakes were by far the best I've ever made.  I used Maple Grove's whole wheat pancake mix (2.5 cups) and added the spices, oil, egg, sugar, milk and vinegar.  They came out moist and fluffy, not dry.  I also added a few chocolate chips to make a pumpkin face.  They loved them and leftovers make great snacks, heated up or cold.

Made it as is, just used apple cider vinegar in lieu of regular (I had no white vinegar). Turns out amazing every time! I add pecans as jack-o-lantern faces for some extra flavor, and a fun treat for the kids! I'm sure you could use raisins for families who can't have nuts.

These were great. I just realized that I didn't put in the oil or the vinegar but mine still turned out great... maybe because I used sour milk the vinegar wasn't necessary. I put in an extra 1/2 tsp of ginger and half the allspice because I prefer the ginger flavor and it was an awesome combo. The family said that these were definitely worth making again!

Made the recipe exactly as stated, except I subbed out 3 tsps of pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed.  Same thing, I was just feeling a little lazy.  They were very fluffy and moist.  Will be making them again this fall!  Thanks!

I made this for my family and everyone loved it.  We all loved it so much, I made more to put in the freezer so my kids have a quick breakfast they love before school, or a snack for after school.  I did make some modifications.  I don't like ginger so I took that out, and added nutmeg instead.  I also used bisquick to make it faster.  I still used the egg, oil, and milk.  This recipe is awesome!!

We used Wheat Flour in place of the all-purpose flour and they were delicious!

Agree with letting vinegar and milk stand as well as adding extra pumpkin and cinnamon.  For ease, used a 15 oz. can of Libby Pumpkin Pack.  Also added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.

I made two adjustments on measurements and one procedural change. Pumpkin puree was increased to 1 1/2 cups. Cinnamon increased to 1 1/2 teaspoons. Vinegar only makes sense to me b/c I assume it's used w/ the milk to substitute for buttermilk. So I poured the vinegar into the milk and let it sit while I combined the dry ingredients and got the rest of the wet ingredients ready. Giving the milk and vinegar a few minutes is standard procedure. I liked the results very much and definitely will make again, keeping my changes.

These were delicious and turned out perfectly! The second time I made them, I used oat flour for half of the flour, and added an extra half cup of almond flour (for protein) and they still turned out delicious. We love them!

What a great way to use up my extra fresh pumpkin puree!  These are delicious.  There's only two of us in my household, so it made too many pancakes, but I simply put them on a plate in the fridge, and we ate them for breakfast for the next several days by reheating in the microwave.  They were even better the next day when reheated!

I love pancakes AND pumpkin, so this seemed like the perfect match! The only things I did differently was add a bit of vanilla and a little more cinnamon since I didn't have any allspice.  These were absolutely tasty! This recipe is definately a keeper!

I was trying to find something to make for breakfast knowing we had very little food left in the house. I didn't have any regular white sugar, so I thought all hope was lost. However, I reluctantly looked up this recipe and saw that I had everything listed to make these pancakes!  They turned out VERY good!! the kids inhaled them w/o any syrup or honey on top. Definitely a keeper recipe!!!

This recipe was amazing!  My husband and I are health nuts so I changed the milk to almond milk, white flour with 2 1/2 cups Spelt flour, used rapadura sugar instead of brown, and added 1/8 tsp ground cloves and a pinch of nutmeg, used sea salt instead of table salt, and substituted the vegetable oil with sunflower.  AMAZING!!!!  We will be making these regularly!

I really liked them.  Sadly, my kids wanted their "regular" pancakes instead.
I used two eggs and left out the vegetable oil.  I also cut back the allspice to 1/2 tsp because I think it can overwhelm the cinnamon.

VERY GOOD!  Good pumpkin taste, not overly sweet.  I used white sugar instead of brown because it was what I had on hand.  Still tasted fantastic.  Also added a dash of nutmeg and some ground flax seed to make it a lttle healthier.  Will definitely make this again!

These pancakes were a great hit at home! They were perfectly moist and well-flavored. Instead of canned pumpkin puree we used pumpkin puree that we roasted and pureed ourselves.

Great anytime! I added 1 tablespoon white sugar, 1/4 teaspoon clove, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I make a huge batch and then eat them for breakfast all week.

I made these on Christmas morning with my family. My picky, foodie family. Everyone took one, and, as I chewed nervously, they started RAVING about them. My dad (MY DAD!) went back for seconds. I couldn't believe it. They past the pickiest family test. Here are a couplet things I noted that could make them even better:
1. Make SURE to serve with warm, real (none of the fake stuff) maple syrup. I also put warmed frozen blueberries with them and I thought that was fabulous.

2. I think I made mine too thick, wanting big, beefy pancakes, but they were too dense. I'll easily fix this next time by flattening them out on the pan a little more.

3. I used half apple sauce and half oil to cut down on the fat and it seemed OK. Next time for comparison I'm going to try 2T butter.

4. I'm glad I didn't use half ww flour and half all purpose. I think ww would have made them borderline tough. Just serve with fruit and you'll get fiber there ;) Don't sacrifice the taste/texture for a little fiber.

I made this for my family for Christmas breakfast.  It was very good, although thicker than we usually have.  I added a bit more milk to thin it out and added a few more spices to make up for it.  I didn't have allspice so I added some ground mace and nutmeg, and used half whole wheat flour to make it more filling.  Very special treat with whipped cream and syrup.

Thanks for this concise recipe; the result was delicious! I scaled this up to 48, because I serve that many people every morning, and the proportions were spot on.  Great sweet/savory/spice balance.  I am going to try substituting plain yogurt for some of the milk next time.  Thanks again!

Prefer these over regular pancakes.They were delicious!!!  Both my children loved them too and get very excited when I say I'm going to make them. I used 1 can of puree instead of 1 cup. Didn't want 1/3 jar to go to waste. After making this for a  couple years it seems to me that I need to double the milk. If I use what is in the recipe it's too thick and pancakes don't cook in the middle.

Too dense for me, and I could taste the vinegar. For that matter, I could SMELL the vinegar with each bite, which was a bit of a turn off. I also think it needs more spices. Finally, the recipe made more than I was expecting, which means I have a ton left over for freezing.

Taste was great, but the batter is way too thick when followed as is. Pancake batter is not supposed to look like bread dough. It needs to be able to spread in the pan.

Just great and there's all kinds of room to personalize it!  I did thin it with left over pumpkin juice from boiling pumpkin, used cooked field pumpkin instead of canned, used balsamic vinegar (that's all I had) and added pecans.

I made this when family was visiting. I used fresh pumpkin, not packed. They loved it so much that they took a copy of the recipe home with them. Downside, they were hard to cook through they were so thick and fluffy. I added 1/2 cup milk to compensate.

fantastic flavor!  good that they were not too sweet, because it balanced the maple syrup nicely.  very thick though, next time I'll try thinning them out with more milk, otherwise they can be a little gooey if you cook them too quickly/high heat (try lower heat, longer cooking time).  With my first batch, I put the cooked pancakes in the toaster oven to keep them warm until I was done making all of them, and it helped cook the insides a little longer.  We had leftover batter too, which was good the next day.  a keeper!!!

Great flavor. Some pumpkin recipes don't seem to have a spicy enough flavor for me but these do. Pretty thick dough.  I cooked mine and put them in the oven for a bit to get the dough totally cooked. Melted some butter with maple syrup with a pinch of cinnamon to pour over the top. Hubby loved them and I froze the rest. 
TIME SAVER: Just line up on wax paper, wrap three at a time, fold the ends up and several packets fit perfect in a gallon freezer bag. You can pull out 3 at a time and heat up for a quick morning breakfast. I do this with bacon (uncooked) also. Just pull a long strip of wax paper, lay out one strip, roll, lay out another, etc. I roll about 5-6 strips in a packet. Put in gallon freezer bag. I can just pull out 3-6 slices of bacon at a time already separated by wax paper. Prevents bacon from going bad in the fridge and the wax paper separates the frozen strips for easy cooking.

These took a while to cook so I made waffles with the leftover batter and they were even better! I tossed some dark choco chips on the top of the cooked waffle too and made it dessert for breakfast, YUM!

Have to give it 5 stars as the girls loved them.  Batter comes out thicker than most pancake batters, but cooks up fine.  Used Whole Wheat flour and added some spices.  

Bonus Tip: Add Cinnamon Chips!!!  Makes them awesome. Oh, and they freeze and reheat great!!!

These are absolutely delicious!  I find the batter a bit thick to work with and may try thinning it out a bit next time I make them, but they got rave reviews all around in my house!

These are very good.  I did have to add more milk though to get them to spread out more on the griddle because they were too thick and the first ones didn't get cooked through all the way. More milk helped with this.

Amazing...I'm trying to cook MORE healthy, so I changed out the white flour with 100% Whole Wheat flour...and I had NO allspice so used pumkin pie spice....and added one teaspoon or so of mixed pecan and walnuts chopped up on top of batter...I too added more vinagar and milk...We too found them hard to get done, but I wonder if the texter is just different with all the whole wheat flour...they were very fluffy, even with the WW flour...All I can say is they were amazing and I can't seem to think of anything else since I made them...MMM...they were a nice treat because we do no eat sweets anymore...Felt like we were cheating on our NO sweet diet..!!!  I wish everyone would try them!!!

Altered the recipe slightly to other suggestions but it wasn't such a drastic change that I still can't rate this high (blending wet ingredients technique and adding a little extra spice)! My kids who can sometimes be iffy about pumpkin (and I used the whole cup), loved these!

These were very tasty. I added mini-chocolate chips and they a great way to use left-over pumpkin. Instead of all the spices, I used 2.5 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Next time, I will add a whole tsp of salt instead of 1/2. My kids loved them.

Very yummy. The first couple didn't cook all the way through because the batter was so thick but I turned the heat down and the rest were great.

These pancakes are delicious!  I make very small pancakes using 1/2 of a cookie scoop.  I freeze them flat, then transfer to a gallon bag.  In the morning, I pop a few in the microwave for a few seconds and give them to my little guy for a very quick breakfast!  I added a handful of chocolate chips to some of them.  SO delicious!  No butter or syrup necessary!

Very yummy!  My kids wolfed them down.  FOr my alterations, I did apple cider vinegar and whole wheat pastry flour.  Great mix and made very filling pancakes. We also make smallish pancakes (like 5 inches) and we had more than 6 pancakes.  Just a note, these pancakes are very thick, so def listen to others about not thinning but just spreading around w spoon.

The batter was way too thick, even after I upped the milk to 2 cups. I had a hard time getting the insides to cook completely before the outsides burned so we had a few that were a bit raw. The taste was pretty good, had just enough sweetness.

Love pumpkin anything and these are wonderful. I'm not an experienced baker, so this was a stretch for me. the only complaint was they are awfully thick, but spreading them out with spoon/spatula worked well.

Outstanding!  Used buttermilk instead of mik, and 1/2 tsp baking soda. Moist, fluffy and delicious.  Best pumpkin pancake recipe I've used.

I had to change the recipe pretty drastically on this one. The "original recipe" yielded pancake mix that was extremely liquid in nature, and when cooked, they came out thin, wet, and limp. The only redeeming factor was the pumpkin-pie-like taste.

While the original recipe calls for about 2 cups of flour, I think I added about 3 cups per each 2 cups I original started with (I am cooking for a lot of people). I also multiplied the Baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and brown sugar by the power of three for every called for amount.

Once tampered with, the recipe yielded far thicker mix and resulted in a fluffy, not too moist-not too dry, delicious pancake that I can't wait to share with everyone tomorrow. 

This is a great recipe to toy with, especially since it's winter-time!

LOVE.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used pancake mix as a short cut, but only because I'd forgot that I had run out of flour!  But next time, I'll try it the long way.

Awesome. I was worried that this wouldn't have much pumpkin flavor since other recipes were supposed to be pumpkin and you could barely taste it. But, I am very happy with these. I followed exact directions. For the oil, I used olive oil.

The ONLY thing I changed was the cooking technique: I made them into waffles!  DELICIOUS.  The waffles are a bit more tender than normal, but oh-so-very wonderful.

These were the fluffiest pumpkin pancakes I have ever made - the flavor was fantastic - I didn't have allspice so substituted cardamom. Everyone from my 2-year old grandson to the "pancake hater" ate 2 or more per person! These are our families new fall favorite -a real keeper.

So good!  Followed the recipe exactly - made a double batch ate a few with my family and froze 23 of them for quick reheats for on the go mornings!

Update 2015 - To use a full 29oz can of Libby's pumpkin, adjust recipe to make 21 servings.... it calls for 5.5 eggs, I just used 6 and it was GREAT!!!!

These pancakes were more savory than I was expecting, next time I'll add at least 1/2 cup more brown sugar. They froze well and reheated easily in the toaster oven for a good school morning meal.

AMAZING pancakes and I am not usually a pancake lover!  The only thing I changed is I used fat free milk, left everything else the same and these are the best pancakes I have ever had.  They were not too pumpkin tasting, very hearty and filling.  I added mini chocolate chips to half the batch because I like to get in my chocolate but they were definitely great even without.

Absolutely lovely flavors! My super picky 6 year old daughter looked at them like they were spiders.... one bite and there wasn't a crumb left! I served this with whipped cream instead of syrup.

I followed the recipe with only a minor change.  I added 2 tsp. cinnamon instead of 1.  Also, I didn't have allspice, so I added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. cloves.  I also added about 1/4 cup milk, and these pancakes were still thick and fluffy.  They were a little too thick without the added milk.  These really were absolutely delicious!  I will make these again!

AMAZING!  This was my first time eating pumpkin pancakes.  They were delicious and filling.  I was a bit skeptical about vinegar in the batter, but it did not affect the taste (used white vinegar too).  My 13 month old son ate about 2 pancakes and loved them too! Will be making them again soon.

I'm not really sure where the complaints come from. Yes the batter is very thick, but cooking them on low (kept my griddle on 350) will allow them to cook through but not burn. In addition, pumpkin itself doesn't really have a lot of flavor, so you would need to add spices to it to taste. Pumpkin is bland just on its own. I added a ton of allspice and more nutmeg than called for, and these came out light and tender. I didn't find them to be dense and chewy at all. On the contrary, they melt in your mouth.

I'm not sure if it was because I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, but the batter was very thick, so I had to use more milk to make it easily scoopeable. However, even then the batter was more breadlike. I even used the remaining batter (and there was a TON of it) to bake this as a bread. The flavor is probably more suitable as a sliced bread than a pancake, in my opinion. I wouldn't say the recipe was yummy, but it certainly has that Fall quality.

Flavor was incredible!!!! I would let them sit on the skillet longer next time, a few were mushy in the middle.  Very filling, pairs great with Maple Syrup!

OMG, these were the BEST pancakes I have ever eaten!  I halved the receipe, used a generous half cup of FRESH pureed pumpkin, still used one whole egg, added 1/2 tsp of pumpkin spice, then added a smidge more flour to thicken slightly.  They were SO incredibly moist and SO delicious!  Husband loved them, too!

I used canned pumpkin pie mix instead of pureed pumpkin. It turned out great! I just halved the amount of spices I added since the mix has some spice already. They were perfectly seasoned and had a great texture. Loved them!

Awesome recipe!!!! I used a powder pancake mix as another person had recommended. I also used libbys pumpkin pie mix pureed canned pumpkin. It was an accident that i bought that instead of just plan old pureed pumpkin, but i would use it in this recipe again for sure!!!! It tasted like warm sweet pumpkin bread!

Don't get my 3 stars wrong - These pancakes tasted great! If taste was all that mattered, I would gladly give 5 stars. My complaint is that it's a 'heavy' pancake; very, very, dense and rich. I will make them again, but definitely when I am feeling the fall/winter bug, and I'm willing to compromise sanity for the hearty bounty of winter.

I love everything pumpkin, and these pancakes are very pumpkin-y. Yum! Mine weren't very fluffy, most likely because I used almond milk instead of regular. The family is asking for more, what other praise is needed?

Very good and easy to make. They are thick, so they tend to turn a little dark on atleast one side to get them to cook through, but that didn't bother us at all. I used pumpkin pie spice, 2 teaspoons, instead of the other spices - very tasty! Will make again!

This was interesting and I am sure that it fits many people tastes, but it was not for me. I will might make it again. It is more a matter of personal taste than anything else.

I made this recipe for a family brunch last Christmas and it was a huge hit!  I ended up making a second batch.  The only change that I made was using 1 TBSP of pumpkin pie spice in place of the other spices (because I was out of allspice).  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  These pancakes have become a family favorite and we make them at least 2 or 3 times a month.

My husband and I love this recipe!  I didn't have all spice, so I added nutmeg instead.  The second time I made these I doubled the spices to give it more flavor.  They turned out great!  The recipe makes such fluffy pancakes.  This recipe is definitley a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly but made it for 1 1/2 batches. I ended up with 17 delicious pancakes! I thought these were perfect in texture and flavor, but my husband thought they tasted like pumpkin pie too much. He said the flavor was good, but just not his favorite thing. So, 4 stars from us with our combined opinion.

Actually my husband is the one who made these, he is the pancake master in our house. He followed the recipe exactly, no changes - and it turned out amazing! Fluffy and light and absolutely great. We did use the fresh pumpkin I pureed (I baked the pie pumpkin on 350F until it was tender, scooped it out and mushed it util it had puree consistency) Absolutely worth trying!

Unfortunately we didn't have allspice so I decided to use the spice list in someones comments.  I think everything would have been good except it called for cloves and they were WAY too strong.  Overpowered the whole batch.  Next time I'll just leave them out.  We usually only do this once or twice a year, so hopefully I'll remember.

Wow!!  Made these for dinner tonight : )  and they were delicious!  Used buttermilk in place of the milk and vinegar.  Also added walnuts and left out allspice.  Added a scoop of fiber and whey protein! A new favorite pancake!

These are fantastic!  The batter was very thick and we ended using closer to 2 cups of milk instead of 1.5.  We made Homemade Butter from this site to serve with them and along with syrup, they were incredible!

Took some advice from the reviews, we did the following: used 2 eggs, 2 tsp cinnamon 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, omitted ginger and all spice, 2 tsp baking soda, and added 3 TBS of melted butter. We also used QUINOA flour for a healthier option!! These were amazing pancakes, not too sweet and the quinoa gave them a slightly nutty taste as well!! The batter is very thick for a pancake batter, we just ladled out about 1/4 cup onto the griddle and quickly spread it a bit with the back of the ladle to make them a bit thinner and they were perfect and cooked all the way through!

These were extremely good, and very well received by my family. I made the recipe as listed, other than adding an extra egg as suggested by someone else. I also took the suggestion to spread the batter around a bit with a spoon, as it's definitely a thick batter. Pouring the batter with a 1/4 cup measure and then spreading it with a spoon worked extremely well. They cooked up very nicely, and were nice and fluffy as well. We'll definitely be making this recipe again!

Tasty, but I'll reduce the allspice to 1/2tsp. next time. I followed the first reviewer's suggestions, using Bisquick. 1/2 the recipe should be plenty for my family of 4 next time.

Delicious, I also used the hot cider syrup from another pumpkin pancake recipe. I used apple cider vinegar instead of white, I ran out. These are very moist pancakes. I WILL make them again.

These were delicious!  The portions are very generous.  I cut the recipe down for 2 servings and it made 8 pancakes.  I mistakingly added a whole egg, but it worked out fine.  The pancakes were fluffy and very good.

Awesome pancakes! My hubby doesn't really care for anything pumpkin, but he really really enjoyed these. He doesn't eat breakfast much, but this, he went for more. Too bad I only had 1 cup of flour left, so I had to halve the recipe. I use homemade pumpkin puree and added more milk to the batter. Will definately make it again! Thanks for the great recipe;)

these were fabulous using the original recipe.  I didn't have any ground ginger so I used grated fresh ginger and added it to the wet ingredients.  I used triple the amount of the ground ginger.  They were fabulous.

Loved these!  Used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the separate spices just because that was what I had.  These were thick and just wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are so good,  but don't you over stir. They turn out just as terrific if you sub 1 cup of wheat flour for the white flour. I read great pancake tips, they say to beat the egg white until peaks form then fold into pancake mix, also to sub carbonated drink for the liquid, For SUPER fluffy pancakes. Im gonna try it next time.

One Sunday, at around brunch-tme, pumpkin pancakes sounded delicious. I staggered upon this recipe and gave it a go. Came out wonderfully moist....if that's the correct term! One thing I changed a tad bit was the amount of pumpkin. I love a strong pumpkin flavor.

Delicious! Add a bit more spice to the original recipe, spread them around the griddle so they cook evenly, and you will have the perfect fall breakfast (or dinner!)

These were absolutely awesome.  I added a dash of ground cloves and a little bit more milk.  The pancakes were gobbled up by the kids and my husband who doesn't even like pumpkin.  He said that it was fun to have something different.  They were so yummy that they really didn't need anything on them.

These may become one of my favorite pancakes!  I thought I'd give it a try with some whole wheat flour (I did 1/2c WW and the rest all-purpose) but I don't think I'll do that again because they turned out somewhat flatter and I'm guessing that may be why?  They also took a long time to cook through and even still seemed to be doughy and not completely cooked through, and I let them cook for quite some time.  Not sure what the deal was.  I also did not have allspice, so I decided to just use pumpkin pie spice since it's pretty much the same thing, and since I wanted to add more spice in general (per suggestions) I used 3t. pumpkin pie spice and then added 1/2t. cinnamon for my spices.  It had great flavor.  I added chocolate chips to half of the batch and those were also delicious!!  Definitely a keeper of a recipe!!  It made about 18 small-medium pancakes too.

This was wonderful~  Pancakes were dense and moist, almost like pumpkin bread more than pancakes!  My husband and three year old scarfed them down, and have been begging for me to make them again!  I used skim milk, no difference.  Served with REAL maple syrup was great too!

All I can say is Yummy!  I had to add a little more milk because the batter was a tad thick.  My whole family loved this recipe and it made the house smell like the holidays.  We made extra so the kids could heat them up in microwave before school.

The came out great! Instead of pumpkin, I microwaved a winter squash I had on hand (green with orange flesh- I don't even know what it was!) It kind of pureed itself and I added all of it (about 2 cups) to the batter. Instead of white flour, I used 1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 oatmeal. Came out great cooked into pumpkin shapes with homemade applesauce on top!

Yay!!  These are delicious!  I made these this morning and they were a hit with everyone!  My barely 2-year old ate 3 pancakes, and my super picky 6-year old loved them too.  I made half the batch as directed, then added chocolate chips to the second half of the batter for the kids.  Both were delicious.  These will ve in regular breakfast rotation this fall.  Simple/quick  enough to make on a school morning.

This recipe is excellent!!  Made it when we had a guest, and they were duly impressed! ;)  I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for pancake mix so this was perfect!  I did use freshly pureed pumpkin.  And I took the Nutmeg Whipped Cream recipe from "rucifey" to top it all off.  Boy was it good!  We roasted the pumpkin seeds the evening before and used the Sweet and Spicy Pumpkin Seeds recipe from "lotus petal."  Another hit!    Thanks for sharing this recipe!

FABULOUS!  I've never been able to make such light and fluffy pancakes before!  The pumpkin flavor was balanced and delicate, and the spices were perfect.    I did double the recipe, and BOY did it make a lot of pancakes lol!  Certainly enough to feed our family of seven plus a couple bonus kids!  I was impressed that the little ones loved them so much, even without syrup.  I will be adding this to our regular rotation.

My whole family LOVED these.  They are super moist and are seasoned perfectly.  I served them with fresh whipped cream, but for leftovers the kind in the can was great too.  I've also tried adding about a 1/2 cup of pumpkin and cinnamon to the regular bisquick pancake recipe and it was good but not as good as this!

Really enjoyed this one!  I used only 1 1/2 cups of white flour then added 1/2 cup of wheat germ.  Also added a total of 5 Tbsp on brown sugar and 1 Tbsp of vanilla.  After pouring the mix on the griddle, I sprinkled walnuts on top too.

excellent!  I was forced to make a slight substitution as i realized i didn't have any allspice, so i just subbed in more cinnamon and a little nutmeg.  next time i'll make sure i have allspice, though this was still excellent!

I originally made these as written but the batter was bland and too thick.  I ended up using the rest of the 15 oz can of pumpkin I opened, added a handful of brown sugar, and kept adding milk until I got the desired consistency.  After those changes these were pretty darn good.

These were great! I doubled the recipe and had a few leftover after serving 11 people (we ate the leftovers cold with strawberry jam later). We didn't have any maple syrup but they were amazing with raspberry syrup. Next time I will try with cinnamon butter. I used nutmeg instead of ginger and increased the amount of cinnamon a bit. I used the "spreading out" technique instead of adding milk and it worked out just fine. They tasted great, will make again!

These are FANTASTIC!!!  I have tried many different pumpkin pancake recipes and this one is PERFECT!  They are filling, and everyone raves about them, including my picky toddler!   I use whole wheat flour instead and they are wonderful, thank you SO MUCH Ruth for submitting this recipe!

These were good. I would have liked them a little better if the batter was sweeter, needed alot of syrup.

I used homemade pumpkin puree and added some nutmeg (I don't measure). These were fantastic, by far my favorite pancakes!

I thought these were great! I halved the recipe and it still made a lot so I froze most of them. I accidentally added too much brown sugar but they were still very good. Definitely will make again.

These pancakes were very dense and disappointing regarding flavor. The pumpkin did not shine as I had hoped. The trick to getting them cooked properly is not having the pan too hot and spreading out the batter a little. Mine cooked through but the end result tasted a bit doughy / wet. My boys liked them but everyone else wasn't as excited. I would love to find a similar recipe that is a little lighter in texture and maybe more pumpkin tasting.

Nice fluffy pancakes. Good flavor but would use the spices that are recommended in the recipe. This would give it a stronger spicey flavor. Will make again!

Pretty good... tastes like a flat pumpkin muffin. I healthed it up by using half whole wheat flour, egg whites & omitted the oil.

When it's fall, we leap into pumpkins and incorporate them into EVERYTHING, if possible! These are marvelous pancakes, but apparently can be done wrong as my second attempt proved- 3rd, 4th all the way through probably the 6th or 7th time, they were again fabulous- I think it was the brand of pumpkin (beware of Santiam).

The pancakes were good.  Not as great as the posts I had read though.  My kids wouldn't have anything to do with them.  I think it's because they are darker and don't look like regular pancakes.  I was really hoping this was going to be a keeper...somewhat dissappointed.

These are fabulous... made no changes.  Freeze great, kids love them!  They have a nice thickish texture which I prefer in a pancake.  Almost like eating flat pumpkin bread.

Excellent! My daughters kindergarten class made pumpkin pancakes in the fall and she loved them. I pureed and froze pumpkin in 1 cup baggies and make them for the kids. Always a hit and very tastey and fluffy!

These are lovely!  I made them with all whole wheat flour and I switched out fat free plain yogurt for the milk.  It definitely had more of the consistency of muffin mix, but I just smooshed them down with a spatula and they made lovely pancakes!  I ate them with bananas and honey on top...mmmmm!

I used whole wheat flour. Sucanat instead of white sugar. Didnt have allspice so I used pumpkin pie spice, along with the other spices. Whipped up some whip cream using heavy whipped cream, 2 tbsp of organic sugar, and 1 tsp of vanilla. Served it with syrup, whipped cream, and chopped up pecans. This was so GOOD! My kids have always loved pancakes, but this is such a better recipe, healthier, and tastier. My husband was impressed with my talanted cooking.

Delicious!  I halved the recipe for 2 people (probably could have just made 1/3) and used half of the ingredients.  However, based on some other comments, I used a little more of each of the spices (+ nutmeg) and used just over 3/4 C of pumpkin puree.  My first batch wasn't stirred (after sitting while I heated up the skillet) and was thicker to pour than batch 2, in which the batter was stirred.  As suggested, I used ~1/4 cup and flattened them out.  I used a large disher (#20) and bet an ice cream scooper would work too.

Was searching and searching for the perfect breakfast for a chilly December morning. This is it! So delicious I couldn't believe how easy they were to make. I didn't have vinegar, and added an egg, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfctly! Will make this many more times. Thanks for sharing!

Very good pancakes. I did add a little extra cinnamon and cook them on a med low as they are pretty thick.My daughter said she wanted to make them, so I let her and the first two she made were black on one side, she said they were not cooking! Well she didn't know that she had to flip them over!!! Totally my fault but I am still laughing about it.

(UPDATE) I've tried other pumpkin pancake recipes and I keep coming back to this one.  This is by far the best PP recipe I've tried.  So fluffy and delicious!!
These pancakes are so yummy with so much pumpkin flavor.  I love them and so do my kids!  I followed the recipe as is.  Thanks!

Thank you for the receipe. We love the pumpkin pancakes at I HOP, but can only get them at the end of the year. I made these and the kids and I loved them. We eat them with whip cream and they are excellent.

These were quite good.  I made them for Thanksgiving morning when I had leftover pumpkin puree.  I used whole wheat pastry flour, Splenda brown sugar substitute, and used applesauce for the oil to make them healthier.  I think next time I'll use pumpkin pie spice in place of the other spices and I might add some chopped pecans or chopped fresh cranberries. They did take quite a while to cook through because the batter is dense, but the flavor is excellent--tasted just like pumpkin pie (my husband loved them!).  I suggest letting the batter sit awhile to allow the baking soda to start lightning up the batter.  Spread the thick batter a bit with a spoon. The pancakes were surprising light, but filling.  It made a LOT of pancakes, so I froze them individually to microwave on a busier morning.  Thanks for a great recipe, Ruth!

Very good! This recipe makes a lot, but they freeze well for reheating a fast breakfast during the week.

I increased the cinnamon to 1 T, added 1/2 tsp on Nutmeg, 1 tsp vanilla and left out the vinegar. They were wonderful!

Great recipe overall.  I changed the spices to 1 tsp each of ground cinnamon, ground cloves, and nutmeg.  But that was just personal preference.  We also prefer a thinner pancake so I added about 1/4 cup more of milk.  I didn't feel that it diminished the pumpkin flavor at all.  I served them with a regular syrup mixed with gingerbread coffee syrup.  Great start to our Thanksgiving day!

I just made these for the second time. Awesome! They are thick, hearty, pancakes. Instead of allspice I used nutmeg (1/2 t.) and ground cloves (1 t.) increased cinnamon to 1 Tablespoon and ground ginger to 2 teaspoons. I increased the brown sugar and the oil to 4 Tablespoons each. Also increased the baking powder and soda to 2 teaspoon each. Use whole milk, or even condensed milk and don't add too much!

Love these pancakes. Better than Pumpkin Pie, only because I prefer this texture.  Does need a little more water to use all the flour mixture.

I also added 1/4 c whole wheat flour(subbed in for white) and 1 T Rum (brandy would work too) 2 eggs, and a tsp of vanilla, and FRESH ginger paste. AMAZING! Hubby says it's like pumpkin pie, ginger cookies and really yummy pancakes all in one bite!

Easy, quick and delicious!  What more could you want!  Like other reviewers I increased the milk to thin the batter.  I ended up adding an extra 1/2 cup.  Tastes like "Fall" in a pancake!

I had a bit of a challenge w/ the cooking process. They just didn't want to cook all the way thru before turning burnt on bottom. I use my cast iron alot but this was sad because the flavor (extra spices added of course) was wonderful!  I used whole wheat and whole flours, maybe this was the issue???? Any suggestions? Oh and I also doubled the recipe for my group. I tried different oil and heat. But just kept having to flip too early so they didn't turn black and then they were just wet and not hot enough.

This was awesome.  Sweet enough that we don't even put syrup on them.  I didn't have any ginger in the house, so I tossed in a dash of Pumpkin Pie spice instead, for one batch, and left the ginger out totally for the other batch.  Either way they were a hit at home and at work.

I have made this recipe several times, and it comes out awesome every time!  I add a little more cinnamon, like 2 tsp instead of the 1.  I have looked all over for a pumpkin pancake recipe and this one does the trick!  My 4 kids ask for these all the time...they are moist and flavorful.  Definitely worth a try!

SUper! I used a sweet variety of pumpkin (blue Hopi) so I used only 2 TBL. sugar. Also used  whole wheat flour. Pancakes had lots of flavor and were darkly beautiful. Used hand held wand to puree pumpkin and mix all ingredients. Came out super, made 16 pancakes.

This was a good base recipe.  The texture is right on but the taste was a very .  I think using some of the spices listed in greater quanitity would make these pancakes outstanding.  Definitely going to give these another go with some revisions.

These were wonderful.  I love that the pumpkin and accompaning spices are subtle enough to pair with some dark chocolate chips.  I typically am not a fan of choc. chip pancakes, to me they just don't go.  But with the flavors here they go deliciously.  Me and my kids are in love!!!!

These are the best pancakes I have EVER eaten. I took the suggestion of another reviewer to use evaporated milk instead of regular (used 1 c. evaporated milk, 1/2 c. skim milk), primarily to use up an already opened can in the fridge. I also used 2 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin spice instead of all the spices. These taste great with or without syrup. Perfect flavor, nice tender texture, so amazing!

Amazing! The batter is the fluffiest I've ever used! It must have been the vinegar and baking soda... Even with the  brown sugar omitted, they were delicious! I thought they were scrumptious with a little butter on top! Thanks for the great recipe!

Some said not to thin the batter with milk, but they were just too thick for my liking. Added just a bit more milk and was very happy with the result. A delicious, hardy fall breakfast!

Very tasty, I made 1/2 portion.  The only thing I added was a little vanilla.  Pancakes remain slightly moist in the middle because of the pumpkin, but I like this.  Pairs well with maple syrup.

Okay....I love pumpkin, anything pumpkin! And I am very picky.  These pancakes are awesome!  IHOP who?? So I used the advice of someone else and used 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice because I didn't have all spice.  Otherwise I made it by the recipe.  Also I probably will add more pumpkin next time, and I will definantly be making these again!!  The best pancakes ever!!

I can't believe it- but all 6 of my kids loved these! I wanted to use whole-wheat flour but I didn't and I'm glad; I think they would've been too heavy. Might try half and half next time... (We ate with strawberry all-fruit to top them)

I didn't think these were as fluffy as I expected them to be based on others' replies, but it could be "user error" on my part, too! Really great flavor and freeze well.

Even through I had to thin down the batter -they were awsome!  My kids loved them.  Great color.  I did sprinkle them with chocolate chips for the kids and pecans for the adults.  I loved this recipe.

Great recipe.  I used soy in place of the milk and thinned the batter slightly with 2 tablespoons of water.  I also replaced 1 tablespoon of oil with applesauce.  It turned out perfect.  All the kids at our house gobbled these up!

these were the tastiest pancakes i've ever had!  by the time you add maple syrup on top they taste just like pumpkin pie.  as other reviewers have suggested to NOT think the batter, i tried it exactly as is.  i was very skeptical because it was so thick but as long as you let them cook for a decent time on each side, they turn out nice and fat and fluffy.  i'd say if you're going to thin the batter do it very minimally. excellent recipe ruth - thanks!

These were really good.  I liked them better without syrup than with and that is really saying something. I felt like I couldn't taste the pumpkin if I covered them with syrup, and I really liked the taste.   They had a fluffy light texture even though they were a thicker pancake. I'll be making these again.

Doubled the recipe so I had some to freeze and pull out later for a quick breakfast. I already have a delicious pumpkin pancake recipe but there is about 3x as much fat in it, so I was looking for something a little healthier. This has a minimal amount of fat yet still delivers big taste and a very fluffy pancake. I even used half whole wheat flour and they were still quite fluffy, while still being thick and hearty so that you don't need to eat as many. Loved it topped with applesauce! So glad I have a better-for-us yummy pumpkin pancake recipe now!

Great Recipe! Used vanilla soy milk and substituted two heaping teaspoons of pumpkin pie mix for the spices as that is all I had on hand.  Next time I plan to add some finely chopped walnuts. Will be making again and again....served with sugar free syrup and a side of turkey sausage links for a great hearty/healthy weekend breakfast!

These pancakes are fantastic. I've been making the original recipe for quite some time but switched it up today. For the flour I used 1c. AP flour, 1/2c. whole wheat flour, 1/2c. oats, applesauce for the oil and lemon juice for the vinegar.  Let the batter sit for 15 minutes before cooking, still incredibly yummy. I make extra batches to freeze to have on hand for a quick breakfast.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

These were pretty good!  I love everything pumpkin but these pancakes had an earthy aftertaste for some reason.  I would probably try making them again though....maybe add some chocolate chips!!

Five stars for the consistency of these pancakes, which is outstanding--light, thick, fluffy, and much thicker than pictured.  But to my mind the taste was merely okay, which would be 3 stars.  I guess the bottom line is that I don't care for pumpkin in pancakes.

These were excellent pancakes!  My toddlers ate them right up and my nephew who is a fussy eater also ate a whole one too!  That's a 'miracle' in itself (I didn't tell him what was in it of course :)!).  I was completely shocked that he actually ate it and even got a 'Yum' out of him!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!   The only thing I didn't have was the all spice and it had great flavor without.  This tastes almost like eating pumpkin pie!  Thank you Ruth for sharing!

I make these using soy milk instead of regular.  They are the best with  my homemade Cinnamon Cream syrup.  I have requests for these all Fall/Winter.  My 18 month old especially loves them.

I've made this recipe several times and everytime the batter is a little too. But add a couple more tablespoons of milk and they are awesome. My younger siblings love when I make these and my parents like when I add a hand full of walnuts to the mix.

Great recipe, and a wonderful breakfast for Father's Day.  This will be a year-round favorite for the whole family.  UPDATE: Mini semi-sweet chocolate chips make a nice variation (needing no syrup).  The recipe also worked well for waffles.

I'm giving 5 stars even though I made a mistake.  My daughter was calling out ingredients to me from the computer while I was in the kitchen and she said only a 1/2 cup of milk.  I continued adding more milk, a little more than a cup, until I got the consistency right.  They had lots of flavour and tasted great.  Definitely a keeper.

these were delicious. I made them just as the recipe says and the batter was a bit thick but they came out just fine (i like dense pancakes).  the recipe only uses 1 cup of pumpkin, so you are left with a lot of pumpkin if you used canned pumpkin. I took the extra and mixed it with some maple syrup to make pumpkin syrup :) topped them with pumpkin syrup and banana slices. delicious!

I've had better pumpkin pancakes. A bit too dense and had to add extra seasoning to the batter as it was very bland tasting.

The first time I made these they were great!  The second time, I had to add more flour as the batter was too runny.  I used fresh pumpkin both times, so that may have had something to do with the consistancy of the batter.

The only reason I give this a 4 is because it should be accompanied by a homemade macadamia nut syrup.

I made these the other night for my siblings. I could tell by the batter they were going to be perfect!! My siblings put peanut butter and maple syrup on them, and they said they were sooooo good!! They gobled them up real fast! I saved some in the freezer for when I want some.

I upped the nutrition on these by substituting 1/4 cup garbanzo bean flour and 3/4 cup spelt flour for one of the cups of AP flour.  Added a handful of chopped walnuts and pumpkin seeds and a sprinkle of flax meal.  Also added some white chocolate and dark chocolate chips to entice two little girls.  They gobbled them up and I smiled at all the nutrition they had.

I really liked these pancakes! The pumpkin/spices are a good addition to plain old boring pancakes. Next time, I would like to substitute the vegetable oil for applesauce. Best with maple syrup and a mixture of walnuts and pecans.

These were pretty good.  I don't like a lot of spice, so I just used cinnamon.  They were very good!  The texture wasn't exactly what I had in mind, but it wasn't bad.

I have to add my 5 stars to this recipe; it was outstanding with the kids (with some of my usual adjustments for high altitude and boosting the recipe up to 7 cps of flour).  Regarding the thickness of the batter consistency, for any kind of pancakes I always add milk last to get the consistency I want, and I don't measure it.  In this case I used a bit more than a quart of milk for 7 cps flour, so I'm probably very close to the recipe proportions, but even a quarter cup makes a big difference (especially in the winter in CO with no humidity) in getting the batter thin enough to spread itself easily while keeping it intact.

Hint:  Due to the thickness of the batter make these pancakes small so the middle has time to cook through before they are overly browned or (godforbid) black!

Not as fantastic as the reviews stated. Added choc. chips after the first batch just to make them edible. They came out mushy on the inside like other reviewers stated.  Used soy milk and egg replacer for allergies, but this should not affect the consistency.

These were very tasty pancakes.  I made them like the recipe stated (how someone can radically alter the recipe and then have the audacity to rate the recipe, I'll never understand...pancake mix, come on!). These are some of the more moist, almost custard-like pancakes I've ever had and that is what took a star off for me.  I like study pancakes that hold up well to toppings.  That being said, it's worth a make and see for yourself.

Awesome recipe.  Only variation was adding a little extra milk and vanilla.  Served with the cinnamon cream syrup also found on this site.

These were great as is.  The only thing that I did was use less milk (1 cup + 2 tbsp) because I like my pancakes thick.  Yum! Yum! Thanks for the recipe.

These were delicious! I made them for my daughter and her friend, and both girls loved them.  I didn't change anything. They're okay plain, but with the syrup they're to die for!

The batter is pretty thick, but they turned out well for me.

Love love love! I do like a bit sweeter so I added 2TBS. brown sugar, 1/4 C pumpkin (because i wanted to use it up) and then eye balled a little more flour, a little more milk(i used rice milk by the way) and I added 1 tsp. vanilla as suggested by another member. And was it just me, but I got 14 1/4C. pancakes...give or take a little because I added a little more pumpkin, and milk and flour respectively??!! Geez.  But an AWESOME flavor...add chunks of pecans for a little extra flair.  No butter or syrup needed!  Which is good, because you will be eating a ton of the pancakes and that way you don't add the extra calories with the toppings. Just more pancakes. haha

These really poofed up a lot-and my husband prefers thin pancakes. So, I ended up using the rest of the mixture for waffles. Very Tasty! I would make them again, but maybe without the vinegar??

Wow. These are delicious. I wish I had tried these sooner. Definitely great for pumpkin lovers like me. ;) Great plain and even cold. I must admit though. I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used half white flour and the other half whole wheat flour and I used apple cider vinegar instead as that was all I had on hand. I also omitted the oil completely and used almond milk instead of cow's milk. I'll definitely be making these often. Though someday I'm going to try it completely with whole wheat flour as I prefer it over white.

These were fantastic.  I used one cup of WW flour in place of white flour; instead of the spices I used 1 cup pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin puree, and in place of the oil I used applesauce.  The end result were fluffy, flavorful pancakes that my kids gobbled up.  Thank you!!!

I love these! Such a beautiful sunny color, and cozy flavor. I used evaporated milk, and 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour. Yummy! They are so puffy (don't add extra milk to batter-they're great thick). Since they're so thick, I cook them on med. heat.

These were great!  I liked them a little thicker, so I added about a cup of batter and didn't flatten them out.  After we put the batter on the griddle, I added some ground flax, chopped walnuts and a little brown sugar.  Then when they were flipped over to finish cooking, the nuts toasted and the brown sugar caramelized.  Plus the nuts add some protein and fiber.

FANTASTIC!  I tried these for the first time on Thanksgiving morning and they were a hit with everyone - even my fiancee who thought the idea of pumpkin pancakes sounded terrrible and wouldn't stop hounding me about it loved them and agreed it would now be a holiday staple in our family.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted 3 tsp. (doubled the amount b/c I love the taste, but stick with 1.5tsp if you're not a fanatic like me) pumpkin pie spice for the spices just to make it a bit easier.

These were delicious! I took a few suggestions from previous comments, such  add a second egg and a small amount of vanilla, and they came out great. Very Pumpkin-y. I've tried other pumpkin pancake recipes before, and they didn't taste like pumpkin, which defeats the purpose, but this recipes retains the full pumpkin flavor.

I feel I should write a review since everyone loves these. Here are how I think they are best. Use Libby's canned pumpkin (or one from regular market) instead of Trader Joes or homemade. I use Pumpkin pie spice for simplicity...a teaspoon or more. 
   If I add in chocolate chips my daughter says that they are better than cookies!

This recipe was delicious!  I used melted butter instead of oil.  I also did about 1.5-2 tsp. cinnamon and added about 1/2 tsp. cloves.  I had to add extra milk in order to get it thin enough to spread on my griddle. My two year-old scarfed several of these very quickly!

I made the recipe as stated but when I saw how thick the batter was I added more milk to thin it out a bit.  These were very yummy.  Not overly sweet but just right with syrup and some chopped walnuts. Fit the fall season perfectly!

Oh yummy!  Instead of adding all of the individual spices, I just use the canned Pumpkin Pie Mix, applesauce instead of oil, and whole wheat flour vs. white all-purpose.  My family loves them topped with coolwhip and syrup!! (Be ready to gain 1lb per pancake consumed.)

These were decent, but my search will continue for the perfect pumpkin pancake recipe..I was hoping they'd be a little creamier, more like pumpkin pie. My son LOVED them so I froze them and reheated them in the toaster as needed, but my husband was not a fan.

I do love these pancakes!  I have been making them for a couple years.  I was on the hunt for a great pumpkin pancake recipe after having some at IHOP.  Now, these are so much better than I won't even eat the ones at IHOP.  I do add quite a bit (about double) the spices, a little molasses and pecans.  I l-o-v-e them!!

My family wasn't a big fan of these pancakes.  I think we're used to the fluffy pancakes and the pumpkin makes them a little dense.

These are very good. I halved the recipe and added a bit more pumpkin and they came out great. Awesome with the cinnamon syrup from this site!

I took the advice from "Nancy" and used 2 1/2 cups pancake mix for the dry ingredients. Increased milk to 1 3/4 cups. And left everything else the same. The kids loveds them. Came out nice and fluffy. I think it could have used a little more spice.

These pancakes were a hit with my family.  They were not too sweet and did not have too strong of a pumpkin taste.  I used fresh pumpkin that we pureed ourselves from a baked pumpkin.  I also used freshly ground wheat flour with a tsp of gluten added.  I used Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of measuring everything out.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Often, things are a bit heavy with the freshly milled flour, but with this recipe, the pancakes came out fluffy and delicious!

I love pumpkin flavored everything, but these pancakes are the exception.  I followed the original recipe to a 'T.'  They are very rich and filling and lack in spice.

These pancakes made the whole house smell wonderful, but the batter was a bit heavy.  I thinned it out and had a wonderful breakfast.  Remember to oil your pan, as they are low in fat and tended to stick to my nonstick griddle.

This is a very good recipe, I followed it per the instructions except I forgot to add in the brown sugar. We did not miss it at all! Topped it with some maple syrup, redi-whip and a sprinkle of pumpkin spice and it was DIVINE! A definite repeat for when I have some left over pumpkin. Thanks for the share =)

About a year later from the first time I made this here are a few modifications I made to work with a food allergy - sub the milk for vanilla soy milk, omitted the egg and used 1 c AP Flour and 1 c whole wheat flour with and additional 1 tsp of pumpkin spice. Got the maple syrup and agave from Trader Joes and sugar free redi-whip and it is BETTER than when we first made it, meets our allergy needs and a bit healthier - thanks again for the baseline recipe :)

This has been the best so far of all the pumpkin pancake recipes I have tried.  The first time I tried it I did the recipe to the T but was way to heavy for me and not enough spice kick.  The second time I made it I added an extra egg(which made them lighter) and used 1 1/2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and a tablespoon of cinnamon used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of white sugar. Also a teaspoon of vanilla.
Yummy!!!

This was an awesome recipe!  It was a lot thicker than I had anticipated, but it still came out great.  I also ended up adding a little bit more milk to thin it out some more and everything was fine.  :D  I'll be making this again that's for sure.

I made these for my son on Halloween.  They were good but very thick.  Next time I would add a little more cinnamon and spices to kick it up a bit.

We had a pumpkin from Halloween which we pureed and froze, but I had two cups left (huge pumpkin made 34 cups).  We tried this recipe, and it was excellent.  My kids loved it!  I have to give this five stars because it was great.

Yummy! We loved these pancakes. Very thick, flavorful and not too sweet. It didn't taste like pumpkin pie, just enough pumpkin flavor. I sprinkled the kids' with a little cinnamon/sugar mix and they loved them!
I make small pancakes, and it made a lot of small ones. Leftovers for tomorrow.

These are good but not amazing. The texture and pumpkin flavor was nice but I think I will add more sugar next time. I followed the recipe exactly but added a splash of pure vanilla extract. Very easy to make using the spread out with your scoop method. Flip when you see bubbles forming at the surface of the pancake. You should not need to flip twice ever for pancakes.

AWESOME!  I felt like a star having been the person who made them.  I made some slight changes like substituting 1 3/4 C wheat flour for the 2 C all purpose flour called for in the recipe.  I also halfed the ginger tripled the cinnamon, used 1 3/4 - 2 C milk, and added 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp of clove and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I have now made them 5 or 6 times and my sometimes picky husband and 2 year old daughter LOVES them! To save time, I pre-mixed all the dry ingredients in a ziplock for the next time.  Good luck.

thanks for posting!!!

Unfortunately I used fresh pumpkin and they were much too thick. I had to double the spices for added flavor since fresh pumpkin is pretty bland. Also, I had to add water to thin it out a little. So I will try them again with canned pumpkin and hopefully have a better outcome.

I thought this was OK, especially since we are not real pancake eating people.  I made as directed, but used 1 cup wheat flour as read in other comments, and added some extra pumpkin pie spice to taste.  My girls said they liked it, but did not gobble it up.  Nice for a change of pace.

After having pumpkin pancakes at Ihop last weekend, I decided to look for a recipe to replace the one I lost from a couple years ago. I followed the recipe exactly, and the pancakes were delicious. They were both filling and light. Not tough or chewy as many pancakes are. Made lots of extras to reheat later!

The pancakes were moist and had good flavor.  My 10 year old loved them.  I used bisquick and added the extra ingredients as another person suggested.

Super good! I used about 1/2 cup whole wheat flour in place of some the white flour to make them just a tad heartier. We'll be enjoying the leftovers later on this week. Yum!

These are very hearty and quite good.  Great for feeding a crowd, and healthy too with the right ingredients.  I replaced 1/2 the flour with whole wheat graham flour and used canola oil.  I also used red wine vinegar, and you could not taste it.  These do brown up quickly and are so thick that it's hard to get the middles and sides done before they're brown.  I've found that if they're a little soft when they come off the griddle, stack them on a plate, and carryover cooking will finish them off.  We ate them warm, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  Like a yummy pumpkin donut, but better!

This recipe was a hit with my family!  We only made 2 changes - First, we omitted the egg as my daughter is allergic to eggs & Second we added extra milk to thin them out to the consistency we prefer.  They were perfect, we will be making these often!

Heaven on earth!  I added one extra egg to the mix.  I also drizzled some Smucker's Butterscotch Caramel and sprinked chopped walnuts on top.  Breakfast doesnt get more delicious!

WOW! Super hearty, filling pancakes.  My husband and son loved them.  The only change/suggestion that I have is to maybe add 1-2 more tablespoons of milk.  Another reviewer said not to but I had a hard time cooking them all the way through without burning them.  Otherwise, excellent recipe!

I hate to be the downer when everyone else loved this recipe, but it just disappointed me.  The taste was good, but they were so thick that they were hard to spread and very hard to flip.  As a result, they tasted ok but looked so ugly!  Maybe I should have added more milk?

Very yummy!! My family loved them and has suggested having these more often-even the dogs were begging for more. Next time, I will add more cinnamon and ginger-but that's just a personal preference. These were a hit as is.

I didn't change anything (except I doubled the recipe)... and they were awesome! My hubby doesn't like it when I try new recipes (why don't you just make one you know is good?), but even he had to admit that these were yummier than my normal recipe! :) Very good with sausage patties and apple cider! Yum!

I will give this recipe a 3 star rating. My pancakes turned out horribly flat. They tasted good but were gummy. DON'T use buttermilk!!! Might try them again, but will probably stick with the Oatmeal Pancakes. YUM

I tried this recipe because I was going for something different and the reviews said it was fabulous. I was disappointed though. My pancakes were very doughy, almost like eating under cooked cake. I am not sure I would make this again. Maybe I made a mistake.

Very good pancakes and good for you.  I think these pancakes will become the new standard for pancakes in our house since we can squeeze in some extra nutrients with the pumpkin.  Be careful not to burn these.

Amazing!
My changes: a bit less ginger, no oil (wasn't needed at all, as these are super moist), and an absolute must: wheat flour!  I've made these with white and wheat flour and the wheat is by far my favorite.  
Toppings:  A small amount of butter and real maple syrup, they don't need much at all.

It's so hard to find a good pumpkin pancake recipe that uses fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned pumpkin. My daughter and I made these pancakes and they were WONDERFUL! I made a couple substitutions... I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices and I substituted 1/2 the flour for whole wheat. Then after starting I realized the kids had used all the milk. So I substituted Chai Soy Milk.... YUM!

I really liked these, so did my husband.  The kids ate them, but were not too impressed.  I added chocolate chips to some of them to make them a little sweeter.  This is a great recipe.

These were amazing.  Will be making these again and again.  Only changes were - I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the other spices, didn't use the oil, and didn't use the vinegar as I used some leftover buttermilk topped up with regular milk.

Excellent recipe that created moist subtle tasting pancakes.  Added about a half tsp of nutmeg to the mix.  As well, about two ounces less of the pumpkin as recommended.  Would definitely make again.

Best pumpkin pancakes ever! I used apple cider vinegar and added extra milk to thin the batter a little (I like thinner pancakes). I always double the recipe and freeze the leftover batter.

This is certainly not a "Weekday Morning" recipe.  It takes FOREVER - but I'll tell ya, THESE ARE TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT!! I did make a few changes... I used evaporated milk, an extra tbs of brown sugar, GOBS more spices (cloves, nutmeg, more cinn / ginger / allspice), I did add a generous splash of 1% milk to loosen up the batter a bit, and a heapin' spoonful of applesauce.  These changes were divine.  Will make again, only save it for a weekend when I feel like spendin' oodles of time in the kitchen.

These were pretty good for the autumn season. However, I would've preferred a stronger pumpkin taste but the recipe is certainly strong at compromising for everyone, whether pumpkin is a favorite of yours or not.

Incredicbly thick... so much so that even though I smashed them into the pan, the middles were not done.. the outsides got burnt... I turned down the heat, but the insides still did not get done. I had to microwave them to finish them off, which left me with a limp pancake... I am dissapointed in the recipe because of this. The texture in my mouth was not pleasing, as I had to keep drinking orange juice to wash it down...

Now, the taste was excellent. My kids scarfed them down like there was no tomorrow... that is the only reason I didn't give this recipe a 1.

My boyfriend made these as a surprise birthday breakfast for me last year (I LOVE pumpkin, and I'm a November baby...so it fits).  They were super dense and thick, so the pancakes were a heavy breakfast for sure.  The flavor was amazing, though!

I am more of an experimental cook than he is- so maybe I will try some of the suggestions others had and review again!  I will definitely try again!

Originally I wanted to make some pancakes and I end up with pancakes and some wafles..... Both were good, though. I was afraid that the pumpkin flavour would be too strong but no it was perfect!
I also cooked them few minutes longer than required by the recipe because as a reviewer said the batter was really thick.
I would definitely make it again but this time with some extra sugar!

These were just alright.  Even after I turned the heat down to medium-low, I still had to add a splash of milk to get the pancakes to cook evenly.  The flavor wasn't what I was looking for.

This was a great recipe! I didn't have allspice, so I just ground up some cloves and added a little nutmeg. I also didn't have vinegar so I used lemon juice. I also added some chopped up walnuts for a little extra something! You may have to play with the temperature a little bit though, as these are heavier than regular pancakes. I had to go lower than the recipe states! Bon apetit.

Best pancakes EVER.  They are super moist, very flavorful, and a perfect comfort food for a cold winter morning.  My boys loved them.  I think they taste like hot fresh homemade pumpkin donuts.

Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! My 2 young boys and picky husband love these! I find they are a bit doughy in the middle. Cook on a low heat. I use 1/4 t ginger and 1/4 t nutmeg instead of the 1/2 t ginger. Try these they are GREAT!!!

WICKED AWESOME!  These were nice and fluffy and tasted SOO good.  I try to use alternative flours instead of white flour but for this recipe, I didn't.  It came out great but tastes too much like flour to me.  I'm going to try some other flours to see if I can get a better taste :)

These were actually pretty good. I followed suggestions here of processing the wet ingredients and letting the batter sit for a couple of minutes. Came out very good.

These weren't the right consistency, but the flavor was good. I used nutmeg because I don't have ground ginger. I had to thin a little with milk, but the center was still underdone and doughy (while the outside was crisp and just past done). Next time I will cut back on the pumpkin and flour a bit. I also found some recipes that add beaten egg whites, so I will also try that. This one isn't there yet but almost!

This will be a new pre-thanksgiving tradition for our family!  We had extra pumpkin when making pies, so tried this recipe.  The only modification was to leave out the ginger, because I didn't have any.   Real whipped cream was the perfect topping.  Note that the pancakes are very thick, but it wasn't a problem.

These were very yummy. I took the advice of one reviewer that recommended to smash them a little on the griddle and that helped to make sure they were done all the way through. These made a great start to Thanksgiving 2007!

These pancakes are awsome.  I am taking them to the in-laws for a Thanksgiving Breakfast with home made Maple Syrup.
Would have never thought of putting vinegar in pancakes, it must do something with the baking powder and pumpkin.  These are truly the best.

A delicious fall treat.  Be careful not to overmix the batter.  Also, don't flatten the batter on the griddle - leave it mounded up.  It will make big fluffy pancakes! This is TREMENDOUS when paired with the Sauteed Apples recipe from this site.

These were, by far, the best pancakes I have ever tasted. I omitted the vinegar and added nutmeg. I also think I will try this batter, since it is soooo thick, as a donut batter next. Thanks for a great recipe.

So good! I supstituted whole-wheat flour, added a splash more milk, and used the Splenda Brand Brown Sugar, and they were amazing! My kids LOVED them! They taste just like pumkin bread!

Thanks!

I made these for my three and two year old and our two twenty something newphews who were visiting. The kids have become picky eaters lately so I was a bit nervous, but everyone enjoyed them. I added chopped pecans to the batter. The batter was really thick. Did not matter they came out nice a fluffy with a pleasant flavor.

This recipe will replace the one that I have been using-these are full of flavor and the whole family gobbled them up!  The only changes I made were: about 1/4 cup of wheat germ added in place of a 1/4 cup of flour, a dash more cinnamon, a dash more sugar and I needed to add a couple of splashes of milk because the batter was really thick.  With butter and real Vermont maple syrup-these were super yummy!

These were pretty good. Definitely very moist and rich. My only problem was with the spices. I didn't really care for the taste of the ginger and the allspice. Next time I will omit those two spices and double the cinnamon as I think it will suit our tastes better. Still a very good recipe though.

We made these as a cooking project in my son's pre-K class. There is plenty of measuring & mixing to keep the kids busy.  We used pumpkin pie spice instead of the separate spices (2 tsp total). We also shook heavy cream to make homemade butter to go on top.  With maple syrup and whipped cream happy faces, the kids LOVED them. Several kids had seconds.

These pancakes were great!!!!  They do take a bit longer to cook as mentioned in previous reviews...lower heat it best.  I too omitted the allspice and added 1/4tsp of nutmeg.  My two year olds and in-laws loved them!  Will definitely make again.

Loved these pancakes.I left out the ginger, because I didn't have it on hand. I did use pumpkin pie spice in place of the all spice. These were great warmed up the next day too. YUM!!!!!

GREAT pancakes.  I was afraid when someone said they weren't very sweet, so I added chocolate chips to a few of the pancakes while cooking.  They were delicious!  My husband and older daughter preferred the ones without.  I also served with hot cider syrup from another recipe here.  Yum!

Great pancakes!  The first bite I took, I thought they might be undercooked, but they're just more moist than your regular pancakes.  I ate them without anything on top, but some warmed applesauce would be good.  I followed the recipe exactly except used 1/4 t. nutmeg instead of allspice.

YUM!! I made these tonight for a quick dinner and they are amazing. I added a touch more pumpkin and spices than called for, but other than that, I made them just exactly as described. (If you have trouble with them burning before they cook through, lower the temp of your griddle/pan.) I don't love maple syrup, so I served mine simply with a bit of honey butter and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. Thanks for this great autumn recipe!

I liked these! Next time I would add more pumpkin and an extra egg white. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and they came out just fine. Topped them with unsweetened applesauce.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were delicious! I used the advice of mixing the wet ingredients in a food processor and flattening out 1/4 cup batter.  I whipped some cream with cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar for the topping.

These pancakes received raves from all 5 of us!!!  I added some white raisins and broken pieces of walnuts to the batter while cooking (sprinkled on top) and this made them even more special.  I also cooked them on my electric griddle and used a small amount of butter.

I love love love these pancakes.  Perfect on crisp fall Saturday morning, with delicious Canadian Maple Syrup.  I have to admit I crave them often.  With the leftovers I pop them in the toaster and they are perfect.

I made these this morning and they were a hit! We topped them with fresh whipped cream and maple syrup. I saw baking pumpkins in the store recently, and can't wait to use some fresh puree! I also had issues with them not getting done in the middle, but found that I was using too much batter at once and not spreading thin enough. Once I cut down how much I was using, lowered the heat slightly, and spread it way out, they were PERFECT!

Not a hit in my house.  They weren't sweet enough and the texture wasn't good.  I won't make them again. The kids ate them without complaint, though.

My 14 month old and 2 1/2 year old "demand" pancakes almost every day. I've been looking for a substitute for  plain pancakes and this is it!  Everybody loved them. I made the recipe as witten and had no difficulty cooking them through. They are certainly a little thicker than a regular pancake, but that is part of the appeal. I love the idea of adding vegetable (pumpkin) and less sugar than in an average pancake recipe.  I will definitely be making these again!

These were fabulous just as the recipe states but I made slight modifications to personalize the to taste. I added 3 TBS of maple sugar and 2 TBS chopped crystalized ginger to the batter. Perfect cold-weather brunch food!

The pancakes were a hit!  I first tasted them at our town's pumpkin festival.  A local couple made them and they were delicious and shared the source for the recipe.  I did take their advice and added more milk to the above recipe, they were then a little lighter and fluffier.  I also didn't have have allspice but substituted 1/2 tsp of cloves.  It worked.

These weren't bad, but they were much thicker than what I usually prefer my pancakes to be. This could have been because I scaled the recipe to one serving, but I ended up adding about 1/4c of water to the batter so it wasn't like cookie dough. The flavor of these was nice, and maple syrup complimented them well.

I thought these pancakes were just "okay."  The were very heavy and dense (I guess I just like pancakes on the fluffy side).  Flavor was good, but nothing extraordinary.

I followed the recipe exactly and the batter was way too thick. I had to add more milk and pumpkin and then after tasting the first one, they needed a little extra sugar. Better to cook as a silver dollar pancake, anything bigger comes out burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. There are good if you are looking for something different, but I probably won't make again.

Very good recipe.  My kids really loved it, and my husband, too.  We will definitely repeat this.  The only reason I gave it four stars was because I love a little bit fluffier  pancake.  But other than that--great flavor.  Served it with apple cinnamon syrup and/or applesauce.

I'd give these pancakes a 4.5 star rating.  I increased the brown sugar to 4 tsp., pumpkin to 1 1/4 cups, and milk to 2 cups.  I added an extra egg as well as 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice.  I used pumpkin which my husband had boiled and pureed from a Halloween pumpkin carving contest.

Thanks so much to the creator of this recipe!  

I used whole wheat graham flour for a heartier flavour, and butternut squash instead of pumpkin.  I also had to add more milk, but was thrilled with the result.  Delicious!

Also, I buy my spices fresh in bulk and had to use far less than the recipe called for -- maybe the problem some previous reviewers have had with blandness is because their spices are too old and stale.

I needed to add more milk, but also I added a little more pumpkin and cinnamon, just because there was not as much pumpkin flavor as I would have hoped.  However, I used whole wheat flour and white flour (1/2 and 1/2)  That possibly could have been cause for my troubles.  Tasted great, but trying to change the recipe so much frustrated me.  Shoulda just stuck with the original.  :)

Delicious! Gave them to my daughters plain and they ate them right up. I used real maple syrup and loved the taste of the pancakes and the texture! Great for cold autumn mornings:)

I made these for a camping trip with my family and everyone truly enjoyed them.  I had no ground allspice so I substituted a tad more cinnamon and ginger to take its place.  I also added some more milk as others have suggested to thin them out a little.  I will definitely make these again!

These pancackes were delicious....a great variation of the usual pancake recipe I use.  I also used a little extra milk to thin them out a bit.  They tasted great served with some powdered sugar sprinkled on top.

This was an ok recipe, looked great and tasted very nice.  It did seem though, more like spiced pancakes, which is still a good thing!  I reduced the flour to 1Â¾ Cups but they were still very dense and had to be thinned out.  I'm definately going to try them again and see how much more pumpkin I can add without compromising the pancakes.  Thanks for the recipe!

An absolute family favorite!  I've made these for anyone and everyone...rave reviews from all.  I add a little extra milk to thin the batter a bit and use a tad less allspice, but otherwise keep the recipe "as is".  Perfect for cool fall mornings, but I can't resist them any time of year!  I always make more to use the whole can of pumpkin, then freeze the rest for quick breakfasts anytime.

We have been making this recipe for more than a year now and love it! I do use a little bit more milk (about 1/2 cup). If you love pumpkin, you will love these. We will be making them Christmas morning!

This is a fantastic recipe!!! I used leftover pumpkin puree I made for pumpkin pies. They were spectacular! I would highly recommend this recipe. I had no problems with it being too thick. My children loved them and they are very picky. They were light, fluffy and very flavorful. I will make these pancakes again!
***an update*** I have been making these for awhile now. There are a few things I have learned: 1) If you use fresh pumpkin puree they turn out better than they do if you use canned. 2)If you use canned pumpkin, you MUST thin it a bit. I use apple juice (approx. 1/3 a cup) and it is wonderful! 3) If you substitute a pancake mix it will not be an amazing pancake. It just won't taste the same. It will be "OK", but don't expect much. It will be a 2 1/2 star pancake at best. 4) If you substitute pumpkin pie spice, it is wonderful but just as good as the spice combo they recommend.
I hope this helps someone. :)

I didn't have allspice so the slight lack of flavor might have come from that.  This is a great seasonal recipe.

I was a little skeptical when I saw how thick the batter was (I spooned it into the pan), but these turned out wonderful! I did have to cook them on lower heat a little longer to get the centers done, but they were moist and thick and tasted like pumpkin pie! They only change I made was adding extra cinnamon because mine had been in the cabinet a little while. I will definately make these again!

Wow, these are incredible.  I love anything pumpkin, especially warm and during fall.  I did add another egg and used 2-1/2 cups of milk as well.  But they taste wonderful, especially on this cold, fall morning.  My roommates couldn't stop raving about them.  Yum, yum.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

I was craving pumpkin pancakes while I was pregnant and came across this recipe.  My husband thought I was crazy when I said we were having pumpkin pancakes for dinner but he loved it and they have become a regular rotation on our dinner menu.  As other reviewers I do have to add some extra milk to get them to the right consistency.  Next time I make I will try substituting some wheat flour for some of the all-purpose.

I just made pumpkin pancakes the other night using a different recipe.  I thought they were o.k. but really thick (I could hardly swallow without drinking some milk!).  Anyway, in hunting a new recipe I found this one and was astonished at the difference in taste and texture.  These are amazing!  I omitted the baking powder and instead added 1 cup of yogurt, 1 cup less of milk, and 1 extra teaspoon of baking soda.  I also added a little extra milk as suggested.  It took about 5 minutes to cook each pan full but it was worth it!  Definately try these!

Fabulous! I used Libby pumpkin, so I did have to add some extra milk (not too much) and an extra egg. I added a pinch of ground cloves and some fresh grated nutmeg. It's like eating pumpkin pie for breakfast . . . I will definitely be making these many more times.

This recipe was great. I didn't need to use muchvmore milk, the batter was thick but will yield better texture then too thin. I used the fresh squeezeable ginger in a tube, and added some currents.

My toddlers liked them so much that I doubled the batch and stored the left-over batter in the fridge for a quick and healthy breakfast or snack.  I cook up a few pancakes and let the kids dip them in maple syrup or roll applesauce up in them.  I added the extra eggs (two since I doubled it) and more milk to thin it a little.

Good recipe, great flavor, but I had to tweak it a bit to get the pancakes the right texture. My first few were dense and gooey, not light and cakey. In addition to more milk, as others recommended, I also added another egg and more flour. After those changes, they were delicious.

The pancakes were great. I was not a big fan of pancakes until now.  I loved them so much I fixed them for dinner.  I did follow some of the suggestions and used 2 cups of milk.  I also used the 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of the allspice, cinnamon and ginger.

I used butternut squash instead of the pumpkin  I happened to have a small one in the house. I peeled and cubed it then boiled till tender(did not want to put the oven on). I used 2 cups of  jiffy baking mix instead of the flour, baking soda, powder and the oil. These came out pretty good and due to boiling the squash my batter was not to thick at all.

These are okay.  I think they need to taste more pumpkiny.  The batter is awfully thick.  It doesn't hurt to add a little more milk.  They were pretty fluffy, but they taste as a little bland to me.

These are great.  I added an extra egg and a bit more milk and they were delicious.  A nice change from our usual pancakes.

Fantastic! My kids and I loved this!  Will definitely make again.  I didn't have allspice so I used nutmeg. Also increased the milk to 2 cups. What a great texture and flavor.  Thank you Ruth!

These were SO tasty.Totally enjoyed!! Being a busy Mom, I changed a little to suit the timing I have in the morning. I started with the Complete Pancake Mix (made recipe for 12-14 pancakes). Before adding the water, I blended the Allspice, Ginger, & Cinnamon with the Pancake Mix. Then I added the water, then pumpkin...mixed well. Don't get me wrong, baking from scratch is the BEST. Thanks, Ruth, for the WONDERFUL recipe :o)

These were a big hit with my kids and hubbie.  Served them for dinner.  I used about a cup of buttermilk, a cup (at least) of regular milk, and omitted the vinegar.  Will definitely make them again!

Very good pancakes.  Batter comes out rather thick but still tasty.  For second batch, added more milk to thin.  Flavor is nice and mild.  Can add more spices if you prefer more intense flavor.
