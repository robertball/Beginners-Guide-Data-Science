This is terrific!  I've been trying a lot of the rice pudding recipes and find this one to be one of my favorites so far.  I had some left over rice and used that but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was easy and the pudding firmed up nicely even though I thought that it was a little to liquidy at first. Thanks

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe. The preparation is complicated and the results weren't good enough to justify the effort. There are easier ways to make a better, smoother rice pudding. Also, with the added meringue the dish was too sweet. If you plan to make it I suggest reducing the amount of sugar in the meringue by about half. In its favor,  the finished dish looks wonderful.

I've been making rice pudding this way for years - I sometimes omit the raisins and put a thin layer of raspberry jam on top of the pudding before putting on the meringue - it really is quite good too.

I MADE THIS WITHOUT THE MERINGUE AND I HAVE TO SAY, IT IS THE BEST RICE PUDDING THAT I HAVE EVER HAD!  TWO OF MY FRIENDS HAVE ALSO TRIED IT WHEN THEY HAVE COME OVER, AND THHEY AGREE WITH ME.  I HAVE LUPPUS AND AM VERY SICK, SO I CAN'T EAT VERY MANY THINGS, BECAUSE OF MY ILLNESS.   THIS HOWEVER, HAS BEEN A LIFE-SAVER. I HAVE MADE IT THREE TIMES IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS, AND IT HAS KEPT MY WEIGHT AROUND 92 LBS.  THANK YOU FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL RECIPE!

It is a good recipe, though very time consuming. My husband and I liked it but my kids only liked the meringue. It did need cinnamin in the rice mix. I will use it again though.

This recipe was great. My mom loved it. I didn't use the water and it still turned out great. I just added a bit of cinnamon on top and served.

Pretty good, I think that it needed a little more lemon juice. It took way too long to cook, but the effort was well worth it!

This is a great recipe...but...I don't get the meringue.  I feel like such a traitor!  I am a meringue enthusiast, I am!  BUT in this recipe it just seemed so out of place.  I felt like I was having two separate desserts together and missing the lemon filling or something. Next time I'll skip the meringue or maybe just make a pie if I'm in such a mood.

This was a bit more work than most Rice Puddings I have made.  But I think it was worth it.  It was a bit dry after it was completely done, I mixed the topping in well with the pudding and then added some evaporated milk to bring it back to the creamier stage, it was fabulous!!!

Thanks for this recipe—the meringue adds a fun twist to the basic baked custard recipe. I'm not a big fan of baked pudding because it's never as smooth as desktop or slow-cooker pudding, but this adds a fun way to use the leftover egg whites as meringue that looks so appealing! 

Here's my variation: I made  slow-cooker rice pudding then added meringue at the end; here's how:  Prepare your favorite slow cooker recipe as described, but refrigerate the egg whites while the rice pudding cooks. During the last 1/2 hour of cooking, follow the meringue preparation for this recipe and remember to preheat the oven. Transfer the pudding to a large baking dish and spoon the  meringue mixture on top, making peaks with the spoon. Bake until meringue is cooked and golden approx. 8-10 minutes.

Yes I will make it again. Upon tasting it the pudding needed longer cooking time but the liquid was running low.
