I really enjoyed it though it didn't come out as it should have.  There is too much liquid in this in order for it to be a stir fry.  You would probably need to add another tsp of cornstarch to thicken the sauce but also saute the vegetables to reduce the liquid (esp. from the frozen green beans).  The can of diced tomatoes turned this more into a stew and so I decided to just go that route and added a full can (I had gotten the 28 oz. can) to the fry.  Even though this shouldn't be a soup, it tastes delicious as such.  It's so hearty and filling with all the vegetables and the liquid from the tomatoes, one serving will fill you up, there's no need for bread.  Next time, I will probably add 3 cloves of garlic while cooking the pork.  This would be a great hearty winter soup/stew.

Yum! One of my most favorite combinations in all the world is green beans and tomatoes. This recipe adds a couple more of my favorite things and rocks my face off. I'm not a huge polenta fan, but my guy loves it so I pan-fried it and served it on the side of the "stir-fry" (though I did taste it and it went very well with this). The brand of petite diced garlic tomatoes I got had a thickish liquid, so I only added half the cornstarch called for and it was perfect. I imagine regular diced tomatoes are juicy enough to use the full amount. Thanks for the recipe - excellent! :)

This was very good.  I subbed chicken for pork (I don’t really like pork and I didn’t want that to affect my opinion of the recipe).  It was very tasty and came together very easily—and was kind of fun to make!  I think when I make it again I might add a little milk to the sauce to make it a little different and creamy, but it’s not necessary.  The polenta was a good touch and very tasty!   I tried it with both parmigiana and mozzarella and I think I like the mozzarella a little bit more.  The leftovers were just as good, if not better the next day.  Great recipe!

Fabulous! Other than using more veggies than called for I didn't change a thing and it was delicious.  I wasn't too sure about the polenta, having never used it before, but it was good.  It took three Kroger employees to find it for me, and I live in the southwest! Will definitely make again.

This is really good, my son & DH liked it more than I did. I felt it lacked a little flavor but they really liked the flavor. So I would have given it 4 stars, but since they both really liked it, and because it was a great weeknight meal, I'll give it 5 stars :) I followed the recipe very closely, the only change I made was to serve it over whole wheat pasta instead of polenta.

I thought it was okay, but it was missing something. My 12 year old gobbled it down, but my husband thought it was bland.  I followed another's advise and boiled some orzo which I thought was a great idea.

This was quick and easy to prepare but it just wasn't a winner at my house.  I did use chicken instead of pork and red onion instead of white because that's what I had on hand.

A great blend of flavors! I couldn't find polenta, so I ended up serving this on top of a white asparagus risotto. This will certainly be added to the rotation.

I used a very lean pork roast- That said, the lack of fat made it a little tough and it had an odd taste, though that of course isn't being reflected on my rating. I used a can of green beans and a can of wax beans in place of the 2 cups of frozen green beans. I also subbed button mushrooms for the cremini, and added diced summer squash, zucchini as well as two large cloves of garlic. The cornstarch isn't enough to thicken up the liquids to make this into a stir-fry, this more like a loose, but filling stew. We don't like polenta so I served this over elbow macaroni. I used Romano instead of Parmesan and mixed it directly into the dish before plating. It lacks somewhat in seasoning and I will tweak that next time I make this.

Great 'home cooking' kind of meal.  Here's what I did differently; I seasoned the pork with salt and pepper, seasoned the vegetables with Italian herbs and butter, used fire-roasted diced tomatoes with garlic and simmered the entire mixture for about 15min.  The whole family enjoyed!

My family liked this, and it certainly is easy. I put fresh garlic and the onions in before the meat and used asparagus.  The sauce was not at all watery, but we like mor of it.  Next time I will try adding some pepper flakes. I found it a little bland.  Am I showing my age?

I thought this recipe was fabulous and a different, but great use for pork!  I made a few changes based on our taste and what I had on hand.  I use canned mushrooms, and added a half red bell pepper, sliced.  Instead of polenta, which I am not a fan, I boiled 1 cup orzo then added to the recipe in it's place.  Very good recipe, very fresh!

Delicious and very fresh tasting. I left out the polenta and only used a pinch of additional salt, but otherwise made as written. The only change I would make next time is to use fresh beans instead of frozen.

This was yummy. Only changes were to cook the polenta on a skillet to get it a little crunchy and then I poured the stew over the top and i added a little bit of cajun spice to give it some heat.

I really liked this recipe, though I did cut the amount of italian green beans in half and added cannelini for a bit of fiber. I also doubled the garlic, and used a good bit of basil from my garden. But it came out a bit bland, though tasty. I finally doubled the cheese, but used Pecorino Romano instead of regular parmesan. I had the feel that it was missing something, maybe kale or endive? All in all, a good recipe.

My husband doesn't like polenta and said "even the polenta was good". And the 5-year old ate the pork, green beans, and even some polenta. A winner! (I used fresh instead of frozen green beans and sauteed the veggies a bit longer than the recipe called for.)
