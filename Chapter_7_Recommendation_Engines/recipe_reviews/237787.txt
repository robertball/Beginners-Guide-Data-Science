I love to read recipes and adapted them to my taste and needs. This was a very good base. What I did: roasted the cauliflower with the garlic  and olive oil for 15 min at 425.  While that roasted, I browned the ground turkey then added the onion soup packet and about 1/2 cup of beef broth to moisten things. Put that in the bottom of a 9x11 dish, added frozen corn and green beans (what ever veggies you like will do) Salt and pepper. Then I took the roasted cauliflower  and Parmesan  Cheese and cream cheese and blended it in the food processor. Topped it onto the veggies and then topped that with some low fat cheddar cheese. Baked at 425 for 20 min, until cheese was melted and slightly browned. My family didn't realize there were no potatoes and you don't need the pasta!

I didn't add the pasta, but used a mixed bag of frozen veggies with peas, corn, and green beans. Very savory, loved  the garlic with cauliflower mash! Also added some shredded cheddar to top before baked, awesome!..thanks

OK. So I doubled the recipe on this one. I tend to cook in bulk. 

I am a huge fan of anything really onions and garlic. My changes to this recipe included: using a little purple onion (left overs) and 1 small yellow onion and 4 cloves of garlic (sautéed) added to the cauliflower mix along with the parmesan and cream cheese. I threw in some butter and a sprinkle of Italian bread crumb mixture too! YUM!

Then for the turkey ground I pre-made some bouillon cube mix. 2 cubes to be exact. 

I then cooked the ground turkey. Drained and brought back to the pot and added in mixed veggies (green beans, carrots, and peas), I threw in the bouillon cube mix and then used a can of french onion fried crisps. It all squished together and came out beautifully. I also gave it a sprinkle of Lawry seasoning and pepper. Even though I know there is salt in the crisps. 

I then layered the cauliflower then meat mixture incorporating some left over (very small amount) of mozzarella and layered the Colby and Monterey jack sprinkles between the meat and cauliflower with the "mashed potatoes" on top and sprinkle of cheese over. 

Not sure how this really happened as I have never made it before but it smells amazing and Im excited to see what my husband thinks. *pray for us! *side note....it's delicious! EXCEPT.... the meat is kinda wet now so we are going to add another 20 minutes to firm up a bit in the oven. Same temperatures and everything. *drool.

I used this recipe and made a few ingredient adjustments, it came out perfect. It was so yummy and everyone loved it. I would certainly make this again with the cauliflower as a healthy alternative.

I really liked the cauliflower top.  But I thought the meat could use more seasoning, so added a couple of teaspoons of mediterranean spice mix. And added a bit of gravy mix / thickener to the broth in the mix. It really needed it. 
And, instead of the macaroni, I used more vegetables (zucchini).

Love love it. The only change I made was I added more cream cheese in the cauliflower. I used about 4 oz instead of one tablespoon. I also put it in a 8 X 8 pan. Was perfect. Better then the original.

This is SO GOOD!!!  The cauliflower topping is to die for, and I’ll be making that again and again just as a side dish. I sautéed the garlic just in some olive oil spray, to save calories, and it was fine. Also used frozen mixed veggies and increased that to 1 cup, because ½ cup didn’t seem like enough. The family is still swooning over this one!

This is a great recipe that you can tailor. I did not use cream cheese or cheese so it was dairy-free. I love this recipe and make it once a week sometimes using mashed potatoes and tonight I'm subbing ground venison for the turkey. The onion soup mix is such an easy way to add a ton of flavor if you don't have a lot of spices. I always triple or quadruple the amount of veggies in the base and often add spinach for extra fiber. This is one of the easiest recipes despite the prep work.

I thought it was delicious. I reduced H2O to 3/4c.and actually added about 1/2c.-3/4c. leftover Alfredo to the cauliflower in the food processor. For veggies I just used peas and carrots. I skipped the pasta. Next time I’ll double the cauliflower as it seemed like a fairly thin layer. I topped with cheddar because we love cheese! I will definitely make it again! Cheers and thank you for a new recipe!

The perfect recipe to make when you need to pull something together quickly with whatever random items you have in your fridge/freezer/pantry! 

I used frozen cauliflower, frozen vegetables/Trader Joe's barley + veggie pack instead of noodles and random spices instead of onion soup packet. II used goat cheese instead of parmesean and added a layer of shredded cheddar on top of the meat/veggies before the cauliflower. 

I used a 10oz bag of frozen cauliflower plus another half bag. While that steamed in the microwave. I browned turkey with garlic, onion powder, parsley, onion salt, pepper (eye ball it!). I drained the cauliflower in a collander. Blended cauliflower with cream cheese and goat cheese. On the stovetop I cooked a bag of frozen trader joes veggie/barley mix. Mixed it with the turkey. Layered that at the bottom of a 9x9 pan, layer of shredded cheese (to bind layers), layered cauliflower mash on top. Cooked for 20-25 minutes.  DELICIOUS!

i made the recipe as given except with a minor change.  I used frozen mixed vegetables with the turkey.  The cauliflower is creamier than mashed potatoes and the whole family ate it and said it was really good.  THEN I told them it was cauliflower.  Trickery works!!  Even my husband, who generally has an aversion to vegetables, liked it :)  Thank You!

Decided to make this on a whim.  Since most Onion soup mixes are MSG bombs, I had to forego that one. I added dried shallots, and a little extra garlic.  Be sure to season the turkey.  Without the MSG bomb, you may need to amp up the salt factor here.  I'd make it again. You should try it out

I chose this recipe because it incorporated mashed cauliflower. Instead of baking the recipe in the oven, I used a crockpot. I used venison and not ground turkey. I did not use the dry soup mix. I already had some homemade macaroni and cheese made so I used that instead of the whole wheat macaroni and the water. The mashed cauliflower portion tasted very good. Somebody thought it was mashed potatoes at first. I did use more than a half cup of peas.

This is a good lightened version.  I left out the pasta, as did several other reviewers. My husband has no idea the "potatoes" are actually cauliflower. Try it!

Made this with 98% lean ground beef and used 2 small potatoes to the cauliflower.  Instead of macaroni, I lined the bottom of the pan with some dry pot pie noodles and it made a great bottom for lifting out with a spatulad.

The recipe was a little hard to follow in my opinion.  I loved using cauliflower as mashed potatoes for the first time but other than that.. not very impressed.

I made this recipe for the first time and it turned out beautifully.  I didn't have any frozen peas so I substituted with a can of corn. A friend of mine doesn't like cooked cauliflower but really enjoyed the new twist on an old favorite. I will definitely make it again.

I had issues with this recipe. There was not enough liquid in the cauliflower mixture to blend in my blender, so I had to empty it and blend in two batches in a smaller chopper that I have. Lots of blender parts and bowls to wash after that! Perhaps it should have specified a food processor. I don't know if I had a small head of cauliflower or what, but there was barely enough to cover the turkey mixture - just a thin, skimpy layer. The turkey mixture also needed more liquid - turned out very dry after baking. I wondered if the cauliflower couldn't have been cooked in the microwave -- much simpler! Altogether, a frustrating experience.
