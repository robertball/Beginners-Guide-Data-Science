This recipe was exactly what I was looking for...easy and healthy.  I only had 1/2 cup of flax seeds, so I added 1/4 cup of sesame seeds and 1/4 cup of chia seeds, and they came out well.  The only problem is that they go stale within a couple of hours, but as Chef John mentions in the directions, they can be put back into the oven to re-crisp.

I hAbe made these twice now, and they have been a big hit both times!  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly, and they were delish—-crispy, mild,  and perfect for the dip I’d made. The second time I used spicy Mrs. Dash and caraway seeds instead of the original seasonings, and they added a whole different set of flavors!  Next time I want to try sesame seeds. There are so many ways to change this simple and healthy recipe!  I used it for friends with diabetes as well as those who are gluten free.

I let this sit in the fridge for 48 hrs instead of overnight. I think it made it less malleable. I also used parchment paper and it curled a little. I could still cut the pieces roughly into rectangles. I didn't have onion powder so I ground up dried onion. I'm still not sure about the taste. I will have to try the recipe again.

I just made these for the third time. I wasn't really paying attention to the recipe and bought roasted flaxseed  I used them and I think I like them better! They're great with Cabot Seriously Sharp Cheddar

These are great crackers, easy to make and super high in fibre! It easy to switch up the spices to your taste.
Don't use the dehydrator though, it doesn't work for these...we thought we'd save energy, but we spent more time & energy in the end!

I have made these twice now and getting ready to do a third batch, as these are now my non-guilty go to cracker. Who could not like them? Although I like them fine as is, I am going to add rosemary and sage this time around. As you get older, ya just can't eat what you could when you were younger and need to modify. This recipe is great for that! Thank you Chef John for your take on this recipe.

I have extremely dry eyes and was told by my eye doctor that flax seeds every day will help to re-hydrate them along with artificial tears. I have been taking 1 Tbsp daily mixed in yogurt. They don't have any taste, just a little crunchy. I was excited to make these so I will have an alternative way to eat flax. These are delicious! Thank you Chef John

I have a bag of Red Mill Golden Flax Seeds which I normally add to my homemade granola.  I decided to make these ridiculously simple crackers as I had never heard of Flackers nor have I made crackers before. I followed the instructions, no changes, adding my own blend of herbs and spices, and they are delicious.  I plan to make another batch adding chia seeds, but the flax seed alone are great. Next time, I will  try some different herbs.  Now,  how not to eat the whole bag ...

These turned out fantastic with an extra dash of soy sauce. Also, I left them in the oven for an extra hour at 200 to make sure they were nice and crunchy.

I was not done with my review. Initially we liked this recipe as presented. However the next time I did make some additional changes. I added more onion and garlic powder. Also added a little more salt. These are great for someone who’s avoiding wheat and other grains in crackers.

Thought I'd try these since they are obviously a healthy alternative but I didn't go for the taste.
