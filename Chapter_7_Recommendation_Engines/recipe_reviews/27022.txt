This was an amazing recipe! Extremely simple and tastes wonderful! I made it for my Halloween Party This year (2004) and everyone loved it! I would suggest though that instead of using Sugar Pumpkin you should use Cheese Pumpkin...The Flavor is a bit better that way...Sugar Pumpkin is more for baking cookies and cake while cheese pumpkin is more for soups and stews...

This was very easy to make and turned out nice and creamy. However the taste was very peculiar and the best part about it was the croutons!

This was a great hit at a 2002 Halloween Party - I'm taking it to the 2003 Party!! I have given the recipe to 3 people thus far and I'm sure the list will continue to grow.

I made it for a party and sampled it beforehand. It was so awful. I tried to season it but nothing I did would make it taste any better.

On one hand this was very easy to make. On the other hand it was kind of bland. Having read prior reviews I made sure to toast up some italian bread with oil and spices for dunking. YUM!

I found this soup to be much to bland.
