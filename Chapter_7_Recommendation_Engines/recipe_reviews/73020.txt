My favorite alternative to salad! :) But, I add cheese & bake these in the toaster oven. I drizzle the tomato halves w/ olive oil, sprinkle on some shredded cheese - then top w/ the seasonings called for. Bake at 300 for about 5 minutes.

The cooking method itself is definitely worth trying again, and this was a pretty addition to the plate. However, even tho' I cut way back on the herbs this still was a little overpowering for my taste. In the future I will either use fresh herbs, or cut back even further on the dried. I used red, ripe tomatoes, as the Roma were only pinkish in my market, and sliced them about 1/2" thick, which was just perfect for both heating and serving them.

These tomatoes were great! Although they got even better when I added Mozzarella Cheese. There was enough herbage for four tomatoes, even better. These were fabuloso!! Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner!!! Complements any dish.

This is a great idea, but I think the seasoning measurements are way off! This is a huge waste of basil and thyme. Cut down on these spices by a lot! I think the tablespoons might have been teaspoons in the original recipe. Also, we felt like this really lacked salt. We ended up adding a lot afterwards. Additionally, cooking them over medium-low heat was pointless. We think that if they were seered over very high heat or perhaps cooked on a grill, they would have been much better.

i thought these were great and i sliced my tomatoes in abt. 1/4" slices.  i also added 1/2 tsp onion powder.  be careful to keep an eye on them while they cook--i got busy and forgot them--and accidently stewed the majority of them which tastes pretty foul.  also, there is a LOT of paste, so either dbl. the number of tomatoes or cut the ingredients for the paste part of the recipe by half.

This is a tasty dish.  This is my second time preparing this tasty dish.  In my first review, I suggested to reduce the amount of basil and thyme by half.  Instead of white pepper, I used black pepper.  I used cherry tomatoes instead of plum or Roma tomatoes and I dipped them in the basil and thyme mixture before frying them in a wok in olive oil.  It turned out great!  I accompanied this pleasant side-dish with Dijon mashed potatoes, pork in mushroom Dijon sauce and Cajun deviled eggs, which contain lots of Dijon.  Great combination!  Great meal!

These were good.  I used italian seasoning because I had it in the cupboard.  Try to spread the paste thinly on the tomato, or it is a little pungent.  I did put mozzerella on and it was good.

I made these several times in the past 2 weeks. I used smallish roma tomatoes, seeded and left to drain on a paper towel, since another review warned they could be over-moist and I hate the seeds anyways. I initially halved the recipe, but had enough for 4 roma tomatoes. They smell beautiflu when cooking and the taste of all the herbs is not as strong as it my seem. A great, very easy way to add veggies to my breakfast.

I'm rating this in the mid-range mostly because I used the idea of the recipe, rather than following the recipe closely, after reading other comments questioning the proportions. I did like what I did, though, and it didn't really seem different enough to merit posting as a completely separate recipe, so here it is 1. I cut 5 roma tomatoes in half along the narrow side and put them on the toaster oven pan. I also preheated the toaster oven to its highest temp. 2. I sprinkled the tomatoes with coarse sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, and a little garlic powder. 3. I topped each tomato half with a fresh basil leaf, then sprayed a light mist of olive oil over everything. 4. I broiled the tomatoes just long enough for them to bubble a bit and look a little foamy, then took them out and served immediately.  They were quite good this way! Thank you for the idea, Little Oregon Girl!

Thes were very good after I added mozzarella cheese to them. Even though we enjoyed them, I can only give this recipe 3 stars because the ingredient amounts are so far off the mark. The spice "paste" is not what I would call paste consistency and there was so much of it left over! This was such a waste of perfectly good spices. I also put mine in the oven since I added the cheese. I always try to rate recipes based on the original writing, but the cheese was a must have and wouldn't have changed the fact that there was so much spice mixture left over. Several people have commented on this. I think this would be a fabulous recipe if it was re-written with the correct proportions and started off as a base recipe for at least a serving for six, not two. I will be making these again, but with alot of adjustments.

I think there were too many herbs for the amount of oil. My tomatoes also came out a little too runny, but that was probably my own fault for leaving them in too long. It's a delicate balance!

as directed, the herbs were too gritty.  I sliced the tomatoes, sauteed all the ingredients in a skillet and it came out much better.

The amounts of herbs called for is way too much.  These were pretty good, would choose to bake them in the oven at a low temp for a longer period of time.

I wanted to cut down on the calories for these and was out of basil, so I used just a tablespoon of olive oil and added water, and used about 2 tbs. of  seasoning from dry italian dressing packet as well as thyme and oregano. I fried them in cooking spray instead of olive oil and these were absolutely delicious!

I used this recipe as a guide and halved some on the vine tomatoes and just sprinkled them with basil, thyme, salt and white pepper.  I didn’t measure and I know I didn’t use nearly the amounts listed in the recipe.  I baked mine at 350 for 10 minutes and then topped them with some shredded mozzarella and broiled them until the mozzarella started to brown.  A nice recipe, but  only if you adjust the measurements.

First off, the picture matched with this recipe is wrong.  The recipe doesn't call for cheese.  It would be nice to have a picture that showed what this is really supposed to look like.  :-)

I changed this recipe because I had pesto on hand that needed to be used up, and the topping in the recipe sounded a little like pesto.  It was pretty good.  Next time I will salt the tomato halves first, because the pesto was just a little lacking in that.

If you use tomatoes larger than Romas, you either need to increase the cooking time or slice the tomatoes instead of halving them, as another reviewer recommended.

I added fresh mozzarella cheese on top, it added a nice taste to it. But it seemed like the tomatoes should have cooked a little longer, they tasted very fresh and didn't have that cooked zest to them.

Far too much spread for the tomatoes. They were uneatable. Would recommend just lightly sprinkling on the spices so as to not over stimulate the consumer.

I really didn't like this at all. I followed the recipe exactly. The tomatoes tasted muddy and gritty.  There must be some way to make this taste better but I don't want to find out.

I love this!  I'm not usually a tomato fan (but love tomato based foods).  This was great.  I added a little parmesan to the italian seasonings.  Excellent!

Simple but lovely. I sliced the tomatoes, arranged on a plate, spiced and drizzled, flipped into the skillet, cooked, and then flipped back onto the oil–spice plate. I overcooked a bit and wouldn't use coarse salt again, but good stuff.

This is GREAT!  Being an avid gardener and having an over-abundance of tomatoes, this recipe is exactly what I was looking for.  It's easy to prepare, there's no mess, and, it's delicious!  So delicious...I gathered up two more tomatoes after cooking the first two and made a second helping! :)

LOVE IT! :)

These were not good at all. I found the seasonings were way too overpowering and I found myself unable to eat them. It's a shame too, I was really looking forward to these.

I wanted to love this but didn't - the herbs were too herby (strong) for us, and a ton of it fell off when frying.  Giving it 4 stars though - if you love basil and thyme, then you will love this one (it's just not our thing).  Also took a few off the pan and threw them under the broiler with some cheese - that was a nice topping.

I have always disliked tomatoes, but as I get older, my tastes seem to be changing, so I decided to give this recipe a try.  However, as written didn't really work out for me, and I ended up experimenting with it a little.  I think it is a good basic recipe to play around with.  Definitely to much thyme for me.

Wonderful! I agree that the proportions are a bit off, though. I halved the amount of herbs used, and added a bit of cheese as other reviewers suggested.

Great even the kids liked it.  My husband said "it was like eating a little pesto pizza",  next time I will use fresh herbs! Definitely a keeper.

I switched oregano for the thyme and found it to be much better.  In general, I use less of all the spices so as not to overwhelm the tomatoes.  Very tasty!

Sorry, I followed the directions exactly but felt the tomatoes lacked something.  I made double the recipe, but since we didn't eat them all, I cut the leftovers up into a salad the next day.

Such a quick, simple and easy way of eating tomatoes and much more interesting than just eating them cold in salads!

Didn't turn out like I had hoped - tomatoes were mushy and not very flavorful.
