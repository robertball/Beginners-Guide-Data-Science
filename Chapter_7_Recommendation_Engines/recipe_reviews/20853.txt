This is a very good and easy recipe for baked beans! I love how you can just throw everything into the slow cooker and not fuss with soaking or boiling anything! I used 3 bacon slices instead of the pork, because I didn't have any, and they turned out very well. I think I will try using white beans next time I make this recipe.

These are really good baked beans. I doubled the recipe and made for July 4th. The recipe is improved by soaking the beans overnight. I also added a few dashes of Tabasco, but that would just be for personal taste. I'll make these again and again!

I did these beans for the family picnic. Usually I used canned baked beans but the price has gone up quite a bit. So I dragged out my white beans followed the recipe adjusted for 20 servings. I cooked the beans low and slow over night adding some liquid smoke, then adding the rest of the ingredients later as directed. At first I though they would be too sweet, but the dinner wasn't for three more hours, so the beans simmered real slow till the end. They were just right. I will definitely use this recipe for baked beans. They cost a fraction of the ones I used canned ing. with and tasted much better.

This recipe was amazing! my family loved it and so did I, it was easy, ive never made baked beans before and it turned out better than i could have imagined. I made 15 servings, and poured more water in and rounded up on the ingredients, i also put my slow cooker on high for 6 1/2 hrs. this is a treasured recipe now, my husband said it smelled like his grandmothers house when he came home from work, and that is a complement since no one compares to grandma! Thanks for the wonderful recipe, i wouldnt change a thing!

I added to the recipe, liquid smoke, garlic (3cloves) and worchester sauce, and I wish I had used less sugar. I also cooked my onions, and my bacon a bit before adding it because I think it adds a lot of flavor. I also soaked my beans, then boiled them on the stove top for about an hour, this way you can skim off the foam at the top, which makes the bean release their gas. :) Overall very yummy.

Good basic recipe for beans, but I do not enjoy kidney beans cooked this way... I always use pea beans or yellow eye beans.  It is important that you do not put the molasses and brown sugar in at the beginning of the cooking... they must be cooked or at least soft before adding any type of sugar because the sugar toughens the outside casing or hull of the beans.  The time that the beans cooks before adding the rest of the ingredients acts as the parboil or soaking that we do with beans when we don't use the slow cooker.  Good recipe, but we don't like ketchup in our beans.

These were amazing! Soaked the beans overnight and reduced water to 3 cups when cooking. Also added shredded barbequed chicken during last hour of cooking. Made a complete and very tasty meal!!!!

loved this recipie, they turned out great, I, however, had to cook them 5 hrs longer than the recipie said to. The beans were actually hard when I tried them at first. But when they were done they were terrific. I will soak over night next time ,but do everything else the same.

This was a great recipe for me, since I have never tried baked beans from scratch before.  I used pinto beans, and they were almost overdone - but I had done a little pre-soak to them.  I agree with other reviewers that they are a little bland as written.  After tasting it, I added a little white vinegar and spicy mustard to the sauce, and that helped.  I took the recommendation of others and eased up on the sugar too.

Really yummy!  I got a deal on chicken hot dogs for $1.50 a pkg so I added 4 dogs, chopped up, instead of salt pork or bacon and added extra salt.  Kids LOVED it.  Will make again with bacon and/or salt port - whatever's on sale.

Sorry.  This didn't work for me.  I actually soaked the beans for 12 hours before starting the recipe.  After 2 days of cooking, the beans were still not done to our satisfaction!  The flavor was ok, but I like my beans 'cooked' not 3/4 done.  I have tried beans in the crockpot before and I have always found this to be the case.  There is nothing like slow simmering on top of the stove to make a good pot of beans.  Didn't change the recipe except to add some liquid smoke.

I make a similar dish (my moms) and it has Always been a hit and requested often. I use kidney beans as well as brown beans but I also add onion and hamburg.  I use yellow mustard instead of dry and No molasses.  I have never used cured pork and dont imagine I will try it. ??

As usual, I changed this recipe up a little bit. I doubled the recipe & used bacon instead of cured pork. I also soaked the beans beforehand. Because of this, I only needed six cups of water when I put it all in the slow cooker (3 cups if the recipe wasn't doubled). I like my beans a little sweeter, so I added 4 more tbsp of brown sugar to my doubled recipe. Very tasty!

Not sure what is wrong with this, but it doesn't work.  Maybe it's the Kidney Beans... not used to those in homemade beans.  Wouldn't make again.

SAFETY ALERT:
Dried beans, especially kidney beans, MUST BE BOILED for at least half an hour before tasting. Dried beans naturally contain a poisonous substance (phytohemagglutinin) that is neutralized by a long boil. Getting them "hot but not quite boiling" can actually increase the poison instead of neutralizing it, and there are some slow cookers that never quite reach boiling, especially on the low setting.

---

Please don't send your family or your guests for a surprise hospital visit; make sure to boil your beans.

I don't like canned baked beans so I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for that (I mean really, how is it a recipe if the main ingredient is canned baked beans?). I made these for a family party and everyone RAVED about them. They were gone in a flash! I added a little liquid smoke, Worchestershire Suace, and Cholula. I also used bacon instead of cured pork (what is that anyway?) and cut the salt by half.

I liked it, I think it could use a little more spice though.

This was good - but I should have cooked the beans longer - they were still too firm after all that cooking!I added BBQ sauce to this and since I had some fresh salsa in the fridge I threw it in too.

We really liked this recipe.  The only item we didn't add was the pork.  Thanks for recipe!

Excellent!  I used leftover ham skin for the pork, but otherwise made the recipe as specified. We loved the flavor.

These were good beans as is, but for my own personal tastes I'd like to doctor them up a bit with some more spices next time... I used great northern beans and my leftover Christmas ham.  My crockpot doesn't have a tight seal so I ended up adding about 3 cups more water so they wouldn't dry out... I also started them out on high for 2 hours then lowered the setting for 3 hours more.  Thickened with some cornstarch/water.  Thanks!
