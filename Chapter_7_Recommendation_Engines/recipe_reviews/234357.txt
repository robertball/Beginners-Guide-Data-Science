My husband and I both really liked this and deemed it "A Repeat." I will say it is very weird to mix these ingredients--even looks weird when done--but it tastes delicious. It's even better left over (I ate it at work for several days). We had it as a dish by itself with no rice. I wouldn't change anything about this recipe. Very tasty, thank you!!

Wanted to get a Cuban Chicken recipe with Mojo, but I didn't have time to do the marinade.  What I liked about this dish is the quick preparation time.  

Made some changes to the recipe, first I used frozen chicken tenders instead of the canned chicken  My second change was to add some tomato paste in addition to the diced tomatoes is listen in the recipe.  

Excellent flavor, I am really enjoying Cuban dishes. .

Wow what an interesting mix of flavors that work amazingly well. I had everything at the house and thought I would try it. Could not imagine that it would work so I made it for lunch with a back up for dinner. Will make this over and over again. I followed the recipe except I used two uncooked chicken breasts (cooked the with the onions) and added two cups of chicken broth and 1 cup brow rice. I cooked it over med-low for around 2 hours once the rice was cooked.

OMG...this was the B.O.M.B ... I did deviate a lil bit from the original recipe... Here's what I did... I started by BOILING some boneless, skinless chicken thighs, (6 thighs). Then  I followed the beginning of the recipe with the onions and garlic..(.i sprinkled very little salt and pepper to the onions and garlic) because I was using real chicken thighs.  I cut a 1 whole red pepper, 1/2 cup olives, with pimento, and 1 1/2 box of raisins. I put 1/2 tsp cumin seeds and the original amount of oregano, with 2 bay leaves.  I put it all in the skillet and added 1/4 tsp ginger paste and 3 tablespoons of tomato paste. I added the diced tomatoes and then let it cook about 10 min. I removed the bay leaves and then...

Then I added the boneless, skinless thighs, 2 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of rice and let that cook for 20 min. It was SUPERB!!! My home smelled like I was in another country. When the dish was done I topped it with a small sprinkle of cheese and a dash of tabasco sauce ( I like spicy) and the family went crazy. I can tell this is a keeper dish. EASY to make, flavorful and it will definitely taste better tomorrow. The downside is that I can tell I did not make enough. 

Thank you for this dish...

Made this tonight and everybody loved it.  The complexity of the flavors was a big hit.  I served this over a bed of wilted baby spinach (gotta watch those carbs) and loved the combination of flavors.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was delicious! I had kalamata olives, so I used them, and it was still good. I did make the rice separately. I ended up adding some chicken broth to the recipe because I had used less canned tomatoes.

This recipe EXPLODED with flavor.  I did add 2/3 cup diced mango, and 1/4 cup honey, as well as substituting kalamata olives (whole-pitted) for the green olives, as  this was more like a dish I have had a number of times in Havana.  Highly recommended.  :)

I made this tonight. Although my husband is not a fan of green olives, he loved it!  I will make it again.  This would be a good dish for a pot-luck supper.

Delicious! Quite an array of flavor! The only change I made was I used rotisserie chicken rather than canned chicken. Yummy and few calories!

Delicious! I didn't have raisins, but it tasted great. Will definitely be making this again. I had fire - roasted tomatoes and they really added to the flavor.I'm glad I found this recipe.

Ok. This is effing delicious!
I made a few changes, chicken breast instead of canned chicken, some mojo seasoning in with everything. Red wine instead of vinegar and an extra can of tomato sauce to make up some extra sauce since I put three giant breasts in. I made mine in the crockpot with rice. 
Just make this recipe. It is even better the next day. I am eating it for breakfast.

Both my husband and I really liked this recipe.  Like other reviewers said we thought this combination of ingredients sounded "unusual" and we were not sure how they could come together.  We were very pleasantly surprised by the delicious variety of flavors.  I did use grilled chicken and added wilted spinach to our servings (I always want some green).  This will definitely be on our favorites list!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe that takes us out of our "box" of ingredient combinations!

What an amazing combination of ingredients. They all make this dish so perfectly delicious. It was easy to make, also. I had pomegranate infused red wine vinegar and it really did add something to the dish. We served with Jasmine rice.  I will be making this often. Thank you!

This was a delicious and easy dish to make. The only change I made was dried cranberries instead of raisins. I do not like olives but they really complimented this version of Cuban chicken - will be making this again!!

I love this recipe... The only thing I do differently is grill a couple chicken breast and cut it up to put in just before serving... so it stays tender... I also used a few Jalapeno Olives because I ran out of the other... and that was great too! I love the sweet and salty flavor. Thanks for sharing this recipe....

this was a last minute dish so I used what I had. Chicken breast, browned first. Then, I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar. Also, my husband opened tomato sauce instead. So, I cut up tomatoes and added it to the sauce. Next time, I'll add more queen olives, more raisins and more pepper and onions, but we cleaned the plates. I am pretty certain it will taste better tomorrow. Thanks.
Today is the day after. Yup, it's even better. Thissuns a keeper.

This turned out very good. The ingredients seem strange together but it was awesome. Next time I make it I will add something to give it a little kick. My husband enjoyed it also so this is something I will make again.

I did fresh chicken breast instead of canned. I re-hydrated the raisins by letting them sit in hot water for an hour. The olives and raisins say Cuban all the way.

It is a quick and easy recipe. I made almost exact, except I only had green pepper instead of red. Otherwise, exact. I wouldn't go out of my way to make this again but I usually try new recipes a few times. My next batch I will use 1/2 of the oregano amount.

Excellent recipe. I didn’t have a can of diced tomatoes on hand so I used a combination of chopped fresh tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes and a couple of tablespoons of mild salsa. Not being a big rice fan, I served it over some mashed, baked sweet potatoes I had left over. I put a small dollop of Greek yogurt on top and it was awesome. Great recipe, thank you for sharing it. It’s definitely one of my keepers. The green olives and raisins put it over the top in flavor and interest.

Really delicious despite unique and somewhat unusual ingredients. Raisins add a touch of sweetness and olives a bit of crunch. I didn’t have green olives so I used black and I substituted shishedo peppers which were growing in my garden for the bell pepper. I had left over corn on the cob which added a nice richness.

Just had this tonight for supper and it was incredibly delicious! 
People, do not fear those raisins!   Seriously, they meld perfectly with the other ingredients & spices.
I served this over hot, buttered rice with grilled garlic bread on the side.
I did make the following changes/ modifications to the recipe but they are small changes, so the original intended flavor is still present...
Starting with the chicken, I used cut-up boneless, skinless thighs which I marinated for several hours in balsamic vinaigrette dressing, and then placed in a wire  basket to quickly cook atop the grill.  As the chicken was cooking I also fire roasted several small tomatoes; which were coarsely chopped when cooled.  
I did not have any green olives on hand so kalamata olives were used instead. 
Finally, I added homemade Sazon seasoning and a very small amount of adobo (at the recommendation of another reviewer).
You know when the food is so crazy-good that no one talks because everybody is just so honed in on their meal?  This was our experience tonight, thanks to this incredible recipe!
Very much looking forward to tomorrow's leftovers! :-p
Thank you to @MJodyH for sharing this delicious dish!

No judgment but I just can’t bring myself to buy canned chicken... I used some chicken that I cooked in the slow cooker instead, and went a little light on the olives, although next time I will do the full amount. (And there WILL be a next time!) I cooked the rice right in the same pot as suggested to infuse it with more flavor. This was such an easy dish to prepare and very tasty! Thanks for this simple but excellent recipe, it is a keeper!

I was a little hesitant but wanted to try something different! This was quick and easy. Very different but the flavors came together so well.

This is the best recipe and we HATE canned chicken, but here we love it.  You do not even realize you’re eating canned chicken.  Thank you to the creator of this recipe.  Quick, simple and tasty!

I was skeptical of the ingredients together (as others suggested) but the end result was excellent, especially considering how easy this is to prepare.  I subbed black olives as that was what I had on hand.  Served over jasmine rice.

I expect the leftovers to get even better as the flavors meld together after a few days in the fridge. 

I woudn't put this into my regular rotation,since I have so many other favorites, but if you have chicken and are at a loss what to make, this is a good choice.  Most cooks will have all the ingredients on hand.

There I was staring at a can of chicken not having an idea what to do with it. Allrecipies to the rescue. This dish is sensational. My first taste of it was well balanced flavors bouncing out, one after another. Thanks MJodyH for sharing this one.

I have made this several times. My husband and I love it. I make it according to the original recipe, even the canned chicken! I thought canned chicken sounded gross, but it was good and very nice to have on hand in a pinch. The combination of raisins and olives gave this recipe many levels of flavor.

I have never made or tasted something like this before and both my SO and I enjoyed it very much! Pretty much stuck to the recipe except maybe I left it boiling for >30min after seeing too much tomatoe juice went in while pouring the can. Will make this again!

Loved it! I had leftover chicken and lots of tomatoes in the garden and this seemed to be the perfect recipe to try.  It went together so quickly. The raisins are a delightful taste in your mouth with the other ingredients. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Rave reviews, everyone loved this resulting flavor combination. Looking forward to making again. I used unstuffed castelvetrano olives and the flavors worked out great.
