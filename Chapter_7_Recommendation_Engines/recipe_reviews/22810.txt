Sue, this sauce is amazing! However, I tend to follow other people's reviews and cut the butter down to 1 1/3 sticks. Also, AND I HOPE IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE YOU READ THIS... the amount of sugar in this recipe is off. Previously, when I went to store it, it would crystallize really bad in my fridge over time. I'm an engineer, so I figured I'd check it out. It turns out, when the liquid in this recipe is hot it can hold 3 cups of sugar (supersaturated solution). When it cools to the temperature of your fridge (about 40 F), sugar begins to precipitate out of the mixture and crystallize. You can heat it back up and stir and stir and it will dissolve again, but I calculated and tested, and the recipe is actually 1 cup over the maximum amount of sugar allowable by chemistry. If you don't want to have to reheat it for so long to get rid of the sugar crystals, cut the recipe down to 2 c sugar. It's still plenty sweet and the consistency isn't effected. AWESOME recipe though!

ok, I have finally found a hot fudge recipe that I am going to keep.  I did change a few things, though.  I did not add any vanilla.  I added about 6 ounces and unsweetened baking chocolate, I thought after tasting it that it tasted like chocolate SAUCE not FUDGE, so that's why I added the extra chocolate.  I also added almost a teaspoon of salt.  It helped to cut down on the VERY sugary taste.  I did not have to put the mixture into a blender, it was prefectly smooth by just whisking it, it also keeps very well in the fridge and reheats perfectly.  oh I forgot to add, it DOES NOT taste like carmel, the people that say that MUST be using sweetened condensed milk, not evaporated milk.  Oh, and it was just a tad bit thin at first, then once it cooled it was perfect.

I love to make hot fudge and have used various recipes; some call for sweetened condensed milk, others call for sugar and evaporated milk, some with cocoa, others with choc chips.  I decided to give this one a try after just not finding one quite thick enough or creamy enough.  This was perfect.  The consistency was excellent. I have made it numerous times now.  I have upped the cocoa to almost 1/2 cup to prevent the caramel taste and give it a richer chocolate taste.  I have also (after reading some reviews) added in a handful of semisweet choc chips.  A tip to save on dishes and time is to use a hand blender while boiling on the stove instead of using a blender after cooking. I'm keeping this recipe and will be giving this out for Christmas gifts this year.

Another tip to follow up...

We discovered that if you use only 1-1/3 cup of butter, it is slightly less thick and has less of a carmelized consistency and more like fudge rather than caramel. Also, for the left-over sauce, it is not grainy and does not crystalize. Try it!

Totally to LIVE FOR!!!!  I don't rate many recipes 5 stars, but this deserves MORE!  This was so easy to make.  The only thing I did was to halve the recipe.  My only caution would be if you have a blender that is made of plastic instead of glass and pouring in the hot liquid.  I had a glass blender and had no problems.  If you LOVE chocolate you need to try this one!  This would be great with fruit or fondue.  This is FANTASTIC just eating off the spoon when slightly cooled or even COLD the next day!!  I served with buttermilk pound cake II recipe.

Five stars with these adjustments: Used only 1/2 cup of butter, only 2 cups of sugar, and increased the cocoa powder to about 1/2 cup.  It did not crystallize in the fridge with this method.  So much better than any hot fudge I've found in a store!

Ohhhh yum.  This was a PERFECT ending to a HORRIBLE day!  Even though when I was making it, it boiled over the pot all over my stove, which indeed was my fault, because against my better judgement I opted to use the smaller pot and of coarse the obvious happened (I'm having a really bad day) the end result of this was worth every bit!  THANK YOU Lisa, this was the best part of my day, my P.J.s, A bowl of Breyers vanilla with your hot fudge sauce...and a nice cold beer!!

Fabulous!!!!!!!!!!!  Make sure to blend the sauce-I have done it both ways-trying a shortcut once of not blending.  The blending makes for the richest, smoothest sauce.  I like to serve this over fudge brownies for brownie sundaes-yum!

I made this last year for Christmas gifts and I already have them asking for this again this year.  Starting making batches last night.  I double the recipe and it almost makes 5 pints.  In a double batch I use 1.5 cups of the Cocoa, 1Tbs vanilla and boil for 9-10 minutes.  This gives a rich dark chocolate flavor.  If you like milk chocolate then use a little less.  Blending is the key as the cocoa will be grainy out of the pan.  Blend it for at least a few minutes or until it becomes think and strains your blender.  Also when reheating I use a measuring cup with water and put the hot fudge in the water or you can use a single serving in the microwave.  This keeps the hot fudge from crystalizing.

OMG!!! This is absolutely the best hot fudge sauce ever! I made only half the recipe but used the same 1/3 cup of cocoa. I also whisked the ingredients while it was cooking on the stove top and let it boil for 10 minutes. I still blended it even after whisking  and it was still quite "runny" looking, but as soon as it cooled a bit it started to thicken up. Not grainy at all, perfect chocolate taste and for those who said it tasted like caramel, that's cause you probably used condensed milk.
I'll be making this from now on to put on my ice cream!

This is a really good homemade sauce, although I too wish it were thicker when warm; I might try cooking it longer next time to see if it gets thicker.  For an extra rich gourmet touch, I added about 1/2 Tablespoon of Folgers instant coffee crystals before boiling.  Pretty tasty!

ABsolutely Delicious!! I went to Costco and bought a plain cheesecake just so I could make this to serve over it.  Sooo good.  I love chocolate and this tastes like I purchased it at a gourmet store.  I too used my hand mixer instead of my blender. Do make sure to use a large pan so the mixture doesn't boil over. For those who find this too runny..try using only 1 stick of butter. Thanks Lisa.

My kids are always disappointed when we run out of this quick and easy topping.  For a more fudgy flavor I double the cocoa to 2/3c, and reduce the sugar to 2 1/2c.  Also, to minimize crystallization that some people complain about, I add 1T corn syrup.  For simplicity, I continuously whisk the mixture while boiling instead of using a blender.  With the corn syrup added, this keeps fine for quite some time in the refrigerator without growing sugar crystals.

What a great recipe! My family enjoyed this tonight with our vanilla ice cream. I can't wait to try it with a brownie or warm chocolate chip cookie and ice cream next time. This recipe makes a decent amount. I like the gift idea. The World Martket sells great glass jars which I will buy and pour this fudge into for gifts. I am so glad I tried it. UPDATE: I wanted a richer chocolate taste and texture, so I reheated the fudge sauce the following day and I added a good 1/2 cup of additional cocoa powder and now I think this is a perfect fudge sauce that we enjoy and that I would love to share with others. Check out my blog to compare the before and after photos of this fudge sauce.

great sauce using ingredients that are usually in the pantry.  This makes a very large batch.  It keeps well in the fridge.

This is one of the best hot fudge sauces that I've ever made. I followed the directions exactly, using a quality pure vanilla extract. I drizzled this over homemade greek vanilla frozen yogurt--the boys went nuts for it.

What a super recipe.  After several attempts, I've decided it works best to mix the cocoa and sugar together before adding the other ingredients.  I also use instant coffee crystals, but I mash them into a fine powder first.  Or I use a tablespoon of espresso.  Goes great with brownies, ice cream, cake, peanut butter, fruit, etc.

If you don't want to get out the blender, just beat with your hand mixer for a minute or two. Just make sure your pot is deep enough to prevent splatters.

Ohh. Emm. Gee!My husband has a serious sweet tooth, and I normally make hot fudge with sweetened condensed milk and some type of baking chocolate or chocolate chips, but didn't have either. I had plenty of evaporated milk and cocoa powder so I googled and found this recipe. I can not believe how delish it was!! We had it on ice cream and then I put it in a container to keep in the fridge and there was a little bit too much sauce to fit in the container, so I ate it. It tasted like melted, warm brownie batter. I did only use 2 cups of sugar and 1 stick of butter (rather than 3 cups and 2 sticks), and I thought it tasted sweet enough. The 3 cups and 1 cup scared me!! lol. I let it boil for awhile (by accident actually, got sucked into Teen Mom), and it thickened really nicely. I didn't blend it because our 5 month old had just fallen asleep and I didn't want to wake her. Probably could have used the blending, but it was fine without it!!!! Thanks Lisa/Sue!

This was amazing!!  I made this for my friend who is a professional chef and her family who are very picky eaters.  They all raved about it!  I did make two changes.  I added a pinch of kosher salt, and I added 6 squares semi-sweet chocolate squares.  I used my immersion blender the whole time it was boiling and it turned out fantastic. I also cooked it for 10 minutes instead of 7.  I will make this again!

Fantastic recipe! I did not blend the sauce at the end but stood over the pot and stirred the entire time it was cooking. I used this sauce for weeks after it was made, and it was just as good every time! My family raved over it!

I love this hot fudge sauce.  It was so quick to make.  And, it tastes very similar to Sander's a favorite of mine. The ingredient list was also with items I always have in the home an added bonus. And, I found it refridgerates up real nicely, as it stays a velvety pouring consistency.  I have tried other hot fudge sauces with chocolate chips and heavy cream, and this one was much better in taste and texture. For ease I used a hand-emulsion blender for 3 minutes after the sauce was slightly cooled. Quick edit note:  This recipe makes quite a lot of sauce, over 4 cups.  I froze 3/4 of it and still had plenty for everyone I was serving. I might try to cut the recipe back some or can some of it. But, well worth making. Thanks Sue.

I ADORE this recipe!  Thanks for submitting.  I tweaked it thusly: I sifted all my dry ingredients together before adding to the butter-adding a little cornstarch (maybe 1-2 teaspoons) since some said it wasn't thick enough when hot.  That absolutely did the trick.  I added a pinch of salt-never make anything sweet without it.  I also took the suggestion and added just a pinch of instant coffee.  It really does make the chocolate taste MORE chocolaty...  Lastly-because I sifted the ingredients first (I think) it was quite smooth prior to blending but I have an immersion blender so I took that tip and used it and the sauce became even more silky.  It was PERFECT. Adjust the cocoa to taste-if you want it richer, add more.  If you want it more 'milk chocolate' this is fine.  The longer you boil it, the more 'fudgy' the taste.

I made Sue's Hot Fudge Sauce for my daughter's graduation party.  We had an ice cream sundae bar with all of the toppings and the 'homemade' hot fudge sauce was a huge hit with every age.  I kept it warm in a small crockpot throughout the party.  This sauce is thin when it is warm and thickens as it cools on the ice cream.  Excellent flavor, it's even good cold.  This recipe is a keeper!

I increased the cocoa to 1/2 c. after reading the reviews. When I made this, I handled it much the way I cook fudge- I stirred it until it came to a boil, and then I completely left it alone while it boiled. Once the 7 minutes were up, I let it cool for a bit, then used my hand mixer and mixed it for about 5 minutes on high, adding the vanilla towards the end. By that time, it was nice and thick and tasted amazing!

Very nice. Lowered sugar by 1/2 cup but may use all next time. Added 1/2 cup nonfat DRY milk before boiling to make it taste like Sanders Hot Fudge. May try more cocoa, but that's because I'm always experimenting :)

I really did not like this.  I made it exactly as directed.  It tasted kind of like burnt plastic.  It had to be the evaporated milk in it.  I've made a recipe using heavy cream and chopped chocolate and it tasted like hot fudge sauce should taste.

We have been making this for years...only fudge sauce allowed in our house.  I always add a dash of salt to bring out the chocolate flavor. If you sift the cocoa with the sugar before adding there will be no lumps, no need to run through a blender!

This was a great base for hot fudge sauce, but it was too sweet.  I upped the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup.  Next time I will make this with 1 1/4 cups of sugar and add 1 tsp. of instant espresso powder.  The addition of coffee intensifies the chocolate taste and adds depth of flavor. I didn't put the sauce into a blender, as I just whisked while cooking the sauce. I believe with the above changes, this could be a 5 star hot fudge sauce.  Thanks Sue for sharing.

First of all, if you don't actually make the recipe exactly as is you should not rate it at all. So many people added more cocoa, or changed something. That being said, this was way too sugary. Did not have much of a chocolate taste. I think this recipe would be awesome with more cocoa.

I cant help it, but I did not like this sauce. It tasted more like caramel then fudge. When it got cold, it was grany and I could taste the condensed milk. I am glad I did just half of the recipe. Sorry....

This is wonderful!  I used 1/2 cup of cocoa and boiled for 10 minutes.  It is very thick and smooth.  I think the blending is key.

Absolutely FABULOUS!

I didn't blend at the end....simply whisked throughout the boiling part.  It turned out smooth and perfect.  I served it over french vanilla ice cream at a dinner party. It made a simple dessert after a big meal, but looked great.  I had to print out copies for the guests, because everyone loved it!

I have tried other hot fudge recipes, but this one is by far the best!!!  I wasn't sure why you would need to put it in a blender, so I sampled some before blending & after.  Blending makes the sauce really creamy.

Not quite the hot fudge taste I was looking for. Was really smooth at first then after reheating 4 times it became grainy. It makes a huge amount.

Of course, a last minute decision to make this to give as gifts = only having 1/6 cup cocoa powder in the house while all stores in the city are closed. I added 6 oz semisweet chocolate chips to make up for that, and also added a teaspoon of instant coffee crystals, and a pinch of salt. While it was still warm I tried a bit on top of some sweet potato pie, and after it had cooled I tried another spoonful before putting it into jars. It was great, not too sweet, and I like that the coffee added a very slight burnt taste -- in a good way. [FYI, I despise coffee and coffee-flavored things, but adding a tiny bit to chocolate just enhances the chocolate flavor.] This was so easy to make, I don't think I'll be buying hot fudge sauce from the store ever again!

Ooooooooooh... the reviewer that said you could just eat this with a spoon was absolutely right. 4 stars because it definitely needed a bit of revision: like other reviewers, I added more chocolate (1.5 oz. of unsweetened Baker's chocolate) to deepen the color/flavor.  I also added a teaspoon of salt, which is IMPERATIVE.  I didn't add it until I tasted the sauce at the end and then realized I needed to put it in to bring out the chocolate.  I used light margarine in place of butter and would certainly do so again.  This sauce is lovely and rich, and I can't wait to have it over ice cream!

Delicious! Tastes just like the hot fudge sauce my mom makes. I halved the recipe but kept the 1/3 cup of cocoa powder. I also whisked throughout, so there was no need for a blender.

Fantastic.
I doubled the recipe for an ice cream social, and it was plenty.  I made the sauce, brought it to church in a crock pot and turned it on low.  The hot fudge stayed warm and smooth for the whole time (3 hours).
Don't worry if it's still grainy as you're making it, the blender will make it very smooth and creamy.  Also, my sauce was a lot darker than the lighter brown sauce in the main picture.

I got lots of compliments on this sauce! Thanks!

Really Good.  Wasn't Gritty at all as some reviewers said.  Just follow the directions and you shouldn't have that problem.  I did use evaporated milk, not condensed and I did still taste the carmel flavor that a lot of reviewers were commenting on, not sure what the fix of this would be. It still has a wonderful taste.

I made this when I ran out of hot fudge sauce.  This was better than the store bought kind! I would make again!! I didn't have any problems with it being grainy (blender is an important step) or too thin (boiled 10 minutes).  I love dark chocolate so I used 1 cup of cocoa as recommended by another reviewer.  Yum!

Per other reviews, I used a hand mixer (esspecially since my boyfriend has temporarily banned me from using a blender due to a soup puree accident) and it turned out great. I'm not one for fudge as it is normally too sweet but I am a sucker for a good hot fudge sundae and we all agreed this hit the spot! Like MC_MA_OF_3, this is the cure for any bad day  I will make this taste of heaven again! Thanks for posting this Lisa!

This has a wonderful consistency--even after being chilled! It wasn't as chocolately as I like though, so will be adding a bit more cocoa powder and a bit less sugar next time. Thanks!

Wow, this is good!!! It is very, very rich!!!! This recipe makes a ton, I wish I would have only made a 1/2 batch.  I used this over a hot fudge cake that I made in the crockpot and cooked a little too long and paired it with fresh frozen vanilla custard.  I made the recipe  just as it stated but next time I will probably cut the amount of sugar as it tends to be on the too sweet side.  A little bit definitely goes  a long way.

Wonderful sauce!  Note that you should not boil for less than the 7 minutes, starting the timer when it is already boiling.  Also do NOT skip the blender step.  My sauce when from easily pourable liquid to thick rich spreadable fudge in less than 2 minutes of blending.  I did the blending about 10 minutes after I took it off the heat.  I had good success reducing the sugar to 2 cups and will try reducing it even more next time.

Loved this recipe. The quantity that it yields makes it good for gift giving, I got three jars out of it. I didn't put it in the blender, but whisked until smooth. I don't think it made a big difference. I also stirred in about a cup of dark chocolate chips.
It reheated nicely with a few seconds in the microwave. It was a big hit with my company:)

This is a delicious bowl of wonderful goodness!  I did make a few changes to the recipe but only for my personal preference.  I don't like overly sweet things so I decreased the sugar to 2 cups per other reviews, doubled the cocoa and added a pinch of salt.  I had no problems with crystallization since I stirred it during the entire boiling process and didn't need to blend it after.  This is a great hot fudge sauce that you can adapt to your personal tastes and make it as sweet or as chocolately as you like.  Yum!

Was looking for a recipe that called for cocoa and found this one--so glad I did!  After reading the reviews, I did double the cocoa (2/3 cup) and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It came out nice and smooth and just the right thickness for our tastes.  It is, by far, the best hot fudge sauce I've ever tasted!  Just had some on banana/strawberry ice cream.....wow!  Since I just made it, I won't know about the crystallizing--if it lasts long enough! UPDATE: I stored the fudge in a covered glass jar in the fridge, heating only what we used each time--it has NOT crystallized at all! 2ND UPDATE: Made this again, this time using Nestle Special Dark Cocoa--if you like dark chocolate, you'll love this!

This is absolutely the BEST!  Just like my mother used to make. I could never find a recipe like hers since she died when I was 12 yrs. old.  So, thank you! It brought back beautiful memories!

Very smooth and delicious. I made a full batch for my small family and stored the extra in the fridge. When it started getting gritty, I heated it up and used my immersion blender to smooth it out. It was just as creamy as when I first made it.

Awesome sauce, tastes just like the sauce for the hot fudge sundae that I eat at a nearby restaurant.  I doubled the cocoa powder and stirred it with the sugar prior to cooking.  Also, it didnt specify whether to use salted or unsalted butter, so I used the regular salted butter and the taste was totally fine.  DONT BE FOOLED with how runny the sauce looks at first.  It will thicken while you use a blender and pour the sauce into a container (basically while its getting cooler).  Im making this as a christmas gift for a few friends, I cant wait to see their reaction to how great this tastes!!  Thank you for sharing such a simple but awesome tasting chocolate fudge!!  The only thing I wonder is how long does this keep in the fridge?

This fudge sauce was the best!!  Smooth and creamy and yummy.  I made it to go ontop of cheesecake for desert at a bridal shower.  It was a hit.  I used a whole cup of cocoa powder and kept everything else the same.  Much better than anything you can get in the store!  Thanks for the recipe!

This hot fudge is awesome! I will definitely keep the recipe around and make again. So easy and so very good. No caramel taste and not grainy at all. I also sift the cocoa before adding it.

I used one stick of margarine instead of the full cup and it was rich and delicious!  Our guests kept putting more and more on their ice cream and wanted the recipe.  Thanks!

This Hot fudge sauce is sooooo good!  I had no problems, perfectly smooth and thick.  I boiled it for 10 minutes and blended for 4.  If you are a real chocolate lover you could add a little more cocoa, but it fine for me just as is.

This makes delicious hot fudge sauce!  I was a little worried about the 3 cups of sugar; it seemed like so much.  However, the resulting sauce is like creamy, sweet fudge.  Extremely easy to make.

This sauce sets up and thickens nicely as it cools. After four hours in the refrigerator, it was the consistency of a professional hot fudge, with a great taste!Flavor is outstanding ...very fudgey. Thanks for sharing, Lisa.

This is a good chocolate sauce.  My only disappointment was also that it was way too thin while hot.  After a night in the fridge, however, it is just right.

I made this for Valentine's dessert and it is SO GOOD!  Closest to thing to intravenous chocolate.  Sifting the powdered cocoa with the sugar helps it blend better.

I doubled the cocoa, added a pinch of salt at the end, but otherwise made the recipe as written. I didn't need to put it in the blender, I just whisked it as it cooked. I've never made my own hot fudge sauce, and it was super easy and super delicious! It starts out thin when it's done, but let it cool slightly and it will get nice and thick. I had a jar full left over last night in the fridge and today there's only a quarter of a jar left thanks to my kiddos!

Just made this and even though I loved it - I only gave it four stars because of slight changes.  After reading reviews I added a pinch of salt, 1 oz. unsweetened chocolate, and less sugar (I used 2-1/4 c.).  Because my blender recently broke, I whisked during cooking as another reviewer stated -perfect texture!  Also, not sure it actually boiled the entire 7 minutes, but I didn't want it to burn!  Use EVAPORATED milk and it won't taste like caramel!  YUM!

I usually follow a recipe exactly at least once before I make any alterations, but btertin's scientific analysis impressed me so much that I followed his instructions and used 2 cups of sugar instead of 3, and only 1 and 1/3 sticks of butter. The sauce came out GREAT. Once it spent the night in the fridge and then was reheated, it was the perfect hot fudge consistency. I'll definitely be making this again.

Normally wouldn't rate five star if I made modifications but this recipe is THAT GOOD and should not be missed. Sue's Hot Fudge is FIVE STAR HOT FUDGE if modified per other reviewers: Cut sugar to 2c. Add a handful of semi-sweet chocolate (Ghiradelli or Nestle Chips). Literally EVERYONE who we served this to raved about the fudge and asked for the recipe - the ultimate compliment if you ask me! This fudge, and a spoon, could solve world peace. :)

Excellent hot fudge - I used it for the middle layer of an ice cream cake. Don't skip the final step to blend the sauce in a blender, it makes it super creamy.  I tried some of the sauce that was left in the pan while the rest of the sauce was blending away and though it tasted great the texture wasn't anywhere near as lovely as the final product from the blender.

I have made this three times.  I love how easy this is.  It gets thick, so just wait.  Once it cools down it starts to thicken.  I made it without blending and then tried it with blending just to compare and I'll always blend it now.  It makes it silky smooth.  I did have a problem with the sugar crystallizing.  I doesn't happen the first day or the second, but if I put it in the fridge then it starts.  I read how you're supposed to be able to stop it from happening and that is to make sure every crystal of sugar is melted and nothing is left on the side of the pot.  Use a spatula!  I'm also keeping it out of the fridge.  This does seem to help although I'm not sure how long it keeps like this.  But it doesn't last long in my house.  I think this would be great canned.

This was WAY too sweet.  I usually make fudge sauce with cream but used this recipe because I had evaporated milk on hand and no cream.  I would not make this again.  If you want real hot fudge sauce, use a recipe with real cream and a lot less sugar.

I'm glad I halved the recipe. It makes alot. It was easy to do but I was hoping for a richer chocolate taste. So I added a 1/2 ounce of bittersweet to the 1/2 recipe I was making. That seemed to help. But once this is taken of the burning it firms up pretty quick and then when I tried to reheat it was gritty and greasy.  I think I like a fudge sauce with corn syrup better, it helps to get the sauce more ooey-gooey and helps to keep it from being grainy.

I made this sauce when I was craving some serious hot fudge. I thought, from the reviews, that it would be great, but found it to be lacking the intense chocolate flavor I was wanting. I even added a bit more cocoa and a handful of choc chips, as suggested by others. It was good the first night, but did not reheat well- very grainy. Will look for a different recipe next time.

Absolutely delicious! I did change the recipe a bit according to previous suggestions- decrease sugar to 2 cups, add another 1/3 c cocoa powder and 1 tsp salt. I also sifted all dry ingredients several times so I didn't have to blend the sauce. It does taste like Sanders hot fudge sauce. Yummy! You should note that this sauce doesn't reheat up well. I made it the day before I needed it. It was very buttery and didn't blend well. Use the day the make it.

This was good still warm from the stovetop, but it had a grainy texture after it was refridgerated.  Maybe I cooked it too long?  I might try this again in a much smaller batch so I won't have to worry about storing it.

This was awesome!! If you like it thicker like I do, use half of the evaporated milk and complete with half and half cream. I didn't have to blend at all.  Delicious sauce!

I probably shouldn't review this since I made so many changes, but for those who want to make this non-dairy, here's how to do it. Use margarine instead of butter (1/2 c. is enough), soy milk instead of evaporated milk, and add 4 ounces of chocolate to make up for thinner consistency. Melt the margarine and chocolate, and then add the sugar and soy milk. Cook for ten minutes. I skipped the blending, but it was grainy once slightly cooled, so next time I'd blend it. This sauce is thick and delicious!

This was my first time making hot fudge sauce, and it is DELICIOUS! I added 1/2 cup of cocoa, instead of 1/3. I added 1/2 tsp. of instant coffee as well.  Boiled it for 7 minutes, and then blended it. PERFECT!

Just AMAZING, incredibly delicious.  I could nearly eat it with a spoon.  Okay, this is not the most rich chocolate flavored sauce you'll find.  It's more a cross between chocolate and caramel...a lighter chocolate.  But, who cares!  It is easy and delicious and NO CORN SYRUP.  Hooray for all that goodness!!!  Thanks Lisa for this amazing recipe.  You've added that much joy to my life!

I think I will follow the tip of using more cocoa. Mine tasted more like caramel, and I definitely used evaporated milk, not sweetened condensed.

Delicious but DANGEROUS! Made a huge amount - too much for the average blender.  A blender jar over-filled with boiling sugar-based sauce is a disaster in the making. Luckily my family thought this chocolate sauce was well worth the blistering burn I received while holding the lid on the blender. Seriously, use a very large saucepan & put a dish towel over the blender before turning it on. Makes a little over a quart.

This is the best Hot Fudge Sauce ever!!!  It makes plenty to use again and again.  It also freezes very well.  I got a million compliments.  We used it as a topping for Chantal's New York Cheesecake and ice cream for the kids.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was very easy to make.  That being said, I think it was way too rich (3 cups of sugar is crazy - scared me when I was making it!), the cocoa didn't quite dissolve (it didn't hurt the taste any, but looked like there were cocoa granules in it), and when I added it to ice cream it hardened and became sticky.  Now, I didn't add it to the ice cream right away when it was hot.  I added it later when it was just warm.  Although the taste was good, it made alot and just a tiny bit went a long way.  But, thank you for letting me try it!

This sauce was easy and delicious.  I have been trying to perfect my husband's grandmother's recipe for years with little success.  I know have "my" recipe to pass on.  It makes enough to share and keeps well in the fridge.

Sorry to disagree, but I did not find this very good.  It wasn't like any hot fudge sauce I've every had.  Too sweet, and had that strange caramel taste to it.

Good and simple to make.  Wasn't grainy at all, and very rich.  Mine got very thick after it was poured on ice cream though.  I keep a batch in a mason jar in the fridge and microwave it in the jar when we want some.

Sue deserves an A+ for this one.  I didn't put into a blender at the end.  Instead I used a wire whisk and stirred constantly.  It is one of the best hot fudge sauces I have ever had (and that is one big complement from a hot fudge sundae connoisseur).

If you have ever had the chocolate volcano at Don Pablo's, this is exactly like the fudge sauce they use.  It exceeded my expectations and was very simple.  I usually always bake with butter for better flavor.  Unfortunately, I did not have any on hand and I substituted with margarine.  I expected to taste the difference but it still turned out GREAT!!!!!!!!

Wow.  I've tried a number of hot fudge sauces and this one beats them all. The cocoa made it so easy!  Everyone commented on the smooth, velvety texture.  I purchased mason jars at the neighborhood hardware store, added a piece of holiday fabric under the lid, and gave to neighbors as a Christmas treat.

This recipe is wonderful, the only thing missing was a straw. I do not have a blender but was able to use my mixer with good results. I made this to give away at Christmas and everyone who was LUCKY enough to get a jar of this great sauce, loves it. So easy, so good. This recipe is a keeper.

This was so delicious.  I have to say that instead of it making 16 servings it is more like 2 because you will want to eat so much of this in one sitting.

Mmmmm...I doubled the batch and bottled some to give as Christmas gifts, but I don't know if they'll make it out the door. Rich and luscious. Reminds me of the Dove brand milk chocolate hot fudge sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

As I read some of the other reviews I decided to change the amount of cocoa to 1/2 cup.  It was absolutely perfect.  That being said, it might of been perfect with the 1/3 cup too. In the future it will be 1/2 cup for me.  YUMMY beyond belief.  My adult son said it tasted like something from a fine dinning restaurant.  I have to agree.

No offense to those who liked this, but to me it was  sickeningly sweet. I should have know anything I added 3 cups of sugar to would have been over the top in the sugar department. I’m 60 and have been cooking for 40+ years from scratch, 10 of those years had a catering business so I know good food. I love gourmet,  complicated recipes but needed a quick hot fudge recipe for homemade ice cream. I will say the texture of this sauce is good and I learned something from using a hand blender after boiling as other reviewers recommended.

I made it as posted the first time.  It was good, but I wanted to tweak it a bit.
I made it as follows:  
2/3 cup cocoa powder
2 Tbsp. cornstarch
2 cups sugar
1 1/3 stick of butter
2 Tbsp. agave syrup (you could also use light corn syrup)
12 oz. can evaporated milk 
1/2 tsp. salt
1 tsp. vanilla
I sifted the cocoa and cornstarch together.  Then mixed it with the sugar.
Put the butter, agave syrup and evaporated milk in the saucepan.  Then stirred in the cocoa mixture.
Stirring frequently over medium heat until it comes to a boil.
Boil for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
Remove from heat and stir in salt and vanilla.
Blend with an immersion blender for 2  minutes.
Pour into glass jar to cool.
Store in refrigerator.
With my couple of minor changes, this hot fudge sauce moved from good to excellent!
I'll make it "my way" again and NEVER buy hot fudge at the store again!

This was good, but not as thick as I wanted.  Still, I would make it again, though.  Good flavor and very versatile.  I will make again.  Only 4 stars because it is so thin-- almost like hersheys syrup.

This is a great chocolate sauce. BUT NOT HOT FUDGE. I even tried it with the suggestions of cutting back the sugar and adding bittersweet chocolate.  It was still just a chocolate sauce. Hot fudge has a very distinctive flavor and this is definately not it

I will never have to go out for a hot fudge sundae again! Better than I could have imagined. I didn't add the vanilla, but did add a pinch of salt.  I cut the recipe in half and had enough to fill a pint mason jar.  I don't own a blender, so I used my immersion stick in the pan I cooked it in. It was smooth and thick, perfect texture!

Loved it! Easy. Made this last night and I even altered it to make it dairy free using coconut milk and substituted raw sugar. 

I did only use 2 cups of sugar but did not change anything else, it was perfect consistency and today I checked to see how the consistency was and it is even better, beautiful, smooth and delicious!

Great sauce! I won't be changing anything. I thought the blender was overkill at first but not now. The recipe turned out ok, but nothing special until I put it through the blender.  So silky smooth and chocolatey.

I thought this was awesome chocolate sauce, but did not have the the consistency of hot fudge sauce at all. It turned out thick but not thick like fudge.  Taste was fabulous though.

WOW this is a great hot fudge recipe!  Infinitely better than anything you can buy at your local supermarket.  Not sure how people are getting a "caramel" taste to it or why it's too sweet... maybe some are accidentally using sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated milk?  I followed some suggestions from reviewers and used a little bit more butter (I think I put in 2.25 sticks) and upped the cocoa to 1/2 cup (we used Hershey's dark cocoa for our own taste preferences).  REALLY delicious and not to sweet, no caramel taste or texture in the least.  I will say that blending it is a really important step, even if it already seems pretty smooth.  I was in the middle of a class when I made it, so it accidentally cooled on the counter for 2+ hours before I blended it.  Putting it in the blender took it from still a bit thin to this perfect hot fudge consistency.  Can't explain how it works, but it does - make sure you don't skip that step.

We have made this several times now and it is a family favorite!  It is good just the way it is, but I like to cut the sugar to 2.5 cups, I also add a half teaspoon of salt.   AMAZING!!!  It is better, with real butter than margarine, but works either way. It is simply the best I have ever had and I am a picky eater!

Really good! Like some others, I added more cocoa (1/2 cup more). Just cuz I'm a chocoholic! I stuck with the rest of the recipe as is (didn't cut down on butter). For the 7 minutes of boiling, I whisked pretty frequently. Almost constantly. Not quite. Did not use a blender to add the vanilla. I don't have a blender. Used a hand mixer directly in the pan. It did seem kind of thin, as others reported, at the time. After it cooled, and I reheated (in microwave) the consistency was perfect! Will definitely be a go-to for hot fudge!

I halved the recipe to use up the evaporated milk I had left over from another recipe. There wasn't much of a chocolate taste so I increased the cocoa powder to the full 1/3 cup. Yum!

This is a great recipe, but has room for improvement. I've added 6 oz. of bitter sweet bakers chocolate to this mix and it made it a richer, thicker more chocolaty hot fudge that will now fill 3 pint size mason jars that is just sinfully good.

Very tasty; however, if you are looking for a thick fudge for ice cream, this isn't it.  It's more along the lines of a syrup.

Wow. Just wow. I was looking for a decadent bitter chocolate fudge sauce, and with a few tweaks, this was it. Super easy recipe- I read the reviews and followed tips. Here's what I did: I used 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter plus 2 TBS butter, 2 cups sugar, and 1/2 cup cocoa. Oh, and I added a couple pinches of salt. After it came to a boil (and you do need to use a large saucepan) I used my immersion blender and blended constantly, letting it go about 9 minutes. Finally, I pulled off small portions and added a bit of peppermint extract to one (about 1/8 tsp to 1/2 cup sauce) and instant coffee granules to another (maybe 1/2 tsp to 1/2 cup of sauce). We served it hot over vanilla ice cream and it was AMAZING. My husband, who doesn't really like sweets, couldn't stop licking the spoon. Makes a lot, too, so this is a great recipe to use for gifts. Thanks for the great recipe!

I really wanted to try the recipe as written, but I couldn't help putting in a little more cocoa powder, which I will continue to do. The chocolate flavor is perfect with 1/2 cup instead of 1/3 cup. I wasn't convinced that the sauce needed to be blended, so I blended half of it and then compared after the sauce had cooled for 10 minutes or so. It was much better blended, so I blended all of it. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it isn't as thick as I would like to it to be while it is warm. When it cools off it gets much thicker, but I want to serve it warm. I do love that there is no corn syrup in it. I'm going to try the chocolate chip and sweetened condensed version of hot fudge that is all over the internet, but I expect to come back to this one.

This recipe is terrific, with two small modifications.  I used one stick of butter rather than two, and I whisked the mixture with a piano whip constantly until it came to a boil, and about half the time during the seven minute boil. No need to dirty the blender.  'Best hot fudge sauce ever!

This is a great recipe with a few tweaks:  I used dark cocoa powder, which intensified the chocolate flavor; decreased the sugar to 2 c. to reduce the excessive sweet taste others described and used powdered sugar to eliminate the need to blend; and increased the vanilla to 2 teaspoons -- purely a preference.  I also didin't think it was thick enough at 7 mins so i boiled for 20 mins for a thicker, more fudge-like consistency.  Fabulous.

YUM!! I added another 1/3 cup cocoa it was a little weak without it. Blending it was key and so worth making it homemade! We made homemade vanilla ice cream to go with this fudgy sauce! Thanks for the recipe!

My new favorite!  I actually made a mistake which made this perfect for me - I cut the recipe in half but forgot to cut the cocoa in half.  It came out perfect!  Fudgey taste, not overly sweet, just right.  My old family recipe has been replaced, can't wait to have more!

Perfect! I halved the recipe. Made exactly one pint. I made this to pour over chocolate cake :) Delish!

This was great!  I halved it and used milk with a bit of cream instead of evaporated milk and it turned out yummy!

Easy and delicious - has that wonderful sugar butter cocoa flavor that reminds me of the hot fudge sauce once served at Brigham's!  It holds really well in the fridge, too!  (But it doesn't last very long - my family eats it up before I get the chance to have some.)

This is the second time I have made this WOW it is so good and I'm not really a chocolate fan... I didn't change any of the ingredients, the only thing I did different was I used my stick blender for the 7 minutes of boiling time. Thanks for the recipe

I don't understand. We did exactly what the recipe said and this didn't take anything like hot fudge. It was thin and it tasted a lot more like a caramel than a chocolate. Unfortunately, it wasn't good as I like caramel. We won't be making this again.

This was easy and made a LOT of sauce -- I made it for a large party (20+) and still had a lot left over. The reason for my "average" rating is that I didn't find the sauce to have a lot of depth -- I prefer a deep, dark chocolate flavor and felt this one was more sweet. I had added additional cocoa and some chocolate chips to try to add some depth, but think it could use some dark chocolate or coffee to make the flavor more complex. Good basic recipe, just not the total indulgence I'm looking for in hot fudge.

This is the first hot fudge sauce recipe I ever tried and it will be the last.  This sauce is sooooo good!  I did increase the cocoa to 1/2 a cup and added the handful of semi sweet chocolate chips as was suggested by another reviewer.  Homemade ice cream with hot fudge here we come!

WAY too sweet. I added salt (quite a bit) and 6 oz. unsweetened chocolate to make it more chocolatey, then 1/3 cup more cocoa to make it thicker. Still just o.k.

After reading the reviews, I also made some adjustments to this recipe. The consistency was good and it re-heated just fine. I still used the same amount of butter but only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar. I used the same amount of cocoa powder and added in 1/4 cup of milk chocolate chips. I only used 1/2 a can (a little over 6 oz.) of evaporated milk. I also added a pinch of kosher salt and stirred constantly; gentle boil on low-med heat with a whisk for the 7min. (instead of blending). After I removed it from the heat, I let it stand for about 1 min. and then added 2 tbsp of 35% cream.

Incredible!  It thickened slightly as it cooled, though it took a while.  I woudl suggest not servign it immediatly, make it an hour ahead and stick it in your crock pot on wam setting.  I made it for a scout court of honor to go over brownies an ice cream.  What a hit.  I made it just as the recipe specified, though I added the salt someone else had suggested.  Perfect!

I will never buy hot fudge sauce from the store again.   This is so easy and SOOOO good .... definitely the best when it's heated, though I've been known to eat a spoonful of it cold too.   I highly recommend using ultra fine bakers sugar for this recipe.  It dissolves more quickly and makes the fudge super smooth.   I get comments every time I serve it, and make up little jars of it to give as Christmas gifts.  Always a hit.

this was very easy to make, but the resulting sauce is VERY sweet...  the texture is nice, but i think i would follow the other reviewers suggestions next time and lower the sugar and increase the cocoa. if you can imagine melting actual fudge and pouring it over your ice cream, then this is the sauce for you.  i prefer a less sweet topping.

This is very good. I followed the advise of others and added about a tsp of salt. I was about 1/4 cup short on butter so after it boiled the 7 min I added about 3 TBSP peanut butter along with the tsp of vanilla. I didn't need to blend this. Definitely a keeper with or without the pb.

YUMMY!!!  I made this last night and had to leave my 5 stars!! I followed the recipe with the exception of increasing the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup as suggested by others and I also added about a teaspoon of expresso powder.  I set the timer once it came to a boil and boiled it exactly 7 minutes, stirring constantly.  I removed it from the burner after 7 mins and poured into the blender and set the time for 4 mins and turned on the blender.  ( I accidently added the vanilla with the other ingredients to the pan, instead of after I removed it from the heat, however it came out fine).  After blending 4 mins I poured it over Ice cream which was sitting on a freshly baked brownie!!  My husband loved it!!  The sauce came out smooth and velvety!!  I think blending is crucial!!!  Don't skip that step!!!

Loved this sauce! It is wonderful and very easy to make. Like some of the previous reviewers before me I chose to blend it while in the pan with my hand blender. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of salt to balance the sweetness. It was excellent and I will be making this again.

This sauce was excellent.  I have to admit, i didn't have evaporated milk, so I just used regular whole milk, and added cornstarch for thickening.  (it didn't get too thick, but the flavor was exceptional) I poured it over vanilla ice cream, and topped it with walnuts and chocolate sprinkles.

After looking at the other hot fudge sauce recipes on this site I decided to try this one out as it had the ingredients that I had on hand... and I am SO GLAD that i did.  I was a bit apprehensive though cause most of the others called for chocolate squares and confectioners sugar.  Well this one turned out just like I wanted.  I halfed the recipe cause it was just four of us (and I still had some leftover) and it turned out great... I still used about 1/3 cup of cocoa though.  One thing I did different was that I DID NOT blend it.  THe sauce had the right texture as is... served it hot and right out of the sauce pan and onto ice cream that was over "too much chocolate cake" which is also on this website!

This recipe is awesome.  I  doubled the cocoa and didn't have a blender so I mixed it with my kitchen aid for the 4 minutes.  It was my first time making homemade fudge sauce and it turned out perfect!

First, I halved the recipe to make sure I'd like it.  Made it exactly as written.  It was too sweet for me so I added 2 more T of cocoa and 1/4 t of salt.  That made it more to my liking.  Next time I will try with only 1 C sugar (remember I halved the recipe).  It was good.  "Halving' the recipe made the sauce fit nicely into a 16 oz glass jar of the brand name hot fudge I usually buy.  I would make this again and continue to tweak it with my preferences.  Overall...good recipe to start with.

This sauce is fabulous, just like when I was young.  Can someone help me?  I have made this twice now, and have had problems with crystallization after putting the sauce in the refrigerator.

When I was a child my dad made fudge sauce for ice cream a few times. Years passed and then he couldn't remember how he made it. I have tried so many hot fudge recipes. None tasted anything like I remembered...until now. This is it!! I am so excited to find this recipe after searching for so many years. It brings back many fond memories. Thank you for sharing this one!

Thanks a lot.  I am a Proud Dad (although this account belongs to my wife) for getting a five star commend from my daughter for "the best hot fudge ever".  I have combined tips from other reviewers,added chocolate chips, reduced butter slightly (1 1/2 bars, you do the math to get the cup measure), and used sweetened condensed milk.  Wow!! the sauce beats the local best in taste.

Delicious and simple to make. It tastes like the fudge sauce my grandmother made when I was a kid! One change.....I used slightly less sugar.Serve after it cools down. Everyone loves it especially over a slightly warm brownie, a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with the warm fudge sauce. Ooooh my!

This sauce is fantastic!  I just googled "hot fudge sauce, cocoa powder" because I knew that was the only type of chocolate I had.  This was the first recipe that came up and I got right to making it.  My kitchen smells awesome, the kids keep coming in to ask what I made, and I can't stop dunking my spoon in the finished product!  I don't think I'll need to blend mine, it looks perfectly smooth.  One thing I did different was to add some salt and I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder.  We are going to enjoy this tonight on hot fudge brownie sundaes!  YUM!

I was craving chocolate and this hit the spot.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 cup of cocoa (Ghiradelli).  Rather than put the mixture in the blender after it is cooked, I used a hand blender while stirring the boiling sauce.   This is NOT very thick when it is warm, but it is GOOD, rich and much better than store bought.  One batch filled four 1/2 pint canning jars.  I plan on taking one jar as a hostess gift to a brunch I'm attending in the morning.  Lovely!

I came across this recipe while searching for a recipe my husband wanted to find for a chocolate sauce like his grandmother used to make when he was little.  Well this was it and I am so glad I found it!  We keep a jar of this in the fridge for ice cream every night.  I'm not a big fan of hot fudge sauce, but this is the best sauce I have ever had!!

I like this hot fudge sauce, but it tasted like caramel hot fudge sauce.  I would like a recipe for more chocolate flavor, less caramel taste.  Not sure I would use this one again.

This was NOT good at all. I followed the recipe to a T but I dunno what i did wrong. The mixture started burning slighty in the saucepan and it was too thick! Even after using the blender, the sauce was too thick and a tad too sweet for my taste.
Won't be making this again!

Made it for a girls' night and everyone raved.  I was very surprised at how easy it was to make restaurant-quality hot fudge with ingredients I always have on hand!  It was just the right consistency- nice and thick.  I'll never have to buy it again!

Easy, cheap and yummy! We were having company and having sundaes for dessert, so I doubled recipe (but didnt need to, makes a lot). Used hand held blender. Used FF condensed milk, Splenda and light butter.....to save calories. Everyone really liked it!! My only complaint was you could tell cocoa powder was used, so next time I might use unsweetened choc squares to get a more "real" choc flavor. Good overall though. Stores nicely for up to a week in fridge.

This was better than store bought, excellent flavor.  I stgarted with 1/2 cup of cocoa  I don't see why you would even need to add semi-choclate.  Thank you for the recipe!!

As Rachel Ray would say "Yum-mo"  I followed a few of hte suggestions and cut the butter down to 2/3 cup and mixed it with some margarine (due to lack of butter) I boiled it for 10 minutes and added 1 c. of chocolate chips after boiling.  My measuring spoons were MIA so I just dumped in some vanilla.  Delicous!  Can't wait to try it over brownies and ice cream.

I thought this was very good.  Quite thick.  I did add a 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup chocolate chips while it was warm.  And you absolutely have to blend it in the blender--I tried some rigorous hand whipping and it was graining.  Blender is a must.  However, it is missing that something special...maybe next time I will try more vanilla or some cinnamon.

I will never buy Hot Fudge Sauce again when I can make this one, this is sensational! Oh so fudgy and simply perfect as an ice cream topping! Exactly what I was looking for, and tastes divine! I cut everything in the recipe in half except the cocoa, I still used the full 1/3 cup. I also used margarine instead of butter, and after it had cooked for 7 minutes I added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and stirred them in until melted. So yummy! Thankyou so much for sharing this recipe!

This was not the taste I was looking for, or expecting.  It was not at all "chocolately" enough.  It was better the next day.

Delicious recipe. I added a few ingredients because a few reviewers said it wasn't chocolatey enough...first I increased the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup and before I added the vanilla I added 2 oz unsweetened chocolate. After whirring this in the blender the deep chocolate color was there and after cooling, tasting it was wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe.

The chocolate flavor is delicious..mine didn't thicken as much as I would have liked. I will try this again and see if I should revise this review. I will also cut the butter to 3/4 cup and maybe add some more cocoa or choc.chips as suggested by others. Great as is..especially in a pinch.

This is the best hot fudge sauce ever!  I have made it and gave it away in jars for Christmas gifts and have gotten many requests for more.  The BEST!

Definitely a wonderful recipe!

I only used 3/4 cup of butter, and I added about another 1/3 cup of cocoa, as others had suggested...well, maybe even more than that because towards the end I was just sprinkling the cocoa in the pot! But it all turned out well and is a very delicious sauce.

This is a really, really good fudge sauce. I read the reviews before making this and some people said it wasn't fudgey enough. I love chocolate so I added along with the cocoa, one square of unsweetened baking chocolate and about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. With the amount of sugar called for, I didn't think I needed anymore. And I'm glad I didn't, it's still just as sweet! I made sure to wait until it was boiling and then let it go for a good seven minutes. Mine wasn't super- super thick, but it was really nice, not thin. Maybe some of the thinner sauces, aren't getting cooked long enough? Anyways, my fiance and I are having a party with Ice cream cake and we will be lucky if we have any hot fudge to serve with it come tomorrow!

Thanks Lisa! I put a layer of this sauce on the bottom of the No Bake Peanut Butter Pie (fabulous!) and served it warm in a little ramekin on the side.  I used the hand mixer to "blend" (and needed to even though I seived the dry ingredients).  Although it was DELICIOUS, I still found it a bit grainy.  My guests didn't notice and it got rave reviews.  Mmmmmm dipping my strawberries into the leftovers....

Although this isn't a bad sauce, I found it too sweet, and wasn't so happy with the viscosity of the sauce.  Yes, the sauce is nice and think when cold, but I wanted a hot fudge sauce.  So when heated, it runs much more.  I might try again with close to 1 cup less sugar, and less milk.  Regardless of my opinions, my husband and his father enjoyed eating the sauce.

The sauce was delicious.  However, next time I will try it with unsalted butter.  I would have given the recipe 5 stars if it was a little more chocolatey.  So next time I will also put in more cocoa.  The texture was nice and thick though.  With a few modifications, the recipe is a keeper!

Mmmmmm... delicious!  I halved the recipe and didn't add the vanilla.  Then, I poured it into the food processor and turned it on while I baked the Waffle Iron Brownies from this site.  Scooped chocolate ice cream on to the brownies and topped it off with this sauce.  It was probably the best dessert I've had in my life.

I am a chocoholic and all I can say is, "WOW...this sauce is pure bliss".  It almost has a caramely flavor when you pour it over ice cream.  I caught my husband eating it right off the spoon when he came home from work.  Thumbs up!!!  No more jarred hot fudge for us!!!

This is easily the best hot fudge sauce I've ever eaten.  We were tempted to put a straw in the bowl and eat it straight!  However, we served it with homemade ice cream and our family and guests thought it terriffic.

I cherry picked other reviewer suggestions. I bumped up the Coco the 1/2 cup, I added 1/4 teaspoon salt and a half cup of chocolate chips. I will definitely make this again. Very easy.

I had my doubts about this, but it turned out great! I found the reviews all had such varied opinions which made it confusing, even for an experienced cook. In the end I followed the recipe except I upped the cocoa to 1/2 cup which, retrospectively, is essential in my opinion. I also followed the practical suggestion of using beaters instead of dirtying a blender. I’m glad I didn’t decrease the sugar, it was perfectly sweet and thick as  a good fudge sauce should be. Glad I made it, it was easier than I anticipated.

I have made this recipe many times. Super simple, but contrary to what other reviewers say, blending the mixture in a blender is important to the smoothness of this rich chocolate sauce. You can whisk it, but it won't be the same. Also,  I have used cream instead of evap milk because we have that available more often than a can of milk. Comes out amazing either way and makes great gifts!

I just made this earlier today. I wish I'd been able to read the reviews but that's not an option on the Amazon Show.  Mine boiled over in a split second. I thought the pan was big enough. What a mess to clean up!!! My fault. I added 2 Godiva Raspberry candy bars for some flavor. I didn't blend it but will try that next time. It seems smooth with just whisking but I saw that some people said to blend it anyway. So far, very good warm or cold. I need to try it on ice cream and will try increasing the cocoa, decreasing the butter and sugar next time. Thank you for the easy, tasty recipe.

This recipe is not worth the risk of getting severely burned like I did. I dont have a blender and used a magic bullet instead not realizing they cannot be interchanged.  After blending, the lid exploded and boiling hot chocolate sauce burned my face and hands leaving me with severe 2nd degree burns to over half of my face. I'm still healing and would never wish the pain and anguish I've neen going through on anyone.

I made this to use with our weekly tin roof sundaes, and it was fantastic; we cut the sugar down to 2 cups instead of 3, and it was still incredibly good; next time I'm gonna try 1 1/2 cups... We tried really hard to find hot fudge sauce at the store that wasn't full of junk like high-fructose corn syrup and other nasty artificial stuff, and finally found one we liked called R & R Homestead, and we like this recipe better; taste, texture, couldn't be better. One more item we don't need to buy at the store...
Latest Update 8/29/2019: As I stated in the original review, the 3 cups of sugar is pretty overkill; I have it down to 1 3/4 cups, and it's still really good; that's where we've settled. All the other ingredients as from the recipe. Still really like this sauce!

This was beyond delicious....! I combined others’ suggestions. Only use 1 and 1/3 sticks of butter. Only 2 cups of sugar. Use a half cup of cocoa powder. And a sprinkle of salt. Throw in a big handful of excellent quality chocolate chips. I stirred the entire time it was boiling. Don’t skip the blending step. I used an immersion blender for 3 minutes. Just fabulous. Thank you so much for the recipe and for all of the suggestions!

I made this using the suggestion of only 2 cups of sugar and 1/2 cup of cocoa. It was awesome! This is dangerously delicious.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and for the reviews!

I used the dark cocoa powder.  I just prefer dark chocolate. I guess you could mix half and half too. I may try that next time.  This reminds me of the Shoney Hot Fudge Sauce on their Hot Fudge Cake! Wonderful Stuff!!  Will make it again!!

Awesome!  I followed some recommendations.  Cut sugar to 2 cups, butter to 1.5 sticks and added a couple handfuls of chocolate chips.
Stirred constantly with whisk, no need to use mixer.
Perfect

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. It is runny and too sweet, not much of a chocolaty fudge flavor. I'm glad I only made a half batch.

I've only made this once and cut the sugar down to 1 cup and upped the cocoa to almost 1/2 cup and it was just the way I like it, not overly sweet and packing a serious chocolate punch. I served it hot and it was fairly thin but thickens nicely once cooled.

Wonderful!  I usually make a recipe exactly the first time but I am very familiar with chocolate.  I followed the engineer advice to reduce sugar to avoid crystals in the cooled sauce.  I also slightly upped the cocoa after reading many reviews.  I like a darker chocolate but my milk chocolate loving husband loves this.  It is perfect that we both love it.  I just whisked for a few minutes with the pan sitting in a plate of ice since I wanted to eat it immediately.  It seemed thin and runny but is properly thick when it cools slightly.  I only made a half batch for the two of us since this makes a lot.  This would make a great gift.

I was searching for a chocolate sauce recipe that did not require cream as I had no cream in the fridge. I did have a can of evap milk though so decided to try this one. I did a half batch and only used 1 cup of sugar for that but used the full amount of cocoa. I also added about 50g of chocolate in at the end and left out the vanilla as another reviewer mentioned. It was so yum!  Really rich and smooth.  I didnt bother to blend it as I had whisked it smooth before bringing to the boil. So pleased with the results and very glad to know I no longer need heavy cream to make chocolate sauce!!

More buttery than chocolaty.  Also turned very grainy.  Seems like way too much sugar.

I made sure to use a MEDIUM sauce pan. I followed the recipe and made the following modifications after reading some of the reviews: I increased cocoa powder to 1/2 C instead of 1/3 C, added leftover chopped walnuts & chocolate chips (about 1/3 C each) from my pantry, added an extra 1/2 t. of my homemade vanilla, 1/2 t. pink salt, cut the sugar back to 2 C, and whisked the entire time so I would not have to use a blender. This recipe turned out incredibly smoothe and was spooned over a chocolate bundt cake (my husband is a chocoholic) and taken to a luncheon he and I were invited to. They raved about it. Recipe made 4 C.

Changes: 1/2c butter, 1c sugar, 1/2+1/3c cocoa, no vanilla extract. With these changes it made my fudge super fudge-y (amaaaazing), and not at all pourable and like a sauce. I thought to add the other 1/2c butter, but used water to thin it out. It tasted good, still, just not as fudge-y. After being in the fridge it tasted and had the consistency of pudding. It easily became pourable after being nuked for 15 seconds. If I ever wanted a frosting for brownies or cake, then I’d make it with the changes I made—minus the added water. I also wisked it and didn’t use a blender.  A keeper recipe, regardless that I tweaked it (thankful to helpful reviews!). To add: I used only 1/2c butter to be healthy and because someone suggested to for fudginess, but I assume butter would’ve added flavor and perhaps volume—maybe next time I’ll use a full cup of butter, since I’ll definitely be making this again and again!

This is a very fudgy sauce that gets thicker as it cools.  It's a forgiving recipe that still turns out great even if I halve it.

Close to my moms, which was "the best" over peppermint ice cream. Thanks. Followed others advice, reduced butter to 3/4 c., increased cocoa to 2/3 c.
Melted butter first, then added sugar, cocoa and evap milk. Stirred constantly over medium heat, brought to low boil, continued stirring for 7 minutes. Then switched to hand mixer on low for 4 minutes. Let cool uncovered, I didn't want condensation, to room temp., then covered and refrigerated. I'm bringing this to Christmas dinner, family tradition.

This is fantastic. I have made it dozens of times and it is always delicious. I only made it with evaporated milk one time. I switch between half and half and light cream. Result is the same...yummy! Thanks so much!

I followed the advice of many of the reviewers and decreased the sugar to 2 cups, but found it still seemed more sweet than fudgy, so I added 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips which helped, but still too sweet for me so I added a heaping tablespoon of instant coffee to it... Perfection !

This is excellent!  Tastes like the recipe my Mom made when I was a kid but much simpler!  I cut back the sugar to 2 cups and whisked while boiling so it was smooth and didn't need to go into the blender!  Soooooo yummy over homemade vanilla ice cream!

OMG. So. Good. I used just over 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 and dropped in a handful of Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips during the last minute of boiling. I followed the suggestion to use the stick immersion blender and it worked great. This was delicious over homemade vanilla ice cream on the 4th of July.

Perfection, and based on other reviews I cut sugar to 2 cups, boiled for 10 minutes and I used an immersion blender.  WOW, no sugar crystals once cooled and in the refrigerator, it's not too sweet and the consistency is amazing!!  This is a keeper and no other recipe is necessary, thanks Lisa for sharing this!

I used just a cup of sugar and I thought It came out really well.  I did add a half cup of semi sweet chocolate chips so maybe that's why it worked. I actually liked it not too sweet and it was nice and thick and fudgy. I ate some off a spoon and it was delicious. I plan on having some on ice cream later and I know it will be yummy. If you're trying to watch your sugar intake, and are fine with less sweet desserts, try it with less sugar and see how you like it. I'm happy with the way it came out and will make it the same way next time.

Excellent recipe! I used this as the fudge layer in an ice cream cake and it was a fudgey hit! I loved the simplicity of ingredients, everything I had in the pantry already. Definite keeper!

I added  approximately 1/2 cup of peanut butter and only 3/4 butter.  I was looking for a peanut butter and hot fudge recipe.  My mom used to make this when I was a child and love it and couldn't find it so I added it to this and thought it was great!.

Made exactly as recipe. I used Horizon pasture butter and Ghiradeli cocoa.  It tastes  good, but not the hot fudge flavor I'm looking for.  I think the evaporated milk dominates the flavor.

Love the rich flavor, but it didn't get as thick, once it had been refrigerated. Still works, if you just want a chocolate sauce.

This had a great chocolate flavor, but was really really thin, I wouldn't call it a hot fudge sauce, more like a chocolate syrup. Also, this recipe makes a huge amount, so if you are just using for your family one night, you can easily halve it!

DANGER - HEALTH HAZARD - ADDICTION WARNING - FDA CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE !!!!!

Well - that is how it effects me! This stuff is DANGEROUS because it is so easy to make and is SO DELICIOUS that it can become a HEALTH HAZARD if you are not careful you might get ADDICTED and find yourself eating spoonfuls  day and night when nobody is looking. I'm seriously thinking of starting a SHF support group! I made it with the 1/2 C butter - 2C sugar - 1/2 C cocoa   - Used an immersion blender. Plus I hydrated the cocoa with a few TBS of water, started heating it then added the next water soluble , the milk.. then the fat - butter and lastly sugar... Not sure this made any difference but when chilled it is the consistency of pudding. Next batch will have the coffee added :)

I made this last night for my husband, a hot fudge fanatic, it was awesome and made enough for two small mason jars. 
After reading all the reviews I too made a couple of changes, I added cocoa bringing the measurement to 1/2 a cup and I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I recently switched from Hersheys/Nestle products to the Divine brand of raw, organic cocoa found on Amazon and the difference is incomparable. Wow. No more metallic or bitter chocolate taste, if you haven't tried it for this kind of recipe,  I highly suggest it. Overall, I couldn't be happier and will be making this at Christmas to give as gifts.

I am sure it is good, but the time is off. You can not bring it to a boil in 11 minutes, then blend to 4.

I agree that it was way too sweet, I ended up doubling the cocoa and that made it fantastic.  This cooked up very nicely in my dutch oven.

I used Tollhouse cocoa powder, which I have found to be less strong than Hershey's. Thus, I doubled the cocoa powder (lots of people complained that this recipe is too sweet. This may solve the issue for them as well). I thought it turned out great; not too sweet, not too bitter. I will definitely make this again. It's the closest I have found to the recipe my mom used to make.

I used my immersion blender while the sauce was cooking instead of the blender after cooking. I served the sauce from a small crock pot over chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. It was a hit. I'll make it again. I like that it uses simple ingredients that I keep on hand.

So delicious!! I took the advice of others, using 1/2c butter, 2c sugar, 1/2c  cocoa (still very sweet ... I would even venture to say that 3c of sugar would be overly sweet for our taste). Boiled for 6 minutes, used a stick blender for 3 minutes then let it sit for 10 minutes.  Eons better than store bought! Thank you for a great recipe.

Hubby came back with 5oz can of evaporated milk! This isn't baking, so I too made adjustments. 3/4 cup unsalted butter, 2 cups organic sugar, 5oz evaporated milk & 5 oz of 1/2&1/2 vanilla as stated and probably 1 C or more of cocoa powder (Hershey's and what was left of good Dutch processed.) I cooked over double boiler for probably 30 minutes, stirring and stirring with a small whisk. Then realized evaporation = concentration. Moved to a heavy bottom stock pot and cooked for another 10 minutes or so on low heat stirring constantly. Enough water from butter and milks evaporated to make it perfectly thick. No crystallization at all in fridge and in reheating. Makes lots, keeps well and reheats well. Now making for a friend with a restaurant. You see air pockets from whisk - they do go away.

I made this over the weekend for my daughter's birthday party. I didn't need a lot, so I followed a reviewers suggestion of 1 stck butter, 2 cups sugar and a half cup cocoa. I thought it was a little runny when first made but now after being in the fridge I think it's just right. Anyway, I wanted to write a review (which I never do) to say this makes amazing hot chocolate! Warm milk and a generous tablespoon of hot fudge sauce over low heat on the stove until hot. And voila amazing hot chocolate!

I didn't have evaporated milk and my chocolate craving was desperate so I used sweetened condensed instead.  I included 1/2 cup of cocoa powder as some suggested as well as a good handful of dark chocolate chips.  I only used 1 cup of sugar which makes it plenty sweet with the sweetened condensed milk.  I also added 1/2 tsp salt and put the vanilla in at the end.  I love the flavor with the sweetened condensed so much I'm sitting here enjoying it off my spoon.  I guess I have to put the rest in the fridge before I go comotose.

So Ive been trying to make a chewy chocolate fudge. And I can make it perfect! But after it cools it becomes harder and a straight fudge and looses its chewy Carmel texture.

A good basic hot fudge.  I followed directions exactly, boiling for 7 minutes, and (after cooling for about 30 minutes), 3 minutes in the blender.  Only minor change I made to ingredients was using dark chocolate cocoa instead of regular.  Thickens while cooling, and was perfect over a brownie and ice cream.  It did have a very smooth silky feel ... will be curious to see what it's like after a few days in the fridge.  (It does make a LOT ... filled a quart jar completely, which is a huge amount of hot fudge!  Hope it keeps well in the fridge.)

Sue, I mean no disrespect when I say I used your recipe as a base for my sauce. I like my hot fudge thick and rich. I eye-balled the sugar and dark chocolate cocoa powder so that the sugar was double that of the Coco. I only use one stick of butter, a pinch of salt, and used frozen chocolate chips as my thickener. I am fairly certain my daughter's second grade class is going to love it at the ice cream party today.

Near perfection.  If you have had Sander's hot fudge (made in MI), this is almost as good.  Far better than smuckers or hershey's hot fudge.  About the right consistency, & spot on for flavor.  We make this & store it in pint canning jars, just put the lid on after pouring in the hot mixture in & it seals right up.  about a month after opening, the sugar starts to crystalize, but the flavor is still good.  Use it for hot fudge sundaes, making chocolate milkshakes, etc.

Added a little salt to offset the sweetness. Also, added a bit more vanilla than called for by the recipe. I also used CAROB  POWDER instead of cocoa powder (since I am unable to eat chocolate). I used this sauce atop a brownie made with carob chips and sprinkled with toasted pecan pieces (since I can not eat almonds).

Amazing! I used 1 cup less sugar and the 1 and 1/3 cup of butter listed in other reviews. The blending really seemed to make the texture fantastic! The only problem is that this is addictive and it makes a ton. You may want to jar some and give it away.

Love it! This is perfect.  I followed the recipe except I added 1/2 tsp. salt and increased the coco to 1/2 c.  I also whisked it during slow boil for 10 min. and used the hand mixer for 4 min. instead of the blender.  Don't worry it thickens perfectly as it cools.

This is amazing.   I was looking for a recipe that used the same ingredients my mom used.  She has a fudge recipe that she uses to make sauce and frosting but her's always crystallizes.  I followed other reviews and only added 2 cups of sugar and 1 stick of butter.  I added the butter and vanilla at the end after removing from the heat - similar to fudge making.  The end consistency after being in the fridge was between frosting and pudding.  No sugar crystals!

Excellent sauce. I might cut out one cup of sugar the next time. I added two large handfulls of chocolate chips which added to the sweetness so less sugar would have worked better. I did blend it well and it turned out smooth like silk. It makes a fair bit so refridgerate the leftovers. I reheated mine in the microwave and it turned out just like it did when fresh. My husband, who rarely eats ice cream, loaded up a bowl once he tasted this sauce.

Very tasty, but more like a thick chocolate sauce than hot fudge. It tastes to me like melted no-bake cookies. Per other reviewers, I upped the cocoa to about 1/2 cup and decreased the sugar to 2 cups, but it was still not quite as rich and dark as true hot fudge sauce. I was hoping for a cheaper alternative to store bought, and adding a huge brick of dark chocolate makes it a lot more expensive. Still, it is really good, and I have been sneaking to the fridge to get out spoonfuls. :)

I doubled the recipe. And then, in order to make a healthier version, I substituted a can of coconut cream and added just enough coconut milk to make two cups. I also put the cooked mixture in a blender for 2 - 4 minutes at the end which made the sauce much smoother and  thicker.

I followed suggestions of others and put less sugar and butter. I doubled the recipe but just changed the butter to 3 cubes and the sugar to 5 cups. It turned out smooth and wonderful. We jarred these and gave them out as Christmas presents.

Disaster. It all started to burn before it ever came to the boil, and even with reducing the sugar to 2 cups it was way, way too sweet.

This recipe is O.K. I guess. I'm quite annoyed that it boiled over and made quite a mess of my kitchen. It required quite a few ingredients so that was a plus. However, it took a SUPER long time to cool down b4 I could put it in the fridge. Make sure to use a BIG pot so that it wont bubble over, use lesser sugar, about two and a half? and enjoy!

For being as simple as this is, great recipe!

It wasn't the best fudge sauce ever, which is why I only am giving it four stars. I did make some modifications to it, though, and everyone liked it still. We ran out of sugar two cups through, so I used a cup of brown sugar as well; skipped the vanilla extract; and also the skipped the blender step.

As I said earlier, this is an epic recipe for being so easy. I think that to get the perfect fudge sauce recipe you would need a much more difficult recipe, so I'll probably stick with this unless I find an easy, better recipe.

This is a great recipe. You really do need to put in blender for the ultimate texture. I tried it before and after blending and it was so much better after, although not a must. I used regular Hershey's cocoa but have a Dutch process cocoa arriving in the mail soon and will try that when it arrives. It has a higher percentage of fat in it and wonder if it'll be a richer chocolate flavor. I don't think it's too sweet, after all it's hot fudge! This will be a keeper for sure.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and went with 2 cups of sugar, 1/2 cup coco and 1 scant cup butter (salted) After boiling I cooled for 15 minutes then I blended for the four minutes.  I added about 1-2 tblsp of whipping cream when I blended. It was perfect warm or cold! 
As someone who is allergic to soya, it is impossible to find things these days that do not contain it. Being able to make a treat like this is great and that it only takes a few minutes means I can make it whenever I need to.  A big thank-you for this recipe!

Good base recipe, but I made revisions per several reader suggestions, so it isn't fair to rate this recipe, but wanted to share...end result was more than excellent!  I doubled the recipe to take to an ice cream social.  For double the recipe: I used 2 sticks of butter, 4 C sugar, 1.5 C cocoa, one can evaporated milk, filled the empty can with half and half, 1 tsp. salt, 2 tsp. cornstarch, added extra vanilla, 'cuz I love it!  I sifted all the dry ingredients together, before mixing with wet.  Boiled for about 10 minutes or so, it was pretty smooth already from me sifting dry ingredients, but used my immersion blender when finished boiling.  It was SOOOO good!  Very smooth.  Didn't taste one bit like caramel, due to the extra cocoa.  It was a HUGE hit.  People couldn't keep their spoons out of it and several asked for the recipe.  Thank you Sue and thank you readers for the great suggestions!

Looking for a hot fudge sauce I could give as gifts, I turned to this recipe since it had such great reviews.  I always use Domino sugar in my baking because it is not a grainy sugar. It dissolved and cooked down so well that I considered skipping the blender step but I didn't. I used my hand held blender right in the pan. The sauce turned out super creamy and smooth which made for a wonderful mouth feel. However, the cocoa powder did not give it the deeper fudge taste I was looking for. I agree with other reviewers in that it was "caramel-like" and I did use evaporated milk and not sweetened condensed. To me there is a difference between chocolate and fudge favors and this reminds me more of a hot chocolate sauce instead of a hot fudge. It's good - just not what I was hoping for.

Made this last night and I have to admit I'm craving some right now. It's a super rich, super thick, chocolatey piece of heaven. This is the one time I simply could not give my son the spoon. I was addicted from the word go lol. I did make two adjustments however, I added a nice big handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips and I used margarine instead of butter. No particular reason for the butter switch except for that's what I had on hand. I used the chocolate chips to tone down some of the sweetness that was going on. This recipe is excellent!!! There's a turtle brownie hot fudge sundae with my name on it just waiting to be made. Good eats everyone!

I can tell my looking at this recipe it will be a good one.  If too sweet  I can add more cocoa - no problem.  
I am disheartened to see see only three stars or less on some of these from people who changed the recipe them rated it down.  The gentleman who scourched his must have been a beginner. To beginners:  Start with low heat if and increase in increments because stoves differ (esp. electric) or 
cook in a double boiler.  It may take longer, but it will save the sauce from burning.  ; )  As an experienced cook I have no doubt this will come out a 5 for me.

dI made this for my husband because he wanted some Hot Fudge for his ice cream and we were out.  He said it was was goo but too sugary. I liked it, but I am not a huge fan of chocolate, however it wasn't that chocolately to me. I used evaporated milk and it DID taste more caramel to me.  Maybe next time I will add more cocoa. I store it in a empty coffee creamer bottle for easy pouring.
Overall, great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

I'm not one for chocolate anything, but I made it for my chocolate-loving hubby and daughter as a fudge topping for vanilla ice cream tonight. They liked it, but didn't LOVE it. I halved the recipe, using only 1 cup sugar and subbing out half & half instead. I didn't want to use the blender, so tried whisking it the whole time, but I found the recipe and reviewers are correct:  the blending DOES indeed, make a difference in the final outcome. The immersion blender right in the saucepan did the trick as far as producing a silky smooth, thick sauce.

I made this hot fudge sauce and it is really good.  Way better than any store bought I have tried.  I see what people are saying about it tasting "caramely" and no, I didn't use the wrong milk, I used evaoporated milk.  I am wondering if the addition of the vanilla did it.  Not sure.  To me, it tasted more chocolatey before I added it.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BLENDING it as directed.  I considered skipping that step, but decided to follow through.  I was rewarded for my efforts as it made the smoothest sauce ever!  Very nice consistency.  It was nowhere near that silky before blending.  I boiled it a few minutes longer than the directions because it was too liquidy for my taste.  I did it to slightly under "soft ball stage".  It is perfect for ice cream, cheesecake or just random sampling right from the spoon! Next time, I will probably add more cocoa and no vanilla.

Killer. I used half and half instead of evaporated milk and it worked amazingly. It's a very sweet recipe... but it IS hot fudge after all.

I love this recipe and use it all the time!  I too add a tsp or so of salt and leave out the vanilla.  Every time I walk by the fridge I find my self dipping into it!
I have one question though and wondered if somebody could help.  Since this makes a pretty generous amount I usually have some left.  I pour what's left in a quart jar and put it in the fridge.  However, most of the time it crystallizes.  Not aways, but most of the time.  Is there a trick?

I love this sauce, but I didn't think 1/3 cocoa was quite enough.  I ended up doubling it, and it was perfect!  It is smooth and creamy and reheats just fine.  A few people complained of it crystalizing. This would be a result of it being cooked too long/hot.  Use a candy thermometer and make sure to call it a day once the temp reaches 220 degrees.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

delicious....and a real life-saver. Made another fudge sauce and it turned out chunky and separated. So made this at the last minute for a bridal shower to serve over coconut cake...needed something fudgy and thick, and this was perfect. As per other hints, I added 1/2 c. cocoa and a handful of choc. chips, and I whisked it while it was boiling and skipped the blender. Can't imagine it being any more smooth or creamy. Yum.

Using the blender makes this sauce very smooth and creamy, don't skip this step!  I, too, added a handful of semi sweet choc. chips to the mixture, but could've added them while it was blending instead.  I stirred in a 1/4 tsp of instant coffee granules along with more cocoa for a decadent, rich, deep chocolate experience. try it!

Yum!  Easy to make and thickened nicely once cooled.  I did add extra cocoa per other reviewers' suggestions, but did everything else as stated.  I probably added almost 2/3 cup of cocoa and it was delicious!

This was just ok to me. I halved the recipe. I don't know why but it froze up when I added it to ice cream. So then it was just frozen chocolate strips. Not good. So then I thought I would try it again later. When I took it out of fridge and warmed it up it was very grainy. Does anyone know what went wrong? I've read alot of reviews and haven't really heard of this problem. Not sure I'll try again.

this is a good, quick recipe. why not 5 stars? Well, it is good, but somehow lacks the richness of other sauces I've had. It was fine if you don't blend it, and fine if you do.

This was delicious! After reading the reviews, I upped the cocoa powder to half a cup. My blender is broken, so I had to use a whisk, but it still turned out very creamy. I made it to serve over a cheesecake, but I can't wait to try it with ice cream!

This was the hit of the night, although I thought it much too sweet. I even added more cocoa, less sugar. Too sweet for me but I will make it again with even less sugar.

We followed the recipe as written, and it was VERY good!  I wish I'd scaled down the recipe, though, because I was making it for just two of us, and it didn't save very well!

This was a pretty good recipe but I found that it was too sweet and too saucy.  So I cut back the butter to 1/2 cup and the sugar to 2 cups. I think next time I'll up the cocoa to 1/2 cup and see if it's a little more rich and fudge-like.  Otherwise a good recipe.  Oh, I added a little salt too, 1/4 tsp.

This is so easy and inexpensive to make. Most of all it's delicious! I've made it exactly as written twice...once using Hershey's cocoa, once with Nestle. I thought Nestle's gave it a deeper chocolate taste.  The 2nd time I added just a splash of cold brewed coffee.  Did I mention this is delicious?!  I'm going to be making this to give as gifts at Christmas.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

Very good recipe! However I cooked it stirring constantly with a whisk for 20-25 minutes over medium heat and it turn a wonderfully thick consistency. It had good flavor before but it still have the great flavor but is much thicker!

This recipe was soooo good.  I made brownie sundaes and the only left were empty bowls.  Everyone loved it.  Instead of putting the hot sauce in a blender I used an immersion blender and blended right in the pan.  The Hot Fudge Sauce was very creamy and smooth. This recipe makes a good amount of Hot Fudge Sauce.  Next time I will probably half the recipe and I know I'll still have leftovers.  This is a great recipe to have on hand especially now with summer here and all the fresh fruit available.  This would be great with a plate of strawberries and some heath bar pieces and coconut.  Dip the strawberries in the chocolate and then in the heath bar pieces or coconut.  Another favorite summer dessert that's quick and easy and a favorite with kids.

Great recipe.  I dipped frozen bananas into it and rolled them in coconut, nuts and/or sprinkles then put them back in the freezer to set.  The Kids loved them.

This is a good recipe, however you can use equal parts of half and half and evaporated milk.  Everyone loves it and we use it often.

WOW, this took less than 15 minutes from start to finish.  It made an amazing amount of sauce.  I let my kids taste it one the pan was cooled before washing and a fight broke out about who got to have the most it was THAT good.  Thank you so much for this, i will make it over and over.  It was perfect exactly the way it is.

Easy and fast to make. Great texture but way, way too sweet - overpowering the fudge flavor.  If I make this again, I will reduce the sugar by at least one cup and/or increase the cocao.

This was so good. I did use fat free evap milk and upped cocoa to 1/2c. I think I'd reduce sugar to 2 1/2 cups next time. I will make this again. For those who are worried about splattering and blender explosions..I used a 3qt pan and had no problem, put the whole batch in my blender and started at the lowest speed. No messes. Also I think some people must have accidently used sweetened condensed milk instaed of evaporated milk.

Very Lovely!
I followed the suggestions to up the cocoa and add chocolate chips and it was wonderful! I recommend it!
The only other thing I'd suggest is letting it cool for 20 minutes or so before using it. I hurried it along and melted all my ice cream!

DELICIOUS! If you only want to make a serving for 8 - then half the evaporated milk and freeze the rest - for another hot fudge night!
YUMMY! I also use the hand blender, works great! If you serve cold over icecream it stays THICK!

Delicious! Very sweet and has a caramel taste to it. It is better than gourmet store-bought and would be perfect for homemade gifts in jars just the way it is. I think I will try with less sugar and more cocoa for my own taste next time but very tasty!

Gave as gifts in Cruets for Christmas. Hit! I also used the hand blender while cooking and added a handful of simi sweet chips to the mix just because I wanted more chocolate. I am not a chocolate fan but oh boy do I love this hot fudge.

Great recipe! Comes out perfect everytime. I also added some semisweet choc. chips and that was great!  I accidently added milk choc. chips and that was a mistake, it made it too sweet.  Still usable though. one tip though, I was making a large quantity and the blender froze up after the first batch cooled inside it, probably need to wash the blender between uses, or time the batches perfectly so your using one after the other.  Its a great x-mas gift!

This sauce is amazing!  Way better than store-bought.  This version has more of a milk chocolate flavor (as opposed to semi-sweet).  Don't omit the blender step.  I follow the directions and ingredients exactly and have never had a problem with this recipe.

This was awsome but do not make this in a bullet. We got it all over the kitchen and got some severe burns. after spending the better part of the next hour cleaning up, it was a good thing it was so yummy!

This is by far the best homemade sauce! I added a handful of chocolate chips to give it a extra chocolately twist. My husband has a bad sweet tooth!! :) But everthing else I went right by the recipe and it turned out perfect! I will be making this for now on!!

This is a very thick, yummy & sweet chocolate sauce.  I am still looking for a sauce that is more "fudgy" vs. just "chocolate" sauce.  But in the meantime, this will be what we use!  Thanks for sharing.

I liked the thick, smooth texture but it wasn't the dark fudge-like chocolate I was expecting; will try it again but increase the cocoa.

Fabulous - even better if you let it set up a bit.  I've been eating this w/ a spoon for two days! YUMMY and easy.

I think the people that say it has a weird "caramel" taste are using sweetened CONDENSED milk instead of EVAPORATED milk.  There is a difference!!

Absolutely, positively delicious!!! And even despite the blender malfunctioning and hot fudge splattering everywhere, resulting in the use of the mixer instead of the blender...when I served this rich, thick and smooth fudge on top of vanilla ice cream with fresh strawberries on top, my guys just went crazy!  And I too could have cared less about the mess in the kitchen! I will never buy store bought again!

Mmmmmmmmm..what a great sauce!  I agree with the reviewer who said you don't need ice cream, just a spoon!  I did make one adjustment.  I used 3/4 cup real butter instead of 1 cup  (that's all I had), but it didn't make a difference.  This fudge sauce is superb.  It only took 20 minutes from start to finish, which is also great.

Why would anyone ever buy hot fudge from a store again???  This is the best hot fudge I've ever had!  Excellent recipe!  I cut it in half but left the cocoa amount the same and added a square of unsweetened chocolate.

Excellent, very thick hot fudge sauce.  I added one cup of cocoa instead of 1/3 cup to make it more like dark chocolate.  I also made sure it was at a full boil for 10 minutes instead of 7 minutes so that it wouldn't be too thin.  Blending with a blender is really a must.  Turned out great.

I rated this five stars but it's really 10!! I cut this recipe in half as I didn't have many to make it for today. I used about half the butter called for and thought I ran short on sugar and then decided to use a little powdered sugar to fill the spot, and it worked out fine,  I added some semi-sweet chocolate chips while heating on the stove and I didn't need the blender...it came out so creamy on its' own. It does thicken a little after cooling down some, and it thickens some after being on the cold ice cream. It was just the right consistency. I had chocolate peanut butter chunk ice cream topped with some crumbled chocolate chip cookie pieces, this hot fudge sauce, whipped cream, and then sprinkled with a small amount of chocolate chips. I curled up on the couch, covered up with a blanket, turned on the Gospel channel, and thoroughly enjoyed this sunday!!

From one chocolate lover to the next, this is a great hot fudge sauce.  I served myself up a bowl of ice cream last night only to find the kids had polished off the chocolate syrup.  Desperate times call for desperate measures, so I searched for a recipe and found this one.  Very easy to make and delicious.  Thanks for sharing it!

Easy to make. My family liked. It's not the deep, thick, dark, semisweet fudge topping I was looking for, but it was good. I think for the dark fudge topping, one should use semisweet bakers chocolate, instead of cocoa powder.

This is a good chocolate sauce, but I wouldn't call it fudge sauce.  It reminds of the the frosting for a Texas sheet cake.  I am really looking for a thick fudge sauce that stays thick when warmed to use as a fruit dip or a fondue.  I also agree with another reviewer that it is a little grainy.  Will try the leftover on some vanilla ice cream.

Outstanding! I forgot the vanilla and it was still wonderful. Just as good straight from the spoon the next day when I absolutely HAD to have some chocolate. This recipe will become a standard in our house. No more 'bought' stuff for us.

Very good.  I used Dutch Process Cocoa.  You must use 
a large sauce pan and watch carefully, I didn't and
it boiled over on me.  I believe if you sieve the
cocoa and stir into the sugar you might not have to    
blend the sauce.  I forgot to do that and had lumpy
sauce so it had to be blended.

I thought this was pretty good.  My husband thought it wasn't "fudgy enough", but he couldn't pinpoint what was wrong.  I was a little disappointed that it wasn't thicker while still warm - it only seemed to get nice and thick as it got cool.
