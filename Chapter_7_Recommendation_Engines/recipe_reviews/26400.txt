So simple, so fast, SO delicious! I modified by adding two 28oz cans of diced tomatoes and no tomatoe sauce or paste and using chili powder and cumin as spice. The result - RAVE reviews!

I received a last minute call, and had to change the menu to suite the needs of our guests. I tried this recipe and was not disappointed. I didn't have pinto beans or frozen corn, but used black beans and canned corn instead (also added a bit of garlic powder).  I served some over fritos others without, added shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream to cut the heat, then sprinkled some black olives on top for my son. This fast easy dish was a hit in my house, and we will make it again. thanks!

This was a "clean out the pantry, fridge and freezer" recipe for me.  I had everything on hand!  I used cumin and chili powder instead of cayenne (lots of chili powder, a good two tablespoons for half the recipe because it dumped out of the bottle), mexican style tomatoes and no tomato paste.  We had it over tricolor rotini with a dollop of sour cream.  I give this four stars because it was quick, easy and healthy.  It wasn't out of this world amazing, but good enough to make a couple times a year.  Thanks!

I was so excited when I first read this recipe and all the great reviews, but after following the recipe to a "T" it was hardly edible.  It was so bland, we had to spice it up even more and that barely worked.  It's sad to see so much food go into the trash.  This one needs some work.

This was great, the whole family loved it, even my picky son who doesn't like tomatoes.  I wouldn't change anything but maybe the amount of cayenne pepper, it was just a little too spicy for me, and maybe a little less salt.  I will definitely make again.

Easy and good, but don't call this chili as it stands.  I did add two tablespoons chili powder and extra cumin along with the suggested amount of cayenne and liked it a lot.  I would like this better with a couple of pounds of ground beef added and may try it that way next time.  I like the texture and crunch the corn added.

Waaaay too hot.  Cut the chili powder down by 1/4.

This has been so good to heat up for my work lunches this week during the cold weather. I left out the pinto beans so my partner would eat this too, and he says this is the best chilli I have made so far! This is a keeper and next time I make it I will have to double the recipe as my man keeps eating it!

I liked this but it was a little too much cayenne for my taste.  It made it hot but it tasted like something was missing.  I added about 1 Tb chili powder and that helped out.  I am vegetarian so I used powdered veggie base and used fresh chopped oregano (about 1 Tb) because I had some on hand and didn't want it to go to waste.  I will definitely make this again.

So filling, especially considering that there's no meat in it.  I added a bit less cayenne pepper and added some taco seasoning instead.  It was pretty spicy, but I found that it got less spicy with each day that passed.  Served with Fritos and sour cream, it's delicious.  It also pairs well with Golden Sweet Cornbread from this site.

This recipe is great as is! Except for replacing the onion with onion powder, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great, spicy and thick just like chili should be!!

this was delicious! I used fresh corn & used the cobs to help enhance the flavor (discarding them later) & it was really good!

This is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using 1/4 tsp chili powder and 1/4 tsp smoked paprika instead of the teaspoon of cayenne pepper (which would have been way too hot for me). I live in a high-altitude area, so it took a good 30 minutes to reduce this down from a "soup" consistency to a "chili" consistency..and it was  still pretty juicy. I believe you could call the finished product either a thick taco-type soup or a liquidy chili. It was yummy either way! It is also delicious eaten with sour cream. I will be adding this recipe to my permanent collection. ***NOTE: I made this a second time with only half the oil called for and none of the salt. It definitely doesn't need that extra salt, and the chili was every bit as delicious without the extra oil. ***UPDATE: Okay I've made this recipe 5 or 6 times now because it's so easy and good. This last time, I didn't realize that I was out of tomato sauce and frozen corn until I had already started the recipe and put the spices in the pot. I ended up using 1 can of creamed corn and 1 can of corn niblets, an 8 oz can of tomato paste, and an extra cup of water. Then I added about 1/4 cup of sugar and went heavier on the spices since tomato paste is blander than tomato sauce...and it turned out wonderfully :) I LOVE this recipe!

This was a very quick and easy recipe.  The cayenne pepper amount is way too much!  No amount of cheese or sour cream toned it down, it was very overpowering!  I would start with 1/4 teaspoon and increase in small increments after tasting.  I didn't have mexican stewed tomatoes, so I subbed original stewed.  I also used 1 cup chicken broth instead of granules + water.  I will make this again, but will reduce the cayenne to adapt to our tastes.

I thought this recipe was very tasty & a great one for chili! I must admit I ended up adding some ground beef - I had some leftover hamburgers that I wanted to use.  I have not tried the vegetarian version, however all the ingredients worked well together and the consistency for chili was spot on. Thanks for sharing!
