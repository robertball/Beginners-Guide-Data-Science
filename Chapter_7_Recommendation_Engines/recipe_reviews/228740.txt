I made some healthy substitutions and it was still really good! Instead of butter I used 1 cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup earth balance buttery spread. I removed 1 cup of brown sugar all together. I replaced 2 of the cups of flour with 1 cup golden flax meal and one cup almond flour. They are delcious and still plenty sweet with all those chocolate chips.

The original recipe deserves 5 stars. However, my changes could make them a heart-healthier 6 ;) I used half whole wheat flour (2 cups of wheat, two of white), increased the oats to 3 cups and eliminated the white sugar (just used 2 cups brown). I also substituted some of the butter for unsweetened applesauce. The entire family likes them.

I was looking for a pumpkin pie cookie that wasn't so cakey - this is it!! Everyone (including my pumpkin hating boyfriend) loved them!
I followed the recipe almost exactly... I did use pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin puree, and added a few TSPs of pumpkin pie spice and an extra dash of cinnamon for more flavor. Also, I used regular sized milk chocolate chips instead of mini semi sweets. I'd say they are perfect this way! They taste even better the next day, and are still super soft!

The pumpkin is a great way to add a tasty twist to a classic. They were easy to make and so yummy! I added crushed walnuts to give it a little crunch. The original recipe made amazingly soft, sweet cookies! i would recommend this again and again...

I made this recipe for my co-workers and they loved them!  I only made a 1/2 batch because I didn't need 6 dozen cookies.  Because there is only 1 egg in the full recipe, I still used a single egg for the half batch without any other changes to the ratios.  Make sure to remove from the oven when they just start to brown so they do not dry out.  I added a pinch of nutmeg, ginger and cloves to make them a little more pumpkin-pie flavored.

This was so tasty! I halved the recipe so here are some tips if you also don't want to make 6 dozen cookies. When you half the recipe, still use a whole egg and use a little less than a half a teaspoon of salt. So delicious. I also added more chocolate chips and I didn't use the mini kind.

I altered the recipe a bit to make it a bit more healthy and so I could share it with a friend allergic to eggs: I use coconut oil instead of butter, only 1 cup brown sugar and no white sugar. No egg, 1/4 cup coconut milk, and more spices: a tablespoon cinnamon, a tablespoon nutmeg and two teaspoons ground cloves. I also added raisins instead of chocolate chips.  They were still moist and yummy (we are used to low sugar, so that might not be the case for everyone)  The spices add that zing that makes not so sweet just fine.

Soo good!!! They turned out super moist!! In addition to the cinnamon I added a pinch of nutmeg, allspice, ginger and cloves, around a 1/4 tsp of each!!! A nice change of pace from traditional chocolate chip cookie!!!

These are so delicious! Very easy and yields more than the recipe states.  I got about 84 cookies from one batch.  The only changes I made were that I used white chocolate chips and added 1 1/2 cups of walnuts. My family raved about them and couldn't stop eating them!

These are pretty good. My 18yr. old son absolutely LOVED them. I halved the recipe but put in a whole (small) egg, a little over 1/2 the can of pumpkin, and 1 1/2c. of regular rolled oats instead of just 1c. I was glad I increased the oats. I also reduced the brown sugar by 1/4 and the white by about 1/2. Used regular chocolate chips too. Half the recipe made 3 1/2 dozen cookies using a TBS cookie scoop.

I tried this recipe for some friends. I made this using two bags of Semi-sweet chocolate chunks instead of mini chocolate chips. It was a hit! Everybody couldn't stop eating them. My friend later asked me for the recipe because they wanted to make them again.
Tip: I will say, at least with the chocolate chunks, they tasted better cold.

The first time I made them, they needed more time, they were way undercooked.  So the second time I made them, I added 1/3 cup more oats and increased the time to 15 or so minutes.  They come out soft inside with a slight crisp on the outside. For more flavor, try using pumpkin pie spice, the nutmeg added a little something extra.  I always put a little extra spice in there.   Also, I used a cookie scoop to get them in just the right size and shape. Try them with dark chocolate morsels or butterscotch chips, both excellent!

The more I eat these the more I am beginning to like them. I followed a reviewer, I read, and added pumpkin spice. I made 1/4 of the recipe and yielded 23 cookies using a cookie scoop. For that amount of the recipe I used 3/4 of a tsp of pumpkin spice on top of the cinnamon. I highly recommend adding that spice to taste! I also cut the chocolate chips in half. These were some where in the middle of cakey and chewy both when first baked. After completely cooling they do take on more of the mini cake texture or fruit sweetened cookie taste and texture. With the yield, and cutting the chocolate chips in half, they are approximately 89 calories per cookie.

My granddaughters and I made these cookies.  We added 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon and only added about 1 cup of the mini chocolate chips so as not to overpower the pumpkin flavor. I like the fact that this recipe used the whole can of pumpkin with the addition of oatmeal.  This recipe made a lot of cookies.  The extra baked cookies can be frozen or any unbaked dough can be frozen for later use.  The cookies turned out moist and chewy rather than cakey!

This recipe makes A LOT of delicious cookies.  If it weren't the ability to freeze the dough, I'd say it makes too many!  You could easily half the recipe and feed the whole neighborhood.

I added a teaspoon of fresh nutmeg and a teaspoon of almond extract.  This had definitely become my new "family secret."  Love this recipe.

These are great cookies! Really soft with a nice pumpkin flavor and not too much spice. Take note of the amoount it makes...6 dozen! They aren't as much like oatmeal cookies as I thought they would be, I found it was almost unnoticable.

I made a few substitutions:  I used 2 cups white flour, 2 cups whole wheat flour, increased vanilla to 2 tsp , added an extra 1/2 cup of oats and added 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice.  I also used white chocolate chips and toasted pecans. They are a perfect Autumn cookie.  I took them to a tailgate and everyone raved about them and asked, "who made those cookies?  They are amazing!"  I will definitely make these again as this recipe replaced my other pumpkin cookie recipe which made a more cake-like and sticky cookie.

I added more spice, used old fashioned oats, and regular chocolate chips rather than mini. I got rave reviews at the church bake sale and was asked to make them again.

These have become a family favorite, especially around the holidays. I usually make a double-batch (roughly 15 dozen) and friends and family members snap them up within a day of me posting pictures of them cooling. My wife will take 5 dozen to her work and they are gone by the afternoon! Cream the butter and sugars properly and you'll have thick, but light, cookies that everyone will love!

Yummy!!! I didn't use the chocolate chips since I had cinnamon chips I thought would be better in this recipe (per my taste buds!). Great flavors! Next time I might add pecans, I think that would add a nice touch to them! Great recipe! Thanks!

I grew up eating (and loving) these cookies.  The pumpkin is subtle enough that even my husband (not a pumpkin fan) likes them.  I half the recipe, but still use an entire egg.  I use regular sized chocolate chips and my oats are just "old fashioned rolled oats" rather than "quick" oats.  Highly recommend this recipe.

I had a half of a can of pumpkin purée left over from another recipe and these cookies looked like it would do the trick. Since I intended to make a full batch and a half can wouldn't be enough, I added 4 oz of plain low fat Greek yogurt to substitute the rest of the pumpkin.  It seemed to be heavy on the sugar so I left out 1/2 C of brown and 1/4 cup of white. The rest I prepared as directed. Delicious. The yogurt made the really fluffy and tall. Browned to perfection in 10 min.

Someone gave me this recipe years ago only the cookies are frosted with cream cheese frosting.  he frosting makes them out of this world and they are a family favorite that I make for all holidays.  Try  the frosting and maybe add extra chocolate chips.  Yum!

This is a fantastic recipe. Whenever I make these cookies, multiple people ask for the recipe. I use 2 t pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and always add some fresh nutmeg because I love it. I also use butterscotch chips instead of chocolate.

Wonderful! Simple and delicious - I just replaced chocolate chips with walnuts and cut a bit on the butter, still turned out awesome. I think next time ièll cut out a bit of the sugar. Thanks for the recipe.

These were fantastic. I didn't change anything. I even made them again to share with coworkers and neighbors because it makes so much. I will warn you, Because of the pumpkin, they get very soft and might stick together but it doesn't matter cause they are amazing!

I've made this many times and LOVE LOVE LOVE these cookies and so does whoever I choose to share them with :)They are so moist and delicious.  The only change I make is that I use Hershey's Cinnamon Chips instead of chocolate chips.  Also, I sometimes add some ground flax seed.  I usually cook a little longer than the 10-12 minutes.

The first time I made them. I followed recipie, except I deleted 1 cup of brown sugar and added walnuts. Soooo addicting. It's a good thing I gave away 3dozen. Lol the second time I made these. T halved the recipie. Still using one egg . I upped the oats by half, used Apple butter instead  of pumpkin, raisins instead of chips and walnuts. That's how versital this recipie is yum yum

I didn't like the texture of these and they didn't have near enough flavor. I'll probably try making pumpkin bars next since I don't know how I would ever get the texture of these right.

This are DELISH!!  I used BANANAS instead of pumpkin.  I've been looking for a yummy banana choc chip recipe and found one here!  I also made some healthier subs:  used only 1/2 c. butter and 1 c. applesauce and half white and half whole wheat flour.  Also cut out a third amount of sugar.  Bananas are so sweet as it is, we needed less sugar and will probably use even less next time.  Delicious consistency and great taste!  Thanks for a wonderful new recipe!  Definitly a keeper!

These are fabulous! I'm a pumpkin-crazy cook in the fall...and I wasn't sure about pumpkin mixed with chocolate, but I'm glad I added the chocolate chips at the last minute. So delicious! I also go a little crazy with the spices whenever pumpkin is involved, so in addition to the cinnamon I added nutmeg, cloves and allspice. I'll be making this recipe again!

This is a terrific cookie- easily adaptable- like many of the other reviewers I added and tweaked the recipe and the cookies came out wonderful

I used raisins - although cranberries would have worked just as well- and added a tsp of allspice.

also- I flattened the cookies before baking with a flat bottom glass that I had dampened and dipped in sugar- this gave the cookie a little crispiness when you bite into it- 
next time will add apple butter instead of applesauce to replace fat- hmmmmmmmmm

I used 1/2 Cup of Butter, and 1 Cup of Apple Sauce, to cut down on the fat content.  The cookies turned out well.  They're soft, and a bit cake-like, like the type of pumpkin cookies that you normally see iced.

In a word: YUM! These cookies are delicious! I used regular oats and dark chocolate chips(all I had on hand) plus I took the suggestion from other reviewers to add 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. Due to a dairy allergy I used 1 cup canola oil instead of butter and mine turned out to be very soft, almost cake-like. I usually prefer a crunchy cookie but the flavor is outstanding so with these it didn't matter!

These are delicious and make lots for sharing! Added some extra spices as others did (nutmeg, ginger, cloves) and added 1/2 cup walnuts, otherwise, followed to a "t". I was a bit concerned after I got all the wet blended together; the mixture looked a bit curdled. I knew that all my ingredients were fresh, so I soldiered on and it all went fine. Next time I may try a combo of dried cranberries/raisins/walnuts, even though the chocolate and pumpkin flavour is pretty awesome. Thanks for the recipe!!

My family's new favorite cookie. These cookies are so moist. They are not dry like some oatmeal cookies. I always add a bit more of the spices because I love the pu,pkin flavor so much. ENJOY!

These are soft, cake-like cookies - very good.  I'd bet that it wouldn't hurt to take out some of the butter and would result in a bit crispier oatmeal cookie, if you like that.  Fun with the pumpkin!

Delicious!  I tweaked it and it still came out great.  I added extra spices for fun (clove, ginger, cardamon, and nutmeg).  Half the flour was all-purpose and the other half was fresh ground, whole wheat pastry flour.  Also, I used chopped walnuts instead of the chocolate chips.  And I used sucanat for the brown sugar and omitted the white sugar per another reviewer advice.  Sweet enough for us!

Cookies are wonderful.  I only added 1 tsp of cinnamon and added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and used cinnamon chips instead of the chocolate chips.  I also added dried cranberries (about 1 cup).

Made it just as written.  I think it was a little too much flour,  I'd decrease it by a half a cup if I made it again.  It was good for
pumpkin cookies, I'm not a big fan but my kids are and I made them for them.  They did say they weren't like regular pumpkin chocolate chip cookies and they would rather have those.  I liked these better, personally, they have less of a cake-like texture more like cookies.

Followed recipe with scant sugar amounts and plenty sweet. Recommend blotting pumpkin in a paper towel lined sieve...you’ll be amazed how much liquid drains off even the most solid pumpkin  otherwise I imagine the dough would have been much too wet. Perfect amount of pumpkin flavor!

These cookies are so delicious! A favorite of picky eaters, those that love a flavor burst, and even the simple flavor savors. Cook them a little less and they are move gooey with a little extra pumpkin punch, my personal favorite, cook them a little more and you get a fluffy picturesque cookie. The recipe is great for non extract measurements, a little of this and that and it still comes out great.

Great recipe, I cooked these for 25 mins in a jelly roll pan. Turned out perfectly. I also put my own spin on this. Still did 2 cups of filling, but used semi-sweet, and white chocolate chips, craisins and pecans. I'm calling them Thanksgiving bar cookies. And Everyone is loving them. Made them again for my kid's Thanksgiving party this year.

I used dark coconut sugar instead of brown sugar and powdered sugar instead of granulated white sugar.  Apparently, it doesn't matter, as long as it is sugar!  I would definitely make it again.  The cookies were a big hit at the office!

it was pretty good. My missionary companion and I made them for people we are teaching and awesome people in our ward who needed a treat. Our bishop told us to never make them again because they were so good. And our favorite homeless lady gave us the compliment of we will be amazing wives one day. They were just that good.
I would highly suggest making dozens, because as our bishop stated: you can't have just one.

I will definitely make these again.  They were delicious.  My 18 year old son even loved them (and he's not a huge fan of pumpkin) - Everyone I shared them with, loved how soft and chewy they were - SO good!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Awesome flavor and these do spread out a bit so leave some room between them. I used a small ice am scoop and placed them 4 across and 3 down, baked  for 30 minutes.  I also used 1 cup chocolate chips, 1/2 cup crushed walnuts and about 1/2 cup of yellow raisins. They are cake like cookies and are fine alone but some frosting would have made them more awesome!  Definitely try it!

I make jack o lantern cookies and couldn’t find my usual recipe so I cooked up a batch. Found them to be a little too cake like for my use.

I think this is a keeper!! My only suggestion would be to add more salt and spice as it needed a little more flavor. But otherwise this was great!!

I made three changes:   I used Kosher salt. Not regular salt.  I did not use mini chocolate chips. This is a robust cookie, and I used a more robust and larger chocolate chip. I used the  Ghirardelli chocolate Premium Baking Chips  "Grand Chips" semi-sweet chocolate chips. The chips are double the size of  regular chocolate chips.   
The other change I made was using Crisco shortening instead of butter. I used the standard exchange guidance printed on the can. ! 1/2 cups butter = ! 1/2 cups shortening plus 3 tablespoons of water.   The chocolate chips gave melty chocolate flavor and positive distance from  the indifferent quick cook oats and all that pumpkin.   I used a two tablespoon scoop and I did not oil the cookie sheet   The cookies came up fine from the hot cookie sheet onto a cooling rack. Next time I will use Kerrygold salted butter to see if that unifies and elevates this interesting cookie.   and I will leave out the cinnamon or reduce the teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon.  The cinnamon needs to be "quieter" in this cookie to let the total flavors come together.

Great recipe! I made a few substitutions to make these a little bit healthier without sacrificing the taste:
-replaced 2 cups of flour with Kodiak cakes mix. I divided the baking soda and baking powder in half, since Kodiak cakes already contain leavening
-replaced 1/2 cup of the butter with 1/4 plain nonfat Greek yogurt. You probably could replace a bit more.
-Cut the brown sugar to 1.5 cups and the white sugar to somewhere around 3/4 cups. Again, probably could reduce a little bit more, but not much less.

This made 7 dozen reasonably sized cookies for me!

YUM. YUM. YUMMY! Wonderful cake like texture.  I added a 1/4 teaspoon of each of the following; ginger, ground cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Regular sized chocolate chip were used in the mix They baked for 13 minutes in electric oven at 375.  Then cooled for 2 minutes on baking sheet before moving to a cooling rack. House smelled amazing and the cookies did not disappoint.

I LOVE this recipe. I have been using it for years and honestly I don't think I have made any other type of cookie since! I love the heartier texture of these cookies over the typical cakey pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. It also tastes great using whole wheat flour, and I sometimes like to add some shredded coconut as well. So yummy!

Added cloves, nutmeg, ginger, and all spice for more flavour. The texture was not good.. more like a muffin top as opposed to a cookie.

I made these cookies and loved the final product! I was looking for something with less butter and sugar and a little more wholesome, so these are the changes I made: 1) substituted 1/2 of the flour with wheat flour 2) used a mashed ripe banana in place of 1/2 cup of the butter 3) added a couple of extra teaspoons of cinnamon and added pumpkin pie spice 4) added walnuts and 5) did NOT add the white sugar. Overall, the texture was great, and these were a yummy and almost guilt-free snack for me and my kiddos. We keep them in the freezer and microwave for 30 seconds to make them warm. Plenty sweet and very tasty!

Will make it again.  Subbed out 1/2 cup of the flour with 3/8 c of ground flax seed and 2T of gluten.  Used ground nutmeg in place of pumpkin pie spice.  Added in 2 T of whole pumpkin seeds.

Great flavor!  I still found them "cakey" compared to other cookies, but the flavor was a hit.   I took one reviewers advise and cut out the white sugar and changed one cup of white flour to wheat flour.   My family loved them.  The second time I made them, I added 1/2 cup flax meal, another egg, another 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger and made them into muffins.  Yum!  This is a really versatile recipe.

Will definitely use this recipe again!  Was looking for a cookie  combining oatmeal and pumpkin and this is great.  Omitted the chocolate but will try adding it another time.  Like some other reviewers I wanted to add pumpkin pie spice but since I didn't have any I kept cinnamon as is and added 1/4 teaspoon each of ginger, allspice & nutmeg.  Would have also added cloves but didn't have any.  Toasted the oatmeal because we like the nuttiness that adds.  Many requests to add this recipe to the repeat list, definitely a keeper!

We love to make these cookies every Autumn!  They are now a tradition for our family.   Adding the oatmeal makes this recipe the best / better recipe than the others because the cookies are  more firm - less cake like sticky.  And it also makes 70 - 80 cookies depending on your size.  We sometimes freeze the extras and save them for Halloween, Thanksgiving, or Christmas.   Enjoy!!

This is the first pumpkin cookie I've ever liked.  I used full size chocolate chips, and I cooked them longer 15-16 minutes, though some I forgot and left I around 20 were good in a slightly carmalized crunchy way.   It has to be the oatmeal that is making the difference.  Excellent texture, and easily switched for butter chocolate chip cookies.

Fantastic cookie that is soft and a little "bready", which I really like.  I have a 4 year old gluten sensitive child and just substituted the white flour with a gluten-free mix.  Usually this results in a grainy/gritty texture that I don't much care for.  (Baking gluten-free is a real struggle especially when I can almost always tell the difference and don't like it).  In this case, thanks to the pumpkin it comes across just fine.  Will be making these again!

I'm something of a pumpkin freak so I've eaten and made a LOT of pumpkin cookies, but these were by far the best.  Just enough oatmeal for texture without becoming an oatmeal cookie.  I did increase the amount of spice, but that just personal preference.

These are great! Used half whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup each butter, coconut oil and applesauce. Used regular chocolate chips because I didn't have the minis. Not as cakey as other pumpkin cookies- would like to cut back on the baking powder to see if that makes them less puffy... will definitely make again.

oh so good! We like crunchy cookies at our house.  I baked for the max time and there was just the slightest crunch on the outside.  Only change was adding 1 tsp pumpkin spice in addition to the 2 tsp cinnamon.  Next time I'll add more oats.  thank you for this recipe. Marked as a favorite!

Incredible cookies!!! I made these tonight, and followed the recipe to a T—no substitutions. I used a cookie scoop so they were all uniform in size. They fluffed up so nicely and almost had the consistency of muffin tops. Definitely will make these again!

Very yummy. Like others, I used butter alternates (butter, coconut oil, and apple sauce), halved both sugars, and added extra oats. Even my husband enjoyed them, and he is not very into desserts.

Delicious cookies! I did make a few changes but only to the final addition. I am not a fan of chocolate chips in pumpkin cookies so I substituted craisins. I also added walnuts. But the basic recipe is wonderful. Makes a large batch.

Just made these and they are delicious! I subbed coconut oil for the butter just because I had some that needed to be used. I bet you could leave out the chocolate chips and add dried cranberries and chopped nuts and that would be great too.

These were just okay.  I was surprised by the number of really great reviews.  I followed a lot of the other reviewers' suggestions for increasing the oats and chocolate chips and decreasing the sugar.  I even increased the pumpkin amount to give more pumpkin flavor, but overall, the cookie didn't taste that great

I made these as I needed to find a way to use up about a cup of steamed butternut squash as I had that leftover from making winter squash rolls. Like others, I halved the recipe as it makes a HUGE batch. We still ended up with over 4 dozen small-medium cookies. So, I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin, coconut oil for 2/3 of the butter, egg white only for the egg and regular size dark chocolate chunks.  I omitted the spices except the cinnamon. My 8 year old daughter pronounced them - SOOO good. I didn't tell her they were made with squash. They really are delicious.

Bomb cookies! I used Crisco butter sticks because it keeps the cookie shape, and well it's a cookie-might as well calorie commit! Dark chocolate regular chips and some pumpkin pie spice with extra cinnamon made these killer. MAKE THESE PEOPLE, life's too short.

Perfect on this snowy day! I love the texture of the added oatmeal. A soft cookie with a chewiness to it. I used one teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of the 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.

These turned out awesome! I only made a few changes, because I ran out of stuff.   I used 2 cups all purpose flour and 2 cups whole wheat flour. I decreased brown sugar to 1/2 cup (that's all I had on hand), but left white sugar at 1 cup (they were perfect...so no need for all the sugar, so I would definitely make them like this again. I also used homemade pumpkin puree, from our Halloween pumpkins.  I also used both white chocolate chips and milk chocolate chips (again, all I had).  They turn out DELISH!! :)

I love the traditional cake-like pumpkin cookies but wanted a recipe that was  sturdier so I could mail them.  These are it -- still  fluffy but not so moist as the others. Kind of a cross between the traditional pumpkin cookie and a chewy choc chip cookie. The oatmeal almost disappears. I added more spices and used a whole bag of white choc chips.  I flattened them with a wet butter knife and sprinkled them with orange sugar. I got 4+ dozen with half the recipe using a melon ball-type cookie scoop. They could be great bake-sale cookies if made extra large! Wonderful results!

I am not crazy about pumpkin, so I am a tough critic! :) I thought they were ok, they were light and not too heavy.
Recipe rendered a ton of cookie dough and by the end of making it there was too much for the mixer to handle and I had to use a wooden spoon to get it all combined. I added salt bc I always like a little contrast to the sweet. All in all, pretty good!

This recipe is delicious. But if you make it, cut all measurements in half. This makes enough cookies to feed an army. Bring some to a homeless shelter or soup kitchen or something. Also, use more oats. It definitely does not call for enough to call them oatmeal cookies. Walnuts and raisins make them better. And for more flavor, use pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and a bit more vanilla extract.

These were some of the best cookies I've ever made!  They were *exactly* what I was looking for - a chewy oatmeal cookie with pumpkin and chocolate flavors.  Next time, I might add some chopped walnuts or pecans.  Thanks for sharing!

Used a little more than 15 oz pumpkin puree (about 17 oz).  Used margarine instead of butter... delicious!!!  Cake-like texture; baking time was perfect at 12 minutes.

I also made several healthy substitutions and the cookies still turned out great! I reduced the sugars by 1/2 cup each, replaced 1 cup of the butter with 1/2 cup each melted coconut oil and applesauce, subbed 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat flour, increased the oats (old fashioned) to 3 cups, and added 1 cup chopped walnuts. I decided to go with normal sized semi-sweet chocolate chips, and upped that to 3 cups. The batter was a little gooey and the cookies didn't flatten at all on their own while baking. Once I flattened the balls of dough with a fork before baking, they turned out perfectly!

Only change I made was to add a tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Very good cookies, a bit heartier than the typical cake pumpkin cookie.

The cookies are wonderful and a good change from the usual choc chip.  I did add the walnuts and loves the texture as well as they added additional flavor.  I plan on freezing some and taking to our family party, they will be a welcome change from so many ultra sweet treats!  Will definitely make them again.

Made it with only 2 of the 3 cups of sugar, used pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin purée because I bought the wrong one. Lol

After reading other reviews, I made the following modifications:
* Substituted white whole wheat flour for half of the white flour (healthier)
* Used heaping cups of oatmeal (instead of level cups)
* Added 1/4 tsp. each of nutmeg, allspice, ginger, and ground cloves
* Used regular chips just because I didn't have mini chips
They turned out delicious -- nice and moist -- especially if you take them out of the oven while they still look underdone.

The cookies were great; soft and moist. I got around 8 dozen from this reciepe and my family loved them. The original recipe didn't have enough chocolate chips for me so I added another bag and also used dark chocolate chips instead of the milk chocolate which went extremely well with the pumpkin pumpkin. Next time I make these I will be doing equal parts quick oats and rolled oats for a little more texture.

Cut the sugar down by 1/3.  I added another egg, and instead of cookies, I baked it in a 1/2 sheet tray (a.k.a. jelly roll pan) and baked for 30 minutes.  They turned out great.  Next time I may add nuts.  My 8 kids inhaled them!  It's a keeper recipe for sure.

These cookies are lovely! Light and soft and tasty and chewy- everything a cookie like this should be! My only substitute was replacing one cup of the butter with one cup of Crisco- because butter has gotten so expensive. I also added a 1/4 tsp. allspice and a dash of nutmeg because I love my spices. Awesome recipe!!

The pumpkin flavor was not very intense. I felt like the batter was too wet, so I added 1 more cup of oats and the chocolate chips were sparse, so I added 1.5c more. I won't make them again. It wasn't what I was looking for.

Yummy, good texture, soft, airy and spicy. I used a lot of cloves and allspice, and a freshly-roasted local butternut squash. Thick, rich fresh squash (roasted in the oven) will likely enhance both the flavour and the texture.

I took some hints from others and substituted 1 c coconut oil, 1/2c organic buttery spread for the butter. Reduced white sugar to 1/2 c.  Added additional spice 1 tsp cloves, 1 tsp all spice and some fresh ground nutmeg.  also substituted 1 c white flour with ground flax. Amazing!

Almost made according to directions. The recipe has a nice mild flavor without the often overpowering spices. As recommended by other reviews, I added a pinch of ginger, nutmeg and cloves. Instead of the chocolate chips, I used a bag 1 2/3 C of butterscotch chips. It was a very nice flavor blend. Definitely adding this to my collection!

These were delicious and I made them without any changes to the above recipe.  I was looking for a new twist on an ol' standby and really enjoyed this.  I liked that it was not an overwhelming pumpkin flavor. It was mild and balanced nicely with the other flavors.  It was a soft batch type of cookies that disappeared quickly at my church function and at home!

Really good, but I did make some changes. I used coconut oil instead of butter, one cup of brown sugar, rapadura instead of white sugar, pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin puree, two cups of whole wheat flour and two cups white, and added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.

Great taste. A little on the "cakey" side. I like my cookies more on the chewy side. The cookies stayed in the dome shape of the cookie scooper, so flatten them with a spoon. I also added some chopped dried cranberry's.

Just made these, some are still in the oven. I made them exactly as written but instead of mini-chips, I used regular as that was all I had in the house. It's a good, sweet cookie. It's hard to detect the pumpkin in my opinion. If I make them again, I'd add more oats and more pumpkin/spices. My family loved them though, not overly pumpkiny and all...

Very good! Didn't change a thing and am loving them with coffee. Perfect way to start the fall!
