I didn’t want a full 9x13 pan so I halved the recipe.  Although I have the green variety of rhubarb, it still made a lovely presentation using my tart pan.  As is my norm, I doubled the amount of fruit, therefore I increased the sugar by 50%.  It came out great but I may decrease the amount of rhubarb by a smidgeon the next time.  I thought this was actually better the next day. It’s a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the suggestions and finely chopped the rhubarb and the coconut. Because I was taking this on a family vacation (where there was an oven), I did some prep work to simplify things in the kitchen. I baked the crust in a 9 x 13 before hand and added the filling and baked it at the time share. I added the zest of one small lemon to the crust - I wanted to make sure that there was enough sour. Everyone enjoyed it. In the ;9 x 13, it made 12 nice sized bars. I did take the wrapper of the butter and grease the pan, just to ensure no sticking...pieces came out great!

I made this and loved it. I did the following: used Coconut Palm Sugar in the crust, white sugar in the filling, finely shredded coconut (the texture worked fine for my tastes), fresh squeezed lemon juice (what I had), approximately 3 cups of sliced, fresh rhubarb and added about 2 T of my own honey to the filling (based on sweetness comments in the reviews). I baked the crust for 25 minutes. I baked the filled crust for 30 minutes at 350 and 15 minutes at 250 with the pan covered with foil. I wasn't sure if the rhubarb was cooked enough and wanted to be tender, not crunchy.  I can't wait to make it again. I may switch out the lemon juice for pineapple juice and add crushed pineapple. Thank you for a yummy new dessert.

Delicious!  Great crust, tart, fresh filling that set up beautifully for us even though we couldn't wait and cut slices right away. Our rhubarb was green too and we didn't have quite enough, so we threw in a few frozen cherries and they added a pretty touch of color.

Thanks for sharing!

This was quite good.  I made this in a proper 9x13 pan, lined with parchment.  It's a nice thick crust to support the topping.  I'd suggest cutting the first bake of just the crust to 20 minutes max, and I think this recipe is remiss in not including the use of the lemon's zest for true lemony flavour.  I added the zest of 1 lemon in the egg/sugar/flour mixture and would highly recommend that.

I really liked this but I changed a few things so I can't give it five stars as is. I added sweetened shredded coconut and only about 4tbsp lemon which came out as the perfect sweetness! I also used frozen rhubarb and included the juice from the chopping. I ended up with a 9x13 pan and about 14 mini muffins.

I also halved the recipe , but still  doubled the rhubarb (4 c.)  and upped the sugar (to 1 1/2 c.)  and cooked it in a big pie tin and so it took slightly longer to set.  I loved the shortbread crust in contrast to the tart creamy filling. The coconut and rhubarb go great together...maybe next time I will double that too.  The lemon mellowed and I think this is better the second day.  This is going to be a regular rhubarb treat.  Thanks from a rhubarb lover.

I added more rhubarb because we are rhubarb fanatics and  a bit more sugar.
I also added fresh lemon slices instead of the juice.... just because I had a lemon I needed to use up.

But neither of those items really changed the dish at all and it was fantastic! Easy to prepare and super easy to feast on !
Now look for the Blueberry Square they sent the other day. Another delicious dessert. This one I doubled and shared !  Delish !  Well, I shared the lemon dessert as well. I seem to do that a lot !
Now on to rhubarb slice.  So much fun !

This was fabulous! I added one extra lemon and instead of sugar I used icing sugar for the crust to mimic a true shortbread crust! Loved it and it was so easy!

I love lemon bars and rhubarb so had to try this.  Followed the recipe as written except I did as someone had suggested and put the chopped rhubarb (~3\4” chunks) in the food processor and pulsed it a few times to make the chunks smaller.  Mine turned out with a little more red than the photo with the recipe.  It wasn’t as tart as I expected so next time I’ll add more lemon juice.  Took it to a meeting at church and received many nice comments as well as requests for the recipe.

These turned out very well.  I did run the rhubarb and the coconut through the food processor as recommended and I don't  think they'd have been as good if I hadn't.  I only gave four stars instead of five because digging out the food processor is a pain and there are easier bar cookies out there.

I really liked the lemon flavor with coconut and start rhubarb.  The cookie like bottom was good.  I added a handful of chopped strawberries that needed to be used.
Will make again

Though the crust was tasty, it was too thick for the amount of fruit - and I used 3 cups of rhubarbs and several cut up cherries.  But it tasted good and the recipe has potential.  Next time, I'll use more rhubarb, more lemon or add a bit of lemon oil.  The reviewer who cut back each of the baking times by 5 minutes was probably right; I had difficulty getting some of the bars out of the pan.  I might put the coconut into a food processor to chop it into finer pieces also.  BTW, that photo doesn't look as if a 9" X 12" pan was used!
