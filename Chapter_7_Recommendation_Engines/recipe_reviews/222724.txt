Other than using reduced fat mayonnaise and adding a little garlic powder and fresh ground pepper, I made no other changes. This is simple and very delicious. The amounts of everything in this dip is spot on. This is EXCELLENT. NOTE: I made this last night and let it set in the fridge until this morning. I had this spread on sliced cucumbers for breakfast.

ramps or leeks, whichever name you prefer, the wild ones are delish.  i have been making ramp dip for years.  w/a hand emersion blender, take 24 oz of sr cream, three cups of leeks, tops removed.  blend till the ramps are fine.  add three 8oz cream cheese, room temp.  one Tbs mayo, dash of worchestershire, splash of vinegar and blend till thick and creamy. low fat ing. work well too.  keeps couple weeks refrigerated.
your idea of cheese ball is great, you can bet that next time i get ramps, i will be throwing a cheese ball together!
ramps can also be picked in fall before the ground freezes.  they are hotter than if picked in the spring.  wild turkeys love them.
thanks cookin'mama08

My husband brought me a ton of ramps home from his trek in the woods. Ramps were new to me so I turned to Allrecipes for inspiration as I always do. I love a good snack so I whipped up this dip. I allowed it to sit in the refrigerator overnight so the flavors had time to meld. Whoa nelly! I found my ramps left this dip with a very strong flavor. I would reduce the amount of ramps next time. After refrigeration this dip would shape nicely as a cheeseball as mentioned. If you want it spreadable leave it out at room temperature for about 1/2 hour.
