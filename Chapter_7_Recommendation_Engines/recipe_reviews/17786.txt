my co-worker are trying this recipe and they have lose 15 pound in almost a month. They use lipton soup intead of onion soup and  to give it a kick they added a can of mexican tomatoes (tomatoes and jalapenos). I try it and it is good, only I cooked it for the weekends.

This wasn't bad. But lets face it, this soup is more meant as a way to keep an eye on weight more than it is on taste - which isn't bad, just different. Next time I am going to try some different veggies. I will also try halfing the garlic (a bit overpowering) and using a can of italian seasoned tomatos.

This soup is amazing.  I would have never known it was a "lite" soup if I hadn't read the recipe.  I think it would also be excellent with small noodles (though obviously not as slimming)

The only reason I give this recipe three stars is for being very healthy.  It was very bland, and I like lots of flavor.  I don't think I will make this again.

Very good, though I may have damaged the 'slimming' qualities; I tossed in a little cooked chicken that I had on hand, as well as a bit of cooked rice.  Instead of bouillon cubes, I use chicken base or homemade stock if I have it on hand.  Omitted the green bell pepper b/c I'm not a big fan.  Upped the spices, added some fresh ground pepper. Thanks for a great lunch!

The basic recipe has pretty good flavor for a low calorie soup.  I upped the herbs and saute'd the onion, garlic, carrot and celery in olive oil prior to adding the broth.  I also added some cayenne pepper to give it a little heat.

I love this recipe, very tasty. I added more condiments like paprika and cumin for a bit of more flavor and got a reduced sodium chicken stock instead. Wonderful! thank you very much I´m having this dinner for the whole week!

Excellent, easy to make soup.   I made as directed and I wasn't disappointed.   The next time I might add in the basil and Italian seasoning in the last 15 minutes, because while tasting, I think I liked it just a little better when it didn't have a chance to totally be absorbed into the other flavors.

I didn't change anything in the first batch and it was YUMMY!  The second batch I chopped a fire roasted jalapeño up in it and the little added heat added just a little more deliciousness!  This is a keeper.

I keep this on hand and eat it when I want to do mindless snacking and I eat a bowl before I eat a meal. Since it contains a lot of “negative calorie” veggies It is good at filling you up without all the calories. However, I don’t add root veggies (carrots, onions, potatoes and such) since those are high in starches, I add onion/garlic powder instead. I will boil carrots in big chunks and fish them out later. I do add a variety of squashes, broccoli, cauliflower, etc. for added bulk. It is also high in antioxidants so eat up when you get sick! I skip the bullion because I don’t like the flavor and use bone broth instead, better for you anyway. Load up on the spices. I mix up the spices for something different

I’ve made this soup several times now. I’ve tweaked the recipe bit. I use 2-32oz chicken broths instead of bullion (to much msg for my liking) I use the whole head of cabbage, not just 2c. And I increase basil and Italian seasonings by 1/2tsp.  I also add 1 lb cooked ground beef. Hearty and high protein. Very filling.

For a fast and easy to put together meal this is great!  The vegetables are a bit firm but gives a nice chew.  Usually I would saute my vegetables first before adding the broth, but that is what makes this soup so fast because you add it all together in a pot and cook. I add fresh herbs like basil, oregano. Also a bit of poultry seasoning and lots of  of garlic.  If you really want to bulk it up add a can of white beans and a some pasta.

As other reviewers said, this is very bland. I used broth instead of plain water. I had to add a lot of spice to get some heat and it desperately needs salt. If your goal is to lose weight (mine isn't I just love soup) than there are better similar recipes on this site. I suggest Cabbage Fat-Burning Soup by Neil Marsh.

I made this recipe last night and love it.  I ended up adding extra cabbage, water, and 1 extra bouillon cube.  I also added up 10 cut up slices of turkey bacon.  I cooked mine a little longer too because I like my veggies nice and soft.  The only thing I would do different next time is to add diced tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes.

This is a great, tasty, healthy recipe.  I used low sodium chicken broth instead of the chicken bouillon and water.  Instead of canned stewed tomatoes I used canned (no salt added) italian style diced tomatoes.  In addition to the onion, celery, and bell pepper, I threw in some carrots and shredded rotisserie chicken.  It was delicious.  It tastes even better the next day.  Thanks for a great recipe
