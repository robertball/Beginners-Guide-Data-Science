Simple and delicious! I put all of the spices, except the cinnamon sticks, in a coffee filter and tied it off with a hair tie to make it like a little tea bag. I squeezed a little orange juice in it, too. Two hours on low in the crock pot and voila! It was delicious.

I wanted to have some wine while doing my Christmas cooking, but I was chilly and wanted something warm, so thought I'd make this mulled wine, which would give an added bonus of a really good smelling kitchen. I used a $10 bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and followed the instructions as written. It was excellent! It cooks down and some of the alcohol cooks off, so was able to have a whole bottle without getting too drunk to finish my cooking. Can't wait to make it again!

I used a red wine blend for this recipe and won first place in a cocktail competition with it! I had to double the recipe and it worked really well. It's become a staple of our winter cocktail list.

I used Cabernet Sauvignon for this and it came out great. I strained all the wine to serve and then put some cloves, cardamom, and anise seed in individual tea strainers for  each person to add as much or as little as they like. Very tasty.
