My kids LOVED IT!!!  Next time I might try softened cream cheese instead of sour cream.

A couple of comments sounded like some people wanted more flavor. Just cut the sour cream in half and add a can of cream of mushroom soup. It makes this recipe pop!

SUPER EASY! ...But not a great hit with our family. We used cubed potatoes, which I think was much better than hashbrowns would have been.  It was lacking something... can't quite put my finger on it! The sausage's smokiness overpowered the blandness of the cheesy potatoes. It worked great since I had the ingredients and needed something quick, but I'm not sure we'll resort to this recipe again.

This was an amazing recipe! I wanted to try something besides just frying up the sausage, and I am glad I did! I have also tried it with tater tots instead of hashbrowns, and that is good too! We also found that adding hotsauce and mustard gives it a little kick.

The flavor was OK.  It filled up our tummys, but that was about it.  Definately will not make again.

This recipe is a big hit in our family.  I "lighten" it up with fat free sour cream & cheddar and use turkey sausage.  My husband eats multiple servings.  So I've learned to cut it into 6 servings & top each with a fried egg.  Hits the spot!  Thanks for sharing!

Simple and delecious. I used finely diced potatoes in place of the frozen hash browns but that's the only change I made. I liked this but I think I like just plain old sausage potatoes and onions a little better, but the family devoured it so I guess it's a keeper!!

I was looking for a recipe that called for Italian sausage and came across this one.  I knew it would come out completely different, but I tried it anyway.  I used a slightly spicy Italian sausage and also added mushrooms.  It actually turned out pretty good!  A little oily, but that is to be expected given my ingredients.  I didn't have as many potatoes as it called for, so my version would have been good with maybe rice, or more potatoes.  I served it with veggies and cheese bread.  My husband also said it would make a great breakfast recipe if we added eggs.  I'm anxious to try it again with the correct sausage or maybe Kielbasa.  Thanks!

I thought it was very good and super simple and easy to make..I used shredded Simply Potatoes southwestern style potatoes and a purple onion..It was easier to mix everything together when you put it in a bigger mixing bowl then transfer it to a 13x9 baking pan..I was a little heavy handed on the pepper, I didn't measure that to be honest. It was other wise a good recipe that will definately get use again in my house because we had none left..so certainly that means it was good and a crowd pleaser!

It was difficult to mix everything together evenly, so some areas had a lot of cheese or a lot of sour cream. I used cubed hash browns, which I think was a mistake. It didn't seem to absorb mositure as well, so there was a lot of liquid at the bottom of the pan. The TASTE however, was great. I used turkey sausage to cut back on calories. I think it would have come out much better had I used the recommended shredded hash browns.

I used some of the ideas from other reviewers. I used potatoes O’Brien and added a can of Campbell’s cheddar soup. After cooking for a half hour I sprinkled more cheddar cheese on top and baked for 15 more minutes.

This was delicious and easy!  I was on a mission to use food I already had on hand and this worked great!  Others had suggested sour cream or soups which would definitely work. I had a full package of frozen breakfast potatoes, 1/2 cup of sour cream,  1/2 block of cream cheese, 1/2 stick of butter, 1 half onion, and full Hillshire sausage.  I added in a dash of hot mustard, a few drops of Frank's got sauce, onion salt, and a dash of worcestershire.  You could easily add more veggies to this to make it more healthy.

Both my husband and I really liked this recipe!  I used turkey smoke sausage and Garlic & Herb hashbrowns.  It was very good served with garlic bread.

Tried substituting with frozen hashbrowns--bad idea!  Also, the sour cream was a bad idea.  If I made it again, I might add a cream soup, and I would definitely add salt and garlic powder.

This was delicious. Found smoked sausage on sale for a ridiculously low price so I bought several packages. Found this recipe and decided to try it. We like the onion taste, but not the texture. I replaced the onion with 1/4 teaspoon of powdered onion and added 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder.
