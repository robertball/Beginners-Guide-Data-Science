This is a nice recipe!  I don't have a bread maker so I did it this way for 2 loaves.  2 cups of warm water with 6 tbsp of honey dissolved in it.  then sprinkle 2 1/4 tsp of yeast and let proof for 10 minutes.  Then add 1/4 cup of oil and 1 1/2 tsp salt.  Then all your flour (I used about 5 cups, half whole wheat and half white) and seeds.  I also added hemp hearts which are high in omega 6 and omega 3 fats.  Then I let rise in a oiled bowl for 1 hour, punch down and divide into 2 loaves then let rise again for 45 min.  Bake at 375 for 30 minutes.  SOOO GOOD!!!

I have made this bread three times, once using butter as directed and twice substituting canola oil.  It has come out perfect every time!  I especially enjoy toasting the slices, as it really brings out the flavor in the seeds.  I live alone and can't eat all the bread before it gets stale, so I slice up the loaf and freeze it in a big Ziploc bag, then heat the slices in my toaster oven as needed.  Yum!!

I LIKE TO MAKE BREAD WITH MY KITCHEN AID MIXER AND THIS SOUNDED YUMMY SO HERE IS WHAT I DID: DISSOLE HONEY IN THE WATER(WARM) AND THEN PUT THE YEAST IN THE WATER MIXTURE TO ACTIVATE.  PUT ALL THE OTHER INCREDIENTS IN THE MIXER(WITH A DOUGH HOOK ON IT) EXCEPT THE SUNFLOWER SEEDS AND BUTTER(WELL I USED OIL INSTEAD) THEN ON LOW GRADUALLY ADD THE OIL AND YEAST MIXTURE.  MIX FOR ABOUT 7 MINUTES, MAY HAVE TO SCRAP SIDES.  THEN ADD THE SUNFLOWER SEEDS AND LET THEM MIX IN. I THEN ADDED A EXTRA 1/3 CUP OF WHEAT FLOUR BECAUSE IT WAS TOO STICKY. THEN I FORMED DOUGH INTO A LOAF AND PUT IT IN A GREASED LOAF PAN COVERED WITH PLASTIC WRAP TO RISE UNTIL DOUBLED IN SIZE.  BAKE AT 350 FOR 40 MINUTES.  TURNED OUT WONDERFUL!!

I don't own a bread machine and it was still an excellent bread!

To make this bread the conventional way:

Proof yeast in the warm water with honey (I heated the honey in the microwave for 30 seconds)
Combined all the dry ingredients including flour, flax and sunflower seeds in a large bowl.

Melted the butter an added that to the flour alongside the yeast. Combined and then kneaded the bread for 10 minutes or until the dough was smooth and my arms were about to fall off.

Set to rise in greased bowl for 1.5 hours or until doubled in size.

Punched it.

Transferred dough to a greased bread pan, covered and let rise again for 20 minutes.

Baked in a 350 oven for about 30 minutes. Removed from pan and if the bottom wasn't golden I flipped the bread and put it back in the oven until golden.

Removed, let cool on wire rack and now I'm enjoying it as we speak. So far best whole wheat bread ever!

Love this bread!  I use flax meal because the seed is so biounavailable to the body.  It took nothing away from this recipe.  I make it again and again as a sandwich bread.

I don't typically buy or like whole wheat breads, but the flax and sunflower intrigued me, as I like both. This turned out really well. In previous reviews, I've said that I don't like the way bread machine bread turns out, so I baked this in my oven. I set my bread machine on the dough cycle, followed the recipe and then put the dough in a greased stoneware loaf pan and let rise for about an hour. Then I baked at 350 for 10 minutes, rotated the pan 180 degrees, and baked for another 10 minutes. It came out perfectly. I wouldn't recommend doing what I did on the first loaf - I sprinkled flax seed on the top, because I thought it would be pretty. Unfortunately, they just don't stick. I'll just throw a handful into the mix next time. 

And, if you're unfamiliar with flax, you should know that it really should be ground up well. Your body cannot digest whole flax seed and you will not get the benefit of the flax unless you chew it up completely. It's much easier, and beneficial to grind it in a coffee grinder.

Thanks for a hearty, dense winter bread recipe Erna!

Delicious!  I will make this again soon to give away - I don't want to share this first batch!  I made this bread in the traditional manner, without the bread machine: 
1. proof yeast in 1/2 cup water
2. add yeast, additional water, honey, and butter to the mix of flour, salt, and seeds 3. knead by hand or in a sturdy mixer 
4. let rise one-hour, punch down and let rise 30 minutes
5. shape into two loaves and let rest 20 minutes 
6. bake at 400 degrees about 25 minutes.

This one is a good seed bread and it has exactly the chewy texture I like in a bread. I really don't think honey is overpowering in this recipe, but my sister thought it lacked a bit of salt, and I think she's right; next time, I'll increase salt to 1,5 teaspoon. Other than that, this recipe is perfect.

I made this bread today and it is delicious.  I often make flax seed bread, but the sunflowers in this made it really nutty tasting.  I also doubled the recipe, and made it by hand instead of the bread machine.  I used mostly whole wheat flour, added a bit more yeast and a couple tablespoons of my homemade dough enchancer.  My husband love it.  This is a keeper.  Lorraine Sturgis

Delicious! I'll be making this again soon in our new bread maker :)  I made a few alterations since I wanted a whole wheat loaf:    * I used only whole wheat flour    * I added about 2 1/2 tbsp. of vital wheat gluten since I read that would help when substituting for bread flour    * I used ground instead of whole flax seeds (since they're easier to digest)    * I added 1 tbsp. poppy seeds.    * I used buttermilk instead if water.    Definitely one of the best loaves of bread I've ever made.

I've made a lot of bread & this recipe is awesome. It's delicious! I used ground flax as others suggested. I don't have a bread machine, so I made it the old fashion way with a little elbow grease. Proofed the yeast in the honey/water for about 10 minutes, then added all the ingredients in no specific order in my Kitchen Aid mixer with a dough hook & let it do the work for about 10-15 minutes. Turned it out onto a floured surface & kneeded it a few more times. Made it into a ball & put it in an oiled bowl. Let it double (about 1.5 hrs), punched it down & made 2 loaves. 2nd rise took about an hour. Then baked them at 375 for about 30 minutes. To tell if it's done, tap the top & bottom & see if it sounds hollow. If you want to be extra sure, stick a digital thermometer in it & make sure it reads 190-200. I may have replaced my favorite store bought bread! If you like any of the store brands that are "grainy" (12 grain, 15 grain, etc.) then you will LOVE this.

I was searching for a home-made (more budget-friendly) version of "Dave's Bread," which costs $5 a loaf in the natural foods department at the local grocery.  This recipe comes pretty darn close to hitting the mark on the first try!  (Thank you to creator Erna Walmsley & the folks who have commented.) I do not have a bread machine, but used my kitchen-aid stand mixer and my oven.  I followed the comments by other All-Recipe members also:
1) dissolve 6T honey in 2c water, pour 1/2 into your mixer bowl & then sprinkle the yeast on water...wait for proof before adding the remaining water
2) mixed flours, & salt (& #3 additions) in separate bowl and then added by cup-full to running mixer
3) *I added 1/2 c rough-chopped oats, 1/4 c fine-ground almonds, 1/4 c wheat germ
4) mix thoroughly, add the butter/oil blend (abt 1/4 c)
5) added = amounts of the following seeds: flax seed, sunflower seed, & toasted sesame seed... save some to sprinkle on outside of loaf
6)  knead in mixer, then remove to oiled bowl to rise for an hour.  
7) Punch down, cut in 1/2, re-shape & pat remaining seed mixture (added a little wheat-germ to outside seed mix) then placed shaped loaf into greased & floured baking vessel.  
8) allow to rise another 1/2 hr, score top with a knife, and brush top with melted butter
9) bake @ 400 for about 25 min
10) remove & allow temp to drop before removing from pan to a cooling rack --or to a cutting board because this is the best time to taste-test!
Enjoy! ~K

This is my favorite bread. I make it at least once a week using whatever seeds I have around the house. I don't use a breadmaker. I add the honey and yeast to warm water and leave it for about 10 minutes then I mix together the rest of the ingredients and let it rise over night before cooking it for 30 minutes at 350. Yum!

I've just spent 16 hours trying to make this bread.  I realized early on that there isn't enough yeast in this recipe but decided to make it as is.  Well after mixing it together and letting it "rise" for 2 hours, nothing had happened.  Since it was evening, I figured I could lose nothing by letting it sit in my lighted oven overnight.  Yay!  it had risen when I checked it in the morning.  So then I punched it down and had to let it do the slow rise again in the bread pan.  I gave it about 2 1/2 hours and by the end of that time it had risen to the top of the pan but didn't have a bread dome.  I baked it for about 30 minutes at 350 in a glass loaf pan.  It looks in both composition and texture like a sweet bread.  I don't like the initial taste that I've had but I will give it another chance when it's cool.  If I make it again it will take some major tweaking.

All I can say is - Wow!  An artisan type bread for a fraction of the cost at your local bakery.  A few slight modifications:  used margarine rather than butter; used the dough cycle on the bread machine and baked the loaf at 350 degrees for approx. 30 minutes; needed to add a bit more whole wheat flour during the mix/knead cyle; and brushed with melted margarine once it came out of the oven.  Delicious and a definite recipe box keeper!!  Thanks for the great recipe, Erna.

Simply scrumptious!  We polished off the bread quickly - I'm making another loaf now so we'll have some for tomorrow.  I made the dough in the bread machine, kneaded in the sunflower seeds by hand, put it in a loaf pan, let it rise for a half hour and baked at 400 for 30 minutes. I am using raw sunflower seeds - on my first attempt last week I used roasted seeds, the oil had gone rancid and it ruined the flavor of the bread - make sure your ingredients are fresh! Update: I like to use 1/4 c sunflower and 1/4 chopped pumpkin seeds and flax meal. I use canola oil instead of butter. I also add 1/4 quick oats and 2 tsp wheat gluten.  Thanks for the recipe, it is a keeper!

I don't have a bread maker, so I altered the recipe a bit.  I combined 2 cups of warm water, 6 Tbsp of honey, and 1/4 cup of vegetable oil.  I combined 3 cups of wheat bread flour with 2 cups white bread flour, added 2 tsp of dry instant yeast(no proofing required), 1.5 tsp salt.  I then added about 1/3 cup cracked wheat, 1/2 cup sunflower seeds, and 1/2 cup of mixed whole and ground flax seeds.    I combined the wet and dry ingredients; stirred until everything was moistened.  I let it rise for about 3 hours until it was doubled in size.  I then split it into two equal parts, and gently kneaded it for a bit.  Shaped it into small loaf shapes, put them into the bread pans, and let them rise again for a few more hours until they're filling the pan.  Baked them at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.  They turned out perfectly!  This bread is awesome :)

Wonderful. Have made it three times, have barely changed a think. I use white wheat flour (King Arthur), which is so light, you really don't need to use any white flour at all. Also add a bit of wheat gluten (optional).  I use golden flax seed, which has a milder flavor than the standard, red/brown kind.

I have made a lot of recipes from this site, but this is the first time I have felt compelled to rate one.  This bread is fantastic!  This is a hearty bread without being overly heavy and has an excellent flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used slightly less flax and sunflower seeds as per other reviews, and I was pleased with the results.

Wonderful bread -- half of it was eaten in the first hour! Since the dough was a little wet I added dry milk to get it to the proper consistency -- that really made the bread extra rich and moist.  And all that flax seed makes it good for my cholesterol!

I made this bread in the bread machine on the dough cycle and took the advice of other and ground up the flax seed (I used the golden flax seeds).  After it was done, I took it out, put it in a glass bread pan sprayed with oil, cover with oiled saran wrap and put in oven with light on (for some heat) and it rose significantly in about 30 to 40 minutes.  I cooked it at 350 for 30 minutes and it turned out great--really rose high.  I coated the top with butter so the crust would not get hard.

This is an excellent bread. I have added the sunflower seeds at the beginning of the cycle and they are fine. I set this up at night with the timer and it is ready in the morning. I've also used 1/2 sunflower seeds and 1/2 pumpkin seeds. This was great if you like lots of seeds in your bread. I think it would be good with a bit of chopped nuts as well. All in all a great bread machine recipe that turns out every time. Thanks for this one.

excellent bread!  i tried this once with half white flour and half whole wheat flour, and a second time with all whole wheat flour.  it is better with half and half, the bread will rise better.  also, i threw in whatever nuts and seeds i had in the pantry, making this a very tasty and healthy bread!  enjoy!

I've ALWAYS made my own bread and recently (for at least the past 2 or 3 years) I've been trying very hard to incorporate "healthy" into my family's diet (better than middle aged couple, 3 adult children and -- as it stands right now -- 1 infant (the 4th most beautiful baby I have ever seen! :)) and another on the way). But this tasted really, really BAD (to us). I'm not attempting to blame the recipe -- the bread cooked up really nicely and, as far as I could tell, tasted exactly as it was supposed to. But NO ONE in my family liked it (on account of its flavor). I fed what remained of the loaf to our dog, and even SHE required that I mix in a can of Pedigree something or other before she would eat it. My guess is that my family is just not ready to go that far "natural" (or healthy) just yet. For who like it, I say good for you -- the loaf cooked up PERFECTLY as the recipe described it. And I would make it again -- if only ANYONE in my family enjoyed / appreciated the FLAVOR. Just my thoughts.

This bread is so good I would make sandwiches to take skiing all winter and had to start taking extra to feed friends who tried it.  I actually use less flax and sunflower seeds and it's still delicious

I added 1/4 cup of dry instant milk which a lot of bread machine cookbooks add. I put the flax seeds in the coffee grinder and cracked them a little. It is recommended to get the nutrients released. I changed from 1 teaspoon of active yeast to 1 1/2 teaspoons of bread machine yeast. Other cookbooks say to be sure the sunflower seeds are UNSALTED. It was perfect. Thanks for the recipe and other reviewers' comments.

O.M.G. This bread is outstanding! Bakes up beautifully and tastes wonderful. I used a ground flax mix because whole flax seeds pass through the digestive tract unable to absord the wonderful omegas flax is known for. I could not find whole wheat bread flour and used white whole wheat flour plus 2 tsp. of vital wheat gluten instead and reduced the honey down to 1.5 tablespoons. This recipe is a keeper and one I know I will make again.

Tasty bread! I don't have a bread machine so I used my KitchenAid stand mixer. I made three loaves: combined 9 c whole wheat flour, 1/2 c vital wheat gluten, 1.5 tbsp salt, 1 tbsp SAF-instant yeast, 1 c oats, 1/2 c ground flax seeds, and 1.5 c of my grain and seed mix in the bowl. (I buy the following grains and seeds in bulk and combine them in a big container in equal amounts: quinoa, spelt flakes, amaranth, hulled sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, yellow cornmeal, and millet.) To the dry mix I added 6 tbsp melted butter and 3/4 c honey, and started the mixer on speed 2. I gradually added in 4 c warm water (about 120 degrees), let it knead for ten minutes, and kneaded it by hand for a few minutes on a Silpat on my counter. To provide a warm environment for rising, I turn on the oven light. I put the dough in an oiled bowl and covered it with a damp cloth. As another reviewer said, I let it rise for an hour, punched it down, let it rise another half hour, and let the loaves rise for 20 minutes in the pans. 30 minutes at 350 degrees. They're cooling on a wire rack as I type this; they turned out a nice brown color, and I've had to take several breaks from typing to cut a slice. Delicious, light and fluffy... I can't tell that it's 100% whole wheat! I'll definitely be baking this bread again!

This is one of the best breads I've made! My husband adores it, and it's wonderful when toasted with some shredded mozzarella. The only alterations I've made are grinding the flax seeds on the pulse setting in my blender, and adding the sunflower seeds right at the start out of convenience. Never noticed much of a difference.

This bread is delicious!  It was very nutty and had good flavor.  I can't even really taste the yeast in the bread!  I don't have a bread machine, and so I tried making this by hand and I had some problems.  However, the bread turned out fine so I'm guessing it was okay.  I think my water was too hot for the yeast and it didn't poof as much and so when I let my dough rise for 45 min, it didn't rise that much.  But I thought o well, and let it bake anyway.  I also felt my dough was too wet when I mixed everything together so I had to add some extra flour.  Don't know if it affected it much, but it still tastes good.  All in all, a great recipe!

This is a great and easy Recipe. Actually my first Bread i did. Followed all advise about adding a little more flour and ground flax seed. I added also a little bread spices, like ground caraway and other. It is a little sweet for my taste, used to german style breads, but will leave the honey out next time, add maybe a little more salt and spices. Turned out just wonderful, great Texture, nice size Loaf. Thanks Erna! Anybody having a concern me leaving the honey out?

This is my current favorite, the best that  I have personally made in my Welbilt machine. The only variation that I recommend is that I use %100 ground flaxseed meal instead of whole seeds. You get all the goodnes and flavor but no dark spots in your teeth!

I have made this twice now. The second time I added a couple of tablespoons of millet as well. I use the dough cycle and finish it in the oven. It makes a high, attractive, delicious loaf. The only problem now is to stop myself making it too often and getting tired of it.

This is definitely a keeper!  The texture is amazing - chewy, with nice bubbling, and not too dense.  I modified it slightly, but this is probably going to be my most baked bread.  I used olive oil instead of butter, omitted the sunflower seeds, and used flax meal instead of flax seeds.  As one other reviewer said, whole flax seeds pass through mostly undigested so the nutritional benefit of using the whole seeds is much less than using the ground meal.

Excellent like everyone else is saying! I put 1/2 c. ground flax seed & the whole amount of sunflower seeds plus 1 tsp. of high gluten flour and it turned out wonderfully!

I definitely would suggest using the "DOUGH" cycle of your bread machine, then shaping the bread into a boule (round), let proof in warm oven for 20 minutes and baking it in your oven 350 degrees for 30 minutes on a pizza stone. The crust was perfect & my husband is LOVING IT!

This came out great, I did make some substitutions and it was wonderful!  I subbed 1/3 cup each of flax meal, cracked wheat meal and steel cut oat meal for the 1/2 cup each of flax seeds and sunflower seeds. I also used 2 tbs molasses and 1 tbs honey instead to 3 tbs honey, gave it a very nice color and rich flavor! I don't like how bread comes out of my bread machine with a hole in the bottom so I only use it for the dough cycle and then baked in the oven in a buttered loaf pan and 375 for 30 min.

This is deliciuos bread--my whole family loves it.  It toasts up crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I have added some other ingredients...whole rolled oat and wheat germ (1/2 cup each and I subtract the same amount in the flours).  Yummy!!

I haven't tried this bread, but I'm wondering if your readers know that flax seeds should always be ground before using, in order to absorb the benefits?
Perhaps All Recipes should publish a note about this.

I ground the flax and add millet with the sunflower seeds. My husband loves this bread (saying a lot for a white-bread-loving man!!!). I will be making this regularly. Thanks!

We love this bread. It's one of the few whole wheat recipes that we really look forward to eating every morning. The loaf rises really high, and it has a crisp crust with a soft center. It also made great toast. It's great in the bread machine but it's also good when you put it on the dough setting, split the dough in half and put in greased loaf pans, let rise for 1/2 hour, then bake at 375 degrees for 30 min. We always use 1/3 cup flax seeds and then add 1/3 cup each of both sunflower seeds  and pumpkin seeds at the signal. I've also added walnuts, which are also pretty good.

Outrageously delicious bread with a great chewy texture. A little on the heavy side because of seeds, but I prefer a bread with substance. Thanks Erna! This is a real keeper! Toast is delish, too!

I made this by hand, and this is a pleasingly HUGE loaf.  The sunflower seeds aren't really noticeable but the linseeds give it a nice 'healthy, hearty' appearance.

This bread turned out amazing!  So soft and delicious.  I used ground flax and substituted pumpkin seeds for sunflower seeds because that's what I had in the house.

This is a fabulous, dense wheat bread with a great texture with the sunflower seeds.  Very hearty!  Came out perfectly in my bread machine maker.  FYI - I used milled flax seed.

We really enjoyed this bread.  I am a huge fan of sunflower seeds so I was hoping this would be good.  The recipe did not disappoint me.  I did increase the yeast to 1 1/2 tsp.  Since I have ground flax seeds, that is what I used.  I also used white whole wheat flour.  Next time I want to add some pumpkin seeds and some old fashioned oats.  I love the nutty texture of this bread and it slices nicely.  Thank you for sharing this recipe Erna Walmsley.

This was a pretty good wheat bread recipe. I had everything, but had to sub flaxmeal for the seeds . That worked fine. I am just not a fan of the seeds whole. I also used white whole wheat. My sunflower seeds were unsalted and roasted. For some reason the bread machine recipes never suggest warm water. Out of habit I used warm water, and about 105~110 degrees. On the cycle, suggested, it took 3 hrs and 25 minutes in my Zojirushi bread machine. This bread tasted like whole wheat bread and had that healthy flavor. However, it was soft and had an almost buttery aftertaste. Cutting it with my Presto bread guide I got 17 slices at 129 calories each.

Very good! I have made this a few times now.  I accidentally used milled flax instead of just flax seeds and it was so much better and moist than the "correct" version.  Although both versions were good, I think I will stick with the milled flax from now on.

Scrumptious, hearty, healthy bread! This is a great recipe. One thing I did was substitute whole wheat bread flour with rolled oats. I did so because I was out of whole wheat bread flour, but I must say that it was an excellent substitution and gave even more texture and taste. Yum!

Easiest bread ever. Usually substitute any seeds with what I have in the house (quinoa, millet, sesame, flax, sunflower) You can even mix and match. I usually use warm water since it makes the bread fluffier. I also use multigrain and whole wheat flour and works great in my bread maker. Usually put it on dough, I then rise it for 30 minutes in the shape you like (braided or in a pan).  After it has risen, bake 30 minutes at 350. Voila. My kids love it.

An outstanding bread machine bread recipe that I bake in the oven.  Assemble ingredients in bread machine, process on 'dough' setting, then place in oiled bread pan, let rise about 20 minutes, and bake in preheated 350o oven for 30 minutes.  Big hit at a party - the sunflower seeds make it more of a snack bread than a sandwich bread, but it slices well for both uses.

Turned out awesome!  Used multigrain flour instead of whole wheat, which already had flax in it, so I added about 1/3 C, also added 1/2 C. oats and used 1 1/2 C. water.  Bread is nice and moist and has great flavor!

This bread recipe is forgiving.  I messed it up in a few different ways.  Went to add the sunflower seeds that I had set aside in a mug, and instead dumped a mug of water in.  I ended up tossing in more bread flour and a smidge of yeast and sugar to compensate.  I also changed the serving size to 21 servings.  From there the I substituted 2 tablespoons ground flax seed for some of the whole wheat flour.  Used the same amount of flax seeds.  The bread was wonderful except that I used salted sunflower seeds.  It was like have little chunks of wood in the bread.  Without the sunflower seeds it would have been a perfect loaf!

This was A wonderful bread. I used Spelt Flour instead of whole wheat. Also make sure you grind the Flax Seeds in a coffee grinder to ensure you get the full nutritional benefit of the flax seeds. Otherwise your body just passes the seeds w/out getting much from them...

Delicious!!  Mine needed to bake longer, but that is probably just due to my inexperience with bread maker.  And I had roasted salted sunflower seeds on hand so that's what I used.  I was worried it would be too salty but it really wasn't at all!  Very yummy and will make again - soon!  Thanks!

I made this bread today. It turned out well. I didn't have bread flour so I used only 1 cup of all-purpose flour and added the additional 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour because we prefer whole wheat over white. I added 1/2 cup of ground flax seeds  in the beginning with the other ingredients and the sunflower seeds at the signal. 

Very nice and I will bake it again!

Pretty good hearty bread.  I was surprised how good it tasted with just that little bit of honey in the recipe.  I think I would use only 1/3 or 1/4 c. sunflower seeds next time.

I prefer making bread by hand (to me, it tastes better, gives it a certain "romantic" flavor, plus I get a good sweat :-) This is a really great recipe but I made some modifications: 1) Used the entire package of yeast (2 tsp, I think); 2) Added 1 tbsp of rolled oats; 3) Omitted the sunflower seeds (not particularly crazy about it); 4) Needed more flower for kneading (wheat, about 1/2 a cup); 5) brushed it a couple of times with an egg wash (just yoke and water). That's about it. Enjoy!

Possibly the best bread I've made! Delicious! The only substitution I made was for ground flax seed instead of whole. I did reduce the total amount of flax seeds to a quarter cup since I was using the ground instead of the whole. Turned out great!

This has become a favourite of mine.  I use canola oil & have used chia seeds - which are absolutely delicious in this bread!  The machine makes a nice loaf that is tastey, moist & cuts well.  It is great either as toast or sandwich bread.  I add 2 tbsp vital gluten for a higher rise.  When I use flax seed, I grind my own - better health benefits.  Whatever you add, make sure to keep an eye on the mixing.  I find that I have to add some flour & need to shape the loaf before its final rise.  My bread machine is a Zojurushi.

This turned out great with 3 T flax meal (I don't use seeds) and baked in my Zoji on the quick wheat setting.

I'm not sure where I went wrong but this dough was way too wet for me so I added about a 1/2c of more flour...but considering that this doesn't seem to be a problem for most others, I'm sure it's me.  I added flax meal instead of seeds as the body can't really use flax in seed form.  Anyway, the aroma, flavor, and texture of this bread are AWESOME.  Definitely a keeper.  I used my bread machine's dough cycle, punched down, let rise for 35 minutes and then baked in the oven.  I made one average size loaf and 8 small rolls with the dough, baked on 350 for 30 minutes...perfect!

DELICIOUS!  I followed the reviews to make this without a bread machine.  I used ground flax instead of whole, and threw in extra sunflower seeds.  I also used 2 tsp. yeast.  To warm the dough, I put my bowl into a sink full of hot water, and it rose beautifully.  This bread is far better than anything you can buy in a shop!

Yummy!  I made a couple of changes to the recipe.  I used flax meal instead of seeds (I add it to most breads anyway), and used 2 1/4 teaspoons of yeast (normal packet size).  I couldn't imagine it with only 1 teaspoon of yeast - I guess it'd be heavier.  I also added in 2 teaspoons of vital wheat gluten.  It was a beautiful, high, soft and moist and nutty bread - excellent!  My 9 yr old loved it too!  He liked it plain with no butter.  I liked mine with honey butter.

Very good, nutty, dense bread.  I thought it hadn't risen enough and cut it open to find it was just very dense!  I thought the flax and sunflower were a little too much, probably 1/4 c. of each would have been plenty, next time I many try adding in some gluten, or a greater proportion of bread flower to help it rise more.     Love the honey flavor.

I came across this recipe the other day, and even though I'm on a low-carb diet, I just HAD to try it;  it's simply terrific!!  Wonderful texture and flavour, and I took the advice of an earlier reviewer and used olive oil rather than butter - perfect results, and it couldn't be better!  I've tried one slice, and trying to resist more!! Thanks!!

Outstanding recipe. I made it using ground flax seed, and used my stand mixer and baked in the oven. I did have to add about 1/2c additional flour. This bread has a marvelous texture. I can't wait for summer and fresh homegown tomatoes to have with this recipe!

This was the easiest recipe I've ever used. I love how the machine literally did ever after I put the ingredients in and then the seeds when the first timer went off. The bread came out delicious and perfect. I will definitely keep using this recipe. Thanks Erna =)

I baked it in the oven after the machine did all the kneading and rising; I may have underbaked it, but won't know for sure until it cools and we get closer to the center of the loaf, but the dough came together beautifully without interference and rose excellently for the right amount of lift to the dense chewiness of the whole-wheat-ness and the seeds.

I've made this bread twice now and it keeps coming out flat. I don't blame the recipe though, because I've been using ground flax and I think that it's binding everything together too much (intact flax seeds don't have the same "binding/egg-like" properties as ground flax). It tastes really good though. I just wanted to warn people not to sub in ground flax because I think it's preventing my bread from rising properly :(

This is a great bread. We make this every other week or so for our kids who have allergies to food dyes and preservatives and can't have standard bakery or store bought bread. I use Sunbutter, about 3T instead of sunflower seeds. We love how dense and heavy the bread is! Very filling, and really tasty!

My VERY first bread in my very first breadmaker. Made it like the recipe says but ground half of the seeds which made a great texture. LOVED it, and may go make another one now (just cause I can...)

I appreciate that this recipe is egg and dairy free. I added 1/2 C poppy seeds, as well as 1/2 a cup of golden flax seeds. This bread is sturdy enough support lots of additional healthy items like chia seeds, hemp hearts, or even walnuts. Over all one of my favorite bread recipes I've tried!

Great recipe!  I liked this bread a lot but found it a tad too sweet so the second time I made it, I reduced the amount of honey to 2 tablespoons.  I also reduced the flax seeds to 1/4 cup.  I don't know how it turned out as it was a gift for my neighbor but it looked really good.  Next time I make it I will make the same alterations and see what it tastes like.

Easy to make without a bread machine. I didn't have whole wheat flour on hand, but this bread still turned out delicious with all-purpose flour.

I substituted all-purpose flour and it came out great. I needed to add a little more all-purpose flour while the machine was kneading. The bread came out fluffy and incredibly tasty.

This is THE BEST bread I have made with my bread maker yet, healthy but not heavy or dense.  Fantastic for sandwiches and toasted too of course.  The only small changes I made were substituting olive oil for the butter, using 2 tablespoons of gluten flour (reducing bread flour by 2 tablespoons) and a pkg of yeast.  Making this again now for the second time this week.  Thank you!

This bread is so filling, healthy, and delicious. Its hard to make another bread when this goes so well with jam in the morning, any kind of sandwich, or some honey as a snack.

Delicious. Heavy consistency as I had hoped, but still great for sandwiches. I made one loaf and 8 rolls that I will use for sandwiches (used the dough setting on the machine, then baked in the oven).

Used bread machine with all white flour since I didn't have whole wheat.  Also used sesame seeds instead of sunflower.  Added some toasted barley nuts as well....really good!!!  Will try with whole wheat next time!

This is great bread.  My wife and I both like it.  It has a great flavor and texture, and made a really good looking loaf.  I made one small change to the recipe, substituting regular flour for bread flour, and adding one tablespoon of gluten (reducing the white flour by one tablespoon.)

This bread is delicious! I used pumpkin seeds instead of sunflower because I had them on hand. Super easy to make & the perfect accompaniment to Andrea's Pasta Fagioli, also from this site. YUMMMMY !!!!

Loved this bread recipe.  So far, it was the best recipe I have tried in my machine.  I especially liked that there was a huge amount of seeds.  I also tried substituting the butter for oil (worked great) and the honey with sugar (also worked great).  This is a definite keeper!

After discovering I was out of wheat flour, I substituted with rye.  I also added about 1/2 cup of dried cranberries.  The result was a very hearty, tasty bread.

Just made this bread and it turned out beautifully. The only change I made was that I ground the flax a little (not too much because I like it chewy!) I made the dough in the bread machine and let it proof there for about an hour. Then I took it out, shaped it and let it rise in a greased pan for half hour. Baked it at 375 for half hour (I think I might leave it in an extra 5-10 min next time). Heavy as lead but delicious plain and toasted with butter and honey!

This is my favorite bread machine bread - I've made it many times and it always comes out great. I cook it in the bread machine. I slightly increased the whole wheat flour (to 1 1/2 cups), salt (to 1.5 tsp) and yeast (to 1.5 tsp). I live in high altitude. The last time I made it for added nutrition I reduced the amount of flax seeds and sunflower seeds to 1/4 cup each, then added 1/4 cup ground flax seeds, 1/4 cup quinoa flakes and 1/8 cup sesame seeds. Perfect!

Superb!  This was a delicious, hearty bread loaded w/ flavor & good stuff-- perfect for a winter's day!  Great toasted w/ a little honey. Thanks too, for the reviewers who converted it to non-bread machine (I don't own one.)

Delicious! Nice light texture and great taste. I used ground flax (a bit less than amt. given) and left out the sunflower seeds as I didn't have any. I tried it for grilled cheese and it was fabulous. A keeper for sure.

Best bread machine recipe I've found yet!  I use whatever nuts I have on hand...pumpkin seeds and walnuts work well.  I also added 1/2 cup or so of ground flaxseed and it still had great texture.

I want to thank the person who altered this recipe to be a "non-bread machine" version.  This bread is seriously delicious.  I usually add a bit of cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg to the mix for a truly delicious bread that has a bit of depth of flavour.

Omitted sunflower seeds and added about 1/4 to 1/3 Cup of wheat germ. Best bread machine recipe I have made so far. Bread is moist and love the honey flavor. I didn't think there were too many flax seeds. Seems just right! Also, I used all whole wheat bread flour and added a bit more yeast.

I use flax seed instead of sesame, and add 3 T gluten.  I now make this as my main bread for sandwiches and toast and no longer buy store bread.  I also set the machine to light color, and a 1.5# loaf.  My in-laws have fallen in love with it as well and consider it such a treat when I bring them a loaf.

I don't review often, but this is worth a review. This bread is excellent. I did not use a bread machine and made it by hand. After I mixed the ingredients together and kneaded, I let it rise in a loaf pan covered about 2 hours and baked at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes. It is delicious by itself or for a healthy sandwich. Last night, we grilled burgers and I toasted two slices and put a turkey burger with cheese between the toasted slices for a "turkey patty melt". Excellent - and its a filling bread not to mention a healthy alternative!

This bread is wonderful! I did make a couple of changes.  I used ground flax seed
and I chopped the sunflower seeds in my food processor. Added all the ingredients 
to my bread machine and used the dough cycle.  Then baked the bread in the oven.
It turned out great and a lot healthier 
than store bought bread. It's great for
French toast also.

Excellent bread, thank you!  I used my bread machine, but only to make the dough.  I had to add a 1/2 c of flour, but it's been raining here lately and I doubled the recipe, so that would explain the difference.  I made one loaf in my rectangular loaf pan and made an Italian style loaf with the other, let rise about 45 min, then baked at 375 for 30 minutes like another reviewer (LDSGIRL).  I took this bread to work to share with coworkers and they loved it.  I, too, really enjoy it!  :o)

This recipe is awesome!  I followed the ingredients to a "T" and prepared the dough in the bread machine.  
Here's my modification:
After rising, roll out the dough lengthwise and cut into small portions for sandwich rolls.  Shape each portion into a round "roll" shape and place rolls on a greased baking pan, cover with a towel and allow to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Bake at 350 degrees for 15 - 17 minutes, until lightly browned.  Yum!  Enjoy.

Always rises to a beautiful loaf! I've made it with and without the sunflower seeds, and it turns out well either way. I usually mix in the bread machine and bake in the oven.

Hands down, the BEST bread I have made thus far. I have been on the search for a seedy, hearty bread, and here it is. I loved it so much that after my first batch came out of the breadmachine, I started another. I will keep making this bread. The only issue I have is the shape of the bread when it is done..I will have to play around with making it look traditional or at least easier to cut. Otherwise, this bread is a keeper and will certainly be a regular in this house!

We love this bread.  We make it a couple of times a week in our bread machine.  It is moist, soft, and has a great nutty flavor.  We love the sunflower seeds.  We haven't been able to find any flax at our grocery store, but the recipe turns out fine without it.

I have been making this bread for quite a while now.  It is definatly my favourite recipie!  The only problem I have with it is that when I make a loaf it never lasts long enough - it's eaten right away!

Fantastic! I "veganized" this recipe by using molasses instead of honey, and vegan butter. It turned out perfectly. It also works on the delay cycle! I popped everything into my machine, set the timer, and my house smelled heavenly when I awoke the next morning. Perfectly shaped loaf as well. A definite staple bread for seed lovers who also want healthy options!

Delicious! I couldn't believe that such a bread came out of my bread machine. I made a few changes, though. I added a couple of tablespoons of whole wheat and I reduced the quantity of seeds to half, only to replace it with sesame seeds and oat flakes. I may try the recipe with a little more salt next time. I definitely won't buy a multi grain bread again from the baker's.

Fantastic bread!!! Used olive oil instead of butter; I didn't have flax seeds, so I used sesame and poppy seeds and kept the sunflower seeds, making this into a 3 seeded bread. I've submitted a photo on 3/11/07; made them into dinner rolls.

I loved it! I did take it out of the breadmaker and finished off in the oven into two smaller round loaves (one to share). It's just what I was looking for in a dense, nutty bread. Thanks!

This bread is fantastic.  I wish that I could give it 6 stars.  Even my hard-to-please hubby took a bite and said, "oh, this bread's a 'wow'".  It's going to be a regular in our house for sure!  x:)

Heavenly healthy! I put this on the dough cycle then let it rise and bake in the oven.  It was fluffy, nutty and slightly sweet.  I slightly reduced the seeds and nuts from other reviews stating it was a bit like bird seed - wonderful for sanwiches

I was out of honey so used molasses.  I also added some shelled pumpkin seeds and cut back a little on the sunflower seeds. It was great!  We all kept going back for just a nibble more.  It made the whole house smell great.

Very tasty and hearty bread.  I ground up the flax seeds in my coffee bean grinder and also used the dough option on my breadmaker. Then I added the sunflower seeds to the dough and baked it in my oven. It looks and tastes great. I have given some loaves out to friends as gifts - great bread for those with high cholesterol (thanks to the flax seeds).

I LOVE THIS BREAD!!! Even my husband, who doesn't like nuts in his bread gobbled this right up!  I'm craving another loaf already.  Delicious toasted with peanut butter.  We've been looking for a way to get more flax seed into our diet and we think we've found one way...  I'm so glad you shared this recipe, Erna!

I don't have a bread maker, but still turned out great!

I combined all ingredients except flax and sunflower seeds and let proof for about 2 hours. I added flax seeds, millet, and chia seeds and omitted the sunflower seeds for a more consistent texture.  I let proof for about 45 more minutes. 

I baked in a floured glass bread pan for 30 minutes at 375. I probably should have let it go for another 5-10 minutes at this temp.

I've made this recipe several times. It's long on great texture and a bit short on flavor. So to experiment, I used 3 tbl butter, 1 1/2 tsp salt, 4 tbl honey and because it comes out a little flat, I used 2 1/2 tsp yeast. And I used a bit more water. It was a bit damp after the proof but it shaped up w a little kneading and some sprinkled flour. Because it's more moist, give it the full 35 minutes at 350. I took it out at 30 and it wasn't ready. Success? Closer. I may try molasses instead of honey next time. It certainly rose nicely and the additional butter creates a more moist loaf. Oh, I also used toasted but not salted sunflower seeds. I'm not sure that difference was detectable. I was out of pumpkin seeds. I used half cup flax seeds and half cup sunflower. And a quarter cup quinoa. The flax seeds may be mostly bio unavailable, as one reviewer noted, but I do like the texture difference they offer.

Best bread ever! We use this recipe ALL the time in our house and it is great! Love the texture and taste and healthy appeal.
I don't understand why people are having a hard time (16 hours to make the bread? what? LOL).  Make sure to use warm water and add the salt in separate from the yeast.  I like to use the light crust setting on this one.  YUMMY!!!!

I made this in a bread machine and it was AMAZING!!! Deliciously chewy. I used olive oil instead of butter and maple syrup instead of honey to make if vegan. I will definitely make this again.

Made this for the first time today, and WOW is it yummy!  I didn't have "bread flours" but used all purpose and wheat flours.  When the bread machine signaled it was time to add the sunflower seeds, I was worried because the dough seemed SO sticky that it was having a hard time even moving the ball of dough around. I helped it along for a minute or so after I first put added the sunflower seeds, but eventually said "forget it" and decided to let it do its thing.  It somehow worked out, and created a beautiful, rich loaf.  This bread TOASTED is like heaven on earth.  YUM!  Will definitely make this over and over again.

I searched for many months for a recipe like this!  I have bought this type of bread from the grocery store before and it is always one of my favorites.  I am so happy that I found this recipe!  I have made it several times now and it always turns out perfect!  

Now I am searching for the perfect rye bread recipe.  This recipe seems to be the perfect combination of flour, liquid and oil.  I like how it turns out soft but hearty.  So, I plan to try this recipe but change it up for rye bread.  Instead of all the whole wheat flour I plan to use 2/3 cup of rye flour and 2/3 cup of whole wheat.  I'll add a teaspoon of caraway seeds in place of sunflower seeds.  Instead of honey I'll use molasses.  Hoping it turns out right.

This was my first attempt at making bread in my breadmaker, and it turned out to be one fabulous first bread@!  Used roasted unsalted sunflower seeds. Set breadmaker for dough; my breadmaker instructions say to put these in at the start of the 2nd knead cycle, which was 30 minutes into the dough process. Let it rise in a greased loaf pan and baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  PERFECTO! We changed what we were eating for dinner so we could have this bread with it. We are in love with this bread and will be making it again. I know it will also be great as toast with jam on it~ Thanks for a great recipe!
By the way, my grocery didn't have whole wheat bread flour available, so I just used regular bread flour for the whole amount of flour - no problem. Did not change any of the other ingredients - perfect as is.

I modified another bread machine recipe to something almost exactly like this recipe (even before I found this one). I like making the dough in the machine and baking the bread in the oven. For the most recent loaf, I subbed molasses for the honey for a richer flavor. I also cut the dough into 3 pieces, rolled out into "snakes," and braided them together. Takes a little longer to bake (closer to 50-60 minutes) but very pretty.

this is my all time favorite bread.  I did't have sunflower seeds so I used ground up almonds once and used chopped pecans the next time.  I also used flax oil instead of butter. Make sure you grind up whole flax seeds. i used my electric coffee grinder. I rate this as a 10 plus!

I made this recipe exactly as written. Neither my husband nor I enjoyed it at all. I really do not have anything good to say about it. It tasted super healthy, bland, almost a little bit tart with the flax seeds.

Excellent, I used 9g fresh yeast and did it by hand, not in the breadmaker. I let it rise until doubled, then punched it down and put it in a greased loaf pan, let it rise again and baked for 35min at 375F, it turned out fantastic, excellent texture and taste :)

This bread is FANTASTIC! I just bought my Zojirushi and this was the second bread I've ever made. I did it from start to finish in the machine and it turned out great. I was debating the whole time whether I wanted to finish it in the oven, but now I'm glad I didn't because I honestly don't think it needed it. The texture wasn't like typical bread machine breads. This bread had an awesome thin, flaky crust, and the texture of the bread itself was really light. The sunflower seeds add a delicious, nutty flavor to the whole thing. A few minor substitutions, instead of the flaxseeds I used 1/4 cup flax meal for nutrients, although I did toss a tbs or two of whole flaxseeds because I like the crunch. I also added 1/4 cup King Arthur fiber, and some KA whole grain improver. I ran out of bread flour so I had to use all purpose, it still tasted great though. I added a little bit of KA 6 grain flakes for added flavor and texture. As per so many recommendations here, I used canola oil instead of butter. This really turned out great and I would highly recommend. I even gave this to my (honest) chef father who doesn't typically like wheat or "healthy" type breads, and he even loved it. We buy multigrain bread at the grocery store to have as toast for breakfast every day, but this has totally replaced that. I'm so happy to have such a great recipe and know exactly what is going in my bread, definitely no preservatives!

Love this Bread!  Since I didn't have any whole wheat bread flour, I used the regular bread flour and white whole wheat flour I had, and added 2 TBSP of vital wheat gluten.  It rose beautifully and came out great. Thanks for the recipe, Erna!

Great recipe! I used pumpkin seeds in place of sunflower seeds (because it was what I had on hand), and vegetable oil in place of butter. Made without a bread machine by proofing the yeast in warm water, mixing on high speed for ~3 minutes with a Kitchen-Aid paddle to develop the gluten, and then kneading with the dough hook for ~8 minutes on low speed. Made a tender, flavorful, hearty loaf.

Excellent! I have been baking my own bread for a few months, but had not yet tried whole wheat bread. I like the idea of knowing what is in the food we eat. There are no unpronounceable ingredients in this recipe, lol. This makes great sandwiches and is especially good toasted. My husband said that this is the best bread I have made so far. Thanks for posting.

This was delicious. I used less fat vegetable cream cheese. Next time I might cut back on the amount of water. The sauce was alittle runny, but still good.

I used ground flax instead of the regular. This bread is very filling. It's pretty dense with crunchy crust. I increased yeast by 1/2 tsp. Will increase salt next time too. I froze leftovers to use later toasted. It tastes very good! Got lots of compliments from my kids.

The first time I made this it was without the sunflower seeds since my bread machine did not make the alert sound during the knead cycle.  It was still quite tasty.  The second time I made this recipe exactly as written except I added the sunflower seeds with the other ingredients.  I served it warm with some honey on top and it was heavenly tasting and quite filling.

This is the first bread machine recipe I have tried that actually turned out right.  This bread was soft and yummy.  My husband and daughter loved it!  It was a bit sweet for my taste so next time I will reduce the honey, but I will definitely make this again.

I was very pleased with the way this bread turned out in my breadmaker. It was soft and had a good rise. I was concerned that there was a little too much water in the recipe, and I did add a bit more flour. I also was concerned about just 1t of yeast, so I up'd it to 2t. Tastes delicious.

Wonderful, wonderful bread!  You don't have to be a pro to make this--this was the second time using my bread machine, and it turned out perfectly! I used ground flax seed and EVOO instead of butter.  I also mistakenly used rapid rise yeast-- still perfect! Store-bought bread NO MORE!

MMMMMMM.......outrageous!!!! I'm having a slice right now, warm with butter and a drizzle of honey. I don't have a bread maker so I made mine in my Kitchen Aid and baked it at 350 for about 45 min. PERFECTION! I also increased the yeast to 1 1/4 tps. Gonna be making this VERY often!

Mmm, so good! I do not have that "knack" for bread baking like some do, but was craving sunflower seed bread after a friend gave us a loaf she made. Though I have a bread machine, I decided to make this by hand -- which was a first! I proofed the yeast for about 5-10 minutes (combined water, honey and yeast) and then mixed it all together, and kneeded about 5 minutes. I let it rise about 2 hours (I intended to only let it rise 60 minutes but TOTALLY forgot about it!), punched it down, then put it in my loaf pan and let it rise another 30-40 minutes. I baked it at 350 degrees for about 35-40 minutes. The result is probably THE best loaf of bread I've ever had! I will definitely make it again! (I did leave out of the flaxseed, and just used about 3/4 cup sunflower seeds.)

This is a very good, moist bread. I was surprised that it turned out so well because as it was kneading I noticed that it was wet and sticky, but the bread still turned out very soft, moist and delicious! I'll definitely make this bread again and experiment with different nuts and seeds.

Definitely not a favorite at my house. I normally love hearty breads that are full of fiber and seeds, but this one didn't have the flavor I was looking for. I was disappointed because of all the rave reviews. I wish I had enjoyed this recipe, but I just can't say I did. Worth a try. Don't hesitate just because I didn't care for it. Thanks.

This bread is so good! I want to get my husband away from his favorite homemade white bread, which though tasty, has no nutritional content.  I did add a bit more yeast as 1 teaspoon seemed like it wasn't enough and used milled flax and graham flour instead of whole wheat bread flour.

I find this bread is great without the oil. To make a nice light but solid texture, use a starter. I make up a small biga (starter) consisting of 1/4 c cool water, 1/4 teas of yeast, and 3/4 cup wheat/white flour the day before. Mix the biga thoroughly and make a solid ball with it. Put it in a container, seal it, and let it rise at room temp overnight. Prior to starting the next day, use 1/4 cup water to make the biga into a lumpy slurry(tear up the biga in little chunks to make this easier). Make the recipe as is after deducting the ingredients used in the biga and slurry. Hold off on adding salt to the recipe until you have kneaded all ingredients, added the sunflower seeds, and let the dough rise for 1/2 hour. Flatten and stretch dough, sprinkle some salt, fold, knead, and flatten and stretch again, sprinkle more of the salt, re-knead. Do this 2 -3 times. Divide into 2 loaves and shape each for the final rise.  Get out a cookie sheet for the rise and bake. Grease the pan or use parchment paper. I made a couple forms for rising a nice round loaf, cut 2 4" high sections of 2-liter soda bottles, spray inside with cooking spray, place dough in each round on baking sheet. Once dough fills out to edge of round, spin round a little to free dough. As dough rises higher in each round, slide the round up a little to expose dough at bottom round. Let it keep rising up until it starts to spill over top. Gently remove round, gently shape up loaves. Cook 350 till loaf temp reaches 190.

This bread is really easy to make.  It's really yummy and very healthy.  I've been using pumpkin seeds (out of the shells of course), ground flax along with the whole flax seed and wheat germ.  I add it all in the beginning and it has come out fine every time.  This is now my favorite bread to make!

Very tasty!  Good toasted, with coconut oil, agave syrup and cinnamon.

I've made this a second time now, and I put the sunflower seeds in at the beginning along with the flax seeds and it turned out just fine!  This time I substituted agave syrup for part of the honey.  My first loaf collapsed just a bit on top, so the second time I decreased the yeast only a tiny amount and it came out beautifully!

Wonderful bread!  I make bread in my breadmaker several times a week, and this one is a winner.  Really delicious taste and texture, came out perfect, no collapsing on top as sometimes happens.  I followed some of the tips I read:  ground the flax seed; upped the salt to 1.5 tsps; used canola oil instead of butter; and added a bit more yeast.  This will be a standard favorite

Delicious!  I'm a novice breadmaker, but this recipe gave my confidence a huge boost!  I did not have bread flour so used regular flour and regular whole wheat flour, and added one teaspoon of vital wheat gluten for every cup of flour I used.  Only other change was to use ground flaxseed instead of whole.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine, then placed it in a greased loaf pan, let it rise again, and baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  A delicious, soft, chewy bread! thank you!

I won't serve my family white bread but I couldn't get my kids to eat any multi-grain breads from scratch until this recipe!  They like it so much that now I have to ration it so it doesn't disappear within minutes.  They eat it with sandwiches, with butter, or plain...and they don't even ask me to cut the crust off!!!  The combination of ingredients is perfect.  The taste is light.  The loaf size is about 1.5 lbs and the texture is perfect for cutting into thin slices without it falling apart.  I get about 12-14 slices per loaf.  I do use raw milk instead of water to add a bit of protein and I use a high heat oil instead of butter, mainly because I'm too lazy to wait for it to soften.  Thanks, Erna!!!!!

I made this by hand and substituted whole wheat flour for a portion of the whole wheat bread flour (didn’t have any) and used milled flax seed.  This is what I did: Dissolve 3 T. honey in 1 1/3 c. 115° water then add 1 t. yeast.  Let stand ten minutes.  I know the ideal temperature for yeast is 110°, but I figured that the water would have cooled down to 110° by the time the honey had dissolved and the yeast was ready to be added (it did).  Also, I might not have needed all that honey, but I’m new at converting from bread machine to hand, so I didn’t change any of the ingredient quantities.  Add 2 T. vegetable oil, then add 2 c. bread flour, 1/2 c. and 1/3 c. whole wheat flour, and 1 t. salt.  Add 1/2 c. milled flax seeds and 1/2 c. unsalted sunflower seeds.  Knead eight minutes.  Let rise in oiled bowl for one hour. Punch down and let rise again for 45 minutes. Bake at 350° for 35-40 minutes.

5-star hit.  notes: I replaced all of the butter/fat with 2 1/2 heaping tablespoons of trader joe's unsweetened gravenstein applesauce. it is likely that any quality unsweetened applesauce will do just as well.  I replaced honey with whipped/creamed honey. just what i happened to have on hand, regular honey likely to do just as well. I also did not use a true tablespoon for the applesauce portion of this recipe; instead, i used a dinner tablespoon (silverware). for all other measurements I used proper measurements. baked in zojirishi machine on basic white bread, light crust setting.  the substitution resulted in a very soft, very moist, bread. very nutty, very low fat. my fiance loved it, i loved it, and my students (16 11th graders) ate it all within minutes. this is a highly recommended recipe and very good for low-fat substitution.

I increase the recipe to 18 portions because my bread machine is for 2-3lb loaves. It rose wonderfully, although it was still quite dense. Very filling bread. It was my first bread I made by machine ~ I might just used the portions as stated rather then increase it for my bread machine - the loaf I came out with was HUGE.

Delicious! A shade too large for my 1.5lb machine but wonderful nonetheless. I used milled flax seed and salted, roasted sunflowers.

I don't typically take the time to review things unless they're completely horrible or absolutely fabulous. This bread definitely belongs in the latter category. I've had a bread machine for years, and would occasionally buy a box of country white mix. Once I found this recipe though, I was hooked, and I've made this recipe at least a dozen times. I love it and my family loves it. Try eating toasted with apricot preserves. Great stuff!

Good thing I made a double batch, because my family of four DEVOURED Loaf #1 in no time flat. Moist, tasty, healthy without coming across as overly wheaty or dry. No breadmaker in this house, so I baked my batch in the oven.

A Great Bread!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Results: Flavorful, chewy and retained moistness longer than any recipe I have tried to date.  

Variation from recipe: Used milled flax instead of whole flax seed.  Pan roasted the raw sunflowers, let cool, and added at the "buzzer"

So stinkin' good! The taste is superb!  I mixed this in my Kitchen Aid and let rise twice before baking at 350 for about 40 minutes.  I did grind the flax seed before adding.  Best bread ever!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I have made this bread many times. It is my favourite machine bread recipe. It is great freshly baked and lightly buttered, for sandwiches, with dip, and toasted. I use machine settings Basic, Medium Crust, and 1.5 lbs. I use margarine instead of butter, ground flaxseed, and all whole wheat bread flour. EDIT: This is also great baked the traditional way, w/o a bread machine. I followed LDSGIRL's measurements.

Delish!  I had never had flax seeds before, but I keep hearing how good for you they are, so I tried this recipe.  Next time I might trim back the ingredients slightly because the bread rose all the way to touch the top of the machine.  My machine says it holds a 1 1/2 lb loaf.

I've been looking for a whole wheat bread that tastes great. The second time I made this I did grind both the flax and sunflower seeds because DH hates seeds. Also followed SuzannaH's directions for traditional bread making without a machine. Also added a whole package of yeast (2 1/2 t.). Yummy toasted with peanut butter for breakfast.

I am giving this four stars because the flax seeds really need to be ground first! Oh and my bread machine doesn't have an alarm on the knead cycle so I added the sunflower seeds after 10 minutes and it worked great! Other than that this bread is really good. I did find that I don't like it for an everyday bread.

Tasty, great.  I had to let it rise for 2 hrs. because I was running out, but it made for a little lighter loaf.  I also added a little more yeast, because my first loaf was a little brick like (but still tasty).  I added less sunflowers, and some oat bran.  YUM.

I used this reciepe many times now.  I have changed it from original(that was great but, I wanted to tweak it).  I added millet seed, steel cut oats, and gluten.  This made a very tasty loaf and made it several times for friends and family.  I always used the bread machine.  I have also added dried cranberries to this mix as well for a sweeter bread and liked that as well.

We loved this bread, although I admit I made some significant changes to the recipe, so maybe my review isn't quite valid. I soaked bulgur in boiling water, drained it, and used it in place of the sunflower seeds (same amt. of bulgur as sunflower seeds). I changed the flour too: about 1/4 bread flour and 3/4 whole wheat plus a few tablespoons gluten. I added just a tiny bit more yeast than the recipe called for, because I could hardly believe that was enough, but it was! The bread was delicious. :)

Kinda gross. It had potential to be alright but the amounts of flax and sunflower seeds was just too abundant. My sister and bother in law loved it though. Probably won't make it again, but good try. I still have to admire you for even making your own recipe.

This bread I made by hand, as I don't have a bread machine.  First I combined the yeast and  1/2 of the flour and salt, warmed the water slightly, and mixed on high for 3 minutes once all combined.  I then added the rest of the flour and ingredients and let rise for 45 mins.  I punched down, placed it in pan, and let rise for 30 more mins, then baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  It was good... but if I made it again I would omit the salt as the seeds brought a lot of salt of their own.  I guess I'm just not a fan of sunflower seeds~ but this is a very hearty bread!

I don't have a bread machine, so I had to modify this a little bit in order to do it by hand.  This was actually my very first bread making experience and I had a ton of fun doing it.  I was a little worried that, with being a novice, the bread might not turn out, but this bread turned out great.  It's such a yummy hearty bread.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thank you!

I love this recipe!  I used canola oil instead of butter and had to use some extra flour, but it turned out great.  I also substituted whole wheat flour for the white flour.  Will make again!

I was looking for just a sunflower bread so I did leave out the flax seed this time and it was really good. I'll probably try it with the flax next time, because there definitely will be a next time :)

I was excited to try this recipe, but I thought there were way too many seeds in it. Maybe I got something wrong, but my loaf seemed more like bird food than bread. I'll try it again with a few less seeds and see how it goes -- in any case, both I and the backyard cardinals are finding it edible, with or without butter. :)

this raised great, with no problems, and the texture was wonderful. But it was more bland then we are used to. If you are used to bread that isn't robust, you will love this one. I even added some sourdough starter for some of the water with no problems.

I often add a little flax to my other recipes - this is the first actual flax recipe I've tried and it's HEAVENLY.  I'll definitely make it again.

The bread was really good, but a bit too sweet.  I'll make it again, but I think I'll cut down on the honey and sunflower seeds.  I made this by hand and found that I had to cut down the amount of water to 1 cup.

I used olive oil as suggested and baked the bread in the oven after the bread machine did all the work.  This is one of those "it's hard to believe this is good for you because it tastes so good" foods.  A beautiful, tender, high rising loaf that beats any store bought whole grain bread.

This bread is wonderful! I made it just like the recipe says and had no problems with it. It made a really big loaf, so full and pretty and absolutely delicious! It is our new "fav" recipe. I am going to try it with molasses and Enova oil next time.

I made this recipe by hand, and was worried I'd done something wrong because the dough didn't rise much. I continued anyway, and ended up with 12 beautiful, hearty buns. Next time I will grind the flax and use olive oil instead of butter. Great recipe!!

One thing I forgot to mention in my first post is that I had to add roughly 1 cup extra of flour.Without that extra flour it was way too moist to even begin to knead it.

This came out very tasty....I made according to the recipe with no changes, then about halfway through the mixing realized there wasnt enough flour, so I reread all the reviews and saw that most added extra. I wound up adding more than 1/2c flour.

This is delicious and so nutritious too. Just had the last piece (the crust) from the 2nd loaf that I've made and it was still so crisp and good.I store it cut side down on a cutting board with no wrap to keep the crust real crisp. Used olive oil instead of butter, interchanged the flour measurements, (more whole wheat  than white)and ground the flax seeds, other than that followed the  directions exactly and love it.
Thanks Erna.

I've never purchased flax seed before.  It gives great texture to this moist and flavorful bread.  I didn't have butter, so used olive oil instead.  I could eat this bread sweet or savory.

I did as some other reviewers suggested, and added a little bit of salt, and ground up the flax seeds. I also added in a tablespoon each of vital wheat gluten and dough enhancer. It was such a hit, I need to make another loaf tomorrow so we can enjoy it again!

Absolutely perfect! Tastes wonderful and looks wonderful.  I did add some rolled oats and substituted pumpkin seeds for the sunflower seeds; kept the amount of seeds at 1 cup altogether.

Made this bread today — a 2-lb loaf.
What a wonderful scent in our house as it baked!  
A really nice flavor, and fun with the little bit of crunchy from the seeds! 
We will absolutely make this over and over again!

I didn't have flax seed or wheat bread flour, so I used plain old wheat flour, and added an extra 1/4 tsp of yeast to compensate.  I also added a 1/3 cup of finely chopped walnuts, and a 1/3 of a cup of dried cranberries.  It makes a fantastic breakfast bread for toasting!

I made it once with whole wheat but since then have made it multiple times with a random mix of  bread flour and all purpose flour. More bread flour than all purpose...but it has turned out fine everytime!! Also i fill 1 cup with ground flax, seasame, and chia seeds and let it run a little over and its great! one time i used sunflower another time i used pumpkin seeds instead...hard to screw up and hard to not eat it all at once! it doesnt have a great shelf-life but my boyfriend and i use it as a daily toast/sandwich bread so it doesnt last too long!

Recipe was delicious! Only thing I’m tweaking for next time’s run would be taking it out of the bread maker 10-15 minutes earlier since it overcooked the edges a little! Can’t get enough of it!

I also added in pumpkin seeds, dried cherries, extra butter, and used ground flax instead of whole. Instead of whole wheat I used a gluten free flour blend. It’s the best tasting loaf to come out of my machine thus far!

I did this recipe using my Kitchen Aid. I added an extra 1/3 C flour as suggested by someone else but the dough was still sticky when I transferred it to my pan. The finished product was just fine though. I halved the chia seeds and added 1/4 C pumpkin seeds. The bread was DELICIOUS! I made it twice in one weekend.

Have made this recipe many times with great results every time. First time made it to recipe, perfect. Started experimenting and substituted raisins and dried cranberries for the flax seeds and sunflower seeds, no additional changes to the recipe. That is my Thanksgiving bread. No matter the if it made with seeds or fruit, the taste is fantastic with a soft tender crumb.

Great simple recipe. Made it twice now in my bread maker and only change was to add 1tbsp of vital wheat gluten the second time which resulted in a fluffier less dense loaf. Definitely adding to regular recipe roster.

I love this super light, fluffy, moist, delicious hearty bread! It is nutty with the perfect balance of honeylicious sweetness. Like many reviewers, I do not own a bread machine, so I made it the artisan way, which is always quite fun and extremely satisfying. I also reduced the amounts of sunflower and flax seeds to 1/4 cup each, adapting to my family's tastes and preferences. Additionally, I added 1/4 cup of potato flakes and 2 tablespoons of dry powdered milk. This bread rises incredibly high! I will definitely make it again and again and again!!! :-)

On the advice of others - I increased the yeast by 1/2 teaspoon, increased the salt by 1/4 teaspoon, used ground flax  seeds instead of whole, and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.

This is seriously the best tasting bread. I use a bread machine and it's our everyday bread. I can't have dairy so I sub out refined coconut oil for the butter and it turns out perfectly every time. The texture is very soft so for spreads like cream cheese etc it needs a heavier toasting to hold up. Stays fresh for about 5 days on the counter and 10 days in the fridge

This recipe needs more yeast and more flour.  It makes a rather small loaf.  It's kind of oily but nutritious tasting bread.  I've had better.  But I've had worse.

I made this by hand. Very easy to make. I used suggestion on a review to use 2 cups warm water and oil instead of butter and used  1 packet yeast. Proofing 10 minutes. Will make again

Like with any bread, it took a lot of time to let it rise, but other than that, it was great.  My husband loved it!  The only thing I would do different, is to divide it in fourths, not sixths.

My family and I really enjoyed  this bread recipe. I had an opportunity to use some freshly ground hard red wheat berries in place of store bought whole wheat flour, and it turned out beautifully. 
This recipe will be added to my recipe box and used regularly.

This bread is amazing. I followed the recipe exactly and made it in my bread machine. I am so pleased with how light the bread turned out, lovely crust and great flavour. 
It is far superior to the seed recipe that came with my bread machine and this recipe is much simpler. 
Highly recommend.

I enjoy making and eating this bread  often., using the bread machine to prepare the dough and baking it  in the oven. I use ground flax seed and sometimes add 1/2 cup of dried cranberries.

Recently a big box store quit making a seeded bread that my husband loves.  So I invested in a bread machine,; deciding that I would find a recipe that included seeds.  I just finished making this loaf, and it is delicious.  I did include several seeds to simulate the loaf we could not buy anymore.  I was not trying to change the recipe but to duplicate what we could not purchase anymore.  Aside from sunflower seeds, I included walnuts, pecans, and pumpkin seeds.  It looks, and tastes great.  Thank you for submitting.

I bought a bread machine a few months ago and have tried many recipes to find a bread I want to eat every day. This is the one! I had to add some extra flour because the dough was very wet, but I chalk that up to the humidity here. Delicious!

I made this in my bread maker earlier this week but fell asleep before the beep to add in the sunflower seeds. Without the sunflower seeds the recipe is still great. I also followed what some of the reviewers said about using veg oil instead of the butter (we were low on butter and I wanted some to go on the toast I wanted to make with it in the morning). The bread is fluffy and I was able to slice it thin enough for pbj sandwiches without a mess of crumbs. This recipe is going to become our weekly loaf because of how tasty, versatile, and easy it is to make. I used the white bread, 1.5lb setting, with medium crust, and just measured everything into the bread maker and pressed start :) you don't even need special flour, I just used all purpose flour.

I've made this recipie a couple of times now.  When i followed the original, I didn't get a great rise, so it was a more dense bread.  Instead, I used LDSGIRL's variation* and it was absolutely sublime.  I also added a half cup unsalted pumpkin seeds.
*2 cups warm water with 6 tbsp honey dissolved, then added 2 1/4 tsp yeast, proofing for 10 minutes.  2 tbsp melted butter and 1.5 tsp salt.  3 cups whole wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour, 1/2 cup ground flax seeds (used a coffee grinder), 1/2 cup unsalted sunflower seeds, and 1/2 cup unsalted pumpkin seeds.  Kneaded on low using Kitchen Aid with dough hook for about 10 minutes.  Let it rise, covered with a dish cloth, in the microwave with just the hood light on for heat for about an hour.  Punched it down, divided into two parts and put into greased loaf pans.  Rise for another 45 mins, then bake (in convection oven if possible) at 375 for 30 mins.  Perfection!

Fave healthy bread machine recipe ever.  Did just as directed except used regular whole wheat, rather than bread flour,  and most importantly, used about 2 1/2 tsp yeast (one whole packet) instead of the 1 tsp. called for.   Came out lovely and not too dense, like some healthy bread recipes.

This tastes really good. I just tried a hot piece out of the oven with some butter! I followed "LDSGIRL's" helpful advice and increased the size to get two loaves. The loaves were about as big as the loaf pan, and didn't rise out of the pan like I prefer. If I made this again, I would increase all of the ingredients beyond the helpful review quantities by 25%. This would then yield two nice big loaves. The bread is delicious! One more note, it took me about an hour to completely bake the bread to perfection.

This dense, seed-rich bread is my favorite - year round! I enjoy it warm, right out of the bread machine, but toasted in thick slices - it's heavenly - and my guests always agree!  I prefer 1" slices,  buttered lightly, and golden toasted in a skillet on the stove. Wrap leftover loaf tight and it will store in the fridge for several weeks. Modifications: I add a smidge (1/4 t.) of yeast and sometimes add 1/4 cup cooked, cooled cracked wheat which necessitates the addition of 1/2 cup flour, more or less. But I'm sure that any failures (insufficient rise) I've had with this recipe are because of yeast quality.

The best bread I have ever made!! Have made the dough regularly EXACTLY as the recipe states and have never had a bad batch. Have baked it in the bread maker and also taken it out and made smaller loaves... the most consistent recipe.

LOVED IT! 
I grind my own wheat ( non gmo) so I add one teaspoon of baking powder per cup of flour. I also added about a tablespoon of chia seeds. 
I live at a high altitude ( about 7,000 ft), so today I'm also adding one of my chickens eggs. 
I have a breadman pro bread machine and was surprised to use the regular white bread setting. My loaf turned out perfectly. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Excellent! This recipe just replaced our $5/week Good Seed habit! I didn't have wheat flour, so I substituted AP white flour for it, and used bread flour as was called for. Everything else stayed the same (added a pinch more salt per several suggestions) and this bread is AWESOME! Light, fluffy (let it rise total of 3 hrs between punches) and it's not even cool yet, and is already 3/4 gone!

This bread was ok.  I made mistake of adding sunflower seeds at wrong time and instead of them mixing in they just stayed on top.  Which may have caused bread to sink in.

This is a great base to use for a wheat bread.  We did not like the sunflower seeds, and next time we make we will likely replace with something else (maybe wheat berry).  However, the texture of the bread is very nice and works well with the seed additions.  I do recommend adding a teaspoon of wheat gluten for more consistent rise and texture.  I will keep in my bread arsenal for sure.

Yum! I ground up the flax, and partially ground the sunflower seeds. Then I added a couple tablespoons of semi-ground sesame seeds which gave it a really strong sesame flavor. It was really good, but next time I'll leave them out so I can taste the sunflower seeds better. Delicious!

Just made this bread tonight. It was very easy to make and has a great soft texture. I used flax meal instead of seed and it didn't take away from the bread. I just added the sunflower seeds during the first knead since my machine doesn't have a alarm for adding seeds in the basic cycle. I highly recommend this bread.

Excellent!  I also used ground flax seeds, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  This truly is one of the best breads I have ever made.  Even my teens, can't seem to get enough of it!

Super addition to a warm soup for dinner. It's very nutty and slightly sweet. My family loves this bread!

I liked this, although I wasn't bowled over. I made it particularly for my wife the health food advocate who didn't care for it at all. Go figure. If I were to make it again (likely won't where she had no interest in it) I'd try to find a way to add more flavor.

Fantastic bread, although I goofed and used a whole packet of yeast instead of 1 tsp.  It didn't overflow or over-rise. This is only the second loaf of bread, I have ever made in my life and I'm 54.  I'm looking for a "Great Harvest" knock off of their High Five Fiber Bread, this was not it, but still awesome, nevertheless.

This recipe is fantastic. I was just about to give up on my bread machine. Fool proof recipe !! Husband and kids love it. I used half a cup of mixed seeds because i didnt have any flax seed. The texture is perfect and cuts well. Thank you so much :-)

This was easily the greatest bread I've ever made. The crust was so soft and the inside had the perfect texture. I've never really eaten flax....so it took me a while to get used to the flavor of the flax. Flax is really good with honey.  I will definitely make this recipe regularly. Thanks, for the great recipe.

I really enjoyed this bread.  It was easy to make and the results were fantastic.  I was even more surprised when my kids would eat it with PB&J.  This bread goes GREAT with any sandwich especially a sandwich with avocado.

I have to correct my previous post.  I had a senior moment and used all-purpose flour by accident instead of my bread flour.  I  discovered my mistake when I made the Onion and Cheese Focaccia, which by the way was very good.

Oh my, this bread is fantastic by itself, toasted with jam and for sandwiches!  I made it by hand and used 2 cups bread flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour as I can't find whole wheat bread flour around here.  I will definitely be making this again!

Wow!! This recipe yields an incredible loaf of bread!! I haven't always been happy with the texture of bread machine breads. This loaf is the perfect texture. Great alone, or for sandwiches & even better toasted! My husband can't stop raving about it. As other reviewers, I used milled flax seed. Thanks Erna, for a fabulous loaf!!

Very nice and nutty flavor.  I added 4 tsp Vital Wheat Gluten for better rise and texture.  I think I added the sunflower seeds too soon - but it still came out tasting great.  Will definitely make again.

Very good, But I didn't have sunflower seeds, so I got creative. I used poppy seeds, and chopped almonds and a little zest of lemon. I made it in the oven because I don't have a bread machine. Then when the bread was almost done I put a glaze over top I made of powder sugar, lemon juice, vanilla, and a few slivered almonds. It caramelized and looks so pretty (and tastes good too). I forgot how much I like flax!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used milled flax seed.  This bread was so good.  I ate one slice with cheese for breakfast.  I toasted a second slice for lunch and had Becel on it.  It tasted so good and nutty.  I don't like the the way my bread maker shapes the loaves so tall.  I think the next time I make this I'll just use the dough setting and then bake it in a large loaf pan.  I might even make perfectly sized buns.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This is a great recipe. My husband and I decided to start making bread instead of buying it to save money. This is now our regular bread and we've been making it for several months. It slices beautifully and will slice nice and thin for sandwiches. The texture is sturdy but still moist. I make two changes: I can't find whole wheat bread flour at my regular grocery store so I buy plain whole wheat flour. It still comes out great. Also, like many reviewers suggest, I use ground flax seeds (aka flax meal) for the health benefits.

This bread is DELICIOUS. Made it by hand, as other reviewers have done. Didn't need quite as much flour as was written. Started with a cup of each and added (alternating between white and whole wheat) as I kneaded. I also used 1/2 cup of flax seeds which I ground in my coffee grinder, and toasted 1/4 cup of sunflower seeds, and 1/4 of pumpkin seeds before adding them to the dough. AMAZING.

This recipe was good, but I think that it would taste better to me with about 1/2 as much sunflower seeds. I also substituded the 2 tbsp butter for a tablespoon of olive oil and 1/8 cup of no sugar added apple sauce. The bread came out very moist and fluffy.

This was very good.  My kids liked it too.   I used the flax meal instead of flax seeds.

I had never tried a bread maker,  I borrowed my friends  and she recommened I only use it up to the dough setting,  and then took the dough out,  punched it down and let it rise in a closed oven with the light on.  I was better that the store bought bread,  I usually buy.  I am going to make this bread again and again.  It toasts up great too.

This is a phenomenal bread. I've tried MANY and this has to be in my top 3. My husband, who's not the biggest fan of 'healthy' breads, loves it. I personally will add a tad more salt next time. This time around, I added a 1/4 tsp more yeast and would continue to do so moving forward. And, a tip re: flax seeds. Make sure you grind them - ground flax provides more nutritional benefits than whole. Whole seeds are very difficult for our bodies to digest.  Great recipe. Thank you.

Very tasty...just remember to always grind your flax seed; a coffee grinder works perfectly.  The whole seed has a pretty tough outer layer and is usually passed through the body before it can be broken down and utilised.

This was quite good, despite 2 mistakes that I made.  Out of habit, I added 2 1/2 teaspoons of yeast - it still turned out, although quite tall, lol.  Second, I didn't add the sunflower seeds at the appropriate tine, so I just sprinkled them on top, which made it quite presentable.  Next time, I'll include it in the dough and save a tablespoon or two for "garnish."

I have tried many recipes with sunflower seeds.  This is the best I have tried.  I made it with all the ingredients as outlined in the recipe.  I did, however, bake it in a regular oven.  This bread is light and delicious.  My husband who usually does not eat bread with sunflower seeds, etc. thoroughly enjoyed this bread as well.  We especially like it for tuna sandwiches.

Absolutely delicious! I like a good crust on my bread, so here's what I do: 1. I put my Dutch oven in the oven while I preheat it to 500 degrees. 2. When the oven is ready, I put the bread on a piece of parchment paper inside the Dutch oven and I put the lid back on. 3. I reduce the temperature to 450 degrees and bake the bread for 25 minutes. 4. Then, I remove the lid and bake it until it is golden brown (15 to 20 minutes).

Wow! Totally awsome nutty chewy bread. I have bad luck with bread machine bread. All the bread I make rises then sinks in the center, so I put the bread machine away in storage...untill I saw this recipe. With all the 5 star reviews, I thought, this must be a great no fail recipe. Sure enough, it was.  Not only did it bake perfectly, it tasts heavenly.  This is definitly gonna make great gifts. Best bread I have ever made. TY SO MUCH!!

All I can say is Wow!  Being a novice bread machine baker, I've tried about 6 recipes with most meeting disaster or unsatisfactory results. I was about to give up and get rid of my machine, but not now!  This is the first bread machine recipe that I know I will make again and again and this bread could become a weekly staple in my house.  It slices wonderfully for sandwiches or toast and it keeps fresh very well.  It is a heavy bread, (at least mine was but maybe I didn't knead it correctly or let it rise enough) however, it is exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted to find a bread similar to the Brownberry breads that are full of fiber and nutrients. I made it on the dough cycle and baked it in the oven after kneading in the sunflower seeds and letting it rise.  I will try it again using the bread machine for the whole cycle to see if it changes the bread any.  I have to admit, I had never kneaded bread before and I had a hard time getting the sunflower seeds incorporated into the dough, so next time I will add them with the rest of the ingredients into the bread machine.  I can't wait to try all the other additions/substitutions that others have suggested.  I took this bread to work and my co-workers consensus was "oh my gosh, who made this bread?!"  THANK YOU for the recipe!  My bread machine has now found a purpose in life!!

This recipe's ingredients are yummy.  :)  I love the nuttiness.  I didn't think it was too sweet or that it needed more salt since I used salted butter.  Mine turned out a little dense because of my impatience...it could have risen a little bit longer, but that was my fault.  I should know by now that great bread is worth the wait.  And I did do this the traditional way.  There are other comments telling how.  I do recommend this bread.

This recipe is definately one to add to your "keeper" file.  I use plain ol' multipurpose flour and it turns out great!  Also, I use 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour and 1/3 cup Oat Bran flour to add more grains to this bread and it is still wonderful!

Great recipe.  I didn't give it 5 stars only bc I had to add some more flour as the dough was very wet initially.  Tasted great fresh or toasted.  My daughter thinks we should go into the gourmet sandwich business with this bread!

This is one of the best breads I've made yet.  I too used flax seed meal instead of whole seeds - more nutriants are absorbed than from whole seed.  I used 1-1/2 cups wheat and 1-1/3 white flours (opposite of recipe) and added 1-1/2 tablspoons of vital wheat gluten to help it rise and add protien.

This is an excellent bread.  I have made it several times and will continue to do so.  Flaxseeds and sunflower seeds are a wonderful combination.  The texture is great as well as the fantastic flavor.  I might try to grind the flaxseeds in the future, because I have heard that they are more benificial that way.  Yummy bread!!!!

This recipe makes a flavorful, toothsome loaf.  I didn't have flax and added cracked wheat instead.  Lovely!  I also added a little more salt.

This was a very good bread! I spread some cream cheese on it right out of the oven and it was amazing! The only thing i did differently was use olive oil instead of butter and all whole wheat flour. I used the bread machine to mix the dough and then i baked it in the oven on a greased cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 25 minutes! MMMM!!! yummy, healthy, and filling! i will definately make again and again!

This was so very easy. It was not a lighty and fluffy type of bread. Right out of the bread maker it was dry like day-old bread. It did not crumble when cut and browned nicely. The taste was not overly sweet, but pleasantly sweet.  I will probably try to tweek the baking time to see if I can adjust the dry texture because the flavor was good enough to warrant trying again!

Great flavor.  Too soft and moist in my opinion, and my loaf rose too high then dipped on top.  After cutting the water a bit and changing 2 cups whole wheat and 1 cup bread flower, it came out the way I like it.

I liked this bread very much but found it for my taste a little too sweet.  i love flax seed so I added a few more.  it raised beautifully then the center "fell" in a bit...so not know why but the taste was nice anyways!  Will make it again with less honey.

This bread is a staple in my house.  I make it at least once a week.  Everyone that has tasted this bread loves it too. I like to experiment with different flavors of honey and go back and forth between dry roasted sunflower seeds and raw.

I am a bread fanatic, my husband would say, and I though this was the best bread I have ever made. Perfect texture, moist and delicious and super nutritious.We are trying to keep the food additives out of our diet and this will be a mainstay for us. We are so thankful for your posting of this recipe.

I made this exactly according to the recipe.  It was good, but there were too many seeds in it for my liking. Nexttime I will try reducing each to 1/4 cup.

I made this recipe according to the directions (come on people, you can't rate a recipe if you didn't follow the directions exactly.) It is excellent.  Since then I have changed it up a bit.  I use a whole packet of yeast and add chopped up dried cranberries.  I also use molasses instead of honey.  I shape it into two loaves and bake in the oven.  It so much better than anything you could buy in a store!!

I set my bread maker on whole wheat
let dough rise twice and removed dough from machine on the "rest" cycle and let it rise the third time in the bread pans for 70 minutes.  I Cooked bread for 20 minutes in a pre-heated oven at 400 degrees. I added corn syrup in place of honey(since I didn't have any honey)I also ground the flax seed in my coffee grinder on coarsest grind.  Will add walnuts as well as sunflower seeds.  I like seeds and nuts in my bread.  I am new at this bread making game...This was a great recipe and it is my favorite and will more than likely be a regular for me.

Very nice recipe, I made it the traditional way with kneading and in the oven. I used white wheat flour from King Arthur instead of regular whole wheat (a milder wheat flavor). Raw sunflower seeds are the best to use, since they won't add any extra salt--I chopped mine up a bit, and will toast them for more flavor next time, before adding them to the dough. The flax seeds upset my stomach a little, next time I will grind them finer and maybe toast them or let them soak in water before adding them in.  Otherwise, it's a great bread for all you seed-loving bread people out there!

This was one of the best bread recipes I've found!! I used pumpkin seeds instead of sunflower seeds, and it was great. I also added an extra half teaspoon of yeast to make it extra fluffy.

This recipe was so easy to make, even without a bread maker OR blender. It only took about 5 minutes to mix and knead all of the ingredients and let it rise. A nice nutty flavor when toasted, as previously commented. I didn't use wheat flour, since I didn't have any, and it still came out great. Thanks!

This is my everday toast and sandwich bread. The sunflower seeds give it a nice flavor and the flaw seeds boost the nutritional value. 

I reduce the seeds by half and sub canola oil for the butter due to my son's dairy allergy.

Love this bread! First time I tried it, I didn't hear the beeper and missed adding the sunflower seeds. It was still great! Second time around I was sure to put them in.... but I think I like it better without! =) Great bread!

Great bread!!!  I have tried many whole wheat bread recipes and they usually turn out very dense and not good.  This was wonderful toasted with cream cheese or accompanying soup.  I am making a loaf for a friend now!!!

This was so yummy - it didn't last long at our house (the only thing i did different was use sunflower oil in place of the butter) I will so definitely make this again - my husband even liked it - he who does not eat bread without jam -- and he ate it plain!

This is delicious.  Dense but still a soft consistency.  My husband loved it and he doesn't usually eat grain bread.  I did add more flour and also some wheat glutin.

Taste, texture, and flavor are outstanding.

A wonderful, dense bread.  I added a little extra whole wheat while it was kneading - seemed a little too wet.

You will enjoy it very much.

I didn't add the flax since I didn't have any, but it still was delicious.

YUM!!  I don't usually bake bread in the bread machine but this one is a winner.  It did take a fair amount of extra flour in the beginning, but afterwards no muss, no fuss and what a loaf.  I'm upset i have to wait until after work to have another slice!

Totally loved it just the way the recipe reads!!! It has a nice nutty flavor, slightly sweet, and super!!! I didn't even butter it or anything. It's good as is. Only the second homemade bread recipe I actually liked.

This bread is the best!  I had it toasted with eggs this morning, with a turkey sandwich for lunch, and beside my salad at dinner!  Next time I will probably add the sunflower seeds along with all of the other ingredients...I forgot to add them at the alert sound, so I had to mix them in by hand.  I also might try grinding the seeds.  My one young son is turned off by the look of the seeds, but I know he would love the flavor!

My boyfriend says this is the best bread he has ever had.  He eats it every day now.
