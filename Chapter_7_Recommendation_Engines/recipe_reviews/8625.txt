I am giving this a 5 star in spite of the fact that I made changes, simply because it is an EXCELLENT base, and also what I have been searching for as far as a recipe that I had eaten at a local restaurant. I personally cooked the chicken pieces in onion and garlic. I poured the chicken/onion/garlic into two cans of condensed cream of chicken soups and 1/2 C white wine.I added shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream. I then added cheese on top and mixed the cracker crumbs with butter and put them on top of the cheese. My daughter loved it. Very, very flavorful meal!!!  Thanks!!!!

this has been a family favorite for years!!  My aunt was the first to make this for christmas, maybe 8 years ago and since no one had a name for it, it became Val's (my aunts name) chicken.  I actually made this 2 days ago to bring as a dish to work and everyone loved it there as well!

What I do to my dish is buy chicken breast on the bone, clean it, take off the skin, sprinkle sea salt on the breasts and let it sit for 10 minutes.  While they are sitting, I boil water on the stove and cook the breasts for an hour.  

I also usually use 2 large breasts and double the soup and sour cream (2 cans cream of mushroom, 16 oz. container of sour cream).  I cant say I've used ritz crackers before, I always use the blue bag of Pepperidge farm stuffing (2 cups) with 1/2 stick of melted butter.  By doubling the soup and sour cream you can go up to 4 breasts if you dont like alot of sauce or stick to 2 large breasts if you want extra sauce (which is good to serve with a side of egg noodles).  My other aunt who also makes this recipe uses 2 chicken breasts and 2 chicken thighs because she finds the chicken breast only is too dry.

This has been one of my kids' favorites for a long time, but I make it just a little differently.  I melt a large package of cream cheese in the microwave and mix it with a can of cream of chicken soup.  I shred the chicken and put it in the dish first, then I put the cream cheese/soup mixture on top.  Then I crunch up Club crackers and drizzle melted butter on top.  You can make this lower fat by using non-fat or lowfat cream cheese & soup, and reduced fat crackers.  It still tastes really good.  I've not found a way around using the butter and still get the same flavor (I love the taste of butter), but this at least helps with the fat content.  I also sprinkle a little garlic powder into it.  My kids, and all of their friends who have had it, love it!!  Very kid-friendly dish!

OH GIRL...Are you serious.  My gawd that chicken is good.  I doubled the recipe, cuz I'm a big girl and like a lot of food.  I used boneless thighs instead -- the dark meat is better!  I fried the chicken a little before I put it in the casserole, and added some brown suga, of course!!

I've reviewed this once before..(loved it then and still love it now).. I just wanted to add that the last time I made this, when I made up the sauce, I also mixed in about half a small bag of frozen peas then continued with the recipe as called for. It was delicious!.. tasted like a chicken pot pie.. I will never make it without the peas again!

I scaled this down for two adults but made some changes along the way. I used two chicken breasts and used a smaller baking dish than recommended. To cut down on the richness, I used only about 2 oz of sour cream. I added garlic salt and pepper. I put in chopped up carrots, celery and some canned potatos I had. This was delicious! Thank you for sharing! Definitely reminiscent of chicken pot pie!

This casserole is very good, however, next time I will make it in a smaller dish.  I used 3 pieces of chicken and it still seemed like the 9x12 dish was WAY too big.  It's a great casserole but realized that it's best to eat most of it right away, when the cracker topping is crunchy.  Doesn't work too well as a left-over (i.e. - lunch during the week) as the crackers got very mushy.  Will make again.

This recipe is SOOOO good and easy.  A great comfort food that my finicky husband (who never likes anything) loved.  Easy to make lower in fat by using low fat cream of chicken soup, crackers, sour cream, and butter.  I didn't notice a huge drop in taste for the fat savings.  Great served over rice.

Very easy & tasty! Substituted cream of mushroom for the soup and seasoned the chicken w/garlic powder and oregano before combining w/other ingredients. My hubby loved it and ate seconds.  Will definitely make again!

I tried this recipe because I was looking for something that I had all the ingredients for and didn't want to go out into the blizzard to get one or two ingredients. Unfortunately, although I followed the recipe exactly, it was so blah that the family concluded it was just "edible" but nothing they wanted to have again - and my family will eat just about anything. If I try it again, I will definitely punch up the flavor and appearance with stir-fried peppers and onions, and probably garlic at the very least. It also needed salt and pepper, for sure!

Good stuff--Will add this to the rotation.  I used wheat Ritz crackers instead of the butter kind and it turned out well.  I'm sure it would have been more scrumptious with the buttery kind, but the wheat was still good.

Delicious! The only change I made was the addition of carrots, peas, celery, and onion. It tasted like a pot pie, only better! Thanks for posting!

YUM! I have to admit I wasn't expecting much from a can of soup and a cup of sour cream but this is excellent. I followed the recipe pretty close. Drizzled the chicken with a little olive oil and sprinkled with salt & pepper and baked on a sheet pan for 40 min at 350 deg. Then removed the skin and just pulled the chicken and added the small amount of cooking liquid from the bottom of the sheet pan to the 13 x 9 along with the pulled chicken pieces. I did cut the sour cream down to 4 oz. and then added a splash of white wine. I also forgot to dot with butter before adding the crushed crackers so I melted the butter and drizzled it over the top. Perfect. We will definately make this again. Thanks for sharing!

Bland even though I added seasoning. The sauce was too thick, I added a little water as others suggested but still too thick & rich for my taste. Will not be making this again.

This recipe is great how it is, and even better with a little added veggies!  I doubled the cream of chicken and sour cream.  When I simmered my chicken breasts in chicken broth I threw in a few carrots.  I diced up the carrots and stirred them into the soup mix along with about a cup of frozen peas!  Very good and super easy to make!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

Doubled the recipe for our family of 6 and made exactly as stated. Wasnt a crowd pleaser in my family. Tasted a little too rich despite serving with rice. Would possibly be better with the addition of vegetables or rice while cooking.

for good old comfort food, this recipe hits the spot.  the sour cream gives the sauce a nice rich texture and taste.  i've used lower fat ingredients without sacrificing the end result, including fat-free plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  i also omit the butter entirely, it's completely unnecessary.   plus, i can't begin to justify serving something with almost 50 grams of fat per serving (heart attack, anyone!!)  thanks for a good base recipe for nights when i need something simple and easy.

This recipe is a 4, but if you want a 5 then don't add the soup but instead add 1 tablespoon of Lawry's seasoning salt to the sour cream then continue on with the recipe. This will kick it up to a 10!

Good stuff...  I added a can of sliced potatoes on top of the chicken and some cheddar cheese between the soup and crackers.  Also put some garlic and onion powder in the soup for flavor.  It was a great way to use up the other half of my rotisserie chicken from last nights dinner!  Wish I had some frozen peas to throw in it though...

Good but very filling & heavy.  Could use a little spicing up.  Family liked it.

This was really good! The only reason it didn't get 5 starts is because their the pan size was way off. No way this recipe would fit in a 9X13 pan. I used a brownie size pan instead. I cooked the chicken with garlic in white wine and just mixed it in with the soup & sour cream. I also added a handful of romano cheese to the top before the crackers. The crackers are essential to this recipe, don't skip. Overall, really good!

Delicious! Fast and easy and the hubby loved it! I added some veggies to the soup/sour cream mix and spiced up the chicken with garlic, onion powder, salt and pepper. A hearty meal that I'll definitely be making again!

I was a bit skeptical that this would taste as good as it did, being so simple with minimal ingredients, bot WOW! What a great surprise and as a busy mom, the simplicity can't be beat. The only thing I did differently was how I prepared the crumb topping (which I do for all of my casseroles)- melted a stick of butter in a small pan over low heat, removed from heat and added the sleeve of crushed crackers, mixing to combine completely. This ensures a perfectly even coating. My husband begged me to add this to the meal rotation and 2 out of 3 of our kids gobbled it up, which makes it a sure winner! Thanks for sharing.

What a great basic recipe, that can be changed up according to whatever you have on hand! I didn't have sour cream, so I used 2 oz. cream cheese, and 6 oz. skim milk. I also threw in half of a vidalia onion (my husband has to have onion in everything), half a package of mixed frozen vegetables I had left in the freezer, and some poultry seasoning. I didn't have any crackers, so I mixed the melted butter with some crushed up cornflakes and covered the top with that. I baked in a 350 oven for 40 minutes, because I figured that would help the added moisture of the onion and frozen vegetables to cook out, so as to avoid a runny sauce. This was very tasty.

This was excellent. I used half the sour cream and half the butter and added bacon bits, cheddar cheese, garlic, onion, season salt and a half a cup of chicken broth. I made enough chicken for a family of 4. Very tasty and finger liken good. I will make this a regular meal for my family.

HE LOVED IT! since it was so easy and so few ingredients i really didnt have high hopes, boy was I wrong. When i got around to eating some the next night, I couldn't belive what a nice, down home flavor it had. I recommend this to anyone, try it!

We make this but with a a few changes. we add a can of cream of mushroom soup, and bacon. Once the dish is almost done we add cooked bacon and smashed crackers. Makes a world of a difference.

Fantastic with great compliments.  Only 1 change made. Use Durkee Fried Onions instead of crackers and in my opinion it made the dish.  I added them towards the end of the baking time. I also seasoned the chicken with Motreal Steak sSsoning and then grilled to add flavor.

I prefer to shred the chicken and mix it into the sour cream/soup mixture.  I also melt the butter and pour over crushed Ritz crackers.  A 9 x 13 pan is too big.

Yummy!  I was looking for something easy to make and this fit the bill.  The whole family loved it and had 2nds.  I didn't have enough egg noodles so I served linguine also.  I preferred the linguine much more.  My only changes were to use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 3 chicken breasts and a little less than 1/4 c butter.  Will definitely make again.

This is one of those recipes that you use as your base and add to your hearts content.  I used broccoli in the bottom of the pan, added the chicken and to the cream of mushroom (what I had on hand) I added about 1/4 cup of sour cream (all I had left) 1/2 cup of ricotta cheese and about 3/4 cup of velveeta cheese. Because of the added cheeses I omitted the butter on top of dish.  I also crumbled up some garlic croutons and sprinkled those on top of the crackers.  This dish would be so good in almost any combination!  This is one of those recipes you could use to the moon and back!
Enjoy as we did!  Thank you for this recipe!!!!!

Delicious!  I used about 2 cups leftover chicken pieces from a roast chicken.  I cooked fresh carrotts and added them to the chicken and sauce mixture before baking.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers, and drizzled melted butter over the crumbs.  I served over slices of home made whole wheat bread.  I'll be making this recipe often!!

I loved this recipe!  I took the advice from the other "raters" and added 1/2 c white wine, 1/2 bag frozen peas, dash of garlic power, an extra can of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 can chicken broth.  It had so much flavor and for extra "gravy" just use the whole can of chicken broth!  I just want to eat the whole dish myself!

Good recipe, but I added to the sauce I made a chicken white gravy base (6 Tbsp butter, pinch salt and pepper, 1/2 cup flour, 12 oz can evaporated milk, 3 cups chicken broth (made using bouillion and water)- made just like a white sauce) and added all-purpose seasoning, 2 tsps cooking sherry and the mushroom soup to it and left out the sour cream.  I also used six chicken breasts - two is far to few for a family of five ;0) Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This recipe is so bad for you that it had to be GOOD!  And it was DELICIOUS!  I did double the amount of chicken and still think that next time I will cut the amount of soup/sour cream mixture in half.  What a fun and decadent recipe!

I used 4 oz sour cream cause that's all I had.  Also cut back to 1/4 c butter because 1/2 c seemed so much!  Otherwise followed this to a tee.  Let's see how it goes.

So good!!!  I did have to make some variations due to missing ingredients.  I did'nt have crackers for the topping,so I used 2 cups homemade breadcrumbs with the 1/2 cup butter.  Also did'nt have sour cream, to my dissappointment.  So I used the next best thing, which was almost a whole 8 0z cream cheese.  Added 1/4 cup of frozen peas , 1/4 cup sliced frozen carrots, 2 tbs chopped onion, 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, 1 2/2 cup of milk to round it out.  The breadcrumb topping was plentiful when I added it before baking, but oh!!  It baked up so crunchy, even the very bottom layer of it!! (bottom layer of breadcrumbs that is)  And the cream cheese sub was sssoooo delicious!!!  Even some chopped bacon would be great!!!

I have made this several times for my family. To make a one dish meal, I add frozen mixed vegetable. I try to find one with potatoes in it so it will be more like pot pie. YUM!

Wow, what a fantastic and easy dish to make! As a college student, I'm often hard pressed for proper ingredients, so I'm glad I found this recipe.  I also halved the butter amount and added frozen peas/corn and sprinkled a little brown sugar over the top, beneath the cracker layer.  Gosh, it was super delicious.     On thing though, the chicken didn't seem cooked all the way, so next time I'll pan fry the chicken first.  Thank you for submitting this!

I used the idea, then improvised.  I put a little butter and season on chicken and baked until done, drained.  Mixed soup, sour cream, and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar and poured over chicken, topped with crushed crackers, and baked until bubbly & hot.  Served with noodles for the kids/rice for the adults.

Yummy!  This is the first recipe I felt was worthy of a review so far.  I sauted chicken pieces in garlic and olive oil first.  I used mushroom soup and added 1/2 can extra because I like extra sauce.  I served over baked potatoes. Also would be excellent over rice or mashed potatoes.I steamed carrots as a side dish.  Also toward the end of the cooking time I put the oven on low broil and made the topping golden brown.

I love this recipe.  I first golden up the chicken breast in a frying pan with some OO or butter.  I always leave these whole to please the males.  Dinner guest always love this, serve with a baked potato, salad and a nice loaf of bread.  Always a winner.

This recipe was just ok for me. I probably wont make it again. Was really blahh.  I added some frozen peas to the mix and still didn't give it great taste. I have other chicken casserole recipes similar to this that my family likes and I will stick with. Sorry wasn't a hit for me.

This dish was very similar to a chicken pot pie. It was pretty good. Quick and very easy. I actually added a can of vegetables for color and taste. I think the next time I will add cheddar cheese. The pan size specified is much too big for only 2 chicken breast. I did 3 and it the pan was still too big.

Very good, quick, and easy. Didn't have Ritz crackers.  So, I cut butter down to 1/4 c. melted. Used approximately 1 1/2 c. cornbread stuffing and approx. 1/4 t. poultry seasoning. Mixed stuffing and seasoning with melted butter until evenly moistened. I also baked a little longer. About 40 minutes or until stuffing turned golden. Yummy!! Next time, I will mix chicken, soup, and sour cream together before putting in baking dish.

This was yummy! As suggested by another reviewer, I sauted some onions and garlic together. I cut the chicken into small pieces and then mixed the onions, garlic, soup, and sour cream (I also doubled the soup and sour cream). I put Cheddar cheese on top and then the crackers. I served it over egg noodles. My husband and daughter loved it!

This is so good~ I cut the chicken breasts into strips. I crumbled the crackers, and added melted butter to the crackers, baked it as directed. I didn't double the sauce, that might be a good idea if you used more chicken. YUM.

This is wonderful and so easy, I make it a lot. I saute choppped onion and celery in butter first, then mix everything together and pour into a pan. I don't layer it, I like the sauce evenly mixed in. Also, I use 2 cups of sour cream instead of one. I serve it with Uncle Ben's wild rice and a vegetable, brocolli goes well with this dish.

Great comfort food. I added garlic powder and about 1/2 cup white wine like other people recommended. We served this over white rice with peas as a side dish.  Eventually, we all mixed the peas in and just stirred everything up.  Will make again!

Yum, Yum, Yum!  Wonderful comfort food!  If you're starting off with raw chicken, try cutting into cubes before you cook it in butter (sometimes it comes out dry if you cook the breasts whole).  I would also suggest to cook it in a smaller dish if you want "more sauce".

I completely eliminated the butter and used FF sour cream to cut down on fat and calories.  I kept the rest of the recipe the same but did prepare it in an 8x8 baking dish.  Might be better with some broccoli added.

This was a very tasty recipe that everyone liked!  I would suggest putting it in a smaller dish, too, and maybe adding some pepper and garlic when cooking the chicken.  I also omitted the butter and still thought it tasted very good.  I'll definitely make this again!

My family really enjoyed this meal.  I used a large can of chicken because I was in a hurry and decided to try some other suggestions like using cream cheese instead of sour cream and adding frozen peas into the soup mixture.  I also melted the butter and drizzled it over the cracker crumbs.  Served it over rice -- so good!

This is similar to a recipe I make at home; however, a pan this size calls for far more chicken...I usually use a package of chicken tenders, fry them to a goldenish color (after seasoning with salt,pepper, & garlic) and for the soup part of it I use 1 can crm of chicken, 1 8oz of sour cream, and 1 can of crm of celery. I mix the soups and sourcream and season with pepper and a pinch of garlic powder and them mix the chicken in. I put it into the pan and top it off by sprinkling buttered italian breadcrumbs. After baking for 30 minutes on 350 I scoop it out and put it atop rice that I boil in chicken broth rather than water. MMMMmmmMMMM!!!!!!

So sinfully good and easy.  A great fast dinner for a working mom with two picky eaters.   I served the chicken with a couscous blend from Trader Joe's called Harvest Grains Blend (it's couscous, Orzo, baby garbanzo, and quinoa).  It tasted fabulous together, and the healthy quality of the couscous blend made me feel less guilty about all that sour cream and cream soup in the sauce!

After reading some of the other reviews I made a few changes and it turned out great.  This will definitely be a long time family favorite.  Changes: used a small baking dish and sprinkled the chicken with ranch dressing seasoning.  Put it on top of rice and everyone had seconds!  Thanks for this recipe!

I poached BSCB and added a couple cloves of garlic along w/ salt and pepper to the water.  I smashed the boiled garlic and added it to the soup mixture.  I also used some of the poaching liquid to the soup mix. to thin it out a bit.  I poured it over cooked spaghetti noodles, topped with the crackers, and baked for 30 min.  I thought it was a good quick meal.  I might add a veg. next time.

This recipe was just okay; nothing outstanding.  It's definitely a kid-pleasing dish because it's basically chicken cooked in soup; but, for me, it lacked something.

Loved it!  Cooked the chicken breasts on the stove with some butter and 2 cloves of garlic.  Made sure to pour the leftover juices on the top of the chicken before adding the sour cream and cream of chicken mixture.  Used probably 50 Ritz crackers and a smidge less butter on top.  So good!

Kids loved this. Seems similar to other recipes that have a vegetable in it. I used multi-grain crackers on top. Oh, also I only slightly browned the chicken before sending it into the oven. 30 mins. cooked everything - any longer would have been a leathery mess.

Awesome!! I followed previous suggestions from this site: I had 3 chicken breasts (which I cubed). I sauteed 1/2 of a medium onion (chopped) with 2 small garlic cloves (minced) in about 2 tablespoons of good olive oil.  I sauteed until the onions were transparent and added the garlic... and then I added the cubed chicken. Cooked pretty thoroughly. I also added 12 ounces of broccoli cuts (still frozen) when all the chicken was cooked I added 1/4 teaspoon of poultry seasoning.  In a separate bowl I mixed 2 cans of Cream of MUSHROOM soup, 8 ounces of sour cream and 1/2 cup of white wine. I mixed that in with the cooked chicken, garlic and onions and broccoli. I dumped it all in a casserole dish. I melted 1/2 cup of butter and drizzled that over 2 cups of herb seasoned stuffing and tossed. I sprinkled that over the casserole and then topped with about 1/4 cup of French Fried Onions. Baked  at 350 degrees uncovered for about 30 minutes in a 9x10 inch casserole dish. All I can say is WoW !!! The smell in the kitchen was unreal. Everyone in my family loved it and it fed 6 people, 3 adults and 3 kids and I had leftovers. I will be making this again. Not only is it easy to make but it is inexpensive. By the way , I did not use the low sodium soups because I didn't have them. The casserole was not salty at all! We ate it with spinach risotto and leftover Corn Casserole III (found on allrecipes).

I make this alot...I like saucy, casserole-y type dinners.  It can get a bit salty so I use reduced sodium ingredients and it turns out well!

Sorry, but we weren't that crazy about this chicken...it was pretty bland. I did everything according to the directions, so I'm wondering if maybe my taste is just different than the rest of the people who rated & loved this recipe. It wasn't bad- we've just enjoyed better. Thanks anyway :)

This is a great recipe, and it's so easy to add things to to make it suit your tastes. I used three boneless, skinless chicken breasts as that was what I had thawed instead of just two. Otherwise, I chopped up half an onion, two celery ribs, and sauted it in a little bit of oil with two minced garlic cloves and added that to the "sauce" mixture. I also added about 3/4 cup of cheddar and then topped it with the butter crackers. I did use a lot less melted butter on the crackers - only about two tablespoons. It turned out really, really well, was very good, and was enjoyed by my family. My daughter kept making, "Mmmmm!" noises as she ate. Next time I may try adding broccoli, as this is definitely a great recipe to add all sorts of things to, and it's really easy. I highly recommend it!

This was a great quick meal. My family enjoyed it. I had to substitute the cream of chicken for cream of mushroom as that was all that I had on hand. I would make this again when I am in a pinch for a quick meal.

This will be one of our new regular meals.  I used mushroom soup and a few dashes of Emeril's Original Essence.  What a dish!!! The next time I make it, I'll use 2 cans of soup and 2 cups of sour cream for the extra sauce.

This is just a great easy quick recipe that you can leave as it is or do a million other things with - add veggies, spices, etc. I made it almost like a sort of mock chicken pot pie adding carrots and peas and celery. Very versatile - loved it.

You guys this is seriously a awesomw recipe.  I cook up my breasts in lots of evoo and throw in one shot of Early times.  I have found you can substitute Any cereal for the coating - I used cheerios once and then raisin brand was so excellent and tender and the time I added fruit loops it was sweet and colorful!

Added a can of chicken broth and lots of minced garlic. This made tons of sauce, but we served it over egg noodles and the ammount was just perfect. Absolutly delicious!  Almost went with breadcrumbs, but I'm really glad I sent the beau to buy some 'buttery round crackers' instead--don't substitute, the crackers made it perfect!

Oh my gosh, this was yummy. First thing my husband said was, "this ones a keeper!"  I added paprika, garlic powder, and mushrooms to the sauce.  It was great with sourdough bread, peas, and a baked potatoe.  The sauce was even great on the potatoe.  MMMMMMM!

Very good, cheap and easy.  I made a few changes to lower calories and fat- I used light sour cream, 98% fat free soup, I did not use the butter and added a cup of cooked rice.  As noted previously, it needs to be in a smaller dish.

This was better than I had hoped, the wife and kids all gave it a very good. I did use 1 can mushroom, 1 can chicken, of soups , doubled sour cream, and served over white rice. Almost forgot ritz makes a garlic butter cracker (talk about the perfect topping), hope you give it a try.

Really great original dish. I agree with previous comments that a little more sauce was needed but otherwise, extremely flavourful and actually really fun to make. Thanks a lot!

This meal is cheap, easy and delicious!  My entire family loves it and requests it often.  Tastes great over rice and with peas on the side or mixed right in!

This was good - nice change for chicken, but nothing I'm dieing to have again tomorrow.  I cut up the chicken and pan seared in some butter, garlic, onions, italian spices, pepper, seasoning salt.  In a saucepan I melted can of cream of chicken w/ mushrooms, some sour cream and cream cheese (probably combined to equal the 8 oz) with a little water to rinse out the soup can. Combined with the chicken into a 8" baking dish, melted some butter in the micro added the sleeve of crackers mixed with the butter and topped the chicken.  Baked 350 to finish cooking chicken then broiled for a few minutes to toast the crakcers on top. Served on Angel Hair pasta (would add peas next time) Again - good & comforting just not amazing. UPDATE:  warmed this up for lunch today for hubby & I, his on leftover mashed potatoes mine on toast - even better than the original meal - less creamy more flavor and spice.

Thought this might be bland, but actually was very tasty.  I added sliced green onions and celery to give a little crunch.  Would add peas and carrots if I had them.  My husband said to put it in the rotation.

This was great! The leftovers were wonderful as well! I changed a few things though. I used chicken tenders and browned them in olive oil first with some salt, pepper, and onion powder.  For the sauce, I added some white wine and I used cream of mushroom soup because thats all I had. I also layered some frozen zucchini with the chicken and then poured the sauce over this and it turned out amazing! Had it with white rice and the chicken just falls apart, delicious!

Made this tonight for me and my hubbie. We are both getting over colds and wanted something simple and soothing, and nothing too fancy since we can't taste much anyway.  This came out nice, a very easy and quick last-minute meal. I used two 5 oz. cans of chicken instead of fresh or frozen since that's all I had. I cooked the soup with the sour cream for a few minutes on the stove & added a little milk & some chicken broth I had open in the fridge.  I also added garlic and onion powder which really added a nice dimension of flavor along with thawed frozen peas, and cooked it in an 8"x8" glass dish.  Very simple & homey & great for a last-minute or quick meal.

I used cream cheese instead of sour cream and I think that made it too thick.  Next time I will use the sour cream or add a little milk or something. The crackers make it great! crunchy and a little salty. I added some frozen peas and I think would be fairly boring without them. I will for sure make this again.

Was pretty good - I had a couple of substitutions because I was out of sour cream and butter rounds.  I used 8 oz of fat free evaporated milk instead of sour cream and saltines for the topping.  I also added a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese before I put the crackers on top.

I am giving this recipe 3 stars only because my husband ate it and didn't mind it. However, I didn't like it all that much. The combination of soup and sour cream is extremely thick and rich and was giving me a bellyache right then and there as I ate. The taste from the soup was very strong. I DID like the buttery cracker topping. That was an excellent addition. The pan size was too big. I used 4 breasts and it was still too big. I would consider making this again as a base and modifying it considerably. Thank you, Kim Fischer, for posting this recipe.

Excellent! I had to use Philly cream cheese in lieu of the sour cream and was hesitant but the end result was superb. I did not use chicken breasts either- instead used thinly sliced cuts. My husband ate four helpings and my 10-year old son had two. I will absolutely make again soon.

My family really loved this recipe and I followed it to the T, the only suggestion I would have to other people making this is you might want to bump up the servings a little, I'm feeding 3 children (3,7 and 8) my boyfriend and myself, I didn't even get to taste it because it was gone by the time everyone else was done eating, I made enough for 7 servings.

Pressure cooked meat with lime and garlic and added Garli Garni to soup mixture. Recipe was recalculated for 8 servings. 2 cans of soup used per recipe.  My Husband said it was very bland and my older children didn't care for it for the same reason.  On a good note, my 4 year old liked it.  Needs more seasoning.

This was fantastic. My six year old really enjoyed it. I added a can of corn and used low fat soup, low fat sour cream, and low fat crackers. I didn't skimp on the butter though! I followed the advice of the previous reviews and made it in a 2 quart casserole dish. I'll definitely make this again and again!

This was great!  It didn't sound like there was a whole lot of spice to it (I like my spices) so I added California style Garlic&Pepper seasoning to the chicken before applying the sauce.  I also didn't have Cream of Chicken: Cream of Mushroom works just as well.  Yummy recipe!  Thank you!

This was a quick and easy recipe. The only thing I had a problem with was the mushiness of the crackers after this sat in the fridge overnight. I would still cook it again, but I might try and find something else to use instead of the crackers. Maybe some sort of chip.

It was good, but my husband and I will be making this recipe a little different. Instead of cutting the chicken breast into cubes I will use the whole breast. There wasn't enough chicken for all of the sauce. But other than that it was delicious!!!

My family LOVED it - from preschoolers on up. I bet I could hide veggies in it next time...I used fat-free cream of chicken soup and low-fat sour cream, and omitted the butter on top. Still loads of flavor and there was none left.

This dish turned out better then I had anticipated.  I used Kingshorses suggestion and made a white sauce to add to 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  I used 5 bone-in chicken breasts and added frozen mixed vegetables.  With crushed Ritz crackers on top this dish was delish!  My husband gobbled it up and we have leftovers for tonight. Very easy recipe to prepare.

Very tasty. I think it was a little dry, may cut down on the chicken next time or make more sauce. Also, the addition of peas sounds good as a previous reviewer suggested. Make in a smaller baking dish, the one called for in the recipe is too big. Will make again.

I thought this recipe was alright but if your going to eat a lot of fat and calories I wouldn't choose this recipe. It was filling but not very tasty. My husband hated it so I told him I wouldn't make it again. Sorry kim, my family didn't like it.

I loved this! Its very tastey and easy to make. Although I wish the recipe was a bit more clear.... I cooked the chicken ont he stove top first. I believe 2 breasts means 4 hlfs... So as you'd buy it in the store 4 peices. Since they are already halved.. Thats the only way my brain could fathum the proportions and the large pan size. I mention this because a few others have posted with some confusion. I hope that clears that up and if I am wrong please let me know... I used 2 cream of mushroom soups and followed everything else to the T. Very delicious.

Its a favorite in my house especially with my 10 year old who can sometimes be picky about trying new things. After this recipe she always ask when we're going to try something new again.

My family loved this! But I also made some changes to make it more of a one dish meal.  I added some cream cheese to the can of soup,plus a little sour cream. Then I steamed some diced carrots and peas and added to the chicken & sauce. I topped it with frozen biscuits, which I quartered, and baked for about 15-20 min, or until biscuits were done.  Yum!!

A bit rich but will definitely make this again. Maybe I added too much butter? The kids really liked it and my wife even said it was good.

Instead of precooking the chicken I baked the whole thing together for just over an hour. This was a very easy and great tasting recipe. Even our picky younger one enjoyed it.

This was so simple and really tasty, very much like a creamy chicken pot pie. I cut down just a bit on the sour cream and added some milk along with some garlic powder,some frozen peas, and paprika then served it with egg noodles. Yum!

I could eat this every day! I used mushroom soup, added more chicken, and omitted the sour cream. I think this would be great with toasted almonds on top. Loved it!

Very easy comfort food.  I added a jar of sliced mushrooms.  Also, I put the crackers in a ziplock bag, and crushed them up, then poured melted butter in the bag, and mixed the butter into the crackers.  No mess.

This is a good base recipe. There is no way this fits in a 9 X 13 pan though, you need a smaller pan. I used 3 chix breast & cooked them in garlic infused oil, added some garlic seasoning & pepper. Next time I'll add veggies & double the soup/sour cream mixture. I also sprinkled poppy seeds over the crackers before cooking. 

I didn't have any rice, and next time I will be sure I have some as it needs that extra something. I'm thinking rice might be it.

Overall, a good base recipe to build off of.

This meal was simple, and so yummy. I tried it with the cream of mushroom and it was great! The left overs were also good. This is a good starter meal for someone who is new to cooking!

I have been making this for years.  I omit the sour cream and crackers until the end.  I cook my chicken and soup in the crock pit with some kind of veggies.  When I get home I cook the noodles, mashed potatoes or rice depending on my mood.  I then add the sour cream and crackers to the creamed chicken and bake it.  It is so yummy.  I always add veggies to this recipe because I can get my family to eat more veggies.  I hope this helps.  It is a GREAT Base for multiple recipes.

It's better if a) you mix the chicken and sour cream/soup mixture, and b) add some chopped onions

Made this last night and my family loved it.  I took to suggestion of frozen peas and then added some shredded carrots I had on hand. I served over butter noodles. This is a definite keeper in our family!

Well I changed it a bit too...I used 4 chicken breasts since feeding the whole family.  I also used 1 can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and one can of golden mushroom soup (what I had on hand).  Finally, I used French's onions instead of crackers.  Turned out ridiculously good! Love this recipe as a base, will probably change it up other ways too!

This was so easy and delicious. I used chicken breast tenderloins and just cooked them whole for about forty-five minutes. I didn't expect much from this recipe since it seemed so simple, but really the taste was great and I will definitely make it again and again.

This was delicious! The only thing I did differently was the chicken preparation. I seasoned heavily ( based on other reviews) with pepper, garlic salt and Italian seasoning and placed in the slow cooker, pouring chicken broth over it, for 3 hrs, until the chicken shredded up.

I just made this tonight for dinner. It was awesome! I made this with cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken soup, this is what I had on hand. I also used 3 chicken breasts instead of 2. Served with rice. This is a great, quick after work dinner.

Just made this for the first time.  Loved it but next time I am going to add peas and instead of Ritz crackers, I'm going to use the French's Fried Onions.  Seems very kid friendly and easy to make.

I have made this dish again and again! I use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, and saute the chicken with onion and garlic before mixing it all together. Also a light topping of mozarella cheese over the crackers adds a perfect touch. Yum.

Very rich with the Ritz Crackers, I would definitely have to serve this over top of something. It's an interesting meal. I may try the egg noodles as suggested but as it is alone it was just tooo creamy for me.

So delicious!  I didn't do a casserole.  I just baked 4 chicken breasts whole in this mixture.  I seasoned the raw chicken.  Then I layered my pan with cream mixture+chicken+cream mixture+cracker crumbles.  I sprinkled garlic powder over the cracker crumbles, and placed cubes of butter on top.  I baked for 45 minutes at 350.  Dangerously good!  Couldn't stop eating it.

This was very good but I did twist it up a bit you see I doubled the recipe and I put 2 packets of ranch dressing powder 2 table spoons of red wine vinegar 4 table spoons of extra virgin olive olive oil and put thous ingredients in a plastic bag and then put 8 peaces of chicken in the bag and then let it marinate in the fridge for an hour but 1 day would be better, it makes it very rich.

This was so easy to make! Added some rosemary and lemon to the chicken when cooking the chicken. Also added some shredded cheese with the crackers... great simple meal.

Came across this recipe when I was pregnant with my third son and needed something quick and easy. This was delicious and my kids absolutely loved it. I still make it and my third baby (now 18 months) loves it. I recommend this to anyone looking for something simple and tasty.

I have made this recipe many times!   It is a family favorite. I have tried it many different ways and my families favorite is when I use cream of celery soup instead of the cream of chicken.  It makes a great flavor!  Might I add I don't even like celery but this mixture with the celery soup is just wonderful.

If you love creamy goodness...you'll love this recipe. Since I'm only cooking for two, I used 3 chicken breast and cut down the sour cream to 1/3 cup. Instead of putting pads of butter, I melted it and added to the cracker crumbs. Served over wide noodles with a side of mixed veggies...YUMMY

Good starter recipe, but I felt it was rather bland.  I would make it again, but will try cheddar cheese soup, and maybe some broccoli, and spices.

WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER, as Guy Fieri would say.  This is absolutely delicious and sooooo easy for a hearty weeknight dinner.

I made the following changes as suggested by others:
- Sauteed diced chicken breast in a little butter and added garlic powder (not garlic salt) and little salt.  I used four good sized b/s breasts.
- I doubled the sauce (used LIGHT sour cream) and then mixed the sauce mixture with the cooked chicken pieces and then poured the entire mixture in a 9 X 11 glass casserole dish.  This size worked good, but would be way too big if you don't double the sauce and only use two breasts as the recipe calls for.
- I did NOT double the cracker topping and I mixed the crushed crackers with the melted butter to create the toping to sprinkle over instead of sprinking the crackers and dabbing butter over the top.  Made it really easy.
-Cooked uncovered 35 minutes at 350 and got perfection.

I served over slightly buttered and slightly salted egg noodles as others suggested.  I think next time I'll try the white rice as we are "rice" sort of folks moreso than egg noodles.  It was great with the egg noodles though.

It is rich so I served the casserole with the sauce (definitely gald I made extra sauce) over the noodles and a side of steamed broccoli.

Will defintely make this again.  DEFINITELY.  Thanks Kim for the post.

I have made this recipe twice and loved it both times. The second time I made a few alterations. I didn't have sour cream, so I used 1 cup plain Greek yogurt mixed with 1-2 Tbsp milk. I also didn't have enough Ritz crackers, so I used just enough corn flakes to coat the dish. Turned out great!

Good gracious - how can simple be so tasty?! I used cream of chicken soup with herbs and added onion when cooking the diced chicken. It was scrumptious! I know some reviewers didn't agree but it was good leftover too. I can imagine a lot of variations that would make this different every time.
