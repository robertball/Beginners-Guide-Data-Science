I have tried this one before, but a bartender kicked up a notch for me and I make them from time to time. 1oz Champagne, 1oz Peach Schnapps, 1oz Vodka. After shaken and poured add OJ and drizzle with Grenadine.

MMMM MMMM goood!!  This recipe is excellent!  I like in in champagne flutes though, it's a little more festive!  Also, drop a few raspberries in the bottom of the glass--what a great taste!

What can I say. It was a perfect New Year's Eve drink. I made it with Vanilla Vodka. I also served it in Champagne flutes. It looked very elegant and tasted great. The last sip is a kicker. Pure alcohol all the way through.

after playing with this recipe, I tailored it to a good brunch drink.  I did equal parts orange juice, champagne, and peach schnapps.  The original is also very good, but way to strong to serve for brunch (which was my intention)

Very good....great flavor. I made the recipe exactly as is and loved it. I made some for my friend and she liked it with less vodka and more champagne(I just reversed the amounts)

My 1st review on allrecipes :) I love this site. My bestfriend and I discovered this recently. Ok back to the drink...It was a hit at my Mother's Day gathering. I tried it with the champagne and did not like it. Maybe I would have w/ a sweeter champagne or sparkiling wine. I sub'd the champagne with the same amount of ocean spray white cran peach juice and it was delicious. Another reviewer suggested freezing the raspberries and I really enjoyed them frozen. Great recipe, refreshing and pretty too. Try it and you will be hooked.

Wow... this drink was so strong! I am going to try it again only the next time I am going to try mixing it with crushed ice... more like a slushy.

Surprisingly delicious, refreshing, and not too sweet. I used pear flavored absolute and garnished with blackberries. Fab!

We enjoyed these "Belletinis" last night for New Years Eve.  I served them using martini glasses.  Both the ladies and gentlemen enjoyed, but it's definitely more of a "girly" drink. Will try the raspberries next time...cute idea.

I made this martini for New Year's and eveyone loved it! I'm addicted to them and now it's the only drink I bring to parties.  I did mix it equal parts of vodka and schnapps b/c I thought it tasted alittle better and added more champagne.

I tweaked the recipe just a bit; I made a base of 12 oz. Peach Schnapps, 12 oz. Orange Juice and 6 oz. (Ciroc) Peach Vodka.  I filled champagne flutes 3/4 the way up with the base and added Prosecco just barely to the top with just enough room for a splash of Grenadine!  Compliments all around; in fact my Brunch lasted well into the night!!!!

This was so strong I could barely drink it.  I ended up adding it to OJ so I could get it down.

I only give this two stars because I tweaked it to my liking..I omitted the vodka and did pretty much half peach schnapps and half champagne with 3 rasberries in a champagne flute. This tastes great!!

Very yummy!  Everyone loved!!
I switched the quantities of the champane and vodka...used 1/4 cup champane and 2 ounces of vodka.
Froze the raspberries before putting them in...less mushy.  Served in Martini glasses.

I reduced the vodka to 1 oz. Too strong otherwise. It's funny reading reviews that say they switched the amount of vodka and sparkling wine. 1/4 cup is the same as 2 oz! Anyway, great drink and everyone loved it!

Did not alter the recipe. They were smooth and tasty. A skewer of raspberry and lemon garnish made them impressively pretty!
