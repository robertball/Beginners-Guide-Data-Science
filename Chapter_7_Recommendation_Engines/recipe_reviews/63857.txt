This was a recipe that the entire family enjoyed! Slotted spoon for no juice or add a little juice to your rice. Leftovers can be used in quesadila or used as salsa! Yummy Yummy!

I had to doctor this up quite a bit...hence the 3 star rating. I added cheese to the end result, as well as cilantro and sour cream. I felt like the beans didn't have enough flavor...maybe some Pico de gallo/salsa/tomatillo salsa would have accented this nicely? I also added additional garlic to the beans. Thanks for the recipe, might make again with the additions.

I was hoping this would taste better, it didn't. I'm going to agree on the salsa idea.

I was not that crazy about this recipie.  I would suggest a little less on the chicken broth and using it more as a salsa type w/nachos.

this was so incredible.  I found it very good as is, and I used some left overs with tortilla chips...I thought I was in heaven!

This recipe was ok, but very bland. I drained off most of the chicken broth added a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and some taco seasoning to the left overs and it turned out wonderful!
