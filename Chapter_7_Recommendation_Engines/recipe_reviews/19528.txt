This dessert is light and sweet. THe recipe makes a ton - I made it for six and had it left over. Could not stand the idea of throwing it out because I enjoyed it so much but the bananas started to turn. Suggest you halve the recipe unless you know your crowd will eat a lot of this.

I made a few changes to this recipe since it made so much and the bananas turn dark. I only used 1(16 ounce)container of whipped topping. I reduced the sugar to only 1/2 cup. Omitted the lemon juice and bananas and added a small bag of marshmellows & 1 can of coconut. I also used the cherry juice to make the dessert a nice pink color.

An easy dessert to make and will satisfy your sweet tooth. Use lemon juice or pineapple juice to coat bananas to prevent the bananas from turning black. I also added only 1/4 cup of sugar.

Cut the recipe in half as per the reviews. Everybody enjoyed it and wanted to rename it the Banana Split desert. YUM!

I was looking for a quick, easy recipe to use for some fresh cherries.  This one caught my eye, and so I used fresh cherries rather than maraschino cherries.  I also took suggestions from previous reviews and deleted the bananas and lemon juice and added a couple tablespoons of coconut.  Since I didn't have any sour cream, I used cottage cheese after running it through the food processor.  I also added miniature marshmallows and deleted the sugar.  The finished product had a surprisingly good flavor with not much sugar!  Will definitely make it again.  Thank you for sharing it.
