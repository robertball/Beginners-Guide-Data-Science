Hubby and I really liked this.  The coconut flavor was faint.  Next time I'll remove the stems from the mint sprigs and just add the leaves.  Be sure to remove all the white pithe from the limes so your drinks won't be bitter.

This is yummy.  Added a bit more of the coconut to it, and since I noticed one reviewer mentioned the Wray & Nephew white rum...I remembered a bottle of this "moonshine" like rum I brought home from Jamaica, mon!  I put some in....be careful with this over-proofed white rum if ya' use it.  Hard to find here, though...I've only seen it in Jamaica. It's what they put in those wicked good rum punch drinks!  Have fun!  ;-)  Thanks for the reminder, blacksnapper!!!

This was really refreshing, the only detracting factor was it wasn't coconutty enough if that makes sense, I added a couple of jiggers of Malibu and that did it

Very refreshing on a hot summers day though the flavor of the coconut was almost non-existent.  Added Malibu Rum the second time and that was the missing element!  Thanks AngS for the submission!

I made these for my girlfriend & I and we both loved it! I used coconut flavored rum and just the juice of two limes. You can find the Coco Lopez at Walmart Super-centers, Super Target stores, Jewel, Big Lots and many others. There's a list of stores that carry it on cocolopez.com...It comes in regular and lite! I couldn't find it at my local grocery store the first time I made this and used a different brand, but noticed after I found the Coco Lopez that even the regular has less than half the calaries, sugar and fat than the brand that I bought the first time...and it's cheaper!! :)

This was fantastic!  I had to make a virgin one because I was pregnant, but still so good!  Didn't change a thing.  If you don't like pulpy, I would recommend substituting the limes for frozen limeade or lime juice.  I didn't mind it at all.  Will definitely be making this again!

This is so good!  Used fresh mint from my garden and Malibu coconut rum and fresh limes, along with the coconut milk.  Wonderful!  Kicked it up a notch on the run and lime.

this was ok, but i found it difficult to prepare, especially since i only have a magic bullet. it wasn't good enough to want to make it a regular but it was a nice change

I thought it was a great concept but lacked flavor other then lime... Recipe says white rum but a spiced or coconut rum is a must(I haven't tried yet). There is no sweetness whatsoever with the coconut cream alone. I might even throw in some shredded coconut for the second batch. One can of cream makes 4 servings. Also I will pour the rum generously:)
