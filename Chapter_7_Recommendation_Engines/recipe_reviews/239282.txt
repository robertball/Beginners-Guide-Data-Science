This is a very good twist on the classic. I used canned peppers but the flavor didn't seem to be compromised. The flavor was certainly enhanced by the earthy flavor of the peppers. This was delicious on it's own and on tacos, fajitas and the usual dishes you would put guac on. It shined when we used it on hamburgers, the next day, and even ate them on our frittata. Definitely worth trying. Thanks for sharing this unique recipe.

Oh my, this Croc Guac is good! Can't stay out of it. I'm not sure this will serve 12, heck I can eat  6 servings myself. The Anaheim chiles are the key ingredient. Thanks for the keeper Bill.
