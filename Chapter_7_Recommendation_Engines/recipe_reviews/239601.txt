I'm giving this 5 stars, even though I made some tweaks, since my family just finished the whole pan in one night (everyone was still picking at it after dinner).  Ok, here's my tweaks.  Since just salt and pepper just seemed too bland, I added some onion powder which was just the right touch.  Also, since we don't like runny casseroles, I beefed up the rice about a half cup.  Lastly, we love cheese so i added quite a bit extra.  Last note is that I broke up the biscuit dough into small pieces and scattered them on the top which covered it perfectly.  Quick, easy, cheap and goooood.  Our new go to comfort food.

This was very good and the leftovers were just as tasty as it was fresh from the oven. Super easy to make, especially if you have leftover rice and/or chicken. I did have to cover with foil about halfway through so the biscuits wouldn't burn while cooking all the way through. Will definitely make this again.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I made the rice with chicken broth, covered it with foil and baked it until there was 10 minutes left of cooking time. I removed the foil and put the biscuits on top, I then baked it until the biscuits were done.

This was one of my favorites as a kid and haven’t found one close enough to moms recipe but this is almost there! I did tweak a few things I added one large yellow onion while I was cooking the chicken and seasoned it with pink Himalayan salt pepper and onion powder and a T. Of minced garlic. For the water in the pan I added 2 T of Worcestershire and cooked threw. When I mixed everything in a mixing bowl I added two cups of fiesta cheese and I steered a bag of mixed frozen vegetable and did 1 10oz Can cream of chicken and 1 10oz Can of cream of mushroom just like my mom would do. This made of one killer recipe!!! Will make again and again my family loves this!

I made this for dinner tonight and I did make a few changes to add a bit more flavor. I boiled the chicken breasts whole in a pot with 3 roughly chopped carrots, 4 roughly chopped celery stalks, 2 onions quartered, 2 bay leaves, 4 crushed garlic cloves, 2 Tbsp salt, 2 tsp pepper and water to cover all. I boiled all that for about an hour and a half then drained, discarded vegetables, chopped the chicken and followed the recipe. I also used cream of mushroom soup and whipped up a batch of drop biscuits to top it off. This is a good base recipe and can be altered to your specific taste. Wonderful! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

It was just okay. Nothing to write home about, but a meal the kids will eat that is easy to make. 

For sure add flavor to suit your likes.

Need to cut the flaky biscuits in half or they won’t cook throughly.

Ultimate comfort food! Did make modifications based on scale and personal preferences. 
Used 2 regular sized cans (couldn't find size called for) of cream of chicken with herbs and one cream of chicken with mushroom (2 would have been better as it was quite runny or decrease milk); increased rice to 1.5 cups raw; increased chicken to 4 big breasts (2.5 pounds total) and cooked with herbs and finished with wine; and used a large thing of biscuits. 
Would definitely make again, but would cover biscuits for first half of cooking as they browned before casserole was sufficiently warmed through.  Would also likely change the cheese to maybe swiss or italian blend.

I actually have it in the oven right now. I chopped up some fresh broccoli spears and some celery and added it to the base mixture along with some seasonings. I have it in the oven on 400 for about 30 minutes then I will turn it down and put the biscuit dough on top. Here's what it looks like right now.

This recipe is now a staple in our home. The only thing I dont recommend is putting biscuits on the bottom, for some reason mine never baked and we were left picking out raw dough out of our casserole as we ate. other than that its yummy!

My husband and I really liked it. Next time I would cut my chicken smaller. My son and his friend weren’t into it. I think they didn’t like how rich it was. (Hence 4 instead of 5 stars)

This is a winner in our house! I only use one small can of cream of chicken, and either use more milk, or add sour cream, as well as a tsp of chicken bouillon to make up for the rest of the soup called for. I also like to add peas to get a veggie in and add color. The other change I make is homemade biscuit dough. Either that or my oven not cooking as hot as it should has made my cooking time closer to one hour, but still a yummy, easy dinner.

We had most of a Costco rotisserie chicken leftover so we used that and followed the recipe except we added a cup of frozen peas, a carton of sliced mushrooms, and a cup of thinly sliced cooked carrots and this is so good it’s going to be a regular on our dinner table. Seasoned with salt, pepper, lemon pepper, granulated garlic and granulated onion. We cooked it 25 min foil covered and 20 min uncovered and I don’t think it was super good.

Made it and everyone loved it! Made it with more rice, added peas, garlic powder (because there MUST be garlic in everything I make), onion powder, a dash of cyan and a tiny dash of nutmeg. I didn’t have enough Mexican blend cheese so added shredded mozzarella and some Parmesan. It’s a lot of prep work but well worth it! Thanks.

I decided to use what I had on hand. Used cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken. Used a red lobster drop biscuit kit we had sitting collecting dust lol. Turned out great and supper quick. We even used 2 cans of cubed chicken. I cooked the rice in chicken broth and used Mexican shredded cheese mix. I used the red lobster rosemary and butter melted mixture on top of the drop biscuits and we absolutely loved it. We all need to save time and eat good too. Toss a couple sides to go along with this meal of your choice and be done with dinner.

I liked this pretty good but instead of plain rice I used yellow rice. Also found for cream of chicken used a can of c of chix with Herb and c of chix with mushroom. Still was good but still bland so I will be tweaking it further next time.

Oh my goodness - SO comforting and good. I cooked the chicken with onions and added Adobo seasoning. I also added a can of french style green beans and a can of cream of broccoli with the cream of chicken (added extra milk). Also added more cheese. Comfort to the MAX good. The only thing is that the biscuits were not done, even after 45 minutes (I used jumbo). Next time, I'll make those separately.

Good but could use more seasoning/flavor on the chicken.

I added a few spices when cooking the chicken, and will use the smaller biscuits and roll them out next time.  They were not cooked on the bottom due to the moisture from the cream of.  I also added small chopped up bits of broccoli for some vegetable goodness.

Picky son and husband gobbled it up with compliments from my teenager. :) .  I did add a bit of rosemary, thyme, and onion powder to the chicken; and a bit extra cheese.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was so good and i will be making this for my family again. My 3 year old could not get enough. I did buy a bigger thing of biscuits to cover the top more and added more cheese into the mixture. The best part about this recipe is that it taste better warmed up for leftovers so thats why i gave it 5 stars!

The Recipe is Great! I
I just added some extra flavour that my family likes. Sataued onions, Minced fresh mushrooms, green onions . I cooked the chicken with Italian spice , pepper and garlic powder. 
Recipe turned out fabulously and my family asked me to put it into my regular meal rotation.

Added peas and covered for a third of the bake time to prevent overcooking the tops of the biscuits. Super delicious! Can't wait to  make this for friends!

It was delicious! I sautéed some onion and celery first and added a little sour cream. Very very good and easy.

This was delicious and easy to make.  My Indonesian husband loved it too, very similar to a dish there called burbur ayam.  Will definitely be making this again!
