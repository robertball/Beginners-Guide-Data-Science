I'm giving this a 5 because it tasted really fresh and all the fruit in the recipe doesn't turn brown which allows you to make this a few hours in advance. I also used canned pineapple chunks because it was a lot cheaper than buying a pineapple.  Unlike other reviewers, I thought the club soda/grape juice combo added to the recipe and I could taste it on the fruit.  I served this with some chicken garlic pizza and it was perfect.  Thanks!

I am giving this 5 stars because it is the only fruit salad that I have ever made where I didnt worry about yucky brown fruit in my salad.  I dont think that the juice/soda mix made much impact on the recipe.

I took this to a  church group and everyone loved it.  The "juice" turned red from the strawberries, but it tasted great and refreshing!

This was awesome. I made it for a babyshower so I used grape juice and club soda but it was still excellent. Easy to make. Looks pretty in the bowl and Super refreshing.

Really good, but not incredible. I will probably make this again, just so I have a different way to eat fruit other than plain.

I used this recipe for my daughter's graduation, it was a big hit.  It is something you can make ahead of time, very refreshing.

I made this for my fiance's family this year at Thanksgiving... HUGE success~~ all the kids LOVED it also. It's very easy, cutting the grapes and strawberries is the only thing that takes any time. I used canned pineapple to save some money. We were not disappointed.

I also used canned pineapple and fresh banana's (which did not turn brown.) Instead of the club soda/juice I used gingerale.  It was good, but nothing to rave about.

Refreshing. I used sparkling cider. It tastes even better after it has chilled overnight. I had to use cantaloupe because the grapes at the store were not ripe. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy!  This has become my favorite fruit salad when I want something that is more "fruit" and less "Cool Whip and pudding" like some fruit salads.  The "sauce" part of this is quite mild if you use juice rather than wine (I haven't tried it with wine), it really just enhances the fruit a bit so you need to use ripe fruit that you really like.  You can use whatever fruit you want (though of course apples and bananas would turn brown fast), but I always include some kind of melon because the melon seems to absorb the juice and become extra tasty.  Something to note is that the club soda loses its fizziness quickly.  Consider pouring the juice or wine (or a mix of both!) over the fruit and refrigerating it, then pouring the club soda over it right before serving.  Something that we like to do is skip the juice and carbonated water and simply use bubbly non-alcoholic apple cider or pear cider or cranberry-apple cider or any number of those carbonated juices in wine bottles.

Good, but somewhat unremarkable in my house. Absolutely nothing wrong with it; a fine standard recipe to keep on hand for just about any occasion.

i made this with red grape juice, bleckberies, and squirt. the purple juice chenged the color a bit, but it still tasted great. i also sliced white grapes in half and they absorbed the juice, and kept their coloring. it wasn't fabulous, but its pretty good.
never eat this with cornbread. i leaves the most unappealing aftertaste.

I made this to go with a green enchilada casserole and it turned out great. It was nice being able to put it together ahead of time and was a very refreshing side dish on a hot day. I was concerned about how it would look and taste left over, but it was still yummy the next day.

I split the recipe in half, and made half of it using the white grape juice and half of it using cava, a Spanish sparkling white wine. In a side-by-side comparison, my husband and I MUCH preferred the cava version.

It was a good fruit salad...we used it as a fruit cocktail before Thanksgiving dinner.   Everyone liked it and commented it was very juicy!  I used white grape juice and white grape juice flavored seltzer.  It didn't seem bubbly, but was tasty.

This was a refreshing salad.  I doubled the recipe for a large group and there seemed to be a LOT of "sauce" as I doubled that also. The adults ended up spooning it out and adding rum to it for a cocktail.  I will make it again but will not double the "sauce".  Thanks for the recipe!

It was alright, but not spectacular.  I found that the fruit was a bit soggy when I served it.
