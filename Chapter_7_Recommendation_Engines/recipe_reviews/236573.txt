Great  fast and tasty weeknight dinner. I did not prebake the naan, our pizzas baked in 10 minutes, then I broiled for 1 minute to brown up the cheese.  Used green pepper, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, olives and hot peppers.

Color me impressed! This was an amazing little personal pizza! To save on calories please do NOT use so much oil, and unless you want gobs of cheese 1 cup would be sufficient and generous!

I cut back on the olive oil and on the mozzarella cheese. This is a delicious, quick, and easy recipe. Thank you for sharing!

I sprayed the naan first with olive oil, toasted lightly, added my veggies, seasoned with Italian seasoning and garlic powder, topped with grated romano cheese and baked it.  Low fat, low calorie, high satisfaction. Wish the sodium content of the naan was lower though. Thanks for the recipe.
