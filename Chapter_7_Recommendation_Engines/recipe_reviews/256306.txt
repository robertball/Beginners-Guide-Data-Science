This was a tasty dish, Fab!  I did serve with a fried egg on top, for breakfast, and it was delish!  This hash had just the right amount of flavor, with very little heat.  The avocado added richness, and the cilantro gave a perky, greeny-fresh taste.  Plus, this had great staying power, keeping me hunger-free till lunchtime.  Thanks for the idea!

Quick and delicious! I used a bag of those "Simply Potatoes" that  you can find near the eggs in the grocery store, and they worked great! Didn't have an avocado on hand, but had a bit of left over guacamole, so I just served that on the side. We had this for brunch today, so I also added a fried egg on the side. My husband and I both enjoyed this!

So simple to make, yet so flavorful. Excellent as is! Great also with shredded cheese and sour cream on a tortilla. Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

We had this for lunch today and enjoyed it very much.  I used Hunt's Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes and Trader Joe's Roasted Potatoes with Onions and Peppers.  This recipe comes together quickly and was very tasty!  Thanks for a very yummy lunch!

My goodness this is amazing. I used fresh potatoes and cut them by hand, so they were a a bit big and took longer to cook. I added some sour cream and served it in fresh corn tortillas. This stuff is so freaking good, I could've eaten it all myself. Beware! Thank you for the recipe

Loved the recipe, and used fresh cubed potatoes instead of frozen because of dietary reasons. It is SO good and easy for a week night meal. We added eggs, sour cream, pico de gallo and red sauce as toppings for a "full breakfast for dinner". Its a keeper and we'll def make this again.

Loved it! Picky husband even enjoyed it. The only change I made was using dried cilantro instead of fresh (that's all I had on stock).

Great inspiration! I didn't follow the recipe too closely but had most of the ingredients and some tortillas and it was nice to to change things up.

I  really like this recipe! I used frozen hash browns with onions and peppers  but followed the recipe  exactly other than that. It is so quick and easy, I do top with an over easy egg for a complete meal. Very simple but most often that is best :)

This was a quick dinner after a hectic day. I had potatoes to use up so I peeled, par boiled them and proceeded to fry as the recipe called for.  I added diced jalapenos and made some holes in the potatoes and dropped in some eggs to soft boil.  Served with grated cheese and sour cream it hit the spot!  It is a great base recipe that you can easily make your own.

Wonderful flavors in this dish, but I did not like the canned tomatoes.  Second try, used chopped fresh tomato, much better!  Very good recipe, I make it often!

This turned out great! I added cumin and garlic to the meat onion mixture and served these with tortillas and scrambled eggs on the side for those who wanted more protein.  I set up a contiment bar with cilantro, cheddar cheese, & picante sauce,  allowing some personalization  I will defiantly make this again. Thank you for a great recipe!

A nice change of pace for dinner with several ingredients that I had on hand. Mine turned out very spicy, but it was still yummy. I used the hash browns with onions and peppers just to save time. I will make it again.

Loved it. Used hash browns instead of home fries and added some green onion also.  Had leftovers the next day with some poached eggs on it!

Tried it with a poached egg, rather than fried. The runny
yolk was "icing on the cake"!

This was yummy.  I only added half a can (approx. 7 oz) of diced tomatoes.   Also added a few shakes of cayenne pepper and about a half tsp. of cumin.  Yumm.  So good.   It was a hit, even with my picky son.

This might be just as good, and less greasy, substituted with Soyrizo. Also too many potatoes- I would cut way down and add an egg or 2 instead.

5 stars for the idea however I did alter the recipe to our tastes. We eat a lot Mexican food including pico de gallo which I substituted for the diced tomatoes. Also I topped ours with 2 fried eggs each and a sprinkling of shredded pepper jack. My local supermarket makes their own chorizo from ground pork shoulder instead of pork snouts, salivary glands and lymph nodes like most commercial chorizo is made from and that is what I used.
