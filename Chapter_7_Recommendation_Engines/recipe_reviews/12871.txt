This was different, The lobster meat was very sweet. My lobster never turned white, I did not get that. Also I think my oil was to hot. My lobster browned to fast. But it was still good. Next time and there will be a next. I will check my oil temp before cooking.

It was good-  I think next time I will put equal amounts of cornmeal and flour for the mixture.    It had a great taste and it did make the lobster meat very very sweet.    I will make this again

I added a photo for your recipe.  We fried a giant lobster tail for my husband's 50th birthday last night.  The rest of us had normal sized tails.  Your daddy's recipe is superb!  The seasonings did not try to compete with the lobster flavor.  It was the perfect blend of savory sweet.  I wanna do it again!

I was looking for a fun informal way to serve up lobster meat, and this is a good one. We used chunks of frozen lobster tail meat instead of whole lobster tails. It was very sweet and very good. I don't like spicy food, so I substituted regular pepper instead of cayenne and added a little garlic salt for flavor. It was a bit on the bland side, but still absolutely delicious and complimented the delicate flavor of the lobster meat perfectly. A keeper recipe for sure.

Perfect!  Our fishmonger gave us a bag of frozen rock lobster tails and we needed something new to do with them.  My husband wanted them again the next night.  I added a little more spice to the mix otherwise perfect.  Thank you.

This is a treat,  instead of cornmeal I ground up some sesame sticks and added a bit of flour!
Wonderful and fun!

I normally do not write reviews... But I will have to say that OMG this was the best tasting lobster that I have ever had.   I added a lemon wedge for taste instead of butter.   The lobster was so sweet and succulent with a hint of lemony flavor; it so good that I didn't even use any butter.   This is definitely going to be a fav in my house!!   Enjoy!!

I totally agree with Gina C. This is the simplest and best recipe out here, all the spices used do not over power the taste of the lobster nor is the breading to heavy or thick like most, this is the only recipe I use for my family and highly recommend this recipe to everyone to use. Nicole S.

Great recipe for Lobster. I changed some amounts, but used the same recipe, overall.  I used a little less cornmeal and a little more flour. Also, I did 1 Tablespoon of onion/garlic powder and 1/2 T of cayenne pepper.  Turned out great for six tails.  Thanks for the post.
