I know some hate when others post reviews that tell all about what they did differently, but I figure...hey, many people have made this & found it to be great....so why not tell what I did...maybe it will inspire you!!!
1.)  I made my meatballs out of ground chicken!  They only need 15 mins. at 400..just be sure to lightly spray your sheet with cooking spray!  I also combined the minced garlic in with my chickenballs....
2.)  As another reviewer suggested...I omitted the mayo & replaced it with ricotta...did I mention that the ricotta/cream cheese mixture was good enough to spread on my body?!?!
3.)Probably the biggest change I made was how I used the bread....I bought the roundish italian loaf, did my best Subway sandwhich artist impression, and removed the top portion.  I then removed most (but not all) the fluffy bread guts to make a bowl (and tossed the guts).  I smeared the cream/ricotta cheese mixture on the bottom & sides of the bowl, and added some to the underside of the breadbowl lid.  (This way b/c I thought spreading each breadcube with the mixture sounded too time consuming...and half the breadcubes prolly would of ended up popped in my mouth!!!)  I then layered the cheese & chicken balls, baked 25 minutes WITHOUT the breadbowl lid, and about 5-10 with the breadbowl lid in place...to serve, just slice....my "boys" (my fiance & his best friend) raved over this for at least an hour....and they are food snobs!!!!

This was possibly the most amazing thing I've ever made! I put my whole loaf of bread in the pan and stuck it in the oven while it preheated to toast it because I knew I wouldn't like it if it was soggy. I bought 1 and a half pounds of fresh meatballs instead of making my own to save time and I sliced my bread into 7 slices instead of cubing it so it would be easier to fit in the pan and easier to spread the cream cheese mix over. I microwaved the cream cheese stuff for about 30 seconds to make it more spreadable. I skipped the water to avoid soggy bread but added an extra cup of spaghetti sauce since I had more than a pound of meatballs. The result was so delicious I thought about it all the next day. My bread wasn't soggy and there were enough meatballs and sauce to make every bite loaded. My boyfriend didn't like the mayonnaise taste so next time I'll use less of that but I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who enjoys meatball sandwiches.

With some tweaks, this was pretty darn good.  I couldn't imagine mayonnaise combined with the other Italian ingredients, so I used ricotta cheese in place of the mayo.  I made sure the bread was day-old and crusty so it would not get soggy.  Even the next day, the bread was fine.  And I didn't use any water with the spaghetti sauce, just sauce and garlic.  This was a hearty, stick-to-your-ribs type casserole - perfect for cold winter nights.

I read all the reviews and decided to follow everyone's advice. I used frozen meatballs, didn't use any water or mayo, and I toasted the bread first. I then layered the slices of toast, spread with cream cheese, then cubed by hand. My husband and sons absolutely loved it! We had leftovers which my teenage son has been eating as an after-school snack. I'm sure I'll make again.

My casserole-hating husband liked this, but said it was too mushy.  Because of time I did not read the reviews for this before I made it and I wish I had!  You defiantly need to omit the water and I will toast the bread next time.  I donâ€™t think you need 1/2 cup of mayo, 1/4 cup would be plenty.  Also, next time I will increase the Italian Seasonings to 1 Tablespoon.  I mixed the mayo/cream cheese mixture in a plastic baggie and then cut the corner of the baggie so I could pipe on the mixture. I made the meatballs according to my recipe; meat, fresh garlic and equal parts Italian bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese.  All and all, this was yummy and a nice change of pace for my family!

This was a hit with my son and husband.  After redading other reviews I decided to use garlic bread (Texas Toast or Pepperidge Farm) instead of Italian bread.  I toasted it first in the oven and then cubed it.  Tossed it with the mayonaise and creamed Cheese mixture.  Also made my own meatballs by adding egg and some extra spices.  It really turned out delicious!  Thanks, Holly

This is absolutely delicious!! So different from most casseroles made with pasta or rice.  My family said it was even better than the meatball sandwiches ordered in restaurants.  As for complaints about the bread becoming soggy and the casserole turning out like mush -- read the directions and follow them exactly.  It says to spread the cream cheese mixture over each bread cube.  Be sure to do this and cover the bread cubes completely because it prevents the tomato sauce mixture from soaking into the bread and making it soggy.  I recommend this recipe highly and it has become one of our favorites!

I have made this several times with varying degrees of success. However, I think I've tweaked it to our liking by being skimpy with the sauce and skipping the extra water and garlic. I've used all kinds of bread, French works well, too and heat and serve bread sticks slice into bite sized pieces nicely. The meatballs are good, and I'm not always crazy about meatballs. But the cream cheese mixture is what makes this so yummy! This is an excellent recipe!

This was delicious.  I toasted the bread, reduced the mayo to a little over 1/4 cup, and reduced the water to 1/2 cup.  It wasn't soggy at all.

This recipe was good and added some variety to the usual speghetti and meatballs. I used regular onion for the meatballs b/c I don't think green onions cook as well. Instead of cutting the bread in cubes I figured I would keep it more like a sandwhich and cut the bread in thick slices and layered the bottom of the baking dish with the slices. I got the bread good in toasted in the oven beforehand for about ten minutes. Then I placed the meatballs on the bread and poured room temp sauce on the top. I kept in the oven just long enough to melt the cheese. I think this kept the bread from getting soggy (slicing, and toasting). I also topped the whole thing with fresh minced garlic. This was really good!

My friend made this casserole for me after I gave birth to my daughter. It was absolutely delicious! I make two batches at a time...one to eat right away and one to freeze for hectic weekends. Freezes beautifully!

Made this for dinner and my in-laws stopped by.  I was so proud I had a beautiful meal prepared that we could share with them.  It was sooo good.  I sliced the bread and toasted it a little.  I arranged them on the bottom very close to each other.  I smeared the cream cheese stuff completely over the top edge to edge.  They were not soggy at all.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly water and all.  We will make this again!

My kids and I thought this was wonderful. I did make a couple of changes though. I omitted the mayo, and didn't add water. But instead I made my own sauce which turned out to be about 3 1/2 cups, so I was only 1/2 short of the liquid. I lightly toasted the bread cubes first as well. I will definatly be making this again! but I think I'll make more of the meatballs,which will require a little more sauce. But that's ok. It tasted just like a meatball sandwich to me! Great recipe Holly. Thanks for sharing it!

We liked this. I omitted the onion in the meatballs and added an egg to help hold it together, salt and pepper. I have been making my italian mother in laws meatballs for years, hers are the best! These weren't bad. The secret to a light fluffy meatball is the right amount of breadcrumbs and several eggs and a bit of water,and some cheese and seasoning. Eggs make them fluffy and tender. I will use her recipe for the meatballs. I didn't have any homemade sauce and we don't like sauce in jar. So I used a 29 oz. can Contadina tomato sauce. It's makes 3 cups, heated on stove with 1/2 tsp. basil,1 tsp. chopped garlic and salt and pepper. Not bad. I used a 14 oz. size italian bread minus 2 slices (husband got into it) and it was plenty. Lightly toasted in the oven. Didn't use the water. Covered each piece of bread as stated with cheese mixture and it came out great! With crispy pieces of bread through out. It wasn't soggy at all. Delish! Thanks Holly!

I printed this recipe months ago.  I kept it in my file of "have to try recipes" and finally found the time last week to play with some of those recipes.  Boy, am I sorry I didn't try this sooner!  Before all of us had food on our plates one of our daughters was already telling us how good it was and how we needed to make this again!!  I didn't toast the bread like some of the others suggested, but will try that next time just to see the difference.  I used meatballs from the grocer's freezer section, because it was the week before Christmas and that much time I didn't have!  We loved it and fully intend to use it again and again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was so yummy!! I used previous suggestions and used ricotta instead of mayonnaise. I also used a roasted garlic bread instead of italian. I cubed it into crouton size pieces and baked it in the oven until nice and crispy. I used jar spaghetti sauce, but I should have used a little bit more, because it was a little bit dry. All and all, I will definitely make this again!

I had a large group of people to feed (and alot of big guys who love their meat & taters meals) & chose this as it was fairly cheap & easy.  YUM!!!  I did make a few slight revisions after reading some other reviews on here.  First, I used 1/2 beef and 1/2 Italian sausage for my meatballs (that's how we make ours around here) and they turned out very yummy.  Second, I didn't add the water to my sauce.  Also, I lightly toasted the Italian bread once it was cubed & it really helped to spread the cheese mixture.  In place of the mayo I opted for ricotta cheese - it may have been slightly greasy with the mayo and I was afraid it would overpower the rest of the dish.  Both pans were GONE at the end of dinner...sooooo good.  This is for sure some filling comfort food.  Thank you for sharing!!  :)

Delicious recipe.  I did follow some reviewers suggestsions and cut the mayo by half and toasted the bread.  It was still a little soggy so next time I will probably cut out the water.  For those watching their waistlines - I used reduced fat cream cheese, low fat mayo and low fat mozzarella and it was still very good.  Also, I didn't cube the bread, I sliced the bread into 1" thick slices to make it easier.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you!

The recipe was great!  The cream cheese/mayo middle was a little too much, next time I'll only use half of the mixture.   Overall we enjoyed it!

This was delicious. I read a ton of reviews and changed the following 3 things: I omitted the water completely, swapped the mayo out for ricotta cheese and toasted the bread in the baking dish before topping it with the cheese/sauce. The bread was still soft but not overly mushy. Everyone cleaned their plates and wanted more (good thing this makes plenty!) Will make this again, definitely (I want to try Garlic Texas Toast next time) :)

Really good with my changes: 1) I subbed ricotta for mayo, 2) added dried minced onions and a little more Italian seasoning to the cream cheese/ricotta mixture, 3) toasted and cut the bread in half then spread the cheese mixture on it, 4) omitted the water and added a little Italian seasoning to the sauce, 5) heated some frozen meatballs and sliced them before laying them on top of the bread and cheeses, 6) sprinkled more mozzarella on the meatballs and covered them with the sauce.  Family liked it a lot!

I enjoyed this rustic dish.  Next time though, I would make my own meatballs, as these are not memorable. (And although I love green onions, they didn't seem to stick well, it was odd.)  I also used my own homemade spaghetti sauce (it has plenty of garlic), and therefore left out the last addition of garlic.  I also left out the water (per reviews) - and the bread was not soggy whatsoever.  The substitution of the mayo with ricotta cheese is really a good idea, and goes very well with the whole idea of the dish. I quickly/lightly heated the cheese mixture in the microwave to make it easy to drop onto the bread in teaspoons.  I did not concern myself with the cheese being perfectly spread out, just did even clumps throughout.  This was great.

My wife liked it but the rest of us thought the bread was soggy and nothing special.  Probably will not try it again.

Great idea!  I used some of the modifications others mentioned. Namely --- using light cream cheese and not a lot of mayo...just enough to zing it up (and used nonfat).  I used a different meatball recipe as well b/c really this recipe is only as good as the meatballs!  I used crusty french bread, sliced up 1" thick, toasted it lightly, spread with the cream cheese/mayo mix, then just cut each piece of bread in half. I just used marinara, no water. 

Other changes are that I used roasted garlic (from a jar) in the meatballs, garlic/parsley powder in with the cream cheese mix, and no additions to the sauce.

YUM!

Bread came out very soggy, and the taste of mayonaise and cream cheese was overwhelming. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the meatballs were decent.

My family loved this recipe, it was a change to our usual dinners. I did make a few changes. I toasted the bread first then spread the cream cheese and mayo mix. Then I cut it up in cubes and put it in the dish. Then I put the mozzarella on and baked for 5 minutes before adding meatballs and sauce. Bread was still crunchy and tasty!

Love it, love it, love it!  The cheese mixtures was great. I ate all the leftovers myself.  Do not add the water.  I also used frozen meatballs and it was soooo easy to prepare.  I don't make many things twice, but this I will.  Great for a party!!

This recipe was pretty good.  Unfortunatley I was a little sick when I made this recipe, so I couldn't really enjoy the taste of it.  I did follow others responses by not adding water, by cutting the maynaise, and toasting the bread first.  However, the only thing I would still change the next time I make this is not cubing the bread.

I just made this recipe again and it turned out much better.  I omitted the water and reduced the mayo.  I sliced the loaf of french bread length wise and did not cube the bread.  This made it much easier to spread the cream cheese mixture over evenly.  My boyfriend had 3 helpings!  I do want to spice up the meatball's next time .. thanks!

This was very rich and filling. The weather was quite cold for a fall evening last night and this hit the spot. I thought it would be really a complicated recipe, but it was easy enough. I used bread slice, and I see why you should cube your bread first. You had to cut it out of the pan, and it wasnt easy to serve up. The flavor was just wonderful. I like the cream cheese and mayo, it gave it a twist. I also cut the water out and it came out great! Thanks Holly!

Fantastic recipe!  I did not add water to the sauce and used meatballs I had made then frozen (saved time when making this recipe).  
I added the garlic to the cream cheese/mayonnaise mixture, then heated it in the microwave and spooned it over the bread cubes, then spread it evenly with a spatula.  Topped this with most of the cheese, then the meatballs.  Over this, I poured a jar of spaghetti sauce and the remaining cheese.  
When I baked this, the bread came out crisp on the bottom and didn't get doughy since I didn't add the extra moisture.  EXCELLENT!

This was fantastic.  I didn't have enough sauce so I used let water.  Just right - the bread was a great adder.  We thought it tasted like Lasgna/Pizza.  Very good.  Thanks  and super easy to make.

This was a HUGE hit! My husband and I loved it and we invited my parents over for dinner and they also loved it. I did use the mayo and I thought that it gave it a great flavor! I always try the recipe the way it says first and then change it if I dont like it. But this is fantastic!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing

This was mediocre at best. Not only did I not care for the meatballs (too BLAND!) or cream cheese layer (overpowering), I wasn't impressed with the melding of flavors or how the finished product presented. Without a question, BIGGUY728's meatball sandwich is FAR superior. It is and always will be my favorite way to eat MB subs. The concept of this is unique, so I'll give kudos to MARBALET for creativity's sake (hence my four star rating). Having said this, I'm not sure how "original" her idea is.... This recipe has appeared in several TOH publications over the years (I have a lot of old TOH magazines lying around). The only difference is that the TOH recipe instructs to slice (rather than cube) your bread. Who knows which recipe is original!!!  As with any new dish I try, I couldn't resist the urge to make a couple of changes. My biggest change was to do as Adrian did and hollow out a round loaf of Italian bread. This  worked but wasn't "ideal" (yet another great idea in "theory" that's actually only "so-so"). I also added garlic to my MB's rather than my sauce. It's a real shame I won't be making this again. I REALLY wanted to like this, but my hubs and I agree it's not for us. Thanks anyways, MARBALET! :-)

This casserole has a wonderful rich flavor.  I had homemade meatballs in the freezer to use up, so I did not make the ones that went with this recipe.  I made all the rest of it as written.  The cream cheese layer is very rich.  The next time I make it I need to figure out how to tone it down just a bit.  I paired this with a simple lettuce salad and some fresh fruit.  Made for a very nice meal.  Thanks Marbalet for posting this recipe.

This recipe is very good and easy - it should not be expensive to make - I had most of the items in my pantry.  I did reduce the water and instead of adding it to the tomato sauce I mixed it in with the cream cheese mixture to make it easier to spread over the bread.

The recipe as written is good. I buttered the bread and sprinkled garlic salt on it then toasted it in the oven while it was preheating, made it perfect, not soggy at all. I missed vegetables though so the second time I made it I browned the meat with chopped onions, celery, green and red peppers and used a large jar of a maranara sauce. Turned out great

Very good and out of the ordinary recipe.  It's very different than anything else you'd ever make for dinner.  I used french bread, cut it into cubes, then toasted it under the broiler (stirring it every minute or so).  After that I tossed the toasted bread cubes with the cream cheese mixture and it worked great.  It wasn't soggy at all.  I also only used 1/4 cup mayo.

This was not only good the first time, but as a leftover!  Some of the bread was soggy, but the rest wasn't.  The only thing I'd change is to make the meatballs real small so it was easier to have some meatball with each bite!

If I could, I would give this 3.5 stars. Per others, I reduced the mayo, increased the italian seasonings, and ommitted the water/garlic in the sauce. I also toasted the bread prior to baking BUT instead of cubing it, I layered the sliced/toasted bread on the bottom of the baking dish. I think the cream cheese mix is just a tad too much for us, but without SOMETHING there, I think it would be too dry/bland. Another thing - It says preheat to 400 but we bake at 350? 50 degrees seems like a large difference so I baked at 400 for 30-35 min. The meatballs were done and the bread was not soggy. It looked awesome and I don't think its the recipe's fault in ANY way that we were only "okay" on the result-I really just think it is our personal preferences. Afterall-even the best recipes can't please anyone. Thanks for the unique recipe Holly.

My family loved this one!!! It was really great, and the first time I ever made meatballs in my life. The one little mistake I made was having half the amount of bread and putting on the same amount of Mayonnaise as the recipe... The Mayo made it a little heavy, so next time - I'll definetely do it again - I'll still use 8 lb of bread, only half the Mayo. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I was very surprised how good this was. I loved it. My family thought it had too much of the mayo/cream cheese mixture. I will put a thinner layer on next time. I didn't cube the bread, but cut hard italian bread in quarters.

Everyone liked this!  There was a little too much sauce, and I must admit I did NOT spread the cheese mixture on each individual square of bread--if you pack the cubes in closely, then you can spread it as a layer--much easier.

My husband the picky eater loved this and so did my 2 year old. I didn't have any green onions so I used onion powder and garlic salt. I also used garlic bread instead of italian bread since I saw another reviewer had done this. The only complaint I have about this recipe is that I don't really like the taste of the cream cheese, mayo mixture. I think next time I make this I will use ricotta cheese instead of it.

Excellent!! Will make again for company since it made alot!! I used sour cream instead of mayo and not quite so much cream cheese, and I used regular onion as someone had said that green onion did not mix well. Soo good!! I can hardly wait for " must go" night!!!

I used another recipe for the meatballs and I did substitute ricotta for mayo.  I used garlic bread (texas toast) and it was still soggy.  I think it would be much better to cut down on the cream cheese/ ricotta mixture.   I would also either put the bread on top or make the casserole without the bread and serve it over garlic bread instead.  It was a nice idea, but really needs some tweaking to be great.

Excellent.  Just some small changes based on other reviewers.  I added oregano, italian seasoning and garlic to the meatballs.  I swapped ricotta cheese for the mayo and did not use the water for the sauce.  I did toast the bread before hand and just spread the cheese mixture on each slice.  Turned out super gooey and yummy!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Whoa.  I actually made the recipe without any changes because I thought, "this is so strange it just might work".  Well, we tasted it and just looked at each other, perplexed.  The tastes were okay, I guess, but the texture was off.  I think it was the cream cheese even more than the mayo that put us off.  I gave the recipe two stars because I really like the meatballs!  I've never used parmesan in them before, nor cooked them in the oven.  I'll definitely be doing both again.  As for the overall recipe, we were disappointed because it sounded fun.  I think I might try the idea again, but make the filling more italian (like stuffed shells or lasagna) and omit both the cream cheese and the mayo.

I have made this before and we loved it; however, instead of doing bread cubes, I cut the loaf of french/italian bread into slices about 1/2 in.; then spread the cream cheese filling (much easier) and it was excellent, not soggy at all.

I actually had someone else give me this recipe and my family and I didn't like it at all. The bread was soggy and too mayonaise tasting. I won't even bother trying this recipe on my own.

Excellent!!!  What a great tasting recipe!
My hubby and Dad were a bit unsure when told what I was making, but both were blown away by how good it was.  
I didn't have time to read the reviews before making it, but next time I will remove the extra water, and use larger pieces of bread.  I used Italian Sausage buns cut into hunks.  Hubby also suggested Sausage balls, instead of meatballs for a change too.
Excellent!! Thank you

My husband and I loved this dish! I don't however, like this served as a casserole. Next time I will cook the meatballs and sauce all day in a crockpot, and serve over toasted french bread with the cream mixture. The bread, even toasted, got soggy in the casserole mixture.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I used frozen meatballs.  The bread was soggy, but not in a bad way.  It had a more creamy and cheesy consistency.  I might try frozen Texas toast garlic bread next time for a change.

The was a great base recipe. I made a lot of changes though. I placed purchased, frozen meatballs, 1 large can of Hunt's Italian Sausage spaghetti sauce and 1 can of tomato sauce (seasoned for use on pizzas) in my slow cooker and cooked it on high for 3 hours. I sliced 3 sub rolls lengthwise and lightly coated them with a mixture of cream cheese, mayo, black pepper, 1 tsp. of italian dressing dry mix, and grated parmesan cheese. I broiled the bread until it was golden brown and crisp. I then topped it with the meatballs /sauce and an Italian cheese blend.I then placed it back in the broiler until the cheese began to brown. The bread was perfect, not too soft or crunchy! Delicious recipe...the whole family loved it...even my ultra picky son! Thanks for the idea. Will make again.

We really liked this! I needed to use up a loaf of Italian bread and was looking for something different. I followed the recipe closely and the only alterations made were per other reviewers....I used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef, 1/4 c mayo, and no water. I also toasted the bread under the broiler, spread cream cheese 'blend' over toasted bread, then cut into cubes. It came out perfectly with the modifications. I would have rated this a 5, but when I mentioned this dish a few days later no one could remember eating it. I had to remind them what it was.

Following others suggestions: Increased gr bf to 2 lbs,(increasing onions, parmesan and brd crumbs), adding 1 egg, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Rolled meatballs small. Put minced garlic in crm chs mixture. Made crm chs mixture the night before and refrigerated until ready to spread.  (Maybe this helped it not be soggy?) Used twin loaves French bread, slit lengthwise, toasted. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS!  The crusty side of the bread got crustier, and was hard to cut through. Next time will slice and toast instead.  Used enough extra sauce to completely cover. DID NOT USE WATER. Served this last night for my Bunco party and it was the first thing to disappear, and the most requested recipe.  Definitely a keeper!!!

Kids and I didn't care for this recipe at all. Too few meatballs and I didn't like the mayo taste.  With that said however, my husband had three helpings.

I followed the recipe as stated, subbing frozen meatballs, light mayo, and omitting the garlic.  Next time I would add the garlic to the mayo/cream cheese mixture and would let the bread dry out overnight or lightly toast it first.  Hubby really liked it!

This was a good recipe, but I do think I'll make a couple changes next time.  First, I'd use at least 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef.  There just weren't quite enough meatballs in this recipe for my family's taste, and the meatballs were the best part!!  Secondly, I did not care for the mayonnaise/cream cheese mixture.  Next time I think I'll try ricotta cheese for a more lasagne-like taste.  Also, I made the bread in my bread machine, and I think this was an extra nice touch.

I read all the previous reviews and omitted the water as well.  In addition, I added black olives and green peppers in the sauce - the same toppings I put on meatball sandwiches.  I loved it!  I did find a trick to keeping the bread from becoming soggy though... instead of cutting the bread into cubes, I used pre-sliced french bread and left it as-is.  I spread the cream cheese on each slice as I arranged them in the pan, then used leftover bread and cheese to fill in the gaps.  I loved the leftovers too... if you're a cold spaghetti or pizza eater, you'll enjoy this right out of the fridge!

This was ok. I used rolls instead of bread, but they still kind of disappeared once the sauce and meatballs got all mixed in. I used store-bought meatballs solely because I didn't have time to make the meatballs. The mayo-based sauce was definately interesting, and not as strong tasting as I had expeced it to be. Interesting switch from the usual sandwiches, but I'm not sure if I'll try it again.

Having read the reviews, I toasted the bread, cut the mayo down and didn't add any water. We all loved this, but next time I would only use half the bread (I ended up with a double layer!).

This is a tasty as well as fun recipe to make. I've made it two times. I toasted Italian bread slices lightly.  Then mixed ricotta cheese  together with a heaping teaspoon full of Good Seasons Italian salad dressing mix (dry packaged mix) instead of using the mayonnaise and cream cheese (saves, time, money & calories).  Spread a medium to thin layer of ricotta cheese on toasted bread slices and top with shredded mozzarella.  I used pre-made small Italian meatballs (not as good as my homemade...but a timesaver) and added our favorite spaghetti sauce topped with remaining shredded mozzarella.  I did not add water to the spaghetti sauce as there are enough moist ingredients in this recipe. Prep time:15 minutes  Cook time: 30 minutes.  Your guests will love it, your kids will love you...and best of all you didn't spend the day in the kitchen!

Although the final product tasted delicious, I found that cubing & toasting the Italian bread was a royal pain.  The meal was very heavy and filling.  It seemed to be lacking something - like a vegtable or pasta.  This isn't a very well-rounded, healthy meal.  It gave my husband heartburn!  Next time, I'll serve with a salad.

Oh my goodness, this was delicious!!!  I think the only modification I made was to cut my french bread in half (top to bottom) and top it with the meatball mixture rather than cut the bread into cubes (that just seemed to be a lot of unnecessary work).  This was so creamy and indulgent and I absolutely loved it!  I think I would like to try making it with Italian sausage rather than ground beef, but either way, great recipe that we will definitely be making again!

This goes down as one of the most unique and wonderful recipes I have come across. The key was reading the reviews and lightly browning the bread first in the oven or using days old bread to keep it from becoming mushy in the recipe. I browned mine. I also did not add the water and cut back just a bit on the mayo. I also found using a flavorful bread really added pizazz. My brother had given me a loaf of 3 day old bread from Paneras that was wonderful by itself but in this recipe even better (sorry, I do not know what kind of bread it was so experiment and have fun!) Great recipe!

Just fixed this recipe tonight. It was NOT good. I thought the recipe seemed odd with the inclusion of 1 cup of water with the sauce, but I followed it to the letter.  The taste was OK, but the texture was horrible.  The bread turned to a mushy pasty mess that ruined the dish. I guess the lesson is that if the recipe doesn't look right, trust your judgement.  It may be better without the water, but I won't be trying it again to find out.

This was different and good. It makes quite a bit. The bread would have been better toasted also. Maybe I will make the bread into garlic croutons and try that next time.  Thanks for a unique recipe!

Based upon other reviewers, I skipped the water and mayo and added ricotta cheese. I also used homemade meatballs that were already prepared and needed to be used. My husband really liked this, my toddler picked at it, and I just thought it was ok. Something is just a bit off for me on this. It was a nice change but I believe I'll stick to regular meatballs subs in the future.

I used store bought meatballs but it was still fantastic! I also used seasoned bread. I like this way better than lasagna and it's easier. I'm a big fan of breakfast casseroles made with bread. If you don't like soggy bread, this not the recipe for you.

This is a very rich but good recipe.  I took the same advice as others with no water, added garlic salt, etc.  Tasted good, but even better the next day as a leftover after the flavors had a chance to mix.  I would make this dish once in a while.

This is a big hit with my family.  I followed the recipe directly, but could've used premade meatballs and been the same turnout.

This turned out much better than I thought I would.  I thought that the bread would be soggy, and it wasn't at all.  The only thing I would do is put in less mayo as the flavor of it seems to take over.  I had to put in a lot more seasoning to balance out the taste.  I spread the cream cheese mixture over the bread first before cutting.  Didn't make sense to spend time tediously applying it to each little cube.  Also, next time I would make the meatballs a bit smaller so there would be more of them.  All-in-all the dish was quite cook and the family really liked it.

I made it with the Ricotta cheese like other people and left out the water, but we used sourdough bread and it worked very well!! I am going to make this again very soon.

This was awesome!!!!! I thought from all the mixed reviews that it might not be good, but I was so glad I decided to make it!! Here's what I did on this recipe, I used a small loaf of day old french bread, I cut it into thin slices(about 1/4 in thick) put them in the bottom of the pan and then toasted them until they were nice and crispy, I then spread the cream cheese/mayo mixture right on (quite easily I might add) then the Mozz cheese(I also added some fresh shredded Parm cheese), then appx. 3 cups of sauce and meatballs then more on the Mozz/Parm mixture. IT WAS HEAVENLY!!! Thanks for this great recipe this will be in the reg menu!!

Great recipe, my family really enjoys it. I do use a slightly stale loaf of Italian bread to cut down on the soggyness, and roll many smaller sized meatballs to make sure the entire casserole is covered. My favorite sauce to use in it is Bertolli Vodka Sauce.

I love this recipe.  I'm so glad I found it because I wanted to make meatball hogies for dinner tonight, but was thinking about how messy that would be with my 8-year-old son, and then this recipe was in my e-mail box.  I made it exactly as written and everyone loved it.  Those of you who have been substituting ricotta really should try it as is--the spread is good enough to just eat plain on bread.  Actually I did make one change; I cut the bread into slices instead of cubes--much easier that way.  Thanks for the recipe!

Honestly can't figure out what all the fuss is about with this recipe.  My son liked this, my daughter only ate the meatballs.  I thought it was sickening -would rather have a meatball sandwich.

I've been using this recipe for years to make meatball sandwiches. I spread the cream cheese mixture on italian bread and top with meatballs and another slice of bread. It's a favorite when we have guests for dinner!

The mayo and cream cheese gave this a not-so-Italian taste.  I was the only member of my family that ate it, as my husband and children are picky.  If I make it again, I will cut the recipe in half (it made enough for an army) and go easy on the mayo and cream cheese.

THE FINISHED PRODUCT WAS GREAT EXCEPT THAT THE BREAD WAS SOGGY. NEXT TIME I MAKE I WILL DO THE BREAD SEPERATE, THAT COATING WAS VERY TASTY. THIS WAY BREAD STAYS CRISP AND DON'T HAVE TO EAT MUSHY BREAD.

The meatballs were fantastic.  I added egg because I was having trouble getting them to stick together.  The meatballs and sauce were delicious, but my husband and I didn't like the cheese mixture & the bread.  I didn't expect it to be so rich.  I know the casserole is the whole idea of this recipe, but I liked the meatballs so much, I think next time I'll ditch the bread/cheese/mayo mixture and just serve the meatballs & sauce like regular spaghetti with garlic bread.

We thought the meatballs were rather bland...and 1 lb of the Italian bread loaf was just too much. I used half of the loaf..cubed...and should have taken the advice of someone else and put the mayo mixture on it before I cubed it because it was very hard to spread it on the cubed bread. Might try it again sometime with a few changes.

If I could give this 0 stars, I would. I took two bites and gave the rest to my husband. The bread was soggy and tasted terrible.  The meatballs were too onion-y.  My husband, who eats anything, said, "I don't like it, but I'll eat it."

This is a very good and filling casserole.  I made the following alterations:  I sliced french bread into inch thick slices,placed that on the bottom of a casserole dish, filled in any "holes" with more of the bread so that there was a single layer of the bread, then spread the cream cheese mixture over that and put the meatball/sauce mixture, (I did not add any water to this dish.) The bottom was nicely baked, not soggy and the filling was done just right.  My husband LOVED this dish, I liked too but am not as big of a fan of "comfort food" as he is but if you are this is a fabulous dish for you. :)

ACK!  It was fate! I printed this recipe out last night for dinner today and happened to get it in an email for dish of the day today so I knew it was ment to be our dinner.  WORD TO THE WISE TOAST THE BREAD or dry it out real good, I did both.  I found that it did soften while baking but didn't come out soggy even though I did add about a half cup of water with the pasta sauce.  I spaced out putting the green onions in the meatballs but did put about a half teaspoon of good quality onion granuals in.  Also doubled the meatballs so there where more than plenty for everyone and also added egg as others suggested to help them hold together.  I also doubled the mayo/cream cheese mixture since my spreading abilities are lacking and was only able to get it over half the bread.  It was probably the least healthy dish I've made in a while but the mayo/cheese mix made it REALLY CREAMY AND YUMMY.

I didn't think my husband would like this but he wanted to eat the whole pan in one sitting! I followed advice from other reviewers and I used less cream cheese and mayo and I just had a thin layer of it. I made my meatballs from scratch and baked them in the oven first. This is a definite keeper for a special treat, low fat it is not!

This recipe was okay.  The mayonnaise made it too "bitter", maybe if we had eliminated that entirely it would have been better.  The meatballs themselves were very good...we'd incorporate them into a separate recipe but would not make this one again.

I loved this recipe so much I called all my neigbors telling them about it.  I even plan on making this at our next Bunko party!  My husband thought the mayo was a little overwhelming though.  So, the second time I made it - I eliminated the mayo on half of the casserole and we were both happy!!!  I've now made this several times and now eliminate the mayo all together and add ricotta cheese instead!!!  Much better!!!

This was very good!  My 5 year old daughter LOVED it.  I left out the 1 cup water, next time I might add about a third of a cup.  I used hogie rolls due to comments on needing harder bread.  Meatballs were great.  I use Prego spaghetti sauce.

Great, yummy recipe! Nice change - I will definently make it again! Taking reviews advice though I did not add the water and only 1/8 cup mayonnaise ... I was going to toast the bread, but forgot and it turned out great anyway.

I'd toast the bread next time, it came out a tad soggy.  Melted the cheese mixture in the microwave, made things alot easier.  Added extra cheese on top, not a great idea (difficult to cut, recipe rich enough already without extra cheese).  Used more meat than called for (large potluck crowd).  Make your meatballs a day ahead to speed up prep time.  Kicked it up Emeril-style with extra garlic and some hot sause.  Oh Yeah! Babe! GREAT RECIPE!!!

Made this for dinner last night and we loved it!!  The creem chese filling really makes the dish.  I used the prego spaghetti sauce that had mini-italian meatballs in it, so you got the large and small in the dish.  I'll be passing this recipe on to friends and family.

Was very flavorful.  Would prefer the meatballs to be smaller so there would be more of them

My family absolutely loved this!!  My husband said I need to make this next time company comes over!  I thought the blend of flavor was awesome!  I made like the recipe except I used ricotta instead of mayo and I need to put 1 egg into the meatballs to keep it together.  I doubled the recipe.

I'm rating this based upon how I made it after reading many reviews and working with what I had in the fridge, and it was AWESOME! My hubby stopped mid-meal, and said "yeah, that recipe's a keeper."  I scaled the recipe down for two because I had a bread bowl that needed to be used, so I hollowed it out as another cook suggested, and smeared the cream cheese-cottage cheese mixture together (I wasn't going for the mayo, and I didn't have ricotta) on the inside of the bowl and the underside of the "lid". I used pre-made meatballs, thawed and sliced, mixed into about 6 oz. of a four cheese tomato canned sauce, filled the bowl with that, and topped it with an Italian cheese blend. I baked it without the lid for about 20 minutes, then added the lid for another ten. I sliced it, and it kind of fell apart, but the taste more than made up for the less than restaurant quality presentation. It really was like a baked Italian meatball sub, and reminded the hubby of when we lived in MA, where grinders are everywhere. I'll be making this at least once every couple of weeks during the cold months. Thanks for submitting the recipe, and thanks to all the reviewers.

This recipe has been in my recipe box for over 8 years (a third of my life) and I FINALLY made it tonight!  I wish I'd tried it earlier because it is very, very tasty and my husband and I went crazy over it.  I used one of those long French baguettes from the grocery store bakery instead of Italian bread because we like it more and it is sturdier than Italian bread.  I also used frozen vegetarian meatballs because my husband wants to try eating vegetarian for a while, I left out the water (that would have made it too soggy for us, I can tell).  For the spaghetti sauce, I used my own pizza sauce recipe.  If anyone wants it, it's 3 cups plain tomato sauce (I use Hunt's because I like the flavor and it's already kind of salty, you may need to add salt if you use a different brand), 1 1/2 t oregano, 1 1/2 t basil, 3/4 t rosemary, 3/4 t garlic powder, 3/4 t onion powder, and 3/4 t pepper stirred together.  Very simple.  Prepared as I did, the bread is a little toasty on the bottom and the sauce moistens the bread but doesn't make it soggy.  Soggy bread gives me the willies (I don't like stuffing or bread pudding), but this was very good.  The flavor of the cream cheese and mayo is really good too, try it with the mayo before changing it because you can't specifically taste the mayo but the mixture tastes great.  It's creamy, tangy, and smooth and really adds something.  I'm sure ricotta would be good too, but the resulting flavor of the casserole would be changed a lot.

Good, but not to sure of the cream cheese layer maybe next time I will try ricotta instead.  I did cut my meatballs in half and layered them across entire casserole.  Will make again.

I tried this recipe tonight and this was the first time I ever made homemade meatballs. I must say, this was an extremely good meal. My husband and a friend of mine had it with me and they both thought it was really good. I will definitely make this again!

Love it, Love it, Love it! Although there is no spaghetti in this recipe, it doesn't need it. Absolutly will make this again, and again. so easy too, you can buy the meatballs already made to cut down on the time.

I love Italian bread dipped in sauce and I love meatballs, so this recipe is perfect for me.  My family loved it also.  I followed the recipe exactly  using crusty italian bread (about 12 oz instead of 16) and it wasn't at all soggy.  I think the cream cheese and mayo give it a delicious creaminess.  The only change I will make next time is to make one and a half times the amount of meatballs.  Thank you for posting!

Not bad, but not great. Had high hopes for this, I thought it was just OK. Hubby liked it more than I did, and said he would eat the leftovers. Omitted water as DH hates all things soggy, but it was still a little soggy even using toasted day-old Italian bread.

Good recipe, I did as others said and toasted the bread and coated all sides of it but it still came out mushy in the center, next time I might try putting the bread on top.

This was a very good recipe and one that I would make again.  I used lowfat cottage cheese instead of mayonnaise, and pre-made organic turkey meatballs instead of ground beef.

i think that this has great potential but you NEED to toast the bread first!  It was very soggy without toasting it first.  i will definitely make this again, and as another reviewer suggested possibly cut the bread into thick slices on the bottom of the dish instead of cubing it.  The flavor of the sauce and cheese topping was delish!

This was ok I stayed pretty true to the recipe except I made my own meatballs.  Next time I would use half of the cream cheese and same amount of mayo.  I think I would toast the bread as well.  Otherwise it was very good.

My kids loved it...I thought it wasn't bad...my husband couldn't stand it! So there you have it!!  I did toast the bread first before cutting up.  I didn't use mayo, instead i used half ricotta/cream cheese mixture with an egg in it!  I added lots of cheese to it...so it tasted good, just not quite what i expected.  My husband said he'd rather have the sandwich version...men, i tell ya!  lol

Such a fun change and good way to use up some homemade leftover spaghetti sauce and meatballs. After reading reviews I too used sliced toasted french bread and subbed ricotta for the mayo. Loved the cheese filling. I added some garlic powder, a little fresh lemon juice and grill seasoning with the Italian herbs. Did not use the water, but I did top with some provolone slices along with the grated mozzerella. Really good, but rich.

OMG!!! Melt in your mouth delicious! I took other suggestions and toasted the bread and omitted the water but put in extra sauce. My boyfriend and I could eat this over and over. This is my favorite recipe and I will make over and over. Thanks so much!

This is very good as long as you make these adjustments:

Toast the bread in the oven beforehand
Substitute ricotta for mayo
Don't use water

My husband and I didn't care for this or, should I say, the cream cheese mixture.  It was way to rich.  It did act nicely as a sealer to keep the bread dry though but I think I might've preferred to have soggy bread without the cream cheese.  I saved the meatballs, mozz. cheese and sauce to use with some noodles.  Sorry.

This recipe is great! I have made this recipe numerous times and find that the crust is firmer when I use french sandwich rolls (approx 3-4 6" rolls).  I think the extra crust from the rolls is the key to a great crust.  Other than that, I follow the recipe to a T.

How unusual! I only could fit a half a loaf of bread in my dish, which I lightly toasted. Although I didn't use the water, it came out a tad soggy, which Kind of worked. The mayo/cream cheese mix is very rich... I like it, but I can see how someone might find it a bit much. The meatballs, however, are a big hit. Thanks for this one!

I've made this lots of times, and it usually is a hit.  It's a very heavy meal but tastes just like a meatball sandwich.  In my experience a lot of men like this.  I will say that my husband and I liked it a lot and he always wanted me to make it earlier in our marriage, but now it's a bit much for us.  I only make it maybe once a year now (and we aren't old - he turns 30 this month).

GREAT! I didn't have soggy bread, but mine was a day old as another said. We all just loved it and have added it to our regular menu. I've been out of marinara a time or two since I always make my own and those times subed 1 can tomato paste and 1 can pizza sauce and it still turned out great!

I went into this expecting that it may not be great, as it seemed so many people complained about the texture of the bread not being good, and the mayo/cream cheese mixture not tasting good and being too rich.  However once I ate it I was pleasantly suprised.  It is so delicious and flavorful, and not too rich.  My husband loved it as well, and he's a tough one to please.  It is a bit rich, similiar to eating lasagna, but great for when you're craving some good comfort food.  I only did two things different from the recipe.  One was to toast the bread cubes first as others had suggested.  The consistency of the bread was just fine in the end, so I'm not sure if this was why.  The other was I used store bought frozen meatballs that I knew were good, and indeed they came out great in the casserole.  I will definitely be making this again, and telling my fellow cooks about it as well!

This recipe was very tasty!  I only had whole wheat bread on hand so that's what I used, and it still tasted good.  My husband loved it, and scarfed down the leftovers for lunch for a couple daySS

WOW!!!I loved this! The only thing I didd different was not using water. Next time I probably will use water, but cut it by half. This was very tasty! Husband and I really liked it, so did one of my boys. The rest of the kids weren't crazy about it, but they've been picky lately. Their opinion doesn't count with this recipe (:

I made this recipe with the cream cheese/mayo combination because I wanted to use ingredients that I always have on hand.  The combination was so rich that I really didn't enjoy it.  In fact, we had the whole pan leftover.  If I make it again I will definitely try the ricotta mixture and double the amount of meatballs since my family loves meat.  For us, this really wasn't that great.

I'm giving this four stars because its delicous, but not my favourite main. The first time i made this i made it with store bought meatballs and realised my mistake when i tasted it. This is MUCH better with the meatballs included in the recipe, or with a recipe of your own. (i added some tomato and soy sauces and much more parmesan for flavour) After my first attempt I realised there needed to more of the cream cheese mix so i doubled that. The easiest way to keep it on the bread for me was to put all my bread cubes in the bottom of my dish and use a good spatula to spread it over all of them at once (This will only work when you make double to cream cheese). After these changes it tasted great!

This dish was absolutely amazing.  I did change a couple of things up,however. I took the advice of another reviewer and used one extra cup of sauce instead of using the water.  Also, instead of spreading the mayo/cream cheese mixture over the piece of bread, I mixed the mixture together in a large bowl, then tossed the bread pieces around until they were covered.  Once I dumped the covered bread back into the casserole dish, I used the same big bowl to mix the meatballs and the sauce together.  It dirtied less dishes and saved me some trouble.  Both my husband and son couldn't get enough of it and can't wait for the leftovers!

first of all, iused ground turkey instead of beef for the meatballs.  i also used more onion (white onion).. more bread crumbs, and three egggs.  i also added a extra seasoning-- parsely, oregano, crushed red pepper, and dry basil.  i just kept adding breadcrumbs, parm cheese and egg until it was the consistency that i liked.  my boyfriend went nuts over the meatballs and was eating them stright off the pan when they came out of the oven!!!  i used them in the casserole the next day and we were both really dissapointed with the casserole.  the taste of cream cheese was sooo overpowering we ended up giving the whole thing to the dog!  i defintalty will hang on to the meatball recipe but never make the casserole again. yuck

This was a major hit with my family.  Because so many reviewers had soggy bread complaints I did toast the bread before adding the spread and I omitted the water.  Also, I used ground turkey (this weekend was "Ice Storm 2007" and Walmart was completely out of every type of ground beef).  Regardless, this made an amazingly delicious and simple meal.

Excellent recipe.  My wife really enjoyed this one.  Like most posters, we were concerned with the mayo and cream cheese mixture, but we went with it.  It actually tastes great.  I added a little more garlic to the recipe.  I also noticed that the meatball mixture needs some salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!  I thought the cream cheese/mayo mixture might be a little strong but the smell from the oven was almost too much to wait for!!  My family loved this and we were tempted to eat it all but managed to save some for leftovers -
absolutely delicious and fairly easy.  I didn't have any Italian bread as we live in a small town, but I used some sandwich rolls and it tasted great!

We loved this recipe.  Instead of 1 pound ground beef, I used 1/2 pound beef and 1/2 pound sausage.  I used only 1/2 cup water as others had suggested. I found it easy with my Pampered Chef Easy Accent Decorator to spead the cream cheese mixture over the bread.  This recipe was also very good as left overs the next day.  I have made this for several friends who had just had babies and their families seemed to love it as well.

My husband really enjoyed this. I omitted the water as I like a thick sauce. There ended up being not quite enough sauce so next time I would double the sauce. Great way of serving meatballs without the need for noodles or pasta.

This was wonderful, because I made some changes.  I didn't shape the meatballs, I just browned the ground beef with the breadcrumbs, onion, and Parmesan.  I added enough tomato sauce to my liking and spread the ground beef on the bottom of the baking sheet.  I topped with the cream cheese/mayo mixture (which is really a lot tastier than it sounds).  Then I placed crusty baguette slices over the top and sprinkled with mozzarella.  It is now in my regular rotation (meaning we have it once every couple of months).

That was really good.  I found an artisan bread in the grocery story with cloves of garlic in the bread, that really this recipe good.  I think next time I do the recipe though, I will cut back some of the mayo, cream cheese mixture and spice up the meatballs a bit.  They seemed a little boring for a guy that likes spicy meatballs.

I used almost the same ingredients in this recipe, just prepared them a little differently.  I simmered the meatballs in the spaghetti sauce (sans water) for 45 minutes, till they were done and the sauce was very thick.  I used hoagie buns instead of bread to make individual sandwiches.  The cream cheese spread was awesome, gave it great flavor!

This recipe is absolutely, hands down, my son's favorite!  I modified it by using hogie buns instead of french loaf.  It is a lot quicker if you find some good frozen meatballs, which I have done and this recipe is still great.  We love the cream cheese parmesian mixture and it is truly what makes this stand out.  I am telling you, the neighborhood kids come running and my son greedily hoards any leftovers. (If he leaves any, lol)
*UPDATE* 9/19/2015 - I originally wrote this review in 2006 - 9 years ago - seems like yesterday but I will tell you this is still one of my childrens' favorite recipes. I have tweaked it over the years to make it just how we like it! Thank you to the person who originally shared this.  Now that my son is grown, he wants me to compile a family recipe book which includes this recipe so that he can pass it down to his children when he has them! If you are considering trying this - don't hesitate! Read the reviews and think about your family's tastes and tweak it. You will not be sorry!

My DH and I made this for a potluck and it was "just ok".  We took the advice of other reviewers and toasted the bread and then spread the cream cheese mixture on it before cubing; we also reduced the amount of mayo to 1/4 cup and omitted the water altogether.  Apart from this, we followed the recipe exactly and in the end we found that there was too much cream cheese but the other flavours were good.  I might try to make this again, but would add more garlic, some parmesan cheese and less cream cheese mixture.

I've made this recipe a couple of times, just cam accross it again, and realized that I have never written a review. We liked this, however, it was a little labour intence, and a bit rich. Not that that always a bad thing. It's a nice hearty meal if you've got the afternoon off to prepare it. Like I said, I've made it a couple times, so obviously it's a hit in our house!

Good taste....but bread was way too soggy.  After reading other reviews next time I will omit the water and put bread under broiler first.  I will try again....we liked the taste.  Thanks Wanda =-)

This was pretty good... I used steak sandwich bread, cut into cubes, and put it under the broiler for a few minutes.  Plus I omitted the water, so I did not have a soggy bread problem that other reviewers did.  Though I did think the creamcheese/mayo mixture was a little strong, but doubling the meatballs would cut down on that problem, so I *definitely* recommend doubling the meatballs.  It was a bit complicated to put together, and I mostly say that only because we no longer have a dishwasher, so I had a million dishes to clean after it was all done.  But it was a good recipe; will add to the rotation, but will space it out to cut down on my dishwashing time ;-)

this recipe was a hit in my  house full of 5 boys teenagers who are very picky and very hungry. I did make a little change I put the cream cheese and mayo mixture in a zip lock baggie and cut one small corner off the bag and I squeezed the mixture over the bread cubes, then spread with a spatula it worked fantastic.  I had to make two pans it was so good!!!!  Its a keeper in my recipe file!!!!

OMIT THE WATER and it is a 5 star recipe!  I followed everything else, using a fresh Italian loaf of bread.  Everyone loved it...I even gave a meatball or two to the dogs and they were happy!!

I read the reviews that complained about the soggy bread, so I thought I'd try to prevent that by using the garlic bagel chips I had picked up at the supermarket that morning in place of the french bread. Unfortunately even the bagel chips (which were hard as rocks to begin with) got soggy.  The sauce and cheese filling was good though.  I used precooked meatballs that I already knew were tasty, and we ended up just scooping out the filling and putting it on grinder rolls.  I also cut back on the mayo and replaced it with sour cream, and I added cottage cheese too since I didnt' have 2 cups of mozzarella.  It was yummy.  I also forgot all about the water I was supposed to add to the sauce.  That may have been a good thing though since it was already soggy.   I might make the filling portion again, mashing the meatballs up a little to make them easier to pile on a grinder.  Thanks!

This recipe is good, but needs slight tweaking.    After reading all the reviews, I only changed a few things.   I doubled the meatball recipe (the meatball/pan size ratio turned out to be flawless), substituted the green onion for 1 small yellow onion, used bottled pasta sauce (but still added the garlic and water that was called for), and used a package of (crisply toasted) Texas Toast cut into cubes instead of bread.    The taste was fantastic.   The only problem wasâ€¦.soggy bread.     Next time Iâ€™ll try Texas Toast without cutting it into cubes and fill any small holes between slices with hard bread and (maybe) try omitting the water.

It was OK. My fiance liked it, but suggested using ricotta cheese instead of the cream cheese spread. Next time I will have to try that. I will also toast the bread and cook the bread cheese mixture for a bit before adding meatballs and sauce.

This recipe was great!  The key to keeping the bread from getting soggy is to make sure the cubed pieces of bread are tightly put into the pan with no room for movement.  Then toast the bread in the dish.  I used less mayo about 2 Tablespoons and added a clove of minced garlic.  I only used enough of the mixture to put a thin layer over top the bread.  And my husband does not like cream cheese or mayo so I did not tell him that was in it and he didn't even noticed.  He loved it.  I also omitted the water.  This turned out great.  I gave it a 4 stars because it is time consuming.  But good!

Yummy, but VERY rich. A little went a long way. I would 1/2 the cream cheese, and add cottage or ricotta cheese.  I toasted the bread as suggested, and it turned out crunchy/gooey.  I would also double the meatballs but otherwise it was very good..3 out of our 5 liked it.  I would make it again, but not for a while.

The whole family loved this recipe.  I omitted the water, and I cut the bread and put it under the broiler for a minute and then spread the cream cheese mixture on, cut the bread into cubes and then layered it on the bottom.  Worked great.

This was very easy to make and had a good taste.  I have made it twice and I would recommend omitting the water and after you have the bread in the bottom, pop it on the oven to brown the bread a little to stop it from becoming soggy after you add the sauce.

This recipe is excellent!I have made it twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and ended up with soggy bread. The second time, I made some modifications, and the bread was very crisp, making the whole dish spectacular! I used a 2 quart oval casserole dish (Pyrex), instead of the 9 by 13 inch pan. For the bread, I used a loaf of crusty french bread, and merely ripped off pieces from it until the bottom of the pan was covered. The bread should be packed quite tightly on the bottom. Next, I mixed the mayo and cream cheese with the spices, and spread it over top the bread. Because the bread was packed so tightly in the bottom, it was quite easy to spread evenly. This layer can be a bit thick, because it will protect the bread from becoming soggy with the sauce. After this, just follow the recipe exactly, and you should come out with a meatball casserole that has a crispy bread bottom!

This was easy to prepare and that was nice, but it was missing something and I can't put my finger on it.  But thank you for sharing this with all of us Holly.  I will work with it and see if I can pinpoint what I feel it lacked.

I made this for a informal dinner and it turned out great.  Everyone loved it!  I did follow other reviewers' suggestions: Omit the water, double the meatball portion, slice the bread-do not cube (this makes spreading the cream cheese mixture much easier) and reduce the mayo to 1/4 cup.  I also let my cream cheese soften for at least two hours on the counter before mixing (w/electric mixer) in the mayo.  It spread VERY easily with a spatula.  Would highly recommend.

In a word: soggy.  I even toasted the bread before hand and still had the soggy bottom blues.  Cheese mayo mixture was weird and the whole recipe seemed to be missing something.

This was not a hit with my family.  The bread was mushy.  Maybe I did something wrong.  I did like the meatballs and plan on making the meatballs again for "real" meatball sandwiches!

Can't beat those traditional flavors all mixing together beautifully, however, the bread got a bit soggy on me and the carb and caloric content is quite high.  This is a "once a year" kind of recipe for me.

A good recipe but I find making meatball sandwiches much easier. I used leftover Kaiser rolls instead of the Italian loaf. I would make this again, only if I wanted a meatball sandwich but did not have the torpedo rolls on hand.

Admittedly I used frozen meatballs instead of making my own (which usually come out looking more like meat blobs), but I think this recipe is a TOTAL keeper.  Easy, cheesy, hearty and chock full of flavor.  Would like to add that not everyone subscribes to cooking magazines and I thank Holly for submitting it to allrecipes.

Considering how easy it was to make, I'd say it was pretty good.  It reminded us all of LaSagna.
I think next time I would use toasted french bread as another reviewer suggested.

Definitely had a soggy bread problem with this one.  I didn't even add the water to the sauce.  I let the bread dry somewhat before I used it in the casserole, but that wasn't enough.  Maybe toasting would work.  Flavor was good, though.  Didn't think it warmed over well--bread just got soggier.

We loved the meatballs, but the bread I used was too soft so the casserole ended up really soggy.  Would try again with a harder bread.

I was not crazy about this recipe.  It looked lovely coming out of the oven but it did not taste too great.  I think it's much easier and tastier to just make meatball sandwiches.  Suprisingly my kids loved it and cleaned their plates.  The bread was just tooo soggy and it ended up being a very dry sauce.  Not what I was hoping for.

It thought this recipe was only okay.  The cream cheese mixture, something I thought I would love, was too overwhelming, plus I cut the may from 1/2 cup to 1/3 cup.  My husband only liked the meatballs.  My brother-in-law thought it was good, but he also orders mayo on his meatball subs.  I won't be making this again.

My husband, who rarely gets excited about dinner, hasn't stopped talking about this recipe! He had three heaping helpings.  He says that the person who thought up this recipe should open a restaraunt just for this. He even stopped playing on the computer just to savor every bite.  Actually, although his reaction was the funniest we all enjoyed it.  Thanks.

This was sooooo good.  It might sound a little odd, but is fabulous!  One tip-the cream cheese/mayo mixture is a little thick, so I added 1/2 cup of the water to it, which made it MUCH easier to spread over the bread and then added the other 1/2 cup to the sauce like the recipe said.

I made this for me and my husband and we really liked it.  I bought frozen meatballs, spread the cheese mixture on the bread and then cut it into cubes to save time.  I also didn't use water.  I cut the recipe in half and I will probably try the ricotta next time as it is pretty rich!  But, all in all we loved it, and it's quick and easy to make!

Well---I've got to say that after reading a lot of the reviews, concerning "toasting" the bread first, I didn't know if I should tweak the recipe by toasting, or just make it as is.  I opted for making it as is.  I LOVED it.  The bread was moist, and had a dumplinglike texture.  This recipe made some very happy tummies tonight.  If I were to change anything at all, it might be only to do my favorite meatball recipe.  Other than that, I think this recipe is perfect.
Cheers all,
Jeff

THIS WAS GOOD. MY HUSBAND LOVED IT. NEXT TIME , I'LL TOAST THE BREAD FIRST.  ALSO, IT'S EASIER TO SLICE THE BREAD RATHER THAN CUBE IT.

This recipe was very yummy but it took a lot of time to prepare and was very messy. It was also quite expensive to make.

This dish was very good, although I found that spreading the cream cheese mixture over the bread was a bit challenging.  I made the meatballs the day before, and that cut down on some of the prep time.....very good!!!

We enjoyed this casserole and I will make it again. However, I made several changes to the recipe.  I omitted mayo and used sour cream instead.  I added diced green bell pepper and red pepper flakes.  I also omitted the water.  This was delicious served with a fresh salad.

Like most everyone else I omitted the mayo and went with ricotta. I was well received and will definitely do again.  Probably add green and banana pepper next time.

I omit the water and brown the bread cubes (or slices of bread.)  I've also used precooked frozen Italian meatballs.  My kids like it on occasion.  I love it but it's too fattening for me!

So easy to make, everyone loved it. and it holds up just fine as leftovers. The family enjoyed some a couple days later again.  
My shortcut: I used frozen meatballs and loaf of pre-spread garlic bread to save time.   Thank you for sharing.

We did not enjoy this casserole.  The bread was way too soggy on the bottom.  Both my son and husband love meatball sandwiches and this was not even close. I will definitely not make this again.

Great recipe but I had to make some changes to make it healthier.  I used pre made turkey meatballs, whole wheat baguette and light cream cheese.  I also used Asiago and Romano cheese instead of mozzarella. No water necessary.  My kids loved it!

I used this as a 'suggestion,' I toasted the bread as others suggested.  And I used my own meatball recipe because I know that we all like it.  Also I did not use either cream cheese or mayo as I do not use them in a meatball sandwich.  I increased the shredded cheese to compensate.  Make a nice way to take meatball "sandwiches" to a covered-dish, or to the office, somewhere that the real sandwiches would be too messy.

This is so good. I did not add water to the sauce and did not cube my bread. I just tore it up in pieces and placed them in the pan. I loved the mayo and cream cheese combo.

I read the reviews before I made this; I'm so glad I did, I made the changes other reviewers recommended and it was SO TASTY! I did less mayo, no water, and larger pieces of bread. Naturally the bread is going to soak up the sauce- larger pieces don't get soaked all the way through, preventing the whole thing from being soggy. I'm not a huge fan of meatballs so I thought those were only ok, but my family thought they were great so I will defer to them on the meatballs. Definitely a keeper!

I did it bread bowl style but next time I will do it the casserole way like the origina recipe says.  No added water.  And since some people said to use ricotta instead of mayo I combined the two ingredients.  It was very yummy but doing it bread bowl style ended up being too much bread and not enough meat.  It tasted very good though!

Ok casserole. Bread was soggy even though I pre-toasted a bit in oven before assembling in casserole. A lot of the final taste is reflected in the brand spaghetti sauce used or if you use home made sauce, which would be the best choice. Don't like the addition of mayonnaise, the flavor just doesn't work with this casserole. Will make true meatball sandwiches in future.

This dish is a bit heavy for me, but my giant of a son can't get enough of it. I like fast and easy, and this dish has approx. 3 major steps to it and is not a dish that you want to make if you're in a hurry. Non the less, it still remains in my file as a favorite... especially for his birthday.

I followed the advice of many previous reviewers and toasted the bread and left out the water, just used tomato sauce.  We really liked this one and it makes a ton, so we had lots of leftovers.

This was really good!  My family thoroughly enjoyed it!  I did take the advice of some of the previous posters and used ricotta cheese instead of the mayo.  I would make this again.

I was NOT  going to cut that loaf of bread into cubes, what a waste of time, so I didn't.  I just layed the slices down in the pan and then spread the cream cheease mixture on it.  I made my own spaghetti sauce, since thats what I would use if I was making hot meatball sandwiches, anyways.  The rest of the steps, I followed and it was great!

This was very tasty but very rich - so you couldn't eat a large serving it was so filling and heavy!  I followed the reviews and baked my bread before hand.  Hubby said that he loved the meatball and sauce but would have just preferred the bread baked separately. I felt there was a little too much Italian Seasoning for our taste so next time I will cut that in half.  Other than that, I thought it was a great recipe that we will just make some variations to for our family.  Thanks for sharing!

Wow, not so good.  It is edible, but I'm the only one who would eat it.  It was rather mushy. Probably should have toasted the bread as some suggested....??

I went ahead and made this heart attack waiting to happen and it was actually pretty good. Not super duper extra fantabulous but it was definitely good--my family really got a kick out of it and ate it all up.  I didn't cut up the bread into cubes--I sliced it so it would fit the bottom of the pan instead.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe!! I first found this in a magazine and it calls for sliced italian bread (not cubed) which makes it a lot easier to spread the cream cheese / mayo onto it.  I also use ground turkey instead of beef for the meatballs and you can't even tell the difference.  I always fill all the nooks and cranies with pieces of italian bread so that the spaghetti sauce doesn't seap through to the bread and make it soggy.  Also, I don't add the water as it makes it a bit too runny.

This was yummy.  I used ricotta instead of mayo and did not add any extra water.  We sliced the bread and just topped each slice with the sauce and meatballs.  It was really good!

My husband and I loved this recipe and I was able to make it ahead of time and then have him throw it in the oven at the last minute.  I did add an egg to the meatballs to make it hold together better, but it was wonderful.

An okay recipe and you MUST like Italian meatball sandwiches.  Probably best for teenagers.  The recipe says it serves 5 -it's probably closer to 10 servings. I agree with others that there is no way you can fit 16 oz. of bread cubes in a single layer of a 9 x 13" pan.  Be sure to toast the bread cubes so that they don't get soggy.  If I make it again, I will try it with ricotta instead of the cream cheese-mayo mixture.  As others suggested, I did not add water - just added a bit more spaghetti sauce.

Loved it.  I halved the recipe which worked great but it needed a few more meat balls.  So probably use more meat and/or make the meatballs smaller.

A Keeper! Like some others I doubled the cream cheese mixure-omitted the water-used store bought italian style meatballs. Couldn't fit a whole loaf of single layered bread so I don't know how anyone else did but having it a day or 2 old made for no sogginess. The 2 Italian men in my family raved! Thanks.

VERY rich! I did everything as stated. It did remind me of lasagna, but it is just TOO rich for this kind of dish. Mayo with the cream cheese kind of killed it. Reduce this mixture and it might be better. It's great for a side dish though. Oh...and get 2-2.5 lbs. of ground beef for this. The 1 lb. beef won't cover the 9x13 dish. My husband on the other hand loves it.

This casserole is great!  I do toast the bread before assembling the casserole (To help with the soggy bread problem that some others have complained about.) It does still get a little soggy, but I don't mind it too much.  Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I took some of the previous reviewers'advice and used less cream cheese and mayo. I also did not use water--just about 2.5 cups of spaghetti sauce. I also used slightly stale bread.  DELICIOUS!  I will make this again.

I thought this recipe was fantastic!!!!  I altered the recipe a bit, and used a few ideas from other people's notes.  I cut the cream cheese in half, and reduced the amount of mayo to 1/3 cup.  I omitted the water completely, and added freshly grated Parmesan cheese to the mozzerella cheese.  It was great!!!

My husband went back for thirds and my 2 yr old ate two helpings! Based on other reviews, I used 1/4 cup of mayo, and it turned out fine. I didn't have four cups of pasta sauce, but the three cups of sauce and one cup of water worked out great. I sliced the bread, but should have cut the slices in half to make it a little easier to eat. I didn't have green onions, but used minced onions and the meatballs were yummy! This is a keeper!

I found this same recipe in a Taste of Home magazine a while back, only that one called for slicing the bread, not cubing it. I think cubing the bread would be better. Everything was great about the recipe except I didn't think there was any need for a cup of water, and I would probably cut back a bit on the mayo/cream cheese mixture next time. This is not a dish for those counting calories!

I didn't like this very much. The bread and spread part was gross IMO. The meatball and sauce combo was decent. Make a real meatball sandwich instead!

This tasted just like lasagna, and was just as much work.  I didn't think it was good enough to merit all the time it took to make this recipe.

A good recipe.  My family liked it overall.  It could be a little less cheesy.  The meatballs were very good.

Actually about 3.5 stars.  Pretty good I made just one change and that was using provolone cheese in place of the mozzarella (I had provolone and not mozzarella)  thanks for the suggestion qualitycookdotcom!  The casserole was pretty good. I think next time I will use half the amount of cream chese mixed with some ricotta to cut down some of the tang from the cream cheese.  I will probably add some mushrooms to the sauce as well.  But overall a pretty good dish that I will try again with some revisions.

I thought this recipe was pretty yummy!  I used some meatballs I had already prepared that were frozen in my freezer, spread the cream cheese mixture (w/a lil less mayo...eyeballed it) on the bread BEFORE cubing/quartering it, and did NOT add any water at all...just more sauce.  The bread was a just WEE bit soggy, but I think maybe it's supposed to be JUST A LITTLE?!?!  It was stil very yummy!  Great comfort food for a cold, winter night like tonight :)  Will add to file and make again!  Thank you!

This tasted like a really good meatball pizza.  Next time, I will use less of the cream cheese mixture!  A definite keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I are missionaries in Haiti. Each Friday night, we get together with the other missionaries on our compound and have a big meal together. I fixed this for one of those meals, and it was a big hit! Thanks for the great recipe!

Great alternative to the Plain-Jane meatball! I make my own meatballs and freeze them, so when I am ready to make this recipe, I just take my meatballs out the day before-its easy!  I've made this almost every week-yes, its that good!!!  Especially when friends come over.  The kids go crazy over it and I am always sending them home with leftovers!

This was really good! The only things I changed were: did not cube bread, halved it; toasted it in the oven with butter/garlic salt, slathered it with the mayo/cream cheese mix and then cut it into 2-3" strips. I used Classico Burgandy Marinara, no water. It is a bit soggy, but no soggier than most meatball sandwiches.

very good.. expensive to make.. I followed the suggestions of the others here.  I took this for an Italian themed party.. it was all gone.. people raved over this!  Very rich in taste.  This is not something you would probably want to cook for an everyday occasion - it did take a long time to cook - b/c of the meatballs.  I will make it again next year.

This was yummy, although, I hate to say it, I did change it a little.  I didn't have french bread so I used sour dough, and might try it again since we like sour dough.  I also didn't use the onion since I don't like onion in my meatballs.  I found the meatballs really yummy and will probably make them again whenever I make meatballs.  The one thing I didn't like was the soggy bread--I'll try toasting it if I make it again.  Also, I had problems spreading the cream cheese mixture on the cubes--there has to be another way!  I may try this: toasting bread, spreading each slice with cream cheese, then layering slices in dish, NOT cutting into cubes.

This was pretty good.  I toasted the bread first and it still came out soggy.  The flavor made up for that though.  I used premade frozen meatballs because I am always in a hurry!  Next time I will toast both sides of the bread first and put the cream cheese mixture on before cutting up the bread.  That took way too long.

I would not try this one again. Although the meatballs were great, the mayo mixture was very overkill and the bread was very soggy. My husband and I are not picky eaters at all, and this one was far less than successful in my home. Hopefully if you try this one, you will have better luck than I did!

I made this exactly as recommended except I didn't add the water to the sauce because so many reviewers said not to.  This dish just wasn't anything special and I think just the regular sandwich would have been better.  Sorry!

This was AWESOME!!! I toasted the bread first, and omitted the water, & the bread wasn't soggy at all!!! I also added a clove of garlic(minced) to the cream cheese mixture. It was a bit too much garlic, but still really good. (& I LOVE garlic, I usually can't get enough!!!)I've already shared this recipe w/ family members who love it too! Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This is wonderful and so easy! I made it for a potluck recently and it went over very well!  I followed other reviewers lead and made the following changes: I used Texas toast (frozen, so I toasted it first, spread on the cream cheese mixture and then cut the slices into cubes), used thawed pre-made meatballs and omitted the water altogether. It was perfect! The bread didn't become too soggy and it really tasted liked you were eating a meatball sub! We will definitely make this again!

SSOOOOOO  GOOD!!  The recipe calls for a single layer, meaning don't stack cubes over cubes of bread.  I used half a loaf of Chicago Italian, it came from the bakery at my grocery store.  It has a crispy crust.  I thought this was amazing and will make it for sure again!

The meatballs were amazing, but there was too much cream cheese/mayo mixture.  Plus, use only a thin layer of bread on the bottom of the pan.  If you use the entire 1 lb. loaf it becomes mushy.  I will revise this recipe and try again!

This was not good.  As other users said, the bread turns to mush and it felt like I was eating meatball slop.  Also, a full block of cream cheese was TOO much.

I toasted the bread and cut out the water in an effort to avoid the soggy bread, and it was still pure mush when I took it out of the oven. We ended up toasting more Italian bread and scooping the meatballs/sauce/cheese off the top and eating it on the extra bread. That's the only reason it gets 2 stars. Next time I'll just make sauce and meatballs in the crock pot and serve on toasted Italian bread with the cheese. MUCH simpler and no soggy bread.

Ok, I followed the recommendations, left out the water and toasted the bread, and I thought the bread was too crunchy. (I'm not a cruton on my salad gal) Just goes to show, different tastes for different folks!  I ate leftovers for breakfast and the bread was softer - much better!  Next time I will not toast the bread, or maybe add wine to the sauce to soften things up.  Thanks for sharing!!!!

This was good!  My Husband enjoyed it and had seconds.  After reading the reviews, I did not add the water and slightly toasted the bread, it did not come out soggy at all!  I made it into two separate smaller dishes and froze the other one.  Will make again!

We loved this- we didn't care for the soggy bread though- I read what another person said and I think omitting the water and maybe toasting the bread a bit would help. But it was an awesome recipe. My daughter hates meat- she loved this anyway!

...I did over cook the meatballs a bit as I forgot to set the timer but It was the overall taste or lack of taste that was the problem. I forgot to add an egg to the meatball mixture which wasn't called for in the recipe but obviously should have been. Even with good meatballs I think this is just to much work for what is essentially just a meatball sandwich with ALOT of unneeded extra FAT from the cream cheese and mayonnaise. that part tasted good of course but was just too rich after a few bites and I wouldn't miss it in a good meatball wedge. I've never heard of those ingredients being added in one anyway.

I loved this recipe!  When in a hurry, I have used store bought meatballs.  But, obviously homemade are best.
It is a filling meal all by itself!

I halved this recipe and it turned out fine.  I substituted yellow onion for green onions.  I also took others advice and toasted the bread (used plain old white bread) and then tossed it with the cream cheese mixture and really packed it down into an 8x8 pan.  Also omitted the water.  No soggy bottom for me!  Husband loved it and he even ate the leftovers!

I cheated and used frozen meatballs from the grocery store. The kids didn't like the cream cheese, although I thought it added a nice flavor.

My casserole was just perfect.  I cut back on the cream cheese and mayo, omitted the water, made my own meatballs, used Texas garlic toast, toasted first and everything came out perfect. Great reheated. Will make this again.  Husband loved it!

This didn't turn out so great for me. sliced the bread as per other reviews, but didn't even need 1/2 the loaf of a 1 lb bag of bread - ommitted the water, cut back on the mayo and cream cheese and added 1 egg, brown sugar and worteschire sauce to the meat balls.  My electricity went out in the middle of baking so it did finish using lesser heat than needed. Flavor was good but bread was extremely soggy (not sure if this is operator error or partially because of the lower cooking temperature) The meatballs were excellent, I would definitley advise to toast the bread first as others have suggested.

I used Texas Toast Garlic Bread. I put it under the broiler and got it real crispy and still it turned out wet and mushy. I also cut the mayo down to half. Aside from the mushy bread it really had a great taste. I was thinking of trying this again sometime but putting the toasted bread on the top instead of under all that sauce?? It tastes so good that I am not going to give up on it, I'll think of something...

I thought this was great. I questioned the cream cheese like some other reviewers, but it would have been lacking without it. My 5 and 7 year old sons loved it, though my husband thought it was just "Ok.". But, he's Australian and has never even had a meatball sub! He also knows jack about American comfort food and this is definately in that cetegory for me. Thumbs up, Holly, thanks!

We had plenty of leftovers because this makes a lot!  I used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese for less fat and used frozen meatballs for easier preparation.  It's slightly time consuming spreading the cheese/mayo mixture on the bread cubes.  Since the casserole has a distinct lasagna taste, maybe ricotta or cottage cheese could be used instead.  Would save some fat and calories, at least!  I also eliminated the 1 c. of water and mine wasn't soggy at all.

We loved this!  I did change it a little...instead of using cubed bread, I used refridgerated pizza crust dough and baked that according to the package.  I also omitted the water.  My husband, sister, and brother-in-law, plus me, really enjoyed this dish.

We did not like this recipe at all. The meatballs were good...but everything else looked like a big pile of mush. Pretty much was meatballs and soggy bread soaked in a tomato sauce. With a bit of seasoning.

I looked at the other reviews and found many complaints about soggy bread. So, before I put the casserol together, I toasted the cubed bread in the oven, stirring every few minutes.  I also put a little more bread in than the recipee called for to soak up some of the moisture.  Oh, I also omitted the water.

Very good. I wondered where the cream cheese fit into a Italian meatball sub, and when I tasted it It fit in perfectly . Not to soggy here,although I did not see a use for the water. Next time I will make a double batch, so it will last longer.

I thought it was very good and not nearly as rich as others said it was. I did brown my bread cubes whole and then spread the seasoning on before cutting into chunks. Will definately make again.

I also had a hard time fitting a pound of bread in the pan. I did not toast the bread and used 3/4 cup water since I was using less bread, but the bread was still soggy. Actually, it wasn't bad that way. I'd like to try it toasted next time just to compare. The cream cheese/mayo IS rich, don't use the whole amount if you don't like rich. It took a long time to make (longer than 30 mins!) but was worth the trouble. A keeper; served with a salad.

This was super!!! My husband loved it. It's very rich and filling. There was way too much left over, and it wasn't as yummy reheated. Any suggestions?

The receipe has potential. I would definately toast the bread next time. The cream cheese/mayo was too strong. I would opt for ricotta cheese. It grossed out my 7 year old. Looks like my husband will be eating alot of leftovers!

The recipe had great flavor...the only thing I would change would be to leave the bread out on the counter overnight...it got really soggy after soaking up all the ing.

WOW! Mouth watering. I did toast the bread cubes, and I didn't have any italian seasoning, so I used a packet of italian dressing mix, but this was delicious! Five stars!!

My family really liked this.  It made a large amnt. and I didn't have any leftovers!  I didn't toast the bread and mine came out fine, not at all soggy.  However, next time I might try it just to see it tastes better that way.  Thanks for the great recipie!

This was a very interesting and tasty dish. I think I put too much of the cream cheese mixture on my bread because the tart taste was a little strong. Overall, it was an excellent dish that I will prepare often.

I thought this was fabulous! It truly tasted just like a meatball sandwich. Next time I would probably toast the bread like recommended and use less sauce and water. This is a real crowd pleaser, it takes some time but is definately worth it!

I made this (tripled the recipe) for my huge family the day after Thanksgiving. Everyone, from the 94-year-old to the 17-month-old, absolutely loved it. I made sure the bread cubes were well-toasted, used frozen, cooked meatballs, and omitted the additional water. It's a keeper!

I took this for lunch one day and ate during study hall  (I am a middle school teacher).  Several of my students drooled on my desk and demanded the recipe so their moms could make it.  A few months later they had earned lunch and this is what they requested!

This was sooo good! You've got to toast the bread first like the other reviews explain. It really keeps the bread from getting to soggy. The only problem with this dinner is that you can't eat as much as you would like because you get too full!

Great idea and Great tasting!  Next time I'll use less sauce and bake the bread (to harden) before spreading the cheese mixture so the bread will not get mushy. Instead of cutting the bread into 1 inch pieces, I sliced the bread and placed the slices on the bottom of the pan which made it easy to spread on the cheese. I think next time I'll add more meatballs!!!

My husband and I and all 3 of my kids liked this.  I couldn't,however get all of the bread to fit in the 9X13 pan.  I heated the cream cheese and mayo mixture in the microwave and it spread more easily.  Does anyone else think it might be easier just to fold the bread crumbs into the mayo and cream cheese mixture?  I may try that the next time.

This recipe has a wonderful flavor.  I was quite surprised.  If you can't fit all the bread in the dish, don't worry, just add a little garlic powder to the leftover spread and put it on the extra slices of bread. Sprinkle with shredded parmesian cheese ( or cheese of choice ) and bake during the last 10-15 minutes of the casserole. It is delicious.

It was delicious!
Because of the anticipated tediousness of spreading the cheese on individual bread cubes, I followed Adrian's idea to cook it all in a hollowed out bread bowl, and substituted ricotta for the mayo. 
I think it was too much work and created too many dishes for meatball sandwiches though. My son, whose day it was to wash dishes, agrees.
I will keep the cheese spread recipe (that was FABULOUS) and just spread it on the hot dog buns for our regular meatball sandwiches.

I have made this several times.  I double up on the meatballs, pound of hamburger and 16z of hot Italian sausage.  Make hamburger meatballs, Italian sausage meatballs and a mix of both.  Instead of cubing up the bread, too hard to spread the spread on them.  I just slice the bread into half inch thick rounds and put those in the dish.  Much easier for me.  If there is time I will make a quick marinara, if not I will use jarred.  Both work fine for us.  What I really like is that this makes a lot but the leftovers will be eaten.  Doesn't last long.

Just made this.  I didn't read the reviews until this was in the oven cooking.  Next time, I'll make sure i read them BEFORE I do anything!

I made some small changes to this.  I didn't make my own meatballs, I used frozen.  I cooked them in the spaghetti sauce with the garlic, water and pepper until the meatballs were hot.

I couldn't find an Italian loaf so I used french bread instead.  Others said they toasted the bread first.  I'll didn't even think about this and will definitely do this the next time I make this.

Quite a few reviewers said to leave out the water, I didn't. The bread was a little soggy, but that was ok with us.  Next time though, I'd cut the water in it half and see how that works out.  

Other reviewers said to skip the mayo and use Ricotta cheese.  I used the mayo and it was fine, but I think I'll try the Ricotta next time.  I'd also add more Italian spice to the mix.  It was just a tad bland.  

This made a really good meal and I will definitely be making it again soon.

I made this with gluten free bread. I only had sliced sandwich bread available at my local grocery store. I sliced about 3/4 of the loaf into cubes and then toasted in the over for a bit. Then I topped with a layer of shredded cheese. I donâ€™t love Mayo so I used ricotta and cream cheese. That was spread on next, followed by meatballs, sauce and more shredded cheese. Baked as directed and it was amazing!  I will make again. The toasted bread did not get soggy.

I skipped the mayo, doubled the ground beef, put the pyrex with bread in it in the oven on broil to toast the bread, which in turn made it easier to spread the cream cheese. Came out amazing. Thank you so much for this recipe!

We loved this recipe. As much as I hate rating something that I didn't follow exactly, it was close enough to the original recipe. I made my own spaghetti sauce and meatballs to start. Instead of cubing bread and then spread the mixture over each small piece. I baked frozen garlic bread and used that. I didn't cut up the bread but just spread the cream cheese mixture on top of each piece of bread. This was SO Good!! My husband went back for seconds! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

Did not care for this at all.  Despite toasting the bread and eliminating as much as the liquid as possible, it was still soggy. Not for us.

Delicious!  Made it with toasted hoagie buns and Costco frozen meatballs.  Also omitted the water as others suggested (I do put a bit of water in the spaghetti sauce jar to get all the sauce.)

I really enjoyed the recipe.  My daughter loves it too.  I'll definitely make it again but maybe with a little less mayo. The meatballs came out really good but make the onions finely diced. This will definitely become a regular meal.

I had some misgivings about this recipe due to the mayo and cream cheese. No meatball sandwich I ever ate had those two ingredients and this doesn't taste like a meatball sandwich. Next time I will leave them out, add oregano and Italian seasoning and use pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce.

Not sure what to think of this....none was left so it must have been ok. But kids complained too much sauce, too much cheese.  It was a bit....tart? I probably won't make again.

I made this recipe.  The only change I made was to use only half of the Italian bread.  A 1 pound loaf was way too much!  Other than that, my husband and I enjoyed it.

Made as written. No water added. But then will add more pasta sauce to replace. The bread spread makes the whole thing. Made it for Super Bowl. Everyone loved it. Will make again for sure.

Recipe is very forgiving; I (as usual) made lots of mistakes, including not toasting the bread. But ours didn't turn out mushy. I was also lazy and used frozen store bought meatballs. Everyone said it was ok... but really liked it the 2nd day! So, my 3 stars went to 4! :)

Made this as directed and the kids loved it.  I was going to try ricotta instead of the mayo but my ricotta had gone bad.  So mayo it was.  I had a bite or two and could see how this is a family friendly dinner and I couldn't notice the mayo much but the cream cheese added a nice touch of creaminess...

We liked it but this won't make it into the regular rotation due to the fat and calories. I used turkey meatballs and subbed the mayo for low fat ricotta.

Sorry but I like when others share their versions of recipes.  I don't find it disrespectful at all, but rather very informative.  I used garlic bread, baked ahead. I used light cream cheese, mozzarella and mayo to lighten up the calories.  It was awesome.  Will have it once in a while as a treat.

Added pork, sautÃ©ed onions and mushrooms and a few cooked bacon slices to the meatballs. Added zesty Italian dressing to the cheese mixture. I did not add water to the sauce and just poured it over the meatballs and bread. My husband and really enjoyed this. It made enough fo about eight people.

Like others, I subbed ricotta for mayo. I used my own meatball recipe (simple, one pound ground turkey, 2 egg whites and 1/4 c breadcrumbs). I also toasted bread. Didn't cube it, but will next time. And yes this is a make again!!!!! Fantastic gooey goodness.

This was a surprisingly good recipe.  We didn't have italian seasoning, so we used this season mix for pasta sauce.  It came out fine.  We also used a garlic wonderbread loaf instead of regular italian bread.  I did find the meatballs themselves a little bland.  Next time I'll find a more inventive meatball recipe and this thing should come out perfect

This was a huge hit!  My picky father absolutely LOVED it, as did the rest of my family.  In fact, he requested I make it again... already. I used light cream cheese and mayo, but it was still very rich, creamy and delicious.  A++

I followed the recipe except I didn't cube my bread.  Instead I used a loaf of French bread and hollowed out most of the center.  I also did not add water to the spaghetti sauce.  Pretty good sandwich, but you don't want any left-overs.  Not as good the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

The meatballs were great so nice to make them in the oven.  I toasted the bread and did not use the water but did add an extra cup of sauce. Way to soggy. I would like to try it again with Texas garlic toast on the bottom and 2.5-3 cups of spag sauce and no water.

The meatballs were excellent. Too much cream cheese for my liking and the bread did not do well. If I were to make this again, I would bake the bread first.

I have to agree with some of the previous posts. The cream cheese and mayo spread on top of the bread makes the texture very strange. If I make this again, I will omit the cream cheese and make the filling more like lasagna filling. I will however make the meatballs again because those were very good.

this was all right. followed other suggestions & sliced the bread & did not use the water. edges of bread were crispy, but middle was soggy. next time i feel like a meatball parm, will probably just make one.

The IDEA is good, but this recipe just doesn't cut it.  The cream cheese mixture is out of place.  We saved the meatballs and mozz from the top and threw the rest away.  I think meatball sandwiches on toasty, buttery, crusty bread is easier and tastier!

Took others suggestions and eliminated the water -- added more sauce.  Also reduced the mayo in half.  Will cut the cream cheese back a bit as well the next time.  I used slices of homemade french bread rather than the cubes -- not soggy at all.

The kids really enjoyed this, I thought it was just okay.  I followed advice of other reviewers and omitted the water.  I toasted the bread cubes too.  Mine turned out a bit dry.  Next time I will not toast the bread and see if it turns out better.  Otherwise, the flavor was really good.

this recipe washad too much mayonaise... it tasted and smelled bad. it might have been better with some pasta between the cheese and meatball layer.  i would not reccomend this AT all, and i and my boyfriend were very displeased.

The taste & general "makeup" of this recipe reminded me of lasagne. Since my husband likes lasagne, he declared a keeper.  I found it pretty easy to assemble, so that was another plus.  Thanks, Holly, for the fine post.

I guess this isn't a fair review since I changed the recipe but there were too many negative comments about the soggy bread using the original recipe. I didn't want to take a chance.  So, I took another reviewers suggestion and took my large loaf of crusty italian bread and hollowed out the center.  Added the meatballs and cheese, wrapped in foil and baked for 20 minutes.  Luckily I only put the cream cheese mixture on one side (other side was fresh mozarella) The mozarella side was a hit, the cream cheese side not so much.  The cream cheese overpowered the meatballs.  Thanks for the recipe but I think I'll stick to my standard meatball sub next time.

Used store bought meatballs because I was in a rush and cut the recipe in half since there are only three of us.  I fixed a small plate and went on to make dessert for an event we are going to when I went back for more it was all gone!

My husband and I both thought this was great!  (Even with frozen, store-bought Italian meatballs)  Leftovers were equally good, but the bread was better the first night, less soggy.  I'll definitely be making this for the lunch crew at work--thanks a million!

ok, i made this for my brother in law and his wife and child when they came to visit.  i must have done something wrong, because my bread on the bottom of the casserole was all mushy and slimy?  maybe the bread should go on the top of the casserole instead of the bottom where all the juices are?  everyone thought the meatballs were wonderful...extraordinary they said.  but the rest of the casserole?  i was embarassed and they politely didn't say anything (and didn't eat it either).

very good! I did double the meatballs and cut the mayo to 1/4 cup. The rest was the same. The bread was somewhat soggy, but not offensively. The heavy crust on the Italian bread stood up. All in all, everyone like this and I will definitely make it again. Tasted exactly like a meatball sub!

Awesome recipe. Changed it up a little. Instead of green onions, I used white onions and I accidently put garlic in both the meatballs but my boyfriend enjoyed it. Overall, very excellent recipe.

My family loved this!  I used my own meatball recipe, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It was not soggy or mushy and none of the flavors were overwhelming.  The flavors meld together wonderfully.  Other reveiws had suggested that this was labor intensive, but I found it easy to put together.

Very tasty.  My husband thought the bread was a little soggy, but compared to another similar recipe, I didn't.  It made a lot of food, but the leftovers were good too.  I did toast the bread under the brolier before coating it with the cream cheese mixture.

I took the advice of some others and omitted the water, and only used half the required mayo.  I also added some italian seasoning to the sauce and sliced the italian loaf lengthwise and lightly browned and spread the cream mixture over the bread prior to cubing.  My daughter's boyfriend loved this.

toasted the bread, kept the cubes quite tightly packed and omitted the water and my hubby said the bread was too crunchy! I can't win!
I also just dotted the cream cheese mixture over instead of spreading - that sounded impossible.
And I used way more cheese. 
Overall, it was a nice one off meal but too rich for regular use - great for a winter night with kids and you have an excess of meatballs or fancy bread.

I loved this recipe!!  My co-workers and family enjoyed it thoroughly!! I did alter it slightly, I mixed asiago italian loaf bread with 12 grain bread and used more than called for in the recipe.  I also didn't add the additional water and I didn't have enough spaghetti sauce so I used 2 cups ketchup and mixed it with the 1 cup of ragu I did have, this gave it a slightly sweeter taste, but it was excellent!!  Not soggy....

WoWEEEE, this is good! So easy to prepare. Used not quite 1 loaf of Italian bread. Also quickened up the process by using package frozen meatballs. Concept of this casserole is great, you can jazz it up anyway you like your sandwiches, even if you like onions and hubby doesn't, just make it half and half. Family really liked it. Will be sharing this recipe at work and i'll be making again for sure.

The mayo/cream cheese mixture was a bit much, I would probably cut down on this part next time.  I did use more meatballs and I cut them in halves so they filled more of the pan evenly. It was good, but next time I will use the mayo sparcely.  It was a little overwhelming.

I did use my own meatballs...just because they are great!  This was wonderful.  Everyone had seconds.  Mine was not mushy but I used lean beef and baked the meatballs.  Maybe that made a diffrence?
Thank You

I doubled the meatballs and used a loaf of day old french bread, and omitted the water.  Our bread came out perfect, but we thought it needed a bit of water in the sauce.  Will definitely make again, great comfort foood.

My husband was very impressed with this recipe and said it's a keeper!  I used half the amount of water and thawed, frozen meatballs.  It really did taste like a sub sandwich and was very filling.

I thought this was just ok, not something I would make again.  I thought the taste of mayonnaise was strong, but my fiance couldn't taste it.  I only used about half a loaf of french bread and the pan was full.  It might have been better with more meatballs.

The reason I gave this recipe 2 stars, is because the recipe didn't turn out at all, it was very liquidy. (and yes I followed the directions as is) The taste was ok, but I would never recommend it as a good recipe.

Fantastic recipe --- my husband loved it too.  Left us feeling very satisfied for the night.   

I did eliminate the water - and broiled the bread for a little bit.  Definately double the meatball recipe also! It was perfect amount doubled.  

 And it turned out great... my husband said it was one of his favorites.  

I plan on making this for a friend who just had a baby.   Perfect pot-luck dish also.

the favor was excellent. The bread got soggy. I sliced the bread instead of cubed. Will try again, maybe with the bread on the top.

This was okay.  The casserole turned out fine, but everyone preferred meatball sandwitches instead of the casserole.  It couldn't compete!  Probably won't make again.

I would have given this 3 stars but my husband thought it was excellent so I gave it a rating in between.  I didn't think it was anything special & I didn't like the meatballs, there were 30 of them.  I used day old rolls I bought at the grocery & tore them into small pieces, put them in the 9X13 pan in the oven while I prepared the meatballs.  I also doubled the cheese, Italian Seasoning & garlic.

I tried this recipe but because I knew the cream cheese would not go over well with my family, I adjusted it a bit for fear that the bread would get soggy without the cream cheese mixture.  I followed the recipe for the meat balls, baked them with the sauce and moz cheese and served the bread on the side.  The meat balls were the best I have ever had and very easy to make.  Rave reviews from my family (even the picky one!)

Too much work, 1 loaf Italian bread cut into 1 inch cubes... then, arrange bread cubes in a single layer in a 9x13 inch baking dish, impossible! My kids refused to eat it, hubby said bread was soggy even though I toasted the entire loaf before cooking the casserole. Not impressed.

The first time I made this, I found it to be a little dry (I used the entire loaf of Italian bread like the recipe calls for).  The second time I made it, I only used half of the bread and I spread a thin layer of spaghetti sauce on the bottom of the pan before I put the bread in.  Also, I used a Pampered Chef cake decorator filled with the cream cheese mixture and piped it onto the cubes of bread.  That way you don't have to worry about spreading it (much easier).  Also, I would double the amount of meatballs (I made the ones in the recipe).  It seemed like too much bread, not enough meat.  I eliminated the water because I used homemade (and thick) spaghetti sauce; however, maybe this is why it was dry.  Duh. :)

I've made this twice now, and the whole family loves it. For best results use day old home made Italian bread, and make mix the cheese/mayo mixture until very soft/creamy. Get the recipe for Mama D's Italian bread on this site, It's perfect.

This was great! I let the Italian bread get really crusty--I let it sit in its paper sleeve for 2 days before using. Then I toasted it slightly after cubing it. No soggy bread! I also doubled the garlic because I love garlic! Will make this again.

This recipe rocks!!!! Definitely deserves 5 stars! It even tastes great the next day! The hardest part is trying to spread the cream cheese layer on - but it is so worth it! I have made this recipe for all of my friends and family and there is never any leftovers!

The flavor was good but the texture of the bread was soggy.  Even after toasting the bread and using a very course, crispy bread from the bakery. We won't make this again. Sorry.

This recipe was easy enough to make, I thought the meatballs were a little dry.  I agree with everyone about the bread, a little soggy and way too much.  I didn't care for the cream cheese mixture.  We ate it, but before I make it again I need to make some adjustments.  But I am willing to do that and try it again!

I made this just as the instructions said and it was good. I personally did not like the cream cheese spread but thought the meatballs came out nice. The bread did get a little soggy but it tasted good.

I tried this as one of the "freezer meals" for my elderly parents.  It turned out GREAT!!! I divided the recipe in half (since there are just the two of them) and used 2 small foil pans. My advice is to spray a piece of foil with cooking spray before covering the top of the casserole, and remove the foil before baking orthe cheese may still stick.
Defrost a casserole overnight in the refrigerator and bake!

Okay well all the other reviews on the bread scared me, so I let the bread set out for a little to get crustier. (BTW next time I would use only 1/2 the bread stated in the recipe) I then put on the crm chz/mayo/seasoning stuff but I added a whole lot more mozzarela cheese so the sauce couldn't make it through and make it super soggy. Otherwise I think this tasted really good. You couldn't tell it was crm chz/mayo...everyone thought it was garlic bread. lol

My husband and I were not crazy about this. It seemed like a good idea in concept, but the results were just so-so. I had the same problem with soggy bread, depite using hardy ciabatta bread, which was dried and toasted, and eliminating the water. The cream cheese spread was good, but didn't really seem right in this dish (I did however save the leftover spread and used it on crackers and bagels). The meatballs were okay, but not outstanding, even after I added additional herbs, garlic, and an egg. Making just a plain old meatball sub would have been easier and probably tastier.

I have been making this for 8 YEARS - and my family LOVES it.  I serve it to guests and they ask for the recipe and often take some home.  

The first year or so, I made it exactly as written: meatballs from scratch, the whole 9 yards.  It is AWESOME - anyone giving it less than 5 stars  must not like Italian food all that well.

HOWEVER - after having children, I did not have the luxury of always making meatballs from scratch, so I have been substituting with ready made frozen Italian meatballs. It is still awesome.

One major tip - make sure you really coat all the bread with the mayo cream cheese mixture or you will get very soggy bread.  The mayo makes a nice moisture barrier to keep the bread dry until you cut/serve.  Then all bets are off since the sauce will drip into the cut out areas.  

Enjoy!

this is an amazing dish, but you want it a little bit healthier?? USE TURKEY GROUND MEAT. I swear, it tastes exactly the same and you save a TON of fat and calories.  Also, after rolling the meatballs and putting them on the pan, I sprinkled them with garlic powder. And I love garlic (also good for the heart) so I doubled the cloves and it wasn't too strong at all. I completely reccomend this recipe!!

This did not turn out well for me.  The meatballs were very good but the bread was so soggy that it didn't get eaten by anyone in the family. Maybe toasting it is the key. I don't think we will try it again though I will use the meatball recipe.

It was pretty good but I don't think I would make it again. I think it was the cream cheese. I would rather have the sandwich. Thanx though.

This recipe was great. The bread was a little soggy the first time, but that was easy to fix next time I made it by toasting it. I'm not too crazy about mayonnaise, so I all but left it out. Some people may have liked it in their meatballs, I'm just not one of those people. Personally, I like a little more kick to mine, so I added more pepper and garlic. I've made it several times and will in the future.

Good recipe with good flavors.  Fairly easy to make. Used Prego sauce, next will use homemade sauce. Tasted a little processed, otherwise very good.

This is really good!! I followed the suggestions of others and I left out the water and toasted the bread. I also added 1 cup more of the spaghetti sauce. I couldn't use all the bread because there wasn't enough room in the pan and I had a hard time getting it to pack down, (like others said) in order to spread the cream cheese mixture. Nonetheless, it came out really good! I will definitely make this again and again!

I left out the water and toasted the bread as suggested and added more sauce and cheese. The kids thought it was Lasagna and loved it! I plan on using the meatballs for spaghetti since they were so good. This is a great recipe! Thanks!

I read what others had to say and did not add the extra water. I also used day (or two) old french bread and it turned out great. Make sure to cook the meatballs on a broiler so the fat drips through.

This will be on my family's hit list from now on!  I changed some things, I used "roasted garlic" bread. Toasted in the oven until somewhat hard, also to the cream cheese mixture I added fresh garlic (about 3 large cloves, we love garlic) and parmesan cheese, onion powder.  Then I sprinkled mozzarella cheese over this mixture, then added the meatball mixture and topped with more mozzarella. I also did not use the water as suggested from other users, this was wonderful!!

I am so glad I tried this recipe. It is now one of my favorites off of this site. Mine came out perfect. My whole family couldn't get enough of this. I did not add the water like others suggested and it was not soggy at all. I used about half of the cream cheese and 1/4 of mayo. I used crusty italian bread and spread just enough of the cream cheese and mayo mixture to spread a thin layer over the bread. I didn't use all of the mixture. I didn't change anything else. I will be making this over and over again. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This recipe would have been sooo much better had I not added any water to the sauce.  The bread was so soggy that the consistancy was really hrd to swallow.  I tried to dry it up a little, but it did not work.  I will try it again without water!

This sounded good on paper, but the taste just wasn't what I expected.  My husband did eat it and said he would again, but didn't act very excited about it.

This had a weird taste to it.  It wasn't bad, just not something we want to make again.  Hard to put my finger on what I didn't like.

This had a good flavor, but we prefer good ol' spaghetti and meatballs. The good part was discovering the Italian Bread Using a Bread Machine recipe on this site.

I had the problem that the bread soaked up all the sauce--so it was really mushy.
If you can figure out how to keep it from doing that, it'd be GREAT!

Great, delicious recipe! Takes some time to prepare this one, but we served it to company the first time I made it and it was a huge hit! This is a unique form of comfort food - great for winter!

The bread used in this dish was very soggy after cooking.  Other wise the flavor was pretty good.

I made this dish the other night and the whole family loved it!  Next time I might a little more spice to it, but other than that it was great.  Very easy to make.

This was fairly easy and a pretty good last minute meal.  I had to substitute sour cream because I didn't have cream cheese and it worked out fine.

Very interesting flavour.  Easy to prepare.  I had to use different ingrediants.  I used ground turkey for the meatballs (very nice flavour) and only had cracked wheat bread for base but the spread and the meat went very well together.  My husband said he thought it could use some pasta, but he IS a bit crazy.. so we'll just never mind him!  
I would make it again, but try it closer to what the recipe called for!

I have to say this sounded very yummy, but the delivery was disappointing. I did substitute Italian Sausage for ground beef which was a good choice, I thought. The meatballs were very good. However, the combination of cream cheese, mayo, and spaghetti sauce left alot to be desired. The bread on bottom got a little hard. I would not make this again.

My husband actually thought the bread wasn't soaked enough with sauce (I had omitted the water).  I would add the water next time.  Not sure if I am going to make it again, though I really liked it.

husband loves it - need to watch the bread doesn't get too soggy though.
