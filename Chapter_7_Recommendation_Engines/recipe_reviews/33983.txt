We call this a Caribou Lou. I've never heard it called Brass Monkey, but it tastes great!

The pineapple juice and coconut rum are a great combination and great drink as is ... float 151 proof rum over top and it's taken to another level. I prefer to chill the 151 proof rum to take away the heat (keep a bottle in the freezer) or double/triple the coconut rum and pineapple juice, blend them with ice to make a slushy drink and float chilled 151 proof rum on top and sip with caution.

That funky monkey!!!! Be careful with this baby. If you like less alchohol per drink, use a regular rum. Mango is really nice. Then again, you really drink a brass monkey to get drunk quick, so that would kill the drink.

I made a huge batch of this shot to fill one if the Margaritaville Shot Dispensers. I love it, perfect summer taste with a kick like a mule!  Love it ~ Thank you for sharing. (I served them in ice cube shot glasses ~ The molds are by Wilton)

Wowee. Good flavors but I don't think I have the "brass" to shoot 151 if it hasn't been torched, even just floating on the top. Thanks for sharing, we had fun giving this one a try :)
