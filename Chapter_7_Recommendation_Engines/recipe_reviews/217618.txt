The only changes were i cut the loin so it could be rolled and had some leftover roasted red peppers to add and it made it a little even more fantastic.

I didn't have a pork loin roast so I used pork chops, sliced a pocket into the side and filled with stuffing.  And wrapped in Prosciutto.  Turned out well, I think next time I will marinate the pork chops in something, they weren't dry but on the verge!
