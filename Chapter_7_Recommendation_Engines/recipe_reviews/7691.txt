I changed the frosting part of this recipe to make a more fudgy like frosting.  Used 2 tbsp milk, 12 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1 cup confectionary sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.  Combined milk, chocolate chips and vanilla over heat to melt.  Shifted sugar.  Removed melted conconction from heat, added and stirred sugar until smooth.  Delicious.

This cake was very interesting.  it turn out to be a little dry.  It was nothing exciting about this cake. Not even with the cream cheese in the middle

I'm eating this cake right now and I think it's pretty good.  It's just a nice chocolate cake.  It's not mouth-wateringly delicious, but as far as cakes go, I give it a thumbs up.

This is my husband's favorite cake. I usually make double the amount of filling to make the cake a little more moist and tasty.

Am I the only one who had a problem with this cake.  It calls for 1 cup flour with 1 cup of milk.  Does this ratio not register with any one but me.  This is not a batter it is chocolate milk.
Seems funny that those in charge of this website will allow something like this to be published and I have been waiting 3 years for my recipe to be evaluated.

I have been making this cake for at least 20 yrs!  It is always a hit and I have passed the recipe along to many, many friends.  I don't always make the glaze as it can be very rich.  I only do it for special occasions. I give it two thumbs up!
