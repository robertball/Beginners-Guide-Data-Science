Interesting to try since I love mojitos.  Did taste a lot like a mojito, but it was a bit bitter to me and lacked color.  The apples were the best part of this, crunchy and mojito-flavored. Maybe using firm red and yellow apples (unpeeled to add some color), and combine the lime zest & juice and simple syrup together first before adding to the salad would help.  (I omitted the lemon juice.)

I liked this salad quite a bit. I could not find fresh mint in the little market I went to so I infused some dry mint with the simple syrup that I zapped in the nuker. Fresh, Cool and Yummy! Thank You:)

Very fresh and clean tasting salad!  I substituted agave nectar for the simple syrup and halved the amount of apples.  It was very good.

I did my own version: no simple syrup (too much sugar) and a regular salad dressing spice-packet with some olive oil, water, and lime juice.  But the combination of dressing, lettuce, sour apples, cucumber, and fresh mint leaves was simple and very refreshing!  If you're a fan of sour apples and mint, you'll enjoy this salad.

I would substitute frozen limeade concentrate for the limes and simple syrup.

I made this salad for a family gathering, and it was a huge hit.  My husband isn't a fan, but that just means more for me!  I will be making this often this summer!

I literally tasted like a Mojito but I couldn't eat it as a big salad.  There isn't a lot of different flavors to want to eat it as a meal.  But it is a very nice refreshing side salad.
