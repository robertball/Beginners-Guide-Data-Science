We all LOVED this! I used a little more than 1 pound of ground beef and got 5 patties out of the recipe. Also, I doubled the sauce, but only used 1/2 the water b/c we wanted the sauce to be on the thicker side. I had an 8oz. pkg. of sliced mushrooms to use up, so I cooked them and added them, which was a wonderful addition. I lightened this up a bit by using whole wheat seasoned breadcrumbs, extra lean ground beef and Healthy Request Golden Mushroom Soup. This was very flavorful and comforting for a chilly fall day. I will def be making this again and again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good.  I always use 2 cans of soup to make more gravy.

this recipe was delicious! made it just as the directions said (with the exception of adding my own mushrooms saut√©ed with a little garlic). I usually make a much more fancy and complex salsbury steak, that takes much longer than this recipe. frankly, this one was almost as delicious as my usual recipe. I think i may make this one from now on due to the simplicity of it. 

Note: if you look at the photos, all of the photos have a much darker gravy than one particular photo (mine). I think this was because I used a very lean ground beef, so there wasn't a lot of grease. this is one of very few recipes that call for ground beef that I actually think a higher fat content may make for a better meal/gravy.... although it still tasted amazing! 

thank you for the easy recipe and the full tummies!

I added Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and processed on with the recipe. It turned out pretty good, and the gravy was excellent.

Definitely adding to the book.  Made this tonight for the family and we all loved it.  Sauteed some mushrooms to add with the soup and added some flour at the end to thicken.  Loved It!

Next time I'm adding fewer bread crumbs though.  It was a tiny bit on the dry side but really authentic tasting.  I made my own gravy instead of the mushroom soup.  The onion soup mix worked well and wasn't nearly as salty as I was afraid it was going to be.

My picky teenagers love this, along with my husband and I. I do use a pack of gravy mix at the end, on the side. This is a great tasting and way easy recipe!

This was an excellent base recipe. I had never made Salisbury steaks before and didn't know it could be this easy.

To be honest, I have never had Salisbury steak before, so I have nothing to  compare it to.  with  that  being said, I made this recipe exactly as instructed, and I thought it was great!   I will definitely make this recipe again, very soon! However, I will do a couple things a little bit differently.  First of all, I will not cook the steaks as well done as they were.  I will only cook them for 4 minutes on each side at just barely above medium heat. And,  since I prefer my sauces to be a little thicker, I will add about a teaspoon and a half of corn starch to the sauce to let it thicken a little.

This was excellent and easy! I made it exactly as said, except my bread crumbs were Italian and I turned the heat down on the skillet a little bit when initially cooking the steaks.

Family LOVES this one.   My side dish is Egg Noodles.
I also use 1.75lbs ground beef (85% lean), double bread crumbs, soup mix and eggs to get the 6 patties large enough.

I made this for dinner for my husband. He absolutely LOVED it! The only thing I did was double the sauce to have extra to top our mashed potatoes. This will definitely be added to our monthly menu!!!

Great recipe.  Followed the recipe with the following minor changes.  Did not fry the meat patties, smothered 1/2 of the soup mixture in the bottom of the slow cooker, set the raw patties on top & poured the rest of the soup mixture on top of the patties and spooned it over them, so they can be covered.  Added few dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and some to the sauce.  Also added 2 cups of  sliced baby bella mushrooms to the sauce mixture. Cooked it on high for 3 hours.  Next time, might cut the dried onion soup to 3/4 packet, as was a bit salty.   Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This was delicious!  We loved the flavor of the beef patty.  I thickened the gravy with a little flour and served over mashed potatoes with green beans.  Growing up, I loved my Mom's "burger patties with mushroom sauce".  I never realized it was Salisbury Steak!  Yum and thank you!

This came out sooooo good!!  I did have to make a change for the gravy from the cream of mushroom soup to a can of turkey gravy. I had the gravy, not the soup on hand. Sometimes subbing out works, sometimes not, this time It definitely was a good substitute.

Very easy recipe and delicious results. Did a 50/50 mix of water/milk to the soup and saut√©ed fresh mushrooms while frying the patties. Served with mashed pots and sweet corn. Great comfort food. A keeper!!

Never made so much as a meatball before so I followed this recipe to the letter. Husband said it was the best salisbury steak he's ever had. Even my toddler loved it. Now this is a staple in my household. Thank you!

Super simple, quick and inexpensive main dish. I  followed the recipe but also added mushrooms to the suace. I think I'll add just a little bit of flour to the mix to thicken it up or maybe only half a can of soup. Everyone enjoyed it though. We served it over mashed potatoes and steamed carrots as a side.

Wow, that was great.  I read  a few reviews and put in some fresh mushrooms.  I also added some flour to the mix to thicken it up.  Amazing and family loved it.

I had to make changes because of my food allergies. I used portabello mushroom soup & brown gravy mix for the sauce (squirt in a dollop of minced garlic). Cooked the brown gravy in the microwave first before pouring over patties. Poured some of the mushroom soup in with the burger mix & also added almost liquified onion (run it in the blender since my bf hates chunks of onion but likes onion flavor & chopping onions sucks).

I love this recipe. Easy and delicious comfort food. It still is one of my favorite dishes and reminds me of my mother and siblings.
