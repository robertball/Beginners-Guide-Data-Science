Wonderful flavour and I'm not sure if cooking it with the lid off changed the texture but it came out perfectly fluffy for me as 10 mins (no lid) and 15 mins (closed lid.)  I will definitely make this again!

This rice was so good that I almost wrote this review while we were eating dinner! I made it with leftover rice from earlier in the week—so instead of using 2 cups of water, I just used enough to steam the rice back to life. This recipe is a keeper, and I will definitely prepare again.

Okay, this is seriously awesome!  I served it alongside chicken, and my brother thought it was the best part of the meal! I used dry cilantro instead of fresh, but that is the only thing I changed.  I've already made this rice twice!

I used basmati rice, red onions and quite a bit more than the 3 drops of lemon juice called for in the recipe, and this rice was really good. It paired nicely with the garlic and cheddar chicken I made as the main. Will definitely make again.

I used long grain brown rice.  I had to add a bit more water.  I didn't have any fresh lemon so I used lemon pepper.  It was delicious.  I'll definitely make it again.

I was looking for a quick rice recipe and this checked all the boxes!  I used jasmine rice, added a bit more cilantro (we love cilantro), and more lemon juice (I didn’t measure, I added to taste).  My family loved it - especially my daughter who would more often prefer pasta or a sweet potato to rice as a side dish.

I liked this rice. It really kept its texture similar to a brown rice. The cook time was perfect. Though, I did soften the onion and garlic on medium and simmered at the temperature before covering turning down and simmering. For ease I used a non stick pan with a lid instead of a pot. My only change was cutting the amount of Kosher salt, I used, in half and it was plenty. I typically use cilantro fresh and liked the flavor it gave this right being added to the cook time. I would make this again. Ty

I have made this numerous times and it is the only rice side dish that I make now.  It is 5 stars the way it is written.  I change it up occasionally, using more onion or garlic depending on my mood, sometimes I use lime juice instead of lemon.  It is the best rice dish for us

When I looked at the ingredients, I asked, "What's all the fuss about?".  I made it, tasted it, ate it.  Now I get it.  This is great! Nice, creamy, flavorful.

I cooked my rice first then put it in the pan with the garlic and onions. I added the cilantro and lemon juice a minute after I mixed the onions and garlic in with the rice. It came out so much better for me and it was delicious.

This is five stars if you are looking for a subtly flavored rice to pair with a grilled meat. The flavors combine beautifully to make a delicious side. Please don't skip the lemon juice, and I admit I squeezed in more than the 3 drops recommended. If you have leftovers, this rice is delicious on day two, as well.

I've never seen any Brazilians put cilantro in their rice. Thats more of a Mexican thing, and not a Portuguese thing. I didn't like the flavor... That is just MY opinion

Loved this rice! I did use lime juice in place of the lemon and more than called for (juice of 1 whole lime), because I wanted a lime flavor. Great combo of flavors...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

First time through and this rice was great! I followed the recipe exactly. Next time through I will definitely add coarse black pepper, or maybe cayenne—or both! That’s just me. Great simple recipe for dressing up rice.

This recipe I love and have made 4 times since I discovered it 10 days ago.  I find it’s pretty complimentary to any dish.  It’s like fancier, tastier white rice without all of the unknowns in a box of rice mix.

I'm Brazilian. Cilantro in the rice? Probably if I'm serving with a "Moqueca Bahiana" and by the way some coconut milk would be added to the rice too.
Besides that the cooking method are right.

It was awesome. I used Jasmine rice cause that is what I had on hand. Also, it could of used a little bit more water to prevent the rice sticking to the bottom of pan.

I love rice and eat it almost every day myself, but with these little added ingredients made all the difference. I've made it twice in the last three days..

This was delicious. I added a tsp. of chicken bouillon to the liquid for more flavor and I also added fresh minced cilantro to the finished dish for more visual appeal.

On  FodMap diet, so I skipped the onion and garlic, but used one tablespoon garlic-infused olive oil. Delicious!

I'm testing 20 Brazilian Recipes for a Labor Day Weekend party "Rio Theme" for about 140 guests and this one was very tasty. I do believe though a little more water is needed if on the stove top but next time I make it, it will be either in a pressure cooker or rice maker. Making it again today. Review to follow.

we enjoyed it for a slight change from white rice. It was mildly flavored and perfect for picky kiddos easy to adjust for more flavor next time

Simple to make and tastes great. For the first time, I didn't have to go out shopping for ingredients because they are all common ingredients that I already had at home. I'm not a big fan of cilantro though, so I just didn't include it.

I used dried cilantro as I didn't have fresh. I followed the recipe and it was just okay. I will try it again, maybe using stock instead of water.
