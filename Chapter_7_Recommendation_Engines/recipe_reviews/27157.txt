I made this recipe a couple weeks ago and just added a bit more cinnamon. My husband (a very picky eater) couldn't stay away from the nuts! They were litterally gone in a matter of minutes. I'm making these to give as Christmas gifts this year because they taste so good! I would recommend baking in a 9x13 dish rather than on a cookie sheet as the sides of the pan make it much easier to push the nuts around without making a mess when you have to stir the mixture.

I made these low carb, using splenda instead of the sugar.  They came out perfect.

This was exactly what I had been hoping for. I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the egg white and water mixture. Reminds me of the nut snack I had at the Baldknobbers show in Branson, Mo.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!!!! My 6 year old daugher and I made these for her class for Texas Day--we were asked to make something with pecans so this was perfect!!! I did follow other reviewers advice and used 1 cup of sugar and a tbs of cinnamon--also made a double batch!! WOW--they were awesome and made the house smell great!! They tasted so good we could not stop eating them--I feared there would be none left for my daughters class!!!!! LOL!!! Thanks for a great and EASY recipe!!

I just needed to add something--I was at my daughters school today and was BOMBARDED by the teachers AND kids wanting this recipe!! It was a huge hit--even with 6 year olds!!!!!! Thanks!!!

Wow!  Easy and absolutely delicious!  I submitted a photo of the finished product and it was hard to stop picking at it during the cooking process!  I only had half a pound of pecans but used all the same measurements and it came out perfectly coated and delicious!  I will definintely give these out for Christmas.  It's much better than the nut kiosk you see in the malls.  It's so easy to make its absolutely effortless!  A must recipe for the holidays!

Wow! These were SO easy to make - much easier than the candied walnuts on this site where you have to take the sugar syrup to a soft ball stage. I ruin a pan every time I make those, but I didn't realize there was such a simpler alternative. These, by comparison, are a piece of cake. I made them with Splenda, and unfortunately, they do have a bit of an aftertaste, so next time I'll just use real sugar and live a little. I baked them on a parchment covered jelly roll pan, so clean-up was a breeze too!

I use a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon and a little more than four cups of nuts (usually a mixture of pecans, walnuts, and almonds).

These things are so good friends are threatening to bring me pecans so I can make them more.  I use 1 cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.  It sounds like a lot of cinnamon, but it's perfect.

Love them as does my diabetic family. Substituted sugar with 3/4 cup splenda and also added 1/4 cup Splenda brown sugar. Use 1 tbsp rather than tsp of cinnamon and also added 1 tsp vanilla to the egg whites.

Been making variations of this for years; everyone loves to get them! For 2 lbs of pecans, I used 1/4 cup sugar; 1/2 cup Ideal sugar sub, and 1/2 cup of Splenda brown sugar blend.  I upped the cinnamon to 3 tsp, only used 1 1/4 tsp salt.  They are great and pretty low carb as well.

These are OUTRAGEOUSLY good.  I used walnuts, since that's what we had in the house, and they were great.  They are delicious sprinkled over a salad of greens, sliced pears and dried cranberries with a citrus vinaigrette.  I couldn't stop eating these.

I have made these twice now and both times they were raved over.  I love candied nuts but good ones are hard to find and never cheap, but these top them all and are way cheaper.  Super easy to make!  I absolutly love these!

I used brown sugar instead of white. They were way beyond yummy. I had them in small bowls just as you would put any snack item and everybody raved about them. Even my little brother, who doesn't like pecans, kept heading back for more. Also, if you're looking for something to fill your house with a "festive" aroma, this is your answer.  Thanks Bea.

Very very good. I used vanilla with the water. I used mostly brown sugar and tripled the cinnamon. Great suggestions from others. I also used a 9x13 pan so it was easier to stir.

Hard to stop eating them.  A fun way for kids is to take a piece of 8.5x11 piece of paper, line it with wax paper and roll into a cone shape, then decorate the outside by coloring or stickers, fill with the nuts and kids love getting their own cone and eating them this way!

I brought these to work, and everyone who tasted them wanted the recipe; one lady wouldn't let me go until she had called it up on her computer and printed it out.  They may not look pretty and the title may not be catchy, but boy, are they tasty.  I'm always looking for little gifts for people like the mail lady or for times when I'm expected to bring goodies to a gathering.  This recipe is perfect.  It's easy; the end product doesn't require refrigeration, (yet I could stick them in the mailbox over night--in Vermont, that's saying something) and, compared to many recipes, this one is relatively healthy and hearty.  All I can say is thank goodness for Costco and pecans in bulk!  Thank you for sharing.

I love this recipe!!!!! I added cashews with the pecans. Everyone loved it. I will however be giving these out in cute containers for Christmas gifts without the cashews. My friends said they liked the pecans better than the cashews. I did add a little more sugar and cinnamon and less salt. Will make a lot more for Christmas.
Thanks for sharing this recipe.
Merry Christmas to all.

Sickening!!!  Truly - I ate so many the first time I made myself sick!  These are so good, so easy and so quick to make!  I have also used almonds and both turn out wonderfully.  I tried to double the batch once, when making pecans and didn't add to the baking time.  They were still great - not as crispy though.  So, if I double it again, I'll probably add another 15-30 minutes to the baking time.  (The softer batch was perfect for my grandma though - who loves these nuts but can't always eat things that are too hard.)

YUMMIE - I like them a touch sweeter so I reduced the salt to 1/2t and added a bit more cinnamon.  Also the egg white should be beaten to stiff peaks.  The coating tasted lighter and crispier the second day for some reason. Make 3 pounds because you will not be able to stop eating these!!!!

pretty good stuff, but I found that I couldn't tell if the nuts were close to burning because of the mixture.....it was still wet but I could smell the nuts--a sure sign that they have had enough heat.  I think I might try this one again as they were very tasty, but perhaps take out a few minutes early.

This recipe is AWESOME!! It was a hit with my husband!    ;o)    Highly addictive & today I made it a 2nd time & doubled the recipe! Like others have mentioned, I increased the cinnamon to a tablespoon & added 1 tsp. vanilla. We cannot have sugar so I make it with 1/2 C. Sweet & Low & I also add 1/4 C. Splenda brown sugar.

We love these.  I make about 6 lbs. during the holiday season and give most away as gifts and for parties (although my family swipes plenty).  I use 1 T of vanilla instead of water, 1 T of cinnamon, 1/2 cup of sugar, and bake them on a buttered baking sheet with sides. I don't stir until they have cooked for 30 minutes.  Decadent!

Very good as-is. They were delicious and smelled great. However, I think next time I'll add a little bit more sugar (1 cup instead of 3/4 cup) to make it more sweet and less salty.

I made this following some to the other reviewers suggestions and it turned out fantastic!  The alterations I made: added 1 tsp vanilla, used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar.  These will be given out as Christmas gifts to my pecan loving family members.

I made these for my husband (who is very, very picky) and he LOVED these.  He even told everyone at his work about them, and now they are taking up a collection(for the nuts) so I will  make them the snack! Thanks so much for a great recipe.  I did take the advice of others and made the following changes: I cup sugar, 1 tbl cin, and  1 tsp of vanilla extract (add to egg mixture).

I've never made anything like these before, and these were so easy! I used mixed nuts (pecans are expensive here in Wales) to try first and they came out fab. So then I committed myself with pecans and they were even better! They are so good I'm giving them as gifts for Christmas! Yummy!

I doubled the batch and that goodness i did! The kids snacked on what i did not put in the salad. I used brown sugar and white sugar. yummy!

I make these at almost every  gathering of family and/or friends and they are gone within a matter of minutes.  The only change I make is to add a bit more cinnamon - just a personal preference.

These are delicious but for a twist I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar - awesome!!  also another twist is to add 2 tablespoons cocoa powder  - everyone loved the slight flavor change

Great for hiking, I don't really like cinnamon so I substituted with chili powder and it came out wonderfully. It's a great add on for any homemade trail mix.

Delicious... don't eat this warm or you'll think you've screwed it up. Something magic happens to these pecans and the coating once it cools. Spectacular! Also if you have a smaller bowl for your big stand mixer, it's better for whipping the egg whites. My large bowl's whisk has a hard time making contact with the egg whites.

We loved this recipe....as a snack by the handful, on salad, as a gift. I have used pecans, walnuts and almonds and a combination of all 3.  I did use 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon! I like the walnut and pecan version the best.  I put sugar mixture in a bag and just dump the nuts in and shake around.  I will try this with a sugar/stevia combo next time.  Thank you for the great recipe.

Amazing!  Hard not to eat them all when they were warm.  I gave these away as Christmas presents.  
They are good to eat out of hand or on a spinach salad.

I didn't have any cinnamon and so I added some honey and a touch of vanilla extract before the sugar. I also used half brown sugar/ half white for an amazing flavor. These are delicious and super easy!

Perfect snack to keep around the house or take to the office.  I thought I may have over cooked them but my familiy & friends loved it.  I would just watch the cooking time... it may not be a full hour.

Yum!  I made this with walnuts rather than pecans, because it was what I had in the house.  It was super easy to make and really, really tasty -- and everyone loved it.  I'm definitely going to make this in the future, and maybe try the pecans that time (though the walnuts were awesome, too).

Delicious!  Love the sweet and salty combination.  In fact, I may add just a little extra salt next time, but that's just personal taste.  Easy, no-fail recipe.

These turned out awesome!!! Way better than the ones you get anywhere else and so easy to make at home. I made a few changes based on other recommendations. I changed the sugar to 1/4 Cup of white and 1/4 Cup brown, added 1/2 Tsp vanilla extract to the egg mixture, and used 1 Tbsp cinnamon. This is a definite keeper. I don't think they will be around long!!

I used half almonds and half pecans and doubled the cinnamon. These were super tasty and so easy. I baked them on parchment paper, so I didn't even have any cleanup! Great recipe! Thanks!

So I made this again tonight and realized I first printed out the recipe in 2007.  It is so easy, everyone loves it and it never fails.  Helpful tip - a 350 degree oven is a lot hotter than a 250 oven.  Not that I ever made that mistake of course.  If you are on the fence about making this, just do it- you won't be sorry.

This recipe is great I made it just as the recipe called for except I doubled the recipe except for the egg white I only used one egg white. The first time I made it I thought it needed a little something so this last time I added an 8th of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Edit just enough cake to really turn this recipe into an amazing treat.

I literally just tried this recipe. I was very glad that I found it because my mom just gave me two big bags of pecans a couple of days ago and I had no idea what to do with them. however after just 30 minutes I felt I had to take them out of the oven. it smells like they were burning, and it looked like they were burning. I did everything exactly as listed. I saw one other person's review who said the same thing, but everyone else says that they followed it exactly and they turned out great. I'm a little confused because I could not see any way that my pecans could have stayed in the oven another 30 minutes

Got everything together mixed it all up, I did add 1/2 teaspoon more cinnamon, put on a jelly roll and popped into the oven. Flipped a turned every 15 minutes, they were sticky after an hour, I excepted them to be dry and look like the picture. I removed them from the oven, continually so mess with for a few minutes and WOW.

Made these and then had to hide them! I only had half a pound of pecans but used the full recipe. I doubled the cinnamon because we are a cinnamon-loving family and these were a hit! I'll be making up another bigger batch to send to other family this week.

These were amazing! I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 teas cayenne for a little kick. I had to roast them another 15 min to get them good and crunchy. Excellent recipe! Not overly sweet.

I have made this several times and it’s always a delicious and addictive snack. The last time I made them I added extra sugar (~1/4cup) and it was really good too.

I stuck to the recipe.  After all, how bad could these be with an entire stick of butter in the batch.  I was wrong and a little disappointed.  They are pretty good but the pecans tasted overdone, burnt almost after only 20 minutes in the oven.  I've made other pecan recipes before with no other liquid than an egg white.  Those tasted a lot better.  I won't be making these again.

Super easy to make. I'm eating some right now and they are so so so good. I added a pinch of nutmeg and a tiny bit of extra cinnamon.

I found this recipe a couple of years ago and now I make it every year as part of my Christmas gifts.  It is loved by everyone.  The recipe is perfect as is, so no need to change anything.  Yummy!!!

I have made this several times and I think it is great as written, but I have made subsequent changes according to my personal tastes. I put vanilla extract in the egg white. And instead of cinnamon, I used 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. I use 1/2 tsp pink salt in the spice mixture and I grind some on top before i put in the oven. I cannot keep this in the house... and the neighbors that have the pecan trees love it too. I am going to take some to the pecan factory and let the ladies there taste them and see what they think.

Loved this recipe.  I did reduce the white sugar by about 1/4 of a cup and added that amount of brown sugar. For a nice crunch to salads, chop a few into small pieces - yummy!

Took these to a holiday party. They were the first things to get eaten! I took one of the reviewers suggestions and did 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar with 3 T of real maple syrup.  So easy and delicious!

We absolutely loved this recipe! My daughter ate them up! And she doesn't like pecans. But it's a fantastic way to use all the pecans we have, as we have huge pecan trees in my yard. I already have people asking for the recipe. I substituted a quarter cup of brown sugar for a quarter cup of white sugar. So I used half a cup white, and a quarter brown. But it was delicious!!!!

My husband brought home a ton of pecans from work and this recipe was totally worth the hours spent shelling them! I added the vanilla extract and the extra sugar and cinnamon like the other reviews said. They turned out perfect. I'll be giving these for Christmas gifts.

My stepmom who hates pecans actually likes this and my buddies grandpa is almost one hundred years old and has Alzheimers and hardly eats anything. But I brought some of the first batch I made down there and he loved them. I'm making my second batch now to bring down there for him. Thanks for the recipe man.

to make this Paleo friendly, change the sugar to 1/2 cup maple syrup OR honey.  I don't add salt either.  VERY yummy snack to have on hand.  Goes GREAT in salads too.

Funny, I don't like pecans.  For some reason I found myself eating these by the handful.  The difference between this recipe and others is absolutely the salt.  I LOVE the combination of sweet and salty.

I have been making these for years.  Over time I have added more cinnamon and vanilla just to suit our tastes but the recipe is quite good as it is.  Our local nut house starts selling fresh pecans in November each year and starting in October family begins requesting this.  They are also a great holiday gift as they keep well and are addictive.  lol

These are yummy. I used Saigon cinnamon and fresh-from-the-Pike-Street-Market Chinese 5-spice. Definitely delicious. I just finished reading all the reviews and variations and can't wait to try them again with those ideas. This is definitely going to be a staple and will be part of my Christmas packages.

I doubled the amount of cinnamon called for and the nuts tasted good, but I felt there was something missing that would make them amazing. Next time I'll add nutmeg and allspice to see if that amps up the flavour.

I have made this twice now.  The first time I used half splenda and half sugar.  It was awesome!  The second time I used all splenda and its still delicious!  It doesn't have the sugary coating on the outside so much but the taste is fantastic and the family loves it!

I make this at Christmas time. I usually use 1 cup of sugar to a pound of pecans, and I always have to double or triple the recipe. I've been giving these away a few years in a row, and I always get asked for them again and again. Love love LOVE these.

These are fantastic and very easy. I followed the recipe once and a second time I added 1/2tsp vanilla to sugar mix-I had to work it in until it was incorporated. I also tried adding it to the egg whites but the vanilla flavor was better when mixed with the sugare mix. No matter, the base recipe is very good and well worth it. They do not stick around long! My mother-in-law doesn't really cook anymore but she wanted this recipe to make for gifts. So easy!!! One more thing, I used parchment paper for easy stirring and clean up.

There are no words to describe how good this is.  The sweet/slightly salty/light delicate crunch of the pecan became like crack to me.  I couldn't stop myself from devouring this stuff by the handful.  I ended up giving half of it away so that I didn't eat too much.  Go make this NOW!

Great recipe!    I also used brown sugar and vanilla and extra cinnamon.   The only thing I will change is the salt.  I will also use less salt next time as I like mine more sweet than salty.  My house smells wonderful.  This will make excellent gifts for Christmas!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this with splenda rather than sugar. They taste great but are VERY sweet, I could only eat a handful which is good for someone watching their calorie intake :)

I made this for the first time at Christmas - WOW. My husband and I could hardly stop snacking on them - it replaced popcorn for a while when we would watch movies! It was also a big hit at work. I experimented some with the spices, adding more, subtracting here and there, trying others, etc - always turned out wonderfully!

I doubled the cinnamon in this recipe, and while I though that the nuts were good, I didn't think they were sweet enough, not for the effort you put into baking them.

I cannot say enough about this recipe! Perfect the way it is! I make this and put in cute jars to give at Christmas. I've also used Splenda instead of sugar...coating isn't as thick, but it's a great alternative for a diabetic. Everyone thinks I'm a wonderful cook when I make these...they have no idea how easy this is! This recipe is better than any sugared pecans you can purchase. A fool-proof recipe!

YUM! I didnt have any pecans so i uded walnuts instead. These were sweet and salty just as I was hoping. My boyfriend tried them and said he didn't like it at first, then continued to eat the entire batch. Next time I will use pecans, and I know they will be so much better.

These were so good!  I had some pecans to use up from making gifts for Christmas, so I made these.  I could eat the whole batch in one sitting!  So easy too!  My 2-year-old helped me make them.

Made these for Christmas and I'm still hearing praise about this recipe! Took the tip on using 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. These snacks are an instant hit!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I added 2 T melted butter and tripled the cinnamon; they were wonderful!  I actually used them as a topping for a "yogurt bar" at a baby shower, but people munched on them the entire time.  Rave reviews all around.

This was really good. I received a huge box of pecans for Christmas and didn't know what I was going to do with them, so I made this recipe. I couldn't stop eating them. I know all those pecans are going to go quickly. Thanks for sharing.

These were okay.  Not quite what I had expected due to the rave reviews on here.  I guess I was expecting more of the flavor of the cinnamon roasted pecans that come from the fair.  These were just "candied" pecans.  The flavor was lacking something... perhaps butter, and they had a very strong vanilla flavor.  Co-workers and friends gobbled them up though so I can't give 3 stars.

O.K. I was exited about making these after reading all the rave reviews. I must say, I was slightly disappointed. They were good, but not all that everyone made them out to be. I was expecting them to be wonderful and they were just ok. If I make them again I will play with the recipe. Definitely more cinnamon, maybe some butter and vanilla.

These were great! I didn't write down the recipe and I accidently doubled the cinnamon but they were still perfect. I made them for Thanksgiving and they were the first to go. Now I'm making them for Christmas and some extra to give away in goodie bags for my co-workers. Simple and easy yet wonderful. I'd recommend them to anyone.

Great as is but I like more flavor so I added 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp allspice. I think next time I will add more sugar. It wasn't quite sweet enough for me, but it didn't stop me from devouring them up. I didn't have any parchment paper on hand as one viewer suggested so I just used my teflon cookie sheet. Clean up was a breeze. Quick & easy recipe. Thanks

Yes, these are addictive! Very easy to whip up a couple of batches. We added a little brown sugar to the mixture.  They are crispy and lightly sweet.  They made a great Christmas gift for the neighbors!

so easy, so delicious, and everyone at the christmas party wanted to know how to make them.  For party favors: I used meat packaging paper and decorated the outside with stamps and cone shaped the paper holding it with tape- I filled it with this pecan snack, tied a ribbon and waalah! instant gift!
