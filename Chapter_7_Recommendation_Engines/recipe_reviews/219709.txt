I love making Challah in different shapes and different styles of braids, so of course this recipe caught my eye.  I never realized how easy it is to form a Star of David!  This dough was relatively easy to work with, but I think it needs a little more yeast, perhaps an extra 1/2 teaspoon, as the dough didn't rise as well as I thought it should and the bread was a little heavy.  That didn't stop us from devouring the entire thing as soon as it was cool enough to eat, though!  Thanks for an awesome new way to shape Challah bread.

I made it into Eggnog Challah for a Christmukkah gathering. I subbed eggnog for the water, and added a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg. The eggnog flavor was almost too subtle; I think I should've added either 1 ounce rum or 1/2 tsp rum extract too. I mixed everything in my stand mixer for about 8 minutes, then added 2 Tbsp room temp butter, for richness, and mixed for another 2 minutes. I gave it a first rise, then punched it down and shaped it as directed. Brushed with egg wash and sprinkled with pearl sugar. Fun recipe!
