Good recipe, but I made a few changes - cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, added a small diced green bell pepper and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also used fresh green beans that I cut in small pieces and boiled 2-3 minutes, then rinsed in cold water. You can also use chick peas instead of yellow beans. Let marinate overnight and mix a few times during this time. Bon appétit!

I have made this recipe several times now to raves.  Yes, this is a sweet version, however, like any marinade, it's not meant to be eaten really. I serve mine with a slotted spoon, that way, you're not consuming all of this marinade with the salad, and you won't lose any flavor because the salad has been marinated.  Try it, you'll like it better served this way.

It was a good basic recipe, although I made slight changes.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Also used butter beans and garbanzo beans in place of kidney beans and it turned out great.

I like the concept, and was hoping to like this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding an extra can of drained & rinsed garbanzo beans and cutting down the sugar to 1/4 cup based on other reviews, but it was still WAY TOO SWEET for everyone in my family. We all thought the sweetness  ruined the dish, and I had to pour out the liquid in the bottom of the bowl and douse it with more vinegar before serving to even make it edible. If you don't like sweet side salads you definitely will not like this recipe. I'd recommend skipping the sugar while making it entirely and adding a small amount an hour or so before serving if you think it needs it - you can always add more, but you can't take it out once it's there.

Just the way I remember three-bean salad!  I made this for my British husband who had never heard of this classic American salad, and he LOVED it!  I added more salt and pepper and substituted garbanzo beans for the wax beans.  Yum!  Perfect for bringing on our camping trip.  Thanks Eleanor!

Become one of my staples for summer picnics since it is a great salad with no mayo. I usually only use 1/3 cup of sugar

Hands down the best bean salad dressing I’ve ever made or had, and have made it too many times to count.  I’ve made it many times exactly as written (5 stars), and have recently started cutting back a little in the sugar (still 5 stars).  I also now add seasoned pepper.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The beauty of this salad is that nearly all ingredients can be kept on the shelf until you need them, so you can whip this up whenever you need it. Add a can of drained shoepeg white or yellow kernel corn, dark red and light red kidney beans, yellow wax beans and green beans, and use a red onion - we call it calico bean salad because it is so colorful.  Don't be afraid of the sugar unless you plan to drink the marinade - it gets dissolved in the liquid the beans retain, and the marinade is drained when the salad is served.  It tastes better after a day or two in the fridge.  The onions mellow out in the marinade.  Try adding red or green pepper strips as others have suggested.  This is a delicous make-ahead salad for buffets - or just every day.  My husband asks for this frequently - (I do cut the sugar to 1/2 cup or half sugar, half Splenda).

This salad is great. I was a little skeptical about all the sugar, but added more vinegar and it was wonderful. I also used celery salt instead of celery seed, and added slices of pickled spicy garlic. Boyfriend loved it too.

Surprisingly good!.   I use only 1/3 cup sugar and 1/4 cup oil and it turned out great.   I have made this 3 times in the last month since it is so easy, healthy and tasty.

Great recipe.  I've made it using the variety of beans called for in the recipe, but have also made it with just green beans because they are our favorite.  I prefer to use a red onion and since we have a diabetic in our home, I've made it with splenda too.  Turned out just as good.  I just replaced the sugar with the exact same amount of granulated splenda and it worked like a charm.  This works as a side dish or salad for so many different main dishes.  It's also just great to have on hand for a quick and healthy snack.  Definitely a keeper.

I've been looking for a bean salad recipe that would be close to what I get every friday at a local market.  With a minor modification, this takes just like it.  Let this marinade for about 2 days to get the full flavors of the onion to come out.  I added more vinegar and suggest to cut the sugar in this recipe otherwise way too sweet.  Pour on top of romaine lettuce and sprinkle with feta.

Yummy! The only things I changed were adding garbanzo beans instead of wax beans because I had them on hand and adding a can of drained artichoke hearts. The marinade is delicious! Not too sweet or too tangy! Thanks for posting!

Amazing! My family and friends loved this. The recipe calls for a whole onion, but it really only needed 1/2 an onion. Also, would recommend mixing all of the liquid ingredients before tossing in the beans.

I'm the only family member still living that loves this. It was a holiday dinner staple when I was growing up in the Midwest.  I always asked my mom & grandmas for the recipe but they just said they, "threw it together." They've all passed and I was almost brought to tears upon finding this recipe.  THANK YOU!

This salad was very good, but a little too sweet. I loved the addition of celery seeds it made it taste very good. It's a good make ahead recipe. You can substitute the beans for any canned beans you have on hand. Great picnic salad and gets better as it sits.

We love to keep this salad in the fridge for munching.  I get the green and wax beans locally, clean them up, trim the ends, cut into 2 inch pieces, then blanch for 3 minutes in boiling water.  While I do love the sweetness, I also cut the sugar down, just to hamper my "sweet veggie" guilt.  This is a perfect recipe to keep around and pull out at a moment's notice.

This may be the easiest and most welcome recipe at a large dinner. With all the sweets and fancy foods on hand, everyone was ready for a bite of this wonderful bean salad. My kids liked it very much. If your children like beans and pickled foods they will eat this up.

12.29.17  Haven’t made three bean salad in years, and we used to live on it when first married...for two people, it lasted a while!  Actually, I think I lost my original recipe, so was happy to see this on the AR site.  I did make a few changes.  I used Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar (I know, sounds pretty fancy for a bean salad and I sure didn’t use that when first married!) instead of the milder white viinegar, used Splenda® instead of sugar (cut that back to 1/2 cup), and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup.  This was like a blast-from-the past, and I found myself eating it out of the mixing bowl, but eventually, I did put it in the fridge overnight for the flavors to meld.  This was so tasty, and I’ve saved this in my Favorites, so it won’t be lost again.

Been making this salad for years. I don't use celery seed but might try once I get some. I like it with canned green beans canned yellow beans can of red kidney beans and a can of chick peas. I love red onion so I cut it up small to get some with every bite. Some find it sweet so adjust to your own taste.... I like it sweet and find this salad gets better and better the longer it sits. Sometimes if there is some left over from a bbq I will add some bowtie pasta to it and let it sit overnight in the fridge for a whole new salad the next day

Easy easy easy! I used canola oil instead, cut sugar back a bit, added chickpeas and thin sliced celery instead of celery seed. I put in a large ziploc bag and let it marinate all day turning the bag over every few hours. Everyone loves, and I mean LOVES this bean salad every time I make it and any leftovers just get better and better by the day. This is now my favourite thing to make if someone ever asks me "Can you bring a salad or something?"

I would have named this SWEET three bean salad.   The spices were good, but it was too sweet and not vinegary enough for me.  Second time I reduced sugar to 1/4 C and gave an extra splash of vinegar.  This helped a lot.

This was EXACTLY my granny's three bean salad recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing it.  I took a big bite and instantly was about 8 years old sitting at her dining room table.

This recipe tastes just like my mother-in-law's, which is what I was looking for. I agree that it's a bit sweet, but you can easily reduce the sugar, and it's still good.

This is one of my family's favorite classic salads. I made mine on a Friday for a Sunday get together. 
I added some fresh onion the day it was served for the crunch and bite as the original onions had pickled. Absolutely delicious.

Really excellent.  I don't use white sugar so I sweetened with honey, to my taste.  Threw in a can of corn, too.  Made lots for our strawberry and soft crab fest!

The perfect recipe for traditional sweet and tangy three bean salad. Having read the reviews I added the sugar a little at a time, tasting in between -- and ended up using it all.

This is absolutely delicious!  I have made this with the follwing changes:  only use 1/3 c sugar since I don't like it really sweet but it still has some hint of the sugar; use the beans as called for in the recipe and add garbanzo beans and cut artichoke hearts (in water); recently also added canned black beans - very good.  There is enough liquid that you don't need to alter it when you add the additional items.

Quick. Good.   I read the other reviews first.  I went w/ dark red kidney beans, green beans and garbanzo beans; I also used red onion and had some fresh parsley on hand, so I tossed it in.  Used "fine" red vine vinegar and EVOO. S&P to taste.   After reading the reviews, I did not add the sugar immediately--I added to taste as well.      . . .3/4 c of sugar seemed overwhelming.   Do not know how much I ultimately used, but can say it wasn't  near 3/4 c.  Missing a little bite that I guess I was used to growing up with this dish.  Next time I'll  try this recipe w/ apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar for more bite.

Edit: Made this again tonight with a can of mixed beans, thinly sliced baby carrots, finely chopped jalapeno pepper, frozen peas, yellow onion, parsley and cider vinegar. YUM! 

Excellent recipe to jump off from! All I had in my kitchen (literally) was a bag of Bob's Red Mill 13 Bean Soup Mix, a red onion, honey, olive oil and vinegar. I cooked the beans with salt and garlic powder and while they were still warm I mixed them with the olive oil, honey, and some zinfandel vinegar from Sonoma Lake Winery. Then I added the sliced red onion. I also included the s&p and celery seed which added a great flavor. The honey instead of sugar was very good and healthier! I'm saving this recipe and will definitely make it again, even with the 13 bean mix - though next time I might pick out the lentils to give the finished product a cleaner appearance. Use any beans you like for this recipe, and as many different types, it doesn't have to just be 3. Delicious!

This recipes is ok.  We did things a little differently after reading the reviews and it came out the way we wanted.  We only used 1/4 Cup of Sugar, 1/2 Cup of Vinegar and 1/8 Cup Olive Oil.  We also used Green Onion instead of regular onion.  Also, with this recipe you can basically use any type of beans you want; in my opinion.

It's hard to imagine how this recipe could be improved upon. It is fantastic and quite flexible in that a variety of  beans can be used. The marinade is spectacular, but obviously only if you enjoy a sweet salad. I did use Splenda in place of sugar and will probably reduce it to 1/4 to 1/2 next time; it was plenty sweet. I prefer diced onions to rings, so that's how I rolled on this recipe, but I loved it and will make this a staple for future healthy eating. Beans, beans, beans!

The best and easiest bean salad ever.  I added garbanzo beans and reduced sugar to 1/3 cup.  I also changed fresh wax beans to canned wax beans because the fresh ones would not soften even after 24 hours.  My husband loves it and I have made it several times.  Great for buffets.

Very close to what my Mom used to make when I was a kid. We never put in celery seed, and used much less sugar ( maybe 1/3 C.)  We prefer the vinegar flavor over the sweetness. Thanks for posting this. Only one problem - have to wait 12 - 24 hours to enjoy!!!

Made this again today, 7/13/18. I used Splenda instead of sugar, per usual, due to some with diabetes. Only 1/3 C Splenda, and added black beans, and an extra can of waxed beans! It is hard waiting for the flavors to meld! Always better day two or three!

I've made this a few times and it's delicious!! I always use the same amount of sugar, vinegar and seasonings etc., but will sometimes use different types of beans depending what I have in the house. I've even added corn before and it's delicious too!

This is my first time making three bean salad, I always hated the canned stuff! But this recipe is great! I used 1/2 c sugar instead of 3/4 c and omitted the salt and celery seed and used some celery salt instead. Everyone loved it! Thanks!

I tried this with chickpeas instead of wax beans and I think next time I would prefer wax beans instead. Also, the sugar needs to REALLY be cut down to 1/4 cup. Salt and celery seed should both be upped to 1 whole teaspoon in my opinion. And I will try it with only vegetable oil next time instead of substituting olive oil to see how that makes it taste. But with these changes it's good.

Try adding 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1/2 half of a green pepper, diced, and/or 1 jalapeno pepper, minced (seeds removed) to add even more flavor!

This was really good. I did use garbanzo beans in place of the wax beans since that was what I had. Also after reading some of the reviews I decided to cut the sugar to a 1/2 cup. It was sweet enough for us. That is the nice thing about most recipes...you can alter them to your liking.  And that's o.k. because we all have different tastes.

You can substitute honey for the processed sugar.  It only takes 1/2 as much to give the same amount of sweetness.

Very good stuff!  I used 1/2 c. sugar instead of 3/4 c.  I also cut down the oil.  I used about 2 T of olive oil and it tastes great, even though I have not put it in the fridge overnight yet!  mmmmmmmmm  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I substituted a can of black beans for the wax beans and used 1/2 of sugar. Next time I would use still less sugar.

Excellent summer food for when it's too hot to cook baked beans and when you would like a change from potato salad or cole slaw. And nothing could be simpler to assemble.

This recipe is a good example of why I always read the reviews. Half of the sugar is perfect! Nice balance of flavors, and so versatile. I use whatever beans I have on hand, and it turns out great every time. I also dice the onions. A solid 4.

I did change it just a little but this was a huge success at the party. I used a can of green beans, a can of wax beans, a can of kidney beans, and added a can of garbanzo. I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Other than adding the garbanzo and decreasing the sugar,  I followed the recipe.  You could omit the onions, which I have done and it is great with or without. Can’t go wrong with this recipe.

This is delicious- if you cut the sugar to 1/2 C. and add a big splash of apple Cider Vinegar AND let it set for a day....I didn't like it very well at first but let it set overnight and its delicious! I also added a pint of garbanzo beans.....

Three bean salad is a favorite of ours. We liked this recipe, but found it to be a little too sweet. I will definately make it again, but I'll cut the amount of sugar I use.

I make this bean salad all the time. This is the same recipe my mother made 40 years ago. It is a great salad to take to a pot luck as it feeds a lot of people. Always have great compliments on this dish. I don't change anything in this recipe.

Shades of my mom's favorite. We grew up with this, and it's the first time I' very made it in years. Sweet & sour marinades are an individual flavor choice and this is a bit sweet for my crew. Definitely less sugar next time.  Another suggestion from my own experience for a different twist: we used to occasionally add shoestring cut cooked beets to this bean mix, let it marinate overnight, drain it and add a spoonful of plain yogurt.

The celery seed made this. I opted for red onion and doubled the vinegar because of the overwhelming sweetness (hence the 3 stars). Next time will cut the sugar to 1/4 c., sub with agave and use apple cider vinegar.

Delicious and easy. I added half of a red pepper and used half of a red onion, plus a can of cannellini white beans, so I guess it's a 4-bean salad. I also substituted olive oil instead of vegetable oil, a few squirts of stevia liquid instead of sugar and it's a perfect blend of tangy and slightly sweet. I tasted it and it's great and it will sit overnight in the fridge before I take it to a potluck tomorrow.

I use kidney, pinto and black beans along with snap peas and/or green beans. I even put in garlic scapes for a little extra kick.  Love the onions!  I cannot have sodium so I simply leave out the salt and put a little extra celery seed.  Don't even miss the salt!  My kids even ate it!  Yummy, Thanks

I found this to be very easy and tasty. It's better if you make it the day before so the flavors can come together.

I liked the fact that this recipe wasn't too vinegary, but I found it too sweet; I would definitely use less sugar (half) less time. I used diced celery in place of the seed, and it added a really nice crunch that lasted. Thanks!

This is a great salad.  I don't like Yellow beans so I used chic peas.  My daughter said it was her new favorite salad !!  Next time I make it I will add a little more vinegar, salt and pepper, and cut back on the sugar.  I love sugar, but I thought this was a little overpowering in this recipe.

This is just your basic no frills three bean salad recipe, but, was very tasty!   Based on the other reviews I started out with 1/2 cup of sugar, tasted it, and ended up adding the additional 1/4 cup to use the entire amount the recipe called for.  The only changes I made were to add 1/2 chopped green pepper and cider vinegar since that is what I had in the house.  Very easy and flavorful recipe!

This is just what I was looking for. It has served as side dishes for meals and a snack at work. It is packed with fiber and is filling and the taste...out of this world. I did change some things, I used canned wax beans, green beans and butter beans. Nothing that would of changed the taste of the dressing. Thanks for sharing, will be great for all my summer parties!

Very good recipe but too much dressing for our taste and a little too sweet.  Followed the recipe exactly except that I added 2 cans of green beans.  Next time I will decrease the entire dressing ingredients and the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Otherwise delicious!

Good recipe.  First time I made a salad like this... Good for potlucks where you have vegetarians.  I made it as a side for thanksgiving.  Read the other reviews, decreased the sugar to 1/2cup, added one can garbanzo beans, one can black beans, and did NOT increase the other ingredients, and it was a great 5 bean salad... not having had this salad before, I can only go by what my family and friends said, and what I tasted ofcourse!  One tip I still need... could not find anyone who knew what wax beans are... I ended up using canepelli beans? I am not sure what the can is supposed to read in the recipe, but the grocery store did not have a can of "wax beans".  Suggestions?  What I liked best?  Makes a lot, costs little, and almost no work at all.  Also, I used apple cider vinegar instead of distilled because I needed that for the cranberry chutney I recipe and did not want to buy both.  Worked great.

i leave out the celery seed.  add diced green pepper, about a quarter cup to a single recipe.  the same amount as the onion.  never serve this without the recipe printed out, you will be asked for it.  taste to see if you want a little more sugar.

I used 1/2 cup sugar and added a can of chickpeas, as suggested, and it was almost perfect.  The only change I would make is to use less onion as the onion flavor was a bit strong.

I love onions, but make sure that it's a small onion. A large onion is just too much for the proportion of other veggies. Also, I added garbanzo beans (chickpeas), like my mom used to. Tasty way to get added fiber and veggies, especially once you're burnt out on traditional salad!

I used green beans and kidney beans as the beans were fresh from the garden.  I was greedy even though I knew better.  I tried the salad after 24 hours and really did not like it.   I waited for 5 days and let it marinate and it was wonderful.  So don't be greedy like me  and taste too soon.  Plan on making it 5 days before eating the salad.  Probably could eat in 3 days but 5 days were good.  In 5 days you are going to need a vegetable or salad anyway and this salad will be ready.

I made this and I should have listened to the people who wrote the same comment - leave out the sugar. It doesn't add anything to the recipe, and it actually tastes a little odd with it. Also, it could use something else, but I don't know what - adobo? garlic salt? Just a little something else would help. Still, it's great for a barbeque when 60 people are coming over.

I followed the recipe and loved it. The sweetness brings out the flavors. We use it as a green salad topping, drained most often. But it’s a great evening snack for that sweet tooth.

I made this with avacado oil, white balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup of coconut sugar.  I added my new favorite ingredient: sweety drop peppers, which look pretty, but are also sweet and spicy.  I love the celery seed in this recipe; adds a nice dimension.

Great traditional recipe.  I added one can of garbanzo beans.
Because we have a diabetic in the family, I substituted Splenda for the sugar and I couldn't tell the difference.
I don't care for celery seed, so I did omit that.

A great salad. I went with the original recipe with the following additions and changes. Instead of white vinegar, I mixed half cider vinegar and half balsamic vinegar.  Added 1 tsp brown and yellow mustard seed, and a dash of ground cinnamon. I believe this salad is more like bread and butter pickles, therefore meant to be sweeter. I'll follow the original recipe next time, but will always use cider vinegar; less acidic.

Just what I was looking for - simple and fool-proof! I substituted bell peppers for the onion, since I'm not a fan of onion, and the flavor and colors were a good complement.

Used my Pampered Chef Spiralizer for onion (with blade).  Did not add as much onion as called for, it just seemed like too much.  Easy to make.  But directions do not specify whether to drain all cans.  I did.  I used canned wax beans. Also, I didn't have celery seed so I used 2 tablespoons of finely minced fresh celery.

I make this up all summer long...and I have some in my fridge even now, as cold as it is.
I add a can of black beans, a can of garbanzos, about 1/2 cup of chopped celery and 1/2 cup chopped carrots.
I also do different proportions for the sweet and sour since I don't care for so much sugar.  I  use 1/4 c honey, 1/2 c vegetable oil and 1 1/4 c apple cider vinegar.  Increase the celery seed to 1 teaspoon, the same for the salt.  I use red onion, milder than white or yellow.  Makes about 3 quarts.

As I use up the salad solids, I reserve the liquid in a quart canning jar.  I partially drain a can of sliced beets and put those into the leftover liquid.  After soaking for two days, the beets are nicely pickled and ready to be used in salads or on their own.

Really good dressing for this salad! Doubled the whole recipe and took it for a pot luck. Believe it or not, the store was out of wax beans - so I used Butter Beans & got a bunch of compliments. Also used cider vinegar and avocado oil instead of distilled vinegar and vegetable oil.

Followed recipe exactly. Just a little sweet so I added a little more vinegar. Very tasty. Definitely make it again but cut the sugar just a little.

I start with this, add garbanzos, dark red and light red kidney beans, omit wax beans [I'm NOT a fan], throw in a half a chopped red pepper [and a little red pepper in the dressing] and it's great!

Pretty much as I remember.  I made it as it was written but ended up having to add more vinegar.  It was WAY too sweet.
Made it a second time and tweaked the dressing..I used 2/3 cup vinegar,  1/2cup sugar and 1/3 cup oil.  I used red onion this time and liked that better, too.  My family really likes this salad and it's so handy to keep around in summer, it makes a great snack when you're hungry for a little something!

Easy, fast and delicious. Have made it several times and added to taste profile with a little garlic powder and dill weed. Can also add a bit diced green or red peppers if you have some and I use sliced red onions. Make sure to let it stand for at least several hours to develop the flavors.

I use baby cilantro instead of parsley - absolutely delicious. And Newman's Own parmesan & roasted garlic dressing is perfect for the vinaigrette.

The only changes I made was more green beans than wax (what I had on hand) and I halved the onion due to personal taste.

I made a minestrone soup and had leftover canned red kidney beans and green beans. This recipe came in handy to use those up. I did not have wax beans on hand to add. I cut the recipe in half, and it worked great with the amounts that I had. I cut back on the sugar just a little. Nice recipe - thanks!

I made it with fresh green and wax beans.  My husband liked it more when it was first made because the flavors were more individualized.  I thought it was  better  the longer it sat.

This is soooo much better than that stuff in a can, and I'll be making this again. It makes so much that it's going to my next pot luck dinner too. I did make some miner changes based on reviews. I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup, used canola oil, and added 1 cup frozen corn (thawed) and 1 can drained & rinsed cannellini beans (or garbanzo beans).  I figure that this will serve 30 (1/2 cup each), so be sure to use a large bowl with room to stir every so often.

Cut the oil way down (2 Tbsp), but used all the sugar and vinegar. May try balsamic vinegar or rice vinegar per suggestions next time.  Used black, garbanzo, kidney, and green beans, red and white onion, and red pepper diced.  Maybe next time some corn. Soooo simple and just great!!! (Plus, the protein and the fiber are added bonuses from my perspective).

My favorite salad recipe on Allrecipes.com. Easy and fast to make and easy to modify with a variety of bean choices available. Crunch and sweetness/tartness easy to influence if one starts off with bulk beans rather than the canned varieties.

I used 3 cans of Read 3 Bean Salad and just mixed the onion and vegetable  oil. Subbed rice wine for the vinegar. Quick and easy in a pinch.

Delicious!  IVe made it twice.  Once according to the recipe  and once with leftover green and wax beans.  I used both red wine vinegar and white distilled vinegar.  I did cut down the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup since we don't like things sweet.  Overall a great recipe.

It was good, but not great. I didn't add nearly the same amount of onions as the recipe called for and there was way too much dressing - I only used about 1/2. I would make it again, but nothing to write home about.

Very good and very simple salad. It is quite sweet and to counter this, I add about 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar. I like the flavor the balsamic adds and it cuts the sweetness just the right amount for our taste. It's a nice salad as is or can be varied with the addition of garbanzo beans, thinly sliced onions and thinly sliced garlic.

Great recipe. Made as directed the first time and our family gave it a five star. I cut the sweetener to 1/2 cup. I add red, yellow and or green peppers, whatever I have on hand. I also add one or two cloves of garlic and not salt at all. It is wonder and a staple at our house.

This was the first time I've made a 3-bean salad, & it was great. I also used half the amount of sugar called for, and would probably use only 1/4 cup next time. I also added chick peas to the mix to turn it into a 4-bean salad. Yummy!

I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this salad! This is the closest recipe I could find to the one that my mother-in-law makes. I don't add the celery seed, and I cut the sugar down to 1/4 a cup. I also add garbanzo beans, and a diced bell pepper. I brought this to the Easter potluck, and my friend who manages a bakery and cafe took the rest home with her.

This salad was 'okay'.  I left out the onions, and threw in some artichoke hearts.  This recipe just tasted like something was missing though....  But I can't put my finger on it.  I think it needs some extra mustard seed or something...

I gave this recipe five stars because I made this for my parent and they loved it.  I thought it was just okay, really kind of sweet and I used less sugar then called for. For myself I wouldn't make it but like I said the family really liked it. I would only make it for them.

This was the absolutly best tasting 3 bean salad.  It's better than any salad bar could have.  I added garbanzo and great northern to make it a five bean salad. The marinade was perfect. I used canned wax beans.  You have to let it sit for about 2 days for everything to marinate.  Fantastic!!

I LOVED this recipe.  i read the reviews and was going to modify the recipe but decided to try it first and then see.  I am so glad I didn't.  It was great!  Tangy sweet.  Simply perfect.  Thank you for this !!

Eleanor?  I prepared exactly from beginning to end.  I didn't add any extra ingredients or leave any out.  What a wonderful recipe.  Now I don't have to wait to enjoy this from a salad bar.  I have my very own recipe thanks to you.  5 Star YUMS!

This was really good and very easy to make!  I will be making this from now on, and will never buy the canned stuff again.

Very easy and delicious.  Made this several times, and each time tried different beans.  Good solid recipe.

I wasn't a big fan of this recipe. I felt that there was way to much dressing with the vinegar being rather overpowering. I might make this again and try cutting the dressing in half.

Very good.  Used 1 can waxed beans instead of 1 pound.  Also, substituted Splenda for sugar and reduced that to 1/2 cup.  It is still a bit sweet, so next time will reduce it to 1/3 cup.  Used only 1/2 of a large sweet onion and substituted celery salt for the regular salt and eliminated the celery seeds.

Just like my dad used to make, though I added a 7 3/4 can of garbonzo beans and held off on the onions.  Great BBQ side dish!
