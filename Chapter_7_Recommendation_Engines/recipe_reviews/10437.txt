I omitted the cherries, walnuts, and coconut. I thought they were delicious but I will use a little less powdered sugar next time.

I placed the peanut butter mixture in the freezer and let it solidify.  I used a Tbsp scoop to form the balls, then used chopsticks to dip them in the chocolate.  This made it easy and minimized the mess.

this recipe is just awesome, I cant keep them long enough on the tray!  Usually my son doesnt like sweet stuff but he always wants one of these.
They are rich but very good, also looks very professional so great for bake sales too.

When I make this I make it X4 (big family), so I added one less cup of confectioners sugar and they were just right. I made the balls bigger then what the recipe called (about the size of a small plum). and I added a bit more cherries and less walnuts and they were just awesome

Our family loves this recipe! My sister-in-law has made it a family tradition. Last year, we weren't able to get together so I was very excited to find this recipe so I could make them on my own!   I do NOT like cherries, but they are chopped and add just a hint of flavor. It sounds crazy to add all these different flavors together, but it is oh so delicious! You can make a batch and keep them in the freezer and just pull them out a couple hours before needed! Yummy goodness!

Very tasty and presentable! i didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted raisins for the maraschino cherries and I used a mix of almond/hazelnut butter with a few tablespoons of peanut butter (as I didn't have enough pb!). Made it for my son and his friend but it ended up pleasing the adults even more!

Wonderful recipe.  I didn't have cherries so substituted raisins.  I'm going to try them again today with craisins.  Also, for half the batch, I dipped just one side of the ball in chocolate and coconut.  Made for a nice varied appearance and decreased the richness slightly. I'm going to try half in white chocolate today.

These are fantastic! Ingredients can easily be omitted or added depending on your mood, taste, or whatever you have on hand. I ate my small trial batch myself. It's not overly peanut buttery which is excellent because I don't like an overload of peanut butter. I'll definitely make, experiment, and share this recipe. Thank you!

The walnuts, and cherries make this great!  I usually only use PB, powder sugar, and butter but, these are a nice treat.  The only thing I had trouble with was tooth picks do not stick in them to dip into the chocolate.  I ended up using a spoon and my fingers - yeah it was messy....  :-)

Way too sweet, if I try them again I will reduce the 2 cups confectioners' sugar to maybe 1 1/4 cups. Irene

I made a big mistake and mixed the chocolate chips in with the other ingredients - oops! It was too late to fix it, so I decided to microwave the whole works for 90 seconds to melt the chocolate, then I mixed it all together. That seemed to work and I was able to roll it into balls and dip them in the coconut. 

I'll have to try the recipe properly another time, I'm sure it would be much better, but they are yummy this way too!

This recipe was a big hit at our Christmas party.  Don't omit the cherries.  We have lots of family that don't like fruit in their desserts, but they all loved these.

It has been a tradition of mine to make these at Christmas time.  When I give them as gifts, I get rave reviews.  I do not roll in coconut, since the coconut in the mixture is plenty.  I do still dip in chocolate.  These surprise filled peanut butter balls are a  perfect confection of love.

I had a recipe for peanut butter balls that got misplaced so I of course looked here for a similar one. The original used only butter, peanut butter and confectionery sugar if I recall correctly (and chocolate for dipping). However, coconut and maraschino cherries are two of my favorite things so I made this recipe. Ended up using a full stick of butter in order to blend everything. I agree they are too sweet and If I make these again I'll omit the cherries also. These were fine to hand out along with other things I'd made for Christmas but not all that impressed.

These are delicious!!!  My grandmother used to fill her freezer full of these cookies during Christmas, so I love them all the more because they remind me of her.
