The flavor was okay with this recipe, but it turned out really greasy.

My husband hates chicken parts - he eats only breast. But he does like them if they are crispy. And this recipe made sure that the fried chicken turned out crispy! I even used the leftover buttermilk in my mashed potatoes. Nice meal!

Unbelievable. This is just like my grandmother's fried chicken. I could eat this everyday.
