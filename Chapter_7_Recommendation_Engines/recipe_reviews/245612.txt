Delicious! I increased the Maesri red curry paste to about 3 tbl. and after returning the chicken thighs to the skillet, I added baby carrots, green beans, and sliced red pepper, and continued simmering for 15-20 minutes. Served over Jasmine rice. Will make this again and again with different veggies. Yum!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and the flavors were fantastic. I was hoping for it to be a little spicier, next time I'll increase the curry paste to increase the heat. Excellent recipe, everyone that had it loved it.

I spent 21 days in India in 2016.  We ate curry every day.  So I have an authentic reference point.  This recipe is excellent.  I have made it 4 or 5 times.  Three times with chicken and once with lamb.  Either way the sauce is tongue clapping good.  After the first time I used 2 cans of coconut milk instead on one.  If you like saucy I recommend doing so.

This was a very easy recipe.  I happened to have all of the ingredients on hand.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I added a little habe√±ero powder to the mix to make it on the spicier side.  We enjoyed this and will probably make it regularly.  Thanks for sharing.

The sauce from this recipe came out great! Didn't have Chinese spice mix, substituted for 1 tsp cumin + 1tsp cloves. Seared chicken in 2 different pans because 8 chicken things was too crowded for 1. Definitely had better char in the cast iron skillet than stainless steel. After making the sauce and putting thighs back in the pans, I finished cooking in the oven at 400 for about 20 min. Served with coconut rice.

So good! I used a bit less hot curry powder after I felt like it was a bit strong. It ends up being a great curry. I also add slicec onions, potatoes, and carrots so I can eat the curry over rice.

This is excellent the way the recipe reads and I make it that way a lot.  But if you have extra stuff in your freezer you can add them.  I added chopped carotts, peas and 1 cup mashed sweet potatoes and shreaded the chicken thighs and served it over mashed potatoes.

The flavor was pungent, but not totally pleasing.  We typically love this type of food, but I won't be making this recipe again.

Used 16 thighs. Winged it for Garam Masala. Used candied ginger. Will definitely make it again. One suggestion - prep all ingredients before cooking the thighs.

I really liked this recipe. Great flavors and nice and spicy and creamy. I used skinless and boneless chicken thighs and instead of all grape seed oil I used one tablespoon grape seed and 2 of coconut oil. I also didn't have Chinese five spice so instead used a teaspoon of cinnamon. I'm looking forward to making It again with the 5 spice. It was still amazing. I also used light coconut milk. I served it over quinoa.. This is a keeper. Thanks!

Oh man. Delicious. I made a few changes to meet our family's particular tastes (namely not too hot). I used half the amount of "curry powder" to replace the hot curry powder (not sure what that is), low fat coconut milk, half the ginger, 2/3 the red curry paste, no sriracha, and replaced coconut oil instead of grape seed. 
Because I was cooking for our large group of 8, I skinned and fried all the thighs (10 min each side) on med high, placed them in a glass dish, and once they were all complete, I fried the garlic/spices/milk and poured it over the top of the chicken. I then cooked it all at 425 for 20 min to settle in the flavors. Wow was it good! The kids loved it (asking for thirds!) and it was well worth the amount of time it took to cook such a large amount.

This was amazing! I made a few modifications though: swapped the hot curry powder for regular; added two bell peppers; and omitted the fish sauce, sugar, and sriracha. It still had some heat it, but the jasmine rice helped calm it down a bit. Will definitely be making this in the future!

Delicious! I've never made anything like this before, so I had fun using all of my rarely used spices in the back of the spice cabinet, lol.  I did try to lighten this up a bit by taking the skin off of the thighs and using lite coconut milk. I think it worked out great! Oh, and I didn't have grapeseed oil, so I subbed coconut oil as suggested in the footnotes. This was very easy to put together, too. I will def be making this again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)
