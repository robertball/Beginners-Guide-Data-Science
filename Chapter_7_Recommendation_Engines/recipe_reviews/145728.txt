My stars should be higher! Only reason I gave it a 4 was because it was too much soy for my taste.  I also did as another reviewer and substituted may for coconut milk.  Redid another batch w/ half the soy sauce and doubled the (coconut for mayo) mixed both batches (too salty one) w/ remade one... awesome!  I used it as a topping to rice w. veggies AND as a dipping sauce w/ raw veggies.  I loved this and will be doing it again. It was so easy to make.  The longer its refrigerated the better

This is a winner, so thanks for sharing, Ashbeth.  I LOVE this as a dipping sauce for breaded chicken tenders or nuggets.  The other readers' suggestions were so interesting as well, especially the cayenne or red pepper flakes. I can't stop dipping sugar snap peas, celery & carrot sticks into this as my side for my beloved breaded chicken tenders.

Not sure where I went wrong - far too salty.  Equal parts peanut butter and soya sauce seems way out of proportion.

Mayo? Really? I subbed the Mayo with milk, because I was out of coconut milk. I upped the peanut butter and milk and mixed the sauce with vegetables for Thai lettuce wraps. Very good and easy.

I just put this in the fridge to chill, but I can't stop licking the bowl.  It is delicious!  So easy, and made with ingredients I had on hand.  I added 1/4 tsp Thai red curry powder, just to see how I'd like it--good and not overpowering.  I'll be eating this on everything!

Wow, this is really good! When I looked at the ingredient combination I really didn't know what to think? I used Skippy cream natural, mayo with olive oil, low sodium soy sauce, and followed everything else the same. I wish the recipe gave more ideas to dip in this. Delicious!

This was a perfect sauce for some salad rolls to encourage my kids to make their own healthy food and eat it.  My 3 year old did eat some salad roll but mostly used his finger to dip and eat this sauce.  I used plain yoghurt instead of the mayo, and cut the sugar to about a tbsp.  I would make this again.  It is runny, which was fine with me, but if you are expecting a more traditional thick dip you might want to thicken with something.

Very good, especially on red peppers,  Used lite coconut milk instead of mayo and lime juice as well as lemon.  Also added Siracha hot sauce for some kick.

This dip always brings requests for the recipe.  I make it a bit spicy by adding crushed red pepper flakes...more or less to suit your taste.  It is best to allow the flavors to marry for a couple of hours prior to serving.  So yummy!

I used half as much soy sauce (actually Bragg's Amino Acids - GF) based on other reviews.  Might even cut it a little more next time. Replaced mayo with coconut milk to make it vegan. Also used fresh lime juice instead of lemon since that's what I had on hand.  Processed in the Vitamix for an amazing texture. Delish!

I just made this &  had such high hopes.  I tasted after each ingredient was added--halved the soy/tamari sauce (see end note), and garlic was last.  It was nearly perfect until I added the garlic.  That made it taste so gross.  I was able to salvage it with the addition of quite a few other items, but if i make this again, i will omit the garlic & add a little Hot chili sesame oil.   As written, It is 3 stars for me. With my salvaging, it was 4-5 stars.    ***Also, to make it gluten-free,  I subbed tamari sauce for thr soy sauce.

This is different - and definitely better the second day. I added a shot of chili sauce for tang, and think if I'd ever made it again I would use half the amount of soy sauce and add more if needed.

This is a great recipe!!  I used it as a dipping sauce for my poke spring rolls and man it gave it that sweet and spicy flavor I was hoping for. We all loved it and can't wait to try it with chicken tenders and maybe toss wings in it too!!

Very easy to pull together and so delicious! I had it with garlic chicken spring rolls, but it is so versatile. Could be served over pasta, with chicken tenders or as a veggie dip. Only added a few pinches of cayenne pepper, and used Miracle Whip in place of the mayo and it worked great. UPDATE 5/15: Added to angel hair pasta (with a little pasta water to make a creamy sauce), sauteed veggies (onions, mushrooms,  broccoli, summer squash). Topped with sea salt, cracked black pepper, red pepper flakes, chopped scallions and parmesan cheese. Excellent!

This was a great sauce.  I cooked rice noodles and steamed a bag of frozen Asian veggies and mixed it all up with the sauce.  Yum.  My 2 year old daughter loved it; picky 5 year old son didn't (but I expected him too).  Kids should like it.

So easy and yummy!  I may scale back the lemon juice a tad (maybe add to your liking) and add some corn starch next time to thicken it up.  I will definitely make this again.
