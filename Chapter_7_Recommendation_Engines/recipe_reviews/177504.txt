This was pretty good. They stuck to the muffin pan really bad though. I would suggest using Pam spray with flour in it. We dipped them in ranch and they were really good like that. Next time I am going to try them with jalapenos in them too.

I made these for a Fiesta themed party. Everyone enjoyed them. I did use some tips from the previous reviews like plenty of Pam to prevent sticking (not a problem) and I threw in one chopped jalapeno for a double batch as well as a little garlic salt and a tiny bit of taco seasoning. They consistency is a lost like a quiche without the crust.

Prepped these for my best friend's Bridal Shower that I was catering and hosting, but never actually made them until two days after I prepped them. When I finally did make them, I was pleasantly surprised by their flavor. I remember adding some extra spices and taco seasoning, and they had a very pleasant kick. Not AMAZING, but pretty darn good. Will for sure make these again. Thank you!

The texture of these are way way off.  The ingredients sounded like it would be good, but just not for us.

Perfect bite size apps. I used some regular onion rather than scallions and it was fine. Definitely will make again, perfect for a party

These were really good!!! They weren't too difficult to get out of the pan... just needed patience! I am trying them now with both ranch and salsa!!

OMG to die for!!!  I used a Teflon tart pan, using about a full Tablespoon of batter = cute size and no problem with the pan. :)  Warning ..... the batter didn't look like much of anything and the consistency seemed too runny but what an amazing result.  Cannot remember how long I baked them but kept watching them.  So delicious!!

Made these using 1 tsp of chili powder & 1 tsp of cayenne pepper, made them just a bit more spicey, also used 1/2 small onion chopped instead of green onions.  Spray a small muffin tin with Pam and they came out beautifully

We thought these were pretty good. Four out of five ate them in my family, so they went over fairly well. I was expecting them to have a little more flavor than they did though, so maybe I will add some cumin or some other spices next time.
