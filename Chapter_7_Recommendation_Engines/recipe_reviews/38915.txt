Great chai!! Very flavorful.  You could add black or green tea if you'd like, but this is great without it.  I added one vanilla bean, sliced into 2" lengths, but next time I may just use vanilla soymilk instead of plain soymilk.  I substituted honey for the brown sugar.  I preferred mine much sweeter, so I greatly increased the amount of sweetener.  This is great hot or cold.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This is fantastic. I used vanilla soy milk, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 2 tsp ground cardamom, I shredded the ginger in my food processor and wrapped it in cheesecloth. I used 4 cinnamon sticks and a lot more brown suger.I also doubled the recipe the second time I made it because we enjoyed it so much.

I love this healthy and fun drink! It's simple to make and warm you up very well. I used garam masala for those spices because that's what I had (garam masala contains cinnamon, clove, and cardomom). Also I used unrefined stevia for brown sugar because I'm on a special diet, and it still tasted great. I like the naming and the story behind it, too.

Yum...this was a really good recipe.  I actually had some masala chai on hand, so I just threw it in and brewed it up along with the rest of the ingredients, which added even more flavor.  Now I know how to use the rest of that tea; I'll be making this regularly now.  Thanks!

Thank you for this recipe!  I used 1 qt water and 1 qt soymilk, and used honey instead of sugar.  It's great to be able to make chai without the tea.  Yum.

This is probably going to be my comfort drink for the rest of my life. Simply delicious. I have tons of fresh spices, but I've never considered using them in a drink! I used vanilla soymilk, and the end result is delicious -- I'm drinking it right now. The spices aren't very strong, but potent enough to give my palate a nudge. Phenomenal!

I make this all of the time.  I use vanilla soymilk, and I don't use any sugar.  I am very generous with the spices and with the length of cooking time.  The result is a very flavorful drink, and I love it.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

yummy. I changed it a lot though.  I actually did add a bag of chai tea since I had it and was missing cardamom. I added some splenda instead of the brown sugar but I dont even think it needed it..I find soymilk to be so sweet (vanilla soymilk that is) anyway.  But this was great, I used to make myself chai every morning.. except I would make the tea with water and just add a splash of soymilk.  but this is so creamy and doesnt take very long so I think I'll do this next time I want some chai :)
maybe even add a piece of orange peel.

So delicious! Expensive to make but so worth it! Love the name and the story behind it too. Next time I think I will try vanilla soymilk to make it a little sweeter, but Blue Agave sweetener worked very well too.

Living  20 miles from Holland, I couldn't help trying this drink. I enjoyed the smooth and delicate flavors, even though there was no smoke or incense in my living room, but I might add more ginger for a bit of a kick n xt time. Keep your eye on the soy milk as it will scorch easily. This might be nice to make in a slow-cooker. Oddly, after a few sips, I got the sudden urge to not pay my rent. Hmm... :-)

This Chai is wonderful! It's simple and easy and delicious, and made my heart happy. I loved both hot and iced, and my friends all loved it too. This recipe is a keeper. I couldn't find whole cardamom, so I used the finely crushed stuff. It was a little strong, so I'm gonna cut back on juuuust a bit in the future.
