From a nutritional stand point this dish is amazing. It's packed with protein, but you feel like you are carb loading. A win-win for a pre-diabetic fitness freak like me. However, as written it's a bit of a snooze flavor-wise. Luckily you can jazz it up easily with stuff you probably have lying around. First thing, it's screaming for acid. I used fresh squeezed lemon. Next it needs some seasoning. Salt, of course, onion powder and garlic powder as well for me. I ended up tossing in yellow, red, & orange bell peppers because I had some I needed to use. You easily could leave them out & have it be just as good though. I also added a little extra oil since I used a full cup of quinoa which I prepared with vegetable stock rather than water.

I found this really good.  I increased the quinoa to 1/3 cup (2/3 cup water) and instead of the tomatoes, I used Ro-Tel (diced tomatoes with peppers) and put in 3 tablespoons of red wine vinegar and mixed in 1/4 cup of finely shredded cheddar jack.  This made a great salad meal on a hot day when you don't want heavy.  Wonderful when served with warm wheat tortillas.

This was a good, maybe somewhat bland if I hadn't added extras, base recipe. I added some horseradish mustard, onions, and celery to give it more crunch and make the taste more vibrant. I didn't measure the ingredients but tasted and added more to suit. This recipe is great that it can be modified to fit what I have on-hand. Thanks, Julie! :o)

very bland. I was excited because of all the super healthy ingredients, but really lacking in the seasoning/spices/herbs

Really good and filling for a salad.  All of the flavors blend nicely together with just olive oil and cilantro for a dressing and herb

I added a few more ingredients: celery, red pepper, carrots, edamame and a bit more EEOV - this made a huge amount - very tasty and so healthy....

This is delicious with subs and additions. 3 stars as is, but 5 with additions. I used black beans instead of garbanzo beans, I doubled the quinoa, added 1/2 diced red pepper, 1/4 cup diced onions an 1/2 T garlic. For spices I added Black Pepper, salt, basil and red pepper (spice).
