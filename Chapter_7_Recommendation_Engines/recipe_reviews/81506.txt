In order to reduce the fat in this recipe, I baked the burgers at 325 degrees F. for 10 minutes, then turned them and baked them for another 10.

I've tried a few salmon burger recipes and will stick with this one...the patty actually sticks together and the flavor is good--especially with the lemon/basil mayo.  Will make this again.

This recipe fixes a BIG problem I had with other salmon burger recipes...they always fell apart, especially when I would grill them. I think its the eggs and bread crumbs that do the trick! Nice recipe to build off personal favorites like adding cilantro or some seafood seasoning. Thanks for sharing...a definite keeper!

I wish people would stop being wuss's. All the bones and skin in the salmon is where all the flavor is, leave it in there. This is a great recipe I've been making it this way for many years. I like putting some butter in my oil too it adds great flavor...who cares about fat you only live once so you might as well eat the tastiest food you can while on this planet. Good recipe give it a try.

This recipe was very light and flavorful. I used Panko breadcrumbs and added italian seasoning instead of the seasoned italian breadcrumbs.

We ended up using tuna because the can of salmon was disgusting!  Is it supposed to have the scales, bones and other body parts?  No thanks!  It was very nice with the tuna.  I used cilantro instead of parsley and then we topped the burgers with avocado, tomato and spinach.  I would do this recipe again.

I loved the flavor and how easy this recipe is to make.  I used the salmon that comes in the foil pouch, and they turned out just great.  This is a very tasty, healthy, and easy recipe.

Honestly, I hate salmon but my parents gave me some cans of it so I was looking up recipes to try and found this one.  Not only does my mother love it, but so do I.  I like my mother's salmon patties but these are 100 times better.  There are four things we found though - 1. If you don't have italian seasoned bread crumbs, just use plain and add a little italian seasoning - 2. Sour Cream works in the sauce if you don't have Mayo - 3. You don't need very much of the sauce or it ends up overpowering the burger, which I didn't like - and 4. Cucumbers taste really good on these  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  It was an instant favorite.  :D

I actually really enjoyed this recipe. I made 4 patties rather than 6 and served them on buns with a nice salad. A great dinner. Will definitely make them again.

This recipe was a hit with my family.  I used plain bread crumbs and dry parsley, but they came out great.  The only problem was with the number of servings.  I thought the recipe looked awfully small to yield six servings, so I doubled it.  Even so, I only came out with 7 burger-sized patties.  I served them as salmon patties, not on buns, with the mayo sauce on the side.  They were delicious!  I especially liked the sauce.  I'm not a big fan of salmon patties, but with the sauce these were great.

Delicious! I followed the recipe as original. Be careful if you don't love citrusy flavors, this packs a lemon punch... other then that, wonderful/easy/simple/good for you.

First, I joined All Recipes just so I could rate this recipe.  That in it self should tell you what I think of the recipe.  A very nice recipe that is simply to create.  Very tasty with or without the sauce.

I am a guy who likes spice / heat so I added some additional red pepper, and nothing more.

Only negative, portion size is off.  For the guys in the crowd, this recipe makes at most 4 burgers.  If you use any decent size bun adjust the amount you will need to make or you will end up making salmon sliders which wouldn't be bad either.

I thank the person for submitting this recipe.  I will make this one again.

I love this recipe and make it regularly.  I do adjust some of the amounts of spices to our taste, and usually make bigger patties than it calls for.  A word about the "grossness" of canned salmon: depending upon the brand you buy, some do contain skin and bones, but you can get others that are more like tuna.  I just remove the skin, feed it to my cat or throw it away.  The bones are so soft that they just mash into mush and disappear into the mixture with no effect on taste.  you will not choke on one of these bones-- trust me. 
  I know it sounds gross, but it's actually a terrific source of calcium and really good for you.  Trader Joe's makes a can of pink wild Alaskan salmon about the size of a tuna can that is skinless and boneless. It works well with this recipe but you need to adjust the amounts to keep it together more.  Two cans with the recipe as written but making 4 patties works pretty well even though it's 12 oz instead of 16.  In general, though, I think the flavor is better when you use the red salmon and deal with the skin and bones.

Everyone enjoyed, especially our 14 year old son.  Slight tweaks were to use red onion, add some finely chopped green and red bell pepper plus 3 cloves of minced garlic to the salmon mixture (which made 4 patties) and use only one egg.  For the mayonnaise, I used Canola mayonnaise, added fresh minced garlic, a bit of Dijon mustard, more fresh lemon juice, black pepper, but omitted the lemon pepper.  Didn't measure anything, just whisked together until I liked the taste, lol. I baked the salmon patties on a foil lined cookie sheet (sprayed with Pam) at 350 degrees for about 13 minutes, flipped them and cooked about 7 more minutes.  Waiting a bit longer to flip them seemed to help them stay together.  Served on toasted onion buns with romaine lettuce, fresh tomato and red onion.  Super tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were easy and very good.  You don't need to use very much oil when cooking; I just lightly brushed my pan with less than a tablespoon of canola and could have left that off since my pan doesn't stick.

My husband hates onions.  If you are in the same boat just cook a some onion slices in the pan after the burgers are done and serve to those who do like onion.

I didn't have mayo so instead I mixed 0% greek yogurt with some lime juice, onion powder, and lemon-pepper and that was a nice compliment to the salmon burgers.

It also works well to use old bay seasoning instead of or in addition to the basil.

I served these on drop biscuits which were cut in half and added a slice of tomato, chopped fresh onion, and the above mentioned grilled onion and yogurt spread.

Good, solid recipe. Made some substitutions that were  on-hand and proved to be really tasty. Instead of parsley and basil = used fresh dill. Loved the flavor of the dill + lemon. Instead of Italian seasoning breadcrumbs = used panko + Jane's Crazy Mixed-Up Salt (to taste). Also added a dash of garlic powder (or fresh would be great). For the sauce, used less lemon, added more fresh dill, a dash of garlic powder again and 1 oz of softened light cream cheese + a dash of pepper. Fish-wary husband ate two. I consider that a success!!

These were better than the way I had been making mine. Thjs is how I modified to where it makes two patties. I used 1 6oz can wild alaskan salmon, then I used one egg white, 3TBSP fresh parsley, 3 TBSP breadcrumbs, I did 3/4TBP minced onion, 3/4 TBSP lemon juice, 1/4 tsp dried basil and the pinch of red pepper flakes. Then I baked in the oven per another reviewers instructions to cut out the oil. They were awesome. I made a spicy garlic aioli instead of the lemon mayo listed.

These were delicious although I changed up the recipe a little.I added grated carrot, finely cut spinach, some sweet pepper, a cup of mash potatoes and garbanzo beans which I processed. These were all leftovers I included to make it healthier.I also used plain bread crumbs and added Italian seasoning since I didn't have any  of the one used in the original recipe.I must say these were wonderful and my family enjoyed them.With all the extra ingredients added I was able to make seven large burgers : )

These were great!! I used some vacuum sealed smoked salmon we had purchased while in Alaska, so it added a little smokey taste as well. I made 4 patties for the 2 of us- the first night we had them on buns, and the second night we put them in a big salad. Very, very tasty, and will definately make them again!!

Just ok, wouldn't make again. Make sure your can of salmon says boneless & skinless... I got a can full of bones & spent awhile picking them out. This would prob be better with fresh salmon.

This is an excellent salmon burger/patty! I was looking for a "dressed up" meal---and altered this recipe by serving it on rice and prepared a lemon/pepper white sauce to spoon on top. The sauce was: 2 T. butter melted in a saucepan, add 1 whole onion chopped, saute till onions start to soften. Sift and stir in 1 1/2 T. flour. Immediately add 1 c. 2% milk (or half and half for a creamier sauce).  Stir until thickened. Add 1/2 tsp. lemon/pepper (or more if you like it hot/spicy).
Serve with steamed broccoli. We loved it!

I had a 5oz foil pack of boneless, skinless salmon that I used so I modified the servings as it was only me and my 5 year old eating;. They kind of came out like crab cakes;(which I love) and I told my son they were "krabby patties" lol- sold! The mayo, (which I just kind of added the ingredients as I saw fit) was awesome. I tried making salmon burgers/patties once about 12 years ago. They were horrid. But now if we need a quick, cheap, weeknight dinner, this is easy, tastier than tuna casserole, and healthier than fish sticks!

This was pretty good, I only had dried parsley, but will definitely use fresh next time, I think it makes a difference. Also, I didn't have red pepper, but will also make sure I add it in next time I make them. Also fresh lemon for sure is a must!

Incredibly delicious!  Didn't have bread crumbs so I used crushed unsalted saltines, and let the mixture sit for about 10 mins to let it bond together.  I also made four patties instead of six. The sauce went perfectly with these.  I served this with Onion Rice from this site with some veggies and all four of us LOVED dinner tonight.  Thanks MELDS!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I am not a fan of fish in a can, but this didn't have a fishy taste at all.  I've used this recipe 3 times already.  The first time was amazing because I let it marinate for some time since I didn't have fresh parsley and didn't want to continue without it so it sat in a covered bowl taking in all of the flavors for atleast an hour.  The second time around I just threw it together for a quick dinner (used bottled lemon juice)and it was good, but not amazing.  The third time I allowed it to marinate to get that oh so good flavor and used fresh lemon... actually half of a lemon and half of a lime (all I had) which added a nice taste.  I can't imagine trying any other recipe for Salmon Burgers but will eventually venture out :)  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum, these were so good!  Hubby loved them too.  I made as directed and put them on buns with tomato.  The lemon basil mayo really added to the flavor!  I too was a little taken aback by the bones and skin in the can, but was able to pick it out okay.  I served them on large size whole wheat buns, so only got three patties from the mix.  
Will definitely make these again!

For one that absolutely does not care for salmon, I found this delectible. I chose to eat the salmon open-faced spreading the mayonnaise sauce over the top with some lettuce (in an effort to eliminate some of the carbs). Real quick to make and perfect to serve as a lenten meal.

This is very good recipie.  I made exactly as directed and they turned out great.  I also make a very similar "burger".  I omit the pepper flakes and lemon juice and add about 2 tsps. of Old Bay or to taste.  They hold together well and the Old Bay gives it a little kick.

Oh man, so good! And I don't even really like salmon. These are so healthy and easy. My 2.5 year old ate it, and my husband asked me to make it again. I made it exactly as written. I ran out of sauce though... next time I will double it. Also, this made 4 medium size burgers. 6 would have been pretty small.

This is definitely a keeper. I couldn't find a 16 oz. can of salmon; it was something like 14.5. I made 4 patties instead of 6. I didn't feel like dicing an onion for only 2 Tbsps., so I used dried onion flakes. Instead of red pepper flakes, I used cayenne. And I cut the mayo with non-fat, plain yogurt and used dill instead of basil. Oh, and I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil. Very tasty burgers!

I have several salmon burger recipes, but this is the one I always use.  They are easy, use ingredients I always have on hand, and are delish! I always make them into 4 patties, and ususally need to use more breadcrumbs than it calls for.

These were pretty good and I really liked the lemon mayo.  I followed the recipe exactly and only came out with four small patties.  I did find that two eggs was way too much.  Maybe the recipe meant small eggs?   It was too wet to shape, so I added another 1/4 of breadcrumbs and it worked much better.  I also baked them.  Next time I'll only add 1 egg, but these were good and they stayed together.

This has become a pantry staple at our house.  The burgers are always yummy. Often I don't have fresh parsley on hand and a smaller amount of dried works just fine.  Canned wild caught salmon is a secret way to get the high quality, healthy fish at a fraction of the cost of fresh wild salmon.

I think that this is the best and easiest salmon patty recipe I've come across!  I used 1 tablespoon of dried parsley instead of fresh, quick oats in place of bread crumbs plus 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning, added 1 clove of minced garlic and left out the pepper flakes.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon of both turmeric and curry (only because I add them to most meals for their medicinal purposes).  I baked them on a pan oiled with canola oil at 350, but I think I'll try 400 degrees next time.  I also did not make/try the dressing.

These were really great. I don't eat a ton of fish, and my mom is a proclaimed non fish eater.. but we both loved these. I was a little wary about finding bones in canned salmon (plus, the mother says it too closely resembles cat food in that form..) So I bought 12oz of salmon filet and put it in the food processor for about 10 seconds. I also almost doubled the amount of breadcrumbs so it would taste even less fishy, and added some hot mustard as well. 
I ended up with 4 nice sized patties all together, and they were great!

My husband went nuts over these burgers. I would agree that it is a restaurant quality recipe.  So flavorful. I do think it is stretching it saying that it will feed 6 people.  Next time we will double the recipe for our family of 5. Do not omit the sauce - it definitely adds to the whole delightful  experience.

This turned out light and great for summer.  Halved the recipe and made 2 full patties.  The accompanying sauce is pretty lemony, but works well with the flavors of the salmon burger.  A great weeknight dish, thanks!

Really good! Other recipes I've tried were too "fishy!" I cooked them in my Foreman Grill so as not to heat up the house on a hot summer day. I added hot sauce to the sauce to give it some kick. Another note - first time I used canned salmon - the bones scared me at first, I took out the big chunks and once everything was mixed together they disappeared.

"Yummy" is right! Only thing I wasn't crazy about was the sauce. I thought it was dull, added a few dashes of Texas Pete and it still needed something. But the Salmon burgers were perfect!

My family loved this!  It was so delicious!  I added a bell pepper and used panko instead of breadcrumbs.  I tripled the recipe, but used one egg and some egg white (but not as much as the recipe called for).  And, per another reviewer's suggestion, I baked them instead of frying them.  They were not quite as crispy as if I'd fried them, but still delicious and healthier.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Pretty good.  Used yogurt in dip instead of mayo.  Froze them and took to work for lunch!

I omitted the onions, but they still turned out great. The sauce goes very well with the burgers, it's nice and lemony.

Kids loved them!  I used 3 (6 oz) cans of salmon and baked them at 325 F for 10 min on each side, per, other user.  Mine only made 4 and 1/2 (made a small one for my baby).  So I guess mine were a little bit bigger.  They stayed together for the most part.  Overall, pretty impressed.  I would make more of the lemon mayo though, I couldn't taste enough of it.

Pretty good, especially for a weeknight meal. I tasted the mixture (before adding the egg) and found that I needed to add some additional spices, so I added some onion powder, sea salt, and more basil. A word of warning, the scaling mechanism seems to be off on this recipe. I scaled it to be a recipe for 2 people and it said to still use a 16 oz can of salmon as well as a whole egg, which would have been waaaay too much salmon and a bit too much egg. Canned salmon comes in two varieties: with the skin and bones (which are edible, since they're so soft and provide a lot of nutrients) and without. You can get the kind without bones and skin at Costco near the canned tuna. Just FYI.

This is great - I added Old Bay seasoning to it. For the mayo I added chipotle Tabasco sauce instead of lemon, since we like it spicy. Awesome flavor combo. I agree with the other commenters though that this only made 4 burgers, definitely not more. Thanks for sharing!

Oh my goodness... I don't think I have enough words to describe how wonderfully these turned out! The hubby thought it was great, and even my picky 3 year old son inhaled his before I could ask him what he thought of it LOL. The only changes I made was onion powder instead of the chopped onion(sadly I had no onions left to chop up for this) & I added a bit of garlic powder, maybe 1/2 tsp. This is definitely a recipe I will save and make over and over again. Thank you!!

I've used this recipe several times and we all really like it in our family. The traditional style canned salmon may not be pretty but it's very nutritious. You mash up the(very soft) bones right along with everything else & it has a ton of calcium!

I bought salmon fillets and put them through the food processor, rather than using canned salmon.  EVERYONE loved these salmon burgers.  I've had several requests to make them again!

Ok, let me just say that salmon is not one of my favorites to eat.  Neither is it for my kids.  But I came across this recipe and after checking out the comments I thought I should give it a try.  My 11 yr. old son absolutely loved it and has asked me to make it again. This has become a favorite for him.  My daughter loved it as well and so did I.  Going to be making this again on Monday for my son.  The only thing I can say is 16 ounces is not enough for three people.  I doubled it and I feel like I should have trippled it because I almost didn't have enough.

This recipe utterly deserves its high rating because these burgers were delicious and perfect. The -only- thing I changed about the burgers was adding dried parsley and onion flakes vs. fresh. For the sauce I added 1tsp dijon mustard, 1/2tsp dill and 1tsp minced garlic to ~3tbsp mayo (and lemon juice and basil).

This recipe was wonderfully reminiscent of a recipe my mom used to make. These burgers held together extremely well. I added a few things....I threw in about a Tablespoon of dijon mustard and made a sweet basil roasted red pepper spread to put on the burgers.     To make the spread: In a food processor combine 1/2 cup light cream cheese, 1 roasted red pepper, 3 T of basil paste( usually you can buy in fresh food section) and some salt and pepper.

The flavors really blend well together.  I used a 1 lb salmon fillet rather than the canned variety.  Just gave it a couple pulses with the food processor.

Made this last night.  We loved them.  When making the patties, I didn't think they were going to stay together, but they did.  I had mine with a salad, my husband on a roll.  We followed the recipe, and were very happy with it as is.  Very tasty, very filling.

These burgers are awsome! Always looking for new healthy ways to cook salmon. Been cooking salmon burgers similar to this from Rachel Ray and I love them. I didnt have any parsley so I ommitted that this round, and only had lemon juice in a bottle but still turned out great. Added a little seafood seasoning and crushed garlic. Took the advise of another review and sprayed these with pam and cooked them in the oven for 10 min on each side on 375 degrees... PERFECT! Also added come chpped capers to the mayo, me and my boyfriend raved over these ...thank you so much

These are extremely easy and very good. I followed the recipe exactly except that I "dusted" the outside of the patties with Panko crumbs. Once I got them into the pan, I had no trouble with them falling apart. I will be making these again for sure.

AMAZING!!!!  I was kind of hesitant using canned salmon but it was well worth it :-)  I only used 1 egg and I put a little garlic powder in it as well.  They turned out perfect!  I will definitely be making these again.

I give this 4 stars because my husband wasn't crazy about them, but me and my daughter loved them. I made this exact recipe the other day, the two eggs it calls for was perfect for me, but I think I made them too thick, I made four and fried them on the stove in a little bit of oil, but they weren't cooking in the middle, so I had to put them in the oven. But today I mixed it up and dipped each patty in seasoned flour and fried them in my fryer and they came out delicious, I baked the others for me and my daughter with no flour and I thought they were great. My husband ate it on hamburger buns with mustard and ketchup, he wasn't crazy about the mayo. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

The pattie held together and was a good flavor. I used lemon pepper rather than lemon juice. The canned salmon was a little scarey at first but I picked out the bones and skin it was just fine.

Yes they were yummy! A bit too moist using two eggs. Ended up making four patties. Wish there was more flavor or heat ( next time I might try adding more pepper flakes ). Would make again.

This is the best salmon burger recipe I've found so far. They are a little fragile and tough to flip, but they taste great. The mayo sauce is a good addition.

Very good recipe, my husband loved these.  I made 4 burgers and served on toasted bread with tomato and onion.  I will make again but next time will try with just 1 egg.

My family loved this salmon burger recipe, though the flavor of the sauce was too strong for my wife. I had 14.75oz cans of salmon instead of the 16oz and because my family is usually hungry, I modified the serving size from 6 to 10. This worked out very well with the 2 cans of 14.75oz pink salmon I had. I made the patty size so I came out with 9 instead of 10. That worked out perfectly for the 3 of us. I also made twice as much of the sauce, but since my wife didn't want any, I ended up with more than I needed. I used Miracle Wipe instead of Mayonnaise which I didn't have. All in all, this salmon patty recipe was a winner.
I would like to mention that some reviewers I noted complaining about the looks of the salmon do not understand that the skin and bones are soft and very eatable. You just make sure you crush and stir in the skin, a source of vitamin A, and bones, a source of Calcium, into the salmon. My family couldn't even detect the skin and bone in the patty's. For those desiring to reduce the fat by baking and eliminating the oil, the Salmon has more fat than in the oil, but it's the good kind of fat. I use Canola Oil, which is a good fat, to fry the Salmon Burgers in. All in all, a good meal with good health fats, Omega 3 and lots of protein.

Yes, very tasty!  I didn't find the flavor to be overwhelmingly fishy or too citrus rich.  I didn't have any parsley on hand so I substituted dill and it seemed to be fine.  I like rich flavor so I may do another shake or two of red pepper next time.  I cooked them on my George Foreman grill and it was very easy to clean and healthier than frying.

Very tasty. Will try some of the other reviewer's ideas about 'tweaking' the recipe next time I make it. Hubby is an avid saltwater fisher so I'm always trying to find new ways to prepare fish.

I rarely rate recipes, but I have to pipe up here.  This is a go-to, never-fail recipe for salmon burgers.  It's one thing I can get my teenage sons to agree on.  I triple the recipe, they'll eat them for dinner, and will heat up the leftovers for a snack.  They are delicious.

Super delicious and very healthy.  I chose wild canned salmon for a cost effective heart healthy meal.  Made it gluten free by using 1 slice of gluten free bread, ground up to make crumbs.  I used Silver Hills Omega 3 Flax bread (toasted then ground).  Cooked on a skillet with coconut oil.  Served with fresh green salad. Will make it again.

Great recipe! I was hesitant to use that much lemon but everything turned out perfect. I added extra salmon just for my own personal preference.  The sauce was good as well.  I made one version of the sauce with pickle relish due to my husband's own taste.  Both were good.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made this last night as an alternative to going out for seafood. I've never made salmon burgers but this was absolutely fantastic. I followed the recipe verbatim, the only thing I changed was I ACCIDENTALLY spilled celery salt into the sauce that's recommended, but even that turned out great. I read another review about hoe the canned salmon was "disgusting", yes it wasn't what I expected but deboning and skinning took no time at all. I served this with a whole grain sesame bun, lettuce, avocados and lettuce. One of the best burgers I've ever made and I will be making this again!

I used fresh salmon and these are WONDERFUL. Just replace the canned  salmon with 1 pound diced salmon (I had a 1 pound filet and diced it) and double the bread crumbs to account for the added moisture. Makes 5 good sized burgers…next time I will make double!

This is my favorite salmon burger recipe.  They are tasty, easy to make, and have just the right spice balance.  I don't make the sauce unless I am serving them in buns.  They are good without it too. I like to make four out of the recipe as a meal portion.

Fantastic! I don't like fish, but I loved these burgers. The only thing I did differently was the mayonnaise dressing. I did not want to use mayo so instead I made guac. I used the extra onions, parsley, and lemon juice with some salt and pepper. It came out awesome!

I added about 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, some more seasonings, and used onion rolls. Instead of canned salmon I used 3 of the 5-oz pouches that were already cleaned and ready to just toss in. This made about 4 normal burgers.

After being given a random can of Salmon from my mother-in-law I decided to make salmon burgers for a very suspicious husband.  I served them on onion buns and a big green salad.  Salmon burgers are all gone. One trick is to make certain they really get nice and brown on one side before flipping and they won't fall apart.

This one's definitely a keeper. I made my own breadcrumbs and Italian seasoning, unfortunately ran out of lemon juice (got about one and a half tablespoons into the mix, didn't realize I was almost out), used freshly caught salmon from Lake Michigan and baked the patties instead of frying them (five patties took about 13 minutes, flipping them halfway). I also did not make the mayo spread because I utterly loathe mayo and used sour cream instead. The sour cream was good but I think I will use tartar sauce in the future.

Other than those changes, I followed the recipe pretty closely and really enjoyed the results. The two tablespoons lemon juice probably would have been perfect as I am a huge lover of citrus flavors in fish but the one and a half is noticeable, yet subtle, for those who are not that into lemon.

These patties have been added to my top three favorite recipes for salmon. Thank you MELDS for sharing.

Excellent! Used fresh salmon instead of canned. Substituted a pepper & garlic Aoli for the lemon-y mayo because we wanted to spice it up a bit. This will become a staple at our house.

This is wonderful. I just did two things different than recipe. I added a little Dijon mustard to the mayonaise and I used Hungry Girl Foldit Flatbread instead of buns. One reviewer said that she baked in oven to save on fat. I did that but do not see why spraying pan with cooking spray would not so the same.

Love this recipe. It's a keeper. I use one small can of salmon and halve the recipe--makes two patties. I've added different spices depending upon my mood, and tonight I added feta to the rest of the recipe as is. I use my George Foreman indoor grill to cook them--perfect!

I love these salmon burgers!  The only change I made was that I added old bay seasoning and I used freeze dried onions/parsley.  I used to order salmon burgers from Schwan's but these are better by far.  The lemon mayo was also very good.  Insted of basil in the mayo I used old bay seasoning.  This is a great way to consume salmon.  I'm not a fan of salmon any other way.  These are so good I could eat one for lunch everyday.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty good.  Not the tastiest I've ever had but I liked it and so did my husband. It just needs something to make it a little more savory....not sure what.

This was ok. The burgers did fall apart some, next time I might add some extra bread crumbs because the patties were pretty wet.

I'm disappointed with this recipe. While the combination of ingredients is tasty, my burgers did not stay together at all. I followed the recipe exactly, and my burgers fell apart completely during cooking.

Made these for lunch today for my 2 boys (1.5yrs and 4) and they couldn't get enough.  Loved it!  I made them into small, flattened rounds about the size of chicken nuggets and they ate them with the dipping sauce (recipe provided).  My only change was that I Used chopped cilantro in place of parsley and in place of the basil in the mayo sauce.  Yummy!

Excellent ration of salmon to breadcrumbs and eggs. Instead of using the seasoned breadcrumbs (too salty for my brand of fish), I used low sodium 'buttery crackers' crumbled up to reach 1/4 cup - about 12 crackers. Also, instead of parsley and dried basil I simply used fresh basil. For flavor impact, how could you ever use veggie oil over butter? Ha ha, well, that's just my youthful love of animal fat talking.

I baked these at 375 for 10 minutes per side and it worked really well. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and they were delicious, although a bit crumbly. I'm not really sure how to fix that, but I will be making these again!

Gosh these are sooooo GOOD! I was skeptical about using canned salmon,picking out the bones was gross, but they turned out just fine. Made 4 patties. Served them on whole wheat buns for a healthy dinner. The lemon basil mayo had excellent flavor-will make these again!

this was my first time making and eating salmon patty. it was very easy to make, i added frash garlic to the patty and the mayo, toasted a burger bun and had it with romaine lettuce and red onions. refridgerated the pattys first and they still kinda broke when I put them in a pan but stayed together after they cooked a little longer.

FANTABULOUS!  So yummy, and nutritious!  I used two 6 oz. cans of boneless skinless salmon (had never tried them before this recipe), and made my own bread crumbs using a few saltine crackers and oatmeal and blending them up into crumbs..(just added some seasoned salt, few twists of fresh ground black pepper, cayenne and chili powder for spice preference, and tiny bit of thyme).  I used fresh herbs and actually increased the amount (can never go wrong with fresh herbs, in my mind!), and I also added one clove of minced garlic.  Since I only had one lemon, I used 1/2 for the salmon patties, and 1/2 for the sauce later.. but I did use some of the zest as well.  I placed the formed patties on a parchment lined baking sheet, and chilled in fridge for a few minutes while I made the sauce.  The only different thing I did with the sauce was use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 plain yogurt.  To cook the patties, I used a stovetop grill pan, sprayed with olive oil, and the 4 minutes per side was perfect.  Served on whole wheat bun with spinach and sliced avocado, and a side of oven baked sweet potato fries.  DEEEELICIOUS!  I know that even if I hadn't made the changes to suit my taste, I would still consider this a 5 star recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us. :)

This recipe is so good and easy to make! It was a hit right away even though I forgot the lemon juice and only had one egg to make it with! Will definitely make this one again, especially on busy evenings when I still want a delicious dinner. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is a pleasant change from a regular burger. The recipe was easy to prepare, I did dust the patties with flour after shapeing and let sit in the refrigerator for about an hour before pan frying. This is the first salmon pattie that has not fallen apart on me. It was very tasty and the sauce was a nice addition to the burger. I served the Salmon Burger with Lettuce and Tomatoes,and sides of French Fries and Cole Slaw. This made a very nice light meal and we will be making this again and again. The recipe only made five medium patties for me.

Great fresh flavor, I also made 4 patties instead and fresh basil. The flavored mayo worked well and instead of burger, or deli buns I found some whole wheat slider buns at the store by Oroweat that were really good.

This was a meal of firsts for me. First meal for my in-laws and first meal in my new home with my new cookware. It worked out really well. I didn't have red pepper flakes so i used a couple of dashes of Tabasco. Didn't have parsley so i used fresh oregano and basil. I was going to make the dressing but i didn't because the patties all fell apart when i was cooking them. Still tasted good though. My father-in-law told my mother-in-law that he thought mine were less boring than the usual salmon patties he ate. I will use this recipe again!

We really enjoyed these burgers. We do not like mayo and so we used tarter sauce instead. Still very yummy.

Very delicious and they held up well.  Personally, I think they need garlic to make the flavor stronger.  I substituted onion powder for the onion because I didn't have it in the house.

Delicious!  Very easy to make, and super tasty. The sauce was a perfect complement to the salmon.  Have already been asked to make this again.

Good stuff!  I made the sauce but we didn't use it because they were terrific just as they were.  My 13, 9, and 5 year old loved them too!

I made these with a few substitutions:  2-6oz cans of salmon, fresh basil instead of parsley, added a teaspoon of minced garlic, and some black pepper. I didn't make the sauce. These were delicious!  Even my 4 year old enjoyed his mini salmon burger!  I served them on salad for my husband and myself with no sauce needed on the burgers.  They were moist and flavourful without the addition of any sauce.  Will definitely make again!

The lemon/mayo is what makes this salmon burger delicious! Not sure if it would be 5stars without it. I minced up fresh salmon (hate the canned stuff) but otherwise followed recipe. Will be making this again :)

This is a great recipe for Salmon. I did make some adjustments--I toasted white bread and crunched it up for crumbs and then added italian seasoning, I added more onion, some salt and black pepper. Two eggs were perfect for me. I served them on toasted kaiser rolls with the delicious mayonnaise recipe that's included. This is a keeper!!!

These patties were delicious. I used two 6oz cans of canned salmon from Trader Joes, and followed the rest of the recipe, adding only one egg. The sauce was good too. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed these for dinner with a salad!!

These are just wonderful. I have made them for a main dish for the family, and I've also made them in to very small patties for a party appetizer. Both were met with much appreciation! The lemon-basil mayonnaise is a PERFECT accompaniment, and the dish is also wonderful reheated if there are leftovers. Yummy is a fitting descriptor!

My husband has never wanted "salmon loaf" due to the fact that his mother served it at least twice a week when he was growing up so he wasn't real thrilled when I told him I was making salmon cakes. Well he loved them.  I served them with cocktail sauce because I had some in my fridge but will make the suggested sauce next time.  One thing is that I did only need one egg.  It would've been too runny with two. Also I added 1/2 tsp of Old Bay which I think helped a lot.  I'm having a dinner party tomorrow night and will be making these in the mini version for appetizers.  It's great because I can make them up ahead!

Amazing - for my own twist I used Panko crumbs and lots of dill weed in the cakes as well as the lemony sauce. Perfect - I'm in love with this and had to write before I even finished my first cake!! Woweee!

Absolutely Delicious!!! To the mayo mixture I added 2 tbsp of dill and cracked pepper and salt. I added some of the mayo spread to the salmon burger mixture and added more bread crumbs (Note: I used plain bread crumbs rather than the italian). I also reserved some of the mayo mixture to spread on top of the burgers. This was absolutely delicious!

These were way better than my highest hopes. I normally use dill w/salmon, not basil. I was skeptical, but my husband encouraged me to use the basil anyway. I was glad I did!! The only things I did different were I added about 1/2tsp. Italian seasoning since I had only plain bread  crumbs on hand and I forgot the onion.I also dipped the meat into flour b4 frying. I got 7 medium patties out of 2 batches. The amount of eggs was just right. I had added less in the beginning, but the mixture was just too sticky without the full amount of eggs. So, as written, I think the recipe is perfect. Oh, and make sure you try the basil sauce. I added a pinch of splenda to the sauce and a bit of black pepper. Will certainly make again!!!!

Pretty easy weeknight recipe. I used fresh breadcrumbs made in the food processor, since I didn't have any packaged ones around, so that may have changed the consistency a little. They were soft, but held together fine in the pan. I liked the sauce - very easy to put together and adds a nice touch!

Really liked that this salmon burger stayed together.  Tasted great.  I used my own homemade tartar sauce instead of the mayo.  Thanks for this recipe.

Instead of picking them out, I crushed the salmon bones into the flesh (I used a potato masher) so we could enjoy the health benefits. It worked! I didn't notice the bones while eating! I also used 1 egg, 3/4 cup leftover mashed potatoes, no parsley, 1 TBS dry onion flakes, 1/3 cup breadcrumbs, 1 TBS lemon juice, 1/4 tsp basil, a pinch red pepper. I used non-stick spray in the pan instead of oil, and I doubled the sauce ingredients (I used full-fat mayo so I added about 1 TBS milk to thin it out a little). It was all very good! The potatoes were a great addition, I just wanted to use them up. Our daughter ate all her burger, and my husband enjoyed several. I made 8 smallish patties and served them (without buns) with rice with broccoli and mushrooms. Thanks for sharing, Melds!

Excellent consistency, the only salmon burger recipe I've found that actually stinks together.  Nice taste too.  Not so crazy about the mayo.

Good and flavorful.  Don't taste salmony.  We made the entire batch into 2 large burgers (very filling!).  Next time will make 3 or 4, but they still cooked and held together well (used cast iron griddle).  Heavy on the egg, so the crust that forms on the patty looks a lot like the darker spots on an omlet or crepe.  Served on a bun with mixed greens and the mayo, which is runny but has a nice flavor.  Sweet potato fries (also from allrecipes) made a nice accompaniment - burger and fries with a healthy twist!

This recipe was great. I used fresh salmon and cooked it till tender then used the recipe. I didn't have the italian bread crumbs but used some fresh bread crumbs and added seasoned salt. Tasted fantastic.

Great recipe, will definetly make it again! I used fresh salmon and poached it in water, white wine and salt. I also substituted cracker crumbs and a  little flour for the bread crumbs and only used one egg. The mayo sauce really adds to overall flavor of the burger, but I suggest using fresh basil and lots of it! Excellent dish.

Awesome!  I made this several times, and we never tire of it.  Last time I added some fresh dill.  BTW, the canned Red Salmon tastes much better than the usual one, so it's really worth the little extra it cost.

This was lovely! I'm a beginner and have never made burgers before but this wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. I used frozen salmon which I thawed before flaking. The mixture was a bit too wet to stay together properly (the frozen salmon is probably the culprit) so I added more bread crumbs. I got eight 5-inch-wide patties out of it. This is a surprisingly great recipe!

I used leftover salmon that I had grilled the day before. The eggs really made them stick together. The burgers turned out great even though I had no onions. Awesome and easy quick dinner.

I added salt and pepper and used NF Greek yogurt for sauce instead of mayo. Good enough to make again although I might spice them up a bit more.

Great used routine salmon from Kroger and 2- 6oz pieces were too much for the 2 of us. I would use 6-8 oz for 2 and cut the rest accordingly. I also added fresh dill and minced garlic to sauce and a little to salmon. I used lime instead of lemon. Did I follow this at all???? It was great.

I highly suggest sticking the patties in the fridge for an hour or so, before cooking, otherwise they have a tendency to fall apart.

I didn't have parsley so used celery leaves (thank you Google!!) I also added fresh dill and some chopped bacon to the mix! I let the patties chill the full four hours before cooking. It was too windy for the grill so I used a cast iron skillet. And I used angel hair cabbage instead of arugula. 
The sauce is SO good!
Served with baked bacon-wrapped asparagus ??
Two thumbs up and one full tummy! Yum!!!

Superb! It's better if you squish out all the water from the salmon (use a towel) before adding other ingredients then put in fridge for at least 30 minutes or over night before making the patties. That helps the bread crumbs absorb the rest of the liquid.  I will use that sauce for lots of other fish meals!!!

I made this as written with the exception of the salmon, since I only found 14.75-oz cans. I got just 5 patties out of the recipe. My family enjoyed these (including my 13-month old granddaughter)! I had to double the dressing recipe to cover buns for 4 adults. The next time I make these, I will add a little more bread crumbs since I thought the mixture was too mushy.

I've made this with both canned and fresh salmon. It's delicious both ways. They are moist and flavorful. My 4 and 1 year old loved them as well! Just as good the next day as leftovers over a bed of lettuce.

So easy and so good, my husband thought I bought them premade. My salmon can was 14 oz and I made 3 good size patties, would have been enough for 4 if I made them smaller.  I didn't  have parsley, so I doubled the dry basil. I substituted green onions and black pepper and added about 1/4 tsp of onion powder, lemon pepper seasoning, and lemon zest

This could possibly be the best salmon burger recipe I've tried so far. Had to substitute plain panko for the breadcrumbs due to a family member allergy, but it was delicious. (I did season the panko with garlic powder, basil, oregano, salt & pepper.) Anyhow, the burger was nicely browned and crunchy and held together very well. Lemon flavor and interesting mayo dressing a definite plus!

I recommend doubling the breadcrumbs because my patties fell apart.  It wasn't too bad, nothing a bit more breadcrumbs won't fix.  Also, if you like the sauce I recommend doubling that as well.  Otherwise the recipe is perfect as is!

I followed the recipe as is. They  tasted good but they were way to moist, I had trouble making patties. If I make these again I will try adding more crumbs.

I made these yesterday. I'm giving five stars because my husband loved them! me...not to much. I feel like something was missing. The flavor wasn't there for me but, they weren't bad either. I did add bell pepper to the mixture. Other than that I went by the recipe and I will make these again :)

I am supposed to be eating more salmon and the salmon burgers at Costco didn't taste very good.  I made this recipe the same with the exceptions of using 1/4 cup parsley and used 2 tablespoons of fresh basil from my garden.  It was great.  Even my whole family who only likes beef hamburgers loved it.  Now I don't have to make two different kinds of burgers  for dinner.  
This recipe will be used many times again.

I have made these a few times now.  I use fresh, leftover salmon.  I had previously cooked with a shiacha/syrup/lime.  Then for this, just mashed salmon to bits.  Followed the recipe after that.  Excellent!!  My fiancee  loves them.  He also likes to use some of the marinade from original recipe.  We have used a bagel instead of bun.  Always yummy

My family of 8 doubles this recipe and it always makes enough. I really like how it is a no fuss recipe, just toss everything in the bowl and combine. It is really helpful for quick dinner nights, served on hamburger buns with a salad. Also, I never have fresh parsley on hand, so I just substitute dried. I don't have the problem with bones in my salmon, but maybe I'm buying boneless salmon.

Not a fan of fish in a can but I acquired a case of canned salmon.   This is Very good. Very easy. Will make it again. 
Did not change a thing.

Second time:  I added 1 red jalapeño (diced) and a handful of chopped fresh cilantro.  Again, this was very good.

These are fabulous! (But I did substitute one tablespoon of chopped fresh dill for the dried basil in the salmon burgers, and 2 more teaspoons  if fresh dillin the lemon  mayonaise instead of dried basil, as dill is often used in sauces with salmon...I'm sure one could also use dried dill.)

Substituted 1 cup rolled oats for the bread crumbs and a tsp of Siracha sauce for the red pepper flakes, and they turned out well. (made 6 large patties and 1 small one, they all stuck together well) Even my little bro who hates fish ate a second one! We ate them like burgers with tomatoes and lettuce and so I couldn't taste the flavor of the sauce much.
Edit: I also added 2 tbs. dijon.

Cooked this tonight for dinner but I was out of lemon so I substituted with lime.  Me and my husband both agree this is a tasty recipie. I thought the combination of basil, fresh parsley and lime made it taste fresh and not fishy.  We will use this again.

I have made this recipe twice now, and it's a hit.  I fry 4 decent sized patties in a ceramic skillet with only a little oil.  Turn them carefully.  Patties might fall apart when they are fresh, but it doesn't effect the flavor at all.  We like a bit of garlic added to the mayo. So nice to be able to use canned salmon!

Was given 2 cans of salmon but was too hot to bake a salmon loaf.  Tried this recipe even though I have never been able to make a decent salmon burger.  The patties turned out perfect.  The sauce added to the flavor.  Will definitely make again.  Served with garlic red potatoes, mashed.  Thanks.

This recipe turned out to be even better than expected. I didn't change a thing. Everyone loved it! I made it with two sides, a lemon pepper brown rice cooked in vegetable stock with green peas and a summer squash/zucchini mix. Oh... The best part is that it really didn't need a bun; it's fabulous on its own. I will absolutely make this again. YUM!!!

Some of you are squeamish.  The bones are soft, nutritious, and great treat for young kids.  We used to beg mom to fish them out before using the meat, and ate with great delight.  Scales, not so much.

My son liked this, and he's picky, but my daughter not so much.  This was definitely easy and fast a promised, which is good for a family meal on a weeknight.  I served it on flatbread with tomatoes, the dressing was good, but a little runny.

Super simple. Literally took me 20 mins from start to finish. I left the bones is cause there super soft and honestly not worth time to sort through. I did however get rid of the majority of skin. I added fresh basil to the sauce vs dry (since I had it!).  I forgot to add tomatoes to the actual cooked burger so I added cucumber instead. Added an extra crunch. The patty was super soft and moist. Amazing dish for a week night quick meal!

These were pretty good, they were moist and held together well.  The lemon flavor was there, but not overpowering. I used the boneless skinless salmon in the sealed pouch from Chicken of the Sea and it was very easy.

I thought this was good, but only 4 stars because it was just a little bland. I added a Tbsp. of dijon mustard and some garlic salt before cooking. I'll definitely make this again and add a few more seasonings. I also added a bit of ketchup to the sauce and it tasted great.

I liked these! Used the recipe exactly, except I added spices generously and replaced the onion with onion powder. Maybe that's why mine stuck so well together? I also baked for 25 minutes at 350 degrees, turning once halfway, to cut down on calories. My small children really liked it!

Made them with dill, also added the mayo to some shredded cabbage and carrots to the dressing to add a bit of crunch. I loved it, my sons liked the burgers, and my 11 month old bout had a fit over them. This will definitely be one of my new go to weeknight meals. Hubby hates salmon so I may have to try with tuna next time.

I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used Matzo Meal and added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning. I had to use about !/2 cup of the Matzo Meal and they turned out quite good, however I think I will add a little salt next time.

Very moist w/ a nice, subtle flavor. Left out oil & grilled on George Foreman grill instead of frying.  Left out red pepper flakes (didn't have them). The sauce was a nice accent, but made two batches, one as written & another w/ 1-2 teaspoon of sweet relish (everyone preferred this version). Served on onion rolls with lettuce, tomato, sliced onion and the sauce. Very tasty, quick & easy!

I think these are delicious! I make a bed of greens or fresh baby spinach and put 2 patties on top. However, it does taste delicious on a French bun...but it is more fattening that way! The sauce to me is perfect. I add a bit more lemon because I am a lemon freak. Just give them a try since they are so easy to prepare. If you are making them as burgers to put on a bun make them bigger and only four patties. Serve with salad greens or sweet potato fries.

Not a fan of canned salmon so I substituted 4 oz of lox instead by chopping it fine and adding it to the mix, FABULOUS!

My future step-son and I enjoyed these salmon burgers, while my fiance practically swallowed his whole. I'm not even sure if he was able to taste his. I was skeptical that they would stick together in patties, because I've had similar problems with other recipes in the past, but they were perfect. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used dried parsley instead of fresh since I didn't have any.

These burgers stuck together and had a good taste.  I'd add a bit more lemon juice to give it a bit more flavor and maybe some extra red pepper flakes to give it a kick but otherwise, a very solid recipe and great on toasted buns!  The mayo/lemon juice/basil sauce is very good.

I tweaked this recipe a bit and serve it all the time. Instead of salmon (hard to find where I live) I used canned tuna and crushed crackers instead of breadcrumbs. Also coriander instead of parsley. The crackers and the eggs really hold these burgers together and they come out great every time! My husband is a super picky eater but he loves my fish burgers. Thanks for the great idea!!

Great!  Even my kids loved them!  Good on the mayo, too.  Kinda strong fishy taste as a reheated leftover, though.  Great in Rhodes rolls if you make them small. (Sliders?)  Thanks!

OMG this was amazing!  The only things I changed were less parsley and I used dried cuz that's all I had and I used dill in place of the basil for the sauce.  The salmon patty itself was quite good but the sauce really makes this sandwich.

A great recipe! Our kids loved it, as did we. If I made it again I would add cilantro as the parsley didn't add much flavor. Drain the salmon very well and they stick together great. Thanks for sharing!

These were so good! Worth writing a review for.  They were much better than any frozen salmon burger I've ever had.  My husband who doesn't care for salmon burgers loved these as well as my two year old son! They were so easy to make, and is a great alternative to beef burgers.

This recipe sounded so good but it turns out my family is not a fan of canned salmon.  The flavors in this recipe are very good.  Just be sure to get the can salmon that is skinless and no scales / bones.  Also, the ingredients listed for the sauce are pretty bland.  Add whatever seasonings you like to spruce it up (dill, garlic, lemon pepper).

I made a slightly smaller batch, and had to estimate some of the amounts.  I used fresh basil--because I had it, but I stuck to the recipe and these were awesome!  We loved them, and they will be going into our regular rotation.

I am so glad I tried this recipe! It's easy and delicious. However I only found 6 oz packets of salmon at the grocery store so I used one of those packets, halved the quantities for the rest of the ingredients, kept the proportions for the mayo the same, and they came out perfect! Didn't fall apart while cooking, but I had to set them in the oil and flip them gently. The way I made it I had exactly 4 patties.

My family loved these burgers.  I found that they were a little wet, and I had to squeeze the excess liquid out of them when forming them into patties.  Also, two of the patties came apart when I turned them, but, as I said, all of my boys really enjoyed them.

These burgers was OK - without the sauce, they were quite dry. With the sauce, they went down well. But they were nothing too exciting. Add a dash of garlic to the sauce.

This might be the only way I cook salmon for awhile.  So easy, and like the recipe title claims, YUMMY! I actually made these for brunch and loved every healthy bite. In general I was more generous w/ the bread crumbs, lemon juice and spices than the recipe calls for. I also added 1/2 tsp of dill that added nicely to the texture and taste.  Tarter Sauce was great w/ the leftovers when I didn't have homemade sauce. I might try this recipe w/ canned tuna as well.

Excellent, fast and easy!  Easy patty-shaping tip:  divide salmon mixture into 4 or 6 portions.  Spoon one portion at a time into a rounded measuring cup and firm into cup with back of spoon.  Tip out of measuring cup into frypan.

My kids absolutely loved these burgers, while my husband and I thought they were just ok, thus the 4 stars. I added old bay seasoning to the salmon. For the tartar sauce, I added chopped onion, parsley, 3 dashes of hot sauce and dill pickle relish. I served the burgers on homemade buns. This isn't a meal I'd make often, but is a keeper for a quick meal.

I'm giving this recipe four stars because hot off the pan, I thought these were great. My only issue is that they were not so great as leftovers (although most fish isn't I suppose) and I'm still on the hunt for a fish recipe that the rest of my family will eat.

I really liked the flavors.  I used a powdered egg replacer in place of the eggs, this is the first salmon patty recipe that tasted good that way.  Thanks!
