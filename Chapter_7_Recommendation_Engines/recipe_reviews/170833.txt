This has an excellent amount of spice-- not too strong, but there is a slight kick to it.

Big hit at the party!  Just enough spice to it.  I used all shrimp and cut them up so they fit nice on the chips.

Very easy to make.  Cut the cayenne to just a couple of pinches because 1 1/2 teaspoons is a lot of spice.  This is our “go to” ceviche recipe.

I also bake it for about 15 minutes on 375 that works the best and then put it under the broiler with the sauce on it for couple minutes and it’s perfect my family loves this recipe

Simple and delicious! I did a rush job and used cooked shrimp and put everything together at one time. When I have time, I will follow the directions as posted... but for now, this quick version is the bomb!
