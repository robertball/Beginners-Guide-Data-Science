Yummy. I took others' suggestions and cut the sugar to less than half a cup, and the cookies were still quite sweet - 1/4 cup of sugar would have been plenty. I used the zest of 1 whole orange, and the orange flavor really took over the cookie - you could barely taste the honey. So, next time I would not go quite so crazy with the orange zest. Overall, very tasty and easy. I brought some to work and they were gone in 60 seconds. Even our neighbor's picky 2.5-year-old loved them.

Excellent texture, very moist and chewy. I love honey - however, I thought they were overly sweet without having much flavor. Maybe the addition of cinnamon would have helped.

This was a great recipe, especially the great honey flavor, and crunchy ouside and chewy inside.  I used cinnamon in place of the orange zest and a fake egg replacement.  Thanks so much!

These were very pleasant flavoured cookies. It is a great way to use up the last little bit of honey. We will make these again. I altered the recipe a little by using butter instead of shortening and 1/2 cup of sugar. Next time I might add a tsp. of orange flavouring as well. Thanks for sharing your cookies with us.

I wasn't impressed with the flavor of these cookies, although I liked the texture. Next time I make these I will add some almond and/or vanilla extract to mellow the orange flavor, which was just too bright.

i enjoyed these cookies a lot. soft & chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside with a nice buttery flavor. i didn't have oranges so i used 1/2 tsp. orange juice in place of the orange zest, and i didn't have raisins, but the cookies came out perfectly. i would love to make these again with raisins!

I Brought these to bible study and they disappeared.  I substituted butter for shortening.  Sugar was decreased to 1/2 cup but could have been cut down to 1/4 cup.  I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour, and then for the 1/2 cup extra because of the butter, I added cornmeal.  I also added chocolate chips.  They had plenty of taste.  This is a great cookie to experiment with!

Yummy and so easy!  Will probably add some chopped nuts into the mix next time and omit the orange zest.

very yummy cookie, I used whole wheat flour and removed 1/2 cup sugar and the cookie was still moist and yummy. The honey adds such a wonderful flavor. This cookie will appear in my cookie jar for the family OFTEN.

These were okay, but I think they would be better with more of a honey taste to them.

I accidentally added more honey than called for; glad I lowered the sugar content a bit.  Unlike others, I did notice the honey flavor and didn't notice the orange peel as much.  Perhaps because I used more honey and used dried orange peel?   At any rate, these are a nice little cookie that are very sweet.  They flatten pretty well but with small cookies you can put several on a cookie sheet; just space them apart.  They are chewy yet a bit crisp all at the same time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good cookie.  One of the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have made.  The whole family loves them.
