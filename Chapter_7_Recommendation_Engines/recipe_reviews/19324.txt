This was really scrumptious! After reading the reviews I took the advice of changing the amounts and used whole 16 oz bag of noodles, 12 oz sour cream and 8 oz cream cheese which I mixed in with the noodles first before layering, then used 1 1/2 lbs of meat.  I also used 26 oz of sauce which I think really made the difference in it not being too dry.  I like lots of garlic too and only used 1/2 white onion that I cooked first!  Fit perfectly in 9x13 pan and the cheese didn't overflow!  Delish and my 5 yr old loved it!

I am an onion lover but this was too much...however, I didn't realize it until I tried a bite.    Plus, it didn't seem that the meat/sauce mixture could cover the amount of noodles the recipe called for (maybe double the meat/sauce or reduce the noodles?) nor did it layer as nicely as I would have hoped.  Not bad...but I'm not sure if I will make again.

The measurements for this recipe aren't even close to serving 11 people. There wasn't even enough of it to fit in a 9x13 pan. I put it in a square 8x8 pan. You'd need to use a 16 oz bag of egg noodles and double everything else except the onions. No way this fits into a 9x13 pan. I just stared at it in disbelief when I started assembling it.

Also, it would be easier to mix the noodles with the sour cream/cream cheese mixture before assembling it. I found several of the noodles once baked were dry with no sauce on them. The taste is ok, it seems to be missing something though. May want to experiment with spices you know you like. I didn't add anything to it, made the recipe just like it appears and I was pretty disappointed. I *may* make it again, but will make some big changes.

This is a family favorite, we keep this in frequent rotation. I always double the recipe and bake in a larger casserole dish.

Made for a potluck, it barely got touched.Not enough sauce, even though I doubled it and cream  mixture was too rich.

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  I accidentally added the shredded cheese to the cream cheese mixture and also added more on top and it was great.  The only thing that I would do differently would be to double the meet and tomato sauce.  There is not nearly enough mixture to make layers in a pan that size.

This was pretty good.  Although, I did not follow the recipe exactly.  Instead of 12 ounces of pasta, I only used half of a 16 ounce bag.  That was plenty!  I didn't have any onions, so I used onion powder.  I used 2 cloves of garlic from a jar already minced.  I left the cream cheese and sour cream sit for a while and then I creamed them together in a mixer.  Then I mixed it together with the pasta.  then I layer the pasta mixture and meat mixture in a 8x8 pan.  And since I love cheese, I used way more then 1 cup of cheddar cheese.

This casserole is DELICIOUS! I did not have green onions so I used oregano, parsley and basil. The kids were not crazy about the texture with the noodles, so next time I will use couscous, rice or maybe even roasted potatoes.

We both loved this. I made it as directed with the following changes - used 1/2 cup sour cream, left out the green onions, added about 1/2 cup canned corn and reduced the noodles to about 8 oz. Seriously yummy stuff and it fit just perfect in my 9x13 pan.

It was great.  I do however agree that there wasn't enough sauce.  I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and it called for 8 oz.  Next time I will use 2 15 oz, and mix the cream cheese/sour cream mixture into the casserole better.  My kids loved it though!!!

This recipe is delicious as long as you double the sauce and add the cream cheese mixture to the noodles before layering.  I used Johnsonville mild Italian sausages (casings removed) instead of beef which gave it a nice flavor and only used half an onion.  This is not the shortest dinner, but it is very good!

A really easy recipe to make! I changed a couple of portions on ingredients per a previous review. I used a 16 oz. bag of egg noodles, 1 1/2 pound of ground beef(drained), 1/2 vandelia onion divided, 29 oz. can of Hunts tomato sauce. I combined the noodles, sour cream, cream cheese, and onion together in a large bowl. The consistency was perfect! My whole family loved it! I think next time I will try spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese.

I love this meal and so did my whole family!  The only change I made was mixing everything together instead of layering so that all of the noodles were covered.

this was very good and easy, but definitely would never fill out a 9x13...I did it in an 8x8 with mozzarella instead of cheddar, no green onions....definitely needed more meat i would say 1 1/2 pounds there were too many noodles and not enough meat..otherwise was really good and easy...the sour cream/cream cheese component was wonderful

I love this casserole!!!  This is one one my very favorite things to make.  The cream cheese, the beef and tomato sauce, the cheese topping...it's all so yummy!  To make preparation simpler, I just do one set of layers: beef, noodles, cream cheese, beef, cheddar topping.

Wish I'd read the comments before I made this....too dry and too creamy. Definitely would cut down on the cream cheese and add tomato or spaghetti sauce. And too many noodles.

This was great, me and my sister made it last night for dinner. We dont usually measure so there was more sourcream than we auactually needed. This was still good, there did not look like there would be enough sauce after we added the 8 oz. so we just added some more untill it looked like there would be enough. There was still a need for more sauce after we were finnished. We did change a few things, we did not use a full onion, we used 3 green onions and we used garlic powder or salt... over all it was great, some of the people had 3rds!

good base recipe. seems bland as written (for my family at least). I don't measure so I just used whatever I had and adjusted it. I added lots of other spices, ommitted green onions, subbed plain yogurt for sour cream since that's all I had. Mixed that in with noodles, topped with meat sauce. I didn't have any cheddar either, so used parm. turned out great!

My husband LOVED it!
We left out the green onions, since my pregnant hormones don't like them much, but the casserole didn't seem to be missing anything.

I thought this recipe was delicious, however I didn't follow it exactly. I started out by using ziti instead of egg noodles because it was all I had. I also omitted all of the onions (my boyfriend doesn't like them) and used chive cream cheese instead for flavor. I used an entire 26oz jar of tomato sauce, instead of the 8oz suggested, and still found it a little dry for my taste. Next time I might start the layers with the pasta instead of the meat and sauce to maybe make it easier to scoop out of the pan and I think some mozzarella cheese on top instead of cheddar would work well. Overall, I really liked this recipe!!!

This recipe was just okay.  I followed it exactly and found that it needs more juice.  I think the next time I make it I will add spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and more of it, because the cream cheese gives it a gummy type texture.  So it just needs a few tweaks and it will be perfect for an easy to make and tasty meal.

this is a very yummy and filling meal I did not have beef broth on hand so I just used water and it was still a big hit!  when it said to put half the cheese in I just put one cup in and then did another cup for the top (my family loves cheese) I used two T of onion powder as a sub for 1 chopped onion  every one loved it and I will be making it again very very soon this is a five star for sure!

I liked it, however, the meat is too thin when layering. Next time, I'm doubling the meat and tomato sauce. Otherwise, perfect. Great flavor combination.

It was too dry and tasted similar to Hamburger Helper.

This was excellent! As I am on a ketogenic diet, I substituted the noodles with sautéed cabbage. And since I was feeling very lazy, I simply mixed all ingredients together instead of layering them. I believe this is a very good recipe for some creativity as well. Mixing some taco seasoning in with the ground beef could give a Tex-Mex flavor. Or mixing in some Italian seasoning and using marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce might be good as well. Thanks for the recipe!

Good flavor but calls for 2 lbs ground beef & at least 16 oz of noodles for 9x13 pan.

This was very good!  I did, however, make a few tweaks after reading some of the reviews.  I added a 26 oz.  jar of spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce called for, doubled the garlic cloves, salt and pepper, a teaspoon of Italian seasoning, and some cayenne.  I also mixed everything together before baking  to make it creamy.  I will be making this again soon, thanks!

Even for a cheese lover like me, this was a bit too cheesy.  I used more tomato sauce than the recipe called for, and it wasn't dry at all.  I may make this again, but will cut the cream cheese in half.

Everyone liked it but I was a bit disappointed. I did modify quantities to feed 4 adults. I used 1.25lbs of ground turkey thigh instead of hamburger, and 14 oz of tomato sauce. I mixed the chees and sour cream first then stirred in the noodles. It turned out tasty but a bit dry.  I'll make it again though!

After reading several other reviews, which I always do prior to making a recipe, I followed some of the advice and made these changes. I browned 2 pounds of ground chuck and the chopped onion, used two 8-oz. cans of tomato sauce, omitted the green onions, used fat-free cream cheese and sour cream since that is what I had on hand, and mixed everything together except for the shredded cheese.  I placed the mixture in a 9 x 13-inch pan and sprinkled the shredded cheese on top. We enjoyed this dish very much, and I will make it again with these changes.

Whole family loved it.  I used ground turkey in place of the ground beef, because I had some in the freezer.  I also used diced tomatoes with chiles in place of tomato sauce.  Kids loved it.  Was definitely comfort food.

This recipe did not impress. For the total amount of time spent on both the prep and baking, the result was only okay. It was edible, but it was bland. I made it as written. The meat needs more flavor, onion and garlic alone dont do it, perhaps some salt and pepper. For me the predominant flavor was cream cheese and the least noticable was the tomato sauce. It needed more sauce. Oh, and one more thing. I cannot imagine how this might make 11 servings. 8 servings at best.

Loved it!  I used only a spoonful of cream cheese and substituted the rest with feta cheese.  Left out the green onions and used penne, since I didn't have the right egg noodles.  Excellent!

Followed the changes recommended for increasing sauce - I used canned pasta sauce - also mixing sour cream and cream cheese together with the noodles before layering with the hamburger ingredients.   Very good!   Plan to make this again.   Yummy.

My "I hate casseroles!" family loved it!  Don't change a thing and you'll have a winner.  Next time I might add some frozen green beans or corn to give it a veggie kick.  Will make this again... thanks!

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added a whole jar of prego spaghetti sauce to the meat. I also mixed the cream cheese and green onions with the egg noodles before layering which I think made it mix a lot easier. I took this dish to work and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

Using this recipe as is, a 9x13 pan is too big; not enough meat for the amount of noodles. I think 2 lbs of hamburger is needed. This recipe is ok, but I don't think I will make it again

I changed a few things with this recipe.   I used Johnsonville Italian sausage instead of ground beef.   I also used 2 8 oz cans of tomato sauce. I also added 1 tbl spoon of Italian seasoning.   It is yummy!!!  I will def make this again.

I made this last night and followed the reviews of others...used a 29oz. can of tomato sauce, ended up using almost a lb. of ground sirloin and 1.25lb of ground turkey (I had the sirloin already), about 12 oz. sour cream, and mixed the cheese mixture with the noodles before putting together the casserole. I thought it was a delicious, easy meal and we're freezing the rest (we have a baby coming any day!).

I used 1 lb turkey Italian sausage, 1 lb ground beef, (1/3 fat) chive and onion cream cheese, and a 11.5 oz can of V8 instead of tomato sauce. Browned the onion and garlic with the meats, then added the v8, sour cream, and cream cheese. While that was simmering, I parboiled 4 cups of egg noodles for 3 minutes. Then I drained the noodles and immediately put them in with the meat mixture to soak up the juices while they finished cooking for 5 more minutes. Finally added the cup of shredded cheddar and did not bake it. It turned out scrumptious, much like a homemade hamburger helper. Under 400 calories for a one cup serving and it yielded exactly 8 cups.

I really enjoyed this. However, I think 6-8 ounces of noodles is definitely enough. I used chopped up onions and mixed it in with turkey meat and used almost a whole jar of sauce along with garlic powder. I put some noodles on the bottom then the meat mixture then the sour cream and cream cheese in the middle then more noodles and meat..and layered the top with cheddar cheese. (I made it healthier with low fat cheddar cheese cream cheese and sour cream)

This was ok. The measurements are definately off. I added an extra can of tomato sauce, but it was still a little too dry. I think less noodles would help this recipe. There also wasn't enough ground beef- the noodles took over the recipe as did the sour cream mixture.  I also added extra garlic, and salt and pepper. But it still needed something. It was very easy to put together though.

The portions were way off.  If I make it again I will quadruple the sauce.  I had to add 5 oz. rotel and some diced tomatoes to it and it was still too dry.  I also added a green pepper and heated it in the crockpot.  I didn't layer it, I just mixed it all together, since other reviewers said they had trouble layering.
