I'm always looking for a good recipe with artichokes, and here is one that is company worthy.  Allow plenty of time for prep, if you don't have the roast butterflied for you.  Also,  The stuffing is actually double the amount that can be stuffed inside.  Perhaps you could add it to the roasting pan about halfway through the suggested time.  If you don't cut the stuffing ingredients in half, it would be best to use a dutch oven to prepare the stuffing.  I had a hard time combining all the ingredients in my 12 inch skillet.  My roast had a  fat cap, and I roasted fat cap up, so it browned nicely.  I wondered about the lack of salt in the stuffing, since I used the Swanson salt-free chicken broth, but the bread crumbs had plenty of salt for the recipe.  Cooking and prep times are fairly accurate, but be sure to let the roast rest a bit before slicing.  This would be a lovely fall dinner with some baked sweet potatoes and a simple green salad.

I’m always looking for a new way to make a loin. This recipe was absolutely delicious but I did make a few changes. I used a sweet Onion instead of green onion and fresh fresh baby Bella mushrooms. I used Stove Top chicken flavored stuffing which was savory when you added the other ingredients and Herbs de Provence instead of parsley. I also did put Kosher Salt, as well as the garlic powder and pepper on the outside of the loin once it was stuffed. I’d never butterflied a loin but watched a YouTube video and made it happen. The results were delicious. Hubby approved.

This was very good. We had center cut pork loins so I lined a baking dish with half the stuffing mix placed the pork atop the mix then put the rest of the stuffing mix on top of the pork. I covered it with foil and baked for the suggested time. Turned out wonderful!

The stuffing was delicious but the outside of the pork needed to have more seasoning. The recipe only called for pepper and garlic powder but I'd add salt.

This is fantastic! I used fresh mushrooms. Other than that, I didn't change a thing. Family loves it!

I had a full center loin which was almost 10 lbs so doubled the stuffing package (breadcrumbs) but kept all the other ingredient volumes the same. I also added onions and celery. Just the right amount of stuffing, but it was a little too mushy. Overall dish was a big hit! A very simple dish to make and short cook time.

I was really hoping that this recipe would be good.  I love artichokes and so does my husband but sadly, this was not that great.  This recipe made a ton of stuffing with no mention of what to do with the rest of it.  I ended up filling the entire bottom of the pan with it.  The meat itself was tender and delicious, but no one liked the stuffing.  It was mushy and not quite what I thought it would be.  Wouldn't make again.
