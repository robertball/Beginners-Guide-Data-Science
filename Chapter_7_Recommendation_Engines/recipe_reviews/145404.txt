I was looking for something a little different and this definitely hit the spot. I even forgot to add the two extracts and it still came out good. Be aware that this is a very dense cake...it won't rise much in the oven. On the bright side that made it really easy to get out of the cake pans. The mix of the two flavors of frosting was very good and it was all pretty easy to put together. My four year old son just rated it "the best frosting cake ever" lol.

I think we need a bigger cake... This cake is quite nummy but a horrible MESS! The cake itself is very thin and dense and the icing is on absolute overload. I had to switch the plate I was icing on three times because it kept pooling over! In then end I even had some left over in my hair. Haha. Anyway the cake's flavor is definitely different (the unique spice blend was what lured me to this recipe) it almost reminded me of French Toast but the lemon extract gives it a pinch of zest that separates it from any breakfast specialty or other cake. The icing topping it all off though was definitely THE icing. It's the only chocolate flavored icing I've ever thoroughly enjoyed perhaps too much. =)

Full disclosure: I made vegan substitutions for this recipe. Specifically I replaced the milk with soy milk the butter with Earth Balance and the egg with Ener-G egg replacer. However something about the proportions here is way off. I attempted to divide the cake batter between two pans but I couldn't even coat the surface of one 8" pan with half of the batter so I ended up just using all of the batter to bake one layer for about 40 minutes. I also used 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar for the 1/3 cup of "butter." I ended up just layering the chocolate frosting on top of the plain as I had only made one layer and I had to add more hot water to the icing when I added the cocoa to get it to mix. Personally I also think the flavors are a bit odd but for what it's worth somehow I'm still craving its lemony-ness today!
