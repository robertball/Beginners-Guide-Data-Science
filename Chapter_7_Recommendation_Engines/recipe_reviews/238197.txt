I grew up in Ohio/PA Amish Country and worked in an Amish restaurant & bakery so I will attest that these are the real deal, authentic Amish peach dumplings.
I made this exactly as written, and it worked out fine, however next time, I will use self-rising flour instead of all-purpose, because I feel that it works better in these types of recipes. The Amish don't use a lot of seasonings or spices other than salt & pepper, so you may want to top these with a sprinkle of cinnamon & sugar if you like that sort of flavor. Otherwise this is a great recipe that I will make again.

I’m sorry, but the dumplings are terrible. They were very hard and dry. The fresh peaches were great, but they were great before I cooked them.  Don’t waste your time on this recipe. I was lured in because of the total time to prep and cook. I will spend more time and do something different tomorrow night. Glad I only made 1/2 recipe.

I grew up on this exact recipe in Oklahoma. I always thought it was an old fashioned Czecholsovakian recipe. DELISCIOUS!

I grew up enjoying this as a kid during visits to my grandma's in Kentucky. She isn't Amish so I always thought this was a southern recipe. Regardless of the origin, it's absolutely delicious! I add cinnamon and a little nutmeg to the dumpling dry ingredients. One thing I would suggest is to make sure your pot is large enough to accommodate the expansion of the dumplings. I had to change pots midway through to avoid a boil over (and a scolding from the wife).  

I use canned peaches (2) in light syrup. I drain the syrup into a measuring cup, then add enough water for 2 cups. I also reduce the sugar called for by about a tablespoon or two, due to the light syrup (to taste).  For a real treat, use the raspberry flavored peaches (made by Del Monte) if you can find them.
