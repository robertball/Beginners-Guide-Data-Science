Excellent flavor but texture a bit mushy (toasting took care of that in fact this makes great toast). Next time I make it I'll reduce the water amount.

Nice loaf; the raisins are a yummy touch. One loaf came out huge; I think next time I'll divide the dough into two loaves as it rose rather high very quickly. I also think I will add more raisins since I find myself wanting more of them. Very easy very nice; will probably make again. Thanks for the recipe!

A crowd pleaser. Took the time to hunt down golden syrup here in AZ. So very worth it.
