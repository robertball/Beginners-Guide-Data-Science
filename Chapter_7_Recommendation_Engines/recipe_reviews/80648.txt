My family is Grenadian and we eat Pelau too. We don't use coconut milk but it could only make this great family favorite better.Very easy to make since it's all in one pot.

I had to use kidney beans in place of the pigeon peas, but otherwise made this to spec. It's unbelievably simple and good. I look forward to enjoying this for many meals to come. Nice recipe!

I ended up using the entire can (~1.25 cups) of coconut milk and approximately a cup of beef broth (which really boosted the flavour)-the rice need much more liquid. The recipe is mild and the milk gives it a beautiful creamy texture. While I wasn't thrilled with the result, my husband quite liked it. I think this will be a "back-pocket" recipe for any time I need to feed someone who isn't a fan of spice but loves protein and rice!

Well a lot of things are missing. The beef or chicken should be seasoned with fresh season like garlic, chive, celery, and pimento pepper. Seasoning salts can also be used. The meat had to be tender before adding the rice, peas and pumpkin. Coconut milk isn't necessary but would enhance the flavor. You can also use both beef and chicken

My mother is a Trini, but she has been sick for years and doesn't cook anymore, but this Pelau is just like hers. Thank you for posting this recipe. She sometimes used to use salted pig tails.

I tried this recipe over the weekend, it was a hit. My mother-inlaw loved it. My wife suggested to use a little thyme to give it a more authentic taste. I used kidney beans instead of pigeon peas, I also put corn and green peas,  to me this added to the color along with the flavor.

We didn't like this recipie. I had to use a different type of bean, because i couldnt find this one in our stores, and the beef i used was very bad, so don't take my word as absolute.  The recipie might come out better for someone else.  I think it could have used some more liquid in it though as well.

This was wonderfully simple and very tasty.  I didn't have coconut milk so substituted evaporated milk in which I soaked a tablespoon of unsweetened shredded coconut.  I also used kidney beans.  A healthy treat we will definitely have again!

This is so deliciious.  You can make it with or without the coconut milk and it is still good.  Another variation is to use chicken broth or beef consume broth instead of water.

This is a slightly sweet & creamy beef and rice dish. I had to cook longer because the brown rice I used, called for cooking for 50 minutes:which worked out well to tenderize my stew meat. I could not find "pigeon peas" in my grocery store, so I had to leave out. I just added more carrots. I am not sure if I would of liked as well with a "bean" flavor added, anyway. The next time, I will try adding some spices. I think a little garlic and some bouillion granules might have made it a 5 star.   Also, I think adding other vegetables ( ie: brocolli,summer squash are 2 ideas) would be very good in it, too. i served with Romaine and Mandarin Orange Salad and it paired VERY well. Thank you, Triniredlocks for the great recipe and Pixie2 for the suggestion to make!

Made this without the beef or the pigeon peas...served "Trinidad Stewed Chicken" from this site on top of it. Super good. My dinner guest asked "what did you put in the rice, it was so good!"

Loved the flavor, even though we left out the pigeon peas.  Based on past reviews, I automatically added 1 cup beef broth, in addition to the water, and a full 13.5 oz of coconut milk instead of 1 cup.  The rice needed twice the time to cook to our desired texture, and the beef would probably have been more tender if I cooked it longer.

This is good. I found canned pigeon peas but I was afraid my little girls would decide not to eat any of it since they are one a "don't like beans" kick lately. So I skipped those but added peas. I adapted this to make it in my pressure cooker and it made the beef very tender. For each cup of brown rice, use 1 1/4 cup liquid. I added frozen peas at the very end and just stirred them in and let them cook while I poured drinks and got dishes ready. The slightly sweet taste and creamy mouth feel make a unique and delicious dinner. Thanks for sharing your heritage Triniredlocks.

The meat needs to be seasoned / marinated before cooking.  Also, rice needs double the amount of liquid to rice; brown rice sometimes more. This recipe doesn't call for enough liquid.

this rice is very sappy and not very appealing. You can dice carrots and a tomato for color.

I did not care for this recipe. It's bland, and the rice takes longer than the recipe says.

I substituted the brown rice for 1 sweet potato and 1 regular potato. It was still very delicious, just needed a pinch of salt and pepper. Next time I will try the rice, but it was a very simple meal to make and it was enjoyed.

A meal that took my family by surprise, sweet, savory and unique. Very good! Be careful with the rice, some brown rice takes more liquid and a lot more time to cook!!

I couldn't find fresh pigeon peas and I don't like the canned variety, so I made this with regular frozen peas. We didn't care for it much - the beef and coconut milk just tasted really weird together. Also 25 minute cook-time for stewing beef?? I cooked mine for a couple of hours before adding the rice and veggies. Thanks anyway.

Easy and delicious, all in one pot with just a few simple ingredients.  I will definitely make this again.  The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is that, like another reviewer, the liquid called for in the recipe wasn't enough to cook the rice.  Maybe I missed something, but I had to about double the water and coconut milk.  Delicious end result, though.  Thanks for a great recipe!
