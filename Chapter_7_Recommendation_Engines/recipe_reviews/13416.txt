My mom made this for us when I was growing up and it's still a favorite. I've made my own modifications, though, which make it even easier.   1) Instead of Velveeta, I buy a bag of shredded Mexican style cheese. Bags of shredded cheese are typically 8 oz. on the nose.  2) Instead of shredding carrots myself, I buy them pre-shredded. Quantity should be somewhere between 3/4 and 1 cup. 3) Cut the butter in half, reduce the flour to about a tablespoon, and use ground bison instead of beef for a lower fat version. 4) Soy milk subs for the regular milk just fine. 5) Occasionally, I'll reduce the potatoes and make up the difference with cauliflower.  6) This is where it gets blasphemous: After you brown the beef, just dump everything but the sour cream into a crock pot and let it cook on low all day. That butter/flour bit? It's all just going to melt into the soup anyway! I swear it comes out the same and it's a lot less work. Sour cream should be added just before serving.

AWESOME!!! My husband always raved about a Cheesburger Soup he eats at a local restaurant during his lunch breaks, so I decided to find a recipe. I used this one and the only changes I made were that I used fresh peeled and cubed potatoes rather than hash browns and I added more meat. He said it was better than any he's ever had! I had never heard of Cheesburger Soup, but you can bet I, too, am a fan now. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this tonight and the family really enjoyed it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was because I had to guess at the type of hash browns that it was supposed to have (I used the Simply Potato Shreds that are found in the dairy aisle)
Very quick and easy

Great Soup! We loved it! I cooked the beef & drained.  Then I added the beef, chicken broth, 2 c. of beef broth (I omitted the milk), vegetables, potatoes & spices.(I shredded my own potatoes.)  I did not use any margarine.  I thickened the soup & added low-fat Velveeta cheese.  Using fat-free sour cream this makes a Weight Watchers entree worth 5 points if you make it for 7 servings.

While this is not exactly gourmet cuisine (come on, it has Velveeta!) it is really delicious.  It's wonderful creamy comfort food for a cold day.  I added a dash of cayenne, and didn't have the sour cream, but I'll add it next time.  I also made it in the crockpot, sauteeing everything first and then tossing it in.  Everyone loved it, even my hates-everything five year old. This dish will be a new regular.

This was SO good! I was really surprised at how this turned out... not at all what I was expecting... much better! I followed the recipe exactly, except for omitting the milk because I was out. I think next time I will skip the flour because it was almost too thick. Thank you, thank you!

This was a hit.  Only things I did different were to start the veggies and add the meat to the same pot - veggies stayed in while the meat browned.  And I added one handful of shredded cheddar at the end.  Thick, yummy, and filling.  Tastes nothing like a cheesburger, but more like meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  Will make again.

This soup was pretty good.  I did make a few changes, I sauteed the beef with garlic, worcestershire and dried parsley to give it some flavor.  I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese and completely omitted the milk, which left the soup thick and stew-like.  I served it with cornbread and we all enjoyed the meal.

I made soup without too many changes and it was VERY bland.  I left out the carrots and celery.  I changed it up before serving and was much better - after a few days in the icebox it was even tastier.  Next time I will brown the hashbrowns, onions and green chilis with garlic.

Some reviewers have suggested skipping the roux (flour and butter) but its definitly necessary. Do not skip or soup will be way too watery.

1 Jar (8oz) Tostitos Queso Dip instead of processed cheese
Added two cans of Rotel (tomato & green chili)
1 can of diced green chilis

Easy and yummy- two of my favorites!! I made it in the slow cooker. I did change the proportions a bit, mostly because I did not want a lot of ingredients left over. I used 4 cups of hash browns, and 4 cups of chicken broth, and 16 oz of velveeta (can you even buy only 8 oz?) I also just added whatever sour cream I had- think it was about 1/2 cup. I really don't think you can go wrong with these ingredients. We ate it with sister schubert rolls and garnished with sharp cheddar cheese.

Love It! Added 3-4 more carrots, used 3-4 stalks celery, shredded hash browns, and about 12 oz. cheese instead of 8 oz.  Served in sour-dough bread bowls from St. Louis Bread Co. (Panera)  My family loves it and we get in all our veggies!

For what it is, a simple comforting soup, it is very yummy. I used shredded cheddar and swiss instead of processed cheese.

Very good comfort food.  Excellent soup for a cold winter's day.  I used the frozen shredded hash browns and it was yummy.

My mom used to make us triple batch pots of this soup in the winter, it was everyone's favorite.  I followed this recipe exactly but I found after I added in my browned meat and hash browns there was no moisture (liquid) left in the pot.  I had to add an extra 1/3 C. chicken broth and an extra 1 C. of milk.  Even after adding that, it was still a very thick soup!  However, the taste was great, almost like my mom used to make.  Yum!

VERY, VERY GOOD. Great comfort food. I have made this soup before using a different recipe. I doubled serving size and made a couple  of changes. I used chopped bell pepper instead of celery (more flavor), 4 large "butter red" potatoes, finely chopped, instead of frozen shredded hashbrowns. I also added minced garlic and fresh minced parsley instead of dried, 1 - 15 oz can diced tomatoes with garlic/oregano and basil, undrained, 1 - 14.5 oz can chicken broth and 2 -14.5 oz cans of beef broth. Other than that, basically followed the recipe. Whole family loves this one.

I made this for my family and they really liked it.  My children all asked for seconds and at least one wanted thirds.  Sadly we had no leftovers.  I didn't have the processed cheese so I added a can of cheddar cheese soup and a little less milk.  I was very pleased with the soup and will most likely make it again.

This is almost exactly the same recipe as cheeseburger soup I on this site but I like the addition of hashbrowns better than cubed potatoes.

When I tasted this, the soup seemed to be missing something.  I added about 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 1/2 tsp. dry mustard and 1 tsp. garlic powder.

All in all, much better than a recipe I had and lost.  It used cheddar cheese soup as the base.

I have made this many times over the years and my family absolutely loves it. Great comfort food on a cold winters night. When I make it for our church's soup suppers it is always one of the first soups to go. We have had families whose kids "don't like any kind of soup" love this and look forward to having it on the menu . My recipe calls for 1 quart of peeled, cubed, fresh potatoes, but when I make make 8-10 times that amount for church it is wonderful to use the southern-style (diced) frozen hash browns potatoes(shreds are too small).

Great soup!  My entire family really liked it... from my husband to my 3-yo. 
I actually doubled the cheese (went way lo-cal, ha ha) and increased the broth by another cup.
I will definately make again.

This was alright...I added some shredded sharp cheddar because I was thinking that it would need a bit more of a kick than just with the processed cheese...and I was right.  The family enjoyed it, but I will most likely tweak it further, with more flavorful ingredients, the next time I make it.

Not bad.  Used peeled cubed potatoes.  Simmmered til tender.  Added just a tbl or two of sour cream and more broth than milk.  Still quite rich.

This soup was delicious!!  I seasoned the meat with garlic and seasoning salt and left the carrots out.  I used 3 potatoes(chopped), instead of the hashbrowns.  My husband said it tasted like something he would get at a nice restaurant.

My kids first had this at a potluck and raved. So I got the recipe and then lost it.  This is great! Young and old love it.  My aspiring chef daughter tweaked it tonight and added 1 tsp. of dijon mustard to it.  Gave it a new dimension!

Delicious!  I didn't have hash browns on hand so I shredded three medium potatoes instead and this worked fine.  I also used a combination of Velveeta and shredded cheddar cheese to give the soup a more cheesy flavor.

Ok, I thought this soup was just very okay. It wasn't awesome but was not bad either. Maybe if I had made it during the winter it would have impressed me more. And, I think personally it would have been alot better with hunks of potato rather than shredded hash browns. For me, they just didn't hold up real well and most ended up turning sort of mashed. I like the idea of this soup so may try it again with a few adjustments.

Everyone in my family enjoyed this.  I did skip the flour/butter part and just added a little cornstarch to thicken it.  I added garlic, regular chopped potatoe's (instead of hash brown's) and more cheese.

Overall very good! I needed a quick soup for a church dinner and this worked perfect! I omitted the sour cream at the end; both my bf and I thought it was better without it. Served with french bread.

I was initally turned off by the ingredient 'processed cheese' b/c we don't like the taste of Velveeta, but I happened to have 8 oz leftover from a previous recipe. We're so glad I made this!  It was soooo yummy even with the Velveeta! It doesn't have a 'processed cheese' taste at all.  Omitted the celery and sour cream.  No one will ever know.

I ground the beef first and drained any grease. Then I just tossed everything together. I mixed the flour with the broth to make sure no clumps and tossed it with everything else. Once everything was melted and started to boil I reduced heat and let simmer covered for about 5 minutes and it was done! Was super yummy and flavorful! Took all of 30-45 min from start to finish.

Followed recipe almost exactly except I omitted the sour cream and used extra sharp cheddar instead of processed cheese. I had some fat free half and half that I needed to use up so subbed it for milk which is why I didn't think the sour cream was necessary. Good soup.

This is a great base but you'd be surprised what adding a can of diced tomatoes and a splash of mustard will do to this soup! I also substituted the 'cheese food' with just a can of Campbell's cheddar soup.

This is an awesome recipe. However, I did make a few changes. Did not add milk and flour. Used 1/2 bag Potatoes O'Brien, and get this...French Fried Onions for a twist when I served it!!! Yummy! Will make again!

Really good soup.  I doubled the recipe, as I had 2 lbs of ground beef.  I didn't have hash browns or processed cheese, so I used diced potatoes, 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup and 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese soup.  Yum!  The only thing I might do differently is add more cheese, or maybe I'll try to processed cheese, to make it really cheesy.  This one will be in my regular winter soup rotation.

I made this the other night for the kids and I so I only used a half pound of ground beef since they aren't huge meat eaters. Personally, I think that worked out better. For the second step of the recipe, I let it simmer for a good 45 minutes to ensure the veggies would be undetectable to a couple of my anti-crunchy vegetable eaters. I did end up having to add some additional chicken broth at the end, as the soup was really thick, but we all loved it and ate every last bit of it:) I will make this again.

Delicious, although very fattening.  I didn't add any butter, but instead threw the veggies in when the beef was browning, then drained whatever grease I could. Added minced garlic, more veggies, 1 t. mustard powder and 2 T Worcestershire sauce, used diced potatoes instead of hashbrowns, and a cornstarch slurry instead of the butter/flour thickener.  I might even add a can of diced tomatoes next time. Very, very tasty.  I'll definitely make this again, and hopefully the kids will eat it next time.

There's a local restaurant that serves a cheeseburger soup that my husband and son love but I never made it at home because I wasn't wild about it; it was more like cheese dip in consistency and richness.  Made this soup as written with the exception of decreasing the veggies for my picky family and it was excellent: flavorful without being overwhelming.  I served it with crusty french bread and everyone was talking about how they would eat the leftovers.  From my family, that's five stars.

This is adapted from an award winning recipe on another site, much of the directions word for word, ingredients even listed in same order. Wouldn't have noticed if I didn't read them back to back. A difference that makes this one better for me is more meat. The other uses fresh potatoes, so that is a preference difference for who is making it.

Amazing! My family loved it! I added an extra cup of chicken broth and milk to stretch it for my family. I also used hamburger seasoning on the meat with a couple of tablespoons of worshire sauce to make it tasted more cheeseburgery. :-)

Since going on our low-carb diet, I modified this recipe to use 3 c. chopped cauliflower instead of potatoes. All other ingredients the same. I didn't tell my kids and they never even noticed the difference!

This was soooo easy to make. I diced the carrots, omitted the celery (didn't have any, added some bottled minced garlic, 2 (14.5 oz each) cans chicken broth, used 1 cup extra hash brown potatoes (I used the cubed not the shredded), used a little extra processed cheese (which I cubed) and added a little Worcestershire sauce (has suggested by previous reviewers). It turned out great; although I will probably use less garlic next time (I used about 3 tsp.). Still a great base recipe, super fast and easy. Thanks for posting.

I actually forgot to add the milk but it turned out great anyway (and I probably saved a few calories!)  I also used Jalapeno Velveeta which added quite a little ZING!

Not too exciting...I left out the celery and carrots because I didn't have any in the fridge (although carrots would have been a nice addition).  I shredded my own potatoes instead of using premade hash browns and added extra seasonings to the meat (Creole seasoning, seasoned salt and garlic powder).  I won't make this again.

I thought this was super easy and very good.  I had to give it only four stars because the rest of my family did not like this.

This is great!  I used the Mexican Velveeta to add a little bit of spice to it.  I will definately make this again!

I serve this soup with Unblieveble Rolls (Also from this website) and they are perfect dinner for my family. As we are not a 'fan' of sour cream I subtitute it with low fat plain yogurt and the result were super.

My sister-in-law made this for us and we loved it and now I've made it a number of times and I've passed it on to friends.

I used the wrong hashbrowns for sure. They were cheese ones and they dissolved into the soup to make it really thick and only taste like funny hashbrowns. Wish I could have tasted it like it's supposed to. Might try it again.

Good soup and easy, too. I used turkey kielbasa and shredded cheddar cheese (instead of the ground meat and processed cheese). I added some garlic to the sauteed veggies and sprinkled scallions on top.

THIS IS THE BEST!!! Initially I thought this recipie was "OK" but the addition of the sour cream made all of the difference in the world, served with hot bread from the machine it is the perfect comfort or "I have a cold" food. Yummers.
