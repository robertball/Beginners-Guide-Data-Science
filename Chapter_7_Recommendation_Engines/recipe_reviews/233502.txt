The citrus y-sweet 'n spicy flavor makes this one of my favorite pork stews.   A couple of things to note about this recipe.  First, the serving size as recommended results in very, very tiny servings.   That’s because this is a Weight Watcher recipe that’s been slightly altered.  The second thing worth mentioning is that if you make this in a crock pot, be prepared for it to be over done and the sweet potatoes turned to mush, especially if you dice the potatoes and pork  in the recommended cube size.   I personally do not use the crock pot when making this.  I put everything in a heavy pot, cover, and let it simmer on med-high heat on the stove.  It’s ready to go in less than an hour and to keep the sweet potatoes from getting too soft, I chop them in larger pieces.

It was good. My family liked it & my 6-year old son came back for more. It was a bit bland for me, but I added taco sauce on top & that was about right. We served this over rice with cilantro & a dollop of sour cream. Would be great in tacos or with tortilla chips. If I were to make it again, I'd likely add onion or chives, more salt & more lime-citrusy flavor. Also, I think it would be better baked in the oven so that the meat and potatoes would crisp up.

We really loved this! So simple to make and tasted great. I did read the reviews befotehand and added a little extra seasoning to it as well as a chopped green bell pepper.... and chopped the sweet potatoes into larger 1" cubes so they didnt get mushy. I was short on time but still wanted to use my slow cooker, so I did 3 hours on high then turned it down to low for the last hour. The pork was tender and the potatoes were perfect. I served it like a stew over jasmine rice.

This was quite good. I threw in some chopped red onion because I had some to use up. I think next time I'd use a few less sweet potatoes and add a bit of green veggie

This is one of my (very picky) family's new favorite recipes!  I tried adding more lime once, as I love a citrus tone, but it was TOO much. I recommend that even if you love lime flavor, keep it to about the recipe's amount.

Ok, so I didn't have the canned tomatoes with chilis.  I used 1/2 fresh chopped tomato and no chilis. And forgot to add cilantro.  I used a pork steak, cut into several pieces.  This didn't smell very appetizing, but when I bit into the first piece of meat, it tasted amazingly good.  The pork was soo tender, the potatoes great.  I'm going to make it again.

A real success, we devoured it all in once ! Served with rice which was perfect to enjoy all the nice sauce. I followed the recipe exactly but for the fact that I used a pressure cooker (so cooked it only 1 hour total, starting with frozen meat !) and doubled the spices and juices. Will definitively make it again.

I love this dish! I do add a little more cumin than called for, and I use the Rotel diced tomatoes with cilantro and lime, and then another can of the original or mild. This makes 20oz tomatoes, but such a good flavor! I have made this dish several times, and have doubled it before, so we can have leftovers. I serve it over rice with cilantro and a little sour cream. Yum!

Tasty and filling, the flavours were wonderful. I did a couple of substitutions dictated by what I had on hand: used mango juice instead of orange; regular tinned tomatoes with a little diced jalapeno; and omitted the salt and cilantro. I served it over yellow rice, made with a recipe I had, and everyone loved that combination. This is also healthy, being low in fat , sugar and sodium.

I Loved this recipe!  I made it close to as described but made the following changes.  I used fire roasted tomatoes for salsa, added a yellow onion, added a packet of Sazon con achiote, and a little bit of mojo.  I douubed the recipe and it was not that much.  I also used my electric pressure cooker, as i got it for the holidays and wanted to use it.  I cooked it for about an hour, and it came out perfect.  My husband asked me if "I could make this every day!"  

Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

This is the first thing I made in my new Instant Pot! I chose this recipe because I wanted to make a quick dinner using some pork loin and sweet potatoes I had on hand, and, along with the great ratings, this one sounded like a good bet for pressure cooking. I didn’t have tomatos with green chili’s, so I used plain diced tomatoes and added 6 whole dried chili peppers to the mix. I didn’t have fresh cilantro, so I added 1.5 Tbs whole coriander seeds. I cut the sweet potatoes into 1” pieces as other reviewers suggested. I cooked using the Instant Pot stew setting, which pressurized the pot and cooked for 35 minutes. It came out great! Good flavor and extremely tender pork. The sweet potatoes were very soft, mushy even, but deliciously infused with other flavors in the recipe and we liked them a lot. I will use red pepper flakes instead of whole chili peppers if I make it again because the whole peppers were too spicy if you happened to eat a piece of one instead of removing it. Otherwise It was fine. I served it over brown rice and quinoa with a side of sautéed broccoli,crimini mushrooms,and red peppers.

Similar in texture to chili. This is a hearty and zesty stew. Next time I'll go 2 tbl spoons of lime. I suggest salting at the table instead of during cooking. The sweet potato and lime needs to be the boss flavor with that cumin. Salt only to taste. Great recipe!

This turned out so well! I had recently been to a Cuban restaurant with pork I loved that seemed like it could be done in a slow cooker, so I went on the hunt for a recipe and came across this one. Full disclosure, since I was only looking for a pork recipe I didn't add the sweet potatoes this first time, but it turned out so flavorful and juicy! Can't wait to try it with the sweet potatoes another time!

Tasty and pork was very tender.  Used Acorn Squash instead of Sweet Potato and Lemon instead of Lime juice - what I had on hand.  Served over brown rice.

Delicious! The whole family enjoyed this, even our youngest who likes nothing new the first time around. I made it on the stove rather than in the slow cooker because I was concerned that the sweet potatoes would overcook, and they turned out perfectly. The dish was extremely tasty, filling, and made the entire house smell fantastic. Thank you for sharing! :)

Absolutely delicious!  I used a cast iron Dutch Oven, cooked very slow for several hours.  Took suggestions of cutting bigger pieces of pork and potatoes and double cumin.  The combination of all the seasonings was wonderful.  Next time I'll serve it over rice like is picture.

10-stars as it couldn't have been any tastier!

If i could i'd do about 3-1/2 stars. But it was more good than not. It probably would have tasted better if I prepared it in the crockpot (cooked in a pot on the stove) like the direction however otherwise besides not using as much cilantro, I followed the recipe as is.  I used pork tenderloin which was tender but personally I would have liked a bit more zest or flavor. Its definitely a good base recipe but I would double or even triple the spices to give it more of a kick,

We liked this very much. Had to improvise on the oj. I had a bottle of mojo marinade and used that instead. Followed the rest.  We ate it all before I could take pictures! Thanks for the post MONIQUEWS!

A crock pot meal that taste better the second day! Added more garlic cloves and I think next time I might try to get a separate can of green chiles as I think it could have used a bit more. I also used bone in pork chops because it was what I had although I would recommend a different cut perhaps just even thicker chops. I love Latin food and this reminded me of the Cuban restuarant in Miami so this is a keeper for us!

I forgot to add the cilantro at the end, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. Hubby doesn't like sweet potatoes, but he liked this dish. Baby liked it, too. And it was so easy to make!!!! I didn't need to cook mine for as long as the directions specified. I checked it after 5 hours and it was already a bit overcooked.

Super-easy and very delicious!  I love this because I was able to whip it up with ingredients I always have on-hand.  I used a skirt steak instead of pork and I used fresh tomatoes and canned green chile, in place of the canned tomatoes with green chiles.  ¡Muy sabroso!  Gracias.

This is a keeper.  The sweet potatoes retained their color and texture.  A little spicy with a hint of citrus.  Delicious!
