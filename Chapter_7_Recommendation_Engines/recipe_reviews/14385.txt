Great stuff. When I am out of Salad Supreme this still is pretty good stuff by adding individual spices listed on the SS bottle. After refrigerating overnight, the day I am serving I sometimes add a bit more salad dressing. Also, you can interchange lots of ingredients: veggies, cubes of cheese, pepperoni slices or ham cubes, etc. This is easily customizable.

Great Recipe. I cater occasionally and use this all the time. 1 full recipe will serve 40 or so people with other salads available ie potato, tossed salad, chips etc. I half the cherry tomatoes, add shredded carrots, celery and use only 1/2 cup dressing and 3 TB salad supreme and give out the recipe at every occasion. Make the day before and the place in zip lock. Thanks for the great recipe Cyndie.

This recipe was good, though for my family I omitted the olives and yellow pepper and added cucumber.  It was crisp and juicy and went fast.  Thanks!

I didn't need to use the whole bottle of dressing and this salad tasted great.  Plus you can use any vegetables you want and I added salami.

Good recipe. I left out the green pepper because I didn't have any and thought there would be plenty with the yellow and red peppers anyway. My daughter loved this. We are still eating on it two days later.

I made enough of this delightful and extremely colorful (shame there is no picture) for 35 people.  I was told by each and everyone of them how they couldn't get over how they loved it.

I made one change, not by choice, that worked out find, instead of the dry salad seasoning mix the recipe called for, I added the same amount of dry guacamole mix.

Thanks for sharing this, it is more than a keeper!

I used DC Girly Girl's salad seasoning, which is from this site, and Kraft's Red Pepper Italian Dressing with Parmesan Cheese. Because we don't like green pepper, I used a mixture of extra red and yellow to make up for the green. I threw in about a half cup of cubed provolone cheese as I had a third of a block of cheese I had to use or lose. I mixed this and let it set for a few hours until dinner and we all thought this was tasty. I liked how easy it was to assemble. GREAT for a warm day with BBQ'ed meat.

This was great for the office party, people kept on getting seconds and thirds. Afterwards they wanted the recipe. I added mushrooms and water chestnuts for a extra little crunch.

Great basic recipe. I used the recommended amount of seasoning, dressing, and pasta, then added in grape tomatoes, small sweet peppers (yellow, orange, and red), mini turkey pepperoni, and feta cheese as well. It was a big hit with the party I took it too and my husband, who isn't usually a big pasta salad fan. Thanks for sharing.

Great basic recipe with which to take off from and add what your family and guests would like or what is freshest. I added feta as others did,and also seasoned with some additional pepper. The combos for dressings,etc are unlimited,so easy, and attractive looking, also.

I made this recipe using McCormick's Salad Supreme seasoning.  I decided to only use half the amount the recipe called for because I felt it would make the salad way too salty.  Is this the "salad seasoning" referred to in the recipe or is there another seasoning out there that others have used?  With the smaller amount of seasoning, the salad was very good.  I also used half spiral pasta and half cheese filled tortillini.

This was a nice, quick and easy pasta salad, similar to one I’ve been making for years.  I made 1/4 of the recipe using a mix of red, yellow and orange peppers.  I didn’t have a green pepper, so I added some small broccoli florets for a little more color.  For the salad seasoning, as others suggested, I used Tasty Salad Seasoning by DC Girly Girl, which worked perfectly for this.  Once combined, I did not refrigerate it, but let it sit at room temperature for a few hours until dinner.

We took this pasta salad to a picninc and it was a hit! I didn't have enough salad seasoning so I added Mrs. Dash Table seasoning to help. Next time I will probably also add ham and cheese.

I also did not use the whole bottle of dressing. And I only used cucumber, green peppers, and onions. Not a big fan of black olives. But over all it was a really good salad.

Made this last night and it turned out pretty good. The veggies I used were: halved grape tomatoes, diced yellow pepper, diced red onion, diced cucumber, and halved kalamata (I definitely recommend using these over regular black olives) olives. I skipped the green and red peppers because I didn't want the pepper flavor to be too strong, and I don't really like green peppers. I also added shredded mozzarella and a little fresh grated parmesan. I used 2 tbsp McCormick's salad supreme (I was afraid 6 tbsp would be too overwhelming) and added a little extra salt and pepper. Next time I would add another 1-2 tbsp of the salad supreme, but otherwise it was very good, and made a very pretty dish with all of the different colors.

I only used 1/2 the Italian recipe called for then added 1/4 C light virgin oil and 1T lemon juice to cut down the salt.  I also added 1 small chopped red onion.  I used two pkgs. of pasta and still there was plenty of dressing; plus had enough for our pot luck!

I used a 12 oz. bottle of Wish Bone Robusto Italian dressing and one package of Good Seasons Zesty Italian sesasoning mix.  I used a 1 lb. package of tri-colored pasta and half a yellow pepper, half a red pepper, one cup of finely chopped broccoli, and half a diced cucumber.  DELICIOUS!!!

So easy and so delicious!!!!  I  used the little sweet (red, orange, and yellow) peppers instead of the standard bell peppers, and substituted Roma tomatoes for cherry and took the seeds out.

Made this the other night and it was a big hit.  Very colorful...so tasty.  Left out the 6 Tablespoons salad seasoning.  Just had it on the table so people could shake in on their salad if desired.

The Salad looked beautiful, but I def think I made a HUGE mistake. I don't think salad seasoning mix is the same as salad dressing mix. I only used 3 tablespoons and it was SO salty and SO garlicy it's barely edible. I love salty, but this was NOT good. I do think it's worth thrying again. Even if I can't figure out what salad seasoning mix is, it would probably by good just with the italian dressing. The colors alone are worth it. I substituted an orange pepper for red, so the red tomatoes, orange, yellow, green peppers, black olives, shredded mozz (I added), with the tri color pasta. It was beautiful!

Great recipe! I did some slight changes- used red, yellow, and orange bell peppers, steamed broccoli, shredded carrots, and I cut the tomatoes in half. Used about 4 tablespoons of the salad mix and a half bottle of dressing.  Very customizable recipe! 

Make sure to allow the noodles and broccoli to cool completely before combining with the other ingredients. Also, I enjoyed the salad better after refrigerating for 30min.

I made this recipe and started to put in 6 Tablespoons of Salad Seasoning mix per the instructions, but found that after 2 Tablespoons I had more than enough seasoning.  I used McCormick's Perfect Pinch Salad Supreme Seasoning.

This is honestly my favorite salad to date. It's quick to make and tasty. With that being said, I like to add artichokes and tuna in it. I'm a tuna lover so I'll often add some to many of my dishes. Once in a while, I'll even remove the pasta, and add some more tuna. It's delicious.

Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was just another pasta salad until I tried with the seasoning. Salad seasoning was a revelation to me...so good I made a large batch for Christmas gifts to give to book club members. Salad is good but the seasoning makes it delicious. Try it!!!

I found this to be awesome! This was my first homemade pasta salad! I added real bacon bits, white vinegar and onion powder with a little sugar to taste. My palate has a taste for the more spicy and sweet. I also added sliced boiled eggs around the bowl as a topping. Got many compliments!

Loved this easy pasta salad but added some extra goodies it needed! I followed what the recipe asked for but used only 1 bell pepper, then added broccoli, cucumber, salami, and small cubes of white cheddar cheese. I did not use all  of the salad dressing mixture. I would definitely make this again!

This is a versatile recipe is delicious!  I've made it as is and my family loved it.  I've also added shrimp or sausage and it makes a main course meal that is scrumptious.  I've also tried different Italian salad dressing like a Raspberry Vinegar that adds a sweet tang to it.  Love this recipe and will continue to make it because my family and I love it.

I only used a green pepper, that is the only pepper I had in the house. Next time, I will make with the other peppers, but I don't think it made that much of a difference. I made this salad for dinner and it has a wonderful flavor.  I plan to serve this with a little feta cheese on the top even though this salad doesn't need it. Thank you for this recipe. This will be my go to pasta salad from now on.  No more looking at other recipes.

Loved this simple pasta salad!
I opted to use diced cucumber and some spinach that I pulsed a few times in the food processor in place of the peppers and olives. Just a personal preference. The beauty of this is that you can use pretty much any veggies you'd like to and it still turns out great.
The dressing and seasoning measurements were right on.

This was a great basic recipe.  I was going by memory because I left my print out at work.  I only used 1 tbsp of salad supreme. Oops!  I also added peeled and quartered cucumber, onion and cauliflower.  Still loved it even though I grossly underestimated the amount of seasoning.  :)

I make this quite often, but I use the good seasons Italian dressing, that you mix yourself.  It is much more flavorful.

I had to make myself stop eating this pasta salad so that it could cool. I love it and so did my family. Instead of the bell peppers, I used carrots and broccoli because that's what I had. I will be using this recipe again. Simple and delicious.

For a long time I've tried to find a pasta recipe that was a keeper. Happy to say, the search is now over! I did make a couple changes, using only about half the bottle of dressing and augmenting with some splashes of extra virgin olive oil. Also, I only used a yellow bell pepper and one package of the seasoning mix, and I also added some feta cheese. It was a hit at our Fourth of July party!

I finally made a pasta salad last week following this recipe! Instead of using bottled dressing I made my own Italian dressing from the Italian Dressing Mix recipe from this website. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it and will be making it again.

Aesthetically pleasing looking with a pretty decent taste. I added a diced mango and 1 clove diced garlic. Easily able to feed a party. I would also add some salami and soft cheeses in there.

This recipe is a great idea! It can be made just the way it’s written or adapted as other subscribers suggested,  with different veggies, cheese like Feta or Blue cheese, meats and dressings. I love recipes like this because it’s flexible and adaptable.

The only change I made was replacing the bell peppers with cucumber (I am not a fan of bell peppers), and the diced cucumber gave the salad a nice crunch! :)

This was a very easy to make pasta salad and very satisfying.  I did, however, use only 1/2 bottle of Zesty Italian dressing and received a complement at our 4th of July potluck that they liked that it was not drenched in dressing.  I also added 1 bunch of chopped green onions and chopped zucchini.

I followed the video instructions regarding the spices and cheese.  I didn't have Romano so used Asiago cheese.  I used chopped zucchini instead of green bell pepper and omitted the cayenne pepper as my crowd doesn't "do hot". I added some chopped red onion and diced cheddar cheese.  I didn't have celery seed so I used only 1 tsp salt and added 1/2 teaspoon celery salt.  I loved it and so did everyone else! Thanks Cyndie!

I made this but modified it a little. I added the italian dry pack, sliced black olives, and diced ham. I don’t like the after taste of celery seed so I didn’t use that or broccoli. Very flavorful and colorful to enchance your holiday meal setting. It is definitely a quick and easy hit!

I never make any recipe as directed, I add, I subtract and I do my own thing.  To this one I made my own dressing,  added some finely chopped broccoli, and it turned out great.  I do NOT use any green bell peppers,  or no one here would eat it,  I use yellow, red and orange.   My dressing is a combo of lime juice, wine vinegar, mayo, sugar and sun dried tomato dressing, salt and pepper, with  a dash of Italian seasoning. OH and I added a tablespoon of finely chopped sweet pickle relish.

Made this for a party, and everyone loved it! I didn't substitute anything, but I decided to put three small bell peppers in instead of half of one type.  I put a red, yellow and orange - seemed just fine.  I saved this to make again - thanks for the great recipe!

Not impressed. I found the addition of the seasoning mix to be completely unnecessary and just made the final dish too salty and sour.

I have made this many times like it is. Now when i make it i only use one bell pepper of your choosing, but i add sliced up baby carrots, red onion, add green olives, and dice up each 4 oz. of colby jack and sharp cheddar cheeses, and 1/2 cucumber quatered and then de-seeded and then diced. I use either Robusto or Zesty Italian Dressing and a little cracked pepper.  It makes it super good.
Give it a try I'm sure you will like it.

Well I now know why my own pasta salad was always so dry...I was in denial as to how much dressing to use! This recipe is great as it is. I used these veggies -- broccoli, grape tomatoes, carrots. Yum!

Really tasty salad. I used tomatoes and olives and cucumbers, not any peppers. I also added some cheese cubes but  I don't think they added very much.

I was skeptical about the amount of salad dressing in this recipe but it needed it indeed.   I also did not  use all the Salad Supreme this called for, and I added broccoli, mozzarella balls and salami.  Excellent!!  I will make this again and again.

I usually done care for pasta salad because I don’t like the texture of olives. But I had to make a pasta salad for Easter so I substituted with a can of chopped olives to mix in my salad. It gave the flavor of the olives without the texture. I also used half of the suggested peppers. It was a hit!

This was a big hit at the birthday party I brought it to. I doubled it and added pepperoni, water chestnuts, & red onion. I used more black olives than called for. For the dressing, I chose Olive Garden brand. As other reviewers suggested, I used the recipe by DCGIRLYGIRL for the salad seasoning mix. This was delicious!

This was a hit at a pot luck.  I made the night before and put in just a fourth of the salad dressing while it sat overnight.  The cheese, tomatoes, and the rest of the dressing were mixed in the next day about 2 hours before serving. It turned out just the way I wanted it.

Made this last night turned out perfect in my opinion. Because the pasta noodles were 12 oz boxes I ended up using 24 oz instead if the 16 recommended. Because of that I added 8 more oz of Italian dressing. Add additional black olives along with cheese cubes and pepperoni. This is the best recipe I've tried so far and will be my go to for pasta salad.

Sorry but I'm only a little bit impressed by this recipe.
While it is quick and easy, IMHO it is too overly seasoned! Way too much going on in there and I think it's probably related to the 6TBS of Salad Season. I felt that was a lot when I read it and I feel like that is the source of the over seasoning. 
If I make this again, I'll be scaling back on the seasonings.

Nice, basic pasta salad.  Made it the day before for a picnic and it was very flavorful.  Had leftovers, so used them two nights later and added cucumbers and little balls of mozzarella, and squeezed some lemon juice.  Great with BBQ pork.

I love this recipe and the crunch of all the veggies in it.  I make mine very close to this & it's always great for using up whatever leftover veggies are in the fridge.  One of my favorite bottled dressings is Girards Caesar and it's wonderful in this pasta salad. I also like adding some artichoke hearts (canned in water - not oil), and some grated parmesean  cheese before serving if I have it on hand.

I made the pasta salad differently. I added cucumbers, tomatoes, bell peppers, italian dressing and olive oil to the multi colored pasta. It was a hit. Next time I'll add peppers and olives.

I made this as directed.  very colorful and full of flavor.  My guests liked it, however, I still prefer a pasta salad with mayonnaise instead of Italian dressing.

I went by recipe except I added thinly sliced salami and the broccoli florets shown in the pic-everything else exactly as recipe says.  I used Ken's Italian Dressing and one whole packet of Simply Organic Italian Salad Dressing (dry)-oh and I added very small cubed provolone.  Tastes delicious-in frig getting nice and cold.  Wonderful recipe!

I made this recipe numerous times. In the past I never measured out the seasoning. This time I followed the recipe and it came out perfect. I didn't substitute anything but did add rolled up deli meats. I think it adds to the recipe.

I was looking for a pasta recipe that was quick, with ingredients I already had and this was the first one. I didn't use the tomatoes, because I didn't have any, and I only used a quarter of the amount of bell peppers requested. Additionally, I put Parmesan on it.  Very good! Will bookmark and make again.  Thank you

Maybe I will change my tune in the morning, but it in no way needs all that dressing. I used half, will update tomorrow if it needed more after its soaked in a bit.

This was really good when I added more things to it and it sat overnight. I give it 4 stars because I tweaked it so much...it was a bit bland as written. I used a combo of salad dressings (using up several bottles of  various Drew's and Annie's dressings) made my own salad seasoning mixture, used more black olives, and added applewood ham. At serving I added cheese cubes/slices and avocados. It got better every day~~

Very nice salad.  The italian salad dressing made it taste so fresh.  Peppers stayed crisp until the salad was finished a couple of days later.

I love pasta salad, so it's hard for me to not be crazy about this recipe, but, I was a bit stymied when the recipe called for "salad seasoning". I had no idea what that was. Per the suggestion of another reviewer, I found a recipe from this site and made my own. I think the recipe called for too much dressing (perhaps twice as much) and would probably be enhanced by a protein of some sort (bacon, pepperoni, salami?). All in all, this is a good pasta salad, but I still prefer the bacon and ranch versions.

Great salad,the BEST pasta salad that I've ever had. The only thing I changed was that I only used half of the salad seasoning *Salad Supreme. I  think that using all that was called for would've been way too much.

I omitted the green pepper and added a couple cups of broccoli. I tripled the recipe so I'd have enough for 20 people...and although it says "serves 6," I had enough pasta salad for approximately 47 people. Good thing it was so tasty!

Couldn't get enough!
This was so good I couldn't stop eating it.  I  keeps well and is a great side dish.  I don't know what seasoning others have used but I tried Mrs Dash,  garlic salt and pepper. It was addictive!! Thank you for the recipe. I'll make this a standard.

Took this to a party and everyone loved it! Would omit the green pepper in future (just personal preference) and we did add broccoli.  You can really add or omit whatever you want in terms of vegetables, it's the dressing that really makes it tasty!

Love!!!  I made this for a party & everyone RAVED (and, honestly, who raves about pasta salad?) I saved some for us…it was gobbled up within a day. This will be a new staple at our house. I couldn't find anything called Suddenly Salad, so I used Kroger brand "salad seasoning" from the spice aisle. My dressing was store brand too. Very pretty salad also!

I made this a few years ago, and only because the colors were so pretty. Now, I make if all summer because it is so good. I did go a little light on the Salad Seasoning, I only used 2 T and mixed it with the salad dressing. It is also the easiest to make. The Best pasta salad. I didn't change a thing, except the salad seasoning.

It was delicious! 
A tip I would have is to go easy on the dressing and the seasoning mix. I only did 3/4s of the bottle and 3-4ish tablespoons of dressing and it still came out pretty great

I eliminated the black olives and used an orange bell pepper instead of the green bell pepper. I also added steamed broccoli florets and crumbled feta cheese. I did not use the full 16-oz  bottle of Italian dressing (but i will in the next batch. I used Olive Garden Italian Dressing). My family and i absolutely loved the pasta salad. It was simply wonderful! Signed, depclark.

This was a great, tasty salad.  It was easy to make.  I added cubed ham and cubed cheese cubes.  I only used half a jar of dressing and it was good.

Used 3 tablespoons Salad Supreme and one cup of dressing. To simplify, I halved the cherry tomatoes and used pre-sliced black olives. Did add chopped red onion after tasting and deciding it would kick it up a bit. Made a great light summer salad for a potluck. My first time ever using salad seasoning. Nice shortcut.

This is like my base pasta salad. I notice in the pic looks like brocolli. I put fresh brocolli in the pot a couple minutes with pasta when it's almost cooked so it's nice and crunchy. I also add any or all of the following ingredients: diced sweet onion, cucumber, canned artichoke hearts packed in vinegar & spices, diced zucchini, grated carrot, diced salami, and large grate or small cubed cheese of choice. Besides the Italiam dressing I sometimes throw in a large dollup of mayonnaise.

Very good dish. I am a huge fan of peppers and love all the beautiful colors and flavor.  I also love broccoli so even though the recipe didn't call for it I had to add some.  I made it on a Saturday and my boyfriend and I had it polished off by Tuesday.  Great as a side or I find it good as a lunch dish.

My family and I enjoyed this recipe, however I experimented. I used a tomato medley and added broccoli, using only half the dressing mix. I omitted the red bell pepper as it would've been overload on my troop. I would make this again, perhaps with sprinkled feta.

This is always a hit when I make it. My mother in law actually requests it. I also use Fat free Italian dressing and it still comes out good.
