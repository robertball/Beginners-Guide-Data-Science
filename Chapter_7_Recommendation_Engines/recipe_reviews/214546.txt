Happy to be the first reviewer to say mmmm, great soup! It smells wonderful and tastes even better! I didn't have carrots and am not crazy about them anyway, so I omitted them and tossed in a can of ceci beans to compensate. I used a mix of chicken and beef broth and included more broth rather than to add the one cup water called for.  I wasn't sure I'd like the green pepper but it turned out to add a good, subtle flavor. The herb seasoning was just right. Hubs and I both enjoyed this nourishing, satisying and hearty soup. I served this with "Parmesan Herb Bread," also from this site.

I used link sausage and cooked in the broth before removing and thinly slicing.  Used smoked mozzarella ravioli instead of tortellini.  Not a fan of green peppers but added some thinly sliced mushrooms and fresh spinach.

This was delicious and my husband loved it! We used spicy sausage and knowing that my husband was eating lots of veggies was great!

5+ stars from my family and I. My 13 yr old said it was the best soup I ever made! I used Italian chicken sausage instead of pork and fat free low sodium beef broth. The red wine really makes this. I also used a 6 cheese fresh tortellini. Excellent with a little pecorino romano sprinkled on top. A great soup and thanks!

Very good! I left out the carrots, but didn't miss it.  We loved the spicy kick of this soup!

Good stuff!  Used turkey sausage and a can of tomatoes because I didn't have any fresh.  Also omitted the green peppers, not a fan.  Found that I didn't need the last cup of water when I added the tortellini.  Thanks for sharing!

Really good soup!  I used half chicken and half beef stock for this.  I didn't have a red pepper so I left it out and added fresh chopped spinach.  I put in a chicken and proscuitto tortellini from the store.  The family approved.
