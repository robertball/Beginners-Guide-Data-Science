Not as good as I thought they would be.  They made a great lunch time snack, but my boyfriend wasn't thrilled with them.

These were very good. I used ground chicken for the inside of the biscuits, and it tasted delicious. It's good for a snack, a side dish, and even lunch like the name says. Definetely reccomended.
