Addictively delicious describes these perfectly!! I did change one thing in the recipe, I used 1/2 cup yellow corn meal & 1/2 cup flour in place of 1 cup flour. They don't last long, so be sure to cook plenty!! We used ranch dressing for dipping.

These were great after a few adjustments.
Found the oil temp too high and they were being over cooked.
Also the batter was too thin ---would cut down on the beer to 1/2 cup next time.
Excellent way for using the over abundance of Jalapenos we grow in the garden

I love these but I use Pickled peppers already sliced. If serving a large crowd, you can buy them in a large can.
Just make sure to drain them well.

This is wonderfully quick and easy! I put out some nacho cheese dip, salsa and sour cream to dip them in. It was a big hit! -- Kelly

These snacks were great. Everyone loved them, we served them with jalapeno cheese & Ranch dressing, they were gone in minutes. One suggestion I would recommend; coat them in flour first prior to the beer mixture. For a thicker breading repeat process twice

These were good and will make again, with a few changes. I will use more of a fried chicken breading recipe as this recipe was more like an 'elephant ear' dough. And I used jarred Jalapeno's for more bite. Also, I halved the recipe and still had plenty left over. I was excited about these because I used to love them at TGI Fridays when they called them "Fire Bites". Hopefully with the adjustments I can resemble them more.

Have made these 4-5 times. I use season salt and add extra chili powder, both ancho and chipolte. These are soo good. We have only dipped them in sour creme, but they are tasty all alone. Also use the batter for fish. ENJOY!!

Very good I did this as an appetizer for about 8 people little party to watch the saint’s game on Sunday. 6 racks of ribs, pork loin, BBQ beans and these. Doubled the order and put it on the coffee table. Went to check on the ribs came back and it looked like the game was no longer interesting everyone was around the coffee table loading up there bowls with these peppers. Will make them again no question.

Use this same batter to make calamari and then mix the peppers and calamari up in a basket when serving. Serve with a roasted red pepper remoulade.

My husband and I LOVED these. He works out of town and had deep fried jalapenos at a restaurant while he was gone. He asked me to try to make some while he was home and I tried this recipe. It was awesome! The only change I made is after the first batch I added more flour to the batter so the breading would be thicker, but that is personal preference. Thanks for sharing! I'll definitely make it again!

Like another reviewer, I also added extra flour so the mixture was thicker (when I held the spoon above it, it took a couple of seconds for the batter to drip off). I also upped my temperature to 380 as they weren't crisping up at 365. When they were golden on one side, I turned them over. They were a huge hit, although took a little long to fry. Served with Frito-Lay Jalapeno nacho cheese sauce. Disappeared faster than I could get succeeding batches done. Would definitely make these again.

Awesome! I used canned jalapenos cuz it was easier and I think that option gave great taste compared to fresh. If you like deep fried pickles you will love this.

Like another reviewer, I opted for the pickled slices and drained them well and blotted them with a paper towel.  Rather than individually fry them,  I plopped them all in the batter and picked up three or four pieces, shaking of excess batter and frying them in a group.  These turned out perfect!  The beer batter is just right, not to heavy, not too puffy.  This is a keeper.  I'll probably use it for fried pickles, too.

These were awesome!!  Hubby was eating them faster than I could make them.  Word to the weak - they are spicy!  We served with salsa con queso dip.  I used the leftover batter & fried up some green beans & broccoli.  Delicious!!  Because we cooked them after the jalapenos, the oil picked up a spicy flavor that carried over to the other veggies.  Not sure why other reviewers were saying this was too runny of a batter, I thought it was perfect as is.

I'm giving this 5 stars only because I adapted the recipe, and I wanted to be nice to the person who posted this recipe.  

That said:  We don't drink beer, so I used apple juice instead, but otherwise followed the recipe.  They weren't great, but after reading other reviews, I think it was the recipe, not my change.  They were kind of soggy.  I had to add more flour to get the batter to stick at all.  

I did two methods of cutting the jalopenos.  The first batch, I cut out all the seeds.  These were not very hot.  The second batch I left the seeds in, and they were so hot we could hardly eat them!

I made these for a party and they were a hit.  I did have to add a little more flour so the breading would stick to the vegetables.  Oh by the way I used all different kinds of veggies but the Jalapeno were great.  Deep frying seemed to take the bite out of the pepper.

These tasted good, but they never got crispy.  I'll probably try again though, because the batter was yummy.

These were great.  My entire family loved them.  Had picked up some jalapenos from a Farmer's Market and used them for this recipe.  Delicious!

Overall these were good not great. The batter is pretty good. I had to fry mine at a higher temperature and a good deal longer, about 8 minutes. Otherwise the batter comes out doughy instead of crisp. Perhaps if I would have cut them into thinner slices it would have been better.  Be sure to seed your peppers if you don't want them super hot. I ate about 25 of them last night and I'm regretting it today, big time.

I made these before and enjoyed them. The ideas with melted cheese is good, but when I put these on the table everyone goes for the ranch dressing for a dip instead of the cheese. I also lice them long ways and call them Snake Fangs. But for the most part very similar in ingredients. Use a good Belgian Beer for a different flavor.

I am not sure what went wrong.  I thought I followed the recipe; maybe I got too hot of jalepeno pepper.  They were miserable.  Not sue what the prob was.

I have always had issues frying things so I was cautious with this recipe. I have to say it was wonderful! a perfect breadding! I made jalapenos, pickles and onion rings with this batter. I stink at frying so i think I under cooked them but they were still great. If you arent the best at frying things, this is a really good batter to start off with!

One of our favorite football snacks! I use jarred jalapeños, and make a dip of melted cream cheese with a small amount of salsa mixed in. They taste like easy jalapeño poppers that way!

Really good! One of my favorite appitizers at Chili's is the fried onion strings and jalapenos and I was looking to replicate that. Fresh jalapenos are so expensive at the store right now, so I opted to use the jarred ones. They came out great, but the pepper was a little softer than I would have liked. They still tasted awesome, though, and I can't wait to try this with fresh jalapenos because I know they are going to be AMAZING! Thanks for sharing. :)

Added shredded cheese (a mixture of sharp cheddar and pepper jack) to the batter.  Offered topping/dipping choices of sour cream, bleu cheese dressing and ranch dressing.  Insanely, ridiculously, addictively delicious!!!

This was great!  Followed the recipe to a T.  The batter was the perfect consistency, not too thin, not too thick.  Next time, I'm going to fry some regular bell pepper rings and some onion quarters to make onion petals.  My husband and I both loved this batter!

I was out of beer, so I just dropped a handful of jalapeno slices (drained, from a jar) into egg and water.  In a separate container,  I shook them up in the flour and seasonings, then pan-fried till golden brown and crispy. We like to put them on burgers, in breakfast burritos, and regular burritos.

great - there were just two of us and we ate enough jalapenos to feed an army! I used the ones out of a jar, patted them dry then put them directly into the batter. The batter was the perfect consistency and they came out great!

I thought they were ok. I started off making this exactly as posted but  as I cooked them I added more to the recipe because my husband and I felt there was something missing. I added more salt, garlic powder, I even added some corn meal and Panko breadcrumbs but it was still missing something. I will make this again so I can get it right but I think next time I'll use pickled jalapenos instead as seeing other reviewers seemed to like it that way.

excellent recipe!My family loved it.I sliced mine long ways for easier handling. I couldnt get the batter to stick at first. My husband hit on a solution.If you wet the peppers and roll them in flour before dipping in the batter, it makes a crunchy,perfect crust.I used ranch for dipping, but plan to try the mayo, ketchup horseradish idea next time. What these appitizers lack in "prettiness" they more then make up for in flavor

My family loved these, and they are a picky bunch! They were delicately crispy/crunchy. The batter was so good, I whipped up another batch and we fried fish and then pickle slices in it. We will definitely be using this one again!

These were AWESOME! I made them for a snack for me and my husband and we both loved them! I agree with another reviewer...only use 1/2 cup of beer. 1 cup makes the batter way too runny.  I used about 3/4 cup.  Other than that these turned out great. I passed the recipe to all my friends and will definitely be making these again!

Can we give 10 stars?  These were so good!  The batter is thin, but I think it couls do more than 2 cups.  Also, I used 1 c ginger ale because I don't drink so don't have beer.

Made these to go with bacon wrapped deep fried hot dogs. They were wonderful even shared the recipe with my guests. I didnt have beer and used water instead and they still came out great. Next time I will use the beer.

The breading was a bit more like a tempura, it puffed up alot for me.  I used less beer, as others suggested, and it still was quite thin and didn't stick well to the jalapenos.  This is a good jumping off point - I will definitely seed the jalapenos next times, and use even less beer.

I'd give this ten stars if I could. The only regret is I could have easily used more peppers, as I still had plenty of batter left over. I'll be making this again very soon, thanks!

These little bite size snacks were great.  Kids loved them, we served them with jalapeno cheese, they were gone in minutes.  One suggestion I would recommend; coat them in flour first prior to the beer mixture.  I dredge them in flour using a ziplock bag (much easier & less mess. If you like a thicker breading repeat process twice)

These were ok.  A good sauce for them is a couple slices american cheese, some sour cream, and a dash of milk all melted together.

These were really good...i LOVED the flavor of the batter...unfortunately, just too darn hot for me! Everyone who ate them, though, loved them! They were a big hit.  I did have to add a lot more flour, though, to get this to actually stick to the pepper slices.  Next time I'm going to use this same recipes for the jalapeno slices, but also use it for green tomato slices.  I think it would be fantastic! Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!

These were the hit of the party!  We made both slices and strips.  The batter was a little bland but we just salted the jalapenos when they came out of the deep fryer.  I will definately be making these again!

these were pretty good. I ususally make mine using tempura batter then breadcrumbs and I have found they cook up and stay crispier that way. These are awesome with homemade ranch dip!

I love jalapenos and spicy food, but this was over the top.  I could hardly eat them and my boyfriend took one bite.  I suggest taking the seeds out before battering them, that could have been the problem.  The batter was pretty yummy though, as far as I could taste... my taste buds were shot after a few slices!

These were pretty good and a great way to use up some jalapeños from the garden.  It made a lot of batter so I used the extra batter and some leftover mushrooms and they came out great.  Next time I will try dredging them in flour first to get the batter to stick better.

Just ok... Easy to make but other than the jalapeno there was no flavor.  Also not sure if I should've seeded them or not.  I didn't and they took longer than expected to cook all the way through.  

Thanks anyways....

These were ok. At first the batter was watery so I added some more flour and they were better but very HOT. I got on allrecipes again and read some reviews and took out the seeds like someone recommended. They were better then the first batch and instead of slicing them I halved them removed seeds and then battered them. Then I thought it needed cream cheese. So I added cream cheese on the half put it in the batter and then fried it. The end result was ok. I will keep looking for a good jalapeño recipe.

Sooooo good and easy to make.  I try to remove a lot of the seeds first to make them less hot depending on where I'm taking them, but everyone loves them.  I serve with a warm cheese sauce...also good with sour cream.

Pretty good, turned out kind of greasy and not as flavorful and I expected, but not bad either.

I made it in little muffin tins. I added cheddar cheese to the ingredients. It made four dozen little cups. I also only one  croissant dough sheets which made it really easy to cut squares for the bottom of the muffin tins

I made this as directed. Batter was a little thin for my liking, but was a good flavor. Wish I had some nacho cheese on hand to try it that way. I will make this again with a little less liquid in the batter. I’ll also make sure I have nacho cheese on hand too.

Excellent!  I subbed 1/4 C of corn meal for 1/4 C of the flour and added 1/2 tsp baking powder.  The batter consistency was absolutely perfect.

I had made this type of treat in the past, but  had NOT used this batter recipe.   Holy cow...  I fried all the left over batter as a crunchy treat or add-in for soups.     One thing, at least for me, the batter recipe as followed seemed thin and runny.  I ended up adding in about another cup of flour.   Maybe it was the "watery" beer I used... Bud Light... LOL!

I was making beer battered fried okra and had extra Jalapenos from the garden. Recipes were about the same. I fried the okra first then added eggs to do the peppers. Mine are really hot. Wish I had some cheese dip on hand.

Its a hit or miss 
I find that the beer amount suggested is a little to much for my taste so i use half a cup of beer and dilute it with water
Which means in needs a lot of salt or garlic salt. 
I only make it when im really craving fried jalapenos.

Used a Coke instead of beer.  Batter did not coat as thickly as shown in the picture, but YUMMY!  Good way to use those jalepenos and cow horn peppers from the garden!

The batter was great. Reading from the other reviews I slowly poured the beer. I only used 3/4c which gave it a thin crisp. The only thing I changed was the salt/pepper. I used season salt only. Instead of the jalapeño slices I used the whole jalapeño. Cleaned out the seeds an stuffed them with Kraft 4 cheese (Mexican style, 2cups), half sweet onion (diced), fresh cilantro (diced), and season salt to taste. The onion gives it a nice semi sweet taste along with the spicy. Will do again but with a little less beer

Just made, and ate this! Very good! Didn't have chili powder, so added black and red pepper blend called Hot Shot. Dredged in flour then batter. Used Shiner Bock beer. Had enough batter to cook up some zuchini and onion slices. Served with a jalapeno dip from this site, and the rest of the beer .

great recipe.  a restaraunt near us serves this with cheddar cheese melted under a broiler over the japalenos and with a side or ranch dressing, 
its worth going there just for the japalenos.

Pretty good.  Batter was a bit bland but a very nice snack and good use of an abundance of jalapenos.  Definitely sprinkle with salt hot out of the grease - it helped the flavor a lot.

Hmmm.... This didn't work for me (sorry!). Something was missing. For one, the bater was waay too "airy" (but I guess that's OK if you prefer your batter this way) and flavorless. I expected some spiciness, especially since chilli powder and ground black pepepr were the 2 main components of the batter. I guess my fiance and I are just hooked on the "bottle caps" we had at our local BBQ hangout. Unfortunately, they closed several months ago. I think one of my main problems with these was the fact that I cut my jalapenos too thick (my fault!). My fiance mentioned that the jalapeno slices we had at our favorite restaurant were thinly sliced and that most of the seeds were removed (I didn't remove any of the seeds from mine lol...). We also think theirs were double dipped to make them crispier. My fiance ended up salvaging the leftover batter by making onion rings instead. We enjoyed those much more. The bronco burgers we made to accompany our jalapeno slices were also not too great (a real bummer since both seemed to go well toghther!!!). Thanks for sharing your idea anyways, Micah :)

Tried these for the first time yesterday and loved em!!  Nice easy batter.  I cooked them longer than the recipe said (they floated up almost immediately but needed a bit more time to get crisp).  I wanna try a tempura batter next! (see KoreanMom's review below)

Tasted good, but not very pretty for serving to guest.
