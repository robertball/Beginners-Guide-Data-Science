Surprisingly good for something so simple. For any basic eggplant recipe, I always recommend that you lightly salt the slices to allow them to sweat out the bitter juices before cooking. Sprinkle both sides of each slice of eggplant with salt and allow to sit for about 10 minutes. Wipe off the liquid with a paper towel before dipping in the egg dip. I used whole grain saltines and freshly grated Romano cheese. Pretty good.

I used Panko Bread Crumbs instead of the crackers, minus the pepper and parsley flakes (because I don't care for them), so I can't say it was a 5 if I didn't use the exact ingredients. It was delicious! Super easy to make. Just a long time in the oven, but worth not frying the eggplant. Will definitely make again.

delicious. I used a mixture of corn flakes and saltines for the breading. Definitely making this again.

This was just okay for us.  The cracker crumbs made this a little too mealy.  I like a little more cheese so I did add a bit, along with sauce, between layers.

Very delicious!  I also made it using olive oil in place of the egg/milk combo.

I made this recipe because I had everything on hand.  This was so good!  I used Colby jack cheese instead of mozzarella.  Yummmmm

Used half breadcrumbs, half panko crumbs instead of saltines (I was out). The recipe turned out amazing. Made dinner for someone and included this dish...they wanted the recipe! This is a keeper!

Let me just say this came out better than I could've ever imagined. I'm not one to try new foods and this was spectacular! The only changes I made were only stacking them only two slices of eggplant high and using generic pizza sauce because that's all we had. It tasted so good. I was worried it would come out soggy but it was crispy as stated. Thanks for posting this!
