I used a full pound of shiitake mushrooms.  Skipped the white wine because I didnâ€™t feel like opening a bottle for a half cup of wine (cooking for one tonight).  Did not have the sun dried tomato pesto, so used chili pesto instead, and this gave the dish some heat (yum!).

Made this tonight and it was absolutely delicious.  We will definitely make it again for company!
A few changes may be beneficial:
1) I doubled up on the shiitaki mushrooms and onions, and it seemed about the right ration.
2) I made the tomato pesto with 1/2 cup sundried tomatoes in oil, and added half again as much fresh basil, chopping everything fine.  Left out garlic as I put plenty in the main recipe.
3) I used uncooked peeled shrimp and mixed the teaspoon of pepper flakes with the shrimp an hour before cooking.  I added the shrimp about 1/3 of the way through the 10-minute simmering cycle and they came out perfect!
4) I undercooked the pasta just a bit (used linguini because that's what I had) and then tossed into the sauce with a few minutes left of simmering time.  Sucks up lots of flavor and juice!
Enjoy!

excellent recipe restaurant quality made it with 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper. Just the right amount of hot and I like spicy.

Excellent taste, easy to make, sauce was too runny though.

I'm vacationing and happened to have all the ingredients except for shrimp. I substituted imitation crab for the shrimp. I also only used half of the red pepper flakes and it was plenty hot enough. I also substituted spaghetti for the pasta and used the 4 oz. package of assorted fresh mushrooms I had for the shiitake mushrooms. Awesome dish!
