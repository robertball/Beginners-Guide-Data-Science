Great light dessert! I cut the recipe down to 4 servings but added extra grapes as there seemed to be too much dressing. I used lemon yogurt instead of sour cream & I think that it tastes best just slightly chilled. The grapes have more flavor then. My grandkids will love this too...thanks for the recipe jowolf2!

Absolutely a 5 for taste; however I do agree with the other reviewers that there is much too much dressing.  Not a problem because the amount that's left is going to make a yummy fruit dip snack for me later...  For calorie counters, how about just serving the grapes with a dollop of the dressing on top?  Next time I make this, I hope to have fresh mint from the garden as I think it would be a great addition and garnish.  Thanks for the quick and easy and GOOD tasting recipe.

This was great! I tried melting and heating the brown sugar/butter in the microwave, but it didn't work too well as I just couldn't get it to blend well. Oh well, never mind the looks, the taste was terrific! Next time though either I'm adding more grapes as the sauce was really generous. So easy, thanks!

I really liked this. Next time I will omit the powdered sugar and I'll make the "sauce" as a dip instead so that I have more portion control :=) I need to eat more fruit, less dip! Thanks for the recipe!

This was great! However, as other reviewers stated there is alot of the dressing so I added granny smith apples and 1/2 cup pecans.

I made some changes, but this is really good.  I had only black grapes, and I had 8 oz of sour cream, so I subbed cream cheese for the remaining sour cream.  I also used 1/2 dark brown sugar and 1/2 light brown sugar.  I cut the butter to 1/2 cup...I think it would have been too much for me otherwise, and I used a little less powdered sugar, but it would be sweet enough to me if it was omitted.  I also left out the grapes and just stirred the butter/brown sugar mixture  into the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  I'm adding the caramel mixture to my grapes per serving.  This would have been too much mixture for the amount of grapes for me, but this way, I can use with other fruits, too!  All in all, it's very good, and I'll definitely make again.

I think this is great, as an "Eyeball Salad" for Halloween; we'll see how it goes over at the potluck.  My sister-in-law brought it to a party this summer, and I thought it was quite tasty!

Yum. This is great for using up a lot of older grapes. However, even with 1/2 the sauce, it's too gooey for me. I think next time I will try 1/3rd of the sauce.

The caramel flavor adds some interesting depth, but I also enjoyed just the sour cream/vanilla/sugar mixture as well. Either way is good.

I cut the brown sugar and butter in half and use a combination of red and green grapes.  It was much more attractive that just green grapes.  Overall, a real hit with everyone.

This was good but I either needed more grapes or to cut the cream mixture in half. The grapes were basically just sitting in a pool of the creamy mixture. I also need to let the caramel mixture thicken more next time. Since the directions said that it did not need to boil, once it started boiling I was afraid it would burn or something so I went ahead and poured it in, but it was not thick enough yet. The taste was great but next time I will make these modifications and I know it will turn out perfect!

Very good! I liked it, my kids were split on their verdict, one liked it, one didn't. It had a slightly gritty texture, I'm not sure if it was the powdered sugar, or the brown sugar.
I also tried it before putting the brown sugar/butter mix in, and it tasted really good with out those two things. It tasted really refreshing that way, which makes this a very nicely versatile dessert or snack.
