I've made this without the dashi (didn't have any) or water for both tempura and eel rolls (thicken it more).  Much better than the bottled stuff too!

This didn't taste exactly like traditional tempura sauce, and despite its description was still a bit too watery...but it was still very tasty! I would definitely make it again, but with less water.

Not bad, but not like the dipping sauces served here in Japan.  I felt it was flavored to heavily on the dashi side.  I think I will look for a different recipe but this was nice and easy and I had everything on hand to make with a last second Shrimp Tempura recipe I made tonight.

A more authentic version would be 1/4 cup mirin, 1/4 cup soy and 1/4 teasp of dashi granules.

Didn't have the seeds.  Cut the water in half and it's pretty good!

I used 1/4 cup of water, and didn't have any dashi. I used it on tempura fish. It had a watery consistency, but tasted very good! Might try leaving out the water next time.

This is very, very good. And it is simple to make. I used homemade dashi broth that I freeze in ice cube trays. I also used  tamari sauce to keep it gluten free. The description doesn't lie. It has a deep, robust flavor with a brewed taste to it, not watered down like the restaurant types. Thank you for the recipe.

This sauce recipe came out too sweet, and I don't think it  tasted right with shrimp and veggie tempura. I even tried adding more soy sauce and a new batch adding more water, but none turned out to be good, in my opinion.

Very tasty and simple, had all ingredients on hand! Tastier than the sushi restaurant we go to for sure. Used it with potato tempura. YUM!
