OMG! I love apples and bacon and placing it between two slices of lightly grilled bread with melted cheese...delicious! This is a nice twist on traditional grilled cheese and it was a perfect combination of sweet and salty. I used thick sliced whole grain bread, but whatever bread you use this is bound to be delicious. This is definitely a case of don't knock it 'til ya try it!

Can I give this more than 5 stars?!  We loved this!  I used this recipe for Johnsonville-s 6 Ingredient or Less challenge.  I used a rustic boule of whole wheat bread and replaced the bacon with crumbled sausage meat.  I also served it with the Yummy Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce from this site.  So good!  The flavors are perfect!  If you don't have a panini press, just heat a skillet on medium and when it's hot, put your sandwich down with another, smaller pan on top of it to press it down.  Then, just put a heavy can on it to hold it.  Flip the sandwich after 2-3 minutes (after it's toasted nicely).

I cooked this in a Croque Monsieur machine, which I imagine is about the same as the one mentioned in the recipe.  The recipe really appealed to me.  However the apple remained firm and so one could hardly taste it.  For the next try I intend to cook the slices in the bacon fat.  I buttered the sandwich on both the outer sides as I would normally for a toasted sandwich.

I used to make these all the time when I was a kid.  Not sure where the idea came from, but a nice alternative to the standard grilled cheese.  I like the saltiness of the bacon with the sweetness of the apple.

I thought this was an unusual combo but thought it was worth a try.  I LOVE THIS!! Easy to make too.  I think this might be good as an open face sandwich for a ladies lunch.  Thank you for this!

I've made this sandwich many times with turkey bacon and it's so yummy. 

Another great alternative to grilled cheese is to add roasted red peppers, grilled portobello mushrooms and fresh basil,you can use whatever cheese you like I use pepperjack or  mozzarella.

How can you not love this? There's absolutely nothing I can point to that is less than 5-star-worthy!  I also made it with Gruyere to see how it would be and - you guessed it - Still great!
