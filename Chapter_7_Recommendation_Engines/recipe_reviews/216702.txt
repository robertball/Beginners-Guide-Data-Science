This is totally "yummy" - however I hollow out a head of cabbage (finely chop the cabbage & add to the corned beef mix, great texture) then stuff the mix into the hollowed cabbage head - awesome presentation, especially for St. Patty's Day Party!!

This was great. I made it for a family gathering and everyone loved it.  I served it with rye toasts and mixed crackers. At first bite I thought, hmm this is different, but then couldn't stop eating it. We ate all of the pulled out bread with that bit that wouldn't fit into the breadbowl.
I took it out of the fridge 1/2 hour before company  arrived as it does get a little stiff when cold. It was a great make ahead. I made the spread the day before and stuffed it in the bread bowl the following morning. 
Thanks for sharing. Will make again often.

This dip "grew on my husband". He enjoyed it more as he had more. I don't know why. We did like it but I did add extra garlic powder and a little bit of cayenne powder. It is not something I would make again because their are other dips that I prefer more and if I'm going to eat a high fat appetizer I had better LOVE it. If you do try this out, make sure and remove the paper wrap completely from the corned beef can or the gadget to open it will slip and then you are screwed. Take it from me, it was not a pretty sight by the time I got my can open.

I only used one 8oz. bar of cream cheese and left out the dickle pickles while still using the pickle juice and this turned out fantastic!!!   To have enough pumpernickel bread, you almost need a second loaf to use up all the dip, but still amazing!

This is great!  I did make a few additions though.  I couldn’t find a big enough loaf, so I served it with chips.  Instead of adding just sour cream, I added jalapeño sour cream.  I did this because my family loves spicy.  I also added the juice of 1 lime, and it really boosted the flavor.  I wished I had used just 1/2 of the corn beef, but that’s just me.  I have arthritis in my hands, so I used a mixer, and it turned out great!  This is a must try recipe, I really think you’ll love it! ??
