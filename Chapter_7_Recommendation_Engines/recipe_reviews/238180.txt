5 for flavor, 3 for ingredients/directions, but the flavor is so good I can overlook the FROZEN strawberries it calls for and still give it 5 stars.  Please, if you're going to use frozen strawberries, let them thaw first (or just use fresh strawberries), unless your goal is a vinaigrette smoothie. I went against my better judgement and decided to follow the recipe exactly as written, even though I had fresh strawberries in the refrigerator. Very simple and delicious! I served this as suggested, on a spinach/strawberry/almond/feta salad. So good!!! Thank you Courtney for the great recipe. I'll be making this often!

A great use of strawberries, although I admit to using 8 oz. of fresh berries rather than frozen.  Used all the other ingredients as listed and this produced a delicious salad dressing and lasted a week in the fridge without getting watery from the fresh fruit.  I will be making this dressing again.  Thanks Courtney, for sharing your recipe.  It's a keeper in our house.

I luv this dressing!!!  So delicious!!!  I'm on the 21 day fix and was missing my Raspberry and Strawberry Vinaigrette dressings.  Until I saw this.  I'm not a big fan of just Balsamic Vinaigrette all the time LOL!!!.  All ingredients in this version are fix approved.  Thanks for the tip to thaw whatever fruit you use.  I like it a little chunky.  Next I'll be making a raspberry version!!!

So quick and easy. I made it without Salt or Pepper, and I used fresh strawberries and it still taste great. This has changed the way I view store bought salad dressing, NO MAS!!!

This is a perfect vinaigrette for any salad. I made a couple substitutions, however: fresh strawberries over frozen ones, and white vinegar instead of ACV because I didn't have any. I also added some water in the end because it was a bit thick, and some fresh mint for extra flavor. But it tasted great. I can imagine it tasting good with other berries as well.

I made it with fresh strawberries and it was amazing. I agree it's a little thick but all the flavor is there.

I used fresh strawberries! If you just taste it, then you might think it's too sweet. I put it on a spinach salad with feta and chicken. We loved it!! Healthy too!

I used the last sad, bland strawberries in the fridge and it came out great! Not too sweet, which I appreciate in a dressing, and ridiculously easy!

This dressing is amazing...there is a brew pub that makes this dressing and now I can finally enjoy the same dressing at home.  I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen and it pairs well with spinach, sliced onions, gorgonzola, macadamia nuts & diced strawberries.

Thank you :)

Very good and simple recipe. Goes really well with a spinach salad with strawberries, feta, and almonds. However, use fresh strawberries. They work just fine and you don't need to thaw them.

Amazing recipe. I used fresh strawberries, but otherwise followed the recipe. Put it on a bed of romaine with red onion, fresh strawberries (because I still had some leftover),  candied pecans, and cheddar cheese. It was DELICIOUS. I am making it again this week for company.

This was so easy. I doubled it and used 4 cups of frozen strawberries. I realized later that I had forgotten the salt and pepper but didn’t notice it missing when I taste-tested it. It’s just THAT good!

Delish! I used fresh strawberries (I made it during the summer, so why not?), and I added a little garlic and a pinch of Dijon mustard. It went great with my kale salad and some pecans to top it off.

I will not make this again. I made it and it was a waste of my ingredients. Tasted like apple cider vinegar with no other flavors. Have to make another one with different recipe for a dinner now. Waste of time and ingredients for me.

Although I used this sauce with a strawberry and spinach  salad, I think it would be delicious with other fruit salads as well.  I increased the honey  by  1 tsp to make it sweeter. Next time I will decrease the olive  oil by 1/2-1tsp.  I'd like to reduce the taste of the olive oil a little.

Thawed the frozen berries, used a little less than 1/4 tbsp of pepper/salt. I would use maybe just 1 to 1.5 tbsp ACV. The ACV is a little strong for me. But overall so good! Thanks for sharing.

i dislike all salad dressings, because of the oily taste.  This recipe was superb.  Served it on baby spinach, with candied pecans, and feta cheese.  Beyond amazing

It was a little sweet for me but that is probably because I rarely eat extra sugar. The second time I left out the honey, S&P and I love it!!! Thank you for sharing!!

Arugula, berries and this sauce. So easy

I switched out the apple cider vinegar for equal parts of balsamic vinegar, and 6 large fresh strawberries instead of the frozen...it was AMAZING! My husband said it tasted like a fruit dessert.

I made this dressing with 1 cup fresh local berries so I can't comment on how the frozen work, but this was very good when made with fresh.  I added an extra tablespoon of honey to taste and cut back a bit on the pepper.  Comes together quickly and easily in my magic bullet blender.

I'll be using frozen strawberries next time and trying that. I used fresh strawberries and it came out a little frothy. I think by freezing the berries, it collapses the cellular structure of the berry when it thaws, making them more smooth when they blend up. Sweet, tangy and kind of thick. I tossed it with fruit salad, nuts, spinach - really good!

Great recipe. I made a couple changes.  I used fresh strawberries and doubled the vinegar.  It helped to loosen up the dressing as well as balancing out the flavor.

Truly delicious!!! The best salad dressing I have ever made!! I cut the honey since I am not fond of really sweet dressings. I also used fresh strawberries, weighing them out and used 10 ounces.  I didn't have apple cider vinegar so used the raspberry blush vinegar I did have. I blended it for a really, really long time and it  did not separate by the time we served it several hours later. It was totally awesome!!!

I followed the recipe with no alterations and this dressing was AMAZING!! I was licking the spatula! I’m so thankful to have found this because it will make eating salads every day super easy because it’s so tasty! Only thing I will do differently next time is thaw out the berries more.

We used 8 oz (weighed) of FRESH strawberries. Didn't use quite as much pepper (maybe 1/8 tsp), and my kids like it! Really good with some celery sticks dipped into it. I picture vitamins getting into my kids, thanks to this recipe. 
Thanks for sharing!

I used fresh strawberries that were a little tart so I was looking for a way to use them up.  I think I personally would skip the frozen strawberries. Using this over arugula, bacon, blackberry, and gorgonzola salad. Bonus- the kids love it too! It's nice to use nutritious, vitamin-packed dressing for them! Super fast and easy to make  in the blender.

Very nice flavor and color! Caveat; frozen berries needed an allowance for some thaw time- even though my berries were cut slices, they were cold enough they made an 'ice cream' consistency. Glad I made the dressing first; after prepping salad greens  I still had to wait a bit for the dressing because I didn't want to dilute the flavor.

My daughter wanted me to buy a strawberry vineigrette dressing, but I couldn't find one.  I honestly didn't think I'd like a sweet dressing, but this was amazing!!  I used fresh strawberries, just because I had them.

I used fresh strawberries and I imagine it's no different than with frozen. The apple cider does come through in the flavor of dressing. Very good recipe and simple.

Love this vinaigrette! I will agree that the consistency is much better when with unfrozen strawberries. My family loved it as well.

Delicious! I thawed my berries completely before blending to avoid ending up with a strawberry smoothie as another reviewer put it, but other than that I didn't change a thing. I used it on a salad of baby spinach with dried cranberries, candied pecans, and blue cheese.

Love it and I'm a very picky eater.   I use Spinach and Strawberry and Grilled Chickem Breast  sprinkle with almonds and other fruit on the side.  What a good light lunch or supper.

Sister-in-law lives with us and is very, very picky.  She loved this and rates it 5-star.  I agree.  Like most reviewers, I also used fresh strawberries.

I made this yesterday using fresh strawberries, but following the rest of the recipe exactly.  It was simple, fast and delicious! I served it over a spinach and sliced strawberry salad with tomatoes and pecan pieces.  My husband and I enjoyed it and I will definitely make it often.  Thanks for sharing!

I used fresh strawberries and half the honey, and it seemed the right amount of sweet. The taste is good, but I didn't think it was phenomenal. I made mine right in an old olive jar with an immersion blender.

Very easy to make and flavorful.   I used fresh strawberries.  The honey gives it just enough sweetness.  I'll try with balsamic vinegar next time.

Didn't have the cider vinegar, so I replaced for a little bit of apple butter, and still used white rice vinegar with the honey. Turned out perfectly!

I love this recipe. I always keep frozen strawberries on hand and they work great in the recipe, although they do need to be at least partially thawed. It is a wonderful light healthy option that makes a salad with nuts and fresh fruit come to life.

I enjoyed this recipe. It is very sweet and tangy. I did add an additional tablespoon of coconut oil (because I love the subtle flavor it adds) and it was pretty thick so I also added 1 tablespoon water which thinned it perfectly. Haven't tried it on the salad yet but looking forward to it today!

This was excellent...I used grape seed oil instead of olive oil-was delicious you may have to add a bit more oil and vinegar to get the blend correctly but otherwise great

I used frozen blueberries and added a chive. The taste was there but it turned into ice cream had too add water. Next time I'll thaw whatever fruit I'm using.
