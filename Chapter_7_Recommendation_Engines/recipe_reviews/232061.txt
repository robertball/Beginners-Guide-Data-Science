I made this recipe but significantly simplified(see http://allrecipes.com/customrecipe/63702805/quick-and-easy-baja-style-fish-tacos/): I used frozen, beer battered fish fillets and premade pico de gallo. I also left out the ranch dressing (though I had some on hand in case it was needed). Those three changes slashed the ingredient list to a cardinality of five, which was within the realm of a weeknight dinner. But a fancy one! The flavors and textures worked great together and even my 3 year old ate some. Well done!

Downsdea-eliminating the Ranch dressing and the pickled jalapenos in this recipe you will loose much of the flavors. the vinegar in the pickled jalapeno give the salsa that extra zing and of course ranch dressing has much more flavor than sour cream,lime and garlic salt.

tcmjem-the reason for stacking the tortillas (I always use 2) the first can become soggy, or saturated with the juices and the second helps keep it together for less mess.

My 13 year old just got thru making this. Turned out great! We did use fresh jalepeno and made a sour cream/sriracha sauce. We will play with it again for sure.

A few changes, grilled corn and added to salsa and made a avocado cream sauce by using half avocado 1/4 sour cream and lime juice in blender.  Also fried the corn tortillas added the cheese, then fish, slaw and salsa, topped with avocado cream sauce.  This is a keeper

With all the different ingredients and colors it was surprisingly bland. I didn't follow the recipe exactly though. I used fresh Jalapeno instead of canned and added more lime juice and salt to make up for the missing liquid. I also didn't use ranch dressing and instead followed another reviewer's suggestion of sour cream+garlic salt+lime. Maybe I will add some mexican seasoning mix for leftovers. I can't think of much else to do to improve it unfortunately. It was a lot of work (more like 90min in my hands) for the result.

YUM! I am a sucker for all things Mexican and this didn't let me down! Although not my favorite (I prefer BREESE's fish tacos a tad better), these were mighty tasty nonetheless. I especially enjoyed the Ranch slaw and homemade pico! My husband couldn't find Shore Lunch brand batter, so he picked up Drake's brand (which worked just fine). HINT: You'll need to fry your fish in batches. To keep already fried fish warm, stick it in a 200 degree F oven. It will retain its heat and be just as crisp at is was out of the deep fryer! Mexican rice, tortilla chips, guacamole and sangria rounded out our festive meal. Thank you Allrecipes for featuring this gem in Allrecipes magazine! :-)

We really like these tacos.  I used Mahi Mahi instead of cod.  I couldn't find the chili-garlic sauce at the grocery so I mixed ranch dressing mixed with hot sauce and drizzled over the top.  Really good

I was really excited to try this after reading it in the AR magazine. I was disappointed there wasn't more flavor. The coleslaw didn't add any flavor, and the tomato salsa was good, but all I could taste was jalapeno. Ill try it again, and make a few changes.

I saw this recipe in the magazine and had to try it. I made it as written and it was delicious. I used Drakes coating with Dos Equis beer.  I used my deep fryer with canola oil and fried at 375 degrees as suggested by the magazine editors.  The fish was awesome.  The salsa was very tasty and it made enough to use with other recipes. My 4 year old daughter ate the fish dipped in ranch and couldn't get enough!  Because of the clean-up of the deep fryer, I probably will only make this once in awhile, but it was definitely worth it.

I loved this recipe! I changed a few things. Used lettuce instead of coleslaw mix and fried the shells and cod in olive oil. I used McCormick's Beer Fish Batter with Budweiser and the fish turned out great. I used garlic powder and onion salt for the fresco and it turned out great. My husband likes them better than his tacos and he makes awesome chicken and beef tacos.

My family LOVED this recipe! The homemade pico added a wonderful fresh flavor . The only thing that I did differently was I used flounder  (cut into wide strips) instead of cod since that is what I had. Delicious!

This was good.  My husband, a foodie and better chef than I, liked them.  However, we won't do the saltwater brine again next time, since it was a little on the salty side for us.  We rarely use a lot of salt in our cooking, so I would suggest playing around with the saltwater brine according to your taste.

Wow I didn't think we would like this.  Being new to the fish taco thing,  only recently having had them at a local Mexican joint in town for the first time . I thought lets try making them at home . Well this did not disappoint. I think they were actually better then the ones I had at the restaurant. I used a Cajun fish batter mix for simplicity . Very pleased with the out come .. Kudos!!!

I used pico de gallo instead of cutting tomatoes and onions, and for the fresh jalapenos instead of canned peppers.  I used a garlic-lime vinaigrette instead of ranch, and I didn't add cheese.  I also added mangos.  My grocery store didn't have cod, so I substituted frozen tilapia.  Tasty!

#Allrecipesallstarscanada  #TACOLOVE
Supper tonight! I used this recipe as a launching point. I made the fish, but then it was a 'clean out the fridge' kind of recipe.  I really liked the fish , both in the soft shells, as well as the few pieces that just ended up alone on my plate

Made it as it specified. Outstanding recipe.  First time eating Fish Tacos in my 57 years. Couldn't get past the name. Love Tacos, but not so much fish.  This is now a regular item on our menus.

haven't made this one...but cabbage is a good alternative to co!e slaw and creme fresca is a better sub for ranch dressing... don't nuke the tortillas...better to heat in a pan...get more crunch if that's what u like...and a simple pico de gallo with avocado is the best.

Loved this recipe... had never had fish tacos before.  Was able to use fresh caught  cod from Alaska.  Followed recipe, however used batter from another beer battered fish recipe from allrecipies  that includes cinnamon which gave it an extra flavor boost, however was not sweet.  the combination of ingredients were amazing.  Will definitely  make this again.

Thank you so much for this one!  I love everything about it. The coleslaw mix with the Ranch dressing is so good and the chili garlic sauce added to the already perfect taste.

Awesome! I halved the salsa and used store bought beer battered chicken because it was on sale, quicker, and much less clean up. They were amazing! You gotta try them!

I saw this in the magazine and had to try it.  The family loves it!  I followed the suggestions in the magazine and halved the salsa ingredients and used more ranch dressing for the coleslaw. I think I will try green onions next time because I don't like the taste of raw onions. I used catfish fillet because it was cheaper (tastes great!) and used water to make the batter instead of beer since we don't drink. The Sriracha is a MUST for flavor. Finally, I will try flour tortillas next time because the corn are just too small.

I didn't try them yet, but had to comment after seeing them in the issue of allrecipes magazine. I loved your story! You say to stack 2 tortillas on a plate and actually show them that way above. Somehow in the magazine, they show two tortillas on a plate, but not stacked and each filled. Before I serve them, I was wondering does it make 12 or 24 filled tortillas? Sorry to rate the recipe before trying, but had to so the comment would post.

We LOVE fish tacos - I would suggest instead of the ranch dressing for the cabbage to use sour cream, lime and a little garlic salt or if you can get it use Mexican Crema.  I didn't have a box of batter mix so I used Fish Batter with New Castle (but I didn't use New Castle ale - instead I opted for Corona) The recipe is from this site.  A squeeze of lime and a sprinkle of salt on the fish when it comes out of the fryer is a great touch.  We used Tapatio hot sauce instead of Sriracha.  Thanks for a nice lunch!
