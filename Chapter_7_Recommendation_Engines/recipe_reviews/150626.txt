Just wanted to point out that this recipe is for Risengroet, not roemmegroet.
Roemmergroet is made with soured cream.

It is a OK recipe though, for risenrgoet.
I would skip the Cardamom pods and just add 1/4 tsp of ground cardamom if you really want the cardamom flavor. Risengroet usually does not have that flavor added. Some people add vanilla flavoring though.
I would also skip the sugar, as most people will want to add sugar to the top along with some butter and cinnamon.
Growing up in Norway this was a typical Saturday lunch:)

Yum. I made some substitutions and it was still great. I used nutmeg instead of cardamon, 3/4 c sugar and skim milk.

Turned out wonderful, I did make a few adjustments because I started with cooked rice but this was fantastic.

I'm a rice pudding lover! I thought this was a great recipe, although I'm not a huge fan of the cardamom flavor. It was lovely and creamy!
