I tried this recipe and it did not turn out good at all. It did not set like a cheesecake should and it tasted like Dream Whip with a lot of added sugar.

This cheesecake was great, easy to make and great taste.  It tasted even better after a couple days.  I used a 9x13 pan and we got more servings.  I put canned cherry filling on it.

Turned out pretty well - next time I think I'll add cardamom into the crust just because I like to have a little more flavoring.

It's very sweet and very creamy. I would add a little more butter to the graham cracker crust so it gets more solid (mine came out crumbly).
