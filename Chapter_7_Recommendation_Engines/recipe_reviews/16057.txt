I attempted to make these for my husband for Valentine's Day.  While they tasted great and were very rich, I'm giving it a 3-star rating because it was not as easy a recipe as it seemed.  As I anticipated, the truffle mixture did not come out of the heart molds.  And the chocolate to dip it in needed to be thinner for better coating.  I've seen several other truffle recipes that add vegetable oil to make it easier for dipping.  I would suggest adding oil to the chocolate for dipping and not putting the truffle mixture into molds.  Great recipe, but it needs some modification.

It's not quick, or "easy" per se, but definitely worth your efforts.  I really enjoyed making them for this Valentine's Day.

While I could not manage to make actual truffles out of this recipe, the resulting spooned-out blobs that were delicious.  As far as thinning out the dipping chocolate goes - try adding some Kahlua (or similar liqueur) and milk as needed to thin & flavor the chocolate.  Add flour back in if you want more flavor.

These tasted phenomenally, but were a pain once put in the mold.  I had to scoop them out with a spoon and re-shape them because they would not come out of the mold.  The soft consistency meant none of the normal tricks (freezing for a few seconds, running hot water over the bottom of the pan, banging the pan, etc.) would work.  I'd suggest spraying the mold with some cooking spray before you put the chocolate in the mold or not even using the mold at all and maybe shaping inside cookie cutters.  Even though they didn't look too beautiful, they sure tasted GREAT!

These taste amazing! I didn't have a mold so I put them in a mini muffin pan. They didn't come out though, so I scooped them out with a spoon and took a small cookie cutted and cut the shape out of them that I wanted. Everyone was right about the dipping in chocolate part, it needs some oil. Also, I did not have any gold leaf so I dipped mine in cocoa. Delicious!

Too hard to make, I like the idea of oil and will try that next time.

Just a suggestion for those of you who want to use a mold.  Try an onigiri mold.  They are molds used for japanese rice balls but come in different shapes.  It has two sides so one side is exposed once opened.

The truffle filling is wonderful, but these were a pain to dip! I used silicone heart shaped molds that I had gotten from Michaels, and sprayed them with a bit of non-stick spray. I had no issues with getting the truffles out of the molds, but when I tried to dip them in the warm chocolate, the truffle began to melt, and made a huge mess. The filling is quite soft anyways, and even though it was chilled when I tried dipping them, they still started melting and the chocolate didn't want to stick (I think because of the non-stick spray I used in the molds). If I were to make these again, I'd just use a small cookie scoop and scoop them in balls and roll them in powdered sugar, nuts, or cocoa powder, like a normal truffle.
