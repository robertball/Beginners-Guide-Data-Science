Okay...I made my own version not because I wanted to....I had no Teriyaki mix or mushroom soup so I had to improvise. (too busy to shop for 2 things)  Campbells vegatable soup Knorr Chinese Style Rice seasoning  I also didn't have enough of frozen veggies, but it was enough considering I had vegetable soup which is perfect :)  It tastes good, I like it. I could of turned better if I had mushroom soup and maybe tariyaki sauce. I willl be doing it again in the future but I rather try something new 'n theres a whole lot of recipes out there!

A quick and easy recipe! We don't use instant rice, so I just used cooked regular rice. Also, I shredded the chicken into it. Made it way easier to serve. For the most part, an awesome recipe!! :)
