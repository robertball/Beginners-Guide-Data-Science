This is a very simple recipe which turns out great! I tweaked the recipe just a little, using granny smith and macintosh apples. I also mixed a pinch of nutmeg, about 1 tsp of cinnamon, and about 1/2 tsp of vanilla in with apples before putting the crumb topping on. Turned out wonderful, even better with ice cream.

I have made dozens of apple pies and apple crisps using different recipies - this is hands down the BEST I have tried.  Lots of crispy, sweet (but not too sweet)and yummy topping.  I added 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts, and it added a great crunch, but not necessary.  So quick and easy to make too.

Excellent recipe...a nice alternative to time-consuming apple pie! So easy!! Like some other reviewers, I baked this in a 9x9 pan and it fit perfectly. I put the last 1 tblsp cinnamon on top of the apples instead of on top of the crust. I sprinkled 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 cup brown sugar on top of the apples also. Came out delicious! Thanks.

Easy and very yummy!  I replaced some white sugar with brown sugar.  Apples were a little mushier than I like so next time I will probably only bake for 40-45 minutes.

Was very easy to make. I followed some other reviewers and used half a cup brown sugar, half cup of white and a little vanilla.  I wasn't so sure about all the butter but it turned out great. Both my husband and my daughter loved it.

This recipe was super simple and super delicious!  My kids 7 and 10 like to help me in the kitchen and this is simple enough that we whip it up in a flash and then all stand around the oven waiting for it to come out.  It fills the house with such a wonderful aroma that family and guests always comment!  We do add an apple or two more but otherwise it's great as is.

This apple crisp is addicting with the changes I made: I sliced the apples very thin and tossed them in a few splashes of lemon juice 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon sugar before putting them in the baking dish. Then I put half of the butter on the apples then the other half on the crisp topping and also added 1/4 tsp vanilla extract to the topping. I baked it for 50 minutes and it turned out perfect I will definitely make this again!

Easy & yummy, but I'm not sure this is the "perfect" apple crisp...I am going to test out a few more this fall before I decide.  I added some brown sugar before the topping, and at 45 min it was plenty done.  Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Leftovers were almost as good as fresh.

I teach practical and economical cooking lessons, however, I hate desserts because of the exact measurements and not so sure results.
I went blind with this recipe with my students and it was an absolute success. I would definetly recomend no changes, alterations or aditions.
This dessert is as good as is gets!

This was a great apple crisp!  I tried it as is and found it wonderful.  On the second try I took the advice of serveral folks and reduced the oats.  I also added a teaspoon of nutmeg and a tablespoon of vanilla. In addition, I doubled the topping and put half on the bottom of the buttered pan and half on top of the apples, YUM.  Once I had cut the apples and placed them in a bowl I added 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon, mixed them up and let them sit while I prepared the pan.  After the crisp had cooled a bit I put carmel on top.  Sweet!

I actually used regular old-fashioned oatmeal and it turned out fine! Had a more rustic look. If you only have regular oatmeal, you can always chop it up in a food processor first (I didn't do that though). Also covered with tinfoil for the 30 min and let cook for 20 min uncovered.

Followed the directions of others using 2 granny smith and 4 mcintosh apples; sprinkled pinch nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract in with apples in pan.

For the topping also used 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar; I just sprinkled it on with my hands to make it even, sprinkled walnut crumbles on top  and drizzled 1/8 c butter on top. Yummers. now just have to find that vanilla frozen yogurt to go with it...

Very much like the way I make my apple crisp. Only I don't melt the butter but mix in 1 stick (1/2 cup) into the the flour mixture. It has a better texture if the butter isn't melted. And I use brown sugar- not white. The only thing I put on the apples before the flour mixture is cinnamon red hot candies. (Less fat, and the extra butter is not needed.) The candies gives the apples a nice pink color and wonderful flavor. There's no need for other cinnamon. I bake for about a half hour.

DELICIOUS. We made this for Christmas dinner dessert this year, and it was so homey and warming. It is simple, fast to assemble, inexpensive... everything you could ask for in a delicious treat! I'm thinking of giving jars or packets of the dry mix as gifts, it's that yummy. A couple notes: first, I've been using Galas and it is just as good as tart, just a milder taste. I like to sprinkle a Tbsp or so of tapioca over he fruit (as you would a pie) to keep the juices from being too watery. Also, that is a LOT of cinnamon; I actually like it better with less than 1Tbsp. Start with less and see what you think. When you're putting the topping together, first add the sugar to the melted butter and THEN add the flour and oats - otherwise the butter soaks right into the flour and turns gluey. Make sure it's crumbly and not doughy before you spread it over the apples, and feel free to cut back a bit of the butter on top. I did by accident, and it was still great. Enjoy!

This was great! I won't say it was "oh so easy" because, after all, you do have to peel, core, and slice a lot of apples (which I HATE!) :) But the topping is very simple, and as a whole I got rave reviews with this! I did make 1.5 times the amount of topping, and reduced the butter- I just used however much it looked like it needed. I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  I also reduced the cinnamon, again, working by eye, but I probably used a total of about a teaspoon. Also, to add a bit of subtle sweetness, I drizzled honey over the sliced apples in the dish before I sprinkled the topping over. Skipped the dotted butter on top, served with vanilla ice cream, and all in all, it was delish!

I use this recipe when ever I have extra apples. BUT I cut and core the apples ( put them in a bowl of cold water and some salt to keep from getting brown) Drain when done -and add sugar, little flour or cornstarch and some cinnamon to the apples Stir and let them sit a bit to get the juices flowing then I put in the pan and carry on with the rest of the recipe. I have never done it by just putting apples in the pan and putting the topping on. I would think the apples would be bland. This never lasts long at our house!

Simple & fast.  Delicious on its own and even better with some vanilla ice cream.  I have done this numerous times.  Following the recipe as it is – is the best.  Some mistakes I have done – always use tart green apples because the sugar in the topping is just right for the tartness in the apples.  Also the tartness lends a nice flavour to the topping – it is a nice contrast.  If you have to use red apples, reduce the sugar in the topping.  Also the apple and topping ratio is just right – too much of apples and less topping spoil the taste of the whole dessert.

super super easy...used half brown sugar and 1.5 tsp of cinnamon total.  Tossed apples in some of the brown sugar and a sprinkle of cinnamon before placing in pan.  If crisp looks too dry during baking sprinkle with a bit of water.

Tasty.  I left out the extra 1/4 cup butter for the topping as I thought the 1/2 cup I already used was fattening enough. Also instead of the sugars, I also substituted Splenda & brown sugar substitute, & it was fine.  I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars as I thought "apple crisp II" was just a little better.

Mixed all the dry ingredients and put in zip lock bag.  Hauled apples and butter along with bag to a friends house and put it together.  How simple and delish.  They raved about it.  Will definately fix it again.  Thanks.

This is a great, easy recipe, but the apples were really mushy (like apple sauce). Next time, I'm going to cook for 35 to 40 minutes and test the apples with fork before taking them out.

Great recipe although I made one adjustment.  I love cinnamon and usually add more to any recipe but I halved it to one Tbsp.  Also made it in a tart pan.  It was great!  Even my partner, who is usually pretty picky said it was great.

Quite good as is, not too sweet and has nice texture.  I think I will add a bit of vanilla as at least one reviewer suggested next time - that sounds amazing.

A simple, good recipe and a solid "4" with sweeter apples than recommended.  I halved the amount of apple but kept the topping as written and baked the crisp 40 minutes in a glass casserole dish.  I used 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 white instead of the 1 cup sugar, as I used Gala and Braeburn apples instead of a tart apple.  I did mix the cinnamon into the topping mixture-personal preference.   We liked the taste of the  topping but it was a little dry; next time I'll decrease the topping to 3/4 for half the apples, as we like a lot of the streusel on our crisp.

I loved this! I like apple crisp but hardly ever like the way it's prepared. This one was not only super-easy to make but so delicious. The crisp part was so crunchy. I also added a layer of shredded coconut on top of the apples. I've never had it with coconut before but I'll always add it now.

Quick, easy. If you cannot find good tart apples, this may be substituted with apple pie filling, just remember to skip adding sugar. Another delicious twist is adding chai apple flavored oatmeal for a richer, full bodied seasoning

Great recipe.  I actually melt the butter right in with the crumbly mixture and it keeps the topping crunchy for longer.

Very good stuff! I followed to a T. Only thing I'll change next time is to use maybe 6-8 cups apples instead of the 5. The apple/topping ratio was a little off. Otherwise, great recipe!

This came out delicious!  I followed the recipe, but I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract to mine.  My husband ate half the batch as soon as it came out of the oven!  I have never had a better apple crisp.  I will be making this again!

I used brown sugar instead of white, and 3/4 cup of melted butter instead of 1/2 cup. Overall it had a very good flavor, however my wife and I both thought it needed to be sweeter. I also used another's suggestion of 1/2 tsp. vanilla 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and 1 tsp. cinnamon mixed with the apples. Next time, I will mix a 1/4 cup of sugar with the apples, and 1 cup of melted butter for the topping (omit the 1/4 cup cut into pieces).

I've never made an apple crisp before, but knew I was in good hands when I saw the other reviews. I normally don't change up a recipe before I try it as is, but I did this time around. Instead of sprinkling the extra tablespoon of cinnamon over the top, I mixed it in with the apples. I also sprinkled brown sugar over the top once all put together. My family loved it - definitely a keeper!

Absolutely great!  We used honeycrisp apples, whole wheat flour and Splenda brown sugar and it turned out wonderful!  Not too sweet, the apples were slightly tart and the crust was crunchy - will definitely make again and again!

Ok, 4 stars because I made changes and I think I would not have liked it without the changes.  I mixed in 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon with the apples (the apples were very very tart).  I then used brown sugar in the topping instead of white sugar.  I just have never heard of white sugar in a crisp topping!  It was really good - and not too sweet at all.

This is a tasty recipe, but the topping didn't work too well for me.  I doubled up on it as 
someone else recommended but I didn't enjoy it as the juices didn't make it moist enough.
Live and learn....otherwise, it tasted very good!  Make SURE to use sour apples

I will admit that I used part of this recipe and part of another from this site (Apple Crisp II by Diane). The combo was a hit at our Thanksgiving! I added 2 tsp of vanilla-- one to the apple mixture and one to the topping. I used of variety of tart and sweet apples which I think helped the dish have the right amount of both sweet and tart.

Yum, Yum, Yum! We couldn't believe how good this was. I followed the suggestions others have made and put this in a 9x9-inch square pan, sprinkled 1 Tbsp. of remaining cinnamon on apples instead of on top, and sprinkled some brown sugar on the apples and mixed in 1/4 cup brown sugar into topping. Delicious!

I just made this and it turned out great!  Delicous crisp topping!  I sprinkled a little bit of brown sugar on the apples before adding the crumb mixture.  Would definately make this again.

We used less butter because after topping with the topping as directed it would have been swimming. We also used more apples because ours were very small.

I think this is the best apple crisp that I've ever attempted!!  I used 4 granny smith apples and I left the peels on.  I also used only half cup of white sugar and half cup of brown sugar.  I baked it in a 9 in. pie pan and it worked perfectly!  Next time I think I'll only cook it for 45 min. instead of 50 because the top got a little crunchier than I prefer.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I did make this easy recipe a little more complicated!  I used this as my base and based upon other reviews and other recipes, made the following changes: I used 8 small Haralson apples and 2 unripe pears (you could leave the pears out and add a couple more apples). I mixed them with 1/4 cup white sugar, 1.5 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/4 cup flour, 1 tsp each lemon and orange zest,  and 2 Tablespoons each fresh squeezed lemon juice and orange juice.  Poured into pan and then dotted with the 1/4 cup cold butter.  I used brown sugar for the topping, added another 1.5 tsp of cinnamon, and added a cup of chopped pecans.  Baked for 50 to 55 minutes..can't remember! The citrus note was nice for a change.

This stuff is WAY too good!  I've made it several times, when guests are over for a visit or when I'm in the mood for something warm and moderately sweet.  I always use brown sugar in my cooking, so that's what I used here.  I also added a pinch of ground nutmeg and ground cloves to the mixture.  No changes are necessary, of course.  Thank you for this recipe!

Very good, though somehow a bit dry for me (despite that butter). I thought the crumble part tasted really good, but I think I just like my baked apple desserts to have a bit of syrup to them, and this does not. I also agree with others - next time I will sprinkle the extra cinnamon directly on the apples rather than on the topping. But this couldn't have been easier to make, and I liked that there was no brown sugar so that I could just use Splenda instead (for the low GI diet I have to follow). Thanks for the recipe!

My mother-in-law always makes the best apple crisp until now!  This was just perfect.  I used margarine instead of butter and also added about 1 tbsp of nutmeg.  Thanks for a new family favorite.

This is perfect. My boyfriend and I would make a new one as soon as we finished the last one! We always used Gala apples - which seemed to hold their shape pretty well and were sweet without being over-the-top. I took this to an office party and got rave reviews, even though it had cooled down a bit and we didn't have ice cream! It is the best when piping hot with vanilla ice cream and a dash of cinnamon!

Used a mix of apples instead of just the sour apples, and was delighted with the recipe! There were no leftovers when I took this to a gathering of friends.

I have a boyfriend who wants his apple crisp, sweet but not too sweet, crunchy but also soft. I tried this recipe, and tada! he LOVED it and i did as well. I would increase the recipe a bit so it is not so thin in the pan, but that is it.

"This is wonderful."  That was my husband's response after trying this.  I did make a couple of changes.  I increased the ingredients by 1/2 as was suggested in some of the other reviews.  I also divided the sugar into 1/2 brown and 1/2 white.  The only other change I made was I mixed a little bit of ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg and vanilla with the apples before putting them in the baking dish.  The result was a sweet, crunchy topping with not-too-sweet apples beneath.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.

Oh my gosh! This recipe is great. It turned out so delicious. I did read the previous reviews and made a few changes. I used 5 apples, I made 1.5x the topping, I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and I used half the amount of cinnamon. It was so wonderful. I can't wait to make this for friends and family!

This recipe smells soooo good while it is baking I could hardly wait to dive in! I added quite a bit more topping because the crunchy stuff is what makes it for me. Thanks!

I did the split thing with 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also substituted a 1/2 tablespoon of nutmeg instead of cinnimon into the 'crunch' part.  This got rave-reviews from our guests!

Delicious and very easy to make. I doubled the topping as that is always everyone's favorite part. Served with Breyers Vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. It was a HUGE hit. I was SO proud.

Very tasty..try adding 1/2c chopped walnuts to crumb mixture and mixing half of crumb mixture to apples then other half on top before baking.  Adding dried cranberries/yellow raisins to apples is a nice variety.  LOVE this recipe..especially with Granny Smiths.

I am not an experienced baker and very rarely cook desserts, but I was in an Autumn mood and craving apples.  I scaled to 4 servings, replaced some of the white sugar with brown, added some chopped walnuts to the apples and also added some nutmeg.  Needed a shorter baking time due to the smaller size, I think I pulled it out after 40 minutes.  Some of the apples that peaked through the topping became leathery from baking so next time I need to be sure they are covered.  Think I'll cut back on the sugar a bit next time. This was easy and turned out very well!

Very tasty and extremely simple recipe. I did add brown sugar and cinnamon to the apples as well as dotted them with butter prior to adding the topping. Speaking of, the topping is substantial but I am a topping fiend so this works out for me. I did fail to peel the apples before I sliced them (Martha Stewart mandolin) and was concerned that the skin would wreck it all.  The slices were thin enough that the skin made no noticeable difference, so next time I will skip the peeling. Also, next time I will increase the apples to 8.  Outstanding recipe! Thanks for sharing KERI_B, I will be using this for years to come.

We had this for breakfast, so we didn't have it with ice cream.  It was very sweet.  I didn't use tart apples because I didn't have any.  The topping didn't cook together like I thought it would, so it was more of an "Apple Crumble" instead of an "Apple Crisp."  I like my "Apple Crisp" to be crispy on the top and gooey on the bottom.  :)

I mixed a little sugar and apple pie spice with the apples before putting the crumble topping on.  I also used 1 tbsp. of apple pie spice instead of the cinnamon.  On top of the crumble, before baking, I grated some fresh nutmeg and sprinkled only about 1 tsp. of apple pie spice.  Came out perfectly - THANKS!!!!!!!

This recipe was a total disappointment. I can't believe it had so many 5 star reviews. I served it for  a family gathering and politely no one commented on it. The cinnamon was too strong- 1 TB is way too much and I like spicy. I would never make this again.

This is the second apple crisp I have tried on this site and it was far superior than anything I have ever made.  I had this for dessert for 12 people and everybody loved it!  I did make just a few minor changes, like most others: I used 9 apples; I only used brown sugar; I melted all the butter and one and a halved the topping.  After 50 minutes, the topping was perfect!  Will definitely make this my apple crisp recipe to go to!

DELICIOUS! I've made many different apple crisp recipes, but this one is now my favorite. It was easy to make and the taste was just perfect. I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it!
I'm sure you could add nuts to give it extra crunch, but it's really unnecessary, just a matter of personal taste. Most enjoyable!

This is AWESOME! I doubled the crisp and put half on bottom then put in apples then topped with remainiung half. Also I used 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar and soaked the peeled cut apples in brown sugar and cinnamon while I prepared the crisp. I added about a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg also. Superb, my guests raved!

I actually just used the "crisp" portion of this recipe for an experimental blackberry crisp. Makes a good crispy, flaky top!

This was a liitle too white-sugar sweet for me. There are other crisps on here I like better.

A Five for taste!   I will make this amount in an 8x8 pan next time so it is not so thin.  I could easily eat the whole pan by myself straight out of the oven.

There is beauty in simplicity and in this recipe! My husband and I were having a house warming party and we needed a few items to serve up. I made this using the left over apples from the family tree (Gala?) and it was not only a big hit, but it all gone right away! I'll be making this one again. Thank you!

Yum! I made this for the husband to take to work. (A change from my usual apple crisp recipe.) His exact quote after tasting this was “I put it in my mouth and just made me happy!” Hey, it’s pretty good to make a busy paramedic happy! I guess this is my new recipe for apple crisp. I did use 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown, but other than that I made the recipe as stated. Thanks, Keri, for the great recipe!

This was the first apple crisp I've ever made and, OH...MY...GOSH. It was so good! I would eat it for every meal if I could! :) 
I took the advice of many reviewers and multiplied the topping by 1.5, and instead of just white sugar, I used half white and half brown. I also only used 5 apples, but I think 6 would be fine too.
I will DEFINITELY be making this again. My boyfriend can't stop talking about it! :)

Hot, cold, with icecream, with out, no matter how you eat this, its incredible.  Don't even bother putting it in dishes.  Just grab a spoon and dig in when its done!  Use 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.

This is an excellent recipe for a classic, crumbly apple crisp. I would use a little less cinnamon, especially if you're using sweeter apples. It stayed fresh in the fridge over a week later, and is very tasty cold, too.

Haven't actually made this, but it looks too good not too. I like the swapping of brown sugar for some of the white and I will add some almond slivers. This looks like it's begging for ice cream or vanilla sauce.

Great recipe!  We changed the recipe a bit - we used one tbsp cinnamon in the crust, but didn't sprinkle the second tbsp overtop of it.  We also added approx. 3/4 cup of chopped pecans to the crust.

This needs a lot of improvement. The topping mixture was okay, but none of the cinnamon and sugar got down to the apples. I am going to search for a better recipe. I thought with the high reviews it would be better. The crust was too dry and the cinnamon on top was just WAY too much. I probably would skip putting the cinnamon on top and just mix the apples in with it (and some sugar) instead. I used half brown and half white sugar per other poster  suggestions.

Two simple changes to take this recipe from good to great:
1. Use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar.
2. Put 1 tbsp cinnamon directly onto the apples and 1 tbsp in with the oat mixture (i.e. skip the second tbsp on top of the oats).
This is so easy to make and is a delicious treat.  Enjoy it warm!

This was great!  I didn't have the quick cooking oats but I did have some scottish oatmeal which is coarser and I really liked the extra crunch it gave.  I may try the Irish steel cut oats next time.  Excellent recipe overall and a really really simple way to use up some less than fresh apples.  Update: actually I forgot I used brown sugar instead of white too which I think gave it some good flavor too.

I chose to try this recipe because my boyfriend likes fruit desserts (pie, cobbler, etc.) and it seemed like it would be easy to make. I didn't read any reviews prior to making this (usually I do), and I'm glad I didn't. The recipe is perfect as is, and the prep is super easy. Because the recipe suggests using tart apples, I made mine with Granny Smiths. I used my apple slicer/corer, which made the prep even easier. Baked for 50 minutes, and the apples were almost the consistency of applesauce. Served with vanilla ice cream, and it was heaven! The sweet, crumbly topping with the tartness of the apples is the perfect combination. I may try using brown sugar next time. But, I may not because it is soooo good as it is.

This recipe is fantastic!!!  I tried this recipe with my sons, ages 6 and 3.  It was so easy to make, and it came out great. I added 1 1/2 cups of the rolled oats, though.  It was absolutely delicious.  A great quick and simple recipe to do with the kids.  Qiana B.

Next time I think I will only use 1/2 tbs of cinnamon on the top.  A bit too much for me.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I followed the recipe, except that I doubled the crumbly mixture, and layered about 1/3 of the mixture on the bottom and put the rest on the top.  Everyone LOVED it!

This was excellent!!  I split the sugar half brown and half white sugar.  Made some home made whipped cream because we didn't have vanilla ice cream on hand. It was perfect, will definitely make it again :)

Great recipe-  used brown sugar instead of white because I like the flavor better and used a bit less cinnamon.  Our family loves this.

Easy , easy, easy.  I need to have easy.  Like other reviewers I used half white and half brown sugar in the crumble and added cinnamon and brown sugar to apples before topping with the crumble.  Have also added blueberries or raisins when I had them for a twist (or to use them up)

This turned out really well. I reduced the amount of butter slightly and took others advice and sprinkled the second half of cinnamon directly onto the apples, along with about a teaspoon of vanilla sprinkled over as well. I also used about 2/3 brown sugar and 1/3 turbinado. Came out great!

I made this recipe following the directions and the topping ended up being one stick mess that I couldn't get to spread over the apples.  Did not turn out well, will not make again.

Well, I make pie all the time, so thought I'd try something different.  It ended up so delicious.  I made 1/2 the recipe without walnuts and half with and baked in two 8x8 pans.  I preferred with walnuts, but that's because I love nuts.  Husband liked without.  I love that half the crisp part goes on the bottom.

Very delicious! I wish I had pulled it out of the oven at 50 min though, since it got pretty mushy- I also don't know if my apples were responsible, as I've never cooked with Mutzu apples before. The crisp topping was delicious- I used half wheat flour and half white and don't think we were missing anything.

This recipe is so easy and delicious! Instead of 1 cup of white sugar, I added 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. But be careful.....this stuff is super addictive! :)

This was simple and delicious while warm. I used a sweet apple not a tart one and it still turned out great. It needed a little more butter dotted on the top though than called for. Maybe melted and drizzled over would have been a better way of distributing it? Very tasty and I will fix this again. Thanks for sharing this delicious dessert.

Super easy to make! Very tasty! I used granny smith apples and thought that the tartness made the apple crisp perfect and not too sweet.

Loved it. This is an easy fool proof crisp. I have made it three times. First time just as the recipe directs. The second time I put a a little less sugar in the topping and a little extra oats. And tonight I am experimenting with using it as a topping on my regular apple pie. I sweetened the apples only a little, added a tablespoon of tapioca, baked in the crust for 15 minutes then added topping. Wonderful.

Tasted great! I adjusted the recipe like some others did and sprinkled a little cinnamon and brown sugar on the apples and used a little less than 1 cup sugar in the topping. It turned out great and using a 9x9 pan worked well.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this !! Just got it out of the oven a few mins ago and me or my husband could WAIT to eat it!! The recipe was very easy and quick I did use half white sugar and half brown sugar. Also when I peeled the apples I lightly tossed them in some (Dark Brown sugar) added a lil water and let that sit while I did the rest. I also put the last Tbsp Cinn on top of the crisp with a lil bit of brown sugar. YOUR RECIPE ROCKS! MY NEW FAV!! Thanks so much!! Just in time for the Holidays:)

Very, VERY good!  I took another reviewer’s advice and put the second tablespoon of cinnamon directly on the apples, but I don’t think it would really matter.  I also sprinkled extra cinnamon on top because I like a lot of cinnamon with my apple desserts.  The first time I made this I used golden delicious apples since they were the ones I had in the refrigerator and like the best.  I used more than the called for 6 apples since they were a little small.  The second time I used Granny Smith apples.  It wasn’t quite as good as the first batch, but only because the apples are a little more tart.  Still, it was excellent.  Great with a cold glass of milk.

I made this recipe last night, it was wonderful but I think I cut the apple slices to thin.  I did follow the advise of others and sprinkle some cinnamon on the apples before the putting the topping on.  My husband enjoyed it so much he asked me to make it again tonight (A first for him!!) This one is a keeper.

Yummy!  Don't be afraid to use more apples...stack them high in the pan as they will flatten while cooking.  Love the fact that there is no need for a crust!

This was very good; although next time I'll cut back on the sugar as some guests said it was too sweet.  I made one & a half times the topping & added a couple more apples.  I served it warm with cinnamon ice cream... yum!

I made this at the last minute tonight with my 4 year old son who loves to "help" while dinner was cooking. The great thing is that all this was all in our kitchen already! The only apples I had were a bag of small gala apples which are kind of sweet- used 8 of these small apples - added some lemon juice to them before putting the topping on - came GREAT! Made is exactly as on this recipe. Will make again - everyone loved it!

AMAZING!!  The best I've every had (hubby agreed).  I was looking for a recipe that used regular sugar, not brown.  I used Fuji apples because that's all I had, and it added to the sweetness.  It was very tasty, not too sweet.  I was leery about the tbs. of cinnamon on top, but it really added to it.  DON'T SKIMP ON THE CINNAMON!!  I also baked it in a 8in square pan but didn't use any less ingredients.  Thanks for sharing!!

As recommended by other reviewers, I made 1.5x the topping and I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar when making this recipe.  It was really easy to make, but the taste was just okay.  I used 6 Granny Smith apples and think I should have added more.  The apples reduce quite a bit when cooking, and with the extra topping there wasn't enough apple.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and think the apple crisp would have been a little bland without it. I think this could be great with a little experimentation, though.

I made this the other night for my Fiance and our friend- the guys loved it-I made it as per the directions, but added a little more butter to melt on the top while baking.  I used 6 granny smith apples.  I served it hot with French Vanilla Ice Cream on top, and the entire batch was GONE!  A big hit, will make this one again.  Very easy with full flavor. I highly recommend this one!

I tried this because of all the great reviews but I have tried this three times thinking I was doing something wrong, but each and everytime it has flopped. The crust doesn't develop properly, and by the time I have cooked it long enough for the crust to even brown slightly the apples have turned into mush. All the ones I have had before had brown sugar in it, I even tried substituting with it, but it didn't work.  The topping was much too dry, with applesauce underneath(and I have tried different apples)

This apple crisp was the best I've ever had.  Im not usually a fan of apple recipes, but this was incredible.  I was serving a "sweet tooth" audience so I mixed in white chocolate and butterscotch chis to the crumble and used half white, half brown sugar.  Everyone loved this recipe!! Very tasty!

This turned out excellent...I'm glad I read the reviews though.  I tweaked the recipe slightly by adding 1/2 brown sugar (a must when making an apple dessert).  I also used 1 1/2 times the topping.  Fantastic served warm with vanilla ice cream!

I changed a few things. I poured a little bit of maple syrup over the apples (I'm a maple fiend), I added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the mix, and I also split up the last tbsp cinnamon and put half of it mixed in with the apples, and the other half on top like I was supposed to. It was very flavourful, I find a little too much cinnamon in spots, and sometimes beyond crunchy to the point of just being really hard. I'm not quite sure why... So far, the best apple crisp I've made from this site, perfectly sweet, looking forward to making it again. Thanks!!

A very good recipe that everyone loved.  Next time I make this, however, instead of placing dolops of butter on the top I will melt the butter and pour it all over the top for a crispier taste .  All in All this recipe was a HIT!!

This recipe is EXCELLENT!  I have tried many apple crisp recipes and there is always something about them that isn't quite right.  THIS, however, is just about perfect.  I followed some other reviewers' advice and did the following: used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also doubled the topping recipe (I made it the way it says in the original recipe, but when I put it over the apples, it wasn't nearly enough...and isn't the topping always the best part?)  I did not sprinkle the remaining cinnamon over the apples as someone else suggested, but followed the recipe's instructions and sprinkled it over the topping and it turned out great.  Thanks Keri C.!!

I'm revising my previous review (which was 5 stars all the way for the recipe exactly as is).  I made this again last night with pears, apples and dried cranberries.  I replaced some of the cinnamon with ginger, 1/2 the white sugar with brown and added about 1/3 cup of chopped walnuts--SUPER!  I also left the peel on the pears and apples.  I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe.  Next, I'm going to try replacing the flour with whole wheat flour to see if I can squeeze in a bit more fiber....

SO delicious! I did the 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar an the topping was fabulous! My little apartment smelled like my Granny's kitched used to for hours last night!  **Tip for those who like to bake with apples a lot... Get thee an apple peeler!! I got mine for Christmas and it is quickly become an invaluable kitchen tool.  Perfect for those who like to bake with apples, or those who have children who enjoy a peeled apple snack.  The Starfrit peeler is inexpensive and I find works perfect... it sure saves time!

This was great!  I took advise from other reviews and cut the white sugar in half and added half of a cup of brown sugar, which I thought was great.  I used Granny Smiths.  It is best warm right out of the oven!

Just about perfect! I used the cup of oats but didnt have cinnamon so I added a packet of cinnamon spice instant oatmeal. The added oats filled out the topping nicely. I used 3 granny smiths and 3 fujis.. The office loved it too!

Even though no one in my family liked this, I loved it so I'm giving it 5 stars! It was easy and just the right amount of everything. I did make the brown sugar substitution though and I'm glad I did because I really like the brown sugar flavor. I even substituted some zucchini for apple because I didn't have enough apples and they were indistinguishable! I thought the 50 minute bake time was just right.

Quick and tasty! I was making it for a date, so I just cut the recipe in half (but with an extra apple). I was surprised it worked out so well!

Tried it, and realized I didn't have butter, so I used half margarine and half golden crisco.  It didn't effect the taste at all and turned out wonderful.  I prefer using brown sugar when cooking with  apples so I did that too.  Wonderful!!

I modified the recipe slightly by sprinkling some cinnamon and brown sugar on top of the apples before putting the crumbs on top.  It was very tasty - especially served warm with ice cream.

Oh..My..God.  This is the BEST recipe for Apple Crisp I've ever used.  It turns out perfectly with butter or margarine, and is divine when served hot with a side of vanilla bean ice cream!  This NEVER fails to impress or satisfy!

I found the apple crisp to be a little sour, so mix the apples with some sugar before adding in the mixture of oats and flour.  Another helpful hint is to mix half of the oats mixture in with the apples and then leave the other half on top.

This is a great recipe. I took the advice of another reviewer and used a smaller baking dish. I won't put the cinnamon on top again as it got rather dark looking. I will sprinkle on the apples as another viewer suggested. I served it warm with french vanilla ice cream. Yummy!

This is the best apple crisp recipe that I have found so far.  I enjoyed the crispy topping. It doesn't get soggy. The only thing I won't do next time is add the remaining cinnamon on top. I would prefer to sprinkle that on the apples instead. Loved it!

The crust and apples are both done at the same time,and the apples don't sit in goo at the end-- everything stays very crisp.

Made this apple crisp today...it is very easy and not time consuming.  I did half everything since it is only my husband and I.  I did use a dark brown sugar and lots more cinnamon than what it calls for because in my opinion you can never have enough cinnamon

Loved it.  The melting of the butter made the topping so much easier to make and it turned out amazing.  I just had a small pan so I used half the sugar and omitted the extra butter at the end and it still turned out fabulous.  Thanks :)

My first attempt at apple crisp, and it came out well.  There's a LOT of butter, perhaps as a result of which the topping is maybe a little heavy but ours was still crisp and the whole thing delicious, and very easy to make. I did cook it in a hotter oven (375) for less time (about 35 min).

I have looked at several other recipes "after" baking this one today. The only part of this recipe that my son and I felt was very delicious...was the crumble topping. Looking at the ingredients of other apple crisp recipes it looks like we should have used an 8 x 8 baking dish instead of the 9 x 13 dish this recipe called for. Also the temp. should be 375 and not 350. Additional ingredients and steps to prepare the sliced apples before putting on the crumble topping were needed as well. Too many changes are needed to make this a good recipe.

I made it and really loved it!!  No changes were made.  I especially loved the crunchy topping.  Think it would be great using blueberries & other berries instead of apples.  However, my fruit of choice is apples!!
Would make it again very definitely.

I've made this yummy dish so many times I felt it deserved a comment, or two!  I made some tweaks to the original recipe, most notably the sugar.  Instead of one cup white sugar, I use 1/4 cup white sugar plus 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Less sugar brings out the apple flavors.   I also had walnuts to the mixture.

Too much cinnamon, and the apples came out mushy. It probably did not need to be cooked 50 minutes - I used a mixture of granny smith and honeycrisp, which should have held up fine. It was also very thin, I think it would be much better if it were cooked in an 8x8. Though I wasn't a fan, I served it at a party and everyone else loved it. Could be that I'm just picky.

This was really easy to do and turned out wonderful. The apples were cooked through and the top was chewy and crunchy.  I used apple pie spice instead of just the cinnamon and baked 10 minutes longer.

This is my go-to apple crisp recipe for years now. Just getting ready to make a double batch for Thanksgiving. 
I change to half cup brown sugar, half cup white and leave out the cinnamon (personal preference).
The butter on top is essential!
Love it, everyone I share it with loves it, my kids can't get enough of it!  And it makes the house smell so delicious when it is baking -  smells like fall :)

I haven’t made this-I just have a question. A 9x13 pan makes 8 servings??????  Each piece would be 4 1/2” by 3 1/4”   That’s a very large portion. Usually a 9x13 pan is 16-18 servings.

I used half the amount of sugar and squeezed fresh lemon juice on the apples. Perfect- not too sweet as I had read in some other reviews.

This was really good! I was in a big hurry when I made it, so I peeled and chopped an apple, threw the slices in a bowl, nuked it for a minute, dumped it into my pan, and repeated 5 times. That cut out a bunch of baking time. Melting the butter for the topping was a great, quick shortcut compared to rubbing the butter into the crisp ingredients in other recipes. I did use brown sugar in place of white and decreased the flour a bit, because I like the crisp to be really oat-y.  This was a great base recipe. Go Nana!

Easy and Soooo Yummy!
It didn't have enough of the crumble (mine anyway) and was a bit runny.  I didn't know what to do so... I crushed up a package of Ritz Crackers and put it over the top and it came out wonderful!  Will definitely keep this in my dessert go to's.

Love this recipe!!  Very easy compared to the recipe I used in the past.  I used empire and red delicious apples in this.  Very good as is.  I may use 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar next time just to try.

WOW what a dessert!!  Fast and easy.  I did split the sugar with half brown and half white so it wouldn't be so sweet.  Crunchy topping was ideal. It was almost gone as soon as it came out of the oven.  Make sure the ice cream is ready to put on top.  I used gale apples  and put in a dash of nutmeg.  Will make again as I had many requests.  Should have given this 6 stars.

I love that this recipe is so forgiving in terms of how many apples, how much sugar, adding cinnamon and/or nutmeg or not, etc.  I used 1 T of cinnamon, and it was plenty for me.  2T seems like it would've been too much.  Super easy!

I made quite a few changes though. I used home canned plums instead of apples, coconut oil instead of butter, so I cut the sugar down by 1/4 cup, and I used steel cut oats instead of quick cooking. Mmmmmm, so tasty!

Easy to make but wayyy too much sugar. It tastes great at first but really sweet after you take a few bites. I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

Consider these changes: do not bake in such a large pan-- the apple layer is too thin. I wish I had used far less sugar and then I would have used white and dark brown. A blend of apple pie spices (allspice, nutmeg, ginger, cardamom, cinnamon) was good and I mixed the final sprinkle of cinnamon with butter. Otherwise it just stayed dry on top and more melted butter had to be poured on top to make it blend in. My friends were kind and said they liked it. I found it far too sweet. I don't suggest making this recipe without experimentation. Otherwise find another apple crisp recipe.

I made this in a 9x13 pan, and used more apples than the recipe called for.  I also added a pinch of nutmeg, more cinnamon, vanilla, chopped walnuts, and raisins.  I think the raisins are my favorite part, they added a nice chewy, sweet zing.  This was really tasty heated up with some vanilla ice cream.

I have been searching for a fruit crisp recipe for a while and now I've found it. This recipe is great. I tossed the apples in cinnamon and brown sugar and added a little brown sugar to th oat mixture. WONDERFUL!!

Really good, but I can see why people say this is excellent with ice cream - it's lacking some complexity.  I added a tablespoon of heavy cream to each serving to mimic the ice cream flavor and it was delicious.  Next time I'll make it with brown sugar and see if it has a richer flavor profile.

I got rave reviews on this recipe. The only thing I changed was that I used a little less sugar and I made it 1/2 cup white sugar and a 1/4 cup dark brown sugar. Tast was perfect! My family gobbled it up .

Very easy recipe, much easier than a few others I have tried. The topping was moist, I like that. I exchanged a granulated sugar substitute for the sugar and it was great, although next time I would decrease it by a tablespoon or two. I also used mostly pears with just a couple apples. I would make it again.

This was amazing! Even my boyfriend... the picky dessert-eater,  loved it! I used a maybe 1.5 qt pyrex baking/mixing bowl because that was all I had. I used 1/2 stick margarine and 1/2 stick butter for the drizzle, and then butter on the top. I didn't measure the cinnamon, but I forgot to put it on the very top. It was still wonderful! The other thing that I did was I used old-fashioned oats, and it ended up cooking for about 50 minutes simply because of the oats and I had an extra apple. I also added the teensiest bit of sugar on the top as it was almost done. You could smell it throughout the house and the apples were the perfect consistency! I am so glad I took a chance on this recipe as I was worried because I didn't have brown sugar! Give it a try! Served slightly warmed with two scoops of vanilla ice cream! :)

One of our family favorites. Sometimes it turns out better than others. When it is good it is GREAT! When it is not as good, it is still good. I have even way over cooked it and it is still good. Love no fail recipes!

Family loved this. Usted half white and half Brown sugar. Also added 1/3 cup flour, 1/3 cup sugar, a whole lime and1tsp cinnamon to apples. I don't think the additional 1/2 cup butter on top is necessary. Will definitely make this again

There seems to be way to much flour in this recipe.  CONS: The topping stayed like the sugary mixture I put on the top instead of baking together into a nice "crisp" mixture of sweet oatmeal.  The apples had no juice at all - again, probably because of the amount of flour.  PROS: The cinnamon flavor was nice and overall, if there had been a little less flour I think this would have been very nice.  I may try it again and only use 1/2 cup of flour and maybe a little less sugar too (that's a personal taste thing).

easy-peasy! 3rd time making this-yumm! This time-just for experiment, I cut down on butter -using 1/2 stick melted in the topping-the other 1/2 on the apples.looks good in oven and smells yummy! all I do for the apples is peel 6 of whatever I have on hand-this time 3 red delicious-3 granny smith,slice down to the core as close as I can get,then slice thin. I dont think this took me 15 min.,so I dont know what is so hard about that as one reviewer suggested. This is a keeper for sure!

When I saw it calls for two TBSPs of cinnamon I thought it had to be a mistake...nope, no mistake. I used steel cut quick oats and this turned out delicious! It's a keeper!

Loved it! The topping was a great base for me.  I added a sprinkle of ground ginger and some nutmeg to the cinnamon. Used wheat germ instead of oats. I only used the melted butter & didn't bother with the extra butter/cinnamon on top. Really delicious!

Preparing and baking this was a snap! I used 4 huge apples, which seemed sufficient.  However, I think if one wanted, they could add a few more apples to the recipe and it would be just fine.  I used less butter on the top, about one tablespoon dotted around. Whole oats was what I had on hand, they worked out well.  Also, I replaced 1/2 cup of the one cup of white sugar with dark brown and then used 1/2 cup white sugar. I will make this again.

I made this last night for dessert and it was SO good.  Reminded me of the apple crisps my Mom used to make.  I did add a little fresh nutmeg into the crumble and also on top.  Great recipe!

The recipe was easy enough and tasted good, but I prefer something a bit jucier.  Maybe it was the harelson apples I used, but thinking that was only part of what I didn't care for.  Won't be making this one again.... can't even get anyone to eat the leftovers.

This recipe was just like the one my mother made when we were young. It even stayed crispy in the refrigerator overnight. I made a lower calorie version using Splenda  brown sugar blend and it tasted great. This is my new favorite!

This recipe is super easy to make. My 13 year old daughter made it herself. The apple crisp turned out absolutely great.  One of the best apple crisps any of us have ever had.

This is a great apple crisp! I used 1/2 cup white sugar + 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of a full cup of white sugar. I also used just one tablespoon of cinnamon since that was all I had left.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly - my husband said this was even better than his mother's apple crisp that he grew up eating. Thanks for a great recipe!

The best apple crisp ever! I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  The crispy topping is fantastic. Thanks for the recipe!

This is one yummy recipe!!!  Instead of 1 cup of white sugar, I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar and it was yummy goodness.  It's the perfect fall dessert.  I will make this one again.

We added blackberries and it was delicious. The crispiness of the topping was excellent. I would make it again but add more butter, more fruit and a little less sugar.

This is the best apple crisp recipe that I have ever made.  I did change the sugar to 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 cup brown but everything else was as the recipe stated.  I made it for our card club last night and everybody loved it...I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I changed this recipe a bit.  I used whatever apples I had, a few Red Delicious a few Granny Smith.  I used a 9"x9" glass dish.  I put a little lime juice on the apples and about 1/5 cup sugar and a little cinnamon and coated the apples.  I sprayed the botton or the dish with Pam first.  I did the topping mostly as is but added 1/4 walnuts.  I cooked it on 350 for 50 minutes.  I just had a taste and it is very yummy! It would be awesome with some ice cream!

Not the best apple crisp I've ever had, not as juicy and sweet. But very easy to make and is a great use of those apples before you toss them!

My 9 year old daughter helped me make this dessert. Scrummy!!! It was so good, especially with a little vanilla ice cream on the side. We will definitely make this again.

DELICIOUS!! only suggestion would be to double the apples or decrease the topping in half.  Other than that this is a great recipe.

Yummm!!!! This was really easy and really good on the first try. I used Granny Smiths and did double the crisp mixture to make a pressed bottom "crust"and it turned out wonderfully. This will become a regular dessert item at our house for sure!

The only change I made was sprinkling some cinnamon on top of the apples before the crumble.  It is absolutely fabulous.  My husband said I never had to make an apple pie again.  Serve it hot with ice cream and some hot carmel and it is to die for!!

Since I found the recipe a week ago I have made them for everyone in our family, Great recipe the only thing I change, I used 3 different kind of apples and used 2 more apples.  Gave it a nice sweet and tart taste, personal prefence, don't like really sweet deserts.  Everyone loved it and I shared the recipe.

This is a great fall recipe. Easy to whip up to fancy up a simple dinner. Tastes better than an apple pie! My 8 years old said "This is so good." Mother in law asked for the recipe. This is going to be a fall tradition from now on.

I just made this recipe twice in the last 2 weeks and my boyfriend loves it!  The recipe was simple and straightforward and I definitely recommend it!  I did cut down on the flour/sugar/oat mixture (just too much topping for us) and tossed the apples with cinnamon and added a little bit of water to the apple mixture.  I also didn't add additional dabs of butter on top!

Easy and yummy. Used this for a kid's cooking class (10 and under), and it was a great tool to teach measuring basics and kitchen safety. Not to mention the kids LOVED it.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  It seemed like the topping lacked crunch and flavor and the pan size was too large for the volume I felt.  I won't be making it again.

I made this last week & the 3 of us loved it.  My son saw it as I was ready to put it in the oven, & noticed the oatmeal, & ask if those were nuts (he doesn't like them).  I said no, that it was oatmeal, & he said, "eeewww, why did ya have to put that in it?". Well, when he then tasted, he said he loved it!  Same w/the hubby (which never liked it w/oatmeal!). It's a keeper, just may use a few more apples next time.

This was perfect on this chilly fall day!  Found I didn't need to dot the top with extra butter, perfect without it.  Also added a dash of nutmeg.

This is not as good as  my regular apple crisp recipe.  In my opinion, it needed WAY more apples and spices and less topping.  That was after I sprinkled extra cinnamon, some ginger and cloves on top of the apples.  Next time, I'll stick with my old stand-by recipe....

This was the first apple crisp recipe that used oats and I really liked it.  Also I took it a healthier direction using splenda, whole wheat flour and smart balance spread.  I had to add more smart balance than butter because of the consistency of the topping but I'll be making this again next weekend with the rest of the apples...yumm!

I've been making this for years and it is wonderful!  The only thing i change is using 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar.  Serve hot with ice cream on top, nothing is better on a hot summer night.

this one was just OK for me. turned out a little dry. i like a lot of crunchy oats and gooey cinamon and sugar, which was missing from this recipe. apples remained uncooked and had to extend baking time to almost double.

VERY good...I did however use Pears since I didn't have any apples. I think there was a little too much butter and cinnamon so next time i'll use less butter and a tad less cinnamon. I also halved white sugar and brown sugar. Yum! served w/ vanilla ice cream! mmmm

This is a *wonderful* crisp recipie! The only down side is the guilt factor. I guess you could call it health food because there's fruit in it, and that would make you feel all better:) Definitely a keeper.

I really liked this. It was like eating a big oatmeal cookie with baked apples! My only deviation from the recipe was to make it in an 8" square pan: I only had 5 little apples. I made the topping as written, since other reviewers had doubled it, but it turned out to be too much topping for us. Next time I would make it in the correct proportions. The only thing I would change from the original recipe would be to not sprinkle the cinnamon on top. I only gave this 4 stars, instead of 5, because my husband didn't like the oatmeal: he said it made "a rough texture". Phht, what does he know?? ;)

This was so easy to make, and since I didnt have any brown sugar on hand, even easier! I only used half of the recommended apples (that way you get a lot of topping) and next time will use granny smith apples, or a sweeter apple and maybe add some fresh cranberries. It would probably be really good with pears too. Very good w/vanilla ice cream :-D

Update: I've made this so often I cant count how many times! Its my "go to" dessert when I have extra apples or pears (or both). Sometimes I add a few chopped walnuts or pecans to the topping before baking. This is hands down my hubby's favorite dessert.

this was pretty good - not as sweet as i'd thought it would be but i think that's b/c i tried to make 1 1/2 x the topping recipe and probably didn't put enough sugar in it.  i used only 4 granny smith apples and my dish was very full - they were really big apples though.  the peeling of the apples took a long time - but now i feel like a "peeling pro!"  i'll make this again with more sugar in the topping.

None of the flavors from the topping made it to the apples.  The crisp part was good, but I thought it had too much cinnamon.  And the apples . . . well, they just tasted like baked apples.  This would be better if the apples were tossed in some sugar and cinnamon before adding the topping.

This is not only the best apple crisp I've ever made, it's the best I've ever had! I used very tart apples and for the sugar, I used half white and half brown sugar. This went fast at my house - no leftovers to store!

Made this last night when I needed a quick "fall dessert" for a church potluck- YUM!  I doubled the topping (as suggested by others) and split the sugar half white/half brown.  Also added apple pie spice insted of plain cinnamon.  Will use this again.

I made this exactly as the recipe states and it turned out well.  I used the wrong apples, turned out too mushy, but the flavor was still good.  Not outstanding like the other reviews, but good.

I am ranking this with four stars because I was the only one in my family that thought it was outstanding.  The flavor of the topping was wonderful--almost like a shortbread.  Not overly sweet and very delicate.  I loved it.  Hubby and kids like a more traditional super-sweet topping.  I would definitely recommend this dessert.

WONDERFUL!  I used this recipe with fresh peaches and it was perfect!  I did use 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar and I used 1/2 c. oats and 1/2 c. granola that was sweetened.  This will be made again and again, especially since it is so simple to prepare!

Oddly enough, this did not turn out sweet enough for my taste.  I did use all brown sugar so that may have been why.  I used 6 large fuji apples which I thought would have been sweeter, but I guess not.  I doubled the topping (that's my favorite) and served this to company...who thought it was the "perfect sweet".

Yummy! Quick and easy to make. I can imagine that any fruit could take the place of the apples successfully. The only thing I didn't care for was the large quantity of butter the recipe called for. The recipe turned out great, but not without damaging my conscience...Next time I will make with half the butter and see how it turns out.

With all the rave reviews I expected this to be better. I guess I was expecting it to be "saucier" I can see why others suggest putting the remaining cinnamon directly on top of the apples instead of on top of the topping. Maybe I was expecting too much. It was tasty with ice cream, but I was just a little disapppointed with this.
