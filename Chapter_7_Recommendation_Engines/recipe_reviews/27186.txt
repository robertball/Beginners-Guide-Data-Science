Im the Food Service Director at a nursing home. We did this recipe at a candlelight dinner. Set up carts that went through the dining room and flamed each one at each table. Easy to make and the residents got a real kick out of it.

This did not work for me.The rum wouldn't catch fire. Turns out you have to use high proof rum. The apples tasted good at least. Don't do this for a group for the first time with out trying it first.
