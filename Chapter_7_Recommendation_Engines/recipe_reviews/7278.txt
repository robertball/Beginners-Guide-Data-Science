This recipe is EXCELLENT!
I work in a small fine food, wine and deli cafe/restaurant and it is one of our most popular cakes. I had a problem with it being to dry (the center was smooth and fudgey, but it got drier as it goes out). A quick stir of the batter during cooking solved it fast! I make a double recipe in a 28cm springform pan, crush chocolate biscuits ontop and serve it with cream and icecream. Great recipe.

I was a bit afraid that this would just be brownies in a round pan, but it definitely was not!  It was dense and fudgy, and the glaze came out absolutely perfectly.  Before chilling, I decorated the top with sliced strawberries - it looked great with little effort!  Keep this chilled at all times and serve with vanilla ice cream.

AWESOME!  I would rate 6 stars if there was one!
I made this in a square 9 inch and served it with whipped cream AND sliced strawberries.

This dessert was quick and simple to make.Out of 4 people ,2 liked it a lot.The cake part wasn't sweet enough although the frosting was very good!!I wound up making another batch of the frosting to pour over the slices as we ate it.I will make it again,just maybe add more chocolate chips or use a sweeter chocolate chip instead of semi sweet.

I love this recipe! It was very easy to follow, though next time I'd make more glaze. We used a christmas tree shaped baking pan and covered the whole thing with strawberries for our christmas eve party. Everybody loved it!
I might try using melted white chocolate or cream to decorate it as well another time...
Recipe is definitely worth trying.

This torte was outstanding and very easy to prepare!!!  
Fresh berries must be placed on top while the icing is still "wet" or they fall off.  I used fresh, dry raspberries, but any berry would work.
Loved it!

Extremely good.  Be sure to use good quality chocolate chips.  I think it makes all the difference.  My culinary challenged boyfriend made this for me on my birthday.  It was his first attempt at baking and it came out wonderfully.  We're not big on sweets so I thought for certain that we would end up freezing the leftovers.  Wrong.  The two of us ate the entire thing in 3 days.  Bad for the waistline, but good for the taste buds.  Maybe I'll make it for his birthday.

I made this torte in a round springform pan, it was high while baking but once I took it out it completly shrunk, to about half the size. I was also worried because it was pretty hard on top, but once I cut it open the inside was like a big gooey uncooked brownie!! I love this recipe, but for some reason the top of my torte was pretty hard and very chewy, I will try to get rid of that next time, but it was excellent of then that!

I love chocolate! I found that mine wasn't cooked after 30 minutes so I put it in longer. The outsides burned but the middle was perfect. I guess I have to experiment with my oven. My husband loved it though.

YUM!  Made this last night for a special meal.  I had to bake it close to 45 mins.  I did put it in a 8.5 springform pan.  It was gorgeous along with chocolate covered strawberries, sliced strawberries and a few raspberries.  I will absolutely make this again!

This was very good over all. The one problem I had was it took forever to bake. I had it in the oven for almost double the bake time. But when it was finally cooked it was delicious and well worth the wait.

This was okay, but not great.  I have no idea why, but it tasted sweet, yet not chocolatey.  It was fast to put together and looked nice, but I don't think I would make it again.

Yum. I made this as written except I doubled it to make 2- 9" rounds and layered strawberries between them. Turned out really good - I sent it to work with MrB and got the report that it was "outstanding." Thanks for the recipe!

it was alright great texture... however i found it too sweet although i have already taken out half the corn syrup and only used 1/3 of the sugar...  but i would imagine it to taste super good with whipped cream on the side

This was delicious.  It was a nice cap off to a big meal that I had made earlier in the evening.  It tasted like restaurant quality.  This would be great to serve for a dinner party, so easy to make too!  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was so rich and full of chocolate it kept my husband and me up all night on a sugar/caffeine high!  Wonderfully decadant!!!

Fabulous & oh so chocolaty! I did reduce the sugar to 1/3 of a cup and it had just the right amount of sweetness. Also for the chocolate glaze topping I used Red Raspberry syrup instead of corn syrup. It gave the it  a wonderful fruity flavor that complimented the strawberries & blueberries I garnished the top with. Everyone who ate it said they loved it! :) Several asked me to please make this again - especially my husband!

Impressive and worth the effort. I used very high-quality chocolate and I think that it made it so good. I suggest not cheaping out in the chocolate chips.

I'm not completely happy with the result, the edges were a bit dry and it's much more elastic than I thought: I was expecting something more fudgey... but the taste was quite good

This was a huge hit with my daughter's and their boyfriends. As I'm in the UK I used golden syrup which I think is pretty much the same as corn syrup. I did cut the sugar to a 1/3 cup and would do the same again. The glaze was very good and not too runny. I topped with a combination of strawberries and raspberries from my garden. Thankyou Wildflower 12.

Tastes like fudge after it's chilled.   The syrup glaze was too runny for me but I kept it for other things.  Personally I like layering my tortes with a nice whipped cream filling.

Used bittersweet chocolate instead of semi, and raspberries instead of strawberries. This is the most delicious thing I've ever baked, and SO EASY. Next time I'll be leaving out the walnuts for a smoother texture.

Excellent. This was beautiful. I made it in a square 9in pan because I do not have a round one and it turned out just fine. If you serve it cold it tastes almost like fudge.

Decadent!  Five people were rolling their eyes around in their heads as they ate this.  Very rich and chocolatey, and easy to prepare.  With strawberries on top it makes a beautiful presentation.

This torte is awesome.  I used semisweet chocolate chips and a double batch of the glaze.  Everyone loved it.  I froze individual slices between wax paper and they were even better (still soft like a torte), although I think next time I'll just use a single batch of the glaze if I plan to freeze it.

Very delicious, smooth and almost fudgey torte. It didn't, however, have as much chocolate flavour as I would like. I added 6 T of unsweetened cocoa power and it came out simply divine!

I wanted to make something chocolaty for dessert.  The only thing I had in the house was chocolate chips.  I served this with Breyers lowfat vanilla bean ice cream.  It was FABULOUS!!!

Sooo rich, dense and good! Not overly sweet, which was great because I usually have to cut back on sugar in dessert recipes, but this was perfect! I baked in pieces of my favorite dark-chocolate bar and blackberries for little gooey surprises here and there. This is going in my recipe box for sure.

This was my first time making a torte. Everyone seemed to like it but I thought it turned out a little dry.. having never tried a torte, i am not suer if that is how it is supposed to be. The strawberrys really make the dish and I will probably attempt it again sometime in the future.

Ehh... Not that impressed with this recipe. I think it's the addition of the corn syrup that makes this taste "greasy". Not much chocolate flavor either, and I used a good quality chocolate too.

Yummy recipe
I replaced the dark chocolate with white chocolate in the recipe and sauce and omitted the walnuts (thinking about adding macadamia nuts.  Served it on berry coulis.  Yum yum yum.

Oh the tip for stirring half way through was good although found it needed to be done no longer than 10 mins through or it wouldn't mix properly and became lumpy

This was amazing. I couldn't believe that I actually cooked something so decant, that really was little effort. I did follow another reviewers advice and gave the batter a stir about 10 min. after it was placed in the oven. The whole cake was so moist.  Do not skip out on the glaze, that is what gives the cake another level of richness. This was the perfect ending to our romantic Valentines dinner.

Wow.  This was a great little cake I brought to work to share with the girls.  It was easy to make and made a great presentation even without the strawberries.  I never made a ganache type icing before.  I was goooood!  I liked it even better left over.

My first foray into torte making.  It was very good---just like a brownie!  I drizzled caramel sauce over the top and sprinkled each serving with some roughly chopped nuts.  Everyone loved it!

I made this for my roomates birthday and it was delicious!  The torte came out nice and dense and the walnuts were a nice touch.  I used semisweet choco-chips for the first one and tried milk for the second one I made later in the week.  The semisweet was the best.  I am a huge fan of milk chohcolate so thought it would be good but was disappointed with the turn out.  Definately a better torte with semisweet or dark chocolate.  If you like the flavour of a brownie with a fancier look this recipe is for you!

This came out perfectly! I've made several brownies and cakes before, but never a torte, and this was simple, easy to put together and just as easy to decorate. I put powdered sugar and whipped cream over the glaze in a heart shape (it was a Valentine's day gift to a friend). Lovely! Can't wait to do it again.

Excellent recipe. The glaze was especially good. The only thing bad I have to say was the cake was a bit dry compared to some tortes I've ordered at restaurants. Also, i would probably make extra glaze next time.

This was "To Die For."  Easy to prepare which I loved!
Made for Valentine's day in a heart shaped pan.  Served with thawed sliced strawberries and whipped cream.  Oh my what a hit with the Hubby and then with my friends. Was better the second day!  Will make again!
Thanks

This is very rich and good I used semi sweet chocolate bars rather than chips I served with strawberries and fresh whipped cream. next time I will try raspberries.

Fabulous.  I opted not to use the glaze, and used homemade whipped cream instead.  It was very easy to make and every bit as delicious as any gourmet version.  Highly recommend!

This was indeed a very rich cake, and nice and chocolaty.  I chose not to add the strawberries, as suggested, but will be ore than willing to try them next time.  It seemed a little underdone(is that a word-grin), when I first took it out of the oven, but it was and it had a nice chewy center, that tastes like a brownie.  
The glaze was great too, it got thicker once the torte sat for a little.  A great chocolate recipe with a brownie twist--thanks!!!

I stirred the batter 10 minutes into the cooking and it came out wonderfully! I baked it in an 8x8 glass pan.   Don't skip the glaze, the torte itself is not that sweet but is perfect once the glaze is added.   I topped this with a few fresh raspberries and some raspberry jam.  BEST SERVED WARM so it's gooey!

Absolutely delicious.  This is a cross between brownies and rich chocolate cake.  Next time, I will use expensive chocolate.

My coworkers liked it, but I found it too dry.  The recipe was really easy and fun to make though.  If I make it again, I'll bake it for less time.  I used 60% dark chocolate chips from the grocery store - maybe better chocolate would have gotten the richer flavour I was expecting.

Amazing!  I read other reviews so I knew to put the strawberries on while the glaze was still wet.  I used margarine instead of butter and it was great.  My boyfriend would have liked fewer nuts but I liked it as it was (though I'm sure it would still be good with less).  The two of us finished this in under two days!  It is very rich but very, very delicious.

Delicious & easy. Big hit at bbq. I cheated and used a brownie mx. I put it in a torte pan and spread the sauce into the middle with strawberries circled and dark chocolate ganache swirled ontop. Very pretty and none left over!

The overall recipe is delicious and very rich.  Although, next time I will leave off the strawberries and put them on the side as a topping.  I sliced the strawberries and  put them on top and the next day they were soggy and overpowering.  I think they would be best to put on the side.  Great torte and glaze though!

This was fabulous and I can't wait to make it for a "company" dessert!  I tried stirring a few minutes into the baking and the edges still came out a little bit drier than the center, but it didn't take away from the taste at all.  Love it!

I have made this recipe twice and delivered it to friends for a special occasion.  It looked very professional - and everyone thought it was heavenly!  I did have a problem with the torte being perfect in the center - but a little dry toward the edge.  I will take the advise of a previous review and try to stir the batter while cooking and see if this helps next time.  Wonderful rich, chocolate dessert!  Definitely best if kept refrigerated!

I made this for bookclub and it got great reviews.  I made it exactly like the stated recipe, although next time I will serve with icecream or whip-cream. I also served with cut-up strawberries on the side.  This dessert tastes like an expensive bakery brownie!

I didn't put in walnuts because not a huge but fan but it turned out perfectly! I put it in for 30 and was super scared at first when I let it cool a little and saw how gooey it was in the middle, but after it set for a little bit longer it was the perfect fudgey consistency!

I usually mess up my desserts on the first try but this recipe came out just right. The center is chocolately rich and dense, though the top came out crusty after I pulled it out from the oven, I recommend cutting off the top layer before frosting it to have your cake even. I didn't have walnuts so I threw in what I had which were pecans and it came out wonderfully. I would follow this recipe again!

This was sooooo good. The baking time was perfect and there was no need to change a thing. It was chocolate heaven! I did make a little more glaze than the recipe calls for based on other reviews. Its like a thick, rich, decedant brownie only better
