The recipe is a bit different from the traditional butter tarts that we are used to. I found that the currants' flavors conflicts with the other ingredients. Overall, good recipe but I will go back to using golden raisins to suit our taste. Also 10 minutes was a little too much time as it overcooked the pastry shells. Perhaps our oven is a little hotter than most; keep an eye on your tarts.

So these were delicious.  Personally, no issues with the currant flavor and I love the pecan addition on top.  So tasty, but two basic issues took these from great to good.  Firstly, more direction needed on the pastry.  I wanted to tackle this as a first-timer challenge.  My later tarts, to which I added more water than was called for, worked out much better.  The dough needs to be faintly tacky to be truly flexible and go down in your cups without cracking.  Second, the filling is a tch dry.  I would like a gooey-er tart.  More cream?  Bears investigating!

Really good butter tarts.  Didn't have currants used raisins just drops 3 or 4 in the bottom of the cup. Great with a dab of ice cream.

These were DELICIOUS the only change I made was I cut up the raisins and made some with just pecans. Will definitely make these again.
