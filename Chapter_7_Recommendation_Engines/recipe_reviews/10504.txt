Absolutely great tasting! This was a favorite of my Dad's and eating them with my Mom had us thinking of fun times spent with him.  I did have trouble with the dough.  It was very crumbly where I could not form the dough into any sort of a form to bake.  I had to add 1 more egg and 2 more tablesoons of butter to the recipe.  It then was a little bit wet, but just a touch of flour to handle the dough worked fine.   I am a bit of a biscotti nut in that I love to bake all different kinds.  This BY FAR is the best biscotti recipe I have ever made.  Very Authentic in flavor.  Thank you so much Rosina for sharing this recipe with us! I will have to always have a batch of these on hand for when unexpected guests arrive!

I just made these biscotti and I'm a little disappointed in the way they came out. When I took them out of the oven after 25 minutes they were very hard to cut and the slices are very jagged. I tried to put them back into the oven for the next 15 minute drying time and they are not that easy to hold their shape. Also way too sweet. Sorry.

Really tasty and not difficult at all. My only change was leaving out the cinnamon and adding some lemon zest. I liked that these were crunchy but not hard.

I absolutely love these cookies!!  I used to get them all the time at Bleecker St Pastry in Greenwich Village, but since I moved, and they closed, I've longed for them for quite some time.  The ones I've bought in other bakeries never measured up, so on a whim, I tried this recipe.  They are just like the ones I used to get, chewy and nutty!  I even messed up the recipe by incorporating the finely ground almonds into the dough instead of sprinkling on top and adding an extra egg as a result, and they were still delicious. Yes, the dough IS sticky, but the effort is well worth it.   These made my Christmas, and my husband's too :)

I have been making these biscotti since this recipe was first published on page 108 of the November 1987 issue of Gourmet Magazine!  They are absolutely fantastic, but be careful you can easily chip a tooth on one of these!
