This is the best recipe for pork chops I've found!  The chops stay flavorful and tender, and I like the fact that there are no cream soups involved.  I served it with sides of buttered pasta and Italian-style vegetables, and we licked the platter clean.  As a matter of personal preference, I used more garlic, and added one chopped bell pepper to the onion and mushroom mix and it came out very well.  I also did not have any tomato sauce, so I used a partially drained 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes and this worked fine, too.  For anyone who does not wish to cook with wine, I substituted beef broth for the wine and it was still quite flavorful.  This is an A+ recipe!  Thanks for sharing it, Allana!

Easy and great tasting. Makes a little too much sauce, and was sorry to have to drain most of it.

This recipe is great! I've made this dish twice now and I've made a few variations- I used a can of diced tomatos instead of the tomato sauce and added roasted red peppers.  Wonderful and delicious.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

TASTY!  Sunday night is pasta night in our house and this recipe will become part of the rotation. After reading the reviews, I made only three small tweaks.  1) Sauteed a 1/2 pint of cherry tomatoes with the sausage/mushroom mixture   2) Used spaghetti sauce in place of tomato sauce/wine. (I needed sauce for the pasta) and finally . . . 3) saved some clean-up by using an oven-proof pan to brown, saute and  bake all in the same pan (captured all the great pan juices that way as well).   THANKS ALLANA!

Increase cooking time by 30 - 40 minutes to get the 1" pork chops exceptionally tender.

This was one of, if not, THE BEST recipe  I have ever made!!!  I read almost all of the reviews and due to other reviewers I substituted one can of Hunt's diced tomatoes with roasted garlic, drained some of the juice, with a can of tomato paste mixed into it (instead of the tomato sauce).  I used a Pinot Noir wine.   I cooked for 1 hour and 15 mintues at 350 degrees, they were fork tender!  Other reviewers had said theirs were tough so I would cook them as I have described, #1 recipe ever!  To think I only made these because I had 2 leftover mild Italian sausage links I didn't know what to do with!  Served with white minute rice.

I thought the recipe had good flavor.  I was hoping for more of a sauce though.  I would add only a LITTLE wine and more tomato sauce.  I would make a it again.

This was very good but didn't make it as a 5 star for me.  My husband and daughter loved.  The sauce did come out a little runny but was still very good.  My mother always taught me that the secret of good cooking is thoroughly browning your meat.  Be sure to do that with this one...make very brown.  This will add a lot of flavor.  I also tenderized the meat with Adolphs, and it came out very tender.  I used bone in chops, very thick.  I had a little extra time to cook, so baked for 1 hour 15 minutes in 350 degree oven.  And, they came out very moist and tender.  Served over angel hair as suggested with side of broccoli.  Very nice.

We loved this - I made it for the two of us and I can't wait to serve this to company.  It is so easy and different.  We used hot sausage, but that is just a preferance.  I was in a real cooking mood and I made it with two other recipes off this site that I had never tried and I give them both 5 stars too.  What a
 meal.  I made it with Cajun Style Baked Sweet Potao
 and Awesome and Easy Creamy Corn Casserole.  
They all cooked at the same oven temperature and 
they were all done in the same amount of time (45 
min.)  Prep time for all three dishes was very quick 
(probably 40 mins. tops).  Both the sweet potatoes 
and pork chops can be prepared earlier in the day.  
Just pop eveything in the oven at once.

This was very flavorful, but being a two-meat entree, I could almost feel my arteries hardening! A little goes a long way-- it was very filling. I served it with pasta. I wish the sauce had been thicker, but the greasiness of it helped it to cling to the pasta. I would make this again, only with turkey sausage, and pat it with paper towels after draining it for extra grease control.

I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used Spagh sauce and left out the Italian seasoning.  It was EXCELLENT!!!!!
2nd time: Used tomato sauce w/ a pinch of margoram and basil.  added green peppers and onion to the mix. Very good!
Cooked on the stove.
I've also made this with boneless chicken breast instead of pork and it was also very good!

(Red or yellow peppers would make it sweeter.)

Not our favorite.   We expected it to be amazing because of the ingredients but the pork chops did not really hold the taste.  The sauce was very tasty....maybe I'll try it with chicken.

This was awesome!  I cooked two center cut pork chops and used the same amount of other ingredients.  The sauce tastes alot like a cacciatore sauce.  I agree with a previous reviewer that it would be great with chicken.

This is one of my favorites so far! I even prepared it the day before and then baked it the next night and it turned out great. I served it over spaghetti. Next time, I might try to double the sausage, mushrooms, and onion and then add a can of chopped tomatoes so that there will be more sauce to put over the pasta.  Thanks so much Allana!

A keeper in our house! Followed the recipe pretty much as is. I didn't measure the wine or Italian seasoning but probably used pretty close to the amounts listed in the recipe. Pork Chops were fork tender. Can't wait to make this again!

This was a hit with my husband! I enjoyed it as well; however, I think I cooked the pork chops too long when I browned them in Step 1 (operator error, of course!). The meal is very filling and hearty...and so savory!

The sauce was great, but the pork chops didn't have any special flavor.  I will make this again with chicken instead of pork.  I expect the chicken will soak up some of the flavors from the sauce.

The italian sausage stuffing makes for a nice sweet succulent pork chop. This was very good. Served with parmesan rice.

We really enjoyed this, I used thin pork chops so cut down on the frying time. Otherwise stuck to the recipe exactly. This made a very pleasant change. Many Thanks.

My husband loves this dish.  It's pretty forgiving too.  I double the recipe and use a full pound of HOT Italian sausage.  I also add in chopped green bell pepper.

Sometimes I don't have tomato sauce so I'll use spaghetti sauce and the recipe still turns out great, if not even better.

I've even made my own spaghetti sauce and that was my husband's ultimate favorite way to eat this.

Omit the red wine, tomato sauce and Italian seasoning.  Instead in a big bowl combine - one big can or two small cans of tomato sauce and one big fat can of whole tomatoes (crush them), 2 tablespoons paprika, 1-1/2 tablespoons garlic powder, 1 tablespoon oregano and salt and pepper the sauce to taste.

YUMMY!

Mmmmmmm!  Very, very good! We loved it.  I used hot italian sausage.  I was out of tomato sauce, so I substituted a can of diced tomatoes with a 1/2 can of tomato paste.  I added another clove of garlic, and red/green pepper strips.  Served over rice.  Delicious, easy, tender and different than most pork chop recipes.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Made this as written and both the husband and picky son enjoyed it. I will be putting this into the rotation for sure! Thanks! We did make spaghetti noodles to use the excess sauce.

My family thought this recipe was the bomb!  I didn't have thick cut chops, so I used what I had, which was twice as many thin cut, and it worked just fine.  I don't eat meat so I can't attest to it personally, but based on the family responses I give it 4 stars and will make it again.

I made this recipe as written.  For me, the thick cut pork chops with the italian sausage made the meal too heavy in meat.  The sauce was rich and delicious.  Next time, I will use thin chops.  I made the Apple Apricot Compote for our side dish. A French Bordeaux was our choice of beverage.

This recipe had a great flavor!  I used spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce.  Maybe it is just me, but I didn't think the pork chops came out very tender.  I might try this recipe in the crock pot sometime.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  Not so sure about my kids but they are reallly picky eaters.  Based on other reviews, I did add some tomato paste which seemed to thicken up the sauce.  I did not have any problems with it being too runny.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!!

I thought this recipes was great and also wish the sauce was a little thicker. Maybe next time I'll mix some tomato paste in too? 
I took the leftover sausage,mushrooms and sauce and poured it over some wholewheat pasta for lunch the next day - AMAZING!

This was very good.  However, both my husband and I thought it was too salty.  Next time will omit the salt in the recipe.  I used hot sausage and regular sausage.  Served this dish with angel hair pasta.  It was definitely flavorful. I did make sure the thick chops were well browned as suggested by l of the others ratings. Will make this again for sure. Also, baked this for 1 1/2 hrs.

I have been making this recipe for a few years and it's one of my favorites! I like more sauce for mine though, so I double the tomato sauce and red wine, as well as using a full pound of sausage. This is excellent served with brown rice!

A fantastic recipe!  The only change I made was to add diced tomatoes, omit the onions (didn't have any) and I used pork loin.  The sausage was a wonderful compliment  to the dish, will definitely be making again.

this is a family favorite at my house. my husbands all time fav!! The pork chops get very tender if you cook them well when browning them.  The sauce is a little thin but very flavorful.  I like to double the mushrooms and sausage.

The pork chops ended up being a little dry when I made them. I'd definitely try again though. The end product for me that made it worth while was the sauce. I ended up cutting up the porkchops and mixing it in with the sauce. I boiled some noodles and had a very tasty zinged up spaghetti. So in actuality, the ingredients together was superb. It was the hard chunk of pork that put me off. Once I added it into the sauce, it was perfect!

We LOVED this one!  Involves a bit of prep, but sooo worth it.  I used half-inch boneless chops, cutting the baking time to 30min.  The delicious sauce is great over pasta (I used penne tossed with olive oil and garlic powder).

I used a leftover chop, dried mushrooms (porcini), I diced the onion, and used stewed tomatoes, w/italian seasoning and simmered all on stove and served over rice.  Delicious! (I cooked this for one)

I think I've found my favorite way to prepare pork chops! This is delicious, and simple. Only changes I made was to double the amount of italian sausage ( I used spicy ), and I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, that way, it was a nice chucky thick mixture on top of your chops.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  The sauce was very runny and the seasonings were very mild.  I expected a more robust flavor from the tomato sauce & seasonings.  I did add green pepper and red wine, but the recipe still lacks something. I may try again and add more seasonings and something to thicken juices a little.

My husband loved this meal and we'll be putting it into the regular rotation. My modifications: I used sliced pork loin instead of chops, hot italian sausage instead of sweet, and nixed the tomtato sauce and italian seasonings in favor of partially-drained italian flavored diced tomatoes. The tomatoes really added to the dish, I think. Oh, also used red onions where I would normally use white, and it came out fine.

I had to make pork chops for someone who loves meat, so I tried this. The guys loved it! I used rice, but would probably use noodles next time because of the sauce. It was very tasty and I will make it again. It's definitely a meat lovers meal.

The tomato sauce seemed to overpower all other flavors. If I was to try this again, I would use canned tomatos instead and maybe add some green pepper.

A twist on ordinary porkchops.  My family really liked it, and it wasn't too hard to cook.

This really was a nice change to the pork chop. I did use marinara sauce instead, with additional garlic, and it was over the top in flavor by the end. I seared and baked only two thick boneless cuts, and omitted the mushroom simply bc it wasn't on hand. Served over penne that was preseasoned with parmesan. I will do this dish again on the occasions we have pork chops.

Made this tonight and it was amazing!  I doubled the "sauce" stuff and served over Spaghetti Squash for a hearty, flavorful one-dish winter meal.  After two bites, my husband said, "THIS IS A KEEPER!"  Oh and it pretty low carb too!

I don't understand the hype. I put it over pasta and actually preferred the pasta. I think the pork was bland and dry (and I took it out of the oven 15 min early). I added a little more sausage and wine than called for. I wouldn't make it again but i liked the sauce it made, just not with pork.

I used diced tomatoes rather than tomato sauce and doubled most of the spices. I served it over rotini with a healthy dose of fresh grated aprmesan on top. Both my fiancé and my parents loved it.

This is a great recipe for the "Meat Lovers" in your family.  I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results.  I would serve this to company but it also makes a hearty family dinner as well.

This was disappointing for me. The chops were a little tough and not too flavorful; I liked the sausage with sauce though, which I put over egg noodles. I won't make this again. It sounded better on paper then it actually was.

Yummy! The only thing that I did different was add some homemade bolognese(spaghetti meat sauce) that was in my freezer and 1/2 can of diced tomatoes and a little more wine instead of the tomatoe sauce because I did not have any. Wow it was spectacular!!!

Very good.  My guests gave it a thumb's up.  I added olives, red peppers, and used both extra garlic and hot Italian sausage as others suggested.  I also made spaghetti to go with it.

I thought this one was just ok.  My sauce came out way too runny and there are other chop recipes that I like much more.  Sorry, but I probably wouldn't make this one again.  Thanks, though!

These were okay, but not great...very fattening, too.  I will probably not make these again because the sausage was overpowering the pork chops.

This is fantastic!  I served it atop  whole wheat spaghetti and it got rave reviews!  This is another one that my husband brings to work for lunch the next day and has several interested parties at his lunch table.  He brought some in the next time for everyone to try.  They think we are gormet cooks now!

This was very good.  I just wish I could find a recipe where the pork chops come out very moist...not that these were dry; they just weren't fall off the bone moist.  A very nice combination of flavors for Italian marinara style pork chops.

Not bad, but not amazing either.  I hesitated to rate it because I hate to be the first to give it three stars, but taste can be subjective so this is just my opinion.  I felt it lacked a real robust taste.  It was definitely filling, and the pork chops did turn out tender, but the wine made it a bit runny, and I just didn't think this dish was worth raving about. I served it to my husband and we also had compay that day, and while there was very little leftover, I don't think this was a complete hit. 
I did follow the recipe, so I am attributing it to a different taste.

We will definitely make this again in our house!  It had a very good flavor and was certainly better than other pork chop recipes that we have tried.  I may try using tomato paste, instead of sauce, next time to cut down on the amount of liquid that cooks out...I also thought about removing the foil and cooking it 15 minutes longer.

This was wonderful!  I did double the sauce because I have a gravy loving family, and we served this seasoned potatoes, since I do not have pasta lovers.  But the sausage and the chicken was yummy, and the seasoning was great just as it was listed.  Can't wait to make this again

I used spicy Italian Sausage and it was a big hit, we like hot stuff.  Next time I may not use the whole can of Tomato sauce, and put it aside to use if wanted. It was too tomatoey (-my word) for my family

This was "okay". My family didn't rave about it. I had to use a good white wine b/c I didn't have any red.  There was too much juice in the pan when it was done cooking, and the chops seemed a little tough. I bought fresh chops, so this surprised me. I probably won't make this again.

This was amazing, my fiance love it too.  I did make a few changes to it, i added geen peppers, and diced tomatoes instead of suace, and i used spicey sausage ( which was a good idea).  I had to omit the wine because i didn't have any, but it din't matter.  It was excellent and even tasrier the next day.  Thanks Allana, this is a keeper!!
