Let me start by saying we are not a vegan family, in fact, we are not even vegetarian.  I decided to try this recipe to pull my husband onto a healthier track and WOW! this is fantastic.  The prep took a very long time and I couldn't find miso paste.  I added garlic salt to the mashed potato mixture and it was great.  I can't say enough about this recipe.  The BBQ sauce adds just the right flavor.  I will have to remember how long this recipe takes to prepare, but beyond that, I will definitely be making it again.

This is not as complecated as it seems! Read it through, it's very well written> My family really loved this. One reviewer complained about the potatoes- they're just mashed potatoes with 1 T. miso added. If you don't like miso, don't use it! I did use soymilk instead of water. I also used Better than Boullion no chicken base for where it called for gravy, or boullion, and left out bbq sauce (my preference). You could use all kinds of different veggies. I used a frozen mix of peas, carrots and corn, chopped spinach, onion, and peppers.

My family toughed out the eating of this creation, but we did not care for it...
We're vegetarians and are accostumed to eating some fairly dicey recipes, but the onions in the potatoes made the topping turn out like mush, it was bad.
The filling on the bottom was fairly tasty, but the whole thing was ruined by the potatoes on the top...We made it through with plenty of hot sauce...

A great recipe!  I substituted some miso mixed with soy sauce for the hickory BBQ sauce and served it up with rice and steamed green beans.  It was a hit!

This could be called a Vegans' Shepherds Pie in a sense if that helps with the visualization.  This casserole is DELICIOUS!  That being said, not sure if I'd tackle it again.  It took me 1 hr. to prep, and I don't agree with one of the reviews that states it's easy to follow.  I consider myself an intermediate cook but this one made me feel like a beginner!

I like to prep ahead of time for longer recipes, and this one you cannot really prep ahead for.

I left the skins on the potatoes.  They're so good for you and it really made no difference in the end, other than you're getting the nutrients (which is ALWAYS a benefit)!

I was confused as to what to do with the ingredients used with boiling the potatoes.  I did not include them in the mashing.  Next time (if there is one), I will put the garlic, parsley, peppercorns, and bay leaf in a tied cheese cloth and will finely chop (rely on your food processor for this recipe and it will go much faster) the celery, onions, and garlic and will include them in the potato topping for added flavor and reduced wasting.

I did not use BBQ sauce but took another reviewer's suggestion and mixed about 2 tbsp. Miso and Tamari each for a substitute.  Very flavorful.

Also, I too did use "chicken gravy flavored mix" but made my own "gravy" from the suggested whole wheat pastry flour, nutritional yeast, and vegetable stock added to thin it to a gravy consistency; I don't think it was missing anything.

This was tasty but so many ingredients and steps I just don't know if it was worth the effort. Also,  I added the minimum amount of potato water to the potatoes and the casserole still came out very wet and mushy? Maybe if I made it again I would leave out the water entirely.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  The prep took a fair amount of time, but the result was worth it.  I didn't have miso paste so I omitted it, which seemed to be fine.  I am not a vegetarian, but I have been looking for some plant-based meals to add to my diet, and this one was wonderful.  It was hearty and satisfying, with a great texture and flavor, and I did not miss the meat one bit!

In my opionion... It is very very good although I found it to be somewhat time consuming to make. Probably because it was my 1st time. Mine came out somewhat wet and i don't think i used more than a cup of the reserved potatoe water, I think it would have been good without adding any more to it. And to top it off my finicky husband really enjoyed it. So its a keeper. Thank You for posting this...

This recipe tastes ok, but I pureed the potatoes (added 1 sweet potato for nutrition) in the food processor and they turned out gluey and gloppy. So next time, I would hand mash the potatoes, leaving the skins on, which is where the nutrition is.  Also, the recipe is not clear about what you do with all the vegetables that are cooked with the potatoes, so I threw them in, and it's a good thing I did, cuz the potatoes needed the flavor.

  My husband, who is a confirmed meat eater, enjoyed the flavor, but missed the substance of the meat.  I think next time I might be inclined to add kidney beans to make it chewier.

I didn't have mushrooms in the house today, so I replaced them with cauliflower! It was very yummy, but I have to try it with mushrooms as well. Also I have added diced pepper to the filling and extra garlic. I added some thyme to the gravy and dehydrated onion. All came together very nicely. I am a vegan and this recipe is a keeper.

Delicious!! I’d suggest, make the mix with extra gravy and you don’t need any for the top. I also made my own gravy mix. I subbed Tofu with Cauliflower and was very happy (not a fan of tofu). Lots of work but worth in when it’s done!!

I made this a while ago, and thought it didn't have enough seasoning while I was making it, so I put in more than the recipe called for and it was still bland-ish. I still enjoyed it though. Next time I make it I'm going to switch it up and make something new out of this. And add more seasoning.

It wasn't bad. I think the potatoes really sapped some of the flavor away. If I make again, I think i I would use maybe half the amount of potatoes and maybe figuring out some different vegetable to add to the "filling". Everyone liked the gravy, and I think the recipe is a very good starting point to make some changes to.

Really good. I disagree with most of the other users, even though there were a lot of steps I didn't find this was difficult to make. I found it didn't need the gravy on top though, made it too salty.
