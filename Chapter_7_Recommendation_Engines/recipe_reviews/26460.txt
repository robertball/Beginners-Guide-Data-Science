In a word, WONDERLICIOUS!  I knocked this recipe out of the park on my first try.  Here's what I did (and what you should do too): in melted butter, sauté 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 cup chopped onion, 1 cup chopped celery, and 1 cup sliced carrots.  Meanwhile, chop 1/2 pound uncooked boneless, skinless chicken breast into bite-size pieces. Add chicken, the broth, basil, oregano, salt, garlic pepper, a dash or two of poultry seasoning, and a pinch or two of dried thyme to the pot of veggies. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, cook 3 cups egg noodles according to package directions in a separate pot.  Add drained noodles to chicken and veggies, simmer an additional 10 minutes. Only if you want some creaminess, go ahead and add a half can of condensed cream of whatever soup (whatever flavor you choose).  Voilà! A SIX-star chicken noodle soup!

Vincenza...I could kiss you for this recipe.  My 15 month old and I had a bad flu and she refused to eat any soup from the can.  I was ill and at my wits end and found this recipe.  I had all ingredients in the house (except for celery) and whipped this together.  I didn't have the vegetable broth and had to improvise with some chicken broth granules to make all the necessary broth.  I cubed raw chicken and boiled it in the soup to save time.  I also added garlic.  I made egg noodles on the side and added it as we ate it so the soup wouldn't get starchy.  This soup was not only easy but AMAZING!  Probably the best chicken soup I've eaten.  UPDATE:  I'm still eating this on a regular weekly basis.  I make a batch almost weekly and it freezes excellent (if you don't add pasta to it until you're ready to serve).  I now ALWAYS use vegetable broth as I really feel it adds to the flavor.  I sautee the celery, onions and carrots along with garlic to soften them up.  I also buy a rotisserie chicken and use the whole thing to make a huge batch of this soup.  I triple all veggies and my 20 month old daughter eats the veggies out of the soup by the handful!  This freezes REALLY well if you don't add pasta until you're ready to serve.  This is a definite keeper and is still the best homemade chicken soup I've had.

GREAT recipe! A few changes I made are...I sauteed the carrots along with the onion (they end up more tender), I didn't use any veg broth but all homemade chicken broth (it's richer), I added minced garlic along with the othe veggies that cook in the butter, and I doubled the noodles (this made it more a chicken & noodles dish but it was delish!).  This is a great way to usue a rotisserie (sp?) chicken on the second day.  I really really recommend this recipe! I also freezes well!

This is so easy to make and so good!  I cook the chicken breasts in the broth to make the broth a bit richer, then build the soup from there.

I used all chicken broth (part homemade & part store bought broth in the box)  Used fresh basil and fresh oregano from my garden and threw in some dried herbes de provence(an incredibly versatile herb mixture)Sauteed the sliced carrots with the onion and celery.  Made the recipe for 8 and that made generous servings for 6 people. Everyone had 2 bowls.  Delicious. Served with big green salad, rolls, fresh fruit and brownies for dessert.

I followed the recipe only adding 6 cloves of minced garlic. I used homemade chicken broth/vegetable broth and I used the "No Yolks" egg noodles. After tasting it, I did increase the basil and oregano. This was quick to make and quite comforting for someone who's been sick for what seems like ages. Next time, I'll increase both the onion and celery as I like a chunkier soup.

My friend told me last week that I needed to check out this web site.  So I did and join the same day.  Today my daughter was sick when she got up.  I got on the web site to find a chicken soup recipe and found a lot of them.  This one is so easy to fix and that's what I was looking for.  My daughter is not a good eater and when your sick your really don't feel like eating.  She has  had 2 bowls now.  My husband and I also loved it.  I did put 1 cup of celery, onion, and carrots.  It was so rich and hearty.  Thank you for this submitting this recipe.

This was the first homemade chicken noodle soup I ever made. It is VERY GOOD! I was expecting something different than the way it turned out, but it is delicious all the same. I did nearly doubly the noodles and I doubled the veggies. The only problem I had was that the noodles lost their spiral shape when the soup was done--they cooked too long. I may cook them separately next time. 

I have to say...while I am sure there are better recipes out there somewhere, this one is quick, cheap, and easy! And as another reviewer said, it makes me not want to buy another canned chicken noodles soup again. And I don't think that I will unless I have to! I really like this! Good and flavorful!

Excellent chicken noodle soup recipe.  Very easy and has a homemade taste.  I did not cook the chicken first.  I simmered it in the broth with the vegetables for more flavor.  Used frozen egg noodles and added garlic.  Also added two cans of condensed cream of chicken soup for a creamier soup.  I would recommend tasting it before adding salt, it may not be necessary to add salt if not using low sodium chicken broth.

This is what I did that someone else said to do and it was the BEST!!!!!!

in melted butter, sauté 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 cup chopped onion, 1 cup chopped celery, and 1 cup sliced carrots. Meanwhile, chop 1/2 pound uncooked boneless, skinless chicken breast into bite-size pieces. Add chicken, the broth, basil, oregano, salt, garlic pepper, a dash or two of poultry seasoning, and a pinch or two of dried thyme to the pot of veggies. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cook 3 cups egg noodles according to package directions in a separate pot. Add drained noodles to chicken and veggies, simmer an additional 10 minutes.

Everyone loved it.  Kids too!!!  I didn't have any vegetable broth so I used only chicken broth and added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  I used acini de pepe instead of egg noodles.  Everyone thought it was from scratch.  This is my new favorite.  Thanks!!!!!!

Love the recipe with my tweaks! I've made this quite a few times now - usually in the slow cooker. I skip sauteing the veggies ahead of time and just dump everything in the slow cooker. I use 2 boxes of the 32 ounce chicken  broth and omit the vegetable broth. I add the spices already included in the recipe and include a dash of cayenne and a liberal sprinkling of parmesan cheese. I then throw in 2 frozen chicken breasts - some may want to add 3, but 2 is fine for my family of four. I let cook on high for about 4 hours. After the 4 hours most of the chicken has already fallen apart into pieces, what ever hasn't can easily be torn apart/separated in the slow cooker before serving.

Not bad but definitely needed more spices. I also preferred this soup the next day reheated when all of the ingredients had marinated a little longer.

This is so easy, and I've made some changes to make it even easier.  Saute the carrots along with the onions and celery.  After adding and heating the broths, add raw cubed chicken breast pieces and simmer for 20-30 minutes.  Ten minutes before you are ready to serve, add egg noodles.  Simmer for 5 minutes and then turn off the heat.  Let the soup sit for five minutes more.  Only one pot to wash!

This recipe is good, except that the already cooked chicken breast will be dry and mealy by the time you cook it another 20 minutes.  Consider using whole boneless skinless thighs, cook in the broth for 20 minutes, remove, chop, return, and cook perhaps 5 minutes longer.

This has become one of my favorite chicken soup recipes--easy, hearty, and flavorful. I increased the veggies to 1 cup onion, 1 cup celery, and 2 cups carrots. Also, I like the richness that broth takes on when I use uncooked chicken, so I added four boneless, skinless thighs and simmered them with the vegetables for 20 minutes, removed them to cool, shredded the meat, and returned it to the pot. Instead of noodles I used elbow macaroni, since that's all I had on hand, but I didn't want it to soak up the broth so I boiled it separately and added it to the soup along with the shredded chicken. Yummy, yummy with a big salad and sliced French bread. Thanks for a great recipe!

I've been making this for years. I also put ground thyme and ground rosemary to sweeten it. I don't precook the onion and celery. I cook them with the chicken and carrots. The chicken is already chppped and don't take that long to cook. They don't get soft and mushy. They have a lil firmness.  To thicken the broth a lil I use 1/4 cup of corn starch and 1/4 cup of water. Stir that before adding to broth then when broth is boiling add it. I throw in the noodles 10 minutes before it's done.

Excellent, especially with the tricks I used that made this a 1-pot meal!  I used 1 onion, 3-4 celery ribs, and 4 medium carrots for the veggies, diced them sauteed them all together until the onions were translucent, then added 2 Tbl minced garlic and sauteed a minute or two more.  Meanwhile, I cut raw chicken into bite-sized pieces, then threw it in the pot with the veggies.  Added 5 cans low sodium chicken broth, basil, oregano, pepper, and poultry seasoning, and simmered for about 15 minutes.  Then added in about 2 c egg noodles and simmered for another 8 minutes.  Mixed 2 Tbl. cornstarch with 1/4 c. water, and poured that in, and simmered another 1-2 min, until slightly thickened.  Removed from heat and swirled in 1/2 c. fat free half-and-half.  Delicious, thick, creamy, satisfying, and only one pot to clean!

This was my first try at chicken noodle soup and it was so good.  Figured with it being 16 degrees outside and having a killer sore throat, this was the perfect thing to make.  I didn't measure exactly.  I used double the amount of veggies.  Diced up uncooked chicken and cooked along with all veggies including carrots with some garlic and s&p.  Used a 48 oz box of chicken broth and a 32 oz box of veggie broth and added 1/2 tsp dried thyme.  I also cooked my noodles separately.  So easy, so good, and really hit the spot.  Thanks so much!

BRAVO! This recipe is exactly what it claims to be... Quick and easy! The word fabulous should also appear in this title! I added the carrots in the skillet with the onions and celery as suggested and it turned out perfectly. I bought a rotisserie chicken and shredded the meat... DELICIOUS!!! Worthy of more than just 5 stars! This one's a keeper!

Made as written I give this a 4 star rating however when adjusted for our tastes this becomes a 5 star rating in our house. I used homemade chicken stock and I added fresh minced garlic when cooking the onions in a bit of olive oil and once cooked down I added my carrots and celery to the onion/garlic and cooked for about 5 minuets. I played around with the seasoning a bit also and added some frozen corn to the soup. I made homemade egg noodles using the "Grandma's Noodles" recipe from this site, added during the last few minuets of cooking. Fantastic! make extra to freeze for an easy sick day meal.

SO good!  Everyone in the house enjoyed it...even my daughter who is very hard to please.  :-)  I put it in the slow cooker and then added the noodles about 1 hour before serving.  Great flavor!  Will for sure make this again.

Made for my husband last night - I, myself, don't care for chicken noodle soup.  He said it was very good.  We're both doing weight watchers - that being said, always struggle with finding out the portion size.  For those who like to know portion size (to get 6 portions out of a batch), it's 1 1/2 cups each.  For 2012  points based on nutritional info - it came out to 4 points per serving & 7 pts for two servings.

This soup is excellent. I didn't have veggie juice so I just substituted more chicken broth. I eliminated the salt because I made the broth with boullion crystals (already more salt than I wanted:). I increased the basil and oregano to 1 tsp. each and added 1 tsp. garlic flakes. Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe! I make it on a regular basis for our family of 6, and love bringing it to families in need of a meal (sick, new baby etc) Everyone is always asking me for the recipe. After a few tries, I did end up increasing all of the veggies to 1 cup each, substituting more chicken broth for the vegetable broth, adding 2 garlic cloves, and a few pinches of thyme and poultry seasoning. I also always double the entire recipe and use a whole rotisserie chicken shredded. To me, the key ingredient is the type of egg noodles that you use. I tried several and then came across Pennsylvania Dutch Kluski Egg Noodles at Walmart. Incredible! My dad tasted the soup and asked me if I made the noodles from scratch because they tasted just like his mom's. Now, they are the only noodles I use for this soup and everyone is happy about that!

As others suggested I was generous w/ the veggies. I also added about 1 c. of frozen corn, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp rosemary, & 1/4 tsp thyme (these are rough- pretty much seasoned to taste). In addition, I had used Swanson broth & thought it needed a little pick me up so addded 2 tsp of chicken boullion powder. Aside from my little tweaks this recipe is a great base to work w/ & make to your liking!!

i sauteed the carrots with the celery and onions, and added garlic cloves. i cut the chicken into 1" cubes, and added them raw after the broths. simmered for about an hour, until all veggies were soft and tender, and chicken was cooked through. i added a dash of cayenne pepper for some zip. cooked the noodles separately, and added them in at the end. VERY good soup, will be my stand by for chicken soup. thanks!

This makes one great chicken noodle soup that is even better the next day!  If you're in a hurry though, beware! The prep time says 10 minutes, but it took me over an hour to prepare the soup!  I boiled the chicken seperately and then chopped it and addedit to the soup, because when whenever I boil chicken, I get a yucky foamy thing going on on top of the liquid. I also added more noodles, but probably didn't need to... the egg noodles expand a lot!

I left the carrots out of this recipe.  Overall, I thought it was too thin.  I thickened it at the end, but still was a little disappointed in the taste.  I also used homemade noodles as opposed to store bought.

I've made this many times now (the recipe card is burned, actually, from getting a little too close to the element once) and it's always amazing! I became a vegetarian a while ago, so now I make it with just veggie broth instead of chicken broth, and minus chicken. It's still totally delicious! I usually add way more herbs than called for, but that's just because I like my flavors to overwhelm me (:

This is the classic homemade chicken noodle soup recipe. The flavor is really rich and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, including using celery. Add the noodle uncooked to the broth and by the time it is done simmering, the noodles are perfect and the vegetables are soft.

This soup was SOO good! It was so flavorful, yet was very simple to make. I followed the advice of some others and sauteed the carrots along with the onions and celery, while adding 2 T. of mixed garlic. I also cooked the egg noodles separately.

I had the breast with skin from a rotisserie chicken.  I sauteed celery onion and carrots in butter with a little olive oil.  Olive oil will help to stop the butter from burning. Added 3 pressed garlic cloves the last minute. added broth. Removed bones and skin from the chicken.  added them with the broth. There's a lot of good flavor in them. Removed them before adding diced up  chicken & added that when I added noodles. Didn't have oregano or basil so I used Italian seasoning and 2 bay leaves.  If you're worried about not getting all the bones out of the soup tie them up in a piece of cheese cloth. It was just great to go to the pantry & the fridge & find everything I needed w/o going shopping!!!!I did simmer this for a little over an hour before adding cut up chicken. House smells like you've been slaving away all day.  09/04/09 I made this soup again  today the same way and it was not has good  It was good but not great. I do believe it was because I made my own broth & I did not use a rotisserie ckn.  A rotisserie ckn has all the extra flavors in it already. Will definitely make it again but with a rotisserie ckn.

It was really good~!!!  I used raw chicken meats and cooked them with vegetables just to make life easier:)  I also added more vegetables and instead of butter, I used extra olive oils to cook the meats and vegetables.  Very good!

FABULOUS!!! I make this recipe all the time and it is a winner. The only thing I do different is to make my own noodles, I love homemade noodles and they are yummy in this soup, and add garlic.  The noodles are simple 1C flour, 1 egg, half an egg shell of milk mix and roll out on a well floured surface (very thin) and cut with a pizza cutter into thin strips add to boiling soup and you're done.

Great idea for a shortcut!  I added a little minced garlic and actually cooked my boneless, skinless chicken in the broth before I added the carrots and noodles.  Downside to this was the broth wasn't nice and clear--my fault.  Thanks for the idea!

Very very good! I used 3 cans of vegetable broth, and 2 cans of low sodium chicken broth. I cut the chicken up and cooked it in the broth for 10 minutes, then added the noddles and cooked for another 10-15 minutes.

Easy and quick! To give you an idea of just how easy, my husband and I tag teamed this and made it when we both had the flu. He did some chopping, I did the sauteeing. Following others' recommendations, I first sauteed raw chicken cut into bite size pieces, in olive oil. When they were cooked on most sides, I added all the veggies (plus a couple cloves of chopped garlic) and sauteed it for about 10 minutes. Added 2 cartons of chicken stock plus 2 cups water. Simmered 20 minutes, added egg noodles (about 4 cups), simmered another 10, ate! It was a tad on the bland side, but that was good since we were sick and needed something that was easy to get down. That's why 4 instead of 5 stars. 5 for ease and quickness for sure!

Fabulous recipe!  It wasn't tons of work, but full of flavor!  I made a few minor changes: Doubled the veggies and noodles (since we are HUGE funs of Campbell's Chunky Chicken Noodle Soup), only had 4 cans of chicken broth on hand and ended up using half a can of beef broth....it was great!!  I really didn't know how it would taste, but it's awesome!  I also used 2 Foster Farms boneless, skinless chicken breasts and sauteed them in some olive oil for a few minutes (the BIG breasts you get from Costco) and tossed them in....the result was great!  It had just enough broth, and was chock full of veggies, chicken, and noodles....will definitely make this again!!!  (Goodbye Campbell's Chunky!!)  Thanks for sharing!

I recently made this again and used rotiserre chicken for its flavor- HUGE improvement. I also sauteed the vegetables with butter and garlic and everything tasted great.  Definitely will be a standard recipe in my family.  The only negative is that egg noodles really lose their firmness after a few days, but I don't think that can be helped unless you use a firmer noodle.

Yum! I've never made a chicken noodle soup this way.  I think I tripled or quadrupled this recipe.  I also added onions and garlic to sautee and used a whole leftover roast chicken for the chicken.  I added too many spices though but it was wonderful, nonetheless.

Was looking around AR.com to find a recipe that didn't have stock from scratch-- who has the time?  So, I finally found this one where I used canned chicken & Veggie Broth and it was perfect!

Followed it to a T except:  I also sauteed the carrots with the onion and celery-- it helped soften them.  I also added lots of garlic & sauteed that, too.  I waited til the onions were translucent and then threw in the broth.  Cooked it over 20 mins (I like my veggies soft, like the canned version) and added a 1 cup of water to compensate for evaporation.  I was worried that it would water down the broth but it didn't at all.  I ran out of chicken broth (used 4 cans instead of 5 total) so that extra cup of water was needed.  Instead of noodles I cooked matzoh balls in a separate pot since I like those better.  Added the balls (already fully cooked) right before serving.  Perfectly delicious! Too Jays matzoh ball soup can eat it's heart out!

As Brown Sugar Girl suggested, I doubled the recipe and sauteed the veggies until tender. I cooked the noodles separately and also added thyme and a 1/2 tsp each of salt and pepper, along with 1 tbsp minced garlic, which I sauteed with the veggies. This is my first try at homemade chicken noodle soup and it's a winner!

This was very good.  I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic before adding the vegetables.  I used a 32 oz box of chicken broth and a 32 oz box of vegetable stock.  I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker and shredded it.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but I still give it five stars because it's so versatile. I used a little more butter and thickened the soup with about 2 tbsp. flour, used an undrained can of sliced carrots (to save time and to replace the veggie broth), and seasoned it with rosemary because that's what I had on hand. I also cubed raw chicken breasts and cooked them directly in the soup. Yum!

The basil & oregano totally overtook the dish. I cooked the noodles separately then added later and it still didn't seem like enough broth. I won't be making this again.

My boyfriend said it was the best chicken noodle soup he had ever had. I used about twice as much chicken and vegetables as noted because we like chunky soup. Also I used fresh garlic, and Italian Seasonings. I recommend adding the carrots immediately with the butter, garlic, onions and celery so that they become tender. Delicious!!! Tastes great as leftovers as well!

EXCELLENT!

Here are a couple of my recommendations:

1) Double the Onion and Celery
2) I use 20oz of Chicken Breast
3) Cook the chicken for 20 minutes IN the broth/veggie mix, don't worry about pre-cooking it.  Once it's cooked, take it out and chopped into bite size pieces.
4) Add the cooked chicken and noodles into the pot and cook for 10 minutes or until noodles are done.

Saves time and tastes great!

Low Sodium Chicken Broth worked great for me...I'd rather slowly add salt and have control over how much goes in.

Enjoy!  I know I did...

I feel terrible only giving this 3 stars after seeing previous reviews. I really wanted this to be good! But I really didn't think this was all that great. I followed the recipe to a T, but it just didn't taste great to me. Maybe I was spoiled with homemade chicken soup, but this just didn't do anything for me, tasted like it was right out of a can. I won't make this again. Sorry!

Other than doubling, using frozen home style egg noodles, and cooking fresh boneless chicken in the broth first, I swear by this recipe for the best chicken noodle soup. I'm asked to make this often (somethimes much more than I care to) but it's great. If trying for the first time,  I hope you agree.

I REALLY LIKED THE FLAVOR OF THIS SOUP. INSTEAD OF USING EGG NOODLES I USED SPAGHETTI NOODLES AND BROKE THEM UP INTO LITTLE PEICES. NEXT TIME I WILL ADD A FEW VEGGIES.

This recipe was a life saver! My 36wk pregnant wifey wasnt feeling well so i decided to make her chicken noodles soup. It was thebomb.com.... Made a slight change to accommodate wife, but still great.
*Didnt add onion
*Chopped frozen precooked chicken breast strips into cubes( its what we had)

It really was quick and easy. 
I used store brand broths and egg noodles

As a novice cook, I chose this recipe largely because it didn't involve boiling a chicken carcass to make my own broth, the way my mom always did. While it's not QUITE as good as the true all-from-scratch soups, it's definitely the next best thing, and so much easier! It beats canned soup by a long shot. 

Bear in mind that this recipe gets much of its flavor from the chicken broth you choose, so make sure to get one you really like. I went with Swanson broth and it came out with a flavor reminiscent of ramen noodles (which I happen to like), but if you're pickier you might want to look for something high-end or make your own.

I've never made chicken noodle soup before but this soup was so easy and turned out so tasty.  I did make a small change and instead of dried Basil and Oregano I put fresh herbs. It made a difference to Flavors.

I made this following the recipe exactly the first time. The second time I left out the vegetable broth, added 6 Cups Chicken Stock, 2 Cups water and 2 Cans of Cream of Chicken soup. Also, I added about 2 cloves of minced garlic to the onion at the beginning and I cooked the chicken in the broth for about twenty minutes before removing it to cut it up and then I added it back in at the end and I added peas at the same time as the noodles. For the seasonings the only additions I made were adding 1 tsp of Parsely and 1 tsp of Poultry seasoning. Both times it was very good, just a bit more personalized the second time around.

Pretty good homemade soup - a bit bland. You can easily add more spicy ingredients. But all in all... a real good soup.

I doubled the veggies and chicken (I had some I needed to use up) and I also tried cooking the chicken with vegetables, as suggested in other reviews, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It is a delicious and very healthy soup, but personally I find it to be a tiny bit bland. I think next time I make it I will use a decent amount of poultry seasoning on the chicken, and also use more minced garlic. It will be perfect for my lunches for the week though!

WOW...I really wasn't expecting much, but this turned out really great...just what I needed since I am sick with a cold.  I didn't have all the ingredients that the recipe called for so I just threw together what I had and hoped for the best.  Sauteed a little onion and garlic in butter.  Added 2 cans chicken broth.  The rest of a box of bow tie pasta, a little oregano, salt and pepper, a few bite size carrots chopped tiny and one chicken breast cut into small pieces that I cooked in olive oil with a little Tony's seasoning.  Simmered. Awesome and Simple!  My daughter loved it too!

DELICIOUS! This soup was simply amazing! Very simple and quick but it has so much flavor you would never guess it was so simple. The only thing I did differently was I used a rotisserie chicken, tore up to make it even easier. Also, I added one 24 oz. bag of the Reames brand homestyle egg noodles you find in the freezer section at the store. Hope this helped and I highly recommend this recipe!

I thought it was sort of bland. I used homemade turkey broth. I think this requires a lot of seasoning to taste, which is not easy to do!

I added 1 cup half and half, 1/2 c dry white wine, 2 sprig dill and a couple of dashes of pepper flake.  It is super good!!  Makes it a little creamy.

Extremely quick and easy.  I doubled the recipe and substituted dried thyme and rosemary leaves for the basil and oregano because that is how I like my chicken soup.  Thanks for a great timer saver.

I have to start off by saying that I am not a fan of chicken noodle soup, but my boyfriend on the other hand LOVES it. So when he was sick a few weeks ago I thought I'd be the loving girlfriend and make him chicken noodle soup that's not from a can. This recipe was so easy and delicious that even I had some. I made this soup again last night since the bf has been begging me to make this again. This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will continue making this for a long time! Thanks for the great recipe Maryvm!

Use this recipe by added 2 cloves of garlic and sauted with onion an celery.  Used 2 quarts of chicken broth only.  Used a rotisserie chicken from the store.  

My husband was sick and I said I would make him some chicken noodle soup.  This was the easiest and quickest recipe I could find.  Turned out great!

My family loves chicken soup,but it is usually made in a large pot from scratch and takes about 3 hours.It is delecious.However my wife was out and my kids had colds and I didnt have time to cook soup for 3 hours.I tried this recipie and my kids absolutely loved loved loved it.It was quick easy and tasted great.Soup from scratch is a little richer tasting but this was a huge hit.My mom could not believe it took less than 40 minutes to cook.She has made chicken soup from scratch for years and she asked for the recipie so she can make a quick chicken soup.Only complaint is that if your making it for alot of people buying all that broth can get a little pricy,otherwise it was great.Kids asked me to make it twice already in the last 3 weeks.great and quick chicken noodle soup.5 stars.

This recipe was a wonderful find! My son didn't like any of the canned soups I tried, and I hardly ever have time to make it completely from scratch. Both kids and my wife love this recipe! I've found I like it better with all chicken broth. I don't often have leftover chicken, so I just cook up some boneless chicken breasts (or sometimes boneless thighs) in butter and garlic, along with some fresh, chopped baby carrots instead of onions. (My kids don't like onions, though I snuck in some finely chopped ones once and they didn't complain much) The family prefers it with the egg noodles cooked in, as they like it to thicken. I sometimes throw in some frozen peas towards the end, for extra veggies. I really appreciate this recipe, and how it's flexible and tasty and fast!

Quick, easy, and it tastes just like when I make it from scratch -- but it takes 1/4 of the time!  I usually add some dried sage and parsley and double the butter.  Save some for lunch because it tastes even better the next day.

i had some left over roasted chicken to use up. i added some broccoli florets in place of the celery & cooked the pasta separately. for the amount of time/effort spent this was a very satisfying meal!

Great Soup! Added a couple bay leaves, but everything else was left as the recipe stated. I will definately make again. I always read the reviews to decide if I am going to make something. The reviews were great and helped make my decision to make this soup.

My boyfriend loves this soup - one thing I do differently is to cook the chicken and the veggies together with half the herbs, then add it all to the broth with the rest of the seasoning. This is a big hit!

I've made this several times now, and it's terrific.  The first time I tried it I wasn't in a carrot mood, so I substituted a can of diced tomatoes which tastes great and makes the broth look nice.  It's a flexible recipe, and I'll try it with the carrots sometime.  Also, I double the oregano and basil and add garlic as others suggested.  I omit the saute in butter step and just cook the onions and garlic in the broth.  It still tastes great and is even lower in fat.  A keeper recipe.

I enjoyed this soup.  Definitely not as good as 100% from scratch soup but an acceptable substitute when you don't have time.  I followed the directions to the letter except for I added my chicken breast raw, did not have the problem of the foam on top.  The basil and oregano give it a different flavor, not like traditional chicken soup that I'm used to, I almost left it out but I wanted to give the original recipe a chance, and I'm glad I did as the broth was tasty.  Next time I'm going to add some peas to up the veggies.  Here's a tip: the 900 mL Campbells (or Knorr)chicken broth in a carton is equivalent to 3 cans of soup.  Thanks for the recipe.

I cooked according to the instructions, except that I made the following modifications (most taken from previous comments): (1) I used cooking spray instead of the butter; (2) I used 1 cup of celery instead of 1/2 cup; (3) When I cooked the onions and celery, I also added in the carrots and two cloves of garlice; (4) I kept the noodles separate from the soup mixture until serving; and(5) just prior to serving, I added to the soup mixture: a can of cream of chicken soup and a can of cream of celery soup. It was a great solution to a cold night in Texas. My husband liked it.

Another keeper - I was looking for a way to use up my turkey leftovers from Christmas and was shocked how good it came out. I read the other reviews and added more noodles (3 cups whole wheat),more veggies (including mushrooms), and tried substituting the cans of chicken broth with organic chicken broth, a low sodium one, and a garlic flavored one.  I was surprised that it had so much flavor with so little effort. It really is a great soup - thanks for submitting this.

I have been using this recipe for two years now. If I do not have the fresh carrots, I use frozen sliced carrots or frozen peas & carrots. Tastes great and is so easy to make especially when the cold/flu season hits!

This may be the best chicken noodle soup I have ever had!  I used  one can of cream of chicken soup as others have suggested. You will need to stir this a long time to get it blended.  Also, I used an 11 oz. can of  V-8 because I could not find veg. broth.    I added about a cup of water to cut down the saltiness of the V-8.  I would suggest using small egg noodles.  I used the extra wide kind because that was what I had on hand and they are too big for your spoon. This soup looks and tastes restaurant quality.  Thanks Vincenza!

Delicious!  I took suggestion from previous note and added a can of cream of chicken soup which made it thicker.  I also added more noodles.  I had some red bell pepper on hand, so added it in for some extra flavor -- also made it more colorful and appealing!

I changed the serving size to 6 and added two cans of cream of chicken soup. Gave it a great flavor and a nice creamy base.  Instead of egg noodles I used the small ring pasta which did not soak up any broth at all. I also waited until last minute to add. Everybody loved it and had several bowls.  Outstanding!!!!!

This Quick and Easy Chicken Noodle Soup is so LIP SMACKING DELIGHTFUL that you will wish you were sick everyday so your mom would have to come over and make this to nurse you back to health!   I won’t make this too often because I don’t like all the time it takes to cut the veggies.  Wolfgang really enjoyed it but his comment was “What is this… soup, stew or casserole?”  (I got carried away with the egg noodles and they soaked up all the chicken broth.)    This soup is even better the second day after the spices have saturated the chicken and noodles.  YUM!

Followed some suggestions from others - saute 2 cloves of garlic, saute the carrots with the onions and celery and cook the noodles seperate and mixed it all together at the end.  Fabulous!

My husband said this was the best Chicken Noodle soup he has EVER had!!! I did add a little thyme and fresh garlic as well, and when I sauteed the vegetables I went ahead and added the spices as well to get the flavor to release sooner.Turned out so well!! Can't wait to make it again!

People get mad when other people alter recipes and then rate and review, well I feel differently. I read them because I love all the alterations that people make and generally I tend to take the most frequently used substitutions. I rated this soup only 4 stars because honestly if you made it as is, this soup would be EXTREMELY bland. I love that its quick and easy and a great way to a quick "homemade" chicken noodle soup. I used chicken stock instead of broth and I did use the 1 can of veggie soup. I also added 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom which really brought this soup to life. For the chicken I just brought a whole rottiserie chicken and shredded that in my soup. I cant say I followed the  measurements to a tea, which is why I added so much broth, but overall the concept of this soup is really good.

I always make a new recipe exactly as instructed the first time; then I can tweak it to my tastes. As written, this is pretty good. There are only two things I would change:

1) Cook the carrots with the onion and celery before adding the other ingredients; they weren't totally hard, but they weren't nice and tender, either.

2) The noodles get too mushy if you add them with the broth. Next time, I will let the broth and vegetables cook for a little while and then add the noodles later on.

Otherwise, this was a tasty meal. I served it with a baguette and a fresh salad. Yum!

I make this in Two stages. Sauté celery,carrots and onion with basil, oregano, salt and pepper. Add broths and carrcus of rotisserie chicken  (pull 1/2 breast off and save for sandwiches, use rest for soup). Simmer one hour, strain and start over with fresh veggies. Add noodles you cooked prior. Good stuff Maynard.

This was the best chicken noodle soup ever.  My 5 year old doesn't "eat" carrots.  But he ate them in this dish.  I will be making this again in a week or so.

Followed the ingredients for the most part, but browned chicken in an enamel pot with evoo, cooked the veggies in same pot, then added stock & spices with a can of rotel.  Yummy on a freezing day with a loaf of crusty french bread!

This was a great recipe. I have been sick with a cold for a few days. Nothing has tasted very good. I doubled the veggies and added garlic with the Evoo/veggies. I had cheese tortellini on hand and used that instead of noodles. I will say it was very good. This was a real comfort and Thanks for posting. It was wonderful!!

Love this recipe!! I sauteed minced garlic and diced onions together in butter...then added carrots, celery, and red potatoes. Added a little bit of broth (homemade veggie and turkey from left over thanksgiving turkey bones) and let that simmer for awhile to soften up the potatoes...cooked the chicken in separate pan and then added together with the rest of the broth...seasoned with basil and oregano....cooked spaghetti noodles while this was simmering and added to it when they were done! perfect....fyi about broth- save all your onion, celery, carrot scraps and then when you have a decent amount buy some mushrooms and throw all in pot, cover with water, bring to boil, and simmer for 1-2 hours...strain and done- you have broth. I fill 2 cups at a time in freezer bags and save for whenever I am ready...havent bought broth in a year....can do this while whole chicken carcasses as well

I would like to add my 5 stars to all the other 1000 or so reviewers!!  I pretty much made as written except for using fresh basil, chicken broth I had made from deli-rot. chicken and added no extra salt and pepper (didn't need it).  I also took the suggestion of others and cooked the noodles just before serving.  Took the rest of the soup (minus the noodles) and froze for later. This turned out absolutely delicious!!!!  Thanks for a wonderful basic chicken soup recipe that I would be proud to serve.

This is a great soup and just what I needed to help me get over my cold. It's so easy and so much better than canned soup. I doubled the celery and herbs. I didn't have already-cooked-chicken, so I added the broths and brought it to a boil, then added the raw chicken, noodles and seasonings. The chicken cooked in no time. I used organic 'homemade' noodles purchased at the store to make it taste even more homemade.

I really enjoyed this - of course, I altered it a little.  I added garlic and doubled the vegetables and used fresh basil.  I also added almost a whole can of cream of mushroom soup in the last 10 minutes or so.  I didn't have veg broth so I used all chicken (some homemade, some in the carton). I didn't pre cook the chicken.  I just cubed it and threw it in the pot with everything else and cooked it all together.  Yummy.

Yum! so quick and easy. I sauteed the carrots with the celery and onion, and used about a cup of each.
I also diced raw chicken and cooked it in the soup toward the end, when the noodles were al dente (i brought the soup up to a rolling boil to cook the chicken throughly). No need for salt!
It called for a lot of noodles, so i might only use 1 cup next time.

Loved this recipe as well as Diane Edgecomb's.  I started with my own broth from scratch then tripled veggies, sauteed w/garlic in butter.  Added poultry seasoning and ground thyme.  Excellent recipe!!!

This is one of my family's favorites. I usually either make a whole chicken in the crock pot or buy a pre-cooked chicken at the store. The flavor adds something a little extra. I also like to use the thin "homemade" noodles that can be purchased at our local nursery.

I have made chicken soup from scratch, but I needed something that would help me use my already-cooked chicken.  This was easy and so delicious.  My 16-yr old son doesn't often compliment my cooking, but he did this time!  I followed the recipe with only these exceptions: I was out of oregano so I substituted a 1/4 tsp. more basil and 1/4 tsp. parsley.  I also cooked the egg noodles separately al dente and added them in at the end.  Easy and delicious!

I first made the recipe as written and found it somewhat bland.  That is what the rating is based on.  I added parsley, garlic, more oregano and basil and it helped give it more flavor.  The recipe puts you off to a good start but it needs your own special something added to make it great.  With the changes I made and a few other ideas I have, I'll be making it again.

AMAZING! Super easy. I have made this so many times this winter I think we got burnt out because I kept doubling the recipe each time. But it's amazing everytime! Maybe this is why I have yet to get sick this winter either ;) Thank you for sharing.

I will never need to look for another chicken noodle soup recipe! Fantastic! Additions made: 1. Added 1 can cream of chicken and herbs soup 2. Used homemade noodles (very easy and saves money) 3. Simmered for several hours to thicken Even better the next day.

Very easy and delicious! I have been snowed in for a few days and wanted to make some soup. I followed the recipe for the most part, except I eyeballed most of the ingredients instead of measuring them out. I also used nonstick cooking spray instead of using butter (I don't like cooking with butter). I can't wait to eat all the leftovers! :)

This was delicious! The only ingredient changes I made were to add garlic with the onions and garlic powder to the chicken (we love garlic). I also changed the cooking method of the chicken... I sauteed uncooked chicken with the veggies and then added the broth and noodles from there! This is a keeper - so delicious yet so easy.

So delicious and easy.  I did not use vegetable broth (substituted with more chicken broth) and I sauteed the carrots with the onion and celery.  Hit the spot on a cold night!  Can't wait to make it again.

this was the absolute best chicken noodle soup! Hubby was sick and what's better than chicken noodle soup. I sauted the carrots,celery,onions,and garlic in butter before i added the broth. our store did not have veggie broth so i used 4 cans of chicken broth (not low sodium) and one of the broth cans filled with water and mixed with a chicken bouilloin cube. i also added just a pinch of poultry seasoning, garlic powder and thyme, and added half a can of cream of chicken. The best!!! you cannot go wrong with this recipe. Im actually looking forward to making this again :)

This is great for a quick week night dinner if you use a roaster chicken from the grocery store. I make just as written with the skinny broken egg noodles that cook fast (not the wide ones) and some extra veggies. Even my picky kids like it. They think it tastes better then Campbells "Double Noodle" and that's sayin something!

This is a good start for a chicken noodle soup, but I think it needs more flavor.  I even seasoned the chicken before I browned it.

This soup was exactly what my family needed since 3 out of the 4 of us has a pretty nasty cold. The only thing I did differently was I put in the chicken uncooked, only because I forgot to cook it beforehand. It was a happy mistake because in the end the chicken had a great flavor from cooking in the broths and herbs. I will always use uncooked chicken for now on. I also threw in more noodles then called for. My kids love the noodles and 1 1/2 cups just wouldn't cut it. This was a wonderful recipe and I will start making this more often...even when we're not under the weather.

Just tried this last night and it was very good. I only had two cans of chicken broth and had bone in chicken breast. I took the skin off the chicken and boiled them with salt onions and celery and used that for my broth with my two cans. I also used regular thin spaghetti because I do not like egg noodles.It was very tasty and I brought some with me for lunch and gave some to my mom she said it was delicious. I am freezing some for a cold day.

This is now my favorite recipe! It was so simple to make and soooooo delicious! Thank you so much! The only thing I did differently (per other suggestions) was to cook the noodles separately and add them to the bowl separate from the broth and veggies. That way the noodles don't get soggy! This really is a great recipe!

Yum!  I used homemade chicken stock in place of both canned broths in the original recipe, and also sauteed the carrots along with the celery and onion.  I boiled two chicken breasts in the soup as it was simmering.  It turned out great!

The only changes I made was that I chopped up 1 raw boneless, skinless breast and 2 boneless, skinless thighs instead of using cooked chicken; and, I used whole wheat egg noodles. Otherwise, I followed all of the directions as listed. Turned out perfectly! Next time, I think I'll use only thigh meat, but that's my personal preference. I love how easy it was to toss together homemade soup on a week night!

This was pretty good!!  I didn't have vegetable broth, so I simply added more veggies and herbs to the soup!!  Also, I boiled my chicken breasts - reserved the water from boiling and added 6 cups of water with 6 boullion cubes for flavor!  Cheaper and just as easy!

I didn't think this soup was that great. It seemed to lack flavor and depth--despite the fact that I sauteed the onions (and garlic) and added peas and more carrots. I don't think I will make it again.

This is great basic, comforting, homestyle chicken noodle soup! Only changes I made were to dice the raw chicken breast and cook it in the soup (just threw in at the same time as the broth) and cooked the noodles separately to avoid the starchy water taste in the soup. Used whole wheat egg noodles and tasted great. Spices were perfect. This is now my go-to chicken noodle soup!

I make this frequently and it's delicious every time.  I double the amount of noodles (personal preference) and add a bit of garlic.  Perfection on a cold winter night!

This soup was perfect...just the right amount of flavor. I didn't have any cooked chicken around, so I just boiled 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts in some salted water until they were cooked through, used the meat and the resulting broth in my soup. All in all, I used 9 cups of homemade stock instead of the 5 cans of store-bought. I also used elbow pasta instead of the egg noodles...my family really loved this! I felt it made more than 6 servings...thanks so much for sharing! This is a winner!

Delicious basic recipe!  My boyfriend was amazed at how I was able to make "homemade" soup that quickly.  I used about a cup and a half of rice instead of the noodles.

I made this for my sick husband tonight and he loved it. He said it was the best chicken noodle soup he's ever had. I made a few changes by using a rotisserie chicken (white meat only), using chicken bouillon cubes mixed with water instead of chicken broth, sauteed the carrots with the celery and onion and added about 4 cloves of garlic. I also increased the spices. Fabulous - can't wait to make it again!

This soup was wonderful! My hubby actually said "this is from scratch?!" My children LOVED it...except Jack (he doesn't eat anything I make). I didn't have veggie broth, so I used 4 cans of chix 1 can of cream of celery at the end. I added a handful of peas as well. Made this for my hubby since he has a terrible cold. Followed another reviewers suggested and sauteed the veggies and added 2 cloves minced garlic to those. Very, very good! Will be making again and again! :)

I assumed the high rankings were "for a chicken soup this is good" type of ratings. I was wrong. The soup has a very very good flavor, I guess I've only had some very average chicken soups before because the flavor was so great. The only change I made was to chop up chicken breast into bite sited pieces while it was raw, boil the water, plop the chicken in, boil it for a few minutes, then I added the appropriate amount of chicken & vegetable bouillon cubes. It turne dout great!

This was really quick and delicious. The fastest and best tasting CNS recipe I've come across. I will cut back on the celery to 1/4 c. next time but that's just my preference. This recipe was excellent.

I expected much more from this based upon all the reviews. It was good but we were expecting much more.  Really just average.  I actually thought it took more time to make than stated with the chopping and such.  For our family this was 3 star.

Excellent recipe...  full of flavor and so easy.  It freezes well also, so make a big batch! UPDATE:  I added 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of water in place of about 12 ounces of the chicken broth and it gave the soup great flavor and consistency.  TRY IT!  :)

Instead of canned broth I used strained broth left over from stewing chicken on 2 other recent occasions. This soup was awesome and will be a keeper in my recipe box! After I added the noodles, I also added 1/2 cup frozen corn and 1/2 cup frozen peas, 1 scant teaspoon poultry seasoning, 1 tsp seasoned salt, and 1 tbsp beef base, since I don't use salt when stewing chickens, it needed a little seasoning boost. Thanks for the post! Wonderful!

This is really good soup.  I omitted the vegetable broth and used about 2 cups of extra broad egg noodles and the end result was really yummy, satisfying (not to mention super quick) chicken noodle soup to help comfort my sick hubby (although I did have to add more broth than the recipe called for, in part because of the extra egg noodles I added).  I will most definitely make this soup again, but I will add more vegetables (probably double what the recipe calls for).  I also want to note that I used 3 medium cloves of garlic which I added when sauteeing the onions, celery and carrots.  I also added 1 package of chicken bouillon for added flavour.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very easy recipe. Followed suggestions of others to saute carrots and CELERY and added garlic.  Cooked noodles seperately.  Omitted veggie broth but added seasoning salt and pepper.  Also added 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup.  Very, Very good!

I made this tonight for my husband and my 2 year old daughter who can be a bit picky.  We all loved it!  My daughter ate all her carrots (and she doesn't like carrots)!  I am not a fan of chicken noodle soup and I also really enjoyed this.  I followed the advice of other and sauteed the carrots and some garlic with the other veggies.  I used "Finding Nemo" pasta as it is easier for my 2 year old to eat.  I also used rotisserie chicken from Costco.  As a working mom I will definitely pass this recipe on to my friends and co-workers.  This is so quick and easy for those of us who love to cook but just don't have the time.

I can't believe that I can make chicken soup better than my mom's! I altered the recipe a little bit.  I took 2 raw chicken breasts, cubed them, then sauteed them with 2 cloves of garlic and olive oil.  I also added 1 tsp. of died rosemary to the soup (that was how my mom always made it).  It was fantastic!

What an amazing dinner tonight although I really only used this recipe as a guideline.  I started with Homemade Chicken Broth from this site.  That gave me about 9 cups of broth.  I sauteed my carrots (20 chopped baby carrots) along with my celery (2 stalks chopped) and onion (1/2 medium).  I followed th rest of the recipe but didn't add the pasta (between 1/2 - 3/4 lb rotini) until the simmer.  I needed to add some water since I was using a heavier pasta.  I then added for more flavor about 1 tsp ginger and 1 tsp red pepper flakes.  I added a little parmesan too for family preference.  It was amazing!!  Everyone loved it.  Thank you Vincenza for the starter recipe!!  I'm sure when we don't have homemade broth we will still be using this recipe with store bought.

Wowie zowie!!! This is the best chicken soup recipe ever produced. It's amazing how simple and satisfying this soup is. I've made it a few times now, and it's grown to be a staple. I find that if I prep everything in the morning(including the chicken), and put it together later in the day it turns out better. Other than that, follow this recipe to the tee, and you'll have great results!!!

I loved this soup. I only changed 2 things- 1.) noodles to white rice, just my personal perferance and 2.) instead of cooking the chicken then adding it it, I boiled it with the broth and vegtables. The best way to described the taste: a very happy child hood memory. Absoulutly fantastic. Highly recomend this recipe.

Two words:  L-O-V-E I-T.  Incredibly easy, delicious and simple to make for this uber-simple mom.  Definitely a keeper, even for the picky eaters.  I avoid super-complicated meals that require constant maintenance and long preps because I don't have the kind of rapturous, ravenous audience that appreciates the effort.  Even beginners would find it hard to screw up this recipe.

This is indeed quick and easy. I only had 2 cans of chicken stock so I just used extra water.  Soup still turned out really good.  Also substituted garlic salt for salt and added a pinch of dried parsley.  My husband said it was the best soup he's ever had...big praise considering he once worked in a soup and sandwich shop.

mmmm mmmm good. This soup was fresh tasting. The only thing I did differently was cook the noodles separately  to keep the broth from getting starchy. When the noodles were almost done I added them to the pot of soup. Very refreshing taste.

This was excellent, and even better the next day! I used low sodium, low fat broth for health reasons. It was a little bland; but then I gave just a sprinkle of salt to the top of the pot, and it made all the difference.

This was a good recipe, but I did make a few changes.  I used broth from boiling the chicken, put the onion in with the chicken, added garlic, and cornstarch to thicken the juice.  My bf LOVED it, said it felt good on his scratchy throat.

I loved this recipe!! I made it tonight because my family all have colds.  It was easy, delicious & filing.  I used marjoram instead of oregano and added frozen peas.  It was really good and I will be adding this to my recipe collection!

This is excellent!  I used mushrooms (portabello and shitake) instead of carrots, 1 teaspoon of oregano,1/2 teaspoon of majoram,fresh basil and added a bay leaf. Instead of butter I used olive oil.  It was the best chicken noodle soup I have ever had!  Thank you for the recipe!

I was so suprised at how flavorful this soup was...for being as quick and easy as it is!  The basil and oregano (I'd never thought to use in chicken soup) really added a nice dimension to the flavor.  Next time I'll try the frozen egg noodles for a REAL taste like homemade treat!!  Thanks for sharing!

This was a great recipe.  I added some mushrooms and zucchini, and I used whole wheat pasta.  But it hit the spot and was quick and helped the sore throat that I was having.  I took the leftovers to work, and everyone loved it.  I will definately make it again!

This was truly the easiest/best chicken noodle soup yet.  I made it for my sick DH who ate the whole pot over the weekend- it just kept getting better every day!  I used canned broth (to me, better than stock) and pre-julienned carrots in a bag to make it even faster.  It's a family favorite now!

My boyfriends eyes lit up after the first sip he took of this soup.  He said it was "awesome".
I didn't follow the advice of adding more vegetables, but will next time. 
Because I have a wheat intollerance, I used rice pasta broken up into small pieces.  I also cooked these seperately and added 5 minutes before serving.  
I didn't have 4 cans of chicken stock on hand, so I used 2 cans + a bouillon cube and water.  I wouldn't recommend a whole bouillon cube though, as mine turned out a little saltier than I would have liked.
I used fresh frozen basil, which I prefer to dried.
It took a little longer than the time stated (about an hour as opposed to half hour), however once you get the hang of the recipe, I think it would end up closer to half hour. 
All in all, a fantastic soup recipe.  5 stars!

This is the best soup I or my wife has ever tasted.  My local grocery store didnt carry vegetable broth so I substituted a can of V-8.  We were both skeptical with the V-8 in it but wow amazing flavor this is deffinately a keeper.  Thank you so much.

I just finished making this soup and it turned out pretty good. I omitted the salt and added a chicken bouillon cube cause I felt it needed a stronger chicken flavor. I also added one can of cream of chicken soup. My daughter tried it and really liked it. I precooked my egg noodles then added them to the soup so they wouldn't soak up alot of the juice. I think next time I'll add some peas. With the cold weather already starting it's nice to have a good soup to warm you up!

REMINDER: Good and bad reviews will vary upon ingredients used. I found the following to prove the best results. Simple Organic brand chicken stock at Kroger is good, if you don't already have your own. It smells good when I open the container and that is a big thing to me regarding chicken stock. 
Tips: No.1.The amount of chicken equals about 1 chicken breast, use salt and pepper with the chicken when prepping for the recipe. No.2. The amount of chicken stock is 58 ounces, or 7 and a fourth cups. No. 3 A food processor cuts the time in half, unless you buy the pre-chopped and sliced vegetables in the produce section of the store. Frozen may be acceptable. But as mentioned above, quality ingredients is key, so DO NOT USE canned vegetables in this recipe. Happy Cooking, everyone! :)

I'm a beginner, never cooked much until I had my daughter. I was just using the recipe on the back of the Swanson broth container but decided I wanted to try a different flavor. I use a precooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store& just tear it apart (& typically we snack on it too). I used leeks & omitted onion because I HATE chopping onions (also had carrots& celery). I was a bit nervous so I only used 1/4 teaspoon of the seasonings (I have a 1.5 yr old who just became a picky eater in the last 2 weeks- WTH?!). I also used pastini (little star noodles) because my daughter doesn't like the dumpling egg noodles we get (too big I think, but dad needs certain types of pasta/noodles because of a neurological disorder that makes his hands shake). I didn't sauté anything, just cut it up & cook the  out of it in the broth& seasonings, add chicken towards the end & simmer a bit, then finally the noodles. Made it during nap time for dinner later. 
I don't get all the reviews with suggestions to make it more difficult/complicated, they should just submit their own recipe as P.I.A. Chicken Soup. I also hate the "prep time" it's always way longer for me than what the recipe says (partly for not really knowing what I'm doing & partly because I usually have a screaming toddler hanging on me).

I cooked the chicken beforehand and added everything together to cook on the stove.  the noodles turned into a raw soggy mushy mess and the chicken that was really tender before was tough as nails after 8mins on medium heat I'm

Delicious! A great base to tweak to your liking. I doubled the veggies and sautéed them all together. I didn't have veggie broth so I used all chicken (half was a low sodium broth and half was from bullion). I added ½ tsp of Herbes de Provence along with the basil and oregano. I didn't have egg noodles so I used elbow noodles that I cooked separately and added at the very end. I will definitely make this again, easy and absolutely delicious!

Awesome base recipe! I followed others' advice and added a bunch of chopped garlic (about 6 cloves). I also added double amounts of everything to the broth because I like a heartier soup. And additionally, I threw in some herb de Provence and a bay leaf. It was amazing and super easy. Never, EVER using a can or box again.

This was just delicious!! I did exactly what Brown Sugar Girl said to do in her review and it was amazing! Had the right amount of seasonings. A keeper! The only thing I did different was I used Emerils Organic Chicken broth and I added lemon to my bowl!!I also kept the noodles separate.   so Good! Thank you!

Delicious and Quick! No need to boil chickens ever again. Definitely must use fresh herbs. I couldn't find fresh parsley so I used dried, and it because it was chopped so fine, it turned the soup a bit cloudy. Unless it will all be eaten right away, I recommend cooking the noodles separately and adding to the soup when ready to eat. This will avoid mushy noodles.

I absolutely love this.  The only thing I did that was different was saute the onion and celery in butter.  Then put everything in the crockpot with raw chicken for 6 hours on low.  Then I put in half cooked egg noodles in and cooked for another 15 minutes.  I have 7 kids and 5 of them are teenage boys.  I doubled this recipe and everything was wiped out.  Cheap dinner and o-so-good!!!!

I first made a double recipe for my neighbors who were down w/the flu after Christmas. I did taste it before taking it to them & knew it was good. They raved about how delicious it was...again & again & again! I made a batch for myself 2 nights ago & although I'm having it for lunch & supper, I am tempted to have it for breakfast too. I didn't change a thing in your recipe. And it's so easy!

A few weeks later I find that I make this once each week. Double thank you for the recipe!

Oh my goodness this was sooo good.  Made a double batch for a friend who was sick and gave half to her and half for my own family.  Thought we would have some leftover but it was almost all gone!   I made this as the recipe called, except I did not have oregano, so ended up using 1 tsp basil and then 1 tsp italian seasoning.  I also used a little more chicken than was called for.  I did feel that the noodles could maybe be a tad firmer, so I may try cooking them al dente separately and then adding them at the end, or adding them 5 minutes before the end of cooking time.  Great with a salad and a baguette.

Simple, easy, great flavor - but I used chicken stock instead of chicken broth. Additionally, I used a rotisserie chicken from Sam's Club and threw that meat in and also a couple of bones to simmer in the soup as well. Came out quite nicely.

I am fairly new to cooking and this was the first chicken noodle soup recipe I found! Loved it, so yummy and soothing! I did tweak it a bit. I added a tad more butter, really just a smidge. I also added a clove and a half of minced garlic, half a green bell pepper, and cut baby carrots into small circles. Also, for time purposes I used a whole rotisserie chicken from the store. I sauteed the garlic, pepper, onion AND carrots all together in the butter for about 6-7 minutes. Everything else as the recipe states. Turned out wonderful I can't believe I made it so well for the first time! Very flavorful.

AMAZING soup!!! Even my children(9,13,17) loved it.  I used a rotisserie chicken and chicken stock instead of broth.  I also used 1/2 tsp thyme and 1 tsp parsley like other people suggested.

It's been hard to find a recipe that doesn't taste bland or is too watery. This was fantastic!  It definitely doesn't need more salt, the chicken broth had more than enough.  Followed the recipe to the T.

Fantastic!!! My husband is neither a soup or veggie person but he ate nearly the whole pot! I did make changes. I sauteed the carrots, celery and onions with 2 cloves of garlic. I also did not have any veggie broth so i just used all chicken broth. I added a can of cream of chicken soup to make it a little more creamy. and finally I added a tablespoon of better the bouillon chicken. I was so fabulous next time I will make a double batch to freeze. Thank you so much for the recipe!

This was pretty awesome. It was not hard at all to make and I can easily remember what I put into it. I did more than required but came out with a lot of soup which is frozen and stored for a quick meal.

Made this last night.  Followed suggestions by Brown Sugar Girl.  Increased the veggies to 1C each, added 2 minced garlic cloves, increased the amount of noodles to 3 cups but cooked them separately and added to each bowl when serving.  Added a couple pinches of thyme.  I also cut 2 thighes into bite size pieces and browned a little with the veggies then added the broths & continued witht the recipe.  Saved cooking the chicken in a separate pot and it finished cooking in the broth.  The soup was DELICIOUS.  I will definitely make it again.  Thank you Maryvm for a great & easy soup.

I made this soup exactly as written the first time and it was yummy the first night, but the second day the noodles absorbed all the liquid and I ate yummy chicken casserole. So the second time I made it I made the noodles on the side and just added them as needed. It is quick and even my 7 year old who refuses all soups will eat this with no problems. I also used this recipe for making my own broth the second time: www.eatingwell.com/recipes/easy_chicken_broth.html and it was also super easy.

This is my go-to recipe when I am sick and want some soup. The only thing I do differently is cook the noodles separately. I don't like how the noodles expand when you don't finish the soup within a day.

I cooked the chicken along with the veggies based on other peoples reviews.  The fat from the chicken was just floating to the top...I kept scooping it out best I could.  Next time I will cook the chicken separately because that was really annoying.  The soup was tasty though. Will make again :)

This was definitely quick and easy. I just cant have soup where the stock comes from the can. I'd rather take the extra time to make fresh homemade stock and shredded chicken parts over just chicken breast, that usually ends up being tough.

I didn't think that such a quick and easy soup would be very good, but I was plesantly surprised! I made exactly as stated, except I used a rotisserie chicken and frozen egg noodles and added about 1/2 cup of heavy cream at the end just because I had it. I will do this again because it was excellent!

This is my go to weeknight chicken noodle soup recipe. Its so quick and easy to throw together and my family loves it.  I do usually double the reicpe and add extra veggies because we all love them.  I also cook my noodles seperatly and just add them to the bowl as I serve it.  Some of us prefer fewer noodles and it makes the soup better when you reheat the leftovers.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe. So fast to make, and tasty too! I didn't hardly have to change a thing, which is unusual for me. I did saute the carrots along with the onions and celery so they would be more tender. And I added a little more onion than called for. It came out yummy!

This is my favorite Chicken Noodle Soup recipe.  So easy.  The first time I made it my son was home sick.  We loved it!  Today my daughter is home sick and I've added mushrooms and substituted cream of mushroom soup for the veg soup.  It's the best I've ever had!

Excellent & easy! Needed a quick chicken noodle for a sick hubby. Didn't have egg noodles, just used mini bowties. Followed other suggestions and added garlic with the onion and carrots. We didn't add any extra salt. Will keep!

My kids love this, my husband loves this. I even double the recipe when I make it so that I can freeze it and always have it on hand when someone in the house gets sick or just when we feel like soup.

I am so proud of myself!  Something my dad served me when I was little and sick, from a can, I can now make from scratch and it rocks!  So easy too!  I had to make adjustments based on what I had at home.  (Used 1 cup home made chicken stock instead of vegi broth, no celery, and used whole wheat noodles.) I also sauteed the carrots at the beginning with the onion and reserved my cooked noodles and cooked chicken breast and added that at the very end.  However, my noodles were a little mushy and so next time I will just add the dry noodles to the broth at end as the recipe says to do!  (I think I was following one of the reviews and it didn't work for me.)

this was a very easy chicken noodle soup. I uses yolk free egg noodles, for zero cholesterol, I also added herbs de providence with the oregano, and added 2 teaspoons of minced garlic. My picky eater 12 year old even ate it, a hit in our home.

I thought this was very good! I didn't have any celery and I used rotini instead of egg noodles. I used two cans of carrots, and a whole onion.  Also added a bay leaf.  I doubled the amount of chicken broth and didn't use vegetable broth! Turned out really really yummy, but I would prob boil noodles separately next time so its not so starchy :)

Yum! A very soothing soup on a snowy winter day. I cooked the noodles seperate as other reviewers had suggested. I also added a can of cream of potato to give it a thicker texture. (any cream soup would be good) Next time someone isn't feeling well, I will totally be running back to this recipe!  

(In my individual bowl i squeezed alittle lime juice and added some hot sauce. soo good.)

I thought this soup was ok. My husband and daughter liked it better than I did. I substituted celery seeds instead of celery since all three of us dislike the vegetable version. I used canned carrots. I add about 3/4 TB minced garlic. Also added about 1/2 tsp dried thyme. And salt and pepper to taste. I found the soup bland--should have used more salt, I guess. But I'll be keeping it since it was a hit with hubby and daughter. Thanks.

Easy and fast sums this delicious recipe up.  I replaced the egg noodles with wheat noodles and the butter with olive oil to make it a little healthier.  My other addition was adding a little bit of cumin.  It made it smell and taste even more delightful.

This turned out wonderful!  I used frozen chicken and chicken stock that I had leftover from boiling an entire chicken and just added one can of chicken broth and a little boullion.  I omitted the oregano.  Very happy with the results!

This is EASY and very YUMMY.  I didn't have vegetable broth, so I used all chicken broth and I used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken and only needed about half the chicken.  I love that this soup has the perfect amount of chicken and veggies too, and has a ton of broth also, which I love.  I will definitely be making this again!

Love this recipe.  I made it exactly as stated.  It has a great flavor to it!!!  Egg noodles are really good in this recipe.  My family of 4 loved it.  I just wish I would have doubled the recipe because we ate it right up and wanted more.

Wonderful recipe!  My one year old, husband and I all enjoy this at least once a week.  I only made a few changes based on some of the other reviews.  I throw the carrots in with the onion and celery in the butter.  I also add a clove of garlic, minced to the butter concoction.  I like to use 2 cups of whole wheat egg noodles per 6 servings.  I usually double or triple the recipe and freeze any remaining.  5 stars for sure!

I just started cooking about a month ago and this was really easy to make and very yummy! I couldn't find veggie broth so I added extra chicken broth. Some other changes I made were: adding a little extra chicken and spices. Adding ANOTHER 14.5 oz can of chicken broth. I also cut the amount of onions in half since we are not big fans but I did want the taste. I used more noodles. I nearly doubled carrots bc I love them! I also added a little garlic powder, adobo and 2 chicken boullion cubes. It was very very very good! Next time I may add even more broth bc with all the additions I made to suit our large family, I noticed the amount of liquid boiled down into the ingredients. It would certainly still be classified as soup but... Haha!

I used 2 chicken rotisserie  breasts and double the veggies and spices. Otherwise it was really simple and super yummy!

I made this using left over chicken from a whole chicken that we ate the night before.  Oddly enough, I had no vegetable broth or chicken broth.  So, I added 8 cups of water and around 3 tbs. of Knorr's Caldo con sabor de pollo (chicken flavor bouillon) and it was wonderful!!  Will deff make again.  Thanks for sharing.

I added a couple bay leaves and cooked the chicken breasts in the broth then chopped up after it was cooked and threw it back in the broth. Added lots of garlic and cooked with brown rice instead of the egg noodles. yum yum!

I used a rotisserie chicken to add flavor to the broth. I also used a mixture of low sodium chicken and vegetable broth to make it less salty. I cooked egg noodles separately and heated it up with the soup when I wanted to eat it. It was very soothing and got lots of compliments on it.

Loved this soup.  I made a huge pot of this 2 weeks ago and put single servings in zip lock bags and froze it.  Followed the recipe except I doubled the veggies.  I made this last fall too and totally enjoyed nice, homemade soup on those chilly winter days.

Very quick and easy, and my husband absolutely loved it.  I did sautee the butter, garlic, onion, celery and carrots.  I then added bite-sized raw pieces of chicken along with the broth, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and a few shakes of poultry seasoning and thyme.  I brought it to a boil and added uncooked gluten-free penne noodles to the boiling water and simmered for 20 minutes.  I understand why some people cook the noodles separately because my noodles absorbed all the broth (most of which was vegetable by the way since I had it on hand), so I ended up with a really delicious chicken soup pasta dish, and my husband said the noodles were really delicious because they absorbed all the broth.  I could have easily added more broth to make it soupier, but we actually really enjoyed it as a pasta dish.  Next time I'll add more broth though. I served with parmesan on top.

This is one of those recipes that I will print for my recipe box.  I havent felt well for days and canned soup was just not cutting it and since I had left over rotisserie chicken (home made rotisserie) I figured why not.
I used everything EXCEPT the vegetable broth, and instead doubled the chicken broth content. I also added water as I used quite a bit of chicken and a VERY large stock pot, so that way the noodles would be covered.

It was simply delicious. Next time I'll cut back on the onion and will NOT add salt (the broth had plenty, I forgot) but it is definitely coming back to my kitchen, my kids DEVOURED it!

First bite of this soup and you know, the ingredients where made for each other. Wonderful blend of texture, flavor and warmth for the heart. 
I used sodium free canned chicken broth and it was still a bit too salty for my taste. Will probably forgo the salt shaker next time which won't be to far away.

Fantastic recipe!  I took a tip from a reviewer and added a whole rotisserie chicken in the broth/veggie mix for 20 minutes, removed, took off bone and added back to soup.  Fabulous flavor!  Tossed in a bay leaf as well...really nice soup and reheats well too!

used a rotisserie chicken, 2 garlic cloves, added 1 cup more of noodles than suggested, half of a small light sour cream container (4 oz), and 1.5 fresh squeezed lemon juice at the end. Seriously the best and most soothing chicken noodle soup Ive ever had! Perfect for cold and flu season and so quick and easy! Will be a regular on the menu at our house! Thank you Maryvm!

Quick and Easy! I had never made homemade chicken noodle soup before this recipe. This recipe was a hit. I used canned chicken (I buy them in a pack at SamsClub). That even made it easier. Was very good and even my picky kids liked it. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is better than the Swanson recipe because the addition of the Vegetable Broth smooths out the flavor of the chicken broth and makes this recipe more like 'good old home made' chicken noodle soup.  I do,however, usually add a little more chicken and vegetables.  That's the way my family likes it.  Also, Very fast and Easy.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was soooo easy. I sauteed the chicken breast in cubes with basil, garlic, and onion powder on low. I used twice the amt of stock and used brown egg noodles. I used close to 3/4 tsp of oregano and basil. I was initially gonna add cream of chicken with herbs but found this was tasty and thick enough. I sauteed in butter but will try olive oil in future since I hardly ever cook with butter. My husband, King Finicky, loved it! I wasnt sure whether to simmer with top on or not so I put it on half way.

I give this recipe five stars! I added more noodles and chicken as someone suggested and used only chicken broth resulting in a wonderful soup! The broth was a bit thick because of my additons but ever so creamy! I will add a bit more broth at the start the next time I make this to compensate for my bulkier soup. A new favorite!

This was a great easy soup that my family all loved!  I put the carrots in to saute with the onion and celery so they were a little more tender.  And added LOTS more noodles because that's how we prefer soup.  But otherwise followed the recipe.  Delicious!

Classic representation. I forgot to add basil and oregano, but I did add some seasoning salt, Sweet Hungarian Paprika and turnip.

Very good, made a few alterations used parsnips instead of carrots, left out the celery, added about a cup of sliced leeks, added some garlic and a can of corn and probably doubled the amount of egg noodles it called for. loved it we will definitely use this again.

Great recipe base! I changed it up a little with what I had, no celery, I used canned mushrooms instead, sauteed with onions and garlic. GREAT!

Like the recipe said, quick and easy.  It was perfect for our family of 5 that was in a rush.  We used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe, great for beginners! I always use extra broth and just cook the chicken in the soup, it's great with either egg noodles or rice too!

So yummy! I made this while the hubby was recovering from surgery and we managed to it almost the entire pot! Super easy to make and i dont even like chicken noodle soup, or so i thought. To make it even easier i used cooked chicken in a can that i had in my pantry. 5 star dish! I wouldnt change a thing on this recipe!

Love this recipe..it was just a little bland so I added some crushed red peppers and increased some of the other seasoning.  I also used low sodium chicken broth.

DEE-LICIOUS!!!!!! I will never again eat soup out of a can. My 5 year old daughter and I came down with some sort of bug. I remembered having saved this recipe and decided to try it out since she refuses to eat soup out of a can. We both LOVED it! She hates most vegetables, however loved them in this soup! I added a clove of minced garlic to the butter saute but besides that made exactly as called for. We're both actually feeling a lot better. Thanks so much!!

Easy & delicious !!! My husband is at home with the flu today & I just made a double batch of this. Will heat it up and make grilled cheese to go with it for the kids when they get home from school. Perfect for warming you up. Very hearty & flavorful. Everyone will think you spent hours preparing.

Very good and very quick.  The only changes that I made was to add a little garlic powder, sage and rosemary to taste.  I also used a cooked, store bought chicken to save time.  It was yummy good.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Maryvm.

Used half broth and half water. Had to boil/simmer longer to get the carrots soft. Added noodles 5 minutes before serving. Made for 18 servings and froze many bowls individually for future lunches!

Do not double the noodles (like the first reviewer said or you get pasta), do not add cream of soup. We ate this in spite of the "pasta" feel but I wouldn't make it again that way. I'll make it as originally called for next time. :)

My family could not get enough of this! I used a rotissiere chicken that was seasoned.....ummmm! Next time I will double the recipe so there is enough. Just be sure to add the noodles after all of the vegetables are tender, so they do not get mushy. Enjoy and God bless!

This soup is good! But, it's a bit salty! Use low sodium Chicken broth and Veggie broth to cut the salt.

I give it 4 stars because it's not an amazing dish, but for easy chicken noodle soup, it's perfect. I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store since I was short on time and the flavor turned out great. I added garlic like everyone else suggested and sauted the carrots at the beginning with the celery and onions.

Exactly what I was looking for, thank you for posting! I was feeling nauseous like I was getting a stomach bug and homemade chicken soup was the only thing that remotely appealed, but the last thing I felt like doing was cooking! I only knew of the whole-chicken, starting from scratch method and all I had was chicken breasts, so this really saved the day! I had to improvise based on what I had, but it still came out as exactly what I was craving. Definitely satisfying and INFINITELY better than any canned soup would ever be. Thanks again!

Very good!  I followed Brown Sugar Girl's recommendations, except for the noodle part.  I always use Reames frozen egg noodles in soups, I highly recommend it.  Just add the noodles to the broth to cook.  Great basic recipe to play with!

Extremely easy and a good way to use up extra chicken.  I took the advice of others and added additional noodles, about 1 additional cup.  I also used only chicken broth and a cup of water rather than using vegetable stock.  I threw the carrots into the pot just before adding the broth and other ingredients, which kept them just slightly crunchy.

Not very impressive. Was disappointed after reading all the reviews. I used homemade chicken stock rather than store bought, so perhaps that was the difference. It came out fairly bland and needed a lot of salt to have any flavor. Will not be making again.

This was fabulous! I am somewhat new to cooking homemade items like soup, and this was easy and delish! The subsitution I made was turkey instead of chicken. It smells wonderful on the stove and was a big hit with the family!

This soup is delicious. I doubled the chicken and the noodles and left out the celery. My husband loved it so much he asked me to make it again but to do twice as much because there was nothing left!

This was so quick & easy!!  My fiance went hunting for the week & wanted something that was mild (most of my soups are spicy!) to keep in the crockpot so all they had to do was keep it on the warm setting & could eat on it as they came in for lunch/dinner.  He specifically requested chicken noodle soup so I tried this recipe...  His dad told him I need to make this soup again very soon!  They finished it off in the first day!    I used a whole rotessirie chicken & just peeled it off the bones.  I added 2 cloves of garlic about 3 minutes into cooking the onion & celery.  My grocery store was out of vegetable stock so I used 5 cans of chicken broth.  Other than that, I made it as is & it turned out incredible for how easy it was!!  This recipe will definitely be saved & made again & again!

This soup is sooo good! My husband had the flu for 9 days and this is the only thing made him feel better. It will be a weekly recipe for me from now on. It is so wonderful that I am going to try it with leftover turkey after the holidays. Highly recommend for everyone!

Really good. I followed reviewers advice and sauteed the onion, garlic, celery and carrots in a little butter. I only needed 4 cups of salt reduced chicken stock, but then again, I didn't add pasta. I've been feeling like I'm coming down with the flu and every single person in my family loved this even though I made it to get some vitamins. My soup hater finished hers first and declared it delicious. If you need a good chicken soup to fix your cold, try this.

Awesome recipe and very easy.  I followed the reviews of others and sauteed minced garlic with the onion and celery and I also added a half can of cream of chicken soup at the end.  Yummy - will use again and again.

Thank you so much for sharing this with others. I have a large family of 12 and we have a few who are sick. I wanted to make chicken soup and this was the one I chose to try and I am glad I did. Everyone loves it! This will not just be made when someone isn't feeling well in our home. I thought is was unusual with the vegetable broth but I assure you you will not be sorry for trying this soup. It is wonderful! Thanks again!

It was pretty good. Next time I make it I'll add a little garlic and simmer it longer so the flavors blend a little more. I added some shredded zucchini because I had an abundance from my garden. I'm adding zucchini to anything I can. Adds more veggies and the kids don't even notice.

This could very well be the best bowl of chicken noodle soup I have ever tasted! It was so incredibly easy to prepare! I used organic low-sodium chicken broth and in place of the vegetable both, I used water mixed with a few cubes of vegetable bouillon. I decided to try out this recipe when I came down with a bad cold, and boy did it work wonders! It made a HUGE pot of soup, which I thought I'd never finish, but everyone loved it so much it was gone within a day!

This was DELISH. I added a tiny little bit of red pepper flake as I sauted the celery & carrots. As others did I also used a rotisserie chicken & I also tossed in a bay leaf as always with any chicken soup.This turned out to be THE BEST chicken noodle soup that I have ever made. THANK U

I will never eat canned soup again! This is the first soup recipe I decided to make because it looked quite easy. I did as one reviewer said about using 1 cup of celery, 1 cup of carrots, 1 cup of onion, and three cups of noodles. If I hadn't done that the soup would have been too much liquid rather than chunky.

Very good! Chopped up chicken that I baked in a little broth, sauteed garlic, onion, celery, and carrots in butter, threw in a bay leaf, thickened with a little cream of chicken soup and used homemade amish noodles. Kept the rest the same. A keeper!

this is a great and very easy recipe to follow. i hate to say it but its even better than my MIL's! (don't tell her). i doubled the recipe, omitted the celery, added 4 cloves of garlic, a cup and a half of fresh corn off of the cob, and 1 small sweet potato (diced). i did add a can of the cream of chicken soup and a bit of flour to thicken up the broth to my liking. VERY tasty!!

The best soup ever!  My family raved about it!  I made this today, tripling the recipe, but used my own chicken broth (along with canned vegetable broth) from the whole chicken I boiled and deboned yesterday (I even cut up my veggies yesterday as well to cut down on kitchen time today).  I also added chopped garlic and cream of chicken soup (not really for creaminess but for flavor and salt so I didn't need to sprinkle in much salt at all) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Oh, I also sauteed all the veggies and garlic together, not just the celery and onion.  I will definitely be making this again and will one day try using all store bought broth when I don't have time to make my own.  This is definitely a good starter for people like me who have never made chicken noodle soup.

This is the best chicken noodle soup I have ever eaten!  I can't follow a recipe exactly for the life of me, so of course, I tweaked it a little, but it is incredible!  This is what I did:  Boiled four chicken thighs in 8 cups water until the meat fell off the bones, then cut the chicken into small pieces and discarded the bones.  Sauted all the veggies as suggested by Brown Sugar Girl.  I also threw in about one cup of frozen chopped spinach leaves for some extra "good green stuff" and iron!    Added 6 teaspoons chicken granules and the spices as recommended by Brown Sugar Girl to the water I boiled the chicken in and returned the water to a boil.  Cooked three packages of the cheapest, generic "Ramen" noodles I had in six cups of hot water in the microwave for five minutes.  Drained them and added them to the pot of chicken and broth along with all the veggies and simmered for about 5 minutes (that is all I could wait!).  I then had to go back and make another pot because it was so good that my husband and I literally finished off the first batch for LUNCH!  That time I didn't add any spinach because I had used all I had in the freezer in the first batch, but I tripled the carrots and celery.  YUMMY!    Really, really yummy soup that will definitely be on our weekly rotation!

This is a great soup recipe.  To save yourself a step, cut up the chicken and throw it right in the broth/veggie mixture to cook.  It only takes a few minutes and comes out very tender, plus it adds more chicken flavor to the soup.

Update: This recipe does not freeze well.  Changed rating from 4 to 3 stars.  I'll probably stick with the canned stuff for this reason.  Original rating: This is an easy and quick recipe.  I didn't measure anything and it still came out great.  Here are my modifications (bear in mind I halved the recipe): Add more onion and noodles;  saute the onions, celery, and carrots in the butter until almost tender; use 1 can of 33% less sodium chicken broth, 1 can of regular chicken broth, and a 1/2 can of vegetable broth.  I hope this helps.

This was fantastic! I doubled the veggies and herbs. Only salted the veggies while they were cooking in the butter and added some extra cajun seasoning to the broth as it was simmering. Cooked the chicken and noodles in the broth for better flavor. My 1st attempt with Chicken Noodle soup it was GREAT! Will make again....

This is outstanding soup! It's so easy to make, and not intimidating at all. Anyone can make this. This is definely becoming a stable recipe in our household. I doubled the batch, and followed the directions to a tee, except added double the chicken. I made the soup in a pot over the stove, then put it in a crock pot to keep Lo/warm. I took the suggestion of adding the noodles in last, and put them in a 1/2-1 hr before serving. This seemed to work well. I made it for dinner Halloween night as we were having another family over, and I thought it would be quick and easy to serve with good bread. Little did I know everyone wanted seconds, even thirds for some and I  received rave reviews. There was little to spare after the four adults and 5 kids ate it. It also hit the spot after coming in from the cold from trick or treaking, everyone warmed up with a cup of soup. Delicious!

Followed others suggestions and doubled the veggies (celery, onion and carrots). I also doubled the chicken and used whole wheat egg noodles. Very, very tasty!

Very easy. FLAVORFUL!! Great comfort food on a cold night. We made grilled cheese sandwiches to go along with it. Was great! Will make this part of my regular menu. :) Thanks so much for the recipe! ~Joy

Love this recipe!  So easy to whip together.  I bought a rotissere chicken and used that for the soup.  Although I think this is a good quick way to get chicken in the soup, it felt apart and was really stringy and i think a bit overcooked.  I will try to make the time to do my own chicken next time.  I did use chicken bouliion instead of broth and while I think this added flavor it also added salt.  I did not add any other salt and still felt it was borderline too salty.  Next time I'll use more water with the boullion.  We LOVED this soup.  I doubled it and it was nice to have for a couple of meals.  This will be a Fall fave in our house!

Loved this soup... it was quick and easy, and so smooth on a cool or rainy evening.  The only thing I did different was to add chicken broth and a ton more chicken, but that's just personal preference.  The truth is, this recipe has a great foundation for anyone to accomodate to their own tastes.  Thanks!

THIS RECIPE DOESN'T NEED ANY CHANGES!  My husband made this soup for me when I was really sick a few weeks ago, and it was amazing.  It really was quick and easy, plus extremely delicious!  He used an already cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store which made it even easier!  We will definitely make this soup again!

We loved this soup! Yes, I agree it is going to be only as good as the broth you use, as someone mentioned...so use good broth! I added a teaspoon of Penzey's chicken soup base, and based on the other reviews, added chopped garlic and sauteed all the vegetables together (only 1/4 cup celery). I used marjoram instead of the oregano due to personal preference. Rotisserie chicken is so flavorful for this and ups the "easy" factor. Thank you Mary, for a keeper :)

Very good recipe.  Easy to make.  I added a can of Rotel tomatoes (drained) for a little spicy kick.  Used canned chicken as well for convenience.  Will be making this again!

WONDERFUL!  I absolutely loved this recipe.  It has such a classic flavor, plus a little extra with the addition of the basil.  If you leave out the noodles until serving time, it freezes beautifully!

I wasn't impressed by this recipe. I'm not a huge chicken noodle soup fan, but I've had better. I added garlic and used rotisserie chicken meat, but this recipe was still missing something. There wasn't a lot of flavor (or maybe the spices in the recipe just don't work), and it didn't really remind me of chicken noodle soup. My boyfriend finished his bowl, but I couldn't finish mine. It just didn't do it for me.

I really love this recipe.  It is so easy!  I made a few changes based on previous reviewers.  First I changed butter to olive oil, Second I added 3-4 cloves of garlic (minced), Third I sauteed all the veggies together with the garlic, Fourth  I added a bay leaf.  Fifth I usually make it a few hours early and let it simmer some.  I added the noodles about 20 minutes before serving.

This was a great recipe.  The changes I made were only using Chicken broth and I used the "homemade" noodles that you can find in the freezer section.  It made this soup feel even more like Grandma's!

Usually I make chicken soup with a whole chicken, making my own stock.  When my daughter came home with a cold though, I had to make due with what I had on hand.  I expected this to be a somewhat mediocre soup, good enough for someone who couldn’t taste that well.  This was a surprisingly good soup!  I sautéed the carrots and raw chicken chunks along with the onions and celery.  The vegetable broth made the canned chicken broth have a much more interesting flavor.  As always, I cooked the noodles separately and added them to the soup as we ate it.  I will make this soup again.

I've always been a poor broth soup maker, so I was hesitant to try a soup which looked so easy, as I've tried making chicken soup from whole chickens, etc. and it was a waste of time because it never had great chickeney flavor and the end product was cloudy.  This was the easiest and best chicken soup I've ever tried.  I also sauteed the carrots first to make them more tender.  I used very good quality bought chicken broth and would recommend the same.  Use white pepper, it seems to really add to this soup.

Delicious and easy! I used chicken granules  and water instead of canned broth + the can of vegetable broth. Also used frozen noodles instead of dried egg noodles, just added them to the pot for the last 30 min. Everyone in the family liked it. Simple recipe, thanks for sharing!

I've made this twice since I discovered it before Christmas.  It's so easy and fast.  I cooked the noodles seperately once and together with the rest of the soup once.  To be honest, I didn't notice a difference.  I also used Costco rotisserie chicken the second time, and it was SO tender.

Thanks, Vincenza for this wonderful recipe. I had a left-over large[had been lightly fried this previous night]chicken breast. Since there are only 2 of us, I tried your wonderful soup recipe! Since I didn't have canned chicken broth, but had 2 consentrated chicken bouillion cubes which I diluted + 1 pint of  frozen chicken broth I had on hand], and 2 consentrated vegetable cubes. I used small egg noodles & this is superb & thrifty! I did saute' the veggies before adding.  Update:I freeze this wonderful soup with the noodles-comes out perfectly; and also used chicken bouillion granules-just keep my freezer full for a warm, quick lunch-still think, also, the basil & oregano make it great + added IQF peas & carrots for more vegetables.Another update: has anyone thought to boil the bones of the chicken..even breasts..for more broth. I do that...great for flu-ridden friends & family. UPDATE:for those who don't have vegetable broth[none in my stores]I use dry Knorrs Vegetable Mix..just a few sprinkles. Can adjust to taste.

Another great recipe. I did not use basil. I used dried parsley and dried thyme to my liking about 2 tsps each. This recipe is easy to prepare. Perfect, I will make this often. Thanks.

This was very good however I made a few changes. I made this in the slow cooker as it is the easiest for me on busy days. I used olive oil in place of the butter and a 16oz. bag of Reames frozen noodles. (We like the frozen noodles better as they have a chewy texture that reminds us of homemade noodles!) After cooking the vegetables and chicken in the olive oil, I threw everything in the slow cooker for approx. 3 hours on high. Add the noodles the last 45-60 minutes of the cooking time and enjoy.  These noodles will really soak up the broth so if you like a more brothy consistency you may need to add a little more chicken broth.

I made this tonight.  My hubby was workin later, and he usually doesn't eat soup... which sucks because I'm a huge soup lover...

I changed a few things, to my taste.  First of all, i almost doubled the noodles.  I sauteed the onion with some garlic cloves, and also added corn and peas...  

added a couple chicken bullion cubes and just a lil cream of chicken.. delish!

my husband got home, and i TRIED to get him to eat some... he LOVED IT!  i've never gotten him to eat soup before.  I'm adding this to my recipe box :)

Sooooo good! I followed this recipe just as it was written, but added minced garlic to my sauteed vegetables. Next time I will follow the advice of other reviewers and double up on the veggies and pasta to make it a heartier soup.

Super easy and it smells AMAZING. I tweaked it slightly and added some frozen green beans, and a lot of extra chicken, because we like our stuff meaty! Great recipe. :D

We loved it!  I'm definitely keeping this one!

I boiled my own boneless, skinless chicken breasts, used the broth as my base and threw in a few chicken bullion cubes for good measure.  I had run out of egg noodles and had to use rainbow rotini instead - turned out just fine.  I didn't add any salt as the bullion cubes had more than enough.  I also sautéed the carrots with the onion and celery as another reviewer had suggested.

This was so delicious and made the house smell wonderful on a cold night. The recipe takes a little longer than 30 minutes (accounting for the time it takes to boil the soup), but not too much longer. The only thing I added was corn, as a preference, and I used a store bought rotisserie chicken that I shredded up myself. I also took another reviewers advice and put the carrots in with the butter, onion, and celery. They were so tender! This recipe is simply Delicious!!

This recipe was awesome.  I usually do not like chicken noodle soup but this recipe is packed with flavor.  I added fresh minced garlic with the onion, celery and carrots. I also added the noodles toward the very end.  It is a very quick and easy recipe.

One of my very favorite chicken soups. Important to use homemade chicken broth from the cooked chicken. I season my broth with Lawry's seasoning salt, pepper, and a little powdered garlic while simmering the chicken. I also think the additional vegetable broth gives it a great flavor. (I use Swanson's vegetable broth in a box). Double vegetables and add more chicken to this recipe! Top it off with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and dig in!

Very easy!!  I used one can water instead of 4 cans broth to cut down on the salt.  Also let simmer an hour longer and added the noodles the last half hour.  Used 1 cup celery instead of 1/2 and doubled the noodles.  Also, added 2 cups frozen corn and 1 cup frozen green beans the laqst half hour for more veggies!  Yum!

It was quick and easy but tasted too instant to me. No salt needed. I even think you could use 3 chicken broth cans instead of 4 and add water instead. Definitely could use more veggies.

Absolutely delicious.  We doubled the noodles and it was super! I also cooked the noodles separately because the first time the noodles came out too soft.  Thanks!

Yum! I cut this roughly in half for my small family and used 1 can regular chicken broth and 1 can garlic chicken broth (Swanson). I didn't really measure anything else, just sort of threw it in :) The only changes I made were to saute the carrots along with the celery and onion; I also added fresh parsely and a little fresh cilantro and used broken up angel hair pasta for the noodles. I seriously wanted to eat it all in one sitting.

I've made this twice and both times were delish!  I used 1/8 cup "Better than Bouillion" and 7 cups water in place of the broth.  I used whole wheat egg noodles and I highly recommend them. Everything else I just guestimated based on how much of what I like in my soup.  I love it!  You can't go wrong.

Quick and easy is right.  This soup is excellent. I made some of the changes suggested by other reviewers:  I upped the chicken to 12 oz., egg noodles to 2-1/2 c. and added garlic.  I am a salt person but I thought this was borderline too salty so next time I will use 2 cans "low sodium" chicken broth and 2 regular.  I didn't add any salt "to taste" as the recipe suggested. I used roasted chicken from a whole roasted chicken... the kind you buy hot at the market.  I think that added extra flavor.  Also next time I am going to increase the onion to 3/4 c. and the celery to 1 c.  The whole family loved this soup.  I think I will have some of the leftovers for lunch!!! Yum!

This soup was fantastic!  I read the recipe wrong initially and only purchased one can of chicken broth, so I had to use bouillan cubes.  It tasted so good I made the recipe again the next week but used all canned broth.  The broth definitely made the soup more rich than the cubes did, but it was nice to know that the cubes will work(and taste just fine) in a pinch!  I also added a pinch of rosemary and a touch of garlic salt (instead of regular salt) to the soup giving it a nice flavor.  My husband tries new recipes tentatively, and he approved this one!

This was sooo easy and tasty. I boiled aprox. 1.5 lbs of boneless chicken to start(we like meat). I also used about 2-3/4 cups of egg noodles. The kids loved it.

A very simple, yummy soup. I added a can of water, garlic, and cilantro to give it a little more flavor.  Simmer for longer than 20 minutes to mix the flavors better!

This was a quick and easy soup. I made it with turkey instead of chicken and it turned out great. I did use homemade turkey stock which I think added to the flavor.  Will make again.

My daughter loves canned chicken noodle soup so I thought I would try this one.  I made a few changes - more onions & celery, added garlic.  I only had 2 cans of broth so filled in with water/bouillon.  I wanted to add a cream of chicken soup to add a little thickness but only had potato so I used that.

The biggest difference was that I didn't have fresh chicken so I used canned.  I had never used canned chicken before but it worked.  After adding the basil and oregano the flavor really filled out.  I thought it was a very good soup. My daughter didn't like the veggies so next time I'll strain them out before adding the chicken and noodles.  Thanks for the recipe and all the reviews.

I was really impressed with this very easy and comforting soup. It tasted like I had been cooking it all day, when in fact I was tired from picking pumpkins at our local farm that day! A few things I changed simply for personal preference. I doubled the celery  and used a little bit more butter to saute the carrots and celery together. Omitted the onions but used onion powder in it's place along with a little garlic powder. I used a 15oz. box of low sodium chicken broth (all I had on hand) and used 3/4 of a rotissere chicken.
This is my new favorite chicken noodle soup and I got a "better than my Jewish mother's" from my hubby!

GREAT! I was so relieved. The last soup I made turned out rather bland and disgusting... but this one is really yummy. My best gal pal even said it was the best chicken noodle she's ever had. I didn't use 4-14.5 oz. cans of chicken broth; I just bought the largest can of chicken broth available (46 oz.). Helped keep down the saltiness, I think! Perfect ratio of all ingredients. :)

I asolutely LOVED this recipe.  It is definetely a comfort food for me, and was so simple to put together.  As most cooks do, I made my own small changes to my likings.  I minced garlic when sauteing the onions and celery.  I also used a can of condensed cream of chicken soup and a can of condensed cream of broccoli soup to even enhance the flavor.  Because of this, I had to add some water, but will use just one more can of chicken broth next time.  Also, because I like a lot of noodles, I used an entire 16oz. bag.  This recipe turned out great, and you can't go wrong.  I'll be making this one time and time again!

I really tried to follow the recipe!  Instead of oregano & basil, I used a serrano chile and some chopped cilantro.  Plus I didn't have any noodles, so I tossed in some rice.  It was spicy but delicious, even my DGS - 6 - couldn't get enough!  Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe.

This soup was absolutely delicious; my husband and kids loved it.  I think it is a 5 star recipe with a few changes.  I used chicken broth instead of bouillon and water and added some garlic pepper. I used a rotisserie chicken for the meat.  This will be a cold weather staple for us!

This was really good and was exactly what I was looking for.  Like others suggested, I was generous with the vegetables and substituted Cream of Chicken soup for one of the Chicken Broths.  The first time I made this, I followed their suggestions and increased the amount of noodles, but have since decreased them back to the amount in the recipe since I want this as a soup and not as chicken and noodles. Very good - thanks for sharing!

This was perfect! I didn't have any onion, so I put in some garlic powder instead. It was great! I took this to my "lunch club" at work, and everyone loved it. Thanks!

Really good. I will be making it again. My whole family loved it. However I did take another reviewer's suggestion and cooked the carrots for about 12 minutes before I added them to the soup. I let the celery and onion boil for awhile in the broth before adding the chicken also. I just like my vegetables pretty tender - that's just me though. Thanks alot!!

Ummm, good!  I used water (that I had boiled the chicken in) with chicken bouillon instead of the broth, added a little parsley and a bay leaf, and used a bag of matchstick carrots.  It was delicious!  I'll be making this many times.

Great soup.  The only thing I would do different, is wait to add the noodles.  By the time the carrots were done, the noodles were a little on the soft side. Or if you wanted, instead of using fresh carrots, used canned ones, drained.  That would make it a little quicker too.  Overall, everyone loved this soup.  Will make again.

My husband is an amazing cook.  I made this for him tonight (since he down with a bug) and he says it is the best chicken soup he's ever had.  I used celery salt and garlic powder as substitutes and added an extra couple of cups of water.  If he says it's good, I'm keeping it In the book!

It's soup but doesn't taste one bit like homemade chicken soup.  We won't be making it again.  There are many other tasty last- minute soups.

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  I used the chicken from one of those whole rotisserie chickens from the grocery store.  I bought too many chickens the night before and had one whole chicken leftover.  I used 2 tablespoons of butter instead of 1 tablespoon.  I also increased and added spices.  I used a full teaspoon of each: oregano, basil, parsley & garlic powder.  I also added 3 cups of noodles instead of 1 1/2 c. of noodles. Delicious!

I wanted chicken noodle soup because I have a bad sinus infection. I do not like canned soup and wanted to cook my own. As usual I turned to Allrecipes and found this one. 

This was my very first time making homemade chicken noodle soup. I followed the directions given but added sweet peas for more color and veggies, and I seasoned my chicken breast with onion powder and garlic powder. I also used whole grain noodles and minced onions instead of chopped onions. However, next time I will cut up my chicken breast into smaller pieces. Overall it is delicious and very, very easy to make.

Love!!! Best chicken soup ever- so much flavor!
Added a couple of things- used a full cup of onions, celery, and carrots instead of 1/2 cup. Sautéed all the vegetables in the butter with two cloves of garlic. Added a bayleaf & used a Rosemary & garlic rotisserie chicken to save time. Cooked 2 cups of dry egg noodles separately and added towards the end. Awesome! Thanks for the recipe:)

Great easy soup. I sautéed the carrots with onion,celery and 1 small can of mushrooms. Add about 3 qts of either canned chicken stock or a mixture of chicken and vegetable stock. 
I added 1/2 lb of leftover rotisserie chicken and 1 cup of frozen mixed vegetables. Simmer 20 min.  Add  12 ounces of cooked noodles. Add 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper. Simmer 5 minutes. 
Top with a few Italian seasoned croutons and a little Parmesan cheese.       Yum

I am not a very good cook so this easy recipe was just what i was looking for.  BTW I accidently used beef broth instead of vegatable broth and it was really good.  This just shows how much i hate the kitchen...i can't even read ingredients correctly. Lol. THANKS for posting and i will definitely make again...WITH vegetable broth this time.

Very easy but delicious recipe. I used Italian seasoning  and 12oz of egg noodles because I prefer less broth. I also used the breast of a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken. I would and plan to make this recipe again.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I read the reviews and did what brown sugar girl said and sautéd the garlic, carrots, celery and onion together. I didn't have veggie stock or broth so I cooked my chicken breasts in the chicken stock and seasoned it with a little bit of basil, oregano, seasoning salt and garlic powder. After baking I added the broth from my baked chicken to my soup base. I also used 1 cup of all veggies rather then the 1/2 cup.  I also followed another reviewers tip and didn't cook my pasta in it, I boiled my pasta separately and added it to my soup myself. My husband and I both loved this recipe so much it will be used in my household from this day forward! Please try it you will love it!

This was absolutely delicious! I made a few changes for food allergies - I used ghee instead of butter, only used organic chicken broth (no vegetable broth) and I used gluten free corn and rice spaghetti noodles which I added in the last 10 minutes of simmering. I also added a little cooked chicken juice to the soup. This was delicious! I'll definitely make it again!

An easy chicken soup! My review is more for my own reference when I make it again... I used 3 chicken breasts halves (~ 2lbs.) cubed, 1 box chicken broth plus 1 box vegetable broth, 5 diced carrots, 4 diced celery stalks, 1 M onion, minced, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp parsley. I sautéed the veggies in butter until slightly tender ~10min then added all the other ingredients and let cook on low in the crock pot. Cooked the noodles separately.  Very good! I will make this again.

My girlfriend had a cold so I made this recipe. I made it in the crock pot and cooked for about 4 hours (cooked egg noodles on stove). She loved it and I was a hero!

Used homemade chicken stock without adding any vegetable stock.  Otherwise, per the recipe.  Very good although next time may try coriander and cilantro instead of oregano and basil.

I had never made chicken soup before,  and my friend's mom passed away and I wanted to made something for the family. They were all so happy that I made this for them. I have made this 3 times in the past week so far and everyone that has tried it loves it!  I had never heard of adding basil and oregano to chicken soup but it really gives it a wonderful flavor.  So far I've only used chicken broth,  and the past two times I bought a cold rotisserie chicken to add (just pull off all of the meat and add it), and I simmer the carrots,  onions, garlic,  and celery in the butter before adding the chicken and broth and seasonings.  I also generally cook the noodles separate. This is a great recipe,  thank you!

Great recipe! Made a few changes but nothing major, mainly just followed the advice many others have given about this recipe. Upped the onions, celery and carrots to about 2 cups each. Sauted the onions, celery and carrots with garlic, in extra virgin olive oil and butter. Used the meat from a whole rotisserie chicken. Used 1 tsp of dried oregano and basil each. Also added 1/4 tsp of thyme powder. Added pepper. I used 4 cans of low sodium chicken broth, 1 can of vegetable broth. Brought to a boil then reduced heat and simmered for 20 minutes uncovered. Added rice noodles after 5 minutes of simmering and stirred every couple of minutes. It turned out tasting and smelling fantastic! My wife and two year old son both enjoyed it, and my sister-in-law said she wished she hadn't of just eaten before she came over. With the changes I made it came right up to 3 quarts before it reduced a little from cooking. Also, I thought it tasted so good it didn't even need any salt! Which is saying a lot for me.

My boyfriend said this was the best chicken noodle soup I've ever made.  Usually when I made chicken soup, 
 I make completely homemade broth, so this was surprising to hear!!!   I think the addition of a can of veggie broth was what made the real difference in this recipe.  I never would have thought to do that.  It seemed to brighten or enhance the flavor very subtly.  I used Swanson brand for both broths to avoid MSG, and the chicken broth was the fat free, 33% less sodium kind.   I  used leftover meat from a rotisserie chicken and also added a little garlic with the onion, and added a bay leaf while it was simmering, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I used carrots straight from the garden.  I will use this recipe from now on.  It certainly was much less time, less work, and we both liked it better, so it's win-win.  P.S.  It was even better the next day.

This is a very nice "quick" chicken soup that's better than canned by far.  So that's my rating.  I usually don't write reviews. After reading the reviews already written I just had to make a comment.  I was amazed to see how many people start out by saying the soup is great and then go about giving you their own, completely different, version.  I thought the idea of reviews was to rate the recipe at hand.  If you want to write your own recipe submit it as your own work and let people rate you.

My family & I LOVE THIS recipe!!  It's fast & hearty. I double the quantity of vegetables & pasta to make it more of a stew (we never eat much of the broth part lol) Inexpensive & tasty... just my style :)

Grilled the chicken using a garlic-infused olive oil and seasoned with a blend called 'Herbs de Provence'. Sautéed the onion and celery using same oil. Used 1tsp of that herb blend. Came out very nice and flavorful...did not add any additional salt or pepper. Used one box of low-sodium chicken broth and one box of regular for a little less salt.

Quick and definitely easy! This was a yummy soup (though it tastes even better if you season the chicken with some garlic powder and seasoning salt before cooking it).

Very good! My husband, 4 year olds and 19 month old loved it! I took the advice of fellow reviewers and used uncooked, chopped boneless thighs. I sautéed the veggies in butter, lightly seasoned the thighs before cooking and boiled the noodles separately. I will definitely make this again! I used 6 thighs, 4 carrots, 4 stalks of celery, 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 cup onions , 64 oz of chicken broth, 14.5 oz of veg broth and 3/4 bag of extra wide egg noodles. This will feed my family of 5 for two days if not more.

Its amazing! I'm a new cook, so im not that great, but it would be really hard to screw this up! I made it once for me when I got sick and once for my husband a couple days later. The first time I used grilled chicken and lots of broth. I liked that better.  The second time I made it with a rotisserie chicken and less broth, which my husband liked better because he got more chicken with his soup. :) Both ways were amazing though and super simple!

I have made this recipe several times following Brown Sugar Girl's suggestions & I have become famous for my homemade chicken soup! It is my go to meal for sick family & friends.  It is simple & Delicious! I do use the College Inn broth with roasted garlic & also the one with roasted veggies, it gives it an extra boost of flavor.  You can't go wrong with this recipe, even my fussy kids eat it!

Fantastic, I actually followed Brown Sugar Girl's directions for this soup because it made more sense to cook the chicken in the broth.  I normally use Better than Bouillon for my broth and found that I only had enough for 1 of the 14.5oz of chicken stock.  I used a pho cube I had and tripled the vegetarian broth.  The pho broth really took it to this wonderful spicy place.  I recommend.  Great recipe base!

Turned out AWESOME.  I increased the ingredients as I made a larger batch and I think the full TSP of Oregano made the soup taste amazing.  Very simple to make and tastes even better the next day!

Really great recipe! After reading some of the reviews, I did add 2 cloves of garlic to sauté in the butter along with the celery, onion and carrots. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as is and the result was delicious! Thanks for sharing.

Mmmm mmm mmm!   Soup is good food...especially this one!  The recipe is super easy to make and a million times better than any premade canned or bottled soup!    I added garlic powder, a dash of poultry seasoning and doubled the amount of noodles as recommended in a user review.  Next time I will sauté the carrots with the onion and celery.  Thanks for sharing MaryVM !!

I was looking for an easy to make Chicken Noodle Soup recipe. I have been cooking for years, but oddly have never made chicken noodle soup! This was a quick and easy base recipe. I did make a few additions because it was quite bland. I sauteed the onions, garlic, celery, and carrots for about 10 minutes then added the broth and spices. It was kind of dull at this point. I then added 1/2 tsp celery seed, 1/2 tsps onion powder, and 1 tsp chicken boullion (and of course, salt and pepper) and that made a huge difference. It was really tasty and everyone liked it :)

Although I just used this recipe to help ensure I had the correct ingredients, I didn't use the measurements or vegetable broth. I used part of the water that I boiled my chicken in, as well as my carrots were shredded, I put butter, carrots, celery, onions, basil and oregano in a skillet to sautéed while I cooked my noodles. Oh and I added flour to thicken it.  First time for me, it was delish!! Thanks so much to whomever posted the recipe.

Amazing recipe.  I added some poultry seasoning and used fresh herbs to include thyme and sage.  I use quite a bit of the fresh herb to boost the flavor.  I also added a can of cream of chicken soup.  This is definitely a family favorite.  Even my 4 year old loves it and asks for it all the time.

FAN-tastic. I've never made chicken noodle soup and my first attempt was a winner. I sautéed the onions, carrots, and celery together, and added the chicken during the last min of sautéing. I added the broth, seasonings, and a dash of thyme, and simmered for 20 min. I added uncooked egg noodles and and simmered for 7 more min. Truly excellent.

This is a great base recipe if you don't have much time or don't like scratch cooking.  I adjusted the recipe to my liking, adding thyme, fresh basil, cilantro, chives, garlic and a touch of sweet hot sauce.  Turned out great!

So easy. We did sauté the chicken in salt, pepper, garlic, and onion before using it and I'm glad because otherwise as directed the recipe would have been waaaay too bland. But it's a good recipe for a very basic chicken noodle soup.

I left out the carrots, and I added a full cup of cream of mushroom soup. Next time, I'll cook noodles separately and add in later. They were a little overdone. Overall, good tasting soup and ultimate comfort food.

Made this tonight for dinner and was a huge hit! Had great flavor. Perfect for the cold rainy night we had. I did change the setting to serve 9 even tho there was 4 of us. I wanted to make a big pot. Used a whole large pack of chicken breast and a whole bag of noodles. Didnt really measure anything. Just added till looked good. Smelled amazing while cooking also.

I made this per Brown Sugar Girls directions.  There were no measurements for the spices so I double what was in the original recipe.
Not sure what other mistakes I made but this was not good. There are to many good reviews so I know it must have been me.  Any suggestions?

Delicious and easy! I love this soup. I omitted celery as I don't care for the taste and added 1/4 teaspoon chicken bouillon. A crunchy toasted loaf of garlic bread and it's a perfect fast meal for a cold winter's day.

Yes, It was great, but I did not use the beef broth, I used the chicken stock from my boiled chicken, and one can of chicken store bought broth. It came out scrumptious.

Really easy and delicious! Really versatile recipe too. I added some green beans as I had some on hand that I had to get rid of. I also added some garlic powder and ginger powder for a little extra flavour (but I think it would've been fine without them anyway). I look forward to making this a lot this coming winter, thanks!

I've made this recipe at least a half a dozen times. I buy a rotisserie chicken and pick it apart and use that as the chicken and it gives a delicious flavor. This is my go to recipe when anyone is sick.

Amazing just as written. My kids love it! Made it for a January birthday party with cheesy french bread to dip in it and it was a huge success. It also freezes nicely. So i make a huge batch when we have it for dinner and freeze the rest in individual sizes. I take it out and microwave it for 3 minutes and have a fast easy lunch.

I have made this soup at least 3 times now over the past several months that's how much we love it! I purchase a rotisserie chicken cooked and ready to go from the grocery store.  Pull all the white meat from the chicken and throw it in...it's great! Very yummy and a wonderful meal when your feeling under the weather.

Yesterday when I made this for dinner I gave it 2 stars . I made it by cooking just 1 breast in the broth, shredding the chicken, and then adding everything until it was soft. Seemed logical. But it came out rather bland. Maybe I've been spoiled by my mom's soup. But this one didn't do it for me. I said I would not make again.
Now, the next day I am kicking this up to 3 stars and saying I will make again with the understanding that this is BASE soup. Next time I will use moister rotisserie chicken meat, brand name Swanson broth instead of generic, and add more spices and salt. 
I can only give this 3 stars as I don’t think the recipe is good enough “as is”.

A great way to improve on a basic broth.  The prep time took longer than the cooking itself.  I poached the bone in cornish hen in the broth after I added the veggies, which I cut more finely.  I would make this again.

I followed brown sugar girl's suggestions but instead of vegetable broth I added mushroom soup. I also added 1 small can of sliced mushrooms. I did use precooked whole chicken from the deli. This is a delicious soup. Quick for those on the go but by no means canned noodle soup. A must try for sure.

Loved this soup! I have five (semi picky) kids, all with different taste and food issues, but the one thing they agreed on was "keeping this recipe forever". It's not easy to impress them but they all loved this soup! For me, I loved how easy it was to make and how (by adjusting the serving size) I was able to make enough to have leftovers for two days! Yum!! I'll defiantly be making this again.

This was quick and easy for my sick husband! We used rotisserie chicken and my little boy loved tearing it apart to add to the pot--the dogs didn't mind the leftover chicken skins either. I added more egg noodles to the recipe since hubby doesn't like "soup". The extra noodles soaked up the broth.

I added two garlic cloves, minced, sautéed with onion, celery and carrots. Added the homemade chicken broth with some water added and salt & pepper. Chopped chicken and a small handful of wild rice too.

This was really good. Added garlic and doubled the basil and oregano. Also used whole wheat egg noodles and margarine to make it even healthier.

Excellent! I used Better Than Bouillon chicken base in place of the canned chicken broth. I also sauteed the carrots, onions and celery in butter with a little chicken base first.

Made this tonight and it was delicious! I think this will be my go to chicken soup recipe! Only changes I made was I omitted the veggie broth and celery, but only because I didn't have any and i didn't want to make a trip to the store. I served it with Jos Rosemary Bread from this site and it was a fabulous dinner for this cold, windy and snowy night.

This is a staple in my house.  I love it and so does my family.  Hearty and refreshing and even the leftovers are wonderful.  I make sure that I cook the noodles on the side and add individually to each bowl so that leftovers don't have soggy noodles.

What an easy recipe to put together!  I only made a couple of changes based on what I already had on-hand.   Instead of chicken I used leftover seasoned turkey breast from Thanksgiving.  Since I didn't have any vegetable broth, I substituted cream of chicken soup.   Such a wonderful flavor and my kids loved it!  I will definitely make again.

So easy to make , I will never make another recipe for chicken noodle soup. I recommend using the meat from
A Rotisserie chicken for the flavor. I also like to use the long flat noodles- fettucini? I also put in 1 packet of Lipton Chicken Noodle Soup- due to the flavoring.

We absolutely LOVED this soup! I made a few alterations but it was soooo yummy! This is what I did - instead of half a cup of onions I used about 5 tablespoons of onion powder. Also I bought boneless skinless chicken (1.23 lbs) and boiled it. I used a can of sliced carrots (3/4) and 5 cans of 10.5 oz chicken broth. No veggie broth. Yum yum yum! Ill definitely be making this more often! It's saved on my phone!

This was the first time I made homemade chicken noodle and it was so much better than the can! I used twice the amount of veggies and noodles and I think I'll put even more veggies in next time. I cooked the chicken in the broth for the 20 minutes. It definitely helped all of our sore throats.

I have been cooking for 60 years - this is one of the best quick recipes I've have come across - my son graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park NY - he gave this 5 stars- I use Knorr chicken cubes for this and every things else that calls for chicken broth - it is the best - Price Chopper charges about $1.59 for 8 cubes - the very so, expenses specialty store in my neighborhood charges $.99 (I hope  they don't  read this post)  GREAT SOUP - and
OH SO EASY.

This was very good and very easy. I used a rotisserie chicken and added 3 cloves of minced garlic, a tsp. of poultry seasoning, and a couple pinches of thyme. I also sautéed the carrots along with the onions, celery and garlic.  Instead of egg noodles, I made "Dumplings" from a recipe on this site. Turned out awesome. Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was amazing. I sautéed the onion, celery, and garlic cloves until tender. I love onions and garlic so I used a medium onion and 4 garlic cloves. I used all chicken broth. If you're using Swanson, I use reduced sodium. I added the carrots to 32 ozs of broth and boiled until tender (20 minutes). I then added meat from a whole rotisserie chicken, the remaining broth, the sautéed vegetables and the noodles to the pot and boiled until the noodles were tender. I added a little Zatarins creole seasoning for added flavor. Soooo good! I will never buy store bought soup again.

We have this at least twice a month and I am convinced it heals me when I'm sick. I strongly recommend you cook the chicken separately because it's just too hard and flavorless when boiled. Here's what I've found that really improves this recipe: Marinate 1 lb chicken in a little Worcestershire, then pressure cook it (or any way you have to make tender, juicy chicken). Saute a whole bag of carrots, 1 onion and 4-5 celery stalks. Give the carrots a head start. Add chopped garlic or garlic powder and other spices you like (we like thyme and pepper). Add broth, bring to a boil, cover and simmer 20 minutes. Then add the chicken. Also, it's very important to cook the egg noodles separate and keep them separate until serving your bowl or they get mushy. The best chicken soup!!

I made this recipe like a few other people, I added a tad garlic and sauteed the carrots along with the onion and celery.  I also added a bit of Tuscan Herb flavored Olive Oil that I love and the soup was THE BEST CHIX NOODLE SOUP I have ever had! Yum! I also used spaetzle noodles a few times just to make it different!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe! I follow the recipe almost exactly as written, EXCEPT I add two to three chopped garlic cloves. I also DO NOT add salt, as I feel the soup is salty enough from the five cans of broth. I sometimes add pepper, but not each time. I have made this soup several times. This recipe is a keeper!

With my slight modifications, I'm rating this a 5 star. I've never cooked chicken noodle soup in my life so I'm thankful for this recipe giving me a base to work with. I used 1 cup carrots, 1 cup onions, and 1 cup of celery. I followed other reviewer's advice and sauteed the veggies in garlic and butter. I added the broth. All chicken broth, cause that's all I had. I used 3 chicken breasts, cubed, and dumped that in the broth. Bring to a boil and then let it simmer for 30 minutes. Then I added the egg noodles for another 10 minutes at the end. Delicious!! A lot of the seasoning stuck to the chicken and gave it a lot of flavor. This soup definitely hit the spot. The entire family loved it!

I only review recipes that I like. Its that good!
I followed some tips from other reviewers, boiling the chicken breast in chicken broth oregeno poultry seasoning and basil, remove it cut/shred it and then replace. I did that early in the day or can be done the night before just cover the pot and store in the frig. You can also precook the chopped celery and carrots in melted butter and garlic. Throw them in the pot and store. Then when dinner time rolls around all you gotta do is cook your noodles, boil the soup and make whatever else. I asked my husband and three kids (7,11 and 9) what they thought. My 9 yr old exclaimed "you made this yourself?" (not from a can?!) the 11 yr old went for seconds and so did my husband. So all in all everybody ate it and didn't complain. I made biscuts with the soup, but I'm sure garlic bread, french bread or grilled cheese sandwiches would be great too.

Really good. You need to modify to suit your own tastes. I made mine really chunky and eyeballed everything. I also don't keep cans of chicken stock so I just used the chicken bouillon granules and replaced the vegetable broth with that. Everyone liked it. I went light on the salt and granules but I'll be more liberal next time b/c I ended up salting my soup and I never do that. That's not a knock on the recipe though. It's a very good base. I also used canned carrots b/c that's all I had but they were fine.

Fantastic!  I followed the recipe, leaving out the celery (because I despise it!) and substituting beef broth for the veggie broth (because I didn't' have it.)  It was delicious!  My husband loved it, too, and it's not common for him to remark about how good something is, but he did with this, several times!

Thank you so much for sharing!!! Super easy- super yummy! Added additional spices and veggies and boiled the chicken in a seperate pot with chicken bouillion cube/water to add flavor to chicken. For the actual recipe used chicken stock. My 18 month old ate a whole bowl! lol

I really liked this recipe because it was a good base to take your soup in whatever flavor direction that you like. I had homemade chicken stock that needed to be used, so I used a combination of that and store bought veggie stock. Followed directions almost exactly, but sauteed up the carrots with the other veggies with some minced garlic that also needed to be used up. Other than that didn't change a thing except for the herb/salt amounts to our preference. The results tasted like I had been making it all day. Great recipe.

This was a pretty good soup. Best of all, VERY EASY!! MY MODIFICATIONS: 1.) Added 2 cloves of minced garlic when sauteing the onions and celery. 2.) Used a whole rotisserie chicken from the Costco (and those bad boys are BIG) so roughly 1lb. of chicken in the end, 3.) Used 1c. of every vegetable, instead of the recommended 1/2 cup, 4.) Used nearly 1 tsp., instead of 1/2 tsp., of all of the spices called for in the recipe (minus the salt! which I always add sparingly). 5.) I also did NOT use low-sodium chicken broth, as I find that soups just don't have enough flavor when you use that. So I stuck with the regular stuff. 6.) And finally, I cooked the noodles on the side and then added them when the soup was finished simmering (about 2min before I dished it out into bowls). MY VERDICT: I'd definitely make this recipe again!! It's easy and you can pretty much throw whatever you want in here for a delicious and hearty meal.

This was so easy and delicious! I added some more carrots and celery just because I had them on hand and used all chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Thanks for a keeper. My whole family loved it.

This recipe is a good recipe to start with if you want to make chicken soup quickly or use up left over chicken. What's great about this is that I can double up on the vegetables without having to add additional stock or broth to it.

Aside from doubling the vegetables, I did make a few changes to fit our taste. I sauted the carrots with the onion and celery. I also added sliced fennel bulb. I also replaced the basil with thyme and also used parsley.

I made this recipe exactly how it says to and it was delicious! I would not change anything except maybe add an additional 1/2c of noodles. 5 stars because it is so good that my three year old ate two bowls then drank the broth and asked for a third!

Not bad (although my vote goes to Steve Grooms' chicken noodle soup). I've been battling a terrible head cold all weekend and my hubs thinks he might be catching what I have.... Chicken soup was exactly what we needed! While I appreciate how simple this was to prepare (especially considering I was too sick to cook), this just didn't cut it for us flavor-wise. I even added thyme, poultry seasoning, a bay leaf and some fresh minced garlic (which I sauteed with my onions / celery), hoping to impart a tad more flavor. Because I didn't have any cooked chicken handy, I purchased a rotisserie chicken instead. I tossed the ENTIRE bird (along with the pan juices) into my pot with everything else and simmered as directed. I then removed the carcass and added the shredded meat back to my soup. Even with these changes, my soup was still a bit on the bland side. :( NOTE: Boil your pasta SEPARATELY and add it to each bowl upon serving (this will prevent the pasta from swelling). For a quick fix, this is fine (this is definitely better than canned soup!), but I definitely won't be replacing my stand-by recipe with this one. Thanks anyways, MARYVM. :-)

I add brown basmati rice instead of noodles and double up on the celery and carrots as we like a thick soup.  One day I aadded a 1/2 container of deli tomato basil soup that I needed to use up.  Amazing!  Family thought they'd died and gone to heaven.

The BEST chicken noodle soup ever!  Made it for my 90-year old parents who are very fussy and they couldn't get enough!  Used a rotisserie chicken and spaghetti which I cut up in small pieces as they're easier for them to manage vs wide egg noodles which slip off the spoon.  Substituted parsley for the basil, left out the oregano and added a bay leaf.  Used Kitchen Basics brand for the broth which we like best and omitted the vegtable broth.  This is the ONLY chicken noodle soup recipe I will use from now on!

AMAZING!!!  It was quick and easy!  I had made a roasted chicken yesterday and made sure that I purchased one large enough so that I would have leftovers.  I had never made a soup before in my life and it was perfect!  I added some minced garlic to my onions and celery but that was it!

Delicious. I've never made Chicken Noodle Soup before and this was super easy. I picked up a chilled Lemon Pepper rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and just sliced up the breast. I didn't use onion but I did dash a little Garlic Salt in there and I didn't have the basil or oregano on their own so I just used a TSP of Italian seasoning. Not so much changes as they were substitutions and this was perfection. I would advise some more noodles though. I added about a cup of cheese tortellini to mine along with the egg noodles and still felt like it needed more. :P

I made this with whole wheat egg noodles, and I added half a 15 oz. can of pumpkin for body.  Really great recipe and so many ways to modify it!

I was looking for a homemade chicken noodle soup recipe and this one looked great.  The only change I made was I added cut spaghetti instead of the egg noodles, and I wasn't in a hurry so I simmered for several hours.  I didn't add the noodles until about six minutes until I was going to eat.  It is FANTASTIC!  Much better than I thought and I will not be eating canned/boxed chicken noodle soup again.

Such an easy recipe. I made a whole chicken in the crock pot a couple nights before and used the leftover chicken for the soup! This was a good recipe as-is but some people like to add. So, this can also be a good base recipe. This is a go-to recipe now!

I have made this recipe several times.  It's a keeper for sure!  The only thing I do differently is add some fresh minced garlic to the saute mixture.  I also tend to add more veggies than this recipe calls for.

Simple & Delicious Recipe. In order for it to be a meal, I doubled all the vegetables and kept the broth amount the same. In addition, instead of egg noodles I added 1 cup of barley, 1 zucchini chopped and a can of cannellini beans. Keepper!

Great recipe. Used a rotisserie chicken. This was fast, easy, delicious and impressed even my mother-in-law. I simmered all veggies in butter with crushed garlic cloves and threw in poultry seasoning. Perfect fall meal.

Super easy and delicious. I had all ingredients except basil and noodles so substituted fresh rosemary and leftover mushroom risotto. YU-UM. Just what my sick hubby wanted--and needed. I'll make extra next time and freeze it as some one else suggested. (4 stars only because I had to substitute ingredients.)

I made this soup last night and it was so good. I doubled the recipe because i love leftover soup. I did sautee the carrots with the onion and celery and also put some garlic in it. I cooked the noodles separate and then added them in and cooked for another 10 minutes. I did get some of those suggestions from other reviews. My husband and 3 and 7 year old daughters loved it. Def. will be making this alot this winter. Thanks for sharing.

My family swears by this recipe when they are sick!! My husband goes on and on about how much he LOOOOVES this soup (thank you SOOOO much for posting this!!)
The only thing I do differently is add to the noodles -a heaping 2 cups- and add a few different spices -little bit of garlic powder, and some Newfoundland Savory sent by my Aunt.
This soup is a big hit in my house and I have already included it in 2 cookbooks I gave as gifts when my cousins got married!

Excellent!!! My boyfriend was feeling a bit under the weather & had a bunch of rotisserie chicken leftover, that he was complaining was going to go to waste, so I was looking for a quick and easy soup recipe to kill 2 birds with 1 stone and fix him some soup to make him feel better and use the chicken and I FOUND it!  This was great!  I also added a clove of garlic and I also sauteed the celery and carrots in the butter with the onion and garlic. I also used more chicken & noodles than called for, as he wanted a chunkier soup. He loved it & I think he'll deliberately buy too much rotisserie chicken in the future, just so he can have this soup, again!

Really yummy and very easy!  I followed the recipe but did add 64 ounces of chicken broth because that's what I had (and I found it wasn't too much).  I did add a bit of sea salt as my husband likes this soup salty (yep, ruined by years of salty canned soup!...which no more canned for us...).  Delish!  I also added bow tie noodles which I love in chicken noodle.  I cooked the noodles separately as advised and froze half the recipe without the noodles and put the cooked noodles in the soup I saved for us to eat tonight.  I will be making this a lot.

Very good basic recipe when you don't have a lot of ingredients or don't want to get a bunch of exotic ingredients.  Makes up really quick, and it's great to be able to have homemade soup on a dreary day when you're feeling less than stellar.

I made this dinner tonight and my husband and 7 year old twins loved it.  Very quick and easy. Amazed that a soup could comeout so good with canned broth and in about 30 mins.  I will be making this again but will double the recipe for leftovers!

Yummy. I had the flu so I made this recipe. The only changes was I added garlic and doubled the chicken and noodles. The chicken wasn't cooked, I just put it in raw.

Very easy and delicious too. I used boneless skinless thighs though because that's what I had on hand (plus I think it stays moist and adds flavor, IMO) and didn't use vegetable broth as I didn't have any on hand. I added a little bit of diced sweet potato and a handful of peas to get in more veggies (mostly for my toddler) and instead of using the dried herbs, salt and pepper, I used salt free 21 Seasoning Salute from Trader Joe's since it has tons of flavor and there's enough sodium in the chicken broth. Yum!

I am 73 years old and have made every kind of chicken soup one could imagine but this is the best yet!  The only thing I changed was to cut up the chicken and throw it in uncooked.  I probably used a pound.  It was wonderful.  This is the only way I will make Chicken Noodle Soup hereafter.  Made it for my husband who was suffering from a very bad cold and it was a real help.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.  Wouldn't change an ingredient!  Would give it 10 stars if I could!

Phenomenal soup!  I'm a personal trainer and nutritionist so I went ahead and tripled up on the veggies.  To boost the healthful side of the soup I added 4 cloves minced garlic (sauteed with the veggies prior to adding the broth and spices), instead of butter I used 2 tablespoons olive oil, store bought rotisserie chicken (skin removed), and substituted egg noodles for whole grain penne pasta.  AHmazing!  If you like spicy, try a drizzle of Siracha.  Sounds funny, but it really makes the soup pop with a smidge of heat.

Absolutely the best chicken soup I hav made EVER!!   I think it is the basil and oregano mix that adds a great level of flavor.  I used lots of veggies, including leeks and 4 cloves garlic--I love the sauteed veggie flavor it adds too.  Then I added 2 cartons of chicken broth and egg noodles.  Simply fantastic chicken soup flavor.  I highly recommend this and I will make this often any time of year!!

Great recipe. I did not have celery but added lots of fresh chopped flat leaf parsley near the end and also added a few handfuls of sliced white mushrooms. It was a hit!

Absolutely my favorite 'homemade' chicken noodle soup! I've made this over a dozen times already and will never look for a new recipe. This is better than ANY chicken soup I've tried to make using a whole chicken from scratch. (1) I use Costco's rotisserie chicken and pull it apart while it's perfectly warm; that makes it so easy to get the perfect sized larger chunks of chicken like I love in homemade soup. My kids always love it. (2) I like to double the recipe and use ONE WHOLE rotisserie; that seems to be the perfect proportion of all ingredients to me. (3) I also use only chicken broth (no veggie broths) just because that's what I always stock in my pantry. (4) And I've discovered that the only noodles that do the trick and hold up in leftovers are the original Anthony's Extra Wide Egg Noodles.

I made this for my sick boyfriend and liked it just as much as he did! He has bronchitis and his throat hurts too much to even drink water but he said this didn't hurt at all going down.  The recipe made enough for our dinner and for at least 3 more meals for the sick kid.

But anyway, I made a few modifications.  I am allergic to a lot of vegetables so I used 5 cans of chicken broth instead of using 1 can of vegetable broth.  Also, I replaced the carrots with potatoes (two small potatoes).  I just cut them up small and threw them in to the pot before bringing it to a boil and they were perfectly mushy at the end of the 20 minutes.

I added more basil and oregano than the recipe called for (probably 2 tsps of each) because I like a lot of flavor.

I added the egg noodles before bringing the broth to a boil but next time I will probably wait to add the noodles until after it boils because they were a bit too mushy at the end.  

I didn't add any salt "to taste" because the broth made this salty enough.  Not too salty though!

This is a fantastic recipe and going in my favorites for sure!

This is the best chicken noodle soup recipe!  I have tried several other recipes that I didn't like that much.  I added garlic to the onion/celery/carrot mix.  I also added a dash of thyme and about half a teaspoon of parsley with the other herbs.  I let the soup (minus the noodles) simmer for several hours then cooked up the noodles and added them right before serving.  I served the soup with some homemade french bread.  It is a great soup recipe for when you're sick (which my daughter was) or for a cold day meal...thank you for an excellent recipe!

Love this. So simple and easy.. Boyfriend and friends loved it and I'm about to make it for easter for my family. I enjoy making this meal!
I put some fresh mushroom bits in mine, and I didn't have veggie broth, so I had to 'double up' on the chicken (I cant imagine how much better it would taste with the veggie broth helping out, but ya gotta do what ya gotta do sometimes). 
It hit the spot wonderfully.

I made this for a church dinner and it was GREAT!!  I let it simmer for about 4 or more hours and then put the noodles in at the very end.  I think that cooking it that long helps the flavors meld together.  I used mini bow tie noodles - you can use any noodles and these were fun.  Great recipe!

This was great!!  My only complaint is that the noodles cooked much faster than the veggies took to get to the right tenderness, so next time I would put the noodles in after about 10 minutes of simmering.  
I diced raw chicken and sauteed it before adding in the celery and onions which worked really well all in the same pot.  I also increased the amount of veggies and noodles to make it heartier.  All in all it was great!

A great meal for families on the go.  I have made this twice now, once quickly on the stove and once all day in a crock pot and enjoyed it both times.  I like it more like stew so I add a whole pre-cooked chicken and lots of veggies (green beans and peas work well too).  My only recommendation is to use at least some unsalted broth with the pre-cooked chicken or it comes out pretty salty.  Thanks for the recipe!

Vegetarian style! Used Chicken style Seitan and Vegetarian chicken broth, added a touch of thyme, and used olive oil instead of butter. Was delicious thank you!

This is the first time I have made my own homemade soup.  It came out perfect. I just adjusted the servings to 3 and it still came out perfect.  Thanks!

I'd never made chicken noodle soup before and was a little concerned about putting in basil and oregano---but it is soooooo fantastic.  I will definitely make this again--I made no substitutions!

This soup was out of this world!  I will no longer ever buy canned soup!!  

I boiled Amish Egg noodles in the broth and then added the cooked veggies, chicken, and spices.  I also used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  Could not have been easier!  Thank you for the recipe.

So easy & yummy. Experimented with using canned chicken - not so tasty. Better to use the Kirkland flash frozen, no defrost boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I followed the pkge directions to cook those chicken thighs, cooled it and then cubed to add to the soup. Better to cook everything except the noodles first. I added a mix of cut spaghetti & mini farfalle noodles towards the last 20 min of cooking. Cut the carrots & celery smaller to appeal to the younger kids. Tasted great!

I can't tell you how much this makes my boyfriend feel better when I make this for him whenever he's sick. He absolutely HATES veggies, but in this recipe, he gobbles them all right up! Even the carrots! Thank you so much for this recipe. I've been needing to get him to eat healthier, and now I know how to do it. :) I added garlic salt, poultry seasoning, and dried thyme like Brown Sugar Girl suggested, and my my, the thyme just adds the most perfect flavor to it! I also cooked the carrot in the butter too, as I find it makes them more tender, which my boyfriend loves. I also didn't have any vegetable stock on hand, so I had to use all chicken stock. But it still tasted superb! The best chicken noodle soup I've ever tasted!

Soup is very easy and quick to make.  Had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to taste.  Not one that I will make often, but one to keep on hand for those really busy (and cold) nights.

Made with half chicken stock and half turkey stock (all I had on hand) and it turned out great!  Used an entire package of spaghetti noodles too since my 3 y/o can eat it better.  Love the basil in this.  Very easy and very happy!

Excellent, fast and easy.   CHANGES I MADE : I didn't have any broth so I added 2 chicken bouillon cubes and one veggie bouillon cube to the noodles while I precooked them. I did not drain the noodles, I poured in the water and noodles into the saute pot. I added a can of chicken breast meat due to ease and I was out of chicken breasts.. also I followed other reviewers suggestions to saute garlic, celery, onions and carrots, I did this while boiling the noodles poured it all together added spices and voila! Done so fast and it tasted like it had cooked all day. YUM

This was really good.  Hubby was sick and I felt the need to make him soup.  So I pretty much followed the recipe but increased veggies and noodles a little as did others.  Gave it to him in a bowl without really tasting it and he loved it! Nuff said! Thanks.

I made this for my boyfriend and his family a couple of days ago and and they all had seond helpings!  I didn't have any dried basil so I used Italian seasoning instead.  I'm not a big fan of egg noodles, so i used baby shells instead.  Will definitely make this again!

I made this for my sick boyfriend and it was delicious and soothing!  A few changes...I did not cook the veggies in butter to make it healthier, plus some people posted how mushy everything got.  I just cooked some chicken tenders in 2 cans of the chicken broth, added the seasoning at this point...then cut the veggies up while it was cooking.  Then I added the veggies and noodles and shredded the chicken (the chicken tasted great after cooking in the broth and seasonings).  Cooked on medium for 20 mins and everything was perfect!

I made this for dinner tonight with some leftover roasted chicken breast and it was excellent. I did not use the vegetable broth, just the 4 cans of chicken broth. I used 8 oz of frozen noodles instead of the egg noodles and they cooked up great in 20 -25 mins. in the soup. I also followed other reviewers suggestions and sautéed the carrots along with the other vegetables and added 1 clove of minced garlic. I had some fresh parsley and rosemary and I added a bit of both just before serving. Truly a great and easy soup.

This is delicious! I'm pregnant and craving all things spicy, so I added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp of ground ginger and 2 chopped scallions. It gives it quite the kick!

I do a lot of cooking and had never tried chicken noodle soup.  I followed the advice of the other reviews and sauteed the carrots, celery, onion together with some minced garlic and butter. Then i added the already cooked chicken and mixed it in for some flavor then added the broth. I didn't want soggy noodles so I cooked them separately and put them to the side, but still was stupid and put them in with the broth for 10 minutes or more before serving and they were soggy anyways...ha ha. I also felt like it needed more salt...so I gave it a 3 for now. I am trying it again next week with more salt...maybe some boullon and probably more garlic and I'll see if I like it better. The way I made it, it was just ok...

Great recipe!  I made it twice within the first week and I know I will make this recipe many times to come!  Everyone who tried the soup loved it!  I made few changes...I added garlic and carrots to the onions/celery mixture after reading the reviews of others.  Thanks for the recipe!

i only used Better Than Bullion chicken base and this Sazon vegetable seasoning and used the correct amount for water and this still came out good. i cooked my chicken breast with salt, pepper, italian seasoning and paprika and it gave it a little kick. soooooo good and very simple to make. :))

my husband said this is the best soup he'd ever tasted! I did as others suggested and put the carrots in with the celery and onion at the start and added three cloves of crushed garlic. It was amazing! I already had a whole chicken cooked, so I shredded a lot of it (3 cups worth) and used that instead of just chopping up chicken breasts. It was super yummy!

Followed others' recommendations and did the following - sauteed garlic, onion, celery and carrots in butter. Only then did I add the rest of the ingredients in the pot (except the noodles) and brought to a boil, covered and simmered 20 min. Cooked up the egg noodles separately then added to the pot (after draining)- simmered an additional 10 min. I had also added 1 can of cream of chicken soup to add some creaminess. Among the best chicken noodle soups we've ever had.

True to it's name...quick and easy!  It's also very delicious and loved by my very picky 7 year old.  She requests this all the time.  I usually use more veggies, and saute them all along with the onion.  I also use a purchased rotisserie chicken which makes this really easy to throw together.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I had a cold and don't like eating canned soups when I can avoid it. I made this, and it was very comforting and easy to eat. I didn't have any celery and used 1/3 tsp celery salt rather than fresh celery. It came out good still. Next time I would definitely use fresh celery and add about 1 tsp salt. I also pre-cooked the chicken, and I thought it was unnecessary. Throwing the raw cubed chicken in with the rest of the broth would have been just as good.

This soup is great for a quick meal!  I have been making a similar recipe for years.  I doubled the veggies and sauteed all veggies with margerine and 3 coves of garlic.  I cooked the chicken in the broth which I also put a can of low fat cream of chicken.  I used no yolk noodles and put the cooked noodles in the last 10 minutes of simmering.  I added rosemary, thyme, oregano, italian seasoning, pepper, and garlic salt.  Yum!

This recipe really is easy and it tasted fantastic!  I used the suggestion by others of just de-boning a rotersserie chicken and adding fresh garlic to the sauteed veggies.  My 3 year old and 1 year old loved it (and that is rare indeed).

Great recipe! I made my noodles from scratch (I love chunky noodles). Also I put this over a scoop of mashed red potatoes. It sounds weird but it is amazing! It gives the soup a great hearty homemade taste.

excellent results. The only adjustment I made came from other reviews: I put the carrots in with the onion and celery. Plus I used larger quantities than the recipe calls for. Clearly, this is a recipe that can be personalized in so many ways. We loved it! My wife is even going to have seconds, which is almost unheard of for her.

Everyone liked this easy to make soup. Make sure if you're going to store it in the fridge you have some extra broth on hand as the noodles absorb the broth and make the soup very thick. Thanks!

This is so far my favorite of the chicken noodle soups!  I did saute the carrots with the onion and celery, and I was a little heavy handed with the basil, probably adding double the amount called for but this was still great!  I made it for my daughters 5th birthday dinner (she loves noodle soups), and she loved it too!  Thanks!!!

This was tasty.  The family loved it.  I used all chicken broth because I didn't have vegetable broth.  I too sauteed my carrots with the onion and celery and added garlic.

I tried this recipe in a pinch and it was just okay.  I followed it exactly and it ended up just bland and boring (which is fine if you're needing chicken soup for a cold) but otherwise I won't be making it again.

The taste of the soup base is delicious. I added more vegetables to suit my family's taste without compromising the broth. Hands down the best homemade chicken noodle soup!

Yum!  And sooo much better the next day!  I did add some garlic with the onions, celery, and carrots and some frozen peas in the last couple of minutes.  Otherwise followed this recipe to a tee.  So good!

This is a great simple recipe for a healthy and tasteful soup! My only change is adding a garlic clove in with the onion and saute. I also doubled the celery and carrot as I like the vegetables. It is great with canned broth and even better with homemade broth. Just stick some chicken bones in the crockpot with onion, garlic, seasonings, carrots, celery and parsley. Cook for 8 hours and strain. Either way is still yummy. My kids absolutely love it!

My Mother in law cant get enough of this.  Everytime I ask her if she needs anything she says "Yes more chicken noodle soup"  The only think different I do is put in MORE carrots and celery, cuz you cant get enough veggies.  I also put more vegetable broth and less chicken broth, a matter of taste I suppose.  And its so easy! But doesnt taste like it is.

Incredible flavor especially for a cold winter's day & flexible enough to personally tweak!! Very easy though I simmered mine for a couple hours (the house smelled wonderful). I sautéed onions, celery & a clove of garlic in olive oil, then added the cooked chicken. I dumped this in the soup stock pot with the broth (definitely include the can of vegetable broth)& added the suggested seasonings plus a pinch of poultry seasoning & tarragon. Next, I sautéed the carrots until tender & added them.  About 30 minutes before serving, I added the pasta. Next time I'll try this with whole wheat pasta  --I'll bet it would be delicious!  Thanks for sharing an excellent recipe.

This was a great basic chicken noodle soup recipe. I sauteed the carrots right along with the onion and celery, and added some minced garlic as well. Used a can of chunk chicken that I shredded and about a half a bag of whole wheat egg noodles. Added a bay leaf and some poultry seasoning. Next time I will back off on the basil and oregano and add some sage instead. Also I used a low sodium chicken broth which I wasn't a fan of, so next time I will use regular.

Very good.  I am not the biggest fan of chicken noodle soup.  I prefer creamy chowders and chili over it, however, I made this today for some family who are at home/sick with the cold and flu and it was a hit.  I added a can of cream of chicken soup for creaminess.

first tried this recipe last year with leftover thanksgiving turkey.  The recipe was so great that even the non soup eaters enjoyed it. So now this recipe is apart of my fall/winter recipes.

Delicious - instead of using oregano and basil I just used 1 tsp of Italian seasoning.  My only thing is next time I will add more carrots (personal preference). Otherwise it's a keeper!!!

This is super easy and super good.  I use one whole chopped onion and add lots of extra carrots to make the soup heartier.  Make sure you use the veggie broth as it really enhances the flavor -- to me it makes it taste more authentic and scratch, rather than a quick recipe.  I also just add 2 whole boneless chicken breasts with 10 minutes left and simmer about 10 minutes until the chicken shreds easily between 2 forks.  Finally, a tsp of thyme or curry powder depending on the mood is a nice add

Just as it says - Quick and Easy! I love this recipe for when someone in the house is sick and needs some chicken noodle soup (especially if it's me). The only thing I do different is use only chicken broth and one can of water vs. a can of vegetable broth because I never have any. Grab a rotisserie chicken and throw this together - whoever is needing some chicken noodle soup will thank you.

Extremely hearty and delicious. I made this in my slow cooker! I also added stewed tomatoes and added the noodles later so they wouldn't fall apart in the slow cooker!

This was fantastic! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand plus I needed it to be gluten free. For the chicken I cooked chicken breasts in a crock pot with salt/fresh cracked pepper/poultry seasoning/couple whole cloves and a couple bay leaves. I left it to cool over night in the fridge in the pot which makes the breast really tender. (I did up a large pot full for a number of meals) I used Earth Balance margarine since we can't do dairy. I didn't have chicken or veggie broth so I used the broth from the crock pot after it had separated. I added 2-3 times the basil and oregano called for and for the noodles I used Trader Joes Rice Sticks traditional Thai style pasta broken into pieces about 1 inch each. It came out perfect and even my super picky child liked it.

My family loved this.  Picky toddlers and hubby cleaned their bowls!  I would keep up with the suggestion that you boil the noodles seperately from the soup until a few minutes to being done.  I did it this suggested way and it was not starchy at all.

Very good! My family loves soup, I make it all the time.  My son said it was the best soup he ever tasted.  I did add the garlic, parsley,and poultry seasoning.  Kept adding as needed to our taste buds.  I used egg noodles, and put in the chicken raw to cook in the stock. Can't go wrong with this one. As with every recipe take your own creative juices and run with them, if it is too bland for your taste buds just add more seasoning.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Seriously, very good! The only thing I changed was adding a tablespoon of Vegeta Soup and Seasoning Mix in place of the basil and oregano. My 15 month old said "mmm" after every bite, my four year old picky eater ate the whole bowl, and my husband had seconds. A big hit in this house! Thanks!

Very good.  I made this soup with Garlic Cheddar Biscuits on the side, it made the perfect match.

Cook the noodles first and then put them in the soup. I didn't do this (ignored other reviews) and the soup had a definate starchy taste to it. I ended up adding a little tarrogon to cover up the taste. Will make again but with the above change.

So simple, so quick and so fabulous!  (I did add a little garlic to the onions and celery, just a personal preference - I find it hard to cook anything without it...LOL)  This is definitely a keeper!  Thank you... (Had a feeling 689 great reviews was the way to go ;-)

This was simple and filling.  I made it exactly as written using leftover chicken from the slow cooker baked chicken from this site.  We'll definately be making this again.

This is a great recipe!  I followed the advice of another review and cooked the noodles separately to cut down on starch.  Next time I'll add more noodles (maybe 2 or even 2 1/2 cups instead of just a cup and a half) because they were so good!  I also left out the celery because my husband isnt a fan - didnt make a difference -it was DELICIOUS! this is a KEEPER!

This is an awesome recipe and I did make changes - but very minor!  I sauteed the onions, celery, carrots and 2 cloves of garlic in the butter.  Then I added the chicken stock - low sodium. Then I threw in an entire rotisserie chicken and let it simmer for 20 minutes or so.  I added the basil, oregano and salt and pepper.  Then I removed the chicken and then added the chicken pieces back in - threw out the bones etc.  After simmering for a little bit longer I added the egg noodles to the soup and turned up the heat to a boil.  My husband who is pretty darn picky LOVED this chicken noodle soup!  I love a one pot meal and this was delish - next time I will definitely add vegetable broth as I think that will make it even better!!

This soup was a BIG hit! It was easy and delicious. Using what I had on hand, I mixed both, cans of broth and bouillon cubes w/water. Sauted the veggies with butter and garlic then added everything to the pot to simmer for a couple hours (wanted the flavors to really come together). Cooked and added noodles the last few minutes; served. Everyone loved it!!

This is so easy and delicious! Nice that it's not completely from scratch but still homemade so it nothing like a can. Great for mom's who don't have time to spend all day making a completely from scratch soup. I used bouillon cubes instead of canned broth and it was great. Loved this during the cold winter months.

Wow! I had some leftover grilled chicken from dinner and felt bad throwing it away so decided to make soup but wanted something fast.  This honestly couldn't get any easier and it tastes like it took a lot of work!  I used fresh basil and parsley (didn't have oregano) from the garden and omitted the onion cause I didn't have any (threw in a little onion powder).  Used whole wheat noodles rather than egg noodles.  Definitely a keeper!

i love this recipe. it was very easy to make. the only thing i did different was boil the cubed chicken in water until it was done and then i took a potato smasher to it to shred it up. i used whole wheat pasta and doubled up on everything but the broth. it was amazing! i served this with the herb biscuits from this site. for sure a keeper.

This was very easy -- what I pictured making Chicken Noodle Soup would be like. I really enjoyed making this and will definitely use this recipe again.  It's classic, basically foolproof, and everyone likes it :)  I used olive oil instead of the butter (I will probably use butter next time, just to see if there's a difference) and also added one bay leaf for the last couple minutes of cooking.  I didn't leave the leaf in there for too long because the kitchen started to smell like corned beef :P I took it out just in time.

Good stuff!!!  I tweaked it a little-bit by using rotisserie chicken that I bought from the deli at my local grocery store.  I also add a large can of cream of chicken soup, a few cubes of chicken bouillon, Accent seasoning, poultry seasoning, thyme, bay leaves (filter thru a tea bag), onion powder, minced garlic & chopped red bell pepper which I sauteed with the celery and onion.  I chose to use frozen mixed veg. which had carrots in the bag of course and I added them about 10 minutes after adding the broth to the onion, red bell pepper, & minced garlic. I added the noodles about 5 minutes before it was done to keep them from being overcooked.  It turned out great!!!

This is really good, but the recipe as written has at least one can too much broth.  We added extra veggies, chicken, and noodles.  I also added a dash each of thyme, parsley, and rosemary.  Turned out very good and was easy to make.

Great recipe and perfect cold remedy.  Everyone is under the weather at home and this soup brought us all the comfort we needed.  I did substitute the noodles for a handful of small shell pasta and added an additional handful of chopped green beans in addition to the carrots and celery.  I also added a minced clove of garlic to the onion when I sauted it.  I only eat my mom's chicken soup because I never found any that measure up to her recipe.  Well, if she didn't agree with me I would feel guilty saying this but this is my new favorite chicken soup recipe!

I followed the directions and added the noodles, chicken, and broth all at once and ended up with a very tasty soup with really soggy, mushy noodles. (I also think I added to many.) So I fished the noodles out and remade the them separately as suggested by others, and then added them in. YUM! I can't believe how delicious it is, and I'm so proud of myself for making it. Thanks!

I made several adjustments to this recipes, hence the 4 star rating. I used an entire 48oz box of Swanson's MSG free low sodium chicken broth, and 2 Herb-ox msg free chicken boullion and 4 cups of water. I sauted the onions, celery, and carrots in some olive oil rather than the butter. I used a rotisserie chicken and picked off all the meat (except the breasts, I saved them for another meal this week) and just dumped that into the pot with the veggies and the broth. I let it come to a boil then let it simmer for about an hour. I didn't have whole bay leaves so I used someone else's tip from A/R and emptied a tea bag and added my bay leaf pieces and let that stew with everything. I removed it right before serving. I used egg noodles and cooked them in a seperate pot so they wouldn't get all soggy. I can't wait for leftovers for lunch and dinner!! Even the sick DBF liked it, though he only ate a few bites he said it was good. I didn't add any other spices except for the bay leaves. No salt, or pepper or the other spices the recipe called for. Didn't want DBF to not eat it because it was too spiced up.

You really need to increase the amounts of veggies, noodles and chicken with this amount of broth unless you like a very thin soup. It was easily the best soup I've ever eaten! Served with pepperoni bread from this site for a quick (okay, not so quick re amount of chopping. 10 minutes? Not this kid..)delicious and filling meal 29/3/09 I froze half the soup, egg noodles and all and it was just as good as fresh. Noodles retained their shape and firmness.

I used this recipe as a base recipe for this: I bought a greek flavored rotisserie chicken, took all the meat off the bones, and then made a stock out of the bones by simmering them in water for about 30-45 minutes. I used all the meat in the soup, and also added a generous pinch of marjoram to compliment the generous pinches of oregano and basil. I don't really closely measure ingredients for soups (obviously), so I ended up using about 3 stocks of celery, 1/2 of a big yellow onion, maybe 1-1 1/2 cups chopped carrots, and 3-4 cloves chopped garlic. I didn't add noodles this time, but may in the future. I would agree that the vegetable broth is KEY. I will make this again and again!!

This was good even after I messed it up. I was wanting to put just a sprinkle of marjoram in, but ended up "dumping" instead of "sprinkling". The taste overpowered it, but we ate through it and enjoyed the soup. I didn't change anything else (except added a bay leaf) and wish I wouldn't of tried, because I know the soup is fabulous as is. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was a big hit with my entire family and in-laws. I rarely make soups because they're not well-liked, but this devoured! The kids even argued over who got to take the leftovers to school in the thermos!

This was the best homeade chicken noodle soup I've ever had. I made this in a rice cooker, and it lasted all day on the "warm" setting and just got better and better! Be mindful not to leave the noodles in all day, they get mushy. I'd like to try this with homeade egg noodles someday.

This is a great chicken soup!  My husband and I loved it!  Easy, quick & delicious.....will definitely make again.  The only change I made was simmering the broth, vegetables, spices & chicken a bit longer...like an hour, then I added the egg noodles the last 15 mintues.  It was great.

I made this soup over the weekend it was super easy and my husband and 13 year old son loved it (so did I).  I did modify the soup based on some of the other reviews though.  This is what I did to make it my own.  I used 2-32 ounce cans of chicken stock and 1-32 ounce can of vegetable stock.  I also used a whole bag of celery hearts and one pound of carrots (we like a lot of veggies), I also added about 6 small potatoes cubed.  I too used a whole rotissarie chicken, skinned it and de-boned it.  I skipped the oregeno but added the basil, pepper and garlic salt (no regular salt).  I used about a half of stick of butter and sauted all of my veggies in a big pot and when I thought they were getting somewhat soft, I added them to broth with the chicken and let that go for about 30 minutes.  The veggies got nice and soft.  I cooked my pasta on the side and did not add to the soup.  The longest part of the entire soup was the chopping of the veggies.  This was so easy and delicious!  Enjoy.

Great soup.  Added egg noodles at the end so they wouldn't get mushy.  Will make another double batch and freeze without the pasta.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not a big fan of canned soups but dislike making homemade soup because it can be very time consuming. This recipe is not only super easy but also super tasty!! I used 1 32-ounce box of College Inn Rotisserie Chicken Broth.  In addition to the ingredients listed, I added a pinch each of white & black pepper, 1 tsp thyme, a couple pinches of poultry seasoning and some parsley flakes. Instead of egg noodles, I used 1/4 c. of pastina which are teeny-tiny pasta stars. I used Perdue Short Cuts grilled chicken which is super easy because the chicken is precooked/sliced.  All you have to do is dice it up into small pieces and throw it into the broth. This recipe rocks!!!

Unvelievable!  This is truly delicious and tastes like it would take hours to make.  I used reduced sodium chicken broth and did not use the vegetable broth at all and it turned out fabulous.

This soup was really easy to make. It did take some time to put together (cooking the chicken, peeling/cutting carrots, celery, onions etc) but it was all simple. I put it more noodles than the recipe called for because I needed to stretch it a little bit. It tasted great and I wouldn't change anything next time.

This soup was very good and very easy.  I cooked in on low in the crock pot for 4 hours without the noodles.  I did not have vegetable stock so I used all chicken stock but put a cube of vegetable boulion which gave it a nice taste.  Since I doubled the recipe to freeze half I cooked the noodles separately and added them to the bowls as I served.  Delicious.

Have been meaning to come on and review this since it is THE BEST chicken noodle soup EVER!!  I make it all the time, use a rotisserie chicken & it's so easy!!  The only thing I change is add a Knorr's chicken boullion cube (they are double strength). The vegetable broth is what makes it so good - have used a similar recipe w/o the veggie broth & something was just missing....this one is perfect every time!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a delicious, easy recipe. I used light butter instead of regular, and you couldn't tell a difference. I also added some garlic powder and extra basil and oregano (I love my spices!), which tasted great. 

I used cubed chicken breast, which I cooked in the broth. This made the soup a little cloudy, but I didn't care - it still tasted wonderful and made great leftovers! I also used whole wheat egg noodles - I felt really great about making such a tasty, yet nutritious soup for my family.

This is very good for an almost-scratch soup. I made it because my son and husband were sick with chest colds. For 6 servings, I added 3 eggs at the end of cooking, so it was kind of a cross between chicken noodle and egg drop soup (just a preference of my husband's).

This was absolutely delicious! My first attempt at chicken noodle soup and I couldn't have been happier with the outcome. My hubby was sick over the weekend so I decided to make some soup to help him feel better and boy did he! Though silly me forgot to put in the noodles the first time..oops! But I just cooked them separately and added them for the 2nd helping. I will definitely be making this again, especially since its winter now. Thanks for a great recipe!

One of my children ate it without broth; the other three either picked at it or didn't even touch it. My parents seemed to like it. I thought the taste was so-so. I think I used a bad brand of egg noodles or something, because I put them in when the recipe indicated and they turned into a nasty goop. When I stirred the soup, it looked like cream of chicken soup, but it had egg noodle goo in the bottom.

I made this for myself when I had a sore throat. It was amazing! I used my left over chicken in the fridge. I froze the leftovers, however, followed other recommendations and made sure that there was not an over abundance of noodles when doing so. I will definitely make this again and again.

I used fresh-frozen egg noodles, ommitted the oregano, added 1 Tablespoon parsley, and increased the basil to about 1-1/2 Tablespoons.  I also added a package of sliced fresh mushrooms, and several shakes of garlic salt - it drew raves from my dinner party!

Just perfect!  Doubled the carrot, celery and spices.  Also added in a few dashes of garlic powder, couple cloves of minced garlic (sauteed with celery and onions), oregano and thyme.  SO quick (as it says) and there's really nothing extra to clean up!

when i make soup, i like to make LOADS and i like my soup super chunky!  So i used this recipe as a guide.  I sauteed one and a half medium chopped onion and a couple cloves of garlic.  Used two whole celery hearts, a whole bag of carrots, two thirty-something ounce boxes of chicken broth and one thirty-something ounce veg. broth, a whole rotisserie chicken hand shredded and almost a whole bag of egg noodles.  Seasoned as suggested in the recipe.  Sounds like a lot but it made a super hearty soup that lasted me, my sister, and boyfriend DAYS!! Really yummy and great for a cold day. definitely a keeper, thanks!

This was suprisingly good for how easy it was.  I had some leftover chicken from roasting one the night before, so I used that.  Also I did not have an onion so I threw in a few shallots instead.  Try this...you will like it!

This recipe was so easy and very delicious. I added egg noodles near the end. Scrumptious right off the stove and also great leftover!

Good thing I doubled the recipe!  Followed others suggestions to saute veges first and cook pasta separate (as well as store for leftovers)-very good call.  No other modifications.  It's fabulous.  Tastes good with parmesan cheese, too.

Tastes great, and easy, easy, easy. I used low sodium broth and omitted the salt.  Made up for it by adding a little soy sauce to individual servings.  Gives it just the right amount of flavor.

This was such a yummy recipe! I used leftover rotisserie chicken and put all the ingredients together in my slow cooker (except the noodles). I let it cook on low all day and added wide egg noodles about 30 minutes before I wanted to serve it. Super easy. Definitely a keeper

This is a very good recipe, I used a rotisserre chicken purchased from my local grocery and it turned out great. This was the first time every that I was happy with my homemade soup! We ate it with some nice artisan bread the first night and had it for lunch again a few days later, it was even better then. Give this recipe a try!

Really easy and very good!!  I bought 2 chicken breasts on the bone and boiled them for 20 min then shredded the meat and added it to the soup.  I also added 1 tsp of minced garlic.  Boyfriend had a cold and thought this soup was really good!!

Yum! Yum!  I added more broth as suggested by others.  I also added garlic.  I didn't have any left over chicken so I used roasted chicken from the store.  This soup is super easy and tastes really good.  It tastes just like homemade in half the time.

This soup is amazing!  I did alter it a little with using peas and corn insead of carrots and celery; and I took some reviewers advice and sauteed the veggies with garlic as well as doubling the noodles and chicken.  This was by far the best chicken noodle soup I've ever eatten - I could never get store bought again!  The broth combo must make this - it's fantastic!

Good easy recipe. I changes seasonings to fit my taste though. I used rosemary, thyme and oregano. Added garlic and onion whole to broth along with celery leaves so the could be fished out. Also used rotini for the pasta and it was very good indeed. And no butter.

I thought this tasted 4 star, my husband 5 star. It's very easy to make. I cooked my chicken almost all the way through before putting it in the pot. I cooked my onions and carrots with some garlic and ginger as well as the butter. I had no celery. I was short on chicken broth, so I had to use chicken bullion cubes. They worked as a nice substitute. Don't skimp on the chicken broth, cause that will make a difference in how the soup tastes.

I don't care much for soup but this was quick and easy. The flavor has much to do with what kind of broth you use. Also I would recommend shredding the chicken instead of chopping it. It seems to be much more appealing.

My husband and I made this soup for dinner tonight and it was fantastic!  We used a rotisserie chicken, which made the recipe even easier to make, and instead of using 4 cans of regular chicken broth, we used 3 regular and 1 can of garlic seasoned chicken broth, which we think really added to the flavor!  We will definitely be making this recipe quite often!  It is great!!

As good as the soup I make with home made stock, without all the fuss.  I did add 2 bay leaves (remove before serving)and a few teaspoons of McCormick's refrigerated Gourmet mixed herb. Perfect!Will make this often.

YUM YUM YUM!  This soup is delicious.  I made it exactly as recipe states, using rotissere chicken (to save time) and frozen egg noodles.

This is a decent chicken soup recipe. Too many carrots, I would cut it down a little (1/2 cup). Everything else seemed to work for my family, i.e cook time and ingredients.

First time I've made soup.  My kids LOVE chicken noodle soup and I'm trying to serve them healthier foods instead of convenience.  I read the reviews and changed it a little.  My husband who loves the scratch soup that he makes and is more of a "chef" than I am said it was awesome.  My 7yo loved it.  My 10yo isn't home yet but if the 7yo loved it, more than likely he will.  I changed it by adding a little minced garlic in the sautee.  I used 4 C ready-made chicken broth and 4 C chicken bouillon.  Sauteed the carrots with the other veggies, plus cut raw chicken into the sautee and sprinkled the spices over that instead of with the broth.  I also goofed and used thyme instead of oregano (looked at the container wrong) so not sure how it would be with the oregano.  Used whole wheat Heartland spaghetti noodles (only whole wheat noodles my kids will eat) and no added salt (there's plenty in the broth).  Next time I will cook the carrots a bit before I sautee them to make them more tender, and I want to try olive oil instead of butter (my husband suggests just sauteeing in bouillon as another alternative to lower the fat).  This will be a new staple around here instead of boxed or canned soup - thank you!

This soup was just ok.  It was very easy to make but tasted a little bland to me.  I'll probably make it again only next time add a few extra ingrediants to "kick it up" a notch.

This soup was perfect!! Even my picky 2 year old goobled it down. I did cook my chicken in the crockpot with lots of pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder and some water, and then added the left over broth from the crockpot to the soup to cut down on some of the canned chicken broth. I will be making this often!

My husband and I love this recipe!  It is very easy to make and is great for a quick dinner.  When I make it, I saute some minced garlic and the carrots along with the onions and celery.  The garlic adds a little more flavor to the soup, and adding the carrots to the saute helps to make them more tender.  I also double the chicken and noodle amounts (I use low carb rotini noodles, boiled in a seperate pot), as we like a heartier soup.  Delicious!

I was feeling under the weather today and was craving some chicken noodle soup.  This was my first experience making chicken noodle soup and it was so good.  I used what I had on hand - all vegetable broth and 1 can of cream of chicken soup in addition to the ingredients mentioned.  I also added in some chopped garlic.  I will continue to make this soup and share this dish with my extended family.  Thanks.

Great soup! Thank you sooo much! I have never been a soup person, until after I tried this recipe...now I am ready to take on more soup recipes.  My pastor and his wife came over and ate some, and they begged me for the recipe. smile.  I added cream of mushroom, cream of celery, cream of chicken and then added in some fresh spinach and it was so wonderful! Yummy!

This is so good!  I did do as other reviewers said and boiled the noodles separately.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  It was amazing on a cold day when I was sick with a cold!

Although it's made with canned broth, this soup tastes like you've been working on it all day.  It took me less than 30 minutes.  Nothing is better on a cold night than to cuddle on the couch watching a movie with a big bowl of this soup.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.

Excellent - fast and oh so tasty too! I did add a small bit of minced garlic and added a bay leaf. I also used the Spiral Extra Wide egg noodles. This favorable recipe is definitely added to my favorites! This recipe Rocks!

A very versatile and tasty recipe. I was looking for a way to use some cooked brown rice I had leftover so substituted for noodles. Only had 3 cans of chicken broth so used a can of water and 4 bouillon cubes + the vegetable broth. Followed the advice of some other reviewers and added a little poultry seasoning, thyme and white wine.  Also did not have celery so used chopped lettuce instead as a reviewer suggested.  No carrots on hand so used a drained can of peas and carrots.  We like a thinner chicken soup with a rich tasting broth so this suited us just fine.

I made this soup for my boyfriend and I today for lunch.  Wow!  We loved it and it was so easy to make. Like others I added 1C onion, 1C carrots, 1cup celery, rosemary and thyme.  Delicious!  I'm going to add to my recipe book and share with my family.

My family loves this recipe.  I often cheat and use a rotisserie chicken (quickly pick the cooked meat off the bone) and toss it in the broth.  Dinner is on the table in a flash!

I give this recipe 5 Stars! It was delicious! I varied alittle but took from it what it basically was along with some of the other viewers ideas. My family was sick and I used what I had in the house. Needless to say...Delish! and all gone! I browned the onion in the margarine along with a small amount of chopped up lettuce for flavor since I didnt have celery. (this almost melts away in cooking but tastes similiar) I used a whole chicken on the bone with about 8 cups of water to 3 boullion cubes. I also used 1/8 - 1/4 of a box of ditallini pasta because I didnt have egg noodles or rice. And like one other viewer I used basil, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic powder, poultry seasoning and thyme. I put all the chicken pieces in the pot whole, covered it and After about 20-30 the chicken was cooked. I removed it from the pot, took it off the bone, and returned the chicken pieces to the soup. I had made the pasta seperate, so I added it to the soup and served it hot, sprinkled with grated cheese! YUM!

Yum!  Awesome!  I followed the suggestion of adding garlic, sauteeing it with onion, celery, and carrots in butter.  I added diced chicken raw with broth and seasonings and then ended by adding noddles cooked separately.  My husband and I enjoyed this very much.

I will never purchase canned chicken noodle soup again!  This recipe was SO easy and SO good!  The kids licked their bowls clean and there is enough for lunch tomorrow.  I served on a cold night with freshly baked biscuits - DELISH!

Quick and easy!  I boiled my noodles separately and per other reviews, I cooked the carrots with the celery and onion.  Great warm-up for those cold days!

Oh my goodness....I'm eating leftovers as I type.  This is so good, even if I screwed up and doubled up on the vegetable broth.  I boiled my chicken breasts in the broth, then shredded.  I also sauteed the carrots with onions and celery like other users, just to speed things up a little.  Great recipe!

This is simple & delicious!  Of course I changed a few things.  I like more spice so I added 2 cloves garlic when sauteeing the veggies, 1/2 teaspoon celery salt, 1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning & lots of black pepper.  I didn't have any vegetable broth so I used an envelope of dry vegetable soup mix & added 2 cups of water.  Since I had left over turkey from Thanksgiving I used that instead of chicken & I also had left over rice so used rice instead of noodles.  Tossed in a handful of peas & served with some hot rolls & a salad.  It was great for a snowy winter night in Iowa.

Delicious and easy.  It has become a weekly staple and still has plenty of flavor though I use only low sodium broth.

After thanksgiving, I had about 10 lbs of turkey left over.  I searched for a good recipe and couldn't find what I was looking for.  I tried this and exchanged turkey for chicken.  It was amazing!!  The whole family loved it!

This was the first chicken soup I've ever made and it was easy and delicious.
The only thing I did differently was cook the chicken with the onions and celery. I then added the carrots several minutes later, as someone else suggested, to help make them softer. I also cut the carrots very small. I also cooked the egg noodles separetly. I noticed other people chose not to add the vegetable soup, but I think the vegetable soup was what made it a unique broth and I would recommened it if you are making this for the first time.
Thanks so much for this recipe, excellent!!! :)

It ended up very good! I used a cooked/seasoned rotissorie chicken-  Not bland- but it also was short on stock (which I didn't have).  I ended up blending it with Campbells Chicken soup and my family loved it!

This is the easiest soup recipe!  I took the advice of others and sauteed the carrots with the onions and celery.  I also used a rotisserie chicken and added a little maggi for extra seasoning.  Oh and I cooked the noodles separately.
Thanks for sharing!

Good basic recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used low sodium chicken broth which I won't do again.  It was just too bland.  I also think next time I will add some extra vegetables.

I was so surprised how good chicken noodle soup could be with such a short cooking time! Like other reviewers, I added the carrots in at the same time as the other veggies to saute and I sauted them a little longer that suggested to be sure they would be tender. It was so good...can't wait to make it again!

Awesome.  I added 1/4 tsp of marjoram and thyme in addition to the other spices.  It came out a little salty so I will just cut back on the salt next time but other than that it was perfect.  I served it with ham sandwiches.

This was delicious!  A real hit with my family, so a keeper for me.  The only ingredient change was no celery as I didn't have any.  I did bring the stock (used about 8 c homemade), carrots, chicken and seasonings to boil, then added the egg noodles for about 15 minutes.  It was great with my homemade cheesy garlic biscuits!

We love this! I follow the recipe as is, although I throw in a few more carrots because we like them. This is really fast if you boil and cut your chicken before hand and keep in baggies in the freezer to take out as needed.

Just finished having this for lunch and it was yummy! The only change I made was to add the noodles in at the last 5 minutes of cooking, otherwise they are to overcooked.

Gotta love chicken noodle soup!  Made this last weekend while feeling sorry for myself and battling what seemed to be the onset of a stomach bug.  Used my crock pot, ALL chicken broth (low sodium to boot), added more chicken as well as some peas and a bay leaf.  Let it cook all day and tossed the noodles in towards the end to cook - otherwise, they get mushy.  Thanks!

This is a very tasty basic recipe - however, I did make a few changes, based on personal preference and availability - Other family members do not like oregano, so I reluctantly left it out. I didn't have any celery, so substituted a few shakes of celery seed. I added one fourth cup of minced green bell pepper, which I sauteed along with the onions, in addition to three minced garlic cloves. I also used all chicken broth, but next time I will make sure to have some vegetable broth on hand - sounds good! And, I used two cups of noodles. As other reviewers have mentioned, the prep time was a bit longer than expected, so I am going to chop up my desired vegetables in appropriate amounts and freeze. With leftover or store bought cooked chicken this soup will really be a breeze! - Don't omit the basil, it really adds to the flavor!

I recently became very ill and didn't want to eat anything, not even my favorite foods.  And with my mom away I have to come up with the daunting task of cooking soup by myself.  So I found this recipe, followed the directions except used half a small whole chicken, cooked for 30 minutes longer, added a bit more water and boiled the pasta on the side.  Just had my first taste and it is incredible.  A wonderful comfort food full of italy like flavor, far fresher than any store bought canned junk, and with the added water not too salty for the sick.  And note, the oregano and basil make this dish.  Do what I did and drag yourself to the store if you have to.  You won't regret it!  Vin you're a lifesaver.

Excellent!  Better than ANY chicken noodle soup I have ever had.  The seasonings made it so flavorful and good.  I added garlic to the chicken and a little to the soup itself.

This was delicious!  I had some leftover chicken breast to use up, so I found this recipe. Used linguini noodles.  My silly moluccan cockatoo LOVES this soup.  Thanks!

The calendar says April , but it's snowing in Dallas. A perfect day for trying this soup. Glad I did, very tasty and easy. I had to add more of everything for my family of seven and the only extra ingredient I added   was Garlic. Husband and kids said this was a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This is delicious and so easy.  I only used chicken broth because I don't care for the flavor of vegatable, and increased it by about a can so the noodles wouldn't absorb all the liquid overnight.  I also added more basil and oregano than called for.  It really hit the spot with a grilled cheese sandwich, thanks for the recipe Vincenza

My whole family liked this one.  I sauteed minced garlic with the onion. I also added a few cups extra broth since we all like to dip our toast in it.  We ate about half the batch and I froze the rest which we gobbled up last night.  I'll definitely make this one again.

I usually don't eat chicken noodle soup, because I have always had the kind in the can, and I just don't think it tastes very good at all, but this was amazing!  My husband and I both loved it.  Will definately make again!

This is a very tasty recipe and my husband and I loved it. We have had colds lately and this chicken soup was just what the doctor ordered!  I did make a change in the recipe though- I used the low sodium chicken broth and 
it was very good. Just a warning though-you won't enjoy eating store bought soup after eating this!

This was perfect! Only made slight adjustments.  Diced carrot and browned with onion, celery and two cloves of garlic.  Cooked diced chicken in the soup instead of adding already cooked chicken.  Added noodles (I used tiny egg noodles "Filini") during last 2 minutes of cooking.  This was so good!  Thanks for sharing...

Great recipe!  I am a vegetarian and even made this with ease for my sick boyfriend...thank goodness for the cooked cube chicken!  I took others' suggestions and used 1 can of cream of chicken soup, and 2 boxes of organic chicken broth (also lower in sodium). Sauteed the carrots with the celery and substituted scallions for onions, which I added with the broth & chicken.  Added the egg noodles half-way through cooking time. Turned out great (although I didn't actually taste it)! My boyfriend LOVED it-- ate two huge bowls--and he's somewhat picky. Great simple semi-homemade recipe!

This is great soup! I used 3 boneless, skinless chickne breasts. I also cooled and strained the cooking liqiud from the chicken and  replaced 1 can of chicken broth with it. I left out the celery and veg. broth because I didn't have any. I did add 1 large minced garlic clove. I put it on a slow simmer for about an hr. Good recipe!

I did not use celery...just because my husband does not like it.  Added more carrots and noodles.  This was quick and good.  It was even better the next day.  This might be a good recipe to double and freeze half for future use.

This was not as good as grandma's, but it's very good for how easy it is.  I used soup base instead of broth and a rotisserie chicken.  Added extra veggies too.  Thanks for an easy and tasty chicken soup recipe.

This recipe is awesome! I took some suggestions and added more veggies. I also cut out the veggie broth and added some water to cut down a little on the salt. My husband loves this and he tells family members how wonderful my homemade soup is. I will keep this recipe on hand!

This recipe was great! I added a can of cream of celery soup, since I had no celery, and it added a nice creamy touch. Also, I used boullion instead of canned broth and it turned out SUPER salty without adding any salt, so taste it for sure, like other reviewers have said. I was able to make it a little better by adding some sugar and lemon juice. Thanks for a great recipe that I will use again and again! My husband liked it a lot, and usually soup is "just soup".

Yumm!  I cheat a bit when making this using pre-cooked chicken such as Tyson.  Save some time also by having pre-chopped veggies around so all you have to do is put it together.

My husband loves this recipe, but I think it's too salty. Perhaps next time I prepare this, I'll use low-sodium chicken broth? I also added one can of condensed cream of celery soup (but nixed the chopped celery).

This was very easy, but a little bland.  I had to add a lot of salt a pepper, but it was super fast and easy.  Also a great way to use up any extra noodles you have in your pantry.  I didn't have any egg noodles, but used a mixture of bowtie and fettucine noodles, and they worked wonderfully.

Superb!!  I omitted the vegetable broth and used an extra can of chicken broth instead.  I also was generous on the spices.  Great soup...will make often.

Very easy meal to prepare. In addition, I sauteed the chicken and onions prior to making the recipe and added a hint of italian seasoning for some zing and it was terrific!!!

Very good.  Increased carrots to 1 1/2 cups and added 4 cups of wide (not extra wide) egg noodles.  It was the perfect amount of noodles.  I also substituted one can of cream of chicken for 1 of the chicken broths.

Wow!!!  This really is quick and easy and delicious.  I didn't have any onion or celery.  I used a can of peas and carrots instead.  This recipe is a keeper, so quit reading the reviews and make it already.  ;-)

This soup was awesome!!! I changed a few things though. I bought canned sliced carrots (they are softer and they didn't get mushy), I finely chopped the celery before I sauted them with the onions. I did take the advice of a previous review and substituted a can of chicken broth for a can of cream of chicken soup, this gave it a slightly thicker liquid and even more flavor. I also took the advice of throwing in chicken boullion (half of a cube) and cut down the salt. Instead of using egg noodles, I made the German Spaetzle Dumpling recipe, also on allrecipes. This was very time consuming because I did make the dumplings (they were delish with this soup!) I used leftover baked chicken breast of which I almost doubled the quantity the recipe called for. I like my homemade soups to be chunky, fillin, and not too watery. I didn't follow this recipe exactly, but it was the best soup I have ever had! The time I think it would take to make the soup would be slightly longer even using the egg noodles. It was worth the time to make the dumplings. I doubled the recipe for my big family of 6, so everything I changed-double those suggestions!

This is a great soup.  I highly recommend using chicken stock instead of broth.  Not just for this, but for anything that calls for broth.  You will find it where the cans of broth are located, but stock will come in a box.  It has a much richer flavor.  Other than that one thing I followed the recipe exactly and loved it.  Thanks for posting.

What a great starter recipe!  It was so easy!    The only things I added were potatoes and homemade flour and egg dumplings.  Also I used a little garlic powder and used 3 cans of chicken broth and a little of the water I boiled my chicken in.  An excellent recipe!  My family loved it!

I gave this four stars because I made some modifications. I took others' advice and upped the veggies to 1 cup each and replaced one can on chicken broth with cream of chicken.  Some of my own variations - I omitted the salt and used garlic salt instead & added 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written (I used rotisserie chicken as others have) and it turned out wonderfully!  Thank you Vincenza for this delicious recipe!

Loved it! THe only variation is I added a bit of fresh garlic to sautee the celery and onion in. My noodles seemed to suck up a lot of the broth, so I just added an extra can or two of the chicken broth, and a cube of beef bullion for more flavor. Really good recipe!

Added fresh basil and that pumped it up a bit and used low salt chicken and vegetable broth. Also used store rotisserie chicken as some others suggested. Very tastey and so easy there is no reason to use regular canned soup again!

I have never made homemade chicken soup and this was the first recipe I tried.  I absolutley loved it.  I made it for my sick husband and he loved it so much he ate it all weekend.  I loved how easy this was.  I used one can of cream of chicken in place of one of the chicken broths and it was perfect!

very good flavor - the prep time is definitely more than 10 minutes though with all the veggie chopping and cooking the chicken ahead of time.

This was good, though the seasoning left something to be desired. I used whole wheat egg noodles and used 2 c. frozen crinkle cut carrots  to boost nutrition.

This recipe was very tasty, however it is not suggested to make in a crockpot.   The noodles got really mushy. Next time, will follow the directions as written.  :)

Now that the weather is cool, I was looking for a good chicken noodle soup recipe.  This recipe is fantastic!  I am usually very suspicious of canned chicken broth, as it is so nasty straight from the can, but I made this recipe exactly as directed and it was out of his world.  Hearty, yet nourishing.  My whole family loved it, even my picky husband.  This will be a fall/winter staple in my household.

This is a good basic recipe to start with. I dont measure anything so I know I added more onion than called for and also added fresh minced garlic. This can be easily changed to suit your own tastes, or to what you have in the pantry.

This was good, but not fantastic.  If I make it again I will cook the vegetables in the broth for about 12 minutes before adding the chicken and noodles.  Vegetables were not soft enough for my taste.  I will also add about a tablespoon of flour to try and thicken the broth some.

This was sooooo yummy! Perfect for the rainy, cool weather we've been having! I didn't bother with the cans of broth, just threw some chicken bouillon cubes in boiling water and used that. Worked perfectly! My very finicky kids loved it, too! Even better the next day!

Very good. I made this for my sick husband and he ate two bowls and wanted some the next night too. I didn't have any veg broth but it was still great. I also used 2 cups of egg noodles instead of 1 1/2.

Excellent and easy soup!  I minced the onions and celery instead of chopping and added a bit extra chicken stock.  Everyone in the house was not feeling well (including me) so I bought precooked chicken breast to throw in even.  I used the thin egg noodles as well (about a half a package is all you need).

Amazing!  The only thing I changed was adding a little rosemary to the broth.  I was searching for a quick, yet flavorful chicken noodle soup recipe for my sick kids (and something us adults could have for dinner). 
 They've  been fighting a stomach bug for a week and I was sick of canned & boxed chicken noodle soup.  This recipe was a home run in my book!

Absolutely loved this soup! All the reviews are correct...this soup is delicious and so easy! I used chicken from a roaster and added extra amounts of veggies. Making it again today as it’s a very dreary gloomy day.

Excellent chicken noodle soup. I used 4 Costco roasted chicken leg quarters -- about 1 lb of meat. (Dark meat is so much more flavorful.) Boiled the bones and skin for stock; strained and added about 24 oz lo sodium chicken bone broth and ~2 tsp Better Than Boullion. Sauted 1 c. each of onion, carrots and cellery in butter and basil pesto Genovese; added 2 cloves minced garlic, oregano, thyme and Bells poultry seasoning to taste. Added stock, veggies and chicken to a pot with ~2.5 c med egg noodles and simmered for ~ 15 minutes.  Hubbie loved it  as is. I added garlic pepper and a drizzle of half and half to mine to make it slightly creamy. Perfect!

Easy to make with a pleasant Italian vibe from the basil and oregano. Prep time was about 15 minutes in order to rinse and chop the veggies. Next time I'll cook the noodles separately so they don't soak up the broth when storing. Will also saute carrots and add some fresh garlic to the saute mix near the end of cooking before adding to pot. This is a great basic recipe. I'll try using traditional seasonings next time to make more like Grandma's! If I have time, I'll also simmer the chicken bones in the broth and then remove them before adding the other ingredients to add even more flavor.

I added 0.40lb of chicken, doubled celery, pinch more onions, & 2.25x carrots (we really love carrots) and it was a big hit for our family of 9! Even the 7M old baby loved it!

Delicious starting base! First time making chicken noodle soup and I'm glad I chose this recipe to start with. Only complaint; it's a little bland for my taste, so I turned up the seasonings and it came out perfect!

Fast and easy soup that tastes delicious. I put a heaping spoon full of pesto in and it sent the taste over the top. Added fresh garlic to the soup for the simmer.

I used 1 32oz carton of Trader Joes organic chicken broth and 1 32oz carton of TJ's vegetable broth and 32 oz more of chicken broth from cubes because I wanted more broth. I used 2# chicken, 5 cloves minced garlic, added celery salt (didn't have celery), 3T dried minced onion, couple pinches of Thyme, 3/4t dried oregano.

I saute the cubed chicken in olive oil, cooked the egg noodles in separate pot, al dente, sauted the carrots in butter till barely tender then added chopped garlic for another minute. Added all together in pot. 

cube the chicken on the small side.

This was a nice and easy chicken soup recipe. I like it because I can add anything I want to the soup. I added orzo noodles instead of the egg noodles and my whole family loved it. I will need to double the recipe next time!

Fantastic! So simple that it's easy to customize. My wife is allergic to wheat so I used some gluten free pasta noodles (couldn't find GF egg noodles) and I found minced raw chicken breast at the store, so I just sautéed the chicken with some butter and seasonings. Followed the recipe otherwise and it was delicious!
I'm definitely keeping this recipe handy.

THE BEST super quick chicken noodle soup recipe!!!!! It takes virtually no more than the time it takes to strip a rotisserie chicken to make this soup! If you buy the pre-cut celery/onion/carrot mix it’s even quicker. I only cook for 1 so when I make this I don’t usually add all the noodles at once since I tend to spread the soup out over several meals. I usually boil up a fresh batch of noodles about half way through my consumption and then they don’t get mushy. Perfect comfort soup.

I use this as a guide every year to make my annual leftover Thanksgiving turkey noodle soup. 

Instead of chicken broth, I use the broth left over from my baked in a bag turkey and make up with any needed broth with chicken broth. I do not use the full 1/2 teaspoon of oregano and basil but more of a pinch of each because of the aromatics that I use in the turkey and in turn the broth. I salt and pepper to taste after that. Also use a lot of the dark meat instead of breast and because most do not eat the dark meat, so this makes it into the soup. 

The my now TTNS (Thanksgiving Turkey Noodle Soup) is always a hit and using this recipe as a guide works out fantastically!

So excited about this soup. After buying a Costco chicken and taking the meat off I boiled the bones and skin and made home made stock. Looked up and easy recipe because I don’t know how to cook using my own pallet.  I made this in less than an hr and I found myself putting it in containers to share with everyone. I added about 4 more cups of broth because it was thick and wanted it to go farther. I just added more of the same seasoning required I now have a delicious soup when I want to bring someone a meal and know they’ll enjoy it thank you thank you

Just like the title says “quick and easy”, what it doesn’t mention is that it has flavor. Often when I make a chicken noodle soup it lacks any flavor, so I was happily surprised on this one. Would recommend this recipe

Tried this recipe with no changes and I thought it was very good. My wife suggested that the next time I made it I should add a little poultry seasoning.  So the next week I tried it again This time adding about a tsp of poultry seasoning and darned if she wasn’t right. Will definitely be making this many more times this winter. Great comfort food.

Such a easy and delicious Chicken Noodle Soup! I added more chicken meat and noodles to this dish to make it a fuller meal. Also added some garlic powder (would’ve used cloves) and 8 whole black pepper with the spices as well. The only thing that is tedious is the prepping. Give yourself a couple hours to cut the chicken, celery, carrots and onions before cooking. Also use the right cuts for your veggies and chicken (I used bite size cuts because I have hungry little nephews & nieces). But overall this soup is a 10/10 hands down!

This my go to for chicken noodle soup! I’ve made it countless times! Don’t skip the veggie broth because it really improves the flavor. The only thing I do different is cook the chicken separately. I find that whenever I boil chicken, it releases a white residue into the soup so I just prefer cooking it beforehand! Otherwise it’s a really great chicken noodle soup!

Great base recipe for a simple and delicious chicken noodle soup. I used thyme, rosemary and a bay leaf instead of the oregano and basil. Also, all chicken stock instead of veggie and chicken broth. I used all of the meat from a rotisserie chicken, including the dark meat, as opposed to white meat only. I weighed it out and it’s almost exactly one pound of meat, so perfect! Finally, I use about 2 1/2 cups of noodles, because who doesn’t love more noodles, right? Tastes just like homemade.  I’m making it for the second time tonight.

This was awesome. I added carrots to the onions and celery and probably had about 3/4 cup of each. Once tender I added some minced garlic. I used smart taste egg noodles and leftover rotisserie chicken. Otherwise I followed the instructions. It tasted buttery and amazing for such an easy dish.

It was easy and yummy. I used carton of veg broth and carton of chicken broth. I would add more chicken cubes for more of a chicken flavor and maybe something to thicken the broth to be more creamy would be great too. But overall a great recipe!

I made it with 3 uncooked chicken breast and 4 garlic cloves. I cut the Chicken Breast in cubes and sautéed with the butter, onion, celery and garlic until it was cooked. Then followed the recipe.

Good. Do all of the above, but also add 1 or 2 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs to cook along with it. Adds that hours-long flavor, but without the hours-long wait.  Once cooked through, the meat can be added to the soup (along with the rest of the ingredients as per the recipe.) Takes this to 5 stars.

The entire family loved it! I used 2 Tbsp of butter, sautéed the onion and celery for about five minutes and then added the carrots and sautéed another 5 minutes, added the chicken and spices (and a pinch of rosemary) and just let it sit on the burner with the heat off for 10-15 minutes. I think this let the spices really meld to the chicken and veggies. I then used stock packets that you add to 3 1/2 cups of boiling water (x3) instead of the broths, heated that separately and then added to the rest. Brought that to a simmer and then added homemade egg noodles! (I actually let it simmer for maybe 30 minutes before adding the noodles, I didn't want the noodles to overcook, so I waited until everyone was here). I probably added more like 3 cups of noodles and I have no idea how much chicken, because I didn't weigh it. I actually cooked some chicken breasts and thought I had enough until just before I added the noodles and then decided that I needed more. I happened to have a large can of chicken that I was able to add, and it made it just right. This was my first time making noodles too - you can do it, my husband loved the noodles.

Followed the top reviewers and added garlic with the onions. I didn't have basil but I had fresh thyme which was lovely, didn't have vegetable broth so I only used chicken, and  I made the noodles in their own pot to avoid the starchy, unfreezable glue you get when you cook the noodles in the soup. I ended up adding a cube of chicken bouillon to improve the flavor profile: I think the broth you choose is critical and mine was too salt-free mild to offer a lot of flavor. My husband said this was the best home-made chicken noodle recipe we've tried yet.

Wow. Really loved this soup! I went with "Brown Sugar Girl's" suggestions. I also used half of a 16oz bag of egg noodles and doubled everythong except the broths so we would have leftovers. What a great soup ! Quick & easy too.

Goes together very easily, even if you don't follow the exact ingredients. I added more of the veggies and chicken than the recipe, and more garlic. 1/2 cooked my chicken in a saute pan, then the boiling soup finished the cooking process without it becoming rubbery. Added precooked pasta at the last step. It's a regular now, thanks for this!

Exactly what I wanted - quick and easy and tastes like Mom used to make!  It was the most delicious soup I ever made!  I used sodium-free chicken broth but regular vegetable broth and it turned out perfectly salted to my taste.

I made this soup Thursday night and by Friday morning it was finished!  I actually made every thing from SCRATCH/fresh. I do not use can chicken and I did not have any broth. What I did was saute my celery and carrots in butter, added  basil and oregano.  Sauteed some more.  Added my onions and 3 cloves of garlic,  chopped/minced. I cut my chicken breast in bite size pieces,  SEASONED IT VERY WELL with garlic powder,  onion powder, chicken seasonings, pepper and Tony's no salt seasoning.  I boiled the chicken for a few minutes.  I then added the chicken to the pot of veggies and let that cook all together.  I then added the broth that I made ( from the  chicken) to the pot of veggies. I let that boil for a few minutes while I cooked my egg noodles half way done.  Once they where half way done,  I drained them and added them to the pot.  I let that cook on low until the noodles where done,  to my liking.  I made some hom6 corn bread and both was delicious.  My family had seconds and kept giving me compliments on the soup and how I should have made more along with the cornbread. It was my first time making a chicken noodle soup and it was a hit! I do not measure my ingredients so I can not tell you how much seasoning I used. I did add vegeta seasoning when all ingredients was in one pot. The broth was very good and tasty. Definitely a must try!

Good little recipe. I followed the recommendation to add a couple of dashes of poultry seasoning, a pinch of thyme and to cut the chicken into bite sizes and cook it while the recipe boils - it worked well however I may swap out chicken breast  for chicken thighs or ground chicken to keep the moisture. This could easily be done with a chicken from Sams or Costco too.  I did use the better than boullion broth and it really makes a different as it brings a TON of flavor with it.

This was delicious and simple. I took the advice of other reviews and sauteed all the veggies with garlic at the beginning. I also used way more noodles than the recipe called for.  Next time I'll double or triple the veggies. Great recipe!!!

Very easy and very good. I skipped the celery and added garlic, sliced mushrooms, and a parsnip. I sautéed the onions, carrots, parsnip, and garlic; then added raw chicken and cooked until it was browned; then added the broth, herbs, noodles, and mushrooms. Nice flavor, quick. Good for my wife who has a cold, and for me, too.

I cook for 1 (or 2) and this is the PERFECT recipe for one person and it's so easily done in a hurry.  Don't know how I did without it...I've wasted too much food making larger quantities when it's just me eating.  Thanks so very much for this ideal recipe.

I never post reviews but I just had to for this soup.  I made it according to the directions the first time and it was amazing!  My boyfriend, his son and I all loved it.  I froze the remaining broth for another batch of noodles.  I made it a second time in the same week.  This time I added extra chicken and cooked the noodles separately.  I also cut the oregano and parsley down just a bit.  I made it for my son and mom.  They both raved over this soup and said we will never have canned soup again.   Thank you so much.  This is a new staple recipe in my house.

I've made this both the way listed and some changes. While it is yummy as is (4 stars as I rated), it was a total 5 with the changes made.
I skipped the vegetable broth and added an extra can of chicken broth. Used white and dark meat from a rotisserie chicken. And added about 1/2 tsp dried rosemary.
Next time I think I will dice the veggies instead.

Very good and fast.  I just added a lot more chicken and I used whole wheat noodles for added fiber and lower sugar content.  I also added two cans of light beer and didn’t add the noodles until the end.  I didn’t want to over cook the noodles so I only cooked them for about 10 minutes.

Loved how quick and easy this was. The only change I made was using beef broth instead of vegetable since it was all I had on hand. It came out great. Even my extremely picky 9yr old son gave it a thumbs up! Wonderful comfort food for the cold winter months. Will DEFINITELY make again.

such a quick and easy way to have homemade soup in a short time!   I didn't have carrots, so I substituted yellow peppers which added a different flavor, and I was out of oregeno so added fresh parsley, fresh basil in small pieces, and a little Thyme.   Great additions for flavor , and overall the vegetable soup added in this recipe really makes the  difference for flavoe.   Loved it!

Based on a past reviewer’s suggestion, I added the carrots in the beginning with the addition of minced garlic. I also used rotisserie chicken that we already had and doubled the noodles. Very, very yummy!

It was delicious. Only thing I did outside the recipe, used rotisserie chicken, which  I chop up.   My husband and I both had colds, finished in a day!  
Will definitely make again, and not just because we have a cold.

Very good recipe. I added a few more noodles to make it less soupy, since my family prefers it to be less soupy and more like chicken and noodles.

It is good soup, but I would skip the oregano and maybe I would add another can of chicken soup just to thicken it a little bit more.

I would at least double all the vegetables & noodles. I also added garlic cloves. It is easy, quick & tastes pretty good. Original recipe is kind of bland so add to your taste. I put in a little more broth than was than called for as well.

I reviewed this recipe when I first made it three years ago. I enjoyed it then, but lately I've made a few changes. To quicken things up, I shred a rotisserie chicken and use a container of pre-chopped onions, carrots and celery. I sauteed them in olive oil, then add the shredded chicken and two 14 ounce containers of chicken stock. I cook the noodles separately and add them to each bowl of soup. I also add, thyme, a bay leaf and fresh ground pepper to taste. I don't add additional salt because the stock has enough. To make chicken corn soup, I simply add a package of frozen corn with the soup. The soup freezes very well. I made it for a friend and she said it was the best chicken corn soup she'd ever eaten. I keep a container of soup with or without corn in my freezer for quick meals or friends.

I made this for my son (who is home from college with a wicked cold) last night.  I took the advice from others and included garlic with the carrots, onion and celery.  I also omitted the veg stock.
It was REALLY easy (especially since I used a rotisserie chicken) and really delicious!

I tried my hand at this twice. I am not a culinary person at all. The first time I made it I forgot that egg noodles do not need a long time to cook, and the whole thing became a mushy mess. The second time, I used Turkey instead of chicken, because I had leftovers in the fridge. It tastes great! I do plan on making it again in the future!

I like this recipe because it is easy and takes very little time.  I use meat from a cooked roasted chicken from the grocery store and it is delicious.  Very good to eat when I’m not feeling good and just want something light.

Super easy and quick! I added the carrots to the onions and celery with butter to get them more tender. The only thing I’d suggest is this was slightly bland, I would add more seasoning. But I definitely will make again!

I did what another person said: "in melted butter, sauté 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 cup chopped onion, 1 cup chopped celery, and 1 cup sliced carrots. Meanwhile, chop 1/2 pound uncooked boneless, skinless chicken breast into bite-size pieces. Add chicken, the broth, basil, oregano, salt, garlic pepper, a dash or two of poultry seasoning, and a pinch or two of dried thyme to the pot of veggies. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cook 3 cups egg noodles according to package directions in a separate pot. Add drained noodles to chicken and veggies, simmer an additional 10 minutes. Only if you want some creaminess, go ahead and add a half can of condensed cream of whatever soup (whatever flavor you choose)"

This recipe was SO good! It reminded me of restaurant chicken noodle soup, but i did make some changes. I added worchestershire sauce and used rotiserie chicken. I also cooked in the carrots with the butter with the celery and onions to soften them some more because last time i made it they were more crunchy then i like, but if you like crunchy carrot then it might be ok to just add when you are adding all of the other ingredients!

I used the recipe as more a guideline (nothing was measured) to throw together something quick before I came down with whatever my family came down with all at once. I shredded some turkey leftovers instead of chicken and added a little cumin and better than bouillon (when you're sick everything tastes plain).

Being vegan, I simply substituted the chicken for vegan brands of chik'n strips cut up and non-chicken chik'n broth. The recipe is super easy to prepare and is a wonderful and hearty meal.

I made this several times using all chicken broth.  I finally bought some vegetable flavored Better than broth and used 14.5 oz of that as written and did it have such a better flavor.  Didn't know what I was missing.
I used past reviewers ideas and used diced raw chicken.  Add as recipe states, simmer for 20 minutes, add noodles and simmer another 10 minutes.  Yummy.

Love this recipe - I've been making it for years and am just now reviewing.  I usually try to throw all veggies in and saute for a few minutes and then slowly add the broth to help get them soft.  I also cook the noodles separately, and only cook as much as I'll need for that particular sitting.  When I cook the noodles in the broth and save them together (for leftovers), the noodles absorb too much of the liquid.  Other than that - PERFECT recipe.

I'm rating this five stars because it's an excellent base recipe and it's very easy to adjust for you or your family's preferences. 

Our changes were: doubled the veggies and added carrots and garlic; added thyme to the seasonings (1 teaspoon); added half a can of cream of celery; cooked the noodles separate; and cooked the chicken separate until it was time to add the broth.

I first added garlic, let that cook for a minute - then I added the onions, celery and carrots. I let them all sweat for about 5-7 minutes. I then added the broths, chicken and herbs (i also added fresh thyme) and let that simmer until carrots were soft. Cooking the noodles in the soup for the whole 20 min makes them turn to mush so I actually prefer to cook those separate and add them at the end. Great taste and a recipe I use anytime a cold is making its way around the home.

This is the quickest and easiest soup to make. I followed the instructions completely except for the use of chicken breasts. I found that by using chicken thighs instead, the flavor was better and easier for my daughter to chew. Now I get asked to make it when my family is sick.

It is simmering right now and smells wonderful. The only chicken I had handy was ground chicken so I cooked that up with the celery. Not being a big fan of chopped onion, I used dried chives in an amount that suited me. Admittedly I added some soup base with water as I did not have enough broth on hand, but kept other seasonings the same. I also cooked the noodles separately. We will be eating this in a few minutes  with homemade bread.  I took a  tiny taste test -- YUM!!

I loved it and so did my 5 year old. I did a slight adjustment by adding 2 cups of egg noodles and seasoned my chicken whole pan cooking it.

Loved making & devouring it! As with anyone who enjoys cooking, you add a little bit of this, substitute another or subtract elsewhere to suite your taste buds. But, the heart of the recipe is “5*****” ???? Very delish & simple:)

Yes, I w I’ll make it again. I made some very minor changes by addeding a dash of Tabasco, a couple of shakes of Spike seasoning, and a little chopped parsley.   I added a bit too more pepper than I would prefer but still really liked it.  Others would have enjoyed the additional pepper but my husband likes to taste the chicken pieces.

Very good and very easy. My family doesn’t like cooked celery so I left it out. And since I’m sick, I just grabbed a bag of frozen mixed veggies (carrots, peas, corn, green beans) and threw that in for the carrot portion since it was easier. It was really good. I also added a bit more noodles per request of my husband. 
I added some bouillon for extra flavor (I usually make chicken broth/stock myself, so I added bouillon to make up for not having homemade). My family likes chicken noodle soup just slightly thickened so I also added a small amount of cornstarch. It was perfect!

This was a wonderful soup!  I didn't use the oregano or basil.   I used a teaspoon of Italian seasonings instead.  I also used a clove of garlic (because I sauteed chicken tenders with olive oil and garlic and then followed the recipe).   This was definitely a hit in our household!  Served with a salad and bread.

Pleasantly surprised how delicious this turned out.  I put this in the fridge overnight and ate it the next day. The noodles I used soaked up most of the broth which made it even more delicious. Next time I plan on adding corn. Huge thumbs up!

I made this with a few small adjustments. We shredded the remains of a leftover rotisserie chicken that we had a few nights prior. Didn’t have carrots or celery so we added frozen corn, upped the onion, and added 3 minced cloves of garlic. Also added 1/4 tsp. of rosemary, thyme, and 1 Tbsp. of poultry seasoning and corn starch. Didn’t add the noodles until the last 4 minutes of cooking time since they were on the thin side. We loved it! My husband said it was the best he’s had yet!

I add almost 2 cups of chopped onion [an entire onion] 1 cup plus of celery and 1 cup plus of carrots. I sauté all the vegetables for 5 - 7 minutes, then add the rest of the ingredients. Love the vegetables. Delicious and truly simple recipe. Quick to make, done in less than an hour.

My mother in law who doesn't generally eat seconds ate TWO full bowl fulls! I didn't have broth and used bullion cubes with 10 cups of water but that was the ONLY difference. 

Thank you for the recipe!

Cooked noodles separately.  
Very good and very easy.  Be careful of salt if you purchase the chicken and vegetable broth.  You might not want to add more salt as you're making the recipe.  
I used leftover rotisserie chicken parts (both light and dark meats)  
Would make again.  Very happy with this recipe.

Let me start off by saying in no way shape or form am I a cook. I have been known to burn water.  However recently I've decided to give cooking another try even though my husband is a chef. I made this for him tonight because he was not feeling good.  

I nailed it! However it was neither quick nor easy... lol... at least not for me.  I used almost all organic ingredients added fresh garlic because everything tastes better with garlic.  The prep took the longest time for me because I'm still learning knife skills. Also I had to cook the celery much longer than the 5 minutes the recipe called for.  

But in the end it was delicious and my husband gave his approval by cleaning his bowl.  

So .... if I can make this and it come out delicious... then anyone can make this... just expect it to take longer than 30 minutes.  ??

I served it with cheese quesadillas because I didn't have bread for grilled cheese.

Easy fast tasty meal.  Made just as recipe states and it was perfect for my tastes.  Some other reviewers added garlic which sounded good but I wasn't certain it would be good so I didn't try it

Simple and delicious! I added 2 cloves of minced garlic, per another reviewer’s comment. I used chicken broth and 2 packets of no-sodium chicken bouillon and added some sea salt for taste. Yum!!

Very good for a quick soup! My sweetheart came home sick from work so I needed something in a flash that wasn't from a can. This was easy to put together and we both loved it. I would also recommend adding the carrots to the butter when you add the celery and onion.

This was really tasty (with the garlic added). I always strive to make recipes exactly as written. So, aside from two cloves of garlic, I did so. That said, a reviewer mentioned cooking the noodles separate from just tossing them in... should’ve listened. The 12oz of egg noodles soaked up MOST of the amazing broth which was such a bummer! My next batch I will definitely be making the noodles in a separate pot and then adding to each bowl individually. I also plan to make a double (non-noodle) batch which seems like a ton, but it’s really not! And I will freeze leftovers. Thank you for the perfect noodle soup recipe.

Super yummy. After boiling the broth and veggies I tossed it in the crock pot on high a couple of hours then made the noodles in a separate pot to add to it. Every bite was gone the same day. Great comfort food.

My girlfriend tragically is sick with the soar throat.. success and praise  to this recipe and its simplicity. I did add 1 more tablespoons of butter and cooked the carrots with butter and veggies. Just a tad of poultry seasoning and just right.

I used minced onion and celery salt cooled with 1 tbsp butter and cubed chicken breast. As my kids don't like the texture of celery. I also used 2 chicken bullion cubes and 1 veggie bullion cubes To 9 cups of water. Through it all in the crock pot with noodles, carrots, salt, pepper, basil and oregano. Put it on high for 2 hours and low for another hour. Absolutely yummy.

Delicious as is, but I did make a few changes by increasing the amount of carrots and celery. I also added minced garlic when sautéing the onions and celery. The leftovers will make a great lunch at work. We will definitely make this again.

I will definitely make again. I love soup and I couldn't spoon this one into my mouth fast enough. I will probably cook the noodles on the side next time so they don't get super mushy in the leftovers.

My husband is usually the cook in the house. He was not feeling well and I needed something fast and homemade. I read through the reviews before I began and I'm glad that I did. It was suggested that I add garlic to my onions and celery when I sauteed them as well as my carrots which I did. I also had some fresh thyme and threw that in as well when I began simmering everything. Because we like hearty soups I also followed the suggestion to add more celery and onion then what the recipe called for as well as some finely chopped potatoes. Oh boy is this DEE-LICIOUS and I sure scored some love Bank points with the husband when I served him this. ???????

I love this recipe and have made it probably 20 times.  My family  enjoys it and it enables me to put a wholesome, comforting, and tasty meal on the table in 30 minutes.  I think the key to this recipe is the addition of the vegetable broth.  In a pinch I have used just the chicken broth, but it is really better with a can of vegetable broth.

Along with others, I sautéed a clove if garlic with the veggies and added the carrots in with the onion and celery. I did a combo of veggie and chicken broth and doubled the amount of noodles. I have  made the recipe w roasted chicken as well as rotisserie and both have come out great!

Very good, incredibly easy to make.  I doubled the veggies, added extra no yolk noodles, and reduced the chicken broth by one box, to make for a more plentiful batch.  Although it was tasty as is, I’d add a bay leaf next time.

Very easy & quick recipe. Made it for my husband & he loves it.  I used homemade soup stock instead of chicken & veggie stocks.

SUPER easy recipe!  I like that I can get dinner on the table in 30 minutes.  Just enough flavor - great for kids and adults.  I bake a huge batch of fajita chicken and keep it in the freezer so I have flavorful chicken ready to use for this recipe.

This had a great flavor! I threw in 1 tsp minced garlic when sautéing the onion and celery. I also sautéed the carrots with it too, per someone else’s suggestion. And after cooking the noodles al dente, I threw it all into a crock pot. Easy weeknight meal!

I made several changes to this recipe that probably contributed to it not being as good as I  hoped.  So I won't penalize the recipe for that.  It was easy and tasted pretty good but for the changes I made so I'll try it again soon without changing anything.

Tastes delicious and is very simple and quick to make. I found that the egg noodles got super soggy when I added them in when the recipe suggests, so now I add them during the last 5 minutes of simmering and they cook perfectly. I also add about 2 cups of cooked rice right at the end to make it a bit heartier. Also, this makes more like 4 servings if you like a good-sized bowl of soup.

The first time I made it with leftover rotisserie chicken (cooked chicken in the broth- strained broth and picked out the meat)... delish!
Today I made it with frozen boneless chicken thighs... also delish!
I will not fix any other chicken soup!

Very good! To be 5 stars to me, I stick with herbes de provence for seasoning and add a little grated parmesan while cooking as  well as a topping for when it's done. I've also put this in ramekins topped with a slice of toasted bread and swiss cheese and run it quickly under the broiler for a really hearty, wintertime  taste.

Super easy and delicious base recipe. I threw in some mushrooms, and used double the veggies. I also used a bite sized pasta rather than egg noodles. Such a great comforting soup.

This recipe is a no fail!  If you do not have onions or other vegetable, no sweat.  I do not use the butter or the onions.  I do poach the chicken breast in chicken broth and then cube the chicken and return it to the pot with all the other recommended ingredients.  I think that it makes the chicken juicier.

Excellent recipe! Thank you so much! I made it today. I seasoned two chicken breast (thyme,sea salt, black pepper, and season salt) and sautéed them in olive oil . I actually ended up partially sautéeing  the carrots with the celery and onions, until I realized they were supposed to be added after with the other ingredients. So, after separating them from the onions and celery I returned the pot to the stove to let them cook (celery/onions).  I seasoned the veggies with sea salt, pepper, and thyme (didn't have oregano). I then added the rest of the ingredients. I didnt use veggie broth just chicken and a bit of chicken stock. It was soooo good!

I did make some changes as I didn’t have a can of vegetable broth so I used five cans of chicken broth instead of four.  I accidentally add twice as much basil.  I thought I grabbed the oregano and put in another 1/2 tsp of basil.  No worries it still hadn’t a great flavor

I used about 3/4 lb. of smoked turkey instead of chicken, and it turned out great. I also added garlic, peas, and a little more stock to replace all that boiled or steamed off, but overall, it turned out really good! It made about a gallon of soup altogether. Recommended!

My kiddo stayed home from school with an upset tummy today and requested chicken noodle soup. I made this recipe with herbs of provenance, white pepper, and half of the stock cooking two diced chicken breasts on medium high for a while. Once the chicken was cooked through, I added the rest of the stock and about 16 oz of cream of chicken. I used about a cup and a half each of organic celery and carrots, and cooked them medium high with a lil bit of oil and the half cup of onions with salt and pepper. towards the end I added the butter, maybe a lil more, as well as extra garlic. The family can't get enough of this soup! I promised to make it on the regular from now on. It ended up alittle thick and I want more soup, so I'm going to cook 1 more chicken breast tomorrow with the some more stock and cream of chicken and add it in! The kiddo's feeling better already and it was perfect for a cold winter dinner!

I bought low/no sodium broth since some reviews said it was a little on the salty side.  Although it turned out decent, it was quite bland.  The only other thing that I did different was that I added the noodles after it had been simmering for 10 minutes so that the noodles wouldn't be over done.  Overall, it was ok.  Would be good for when you were sick (probably couldn't taste if it was salty or not).

We’re trying to do fewer carbs so I did veggie-noodles and doubled everything (chicken, spices, carrots and celery).  Came out great. Just remember to season the chicken when you cook it, I think it helps.

I doubled the recipe and used store bought chicken bone broth and a smaller amount of beef broth to give it some additional flavor and it turned out great! My family loved it so much I made it again the following week. I don't know if I'll ever go back to starting with a whole raw chicken for my soup given the mess and time it takes and this recipe is every bit as good.

Really good, traditional chicken noodle soup! I added garlic and extra egg noodles.  Any comments about different spices that might give a unique twist to this soup would be appreciated.

Execellent!!! 
Cooked according to top review with the exception of the poultry seasoning.  I added 1tsp of Better than Bouillon (roasted chicken flavor) to the chicken/veggies. I also boiled my noodles in water combined with Better than Bouillon (roasted chicken flavor).

This was a DELICIOUS find! I did make a few minor changes. Per other reviewers I cut up the veggies and cooked the carrots along with onion/celery on the stove to make sure that they would all be nice and tender. I transferred the veggies into a large pot, added vegetable/chicken broths and added a pound of diced UNCOOKED chicken breasts (cut into small cubes) added the oregano, basal and pepper and brought to a boil for 20 minutes.  In the meantime, I cooked the noodles per package directions and added the noodles to the large pot after the 20 minutes. I added a pinch of pepper and rosemary to the soup and added half of a can of cream of chicken broth (although next time I may use cream of celery instead). I let this all simmer together for 10 more minutes and it turned out fantastic!! Quick, easy and good. Lots of flavor--Perfect for a cold night/sick day! Can't wait to have leftovers for lunch today!

Saute 1-2 cloves garlic, 1/4 onion, 2 celery, and 3 carrots in the melted butter for 4 min. Pour in 48 oz of chicken broth, and 14 oz of vegetable broth and 1/2 cup of water. Add fresh oregano and basil, salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, then add chicken and 2 cups of egg noodles.  Simmer for 20 min.  I used rotisserie chicken (breast and 2 legs).

Great and easy!  This is a FAST way to make a great soup!
I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts.  I used more than 1/2 pound of thighs.... we love lots of chicken!

very good recipe. I added 1/2 cup of noodles and it was just right. I also used rotini noodles since they stand up better in liquid. my whole family enjoyed it so it's definitely a keeper.

I used this soup recipe to use  leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. I didn't have any basil, so I substituted rosemary, which is great with poultry. The end result was delicious! Served it with some crusty bread I made earlier in the day. All in all, a very satisfying meal!

It's a decent base. Added Protein Pasta in place of Noodles!

I omitted the butter and sauteed all the veggies in chicken broth

I doubled the spices and added 1 tbsp dried parsley, 1/2tsp of pepper and 1/2tsp of Garlic Salt 

Topped with cojita (mexican parmesean cheese) and oyster crackers

I made Turkey noodle soup after Thanksgiving, from this recipe. 
After boiling down leftovers carcuss (which had remnants of poultry herbs from turkey day), I separately sautéed onion in butter, added minced garlic, sautéed a few more minuted, poured in all broth and meat (a whole dutch oven worth), 6 sliced carrots, thyme,sage,salt, pepper, brought to a boil and reduced to simmer for a couple hours. After carrots were soft, I poured in two cans of condensed cream of chicken soup(this is key). Next I boiled(separately) whole package egg noodles until they were still a little stiff, drained and put them in the soup and simmered all together for little longer until noodles were perfect. Serve right away. 

Its important to note that noodles keep absorbing liquid from the soup so they eventually end up somewhat mushy on the second day but it's still really yummy. 
I do not usually like chicken (turkey)noodle soup but I absolutely loved this recipe the way it turned out.

After reading my review I realized that I really didn't make the recipe the way that the author did. I did use it as a guide to figure out how to make my own though.

I like my soup thick so I used 1 whole celery stalk, 2 cups carrots, 1 whole onion, added 3 cloves garlic chopped and cayenne pepper.  Turned out great!  Easy and nice recipe for winter.

This will definitely be a repeat.  I used only chicken broth because I didn't have any vegetable broth.  I replaced the egg noodles with vegetable rotini.  It was very good!

It's very good but I think it needs more liquid since it all seemed to get soaked up. Upping the broth amount by a fairly significant margin would help it a lot.

Absolutely delish! Didn't change a thing, just omitted the celery as my wife and I don't care for it. Easy to make and great flavors! Thank you!

Substitutions even work! Didn't have veggie broth, so just used chicken broth.  Used onion powder instead of onion, and celery salt instead of celery. (No extra salt added.)  Didn't use oregano but did use garlic AND thyme.  A little thyme only makes sauces, gravies and soups richer. With all that, it still was great!

DELICIOUS!!!!! I will definitely make this again....I used all kinds of spices. rotisserie spice, Jane's Krazy seasoning, salt, pepper, and mixture of Sicilian blend spice. Used 1 cup of roasted garlic broth, 2 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of veg broth. Awesome!! Made chicken noodle with mashed potatoes with leftovers. My picky daughter raved and raved over it.

This soup was just as it says "quick and easy".  Usually I follow the recipes as written but for this one I used it as a "guide" using up leftover chicken, veggies and angel hair pasta.  All the seasonings were as written and that is what gave it such a great flavor. Oh yes, I did include fresh parsley but only because I had it.  Thank you for "quick and easy"!

Really good!  I actually made it with leftover chicken enchilada filling so it had tomatoes, corn and chilies in it. So yummy.
But it is a good soup prepared as directed as well. Super easy!

I’ve made this twice now and although the taste is fine, the noodles get overdone in 20 min and there isn’t enough broth. I tried egg noodles and tiny noodles. Both with the same result. I also added a little chicken flavor instant bullion instead of salt.

Really simple and really good!  I recommend chicken thighs or chicken breast/thigh mix.  I used breast and it was a bit dry...I prefer shredded chicken pieces over breast chunks.  Also added little more onion and celery (basically 1 cup of each instead of 1/2 cup).  Just me and husband in the house and this recipe lasts us a full week.  If you prefer more broth...just keep some stock on hand to add to the bowl as you re-heat for leftovers!

I made this twice in two weeks, now part of my weekly dinner rotation. It’s a meal that my whole family enjoys, which is hard when you have two picky toddlers! I make as listed. I chop the onions in rings so that I can remove from the kid’s bowls easily and still enjoy myself. It’s also very easy. Thank you for sharing!!!

Meh. Bland, bland, bland. Even after adding several cloves of garlic & extra onion & then poultry seasoning as well. I will have to try another recipe next time.

Great basic recipe! Only changes was adding more veggies since I like a chunkier soup, and using fresh basil since I had some. Also omitted the veggie broth just beause I forgot it.

This basic chicken soup recipe is easy to make and tastes delicious. I made some changes to Mary's original recipe because I didn't want as much oregano or basil in my chicken soup, so I only added 1/4 tsps of oregano and basil instead. I also add about 1 tsp of chopped garlic which I saute with the onion and celery. And, I didn't add beef broth to my chicken soup. I just added chicken broth, which didn't change the taste of the soup that much. And I bought strips of pre-cooked chicken which I cut into small cubes for convenience. I also added 2 cups of egg noodles instead of just 1 1/2 cups. I highly recommend this starter chicken soup recipe.

Sauteed an onion, 4 stalks celery, and 1 gigantic carrot in butter ~5 minutes. Moved the veggies aside and added a little butter, put 1-2lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs in the buttered space, cook 5 minutes per side. Added thyme and garlic powder to spices listed above. Used about 6 cups of broth ("Better than Bouillon") and half a package of extra-wide egg noodles. Simmered x 20 minutes. Took chicken out and cut into cubes. Stirred in some fresh parsley, since I had it on hand. Served with buttered crusty ancient grain bread. Delicious, but could use a little more broth or a little less noodles next time.

This turned out to be a good recipe and a good base. I only changed the noodles to spaghetti because I had so much, and I did sauté the carrots with the onion and celery, along with 2 cloves of minced garlic. I also added several shakes of garlic powder at the end. Since I did not have any pre-cooked chicken on hand but wanted to make this, I followed the procedure in the video for the best chicken noodle soup ever on this site. (Placing the raw chicken in my pot and covering it with cold water until completely submerged, and boiling/simmering that with celery  leaves for about 20-25 min. since I only had about a .75lb boneless skinless chicken breast. Next time I will probably add any combo of dried parsley, a bay leaf, dried thyme, peas, and green onion.

The only thing I added were mushrooms. Yea, I know, mushrooms in chicken noodle soup? Yes!! 
I love mushrooms. I sauteed them with the celery and carrots. Delicious. I will make it again.

great recipe. here's what i changed: 

sauted 2 cloves of garlic, onion, and frozen mixed vegetables in the butter (didn't have fresh celery and carrots); used just chicken broth, no vegetable broth; no basil, so added more oregano, and used fennel seeds, cumin seeds, and peppercorn in addition to salt and pepper; i added raw chicken to the broth, not cooked (added the chicken when the broth was cold, brought it to a boil, and then simmered for 15 min), and i cooked the noodles directly in the broth, too (didn't have egg noodles so used linguine instead). also added a dash of soy sauce and vinegar at the end. turned out pretty good!

I think this would have been a solid 3 star recipe as written, but with a few minor changes it's a 5 star recipe.  I used an entire onion and added a Tbsp of minced garlic when sautéing.  I used two whole chicken breasts cut into bite-size pieces and added them to the sautéed onion, cooking until almost cooked through to allow them to finish cooking in the broth.  At this point I added 10 C of broth (just slightly more than the recipe called for).  In addition to the seasonings which were called for I added about a Tbsp of poultry seasoning, 1/2 tsp of toasted onion powder, 1/2 tsp of roasted garlic powder, 1/2 tsp on parsley, 1/2 tsp of marjoram, 1 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp ground black pepper, 2 bay leaves, and 2 tsp of sriracha (you can't really identify the flavor in the finished product, but it adds soooo much as far as depth of flavor!!!).  I also doubled the carrots and cooked the noodles separately and then added them at them towards the end so that they wouldn't use up all of the broth when they cooked.  Sounds like a lot of changes, but really the basic recipe stayed the same with some adjustments with seasoning.  My family is loving it right now with some crusty bread on a rainy night!

Great recipe with minor changes, cooked my chicken in the pot with the soup. Used chicken stock from a previous dinner. Fresh oregano from the garden. My fiancé and myself are both sick, this felt like a great feel better soup!

This was the best and easiest soup I have ever made! I cooked the chicken beforehand (boneless skinless chicken breasts in the oven), and the chicken still turned out great after cooking the soup. I used the suggested amount of broths but added a little extra carrot and celery, and also extra noodles (about 2 cups) as I don't like super brothy soup. Made it just for myself and can't wait for my lunch tomorrow!

Quick comfort food on a sick day. Perfect use of leftover chicken. If you have it, cook onions in leftover chicken fat & add celery later. Also, cook noodles separately and add at the end. They'll cool the soup off a bit, too, if added when they're cool.

I found this recipe a few years ago.  Love it and it's just as good if not better than soup from scratch!  I buy a cooked chicken from the store and use that.  Everyone at home loves this.  But especially me.  Try it, especially when your a busy person.

I love this recipe, but I always use uncooked chicken, as it flavours the broth a lot more than uncooked. 

Electric pressure cooker instructions: Make sure your uncooked chicken is cut up into small pieces. Instead of cooking on the stove for 20min, cook on high pressure for 5 minutes, and fast release. The veg, chicken, and noodles will be perfectly cooked.

My husband asked if I can make chicken soup bc he's sick and I'm a real beginner cook so when I made this along with using tweaks from the reviews it came out so amazing!!! I'll definitely make this again! Inspires me to cook more! The one thing I added was garlic salt and a little bit of crushed red pepper for that kick!

This is a great recipe for a basic soup. You can easily add any veges you have in the fridge. I added way too much pasta, but that was my bad. Will definitely make this again.

This isn't just my favorite soup recipe, it's one of my favorite recipes, period! It's become a staple in my house. It's tradition to make it every Thursday night - and we have for almost 3 months now. It's delicious and easy to make. 

Thanks for sharing!

LOVE THIS. I seriously just made the best chicken noodle I've ever had. I followed a lot of the recommendations. I added garlic when I made the veggies and used raw chicken rather than cooked. I put some rhyme in along with a little bit of chicken seasoning. I also used half veggie and half chicken broth rather than mostly chicken broth. I made the noodles separate and added them after the soup had been cooking for about 20 minutes. I then cooked for another ten minutes once I added the noodles. It's AMAZING. I added some extra carrots and celery and also used the "No Yolks" brand egg noodles, our fave. Came out freaking delicious. HUGE hit. My one and two years olds gobbled it up!

This was great they way it is but I did make some changes. I use about 8 oz(by weight) of rotisserie chicken. Added minced garlic about a teaspoon with the onions. Up the celery to 1 cup . Last I do 2 cups of noodles. With out these little changes its still almost 5 stars but with them it's 5 stars plus

This was fantastic! I added 1 tsp. of garlic powder to give a little more flavor, and substituted left-over turkey instead of chicken; otherwise followed the recipe as written.

Great basic recipe.  Like Jenski stated, nothing special, but an excellent base recipe.  We added mushrooms (which we saluted in the butter with carrots and celery) and doubled the broth and noodles.  Will make again and experiment with different veggies!

I added zucchini to the veggies. I sautéed all vegetables together, then cooked the chicken. Added veggies first then chicken. Then added the chicken and beef broth and the noodles. Next time I will add a little water because it was pretty thick. But it was delicious!

This was awesome!  I only made a few changes, fried the carrots with celery & onions.  Added poultry seasoning, hot pepper flakes & doubled the amounts for basil & oregano.

Great for the cold days in upstate when the Winter brings the temps to single digits!   Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us all.

I modify this recipe by adding veggies that I have in the fridge and adding seasoning to my tastes. It's nice garnished with fresh Parmesan right before serving.  Great recipe to guide you on your perfect soup quest.

I love this recipe. It is delicious and tastes like a soup that took hours to cook.   I'm about to make it for the fourth time this month! It's super easy when you use a cooked rotisserie chicken.  I keep the pasta separate and added it as needed.  It also freezes well (without the pasta).  Thank you so much for sharing this!

I have been looking for a chicken noodle soup recipe to make for family and friends when they are sick.  This  is just what I needed. It is quick, easy and delicious.  I followed  the suggestions to saute 2 cloves of garlic, 1 cup celery, 1 cup carrots, and 1 cup onions in the butter.  I also used a rotisserie chicken.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I had almost a whole rotisserie chicken in the fridge and it was cold out!  I used sliced baby carrots.  Next time I will add them to the butter/onions/celery to give them a little time to soften up.  I did have to boil the soup a little longer to make sure they weren't crunchy.  I cooked the egg noodles separately and added them and the chicken in the last 10 minutes of cooking.  This was so easy and the flavor was fantastic!  Thanks for this recipe!

I used shredded carrots and sauted it along with the other vegetables. I also cut up chicken strips and sauted them as well. 
     It is the simplest soup to make and my husband enjoyed it much more than other chicken soups I've spent much more time on!

This soup is so easy and delicous! I didn't follow the directions to a T, I fried up the chicken and then tossed all the ingredients (in rough amounts) in a big pot (except noodles) and let it cook for a while, added the noddles in the last 15 min. It turned out awesome!

Nice and easy recipe. Only thing missing is garlic. I added about three cloves. 
I didn't have vegetable broth so I subbed with chicken broth.
Very tasty!

Reminded me of my grandmothers soup. I made this as written except I forgot to sautee the vegetables in the butter. I just added the butter and veggies to the pot and all of the other ingredients, let it summer and it was so delicious. I will make this again. No other chicken noodle soup will do....this is the best! My family loved it too. So hearty and filling.

The best chicken soup I've ever had. I increased all of the veggies to a cup, and used herb de province as my spice, I gave a bowl to my sick husband and he fell asleep right after eating it :)

Excellent!  I think the veggie broth makes all of the difference.  I chose to use organic (non-canned) broth.  That was my only tweak.  We were all knocked out with the flu this week, but I really needed some quick and easy soup.  Even with no appetites, my husband and daughter raved over the taste.  Perfect blend of ingredients and easy to make (even when you are sick).  This will be my go to recipe going forward.

Very good base recipe! A 5 star recipe with the following changes made, suggested by other reviewers. I sauteed the celery, onion, and carrots with a clove of minced garlic in the butter, and added poultry seasoning to the soup. I also added two tablespoons of dissolved corn starch to thicken the broth slightly. Perfect meal to make when you or someone you love is sick with the flu!

Great, simple recipe.  Used some leftover rotisserie chicken to make this, and it was very tasty.  Also upped the veggies in it because I like my soup to be hearty!

This recipe is amazing, I have used leftover turkey, rotisserie chicken, all different noodles to the base and it always turns out amazing - the only extra I add is some garlic. Delicious and super fast, thanks for the great recipe!

Simple and delicious recipe, my husband and kids always have seconds. I usually only have frozen chicken on hand. I'll bake that first and put a small slice of butter on each breast and sprinkle with poultry seasoning. While that's baking I'll chop the vegetables. I took suggestion of other users and sautéed  the onion and celery with the butter and some minced garlic. Sometimes I'll do homemade bread bowls and other times the kids will crumble cheese crackers on top. My go-to recipes for cold weather!

This recipe is simply amazing! I'm 16 and love to cook, so I'm always using technology to my advantage and looking up reviews for recipes I think would be good and I'm pleased to say this one surpassed my expectations! I've making this soup for about a year now, ever since everyone in my family got sick and miserable and wanted some serious comfort food. Since then, I've altered it bit (not much, just adding more vegetables every now and then) and it seems to be getting better every time I make it! I do recommend cooking the celery, onions, and carrots together and for longer but that's for less crunchy vegetables (something I prefer).

We love this recipe.  The only change I made was to use fresh chicken breasts and used additional broth to supplement broth from cooking the chicken breasts.

It was a simple easy recipe and it turned out great! The first time I made it, it was a little thin, so I added a little more chicken and noodles. Other than that it would've been 5 stars.

The recipe was easy and delicious.  I purchased a cooked, rotisserie chicken from the supermarket and added the meat to the soup.  I also added some chopped garlic when I fried the onions and celery.  The soup tasted as though it had been simmering on the stove all day.  Delicious! I will definitely make it again.

My hubby is sick and he doesn't like soup (more of a stew guy) so I had to modify this. I doubled the veggies, minced a large clove of garlic and followed everyone else's advice about sautéing all the veggies. I added extra spices that were recommended in the top review. I only used one carton of chicken broth. I did not precook the chicken. I used 3 cups egg noodles and did not pre-cook them. I added half of a can of cream of chicken soup to thicken it up even more.  It was rich, thick, and chunky...and he loved it. Thanks for the recipe and for all the reviews!

I will definitely make again, but I used elbows and they soaked up all the liquid.  I had to add 2 more cans of broth.  Next time I will use less pasta.

So Good! I used Brown Sugar Girl's version (from the review section) and it was wonderful! I added a can of cream of mushroom soup as the final ingredient and that really made it special. I also used 4 small cans of chicken breast (5 oz. size - drained) ... and that worked very well. This version made 5 small deep dish plastic containers. Definitely a keeper to share with family and friends! Love it ?

I did make a few changes:
1) I bought store bought rotisserie chicken instead to cut down on cook time even more and I added the bones in the broth as well for a richer taste. I shredded the chicken. 
2) I added cilantro at the end when everything was tender and yummy. Just creates another depth of flavor :) 
3) I added 1 box (48 oz) of chicken broth plus a can (14.5 oz) of it and 1 can (14.5 oz) of veg broth. I also added more water into this because of the eggs noodles reducing the broth. 

Overall chicken noodle soup is relatively simple and you don't have to do too much measuring. I didn't follow the recipes measurements and just made a big pot of this soup and it still came out delicious!

I made home made soup today first time making this! I followed the recipe I added a few changes to the chicken like garlic powder a little old bay seasoning powder , parsley and sauté  until cooked . Then added all ingredients to pot except I added 1 tbs of oregano and basil. Also added parsley to the pot I used chicken and beef cubes 6 chicken and three beef. I made a big pot so I did 48oz of chicken broth and added water! There it is we loved it with grillled American cheese sandwich on the side!!

Made this for my family on our first snow day of 2017.  I had never made homemade chicken noodle soup. Since our family has celiac it was super easy to substitute egg noodles for gluten free noodles. The flavor was fabulous. Definitely making this again!!!

I made several changes to this soup as I felt it needed more flavor. My son doesn't like celery, so I just cooked a small stalk in the broth, then removed it. I added Organic Poultry seasoning, Organic salt and Garlic seasoning, and fresh, organic sage from our garden, all to taste. Fan-tastic!

The only changes was to volume, which I simply added a little more of everything.  Very easy to make, and it turned out very nice!  I'm definitely do it again.

Love this soup. I used chicken breast seasoned with Grill Mates Montreal Chicken Seasoning. This is a favorite by all in my family especially during the fall and winter seasons.  Thank you for sharing it with us.

This is super easy and delicious. I didn't have any premade chicken or vegetable broth on hand so I used 8 cups of all chicken broth made from a bouillon paste. Other than that I made the soup as instructed. I used small egg noodles which cooked down quite a bit so next time I'll use broader noodles but the thin noodles were good too. I love this recipe. I had lunch on the table within 1/2 hour. Thanks for sharing.

This was fantastic!  I used a rotisserie chicken and added 1/4 tsp. poultry seasoning.  I also used 3 (32oz each) reduced sodium chicken broth cartons plus 2 cans.  Next time I will just use the cartons and forget the cans.

Exactly as described: Quick & Easy and was nice and tasty too.  I added a pinch more of the herbs to taste and a couple bay leaves.. not sure if that made a difference but it tasted great!  Will make again for sure :-)

It came out wonderfully. Used two boxes of Swanson chicken broth, rotisserie chicken, and big spiral egg noodles,  and probably more veggies than it called for (more broth as well) and it was amazing. I did cook the noodles separately and add them after I got the mix boiling. Perfection. My family devoured it. Oh, and I used twice the butter it called for as well.

I've used this recipe twice, substituting homemade egg noodles only, and it's perfection. So easy, tasty and the leftovers get eaten. 

I add 1 cup of cubed gold potatoes when adding the carrots , and 10 minutes before the finish, I add 1 cup of roughly chopped chunks of kale to make it slightly heartier and healthier.

Delicious! As someone who is not talented in the kitchen this was very easy to make! It even tastes great without chicken if you don't have any. I like to put some garlic powder and magi sauce in mine and its so so good! It's a good base to change up flavours to suit your taste! You can pretty much use any pasta noodles too! I've made this 3 times already and I LOVE IT!!

I will definitely make this again. This recipe is delicious and very forgiving. It came together quickly but tasted like it had simmered all day. A perfect weeknight dinner. The whole family loved it. Next time I'll double the recipe and make it in a big stock pot so we have plenty leftover.

I made this soup for my sick wife. Chicken soup must be the answer. There was a blizzard raging and I did not want to go out for any groceries. I did not have enough chicken stock so I substituted onion soup mix to make up the other half of the broth component. I added some "Slap Ya Mama", a Cajun seasoning mix that includes some cayenne. That gave it some additional flavor that made all the difference. It was delicious and I will make it again. Thanks for the guidance. All Recipes rocks.

We love this recipe! I can't go back to the canned chicken noodle soup b/c I am spoiled on this one! The only thing I changed to it is that I saute all of my veggies, (carrots, onions, and celery) and I add just a little bit of minced garlic. So delicious!!!!!!!! :)

This turned out perfect! I bought a rotisserie chicken, deboned and made a simple broth in the slow cooker the day before, then made this soup out of the broth and chicken. I'm not usually a big soup person, but it turned out great!

This soup was very delicious!! Just what I needed!! Yummo!!
I did make only a cple changes for simplicity and taste. Instead of using all the broths.. I simply used 3 knorr Chicken Bouillons dissolved in hot water and added water in the appropriate amt to substitute for the broths. I also used Parsley instead of Basil only because I dont prefer it. Otherwise I just threw it all into a crock and it was Mm Mm Mm so good!! Thanks for sharing!

This is such a great recipe to use as a base, and add your own little twist on it. I used fresh herbs, a pre-roasted chicken from Sprouts and it was SO good! I also added a little pinch of red pepper flakes at the end and it gave it just the right amount of kick. Try cooking the noodles separately and adding them to the bowls as you serve it, keeps any leftover noodles fresh and not mushy.

Fantastic!!!
We are remodeling our kitchen and I have no cooktop. So I used my electric skillet, browned /cooked chicken breast in skillet, removed, added butter and followed recipes with exception I used thyme  and basil and only chicken broth.
Was floored at how delicious it was. Family loved it.

If you are a soup snob like I am, this soup is for you!  This is the perfect soup to make when you don't have the time to invest but you really really want decent soup.  Made in 15 minutes.  The only thing I added was parsley.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a Great recipe!!  It finally helped me crack the chicken noodle soup flavors I've been looking for.  
I did make a few changes: I sautéed the onions and celery in butter.  For the spices, I used oregano and a dash of thyme (no basil), a bit of garlic powder, and fresh ginger chunks. For the broth, I used only chicken base (no veggie), and shredded/chopped rotisserie chicken.
I will absolutely make this again when I need a quick soup that still has tons of flavor and tastes like it took hours to make!

DELISH.  I used an organic , free range chicken broth and Swanson's vegetable broth. I did add a scoop of Better than Bouillon. It gave the soup a richness that was perfect. I didn't have the spices, so just used some extra pepper or Crazy Jane's Mixed Up Pepper. I will definitely make it again ! Thanks so much !

Fantastic recipe!  Just what I was searching for- flavor, ease & a good soup to take the bite out of our coughs & sniffles.  It's so delicious, I will be stocking the needed ingred. for any more illnesses. My only additions were 1/2 can of cream of chicken and green onion, added after it was nearly cooked.  2nd night I threw in a bag of mixed veggies.  FYI this was my first chicken noodle soup.  As others, I always let soup simmer longer to meld flavors. No need to look any further.  5 stars because it's simple enough to get done when the cook is feeling under the weather.

This was really good!    I doubled the recipe.      Based on the other reviews, I did sauté the garlic and onions before adding.   I also used a precooked roasted chicken and just dumped the entire thing and its juices into the broth.   I would do that differently the next time.... shred before adding to the broth.   I also followed some other advice regarding no salt chicken broth - 1 of each.

The question I ask after making this is why would you ever bother making chicken noodle soup from scratch when this recipe is so good?  Made it in a half hour or so from start to finish and it got raves from everyone.  Served with a multigrain batard...very tasty!

Great simple recipe....I sautéed the chicken in the same pot, so all the good yummy bits added a lot of flavor to the soup. Also added about 1 TBSP of minced garlic & sautéed them with the onions & celery.  Will be cooking this again!

I made some small alterations: used low sodium chicken broth, used 2 cans of chicken, and added chopped kale.   The sodium in the veggie broth and canned chicken made it just salty enough that I did not add any extra salt.  The canned chicken falls apart into shredded pieces and distributes throughout. So good!

Cooked onions, celery and carrots in butter.  used 1 box of chicken stock and 2 cans of vegetable broth.  Added more veggies than called for in the recipe. Also added a little garlic powder because I didn't have any garlic. Next time, I will cook garlic along with veggies. Boiled 2 cups of noodles in water before adding to soup.

This is the best and easiest recipe I have come across.  I use Mrs. Miller's Old Fashioned Wide Egg Noodles.  I make this at least twice a month and love the amount of leftovers I can refrigerate/freeze for lunches.

Quick and easy chicken noodle soup.
I utilized low sodium chicken stock and some Better Than Bouillon chicken base instead of vegetable stock, as we were looking for relief from a nasty cold.
This paired nicely with this easy dumpling recipe. I made the noodles on the side in 8 minutes and made the dumplings in the soup.

I added double the seasonings and added 1/4 tsp of Tumeric. It added a touch of Mediterranean taste without overpowering the original taste. I also used a rotisserie chicken to make it easier. Delish

This was a great base recipe to start from but it definitely needs a few extra ingredients to feel like a complete meal. I added parsley, vegetable oil, and garlic. That definitely kicked it up a notch. I also used gnocchi instead of noodles for a little italian kick. This is a great starting recipe though!

Easy, fast and delicious.  My suggestion: Cook the noodles separately, toss with very little butter, just so they don't stick together, and keep them in the refrigerator until you are going to use the soup.  Add them just to get them hot.  That way the noodles don't get mushy, and the broth doesn't get cloudy.  Obviously, very easy to reheat everything in the microwave.

We really enjoyed this soup! The only changes I made was to skip tbe vegetable broth and use all chicken broth. I seasoned the boneless skinless chicken breast with olive oil, salt, pepper and poultry seasoning and baked them until done. The poultry seasoning added an eXtra zest to to the  soup. Thank you for the recipe, it's a keeper for us!!

Literally quick and easy chicken noodle soup! It's a basic recipe and perfect for when you aren't feeling well. I used store bought chicken stock and     cooked chicken breasts. I also added some poultry seasoning, but otherwise followed recipe as is. Definitely will be my go to recipe when I don't have time or feel up to making chicken soup from scratch!

Made it Vegan!  My daughter is a vegan and was sick.  So I made this for her just subbing vegetable broth, omitting the chicken, and adding some green beans to the carrots, celery and onions.  I also used little short spaghetti instead of egg noodles.  It was wonderful and a real keeper.

Loved this soup! I made a few changes, used vegetable broth for half the water, some chicken stock, no bouillon cubes.  More  celery, onion, carrots and let family add more salt or pepper to their taste. I would make again.

Delicious!  This super easy recipe fit me fine because I don't know how to cook.  I was super excited to make my own chicken noodle soup instead of constantly buying it from restaurants.  The only thing that I did not add was the salt and pepper because I don't usually eat or add much of either in and to my food.  I also added another can of chicken broth because I 'm supposed to be on a liquid diet due to mild achalasia.  This was really easy to make.  I just made it a few minutes ago and just ate not one but two bowls.  My husband, who always does the cooking and is very picky, tried it and liked it.  I'm a happy camper because thanks to you I made some delicious soup that not only I like but my husband also likes!

Delicious and easy, be careful with how long egg noodles cook.  We really loved this dish as a quick, satisfying meal. We used a rotisserie prepared chicken from the grocery store and some sodium reduced broth. After making a few times, we have found to enjoy it best when the broth has simmered, and we cook the noodle in it, last before serving. This way, the noodles don't get too over cooked and continue to soak up all the delicious broth. With a crusty baguette, this was a great soup dinner that the whole family enjoyed.

This recipe truly is quick and easy. I'm a veggie lover tho so I would suggest adding more carrots and celery. It makes the soup more filling and of course healthier.

I have made this a few times.  The only changes were I added chopped celery and used fresh fettuccine cut into 2 inch strips put in last, just to warm.  So good.

Great and easy recipe. Really make sure your onions and celery are soft enough before adding everything else. Also, some cayenne and garlic salt really add a good kick.

I substituted rotini for egg noodles. I realized a little too late that we didn't have any oregano on hand and used an Italian seasoning instead, and added a bit of parsley. Almost doubled the amount of celery , added a cup of carrots, and shredded the chicken. Next time I may forgo the salt, but I like this recipe overall. It was my first time making it and this was a good guide.

I made this today, cause i am coming down with a cold. just scrumptious! i altered mine a bit. i added some minced garlic to the celery and onions. I also prefer 'No Salt Added' chicken broth. The vegetable broth i used was organic, and was 23% sodium, but i used that anyways. I added some lemon pepper seasoning to mine also.  totally delicious. xDDD

I made this and used a cup of celery and one cup of onions instead of the half cup like other reviewers did. My dad, my son, and I were all sick so I wanted some soup and I tried this since most of the soups that I liked they discontinued and this soup is fan freaking tastic. I over peppered it a bit, but no one seemed to mind lol I love pepper anyway.

Also, forgot to add, I sautéed the veggies in olive oil instead of butter. Much healthier and you can't tell the difference.

I took the advice of previous comments and sauted the carrots with celery and onion and garlic. I seasoned with salt,pepper, garlic salt, oregano, and a pinch of tyme since I had no bay leaves at home. I also used my own seasoned chicken stock and store vegetable stock. Very easy recipe to make, and tasty.

So easy. So quick. So good. Hubby said he was coming home... 30-40 minutes away. That's when I started prep. It was done cooking when he walked in the door. I used a grocery store rotisserie chicken and just the breast meat. I added the juices from that chicken into the chicken and vegetable broth. Only thing I added was a little chicken bouillon and some water because the vegetable broth seemed to alter the chicken flavor too much. Also, I didn't measure my dry ingredients. I eyeballed the herbs, carrots, celery and onion. I think I used less onions and celery then called for because hubby doesn't like too much onion. This recipe is a keeper.

This is so delicious and fail-proof. I have used it to bless a friend who lost her husband, another with a new baby, and to nourish my family on "soupy" kind of days. :) I do usually double the veggies, but you can do so much with this base. We have enjoyed it with browned ground beef, leftover grilled pork or chicken, etc. And I only used veg broth once as chicken is always around- didn't make a big difference. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Perfect quick and easy home made soup for a sick member of the household or a cold day!  It is easily adjustable to put your own twist on the recipe! I sautéed my veggies first with minced garlic and that was about the only change I made! Thank you :)

Amazing dish. Although I though the chicken quantity was a bit excessive. Will definitely make it again.

I  made this for my husband recently when he got sick with a bad cold. He loved it so much he brought all the leftovers to work to eat for breakfast and lunch. I did change a few things I added a little minced garlic. I also added more noodles and a little more chicken broth and I used a rotisserie chicken and poured in the leftover juices for extra flavor. I will be making this recipe in the future it's a winner in my household.

This recipe is GREAT!! I had to give it 4 stars because I like more broth. I used two 32 ounce containers of chicken broth and one can of vegetable broth and my family felt as though we still could use more. I also cooked the noodles a little more than half way though separately and then added it to the simmering pot just so I wasn't using all of the broth to cook the noodles. I used a rotisserie chicken and added as much chicken as I felt was good enough. Thank you for the recipe!!

I followed others' recommendations and cooked carrots,onions, celery and garlic in butter.  Added 1 pound of cut up raw chicken when I added the broths plus the spices. Added a little bit of poultry seasoning to the mix of spices. Also cooked the noodles separately and added at end for additional five minutes of simmering.  Kids loved it and my husband too. Thanks for the recipe and others' recommendations.

It was a little bland following the recipe.  I ended up using a rotisserie chicken and dumping the juice into the pot along with the stock.  I added a teaspoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon of lime juice and then a couple squrts of siracha.  

These additions greatly expanded the floor profile of the soup.

Thanks for a good base recipe!

This was a great and easy recipe!  I used a rotisserie chicken.  I added garlic to the onion and celery.  I added more noodles than the recipe called for because we like a lot of noodles so I might add another can of chicken broth.  Very good and better the next day!  Helps make anyone feel better!

I added more carrots and used 2 stalks green onion. It was a good, quick recipe. I had prepared the chicken initially using  a quick cook recipe called How To Cook Moist & Tender Chicken Breasts Every Time from the web site
thekitchn.com.

It was great! The only thing I different was brine a whole chicken with salt, dark brown sugar and fresh herbs then I boiled the chicken and made my own broth.  I sautéed the carrots and celery with the onions and I added minced garlic to that. This recipe is a great base to help you build flavors.

I've made this several times and my family really enjoys it.  I rarely have leftover cooked chicken so I poach a chicken breast in water to 160 and use the water and Better Than Bouillon for the broth.

This recipe was very easy and produced a fairly standard chicken noodle soup. I did have to add about twice as much liquid as the recipe called for, so that my soup was actually soup. I might make it again, but perhaps add a little lemon and garlic, just to be daring!

Delicious and so easy! I use gluten free spaghetti and everyone loves it. I've used chicken breast, canned chicken, and rotisserie chicken before and the soup is great each time. The house smells incredible when I make it, too.

I was craving homemade chicken soup as I was sick. I made the soup as Brown Sugar Girl suggested. I did not have the cans of chicken broth on hand so I substituted it with a 32 oz container of Low Sodium Chicken broth and chicken broth granules with added water  to taste. I also added 1 teaspoon of Herbes de Provence,  1 teaspoon dried oregano and 1/2 teaspoon basil. I seasoned with Kosher salt and pepper to taste. I cooked bow tie pasta separately and added the soup to the bowl when serving. It came out delicious. Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing and the suggestions.

Very good comfort food.  I followed the recipe however I did add garlic and kale.  Sauteed the garlic, kale in butter before adding the onions ( ( substituted green onions for regular) then added the rest of the veggies.  Very easy meal to give someone in need of a comforting soft meal and any meal that you can hide a super food in is worth it to make in my book.

OMG! Let me tell you, I have always been a canned soup kinda gal.  I've never liked homemade chicken noodle soup. UNTIL NOW! I made this today and I have to say it is Fantastic and Flavorful! I followed Brown Sugar Girl's lead and sauteed the onions, garlic, celery and carrots in the butter.  Then put cut up raw chicken in the broth with oregano, basil, poultry seasoning, ground thyme, pepper and a dash of salt.  I used the box chicken broth and box vegetable stock.  I found the broth to be a little too clear for me and needed more umph! So I added two extra large chicken bouillon cubes and it turned out fabulous!! Added wide egg noodles at the end of cooking time! Will definitely be making this again!!

I made this when my youngest was sick with a bad cold a few weeks ago. I only had frozen carrot coins so I used those. I actually saluted the onion in the butter and then used better than base chicken to make the stock. Added the stock to the onions and butter, and incorporated in the carrots, celery, herbs, and a chicken breast. Simmered it all for three hours on the stove, covered. Shredded the chicken breast in the stock and added in the noodles. Cooked for another 10 minutes until the noodles were done. Used all of the ingredients the recipe called for and this soup hit the spot. You will have to add more stock as you see fit to make it more or less soupy and cook the noodles. Delicious! Tons of flavour. Will be making again. Thank you!!

My husband really enjoyed this soup.  It was very tasty but I cooked the egg noodles too long. Next time I won't put them in till about 15 minutes before we eat.   They got a bit overcooked.  Otherwise I followed directions except I didn't add oregano as it didn't sound good to me and I cut down on the basil.  It was yummy.  I will definitely make it again.

it's a nice base to start with. I wish I would've read reviews before preparing. I would have tried garlic cloves. personal suggestion don't be shy with salt, or as a substitute try soy sauce. I suggest 1/8 cup.

This is a great recipe. Very easy to make.  We didn't add celery (yuck), and added lots of veggies including green beans, potatoes, and corn.  Gets better the following day after you make it.  My family, including 3 girls loved this soup and I will use the recipe again!

I added garlic with the onions and celery. WAY to much broth for the soup BUT my husband loved it with the changes I made.  Without the added noodles I put in, the soup is too thin.  I will also add more chicken next time too.  I saved the excessive broth and will use in another soup.

I have made this several times since finding the recipe on FB a few weeks ago.  My family LOVES it!  Frankly, I can't think of any chicken noodle soup I like more.

I tend to add a little extra chicken, carrots and noodles, just because I like my soup a little meatier.

The taste is spot on!!

This recipe will be on our list forever!

Very easy to make and very good dish.  Be careful to not add too much seasoning.   I used a pre-roasted chicken and was a nice addition to the dish

I have made this twice now and just LOVE it! Even my picky kids ate some. I made the recipe as written except I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the veggies at the saute point. I used my mini food processor to chop the onion and celery and went ahead and used it to dice the carrot up finely as well. I thought the kids might be more willing to eat it if the carrots weren't in large slices. I used 4 oz of Inn Maid noodles. Delicious on a cold winter day!

I found this recipe to be very easy and my oldest enjoyed helping me make it. The only thing I changed was instead of using chicken breast I used chicken drumsticks that I boiled and cut up so I could take the skin off. I would definitely make this again.

The problem was that it lacked the strong chicken flavor you get if you make your own stock with the chicken bones.  To solve that, I added 2 1/2 packet of chicken powdered bouillon to the broth and voila, it drastically improved the flavor and it gave it some depth. The bouillons that I use already has sodium so I didn't need any salt.  I added some bay leaves, fresh thyme, and 1/2 teaspoon of marjoram. I also included fresh macerated garlic; which is nature's antibiotic. This is the perfect prescription for the common cold and very comforting for those cold winter days.

Such a quick, easy, flexible recipe. I had some leftover roasted chicken I wanted to use up. I sliced baby carrots in half lengthwise. Next time, I would leave them whole because I thought they got too soft. I was very loose with the seasonings, did not measure, just through in a few teaspoons of everything. I did not have enough veggie and chicken broth, so I boiled the noodles separately in water so they did not soak up too much broth, then tossed them in while the soup simmered. Amazing how good this tasted for how easy it was, and tasted great as leftovers for several days. It made a good sized pot of soup.

my husband told me if I made that every night he would be happy.  which is a big YAY! for me...  he had thirds lol.  I did change two things due to availability.. I didn't have celery so I used a green pepper and I added Cheyenne pepper and it gave it a bite that he loved.  it was done in 20 minutes which was nice too.  easy to follow instructions.

Very good for a quick and easy soup.  Tastes even better after overnight in the fridge and reheated.  I increased the celery and carrots and cooked them in some broth with the onions on med-high heat for 10 minutes to soften them before adding the other ingredients.  I increased the noodles but added them in the last 10 minutes.  I also added a bay leaf, a tsp of lemon peel and a tablespoon of lemon juice, which nicely enhances the flavor.

Made this tonight. I did change it up a bit. Cooked the chicken in the oven instead, made my broth from scratch and threw the butter in with the broth instead of using to brown the celery and onions, from then own followed the recipe. I give it two thumbs up!

I love that it is so quick and basic.  I added about a tablespoon chicken bolllion for more of a chicken soup flavor. Next time I'll add more chicken, one more can of chicken broth, and possible rice instead of egg noodles. I did not add the egg noodles we  cooking. Cooked them on the side and before refrigerating I added what I wanted of the noodles to the soup and stored it all together.

Followed everything in the  wonderlicious review and directions except I used two 32oz boxes of chicken broth and I used more than a cup of carrots and celery .  I also used 1 can cream of onion and one can cream of chicken after I added  the 16oz bag of egg noodles.  Bring to a boil and  then simmer for 15-20.  Yummy

This was so easy and delicious! My young son ate 3 bowls in one sitting! I added garlic, sautéed the carrots with celery, added broccoli  near the end of simmer time. I also used raw chicken on the bone for added flavor to the stock, once cooked I removed the chicken on the bone and shredded the meat. It helps to cook  noodles seperate  and add when serving to reduce starch and soggy noodles! Added to my favorites!

This soup turned out great with only minor changes.  Added 5 cloves of garlic and sauteed with veggies before adding other ingredients. Used 4 cups chicken stock, 2 cups vegetable stock and the flavor was spot on.  Used gluten-free spaghetti noodles instead of egg noodles for dietary reasons, and the end result was really good, did not miss the egg noodles at all.

So last night was New Years eve and my mom and I were sick. I decided to spend the evening with her and make some chicken noodle soup. It was a hit! Even the people who weren't sick wanted some. I did soften the veggies and added some garlic and cooked the noodles separately. Needless to say we will NEVER do canned soup again!

Both of my children happily ate this. My daughter asked why the soup was so good. My son commented the soup was incredibly good. The only change I made was I added three cloves of crushed garlic.

really good.  I make in crock pot, so i do it all the same except i use a whole cooked chicken i shred into it.   i also add more broth.  Also after the 8 hours i cook it in the crock pot I turn the crock pot off and then I add the noodles.   i let it cool and the noodles cook for about an hour then we eat.   so delicious.  :-)   thanks for the great starter recipe it really is tasty.

My husband and I like it, and it was good.  I was going to add minced garlic but forgot. I will make it again.  I am rating it only 4 stars because of the prep time. A minute to melt the butter, 5 minutes to saute the celery and onion, 20 minutes to simmer, that's 26 of the 30 minutes.  It took about 5-10 mins just to bring the soup to a boil.  Where is the time spent chopping the vegetables and chicken?  Total time was more like 45 to 60 minutes start to finish.

This was the best chicken noodle soup I've ever had! Campbell and Progresso soup have weird chicken chunks with tubes on them that disgust me and they're so high in sodium so I've stayed away from them. I've always wanted to make my own soup, I didn't know it would be so easy. As far as changes go, I used 1 cup of celery and 1 cup of carrots, because I love my soup "chunky". The egg noodles I purchased were non yolk and I ended up putting 2 cups of  noodles in. Next time I'll probably put less noodles in I think they absorbed too much of the broth and after 6 bowls of soup there's many noodles left washed up on the beach without broth. Anyways, loved this recipe. I live by myself so I pretty much ate chicken noodle soup for a week haha. Thank you so much!

Absolutely amazing! 
I didn't change anything else except that I added some garlic to the onions as I sautéed them. Other than that, I added a cup more noodles and it was stunning. 
Next time, I'm going to try some homemade broth.

This was delicious!  I cooked the chicken breasts in a crock pot for about 2 hours until they were easy to shred.  I did double the amount of noodles and I still will probably put in more next time.  This was very easy to make and we will definitely make it again.

My kids (age 7 and 9) love this soup.  I've made it twice now exactly as directed.  I start it on the stove and throw it in the crock pot so it's hot when we get home from our after school sports.  I keep the noodles separate and add them into each bowl individually.

Kids love it and if you can make a pot to give away to a loved one for no other reason other than you love them, they will never forget it. Its been saved and printed for my own children. Thank you for sharing!

I doubled the recipe. I started with uncooked, cubed chicken (about 1.5 lbs.) that I browned with the onions. Also added minced garlic at this step. Added a tsp. each of poultry seasoning and dried thyme. Used frozen egg noodles that I cooked in the soup. Almost as good as my much more complicated, takes all day, from scratch chicken noodle soup. Will definitely make this again.

This was wonderful, and smelled amazing while cooking. I substituted 4 cups worth of chicken broth with chicken stock to make it a bit heartier. The flavor was very natural and clean. The cooking itself was very simple. I was honestly worried about the noodles being overcooked in the end, but they came out perfect! I would most certainly make this again.

Extremely forgiving recipe. My gluten tolerance isn't what it used to be so I have made this once with egg noodles, as well as once without the noodles. To sub no noodles I just doubled the chicken and upped the veggies by about 1/4 cup. Each time I made this, I used left over whole rotisserie chickens and just chopped the meat to bite size pieces. I also subbed the one can of veggie broth with a can of water b/c I usually only keep chicken broth stocked in my kitchen.  Delicious!

Mmmm, so yummy!  I did cook onion, celery, and  carrots first like someone else suggested....and also added garlic.  I cooked my noodles by themselves and just added when I was ready to eat the soup.  I have tried a bunch of different "easy chicken noodle soup" recipes and this is definitely one I will make again, and again, and again! Mmmm! loved it!

Excellent base recipe. What I did different is diced up 2 cloves of garlic and sauteed it with the celery and onions. Made a big pot of it for my family. We'll be eating off of it for the next few days.

It was pretty easy, but not super full of flavor, even though I used my homemade chicken broth.  Next time I will probably add some garlic and more seasoning, plus more onion.  Over all it was a good basic noodle soup

Yum! I have been battling terrible sinusitis for a week and have been craving home made chicken soup.. Every attempt I have made at chicken soup in the past has been bland, but this effort was amazing! I followed others suggestions and sauteed the onions with garlic, then the chicken then the veg.. I brought to the boil then simmered for 15 mins and added the egg noodles separately.  Perfect! Will be my go to recipe when craving something healthy and warm :)

I thought it turned out really well. The only change I made was using 6 chicken bouillon cubes  along with water for my broth and a half can of leftover vegetable stock.

I changed egg noddles for gluten free noddles and increased the number of servings to 10. My son is 18 and he liked it so much he has requested that I make this again, only a few weeks after I made it the first time. To be honest I only made it the first time because I had leftover noodles and chicken and needed a new way to serve them. This recipe was perfect. My 1 1/2 yr old granddaughter even liked the carrots, noodles, chicken and other stuff in the soup that she could eat with her hands.

I love this recipe because it's SO forgiving!  Don't like basil?  Leave it out!  Want extra oregano?  Throw some in!  My tips - definitely saute the vegetables in some butter or oil first.  It adds extra flavor to the veggies and reduces the amount of simmering time.  Before adding the broth, I put in a couple spoonfuls of flour and make a roux, stirring really well so all the flour is mixed in and no white remains.  It thickens up the soup a little without having to add any creaminess to it.  I also throw in a couple of bay leaves and a few dashes of poultry seasoning.  I am not a fan of egg noodles, so I usually just small shells instead.   I've also used ditalini, rings, mini bow ties.  Really, any small noodle will work. I've even used rice in place of pasta though.  Just make sure you cook the rice ahead of time otherwise it will literally absorb all the liquid.  As I said, a very forgiving recipe.  Play around with it and add whatever you like!

I am recuperating from surgery and am on a very restricted diet and chicken soup sounded so good!  My better half and I knocked out the chopping and the soup is in the stove simmering.  It smells good and is the first time I have actually been hungry in three weeks.  I made the recipe as required but substituted olive oil for the butter since I can't have any dairy for a while. My verdict: This soup is good!  I will put in some garlic next time.

Very Good!!!  I made with 2 1/2 cups noodles, 1 cup celery, 1 cup carrots, 1/2 cup peas, no basil (didn't have any), needs a little more salt and pepper imo.  So good, will make from now on.

Followed advice from some others, and added my own:
(1) In melted butter, sauté 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 cup chopped onion, 1 cup chopped celery, and 1 cup sliced carrots. 
(2) Add whole rotiserie chicken, 48 oz low-sodium chicken brother, 24 oz regular chicken broth, 14 oz veggie broth, basil, oregano, pepper, a dash or two of poultry seasoning, a bay leaf, and a pinch or two of dried thyme to the pot of veggies. 
(3) Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 15 minutes. 
(4) Remove whole chicken and add meat back in. Add wonton noodles cut into strips. Simmer 5-10 minutes.

I used Olive Oil instead of butter and sauteed 3 cloves of garlic too to start.  I also used Dreamfields Penne pasta instead of egg noodles to cut the carbs and cholesterol...a new family favorite!

I followed this recipe as written and it turned out great! It made enough for dinner, lunch and to drop a bowl off to family. I plan to make more and freeze it for all the flu's to come! I wouldn't make any changes, the flavor was great.

Absolutely!!!!  I made this because my ill 4 year old claimed that everyone knows you can only feel better if you eat "homemade chicken noodle soup."  Super easy and delicious!!!  I added a little garlic, caramelized onions and garlic before adding celery, and bumped up the celery and carrots.  This is definitely a go-to!

This is a great recipe for what it is. Quick and simple. My boyfriends brother came over after work with a terrible cold and I was able to whip this up in no time.  I added a couple tablespoons of Better Than Bullion roast chicken flavor because we didn't have any chicken broth. I also added 1/2 a tablespoon of minced garlic because we are garlic lovers.  I will definitely keep this in mind for when I'm in a pinch.

Loved it.  My 15-year-old son has the chore of making dinner this week.  He made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious.  He used leftover rotisserie chicken.  We like it chunky, so he added 1/2 cup more noodles than the recipe calls for, and nearly double the chicken.  Everything else was exactly as this recipe calls for.  Simply awesome.  We had it with garlic bread and salad.  A hearty, filling meal.

The original recipe was too bland. The changes I made: I cooked the carrots first then threw in the celery and onions. The last minute I added 3 cloves of minced garlic. Then added all the broths, seasoning and uncooked chicken breasts. Once chicken was cooked I took them out  & added 4 cups of egg noodles to the boiling water and began cutting up the chicken into 1/2" cubes. Once the noodles were almost done I added the chicken back in and added a can of cream of mushroom to thicken the soup and let it simmer.

AMAZING! I made mine with Italian seasoning instead of just Oregano and Basil. I also added in a can of condensed cream of chicken, minced garlic, and garlic powder in addition to following directions from the best tipper. Growing up my mom made soup all of the time, but nothing like this!

This was great! In a Dutch oven, I used 1 tbsp butter, a whole bag of carrots & celery, a whole white onion, celery leaves, fresh basil & fresh oregano from my garden, 2 chix bullion cubes, a shake of chix seasoning rub & lots of salt & pepper. I diced up a pound of chix tenderloins. I actually took the advice of another reviewer, and put all ingredients in the pot, cooked til it boiled. Then reduced heat to a simmer covered for 20 min. Cooked my egg noodles seperate. This has great flavor if you SEASON. Or add some veggies to your stock/broth if you're cooking veggies separate. I will be making this again & again seeing how easy this was. Thanks for submitting:)

Use a rotisserie chicken from the store for added ease.  Also, I find 2 or 3 bay leaves sets it off!

I made this recipe just as it was written except I added more noodles (we like noodles). It was great. My family loved it, even my son who never eats anything new!

I didn't have any vegetable broth, so I used just the chicken broth and some water.  Then I added a chicken bullion cube.    We weren't crazy about the seasonings though - ok (oregano & basil).

I made the soup to the letter except I used a lemon rotisserie chicken from Walmart and pulled the skin off.  My family loved it!  I will definitely Mae it again!

If you have never made chicken noodle soup before, this is the one to try. It's super simple and easy to adapt to flavor preferences. This is a hearty soup that took no time at all.

I used only chicken broth, upped the veggies, chicken, and noodles.  I also added garlic.  I am glad I did, I prefer a thicker soup and feel like it would have been mostly broth otherwise.  It's delicious.

Fabulousness!!!!!!  I started by sautéing the celery carrots seasoning blend and I added a tablespoon of garlic. I also used the low sodium chicken broth. I find that the veggie broth makes it so much . I cooked my chicken on the side then added it in. I also served my noodles as needed. I didn't add them to the pot. I put a little butter in them so they won't stick. Aside from that this is a Big Hit in our home!!!! Absolutely love it! !!

I followed the recipe and it turned out wonderful! I over-cooked the egg noodles because I'm still learning but it gave it a creamy texture that was like chicken pot pie filling. It was delicious! My hubby was very impressed!

This was an easy, simple meal.  I mean, I was able to make it.  I added garlic with the veggies.  It was a perfect warming dinner for fall/winter time.

I woke up this morning with a cold. When I feel one coming on, all I want to eat is chicken noodle soup. I don't really like all the sodium in canned soups and soup mixes so I decided to make my own. I found this recipe and thought it would be relatively simple to make. After looking at some of the other reviews, I decided to alter it a bit. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the onions and celery while sautéing them. I added enough chicken broth to equal 5 cans, thus omitting the veggie broth. Chicken broth adds so much more flavor. I had some poached chicken breast in the freezer but not enough so I added one 12 oz. can chicken breast. I also added a bay leaf and some Herbs de Provence along with the oregano and basil. During the last few minutes it was simmering, I added some frozen green peas as I like them in chicken soup. It turned out wonderful and really hit the spot.

I used equal amounts of low salt chicken and vegetable broths.  Didn't have oregano so left it out. The leftover chicken I was going to use was dry so I didn't use it. Guess what? This was the best chicken soup I have ever made! Never missed the chicken. I just used more noodles to compensate. This won't last long and I definitely plan to make it again! So easy and done in 30 minutes.

Guess it was more a veggie chicken noodle soup. But SO good!

Great soup.  Didn't have celery, but read other reviews and added 2 cloves of garlic chopped fine and sautéed them with the carrots and onions.  Didn't have vegetable stock so just used chicken stock and added a bit of water.  Also added some fresh rosemary chopped fine from the garden, so delicious.  I will definitely make it again.  A great base to use with your own additions if you wish.

First let me apologize...I did not make this but it is so close to the recipe I use I thought I would mention the differences in case anyone wanted to try. Instead of chicken breast I use a whole chicken raw and cook it in broth or use a cooked rotisserie chicken. Also I do not use vegetable broth...try beef broth. If you don't have egg noodles I use any small pasta or break up spaghetti or linguini. You can also add a pack of chicken noodle soup mix to boost flavour. I hope some of these give you new ideas...Keep Cookin!!!

Wonderful recipe I make often when someone is ill or needs some basic comfort.  When I use a rotisserie chicken, I remove most of the meat, then use the flavored skin, wings @bones  which I place in my dutch oven with some broken celery rough chopped onion and some hacked up carrot which I bring to a boil with a carton of chicken stock and some water to cover the bones.  Turn down to a simmer for one hour and strain.  Add the fresh veg, discarding the broth ones and simmer till tender.  I like to keep my noodles cooked and stored separately  so they don't absorb all the broth esp. when stored  or frozen adjust seasonings add 1 tsp sugar...makes a huge difference in rounding out flavor.  If not made for sickies I sometimes give the soup an indian flare with curry powder and cumin.  Other times I do oriental with soy, sesame oil,oyster sauce and add bok choy, baby corn etc. low sodium everything .

I add a tablespoon of tomato paste to broth for a richer and tastier flavor.  Also if you save the rinds from fresh parm cheese, add one to the pot while the soup simmers for an added zest!

This was an easy and tasty recipe. I personally prefer more "body" to my chicken noodle soup so I used slightly less broth and slightly more noodles. Everything else I did as called for in the recipe. I used low sodium chicken broth because it's what I had and it was a little bland so I would recommend using regular broth and maybe a little more seasoning than called for.

Super easy, super tasty. I got the basil and garlic rotisserie chicken from grocery store and just used swansons chicken broth then fresh carrots, celery, basil, carrots and onion. Sauteed carrots with onion first in olive oil then added the rest, brought to a boil then let simmer on low for about 30 mins and PERFECTION. Froze a bunch of it too in little tupperware which made it super easy grab and go lunches.

This recipe definitely lives up to its name, and it's delicious too!  I followed other reviewers' advice and cubed uncooked chicken, which I then added to the soup along with the broth and spices.  I let it simmer for 20 minutes, then added the noodles and simmered an additional 10 minutes.  Super easy.

Thanks MARYVM!  Have not rated a recipe before, but just had to for this one.  Just got off a plane from Palm Springs CA and wasn't feeling quite up to par a few days later.  Thought chicken soup would help.  DH was going to take me out for dinner, but I really wanted this so we ran to store to get ingredients.  It cooked up great!  I added spices to our tastes.......garlic, more oragano, basil, poultry seasoning etc., the house smells great, but more importantly I feel so much better!    Thanks for a great recipe it made the Chicago weather even in April much more livable!

We loved it!  I had raw chicken pieces thawed from the freezer so I followed the directions and after the broth was added to the pot, I put the chicken in the pasta strainer insert so the chicken could simmer in the broth.  Once the chicken was cooked, I pulled out the strainer and let the chicken cool before I shredded it and added it back to the pot.  The broth was flavorful and the chicken was tender - delicious!!

BEST SOUP EVER!  I will never eat chicken noodle soup from a can again!  I doubled the veggies and the seasoning amounts.  I also added garlic, carrots, a 29 oz can of sweet corn, 3.5 cups rotisserie chicken (mostly breast and some thigh), and other seasons (garlic salt, onion pepper, bay leaf, lemon pepper).  It took a LOT of salt to give it flavor for some reason, but it ended up great.  My soup came out as more of a stew consistency, but I like it that way.

Love !!! I make this often & I just tried it W/ rotisserie (thanks to other reviewers!) SO much better & SO much easier!!! Delicious ! Only thing I do different is add more garlic & double the veggies. I use all chicken broth, 1/2 low sodium & 1/2 regular , no salt needed. Just Xtra pepper and I use whole wheat egg noodles  . You would never notice the difference, I add them 10 minutes before serving. I don't find an issue with them loosing their spiral after couple of days - still Delicious !!!!

I loved this simple but very tasty recipe! Made a few changes by using a rotisserie chicken, sautéed the onions, carrots and added 2 cloves of garlic. Added everything together then the last ten minutes added the noodles. I thought could use more vegetables at first but came out fine with what's called for. My three old son was sick and had most ingredients on hand already, him and my husband loved it! A nice cozy quick soup. Will definitely make again!

I used frozen vegetables and canned potatoes, as well as frozen grilled chicken chunks and still, probably the best stew I ever made.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the soup, by recipe, is a little bland and needs more Oregano and Basil.  I also found that a bit of Garlic, or Garlic powder help.  But overall, a great flavored and super simple chicken soup.

Love this recipe, have made it a few times, always with garlic.  It is extra awesome with homemade chicken stock!  Its worth it people believe me, and not hard with a crock pot.

This was a great recipe! I was looking for something basic to start with and modify to my own tastes and this was it. I wasn't feeling well and wanted to make some chicken soup but obviously wasn't feeling like slaving over the stove all day.  It went together quickly and easily and I saved time by using pre-cut carrot chips.  The only thing I did spend time on was deboning the rotisserie chicken I used instead of canned chicken - and I'm glad that I did, it was more flavorful than canned would have been.  Great recipe!

Excellent!   It took no time at all...more time chopping and slicing than actual cooking.  My daughter came home sick from school, and I was able to make this in no time at all.  I'm sure it is just what the doctor ordered!  Also, I substituted chicken thighs and used gluten-free pasta, and it was delicious!

So easy to fix. Used breast meat from roasted chicken but added twice as much as in recipe. House smells great as it's simmering now. My husband having it for dinner with rolls and butter.  Healthy and easy dinner!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Got a cold funk & just knew a good ole chicken noodle soup recipe would do the trick!  First time making this and it was EASY and very good.  I added salt & other spices as I went along and just tasted to get the proper flavor for me and my fella.  I did not have enough chicken broth so I used equal parts chicken & veggie broth plus one cup water. (2 14.5 cans ea plus 1 cup H20) may be why not so salty as a few other reviewers mentioned. We both loved it!  Thank you!

I didn't use canned broth however, I used the homestyle condensed broth packets from knorr, but fantastic mix of it all.

Hubby wasn't feeling well and requested Chicken Noodle soup, but not the can version. That's was all good, just one problem I never made homemade soup. I found this recipe on pinterest and it was totally easy and a hit with hubby. I read the reviews and incorporated their tips (added mince garlic and sautéed carrots with the other vegetables, and used rotisserie chicken). Oh yeah, I also cheated our local grocery store sells soup starters (diced onions, celery, and carrots. This recipe is definitely a KEEPER!

Great recipe! I do as others suggested...saute a couple minced cloves of garlic and add thyme with seasonings. I saute the Celery, onion and garlic. Add the stocks and already cooked chicken (sometimes I use a roaster chicken that's already cooked from the grocery store) add the carrots and seasonings and bring to a simmer until carrots are a little tender then add the uncooked noodles to finish it up. I feel the noodles soak up more flavor being cooked in the soup rather being cooked in a separate pot.

I used others' suggestions, and sautéed  onions, garlic, celery and carrots in butter. Used all chicken broth, because I didn't have vegetable broth on hand. Added a couple shakes if thyme as well. Diced frozen chicken breasts and boiled with everything else  to cook. Cooked noodles separately and added to the soup just before serving. So tasty! Too bad my sickies went to bed early and missed out. I enjoyed all four bowls I got! ;-)

I added 1Tbsp olive oil w/ butter.  And I bulked it up a little - used 1# chicken & about 2-3 cups noodles.  It was absolutely scrumptious, comforting, filling, easy, and I'll make it again!!  I slow-cook my chicken breasts in a crock-pot with a little stock & then divide it up for various quick winter soups.

This was fantastic! This is the first time I ever made chicken noodle soup and it was easy and yummmy. I didn't have veggie broth, so I made some of that as well. I did as other recommended and added garlic (2 cloves) and added the carrots with the celery, onion and garlic and sauteed them. I also used raw chicken instead of cooked. Fantastic! I will definitely make again and again!

Tried this recipe yesterday, my girlfriend says its the best chicken noodle soup shes ever had, and I loved it too. 
I used herbes de provence in place of the basil/oregano and sauteed a little garlic in the butter and it turned out great. I also added about 1 1/2 pounds chicken instead of the 1/2 pound called for and threw it all in a crockpot overnight on low. I will definitely be making this again!

Very simple to make! I had chicken in the crockpot, so just shredded/chopped that. I used two chicken breasts. I also used one carton of reduced sodium chicken stock and one veggie stock (I believe 32 oz each). I didn't have the right noodles, so I used Orzo pasta. It was good, but I'll definitely try it with egg noodles next time. I also had to add water the second day because the pasta soaked up most of the liquid. I used about 1 cup each of celery and carrot and 1/2 cup onion. It made a ton of soup - probably 10 servings. Very good, quick and perfect to put together for a weeknight dinner.

To save some money and space in my kitchen, I used some Knorr chicken bouillon cubes instead of canned broth, and it was still amazing! And I also made my own poultry seasoning from what I had on hand (marjoram, sage, thyme, rosemary, pepper). I'll try the creamy version suggested by another reviewer next.

My first time making chicken noodle soup was a big success!  This is a great basic recipe.  Like most, I adjusted the ingredients a bit. But rather than go through all that, my only suggestion would be that you cook the noodles in the broth like the recipe states.  Many reviewers suggest you cook them beforehand then add before serving. But I think cooking them in the broth added so much flavor to the noodles themselves--they could be a meal on their own!  UPDATE:  My family ate this in 3 days and asked for more.  So I am making another batch tonight with the rest of the roast chicken and will always double this recipe in the future!

Fantastic recipe!  Loved it!  I did read some of the reviews, as always, and did the saute of the veggies with two garlic cloves.  We prefer a chunky soup, so  I also doubled the veggies, (rotisserie) chicken and noodles.   I had homemade noodles I purchased at a craft fair and they were wonderful in this.   100x better than any canned variety.  I will make again for sure!!! Thank you!!

I followed the directions and added a flavor booster...I added some of the chicken skin while it simmers, and then strain it out before eating.  Adds a ton of flavor, especially if you got a pre-seasoned chicken!

Turned out great! Big hit with my husband .. First time making it and it was flavorful, I added an additional tsp of garlic powder and extra pepper to give it a good kick.

I made this soup to take to my mother-in-law in the hospital today and only made a few modifications.  I first substituted olive oil for the butter and sauted carrots and celery, then removed them from the pan and continued with the onions and garlic.  I also revoed these from the pan.  I brought the stock (swanson's no salt chicken broth) to a boil and added seasonings (no salt).  In the meanwhile, I chopped uncooked chicken tenderloins into small bites.  Once boiling, I dropped the chicken into the broth, then added the rice noodles and cooked until tender.  When the noodles were cooked through, I added the cooked vegetables back to the pan and added some chopped cilantro.  The soup was EXCELLENT!

This is a great recipe! I, too, added a few garlic cloves to the onions, and also added frozen peas at the end (because we really like peas in our soup). My family also likes the addition of dumplings, so it was easily converted to Chicken & Dumplings. Thanks for the base! Going in the recipe box.

Just what I needed to help got over my cold. I used maybe 1/4 cup minced garlic, because we love garlic & made my own broth using "better than boullion" concentrate. I think quality broth is key in this recipe, the concentrate I used provides a really rich flavor that my whole family enjoyed.

I used all chicken broth, instead of using some vegetable broth. It turned out great. Nice, quick, and easy. I definitely recommend this recipe to anybody that is in a hurry, or is a beginner at making soups.

Very tasty! For the broth I used a can of cream of chicken soup, 5 cans of water and 3 teaspoons of Knorr's chicken bouillon. I prefer thin spaghetti noodles over egg noodles so that went in instead. This will be my new favorite chicken noodle recipe. Thanks!

Really excellent.  Doubled all the ingredients and added one more can of  stock and then added a bit of garlic too.  I add another two cups of broth to the pot to make it soupier for dinner the second day, as the noodles do soak up a lot of broth over night in the refrigerator.

NOTE:I recommend keeping the noodles separate and add them to your portions as you eat it, this will prevent the leftovers from getting starchy and the noodles soaking up all the broth and going to mush.  
My tweaks: added a little more carrots and celery, fresh thyme and rosemary sprigs and I used a combination of bouillon and stock from a carton (not a can.)

This was pretty good, but still needed....something. I put the carrots, celery, onions and garlic in the food processor then sauteed the lot in some butter. Threw the cubed chicken (raw) into the pot to cook in the stock and added a little garlic powder, sage and thyme to the spice list. We used alphabet pasta to make it more fun. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe! Left out the mushrooms and used garlic paste instead of powder. Don't worry if it looks a bit thin--the sauce will eventually thicken. Turned out perfectly all three times I've made it so far. Delicious!

Delicious! I sauteed the onions, celery, garlic, and carrots then added Costco rotisserie chicken with Better than Bullion. I added fresh basil and oregano with dried thyme and bay leaf. Last I put in egg noodles. I was awesome, and will be better tomorrow

I whipped this together because I had a cold and chicken noodle soup sounded good.  I pretty much doubled the vegetables and the chicken as well, but kept the liquid the same.  I think the consistency was perfect this way.  I simmered longer than stated and used raw chicken, which I added maybe the last 40 minutes.  I also used whole wheat noodles.

I love the chicken noodle soup that's on the soup bar at my grocery store. Unfortunately, it's a bit pricey, and I knew I could make it myself! I followed the suggestions from the first reviewer who described this recipe as "WONDERLICIOUS!" She was right!! My son was sick, so I really was hoping it would hit the right note with him, and he loved it! Delicious, quick, healthy, dinner!! This will be a staple in my house!

Was bland, so I added more broth,  2 boullion cubes, more basil, oregano, some tyme, salt, pepper and poultry seasoning. Next time I wouldn't add noodles until I taste it first. The noodles break down if heating too long.

Fantastic! You can't go wrong with this one. I had some chicken tenderloins that I had cooked, sprinkling them with oregano while they were cooking. I keep them in the fridge to toss into salads. Since it's a very cold day, I wanted soup and this recipe fit the bill. I used the tenderloins, didn't add the oregano since the tenderloins included it. I added several sliced mushrooms, and some leftover canned Italian green beens? I also used some chopped fresh basil. Honestly, this tasted like it cooked all day to perfection! I think you can add whatever veggies you like and it will turn out just fine. Thanks for sharing, MARYVM! I will be making this one often!

Excellent recipe! Can definitely add variety to it. I also added garlic to the onions & celery as well as the seasoning. Used beef broth instead of veg., it's what I had on hand. I made this before but used way too many noodles. This time I stuck to what the recipe called for. Much more flavor!

I love this chicken noodle soup! I have been making it for over 3 years. I have tried it just as written, and it's good. But I have had to substitute chicken for home made chicken broth using water and knorr chicken bouillon and it's fine. Season to taste and you'll have some awesome soup. No need to settle for store bought cans of soup.

This is just so good. Seems like it would just be plain and maybe bland, but there is just something about the flavor that is so delicious. And you can tweak it to suit your own personal taste. Personally, I used less broth, more veggies and noodles (which I had leftover from another meal, so they were precooked), and added some garlic and parsley. I'm going to try it with chicken stock next time, I think. But it was still excellent with the broth.

Great and quick recipe, I cooked the chicken in chicken broth then used the broth for the soup, and j used more vegetables and broth than recommended.

So easy to make. It was nice as per recipe but lacks something so i added garlic powder to the soup and it was even better i feel. And note to all other reviewers, it's really unfair to change the recipe and rate it as per your changes. Give the recipe a chance. Thank you for sharing MARYVM : D

I gave this 4 stars because I feel like its a great base recipe to add to as you like.  I didn't have celery on hand, so I added a diced green and yellow squash at the broth stage.  I added in garlic and thyme, too.  We all loved this.

Very simple and easy to make! Just have to ensure I have all the necessary ingredients.(I cook and shred the chicken ahead of time so it's ready to go when I make this). My family loves it and rave about it every time I make it!

Made this tonight, exactly as recipe directs.  It was not bad, but not 4 or more stars either.  My son loves chicken noodle soup so I will probably make it again; however,  I will use dark chicken next time as some reviewers suggested, because white meat tends to get very dry.

Great recipe and so easy!  I used frozen egg noodles (Reames, but I'm sure any will do).  It's easy enough that I think if/when I get sick, I can just throw it together (or direct my dear fiance to do so).  I'll make this again, for sure, especially when it's chilly outside.

would have rated 5 stars but had to tweak, dont want the noodles to get all the way done while on the heat because if you do they will get soggy doubled everything and added garlic and it was great.

Great tasting soup! I didn't have the time or patience to put together my own broth,which I always regret nothing beats homemade broth.  so as get recipe suggested I used canned', had left over chicken', also had a packet of knorr chicken noodle soup mix I used that for some added flavour and it was by far my best idea yet .

Changed according to reviews already given be others.  I sauteed 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1 cup carrots, 1 cup celery, and 1 cup of chopped onions in 2 T of margarine.  For the broth, I used a 32 oz container of chicken broth, one 14.5 oz can of chicken broth and two 14.5 oz cans of vegetable broth.  I cut 1 lb of chicken into bite sized pieces and put them in the pot raw when I added the broth (so they chicken is boiled and cooked in the 20 minutes of simmering.)  I added a dash of poultry seasoning.  While the chicken and broth boiled for 20 minutes, in a separte pot I cooked 3 cup of dry egg noodles.  Drained the noodles.  After the 20 minutes, I added the noodles to the broth/chicken pot and continued to simmer for 10 minutes.  Everyone loved it.

Excellent!!  Just what I needed for my daughter's cold.  I used an all natural rotisserie chicken to make the broth - getting all the minerals from the bones.  I added spinach because I always add spinach whenever I can sneak it in on my kids. :)  Also added garlic for its antibiotic properties.  A perfect immune boosting soup!  Flavor is wonderful, my children loved it!!!  THANKS for sharing!

Was better than how I used to cook it but on the other hand I would not say this is the best but does satisfy the need for chicken noodle soup in a quick amount of time. I recommend it if you want something quick.

I made this with grocery store chicken broth and bow tie pasta (whole wheat). I had to add quite a bit of vinegar and wine to make the broth taste good. The pasta was fine cooked in the soup. It turned out to be very good. I am sure it would be much better with homemade broth.

This turned out wonderful. I did add about 2 cloves of minced garlic which I admit, I had reservations about, but that amount was perfect. I only had fresh oregano and also added some thyme. Husband kept going back for more. Now, if only my daughter who has a nasty cold would wake up from her nap ...

This is a great base to chicken noodle soup! I like a nice kick to my soup so I added a dash of Cumin powder and red pepper flakes. I added a bay leaf as well and some poultry seasoning.  Also, a rotisserie chicken is key as it is less dry then cutlets. I can't wait to make this again!

Fantastic! I doubled-- almost tripled the broth (half chicken broth & half vegetable broth), because I added a little more veggies than called for (carrots as well). I also added cayenne pepper to it for a little kick. It's a keeper.

My familt absolutely love when I cook this.  i have cooked this twice already.  My twist that I added was using chicken stock.  This adds a lot more flavor.

I just made this soup.  The vegies, broth and seasoning were spot on.  I did, however use my own chicken broth made from a rotisserie chicken carcass - made a big difference I think.  The single thing that was bad, was the chicken.  Maybe I poached it too long, but, I just think that simmering cooked chicken for another 20 minutes is overkill.  I should have known better.  The noodles were also slightly overcooked.  i don't think they need to simmer for the whole 20 minutes.  Fixing those two things will make this soup really really good.  Next time, it will be perfect!

I've never made Chicken Noodle Soup before.. I've never even made soup and now i can't wait to do it again. So much better than from a can!.. But that doesn't really set the bar very high. Taking from some other reviewers I added a minced clove of garlic, the chopped carrots, and a CUP of chopped onions in the initial sauté. I cut up a raw chicken breast and cooked it separately with salt and pepper and then added in the last 10 minutes of simmering. I also put 2 cups of raw egg noodles and 2 fresh thyme sprigs in the mix. I wanted to make this for my boyfriend who has a cold but i can't help but want to eat all of it myself. Excellent recipe!

Very good!! My husband loved it. Read the other reviews and decided to cook the chicken in a crock pot earlier in the day. And the only thing different I chose was to use dark meat instead of breast. That is probably why my husband loved it! I used boneless thigh meat in the crock, with broth instead of water. We have eaten almost all of the leftovers! Very good and easy. Will keep this as my go to chicken soup recipe.

I made this yesterday for my sick daughter and it turned out wonderfully delicious! I used the breast meat from a rotisserie chicken and also added some fresh ginger slices. Do make sure you use all low sodium broth or else it will be a very sodium-filled soup! I'm going to make more soup using the rest of the rotisserie chicken and maybe freeze that batch for a quick last-minute dinner.

Great basic recipe. I cooked the chicken in the broth while the veggies were cooking, then combined everything and continued with the directions. It was a good soup but there is something missing from the flavor to make it taste like a traditional chicken noodle soup. I'll make it again.

This recipe rocks!  I like the texture of chicken that is boiled and then cut up.  So I did boil a whole chicken and then used part of this broth for the remainder of the total needed.  I used 1- 32oz. package Swanson chicken plus 1-14.5 oz vegetable broth. I liked the suggestion to add two cloves of garlic and a pinch of thyme and pinch of poultry seasoning. I am making for the second time today.  This is the perfect recipe to warm you on a cold day - delicious!

Wow!   Super easy and super good.  I picked up the ingredients on the way home from work.  For the chicken, I got a pre-cooked chicken from the deli.  The prep couldn't be easier.  I added a little more carrots, chicken and noodles than the recipe called for, but I like soup with more substance and less broth.  I was shocked at how good it tasted for such a quick and simple recipe.  And, you know what...the leftovers were even better the next day!!

Great recipe, it's a keeper!

the only change I made to this recipe was to cook carrots with celery and onion and added some garlic.  It was so good, quick and easy! I had it for breakfast the next day LOL (I roasted  chicken breast in the oven then shredded it into to the soup)  I do like the idea of cooking (poaching)the breast in the broth, I think I will try that next time.

Absolutely delicious!!  It managed to pass with flying colors in our house, which is not always an easy thing to do. The only change I made was to chop the onion and celery extremely fine in the food chopper so it went undetected by one of my critics.

I've made this twice now...once when my husband had dental surgery and again after my daughter and her friend had a car wreck. The only changes were to make it with equal parts vegetable and chicken stock (I buy unsalted stock in a box) and to add about 1/4 cup cream at the end. Simple, delicious and even better the next day.

This is a comforting yummy soup. I would prepare as-is to comfort a sick friend, but in my case I used cayenne pepper, garlic, and an additional sprinkle of Italian seasoning to make it more flavorful.  Sometimes I add a handful of fresh spinach at the very end to maximize the nutritional value without significantly changing the flavor. I also cook the noodles separately in broth and add them to the individual bowls to prevent them from becoming soggy.  Yum!

Great recipe for quick chicken noodle soup!  I added fresh chopped garlic and sautéed that and the carrots with the onions & celery. Oh I also added red pepper flakes because I like heat in my food. Used wheat egg noodles.  Other than that followed exactly!  I will make again!  Use this recipe as a base and then make it your own.

This was my first time making chicken noodle soup from scratch...and it was awesome!  I used a roasted chicken from the dinner the night before, and added garlic to the onions as they cooked.  I also threw in a can of cream of chicken soup for a little thicker broth.  My husband loved it, he even ate the leftovers for breakfast.

This was excellent.  I cooked the chicken raw along with the veggies.
You can also add more veggies, any ones you like. 
This makes alot - way more than 6 servings.  Cant wait to make it again.

I made a few changed based on other reviews (canned chicken, sauted veggies before adding broth, extra noodles and veggies, etc). Great starter recipe!

I use this recipe all the time, and now my boyfriend requests it.  "home made chicken noodle soup" is just great!  I do add a bit more seasoning to it, but this is an amazing recipe.

I made this a few weeks ago and it was delicious! I used Turkey Breast instead. I like to use Carrots, Celery, Onions and Kale in my noodle soups. I really liked this recipe and will use it again.

Really easy & really good.  I had some real chicken broth so used it & added water & chicken soup base for the broth.  Did not have egg noddles so used whole wheat Penne noodles & whole wheat spaghetti noodles which I had on hand.  Turned out really good.

This was very good, though, I think the servings are a little off.  I doubled the recipe to 12 servings hoping to have tons of leftovers, but 5 of us ate most of it.  Good thing I did double it, otherwise I wouldn't have had enough.

EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!! My dad makes the best soup around but this beat him i do believe. I did change some things up though. I did not add vegetable broth i added 1 can of cream of chicken soup and i added 2 cans of chicken,1 entire package of egg noodles and 2- 32oz containers of swansons chicken broth. Either way though still delicious!!!!!

We loved it. Even my 4 year old who refuses to eat soup asked for seconds. I added garlic, an extra half a cup of noodles, and sautéed the carrots with the other veggies like others suggested. I'm so glad I tried it.

We really enjoyed this soup.  Because of leftover turkey from Thanksgiving, we used that instead of chicken, and also used my own broth.  Very quick and easy to make.

Thank you Maryvm

Absolutely delicious! A few things I did from reading previous comments:

1. Cooked the onion, celery, and carrots with a tablespoon of minced garlic and butter in the pan. Helped to make the carrots more tender by the end. 
2. Used a small rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and kind of shredded the chicken. 
3. Cooked the egg noodles separately at first - to al dente - so the broth wouldn't get starchy -then added them to the entire pot of soup before boiling. 
4. Once everything was in the pot - boiled and simmered as directed. 
5. Served with shredded PARMESAN CHEESE! This is the last part that really makes the flavor pop! A heavy sprinkle on top of your personal serving --- Mmmmm!

This was my first attempt at making homemade soup and WOW!!  It blew my socks off; even my dad was surprised at how good it was.  Ive always been a working mom until recently, so cooking with meaning was always an after thought.  The only modification I made was adding celery seed because I didn't have fresh celery on hand but it was still out of this world.

So easy & yummy. I cook the noodles separately, then add them at the end. I like my broth w/o all of the starch that the noodles add when cooked with the other ingredients.

I've made variations of this a few hundred times. I would add a touch of garlic to the flavorings. Variations might include a pasta like tortellini, broccoli florets, fresh green and yellow beans cut to about 3/4 inch and some torn up chard or baby spinach tossed in at the end of cooking. I usually add regular olive oil to the butter for the saute.

This is a good basic recipe. Nothing special. I upped all the seasonings and veggies on the advice of some of the other reviewers and also added extra noodles. If I hadn't I think it would have been mostly broth.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this easy recipe!!  My 3 kids are picky eaters & always ask for 2nd's! As I type this Im making it - my daughter who is sick just came downstairs & said "mom, it smells SO could, I cant wait to have some".   
I double the recipe so I can freeze 1/2 for later.  I use roastier (sp?) chicken frm Costco.  Also frozen "Homestyle" Egg Noodles (by the frozen ravioli etc) - they make the soup extra delish!! I put them in frozen as I cook the soup. It is much better the next day - after the spices,etc.. marinate!

I made this last night and it was delicious, though I changed up a few things. I added minced garlic and a bit of garlic powder, added thyme and doubled the veggies and meat, and cooked it twice as long. Very tasty, will definitely be making it again!

Tried this for a household full of sick people. It was actually delicious. Made changes after reading some reviews. I added 4 cloves of minced garlic and omitted the vegetable broth. I also used homemade broth which made ALL the difference. Thanks! This one is a keeper.

Pretty good, not Panera chicken noodle soup soup but a close second.  I used 3 cans chicken broth, 2 veg broth.  Added twice as much celery and carrots and even extra chicken.  Cooked the noodles separate and kept them that way- just added them to each serving as we ate this soup over a few days.  Will make again!  Used a rot chicken for ease of prep.  Lots of veggies so healthy but will likely use lower sodium broth next time- not b/c it was too salty but just to try to make it healthier.

This is now our favorite chicken soup. Not sure if it is the vegetable broth or the spices that really do it but it is excellent.

First time making Chicken Noodle soup and it was a big hit! the only thing I did differently was using chicken thights instead of chicken breast. Chicken thights are way more flavorful...thanks for a great recipe!

An awesome base recipe. I've never made chicken noodle soup before (and I'm not exactly Martha Stewart in the kitchen) but I used this for reference, and added/subtracted/substituted as I went along, and the end result was delicious. Who knew canned chicken was so useful?

Using a whole store-cooked rotisserie chicken, this recipe was easy and quick.  Not being too particular with dicing size, this is recipe comes off as a good rustic dish.  I used about 20% less chicken stock then called for.

Very good. I used chicken tenders cause that's what I had. I might cut down the basil just a pinch cause it's a little too much for my liking but other then that very good.

Souper Yummy and Souper Easy.  Here's what I changed... I added 3 cloves of fresh sliced garlic, extra broth and extra egg noodles.  I also added a little Orrington Farms chicken Soup base.  My family, ages 6 to 45 are excited to have left overs.

This review is slightly off since I used bouillon powder instead of the broths and I added garlic and poultry seasoning as per other's suggestions. With that said, my family loved it! I'm sure it would be even better with the chicken and vegetable broths as the recipe calls. Yum.

This is a great soup!  Super easy and honestly tastes homemade.  I wouldn't tell anyone it isnt.

I use all the ingredients this soup calls for and then add dried Tarragon.  My mom has always added this to her chicken noodle soup and it adds another dimension to the soup.  Try it and let me know what you think by adding in 3/4 to 1 Tablespoon of dried Tarragon.  I know it defeats the purpose of this recipe BUT if time allows, I also let this soup simmer for 2-3 hours.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I added garlic to the vegetables I sauteed, only used chicken broth, and cooked the chicken in the broth. It was AMAZING!!!! Thank you so much for posting, it is a recipe I will always use!

Good recipe with a few tweaks. Instead of adding the veggies to the broths, spices, and chicken pot right away, I set them aside and instead added 2 carrots, 2 celery stalks, and ½ lg onion cut into large chunks.  After about 20 minutes, I took out the veggies and added new onion, celery, and carrots as the recipe called for – then simmered for 20 minutes.  I omitted the noodles.  Be careful with adding salt – broth can be very salty already.

Wow, this recipes is SO SO yummy. My guy and I totally loved it. I will definitely make it again. 

I marinated the chicken breast with salt, pepper, a pinch of garlic powder, and a 1/8 tsp of chicken bouillon to make the chicken more tasteful and flavorful, then put the cooked chicken into the soup with other veggies. It turned out great!!!! Leftovers can be refrigerated and are still good even after a few days.

This was a very good & quick soup! I took Brown Sugar Girl's advice & sauteed garlic, onions & carrots before adding the rest of the soup to it. I left out the celery cause my husband is not a fan. 
I cooked 2 chicken breasts in oil & put some pepper, garlic powder, old bay seasoning & cayenne on them as well.  I also used two 32oz chicken broth & the 1 veggie broth. My only complaint was the noodles were too soggy for my liking but the soup itself was great! Next time I will simmer the soup for 20 mins as directed but not add the noodles until the last 7 mins so they cook as directed on the package!

Great recipe! I added some potatoes cut into small cubes and it was delicious. I also used only 1 can of broth, and the rest just water. Yummy.

This is delicious! Easy and good for my tummy. This is my first trying a recipe and I will definitely try more. Thank you for sharing. Also,  I put a slight twist on the recipe after reading a few comments. I only used chicken broth, I used Italian seasoning because it had the basil, oregano and thyme in it  (thanks Paula Deene), and I cooked all my veggies in the butter first. I spent about $15. Wonderfully tasty and cheap!!!!

I made Sarah’s Dry Rubbed Chicken and had leftovers, so I used them to make this soup.  I doubled the noodles and added a few green peas that needed to be used.  And instead of using the seasonings called for, I added about 1 t. of the dry rub in Sarah’s recipe. It was excellent chicken noodle soup!  Hubs had been asking for chicken noodle soup, and he was very pleased with this, as I was.  I did cook my noodles separately, so I could freeze the extra soup and noodles (separately) for another couple of meals.

Just what I needed on this cold and rainy Black Friday.  I used leftover cornish hen from Thanksgiving and it's a very comforting soup, hearty but much lighter than all the food we ate yesterday! I didn't have vegetable broth or carrots, but I will definitely try it again when I have those two ingredients.  It's good even without them.  We ate our soup with crescent rolls-- very quick and easy. Thanks for the recipe!

I can't bring myself to give five stars to a recipe that involves canned soup, but really, this is exactly what it promises to be. I made it for the family with what I thought was enough for leftovers, but they ate it all up!

This was quick and easy!  I used the Homemade Chicken Broth recipes from this site for the broth and cooked the noodles separate, a trick I learned from my mother.   I added a couple of pinches of salt to top it off.  Delicious!

My boyfriend's been sick all day and I wanted to make him some soup, but didn't want to spend all day either.  Found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try.  Some additions I made: Added an ear of white corn to the soup, 1/2 cup milk, and some Tabasco.  Going back I think I might try getting the noodles done separately, mostly because I'm not a huge fan of soggy noodles.  But all in all, this was fantastic. Definitely going into the recipe book.

Never made chicken noodle soup before (besides right out of the can). Everyone loved it. Made me feel accomplished. A good home cooked meal without too much fuss. Now to look for a good noodle recipe.

Delicious!  Easiest chicken soup I've ever made and it tasted great.  Made a double batch.  I used vegetable stock and chicken bouillon cubes dissolved in water instead of canned broth, will try the canned next time for comparison.   I cooked my chicken breasts separately for exactly the purpose of avoiding the problem the poster below me had.  Cut and added to the soup when they were done.  Also, cooked my noodles separate, divided the soup in half and added noodles to that nights portion - froze the rest in single size servings (w/o noodles).  Great recipe, thanks for sharing it.

This was great. I usually prefer stews but this was very good. I followed one reviewer's recommendation and cooked the chicken in the soup. I would NOT do that again. The white "scum" from cooking the chicken had to stay in the soup. It couldn't be strained out. I would add cooked chicken next time to make a clearer, prettier broth/soup.

Great, easy recipe. Really tasty too. The only thing I'd  do differently next time is boil the noodles separately and add them to the simmer at the last 5 minutes or so.

Wonderful tasting, easy to cook soup. Made this last night with just minor changes. I sauteed all veggies together  (wanted a more tender carrot) in the butter along with some minced garlic, salt and pepper. Family ate it all up. Goes great with freshly baked bread.

This was Excellent and super easy. It saves time if you have all your veggies and chicken chopped up before hand. It was way better than a canned soup and much healthier. Thanks!

The only thing i changed was the noodles, I did not use noodles I used rice, which I cooked separate and kept separate. I would heat up the rice and pour the chicken soup over it and heat again if necessary. Also I used whole wheat rice which tasts better then white, to me it is more hearty. I also used allot more dried herbs.

Very good. Instead of basil I used some sprigs of thyme from my garden & added garlic. Froze well without the addition of noodles & reheated well too.

This is a great basic recipe!  As suggested by some reviewers, I added all vegetables (plus one minced clove of garlic) to the butter.  Instead of the vegetable broth, I added water.  Used left overs from a rotisserie chicken for meat and added a bit more than the suggested amount of noodles.  Also added one basil leaf.  The result was REALLY great, my 18 month old loved it and it was very easy to make.

I have made a lot of soup and I have to say this one is so easy and so delicious!  The only change is I added 3 tablespoons of lemon juice and cut back just a bit on the amount of oregano and basil for my taste.  Since I had fresh parsley, I added 3 tablespoons of that as well.  It is now a family favorite!

I asked my wife if she would like Chicken Noodle Soup for dinner and that I would make it. She answered yes with doubt. I got online and came across this website and recipe. whipped it together when I got home and had it ready when she got home. She loved it. Took a picture of it and later asked if I had bought it. HA!

I make this ALL the time!  I double it and it freezes great.  When we've got runny noses I get a serrano pepper and add a few slices of it (seeds in).  The extra spice isn't overwhelming, but it definitely helps to open up the sinuses.  I LOVE this recipe!

This recipe is extremly easy to follow and not to mention I got a hug from my girlfriend for making this. I made some slight changes though. I used roasted chicken, one jalapeno, red pepper (dash) rosemary (sprig), dill (teaspoon) and a one can of cream of chicken. (I trippled the recipe, b/c I'll be eating this for the next few weeks!) I cooked the egg noodles (aldente) first and added right at the end of the process with the chicken and cream of chicken soup.  Oh, I added the rosemary and dill while the broths were warming.

I love this and so does my family, I put a bunch of mushrooms in and used more onion and carrots than required and we used the spiral tri color noodles and they didn't fall apart at all with the extra cooking (the 1st time I did it because it's what I had but every other time on purpose)....I also added a spash of thyme

This was so good... I added the cream of celery soup as someone else suggested and I added more veggies than the recipe called for. I will definitely make this again. You can do so many things to this recipe to fit your personal taste and it will still come out great. I might add 2 cans of cream of celery next time. Delicious! Thanks for sharing!

This is a fabulous way to use leftover chicken! And it's really good! I've always been a from scratch chicken soup only gal but decided to try this since I had some chicken on hand already. I was totally impressed. I followed directions and ingredients exactly, only 1/2 tsp adding herbs de provence (just b/c I look for any opportunity to use that). Definitely a repeat.

Completely heavenly. I used a small onion, about 3 stalks of celery and 3 carrots. Substituted the meat from an entire rotisserie chicken. Used 2 small packages of frozen yolk-free egg noodles and added right to the boiling broth; brought it back to a boil then simmered for an hour. Great flavor, easy prep. This is the first and last homemade chicken noodle soup recipe I'll ever go in search of.

I cooked this recipes as is and really enjoyed it. Its quite good. However, when I cooked it the second time I changed the recipe to accommodate my family's taste.  I used less chicken broth, added cream of chicken and more veggies for a heartier soup.  All in all this is an excellent recipe base to add whatever you and your family like. Thank you for the recipe.

Everyone loved this soup - my pickiest eater ate 3 bowls and was just raving about it!    I added garlic in and sauteed the carrots.   I also used raw chicken to save time.   Wonderful!

This is a fabulously fail-safe recipe!  I've made it on numerous occassions, and it's perfect every time.  If you want to amp up the flavor even more, try grilling your chicken breasts on a charcoal grill, and using this meat as a substitute. The resulting flavor is divine!

I have to agree with a previous review that said to wait till last min to add noodles my noodles came out ready to just fall apart and very starchy. Broth and everything else though was incredible. Will def make again, just gonna hold off on the noodles till dinner time!

It was pretty simple. Nothing outstanding, but then again how great can chicken noodle soup be? I made a regular version and a vegetarian version (with cut up veggie chicken). I took the suggestion of another reader and cooked the chicken in the soup- it was a lot easier. Will probably make again one day but definitely use thin egg noodles; the wide ones were too big on your spoon.

Loved this recipe. I made a few changes simply because I love lots of carrots and celery. It has to be hearty and full of flavor or I just won't eat it. Next time I'm going to add more stock because I used thick frozen noodles and they soaked it all up. That was my fault not the recipes. Thanks for a winner!

I really liked this, easy and made with ingredients I usually have on hand. The vegetable broth adds a nice touch.

This was really good and really easy. I did double this recipe. I doubled all ingredients except the carrot. I had leftover, cooked frozen chicken breast that I used in this recipe. I used only 1 tbsp of olive oil to saute the onions, celery and carrots before adding the remaining ingredients. I used broken up spaghetti noodles because I didn't have anything else in the house. The spaghetti noodles measured out to be 1 1/2 cups total dry, not cooked before I added them to the soup. I used 2, 32oz boxes of Swanson chicken broth. I added 1/4 tsp of pepper and no extra salt. It was so good for lunch with a homemade loaf of bread. I will be making this again! Thanks!

Nice basic and easy recipe that I will definitely use again.  As other reviewers have done, I used 1 cup of onion and 1 cup of celery instead.  I also sauteed the carrots with the celery and onion at the beginning and then just added the raw chicken and cooked until no longer pink.  The only other things I did differently is used probably closer to 2 1/2 to 3 cups of egg noodles and about 1/4 tsp. of thyme.  I may try adding some condensed soup next time for a more creamy broth.  Not sure what I would do to make it a 5-star recipe, but overall good.

I changed it a bit by adding some garlic to it, only using chicken stock(no vegetable broth), and I added extra carrots and chicken.  This was super easy, and really yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used to think the only way to make great-tasting chicken soup was to start with a whole chicken and homemade stock, and proceed from there. Wrong!! This soup tastes almost as good as the "totally from scratch" method, but takes about 1/3 of the time to make. And it absolutely blows away any canned soup you'll find on the shelf. Give this one a try. The taste you get for the time you put in can't be beat!

This was truly a quick and easy Chicken Noodle Soup.  I am not a great cook, but this turned out great!  I don't usually like Chicken Noodle Soup, but this one was delicious.  I took one of the recommendations and cooked all the vegetables in butter for a few minutes before adding them to  the broth.  Also added 2 cloves of garlic to the veggie mix and used frozen chicken breasts.  Just boiled them in the broth for about 8 minutes, then shredded and added them back in with all the other ingredients.  This is definitely a new regular on our family menu. Thanks!!

I followed the advice from the first 3 reviews. I make this with homemade egg noodles and just toss them in at the end to cook for a few minutes.  My family eats this right up.

I made this for my daughter when she had the flu, and she's requested it three times since then!  Always always add the vegetable broth, it adds such flavor! After reading the reviews, I also added two cloves of garlic, chopped to the veggies.  I keep the noodles separate from the soup, chilled in the fridge.  Great soup, thank you!

This is a great soup. It is easy to make, and ready in a short amount of time. If you do not have the time to make your own stock (which can take hours) this is definately the soup for you!

Classic chicken noodle soup! I skipped the vegetable broth and used 2 cans of chicken broth (that was all I had on hand) then added 4 cups of water and 2 teaspoons of chicken bullion granules.   I also sauteed the carrots with the onion and celery.   Very good.  Will definately make this again.

My boyfriend was sick and I didn't want to run out and buy canned soup. Too much sodium. I found this recipe and it turned out great! I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand ( onions, celery, veggie broth) but I improvised with some garlic powder and a bit more chicken broth and it worked. I liked how it was easy to make and was ready in 30 min. Next time I will make sure I have all of the ingredients. Then I am sure it will be a 5 star review. Bon appetit!

Kind of  Bland, but John loved it when he was sick with cold. I did not have veg. broth, so the next time I will make sure to get some. That might might help make it better. update, 2nd time around, I sauted onion, garlic, celery, chicken breast ect. Put all in pot with the broth and noodles,(dried noodles in plastic bag) only used 3 cans of chicken broth, simmered until noodles were tender. wonderful! Guess you can change this around depending on what you have on hand, But I do like cooking noodles with chicken, ( I think it helps thicken broth) But if you are going to freeze this better cook noodles separately. Bet I fix this diff. everytime , great recipe, Thanks!

This was a good start, but needs more flavor.  I added additional carrots & celery, and used all chicken broth.  My dad makes a homemade chicken noodle soup which I prefer to this one, but this is a good base to start with and play around with.  I made with kluski noodles which are my favorite in soup!

I really enjoyed this soup. It really is quick and easy but that does not mean it lacks flavor or quality. I don't use celery and only use carrots for flavor and then remove them just because our house is picky but still, this soup is fantastic!

I had to give this soup 5 stars, it didn't start that way, but completely my fault.  I need to learn to make better chicken stock!  Once the stock started tasting better this soup was great.  So easy.  I did take direction from others when they said to make the noodles seperate.  I did add corn starch in the end to make it a little thicker.  Everyone went for seconds.  Thanks for such an easy & great recipe.

Great recipe. I made this the other week and it was gone in one meal. My sister said it was better than progresso (which up until now was her fav). I did add more chicken and egg noodles.

I cooked the noodles separately as others suggested, and added four cloves of fresh garlic. Love garlic! I made "A Good Easy Garlic Chicken" from this site, shredded the chicken and added it to the soup. So simple, yet very flavorful! Thanks for sharing!!

Very good soup, which will probably be even better tomorrow.  As suggested, I cooked the noodles separately and added them at the end. Also as suggested, I added 2 cloves minced garlic which I sauteed with the onion, carrots and celery in butter and olive oil.  After about 4 minutes, I threw the spices into the veggies and sauteed them all together.  I didn't have vegetable broth, so I used only organic chicken broth, and added  almost a tablesoon of Better Than Bouillon. I used leftover chicken that I had roasted last night, using both dark and white meat. My picky little 2-year-old grandson was running a fever last night, so I made this for his "medicine" tonight, and he lapped it right up.  Yea!  I'm giving this 5 stars for the ease of it along with the very satisfying taste of comfort food.

This recipe IS DELICIOUS!  Like others, I made a few changes.  I added garlic and sauteed the garlic -onion-celery-and carrots all together for a few minutes.  I used a rotisserie Chicken which made it soooo flavorfull!  I also used whole weat egg noodles.  I created an account just so that I could rate this recipe...I will definately be making this soup often! Thanks so much Mary!

I have made numerous recipes from this site, and this is the first one that I have been compelled to rate.  I boiled 2 chicken breasts and added sage, garlic powder, chicken buillion & poultry seasoning to the water, and used that as the broth.  I sauteed my veggies and added them to the pot, then shredded the chicken, put it back in, added celery seed and brought to a boil.  I let that simmer for about 30 minutes, then added a cup of water when I put the noodles in.  It was EXACTLY what I wanted.  Thank you for sharing this recipe--this is how chicken soup should always be!!!

Delicious and so easy. I used chopped up raw chicken and just threw it in the soup and let it all cook together. I halved the recipe, but I only had one can of chicken broth so I used that along with water and a half a package of onion soup mix for extra flavor. Really, really good. Ultra comfort food. Thank you! :)

I always try to stay true to the recipes at least the first time, but... didnt have vegetable stock.  I sauteed  my onion, carrots, celery, & added minced garlic for 5-7 mins.  Then I added my chicken stock and chicken.  After cooking the chicken until almost done, I removed it from the pot and cut into chunks.  I threw in a few extra chicken boullion.  This was great!!

This recipe was REALLY easy.  I took the suggestions of previous reviewers and used a deli section rotisserie chicken.  I don't love it more than Panera's version, but this is a more cost effective yet delicious alternative.

Just like it says, QUICK and EASY.  This recipe is a keeper because of the ease of cooking and that it's tasty.  It's easy enough to modify ingredients (adding more veggies) or substituting rice for pasta.  I made this for my sick hubby and he really enjoyed homemade chicken noodle soup!

As written, I give this soup 4 stars. Sure, it would be wayyy better with homemade chicken broth and veggie broth, and I would probably replace the dried oregano with fresh, but as a quick and easy soup that calls for ingredients that are always in my cupboard, this is good. Like others, I made this with the shredded meat from a rotisserie chicken (I also threw in the skin for a little extra flavor, but removed it prior to serving). All in all, not bad. Thanks!

Just like the name said, quick and easy!  My kids loved it!  We give it 5 stars even without the veg. broth that I was missing (just did 4 cans broth).  Delicious!

This was so good!  I used a more onion, carrots, and celery and sauteed them all together.  I used a cooked rotissere chicken (pulled the white meat off) - this added more than what was called for but it filled in nicely.   I also added 2 1/2 cups of egg pasta.  It tastes like homemade!

This was good. I used bouillon, both vegetable and chicken. I also used whole wheat pasta. I sauteed all the veggies for a few minutes then popped everything into the slow cooker for awhile. Added pasta in the last half hour, whole wheat bow ties. My boyfriend said he liked it more then our favorite take out chicken soup.

This is a souper simple, quick and delicious recipe.  I made some changes to suit my family's tastes*, but nothing substantial.  This recipe deserves 5 stars as written!  *no celery, extra chicken, added a handful of cut green beans that I had to use soon

Tastes just like made from scratch, without the chicken fat that floats on top when you boil the actual chicken - so you get the best of both worlds. I used store-bought roasted chicken which was already seasoned to perfection (I know cuz I ate half the bag before using it lol), which I think made it extra yummy (but more expensive). I also used cubes instead of the canned broth, but I doubt it could have turned out any better.

I made this for my sick boyfriend several weeks ago and I had him rate this one although being really sick at the time probably affects the score. Personally I would give it a 4 1/2 but we can both agree that we have had some pretty good homemade chicken noodle soup before. As other users have suggested I used 2 cloves of garlic minced, 1 cup chopped onions, and 1 cup chopped celery. I cooked the chicken in a skillet first in small squares, this made them slightly move vulnerable to moisture and so they absorbed a lot of flavor. However, boiling the chicken and creating a natural broth would most likely been better, if nothing more than to reduce the sodium content found in store bought broths. It was really well seasoned, but my boyfriend had trouble eating it for that reason, and so this isn't recommended for stomach ailments. I definitely enjoyed this with bread, and it was nice being able to make a homemade sick healing food that I will keep around for those pesky colds as well as cold winter days.

Like mentioned in earlier reviews, I add 1 can of cream of chicken soup as well as 1 clove crushed garlic to the soup. The 2 times I have made this, I used the meat from a rotisserie chicken and frozen noodles from the freezer section of the grocery store. It makes the whole house smell cozy when this is cooking.  This will be a regular dinner at our house in the winter months.

This recipe was so easy for my first time making chicken noodle soup. I added fresh minced garlic, thyme and a pinch of poultry seasoning and sauteed all the veggies together.  It puts store bought soup to shame. Thanks for sharing.

This is a wonderfully delicious, easy homemade soup! I only made a few simple changes to suit my family's tastes: I added garlic to the onion and carrot to saute, and I also substituted thyme for oregano, but did not use as much because I find thyme stronger. I used regular rotini pasta (not egg noodles) because that is what I had in the cupboard, and that worked just as well. I just used leftover chicken in the fridge from fajitas the night before, and that worked perfectly. The only thing I would do differently next time is to use low-sodium chicken broth and taste it before adding any extra salt, as we found the soup to be slightly salty - but this may have just been the brand of stock I used. Overall, a great recipe that I am sure I will go back to many times!

usually really good chicken soup takes a long time to make, but this one didn't. I skipped the butter, used all chicken stock, added parsley and crushed red pepper, and let people add noodles as they wanted. If I put them all in at once they would soak up all the liquid and get mushy. I just threw all the veggie in the pot, no sauteing. Thank you!

I made just a few slight changes on this recipe, it had a good taste and was a definite kid pleaser. I sauteed the carrots with the celery and onion. Then, I put the veggies in the broth and let them boil alone while I cooked the chicken. I hate crispy veggies, so I wanted them to cook for longer. I seasoned the chicken with chicken seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. This made the chicken quite flavorful in the finished product. I also added 2 boullion cubes to the broth. Good for a cold, relaxed day.

I was short on chicken broth, so I made up the difference with water and chicken boullion (as suggested by another reviewer).  I also added 2 t. of parsley flakes (from my Fanny Farmer cookbook) and used 1/2 t. of black pepper and did not add any salt.

I didn't have everything to make this recipe (and I wasn't going to go buy stuff as I'm sick) but it still turned out well. I used 3 cans of chicken broth and two cans of water (about 284ml each). I cubed a chicken breast and cooked it in the broth. I didn't have egg noodles so used rainbow fusille. I also added mushrooms. I didn't have carrots which I'm sure would have helped with making the soup look brighter (it was very brown).  Still tasted good, so I will probably use this basic recipe again.

I'm not a huge fan of chicken noodle soup, so my husband rates this 5 stars.  I boiled my noodles and carrots in three cans of the chicken broth while I sauteed the celery and onion. I doubled the celery and onions.  When the noodles were done I added the remaining cans of broth to cool it down some and stop the noodles from cooking some.  I will make this for my family again, as it was a hit.

This was very good.  I used homemade turkey broth, whole wheat pasta spirals, and added garlic and red bell pepper to the sauteed veggies. I'll certainly make this again.

Perfect!  My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this, and it was so simple.  I did have to use beef stock in place of the vegtable stock....it was all I had and it worked out great!

Satisfying!  My only recommendation is to add the noodles a little later in the cooking process so they do not get so soft.

We loved this chicken soup.  I added more chicken because I had it and used thing egg noodles as that is what I had at home.  I did add 2 cloves of garlic to the sauted vegetables.  It was so good.

I think I really screwed this one up.  I made my own stock and I don't think it really turned out too well.  So I think that messed up the soup.  I would try again with store bought broth.

Really good easy to make chicken soup. I changed the seasoning to suit my family's taste. A dash of ground red pepper gives the soup a nice warming feeling. I also added mushroom, a little bit of shredded cabbage and red pepper. This will be my new chicken soup recipe.

Wow this was very tasty!! I used some of the alterations suggested by brown sugar girl and it turned out wonderfully. My husband was very impressed. I took all my left overs and put them in the freezer for a quick and easy dinner on a busy night. Thanks for the great recipe!

DELICIOUS!!  My boyfriend wasn't feeling well so I decided to make him some of this and he was amazed!!  It was SO yummy and easy to make! I saved the leftovers for my dad (who is very picky about what he eats) and he LOVED it! Definitely a keeper!  Great for the winter time...didn't change a thing in the recipe and it turned out fabulous!

We had an appetite for chicken noodle soup. So I found this recipe and was able to find all of the ingredients around my house. I made this in 1 hour including homemade noodles I found on allrecipes.com. The only thing I changed in this recipe was I added a pinch of garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, dill, and chives. Also, I added white corn and parmesan cheese. One suggestion, you may want to use more than 4 cups of chicken broth. My ingredients sucked up the broth. This was delicious!

This is a great recipe.  I actually made this twice today.  Once, for a sick friend and once for our family.  I improvised with whole wheat thin spaghetti for the pasta b/c I didn't have the egg noodles on hand and only had chicken broth.  My kids tasted the soup before I took it and loved it, so we decided to make a batch for us as well. I stopped by the store and picked up the egg noodles and some vegetable broth.  While it was good, I think we actually enjoyed the flavor the whole wheat pasta added to the soup. Try it for a variation.  It's great.

BEST comfort food!!! And soooo easy and healthy.  I use chicken breasts or thighs.  Also, I put the carrots in the pot at the same time as the celery for extra cooking time, otherwise I end up with hard carrots and soggy noodles.

Probably the best soup I've ever had. Instead of using 4 cans of broth, I used 2 and then used a thicker substitute. The soup then came out thicker and more delicious. Great for a beginner.

very nice and easy recipe.  I made a couple of modifications based on my busy schedule during the Christmas holidays.  I used uncooked chicken breasts and cooked it in the slow cooker.  The last half hour I put in the noodles.  

My husband who was outside shoveling snow during our huge winter snow storm really appreciated having an awesome soup on hand to warm up with!  

Oh, one other thing I changed... I put in the chicken broth and instead of a vegetable broth, I put in a can of cream of chicken since we like a creamier soup.

I may put just a tad bit a pepper in it as well since both he and I like a more peppery flavor.  However, I felt that it was just perfect :)

Perfect for a winter day! I didn't use any butter or saute anything, just put it all together and let it do it's thing. Instead of using chicken breast, I ended up using canned shredded chicken which worked out great so it was in every bite and I also doubled the noodles because I like a lot and less broth. Turned out fantastic! I froze the left overs and am excited to have this again!

This soup is definitely good comfort food! I used turkey that I had leftover instead of chicken. Just be careful not to let your noodles get overdone and mushy...they really dont take long at all.

This recipe rocks! I made it for a family gathering and wowed the pants off of them. One change however, I used Reames noodles (a frozen brand... more like homemade noodles), roasted a chicken and used the stock and half the meat. Oh my goodness it was amazing! This is my new favorite soup... no more Campbell's in this pantry!

This was great!  I did make several changes, however, because of what I had on hand.  First I poached the chicken in a separate pot as I sauteed one small onion, three cloves of garlic, and the carrot in some olive oil.  I didn't have whole carrots, so I sliced a cup and a half of baby carrots; this cut down on some time since I didn't have to peel them.  I used all chicken broth -- one large container of the low sodium stuff.  After putting it all together, I boiled 2 coups of egg-less egg noodles in a separate pot and then added it to the pot of soup.  For a finishing flourish, I added a handful of chopped parsley to brighten the flavors.  Such an easy and adaptable recipe!  We loved it and can't wait to try it a variety of ways; it would be great with leftover roast turkey breast, I think, or rotisserie chicken meat.  Yum!

I added a TON of veggies (sauteed the raw, but tossed in the frozen and canned later), and increased the seasoning to taste. I kept the chicken at 1/2 lb, boiled it in the broth, chopped it, and added just a tiny bit of noodles. Rotini, broken up didn't soak up the liquid and there was plenty of broth. This recipe is foolproof! Start with the recipe as is, taste it, and season to your liking. For us, 1.5 tbsp italian seasoning, a lot of garlic, and a few dashes of cayenne made it even more wonderful! Any veggies work, even diced tomatoes from the can. This recipe will absolutely be a regular.

My husband and I both LOVED this soup (a rare thing with soup). I used a cup of onion just to add a little bit more bite. Also, if you like your soup with more liquid try cooking your noodles in a separate pot. I like hearty soups so cooking the noodles in the broth worked great for us.

Really good, quick, chicken noodle soup recipe.  I cut up some raw chicken tenders and put them right in the pot once the veggies had their chance to cook.  The boil and simmer cooks the chicken right up, so this was a time saver and less dishes to wash.

I also added some garlic powder to the mix.

I finely minced up all of the vegetables so they sauteed and cooked quicker. Because of this I didn't add as much chicken broth to the soup. I was craving a bit more vegetable flavor instead of salty- so next time I will try more vegetable broth. Thank you for your recipe!

We didn't have egg noodles, so we added orzo instead, which turned out to be a great idea. This was, indeed, quick, easy, and delicious.

This was excellent. I substituted 2 32oz cartons of chicken broth, no vegetable broth, and a can of cream of chicken soup cause that's what I had. My bf, who isn't a "soup eater" gobbled this up. Thank you!

I was looking for a good chicken noodle soup and I found it. I made this earlier in the week and it was by far the best I ever made. As rec. by other reviewers I did add a couple of cloves of garlic to the celery onion mixture in the pan but the rest I followed according to the directions. It made the house smell wonderful. My husband had two bowlfuls and couldn't get enough. I'd give it more stars if I could.Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe really is quick and easy.  I made this for a sick friend who gave it 5 stars. I reduced the amount of chicken broth by 8 oz. and added a little cayenne pepper for a bit of kick.  Thanks again for the easy recipe.  No more canned soup!

This soup was pretty good but everyone noticed the different taste than what I usually make. I didn't care for the basil and oregano taste but they didn't seem to mind.

Awesome recipe! I did like ChicagoRN2 (I think!) mentioned, and I tripled the veggies, used a rotisserie chicken from the store and it was delicious! I also did as others mentioned and sauteed the veggies before putting them into the soup. I also kept the noodles separate so we can freeze the soup. This soup was delicious, and tasted like I spent all day slaving! Thanks so much!

This recipe was great, it was so easy, we didnt have veg. broth so we used an extra can of chicken broth. The whole family was choppin veggies! The only complaint was from my 10 year old son. He was not to crazy about the floating basil and oregano, so Im open to any tips on how to make it stick to chicken or noodles and not float. All in all, we will most defenitely cook this again!

Yummy, awesome and quick! My 6 yr old enjoyed adding the cans of broth to the pot. I used 4 cans of chicken broth and had to improvise with the veggie broth. Our store didn't have it so I bought Maggi brand vegetable boullion cubes and used 2 cups of water and 2 cubes in my mixing cup and added it to the soup. 

Very good for a cold wet day!!!

This was another yummy recipe!  I have already made it several times.  A day or two before I am going to make a soup, I pop several chicken breasts into the crock pot and let them cook all day.  Once the chicken is done, I shred it and store it in the fridge until I am ready to make a soup.  I have even made this soup without the noodles and it is great!

I totally changed this recipe, but I wanted to tell people about it...  I used whatever I had on hand in the pantry/fridge... 4 cans chicken broth, 1 can cream chicken soup, a packet of lipton's dry garlic and herb mix, bag of frozen mixed veggies, leftover grilled chicken, my remaining half box of fettucine noodles (broken in thirds)... let it all simmer for about an hour.. very very good!  Husband loved it!

This was excellent. The only problem I had with it is that for my family of 4 there were no leftovers.  And we love leftovers!  So if you have a big family or like leftovers, I recommend doubling the recipe.  Other than that, it was great!

This was great. We had a roasted chicken last night so I pulled off the meat from that, about 3 cups. I added the carrot to the onion and celery, next time I will add some garlic too. Instead of dried herbs, I used fresh. Additionally, I added corn, fresh from the cob and I think that made a big difference, it was a nice crunch, not the same as canned corn. I did not add the noodles, I made them separately so that I can freeze the leftover soup. Added some croutons (when serving) and it was very good and really very easy. Will absolutely make again this winter.My husband just told me that was the BEST chicken soup he has ever had. He was not excited at all about soup for lunch, in fact he wanted me to use the leftover chicken for a pot pie but was in love with the soup after the first bite. The fresh corn really added so much and the crunchy croutons on top were great too.

This recipe is amazing.  I don't even like chicken noodle soup very much but I made it because my boyfriend is a soup fiend.  I ended up eating more than he did!  The only change I made to the recipe is I added some extra spices and some white wine.  I can't tell you how much because I just eye balled it.

I, an unexperienced chef, have no clue what vegetable broth is. In wal-mart searching for ingredients I had to call my mommy to ask where I'd find some canned vegetable broth. Her response: "Go home and make some." My response: V8! Full serving of vegetables, TASTES HEAVENLY. I absolutely LOVE the chicken soup with just that little bit more of a tomato taste. Delicious recipe!!

I start with Catherine's Spicy Chicken Soup recipe to make the chicken and stock.  I also add evaporated milk at the end to give the soup a fuller flavor.

I have my daughter home sick with a cold today and I made her this soup which was great! We both loved it! I'm eating a bowl right now as I type this. A few things I changed were that I doubled the carrots and celery, and I did not put onion because I can't bare to chop one, but the good news is that I don't miss the onion at all! Thank you so much for this recipe!

This soup is amazing!  I used reduced-sodium broth, cut up one uncooked chicken breast and threw it when it it started to boil, didn't use celery (don't care for it) so I doubled the carrots.

This was a really good soup...the only thing I did differently was saute a clove of garlic along with the onions, celery and carrots.  This meal was on the table in about 40 minutes, although I was in a rush and I didn't let the soup simmer for 20 minutes.  I will definately make this again when I'm in a hurry!

Good easy recipe to have on hand. I added a few more veggies and it was very yummy. next time I think I will cook the pasta seperate and add to the broth individually. The pasta soaked up all the broth so it was more like a stew than a soup....don't know what I did wrong??? But its still a keeper. Thanks.

Make it with a left over whole chicken.  Ate whole chicken the night before and then just boiled the chicken to loosen all the meat off the bone.  I have also used this recipe with chicken breasts.  It is awesome.  My favorite recipe on the whole site!

I pre-boiled a leaftover roaster in a few cups of water and then discarded all skin, cartilege, bones, and chunks of fat.  To that I added one can of reduced-sodium broth, potatoes, carrots, celery (including some of the leaves), a can of corn (my son LOVES corn in EVERYTHING), and the stated salt, pepper, basil, and oregano.  I also added abt 3 tbsp chopped garlic, rosemary, onion flakes, and a bay leaf.  My family LOVED it!  Nothing like an easy, leftover-friendly recipe you can make while cleaning the house and doing laundry in the afternoon!

This soup was very easy and very good.  I added a little rosemary and Italian seasoning which was also nice.  I also sauteed the carrots onions and celery with a couple cloves of garlic before hand.  I was pressed for time and allowed the chicken to cook in the broth, but I think I'll try it a different way next time as the chicken didn't turn out very flavorful.  Great recipe overall.  I definitely will be cooking this again!

This was much better than anything out of a can. I used 1 tablespoon of olive oil in place of the butter and I also used organic, low sodium broth. It tasted so good! Thank you.

Great, easy recipe.  I'm sure all the suggestions are good, this is a recipe you can tinker with.  My wife and I like to roast a chicken early in the week, then use the leftovers instead of the chicken breast-- economical and great.  Usually can get a dinner plus some lunches out of this.  Fantastic Vincenzo!

My boyfriend said he wanted some homemade chicken noodle soup since he is getting a cold.  I made this pretty much as directed, I did add 2 cloves minced garlic and left out the celery ( I don't like it) and it turned out great! Real homemade flavor and its great that you can add as many or as few noodles as you want!  I used about 3 cups of noodles.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a yummy chicken noodle soup.  I used a store bought already cooked rotissire chicken and as others did I sauteed the carrots with the onions and celery.  I also added a can of cream of chicken soup and garlic powder.  Turned out delish!

The soup was delicious! I made it for our sick 12 month old, but we ALL enjoyed it. I couldn't run out to the store, so I made some substitutions - only 2 cans of chicken broth and 3 cans of veggie broth, and minced onion rather than fresh. I also took the other suggestion of sauteing the carrots along with the celery and onion. The chicken I used was from our Boston Market meal the day before. We ate almost all of the soup for dinner, but fortunately had enough for lunch the next day. YUMMY!

What a fantastic recipe!  My whole family loved it, including my picky husband.  I had to substitute with 2 cans of chicken broth, 2 cans of veggie broth and one can of water as I didn't have enough chicken broth and it still turned out great.

This was really tasty. It was pretty quick to prepare.  I used all the tips suggested by "jason".  My husband I both enjoyed it but it didn't pass the toddler test.  Might have to add some barley or rice next time to thicken it a bit to get my toddler to eat it!  Another tip - Living in the UK I haven't been able to find canned broth.  I used Knorr ready made chicken/veg stock which I diulted slightly.

This is a really good quick soup. I enjoyed it. I also added in some white pepper, a minced garlic clove, and a bay leaf. I didn't have egg noodles but had some vegetable noodles from an asian store and used them. YUM! I also made some dumplings out of eggs, flour, water and salt and dropped them in there. It was really good, especially since I have a really bad cold right now. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful recipe!  I used ground turkey rather than chicken the first time I made this, and it was outstanding!  The second time I made it, I used chicken, and I'll make it with turkey from now on.  It was certainly not bad with the chicken, though.  I cut the amount of broth in half, because it was too brothy for me, I like my soups a bit thicker.

This is so easy and delicious. I can't imagine buying canned chicken noodle soup ever again.  I like to make big batches and freeze individual portions for lunches and snacks.  I think it's even better after a few days when the flavors have had time to mingle.

I made a few very minor changes like sauteeing the onion, celery, and carrots together (and added some garlic too). Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. I used organic, all-natural chicken and vegetable broths. Easy and delicious soup.

Very good!  I doubled the veggies, chicken, and noodles to make it hearty as others mentioned.  I have already passed this one on to my mom to try.  Even better the second day.

This is very similar to my own chicken noodle soup recipe...I use chicken broth with roasted vegetables & Herbs and I throw in a few more spices then this calls for - but overall the same and it always turns out very good.  Just an FYI - if you are going to simmer all day, you do not need to sautee any of the veggies as they will cook enough throughout the day.  I also use frozen egg noodles - just add them the last hour before serving and you are good to go!

Nice easy recipe.  I like the depth of flavor that the vegetable broth adds.  A nice change from chicken-only broth.  I used roasted chicken from "Juicy Roasted Chicken".

This is the best recipe I have found for chicken noodle soup. However, I did make a few changes. I didn't have any celery so I used a can of cream of celery instead. Also I added a can of cream of chicken soup to up the flavor. Plus a couple cans of water. I also used frozen vegetables because I didn't have fresh. I put them in the skillet with the onions to make them tender. Even with the changes it turned out delish! My husband loves it too!

My whole family is sick at the moment so I decided to make some chicken noodle soup. This was a hit will my two picky children and my husband!  The only thing that I changed was using 1 can of cream of celery soup instead of the celery that the recipe called for.  Very quick and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

A hit with the entire family!  Thanks!

Only changes I made where getting rid of the carrots and adding a bit of fresh garlic when sauteing the onion and celery.

This was really good and pretty simple.  I probably used too many noodles, but I like noodles.  I used rotisserie chicken leg meat- was super tender.

This was, hands down, the best chicken soup I've ever tasted! When I saw the ingredients I thought it might be good, worst case scenario, it might be boring. It is beyond good.  My husband, son, and I were all sick and this was perfect: easy, fast, soothing and tasty. I used store-bought rotisserrie chicken and shredding the chicken was the most time consuming step. I added a minced clove of garlic to the sautee (thanks for the tip, previous reviewers!) and used low-sodium broth and extra veggies. It's now on my regular rotation and I keep some frozen for a quick, healthful lunch.

I still cannot believe how good this soup tastes versus the amount of time it takes! My memories of my mother making this was an all day process. I followed exactly except for some extra garlic (can't get enough of the stuff), and it was perfect.

I waited to add the noodles and carrots and only cooked them about 12 minutes. The noodles stayed a bit firmer and the carrots weren't too soft. We are not big fans of cooked carrots, so this was much better. great recipe!

I just made this tonight and it was delish!!!  It was just my husband and me so adjusted the recipe like this.... Sauteed about 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1 stalk celery chopped,1 thinly sliced carrot and 1 clove minced garlic.  Then added 3 cans fat-free low sodium chicken broth, 1/4 tsp each of dried basil and oregano...brought to a boil and added a little over a half of bag of Reames egg noodles, cooked for 2o minutes and added about 1 1/2 cups cut up Costco rotisserie chicken left over from night before and heated it through....couldn't be easier and couldn't be better!  Thanks allrecipes.com for such great recipes...LOVE this site!

Great soup!  I used chicken base instead of broth, left out the celery, since I didn't have any, and used left-over turkey instead of chicken.  Much better than anything out of a can.

Very Good soup, although a little lean on the ingredients, I like thick soup with lots of *stuff* in it.  So, of course I added extra of each of the ingredients.  Great quick meal though.

Just like everyone else... we loved this soup.  cold day in NY... was running late and bought a cooked chicken from the grocery store.  we had so much left over so i decided to try this.  I have been making soup for many years from scatch.  LOVED THE VEGTABLE BROTH in the soup!!  I didn't have regular liquid veggy broth so i used a package Knorrs vegtable package and added an additional 4 cps of water.  i probably tripled the recipe as well.  Between the flavor and how easy it is to make it deserves the 5 stars.  Thank you Vincenzo!!

Excellent! Takes just like homemade. I sauteed the carrots too so they would be softer. My husband scarfed it down. The recipe made just enough for 2 so if you have guests I would double or triple it.

I have used canned chicken several times and also added dried porcini mushrooms - that really enhances the dish!

This was an awesome soup.  I made a few minor changes.  Added 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt.  And I don't care for noodles, so I used a cup of brown rice.  It was delicious.

Pretty good! I made some changes:
Putting 1 bay leaf
added more carrots, celery and 1 can of corn.
Didnt have any vegetable broth so i just mix in one can of beef broth.
I cook the onion with butter and olive oil combo, then i added some garlic and mix the vegetables (celery and carrots) in together until softened.
since i dont have any basil i just add 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning. Instead of just salt i put in some seasoning salt and extra garlic powder (we love garlic too much :) 
Instead of just throwing some cooked chicken I put 2 chicken breast with rib bone inside and boiled it together with the vegetables, before i put the pasta in  i just take them out and cut into chunks.
The end result..my bf and his brother cant stop eating :)

I made this tonight and even my picky kids loved it!  From reading the other recipes and for a lack of vegetable broth, I used all chicken broth and added minced garlic.  This is a keeper!  Thanks.

Really simple and really good.  The only change I made was to add some garlic when I sauteed the the onions and celery because I add garlic to everything.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the best home made chicken noodle soup I have ever eaten, I used the broad curly egg noodles and my own home made chicken broth. I also added 1 teaspoon of chopped garlc. I cooked the chicken in he broth with salt and pepper, then took out the chicken and diced it. I then added the vegetables and simmered till vegetables were soft.

Really yummy! I used whole wheat egg style noodles for a fiber boost and added cilantro and corn for a nice twist. It came out so perfect! My two year old LOVED it.

This is an excellent and basic recipe. The only change we now make is to sautee a couple of cloves of garlic in the beginning, and sautee the carrots along with the onion and celery. Easy and perfect.

Great soup recipe!! I sauteed the carrots with the celery and onion and used more butter than what was called for.  I used 1 can of veg. broth, 4 cans chicken broth and 3 cups chicken boullion.  I also didn't have basil or oregano because they were packed (we're moving), but the soup turned out great anyway.  My husband raved about this soup; he said NO MORE condensed soup after this!! He even took the leftovers with him to work the next day and refused to share :o) Thanks for a fantastic and super easy recipe!!

This is a good starter recipe like some have already said. I made it pretty much the same except I did use homeade chicken broth. The only thing I did different was saute the carrots with the celery and onion and reduced the amt of oregano to 1/4 tsp because I don't like oregano that much. I also used vegetable bullion/water instead of ready made veggie broth. I couldn't find any in the store! This was my first attempt at making homemade chicken soup and I was very pleased. 
Oh, one more thing, I did add more salt and pepper but I don't consider that much of a change. Everyone seasons w/ salt and pepper differently!

What a quick and easy soup recipe!  I substituted turkey for the chicken. It was a delicious way to use up leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  Next time I'll try it with chicken.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good starter soup. I first tried it without changes.  It was good, but needed garlic and bay leaves.  The second time I tried the recipe, I put in any left over fresh vegetables I had on hand.  I used chicken left over from the honey chicken II recipe from this site.  It turned out great - with the addition of 2 bay leaves and garlic.

I wasn't all that impressed with this soup. I used all homemade chicken stock (Alton Brown's Good Eats recipe) and I sauted the carrots with the other veggies. Otherwise, I made it unchanged. I had to add a LOT of salt before it tasted normal. There weren't enough noodles. Add them toward the end or else they are overcooked.

So simple and quite delicious!  Used bouillon cubes of chicken broth with 5 cups of water (no vegetable broth), and replaced noodles with rice.  Used raw chicken I just threw that in with the broth.

I'd rate this recipe 3 and a half.. First off, the soup was WAY too salty. I didn't even add any salt at all. It may have been the broths, because we bought them salted. Did the ingredients mean unsalted broth? That would have definetly made it less saltier. Plus, instead of 14.5 oz of broth, we used 10 oz and added water. STILL it was salty. I used the amount instructed for the egg noodles, but after the finished look there was barely an adequate amount for four people. So then we added one and a half cups more of the noodles. Even after, when we were eating it, we said that we should've added more noodles. Anyways, the soup would be much better if you added potatoes to it!! I definetly recommend this. We didn't have any on hand, but if we did we would've added it because we add potatoes to all of our soups. Still, the soup was very quick so I give you something for that.

This made a nice quick lunch for me today. I used fat free/low sodium broth and didn't bother to saute the vegetables. I also added quite a few seasonings and some leftover spinach. Delicious and healthy. Thanks, Vincenza!

Very good!! I have never made chicken noodle soup before and this was a huge hit.  I will use broken noodles next time as I was told that the egg noodles were too hard to get on a spoon! :) Will make again! Thanks !!

Great and easy!  I was sick and was not in the mood to cook at all.  This was simple, very tasty, and I think improved my cold.  I used rice instead of noodles, added a bay leaf, cooked some cubed chicken thighs in the broth.  A winner!

Used homemade noodles.  Yummy, but just a basic chicken noodle soup.

WONDERFUL!! this is a great soup! i doubled this recipe and it couldn't have turned out any better :) the only changes i made were leaving out the onion (just personal preference) and i used 4 cans low sodium chicken broth and 4 regular, just because i was worried it would turn out too salty but i actually ended up adding salt so i don't think it would have hurt to use all regular chicken broth. i also doubled the veggies. although it's august, i still couldn't get enough of this! i sent a bowl to both of my parents and they were very impressed. i also found that this is definitely a cure to my pregnancy nausea which means this will be permanent in my recipe box :)
try this... you won't be dissapointed!!

I loved this recipe.  I didn't have enough cans of chicken broth so I had to make half of it with chicken bouillon.  The recipe made a lot, and my boyfriend and I liked it so much we ate it for 2 or 3 days, until it was gone.  I served it with freshly baked cornbread.  Delicious :)

This is fantastic. My husband loves it and he doesn't normally like chicken dishes. In place of the onion and celery, I used frozen Picsweet Seasoning Blend, which is onion, celery, and green and red bell pepper already chopped up with parsley in it. I also used frozen, sliced carrots instead of fresh. I didn't have any problem with mushy or soggy noodles like some other reviewers. Also, I froze half of the soup and that worked out well.

wonderful soup!!   I just put everything but the noodles in the slow-cooker and cooked on low for about 4-5 hours.  I added some frozen peas and cooked the noodles seperate and added them in the last 15 minutes.  the chicken broth I used seemed a little weak tasting (think it was the brand)  so instead of adding salt I added 2 chicken bouillon cubes.

I am just getting around to rating this.  I reminded myself when I made it tonight.  I made this all winter last year too. It's also great with leftover turkey.  I only do a couple things different. 1) I can't find vegetable  broth anywhere so I use an extra can of chicken broth  2) I add the carrots in with the step of the onion and celery because we like our carrots soft.  The basil and oregeno give it great flavor, I never would have thought of that.  Anyway, this is really quick and easy and definately five stars.

yummy.  added extra veggies (more carrots, some frozen peas at the end) and therefore increased liquid by added 1 1/2 C water w/ 1/2 large chicken bouillon cube.  used heaping 1/2 tsps. of spices. used costco rotisserie chicken as well.  great meal.

I didn't have vegetable stock and used tomato sauce like one reviewer suggested. It was ok, but I felt it needed more spices.

This was the best "homemade" chicken soup I've made!  It was very quick to throw together.  I didn't have celery, so I just sprinkled some celery seed for a little flavor.  My hubby who doesn't even like soup loved it!  He ate all the kids leftovers!

On its own this is a really good recipe.  I guess I was expecting something different as far as the overall taste.  Seemed to me like it was lacking something, so I added a little garlic which enhanced the flavor but didn't fill in that "missing ingredient".  However it's easy and it's pretty good, budget friendly that's for sure!
