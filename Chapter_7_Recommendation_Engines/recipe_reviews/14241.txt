I don't know how the original recipe would have come out, but w/ the way mine came out, I'd give it 5-stars! I made some minor adjustments: 
1)I added in a clove of garlic as another reviewer recommended- it was strong at 1st, but great the next day, just right. 
2)Secondly, after tasting the salad, I felt it was too "vinegary," (like another reviewer found it to be), so I added in another tbsp or 2 of oil & some more OJ (about 2-3 tbsps). An alternative would be to cut back on the vinegar to begin w/, to about 1/2 the amount.  
3)The recipe says to stir in the spinach, onion & oranges right before serving, but the next day, after having sat in the dressing, the salad tasted sensational- MUCH better! The 1st day I would have given it 3-4 stars, but the second day I'd give it 5! The spinach leaves & rice really soak up the flavor. This is definitely a salad that's better to make the night before serving. I also added in some diced cooked chicken breast I had leftover from the night before & made it into a whole meal. That was delicious! I've submitted a photo of this recipe. Hope they approve it & post it.

I MADE THIS SALAD FOR A LADIES LUNCHEON AND IT RECIEVED RAVE REVIEWS. I COOKED THE RICE IN SWANSON'S VEGETABLE BROTH AND ADDED DRIED CRANBERRIES FOR COLOR. WOULD MAKE THIS AGAIN IT IS A WINNER.

I varied the actual salad quite a bit so I can't comment on that, but this dressing is AMAZING. Seriously, it is one of the most delicious concoctions I've seen in a while! Thank you so much, I will use this as a salad dressing and a marinade. So good!

Based on a couple of reviews that said this dish was bland, I made some modifications and the dish was delicious.  I toasted some slivered almonds and added about 1 1/2 tsp. of Mrs. Dash seasonings.

For added zip, to the orange juice mixture, add on clove minced fresh garlic. Works very well.

Way too much rice for the rest of the ingredients.
But rice was good and the left over portion will make another salad.

Great 'company' dish on a hot day.  Served with BBQ chicken breast it made an awesome meal - highly recommend it!! The rice when cooling absorbs the orange juice and creates a really nice flavor.

I used white and wild rice (what I had in the pantry) and cooked it with a little butter and salt. I left out the spinach, orange and onion. Instead I used dried cranberries, apricots and golden rasins. For the dressing I doubled the orange juice and omitted the honey. This makes a wonderful salad to serve with cold chicken.

I thought the balsamic vinegar overpowered the orange and the honey.  It tasted more like balsamic vinegar rice and plain spinach.

This was a great addition to our Christmas dinner. Even the non-vegetarians liked it!  I have never cooked with brown rice before and was surprised that it stayed "stuck" together.  I was expecting it more to be a spinach salad with rice tossed in rather than rice with spinach "mixed" in.  Very unique and tasty.

Very yummy!  I reduced the onions and put half in to marinate; next time I will put all, 2 tablespoons, and leave out the spinach.  Kind of messy and superfluous.  Great citrus taste.

Love the step of adding the dressing to the (vunerable) hot rice.  I cut the spinach to match the cut of the onion and used mandarin oranges to save time.  However, my salad in the end was a little soupy and too moist.  Not sure if it was my rice preparation or the amount of dressing.

I used Mandarin Oranges and thought this was a good recipe, but a little bland.  A nice change of pace froma a pasta salad though.

This seemed a little bland.  I added sunflower seeds for a little more crunch.  Although it was fairly tasty I probably won't make it again.

We really like this salad.  I saw someone on Top Chef make a rice salad and thought it sounded good.  I added garlic to the dressing and more vinegar (we thought it was too sweet and needed more zing).  Make sure you supreme your oranges and then cut them into small pieces.  The pith would be terrible so you want to get all that off the orange.  I left out the onion, but my husband said he thinks it would have been even better with it (he likes onion, I don't and I was being lazy :)!)
Try this it's yummy!

I really enjoyed this salad. I used brown basmati rice, which is a fairly short grain and I think a long grain brown rice would have been a better choice. The dressing was awesome, I added a dash of garlic powder to it and that added just the right flavor, espcially since I didn't use any onion in the salad. If you use a really good quality balsamic vinegar it isn't going to be too strong in the dressing.

I can only review this recipe on dressing alone because I didn't use it with a brown rice salad.  The dressing is amazing, so so wonderful.  I made as is with an addition of a little cracked black pepper.  I think next time I'll increase the vinegar b/c it could use a little more zing but overall, just what I was looking for.  I used this dressing on a salad of spinich, orange segments, toasted pecans, diced red onion, and crumbled crispy bacon.  Would have added blue cheese or gorgonzolla but didn't have any.  Thanks so much for sharing.

The orange taste over powered everything, it was too sweet and made way too much.  There was closer to enough for at least 6 and possibly 8.  I ate about a cup, but my husband only picked the oranges and spinach out of his.  I won't make again.

i liked the flavor of this, but my mom and some others weren't all that impressed. first off, mine looked nothing like the picture on this site!!! i think this is probably best fresh. as it continues to sit, the flavors do enhance, but the oranges become bitter and the spinach wilts.

I followed the directions exactly - it came out very dry.  Made it for a birthday BBQ ~ my guest ate it but I didn't get any compliments from those who usually love my cooking.  I wouldn't make this rice salad again ..

Not sure if this was mentioned, but I used mandarin oranges (canned) with the juice instead of the oranges.

Delicious

I chopped the spinach so it would be easier to eat. Will chop finer next time.
