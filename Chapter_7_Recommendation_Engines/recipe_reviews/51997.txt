********** Oustanding! Marinated this for 5 hours, in a ziplog bag. Wish I had done it overnight, but still had a nice flavor. Mixed everything up right in the bag (added one extra clove of garlic for good measure), the meat was 2.38 lbs and the marinade amount was fine. One trick: measure out the oil first, then the mustard, it will just slide out of the measuring spoon from the oil residue! Put on direct heat on grill to brown on all sides, then proceeded to cook it on indirect heat for about one hour (I like to make sure that pork is really done). This is company worthy. Sliced into one inch medallions and served with mashed potatoes, green beans and homemade bread. Pound cake for dessert. Try this, you will not be disappointed!

This was really good! Like others, I decided to bake this in the oven. I baked it @ 375 for 45 min. It turned out perfect, and the marinade was delicious. Thanx for sharing!

I've made this quite a few times and have loved it each and every time!  I did make a few substitutions as follows: stone ground mustard in place of dijon and light tasting olive oil in place of the sesame oil.  I also baked the tenderloin in a moderate oven and watched the internal temp closely as not to overcook.  With the leftover marinade, I threw it in a saucepan on the stove and reduced it so I could add it back over the meat after slicing.  This recipe is a keeper in my book!

I used 4 boneless chops (1/2" to 3/4" thick), I used real maple syrup & I did add a  bit of low sodium soy sauce as suggested by reviewers. And I went heavy on the pepper...that does a lot to cut through the excessive sweetness. I also added a little extra garlic &  resrved some of the marinade to pour over the chops while cooking. Instead of grilling, I baked in 375 oven, covered in foil for 40 minutes, uncovered & baked for another 20. These were excellent! I served them w/ Green Beans with Almonds, Autumn Apple Salad II, Pumpkin Rolls II & a glass of white zin.  These dishes paired together so well & tasted so seasonal that hubby said it was the best meal we've had in a long time....and we eat good! LOL Thanks Lesley!!!

My package of pork tenderloin came with 2 that were each over a pound.  This was plenty of marinade for both.  It was so juicy and tender and the flavor was fantastic.  I marinated the pork in a gallon sized zip loc bag in the frig, turning it now and then so it was really immersed in the marinade.  It was actually better than pork tenderloin we've ordered at restaurants.  My only comment is that if you are going to use the marinade that the pork has been sitting in you should definitely place it in a saucepan and boil it (not heat it at low heat) before basting the pork.  Better yet, make extra and use that to baste while cooking.  Then slice the tenderloin and drizzle some of the remaining sauce over the top.  It's wonderful.

This was so delicious!  I wish I could give it ten stars...I marinated the tenderloins overnight and didn't have sesame oil so I used olive oil instead.  I also baked it at 375 for 45 minutes - I can't imagine it being any better!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was great. We decided to cook this in the oven instead of the grill. It took about an hour for it to bake. It was very tender! We will have this again.

This was very good, and easy.  I let it marinade for a day.  The only thing I would change would be to double the marinade, it was delicious and would have been better to have extra, like a gravy. Yum.

Outstanding!  But to fully appreciate the myriad of flavors, please  do not use olive oil in place of the sesame oil as some reviewers have done.  By doing so, the flavor of the pork changes and the recipe doesn't reach it's full potential. This is an excellent recipe as written and one I hope I NEVER lose.  Thank you Lesleycan for sharing!

Great recipe! I read the reviews and came up with a winner! I used the mild and creamy Grey Poupon for the dijon mustard. I used jarred minced garlic and olive oil instead of sesame. I used 3/4 c. of regular syrup and added 1 tsp. of soy sauce. This created the perfect marinade- sweet but not overpowering. I pierced the meat with a fork and placed it in a large baggie and marinated over night. To cook, I placed it in a 13x9 sprayed with Pam and then sprinkled the tenderlion with some salt and dried minced onion. I baked it in the oven at 375 for 35 mins (it was only a 1 lb. loin). Meanwhile I boiled the marinade to reduce and cook it. I sliced the pork and drizzled the marinade over top. Served with broccoli, roasted potatoes and biscuits. Great meal! Wonderful flavor!

This was great! And I only marinated for about an hour. I cannot imagine how good it would taste if it marinated for the full time. Served with some chipotle mashed sweet potatoes. Again, this was really delicious -- one of those "Wow" recipes.

Maple and Garlic- my two favourite flavours! I've never made tenderloin before trying this recipe and it was awesome- used extra virgin olive oil instead of sesame oil (didn't have any), and whole grain Dijon mustard (gave it a nice texture and appearance), and I baked it in the oven at 375 for 45 minutes- turned out PERFECT!

I threw out the rest of the marinade  the first time I made it, but I just made it again and I reduced the marinade and thickend with flour and it was EXCELLENT!

I was disappointed with this one.  I made the marinade exactly as written, marinated pork chops instead of a tenderloin for a day and a half, then prepared to grill.  When I opened the bag that I was marinating in, I knew we were in trouble.  All I could smell was the sesame oil.  So I whipped up some more of the "sauce" without the sesame oil.  Grilled my chops, basting frequently.  They looked delicious...the grill caramalized the glaze nicely without burning (thanks to low heat).  Looks can be deceiving, I guess.  They were not good.  The sesame was totally overpowering...it was the only thing we could taste.  It would probably be great without it...in fact, the separate glaze that I made WAS good without the sesame oil.  With the oil, though, it left me with lots of leftovers that I know are not going to get eaten.  We like sesame oil, too...it just didn't belong here.  We have always used it more as a condiment (like a drop in our Oriental Shrimp Noodle bowls).  I think we'll keep using it that way and leave it out of our marinades from now on.

This was AWESOME! It's officially being added to the three prok recipes I cook regularly. I didn't marinade it, I cooked it like I normally cook pork: 325 for 1 hour (this sears it) with salt and pepper, then added the sauce and cooked for about 45 more minutes (it was a large tenderloin). Also, I use less maple, about a half cup, mixed with 2 tbsp or so of dijon mustard and 6 large minced garlic cloves. SOOO delicious!

This was wonderful - the whole family loved it - I even made a chicken breast with the same ingredients for a family member who prefers not to eat pork.  It was wonderful on the pork and the chicken!!!

A big hit with my family.  Absolutely delicious!  I used the exact ingredients in the recipe, but roasted the tenderloin in a 375 degree oven for one hour (first 30 min. covered with foil, last 30 min. uncovered).  I basted during the last half hour of cooking.  I reduced down the marinade while the roast rested (tented) and used it as a sauce, as others have suggested.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and Parmesan Asparagus (from this site)---we love garlic.  I will definitely prepare this on my grill when the weather here in Mass. gets better/warmer.  I will probably make two roasts, and use the leftovers for Cubanos.  Thank you, LESLEYCAN, for this outstanding recipe.

Oh this was just excellent! What a gorgeously yummy maple flavour, after all that basting on the grill, you get a nice, carmelized coating! It did take about 35 minutes to cook though as the BBQ we have at the cottage runs hot so hubs turned one burner off and then cooked it until intermal temp at the widest/thickest part was 160F.  Then we let it sit for 10 minutes and rest.  Served with wild/brown rice mix and steamed broccoli and fresh garlic bread - excellent meal!! Thanks for the great recipe! will be making this again!

I haven't tried this recipe but I'm telling you I would be afraid to marinade pork in anything and then re-use the marinade for basting!  This sounds delicious but I think that what I would do is whip up a new batch of marinade for basting!

I have to start out by saying that I'm not normally a fan of sweet meats, but this is an exception! And please, for the love of all that's holy, DO NOT skimp and use "fake" syrup (ie: pancake syrup)!!! Pancake syrup is NOT maple syrup and you'll be cheating yourself if you use anything but the real deal!  

I made the recipe exactly as written. I put the marinade in a ziploc bag, let the excess air out, and left the meat to marinate for approx. 20 hours, turning it a few times. The package of pork I bought had 2 tenderloins in it but I only made one. There was plenty of marinade. If you're only going to cook one tenderloin, then you can likely get away with cutting the recipe in half. I mean, we're talking maple syrup here. It's not cheap.

I seared the tenderloin on the grill for about 5 minutes, then finished cooking it over indirect heat for another 25 mins. It was done to perfection, still slightly pink in the middle. I didn't bother basting the meat as it cooked because I didn't want it to turn out too sweet.

I served the tenderloin with baked sweet potatoes and drizzled the reduced-down marinade over the potatoes. OMG, excellent!  Such a great pairing.

I will definitely make this again.

Pork chop heaven.  I added a splash of soy, made the full amount of marinade for just four chops...I marinated them overnight and all day.  I baked them uncovered at 375 for 45 minutes basting with all but enough marinade to top them when serving.  Perfect.

This is out of this world!! I have been looking for a marinade recipe for pork tenderloin that actually makes the pork flavorful and stays that way throughout cooking. This was a homerun in my book! I have made this twice in a 6 week period and this is my favorite recipe from this site thus far (and that's saying a lot because I have found a ton on here that my family really enjoys!). I did double the garlic and black pepper to help cut the sweetness of the maple syrup and instead of basting the tenderloin with the marinade, I reduced it and served it over the pork. I also mixed all the marinade ingredients together in a gallon Ziploc bag as someone suggested and put my tenderloins (I had two) in the bag with the marinade in the refrigerator for a full 24 hours, turning the bag over once halfway through. I grilled the pork for about 45 mins, flipping once halfway through. It was perfectly cooked that way..cooked thoroughly, but not overdone which can dry it out. I want to try this with some bone-in chicken breasts on the grill next. Try this recipe...you will not be disappointed!! Thanks Lesley!!

We didn't really like the maple aspect of the marinade. Reminded us too much of breakfast.

I made this tonight, used the oven instead of the grill since it was snowing. I halved the syrup but used all of the other ingredients from the original recipe. It was just my husband and I so I placed half of the pork back into the turned off oven to keep warm while we had dinner. When I pulled it back out the sauce had carmelized the garlic. My husband absolutely loved this!!!!! Great recipe I will make this again. :)

Fantastic!  Hubby loved it.  I was dubious of the marinade combo - but it turned out delicious... Easy breezy recipe for the "keepers" file.  :)

There are better recipes out there for pork tenderloin.  As some others have indicated, this is very sweet.  The tiny amount of sesame oil seemed to be lost and I didn't even notice the mustard.  It was edible, but not interesting.  I will continue the quest for recipes to huge up a huge bottle of maple syrup purchased for the last family reunion.

This was a good recipe. I definitely recommend adding salt to the marinade. I also roasted this pork loin in the oven, and I'm in Colorado at 6,000 feet above sea level, so cooking time for me was more like 1 hour and 15 minutes at 375 degrees. It turned out really good. I boiled the leftover marinade and used as a drizzle once the pork loin was done, as other people suggested. I ate two little inch-wide sections, and my husband ate the rest! He loved it. Will definitely make again, and will probably try this great marinade on chicken too.

I followed some other reviewers and really enjoyed this dish! Cut maple syrup (100% pure) to 3/4 of a cup, left out oil, added 1 TBS soy sauce and some ground ginger to the marinade. Marinated in the fridge overnight and then baked at 375 for 40 minutes.  I also sprinkled the tenderloin with salt and pepper before baking hoping to cut the sweetness a bit and reduced the extra marinade and served it with the final product.

Very disappointing given the reviews.  I've not played with it, but suspect brown sugar & maple flavoring would do the job, especially where real syrup rapidly loses its flavor at elevated temperatures. I followed the recipe exactly and even pierced the meat extensively w/ the Jaccardi before marinating 24 hours, but there was only the slightest hint of maple in the finished dish. And cooking the residual marinade for a topping removed all maple flavor, but intensified the mustard, leaving a very sour sauce which was largely a non-starter. If I should make it again (unlikely) I will do extensive tweaking and definitely not sacrifice genuine syrup.

Tried this the first time on Sunday with a port tenderloin and we are having ribs marinade in this tomorrow.  This was fantastic.  So I'm off to throw together this easy, delicious marinade.  I used sugar free maple syrup and extra garlic.

Wow.  This is just fantastic.  Do NOT substitute anything else for the genuine maple syrup (pancake syrup is a big NO) or the sesame oil (NOT the same as olive oil or veg oil at all)…. They have very distinct, smoky-sweet flavors that are absolutely perfect opposite the mustard and garlic for this recipe.  I had what I thought was one tenderloin at 2.38 lbs but it turned out to be two separate tenderloins at a little over a pound each.  Like others, I made extra marinade and boiled/reduced it on the stove while the pork cooked in the oven (at 375 for 35-40 minutes).  Used a meat thermometer to make sure it came to 160 degrees internal temp and then rested the meat for about 10 minutes.  I also basted it with the reduced marinade just once, and that was immediately once I took it out of the oven.  While cooking, the marinade that ran off the pork did burn but not the marinade that was actually on the pork.  It was super tender, moist, smoky/sweet/savory, and sliced into medallions that I drizzled the sauce over…. Well, it was perfection.  I served it with Baked Sweet Potatoes that I found on this site that is a roasted, non-sweet version of the veggie.  They paired wonderfully, but this would be magnificent sliced over simple, whipped Yukon Golds and then drizzled with the sauce.  Leftovers would also be amazing sliced and served as sandwiches on Hawaiian rolls.  Out of the park delicious… one of the best things I have ever cooked!!!

UPDATE: leftovers on Hawaiian rolls - FAB!

This is a FANTASTIC meal. I browned it for a few minutes on top of the stove to lock in the moisture and then baked it at 350 degrees for 40 minutes. I checked with a meat thermometer. It is excellent cold and on a sandwich. ABSOLUTELY the best pork I have ever made.

I made this tonight and it was good, a bit too mustardy for me, but next time I make it I will just cut down on the mustard.  I let in marinate for 8 hours and I must say it was juicy!  I did make it in the oven at 350 and I'm not sure but I think it took about an hour, I just cooked in until reached 160.

I find using 1/2 real Maple syrup and 1/2 Heinz Worcestershire works. Thats a secret. Other brands of Worcestershire don't work as well.

This was delicious! I pretty much followed the directions except I baked it in a 400 degree oven for about an hour instead of grilling it.  It turned out perfectly and both my husband and I loved the sweet flavor of the maple syrup.  I will be making this again.

I added a bit of tamari soy to cut the sweetness of the maple syrup and it was superb.  I also froze the tenderloin in the marinade in a zip lock bag and OMG it was delish.... my dinner guest thought it was high end restaurant quality.

I think that this was too sweet for such a naturally good peace of meat. i think just a simple spice rub tastes the best and creates a "crust" that tastes amazing!

Fantastic.. I just used 1 /2 cup of maple syrup and  another clove of garlic.  I marinated it for about six hours, 375  in oven for about 40 minutes.  It was perfect.  I let is sit about five minutes.  My dh  agreed if we would have had it in a fine restaurant we would go back for it.  Somehow, it isn't the same in my kitchen.   Dish's, TV, etc...  I baked some little potatoes with it and had fresh green beans. I would have had a salad but I screwed up my new computer and was a little uptight  with that.

Oh dear - I *really* wanted to like this, but as others have said it's terribly sweet - too sweet for out tastes anyway.  While mixing up the marinade, I was thrilled - the sesame oil and mustard seemed to mitigate the sweetness of the syrup .... but after grilling, the syrup dominated.  So so sorry -

WOW! Marinated the pork for nearly 12 hours and after grilling the taste was fantastic! I can only imagine if i use real maple syrup. My girlfriend's mom can't stop talking about the tenderloin and how tasty it was. Definitely a keeper! Next time i'll add a few more hot spices to give it a sweet and spicy taste, but really the taste couldn't be beat. It took about 15 minutes to cook on my grill.

This had a lot of flavor! I doubled the recipe because the tenderloin was larger than 1 1/2 pounds. I may have used extra garlic ;-P Marinated almost a full 24 hours. I cooked it on the grill, one side on high, the other side with the pork on low. The fat did get pretty charred, ok, black. Next time, I'll use boneless pork. I'll also marinate the bones(I'll debone it myself) and cook them right along with the loin, on lower hear, for a longer time. It was on the grill at least 30 minutes, and still wasn't done. I was in a hurry, so I cut it off the bone, sauteed it for 5 minutes on high, along with the marinade that I had brought to a boil while the meat was on the grill. Really good flavor. I may marinate even longer than just 24 hours. It wasn't OMG best dish EVER, but it was tasty and easy!!

Very nice recipe.  I marinated about 3 lbs of tenderloin in the amount of marinade called out for 1.5 lbs and there was plenty.  The only changes I made to the marinade were to add one additional tbsp of mustard and about 1 tsp of orange zest, which was a tasty touch.  Baked at 375 for 45 mins (no basting).  For the sauce, I reduced over medium high heat, then mixed in a little butter and flour.  The meat turned out moist and not too sweet.  The sauce was, of course, sweet and delicious with the pork.  Very easy and a hit at the buffet table.

This is the 2nd time I make this recipe and OM GOSH! Delicious, It was actually our big family dinner for Xmas! Everyone loved it, even my vegetarian sister had to try it because of everyone's comments! The only think I changed was I baked 375 for 45 min it instead of grilling it. I accompany the tenderloin with some oven roasted red potatoes and a green spinach fresh salad to break the sweetness. Other than that, followed the recipe to the "T"...

This marinade is great.  I added a little bit of soy sauce to the marinade in the cooking step because we aren't big into really sweet sauces and wanted the extra to go over the meat. If you don't mind sweet sauces it is excellent as written.

This was entirely too sweet and certainly did not need the extra sauce for dipping.  Perhaps less syrup and more mustard, but I will not be making it again.  It was a waste of a lot of good maple syrup.

Turned out awesome, merinated over 24 hours. I would proudly serve this to company and it's simple. We served it with super sweet corn in season and it was the perfect compliment along with garden fresh tomatoes and delicata squash laced with butter and brown sugar. It was an outstanding meal. Thanks.

Outstanding! Remember to keep the heat low or the marinade will burn. I boiled the extra marinade for a few minutes and used it for basting. There was lots of extra marinade/sauce.  You could get away with decreasing it unless you want lots drizzle with after you serve. This was so delicious.  I served it with a side of sesame noodles and steamed carrots.

So glad we tried this!  My fussy boyfriend said its the best tenderloin he's ever had.  I increased the marinade by 50%, marinated in half of it over night and then all day.  When I put it in the baking dish, I drizzled on some of the marinade, then baked it at 350 degrees for 40 mins covered and another 25 mins uncovered (basted twice), we like it a bit browned.  Came out perfectly!  Served with rice and green beans, spooned the remaining sauce (which I had reduced on the stove) over the meat.  Yum-o!

This dish is so delcious!  The sweetness of the maple syrup is wonderful with pork.  I baked the tenderloin in the oven on 375 for about 40 minutes and served it with roasted broccoli and grape tomatoes.  Our 2 and 3-year old ate their share without a fight.

Loved this as a stirfry with sliced pork tenderloin and adding a little soy sauce, makes a great sauce with chow mein noodles as well with the pork and vegies (carrots,onions, celery) with a sprinkle of sesame seeds.  My husband loved it.

This is a great recipe - and my confession is that I only had time to marinade it for an hour, and it was still very tasty. I made as directed, but reduced the maple syrup by 1/3 cup after reading some of the reviews. I drained the marinade and cooked it in a small pot for 10 minutes to make sure it was safe to use as a sauce, and then baked the pork for 40 minutes at 350 (until an internal temperature of 165 degrees F). Great company fare.

I really enjoyed this marinade on pork tenderloin and think I would like it equally as well on grilled salmon with the addition of a little soy.  I did use spicy brown mustard in place of the dijon and could still have used a little something else to cut some of the sweetness of the syrup, but it is what it is and you get exactly what you are expecting after reading the ingredients.  I marinated the pork about 20 hours and grilled it.  Served with herb butter rice and roasted butternut squash.  Will definately use this again.  Thanks for sharing.

This was extremely good! I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing! I served this at an Autumn themed dinner last night along with Wild Rice Stuffed Squash, Eat Michigan Salad and Green Beans for a Special Occassion, all from AR, and guests loved it. I did have to use the oven because it's cool here now. I convection baked 350 for 40 minutes and rested 10. I boiled the marinade and basted every 15. Thanks for nice recipe! I'll be making this again and will take it to the grill in the Spring!

Made it as direceted.  I didn't think I'd like this, but made it anyway because I thought the kids would like it. I took the advice of another reviewer to up the sauce by 50% so I could use it as a glaze after.  I think it's really important to this recipe that you cook it on the grill.  It was really tasty, but I think the glaze is what made it.  I tasted the pork without the extra glaze and it was good, but not outstanding by itself.  I would make this again.

I made this yesterday, using a 3-1/2 pound boneless pork roast, which I had marinated overnight.  What a delicious flavor, tenderness and so juicy.  I roasted in the oven at 375 for 1 hour and it was perfect!  I made gravy using the potato water, drippings, dijon and a tablespoon of maple syrup.  It was delicious and my family voted it a "keeper" for sure!  The amount of marinade was just right, even for this larger roast.  I am looking forward to some delicious sandwiches today with the leftovers.

I made this recipe tonight for my husband and I as we are always looking for something to change things up.  We have a wonderful Marinade for Pork Tenderloin and thought we would give this recipe a try.  After trying this recipe we thought that it had a wonderful flavor and smelt awesome while it was cooking on the grill, hand neighbor's coming out of their houses wondering what we were cooking.  Will definately keep this recipe for future meals!

Loved it!  I used a pork tenderloin and pre-sliced it, before I marinated it overnight in a ziploc baggie. Baked it at 375 for ab half an hour and it was delicious! poured a little bit of the boiled marinade and it was heaven! yummy!

Delicious.
The pork was so tender and the sauce is great on it.
Here is what I did:

I marinated 12 hours in tight ziploc bag in frig.
About an hour prior to cooking I emptied pork and sauce into pot and pierced pork with fork several times and let it sit out at room temp.
Just prior to pan searing I sprinkled with ground pepper and coarse salt and coated with flour. Did the same to every side then seared each side for 1 min. each in very hot oil in iron skillet.
Remove loin, wipe out hot skillet and then lightly oil, put tenderloin back in skillet and drizzle with a little of the marinade. {I also had potato wedges tossed with Smart Balance, salt,pepper and garlic powder to bake in the pan surrounding the pork. yummy.}
I covered with aluminum foil, put the covered skillet on an old baking sheet and put in a pre-heated 375 oven. I let it cook 50 mins covered and slightly broiled uncovered a couple of mins then let it repose a bit... served it with the marinade (that I had boiled well!)
This was really good.
Oh yes... I didn't have sesame oil so I used tahini and olive oil.  Instead of 1/2 tsp sesame oil I used 1 tsp tahini and 1/2 tsp olive oil. I'm not sure the tahini offered much sesame flavor though.
This recipe is a keeper.

I made this as directed and it turned out very good! I marinated it for over a day. I prefer a little stronger of a flavor which is why I gave it 3 stars. I wish the marinade would have thickened up more for me so next time I'll try it with pure maple syrup.

This was delicious!  I grilled the pork for 25 minutes, then tented with foil for about 10 minutes.  It was tender and juicy.  The gravy from the marinade was delicious with our roasted sweet potatoes fries - would be great over mashed potatoes or rice, too!

this was very good and easy to make, but I found it to be a little too sweet. Next time I want to add more Dijon mustard and a less maple syrup.  I cooked it in the oven at 375 for about 45 minutes, so very juicy, I also threw it under the broiler for a few seconds to crisp up the outside

I used another poster's suggestion and added 3 T soy sauce to cut the maple sweetness. I marinated the tenderloin overnight, turning it several times. Since I'm not a whiz using our charcoal grill, I baked the pork in the marinade in a glass dish in the oven at 375 for an hour, turning the tenderloin occasionally and basting it with a brush after slicing and placing on the serving plate. It was absolutely scrumptious, not to mention super-easy to prepare! I served it with the sesame green beans, also found on this site(also a winner!).

I really didn't change this recipe and I'm glad I didn't. The hubby was drooling for more and asked if we could have it again really soon. No better review than that!

I'd give this 2.5 stars if I could.  I used good quality ingredients and followed the recipe exactly.  The flavors didn't blend well for us.  The Dijion mustard was a big turn off (and we like dijion mustard).  Not to our tastes at all.  Oh well, you don't hit a home run with every recipe.  Definitely original and creative, though.  Thanks for sharing.

You have got to try this marinade! I followed it exactly. Marinated the pork loin for 24 hours. I have never tasted a pork tenderloin this juicy and flavorful!! First time I had ever grilled a pork loin. It's important to cook each side (4) for about 5 minutes to sear it all around, then lower the heat and let it cook until done. It took about 30 to 35 on a med-to low grill. Let the loin rest for 10 minutes before you serve. I saved some of the marinade to pour over the pork when I served it. This is a WOW recipe!! I am gonna make this again for sure! Husband really loved too and he is a true food critic! :) Thank you Lesleycan for sharing this yummyness with all of us!! It is a real keeper.

This was AMAZING.  The marinating time is VERY important, as well as the continuous basting.  All the flavors had a chance to soak into the meat, and the basting kept the meat moist while it was cooking.  My husband wants me to put this recipe on top of my folder and flag it as a favorite.  :)  Very Delicious!

this was a huge hit. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Marinated tenderloin in ziplock about 6 hrs. then baked this in the oven. I baked it @ 375 for 45 min. Since I wanted to make this a full meal & didn't want to have to cook anything separately... I included on the baking dish: large red potatoes cut in half, cut yams same size as potatoes (2"), carrots (2"), & onions quartered.  Used meat thermometer to make sure pork was done. Soooo good!!

My husband and I enjoyed this for supper tonight. I followed the recipe precisely except I had 2 tenderloins, each 1 1/2 lbs.  I marinated them overnight and cooked them on the grill. It took about 40 min. The only thing I didn't see mentioned is I noticed scum on the top of the sauce when I boiled it so I skimmed it off. We decided this recipe is a keeper. My hubby drizzled the sauce on his pumpernickel bread.  Next time I'll double the sauce for 2 tenderloins because it will probably be for guests.

I don't usually like the taste of pork, but this recipe makes tenderloin grill up  fork-tender and with an Asian-style taste. Paired with grilled sweet potatoes and roasted corn on the cob, this made for an easy Sunday-quality dinner cooked completely outside while sitting and enjoying the view from the deck. My husband, teenager, and toddler all loved it.

This was AWESOME!!  I cooked it in oven at 350 until it was 160 degrees inside.  I didn't have sesame oil or dijon so i used olive oil and tangy mustard.  Made extra sause to dip in.  It was SOOO good.  Sweet potato and green beans were perfect compliment!

Very flavorful! I would definitely make this again, but I would probably try to cut the sweetness a tad with more black pepper or a little less maple syrup.

Oh...this is so good, my family loved it!. I made the recipe exactly as written. I did use 2-1 1/2 lb pork tenderloins but did not double the marinate, there was plenty for both. Marinated the pork for about 24 hours, started it out on the grill for about 25 minutes, basting several times and then put it into the oven at 350 for another 25 minutes until the internal temp of the pork was 160 degrees. Can't wait to make it again!

This was ok....
I had high hopes for this one but it was kind of a strange, bland taste.  Perhaps I didn't let it marinate long enough (although it was in the marinade all day at work).

This was a success!  The flavours were complimentary, the sweet and salty.  The pork was tender and juicy.  I served it over a bed of basmati rice and the sauce was an incredible topper.  I accompanied the meat with some satayed peppers (grn, red & yellow).

Absolutely delicious! The next time I make this however I am going to cut the tail off and BBQ it separately only 15 minutes or until done, so that it doesn't dry out I gave samples to two colleagues and now they want thr recipe. Great

We made these with REALLY thick pork chops instead of tenderloin and they turned out really well.  The maple was mildly sweet and pleasant.  I gave only 4 stars because I couldn't taste the garlic at all, even though I used a heaping spoonful.

Very Juicy! Made a few changes......3/4 cups maple syrup, used about 2-3 tble of soy sauce instead of sesame oil, doubled everything else. Marinate for a day in the refrigerator. Kept a low-med on the grill. Baste while grilling. Great flavor and not too sweet!

This is a great recipe. The sesame oil adds a great flavour, so I wouldn't suggest leaving it out. I cut the marinade in half (because maple syrup is very expensive!) and there was just enough of it. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good! I ran out of maple syrup so used 1/2 cup of maple syrup and 1/2 cup of pancake syrup. Also used a little extra garlic. Used boneless pork chops and baked at 375 for 40 minutes. Definitely needed a little salt but even my toddler ate it and he doesnt eat meat usually! Will make again.

Can really taste the maple syrup, was good.  A bit difficult to BBQ, you have to watch as the maple syrup makes them sticky and will stick to the BBQ even with oiling the grates.

Marinated overnight. Found this to be very tender, but lacking in flavor. Probably won't make it again.

I made this tonight, but used two boneless pork chops, nearly an inch thick. I cut the marinade amounts in half, except the garlic, used two big cloves minced up. Used about 1/4 tsp. of ground black pepper. Let it marinate in a plastic bag for about 9 hours. Baked at 375 covered for 40 minutes, uncovered for 30 minutes which may have been a tad too long but I hate undercooked pork so I had to do it! I baked the chops in an 8x8 glass dish. In the same dish I placed 9 new baby red potatoes, halved, tossed in a little olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Excellent meal, paired with steamed asparagus. Next time I will make extra marinade to heat up and use as a sauce for the meat & potatoes.

Made this last night for guests. Everyone loved it! Substituted olive oil for sesame and used 100% maple syrup. Baked in oven at 375 for 45 min. in a foil lined baking dish. Clean up was a snap. My husband loves pork tenderloin and he said this was his favorite. Will definitely make again!

I read this recipe very quickly and then jumped into it without referring back. As a result, I added about 1/4 the syrup and an equal amount of sesame oil. I only had about three hours to marinate and it turned out very well, probably because the limited time kept the sesame oil in check. I will try it again, as it was intended.

Very yummy!  I must say, I was skeptical as was my husband, but after all the rave reviews, we had to give it a try--we will again!  My husband was wishing there was more marinade to put on our potatoes, so maybe I'll double the marinade next time.  I followed the recommendations to use olive oil and stone ground mustard.  I also used homemade syrup (very easy!  from this site.)  So yummy!  We will be making this again!

WOW!!  This was very good!!  After marinating the tenderloin, I reduced the marinade in a saucepan, but I guess I got a little carried away and reduced it too much.  Be warned:  this reduction thickens as it cools.  Even though mine drizzled over the meat nicely when hot, as it cooled on the plate it became a thick, sticky goo.  Still tasted great, but I'll have to be more careful next time.  My error.  Hubby and I both really liked this one.  Thank you!

I was worried after reading reviews saying it was too sweet.  But I tried it anyways and I'm glad I did.  It was really tasty.  I put about 2 tbsp of soy sauce, more garlic and mustard.  If you like teriyaki sauce, then I think you will like this recipe.

Good marinade-I used light maple syrup just to cut back on the calories.  I also roasted the tenderloin instead of grilling it, and it was delicious.

Really good!  It also makes your house smell awesome.  I baked mine for 45 minutes at 375.  The next time I make this I might add a little more mustard and I might use a grainier mustard for a little more 'oomph.'

I was torn between two or three stars with this recipe. It was just too terribly sweet. I opted to go for the three stars because of the potential for this recipe. I made this according to directions so I could evaluate it accordingly, but I'm sorry I didn't follow my instincts and limit the amount of maple syrup. The meat was not affected, but a sauce is needed for this that is not so sweet. Maybe I will try this again in the distant future and use soy sauce as others have suggested. I'm afraid of ruining another meal which would only be too salty, though. Maybe a red wine based sauce? There are many people who enjoy overpowering sweetness, but my family doesn't-especially not for the main course.

I added bourbon to the marinade, poked the pork loin with a fork so it would absorb, and the roast was very good and tender.

Tried this for the first time tonight as part of a family dinner with guests.  Fantastic!   A few things that I changed up.  1) I didn't use Sesame Oil because we aren't fans and we didn't have any. I was going to use Olive Oil, but we'd used the last of that as well, so the recipe was oil free. I didn't miss it.  2) I used slightly less Maple Syrup (3/4 cup) and added 1 Tbsp. of Soy Sauce to cut down on some of the sweetness (as per some suggestions in the comments of the recipe). I also used twice as much garlic, because garlic is great.  3) I also don't really like Dijon Mustard, so I just used regular Yellow Mustard. Again, was fine.  It was really good.  I'll be making this again, happily.

This is the best pork tenderloin recipe I have made! I was really worried about using the sesame oil because usually it's very overpowering in recipes, but in this recipe it works out very well. I will definitely be making this recipe over and over.

This was really good! I bought a bunch of pork tenderloins when they were on sale, marinated them, and then froze them. This is the first one I've eaten and it turned out great! Freezing also worked really well. Just place the tenderloin and marinade in a plastic bag, seal, mix, and freeze. Let thaw in the fridge and then cook as per directions (or bake @375 for 45 minutes). I will definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe, doubled the garlic as we love garlic!! Marinated for over 24 hours and the maple syrup was soaked right into the meat which was so tasty and tender. Cooked on the BBQ which allowed the syrop to candy on the meat..MMMmmm!!

This marinade makes a really good tasting pork tenderloin. I also baked the meat in a 375 degree oven,but I marinated it in a disposable bag,and dumped everything in the baking dish. I didn't do the stove top reheat step of the marinade,and the meat turned out moist,flavorful and perfect. I baked it for about 30 minutes covered,and about 20 mintues uncovered,then I let it rest for a few minutes,covered. My family loved it. Its a keeper :)

Very good! I made the marinade as written. You will likely need a little more cooking time than stated. I highly recommend increasing the marinade ingredients by 50%, then reducing your reserved marinade to a syrup consistency in your saucepan while the meat is cooking, and drizzling over it when served. Yum. Thanks for the recipe!

This is such a simple recipe and it tastes wonderful. I was only able to marinate it for about 2 hours, but it still turned out well. I followed other reader's suggestions and added a little bit of soy sauce and more maple syrup so there would be more gravy to pour over the cooked pork. My entire family loved this. I served it with Armenian style pilaf and steamed, buttered zucchini. Delicious. I've enclosed a photo too, you can see the steam rising from the pilaf, which was sitting right next to the pork!

Great recipe.   Used light maple pancake syrup (didn't have the other)  and baked in toaster oven for 30 min at 400. Used blender to mix all ingred. so it was frothy marinade but it stayed on better that way.    Will do again for sure.

I opted to use this on pork chops.  I think my biggest mistake was baking instead of grilling.  Very subtle taste, rather bland.  Will definately grill if I ever make them again.

Absolute fantastic!  I try to use indirect heat on the BBQ when I am cooking this.  Very nice along with Risotto and grilled veggies!  My in-laws are not the biggest pork fans and they loved this recipe.  Huge hit in my house!

I loved this! I let it marinate for 8 hours and wish I had done it for longer. Definitely be careful not to cook on too high of heat, the marinade will definitely burn. We cooked this on the grill and it was excellent!

This is a great recipe. I followed other users reviews and added a substantial amount of soy sauce to the recipe. The garlic sounded like a lot, but I follow the recipe and it turned out great. I've done this twice and I think the key is letting the meat marinade overnight. Family and friends give this rave reviews!!

Soooo good! Made this along with the "baked pineapple casserole" from this site, as well as, mashed potatos and it was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. Is it wrong for me to drink the delicious marinade? JK:) I have made a few of the other top rated pork tenderloin recipes from this site and this is def the best! FYI... I didnt have sesame oil so I just used olive oil instead.

Very good sweet and spicy pork, with a bit of an asian taste with the sesame oil.  It made a nice crunchy caramelized exterior and a moist and juicy interior.  Kids loved it too.   Might also be good using honey instead of the maple syrup... Just have to figure out the right amount.

Too Sweet.  Tastes like candied pork.  Recipe calls for way too much syrup.  Way too sweet.

My whole family loved this recipe.  I recommend Baking it instead of putting it on the grill.  It keeps the pork perfectly moist and does not burn the marinate.

My DH and I thought this was just ok.  My picky son didn't like it at all.  I scaled recipe down accordingly, as I only had 4 chops to cook.  Probably won't make again.

Very good. I added some soy sauce like other members sug. I did not have maple syrup or sesame oil, I used regular syrup and olive oil. I think the results still great. I cant wait to try it with sesame oil. Since I dont buy Maple syrup offten I will stick with what I have untill I have some. I prepared my marinated in the night before and cooked a dinner time.

Thanks!!!!

Excellent and easy! It took more like 25-30 minutes to cook through. I did add some soy sauce to take away some of the sweetness. Make sure to use REAL maple syrup!

My BBQ was out of commish, so instead of grilling I seared the meat in a pan, then finished it in the oven.  I let it rest for about 20 minutes, then sliced and served it. It was very flavourful, juicy, and tender. The balance of the sweetness with the mustard and sesame oil was perfect! This was definitely a meal worth making!

Very good!  Flavorful, juicy, tender.  A nice change from the usual japanese teriyaki style.  I was short of time, so I cut the tenderloin into thick slices.  I also did not have time to marinade.  I just dunked the meat into the sauce and basted with the boiled marinade.  It worked out great.  Without a doubt, the best pork tenderloin we've ever tasted.

I WISH I COUKD GIVE THIS RECIPE 10 STARS!  ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!  I had to force myself to stop eating it!  Yes I substituted a 1.5 pound piece of boneless roast pork loin, agave syrup for maple, added extra garlic and baked it in the oven — but it was juicy, tasty and just plain delicious.  Will definitely make this recipe again!  Thank you!

It was ok. No one really loved it at our house. Probably won't make it again. I followed it directly. But I admit I used pancake syrup because that's what we had.

I made this in the crockpot, for about 6 hours on low. It was too cold to grill today. I shredded the tenderloins and then let the meat cook in the juices a little longer to soak up more flavor. Delicious!  I used dark amber, real maple syrup. Next time, I'll add more sesame oil and some cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes for heat.  I can't wait to try it on the grill, once it's warm outside. Hubby loved it. I served over rice with corn on the side. Yum!

Even using a spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon didn't help this not be cloyingly sweet. We added some garlic salt at the table, and that helped a little, but not enough that I'd make it again, given the price of real maple syrup.

So so delicious! Try adding whole strips of bacon into the marinade with the pork and crisping it off in a pan while grilling the pork, then crumble it over the medallions. I mean can you really go wrong with bacon??

I decided that this recipe looked tasty, so I took the plunge and it was so delicious!!!  I'm usually wary about cooking pork because I always seem to overcook it and it usually turns out dry. For this recipe, I followed it to a tee, with the exception of adding five cloves of minced garlic, and three Tsp. of low sodium soy sauce to cut the sweetness of the maple syrup.  I, like others substituted olive oil for sesame oil since I didn't have sesame oil on hand.  Marinated the pork all night.. then baked in a glass dish in the oven at 375 degrees for 45 mins.  It was sooo tender and juicy.  I also used the leftover marinade to baste the pork while baking.  After cooking, I used the basted marinade to make a scrumptious gravy.  I served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My 8 year old and 13 1/2 month old loved it!!!   It is a bit on the sweet side, even though I used soy sauce to try to cut the sweetness; so next time, I will use 1/2 cup of maple syrup.

Yummy!  I reduced the marinade which others have suggested and also added 2 peeled and diced apples and dried cranberries.  It made a beautiful presentation  too.

Hmmm...Some reviews say bland while the other say too sweet! I have made this numerous times (often for company) and ALWAYS get rave reviews! I have not used sesame oil (sorry to the lady who said you should not replace it with Olive oil...I did). When I buy a pork tenderloin (usually 2 in the pkg) I take them right out and put them in a freezer bag with this marinade and throw it in the freezer - perfect way to marinade it! I have both BBQ'd it and baked it (during the COLD Canadian winter our BBQ goes into hibernation) - both methods work great! And YES, I do boil the marinade (thoroughly). Cooked is cooked whether it's meat or the marinade it sat in. For the person who used it on pork chops and didn't like it...you must try the tenderloin. It's a different tasting pork - I'm sure you'll like it! Thanks for the recipe LESLEYCAN!

Fantastic marinade! I marinated the pork loin overnight and cooked it in the oven for 55 minutes at 375. Be sure to leave some marinade aside , cooked, as sauce.

Terrific. Followed the recipe to a T. Seared each side in the middle of the BBQ for a few minutes to get the grill marks, then shut the centre burner off and used only the two side burners to cook. There is plenty of marinade for basting and brushing on and for leftovers. Served with steamed broccoli and BBQ Potato Roast by Christine seen here.

Love this recipe! I made a few changes though. I add about 4 tablespoons of soy sauce to cut the sweetness of the maple. I also don't marinate (mostly because I never remember to, and then I ran out of time), so I use the marinade sauce and actually bake the pork in it. I turn the pork about half way and it's done in about 1h. It's absolutely delicious and my family loves it! Goes very well with mashed sweet potatoes and stir-fry veggies.

I was kinda concerned when I read what some people said about the "sweet meat" but it was great! In the frozen section, there are these little squares of crushed garlic or ginger. I added 1 square of crushed ginger to my marinate and let it stay over-night. I used white and cayenne pepper and extra cloves of garlic. It was the perfect offset to the sweetness. I cooked it in the over as another reader suggested, "375 for 45 mins". I did buy and use a thermometer and this was the right time for the temp I needed. I let the marinade simmer until it thickened a little and served it over the "sweet-meat". Wonderful with George Foreman'd asparagus, sautéed spinach, and sautéed new potato's w/onions. I use a lot of recipes from this site. This is my first review.

It must be marinated over night! I did it for 7 hours and the center was flavorless. 

I baked it in a convection oven at 375 degrees for 1 hr and it was a little too dry...50 mins is better. Overall, it was so so.

So good!  Used a 1 pound tenderloin for the three of us, and it was a perfect amount.  I marinated all day.  I noticed I couldn't taste the sesame oil in the finished dish at all.  Might think about increasing it a bit next time.  My daughter, who is getting pickier by the day really liked it.  I baked mine at 375 for about 45 min.  Don't overcook it.  Boiled the marinade a good long time and serve as a sauce to pour over individual plates.  Will be making this again soon!  Tenderloin was so tender.  Try it!

We were a little disappointed with this recipe. I cooked it on the outdoor grille and it was just OK for us. I reserved and boiled the marinade, using it for basting while grilling and drizzled some over the sliced meat when serving. I did add quite a bit of freshly ground black pepper to the marinade hoping to offset the sweetness but still too sweet. This one is not a 'keeper' for us.

I actually turned this into a glaze for an already-cooked leftover chunk of pork roast. I used stone ground mustard instead of dijon (because that's what I had at home) and cooked it over low heat until just bubbly. It was sweet, sticky, and perfect! It went over very well with my family!

It was just okay.  I followed exactly and grilled it on the BBQ.  It was bland and unexciting.  It wasn't disgusting, but for the price of a cup of maple syrup and a pork tenderloin, this won't be getting made again.

Love recipes like this. Super easy, few ingredients and delish! Followed recipe to a T however used the heated leftover marinade as a sauce rather than basting it while grilling. Will try adding a bit of cayenne next time for a sweet, spicy combo.

The marinade was excellent! I think I'll try baking it instead of grilling it, however because it burned too easily.

Oh this was soooo delicious!  Marinated in ziplock overnight (I only kind of measured out the ingredients, just squirted the mustard right into the bag, etc though I did measure the syrup). flipped a few times in fridge, baked 375F 45 min in a loaf pan flipped 2-3 times whille cooking, this was soooo juicy, a definite winner

Very easy recipe to fix.  I rarely do any cooking in our house, and I had absolutely no problems getting this to be great.  I did put barbecue sauce sparingly over the loin as I was eating it.

This is delicious. My husband doesn't like overly sweet dishes, but he said this was perfect. I will definitely marinade it over night next time. I reduced the extra marinade into a sauce, boiling it for 15 min to get rid of bacteria. It is imperative that this is grilled, it adds a lot of flavor. This recipe is a keeper.

This was SO good!  I loved it!  I can't tell you how many marinades I try that are good but leave absolutely no impression....then I tried this and yum!  We had it on chicken breasts and it was fabulous, I was wishing I made more...can't wait to try on pork next time.  Thank you!  This will be a summer staple for sure.  Oh, and based on other reviews, I added some soy sauce to the mix as well...

This was outstanding! It was nice to have the sauce to drizzle over the meat and rice. This one is a keeper.

This was a great meal and really quick to make!  Not often will my husband say; "This needs a once a month rotation- if not more often".  Had left overs with not much sauce and it was still just delicious!  Great, great meal!  THANKS!

Used a stone ground mustard and cooked it in the oven at 375. Glad I marinated it overnight, because the flavor is pretty subtle. I thought it was going to be better. Just ok. Probably would not make again.

4.5 stars really. It really should marinade over night and it might help to lightly score the surface.  I think an addition of some ginger would be really nice as well.

Excellent recipe.  Just made it for dinner, along with smashed garlic potatoes and green beans and it was delicious. Weather didn't permit grilling outside, so I seared it in a grill pan and finished it off in the oven and it came out perfect.  Looking forward to trying this again on the grill.

So good!  I marinated 3lbs of pork for 8 hours and  I had more than enough marinade and it tasted soooooo good.  I wouldn't have changed a thing, but add more garlic since I do this to everything.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.  This is a keeper!

My Husband LOVED this and that is saying a lot since he does not like pork. He went back for seconds and took it for lunch the next day. This was tender and flavorful. I was a little pessimistic about the ingredients meshing, but it was perfect!

We loved this. I only marinated about 8 hours so the marinade wasn't completely through the meat but it was there. Next time I'll marinate overnight. Yummo!

Didn't marinate over night but still had a great flavour. The maple adds a great taste. Also bbq this on cedar planks and added a spicer side dish whiched seem to balance the sweeter taste of this pork dish. Was really good. My husband loved it.

Delicious recipe.  I substituted olive oil for the sesame oil and honey for the maple syrup based on what I had on hand and it was great.  We used the leftover cooked tenderloin the next day to make pork fried rice and it was a hit.

Excellent recipe!  I baked the tenderloin in the oven, at 375* for 30 minutes covered, and the last 30 minutes uncovered, basting several times during the last half. I, opted not to make a gravy with the sauce but drizzled it over the sliced medalions. It would have been too sweet for our taste.

This was delicious. I made it for pork chops instead of a tenderloin. I also forgot to warm the sauce in time for basting (the chops were already on the grill), so I boiled the extra sauce, thickened it with a little flour and cornstarch to make a "gravy" to serve with it instead. No leftovers!

I thought the maple syrup flavor was way too strong for my tastes and I purchased a very expensive bottle or the real stuff just for this recipe.  I do think this would of been better on the grill but I baked it in the oven.  It was very very tender.  I marinated mine for about 18 hours.  I will try this again when I can grill it but will use less maple syrup - maybe half or sub honey for the syrup.  Just personal preference.

This recipet was excellent. It is different but very good. My husband loved it.  I didnt have time to maranate it for more than an hour so I put a little bit of maranade to the side.  I heated it and mixed it with corn starch to thicken and used it a glaze sauce to put on top of the meat.  It is now one of my husbands favorites, and even my son who doesnt eat anything loved it!

Very good!  Sweet goes so well with pork and the maple syrup did the trick.  The amount of sauce was perfect for the 2 lb. tenderloin I used.  I boiled the leftover sauce and served with the meat.  So good and easy!

Not as tasty as I thought it would be.  Marinaded it overnight, used olive oil instead of sesame and cooked it in oven.  Might try it again, but was expecting a stronger taste.

I made the marinade exactly as written, no additions/deletions. I put the tenderloin and marinade in ziplock overnight. I also made an extra marinade and refrigerated it overnight. I tried it the next morning to see if sesame, etc., was too much (per reviews), and it was PERFECT. Not too sweet or too much sesame. I could taste all flavors, it had blended nicely. I cooked the marinade from the ziplock (for dipping sauce), and glazed the tenderloin on the grill with the extra marinade. 45 minutes later--Absolutely delish!!!! So try it as written. We really loved it.

I marinated my loin for nearly 24 hours in the fridge, and took other reviewers' advice by baking it at 375'.  Due to the weight of my loin though (nearly 2lbs), it took almost 1hr 40mins to fully cook.  Meanwhile, I reduced the remaining marinade on the stove and then served it in a gravy boat with dinner.  It really added that extra punch of flavor that I was looking for to the meat!  My husband loved this meal and I will definitely make it again.  My advice: don't make the loin without also making the 'gravy' to go with it.  It was the best part!

This turned out really good!  I increased the mustard and also added soy sauce because some of the reviews said it was too sweet - which my husband does not like at all.  I put the chops in the oven and then broiled them for the final touch.  Oh, it smelled so good and turned out GREAT!  Extra sauce is a must to drizzle over and to dip.  I will make this again!

This was okay. I now have another smell that I hate. Sesame oil. GAG ME! I was really worried when that was all I smelt in the marinade (and my whole house, ugh) but it didn't come through a lot after cooked thankfully.
I cooked it in the oven for 40 mins covered, then uncovered for 20 or so more.

Anyway, it came out okay, but I think I might have overcooked it a bit. (need to get a thermometer) It just wasn't one of our favorites.

Amazing!  I've been looking for a good pork tenderloin recipe and this one is a keeper!  I didn't have dijon mustard so I used honey mustard and added an extra 1/2 cup of maple syrup.  I decided to bake the tenderloin and followed some of the review recommendations.  I baked at 375 covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for another 20 min.  I also boiled the leftover marinade and basted the tenderloin every 10 min.  The pork was so tender and juicy.

Wonderful recipe!  It was a huge hit with my boyfriend who ate the tenderloin by himself! I was unable to try it but tasted the marinade & it was delicious!  I will definitely be making this recipe again - it was very easy & took very little time to prepare.

I cooked this for a birthday dinner... It was a hit.  Shaved the pork tenderloin and presented it fondue-style for the occassion.  Served with twice-baked potato & garnish on the side.

We really liked this.  The flavor was not too strong and the meat was tender and juicy!  Next time I might try adding a little bit of soy and some red pepper flakes for some heat.

This is terrific!  Definitely use REAL maple syrup and add that soy sauce.  Very tasty.  I baked mine in the oven like others did.  Huge hit at a dinner meeting.

I didn't have time to marinate for probably more than and hour or two, but it still turned out great. I did the pork chops on the grill and tehy were a hit! I also used Sugar Free syrup and it worked great.

Made this for Mother's Day dinner. I doubled the marinade for 2- 1 lb. tenderloins, but heeding the warnings of other reviewers, used a little less than 1 1/2 cups syrup. The marinade was still pretty sweet, but not terribly so. Consensus was that it was delicious, and everyone had seconds. I served the tenderloins with Suzy's Mashed Red Potatoes and Broccoli. I plan to use the leftover pork (and the extra marinade which I boiled) for pork fried rice. Thanks for adding to my special day with this tasty recipe.

Our first outdoor gas grill meal this Spring!  The marinade was subtle, not overpowering at all.  My husband, the Griller of the House, made sure not to burn the marinade since it had all that maple syrup in it.  A good recipe.

Great recipe, my favourite way to eat pork! This is the first recipe that I tried from this website and it just made me come back more and more often to try other awesome meals! My mum has now stolen the recipe from me and uses the marinade for all pork cuts from pork chops to a whole pork roast (when she makes a pork roast she covers it with aluminium foil so that the marinade doesn't evaporate). She makes twice the marinade adds corn flour/starch at the end to thicken it and then serves it as a gravy.

I though perhaps my husband saturated this with too much marinade as he was grilling.  He loved it - I did not...so I gave it three stars.

This recipe definitely gives decent flavor.  I used it on country-style pork ribs.  However, it was very maple-sryupy.  I may put in a little BBQ sauce to balance out the sugar.  Recipe does reheat extremely well.

I wasn't that impressed with this. I think it would have been better with soy sauce in the marinade. It was mostly just sweet and cloying. I was wanting a salty flavor to balance that.

We loved this recipe! I have tried several pork tenderloin recipes over the past couple of years, and this is by far the best!  I followed the recipe exactly, and we loved the sweetness of the syrup (I even used Lite syrup) with the tang of the mustard and the distinctive flavor of the sesame oil.  We will make this over and over again!

I marinated for 48 hours.  Complex flavors, but just the tiniest bit too sweet for us.  I may add hot pepper flakes next time.

Easy, delish! Made it exactly as written, but halved the marinade for a 1# tenderloin. I only marinated ~2 hours. Pro note: If you're marinating to tenderize, a longer time is desirable. However if you are only marinating for flavor, as with a pork tenderloin, an hour is fine. Marinade only penetrates about 1/16" into meat regardless of the time marinating.

Delicious.  Made as written, grilled on medium-low heat.  Good flavor;  will marinate overnight next time so the great flavor is even more prominent.

This was so very delicious!! I put the tenderloins in to marinade on Monday night and made it on Thursday. Don't know if marinating it that long is what made it so good, but that is what I will do next time too! This was so good the hubby and I ate a whole loin by ourselves!!

This was excellent, I used it with a bone in pork roast and basted it as it was grilling. It was flavourful and tender, would definitely make it again.

My husband and I and our company really loved this recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly and it will be used often.  Used the marinade as instructed, re heating it, basting the pork and then when the pork was sliced before serving, I brushed the pork with the remaining sauce.  Perfecto!

It was really good though a little dry, I marinated it for about 7 hours but I wish I did it over night. I didn’t have enough syrup by about half ( I doubled the recipe) so I used apple cider for the half. It was really good, and really easy( I’m 12).

Ok I ended marinating the meat for 3 days. And my God how delicious! I used spicy brown and honey mustard. Made a nice gravy with the marinate using some chicken broth and cornstarch. Had it with plantain stuffing and roasted butternut squash

Very nice flavor.  Cooked sous-vide for 2.5 hours to 58C then finished on the BBQ, basting it.    Probably better cooked to 60C.

This was good. Is very similiar to a slow cooker recipe I have, so I knew my family would enjoy the flavors. I marinated it all day and the flavor was just ok. I will marinate it over night next time. I also turned the left over marinate into a gravy and served with mashed potatoes and green beens. My daughter really liked it and said I "could make this again soon" if I wanted too. It is sweet, so I think next time I will up the garlic and mustard.  I baked at 375 degrees for 45 minutes.  It was very moist. I am looking forward to trying this recipe on the grill this summer.

Tasty with overall sweet taste. I kept the marinade, reduced it and added sauted mushrooms (mixture including portobello) that I then spooned over the tenderloin.

I baked it like others did because it's January and too wet and cold to grill.  375 for 45 mins was too long as it came out at about 170 degrees instead of the 145 wished for.  But the flavor and tenderness of the meat was incredible and the marinate heated up and served as sauce over the meat was really great too.  Can't wait to put this on the grill.

Delicious! Unfortunately we didn't get to BBQ this time, so I cut the tenderloin into medallions and pan fried them, basting with the sauce.  I then thickened the sauce a bit with corn starch, glazed the pork medallions then put them on a cookie sheet in the oven at 275F just to keep them warm.  Delicious, can't wait to actually try this on the bbq so yes will be making this again!

Absolutely delicious! 
The only change to make is the recipe would marinate 2-3 times as much meat in a gallon bag with all of the air removed.
Next time I'll make less marinade for the recomened meat amount.

I baked it rather than grilled. Used convection  and for 1.5 lbs it took 25 mins. It was delicious! Boiled the marinade for 5-7 mins and spooned it over the medallions, which everyone really enjoyed. I’ll definitely make it again.

Omg, was this tasty. My mother in law is allergic to honey and she often subs maple syrup on stuff, so when I saw this recipe, I knew I had a winner. The ingredient list was short, but the flavor was so good. Will definitely make this again. I did this in the oven like so many other reviewers.

Left out garlic, as husband prefers. Delicious and tender, if a bit sweet. Boiling the marinade makes a great drizzle and enhances mashed sweet potatoes on the plate.

I made exactly as stated in recipe. I marinated the tenderloin overnight. Grilled to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F. My DH and son loved it. My son even took the leftovers home with him which is saying a lot!!!

I had to use a grill pan, so it took longer to cook.  The flavor had a lot of umami.  The combination of sweet and savory with the hit of sesame oil gave it a flavor that made me want to keep eating more and more.  I cooked some sliced baby portobello mushrooms on the side, adding a little red wine and some of the marinade.  This brought the flavor profile up a lot.

This recipe so delish!  I’m a New Englander and I’m partial to maple syrup so when I saw this recipe it was a must try!  I had to make a couple of substations: yellow mustard for Dijon and olive oil for sesame.  This is a to die for dish!

I made exactly as written. I marinated the large pork chops for a day and a half and barbecued using only half the burners. So indirect heat . Cooked for about 30 minutes turning and basting every 5 minutes. Use low heat only .Delicious!

Very good and easy.  I made it as written except I had 2 pork tenderloins in the package for about 2.5 lbs, and marinated it in a plastic bag.  There was plenty of marinade.  I baked it in the oven at 375 degrees for 45 minutes as others suggested.  Very tender and good flavor.

It was really good. I’d have given it 5 stars, but I had to salt it quite a bit to get the flavor to come out. That’s a personal preference though.

I've made this about 10 times and myself and my parents love it. I made it the way it was written but cooked it in the oven since it's been too cold here. Definitely make it as written the first time to know what it's like and how it tastes then deviate afterwards. I've used teriyaki marinade instead of soy sauce because it ran out and is still salty and it turned out great. Great for pork chops and chicken. I recommend reducing the marinade for a nice sauce. Thanks for the good eats!

I wish I was as easy to please as others seem to be. Or maybe it's just different tastes. I followed exactly as written as I personally believe you should. Just eh. I make my own recipe book of what I consider 3+ star recipes. This one is, in my opinion, worthy of a pass. It's mediocre. Why waste the time. Sorry

This was easy to make.  I marinated the meat in the marinade for about 2 hours.   Sadly, I had to lighten up on the garlic, because my husband doesn't care for it.  I used a good quality mustard and maple syrup.  Baked it in the oven at 400F until meat thermometer reached 160F (approx. 40 minutes).
I will definitely make again.

I gambled on this recipe a little bit by using it to prepare almost 6 pounds of tenderloin. Followed the recipe pretty much except for a little more fresh garlic and a little less sesame oil.

This recipe is so delicious!  I did add a splash of soy sauce to the marinade and I did bake it at 375 for 45 minutes.  Next time I will start checking the internal temperature at 30 minutes because I think it was just a bit overcooked.  The flavor of that marinade is just exceptional!  Mmm!  A keeper for sure!  I loved watching the video, too.  Thanks!

I will totally make this again ~ I doubled the ingredients b/c I had 3lbs of meat but only used 1 1/2 cups of maple syrup. I was unsure about the sesame oil b/c of reviews but I gave it a go & was totally satisfied w/ results.  Also I cooked in crock pot on med. for 2 1/2 hours was shocked that it took so little time, next time I will cook on med/low for longer.  Also I scored the meat so that it would be even more tender. Yummy!

Delicious!  Made exactly as listed but roasted in oven at 375 degrees  for 40 minutes (foil covered).  Will make again but might decrease amount of maple syrup slightly for our taste.

This recipe was just ok.  I thought the marinade while basting was a bit too thin and if I use this recipe again I will thicken what is left over with corn starch as a sauce to pour over the pork.  All the ingredients sounded great and I was excited to try this pork as instructed.  I did not have Dijon mustard instead used spicy brown mustard but, this should not have altered the marinade.  Just too thin for me.

I followed the recipe perfectly.  I thought it was favorable; but, it was rather sweet.  If I did again, I would cut way back on the maple syrup.  The sweetness took away from the flavor of the meat.

I just made this dish and my very picky husband and son loved it!!! My son said it was his new favorite. The ginger really makes this dish, you can taste the smoothness of the maple syrup as well. My neighbors I'm sure could smell that ginger goodness grilling in my backyard!! I will make again!

these were very good.. bf suggested adding an additional T of dijon mustard and i'm glad i did.. i left out the sesame oil based on the other reviews.. unfortunately we didn't get to marinate for too long.. about 2-3 hours at the most and i'm sure it would have been much better for longer.. bf made this on the george foreman but i'm looking forward to making this on the charcoal grill.. ty for the recipe

We liked it but in the future I think I will do more like 3/4 C maple syrup and perhaps 1/4C or less of soy sauce, it was a bit sweet.  Perhaps more garlic too.  I marinated overnight + and about 20 min on grill to 160 degrees.  Was not dry or overcooked.

Made it per instructions, marinated it overnight, then baked it at 400 convect for 20 minutes. It was incredible. I served it with baked sweet potato planks and drizzled the heated marinade over the pork and planks. Yummmm

First off I do plan on following the marinating time next time I make this with a roast, but I made an abbreviated version of this recipe and it was great.  I made 1/2 the marinate recipe (no sesame oil) and tossed half of  that in a fry pan with 2  one inch thick pork tenderloin chops and browned them on both sides.  I added the rest of the sauce and put them in the oven for 15 minutes.  We loved them!

Excellent recipe.  I am going to try it on chicken next time.  The only change that I made was to use less sesame oil.  That is only a taste thing with us.

Made this last night for company and it was excellent. I used 3/4 cup real maple syrup, added an extra clove of garlic and 1 Tbs of Worcestershire sauce. I did add some salt based on other reviews and a good amount of pepper. Cooked it in the oven and reduced the sauce on the stovetop. It was just the right amount for 2 one pound tenderloins. It was a perfect blend of sweet and savory. I think using the sesame oil and adding the Worcestershire sauce helped that. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Followed recipe to the letter except I cooked it Sous vide at 140F for 3 hours.  Turned our fork tender and very tasty.  One warning the gravy you make from marinade is a little sweet.  Serve that on the side and let people decide if they want it.  The dish itself has a slight sweet flavor to it anyway.  I served oven roasted vegetables with it.  Awesome!

This was so delicious!!  I did as a PP suggested and baked it in the oven.  Mainly because the tenderloin I had was about 4 lbs and it just made more sense time and effort-wise.  I doubled the marinade and had way more than enough, despite the recipe calling for a 1.5lb loin.  I marinated it for about 36 hours, put it in a pan covered in foil and cooked it at 375 until it was 145 degrees.  Then I removed the foil and cooked it for about 10 more minutes because we like our pork a bit more done.  It was still amazingly juicy and fork-tender.  I boiled the marinade very well and added a little corn starch slurry to make a gravy.  Served with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies on the side.  Even my four year old requested I make it again and that is a HUGE deal.  I will say, if you're not a fan of sweet things, avoid this because it is rather sweet.  I did add a good amount of black pepper and a few tablespoons of soy sauce as suggested by other posters and that cut it a bit.  Still very sweet, though.  Since we enjoy sweet stuff, we loved it!

If you like sweet, then this recipe might work for you. It was much too sweet for me. I added soy sauce to the leftovers, in order to make it into more of a teriyaki taste, and that helped. I will not make it again.

This is a good basic recipe, but it's too bland, with overpowering sweetness.  I marinated 3 loins with the recipe as is.  We ate the first one after 8 hours of marinating, and although it was lovely and tender, we noted the dominance of the syrup and lack of other flavours.  I added hot pepper flakes, chopped ginger and 3 Tablespoons soy sauce for the overnight marinade for the other 2 loins.  Much better.

I made the recipe as suggested except for reducing the maple syrup to 3/4 cup.  I did add a splash of soya.  I used a long slim pork tenderloin and found it was perfectly cooked after 35 min in a 375F oven. My comments:  was quite good  but a bit too sweet for me although husband found it fine.  I caramelized some onion and sliced pear to accompany it which helped cut the sweetness. I loved this addition and recommend it. I will also reduce oven temp to 350F next time.  I served it with rice and baby asparagus.

I kept mine in the refrigerator overnight and baked it at 375 for 45 minutes. Super tender and great with goat cheese butternut squash purée as a side. Definitely making it again!

I made this in my Sous Vide.  I followed the spices perfectly, but put the sauce in the sous vide bags to cook with the meat.  It was the best pork tenderloin we have had..as evidenced by no left-overs.  Even the picky kids LOVED this one.

I thought this was a fantastic dish. I marinated this overnight and threw it on the grill the next day. Had to cut into the tenderloin a bit to get it to cook through, but my wife and I really enjoyed it. The meat was very tender and so flavorful.

At 24 hrs marinated, the garlic flavor was a little strong. I did add a dash of soy sauce as a user suggested, which I'm not sure if I would do again (a bit salty). Used real maple syrup, I can probably reduce the amount of marinade next time (and save the homemade syrup). Honey Roasted Red Potatoes works as a good side.

Added soy sauce and cooked it in the oven instead of the grill and it was Ab Fab, our guests were French and they asked for the recipe.  I will definitely be cooking this dish again.

This tenderloin was amazing.   At first when making the marinade, it smelled very garlicky, however once cooked, amazing and not an overly strong garlic taste.     I may add more garlic next time ;)

We were pleased with the flavor. Longer marinade time was key to enhancing flavor. Be careful not to over cook. Watch your meat thermometer.

Saw this and gave it a try, it was delicious! Very easy to prepare. I just put everything right into a ziplock bag threw the meat in and mixed it all up. Then left it in the fridge over night. Mixed it all again in the morning before work and again just before cooking it. I baked it in the oven since my bbq is buried in the snow  utility I will be making this again when I can get it on the BBQ. I used the left over marinade to baste it as it cooked, I would also use the marinade in the pan that was starting to caramelize it added a nice brown color.  Turned out fantastic can't wait to cook it on the BBQ.

I didn't take  the time for it to sit in the marinade. But it looked so great I had to try it. I just basted it and also heated it up in a pan for side dipping. The kids loved it but it was a bit sweet.  I baked it at 375 for about 45 minutes. Next time I will do 1/2 cup soy sauce and 1/2 cup syrup. Great flavor.

We made this on Christmas Day and really enjoyed it.  I didn't have time to marinate it as long as recommended so I think it would only get better if I had been able to marinate it longer!  It took longer to cook than the recipe stated but I have a new grill so I'm still messing with getting the temperature just right - could have easily been a little too cold and that's why it took longer.  Will make again.

I've made this several times and each time everyone loves it.  Had to do in the oven due to weather but just as yummy. Enjoy

My family loved this! Made it the way it was written. Wouldn't change a thing. Made a double batch of sauce with a little extra syrup. This is going i the books as a family fave.

A tad sweet but delicious. Will definitely make it again with less maple syrup.

My husband says this is the best pork I have ever made! I did use boneless chops, because that's what was for sale. Thank you!

excellent.  i marinated it all night and next day.  halved the recipe as i was doing just one pork tenderloin.   made the marinade exactly as the recipe stated.  however,  once the pork was removed and the juices put in a pot, i did add about 1 T of soy sauce as some readers suggested.  reduced it and poured over the cooked tenderloin.  will definitely make again.

Delicious! My whole family loved it. And considering I have a very picky 5 year old...that says a lot! I added a little horseradish  to the marinade and diced onion.

This was exceptional! The best pork tenderloin I have ever had.  I ended up marinating it for longer than 12 hours and it came out so tender.  Both of my children asked if they could have thirds.  I did not deviate from the original recipe and I would not change a thing.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe. I definitely will make this again.

This was phenomenal. I served this to my fiance and our friend, both of whom can be rather selective when it comes to food--and each and every one of us was floored with the tenderness of the pork and the present-but-never-overpowering maple flavor. I marinated for a full day and didn't change anything in regards to the ingredients. We don't have a grill, though (shame!), so I popped it in the oven for an hour at 400, occasionally basting it with the leftover marinade. It was perfect.

hello, I made this the other night and oh my all I can say was t is the bomb, mind blown. My husband and I absolutely loved this. Instead of putting the leftovers  in the fridge like always with the hopes of it being eaten up in the next few  I vacuum sealed it to have in a few weeks. I am trying again but with chicken tonight I hope it is just as good. Thanks for this recipe.

My husband and I very much enjoyed this dish. It was very flavorful and delicious recipe.  The marinade complemented the pork very well, it was flavorful without being overpowering.  

I made a sauce to accompany the pork and rice, by taking the remaining marinade, adding 1 cup water, 1 tsb cornstarch, a couple of splashes of soy sauce and a pinch of cayenne pepper, which was a bit hit in my house.  Please note if you try this sauce, be sure to boil it for at least 10min, because it was exposed to the pork.

So delicious! I cooked to get to 145-155 degrees. Even better and more juicy the day after! 
After taking off the grill I placed it on  cookie sheet with a lip to catch any liquid when sitting and cutting.  After the meal I pre cut the left overs and then poured the left over juices over top. It was so tender the next day!

Very tasty!

I baked it in the oven at 350 until a meat thermometer registered 165, about 35 minutes.  The extra marinade made a delicious sauce after I reduced it for a few minutes.

Baked instead of grilled. I didn't have sesame oil so I used olive oil. Delicious! Cooked the glaze as directed added a little cornstarch to thicken it a little. Marinated pork in plastic bag abt 8 hours  prior to baking. Excellent recipe!  Will make again.

Sounds like a strange combination of ingredients, but it just works.  Don't change a thing.  The sesame oil gives a little hint of nuttiness that really makes the flavors pop.  Save some of the marinade for a sauce.  Bring to a boil and let simmer for a few minutes to boil off any of the raw pork.  Reduce heat to medium and add corn starch and water mixture to thicken it.  YUM.

This is an excellent, simple recipe.  The only changes I made were, I used a tbsp of sesame oil, (read it wrong) and I added a tablespoon of soya sauce.  This was the first time I actually barbecued myself and it was easy and ended up moist and perfect.  10 women for dinner and they all loved it.  I think it would be great with chicken or salmon as well.  Thanks.

Fast and easy!  I only marinated my medallions about an hour and put them on the grill.  Didn't baste anything cause we're on a diet & I wanted the maple to burn off. Surprising & wonderful flavor.  People will be so surprised when they take that first bite!  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I had really high hopes for this recipe, but I found it a little heavy on the garlic and really not much other flavour. There was a subtle flavour of maple I didn't find at all strong. Other than that, the tenderloin was tough and not nearly as nice as other recipes I've tried. I think I WILL give it one more try though just to see if I can prove myself wrong.

I decided to bake the pork like others have done, but it turned out a little dry by the time it was cooked enough. Baked @375 for about 45 minutes. Next time I will sear the tenderloin on the stove, and then bake it in the oven. I've done this in the past with other recipes and it really locks in the moisture. I loved the taste. Wonderful flavor!

Fantastic marinade! I marinated the pork loin overnight and cooked it in the oven for 55 minutes at 375. Be sure to leave some marinade aside , cooked, as sauce.

This was great! Very tender, juicy, and lots of flavor! Used recipe exactly as is but did marinate over night. We highly recommend using pure maple syrup. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was really tasty. Used as is. It was really sweet. I would like some tips to tone the sweetness of the sauce for the gravy.. I tried butter and vinegar and a bit more Dijon. Helped but not enough. Would make it again.

This was delicious!  I normally don't rate things with changes, but I didn't have maple syrup available and used honey instead.  I figured they were similar enough.

Boyfriend loved it, but a bit too sweet for me. I finished mine of with a couple dashes of sherry vinegar after I put it on my plate, and then it was just right. Definitely needs salt though. Leftovers made some delicious pork fried rice.

I made this twice and like more of a kick, so I also added a generous splash of Appleton's spiced rum to this recipe! It  tasted amazing!!! 
Great the original way too. :)

Absolutely LOVED this recipe and will make again. I used a 1.5 lb pork tenderloin and put it on the grill for 40 minutes....which was a little too long. I would go 30-35 tops. I poured a portion of the marinade in a pan and actually boiled it to avoid any bacteria. I used the rest to baste throughout cooking. I used the boiled marinade to pour over the grilled pork. It was amazing! I've read several reviews and noticed a lot of people used olive oil instead of sesame oil....it's not the same at all. The sesame oil is for flavor and it completes the dish. Use it! Enjoy

Went right by the recipe except I had about 4lbs of pork, there was plenty of marinate for all that I had with some left for brushing on while it was on grill. (Be sure to boil extra marinate first) My dinner group just loved it!

Trust me.  Cooking on the grill makes all the difference.  Use Indirect heat and throw some applewood on to smoke.  It's insanely good.  Be sure to use a meat thermometer so you don't overcook it.  Take it to 160 then let it rest about 10 minutes before slicing.

Excellent & flavourful dish. I cut a centre loin pork roast into cubes and marinated for about 6 hours, then grilled on skewers with green, red, orange & yellow pepper & sweet white onion pieces. A huge hit. I'll be doing this one again soon.

Much to my surprise, I didnt' care too much for this recipe. it was too sweet for me. It has a lot of promise though; I think next time I'll try it with the addition of some soy sauce in the marinade. I thought it really needed something to balance out the sugars.

Awesome.  Made it for a group of friends over the 4th on the grill and everyone raved.  Really good.  Definitely a do-over.

I'm giving this recipe the benefit of the doubt as I only marinated this for 6 hours and the flavors had quite penetrated as much as I would have liked. Despite this, the pork was very delicious and we ate it for dinner two nights in a row. Definitely make the leftover marinade into a sauce. The good maple syrup is too good to toss. Used a spicy brown mustard and low heat to cook so the marinade wouldn't burn.

AMAZING! The recipe is super simple and very easy to follow.  I marinated the pork tenderloin in a shallow dish for about 15 hrs and it was superb!  The meat was super tender and you really can taste the maple syrup in the meat.  It was a hit!  I definitely recommend!

Great everyday recipe!  I used more garlic because we love the flavor, but otherwise no changes.  I marinated a 1.5lb pork tenderloin all day and then grilled for 10 min per side.  Came out perfect and juicy.  I am going to try this marinade on chicken next time.

THis was amazing! I used real maple, more garlic, toasted sesame oil, and gray poupon dijon mustard. Very good flavor, lots of layers to it. Baked in oven like some did. So juicy!!! My dad ate most of my left overs.

Excellent recipe!  I didn't have enough maple syrup so I used half syrup and half honey, cooked in the oven at 375 -  covered for 40 min, uncovered for another 20.  I poured the remainder of the marinade over the top of the tenderloin and placed it under the broiler until thoroughly coooked.  Very moist and flavorful!

Delicious! I've made this recipe a few times and found it easiest to discard the marinade, then heat all the same ingredients (plus a little soy sauce) on the stove. We grill up the pork chops (without basting), then pour the sauce on top. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was good. I HATE sesami oil, but i thought, eh, i will try it, and suprisingly enough, the marinade tasted fine. My husband liked it, and i thought it was also good, i will make it again, its not a FAV. but i will make it again some day.

I used table syrup instead because maple syrup is so expensive, but the taste was just as good. I wish the sauce would've stuck a little more to the meat since I made it in the oven. Might make it again.

The flavor was good but I found the marinade to be quite runny and it didn't want to stay on the porkchops. The flavor was not through out every bite but may be I didn't marinade it long enough. I replace the sesame oil with olive oil. Next time I think I will try using garlic powder because it will thicken the sauce a little and the garlic flavor will mix in better to the sauce.

I thought the flavor of the pork chops turned out well.  I wish I had bought a thicker pork chop than what I did, but I did not use sesame oil (used canola oil) and used honey mustard instead of dijon mustard because that is what I had in the frig.

Very good! This did NOT dissapoint me or ANY of my family!!! I thought I had fresh garlic, but NOPE, had used it up, so substitued garlic powder. I also cooked it in a rotisserie - excellent! Will absolutely do this again WITH a bigger tenderloin!!!

sooo delish!  Yummy- could only marinate for 6 hours- but with the sauce on top it was perfect.  I even put the sauce over my veggies....I loved it.  I baked it due to it being so cold...done in 45 minutes to perfection.  Imagine its even better on the grill!

This was not as good as it sounded.  I think it was the sesame oil, even though I reduced it as suggested by other reviewers.  I tripled the garlic and mustard and added a tsp of soy sauce because it was too sweet.  I've been making Roast Pork with Maple and Mustard Glaze from this website for years.  I will go back to that recipe.  I may try adding garlic, but will definitely stay away from the sesame oil.

I used a small pork roast for this, and after marinating for 8 hours, baked it in a 350 F oven, basting every 15 minutes or so, until juices ran clear. Before serving, I also added an extra couple of tablespoons of maple syrup to the remaining marinade, which we used for dipping. Delish!

I was disappointed. The pork looked great and the marinade smelled great, but the taste did nothing for us. It was okay, but I would not make it again. PS I substituted light olive oil in place of sesame oil.

just made this for dinner tonight! so so good! really easy, left it in the marinade over night and it was so moist, and you really could taste all of the flavors! i also cooked it in the oven for about 50 minutes at 375. it turned out really well. i might the next time try a little soy sauce to give it a little smokey flavor, but the hubby likes it the way it is! great dinner!

I enjoyed this marinade. I did marinade over night and used Olive Oil  instead of seasme oil. I wish I would have injected the tenderloin with some of the marinade. I put it on the weber with some hard lump charcoal for some nice smokey flavor. This is a great marinade.

Was tender and moist. A good sauce. I baked this recipe at 375 degrees for 40 minutes covered with foil and 20 minutes uncovered. I basted it occasionally in a new batch of marinate and then added corn starch to the extra to make a gravy. Was good but nothing spectacular.

I halved the recipe and then didn't have quite enough maple syurp. This was the first time we've attempted pork tenderloin on the grill and it came out so wonderful. I took a risk and served this for company - not knowing if the maple/garlic combo would work. It totally did. This was great!

Not awful but the flavor didn't get to the majority of the meat only on the ends so this was disappoining. I probably won't make this again.

I used this recipe to serve a large group over Christmas and it was a true winner. Easy to prepare and the flavor was everything you could ask for. The only thing that could have made it better would have been if I could have used some real maple syrup from New England instead of store bought.

Excellent! Added soy sauce for a contrast to the sweet.  Great flavor.  Easy.  Next time will make 1/2 the quantity of marinade.  My husband and kids loved this.  Will definitely make again.

A friend gave us a bottle of maple syrup from her sugar bush and I wanted to make something wonderful with it! This recipe was very flavorful and easy.  We enjoyed it very much and will make again!

I thought this recipe was just alright. I didn't add all the maple syrup as per the suggestion of others and still thought the sweet overpowered everything else. I think this might be better with chicken too rather than the tenderloin, and cheaper too!

great tasting!  I have never made it with tenderloin; I use it with pork chops and I halve the recipe accordingly for four chops. Sometimes I bake them in the marinade and sometimes I grill them. Whatever I do, when my husband hears I'm making pork chops he begs that I use this recipe.

This wasnt as good as i thought i would be.  The maple syrup was good, and the dijon added some spice, but I just wasnt impressed.  It wasnt bad, it wasnt great.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a hit, no left overs. I used 2 garlic instead of 3 and marinated chicken overnight in half of the marinade. Remainder marinade heated over stove and put in cassarole dish and once chicken bbq'd I put in cassarole dish and coated with warm marinade. I also used Horsradish dijon mustard cause its what I had on hand. Tasted amazing!

This was really good - the flavors blended together nicely.  Pork was very tender and when I reduced the extra marinade - it made a great dipping sauce.

I served this exactly by the recipe except I added 1 tsp of soy sauce.  My husband, daughter and friend liked it and said they would enjoy eating it again.  I found it too sweet though and a waste of a cup of maple syrup.

I tried this marinade on boneless chops and followed other reviewers advice by adding a dash of soy sauce.  I thought the marinade was great!  Not too sweet at all.  Definitely need to try it on the tenderloin because the only problem was that the chops were not as tender as I would have liked.

This is one of the easy meals to prepare!! and the result is so delicious! I didn't have sesame oil, but it still tasted great without. This meal has just the perfect hint of sweetness. I was afraid after reading some of the reviews that it was going to be too sweet. The crispy honey chicken from PFChangs is about 3-4 times sweeter. My husband grilled this slow about 30 minutes and it came out perfect and juicy!

It was good, if you like it sweet. I wouldn't exactly say it was "too" sweet, but you have to like the sweet taste to enjoy this. I baked mine also and it had good flavor and was nice and tender.
