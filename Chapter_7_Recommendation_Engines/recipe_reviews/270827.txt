I loved my first taste of Hummingbird cake when I moved South many years ago, so this recipe caught my eye. I generally have cottage cheese, but for this recipe I purchased a single-serve cup with pineapple topping. I drizzled on a bit of maple syrup, probably a tsp, which was plenty. The taste was superb, and I loved the combination of textures. I used walnuts, as I had them on hand. Will make again!
