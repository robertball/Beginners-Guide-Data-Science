I made 5 of these for a family brunch last Sunday.  They turned out fantastic and were a definite crowd pleaser.  

I made 3 with just meats (one each of bacon, sausage, and ham), the other 2 were bacon and sausage with onion and peppers.  My personal opinion is that the "kicked up" versions with the veggies were tastier.  If you aren't a fan of veggies and want just plain meat, I'd recommend the sausage.  It tasted a bit zestier than the bacon or ham.  

I made these the night before, refrigerated them and just popped them in the oven right from the fridge.  They took 1 hour to cook and were beautiful, puffy and done all the way through.

This is a new favorite!

I had never made strata before and I made three variations for a brunch shower. I thought they were really very tasty. I made one variation with sausage and grated apple, one with diced ham and red and yellow bell peppers and a Brie and Veggie one from Southern Cooking. 

The things I learned (and I am sure that many of you seasoned Strata makers know this) are that you must add extra cook time for extra ingredients. I added about 12 oz of ham and them about two whole bell peppers and this is the only one that did not set. 

Also, yes, you do need to let these set. I didn't really plan on that extra time when I put these in the oven so there as a lull in the shower while we waited for them to be ready.

The other thing I did a little differently was cut the first layer of bread in half and lay it against the bottom of pan and the second layer I cubed so there was a little texture on the top.

Rest of the menu was the "Restaurant Style Cheesy Hash browns", lettuce salad with apples and red onions, fresh fruit, and apple strudel and lemon blueberry mini muffins.  I had many people ask for the recipes!

It was pretty good. However, After 50 minutes of baking and 10 minutes of setting it cool- it's still a little bit liquidy in the middle area. So I baked it for another 15 minutes and let it set for 10 more minutes to let it cool, the middle area became firm.

This is a versatile and reliable crowd pleaser. I've used many different combinations and Pam's right about the fresh scallions, they add a real bright note. I've found that the strata needs to sit a bit longer than the 8-10 minutes in order to really set up for easy cutting. Enjoy!

This is a great basic strata recipe.  Start with the basic bread, egg, milk mixture and add whatever you want!  I love to try new ingredients - whatever fresh veggies are in season.  I do partially cook raw vegetables, by stir frying them, to release some of the moisture before baking the strata.

This made the best breakfast casserole I ever tasted!My guests wouldn't stop raving about it! I used another recipe for another one and that one was a flop. This strata has the perfect consistency! I sauteed 2 onions and one green pepper in a little olive oil...then added a pound of turkey sausage. Thanks for a perfect recipe Callie!

I made this for a big group on a weekend get away and it was a hit!

I added asparagus, plum tomatoes (seeded) and field roast vegetarian Applewood 'sausage' and used sharp chedder cheese.  Nobody even new the 'sausage' was vegetarian!

Served with a fresh fruit salad and sweet bread and it was gobbled up by all!

I liked this recipe because it gave the basic recipe and also gave suggested variations.  I use multi-colored peppers and onions.  It turned out good.  I added 2 tsp of dried mustard and an 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper.   Thanks!

Great recipe with unlimited versatility.  Only change I have made is substituting 8 bakery croissants for the 12 slices of bread.  The butteryness of the croissants adds a whole new level to this recipe.  I have found the key to the meat/veggie combo simply being a 2lb total, regardless of how many meats of veggies you use.  I prefer Sausage, Bacon, Mushroom and Onion, so I use a 1/2 lb of each for 2lbs total.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Great recipe - I made it for friends and everyone wanted the recipe.  I used green peppers (sauted) and bacon (chopped and fried).  I also used the scallions.

Good versatile recipe. I think the cook time is way off though; mine was done in about 30mins, and there was no need for broiling. Thanks.

Wonderful strata! I used 8 oz of oven roasted turkey deli meat and 1 1/2 lb. of sauteed vegs (red, yellow, and orange peppers, and a small container of sliced mushrooms. My only suggestion is to add like 2t. of dry mustard powder to the egg mixture. I do this very often when  adding cheese to a dish. My brunch guests went crazy for it.  :-)

My very first strata and it will be a favorite recipe in the future.  I made mine vegetarian.  I used mushrooms, spinach, bell pepper,and green onions.  It was a hit at my brunch.  Even my meat eating husband loved it..I had bacon on the side for him.  It cooked fine according to the recipe and set up beautifully.

I especially like the adjustability of this recipe. I cook for large church groups, and this basic recipe works every time, no matter what ingredients I choose to add. I like to cut off the bread crusts first when I have the time. I gives it a slightly smoother texture and neater apprearance when done. Sometimes I add a little ground nutmeg, just because I like it in egg recipes.

I doubled this recipe recently for a wedding brunch I catered. I should have doubled that amount because it was a huge success! I used a pound of sausage and a pound of bacon and the scallions as the only veggies. It does take a while to set up completely in the middle but this is much better than other strata recipes I have used that have never set up correctly. I will definitely make this again and can't wait to try some different variations!

This was a big hit at brunch. Even people who I would consider "picky" ate seconds and took some home.  Because I wasn't sure what would be considered too adventurous, I simply used (turkey) Canadian bacon and sharp cheddar cheese with the eggs and bread. No onions. I was skeptical of using an entire quart of half-and-half, but was amazed at how much the bread absorbed so if you have reservations, I am here to say that it actually does work.  The cook time took considerably longer than 50 minutes, but I also refrigerated overnight and I don't think it was quite up to room temperature so keep that in mind. I will definitely make this again!

Very good recipe.  I used sausage, mushrooms, onions and green and red peppers.  I cooked it covered for an hour, and uncovered for another thirty minutes.  Came out moist and fluffy. Will make again for sure.

I used sausage, mushrooms, 8 eggs, a crusty Italian bread cut into cubes and mixed everything together rather than layered.  Delicious.

Excellent! This was the first time I've ever made a strata, and I'll definitely be making it again. I cut the recipe in half, used an 8x8 dish, and made with sauteed peppers and onions and steamed broccoli. Very good! I covered it in foil and cooked it in my toaster over on 350 for 50 minutes, then uncovered it and broiled for another 5 minutes- so good!!!

Made this for the first time for Christmas brunch; it was easy & a hit! It came out well with hunks of an unsliced loaf of Italian bread, I used mostly the inside leaving out the crust, so it was heartier than had I used a typical white bread. Filling was a saute of shallots and frozen spinach, with Gruyere cheese (found this idea on the cookbook critic website).  I made two batches, the one in a deeper round dish took longer to cook, but came out moister, with less bread and more custard. The oblong pan was dryer but just as tasty.  I served 2 types of sausages (sweet breakfast and savory) on the side so guests had a no-meat option.  A fabulous brunch choice, everyone wanted the recipe, we had the leftovers for breakfast today!

This turned out well except that the edges got a little chewy.  I think in the future, I may cut off the crusts of the bread to make the texture a little more consistent throughout. Overall, it was a hit at our company breakfast, though!

I found this on Allrecipes years ago and have made it ever since with different variations.  Everytime I make it someone comments that it is even better than before and I have sent links to this recipe dozens of times.  This time I sauted mushrooms, fresh spinach, cherry tomatoes cut in half and scallions along with bacon and sharp cheddar. I used fresh Italian bread that I sliced myself and I always use my lasagna pan to assure that everything fits.  I weigh it down overnight - cook it first thing in the morning.   I usually serve with a homemade quick bread such as almond, strawberry-lemon, or banana and fresh fruit especially berries.  I don't think there is a way to mess this up.

I had never made a strata, but it was FANTASTIC!! Although it is a bit heavy, I'm sure changes can be made for the more calorie conscientious person. p.s. it's great cold too!

Excellent base recipe. I can imagine lots of possibilities with this simple-to-follow plan.   For a family brunch, I used 12 oz. of Trader Joe's Garlic and Herb Chicken Sausage (sliced and lightly browned) for the meat; a mix of cooked broccoli, about a pound of lightly cooked spinach, and lightly browned onions for the vegetables; and 6 oz. of crumbled feta and 6 oz. of shredded havarti cheese. I omitted the scallions. I used as much potato bread was needed for the two layers.   The whole thing was as easy as could be, pleased my guests, and looked beautiful.

Well, I found out the hard way that my "9x13" pan is actually a little short - I am now cleaning my oven because of the boiled over milk and egg mixture.  I did like the versatility of this dish and the fact that it did not need to refrigerate overnight.  I used a combination of bulk breakfast sausage, onions, peppers, and zucchini.  The flavor was good, but I think dry mustard would add a nice little zing to it.  I actually tried this recipe as a way to use up some sour milk, and that substitution was successful.

I made this for a family of wheat intolerant and those that aren't wheat sensative by using a store bought loaf of wheat free bread adding broccoli, turkey sausage and goat cheese. We all were really impressed with the ease of putting it together and the variations offered. Thank you, I will definately make this again. Irene

This was made for a post-Christmas brunch today, and scored a home run. My grand-nephew told me three times that he loved it. The adults weren't shy with praise either. I used day-old french bread with most of the crust removed. yellow and red peppers, ham, scallions and the mushrooms, but a little less ham than called for. I'm glad I checked before adding mustard because of allergies. I might have added a tablespoon of Dijon (although not called for), but would have had to eat the whole thing myself. I would have died happy, though.

So good and easy. I split the recipe in half and baked it in a 9x9 pyrex. I used turkey sausage and leftover veggies (onions, peppers, broccoli) I had floating around in the fridge. It was so good! I've never made strata before and was happy to see this one was meant to be made with variations.

So easy and everyone loved this- made for a group of 16 people. Made one with bacon, mushrooms and scallions and the other wiht just the veggies.  I did not broil at the end and it was still great. I made them in 2 disposable tins which I buttered so that they wouldnt stick. EASY CLEANUP!

This is a nice, easy,  basic strata recipe. I'd like to experiment with different cheeses and ingredients. Mine required an additional 10 minutes of baking (as someone else noted.) If you prepare it the night before as I did, remember to allow plenty of time in the morning to bring to room temperature before baking!

I made this for Christmas brunch the night before using mushrooms, asparagus and red onions with reduced fat four-cheese Italiano cheese. It was delicious! I had 8 people for brunch and we barely ate half of the full recipe. Next time I would cut the recipe in half. I look forward to trying it again with different ingredients.

This was easy and pleasing for Christmas morning.  I made a vegetarian/non milk product version to suit my family's dietary restrictions.  I used veggie sausage, rice cheese and soy half and half.  Everyone loved it!

I made this, my first strata, for Christmas brunch and it was a huge hit.  Love how versatile it is.  I didn't have dry mustard so added some dijon mustard and also the cayenne pepper as some else suggested.  I used pepperjack cheese along with the sharp cheddar.  It was a bit salty to me so would cut it in half.

This recipe was outstanding. I had never eaten strata before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was golden, fluffy, and delicious. We couldn't even tell it used to be white bread! I didn't have any mushrooms, so I just added leftover ham steak and scallions. It tasted perfect--I don't think I'll use mushrooms next time either.

This worked out great.  I made sausage/gr. onion and ham/spinach.  I cut back on salt, added a bit of dry mustard & cayenne and did not put the cans on top after assembly.  I also cooked them 20 minutes longer than called for.  I would definately make this again - you can count on it to turn out perfectly.

Great recipe!!  I made this today for a pre-Easter egg hunt party, and it was a huge hit.  I used 12 oz of pre-cooked chicken sausage, chopped finely. I also used 3 sweet peppers, which I chopped and then microwaved for 90 seconds to soften a bit.  I used whole wheat bread, since I don't ever buy white bread.  It came together really easily, and cooked in about 70 minutes.  I will make this again!

I adore this strata.  I have made this for Christmas breakfast the past 5+ years.  I always do ham as the meat, but have done onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, broccoli (and a combination therein) for the vegetables.  I have started using whole milk instead of half and half to make it healthier, but I have made it both ways over the years.  It is always super fluffy and delicious...the family looks forward to it every year!  I always prep it on Christmas Eve and refrigerate overnight.

Delicious! I used some roasted garlic French-style bread from Costco that was absolutely dynamite. It gave a bit of a bite, both in flavor and texture. Plain white bread would just be mush, I'd think. We did cooked sweet sausage and a grated and pressed zucchini, plus some mustard powder and chopped garlic scapes in the egg mix. The french bread necessitated more egg on top, and it took about 1 hour at 350, after having come to room temp for about 10 mins. The middle was a bit underdone, but the broiler took care of that in a minute or two.

I loved the basics of this recipe I scaled it down a bit according to what I had on had. I didn't have any meat so I made it with just onion and mushrooms. I had a hunk of extra sharp cheddar that came out to two cups. I cooked the onion and mushrooms and let them cool before assembly. I like that this recipe let me know it was ok not to wait overnight to bake. I'm not sure how much soaking over night would change things. I was looking to make this now and it turned out wonderful. I've never had this before but I can't wait to try it again with different stuff.

I made this for an appreciation breakfast and it was the first dish to be eaten!  I didn't even get to sample it myself so I think it must have been a hit with the crowd!

I don't know what I did wrong, but I certainly wasn't a fan of this dish.  Half of the pan went straight to the trash.

This recipe was a hit! I made a double batch one with ham only and one with bacon and mushroom. I will definitely make this again, this time a little more creatively (broccoli, spinach, tomato.....)

I used this recipe for an Easter breakfast.  I prepared it the evening before and then baked it that morning.  It was wonderful.  I used ham, bacon, spinach, and mushrooms.  It was perfect.

Incredibly delicious! *Followed the base recipe, without making crazy changes. 
I used thick slices of day old bakery Italian bread, as well as Jalapeño Jack cheese, with some Chipotle seasoning. Followed overall measurements and used other ingredients as written. Bread soaked up the egg mixture just right. (Teenagers picked it up and ate it like a sandwich - whatever works, right?) 
This seems to be be a very versatile recipe, but it was so good that I'm not sure I'd want to make any changes!! Five stars for a new favorite recipe. Only had 2 small squares leftover after feeding 3 teenagers, my husband and myself. Definitely making this again soon, but will bake 2 trays to have leftovers... Yum!!

I have been making a similar strata for years. I love it for Christmas and Easter mornings, while we’re opening gifts and looking for eggs, breakfast is cooking. I serve it with a fruit salad and my family tops it with either hollandaise sauce or syrup. Delicious!

This is really good. I reduced it by a third and baked it in a 9 X 9 in pan. I used sautéed mushrooms, onions, red & green bell pepper, bacon & extra sharp cheddar cheese. I added 1/2 tsp. Dry mustard & a couple shakes cayenne pepper. I added no salt, the cheese & bacon had plenty.  I used mostly milk with about 1/4th half and half and also not as much as suggested to make it a bit more custard like and less runny. I still had to bake it about 50 minutes to get it cooked. Yum! Thank you!

Defininately make again. Outstares my previous recipe I've made every year for the last twenty. 
Followed suggestion of first layer being full bread slices and torn up cubes for other layers.  Superb.

Very versatile recipe that can be tailored to your personal taste.  I add a bit of cinnamon, and coat the pan with Honey Butter instead of cooking spray for a bit of sweetness.  I have also used crab meat as well and really liked the results.

I used this as a base and modified.  Used 1lb of sausage, broccoli, asparagus and bell pepper. Lined the bottom of the pan with bread and then added 2 1/2 slices chopped up in the pan for filler.

 Cooked at 325 for 50 minutes then 400 for 10 minutes and it turned out perfect.

I like to use Hawaiian bread (brioche would be good too).  I add vanilla, cinnamon, a little nutmeg & some maple syrup to the egg mixture.   For cheese, havarti, and turkey sausage for meat.  Popular in my family

This turned out great! First time I used hame and cheese, second time cooked bacon and cheese. I did substitute evaporated milk for the half and half and it was wonderful.

I made this for brunch on Saturday with mushrooms, chopped ham and broccoli. It hadn't fully come to room temp in 45 min's so the baking time was longer - a little more than an hour. It could have used a tad bit more flavor (a little more salt or sharper cheese perhaps) but overall it was a big hit and I will definitely make it again, with other variations.
