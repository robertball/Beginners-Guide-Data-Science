These cookies have been in my family for years, but the recipe is varied slightly.
We use 1 1/4 cup of graham cracker crumbs instead of the nilla wafers and we just melt the butter in the baking dish on the stove then sprinkle the crumbs on top once it's melted (and I use the smaller baking pan one size smaller than the 9x13). Also, I use 1 1/4 cup coconut since the nuts and chocolate chips make it so rich.  If I have milk chocolate chips laying around, I'll do half milk chocolate and half semisweet.
Also - don't skimp on the condensed milk - I tried making them a couple times with "generic" condensed milk and they were terrible.  Pay the extra dollar for Eagle/Borden/Carnation.
Perfect for get-togethers - everyone asks what's in them after their eyes roll in a flutter.

These are one of my favorite all time cookies!  I always make them with either 1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs or 1 1/4 cups saltine crackers.  Both versions are great.  I also am very generous with the coconut as I love coconut!

My husband says these are the "bomb" and my daughter and I both think they taste similar to Almond Joys.

Twists to the recipe:
1.  Spray pan with non-stick coating - I also used a 9x13 casserole dish

2.  I used about 16 graham crackers and crumbled them in my food processor (turned them into dust).  I supposed you could also use chocolate graham crackers.

3.  I used a 16 oz bag of whole pecans, put them into a plastic bag and smashed them into crumbles using a meat mallet.

Easy! Delicious! Economical!  Rave reviews!  Thanks for this great, versatile recipe.  Haven't had this before, have now made it 3 times in a fortnight, my co-workers love it.  Made it as per recipe the first time (minus pecans, nut allergy) - fantastic!  The second time I subbed dark chocolate for the semisweet, and chopped glace cherries and Craisins for pecans, and the third time I subbed white choc for the semisweet, and glace cherries instead of pecans, and added an extra half a tin of milk.  I wanted a recipe that was easy to make from items I'd have on hand, and this is it.  Thank you very much for sharing!

Excellent. I added more coconut; I always add extra coconut to recipes that call for it. They were everything they should be: sweet,chewy, crunchy, chocolate-y.

These were good and even better when you know how easy they are to make.  Hubby loved them.  I also used graham cracker crumbs and a little more coconut, althought that bring it very close to the hello dollies 1 recipe here.  I will make again.

while i don't have a rating for these cookies as they have been in my family for years.  These cookies are best when graham cracker crumbs and butterscotch and chocolate chips are  used. Whatever you do don't skimp on the milk or coconut. the more chips the better

Its hard not to love these cookie bars, especially if you are a big fan of coconut.  They were so easy to make.  I may embellish next time with butterscotch or peanutbutter chips, in addition to the chocolate chips..

I made these for a cousin for Christmas as it was like something his mother used to make and no one could find the recipe.  He loved them as did everyone else.  They are a little bit of heaven.  Although they are rich so cut in small pieces.

Our family loves Dollies! It's easy to make. It's fun, so include the kids. I fix the crust and my daughter likes to add the chocolate chips and sprinkle out the coconut. They are sooo good!

A family classic--just needed the Internet to remind me of the recipe.  I don't make any changes, as I like it just like this.

My coworkers usually aren't into sweets, but when I put these out, they were gone before I could even have one!

I made these bars exactly as explained: they are delicious, absolutely easy and just the thing for someone with a sweet tooth. Only reason I gave 4 stars is the presentation: they were pretty when finished, all decked with candied cherries, but when you cut them it's a bit of a mess.

I have made these for special occasions periodically and every time they are a hit. People have asked if they can hide some away to take home with them. I love that they are a perfect dessert without all the fuss.

I found I needed more wafers to make the crust -- 2 cups didn't even cover the bottom of my pan. These are divine, but very gooey, even after they've cooled! Do yourself a favor and use a fork and bowl.

I like these because they use the vanilla wafer instead of the typical graham crackers. Gives it a more sophisticated taste. I poured the SCM over the cookie layer, because I wasn't paying attention to the recipe. I also substituted rice krispies for the coconut because one of my kids can't stand coconut. Definitely use the full 2 cups of crumbs. I ran out and only had about 1 1/2 cups. 25 minutes was just right. 30 would have burned them. Despite the greasing of the pan, these are a nightmare to get out of the pan. The colder they are the easier.
