This turned out beautifully!  I used a Fuji apple because that's what I always have around the house and regular raisins and plain Mott's applesauce (again, what I had.)  This turned out moist and delicious, plus it made my house smell heavenly.  It would be good with some nuts in it, too and I might try that next time.  My only issue was that I should have doubled it because we ate most of it while watching Sunday night football!  
This recipe rocks - I almost always have the ingredients in the house and it's super simple.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was easy to make and cake out super moist. I love the chunks of Apple and golden raisins, this made for a tasty fall treat for my family. I would make these again!

Pretty much a spice cake with apples.  can't go wrong with that.  It is super moist, almost too moist.  Don't worry about it drying out, that is for sure.

Great recipe! Didnt have access to applesauce so made some from scratch, using one apple, water and sugar. Also used half brown sugar, half white granulated sugar and added a tbsp of honey. Perfection! A definite keeper!

I love this recipe it was moist and so delicious with my morning coffee, I used a bundt pan and mixed in a separate bowl a half a cup of brown sugar and a third cup of melted butter and two tablespoons of maple syrup and poured that on the bottom of the greased bundt pan and sprinkled chopped walnuts over it then poured the batter over it. Then when done it was flipped upside down onto a plate.

I made this with two changes - I grated the apples and used nutmeg instead of cloves. I would likely cut up the apples next time. I thought that it was more like a tea bread than a square. I was looking for something to serve with ice cream.

I used homemade applesauce, and Washington apples. Followed the instructions exactly. Everyone loves these! Will definitely be making again.
