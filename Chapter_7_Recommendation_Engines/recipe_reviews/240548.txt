8.12.16 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/240548/applesauce-bran-muffins/ ... Just made these.  They're good.  I added 2T oil.  They stuck to the wrappers, but maybe tomorrow they'll be easier.  Funny that allbran has sugar & fiber one doesn't.  I used allbran & these were sweet enough, could lessen it even.  These aren't obvious cereal-based & aren't so healthy-tasting that they'll go uneaten (I hope)!  Oh, I didn't have sr flour - subbed w 1 1/2t powder & 1/2t salt.  These didn't knock my socks off, but I am glad I made 'em.  Wrappers came off easier later in the day.  'Might need fruit to be a five star  muff.  :)  Oh, these have dried crans.  Maybe more, fresh, or a different fruit would do the trick.

I made some changes out of  nesecity.  I did not have  applesauce, used Apple juice.  Added some goji berries and flax seed and some oatmeal.  It was a good recipe to start with.

I made no deviations of this recipe.  The muffins came out moist and not too sweet.  I might add a little more sugar next time.  Not crazy about cranberries so will use something different like raisins or no fruit at all in the future.  A good recipe!
