This recipe is great!  Used vanilla extract instead of water and mixed half the amount of white sugar with brown sugar.  These are addictive - so watch out because they'll be gone before you know it!

Wow! As others suggested, I used half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white. I also added in a dash of vanilla extract. These were amazing. I can see why people give them away as gifts. I would have sent them to work with my husband, but there weren't any left. Watch out, they are seriously addicting!!

if you follow the recipe you will love this for the first week then hate it after that. this is a great holiday recipe, so good in fact that you will eat too much until you are sick of them for awhile. i made about 2 pounds(alot) and gave some to employees(with a xmas bonus of course)they loved them. customers also luved them and they didnt get a bonus, my family loved them so they must be good

These are DELICIOUS! I have made them following the recipe exactly and made them with the change others recommended, which is using half white sugar and half brown sugar. I think the pecans turn out better with the sugar mixture: half white, half brown. I also use vanilla extract in place of the water. For easy clean up, I place aluminum foil on the cookie sheet, spray it with PAM and after baking throw it away. Easy and delicious.....my kind of recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and they are wonderful!  I lined my cookie sheet with aluminum foil and sprayed it with cooking oil because I didn't want the mess and it worked beautifully.  I will make these again and again.  Thank you for this delicious treat!

Awesome.  I'm giving these out as gifts this holiday.  I made a few changes that worked well for me-- instead of the egg white I used a serving of egg substitute.  I also cooked them in a 400 deg. oven for about 25 minutes.  A parchment covered baking sheet makes cleanup easier!

Excellent recipe. I was looking for a recipe for nuts to put in a salad. This was perfect! I used them in a gorgonzola and pear salad and they worked beautifully! Thanks!

Baked in cake pan sprayed with cooking spray which made this easier to stir and was fairly easy to clean up. Also used pecan pieces since I had them and they worked fine. May try with some vanilla and using brown sugar for half the sugar.  Very tasty and easy to make!

A great, versitile recipe!! I've tried it the orginal version and with the half brown/half white sugars and vanilla instead of water...it's fabulous both ways. I've given it as a gift and it was loved so much! My only recommendation is toasting the nuts a little bit BEFORE toasting them with all the coating...it gives that nice, roasted nutty flavor that just gives it that extra kick. Thanks for the great recipe Debbie!

Delicious and simple to make. I upped the amount of cinnamon a great deal and also added a little bit of ground cayenne to make them sweet and spicy. These were the first to go during a recent party.

Obscenely delicious.  After reading the other reviews I used 1 tablespoon water/1 tablespoon vanilla, and I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I'm going to make several more batches of these so I can wrap them up to have on hand for Christmas gifts.  So easy and so good--perfect combination!

My family loved this recipe & and I have made it for gifts!!!  I have tried other varieties; however we like the original.  Also, I found it easier to coat the pecans with the sugar mixture by putting it in a Tupperware container – put the lid on a shake –after a minute or two all the pecans are perfectly coated.  Super simple.

I looked at this recipe as well as the one for sugar coated pecans and sort of followed the ingredients for both, since they are very similar. used 2 egg whites, and used 3/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar. I lined the pan with foil and sprayed that for easier clean up. I also used half almonds and half pecans. These are awesome and so perfect. They are just like the ones at the fairs. I will definitly be using this many times over, especially for the holidays when I make gift baskets. Great great recipe

Yummity yum yum! I used half white sugar, half brown, and half water, half vanilla extract. And I'm very glad I put foil down on my baking sheet, because after generously greasing it, I had some sticking issues. These are so tasty!

I made the recipe exactly as noted and these are very easy to make and as others have noted, highly addictive!  I used them as a layer for a pumpkin trifle, combining them with pumpkin bars and whipped cream cheese frosting from this website.  It was a 5 star dessert!

Delicious and so easy!  I increased the sugar to 1 cup and the cinnamon to 1 tbl as others have mentioned.  I also added 1/2 tbl of vanilla extract to the water before adding the egg white.  To make the egg white froth faster, put the whisk and bowl in the refrigerator or freezer for a few minutes.  I gave these away as Christmas gifts - everyone loved them!  I will definitely be making them again!

Be very careful making these and taking them anywhere, they will go very fast and you will always be asked to bring them again.  I have made these for every holiday for the last four years, I have gotten many complements and they are so easy to make, dont change a thing

These are yummy!  I used 1/2 cup white & 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also added just over 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper for a little kick!  I did 1 Tbsp. vanilla and 1 Tbsp. water.  Turned out great.

used vanilla extract instead of water and the 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar combo as recommended in previous reviews. lined a pan with aluminum foil and baked for 400 F for 25 minutes.  It really speeds up the process and makes this easy recipe even simpler. the light coating is delicious and crunchy, not too hard or brittle.

Love this recipe!  I doubled the batch, but added in an extra egg white.  I also used half brown sugar, half white sugar and a splash of vanilla.  Tastes better than those nut vendors that are all over the malls!

Double the batch!!  Try replacing half the white sugar with brown sugar.  Gave this a shot with almonds, as well, and turned out equally as good.

Good but not the greatest I've tasted.  Don't like the way they coat .. Think it needs a bit more flavor - something seems to be missing.

Have made this excellent recipe using many variations.  Think I have finally found the winner using vanilla for half the water, increasing salt to 1 tsp. and adding 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper.  Used evaporated cane juice organic sugar and it seem to add something but think regular sugar is still ok if you don't have that.  Be careful not to burn.  I think they only need about 50 minutes total cooking time.  These are the best pecans you will ever taste.

Like other reviewers suggested, I replaced part of the water with pure vanilla extract and used half white sugar and half sucanat (evaporated cane juice).  Fantastic.  Could be even better with more cinnamon!  Warning:  these are addictive!

I make about 20 lbs of these every holiday season now for 3 years, and give them as client gifts in small tins or bags, they have become so popular now that I have people request them!  They are truly delicious!  Thanks Debbie, for such a great recipe!

Oh, my goodness!  These are delicious and dangerous.  I couldn't stop eating them.  A friend who does not like nuts tried them and keeps asking me when I will bring more. Another told me I should give them as gifts, they were so good.  I, too, tried the 1/2 water and 1/2 vanilla.  Have thought about adding the cayene pepper for naughty and nice nuts, but the original is so good I am not ready to change anything.

YUM! This turned out great! A month ago, I had never tried a pecan in my entire life, until we went to a holiday bizarre and a woman gave me a sample of a candied pecan. It was so good, that I wanted to find a similar recipe to make myself. This is it. Fantastic. I took other reviewers' advice and used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and substituted vanilla extract in place of the water. Thanks for a great recipe!

I adapted this recipe to make a slightly different presentation:  I double everything except the nuts and bake it on a tray (covered in greased foil for easy cleanup).  This way you end up with an almost meringue-like square full of nuts.  I also sub vanilla for water, add a dash of orange extract (for holiday flavour) and do half white half brown sugar.   I realise this sounds like I changed the recipe completely, but really they're just small differences.  The original mix has perfect proportions and cooks perfectly.

Fantastic..I did vary a bit-I doubled the recipe. instead of regular salt-try using lowery's seasoned salt..a bit less cinnamon..half white sugar-half brown sugar-and used real vanilla..I baked at 300degrees for almost an hour..and I turned them every 10 min utes..perfectly crunchy-yet so flavorful-the seasoned salt gives that extra flovor..My husband is crasy for these!!

I gave this recipe four stars because I had to modify it to my taste. I used 1 tablespoon of vanilla instead of the water. Also I used half a cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar to replace the one cup of sugar. I think the original recipe is a great place to start and then you can modify it to your preference.

These were so good and easy to make!  I did the half brown sugar and half regular sugar.  I will have to stock up on little gift baggies so that I can give these out family & friends the next time I make a batch.

I make this often, to give as gifts... it's great because it lasts a long time and mails well.  I usually add a tsp of vanilla, and just a pinch of ground cloves and allspice.  I also decrease the sugar to 3/4 cup.

Love these; everyone gobbled them down!  Light, toasty and perfectly sweet.   I used 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, and used 1 tsp less water so I could use 1 tsp vanilla instead.

OMG! These are awesome. I had 3lbs of pecans left over from Christmas baking (tripled the recipe) and followed the suggestions of using 1/2cup ea. white and brown sugar and vanilla instead of water.  I used disposal pans for easy clean up. My husband, son and visiting sister loved them. Ever time they walked past the container they would grab a handful. They were all bummed when the last one was eaten.

Fantastic, sweet recipe! My co-workers loved them. One asked me to move the bag away from him so he would quit eating them. I will make again. I used half brown and half white sugar as suggested by others, and added a little vanilla. Great on a salad!

Yum. Hubby had been whining for some sweet pecans for a while, so I made these. He couldn't keep his mitts off of them! I had to smack him to keep him out of the second batch I made for holiday dinners. I used a little vanilla and half brown and half white sugar. I liked the way it turned out. I think next time I will go all white sugar though- the brown, while good, gave it a "cookie" taste.

These were delicious to munch on by themselves or to put in a salad!  I added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and cloves for a little bit more flavor.  Delicious and very easy to prepare.

These smell so good and are extremely addicting... until you eat so many that you don't want to touch them anymore for a week or two. :( I used pecans, almonds, and walnuts.

These should come with a warning....Don't get started eating them. You can't stop!! They are so good! I followed the recipe exactly. I highly recommend these be on your table for Christmas. I made little bags out of cellophane and gave some away as a gift. Thanks for such a great recipe.

These are excellent.  I made this with whole almonds.  My changes: I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar; only 1 T water; added a splash of vanilla; and the zest from 1/2 an orange.  Very yummy.  Try this, you won't be disappointed.

These are the best coated pecans I've ever had! light, crunchy and absolutely yummy!  Couple tips I've got: 1. make sure you stir the egg/water till very foaming before you soak in the pecans, this will make the coating super crunchy and 'fluffy'; 2. don't pour any of your residual syrup in - that creates some sugar chunks; 3. I may try throwing in handful toasted sesame for the coating next time.

These are awesome!  I made the recommended changes (vanilla instead of water, 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar.  I can't imagine how this could be improved. I think my family has gained 10lbs in the last week eating them all.

Ditto on using half white/dk brown sugar..spread some soft butter on foil inside a cookie sheet. Easy cleanup, also used 2 tbsps vanilla instead of the water...When done, I laid out on parchment paper and put some extra fine salt before they cooled. came out superb!

Great recipe for candied pecans. I used 12oz instead of 16oz of pecans so the coating was thicker. Also used 1/2c white and 1/2c brown sugar, a tsp of vanilla, and a dash of nutmeg. Cooked for 45 minutes and was perfect!

So easy ....I used half brown sugar and half white...then I replaced 1 tablespoon of the water with 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. I put the pecans in a gallon ziploc mixed the other ingredients in a bowl and poured on the pecans and mixed well...lined a baking sheet with foil sprayed with pam and baked at 300 stirred every 5 mins for 20 mins. They came out perfect and if I can keep my husband out of them ( he already had 2 handfuls) they will be great as snacks before our Thanksgiving dinner.

These were really good! They weren't the prettiest things in the world, but the taste made up for it. I switched 1/2 t. of the water for vanilla, it made the taste a little fuller.

Made recipe exactly  stated.  Today I am making with the tweeks I've read in the reviews.  There is no way they can be any more addicting than the original recipe.  We shall see!  This recipe is now included in my permanent recipe file.

These are GREAT!  My whole family loves them and so does anyone else I have given them to.  I also made a few changes by using half a cup of  white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar and by using one 1 TBSP water and 1 TBSP vanilla extract.  They don't last long around here so I always make a double batch.

I absolutely love this recipe. I've made it three times now! I cut the sugar to a rounded 1/2 cup and up the cinnamon to a rounded teaspoon. that's all the changes Ive made. This is addicting. Even folks who aren't crazy for pecans love these! Its a keeper!

I love this recipe. It is my new thing to bring to parties. Instead of adding the salt to the egg mixture, I sprinkle coarse sea salt over the nuts after I place them on the baking sheet. I also use 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Good stuff!

These turned out really well! I was very surprised; I tried another recipe similar to this one once and was highly displeased with the results. I doubled the recipe (and doubled the cookie sheets) & used peanuts & cashews, because that's what I had. I used the already-salted-in-a-can kind & omitted the salt from the recipe. I used PAM spray to lubricate my pan & wished I had used butter--after a few times turning the nuts, the PAM spray was no longer functioning, and I think the butter would've been better. Still, if you're feeling fat-conscious, the PAM spray did work--I just had to peel the last 1/4 cup or so of nuts off the foil very carefully! Thanks for the recipe, it's going to make great gifts this year! (P.S. 1 lb peanuts = 3cups, 1 lb cashews = 4 cups)

WOW! These are so delicious, just like the expensive ones you can buy and a great gift to give. I also used half & half brown/white sugar as others had recommended. I also lightly sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar after they had cooled for 15mins. Like they needed more sugar (!!), but I really think it improved on perfection!

Loved these!!! I also followed other reviews and used 1 tbs vanilla instead of water.  Next time i will try using 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I will definitely be making these again! It was so easy to do!! UPDATE:  I made this again using 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and used almonds instead of pecans.  I couldn't really tell the difference with the brown sugar (it's still delicious!) The almonds were yummy too.  Either way, I love this recipe and will definitely be making it again!

HOLY MOLY these are awesome.  The only a few changes that I tried after reading the reviews - use 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown. Used 1 tbs water and 1 tbs vanilla extract. Used cooking spray on pan rather than butter.  Great to eat by themselves or on a salad. I'm putting them on Twice baked sweet potatos too!

These are a HUGE hit in my family - my husband adores candied pecans and he favors this over my usual way of browning the sugar in a pan - this recipe is way easier, much lower in fat, and tastes amazing - it is addictive. I add a dash of vanilla after the eggs are foamy, before adding the sugar mixture.

OMG! I made these to give away in gift boxes with some cookies...I think I ate half of them. Warning! Do not taste test when they are warm unless you plan on making another batch! Definitely cook on aluminum foil to help with cleanup.

I just made these and from reading the reviews and modifications below, I also subbed vanilla for the water and half of the sugar with brown sugar.  I also doubled the recipe using 1 lb pecan halves and 1 lb pecan pieces.  They came out great!  Next year, I'll have to make these earlier to give out to friends.  Thanks!

WOW .... These are fabulous! I did make them with vanilla instead of water and 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. These are a great way to use up extra pecans from holiday baking. I have 1 warning ... do not make these if you are not prepared to eat every single one, they are sooooooo addictive! Thank you for the great recipe.

Excellent, love pecans and everyone loved these.  I had some leftover pecans plus the one pound so I used 2 egg whites, used no water, 1 Tablespoon vanilla, 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.  But I used the basic recipe.  I used this one after looking at all the different ones here.

You can’t just eat one of these things! I followed recommendations of others and did 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and substituted vanilla for water. These will be a hit for any party or gathering.

Really good and they smell so good.  But, I feel they need more taste.  Maybe more cinnamon, or maybe if I used half brown sugar that will help.  Did use vanilla instead of water.  Even though I think they need more spice I can't stop eating them.

Not quite as crunchy as the ones you get at the fair, but still pretty  good.I used half water and half vanilla flavoring and poured in the whole 1.5lb bag of pecans since it seemed like too much mixture for just a lb. Next time I'll try it with just a lb and see if that thickens up the coating any.

My family absolutely Loves this! Though I have to thank those reviewers for their tips. I divided the sugar. I put half dark brown sugar and half regular sugar. I also used the idea I read about using vanilla instead of water. I have to make 2 batches at a time so everyone gets some.

Wish I'd seen the comments about usng 1/2/ and 1/2 brown sugar and some vanilla, that sounds good.  But I followed the recipe as written and ust got done making 4 lbs. of them to put in little bags and pass out as gifts.  They are yummy and super easy, and I'll definitely be making these again.  Now, to keep myself from easting them all....

Wow!  I am SO happy I found this recipe.  Absolutely amazing.  After reading other reviews I also used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and also added about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  My husband and I can't stay away from them!  Thanks!

Yummy! Used 1 tbsp vanilla and cayenne instead of cinnamon!

These were SO yummy!  We could barely stop eating them.  When I got them out while I had company, they lasted all of 5 minutes.  I did use other's suggestions and used 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar, and instead of 2 tablespoons water I used 1, and 1 tablespoon of vanilla.  And every time I stirred them while they were baking (in a 9x13 cake pan) I had to wash the spoon off because I kept licking it :-)

I thought these were hard to make but this recipe is pretty easy. I added more cinnamon, only because I like this strong flavor. Otherwise, I made the recipe as is and it came out great! I definitely recommend it! Oh, I cut the baking time in half by baking at 400 like others suggested.

Very good!  I used half brown and half white sugar (based on the ingredients I had on hand) and one tablespoon of vanilla in place of one tablespoon of water.  VERY easy and my husband and daughter loved them.  Thanks!
