I chose this recipe for the Recipe Photo Contest, but also because it sounded delicious! It didn't disappoint. The only change I made was to use orange zest instead of tangerine. I ran into one slight issue with the recipe: after I pressed the juice out of the pineapple and added back 3/4 cup, my batter was incredibly dry. I ended up adding almost all of the juice back into the mixture (at least 1/4 cup extra.) This may have been my fault, because I REALLY pressed the juice out of that pineapple. Could be that some canned pineapple has more juice than others, too. The bread baked perfectly in 60 minutes, filling my house with the most delicious smell! I cheated and cut it while it was still a little warm. It was so good- almost dessert-like. The next time I think I will just add the whole can of pineapple, juice and all, as I only had about 1 TBSP of juice left. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

I used oranges instead of tangerines since I couldn't find them at my grocer, however, it made my kitchen smell wonderful.  The bread itself was a bit crumbly, but was delicious.

Well it smelled great and the texture seemed good, but after it was done cooking, and and hour and ten minutes was way too long to cokk by the way, the cake kind of sank a bit, and it was still too gooey in the middle.  The flavor was ok, not real pineapply, it was disappointing.  This was one of the first recipes I made off this site that didn't already have any reviews for it yet, so I was taking a chance, now I know to stick to the recipes with many reviews.  Oh well!  It could have been good, Somethings missing thought & I don't know what it is.

A great, unique taste.  Not sweet, which is fine by us.  Therefore would probably make a great breakfast bread.  I followed the directions and drained the pineapple, but next time I won't since I got just under 3/4 c juice anyway!  I made two small loaves and cooked them for 60 minutes.  They came out perfect consistency.

I used the juice from 5 tiny tangerines due to small amount of pineapple juice available in the small tin of crushed pineapple that I had. To make up for that I added a small, very ripe mashed banana.  I'm a retired pastry chef/sous chef and have baked a LOT. I think that this would be very good made with cream of coconut subbed for part of the butter. It's a nice recipe that would have been better as written 
with the full amount of pineapple instead of the banana, but was still a tasty, basic muffin that my grandchildren enjoyed warm at the foot of the sledding hill at 11F!   Thanks for posting, JJOHN32!

10-01-15 ~ Looking for another quick bread to take to our son and DIL, I came across this one.  I didn't have a can of crushed pineapple, but did have 3 cans of pineapple rings.  I crushed one of those and used the entire can and all of the juice.  The bread wasn't the least bit dry, nor was it 'wet'.  The flavor was good, but it just didn't pop.  Toasted it helped bring out the flavor.  This recipe made 5 (6 x 3 1/2) mini loaf pans.  I baked it for 34 minutes.

This recipe is not as tasty as the ingredients.  The bread comes out a little on the dry and crumbly side of moisture content.  I would like to try it again with some apple cider to add to the moisture and taste.

The batter was very thick and needed to bake longer than called for.  The flavor was good but the texture was doughy
