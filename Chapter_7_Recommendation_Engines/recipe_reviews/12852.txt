Nice, basic shrimp salad. What was different about this for me was simply gettting away from the ubiquitous dill and adding onion and lemon juice instead, something I never do.  I've learned a little lemon juice is nice but I can do without the onion, and I didn't use nearly as much as called for!  A little bit'll do ya!

This was a great recipe, but I did change it just a little:)!!!  I turned it into a macaroni type salad by cooking macaroni noodles and adding them to the mixture.  Other than that, I didn't change anything else and I thought that they were a good, quick, and simple lunch:)!!!

Great Recipe.  I added a teaspoon of Old Bay to liven the taste and diced some avocado at the suggestion of another reviewer.  Didn't use quite the amount of mayo called for.  Great Recipe!!!!!!

Way too much mayo, but that's easily remedied.  I started off using only 1/4 cup and adding a Tbsp at a time.  Just enough mayo to hold the ingredients is what I like. This was delicious if you cook the shrimp using the Old Bay recipe found on this sight. I stuff green peppers with this for my friends who don't like raw tomatoes and then we're all happy!

I made a mistake when writing up this recipe. Use the bunch of celery. At least 6 stalks! Chop fine.

We enjoyed this recipe. I did add a pinch of "Old Bay". This will be my go to recipe for shrimp salad. Thank you for the recipe.

I prepared this as an appetizer for last night's dinner and was very pleased with the end result.  I added chopped avocado just before serving and it complimented the shrimp perfectly.  Only change I'd make is use less mayo next time and more lemon.  Flavours improved overnight although it didn't do much for the avocado!

Obviously I didn't have a pound of shrimp leftover from our party, but what I did have left in the freezer, I decided to make for lunch today as I had an incredible craving for shrimp salad. I didn't do any measuring, just used some common sense. I added some additional seasonings and served it (to myself) in a partially hollowed out tomato. This hit the spot, Robin!

This is so good and versatile. I ate it by itself.  I ate it on salad greens. My favorite use was as a topping for french bread with cheddar cheese on top and broiled.  Just like in some fancy restaurant.

Way too much mayo and very "blah." Needed a lot of seasoning. I used "lite" mayo and served it on fresh hoagie rolls. I was expecting a Louisiana, kind of po boy sandwich, but my husband and I weren't too crazy about it. I won't make it again.

Used just enough M Whip to wet everything just a bit.  Was craving shrimp salad after having a sample of it at Costco. Added a bit of flat leaf parsley and served with rice crackers.

I used frozen cooked salad shrimp from Trader Joe's and less mayo (lite) than recipe called for.  Served open faced on whole grain bread with lettuce and tomato, it was very good.

This was wonderful. I left out the tomatoes since my husband does not care for them. I made a corn bread (Jiffy) and served the shrimp salad on corn bread sandwiches. It was delicious!!!!!

After reading all the reviews I cut the mayo in half, used green onions a dash of hot sauce and pinch of old bay and 1t of chopped fresh cilantro.  It was a huge hit.  I only use wild gulf shrimp.  It makes a bug difference on flavor.  If you use farmed the lemon will be overpowering as farmed raise have much less flavor.  Brava Robin! I tip my hat to you!

I found this a bit bland, but don't really know what it needed.  I should note that it might have been better had I not taken the lazy route and put the salad shrimp in frozen.  As they thawed, the salad turned watery - my fault.  Even done properly, tho, I think it needs something else.  Good potential here.

This was EXCELLENT! We loved it. The only thing I changed was the mayo....I was almost out so I couldn't add as much as it called for. And the topper......My mothers name was Doris so I HAD to try it. She loved shrimp as much as we do!

Really good base recipe. I made it as written and served it on hoagie rolls using a slotted spoon because it was runny.  The citrus made it taste almost like ceviche, which I love. I followed another reviewer's suggestion of serving with diced avocado and some halved cherry tomatoes, which, if it had been in the original recipe, would've made it 5-stars. I also subbed tarragon for the dill and it was terrific!

Very good but had toooo much mayo in it.  Had to drain some out.  I think it was watery because of the celery and onion.  Next time I will make it I will be sure to drain the celery and onion first. Otherwise very good.

Simple. Delicious. Adaptable. Mine needed no extra salt and I used a bit less lemon juice, but I loved this recipe.  I added freshly chopped parsley and some Old Bays. This is a recipe that celebrates the fresh, wonderful flavor of shrimp, and doesn't cover it up with a heavy flavored sauce . Which is  great, when you want that, but I was looking for  a recipe that simply enhanced the shrimp . . . and I found it here. A keeper to be sure!

I made this for my culinary class to put on some cream puff shells and it was a big hit! I did add a little bit of mint, because it felt as if it was missing something.
