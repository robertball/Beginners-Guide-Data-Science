Taste was very good.  I keep mine in the freezer due to it being soft.

The flavor of this 'fudge' was very good. The texture was terrible. It was gooey, sticky and greasy. I had to place in freezer for 20 minutes before I was able to somewhat cut them or else they just stuck to the knife. The only way I was able to place them in mini liners was to insert toothpicks on either side and carefully drop them in. They were just a gooey sticky glob and very hard to work with.
