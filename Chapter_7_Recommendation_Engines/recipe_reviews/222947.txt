I thought these tasted fine, but I had a couple of problems. I couldn't understand why the squash is not dipped in any liquid first? I wanted to follow the exact directions though. I ended up with about 1/2 of the cormeal leftover. Also, on some of them the skin stayed tough. Make sure to cut them the 1/8". The thinner ones were the best. In addition, make sure to use a smaller yellow squash. On the larger, or over grown ones, the skin is naturally tougher and with larger seeds. The ones I made with the overall smaller yellow squash were the ones that turned out well.

This is a great quick squash recipe. The only change I suggest is add seasonings to fit your taste. I followed the recipe as listed and then added dried rosemary, parsley, basil, garlic powder, and sea salt. Imagine fried okra but with the flavor of squash.

This is pretty close to the way my Grandmom always cooked squash. For a real kick try frying in bacon drippings.

I made this for my son and I, just as written, and we thought it was really good.  It was our first time trying yellow squash and I think we both agree that we'll be eating it again.  I did salt the squash after it was fried.  Very tasty!

I added a little chili powder to the mix. Instead of putting the squash in the bag of corneal, I dipped each slice in oil, then dipped in the batter, then fried. Taste good.

These were so good!  My husband was disappointed that I didnâ€™t make more. I added a little dried parsley and minced onion to the mix but other than that I made no changes.

5 stars even with using Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free cornbread mix.  Truly worthy of my WV roots.  I made a dipping sauce with some Ranch and creamy horseradish.

I'd been looking for a variation to freeze battered squash.  Had been using buttermilk, flour, and corn meal.  This option with corn meal mix is tasty, crunchy and doesn't burn as quickly.  It's a great recipe.  I only gave it less than 5 because I thought it needed something to help the breading stick, so I added a milk bath.

I was cooking some okra and used the flour and cornmeal to bread the squash. I really liked it. Will be cooking it again

No changes - the corn muffin mix all came off - the oil bubbled when I put some of the mix in - maybe it wasn't hot enough - I'll go back to the tried and true egg wash method
