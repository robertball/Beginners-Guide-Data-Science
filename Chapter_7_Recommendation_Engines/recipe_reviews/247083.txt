I followed the recipe!    I added sliced potatoes under the breasts, topped with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.   Baked , covered at 350 for one hour.  Great one dish meal!

This was very tasty. The pepperoni added a nice twist to our usual chicken parm. I made the chicken cutlets the way I normally do with a flour dusting egg wash and then the bread crumbs. Also I used seasoned bread crumbs so I didn't bother adding any additional herbs to the bread crumb mixture.

I made this recipe as written and it was wonderful. I would not make any changes and would definitely make again.
