This was so yummy!  I served it with bow tie pasta and Asiago cheese - next time I think I might add some chicken broth to give it more of a sauce at the end.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe!  I used 5 medium sized pepperoncinis and it was just the right spice!  It's a keeper!

This recipe was delicious tasting.  I served over rice.  Seemed like it needed to have more juice at the end.  Next time I make it my thought is to add chickent broth with the wine.

Yummy!!  I followed someone else's suggestion and served this over bow tie pasta (added butter, garlic salt and Asiago cheese to the pasta).  I also added 2 minced garlic cloves to the onions when I cooked them. Upon serving, I sprinkled more Asiago over the chicken and splashed with a bit of balsamic. This was very good and flavorful!

I was confused as where to put the wine, I just let it simmer with wine much longer than suggested.  After you sauteed the vegetables and added the chicken, pour about 1/4 c. of pepperoncini juice with it as well.  Cover and let it simmer for about 40 minutes with the wine and dash some garlic salt to it.  Don't forget to flip the chicken now and then because it will burn.  The wine just soaks up the flavors!

I thought this recipe was good, but it's a little stinky--be sure to have doors or windows open.

this recipe was fantastic.  I made it just as the directions said, and it came out wonderful.  My family ate the entire pot!  I will definately be making this one again.

This was an AWESOME recipe.  it eats like a stew, so I loved it over white rice.  The family Loved it.  I added a few extra pepperoncini peppers because I like it spicey, but not too much.  will definately Make it again!

it was decent. My husband usually raves about my cooking but this one didn't go over so well. I was expecting bursts of flavor but it seemed quite bland to me. Thank you for the recipe but unfortunately this one didn't work for us. Maybe...I did something wrong.

Very good.  We wished the chicken had stayed crispy (the coating soaks up the wine and pepper juice).  Next time, I'll wait until the very end to add the chicken back to the pan.  There's no 'sauce' for pasta or rice, so we ate this with a big side salad and steamed broccoli.

I LOVED this recipe as did my fiance! The one thing we did do is we left out the wine and it was still fantastic!

It was a success in my home! I didn't have wine and simply left it out. Used a lil more oil and pepperocinni juice to make up for wine. I served over top of rice with the chicken cut up (all mixed together) and everyone devoured it! Good recipe

Quite tasty, although I definitely prefer it with  potatoes over noodles.  That may just be because I prefer potatoes to noodles.  Also, I feel like the flavor comes through a lot more when it's cold.  This is bad for attrition through snacking.

This was yummy, I increased the amounts of mushrooms and added 1/2 stick of butter, increased wine to 1 cup, and added some of the pepper chino juice!  Just yummy!!
