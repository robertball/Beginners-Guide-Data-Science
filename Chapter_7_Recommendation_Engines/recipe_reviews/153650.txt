I've made this recipe for years.  I use a big 30-cup perculator and put the spices in the basket and the juices where the water goes.  It makes the house smell as good as the Wassail tastes

Made this for Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it!  I made it in the crock pot and put it on high for about 45 minutes.  We will be making this again!

Spiked it with spiced rum, very good.  Tried to cut back on the sugar, but it reallly did require the full amount.

Delicious!  My oranges sort of disentengrated, maybe I let it simmer too long, but it didn't seem to matter, I strained it and it was very delicious!

DELICIOUS smell and taste, and a huge hit at my potluck. My oranges also disintegrated, but it tasted so good nobody seemed to mind a bit of pulp. Next time I will try simmering the oranges in cheesecloth so the pieces don't ruin the look of the wassail. I will be making this over and over again!

Delicious! The orange slices do disintegrate, but I didn't mind the pulp. This tasted and smelled fabulous.

I would prefer a stronger cranberry & orange flavor. Maybe with just cloves and less cinnamon stick.

This was a huge hit for all ages at Christmas!  I did add a handful of red hots but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Will definitely make again!

This was easy to make and stayed warm in the crock pot all day (until it was gone anyway). It was a hit and I will definitely make this again next year!

Made this for a Christmas party last year, and it was a great hit! Added some spiced rum and it was even better! Now everyone asks if I'm making it again for the New Year's party this year!

I spiked it with everclear.  It sits In a pan which is on a trivet on top of our wood stove all Christmas day. Refilled as needed. Great drink in the winter.

I've been making another wassail recipe for years, and didn't think it could be improved upon.  This is hands down fabulous! Everyone really enjoyed the fresh tartness of this cranberry wassail, saying they preferred it over the other wassail recipe that contained orange juice rather than cranberry. This will be made from now on. Use original cranberry juice cocktail.
12/22/16 - Make this in the large stockpot, as the recipe is too large for the crockpot.

too much cranberry. My family thought it needed more spice.
