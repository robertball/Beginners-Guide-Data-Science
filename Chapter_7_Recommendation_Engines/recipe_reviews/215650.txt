I made these cookies a couple months ago. I followed the recipe exact, only using organic ingredients, a mixture of semi-sweet and dark chocolate chips, Kettle chips and Rold Gold pretzles. These were extremely well loved by this family. They really did not last long. Very, very good. I suggest that you chill the dough for an hour to firm up the dough slightly and let the cookies cool on a baking sheet for a minute or two before trying to take them off.

Great combination of sweet and salty all rolled into one fabulous treat!  This was a wonderful take on a classic chocolate chip cookie.  No matter what brand of chips, pretzels and peanuts you use this is sure to please.  I baked these on parchment paper and be sure to chill the dough so it's easier to work with.  I made the recipe exactly and had great results.  Perfect warm out of the oven with an ice cold glass of milk!

When I saw this recipe, I thought- wow! All that is right in the world (and wrong!) in one recipe.  But after making, it is just too much for one cookie.  They are not bad, just not great.  All the ingredients leave it with a trail mix kinda feeling.  Plus I find that there is too much variety from bite to bite.  I probably will not make these again.

I'm a sweet & salty girl, so this recipe was for me.  The changes:  I decreased the chocolate chips by half and added some red & green m&ms.   also added potato sticks, crumbled, instead of the potato chips, and the rest was per the recipe.  Loving them!

These are yummy. It's a nice change from the plain old chocolate chip cookie. I made a half batch and got two dozen cookies. I did not use the peanuts.

I wasn't sure I would like these cookies, but they are good!!  I made them today and gave them to all the neighbors and they loved them too!  So, they sound odd, but try them, they are delicious!

I was a bit disappointed with these.  I agree with other reviewers, perhaps just too much going on in these cookies.

To say that I started making these cookies with a little trepidation would be an understatement.  I mean, really, this is a recipe you would concoct after one too many glasses of wine.  It didn’t help matters to have your husband looking over your shoulder having a melt-down that there were potato chips in his beloved Toll House cookies.  Man up Sweetie.  The end product was ok, but it depended on what ingredients were in each bite you were tasting.  We love Toll House cookies, but the flavors in this recipe were too convoluted for us.  The old adage, “if it it’s not broke, don’t fix it” comes to mind.  We’ll stick with the original.

Just remade these with a minor tweak. Last year I thought kettle chips would make these better and they do! I used kettle potato chips with sea salt. I also used sea salt in the recipe and that helped with the sweet and salty contrast. I also do not recommend making these with margarine. I had some on hand and decided to use it instead of butter and my cookies spread a lot. Like in my original review I chilled the dough and made other high altitude baking adjustments.

I couldn't wait to try these.  And I was right.  Could have been my oven, could have been all the dry ingredients, but they were just a tad dry for my taste.  I really like a moist cookie but I LOVED the sweet salty combination  Because neither my husband nor myself will eat a lot of sweets, I had him take them to work - 12 guys on a SWAT security team.  Randomly and spontaneously throughout the night he would hear an expression of how good the cookies were.  He came back with an empty plate.  I would say it's a hit and a real twist to the typical chocolate chip cookie.

I was pretty excited when I saw this recipe and thought how much I'd love it. I followed the recipe to the T, but they turned out good but not great. I think it was a little bit too much for this little cookie. Maybe next time I'll omit either the chips or the pretzels. Other than that they cooked perfectly.

The cookie was good, but, honestly I can't say that the addition of the potato chips or the pretzels really did anything for this cookie.   The only difference I really noticed was that you got a crunchy bite when you bit down on a pretzel.  Probably will just stick to the plain chocolate chip cookie recipe instead of having the added expense of two extra ingredients that in my opinion didn't enhance the flavor.

I love Toll House cookies and find this recipe as proof you shouldn't mess with perfection.  Although, I love pretzels and potato chips, they don't enhance this cookie.  The potato chip adds more greasiness and the pretzel made it drier.  It depended on what was in your "bite" as to how it tasted.  Too much going on as others have stated.  Sorry Toll House, your product is great but not this recipe.

These were delicious and a big hit at the pot luck I took them to! I used Kettle plain potato chips, which tend to stay extra crispy. These were crunchy, salty and sweet - the perfect little treat!

These cookies are great!  I'd anticipated a bit more "salt" to them w/the chips, pretzels, and salted peanuts I used, but they were still great.  I did bake at 300, as is my personal cookie baking preference thanks for Felix K!  This is a nice change of pace from the usual chocolate chip cookie.  (Disclaimer:   I made these as part of an Allrecipes All Star assignment sponsored by Nestle, but rest assured I am the boss of me and my opinions are mine and mine alone...)

Very yummy. I did not add the potato chips because that sounded really salty. I am at high elevation so I added a little extra flour,(1/8 C) but after the first batch came out VERY flat and oily, I added an additional 1/2 cup to the dough. Next time I will just add an additional 3/4 or 1 cup of flour to the whole thing. They came out great. Soft and delicious! Make sure to use unsalted butter for this recipe! The pretzels gave it just the right amount of salt-sweet combo!

I was pleasantly surprised by these cookies!  I didn't expect to like them very much, but it turns out I actually love them.  The saltiness from the pretzels and potato chips balances the sweetness of the cookie and the chocolate chips perfectly.  I only made a half batch because I was worried about wasting ingredients if we didn't like them, but now I'm wishing I'd gone ahead and made the whole recipe!

Soo sorry Toll House, I seriously wanted to love THIS cookie, while I love a lot of the other recipes with your products in them, this was not one for them. The batter with all the ingredients was rockin' before I baked them, but after I baked the batch...not that great, they were more okay then anything, the peanuts and the potato chips were not great at all. And the potato chips lost their crunch and became rubbery. Really bummed over the recipe.

I don't really know what to say about these. Odd little cookie. I think they have to much going on in them. I thought that the chips would be strange in the cookies but those were ok, the pretzels threw me off. I think these would be better with just peanuts added in. Everyone here thought they were okay but they wouldn't want them again.

I have to say I was very sceptical making this recipe, but it has now become a favorite in our household...I did not change a thing.  I think I actually like these better than regular choc. chip cookie, I love the sweet and salty combination!!!

These are pretty good.  I do have to tell you that of all the things I've made lately, that there are still some of these left.  That tells you something since that was several weeks ago.  Thanks for the idea, though.  I'll probably try adding pretzels to them and leave out the potato chips the nexgt time.

Family liked this cookie quite well. We prefer a soft cookie so I added a piece of bread to the container I had the cookies in and the cookies stayed soft but the chips and pretzels seemed to stay crunchy. They only lasted a few days and were enjoyed by all.

These are a big hit at my house.  After eating a couple of bites, and telling me she LOVED them, I told my nine year old what was in them.  When she heard that they had potato chips in them, her eyes got as wide as plates.  Potato chips in cookies?  They're yummy.
I made a few changes, not by choice, but by necessity.  First change was that I made a double batch, since I needed TONS.  My girls had eaten away at most of my semi sweet chips, so I had to use some milk.  In the doubling of the batch, I found that the add ins (pretzels, chips, peanuts & chips) were just too many, so I ended up using about 1 and a half bags of semi sweet chips, half a bag of milk chips, 2 cups crushed chips, one cup broken pretzels, and 1/2 cup peanuts.  The other change I made was that I made them twice the recommended size - two Tablespoons of dough for each cookie.  This meant they needed more baking time, about 14-15 minutes.  I still have some dough balls in the refrigerator to bake next week, closer to the time I will be gifting them, and some dough in the refrigerator, which I will be baking later as well.
These are just perfect, crunchy edges, soft chewy middles, sweet, salty, yummy!

I baked these in muffin tins and added the potato chip the last couple of minutes of baking. The kidlets thought they were fun "chip dip" cookies. I thought they were just ok.Thanks for sharing.

These were actually much better than I expected. I made them as recipe selection for the Allrecipes Allstars month of December. I accidentally bought unsalted pretzels. They worked fine, because I chose to add the optional peanuts and they were lightly salted and not unsalted. I would highly recommend adding the peanuts. I did slightly chop them though. I liked the textures and blend of salty and sweet. However, to be honest the potato chips are what did not work for me. They lost their crispness, and took on a chewy texture, and I used the ruffled kind recommended. Their flavor was too dominant also somewhat. I would try something like this again, for the different textures, but just leave the chips out. I made 1/2 recipe and got 35 cookies using a standard cookie scoop.

I expected these cookies to be really salty, they weren't but they are really sweet.  Like another reviewer said, there is too much going on here. You never know what the next bite is going to bring.  These were not a big hit in our house.

Only one comment, I was surprised that the chips-peanuts-pretzel combination didn't add more flavor to the cookies.  These definitely are tasty, but the chocolate chip flavor totally dominates...not that that is a bad thing!

These were fantastic!  My favorite holiday treat is white chocolate covered pretzel and peanut bark so, I replaced half the semi-sweet chocolate chips with white chocolate chips and they were absolutely to die for.  Will definitely be making again and again!

I've always been a big fan of the salty/sweet combo, so I had to try this recipe.  I omitted the salt and peanuts, reduced the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup, and broke the chips and peanuts pretty small so there would be some of everything in every bite.  Very yummy!  I'll make these again.

Not bad!  Just like the traditional Toll House cookies, but with a little bit of a twist.  I used kettle chips and never time I will definitely a thicker ripple chip.  I also omitted the peanuts because we were having company over and one person has a nut allergy.  Would make again.

These were so good. I left out the peanuts, but will prob use next time to up the salt factor. I used Ghiradhelli milk choc chips, which I can imagine tasted better than the semi-sweet the recipes calls for.

why isn't this the next big thing to hit bakeries? enough with the cutesy cupcakes. bring on the cookies that feature snack food ingredients. followed the recipe to the tee. have made several times. always fun to have people guess the magical ingredients and then say "really? why aren't these taking the place of overpriced, underwhelming cupcakes?" with this being said - next time I watch Shark Tank and see someone pleading Mr. Wonderful to invest for 10% ownership of their gourmet desserts that have snack food ingredients - please please send me some samples of your goodies and remember I do freelance package design.

I wasn't expecting to like this cookie as much as I did. Because I didn't want big chunks, I probably broke the chips and pretzels into smaller pieces than most other people. These cookies even froze very well.

I would love these if I didn't feel so guilty eating them! For presentation the dough should be separated out and then chilled but if your like me your making cookies because you want cookies not because you want them to look nice. I skipped refrigerating anything and baked. They look alright but not impressive.

These are really good - I think I could do without the potato chips.  They aren't bad but they don't seem to add a lot for me.  I do like how the pretzels, and I think I might experiment with other add ins like toffee brickle.  Definitely a keeper!

These cookies were really interesting.  I couldn't wait to try them.  (I'm a big fan of sweet and salty.)  I loved the texture (when the cookies were fully cooled).  And I really liked the sweet and salty combination.  My family loved them.  Definitely worth a try!

I have been wanting to make these all month!  I made them according to the directions with only one change...My chocolate chips "mysteriously" disappeared from my pantry so I was foced to use a combo of white choc and butterscotch chips instead.  I really like these!  I can't taste the potato chips but the pretzels come through very nicely.  Great recipe!  I will make these again!

These were good, but I think I'm going to stick with my tried-and-true Nestle chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I, too, left out the potato chips at the advice of other reviewers, as I've had soggy potato chips  before.  I did add the pretzels, and unfortunately, didn't like them that much (and I'm a BIG salty and sweet fan.)  One thing that did pleasantly surprise me was the peanuts.  They added a nice touch of salty without being overbearing like the pretzels seemed to be.  I'm interested to see what happens when I just add peanuts, because I'm on board that cookie train!

Wow. There's a lot going on in these cookies! First let me state that I tweaked these a bit - we don't eat potato chips in our house, so I didn't have any on hand to include in this recipe. Thinking about what would provide a salty complement to the chocolate chips I substituted salted, chopped cashews for the potato chips, and I omitted the peanuts. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.
In my opinion these cookies were just, OK. My kids ate two each and said they were good, but definitely not a new favorite.

These were pretty good, but they were a little strange. If I made them again, I would definitely omit the potato chips -- to me, they added a strange texture. The peanuts, pretzels and chocolate chips were delicious, though.

These were SO GOOD.  I wasn't sure about the pretzels, but they made a great addition.  The kids can't get enough either.  I didn't change a thing!

I made these as the recipe states and did include the optional peanuts. I would leave the peanuts out next time, as the flavor is overpowering. I love the salty taste the pretzels and chips bring to these cookies. I recommend making the dough a day ahead and letting it rest in the fridge overnight before baking. It dramatically affects the flavor for the better.

Love the combo of sweet and salty! Here is what I did: I used salted peanuts and broke them up a bit. I broke up the pretzels as directed. I also crushed the potato chips into 1/2 - 3/4 inch pieces. I found that the smaller sizes help with a more even distribution and equal salty flavors in each bite.   Next time I will omit the potato chips because we found they really didn't add much to the cookie and we could barely taste it. I froze these, and once thawed, they were equally as delicious and the texture remained unchanged. I don't bake often, but when I do, I will make these again!

I loved the dough before baking.  It kind of lost something after baking though and I really didn't notice the chips in it anymore.  However, taking these to work to share, EVERYONE who had one came to me to tell me how much they liked them.  They disappeared very fast!  Instead of semi-sweet chips, I went with 1 cup dark chips and 1 cup white chips.

I thought I'd try this unique twist on choc chip cookies, especially for those who need a little variety from all pure sweet sweets out there during the holidays. Tip: Easier to scoop if you refrig the dough 30 min. Use a mix of white choc and regular choc chips. YUM! Complements the salty flavor beautifully. Even people who don't have a sweet tooth will enjoy them (like my husband who raved about them). I can't wait to serve them!

These were the best cookies! I made it with the original recipe, but then I did it again with only the chocolate chips and they were still delicious. Rock salt instead of regular salt really kicks it up a notch
