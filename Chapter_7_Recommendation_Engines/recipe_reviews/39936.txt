My 2 year old loves noodles, and she INHALED this dish.  My 5 year old helped me make it, so it is definitely easy.  For people who like subtle taste it is on the mark.  Next time I'll try and sneak more apricot in and double the topping, which was devine.  Think it's worth your trying.

I don't think I have ever been asked by as many people as I was for this Kugel recipe!  It was THE best, but I did play with the recipe a bit.  I used a container of Pineapple cottage cheese instead of the cream cheese, then I added one more egg and a medium can of crushed pineapple and it's juice.  It was fabulous!  I hope I can do it again and make it as good!

Everybody loved this kugel.  My husband's grandmother already asked me if I was going to make it again for the holidays!

This recipe was good, although I had to change it a bit because my Walmart does not carry apricot nectar.  (I used peach instead.) I will leave out the raisins next time and I think I'll add more sugar to make it a bit sweeter.   
Also, I mixed the noodle mixture the night before and added the topping the next day just before I cooked it.  This worked perfectly - although I added a few more minutes to the baking time.  I brought it to a Seder a few nights ago and several people commented on how good it was. Over all, it turned out good ~ one of the better kugel recipes that I have tried.

This is the best noodle kugel recipe.  It is so moist and delicious.  I substituted half and half for the milk for extra creaminess.  My family loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe for a party of over 100 people. All of it was eaten and praised. People said they had seconds and thirds instead of dessert. I will be sure to make it again.

Unbelievable - so delish. I cut down on the butter though - it was just too much - and next time I might cut even more. I didn't have white sugar, so I used brown and it was fantastic.

I didn't follow this exactly - but I used the basic amounts for a quick kugel with the ingredients I had on hand.  I used a 12-oz box of tri-color twist pasta. I left out the apricot nectar and raisins - and even with a reduced amt of sugar it was plenty sweet for us. The rest was like the recipe but with a bit more cream cheese and 4 eggs instead of 3.  I just sprinkled cinnamon and sugar for a topping. Came out great!

I've made this ahead of time twice now for group events, doubling the recipe for a 9x13 pan, reheating it just prior to the meal.   Rave reviews!  I have used apricot preserves as I have never seen apricot nectar & it works just fine.  Thanks.

Wow! This kugel is terrific. I doubled the recipe to make enough for a potluck luncheon at work. I added peach nectar, instead of apricot - it was on sale. I chopped up some dried apricots in my food processor to replace the raisins. I don't really care for golden raisins. The cornflake topping really made the dish. I cut back on the butter, using 6 Tbs. instead of 1/2 cup in the topping.  My grandmother was my inspiration for this dish and she would have been proud of me. It was almost as good as hers.

Next time I will use a little less butter - it came out a bit greasy. That said, it's an awesome VERY sweet kugel and was a hit at my Break the Fast party.

Followed this recipe with the exception of peach juice vs. apricot nectar (could not find any). It was good, my kids weren't real impressed. It falls into the category of a bread pudding or rice pudding and I prefer the other venues better. Just a matter of preference, it is a good recipe.

Made this kugel for Mother's Day. Got rave reviews. It will probably be the only "sweet" kugel I'll make from now on. Thank you so much.

I used this topping on a dairy kugel and it was delicious.  My kugel recipe filled a 9x13 pan, so I had room for only half the topping recipe.  I froze the remaining topping to use on the next kugel!

I'm not a big fan of sweet kugel, but my guests liked this a lot. I added chopped dried apricots and omitted the topping - it was totally fine without, and the edges of the noodles sticking out on top got nice and crispy. This is definitely a dessert - quite sweet and pretty rich. Next time I'd probably cut down the white sugar by half, since the nectar adds a lot of sweetness. Also, the middle never set, so I might add an extra egg?

the top noodles are not in the mix used a 9x9 pan and there was not enough juice mixture to come to the top of the dish. Tastes good though

The Best! Didn't change a thing. Family Loves it. We're not even Jewish!
A deffinate must have for that sweet tooth and for something different.

Funny thing is that I was at the Ventura County Fair in 01' with my cousins from the Garmon Ranch. I followed the recipe except for the apricot nectar (yep, try finding that) so I used spreadable apricot fruit in place of it. This turned out addictingly good. Thank you Diane for a great recipe.

I've been making this for years, it's a fabulous recipe that I share regularly with colleagues, friends, family, really anyone who mentions kugel, or anything that reminds me of kugel, or if they say apricot. Or noodle. You get the idea!!

This had way too much apricot-it overpowered the dish. I may try it again with less and see how it goes.
