I doubled this recipe for our family Christmas dinner.  I modified it by doubling the garlic and rosemary, and by adding a layer of shredded Gruyer (sp?) cheese between top and bottom layers of potatoes, then the parmesean on top.  In order to be sure the potatoes were sliced consistently thin I used an inexpensive mandolin slicer set on the thinnest setting.  Everything turned out terrific.  Rich, creamy, cheesy, and very 'special occasion'feeling.  The leftovers stored and heated well over several days, also.  Great recipe!

Ok...OMG!  This is a great recipe.  I added on it a little due to the reviews about it being bland.  I made it per directions (subbing 1 cup of fat free half & half instead of 2 full fat), then I layed half of the potatoes out, sprinkled 1/3 cup parmesan, and 1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese.  Layered the rest of the potatoes, and topped with the other 1/3 cup parmesan, and more goat cheese. Also, I cooked them for what it said, but at 400 (because that is what my meatloaf was cooking at), and it was fine.  My husband thought these were divine!

This was an excellent dish. I made two small changes; I added about a tablespoon of crushed red pepper flakes with the other seasonings, and I topped with grated cheese in addition to the parmesan. Very very satisfying.

Great expectations for this recipe resulted in great disappointment.  Hubby said it best with "these taste like rosemary flavored moosh."

Wow, these were really wonderful.  I used more fresh rosemary than stated and used fat-free half and half.

I made this last night for the first time, with steak and vegetables. They are absolutely delicious, and very easy to make.  I substituted fat-free half & half and it didn't change a thing.  Great recipe!

This was disappointing. The roux that you make with the butter, flour, and cream does not compliment the potatoes. It becomes a little mushy after cooking. I used yukon gold potatoes which I normally use for scalloped potatoes and there was little flavor even with fresh garlic and I doubled the rosemary and cheese. If I were to attempt it again, I would leave out the roux process and instead use pats of butter between the layer of potatoes. I would also lightly season each layer w/ S&P, and cheese. The half and half can be poured over top.I think it has potential,but it just okay as is.

This dish was amazing. Literally, my family & I were jokingly calling them "crack potatoes"!! I followed the recipe exactly until just before baking. I used a large glass pan & when I put the potato mixture in the dish I topped them with parmesan cheese (quite a bit), crumbled goat cheese (4 oz), cooked crumbled bacon pieces & more fresh rosemary. I cooked them at 350 for 50 minutes & they came out wonderful! Not a bite left after Easter dinner yesterday! Definitely a keeper!!

I used fat free half and half, but I don't think that's why I'm giving this a three.  It was just very bland.  It smelled FABULOUS while cooking, but the end result was a little flavorless.

I thought his turned out pretty good.  Although, I didn't have any fresh rosemary on hand so I had to substitute it with dry.  I bet it would have been better with fresh.  I also added about 2/3 cup parmesean to the sauce portion so that the dish would be cheesier as we LOVE cheese.  It smelled super good while in the oven too!!!!

Man, this was one awesome dish.  I was worried about this recipe being bland, so I added half a chopped yellow onion to the mixture (I sauteed the onion in olive oil until translucent to bring out some of the sweetness).  My only change to the recipe besides this was to add about 1.5 times the rosemary, salt, pepper and cheese.  I left it in the oven a little longer uncovered to crisp the cheese, and it was a huge hit at our dinner party.  The only thing that bummed me out was that I had to share it with everybody - I could have eaten the entire dish myself.  I highly recommend this and can't wait to make it again!

This recipe is wonderful!  The only thing I did different is add a sliced up sweet onion in with the potatoes before baking, just because I love the potato/onion combo.

Very good. Made as directed but used dried rosemary as that is what I had on hand. Next time I will use fresh rosemary. I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes very thin. I served this with prime rib for Christmas dinner. My husband couldn't stop raving about the potatoes. Thanks for the recipe.

Simplicity at it's best. Wonderful potato dish, the rosemary gives it a touch of something special. The only change I made was I used 
shredded Parm and stirred it into the white sauce vs just sprinkling on top. The recipe as written is more on the lines of a scalloped potato dish (potatoes cooked within a white sauce) with cheese just sprinkled on top. Au Gratins are potatoes cooked within a cheese sauce. Besides mixing the parm in the white sauce I did sprinkle lots of grated parm on top before baking.

Even though I used some gruyere cheese to layer in there, it was still just a little bland for my taste. A little extra salt and pepper would probably help. I used some on my serving on my plate and it was fine. It did have a nice "Wow" factor for my potluck dinner. I cubed the potatoes instead of slicing, to make it easier for my preschoolers to eat on their own, and cooked it about 10 minutes longer (about 55 minutes total). Still very yummy!

These potatoes are sooooo good!  I never have leftovers when I serve them.  I have made some modifications to make them even tastier.  I start by cooking 3 ounces of chopped pancetta over medium heat until crisp and fat is rendered.  Then I add two chopped shallots, 2 tablespoons of butter instead of 4 and my rosemary, which I double the amount of.  Cook until the shallots are tender and then I proceed with the recipe as written except I do adjust the half and half to thin the sauce just a bit more.  I always get lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.

I love this recipe.  I have fixed Au Gratin potatoes for years and this one is by far the best. I will caution however do NOT exceed the recipes amount of rosemary and if you are using dry use only 1 teas. many cooks thinks think that more is better with herbs but rosemary can be volitile, one reviewer said her dish tasted like "pinesol" that's because of too much rosemary. I have taken many cooking classes in Italy and one of the helpful hints is always to go easy on the rosemary.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

As I am writting this, I have the leftovers of this dish in the oven with another potato added to it.  This dish is a FANTASTIC creation.  I have never made au-gratin potatoes but from the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook that I have had since I got married 38 years ago.  Now, This is my go to recipe for potatoes when I have guests or I just want GOOD potatoes.  My hat is off to Jean Minner!!
WAY TO GO LADY!!

I hate to be THAT person, but this was bland. The top layer with parmesan is fine, but everything under that is so-so. I also learned that I'm not a fan of rosemary in my potatoes, because this almost came out tasting like Pinesol (yes, I did chop the rosemary to avoid having "pine needles"). This needs a can of cream of mushroom soup, more garlic, and a bag of sharp cheddar cheese added to the roux. After letting it sit overnight in the fridge, the rosemary flavored toned down a bit. That was how I salvaged the original recipe. A little bit of bacon or buttered breadcrumbs/cornflakes to give this some texture wouldn't be so bad either.

Very nice twist. BUT, BE SURE TO ADD MORE, MORE GARLIC AND ROSEMARY. Add more spices - double? Because the whole catch of this dish is that it's rosemary flavor in something that doesn't usually have rosemary. But, It needs more flavor. I was scared to add too much garlic, but now I wish I would have added more because the end result was kind of "bland."

I cut some corners and that might be why we didn't like it.  We used 1% milk instead of half & half, garlic powder instead of a clove of garlic and dry rosemary instead of fresh.  So if you are going to try it, make sure not to cut the same corners I did.  I don't think I would say it was gross the way we did it, just very bland!  We won't try this again.

Loved, loved, loved this dish!  I used 2% milk to cut fat and calories-- it turned out well.  I added 4 cloves of garlic just because we like it.  It was a big hit at my house! The fragrance in the house was amazing.  Thanks for such a tasty recipe.  When I made this again, I grated 8 oz. of parmesan cheese and added half to the white sauce.  I put the remainder on top of the potatoes.  Even better!

Excellent! A lovely but simple dish. I didn't have any Parmesan on hand, so I used a pre-shredded mix of asiago, Romano, mozzarella, and smoked provolone, and it turned out fantastically! I also added 1/2 cup of cheese to the white sauce on the advice of previous commenters. Wonderful! I gave it four stars only because I believe it is better with cheese in the sauce and not just on top.

WOW WOW WOW WOW.  These are quite possibly THE BEST au gratin potatoes EVER!  Assembled in lasagna fashion:  sauce, potatoes, cheese, etc. It takes a little bit longer to cook than thought, but it might be my oven.  You will not be disappointed!

These were absolutely yummy!  They were a nice change of pace from the cheesy scalloped potatoes we usually have.  These potatoes were creamy and loaded with flavor!  I used the fat free half and half and was thrilled with the results!  I also did as another reviewer suggested and steeped the rosemary in the sauce mixture.  This added a pleasant rosemary flavor to the dish without overpowering it.  So delicious!

SOO GOOD! This will be my go to potato casserole from now on.  My preferences: I wanted larger cubes of taters instead of slices so I preboiled them whole and skinned and chopped them before adding the sauce.  In total I used about 3/4 C of shredded parm, added 1/2 C to the sauce (yum!) and sprinkled about 1/4 C on top.  I used seasoned salt instead of regular (for color) so I increased it to 1.5 tsp plus I sprinkled some on top for more color.  I didn't add the cheese to the top until after baking for 45 min covered which was good because I was able to blot off some of the oil that had risen to the top first.  I then put back in the oven on broil for 10 min to melt the cheese and brown the top.  Was really good!  Next time I may use 2 cloves of garlic since I love it.  Thanks for a great recipe without canned soup!!!

Made this for a side for young adults for chicken on the grill.  They loved it.  Put a good finely grated cheese on the top. I used one bag of yukon gold potatoes sliced thin and put in a pretty shallow large casserole. For double recipe expect much longer cooking time.  Don't take foil off until at least an hour into baking.  The kids loved it.  I used the fat-free half/half as well.

Cooking time for the potatoes for me was way off - I needed another 30 minutes for potatoes to be cooked all the way (reason for lower rating).  Used skim milk and like other reviewers, added a touch of onion.  Also added swiss cheese blend to the white sauce (instead of all parmesan) and double rosemary.  Fantastic!  Next time will try with additional rosemary and a touch more garlic.  Can't imagine how rich this would have been with half and half cream.

Delicious, but the roux directions are not right for me. I've been taught the ratio 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 with cheese sauce. That means, 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 tablespoons of plain flour, 1 cup of warm milk, 1 cup of grated cheese. The recipe was not dry at all for me with this modification. I used fresh rosemary and chopped fresh garlic, a little cream and fresh grated parmesan. Everyone loved it.

This was a huge hit when I made it for my parents, brother and sister-in-law! More than one person called it "spectacular", and "the best au gratin potatoes I've ever had". I followed some of the other commenters' advice and prepared it in layers, adding some Swiss cheese. I also used whole milk instead of half-and-half, and used crushed garlic instead of minced. I found the cooking time came out to about 2 hours though, that was the only problem. I'll definitely make this again!

This was delicious!  I did add a couple handfulls of italian cheese blend to the white sauce and I used a combination of half and half and milk.  Came out with so much flavor I am considering adding this to my holiday menu.  I used a mandolin to slice my potatoes so they would all be the same size and cook evenly.  Everyone raved!

I thought these potatoes were very tasty. I would add a littl more garlic next time. Also they took a little longer to bake then stated but I will definately make these again.

These potatoes ended up tasting good, but I gave them 3 stars because if I hadn't added 2 extra cloves of garlic, extra parmesan cheese, sauteed onions and some shredded mozz cheese on top right before the potatoes were done, I don't think they would have had much flavor. I also had to redo the rue/roux because the amount of flour the recipe called for was way too much. It just ended up being a big clumpy mess. Overall though mine turned out pretty good and I cut some of the fat by using fat free evaporated milk instead of half & half. I will make these again, but with the modifications I had to make!

My husband really liked this but I just thought it was okay.  There are much better potato dishes out there, but if you love rosemary I'd say you would love this!

My first time making Au Gratin and for 10 people. Great.  I added 1/2 cup of grated fontina cheese to the butter-flour mix and it gives a wonderful little kick to the taste.  Golden potatoes are the way to go.

An excellent recipe. My Whole family loved it. I did make a small change though...since i didn't have the half & half. I substituted it with 12oz of sour cream and a can of chicken broth. my family is a big fan of garlic so i doubled that too, but I'm sure it would have been terrific just following the origional recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving, used Yukon Gold potaotes.  After reading reviews I did make one addition to the recipe.  I added a good amount of Guyer cheese which made the dish so creamy and cheesy!  Everyone commented on the wonderful rosemary flavor.  Will definately make again.

These usually take a bit longer to cook than it says in the recipe, but that could have to do with the fact that I don't actually measure the thickness of the potatoes.

Added a layer of differnt white cheeses to the center for some extra flavor but I would also increase the amount of rosemary. Next time I will also add a sprinkle of garlic powder to add a bit more flavor. My potatoes came out a bit crunchy so make sure you check before serving...no one in my family complained!!!

We fixed this for a family dinner and it was a real success.  Every bite was eaten-no leftovers.  The only change made was to add some browned, minced pancetta and some shallots to the sauce.

I loved the way it turned out. However, I had to use more half-and-half to cover up all of the potatoes.

This recipe was very yummy. The only change in my case was it took about an extra 30 min. baking, so if you are planning it for a meal, you may want to allow extra time for baking. Very good texture, rich and creamy. I will make again- excellent with ham.

I loved this recipes!  I was serving this with ham and other sides with lots of bold flavors so I needed a potato dish that was tamer.  This was really nice, but not flavorless.  For this particualr meal I liked the fact that this dish did NOT have a lot of cheese.  I was serving homemade mac 'n cheese as well and that more than filled the cheese quota.

We really enjoyed this and it was a lot simpler than I thought it would be.  Great tasting too.  I think I probably used more rosemary than was called for, also used some powdered adobo seasoning to kick it up a notch.  We are stuffed!  Will definitely make it again.

The flavor is ok.  It needs a little more flavor with some garlic or onion powder or something.
