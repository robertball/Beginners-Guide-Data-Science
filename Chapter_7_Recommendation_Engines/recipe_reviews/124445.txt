These cookies are great tasting.The only drawback is when they are baking they spread out on the cookie sheet leaving a flat thin cookie.I have used this recipe twice,with the same results.I hated to give up on these cookies so for my third try I put the batter in a baking pan.Came out great as a bar cookie.Used them on my xmas cookie plates and everyone thought they were good.So try making these cookies into a bar cookie.

This cookie was a big hit at my work's cookie exchange. I cut the sugar in half, added about 50% more oatmeal and used golden raisins. I suppose I changed quite a bit, but it was to please all my health conscious co-workers. It was a great cookie. Very moist and yummy!

This recipe would work better if there was another cup of flour. Most cookie recipes have, have at least 2 cups of flour or more. I got interupted when making cookies one time and thought I'd put all the flour in. When I baked the cookies they turned out like what's being described here. So I would say you're short on the amount of flour necessary for these to be a good cookie.

These cookies are great! They're delicious and  they do not turn out flat if you use butter Crisco instead of butter/margarine (which has been true of any cookies I've ever made). Definitely worth trying.

These cookies turned out pretty good. I used a cup of whole wheat flour and only 1 tbs of milk. They didn't turn out flat at all and instead were quite fluffy. I think they could have used some additional flavor...maybe a little extra nutmeg or cinnamon but overall were pretty yummy, healthy, and easy to make. I think some people had trouble because they tried making the cookies too big. Directions say drop tsp amt of cookie dough onto sheet. Try making smaller cookies and they shouldn't spread out as much.

As everyone has already mentioned the cookie spreads horribly in the oven. There is no way I can serve this to anyone.

I make my own apple butter each Fall and these are a perfect way to use up the end of last season's batch! Nut sensitivities necessitated substituting chopped dried apple (use scissors) in place of the nuts and they were YUMMY!

I saw a lot of people's cookies went flat so I substituted whole wheat flour for the flour and used half crisco and half butter, added a little handful of ground flax and they turned out nice and fluffy! yummmm

I took the advice of a previous reveiwer and substituted 1/4 cup of shortening instead of butter, and the cookies did not over spread and turned out well. I also used peach butter instead of apple butter with almonds and raisons. 
They came out soft with a texture more muffin or cakelike then traditionally cookie like. The taste reminded me a bit of carrot cake. They are little different but still good.

I used butter and the cookies turned out very flat and thin.  Some  of the other reviews said they used Crisco (which I don't usually cook or bake with) and said their cookies turned out better.  I added more flour to the batter about half way through and they looked much better.

Our entire family gets together to make apple butter every fall.  That must be the trick to these cookies coming out well. I love these cookies.  Hot they taste almost like apple crisp.  
I substituted chopped dried apples for the raisons.  One time I even used splenda brown sugar and 1/2 whole-wheat flour 1/2 white.  
I had NO problems with the getting thin.  They came out puffy, soft, and chewy every time!

I actually started off baking cookies with a different recipe in mind so there were a few changes. I used approximately 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and 1/2 cup of toasted wheat germ in my cookies. I put in less sugar since I wanted to cut down on it, and I figured that the apple butter and the craisins would make up for it. I skipped the oats since I didn't have any, the salt because the butter was salted, and nuts because one of my sisters is allergic, and substituted raisins for craisins since I preferred it. The result: My parents loved it; my sister and I did not really like it. It was not too sweet but sweet enough due to the apple butter and craisins. The toasted wheat germ did add a certain flavor and texture to it that I thought was interesting. I'm not sure what it was but my cookie tasted more like bread than, well, a cookie. I did not have a problem with thin cookies. You can check my blog for a picture of how it turned out.

I replaced the butter with shortening like prev reviews had mentioned.  The cookies did not come out flat.  They are delicous, the kids loved them and kept asking for more.  The only problem i found was that they are a bit sticky.

I used 2/3 cup oatmeal,1 1/4 cup flour, no milk, 1/2 crisco & 1/2 butter. I also used can-apple butter, dried cranberrries and walnuts. I made sure to refridgerate batter til firm. They were just awsome and did not spread too much.

These cookies turned out beautifully! They're nice and fluffy and made my home smell wonderful! The only thing I added was 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon as my apple butter was not very spicy. I made these for Christmas this year, and I found five missing before i could pop them into the storage containers lol. Apparently they were a hit. I also ended up making a pumpkin butter version as I had a ton left from the farmers' market. The only thing I changed was of course substituting pumpkin butter for apple butter, and I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of cloves. Also, instead of raisins and nuts I threw in a large dark chocolate bar cut into small chunks. Everyone loved them!

Super runny, I love this idea of using apple butter so I will keep trying.  Maybe a bar would be better, the flavor is good.

Turned out really good after all the suggestions. I added a little more flour, used crisco instead of butter, added pie spice, cut the sugar in half and added some vanilla extract. I used chocolate chips and cranberries instead. Yum!

Like other reviews mine didn't come out thick and puffy either.  As the cookies baked they flattened out.  I followed the recipe exactly so don't know what I did wrong.  Maybe needs more flour?  Good flavor and smells great.  Think I will try the cookie bars as another reviewer said next time.  I too make my own apple butter. Good way to use it up.

The batter tasted great, but as the other reviewer mentioned they spread out during baking.  Though it could have been something I did incorrect but it they almost seem soggy(?).
