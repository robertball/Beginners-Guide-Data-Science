Very delicious.  I used 4 large chicken breast and omitted the eggs.  I've been making this recipe for years.  I generally serve this with steamed broccoli or green beans.  A great dish!!

I felt this recipe was easy to make & had plenty of flavor. I was concerned that it didn't have any veggies in it, I just served them on the side. My whole family liked it, even the sitter.

This was a great way to use up leftover roast chicken.  I added celery, carrots, and onions to make a perfect chicken pie.

I loved this recipe...even with a few substitutions.  I omitted the soup and broth and made my own by boiling 4 chicken legs with thyme, bayleaf and crushed corriander seeds.  I thicked with flour, and substituted sour milk for buttermilk (1 tbsp lemon juice in 2% milk. Yummy, light and great served with green beans and salad!

I snazzed this up my own way by first of all omitting the eggs. Just didn't sound right to me. I added in about 1 1/2 cups of frozen mixed veggies. Just the standard peas, corn, carrots and green beans. I also only used 1 cup of broth rather than 1 and 1/4. Just seemed like too much liquid to me. I also just poured the broth and condensed soup into the same pan as the chicken and veggies. Heating the soup seperately seemed like an extra un-needed step. As far as the dough portion I added in an extra 1/4th cup butter milk. Directions should say "spread over top" rather than "pour" the batter was way sticky. I also added in about 1/2 cup of grated cheddar cheese to the batter that made it delish with a nice golden brown crust on the top!!! I will make this again!

This was too buttery.  I will give
it a try another time because
my daughter really liked.  I'll
just cut back on the butter.  I 
left out the eggs and use vegetables.

I write reviews to remember what my family said. Hubby, who is a picky eater, said it was ok. Just told me to not put vegetables in it, which I thought would add a better flavor.

This was great! I made my own chicken broth by boiling the chicken with onion, carrot, poulty seasoning, and parsly... and instead of using buttermilk I used whole milk... it was so good.

We really liked this! Thought the hardboiled eggs were an interesting addition, but ended up liking the idea.  I didn't have any self-rising flour, so I used store brand Bisquick and it worked great.  We'll definitely add this to the rotation because I always have cooked shredded chicken in the freezer and the rest of the ingredients are staples!

OMG! Absolutely delicious! I didn't have a whole chicken, so I sauteed 4 frozen chicken breasts in 2 tsp. minced garlic and diced them before putting them in the pan. I also added some Italian seasoning and some poultry seasoning to the batter. I will definitely make this again!

This was so delicious! My family devoured it in minutes. Next time I will make a double batch, maybe doctor up the second one with onions, potatoes and a green veggie.

My family loved this dish!  I added zucchini to get in some veggies, and it was awesome!  Next time I think I will add more veggies and maybe some pepper.

This recipe was a great inspiration!  I live overseas, so cream of chicken soup must be homemade.  I first made a chicken soup with carrots, onion, celery and chicken.  Then I made a cream base with 2 cups of milk and a rue.  I put the ingredients (minus the eggs), with some broccoli and veggies into a porcelain baking dish and covered it with the biscuit dough.  This chicken pot pie was awesome!!!  My husband ate for three tonight!  I will definitely make it again!

GREAT RECIPE! Did not use egg, but added can of green beans and sliced cooked carrot on top of chicken before adding soup mix. Added a little seasoning to chicken while cooking and some pepper on top before I put in oven. Very tasty and easy to make. The buttermilk biscut topping made it wonderful. Will make again!

Good! I added veggies too (carrots, onions, corn), and the egg, which I really am not sure why it's needed in the first place! Will omit the egg next time.

This is one of my family's favorite recipes with a couple of adjustments...I use 2c. chicken broth with cream of celery soup, and pour 2 drained cans of Veg-All over the chicken and eggs.  I also use only 1/4 c. butter in the crust.  We love this!!!

Omitted eggs. Added veggie mix and used bisquik instead of self-rising flour, also reduced butter by 2 Tblspns. Fantastic flavor. Will definitely make again since it was so easy.

I loved this! (and so did my hubby so extra points there) I do admit that I was alittle unsure as to how much flavor it would have so I added a few spices of my own, but that is what is so good about this recipe is you can play around with it alittle if you want to. I did leave the eggs out though (sorry) I just couldn't bring myself to put them in, so I made deviled eggs to go along with it, and some green beans... awesome dinner!

This dish didn't come out that well for me. It was very soupy. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken, and store-bought honey-roasted chicken strips which made it yummy, but all that juice was not too appealing. I also didn't see the point of the sliced egg, which was not enough to cover the whole pie anyway.

I've made it twice now and both times the dish at the end of dinner was empty.  Put frozen vegtables instead of egg.  Didn't have buttermilk so I used regular milk and a bit of heavy cream.  Great fast and easy meal using a store cooked chicken:)

This is closer to chicken in biscuits than to pot pie.  It was really good after a few revisions.  It needed a little more flavor, so I adding 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 3/4 tsp of poultry seasoning.  1 and 1/2 lbs of boneless chicken seemed like the right amount II wasn't about to cook a 3 pound chicken and then debone it... defeats the purpose of an easy recipe).  I decided the hard boiled egg wasn't offensive, but it just didn't add much.  This needed some veggies anyway.  The cool thing I discovered in another recipe is that you can add a cup of sliced carrots and a cup of sliced celery to the sauce and they will cook while in the oven... no need to precook!  I add half a cup of frozen peas too.  I have also found that 10 oz of frozen peas and carrots is nice (16 oz is too much) and a large can of peas and carrots coupled with a small can of corn works.  I decided that I yearned for more topping so I multiplied everything by 1.5 and it still cooked all the way through.  I don't keep self-rising flour or buttermilk on hand, so I used substitutions and added a little poultry season to the biscuit mixture as well.  In the end, I used 1.5 cups regular flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1.5 of buttermilk (put 1.5 tblsp of cider vinegar in your measuring cups and finish filling with regular milk), 3/4 cup melted butter and 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning.  Makes great lunches for work.  And if you'd like to make it vegetarian, I highly recommend using cream of celery soup, v

Husband really liked this recipe.  I do not like chicken pot pie but he said this was excellent.  He is a picky eater as well and liked that it had his favorite flavors.  I left the eggs out as some other reviews did.  My husband asked me to make this again with homemade noodles.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was an awesome dish! Of course I added a ton of other seasonings but I love the basic idea and adding the egg adds a nice touch. I added cumin,  curry, red pepper, garlic, and some of my Arrabita grinder. It was good!!!

I made this for dinner tonight! Like everyone else who reviewed, I tweaked the recipe but this was a great start! I just think it's a bit bland,and is a great "base", it's fun to fill it with things you like! I ended up shredding the chicken and placing it under the pan, with broccoli on top and then the hard-boiled eggs-I added way more than two. I boiled the condensed soup and broth just like the original recipe. On top of this, I added a layer of different cheeses and Parmesan. Then I added the flour/buttermilk mixture, but I think I increased the measurements by 1/2 cup. On top of that, I added a cheese and Parmesan layer again. It turned out great! Served it with cut potatoes baked in spices and olive oil.

Made the base recipe exactly as written.  For assembly I took the advice of others and omitted the eggs, and added veggies with the chicken, and some Italian & poultry seasonings to the batter.  These changes improved on what would have been a rather bland flavor, but it still could have used a "little something extra" in the sauce to improve on the flavor.  Family ate it, but no raves, just "ok".

Such a delicious recipe, i was in doubt about its success but it turned out great
I omitted the eggs and had no self rising flour so i added 1+1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to a cup of all purpose flour, then i found out i had no buttermilk so i used 1/4 cup of milk and 3/4 cup of plain yoghurt, i also used cream of mushrooms soup instead of cream of chicken.
I Sauteed some onion slices then added frozen vegetable s mix, well the amount of liquids were too much despite i already reduced it next time i will reduce it more
Thanks for the great recipe.
