truly great, truly simple. .chilled for about two hours and to simplify, I made a "log" and rolled it in plastic wrap; just sliced, dolloped and baked. No rolling or unnecessary handling.  Baked about 15 minutes though. and

This is a great recipe.  My dough was great to work with, very flaky dough.  Just what I was looking for.  Was great with all my fillings!  Thanks for sharing!  I had to make cookies for the holidays so I tripled this recipe and it still worked great!  I have learned through the years that I don't touch the dough with my hand except to transfer them and roll it.  This prevented me from my warm hands making the dough gluey.  Also this helped to make the cookies flaky.  I could actually see the flaky layers when I bit into the cookies!  YUMMY!

I've been making cream cheese Kolacky over 40 years and this recipe is perfect as is, however I make a much larger batch using a lb. of butter, lb. of cream cheese, 4 cups flour and a couple tsp. of vanilla.  I also make a walnut filling instead of preserves by grinding a lb. of walnuts or pecans and mixing with 1 1/4 cups sugar and two beaten egg whites.  Like another reviewer I also roll them out on a liberal dusting of powdered sugar in lieu of dusting them with it.  It carmelizes the bottom and adds yet another tasty dimension to an already scrumptious cookie.  These proportions make plenty to share for Christmas gifts, but I must warn you-you will be asked to make them every year!!  :)

Jam, preserves, or pie filling won't work as well as a true fruit/nut pastry filling.  Solo brand is excellent and never runs (unless you overfill).  The recipe I use for the dough is 0.5 lb of butter and 0.5 lb of cream cheese with 2 cups of flour.  If the dough is properly chilled, you don't need much extra flour to keep things from sticking.  In years of making these pastries, the dough doesn't seem to suffer from a little extra flour - just don't over work/knead it to start or during the rolling out process.

A super simple, tried and true, crowd-pleasing recipe! This is my go-to, and I've got it down to a science: Make your life simple, like I have... Make the dough ahead of when you wish to bake. I mix up 8x the recipe at one sitting. Cut the butter and cream cheese together with the flour, then mix as little as possible with your hands; due to arthritis, I usually end up just 'knuckling' the dough in the bowl, to bring it all together. Next, form dough into fist-sized rough balls and roll each one between two sheets of wax-paper. Needless to say, Don't chill first! Roll them to the thickness you wish your cookies to be, so you don't have to roll later. Stack the rolled-out balls together on a pan (I use a pizza pan), wrap in plastic wrap and stash in fridge. When ready to make into cookies, remove dough from fridge one 'disk' at a time as you use them. Peel wax paper off one side to loosen, then replace, flip and peel off the other side. I use a pizza-slicer to cut the dough into squares and save the weird end pieces to re-roll when all 'disks' are used up. Put filling into plastic baggie and clip one corner off. Pipe filling in a diagonal onto dough squares, bring up opposite ends and pinch. Transfer to baking sheet and bake as directed. By piping the filling, my fingers stay clean and I am able to control how much filling I wish to use. It's not unusual for me to do a 'line' of cream-cheese filling alongside a fruit filling on the same cookie! Hubby love it and so do I.

I tried this recipe and I put Solo Almond filling instead of preserves. It knocked my husbands socks off.

These are the best Kolacky ever! They are nice and tender and flaky. I have always loved kolacky but I always thought that they'd be too dificult to make. However, I can't believe how easy they are to make! Just 3 ingredients, I can't believe I used to pay so much for only a few at my local bakery. I like to sprinkle them with powdered sugar once cooled and they are just PERFECT!!! I made them for the first time late last night, and they were gone by early morning. I am making them again today, however, this time I am doubling the recipe. Thank you for sharing this recipe with me! I just can't get enough of them!

Wow. I tasted the raw dough & it was not good at all. Put it in the freezer & did not have high hopes for a very good cookie. Let it thaw a little. Decided I was tired so I put powdered sugar in a large baggie, rolled dough into balls, threw them into the sugar, put the balls on a cookie sheet, smashed with my finger, added peach preserves to the middle of the cookie & wallaa  . . . very tasty treat!

This cookie was DIVINE! It defintely needs the sugar or icing or it isn't sweet....... I sprinkled as I've seen some do with granulated sugar before baking.  I used apricot preserves..... this is one of the best cookie recipes I've eaten...... very true to real kolacky...... the results are light and pastry like..... I think you could add a touch of vanilla...... this cookies is best NOT hot right out of the oven..... it is too hot and the buttery smell and flavor are overpowering..... these cookies are best next day or thrououghly cooled..... the cookie softens slightly in storage....

If you have problem with the jam or preserves running out during baking here's a tip.
Place the amount required in a microwave on high allow to "bubble" about 30 seconds or even 60 seconds depending on your microwave.  Careful when removing.  Allow to cool.  This will thicken the jam and helps to prevent leaking.

Thank you for posting this recipe!  I had one that I used for years, and now cannot find.  The dough IS what makes these cookies~it's exceptionally light and melts in your mouth.  The only alteration I made to the recipe (as my original recipe called for) was to roll out the dough in powdered sugar instead of flour, and not dust them after they've cooled.  This just gives the dough a touch of sweetness, but you do need to use the sugar liberally to keep the dough from sticking.  I bake the cookies on a baking stone.  If you do this and don't have a second stone to alternate batches, you'll need to let the stone cool down, otherwise the dough will start to melt as you're placing them onto the stone due to it's high fat content.  Using a cool or cold stone, I bake them for 18 minutes.  Everyone always raves about these cookies!

This recipe seems like its missing something. No offense at all to anyone who posted it. I just found it extremely weird recipe. First of all, the dough has to thaw completely from the refrigerator over night. The "dough" is like a complete butter batter. Its like playing in grease. There is no way to shape them like on the photo. SO I made balls and put jam in them. Also, once they cool, they totally fall apart in your hand becuase its so delicate and the jam is to heavy for it. Most likely WON'T try this recipe again.....sorry....

These are AWESOME. Love this recipe. I doubled it and would recommend that everyone else do the same, at least. Double batch made almost 4 dozen. Not much. I have never made cookies like this before and they turned out awesome. Make sure to roll the dough thin enough or they will be too puffy. And pinch them together really well. Highly recommend the Solo pastry filling, it is delicious and did not run at all. I had no problems with the filling spilling out.

This is the same great cookie my mom made ...well I'm 72 so....many years ago...I have seen another way just recently to make them. Cut in circles, put filling in the center and pinch up 3 corners to make a hat shape make sides on them..or sort of like a triangle with sides.  This seems a good way to solve the the problem of the filling coming out the ends. Make them small though. I'm going to try them this time as"hats" . Great recipe!

I leave the butter and cream cheese out on my counter until they reach room temperature and then mix them up in a bowl with my hands (clean, of course), I then add the flour and also use my hands to blend it in. Instead of flouring my work surface, I use confectoner's sugar. I also add it to the dough if it is too sticky. Instead of cutting squares or rectangles, I use a round cookie cutter (an upside down cup or glass works well too) and spread the filling along the middle (the invisible diameter line) then bring both sides to the center to meet. It is not quite the tradional shape but it is very similar and easier to me than trying to cut squares that are all the same size. My favorite filling to use is the Solo brand apricot cake and pastry filling. They have a variety of flavors like strawberry, poppyseed, raspberry, blueberry, and nut fillings. Solo has the perfect consistency for kolacky fillings. After the kolachys cool down I sift confectioner's sugar on top.

I made this recipe and, following an idea I read in the reviews, made a long roll in plastic wrap, put it in the fridge overnight and then sliced it thin (1/8")with a sharp knife.  I tried to shape the roll with squared sides rather than a round roll.  That way it sliced into squares (not perfect, but usable and quick) and I could place the filling diagonally and bring the opposite corners up and pinch together.  Not handling the dough much made it easy to fill and shape for baking.  Tried mincemeat mixed with chopped walnuts as one of the fillings, which turned out to be the most popular.

These are truly delicious.  The dough took time to work with, but it was worth it.  I used apricot and raspberry Solo fillings.  The raspberry ones were better.  I used confectioner's sugar to roll them in instead of flour.  I rolled them into balls and put them in mini muffin tins, then used a slender rolling pin to push them down and make the wells.  Very pretty looking and very tasty!! I'm glad I listened to the tips from previous raters :)!  10 minutes exactly was the perfect cooking time for me.

My late mother made this heavenly cookie for years.  When I looked through mother's cookbook after her passing 15 years ago, I was saddened that I was unable to find the recipe.  This was one of those things mother made from memory, I believe, so I was certain, the recipe was lost to me.  Yesterday, I found your recipe for kolachys, and made a batch.  You can not imagine my delight when I realized this was the exact cookie mother made!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, and bringing back so many happy Christmas memories!  Cheers!

These really were awesome.  I tried different approaches ... I rolled them out really thin, and they were too flaky...when I rolled them thicker they tasted better.  Then with just the last two I made thumprint cookes and that was the best of them all ... I'm sorry I didn't try that at first!  The dough in this recipe is yummy ... very plain but thats because you're supposed to use powdered sugar.  I could see making these using different cut outs and frosting them, too.  A really good base for a lot of ideas...

I just made this recipe and the cookies turned out great.  The kolaches I remember as a kid were the round ones that were more like sweet rolls, but a friend wanted this kind.  I tripled the recipe so the ratio was one 8-ounce cream cheese, 3 sticks of butter (1 1/2 cups) and 3 cups of flour.  I mixed the butter and cream cheese in my Kitchenaid mixer really well, added a tsp. of vanilla, and then added the flour and mixed on slow just until combined.  I divided the dough up into four small disks and refrigerated for a couple of hours.  It was easy to roll out the small amount quickly before it got too sticky.  I rolled them out on a sheet of parchment paper dusted with powdered sugar and a little bit of regular sugar.  Once they were cut I added the filling, then lifted each square off the paper using a long carving knife under two diagonal corners of the square so I could pinch the other corners together.  I used Solo apricot and poppy seed and made my own cream cheese filling.  All of them turned out fantastic!

This is a delicious recipe! I never made kolachy before so I was surprised there was no egg needed for the dough or sugar! I think the ones I rolled out really thin didn't turn out as well as those that I kept a little thicker. I had no trouble with the corners popping open, I put a little water on the two corners I was going to overlap and that seemed to do the trick. I used Smuckers Simply Fruit and it worked well. The ones that leaked out are ones I'm sure I over filled. Just be sure to line the cookie sheet with parchment paper for easy clean up! One last thing about the dough, if you don't have a few hours to let the dough chill in the fridge, pop it in the freezer in about 30 minutes it will be very firm. Just be sure to break off what you need and put the rest in the freezer/fridge. Give these a try!

Excellent cookies--can't believe the dough is only 3 ingredients!  I actually added a little less than 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract when adding in the flour, and still got soft, flaky cookies with a little extra sweetness and flavor.  Took another's advice and used plenty of powdered sugar while rolling out the dough; I also covered my cookie sheets in parchment paper, which is really helpful because the jam often leaks out.  Everybody took one look and thought I'd bought them from a bakery!

The cookies are so good! I've been making these for a few years usually at holiday time. But they are delicous year round. I've used boysenberry, raspberry and apricot jam. All work well. Also I cut mine with a round cookie cutter, fill them with jam and then close them around the edges with a fork....they kind of look like pierogi's. This is how my Poloish friend taught me to make them. Make a large batch, they go fast!

Wonderful cookies, but here are some pointers:  1)  You have to roll the dough out to 1/8" thickness or else the cookie puffs up too much and the seal on the ends will break apart.  2)  The jam/preserves will run, so don't put too much on the dough.

Gotta love this cookie!

Love these...have made them several times.  My entire family loves them.  The dough is a little difficult to handle, and must be done fairly quickly, but so worth it.  Solo fillings are the best to use, and can be bought directly from their website.  I bought 12 cans of different flavors, and it was less expensive than in the store.  Also there are 13 different fruit and nut varieties.  As others, said Solo does not get runny and the flavors are fantastic.

The only reason this recipe gets 3 stars is because I found the dough very difficult to work with.  The taste of the dough was a 5.  I don't know if I did something wrong given it was my first time trying to make Kolacky.  I found the dough very soft and sticky after 5+ hours of refrigeration, it was hard to handle due to the sticky texture.  I used powdered sugar to roll out on, maybe that was my problem.  Had to finally use my dough disk to get the dough rolled out.  My daughter got a little excited about filling them and over filled them.  It was mainly dealing with the dough.  I would appreciate more information on how to do this properly.

These are very light and flaky, unlike most kolacky recipes. Very simple and easy to make. I used Solo pie filling instead of jam because it holds better in the cookie. Great recipe!

I had difficulty keeping the pinched corners together during baking...resulting in a bit of a mess on the cookie sheets.
Maybe I've done something wrong?? Also, I baked them for approx. 14 minutes as they appeared under-cooked. 
Any assistance would be appreciated.

Perfection. I doubled the recipe and filled them with the  cheese filling recipe off this site. I did have to bake them for close to 20 minutes though, not 10-12.

I am so happy I found this recipe! My mom used to make these when I was little and I loved them, but could never remember what they were called. They taste just as wonderful as I remember. I filled them with homeade apple butter and rolled in powdered sugar like another user suggested. My only complaint is that I only got one cookie sheet worth of kolacky! I will automatically double the recipe next time because they are going fast. Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe for Christmas because I wanted to use one that was easier than the one I always use. With only 3 ingredients for dough, I loved it! Very fast, easy, and the taste was just as good as my other recipe that called for 7 ingredients and much more work. Delicious!! Flour board heavily when rolling out .  Make sure you pinch center really good.  I baked about 18-20 min.

These are bland to me.  I've had much better, and I've made much better.  Would not make these again, was expecting them to taste wonderful but they taste barely good.  I am an excellent baker and have much experience, do not waste your time or ingredients on these.

I really wish I could give this more stars! My grandmother used to make these for Thanksgiving and Christmas. you can't get better than this.  We never used jam, we use solo canned fruits and nuts filling. Apricot, poppy seed, mixed nut, cherry, even pineapple is delicious.

Filled with homemade apricot jam.

These are my favorites, I have always loved them and this is the best recipe. I know the dough is a bit hard to work with but they are worth it and putting them in the fridge for a few in between rollings helps.

.5 cup of cream cheese, butter, and 2 cups flour was perfect ratio. I also added a couple tsps of vanilla extract. Along with .25 cup granulated sugar. 
Then rolled the dough out on confectioner sugar. Pie filler seems to stay in place the best. 
Also for those that cant figure it out. Wet the tips of the dough slightly, where you folds will over lap.

So easy and tasty! The dough turns out light and flaky. They are lightly sweet and delicate. I like them with Solo brand cherry filling, and they do not last long around this house. They are also surprisingly travel-sturdy, so they make great gifts!

Very tender & delicious. I made them into balls & then thumbprinted them instead of rolling them out & only got 12 (large-ish) cookies. If I had made mine smaller, I could maybe get 24 but they would be tiny. I also used powered sugar to roll them in instead of flour.

I have been making these for years, they are my son's favorite cookie.  My Baci made them with solo poppyseed for the filling and I do the same.  They do end up splitting apart, I have tried making a pinwheel from them by rolling out the dough, spreading the filling, rolling up and cutting into slices, sprinkle w/powdered sugar and enjoy!!

Excellent recipe.  Extremely easy to make as it only requires a few ingredients.  I recommend at least doubling the batch, as I did.  I used blueberry pie filling and they were absolutely delicious!  This recipe is a definite keeper and I will be making even more before Christmas as I imagine the ones I made today will not last long.

I made these a little bit differently because I was making quick cookies w/my four year just for something to do on a rainy day. I didn't chill or roll them out, I used a cookie scoop and rolled the balls in vanilla sugar, poked a dimple in them and put the jam in there. Very easy and fast. When I make them again I will use a smaller scoop (the one I used was too big), flatten a little and fold over to make them a little prettier. It will still be fast. The flavor is excellent, and my 4 year old said "These are fantastic". Thanks for the tip about the solo.

I found the dough a little hard to work with, but adding more flour on my work surface helped a lot.  I added a tsp of vanilla as others suggested.  Also used water to help keep ends together.  The parchment paper is a must, the apricot does tend to ooze out of the cookies a little.  My Polish Husband loves them and he had been eating Kolacky all his life.

These were really very good tasting and very simple to make. I am ashamed to admit that I ate 5 before they had even completely cooled!!! I found the dough extremely easy to work with (I refrigerated it overnight) and I used confectioner's sugar to roll it out, as another review suggested. I was careful to measure the squares, and recipe made 26 normal size ones plus 1 huge one that I made as an experiment. Both sizes took about 12 minutes to bake and both tasted great. I placed 3/4 level teaspoon Solo raspberry filling in each normal sized square and had no problem with the filing leaking. I think I am going to double the recipe next time and make all huge ones to cut down on the work some since my husband could pop 2 of the regular sized ones in a single bite.

These were outstanding cookies.  Very easy and delicious.  4 stars because don't even think about cooking these if you don't have parchment paper.  The jelly runs out and sticks horribly to the cookie sheet, you will be scraping for awhile (like me) if you dont use something.  Also to get the corners to stick together you need to wet the corners with water so they seal together or else they come apart.  They are still delicious but not as pretty that way.

This was a staple Christmas cookie for my family, and has been missing from the dessert tray since Mom passed...Until now:)

We use preserves instead of jams, and our cookies are rounds, not folded over like the picture, otherwise they are divine.

We use Apricot, Strawberry, Raspberry, Peach, Lemon(Kurd), and Pineapple preserves for quite an assortment of Kolacky flavors, and from the test batch I made for Thanksgiving, I better triple the recipe for Christmas.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

I liked the flavor of the end result, but it was a lot of work to make this cookie. When I put 1/2t of apricot fruit spread into the middle of the dough per the instructions and baked it, the filling oozed out onto the pan. (I even measured the squares to make sure that they were 2.5 inch x 2.5 inch. I should have used Solo brand fruit filling as some of the reviewers had recommended. When I had used the Solo fruit filling in the past with this recipe, I got better results.

Very good but I had to modify.

After I modified the recipe ingredients according to one reviewers suggestion (1/2 lb cream cheese, 1/2 lb butter, 2 cups flour) and turned the oven down to 350 degrees and lengthened the bake time the recipe was perfect.  Very close to what I remember from my grandmother's Slovak kolaches.

This cookie was so light and flaky. To economize, I used cherry pie filling. I added a cherry to the middle and 5 yr old granddaughter suggested drizzling the filling syrup over it. When they baked, the filling spread well and there was just the right proportion to the filling cookie ratio.

This is the recipe my Mom got from my Dad's Slovakian mom. It was made also by all my Dad's sisters every Christmas. They, like some other, used Solo fillings instead of jams. The best were the poppy seed, apricot and walnut. Delicious cookie, super memories that continue with family traditions even now.

These are my sisters favorite cookie and she loved them so she gives this a 5 star rating, I on the other hand didn't like the dough.  It wasn't sweet enough for me, but when ever my sister wants cookies these will be the ones I make her :)

Tried one batch with apricot jam. Didn't work well at all. Might try the Solo brand if I decide to do that again. Made the rest with Nutella. Yummy! I wish I could figure out how to get the edges to stay together and this recipe would be perfect. Only half of them stay together. I had doubled the recipe and ended up making the last half by cutting out circles and piping the Nutella on top. Will definately make again.

This recipe was super easy to follow and I used almond paste in the middle. My friend Kelly said they reminded her of the ones her grandma use to make. So for my first time making these they turned out awesome.

i had been waiting to try these for a long time! i did exactly as the recipe said, except a little less butter because i didnt have enough! i guess i didnt pinch them enough because they opened up in the oven.  personally, i found the kolacky to be greasy (even with less butter!)i had expected a nice flaky base, whereas it was just a little flaky then greasy! not for me, wont be makin them again.

These cookies were one of six different kinds that I recently made for my twin grandaughters high school graduation party.  Needless to say, they were one of the first to disappear.  Since I made them ahead of time, I put them in the freezer and they did very well.  I didn't sprinkle the powdered sugar over them until they were ready to be served.  I found the dough very easy to work with and I used the Solo apricot and cherry fillings.  This recipe will definitely go in my collection.

Just like my Hungarian grandmother used to make!  She always used Solo Apricot and Prune(Lekvar) rather than jam or preserves as they are quite thick and not apt to run.  She also added sliced almonds to the apricot filling--yum!  
Thanks so much!

I have been searching for this recipes for many, many yrs. They are fantastic and simple to make.

I was given this recipe about 30 yrs ago and it was called something else that I don't remember.
I tucked it away in a cookbook and made them for friends and family. Well, I accidently gave the cookbook away. I am so delighted that someone else loves Kolacky as much as I do!! and I'm Sicilian!!

I have used this recipe for years! I roll into balls and make a well in the middle - like a thumbprint cookie. I let them cool and use a vanilla glaze instead of powdered sugar. They look and taste amazing! I love using seedless raspberry jam.
 
I really don't understand how the dough is hard to work with, if you use the measured amounts given, cream the butter and cream cheese then add flour..it will be crumbly but then you can use your hands to put the dough together, wrap in plastic wrap and set in refrigerator for a couple of hours. It's pretty easy and great for the holidays!

This is similar to my Mother's Slovak recipe. The difference is, we add 2 TBSP sour cream, 1 tsp. of grated lemon peel to the dough. Increase the flour by 1/2 cup. We also roll these out on a 1/2 & 1/2 mixture of powdered sugar and flour to add a bit of crispy sweetness to these. I often eat them as is without dusting them with additional powdered sugar. OH! And one last thing:  We cut in from the points of the squares to make pinwheels and then add a dab of solo apricot or prune lekvar on them.

Absolutely, love this recipe. It was a hit at my church and people asked for the recipe. The only thing I would do different is chill the dough for about 30 min. I initially chilled it for 2 hours, but the butter was too solid at that time and I had to cut the ball in sections to roll it out. Otherwise, I'll be adding this to my Christmas cookies to make.

I happened across this recipe several years ago on allrecipes.com and absolutely loved it. These are some of my very favorite cookies and this recipe is delish. I make them with the traditional raspberry and apricot fillings, but I have also used lemon curd, lime curd, almond paste and my most favorite...Nutella!!! Let me tell you, these cookies are always a big hit, but the Nutella ones are always the most popular :-) Thanks a lot for the great recipe!

These were very similar to my grandmother's recipe which she filled with date filling, apricot filling and raspberry filling. Made these to add to my Christmas cookie platters. cut out tops/bottoms (tops had a star shape cut out of it) and made with raspberry filling for my dad and date filling for my mom. They loved them.

I tried this instead of my yeast recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly (using Solo filling for the jam) except that I found if they baked longer, they were crispier and the bottoms were cooked and insides more flaky. Regarding complaints about the dough: it comes out the frig very hard and the butter makes it stiff. But if you flatten with your hand and roll it on powdered sugar with a little dusting on top, it will roll out thin enough to cut and lift off the counter. I tried waxed paper, but the dough did not roll as easily as on the powdered sugar. I think I will make this recipe my standard.  I made some tiny squares, pinching opposite ends together in the middle.  Those were great!

I've made these for over 20yrs & couldn't find my recipe this year. While it's pretty much committed to memory I needed exact measurements.  This one is close w/the exception of:  salt, grated lemon peel & real vanilla. Not Grandma's added ingredients but mine & they make all the difference. Not that there  is much of a difference but I always use unbleached  flour. I quadrupled this, & baked them in a convection oven at 325 for 15 mins on aire-bake sheet pans.  They melt in your mouth! Be sure to purchase homemade, real preserves for the hard work.  I use cherry, apricot & seedless blackberry. Beautiful, w/sprinkled powdered sugar on my crystal platter.  Merry Christmas & thanks.

The dough had a great flavor and a flakey texture.  I tried some with Solo filling...poppyseed, nut, apricot, prune & cherry fillings...and I tried some with different jams....the Solo worked best, the jams kind of ran out while they were baking.  Very yummy, will make again & again.

Very sticky dough and unfortunately i chose to make them when it was over 100 degrees that day! lol  Eventually gave up on the traditional roll and switched to the 'thumbprint' version. Will definately makes these again. I used 5 different Smuckers Simply Fruits. Thanx for the recipe. :)

My daughter's Girl Scout troop had Poland for a World Thinking Day event and we made these cookies.  They went over very well.  We used raspberry pastry filling and apple pie filling.  They were tasty!  Thanks for an easy, good recipe!

I made these today with baked apple filling...OH so good !!! Tastes like a mini apple pie. Like others have said, you have to double this recipe because you are going to eat all of them when they get out of the oven.

These are great-tasting, but be sure to roll them no more than 1/8".  My first batch may have been just a tiny bit thicker & really puffed up when baking causing the corners to come open.  Thinner is better.  I used apricot preserves that worked very well.  Use a 1/2 tsp. measure so you don't overfill.  Also, I baked the 2nd batch 12 min. which seemed perfect.

These cookies are even better than I remember them being as a child! The recipe is unbelievably easy and the dough is very easy to work with.  To form the cookies, I used a one-inch scoop to scoop out the dough and flattened each cookie with the back of a spoon.   Fill 'em, bake 'em, and make plenty, especially if you have a 14yo boy roaming about! He polished off a dozen of them. Seriously. They are that good!   Enjoy!

Really good. I accidentally froze my dough so I had to defrost it to roll it out and they still came out amazing.

This recipe is exactly like what my mother used to make.  Instead of rolling out the dough, I make them into thumbprint cookies which is so much easier.  I always double the amount because there is no way you can get 60 cookies out of the original recipe.  They are wonderful!

These are some seriously good cookies.  I made a double batch and the family had eaten them all by the next day.  I used apricot jam which was really yummy.  Next time I'm going to try black raspberry.

I chose this recipe because of all the positive reviews.  Unfortunately these cookies didn’t turn out at all.  The cookie never set.  The dough was extremely sticky once I rolled it out. Perhaps I didn’t roll it out thin enough but even 5 additional minutes in the oven didn’t help the texture.  On a positive note, Solo pie filling was excellent. It doesn’t run at all. It was the only good part of cookie. I’ll keep searching another recipe.

OHHHHHH... So Yummy.  I only have two pieces of advice.  First - work with the dough quickly.  I dawdled and had to put it back into the fridge because it warmed and started to stick to everything.  Second - wait a little while before tasting.  : )  The apricot preserves that I used burned my tongue and fingers more than once.  It was too hard to wait!  My sisters and I sat around playing board games and ate an entire double batch.  It was fantastic.  Oh, one more piece of advice.  I would highly recommend doubling the recipe, at least.

these are the kolacky i remember having when i was a little girl. i used a lot of powdered sugar when rolling out the dough, which really helped. i didn't have any problems with the filling leaking (i used preserves), but don't overfill them! a little filling goes a long way. i can't wait to share these with my family tonight.

Crust is very good, though it needs a bit of sugar.be sure to not overfill or filling will leak everywhere. i filled with orange marmalade (which held up well), raspberry preserve (which tends to run), and nutella mixed with chopped almonds. so so good. a dusting of powdered sugar makes them pretty but is not required.

Tasted great but the corners didn't stay together which makes the presentation not as pretty as the photo showed.  Couldn't use them to give as Christmas gifts.

Hi, this is the same as my grandmother's recipe, I find that if you lower the temp to 325 and cook for about 25 min, less chance to burn bottom of the cookies. This happened to me first 3 or 4 batches.  Definitely double the recipe , split in two balls.  Also, I roll out the batter between 2 pieces of plastic wrap, otherwise it will stick to whatever you roll out on.  These are a pain in the  to make, but best thing EVER, I sit and wonder how my 80 yr old grandmother made DOZENS of these every holiday, apricot, nut, poppy!!  So today I'm trying substitute coconut flour. I'll post how it works out!!!

I doubled the recipe and chilled the dough.  Rolled it out and filled with peach jam, looked amazing until it went in the oven.  One big mess.  The cookies spread, very greasy and looked terrible.  I will never make this again.

Suggestions!
After reading many comments, and having never made such a cookie I decided I would share my findings.
1. The dough was hard as butter when I kept it in the fridge for hours so I took many other suggestion and made thumb print instead. Doing this allowed me to cut the ball into small chunks, roll and press with my mini tart press.
2. Roll the balls to press no bigger than a nickel in diameter. Any bigger the dough around edge of pressed portion expands too much and pushes jam around.
3. Press the center portion very thin.
4. I used regular smuckers jam and no issues. I took others suggestion of heating first to make it thinner and helped it expand. I let it cool quite a bit and then put into sandwich bag and cut the tiniest of tip off to pipe in.  I only filled the center about 1/2 or less. If you do too little the dough pushes it out, if you do too much it bubbles out.

With the size I made and double the recipe I found it made nearly 5 dozen. This was very easy and a beautiful result when you sprinkle the powdered sugar. Delicious!

This is the one my grandma and Mom both made, light and melts in your mouth. The dough isn't supposed to be sweet, you get the sweetness from the filling and the powdered sugar. When I make the dough with minimal handling I form a flattened ball between two sheets of wax paper, to prevent sticking lightly dust with flour. Chill minimum two to three hours or maximum two days. When I'm ready to roll out I get fresh wax paper lightly dusty again with flour, wondra works good for this, put dough on dusted wax paper, again light dust the top of the flattened dough ball, another piece of wax paper on top and roll over that, it prevents the dough from sticking to the rolling pin. I just use a small glass or an empty can of baking powder, any thing small and round and cut rounds out, put on ungreased cookie sheet. I then press down on the middle with my thumb and put about a half teaspoon of filling in the center, rolled out to about an eight inch, bake 11 minutes at 350. Solo filling works the best, doesn't puddle. After cooled sprinkle with powdered sugar. This is the right dough recipe. Delicious.

I've been making this for years.  I have to make at least 4 -6 batches.  It is best to do the dough and leave it in the fridge overnight.  I found square cookie cutters on-line for those who measure them you can save time by buying square cookie cutters.  I got them from the Chef's catalog probably 10 years ago.  They are called Ateco Cutters #5253 6 piece set 1 3/8 to 2 5/8 inches.  So maybe people can still get them.  Chef's catalog no longer has them.  But I am sure you might be able to find them on-line somewhere.  I always use the Solo filling.  I am going to try making the thumb print ones to see how they come out and roll out in powdered sugar like others have suggested.  I am making them this weekend and will report back with doing it the thumbprint way and the regular way and using the powdered sugar.  Those who didn't do good the first time try and make them again.  They are so delicious.

Didn't like this recipe.  Kids wouldn't eat it, either.  Flavor was dull at best.  The "flaky crust" was a disaster.  Yep, it's a short, simple recipe...that falls very short of flavor.

The cookies taste great, but as others have experienced, the cookies kept opening up.  Eventually, I just gave up, and used the  make thumbprint style cookies instead.

This is one of the best cookies you will ever taste.  They have just the right amount of sweetness and melt in your mouth.  I use a pastry filling solo brand because the filling doesn't run like with preserves.

Pretty good! Wait until it cools before trying it or you will burn yourself!

Tip...put cream cheese below the apricot for some extra goodness!

While they were very tasty, they were also very crumbly. One or two cookies didn't fall apart when picked up, the rest were a disaster.

Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum!!  These were sooo delicious, I used seedless rasberry Jam, Make sure you chill the dough or it is too hard to work with. I also rolled the dough in powdered sugar instead of flour.    The only problem I had was not making enough, they were gone way too quickly.    Will definitely be making again.

I wanted a classic Kolacky cookies, but it turned out to be my least favorite cookie this holiday season. The dough is very hard to work with, it literally melts in room temperature. Mycorners did not hold together even after very thorough pintching. The cookies needed more time to bake and the flavor was rather bland, even with good preserves, and lots of powder sugar. I will try these again with a bit more flour and maybe adding some sugar to the dough.

My husband and his family are from the heavily Czech-descendant area around Austin & San Antonio TX. I made these for him, hoping he would like them but he only ate about three of them. I thought they weren't nearly as good as the ones the ladies at his mother's church made.

Excellent.  My mother-in-law made these each year.  Rather a bit of work the original way.  Love the short-cut tips, though they do not turn out quite so pretty.  Anyhow, delicious.

I really wanted to like this recipe. I followed the directions to the letter, except I used strawberry preserves and only chilled the dough for 5 hours yet found it to be just OK.  The dough did retain its "cream" color and I would've preferred them to turn out a little more brown.  Without the preserves and confectioner's sugar it isn't particularly sweet and I didn't think it was anything particularly special...sorry!

This is an awesome recipe.  I have not made Kolackys before but have always liked them.  The recipe is easy to follow and the fillings can be alternated.  I made a cheese filling for mine.  I also used fruit preserves with the cheese.  The only thing I did differently was let the dough sit for only 2 hours and the came out great.  I will make these again.

These are very good and worth the time to make them. You can change the filling (assorted jelly or poppyseed)to make a variety which all come out great.

These were great.  I had a little trouble make the squares and some of them looked goofy and leaked...but they were delicious.  One thing I did...I brushed them with egg white before baking (from another recipe).  It made a very delicate crust.

My mother received this recipe decades ago at a Christmas cookie exchange.  It has become a family tradition for 3 generations now.  It is my most requested recipe and I get in trouble if I do not make them at Christmas!  Now I am looking forward to trying some of the other filling suggestions written in this recipe's reviews.

The recipe looked so easy and the picture so yummy I had to give this recipe a try.  I gave it 4 stars only because I made some personal changes.  I don't really like jam or preserves and I didn't have any pie filling on hand, so I prepared the filling for an 8x8 lemon bar recipe (halved it).  I  put the filling in the microwave to thicken it up a bit so it wouldn't run.  Filled the cookies, popped them in the oven and they came out fabulous!  (and I'll admit I didn't have lemon juice - I substituted apricot nectar)  Also, I have no patience and didn't chill the dough.  It was a bit sticky, but not terribly hard to work with.  (Luckily, low humidity today) I probably rolled my dough out a little thicker - ended up with only 20 cookies.  Next time I'll double the recipe.  Oh, and I should add it took nearly 20 minutes to bake.

Excellent flavor dough.  I had a hard time mastering the cutting and filling process so that they did not ooze preserves or pop open in the oven.  However, the pastry part is so good that I will definitely keep trying.

These are awesome.  So easy for how beautiful they come out.  I doubled the recipe and only chilled the dough for about 3 hours and the dough was perfect.  I used raspberry jam and poppyseed filling for them.  They will now be a cookie we make every Christmas.

They were delicious!! The dough was so easy and came out so nice. Pastry part had the nicest tiniest rise and flaky'ness but not too much.  I used filling from bakery and did happy of them apricot and other half of recipe with raspberry. When cutting out the dough i used a 2 3/4 inch circle, snipped a half inch off the tip of the fruit filling pastry bag, and did thick line of filling through center of dough circle,  then folded each of the 2 sides over. They looked beautiful. I was surprised the recipe didn't make more cookies. I doubled the recipe, did the small circles, and the double recipe only made 44 cookies. But they were amazing. Thank you for this recipe.

Same dough is used for Rugelach..  Roll dough into a 9inch round, lightly spread filling of jam and/or finely chopped nuts or chocolate chips.  Press lightly into the dough, cut into 12 wedges and roll each wedge into crescents and bake.

I baked them about 20 minutes: I would recommend this recipe :)

I made these for the first time.  My grandfather used to make them at Christmas.  I made a few changes.  I added 5 oz. cream cheese, 2 Tbls. white cane sugar, and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  This is a pastry so the crust tastes like a pie crust.  The sugar and vanilla helped to sweeten the crust.

I split my dough into 4 balls because I was limited to my roll-out area.  After reading all the reviews I decided to use plastic wrap so I could see the dough thickness as I rolled.  I covered the bottom plastic wrap with powdered sugar.  Added a top piece of plastic wrap then rolled away.

I chose to make circles with a small glass that was about 2-1/2" round.  This gives you more area to squeeze together when you close the pastry.  I had no pastries that came open during the baking period.  Using Solo Cake and Pastry Filling is a must.  It doesn't move during the baking period.  I added a heaping teaspoon to each pastry.  I used apricot.

I baked them on top of parchment paper.  Is there any other way?  They just slide right off.  I dusted them with powdered sugar right out of the oven.

When they were completely cooled I placed them in a plastic zip bag.  I used the nicest ones for cookie trays for my neighbors.  Out of the three different cookies on the trays, they liked this one the best.  Me too!

made for a cookie exchange @ work, had several coworkers  that stated they were better than those sold at a local private bakery.  Another stated they were exactly like the ones her mother had made as long as she could remember before her mother could no longer cook. She stated her mother made the by trays full. I used peach preserves as the filling. I did as someone else suggested and rolled the dough between parchment paper then chilled for couple hours before assembling. A pizza cutter and a floured ruler made cutting very easy. The dough softens quickly so I used a thin spatula to move onto cookie sheet so as to maintain the shape.  they cooled quickly outside in chilly Dec air. Sprinkled w/ powdered sugar, was a perfect bit of sweetness. I was even ask to make more and was offered to be paid for them. Yum, will try with ground walnut past the next time.

Grew up with these gems but always felt intimidated by trying to make them.  It’s a ten star in my book. Easy easy recipe delicious flavor !! The cookie itself has a creamy buttery flavor omg. Chilling dough for a few hours until firm plenty enough time- I did overnight and dough was too firm to easily roll- had to let it warm up a bit but works either way.Many bakers probably know that the cream cheese makes this dough puff up -so error rolling thin than thick...use a knife to spread filling from corner to corner (I overfilled trying to spoon on) not critical but won’t waste and will have a perfect amount of filling-also use “pastry filling” flavor of your choice rather than jam it has a better consistency it’s firmer/thicker and won’t be runny, absolutely quadruple this recipe! Mmmmm...Can’t say enough -my new favorite.

They are delicious!  My only disappointment is that I can’t get them to keep their pretty shape.  I tried to wet the dough with some water as I pinched them closed.  I put them in the freezer for 5 minutes hoping that would work but they unfold shortly after going in the oven.  I still will make them, I have more nutter and cream cheese softening for more cookies.  Can anyone pass on their tricks so my cookies look as good as they taste?

I made the recipe exactly as written.  I chilled the dough overnight, and usesd Private Selection Triple Berry filling.  Unfortunately, the dough didn't have enough structure and the cookies look sloppy and unattractive.  They also needed several more minutes baking time for me.  I'm attributing this to baker error.

I believe the amount of cream cheese for this recipe is incorrect.  I have been making these for years and it takes no less than 8 ounces of softened cream cheese.    I think there is an error in the recipe ingredients - the cookie dough should not be greasy but it should be a slightly stiff dough.

I use my mom’s Polish recipe but  all recipes are basic with three ingredients. One thing I tried, as mine would almost always open up..put a dab of milk from your finger and then fold over the other flap. And I use a round flower scallop shape cookie cutter instead of square shape...there is more dough to hold together when folded  and they are really pretty with the scallop edge.  Tip: Add a pinch of cornstarch to your jar preserves or tapioca..it will stop the run out of the cookie. I haven’t started Christmas baking until next week so will try to repost with photo.

I just made these and for all the hard work it took and a big mess I have pretty but tasteless cookies to show for it. There is no flavor in the dough, I will try it again and add some sugar and vanilla to the dough and filling. You need something more to the filling then just jam, or it tastes like you wiped some jelly on pie crust.

I've been looking  for a kolachy recipe like my mother-in-law used to make. Based on the reviews I tried this one today.  Excellent recipe.  I chilled it for about 3 hours and it was a little too hard to roll but after it warmed a bit it rolled out beautifully.  I followed the suggestion of another baker and rolled it on a well floured surface.  I tried two different fillings - a Solo apricot filling and a mixture of chopped walnuts mixed with cinnamon,  sugar and enough honey to hold the nuts together. I put a small dab of water on one corner to be sure the corners would hold together while baking.  I had to bake them for 18 minutes.  For my Christmas cookie tray I will cut 2 inch squares and roll them thinner than the recommended ? inch (personal preference).  This is the recipe I have been looking for!  Light, flaky, delicious - and extremely easy.

ANNOUNCEMENT: Everyone should know that you do NOT thaw the dough. This will cause it to be impossible to work with. People are complaining about this recipe for this reason, which is easily fixed with this information. I will add a photo of properly made Czechoslovakian Kolache cookies later :D. I hope I saved some cookies.

This is the first time  I have ever made this type of cookie. It doesn't state in the recipe to let the dough come back to room temp before being able to roll it out. I have a few recipes in which you take the dough directly out of fridge and proceed from there. So make sure you allow enough time to let it warm up. With that being said, I will definitely make these again.Family thought they were fabulous. used apricot pastry filling . no leakage. time consuming but well worth it. Thanks for the recipe!

This is how my Mom made Kolacky and we continue to make them every year at Christmas, with the Grandkids helping. Solo fruit filling is needed to avoid leaking jam.

Wonderful!  Just like my friend's parents used to make.  For those who complained...you do NOT put the dough in the FREEZER!!  It compromises the dough. Refrigeration for a few hours is what is needed.

This was just ok.  The dough tasted too much like pie crust. Had no sweetness to it at all. Not sure I will make this one again or not.

This is a great recipe, the pastry is flaky and wonderful. No pictures since they disappeared so quickly. I roll them in powdered sugar instead of  flour  and it caramelizes on the bottom during baking. I also read a tip to roll the dough out between plastic wrap when warm and then chill to cut out and this worked wonderfully. Will definately make more!

I found the dough way too soft. It also made a small amount of cookies (2 doz). I refrigerated the dough for several days, then it was too hard, so when softened in the microwave it became too soft again. Not much taste to the dough.

Exactly the recipe grandma from Poland used. Here's the best secret too me years to get from her......when rolling out your dough DON'T USE FLOUR, use powder sugar....seriously try it. I don't think you'd be disappointed

I followed another's suggestion and added 1 t of vanilla and added 2T powder sugar...and when i rolled out the dough I rolled them out in powder sugar...and before baking I sprinkled the tops with granulated sugar...I filled mine with apricot pie filling...these are delicious...and it is not a huge recipe...takes 5 minutes or less for the dough...I then split the dough in half and put in the freezer for 30 minutes...very easy to handle

This dough puffs up too much to make as pictured.   Also, the dough didn't taste all that great- kinda like a saltine.

Very Good Kolacky! Not terribly hard to make- I followed comments and used Solo filling. Also I tried several different methods to cut the dough, and went back to the original cutting circles, I found to be the best. I chilled the dough for 15 minutes. It was very workable. They came out good but were even better the next morning!

Absolutely incredible!   I made it exactly as stated. For the filling I used Solo brand pie filling the apricot and raspberry. I doubled the recipe and next time I will triple it. I ended up making a second batch because the first batch turned out so wonderful. I will definitely be making these again.

I made these for my son's birthday party and he went crazy for them. I am going to make another batch for the holidays! I followed the directions and added a drop of vanilla to the dough which gave a nice light flavor. They are definitely a crowd pleaser.

Almost as good as the ones my Mom and Grandma made!  Be sure to use Solo filling other wise it flows all over the baking pan.  I had to cook mine longer than listed but that could be my oven's problem.  I'm going to try making the dough balls that you indent with your thumb to spoon the filling in to.  Sounds much easier than rolling and cutting.  I made them for my 92 year old Mom and she loved them, so I claim it as a success!

We thought these were awfully good and I will make them again.  I used raspberry for half and apricot for half.  They are kind of like eating a little fruit pie.  It is an easy crust to mix, roll and handle and I think it would be just as good if it was made with a gluten free flour.

The dough was very easy to make, I had little bit of trouble folding up the corners though. It kept wanting to crumble for that part. I used Palmers spreadable fruit and it worked perfectly. The tiny bit that did spill out spilled onto the silicone baking mat so it just wiped off. I love how flaky the cookie part is! Tastes super good! It is a really nice change from all of the super sweet stuff I've been making lately.

The cookies came out delicious; however they were not all that pretty. I assume I did not roll the dough thin enough or seal well enough. I used smuckers strawberry preserves, cut 3 in circles and measured 1/2 tsp per cookie. I had little run off during cooking.

I'm just guessing so far...I thought I'd like to try a mixture of  marmalade/orange liqueur and/or zest and dark chocolate, maybe ground pecans or almonds...but I can't find where to make notes anymore, though, so  I'm noting it here for now...

The easiest dough, and they taste amazing!  Just like my husband's Mom used to make! :)  Definitely double the recipe or more, and get a variety of Solo Fruit or Nut Fillings to make an amazing holiday cookie platter!  (Don't skimp on the powdered sugar to dust over them after they've cooled, either!)

I made no changes; the recipe is perfect. I did get one interesting suggestion from a friend that I use- when rolling out the dough, roll it on powered sugar instead of flour. This is so that when you fold over the corners they'll stay folded instead of coming open and laying flat when baking. I've made them several times, and they're always perfect. I also double the recipe, because my family wolfs them down so fast. Please try it and enjoy!

My mother made these with sweetened ground nut filling.  She chilled the dough as much as needed and rolled it out in regular sugar.  She made "nut horns" by spreading nut filling (ground nuts, sugar, egg, milk as needed) on the dough and rolled a few inches at a time, cutting into 4" long rolls, and curving them into horseshoe shape.  Delicious.

This is a great simple recipe!  I tripled the ingredients and made these last  Xmas for our family party, they were a real hit!  Not too sweet, so light and airy.  I am making them again this year and quadrupling the recipe lol

My former recipe for this dough  called for "creamed cottage cheese"... Nowadays, 4% milk fat. It has served me well for 45 years. It wasn't nearly as difficult to work with as  the other pastry recipes I had, but in perusing cream cheese recipes I found the common link to be "easy, forgiving, less messy" etc.   This was the one I chose to try and it's now my new go-to apricot roll dough........it is, truly, easy to mix, easy to shape, faster, delicious, and on and on. Thank you a thousand times

I love this recipe, too!  The only change I made to it is I add 1 tsp of vanilla to the dough, + two tablespoons of powdered sugar to the dough.... and it takes away any dough-blandness!  My family noticed the difference when I did, as well!  LOVED it!
Also, I don't have a lot of time to chill dough and roll it, so I went the route of immediately rolling the dough into small walnut-sized balls, pushing a thumbprint into it and filling wit the preserves.  Easy-peasy and just as delicious!

I have been making these for at least 50 years. Now my granddaughters make them. One difference: I roll them out with powdered sugar NOT flour.

Followed the directions exactly but they still kept sticking to the bottom of the pan and the jam simmered right out of the kolackys but they were still ok

I enjoyed this recipe but it is a bit bland. Mine needed lots of extra time in the oven. They were good I just wouldn't make them again.

This was my first try, I followed every detailed on this recipe, but it had to add an e tea 6 mins at 375 degrees on my gas stove. My husband taste tested it and said it was pretty good.

I liked these quite a bit.  I'd never heard of them before so I don't know how they are supposed to taste or look and after I made them I said, huh, I don't know if they were worth the work.  But then my little family gobbled them down super fast (myself included) so there is something really delicious about them.  I put homemade strawberry jam on them.  They looked quite adorable, fancy enough to take as dainties.  I would make them again.

It was ok but I personally didn't like it as much as my guests and neighbors. I did prefer the walnut filling I used on another recipe off AR.

Cut mine into circles with a cup and then used my thumb to make a dip for blueberry preserves.  They were delicious.  Tastes a lot like my grandma made them.

Didn't work at all :-( the pinched sides didn't stay together and the jelly I used ran all over the place. Flavor was nice - maybe I'll have to tweak it some more.

I've made these a couple times and they go over well.  Flavor is good and they aren't overly sweet.
It is a little frustrating that they don't stay closed up.  Last time I used another reviewers suggestion to cut circles and drop them in a mini muffin pan - they cook well and come out looking cute and almost like flowers, but you have to be very careful not to use too much jam or the overflow and make a mess.

These are REALLY tasty but a bit tricky to get into proper form. I would highly recommend using flour to roll, as the recipe suggests, rather than the confectioner's sugar. I started that way and it was just too sticky. I also had trouble with the ends coming apart. Be sure to get the dough nice and thin!

I make these cookie all the time. But I roll these in powder sugar which gives a little sugar they are perfect.

I did not think these cookies were all that great.  I made them as directed, and baked them as directed...they were not very flavorful, and needed to be left in the oven for longer.  My husband liked them, but I will not be making them again=(

I had a lot of trouble getting them to be the right shape, and they popped open in the oven. The taste of the dough is pretty bland and flour-y. This was a waste of some high-end butter!
