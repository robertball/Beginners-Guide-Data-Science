I made a few changes to this after reading some of the reviews.  I used taco seasoning instead of chili powder, and a can of diced tomatoes with mild chiles, added 1 cup of water and a couple dollops of sour cream to the hamburger mixture.  I left the last layer of chips and cheese off and baked it covered for 25 minutes, then I added the cheese and chips and baked it uncovered for 10 minutes.  It turned out very good and tasted like nachos.  I also chose not to crush the tortilla chips but I think it's just a personal preference. My family loved it and went back for seconds.  I'm adding this one to my recipes.

I really liked this recipe, you can make changes and adjustments and it turns out delicious. Instead of using mayo, salsa, and chili powder I used a packet of taco seasoning mix to the ground beef ( I used 2 lbs. of ground beef). Then I layered the ground beef, crushed tortilla chips, and I added a layer of refried beans and then the cheeses. I used a foil lined 9 by 13 inch baking dish. I baked it for about 15 minutes and then before serving I topped with sour cream, diced tomato and shredded lettuce.

I have been making this recipe for years!  I found it in a Taste of Home Annual Cookbook, 1997 I think.  I usually saute onion with my ground beef and add extra salsa as it seems a little dry.  It is a favorite with my children!  We serve it with sour cream, salsa and additional chips.  It is a good, quick and tasty meal.  ENJOY!

I really loved this recipe! It was simple and delicious, although I was originally skeptical of the mayo, it blends nicely with the salsa! I added kidney beans to the beef mixture, and as suggested used taco seasoning instead of chilli powder, and this is a definite keeper, and sooooo filling! yum! and thanks!!

I made this for supper tonight and my kids loved it!  It was very simple and didn't take much time at all to prepare.  I didn't add the mayo, chili powder, or the salsa to the meat.  I used taco seasoning and mixed 1-1/12 cups of sour cream to the meat after the seasoning was cooked in as directed on the package and layered but I too did not measure any of the chips or cheese but I did use 2-8oz bags of Colby-Jack cheese.  I changed the serving size to 10 just so the ingredients would be a little more accurate because I also used a 9x13 glass cake pan.  I cooked mine at 350 degrees for 15-18 minutes (just until the cheese started to brown) and let it set for 5 minutes and cut it into serving size pieces.  After I put each piece on the plates, I topped with lettuce, tomato, black olives, sour cream, crushed tortilla chips, and salsa.  This is very, very filling and very good!  I highly recommend this recipe!

We loved this dinner - my kids thought it was like a Nacho Salad....I thought the chips would be soggy, but they weren't.  Use the taco seasoning it works well.  The kids and I say is delicious an Excellent meal (very filling)!!!

Wow - This was delicious!!  While browning the meat I added onion powder.  I was unsure if I should use real mayo or Miracle Whip, I chose to use real mayo and I am glad I did!  I added an extra 1/2 cup of salsa (total 1 and 1/2 cups) and a package of taco seasoning to the meat mixture.  (I used the taco season and still added the chili powder, mayo and salsa.)  I served this with spanish rice and refried beans.  My husband and both of my VERY PICKY kids liked this.  Taco Casserole will be a regular in our house!!!

I omit the mayonnaise and add instead a cup of sour cream.  I also add chili beans and a packet of taco seasoning instead of the chili powder.  I like adding sliced green onions too before I cook it.

Good basic recipes.  I did dress it up with extra salsa, sourcream, olives and onions on top and it was great. Wish I had some left over. Next time I'll add black beans to the bottom layers.  Guests commented that it was like a warm 7-layer bean dip. Overall response was good.

I must say for such simple ingredients this was very good.  Don't expect some spicy,gourmet dish.  This is just basic food that my whole family loved.  Like a taco you could eat with a fork.  I used mayo, not salad dressing.  I also used a chili seasoning combination product instead of just plain chili powder.  I had some black olives on the side as not everyone likes those.  It is truly comfort food.

I love this recipe. It was a big hit and easy to make. I did add taco seasoning to the ground beef, and cut the salsa and chili seasoning a bit because of that. I also used a pre-packaged Mexican cheese blend.

I changed the chips to rice and only did one layer of each.  My kids love this, it's easy and was a big hit for the new moms I made it for.

this was simply amazing. I added a can of salt free corn to my ground beef and mayo mixture and it turned out very very delicious! & for the salsa I added a smoky black bean salsa and it gave my casserole a little kick :) I also made my own tortilla chips out of some  7 grain flour tortillas that I had that were about to expire..YUMMO I will be making this again for sure!

This was a great recipe. I did not have "chips" on hand so I used wheat torillas. It was fabulous. I did prepare the meat with taco seasoning, used sour cream instead of mayo and added salsa and refried beans to the layers.  My kids, 3 and 6 LOVED it! Highly recommend. Super tasty!!

This one was rated "absolutely fantastic" by my 6 and 8 year old children. I just used a taco seasoning packet with the ground beef instead of the salsa etc. because my children wouldn't have liked the salsa. I may try it that way next time. But it was great, and all kids (ages 1-8) loved it!

This was very good, my husband and I both loved it.  I think next time I will skip the chili powder since it was a little spicy for my toddler.  Thank you for sharing.

My family and I really enjoyed this dish. I did as others suggested and substituted sour cream for the mayo and taco seasoning for the chili powder. I also added black beans to the meat mixture. This is such an easy dish that feeds my family of 5! Thank you for the recipe.

My 6 kids BEGGED for this recipe!  I usually doubled it.  The only thing I did differently was to serve the lettuce and tomato separately so any leftovers could be easily reheated.  Now that they are grown, they still use this recipe.

Tastes good.  I used chicken from a can instead of ground beef, and taco seasoning instead of the chili powder and mayo. Super easy and tasty that worked well for our family. Thank you!

I made the recipe as written.  We loved it!  Our five year old thought it was yummy.  If it were just the two of us I'd use a hot/spicy salsa.  My husband does like a little spicy kick to food.  So he added hot sauce to his dish but agreed that it was good as is.

OUTSTANDING!  I followed the recipe exactly and added a few things........a small can of green chiles, garlic powder and seasoned salt to the meat mixture.  I also used HOT picante sauce to give it some kick.  This is definitely something I'll be making in the future!

Awesome!  Wat I love about it is if you want to substitute something or change it just a little, it is still great.  I added 2 fresh diced jalapenos, 1 can of pinto beans, half a can of Hormel Homestyle chili, half a chopped yellow onion, and  2 cloves of garlic to my meat mixture.  I didn't have any tortilla chips so i toasted some strips of flour tourtillas and it was still good.  even better the next day!

I used the taco seasoning & sour cream method as another member had recommended.  Did not layer the chips as I like mine to be crispy.  Layered refried beans in the bottom, meat mixture & then cheese.  Served with tortilla chips, salsa, & extra sour cream.  My finicky eaters all enjoyed this dish.  I will be using it again!

Delicious and extremely filling.  I did add the last layer of cheese when there were just 10 mins of baking time left out of fear that the cheese would have browned too much if I'd added it earlier. A simple dish that I now often crave.

This was quick and VERY tasty! I did as other reviewers said and used a package of taco seasoning. Also, I used rotel instead of chopped tomato. Added chopped onion, hot sauce and cilantro. YUM!!

This was good....I wasn't a hug fan but it is a nice twist to your taco dinners...casserole style.   A plus is that it was easy to make and again - ingred. you seem to have on hand.  You might want to double the recipe if cooking for a large family or big eaters b/c we didn't have any left.

This is good.  I sauteed one onion in a little oil, then browned lean diet beef in the onion, drained oil, added 1 taco seasoning packet and water.  Then I added the mayo tasted it and added chile powder and adobo to taste.  I added layers of refried beans and of a mixture of 1/2 pack cream cheese and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I used only 1 cup of grated cheese.  I did not put the lettuce and tomatoes in the casserole, but put them on the side so that I could reheat it easily.  I also served it with the "Asparagus Guacamole" recipe from this website.  Great easy meal!

Rarely does anything go to waste in our house but this one did.  I used sour cream too instad of the mayo. My husband is not a fussy eater and he barely touched it.  It didn't hold together either so I served it sccoped into a bowl.  I really wanted to like this recipe but I won't even bother trying to tweek it.

Personally I thought this tasted fantastic, was priced right and was really easy to make.  Unfortunately I didn't have a 2 quart casserole dish so instead of layering I did one big layer in a 3 quart but it was great - I did not crush my tortilla chips, they soften up enough while cooking to cut with a fork anyway.  You do not need to brown your meat with anything because the salsa will add your onion and other flavors.  I did add a dollop of sour cream to the finished product because the recipe was so affordable anyway I figured why not.  I will make this again.

Was only cooking for 1 1/2, so I made it with only one layer and cheddar cheese (and miracle whip instead of mayonnaise).  Also, no lettuce.  Either way, gave me a great start and ended up tasting great.  Thanks!

I made this according to the directions except I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin to the chili powder.  It was easy and the meat mixture tasted good.  However, baking the casserole made it horribly dry and made the chips taste stale (and no, they weren't stale to begin with).  Even the cheese was dry after baking.

Our chips didn't stay crispy at all. Made it as shown except I used taco seasoning instead of chili powder and a Mexican cheese blend instead of the Colby-Jack listed. It was good, but it's not going to become a standby.

Excellent taste.  First time I followed the recipe exactly using mayonnaise.  The second time I added Rotel original and used taco seasoning packets instead of chili powder.  Yummy both times.  Thanks for the recipe Flo

I am notorious in my household for NOT being a good cook - my stepson cringes when he knows I'll be making dinner, so he approaches anything new I make with skepticism.  (It's warranted - I'm challenged in the kitchen.)  This recipe was easy and everyone loved it.  The only adjustments I made were replacing the chili powder with taco seasoning, and I added a can of mild green chiles to the ground beef.  I left everything else the same and it came out great.  Quick, easy, and tasty.  Thanks for this new addition to the short list of meals I'm "allowed" to make for my family!  :-)

I love this recipe, but as with other reviewers I made some changes for my personal tastes!  I took out the mayo and used more salsa, and used taco seasoning instead of just using chili powder.  Then I topped it with sliced black olives in addition to lettuce and tomatoes.  YUM!!

Great recipe! Thanks! I added some Old Bay Garlic and Herb Seasoning to the mixture. Instead of putting the cheese on top right away, we put the cheese on for the last few minutes and let it melt, then take it out.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made several changes based on other's reviews.  Subbed ground turkey for beef, sour cream instead of mayo, and Fritos for tortilla chips.  Added a packet of taco seasoning at the end of the browning process then added a drained can of black beans and a 4 oz can of diced chiles to the meat.  DH had many helpings.

I followed the recommendations to use taco seasoning and sour cream instead of mayo.  I did not add water either.  I put the top layer of chips and cheese on the last 6 or 7 minutes as was recommended.  I wish I'd stayed with fresh tomatoes, even so it was a great dish and easy to make.  My husband was insistant that this was a do again.  This recipe will be a regular in our house!

Sorry, this was gross. My instincts told me that the mayo was an odd ingredient but I used it anyway, and I think that's what ruined it. I can't remember the last time I actually threw food away, but had to this time. Maybe w/sour cream instead of mayo it's ok?

This was pretty good, and really easy. I didn't have any taco seasoning, like others had mentioned using, but I had all the spices for it - chili powder, cumin, paprika, onion and garlic powders, and cayenne, so I mixed those together to make my own "taco seasoning", and it worked. I didn't use quite as much mayo, about 3/4 cup, but followed the recipe other than those things. I could see it being kind of bland if you didn't add the spices, but my Hubby really liked it the way I made it, my four year old did too. Will probably make again, either the same way, or with a taco seasoning packet (just to see if there's a difference).

Only made one change and seasoned the meat with our favorite taco seasoning packet.  Got 2 thumbs up from my picky boyfriend.  Definitely adding to the rotation!

This was good and got some "this tastes great!" comments.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, used a taco seasoning pack instead of the other seasonings.  I did not put the crushed chips into it, easier left overs and you'll always have crunchy chips.  This was easy and great.  Can make the night before and put in the oven or crock pot the next day!

My family loves this recipe, and we eat it often.  I make a few small changes: I don't use chili powder or mayonnaise, instead I season the meat with a pkg of taco seasoning and 1 cup of water.  Then I add two dollops of sour cream to the meat mixture and otherwise make as directed.  Wonderful!!

Wasn't a hit with the family and was a little bland.  I went with the original recipe and if I make it again, I'll adjust as some have recommended.

This was great!!!! I was looking for something quick and easy as an alternative to tacos, enchiladas and nachos.  This was incredibly easy and the only tweak I made was to increase the salsa by a 1/3 cup.  My husband, who always has something to say, couldnt say anything because he was having seconds!

My husband liked it so much he went for thirds!

Instead of chili powder I used Mexican seasoning.  One little tip:  At the store you can get a package of shredded Monterey/Colby cheese that's about 2 cups if you want to mix the two kinds together.

Easy to make. I was out of ground beef, but used thin sliced steak. Ranch to replace the mayo, and "hot" salsa made for great flavor. Will be making again!

I was dissapointed because this really wasn't good at all :(  The recipe sounded good and was super easy so I had high hopes for it but definitely was let down!  My boyfriend and kids wouldn't eat any of it after tasting it and I had to doctor mine up with lots of lettuce, salsa and sour cream to make it where I could finish mine, but still wasn't good.

was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this dish; preparing it was extremely simple and I loved that I can use a pre-opened, almost stale bag of tortilla chips and a half-gone jar of salsa.  I usually have all of these ingredients on hand, and it is a great meal for friends who are moving, or just had a baby.  Simple ingredients, good flavor, easy prep.  Hard to ask for much more.

I would recomend this to anyone who has children that love taco night. Not only is this easy, but my kids loved it. I used salad dressing, which added a different kind of zeztiness to the meal.

Like most of the other reviewers, I used taco seasoning (about 1/2 packet) instead of chili powder. My very picky husband devoured this dish. It is his new favorite meal. I double the recipe so there will be leftovers to take to work the next day. If you serve the lettuce and tomato on the side it heats up nicely. Very good and very simple to make.

AMAZING!! and VERY easy! My husband and I loved it! I did add mushrooms, onion and pepper to my beef mixture. I used taco seasoning from a taco kit and it was fine. Don't forget the lettuce and tomatoes on top!! I can't wait to make it again :)

This is a winner!!!  Made a huge quantity (thanks to the ease of allrecipes) and made it for a church group coming into our camp.  The kids and adults enjoyed it.  It will be on the menu for more groups.

I made this for a family reunion and it turned out AMAZING. It was the only dish that was completely gone by the end of the day. I didnt use lettuce or tomatoes and used taco blend cheese. didnt measure out the chips or cheese but used ALOT of cheese. It was SOO good I got so many compliments!!

I use the box taco dinner.  Almost everything you need is in there.  I started making this dish when my husband complained about all the work that goes into taco night.  Eating tacos this way is so much easier and I love the flavor the mayo adds.

I usually love Mexican type food, but I just couldn't get into this. It was really dry, and I just didn't go for the whole mayo/salsa thing. I really wanted to like this. Thanks anyway.

Really oily and not to our taste, we were sad to waste the taco stuff.  Made for friends who normally will compliment the chef, but not this one!

EXCELLENT...the only substitution I made was taco seasoning in place of chili powder. (just cause that's what I had) The whole family loved it. *even the 2 year old!*

After reading the other reviews, I made a few changes.  I had leftover taco meat so I used that and eliminated the salsa, mayo and chili powder.  I substituted corn chips for tortilla chips.  I used cheddar cheese because I didn't have the others.  I added diced green chilies, black beans, refried beans and taco sauce.  I also add the last layer of chips and cheese at the end.  If you left out the chips, this would make a great chip dip.  It was a big hit with my family.

This was pretty good.  I made a few adjustments based on other reviews and thought of some others that I'll probably do if I make it again.  I added homemade refried beans (the ones in the can remind me of dog food!), I used my usual taco seasoning instead of chili powder, and used sour cream instead of mayo.  All in all, the ratio of chips to other stuff was a little off, I think.  It seemed really "chip-y" to me.  Maybe next time, I'll put in more meat and beans.  It had a great flavor, though and was super easy.  I will probably use it as a jumping off point again.  Thanks!

Just made this for dinner tonight. It's pretty good.  I added in a little taco seasoning, and dressed it with a little taco sauce and it turned out good.  Definitely worth a try if you like Tacos!

The only thing that I changed with this recipe is instead of using chili poweder I used dry taco seasoning.  I would not make it again.  It was edible but not something that I would crave and want again.

This is an easy, fast casserole perfect for a weeknight family meal.  I did use a package of taco seasoning and 1/4c water instead of the mayo/chili combo and it came out just perfect. Thanks for sharing

This one was a winner with my family. I had to make one change. I have one son who won't eat anything with chunky tomatoes, peppers or onions in it, so I substituted a cup of mild taco sauce for the salsa. I did use taco seasoning, as others suggested, in place of the chili powder. We all liked it a lot and it will become a repeat around here. I'm always looking for a dish we can all enjoy without my having to prepare more than one entree for dinner to satisfy everyone.

l just made this dish today for dinner and it was a big hit. my family loved it.
l used taco seasoning instead of chili and instead of layering everything, l just mixed it all together and sprinklt some of the cheese on top. the lettuce and tomatoes l left it as a side dish.

I loved this!  It's quick and easy. But you MUST season the meat well. Many used taco seasoning. I used a pack of Goya seasoning, and added Adobo as well as a bit of garlic and onion powder.  The rest is great...Yummy!

Excellent. I used taco seasoning (no chili  pwdr) and about 1/2 cup water then followed all the directions. I did follow a review that left off the top cheese and chips until the last 10 mins and it worked great.  My 3yr old said that "it's a keeper, mom"

This is a great quick and easy meal! My 1 and 2 year olds loved it...so did my husband. I added green peppers and onions to the meat. I also did as others suggested and used taco seasoning instead of chili powder. I topped it off with sour cream and no one could get enough. Thanks-will use this one again for sure.

This is so tasty! After reading all the reviews, I decided to tweak a little and it was delicious. I added taco seasoning to the beef as suggested by some. I also cut down the chili powder to 1 teaspoon because that was all I had left. It was spicy with just a bit of tang. I used an extra half cup of salsa and it was not dry at all. I didn't have the cheeses specifed so I used Mexican cheese blend.  My husband has requested it again already so this is definitely going in my file. The only other suggesion I have is that unless your group is light eaters, you may want to add a side to this such as spanish rice, corn or garlic mashed.

Pretty good.  Used taco seasoning like someone else suggested instead of the mayo.  Threw a little salsa in, some refried beans, and green onions.  I found it pretty crumbly, need to find a way to keep it together better.

This was not very good, however I think it's because I used salad dressing as the recipe called for.  IF I make this again I'll use sour cream in the mixture instead.  Kids enjoyed it, however.

Very good and super and quick easy to make.  My husband enjoyed it, as well.  Great dish to make with the kids if you have some little cooks in your home.

This casserole was GOOD and EASY!!!  We loved it!  I did not top it with lettuce or tomatoes, but wish I did.  We did put a dollop of sour cream on top, though.  I was worried it wouldn't "hold" together, but it did beautifully.  Definitely a keeper!!

Great flavor and easy to make.  I add refried beans to the bottom and black beans to the meat, also will use ground turkey if I don't have hamburger.

I used this recipe exactly as stated, only I also added onion, green pepper and taco seasoning to the ground beef.  Definitely a new favorite! SO GOOD! Wonderful, thanks for the recipe, I can't stop eating it.

Made this for dinner last night. Used taco seasoning per package directions instead of chili powder and extra salsa instead of mayo. Topped with sour cream when serving. It was great! My husband went back for seconds, and he always teases that I can't cook! =)

I was disappointed with this recipe. I followed the directions but maybe I missed something. Thought the texture was kinda dry and didn't enjoy the mayo flavoring. I was suprised it got so many good reviews.

It's a winner, even with the kids! I cooked the meat with red onions and fresh garlic.  Next time I might try plain yogurt instead of mayo for a healthier choice.  Served it with a side of pinto beans and avacado.  YUM!!

A great weeknight "quickie" recipe. I used a packet of taco seasoning and the water, along with a 1/2 cup (ok, really two big dollops) of mayo, er, salad dressing (aka -- miracle whip). I also added a can of pinto beans to the meat mixture as it was cooking. Finally, I only had shredded sharp cheddar on hand, so I used that instead of a combo of cheeses -- still yummy!

Great comfort food.  Followed recipe exactly but did add a dollop of sour cream with chopped black olives on top of lettuce.  I will make this again.  Thanks.

Overall, I liked the recipe. It was very easy to make. I took some of the advice of others though to ensure that it would not be dry. I added some onion when cooking the meat and I used taco seasoning and added some water. My husband and I both liked it, and I will make again.

Really good week night meal.  Easy not a ton of flavor.  I was concerned about the mayo, but it didn't have a weird flavor.  Will make again when pressed for time.

This definitely tasted like a taco!  It seemed to be missing something though.  Maybe more salsa would help.  My husband liked it and kids ate it too!  But it's something you have to be in the mood to have.  Made a good taco salad.

I use this as a dip. Add a little spinach dip to it and wow it's great.
Took it to a christmas dinner  they all asked for the recipe.
