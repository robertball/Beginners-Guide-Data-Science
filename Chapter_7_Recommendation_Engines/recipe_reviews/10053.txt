Was looking for a crispy cookie. To me these looked like they would be soft but mine turned out crispy -- who knew? I did a little marbleizing and did them as flatten balls and it worked.

These were pretty good - the recipe is tough because "bake quickly" was a little vague. I'd say I did them for about 8 minutes or so and they were browned on the bottom and light on top. They are pretty crisp and have a distinctive spiced flavor which I was surprised my six-year-old actually liked. These are pretty good definitely different though I prefer a more "standard" sugar cookie flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

I did this recipe and halved the dough added food coloring and did a spiral then cooled the dough in the fridge. Once the dough was cooled I rolled it in colored sugar and cut and baked for 8 min on 400 degrees. Very happy with this recipe!
