I toasted the bread only until slightly dry (no color to the bread), spread on the ricotta mixture, and after 9 minutes in the oven, they were already browned more than I would have liked and even a little crunchy.  In the future, I will either lower the oven temperature or start checking for doneness a little sooner.  If I'd set the timer for 12 minutes, they would have been burned.  Oven temps vary, but I'd recommend that you play it safe, and watch your time, at least the first time you make this.  Also, I had a long loaf of bakery french bread which is not large in diameter, so I did have some topping left over (but it'll get used). I had everything prepped, so as soon as the bread came out of the oven, the mushroom mixture was ready...timing worked out perfectly! The lemon really brightens up the flavor, and the marsala enriches the flavor of the mushrooms.  This is a fabulous bruschetta with beautiful eye appeal, and most definitely will be made again.

It was a bit too much egg for my taste. Had to add a lot more seasoning to the mushrooms just to take the edge off of the ricotta mixture. You might want to toast the bread a little before adding the ricotta mixture because the bread tends to get a little soggy. Interesting mix of flavors though.

This was really nice.  Light and bright...the hot flakes gave it zig and the lemon was a surprise on the tongue.  I added some parmesean cheese (to taste) because I thought it seemed a bit bland without it and I think it added to the flavor.  Used ciabatta bread and, since it was a wide loaf, the receipe made one piece per guest.  (made 5 slices).

Added a blend of Italian cheeses (Parmesan, Asiago,  Fontina and  Provolone) to this and salted to taste. I enjoyed this very much . I will be having this once a week as a side dish. Whoever said it was "too eggy" must've down something wrong. It's a wonderful blend of ingredients that will titillate your taste buds with every pleasurable mouthful.

I prepared the mushrooms and served them as a side for my Sirloin Roast.  I made three pounds and could have used 6.  Everybody loved them.

This was delicious.  Just 2 of us so I served 4 pieces as supper with fresh fruit. I only used about half of the ricotta mixture to keep bread from being soggy. Next day added parm and frozen spinach to ricotta and used as stuffing for pasta shells.  We don’t eat red meat and often don’t have any meat with our meals. This gave me a lot of bang for my buck too.  Will make again.

While it's always nice to have the recipe in print form.  I LOVE THE VIDEOS, WILL ALWAYS LOVE THE VIDEOS and if I had to watch a video 12 times in order to write down all the ingredients and instructions, it is worth it.  Some of us learn by watching.  In fact, the best learning routine is to watch first, then do and take notes.  Back it up with something in writing but I LOVE THE VIDEOS!!!!    Keep up the good work!!!!!!!!

I skipped the wine. I used sara Lee artesano bread. I followed the suggestion to add parmesan.  The mushroom mixture didn't cook down as much as I would have liked so I added a pinch of flour.  I also just baked the bread enough to harden with no color. I baked it for five minutes with the cheese, then broiled until browned.  The lemon flavor was too strong for me, but not the hubs.  Easy to make and worth playing around with. I forgot the last bit of butter at the end, I think that made a difference. Overall a tasty treat we both enjoyed.

Very tasty.  There was enough of the mixture for about 12 pieces of French bread.  I had to up the heat to evaporate all the liquid at Step 6--medium low wouldn't cut it.

I made this recipe. but I doubt the cheese used in the video was a ricotta cheese, its just to soft and looks more like cream cheese to me. ricotta is much firmer and doesn't blend the way it does in the video. anyhow, I adjusted the recipe and added some cream cheese to make it blend more smoothly.
