This recipe states that you should fry certain ingredients in 1 cup of butter, which is an extraordinarily excessive amount. One could easily fry those same ingredients in a couple of teaspoons of butter. Also, after you fry them, it tells you to drain all excess grease, which I view as an unnecessary waste of butter. In addition to this, although a plentiful amount of flavorful spices are used in this recipe, the cheese ball is very bland. I recommend using instead of 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes, 3 tablespoons and 2 of cayenne pepper.

Since they changed it a little, I would like to mention that I chop the shrimp up in small pieces. Leave as much of the spices that are attached to the shrimp as you can, more flavor in the cheese ball, as to the cup of butter, well it sure makes the flavor great, I wouldn't think you could fry that much onion and garlic with a couple of tsps. I have also made this butter sauce up, let cool for awhile (so the shrimp don't cook), and added shrimp and refrigerate for the day. Then Scewer and grill, these are great!

This is very good but alternate version with Old Bay seasoning, cream cheese, scallions and liquid smoke is less salty and easier to make.

This recipe would be better if it was re-written using less butter, more seasoning.  I was also able to cook the shrip and garlic and onions in very little butter, then you have a better likelyhood of the spices staying intact.
