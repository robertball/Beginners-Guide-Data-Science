I followed the recipe, but used this as a glaze for boneless skinless chicken breasts. Baked chicken at 350 for 25 min. Great "sauce," Thank you! I'm sure it would be quite delicious on wings.

I took this recipe a step further by adding a teaspoon of cayenne powder and a dash of garlic powder. Also, I found that the heat from the wings alone is sufficient and no simmering is needed if you apply the sauce immediately.

Thank You for the great reviews and I am glad to see that others are playing around wth this yummy easy glaze. I tried it on a whole baked chicken and it came out great but you have to watch it because it will burn very easy.

I used blsl chicken breasts, cubed & doubled the "glaze" so I could serve it over rice. That being said, it was REALLY orange-y. Maybe I should've expected that since it IS "orange glazed chicken...", but I was hoping the other ingredients would all blend together to make something flavorful & phenomenal...nope....just orange. I threw in some ginger & more soy sauce to tone it down a bit. It was decent but I won't make it again. Thank you!

Used boneless chicken breasts, cubed, and added a bit of ginger and minced garlic. Will probably add cayenne pepper next time as well. Overall very tasty and simple!

Used on chicken breast and it was great! Each bite initially tasted salty then turned to sweet. I plan to try it on the wings next time.

Done it 10+ times and still have high demand.
I added some dry pepper flakes to make it spicy hot, and I do also one without, for kids.
Not only with chicken wings, also with chicken breast strips, thights, and even with hearts* & guizzards*.... *which did not have a very nice presentation, but, were a big success as well.
Thank you for sharing this wonderful, delicious, cheap and easy recipe ! ! !

The whole family loved this recipe. We dredged out wings in flour prior to crisping in the oil. We filled a baking dish with them while we made the sauce - then covered the wings and baked in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes - broiling for the last 2. I added garlic & red pepper flakes. Delicious - even better than many orange chicken dishes at the 'Chinese' restaurants.

I used chicken breasts like some others, but my fault I overcooked.  The sauce was amazing.  Great orange flavor.  I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes.  I wished I had made rice for the extra sauce.  So good, I will make it again.

Just made this, followed advice to add cayenne and garlic to the sauce, and used it on drumsticks. After browning the chicken, followed reviewers' advice again to add sauce and bake at 350. This is a delicious combination of flavors, we think!!

This was so fast and easy to make.  It tasted great also.  I used thighs cut into large chunks.  I didnt have marmalade so I used mango butter.  I put the thighs in a baking dish and tossed with the sauce.  I cooked for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.

Amazing! I changed it up a bit but not much. I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts instead of wings and put them in a baking dish. For the glaze, I used the marmalade & dijon mustard (just guessed on the amounts) and worchestershire sauce instead of soy. Covered the chicken with the sauce, baked at 350 for about 30 minutes. Served over rice and made some extra sauce (added a little chicken broth to make it a bit saucier)  - fantastic!!! 

(served with green beans)

I used chicken thighs and finished it off in a 350 oven to temperature 165.  SO good!   Will fix this again!

Kid approved! And seriously yummy! Definitely will make this one again. I added a little red pepper flakes for a touch of heat. Oh, and a bit of ginger paste. I could see adding minced garlic, and maybe dusting with toasted sesame seeds and/or minced green onion, in the future.

I used cubed chicken breast. I had to use a lot more oil to fry and the taste was just not what I was looking for. Using the same pan where I fried the chicken gave it a burned taste on the background. But I am rating the sauce 4 stars because the combination is good but I am looking for Chinese restaurant orange chicken sauce, and I can't find it!

Tasty and easy. Ok, I did dredge  thighs, fried to brown, and increased some spicy heat (cayenne pepper) for our personal taste. Then, yes, I baked after putting sauce on one side, turned in 12 minutes, added more glaze, removed after another 12 minutes. Yep, served with rice and green beans. And yes, I'm slow, so it took me a 'bit' longer. None-the-less, we enjoyed. Thank you soooo much for sharing.
