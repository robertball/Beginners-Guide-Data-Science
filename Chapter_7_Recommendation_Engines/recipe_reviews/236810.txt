I was looking for a way to use up the rest of my garden swiss chard before frost hit.  Here's the change I made.  Swiss chard stems are good!.  I had both red and green chard in my garden, so the red stems are pretty in the soup also.  Just chop them up into 1/4 inch pieces and throw them in to saute with the onions.  The stem pieces are a little bit like celery in texture.  Oh yes, I omitted the flaked coconut because I didn't have any, and also because now the chard stem pieces provided a bit of crunch.

I love this soup. The taste depends quite a lot on the broth you end up using. My favorite so far is Better than Buillion vegetarian.

It is an okay soup. I thought the coconut flavor was a little weak.
