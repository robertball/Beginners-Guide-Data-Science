My grandmother and mother always made this recipe and taught me; however we add dill instead of parsley and sprinkled it with freshly ground black pepper.  Sometimes we added finely sliced onions too.    I often add alittle more sugar to suit my tastes.  It has been a favorite accompaniment of mine to all meat dishes or by itself as an appetizer.  I find it best after being refrigerated at least overnight.

Simple and good!  I sprinkled paprika on top for a bit of color.  I could see these having a few seasonings like onion powder or a dash of cayenne pepper.

I have made something similar for many, many years, I taught my mom, it was one of my daughters favorites so I taught hertoo & my grandaughter loves it too....we use dill..sometimes I " cook" sugar & vinegar,I almost always use dill, usually fresh but in winter dry...although sometimes I add parsley I only add if very fresh from our garden. My Sweedish friends said I basically made it correctly,thank for adding this to our recipe file

There are several recipes for Pickled Cucumbers on this site and although all are a bit different, they are all delicious and serve a purpose of adding a needed variety to your menu for the evening.  Just by adding something cold, sweet and a little crispy is a wonderful compliment to color and texture on your plate.  I make up this recipe or another very like it, put it all in a jar, seal it and serve it throughout the week, probably 2 or 3 times. Not really as a side dish but more as a garnish, it's just that little something extra that adds a bit of difference and shows that you care.

I followed recipe to a T. First time I've even had pickled cucumbers so I don't know what I'd compare them to. However I thought they could use a bit more sugar, like review had mentioned. I did use fresh dill instead. Also sprinkled paprika, also reviewer suggestion. I'd make it again.

My grandma and great aunt made these every year when I was a little girl.  They are still delicious and keep very well for weeks.  I've never been able to slice them as thin as my grandma does but they don't have to be super thin to turn out wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!

So delicious! I substituted dill for parsley and peeled the cucumbers and everyone loved them at Christmas dinner tonight.

Made it as written, very good - I could [and do] eat them right out of the jar!   Just a note to the reviewer who said she could never get hers sliced as thin as her grandmother, I suggest you get a mandolin - they slice quickly, evenly and [if you want] anywhere from very thin to thick - check it to see the variances before you buy it if you want really, really thick or thin ones.  I'm going to try this w/ some of the other spices/herbs suggested - should be good w/ any and/or all of them!
