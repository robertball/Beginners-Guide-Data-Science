The original recipe is bland.  I found it improved with these alterations:  increase vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp, increase salt to 1/2 tsp &  roast the raw cashews before adding to recipe.  Canned roasted cashews would work, too, but do not increase salt if using canned, salted roasted cashews.  Baking time is more like 11 -12 minutes than 15 minutes and the flavor intensifies if cookies are allowed to sit 2-3 days.

I was unable to go visit my husband's family with him for the holidays, so I sent him with bags of cookies for all his relatives.  I was initally afraid to include these cashew cookies because I did overcook them a little (BEWARE..I started off with 12 min. and they were def. overdone.  Next time I will start checking them after about 9 1/2 min.  They were dry the first night but seemed to soften up over the next couple days.  But I was glad I did include them...they were my dad's and both his parents' favorites in the whole bag!! (I had Award Winning Choc Chip, Big Soft Ginger Cookies and Peanut Butter Cup cookies, so that's saying a lot!!!)  Also, next time I will put the frosting in a ziploc bag and cut the corner so I can squeeze/drizzle the frosting on...I had a really hard time spreading the frosting on and I had to make it really thick (a little too thick) for it to stick to the cookie and look nice.  ALSO...the frosting doesn't look anything like the cookies in the "main photo"...i guess i didn't look at the other photos before i started and freaked out when my frosting was thick and white, more like cake frosting...not yellow-buttery looking glaze like the picture.  But the frosting was still good and better than without it.  I'd be interested in knowing what kind of glaze is on those cookies in the main picture.

Very good cookie...has a buttery/nutty taste. Be sure to use UNSALTED cashews! I chopped the cashews up with my food processor, being careful not to chop them too fine. From the previous reviews, I expected them to be on the "not-so-sweet" side, but I thought they were plenty sweet. And, actually a quite "rich" cookie. These would make a good cookie for holiday baking, as I considered them to be a "special" treat.

Great cookies. Unique. Won't find like them anywhere else.  30 minutes after baking is *not* the right time to taste them. The frosting and the cookie combine for great flavor the next morning or later.  Delicious delicious frosting. I did a double batch of the cookies and frosting.  Batch 1: As the recipe said. Seemed too cakeish right away but turned out *wonderfully* in the morning. Very good combined with frosting. Batch 2: I folded in some chunky Peanut butter (all natural, no extra sugar, about 1/3 cup) and some JIF (1/3 cup, some extra sugar). These are more crumbly than the first but still delicious.  GENERAL: Use double vanilla. Much better. Half sugar on the frosting. Let cool till next morning. Then try for best effect. If you want perfection that evening, try another recipe; these are best if they sit for a while. Very addictive once complete.  FROSTING: Browning the butter on high is possible and faster. Just don't assume it's not browning cause you can't immediately see the color. The trick is let it boil but stir fast (2 minutes). Then let cool. I only used half the sugar. I can't imagine using more. It was plenty sweet and a perfect blend with the cookie.  I am going to try the frosting with a bit of orange zest-I suspect this would be a good addition.

With a few changes these make the cutest little Christmas cookies and I have used them for years for holiday baking.  First, use only 1 c. of cashews for a softer cookie.  Make them a level teaspoon so their size is a little smaller.  Immediately upon taking them out of the oven, use your thumb to make a nice deep indentation right in the center of the cookie.  Make sure it is well formed so it will nicely hold the frosting.  I add green or red food coloring or divide the frosting into two bowls and use both and put a dollop in each center once the cookie has cooled a little.  Then I quickly add a little silver candy ball decoration to the middle of each before the frosting hardens.  They are so cute and festive and, of course, delicious too and make a great addition to a cookie plate.  Always the first to go!

This is a delicious recipe.  The cookie is soft and moist and turns out almost like a mini cake.  The cookie by itself is not-so-sweet, but tastes excellent with the frosting.  The slightly nutty flavor of the 'burned' butter was delicious.  I brought them to work today and they were devoured.

Excellent cookie!   I think the term "burned butter" kind of scares people off though.  From the way the butter frosting turns out, I think it should be referred to as "carmel butter".   Very NUMMY !!  :)

I am a novice baker, and have always relied on the recipes that have hundreds of reviews...and am consistently disappointed. They are always too blah for my liking.  I thought I'd take a risk and try a recipe that had only 24 reviews, because it sounded SO yummy and there aren't very many cashew cookie recipes out there. Cashews are my favorite, favorite, favorite, so I bit the bullet and made these tonight.  Originally I was going to take them to work but they are too good to leave this house. My boyfriend and I will make it a priority to eat all of these ourselves, and give away a few to some VERY lucky friends.  Because there isn't a ton of sugar in the cookie, it's not extremely sweet, and the rich, sweet icing is the perfect companion to the cookie.   I was a little worried about "browning butter" because there is a fine line between browning and burning, but it was super easy!

These were wonderful! I took them to a party and everyone loved them.  I overheard "Take one of those cookies for a nibble while you're waiting in line!" And I watched *everyone* arrive back at the table with an already bitten cookie and a smile!   One note: I overbaked one tray of these, rescued just before burning - they got brown and crisp and I loved them that way too, but without the frosting. Next note: if your cashews are already salted, you won't need to add any more salt.

THese recieved so many compliments.  The nutty, buttery flavor of the cashews went so good with the sweet frosting.  I incresded the amount of sour cream and used 2 cups of cashews.  The only thing is these do not spread out that well so you'll need to flatten them out a little.  Thanks for the recipe

Hmmm, I had some major problems with the recipe as is.  The cookies came out very flat on the first round I put in. So I added a few heaping spoonfuls of flour, mixed it up, and tried again. They puffed up more like the pictures submitted.  I looked up the recipe primarily for the frosting. There is a baker in town that makes burnt butter frosting on a sour cream cookie and it is to die for.  The frosting recipe here is very close.  If it wasn't for the problem with the flour, I would have rated the recipe higher. But it could be that I am at a high altitude (4600+ feet).  I would probably make this again.

Very good brown surgery tasting cookie. Easy to make, suitable for baking with children. At the children's request, we left off the frosting and pushed a Hershey's chocolate kiss on the top of each warm cookie. The whole family loved them.

These are my alltime favorite cookies!  I include them on my holiday platters, and I always get a lot of requests about the frosting.  Make sure and let the butter start to turn brown, or you wont get the full flavor!

I have made this little cookie for years. Got recipe from friend in Wisc. and her Grandma made it. We are in late 50's and all love this cookie. Don't always

This is a fantastic enhancement to the traditional sour cream cookie.  The icing is just the right touch of sweetness for the 'not so sweet' but wonderfully flavored cookie.
I had to hid the storage container from my mother-in-law so I'd have some left for the holiday !  She was VERY impressed!

They're decent.  The frosting is not too sweet, but you could leave it off if you're just looking for a more plain, nutty flavor.  The cookie had a toffee flavor.  Mom gave it a 3 and they weren't attacked by the fam, so I probably won't make again.

The cookie in this recipe is GREAT.  It is a plain but very tasty cookie.  However, I'm not sure about the icing.  Maybe I did it wrong, but for me it's WAY too sweet.  I will without a doubt be making these cookies again but i'm not sure about the icing.  I may just dust the cookies w/confectioner's sugar.

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe.  The slightly salty flavor of the cashews is complemented completely by the sweetness of the icing.  These are my new favorite!

These cookies are different and very good!  I love cashews and I couldn't stop eating them.  The icing is wonderful also.

These are excellent! I thought they called for too many cashews until I tried them, but the amount is perfect. The icing adds just the right amount of sweetness. The dough was melt-in-your-mouth good too! I can't wait for my mom to try them, she LOVES cashews. Thanks for a keeper!

Overall the cookies were very good.  Cakey and moist, but not very flavorful.  I think I could have cooked the butter a little longer; it came out a very light caramel color.  With more of the caramel flavor, these would be really great.  So I'm not sure if the fault in it was mine or not, but I'd recommend these and will make them again.

This is a great cookie!  I don’t usually comment when I change a recipe but this one is worth noting.  I love the buttery cashew flavor and light but chewy texture.  I wanted the glazed frosting look from the posted picture so I just added about half of the sugar and stirred (not beaten!) it into the warm butter and cream.  I have never made browned butter frosting.  A very interesting method and such a lovely color!  I have added this recipe to my favorites because my husband, who only likes three or fur kinds of cookies that I have been making for 35 years, rated this “a keeper”!

Yum!  I added 1 & 7/8 cups of chopped cashews. and the cookies turned out well.  Twelve minutes was enough time to bake these cookies. Next time, I will make the cookies smaller,

Further burnt butter info.  I was very nervous about this.  Just so the next person knows...the butter will get foamy/bubbly and that is normal also it took around six minutes to not "burn" lol.  The cookies were delicious.  I only added a cup of cashews and they were still delicious.  I'll attach a picture.  I found the easiest way to frost (because they have a bumpy top) is to put frosting in a sandwich bag and cut a small corner off and pipe it out.  Next time I will cut a smaller corner cut.   I also added 4 drops of Wilton blue food coloring that gave me a light green frosting.

These will probably be a one hit wonder for me. The frosting is addicting but the cookie itself isn't anything spectacular. I think reducing the backing power could make it less cakey which seems like it would be better. I'd like the frosting more glazy too.

These cookies were soft and the frosting added the right amount of sweetness. They tasted like shortbread to me, so I wasn't overly impressed, BUT everyone at work & home loved them. Be careful about the cooking time (mine were ready in 10 min).

great cookie, with or without the frosting...  I made them for my cashew-loving boyfriend's birthday...  I halfed the recipe and the frosting came out a bit gritty...
