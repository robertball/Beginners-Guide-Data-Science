To use ingredients we had on hand, I did make the following changes: 1 level tsp. of ginger powder, chili powder, cilantro powder (instead of fresh ginger, chili, cilantro), and I used only 2 TBS. curry powder and added no sugar.  I made it with 800 ml water, 1 level TBS. vegetable-broth-powder, and 1 cup of 10-minute-red-lentils.  I also added a diced tomato.  It was spicy and you could taste the curry, but not too spicy. We liked it a lot, and I am sure it's even better with fresh ginger and cilantro.

Great flavor and easy to make.  I used jalapeño and added diced green pepper and celery.  Like another reviewer commented, I needed to add extra water and extend the cook time for the lentils to around 45 min.  Served it over a brown rice blend.

This is one of the best lentil recipes I've done so far and I have done a ton, I’m a lentil maniac.  It’s a bit spicy though but so very tasty.  Only change was the stock, used beef cause had nothing else and I’m not a vegetarian.  Had to add a little more water near the end to finish cooking lentils to my liking.  Great with plain basmati rice.  Thanks, a keeper !!

It took forever to brown the carrots and onion, but it sure smelled good!  I cut back to using just 2 T curry powder, and DH thought it was plenty hot enough for him!  This is a great tasting dish!

This was a really tasty curry lentil recipe. The addition of sugar really helps to balance the spiciness of the recipe and make it very unapologetically West Indian. I think the curry powder you use will factor heavily into how much you enjoy this. I made my own curry powder according to my own tastes and loved it. Thank you, always, for sharing.

I loved it!  The only substitutions I made because I used what I had available was using chicken broth and using chili powder mixed with a dash of cayenne pepper (1 tbsp) in the place of a fresh chili. I also didn't have cilantro so next time I'll make sure I add that. So yummy!!!! Tastes great with brown rice and some kind of vegetable (or I'm sure, a lean meat would be tasty too).

I had to cut down the spice, as I was making this for myself and my toddler. It was even better than I expected. My son devoured every last bite on his plate! I will be keeping this recipe for years to come, and hopefully add more spice as my son grows older. Thanks!
