The whole family loves this bread.  It's fool proof, so easy to make and really great to change it up a bit.  I add extras like pecans, cherries, cranberries, walnuts, whatever is in my cupboard really and it turns out amazing.  I also use maple syrup sometimes if I have no honey and use whole wheat flour in place of the all-purpose- for extra fibre.  Thanks for fantastic recipe.  Just about to pop another loaf on now.....

I used whole wheat flour instead of the bread flour, and ground black pepper and cloves instead of the mace and cardamom.  This is a great bread!  It will be one of my holiday breads this year!

This bread is delicious! I made it with raisins and dried cranberries.  Yes, I would definitely make this one again.  Thank you!
