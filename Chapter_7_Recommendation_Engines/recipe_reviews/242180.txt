What a great different way to use watermelon. Next time i make this i will omit the honey..as i found it too sweet (Watermelon is naturally sweet). I will be making this to take on my morning walks this summer. It would be fun to try this with some herbs..maybe mint and or basil. Vodka would be a nice touch as well :) Thanks for sharing this recipe.

It was very easy to make, but I think there should be more flavors going around. Any suggestions?

Made it exactly as is including only 5 ice cubes and it was way too watery.  Maybe my watermelon was juicier than those of others.  It was bland as heck, so I added  5 strawberries, and about 3/4 cup of non fat Greek yogurt.  Oh and a tablespoon of chopped up fresh mint.  Better, but still lacking in both substance and enough flavor to me.  Wish I had some vodka to put in it like another reviewer suggested!

So refreshing, delicious and so easy! I thought maybe the honey would make it too sweet, but it's perfect. A taste of summer! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a good recipe but I would use less honey.  I also agree with the other reviewers that this is better as an "adult" beverage.

This was super easy and very quick to make. I froze the watermelon to make it extra frosty and it came out delicious. I also added more honey to give it an extra added flavor. I think next time I'll add strawberries or kiwi
