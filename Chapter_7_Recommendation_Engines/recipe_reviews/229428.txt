This was declared a winner tonight!  Yum!  I had one pound of tenderloin in my freezer, and this recipe was chosen for it, cutting the recipe exactly in half!  I marinated it only two hours.  How lucky we were!  I would say that you should salt and pepper the pork as you prepare to BBQ it.  It was delicious!  Thank you so much, sooz!

This was so good!  Due to a change in plans, this marinaded for two days.  Loved it.  Didn't change a thing.  I did boil the leftover marinade and used as a sauce.  I actually ate two pieces of it, and I rarely eat more than one piece of any meat at a meal.  Will be making again for sure!  Thanks for this recipe!

Overall, I liked this recipe, and so did my kids.  But it was too strong.  We all liked the flavor, but it was a little bit too much - a little too sweet and a little too salty. I made it exactly as directed, and marinated it only one hour, and it was too much.  And I used Tamari, which is less salty than regular soy.

Next time, I will halve the soy and honey, maybe add some orange juice or even salt water to make enough liquid to simulate the 2/3 C called for in the recipe.

I am giving this recipe the benefit of the doubt with my 4-star rating, but I actually wasn't impressed.  While eating it Hubs said it was good, but the guy who loves leftovers, hasn't touched the rest that's now been sitting in the fridge for two days.  I made half the recipe for one tenderloin and let it marinade for about six hours.  Sorry, but this one just didn't do it for me.

We made this a year ago, and then I lost the recipe! We marinate the pork as instructed and shake the bag once in a while to coat the pork. We do not own a grill, so we simply fry the pork in a pan, and it comes out beautifully. It's sweet and salty without being overwhelming. Make it with mashed potatoes and gravy, and it's always a hit in our household. LOVE this one!

(EDIT: I would like to add that we usually make this with some regular pork chops cut into cubes, not pork tenderloin, and they turn out just as delicious! Also, these do not make good leftovers, so eat it all while it's fresh.)

Very good, easy to make and not a lot of ingredients. Just perfect  for the tenderloin tips I bought . I marinated the pork for about 6 hours and I think you could marinate it overnight or longer and not have a problem with the taste. I will definitely make this again!

I make this recipe all the time since it is so easy.  I sometime only marinade it for 10 minutes and it is still great. I passed it on to my niece who is getting married in a couple of months. A bonus is that my name is Sheila.

I have used the marinade about four times now and it's a hit every time. It's really simple and easy to make. I didn't give it five start because I personally think it covers up the flavor of the meat to much. But, with that being said everyone I serve it to loves it!!

Loved the rich flavors and how easy it was to make. Let it sit in fridge overnight and processed the leftover marinade for use as a sauce. Shown served over a bed of pepper-bacon cheddar loaded mashed potatoes with side of carrots.

Only four stars because the internal temp is to high.  This type of meat should be removed at 133-135 degrees internal and covered for 5 min before slicing.  The recipe is very good and will be making it again.  Pork can go from great to dry so easy you need a temp device and remove from grill at the proper time.  I also reserved the marinade, boiled it, and served on the side at the table.  Slicing the tenderloin before grilling, as suggested in the directions, is also another way to accelerate the pork to being over cooked.  Until the juices run clear is a mystery instruction for pork.  I have seen that mentioned with chicken but never pork.  "Until the juices run clear" is not necessary with any cooking method.  The meat is done (and safe) when it reaches the right temp reguardless of what the juices are telling you.  We have come a long way in the science of grilling/roasting to be tied to a 'saying' that holds no basis in fact.

I left marinating over night and put it in the slow cooker for 4 hours on high, delicious! I used Agave instead of honey. Since there was not to many 'sauce' we ate it like tacos.

01.04.17 ~ A nice, different way to serve up a pork tenderloin. I had a one pound tenderloin that I cut in eight slices and halved the ingredient recipe. The meat marinated all day and we cooked in on our new indoor grill. It worked great, and the meat was very tender. Served this with 'Rich and Savory Spaghetti Squash' from AR.
