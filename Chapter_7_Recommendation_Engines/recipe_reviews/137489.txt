I agree!  I followed the recipe to the letter and my spicy loving' hubby loved.  I agreed with the previous reviewer, surprisingly spicy, but the flavor is grand!

This recipe was easy to make. I was making a asian style theme dinner and wanted to use potatoes I had. This worked perfectly. I did omit the Jalepenos because I have small children. I also ommited the coriander because I did not have any. I substituted the butter with 3 tablespoons olive oil to be a little more healthy. The dish had a great flavor, but was still a little spicy for my kiddos. Me and my husband loved it.
