Sounds delicious. :D I think I'll leave out the pineapple and use apple cider vinegar instead, just 'cause that's what I have. Apple and maple sounds good anyways:P

If I do a ham glaze at all it's just the same ol' standby I've used for years with brown sugar, mustard and orange juice.  In fact,  Hubs and I prefer no glaze at all but I wanted to try something different.  This worked for both of us.  Absolutely loved it.  I did not, however, use the cloves or the optional pineapple, and I poured just a splash of Seven-up in the bottom of the pan as I always do.  The tiny bit of vinegar obviously mellows out the sweetness of the maple syrup and the result was smooth, just lightly sweet, and simply delicious.  The juices were perfect to drizzle over the sliced ham for even more of that great flavor and to help keep it moist upon serving.  This glaze beats my old stand-by hands down.

I made the glaze part only of this recipe and poured it over sauteed chicken breast tenders served over sweet potato puree. I loved the combination of flavors and the sweetness given from the maple glaze.
