Keeper! Very good!  After mixing up the dough, I let it rest wrapped in sprayed plastic wrap.  The dough rolled out so nice, I was able to roll it very thin, next time I would roll even thinner.   I heated the oven and a pizza stone to 450 for 30 minutes while making up the dough.   I placed the rolled out dough on parchment paper, did not pre-bake and topped with sauce, cheese and pepperoni.  Baked for 10 minutes at 450.  
This made one pizza, that was inhaled - next time I will double or triple the recipe.  Thanks for this quick and easy recipe.

This is great for making pizza dough on a busy weeknight because it is so effortless. It rolls out easily, and makes a good crust. I doubled the recipe, added a clove of garlic and about a tablespoon of fresh oregano. Without the added flavoring, this would have been a very bland crust.

I have a 2 year old running about so time and ease are necessary. This recipe was very easy and fast.  It was also fun for my 2 year old as she got to add the toppings she wanted. While she waited for her pizza I had taken a little dough and rolled it out. I then spread some softened butter and topped with cinnamon and brown sugar. Baked for 10 minutes. It was a hit.

I really like  this recipe. I usually double the ingredients and add black pepper, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder. The bowl over the dough for ten minutes is a crucial step (I used to always  refrigerate the dough before flattening it onto the pan, which gave me trouble.) Last night I made a pizza using the bowl method and my dough was the perfect consistency and easy  to flatten and shape. I was really happy!

I am in the business of trying out recipes to make my pizza from scratch. I tried this for the first time tonight and even though it was easy to make, the texture after baking is more like a thin, soft baking powder biscuit. The flavor was more along that line, also. I'll keep looking for another easy recipe with a chewier crust.

The only thing we changed up is the amount of olive oil.  We used a dash of olive oil, and mixed it with the remaining amount of melted coconut oil (so it wouldn't turn solid quickly), for healthier fats.  We also used stone-ground whole wheat pastry flour. It was delicious!  I'm so happy I can finally eat pizza now, since finding out I can't eat yeast!!  Yum!

Nothing is as good as a yeast crust pizza, but this was a delicious alternative. I followed the recipe as is, only I added 1/2 tbs (approx) of Italian seasoning to the dough. The dough was pliable and easy to work with. I rolled between 2 sheets of parchment paper, pricked dough and baked for 8 minutes. Then I brushed on olive oil, added toppings and baked 8 minutes more at 400°. I baked directly on the parchment. Will make again when I’m in a time crunch or when I think I have yeast...and I don’t!

No only is it great for pizza, but I made mozzarella sticks with it! Also if you add a little brown sugar to it, it makes a great pie crust! So yummy. Thank you for posting it!

This is a super easy recipe that creates a nice thin crust pizza in a flash. We regularly make it. I've made it as directed first, and it turned out great. Then, I modified the recipe and it was lovely half whole wheat, half white flour and with almond milk. I also like adding some garlic salt and oregano to the crust to give it an extra yummy taste.

This recipe is great for thin crust as well as flat bread. The only change that I made was adding a little more flour when I rolled out the dough, because the dough is very sticky , even after rising. I also did add seasonings right before I threw it in the oven to bake off the crust , and then let it rest for about 15 minutes before I added the toppings. I made a lovely loaded potato pizza and the girlfriend loved it. I would definitely use this recipe again.

This is a great way to make a quick and easy pizza dough, however without modifications, it's basically a biscuit. 

I used 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk for milk and added: 1 tsp. Garlic Powder, 1 tsp. Oregno, 1 tsp. Basil, and 1/2 tsp sugar. I blended in my stand mixer and once a ball formed, added another 1/2 tsp. of olive oil and blended for about 20 -30 more seconds, then I let rest for 15 mins.

The dough rolled out effortlessly ( rolled to about 1/4 inch thick and pushed in the edges a bit to form a crust) without a floured surface, and I screen baked at 450 for 8 min, added my toppings, and went for another 8 mins, per another users recommendation. The middle of the crust was soft with crispier golden edges.

Super easy to make! Followed the recipe exactly, just had to add a splash more milk. I rolled mine nice and thin so it was like a Flatbread pizza. Made some homemade sauce with fresh mozzarella and basil, and it was delish! Easy good recipe when you want something quick!

I used this pizza crust recipe and it was delicious! When I found out that I ran out of yeast which usually is my number one ingredient in pizza dough- I freaked. I didn't quite believe I could find a yeast-free pizza recipe but still looked just in case. To my disbelief I found it and only decided to try it due to the amount of good reviews which is what  I always look at. I loved how fast and easy the recipe was. The only thing that I tweaked a bit was that I made a double serving for each pie ( I made two pies altogether).  If I wouldn't have done so, one dough would be equal to personal pizza and I was making a family dinner.  Overall, the pizza crust was very soft, easy to cut, and easy to chew which I loved. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made this since it didn't call for yeast and I had the other ingredients. It's a pretty good pizza crust, but I had to add extra water since it was too dry to even stick together.

This crust was delicious, soft and easy to make. I recommend melting 2tbsp of butter and mixing it with fresh minced garlic and Italian seasoning and putting it on the crust before baking. Adds tons of flavor and is delicious!!!

I was surprised how good this came out, expecting a flat biscuit, but it was not. It is not a yeast copycat, but it is a good thin and crispy! Was not dry at all. For those who did get a dry crust, that could easily be fixed by not over measuring flour or adding a small bit more milk- just to be able to roll easily. Also, can be caused by over-baking.
I rolled between parchment paper with a bit of EVOO and it peeled right off into my pan. (Just the way I always do, not sure whether it needed it, but it makes things easy.)
For it to taste good, you must have GOOD flour, and a good EVOO. I didn't add flavor though that would be even better.
This was a test, but plan on making it for a meal soon.

It is decent, although it does not serve 8, more like 4 or 5. It is a little chewy, not bad just not 100% desired. If you do not have yeast, this is the dough to make. Most likely one of the best no yeast doughs I've ever eaten

I used store bought pizza dough in an attempt to make a heart shaped pizza for Valentine's Day and it was a failure (very difficult to roll out and knead into a shape).  I desperately needed a recipe to make pizza dough from scratch after this, without yeast. I was extremely pleased at not only the short amount of time this took, but also how well it came out. This was so easy to shape,  and tasted amazing!

I made lots of changes by adding seasonings and herbs to the pizza. I used canola oil instead of the olive oil. I made a white seafood pizza with shrimp and crabmeat with veggies. And, used mixture of cheeses. I may have added a little too much salt to my dish. Little on the salty side. The crust I wasn't big on. It's ok when you really don't have yeast. Then, again it may have been because I didn't like my pizza that much. Next time I'm gonna stick to traditional toppings. And, skimp on seasonings added. Then, the crust may taste better. But, what i do like about this recipe is the ease of making crust.

If I had used a rolling pin and rolled out the crust thinner and precooked a little longer, this would have been perfect. I like a crispy crust and this will be my go-to recipe for homemade pizza from now on even if I have yeast and time on my hands!

I made this with my grandkids 9, 6 and 2; it was quick and easy.  They added their toppings so it worked out well for all of us.

Super easy.  Maybe add butter and Italian seasoning to the crust after baking for 8 minutes to give it a little bit of flavor?

Turned out as expected for a no yeast dough.  Fast.  Rolled out very nicely.  Expected it to be bland so added chilli flakes, pepper and an Italian blend to the flour.  Brushed with garlic butter before I added my toppings.  Was ok.  Will make again in a pinch.

I too made some changes. More salt and light seasoning (garlic powder, italian seasoning) and a litter water to make the dough slightly more wet. I also let the dough sit before rolling it out and baking it. This might not do anything but I feel like a real chef letting the dough "chill" in the fridge for a little while.

I made this because we were out of yeast and my kids enjoy cold pizza in their lunch. The only changes I made, were that I used half whole wheat/ half all purpose flour, I also added oregano, crushed garlic, dried basil, and black pepper (the crust would have been very bland without adding the herbs).
Other than that, I followed the directions on baking. It made a very thin and crispy crust. If I make it a next time, I will defently double the recipe.

This really worked.   I will definitely roll it out a bit thinner next time.  I did half  whole wheat flour and half all purpose and put sesame seeds under the dough to keep it from sticking to my pan.  also almond milk was a great sub for the fat free milk.  great recipe!

Best fast and easy crust I ever made.  I would recommend to others to try this recipe.  If others do not like the pizza recipe move on to another pizza recipe.  Forgot to mention   very tasty.

Followed the recipe exactly. It turned out great! I baked the dough on a pizza stone. Then I topped with marinara sauce, garlic powder, parmesan cheese, mozzarella and pepperoni and baked it for 17 minutes. Definitely will be my go to recipe!

This recipe is pretty bland. It is also incomplete as you have to guess cooking temp and time. It worked for what it was, but probably won't make it again without major modifications to add flavor.

added chia, flax and hemp seeds; coconut oil instead of olive oil, and a little sugar to my crust.

Easy to roll out and work with.  The crust didn’t rise as much as I wanted but the taste is great and nice to supplement the yeast out.

Super easy! Great recipe for kids. You can hand spread the dough easily. Has a bready taste to it versus a yeasty taste. I put some oil on our pan and the pizza slid right off.

Instead of buying frozen pizza crust, I decided to make my own. So happy to find this yeast free recipe, it's so simple and easy to make.  My husband and me love thin crispy crust, and this  is the perfect recipe to keep.

Just made two pizza crusts. One I used more milk. Both came out good. You have to spread the dough around or else it will be thick and it will take longer in the oven.  I used a round pizza tray.

I would give this a five star but there is room for improvement always but make sure while doing this you add a little bit more flavoring into the dough like garlic or what ever you want because with out it, it would have been very plain and not as good. Great recipe though for something very quick and easy

Delicious & Crunchy. I made it for my Husband who is quiet fussy when it comes to Pizza & it passed the test with flying colours. I added a little more mix after mixing & was absolutely perfect. I also rested for longer than 10mins as made it earlier in the day. Will definitely make again.

I'll make it again.. It was a little dry when kneading and rolling. I think I may have added a little too much flour...  I'll check it again next time.  Very good taste , and turned out great.

We absolutely loved this recipe and it will be our go-to from now on!  Might not be for folks who like a thick, gooey crust but we like ours thin and crispy.  At the suggestion of some other reviewers we did add a dash of garlic powder and Italian seasoning but it would have been great without it.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

I thought it was pretty good and it was very easy. My mom thought it tasted like the chef boyardee  pizza crust. I probably won't make it again, and make one with yeast.

It really is fantastic. I make the dough and every time change the toppings from classic pizza to thyme-zaatar, to cheese and hot sauce. This is a keeper. Sometimes, if I'm not in a rush, I add 1 ts. of yeast.

Already wrote my review, however I left out that I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk ( didn't have regular), it came out good. I saw that it was too salty for others but I didn't even taste the salt in the crust, Looking forward to having fun with this recipe another time, though I will cook it for less time because the crust came out hard.

I've made it twice now. Its a good and and easy thing to make, especially when your low on money and food options. The first pizza I made was a breakfast pizza with a peppery milk gravy for sauce, cheesy scrambled eggs, and Italian sausage. The second pizza I made was a barbque, chicken, bacon, and parmesan. My only complaint is I think it needs a bit more salt. It is easy to make variations with this recipe. Next endeavor? A turkey pepperoni pizza with red and green bell peppers, onion shallots, black olives, banana peppers with a homemade tomato sauce.

Very quick and easy. I really wanted to do a traditional NY pizza crust but realized we had no yeast so I was really happy to find this recipe. Definitely needs extra seasoning though! I followed the advice of another commenter and added salt (1/4 tsp because of the dietary requirements of family members) and 1 tsp of dried oregano. I recommend a full 1/2 tsp of salt for others if you want better taste. Overall, really good recipe!

I succesfully substituted milk with almond milk and you couldn't taste the difference. It was just honestly bland and tasted like flour. It was easy and rose properly so that's why I give it 3 stars.

I made this with my girls and their cousins (an 11 year old, 9 year old, 4 year old, 3 year old and 20 month old) and all of the girls had a blast. We sectioned the dough into 4 and made mini pizzas. The thinner the dough was rolled the better it turned out. The milk is the key to this recipe. A+

Great recipes and I was able to add in some rice cauliflower which incorporated easily and didn't change the texture of the crust. I also used a little toasted sesame oil which added a little boost of flavor to the entire pizza. I also cut back on the salt and added some garlic powder. pizza was delicious even my 2 year old ate the crust and she normally will not eat the crust!!

I make this all the time using whole wheat flour and almond milk. I also add a couple of tablespoons of a mix of milled flax and chia seeds. Delicious!

A little bit dry and lacked flavor, but quite edible, just not special. It was very easy to work into shape.

I used this recipe for a breakfast pizza and the next day for BBQ chicken pizza. Both were very good. Instead of rolling out the dough, I just pressed it out in the pan, which worked great. Not quite as flavorful as a yeast crust, but it gets bonus points for ease and time saving!

Tried it because of the no yeast. It was dry, and way too salty..  had a difficult time with the dough to begin with, got it as thin as possible but just dry and cracked... ate my topping off it and tossed the crust. Wouldn’t recommend

This is a good option if you have a desire for pizza but no yeast. However, the dough is very different from regular pizza dough--more like a dense biscuit. That isn't surprising, based on the ingredients, but I was hoping for something a little more like real pizza.

First batch tasted a bit like play dough ??????? Was way too salty for the kids, I made a second batch without the salt and it turned out much better! 
 I used 1/2 white, 1/2 whole meal flour! 

Turned it into pizza scrolls for the kids lunch boxes. Can’t wait to see how they turn out.

This is the WORST pizza I have ever had. The dough wouldn’t cooked, but when I took it out of the oven it was super dry. No matter how much milked I added to them the dough it stayed dry. I wouldn’t recommend making this .

I made this exactly how your instructions said to & it didn’t come out very well. Was the milk supposed to be room tempature perhaps? My dough was so hard. I would like to try again tho so any suggestions on what I may have done incorrectly would be greatly appreciated.

The title should be renamed to No-Yeast THIN-CRUST Pizza Dough Recipe.
Points for it being super quick to make, however. You don't have to wait for it to rise for five hours.

Super easy. Made this with the kido but not for pizza but “garlic bread”. I put together all the basic ingredients and let him toss in garlic, basil, just whatever he wanted in it. Came out like expected. He’s pretty proud of himself. Topped it with garlic, butter, and Parmesan cheese. Thanks for the easy recipe ??

Definitely will make again.  I added Italian seasoning, garlic and oregano, 1/2 tbsp of each. Bake the crust for 8 min, then add 1/4 tsp of each with a light dusting of garlic.  If you live in the southeast of Ohio the crust tastes very similar to Larosas pizza

This crust was super easy to make. I double it for my husband, 2-year-old, and myself. We also put oregano and garlic powder in the mid for added flavor. I have made it 3 times now and love it!

Tossed the dry ingredients into my food processor. Then added the butter. Pulsed to mix in the butter, then added the milk, slowly. Pulsed til it came together.
Laid down wax paper with some sprinkled flour. Rolled to fit a 16 inch pan. 
I placed the dough in the oven for approx 8 to 10 minutes then placed all my toppings on.
Placed in 450 oven for about 15 minutes.
Crust was light brown on the outside, tender on the inside. Did raise just a bit.  
Came out perfect.
I will use this recipe again.

Super easy to follow and my husband loved it. I took the liberty of adding garlic to the flour mix and brushed the crust with garlic butter before baking.

After following the recipe & rolling thin then baking, all exactly as directed, I find this recipe to be a thin biscuit vs pizza crust. I think the way to remedy this is to bake the crust for 8 minutes un-topped then top & bake 10 minutes. The crust bakes up very soft. Even the edges don't crisp up. As an experiement I made the crust again & rolled thin again & baked for 8 minutes, un-topped, then baked again un-topped for 10 minutes. the crust never got crisp. The edges were slightly more firm but it never turned out like pizza crust. It is a nice option for those who don't have others, but I'll keep searching for something else.

great recipe!, easy, fast and makes a good crust, crunchy in the borders and soft in the middle. maybe I will add herbs in other try, but works perfectly as is.

Super easy for the kids (ages 6 and 3) to help with.  I used one recipe and split the dough in half for each of them to make their own mini pizza.  They loved it and were so excited to make their own pizzas :)

While making the dough, I was preparing myself to write a 1 star review.  It took a lot more than kneading  it ten times to get it together.  Once I did, I baked it for 8 minutes, put the toppings on and then slid it off the sheet pan directly onto the oven rack.  I baked it for another 15 minutes and it was ok.  It looked like pizza which is important to my boys.  The crust was definitely not a chewy pizza crust, it was more flaky and biscuit like but it didn't taste bad.  Ok for a last minute pizza request when you don't want to spend the money on delivery and you ran out of frozen.   Also, i used garlic salt instead of regular salt to give the crust a little more flavor.

Perfect for a no yeast, quick crust. It's not very flavorful on its own, so I will probably add spices next time. As a college student looking for a cheap , easy, and quick way to make pizza, this recipe was exactly what I needed.

I've made this recipe many times,after the first time I started adding a heavy spoon of garlic powder which adds to the flavor. Tonight in an effort to be more health conscious, I made this recipe using whole wheat flour and it was amazing! I make sure to bake the dough long enough that the edges get crispy before I add the sauce and toppings and it is always great!

Absolutely fab! I made this on a whim to use up leftover chicken and it made the nicest pizza base. I didn’t even do the pre-cooking step. My advice is to make the dough just before you want to use it and give it the full 10 minutes resting time under the bowl. So easy!

I like this recipe a lot. I was looking for a simple crust so i wouldn’t have to use my yeast and this one did the trick! It was thick enough and had a great texture. I followed all directions with the exception of the milk because I didn’t have any so I used water instead and I also added an additional half cup of flour so that I could make just a few “pizza pockets” for my daughter’s school lunches. The crust was bubbly because I’m sure I needed to prick it and didn’t, but I like the air pockets anyway. Lastly, I baked it for the 8 minutes, topped it, then wrapped the pizza in plastic wrap to eat on a different day. We’re all excited to dig in. The pockets that we made didn’t brown as much as I thought that they would, but we did spray some sunflower oil on the tops. The overall pockets felt great to the touch, but now only time will tell. Thanks again for the great recipe! I’ve locked it into my favs as well as into my personal recipe book with the rest of my breads!

My picky picky picky kids love this dough, I actually made mine with cheap canola oil and it comes out great. They like this pizza dough topped with white pizza sauce and cheese. (Less stains too than red sauce)

Wow! I was sceptical about this, because I've tried others and it failed me..
But this was AMAZING! I use water instead, because i was out of milk, added a pinch of sugar as well.
And it came out so GOOD still. Everyone in the fam, loved IT 
Definitely will be making more in my future.

I subbed whole wheat flour and added a tablespoon of Italian seasoning and a table spoon of garlic powder. I also added an extra half a tablespoon of oil.  It turned out pretty okay.

It has too much of a salt flavor so I would cut it down some but otherwise it was a good recipe.  I made it as a double batch and it worked out well.

Overall I liked it and thought was even better when heating up the leftovers the next day.  The only thing I did different was use 2% milk and added some Italian seasonings to the dough to give it a bit more flavor.  If you don't have time to wait for a yeast dough, this pizza crust is a great replacement.  Will definitely do it again.

I'll defiantly be using this one again. I found the dough a bit greasy and I added some oregano, but that's my preference.

Tastes like a biscuit, not airy, light or crispy like a pizza crust should be. Very bland.

Instead of low-fat milk, I used unsweetened coconut milk because I did not have milk in my fridge. The dough tasted great and was a hit with my boys. I will definitely be making this again

Pre-baking the crust made it nice and crispy.  It rolled out vertu easily too.  Add favorite sauce and toppings.  Delicious!  No leftovers!

This is great when you don't have yeast and don't want to wait a long time for pizza dough to rise.  Just made this and I'm not disappointed.  I didn't pre-bake it because it rolled out thin (12" pizza pan) but I will next time.  I had it loaded with fresh toppings so had to bake it longer than I planned.  Will make again!

Thank you so much for this recipe. I am a new cook and this was a breeze. I added oregano and garlic powder for taste, that is why it's not getting 5 stars.

This recipe was perfect for us.   Easy (similar to the Martha White Pizza Crust when mixed, but bakes up slightly fluffier).  I had all the ingredients on hand.   Definite keeper!  Teen-approved, too.  I may try adding in the oregano and garlic suggested by others to future crusts for comparison, but as a traditional crust, it was perfect, easy and convenient!

the dough was easy to make and rolled out nicely, but it was pretty bland. I highly recommend adding some herbs or something to it. I used olive oil infused with garlic and it was still pretty bland. I mean, come on, its just flour basically...so yeah, it needs flavor!! I rolled the dough to maybe 1/4" thickness and after baked, it was roughly 1/2-3/4" thick. So if you're looking for a thin crust...roll VERY thin! I will make this again, I'll just make sure to add herbs and more sauce, this dough can handle it!

I am too impatient to wait for a yeast crust to rise, so this is a perfect recipe. Used almond milk and added garlic/oregano. Let rest wrapped loosely in plastic wrap. First time I did NOT pre-bake and it turned out doughy. Second time I DID pre-bake and it was a little more hard & sturdy. I like my crust doughy so I probably won't pre-bake again. Either way this is super yummy and fast for impatient pizza lovers!

Easy recipe. I found it quick and easy to follow. I added Parmesan Cheese,  Italian Seasoning, Oregano, Rosemary, Pepper and Garlic to the dough to give the crust some flavor, as I had read in the reviews that others found the dough to be bland. I topped it with pizza sauce, ground chicken, pepperoni, and sauteed onions and green peppers, and finished it off with Mozzarella Cheese. I doubled the recipe and made 2 thin crust pizza's on cookie sheets, since I could not seem to find my pizza pan. It was a hit in my home, with one pan already gone, and my 1 1/2 year old grandson giving it his seal of approval!

Half the recipe to make a small one for myself. Very good, definitely will make again. I didn't prebake the crust, just added on the toppings and put in 400 degree oven.

Easy enough to make and shape.  Found it a little dry though, my husband, who likes thin crust said it was almost like a cracker.  I used the recipe exactly, let the dough rest about 10 minutes, then rolled and shaped.  I pre baked the crust, then added the ingredients and baked for about 10 min to heat though.

To be totally honest, I did not have high hopes for this recipe at all but decided to give it a shot because I'm out of yeast. I'm so glad I tried it! My husband and I actually like this recipe better than our usual yeast dough (and it's awesome that it's so quick to whip up)! I ended up adding an extra splash of milk to my dough because it was a tad bit dry once I mixed it and like another reviewer suggested, I also threw in about a tablespoon of oregano and a clove of garlic to the dough mixture. To me, these additions really made this a great, quick weeknight recipe that we will be adding to our rotation!

I made this and doubled the recipe last time . It was too thick doubled but still good. I add oregano and basil to it as well as topping it with minced garlic and some cheese. I am making it again now and made it a little different . Im not doubling the recipe and making it with added parmesian, oregano, basil and some garlic and chipolte seasoning.  We will see i am excited!

I used gluten free flour to make this.  I had to add a bit more milk to it and I should have added even more.  It was a tad dry.  Also, I found it did not make enough.  Double the recipe.  It is good though.  It just needed a bit of adjustment for me.  It could be due to the type of flour or that we live in FL.  We used the dough to make a simple stromboli.  I adjusted the cooking directions to just 1 time in the oven (with stuffing) at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.  It could have gone a few more minutes but was good.

I made this crust, I added garlic powder and Italian seasoning. Also used buttermilk. The crust was great  I had no trouble rolling it out. For the toppings I followed the recipe for hummus pizza on this site instead of using red sauce spread hummus on the crust. It tasted fantastic   Baked at 475 degrees for 10 minutes.  This a wonderful crust. I like that this recipe only calls for 1/12 cups of flour compared to others that are 3 or 4 cups. Who needs those extra calories.              Trixy

Ii Made Thiis Today . It Was Pretty Good . Ii Suggest Maybe Adding Aa Little Garlic Pizza Seasoning Into The Crust Ii Also Added Aa Lil Italian Seasoning Into The Crust . Instead Of The Olive Oil Ii Added Coconut Oil and Also Before Adding My Toppings Ii Mixed Some Coconut Oil and Aa Drop Of Butter To Top The Dough . Inside Of The Dough Ii Added Aa Splash More Milk (( Ii Used Soy Milk Instead )) . Ii Double The Recipe and It Made Aa Nice Size Pizza , Ii Suggust Doing So Unless You Want Aa Small Pizza . Without The Extra Seasoning  In The Crust Ii Feel It Would Have Been Aa Bland Crust (( FOR ME )) But Overall It Is The PERFECT Base To Learn To Make Aa Pizza From Scratch &&" Very EASY !!!!! - I'm 17 ?? Been Cooking Since 4th Grade Loved The Recipe Thanks !! ??

Great base recipe for an easy, soft and sturdy crust that doesn't crumble or grow soggy under a generous helping of sauce. I'm thinking a little sugar might help it brown up better and some recipe-appropriate seasonings would be good, but quite usable as is. I avoid doing homemade pizza because of the time it takes to raise pizza dough, and this is easily a good enough substitute for yeast dough to allow me to do it more often.

It's good in a pinch when you don't have time for yeast and probably does satisfy teenage boys (but again,teenage boys will eat almost anything as long it's in huge quantities. I r emember those years)   Just kind of blah.

Hi! I've made this 2 times so far! 
1. The first time I added a bunch of spices and flavor. I added dry basil from a jar, ground black pepper, parmesean cheese I believe. I just did the recipe as it called for, as I didn't double it. The dough was a little sticky after letting it sit for the 10 minutes, but I was ok with that. So when rolling it out with my rolling pin, just added some flour on top so the dough didn't stick as much (to my rolling pin). I rolled the dough out on parchment paper. It was a little bit harder doing it that way, as I used one hand to hold parchment paper down and the other to roll out the dough. Turned out fine and made it easy to transfer to the pan and when cleaning up!?? I made my own garlic parmesean olive oil sauce, instead of tomato sauce. Added monzerella cheese, turkey pepperoni and fresh basil leaves. Tasted quite yummy and had lots of flavor! The basil after cooking though was very shriveled up and barely there. I guess next time I'll just add it a minute or two before the pizza is done. 


2. Doubled this next attempt below and definitely made way more pizza than the first try, which was more of a personal size to a medium pizza.
Did the pizza crust the last time, just regular, no spices. Plain pepperoni, tomato sauce and cheese pizza. It was good, but not as good as the first. Did taste more bisquitty. For some reason, the shredded cheese didn't melt like it should have. It was kinda piecey towards the bottom and wasn't as hot. But I al

Great recipe. I used no-aluminum baking powder, as it tastes less bitter to me. I also kneaded it with my stand mixer until the dough pulled away from the dough hook. I think those that thought the dough was too wet, just have to knead it longer. I didn't add any additional flour.
I wanted super-thin crust, so cut the dough in half and made 2 pizzas. It worked out good.

Only change I made was omitting the salt (I have high blood pressure). Tasted fine for me, but I can see how it would be bland for others. One crust was perfect to share with my husband. Definitely will make this gain!

I made this recipe because I didn't have yeast one day and it was so fantastic made just as the recipe states. When I finally got yeast I made a different pizza dough recipe and both my husband and I prefer this one, so now it's our go to pizza dough. So easy and tasty!

More of  a 3.5 rating for me. Made it according to recipe. By far the densest pizza crust . It almost has a hard roll type feel/texture.FWIW though I spread it by hand and got nowhere near 12" before it starting tearing.  Taste was bland but adding herbs and spices is an easy fix for that. Will try again and actually roll it and add spices and herbs.

I've made this a few times to make my homemade pizza. I've perfected the flavor and consistency over time. I use a full cup of milk because 1/3 is not enough for me, more salt, and olive oil, which I also spread lightly on the bottom of the pan. I use a round unperforated pizza pan and squash the dough down into the pan to take it's shape, making sure to spread out past the edges so I can roll the excess into a nice crust. Poke everywhere with a fork to keep it from puffing up all humpbacked in the oven.I bake it for 10 minutes at 350° and it makes a delicious deep dish pizza crust!

This was great AND easy. As many suggested, I added spices to the dough. Garlic powder, oregano, Italian seasoning, and rosemary. I had to add a dash extra milk, but it turned out great. I doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers. I think next time I will roll it thinner, it seemed a little too doughy for me on the bottom. All in all, a keeper for sure.

Made as instructed. I cut the pre-bake short a couple of minutes. Very simple and good. Next time I think I may add some basil to the dough to sweeten it up just a bit.

Very easy and good.  I too added some garlic powder to the crust before baking.  Rolled out beautifully with a little extra flour on the pizza stone and on the  rolling pin!  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!!!

Pretty good and easy and quick. I like that these are all ingredients that I have on hand. I added some garlic powder and Italian seasonings and sprayed with olive oil before cooking and turned out great. This will be my go-to pizza crust.

We used this for calzones as suggested in another review.  The crust was just as it was supposed to be with the ingredients listed.  It was a little bland, but nothing some Italian seasoning, garlic and parmesan wouldn't help :)

This was an excellent basic recipe! 

It can easily be spiced up along your preferences - I added garlic, basil, and thyme right into the dough - it was sooo good, and I look forward to experimenting with different flavour combinations. 

One issue I had was that the dough was a little dry, had to add some water. 

Aside from that, this recipe really makes making pizza a cinch. Thank you Missy!

I made this tonight because I don't keep yeast around. I didn't pre-bake but will next time as the center was a bit soft. Not doughy, just soft. I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning to give it some extra flavor. That's the only change I made. I covered it with sauce and toppings and baked for about 13 minutes at 425 degrees. The family loves it. Husband said it was the best homemade pizza he'd had. We used Classico for the pizza sauce.

This is by far the easiest and best no yeast pizza crust I have ever used!!  Follow the recipe for a no fail, light and soft/crisp crust.  I add Italian seasoning, garlic powder and greated parmesan cheese right into the flour mix.  If you do this you will want to add a Tbsp extra of milk.

This pizza dough was quick & easy. It was easy to roll out too. My husband liked it but thought it was a little too biscuit like in texture. I will use again because it is a good dough to use when you don't have a lot of time. I did add garlic & Italian seasoning to the dough mixture for flavor. Overall it made a good pizza in a short time. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

It was my first time making a pizza dough, so for my first time it came out pretty good. However, it was a bit salty for my taste( even after I added a teaspoon of brown powder sugar), so next time I will only add a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt. Other than that I have no complaints. I didn't have milk so I substituted it with 1/2 a cup of water and 1/2 a cup of evaporated milk; resulting in a perfectly soft, semi-sponge like crust.

This was one  of the best pizzas I made. I made four small pizza from the dough. It was easy. I made a veggie pizza...green  peppers, black olives, onion, spinach,  mozzarella and parmesan cheese. 
I grill the dough then added my veggies then cheese and put it in the oven for 16 minutes. I is sooo good. 
After eating this fresh pizza you will never buy one of those store frozen card board pizza any more.

Used this recipe to make a gluten free pizza crust; I used gluten free all purpose flour. This was a nice alternative to a yeast crust, and I was able to make it with ingredients I already had. Came out well. Will likely use again.

Very easy, and was done in 10 minutes at 450 as another reviewer suggested, but was tasteless.
