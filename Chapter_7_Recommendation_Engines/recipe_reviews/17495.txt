This is a great recipe for sausage gravy.  I do make mine slightly different though.  First, I don't add the bacon grease because I feel mine has more than enough.  With the sausage in the pan I will add the flour, then the milk and spices.  I also really prefer mine with sage sausage to give it a little more flavor.  Maple sausage doesn't taste quite right though.

I made this to go over J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits and it was sooo good.  I didn't use the bacon grease, as my sausage was greasy enough.  I added a hefty dose of ground black pepper...it gives the gravy such a good flavor!!  Mind didn't reheat well, so next time we'll either eat it all or have to make a smaller batch.  Thanks Rene.

It seems almost everyone changes this recipe to fit their own taste and I'm no exception... I have made this exactly as written and also with a few changes. First I'll review this without changes. The first thing I noticed was that this does not make eight servings. If you are making this for biscuits and gravey, the recipe will makes only two servings. I make this for myself using half the recipe and gobble it up myself!  Second, it is just a tad bland but can easily be fixed by starting with a sausage with more spice. The changes that I've made are to saute some onions with the sausage and added several dashes of warchestershire sause to give it a little more zip. I also add a little of Jonny's Seasoning Salt. When I have no bacon grease, I use butter instead. I grew up in the South and had biscuits and gravy 'most every morning so I consider myself an expert gravy taster and I give this one five stars. :-)

I made this for my husband today (huge fan of sausage gravy over biscuits from restaurants) and he absolutely LOVED it.  Easy to make too.  I substituted butter for bacon grease, used skim milk and Italian seasoned pork sausage.  Wonderful flavor.  Will make again and again! Try J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits with this gravy.  You can't go wrong!

Know I'll sound like a broken record...but this really is THE best!  The only gravy I'll ever use from now on for biscuits n' gravy!  Made this for my father's birthday brunch.  After I prepared it put it in a crockpot to keep it warm and everyone just ladled it out onto hot biscuits.  The bacon grease is the secret to the flavor of this gravy.  My only change was to add quite a bit of salt and pepper.  We love it so much we eat it for a quick supper all the time.  We cook frozen biscuits in the oven and cook a bag of shredded hashbrowns while we're making the gravy.  (We put the hashbrowns on top of the biscuits then ladle the gravy over all.)  Mmmmm, mmmm!

I think this is very good. I lived in Tenn. and make my exactly like this only using equal parts of can milk, to equal parts of water. I love it that way, and it is a little richer flavored..has a Bob Evans tastes. My girlfriend use to make her gravy with milk, and she'd say, why don't my gravy tastes like yours? It's the can milk. But both ways are very good. yummy

I have been making this recipe for 5 years now and it is still the best one. I love this recipe. It is so, so good. I wouldn't change anything and I will not use any other sausage gravy recipe. I love to cook and I only keep the really good ones. This is for sure a keeper. Thank you so much.

This was very good sausage gravy!  I used Jimmy Deans sausage which didn't have as much grease as I expected (and I didn't have bacon grease on hand), but it still turned out wonderfully!  This gravy actually tasted like sausage, instead of those plain white "gravies" with sausage thrown in at the end.

YUM!  I miss biscuits & gravy, and now I don't have to!!  This was close to my mothers recipe (hers is a bit thicker & spicier), next time I too will try the hot sausage.  Thanks for sharing Rene!

I, born and bred in the south, think most of us with the same heritage have this recipe written in our veins.  But for those who do not, then this is the perfect road to take. You can't go wrong.  Assuredly, it is heart attack waiting to happen, but if you go while eating this then you are sure to meet St. Peter with a smile on your face.

This is almost the way i grew up eating gravy. U don't need extra grease. U can have bacon gravy, sausage gravy, red eye, whatever. The point is for the gravy to have the flavor of the meat. For a small family I use 1/2 roll of mild country sausage (like Tennessee Pride), brown and crumble in iron skillet, then add "about" 2 large tbsp of flour and a dash of ground black pepper, let that get good and brown (but don't burn it) and turn down your eye to low add milk while stirring. If it's too thick, add more milk and keep stirring on very low heat. You don't want your skillet boiling at any point - you will just end up with a mess. If you want bacon gravy do the same, just heat up 2 tbsp bacon grease and follow the rest. Hope this helps someone.

Really, really good! I used butter because I did not have any bacon grease on hand. But I would love to try using it one day. I accidentally added 1/3 instead on 1/4 cup flour so I added more salt, onion powder, and sage to get rid of the flour-y taste. If i make it again I am going to use sage ground pork instead of the plain stuff but it was still fantastic with the plain stuff. I would make this again for sure.

I make sausage gravy often but I don't brown the flour mixture, tried browning and just didn't like it as well.  I use butter instead of bacon grease.  Pour over biscuits and add an egg or two on top for a very satisfying meal.

I totally messed up and bought Italian sausage.  It was also turkey sausage since that's just what I always buy.  I figured what the heck, we'll try the Italian Sausage.  I'm glad I did.  The flavor, even with all those spices, wasn't overpowering at all.  I'm afraid it would have been kind of bland had I used regular sausage.  This was really good and thick and rich.  I'd make it again.

I am continuously surprised that recipes that are nothing special get such high reviews. This is good but not great. Needs LOTS of extra salt and pepper, very very bland without. I might use the recipe again but I'm wondering if I should bother because the packaged kind (McCormick) the grocery stores sells tastes better, is quicker, and cheaper to prepare!! This recipe is overrated.

First time ever making biscuits and gravy, this recipe is a keeper.  My southern raised husband RAVED.  His granny used to make everything from scratch and he's grown up with these types of meals.  Made it EXACTLY as posted and will do again.

Absolutely the best sausage gravy. This recipe replaced my standard. I serve it over scratch buttermilk biscuits and it is heavenly. When I don't have bacon fat, I substitute butter. It works beautifully.

Not a recipe for those watching their weight or cholesterol, but fantastic. I add extra pepper and then a bit of maple syrup. This is always a hit in my house.

I am the original poster of this recipe, (long ago lost my password and username ID, so am now using this one) and I must say I am overwhelmed (but not surpised) by all the great reviews!  This truly is the very best recipe there is, and it is so easy!  A few tips for you, though.  The salt and pepper amounts I listed in this recipe are only a guide...certainly, you can adjust them to your own taste.  Also, I traditionally use Jimmy Dean sage sausage to make this, but the Maple flavor also makes it delicious.  One last thing...to truly get the taste of the "South" be sure to pass the Tabasco sauce!  But use it sparingly if your taste buds are faint of heart!  Enjoy, and thanks for so many wnoderful comments!

Awsome! The only thing I change to suit my taste buds was to double the amount of black pepper (fresh ground).

My husband said, "this was exactly the way it tastes when I order it from a restaurant."  However, I had to modify the recipe to get that taste.  The gravy was so incredibly thick and rather bland.  I added extra bacon grease, extra pepper, and extra milk.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Delish! I've made "my own" sausage gravy for years by the old throw some flour in with the sausage and then add milk and this is basically what this is.  I had never added bacon drippings though.  I tripled the recipe and got a little heavy handed with the bacon drippings so though a good gravy, the bacon flavor was more prominent than I'd have liked. Not bad flavor, but not as sausagey. I use Tennesee Pride sausage and it's rather mild so used a good half a palmful of sage and as other readers commented, the sage really added some good flavor.  I had some evaporated milk that needed to be used to I threw that in along with my skim milk and it bumped up the creamyness and flavor.  All in all, this is a keeper.  Hubby enjoyed it for brunch and just came back (it's 7:30 PM) and just grabbed a bowl of it.  The rest will go in the freezer for an quick meal another day.

My favorite sausage gravy recipe of all time!  The grease makes all the difference.  I added 2 tbs butter and about 1/2 tsp more salt and it was perfect.

I just came back from a trip down South and tried this for the first time and I couldnt stop thinking about it!  I found this recipe but made a few changes based on reviews, I didnt have bacon fat so I just went without it and it turned out fine.  I also added 2 cups of milk instead of three because I like it a little bit thicker, but that means it comes out to less than 8 servings.  I added a few dashes of Worcestershire and maple syrup and a dash of sage and it was unbelievable!!  Thank you!

Delicious!!!  Traditional southern sausage gravy.  I used 1/2 milk 1/2 water due to lactose intolerance in the household and it is still GOOD sausage gravy.

My husband, 5 yr old and 2 yr old loved this recipe. The only change I made was to use 1 lb sage sausage with 1/2 lb plain ground sausage and increased the other ingredients to match 1 1/2 lbs of pork. I also subbed butter for the bacon grease. A delicious, easy meal--especially if you use refrigerated biscuits. Thanks for the recipe!

Soooo good!!  I substituted margarine for the bacon grease and it still turned out magnificiently.  It got rave reviews at our college house dinner!  First time I ever made sausage gravy too.  I also added more pepper to give it more of a kick and more white sauce to tune down the savoriness since the sausage itself already had plenty of salt, so if you buy pre-mixed sausage, like Jimmy Dean's, I would recommend not adding the additional 1/2 tsp of salt or add more white sauce.  My mouth's watering just thinking about it!  :D

Once I tweaked the salt and pepper, it tasted JUST right!  And it's fun to eat the bacon while you're working on the rest of it.

The recipe was good but not the best I've had.  I would not add 3 T of bacon grease.  2 T would be enough (maybe even 1 T would be enough).  The bacon grease does add to the flavor so don't forget it (butter isn't the same).  Also, I would add about 1/4 to 1/2 t. of a spice (thyme, sage (my favorite) or rosemary) or use sage sausage to give it a little more flavor.  I also cook my sausage pretty dark as another tester said.  This recipe is very easy to make.  However, like another tester said, it definitely doesn't make 8 servings--more like 2.5.  It is definitely good though.  (I needed to add a little more milk to make it less thick.)  Sure is easy to make, and the gravy is not lumpy or greasy.  (It is definitely all the grease/fat you'll want in a day, but you don't eat biscuits and gravy for health reasons.  You eat it for pleasure!)  *G*  Use Big Daddy's Biscuits with this.  You'll love the results!

Sausage gravy is so simple... This recipe is with a little extra work.  Brown the sausage, (really dark) If you can get a few hunks very dark, the better. If you have grease in the bottom of your skillet, do not add bacon grease. I use Oldhams sausage and it is very dry. Add flour and then cook and stir until the flour is turning just tan in color. In the mean time get the bowl you want to serve the gravy in and fill it almost full of milk. When the sausage is ready, turn up the heat and add milk. Stir constantly, until thick. Use a cold spoon and dip it into the gravy and taste it for thickness and spices.

This recipe was pretty easy, it was the first time I'd ever made gravy and it turned out pretty perfect.  The only problem was that I had to spice it up because it was a little bland.  However, it gave me a great base recipe for my first time.

This was very good however I prefer to add a clove or two of fresh minced garlic for extra flavor.  After reviewing other sausage gravy recipes, I also added butter vs. bacon grease because I didn't have bacon grease.  I think the butter gave the gravy an unappealing greasy appearance that sat on the top.  I will omit the butter/bacon grease all together next time.  Who knew, after all these years that I should be adding the flour directly to the hot grease?  I typically would shake flour and water in a small canister before adding because I was always told this prevents lumpy gravy.  After making this gravy, I discovered that step was unnecessary!

This was very good and very easy to make - I used only 2 cups of milk and 1/2 lb of sausage to scale it down a bit and it was enough gravy for me and my husband to have it for two breakfasts in a row.  Also, I did not have bacon grease so I used 2 tbsp of butter and I did not add any salt (sausage was salty enough for our taste).  We made it to go over JP's Big Daddy biscuits (from this site) and it made for a great breakfast.  I will never buy the gravy mix from the store again. :)

This recipe is the best just how it is! I've made it before and it's totally a 5 star! But holy cow...the last time I made it, I added garlic like how another viewer suggested...and it was NG, no good.  The garlic totally ruins that "homemade biscuits and gravy taste."  DO NOT add garlic if you want that good home-cookin taste!  :)  Just to let you know. Thank you, goodbye.

This is a Sunday morning tradition in my family. I use Jimmy Dean sage sausage, omit the bacon grease (I never have it), and I have definitely earned an extra special place in my family's heart with this breakfast, brunch and sometimes even dinner meal. Thank you, thank you!

This is a wonderful "first step" to really good sausage gravy but on its own it is very basic and very bland.  When I had finished doctoring, I was very pleased.  I can't rate the original recipe more than 2 stars.  To rate the gravy that I ended up with after my own additions would be misleading.

I make a different version of this recipe. When I fry my sausage I add a heaping tablespoon of flour to the meat after it is almost done along with one clove of garlic diced. One large can of evaporated milk and one cup of water to make a gravy. Add pepper to taste. Serve over toast.

This is the most delicious sausage gravy I've ever had!  I used real butter instead of bacon grease and a 12oz pkg of maple sausage.  Was the bomb!  This is coming from someone who couldn't make gravy for the life of him!  Add more pepper than recipe calls for.

Excellant easy to make gravy. Especially good over biscuits. Easily adaptable to flavorings of your choice to fit the occasion or your whims.

I have loved this meal since childhood but have never tried making it myself, until tonight.  I recently started saving a little bacon grease in the fridge (keeps very well in a sealed container), so I chose this recipe due to that ingredient.  I followed the recipe closely, but did add a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce and a sprinkle of sage along with the salt and pepper.  Made refrigerated biscuits this time, for convenience sake.  Turned out "Fabulous", to quote my 17yo son.  Thanks for sharing, definitely a keeper for us.

This is the best sausage and gravy recipe I have found. It's key to use the bacon grease. I typically double the batch because everyone in my house gobbles it up. Very good flavor and consistency.

Although this isn't very healthy, I would not change a thing! I have been making this recipe for almost five years now and it's delicious. You need to use the bacon grease. It adds a lot of flavor that you won't have by leaving it out or subsituting it with anything like butter. Also, take the sausage out of the pan before adding the flour. I always remove any meat before making a roux - then add the meat back in when the mixture has been thickened. A roux should never be made with meat in the pan - only meat drippings. I highly suggest following this recipe as stated. Due to the high fat content we certainly don't have this often, but when we do I never change a thing!

I am from Nashville and can tell you this IS Southern gravy for buscuits.  Stop not adding the bacon grease, your cheating your taste buds!!  Oh, and NEWSFLASH, it's gonna be bland if you don't add pepper.  It's the pepper and sausage together that really give this a great flavor.  If you can't get REAL country sausage (which is made on farms and comes usually in sackcloth) then may I suggest Tennessee Pride country sausage.  We don't use sage or "I" talian sausage but I suppose to each their own.  Thanks for a super recipe that even an ole country boy isn't too lazy to make for his new bride!!

I have made this twice, and both times my boyfriend stands over the stove expectantly until it's ready. He loves it because his family in Virginia makes sausage gravy just like this and he hasn't found anything like it outside of Virginia. I use butter instead of bacon grease because it's handy. I also put one and a half teaspoons of black pepper in this instead of 1/4 teaspoon.

I'm sorry but this recipe just did not meet my expectations.  I made it exactly as stated, even adding more salt and pepper, and it was very bland and needed something more.  I had to add seasoning salt, garlic powder, and sage to give it any kind of flavor.  I guess it is a good base recipe though and I will probably make it again, but just adding more seasoning.

Excellent Recipe!! I doubled it, and used only 1 lb. Jimmy Dean sage sausage. I added about 1/2-1 tablespoon of Worchestershire sauce along with plenty of pepper and salt to taste. My first time ever making sausage gravy, and I'm happy with it:)

This was delicious.  I used butter in place of bacon grease and I used sage flavored sausage. Also added approx. 1/4 tsp. sage.

I thought this was a great base recipe.  I took all of the advice of the previous posters and make some changes as well.  First, instead of just pork sausage, I used half hot sausage.  To make this recipe to my taste, I added 2 bouillion cubes and a few dashes of worchestershire sauce.  I totally ommitted the salt, not needed with the bouillion and natural saltiness of the sausage.  I didn't have bacon grease, so I used butter.  If you don't use the hot sausage, I suggest you add a few dashes of hot sauce, but not both.  This was excellant, I've made it three times in the last week and a half, as good as I remember my Grandmother's!

This is an excellent, tasty recipe.  I made it for the first time three years ago for our family Christmas breakfast and it was an instant hit.   Now it's part of our yearly menu.  I found that at times I have to add more salt, depending on where I bought the sausage, but that can easily be tested by the cook.   It works well making it a couple of hours ahead of time and putting it in a crockpot until ready to serve.

Keep in mind that I was going to give this a 3, but my sister thought it was pretty good and my dog devoured all the leftovers, so 4 it is.  Anyhow, I thought this was whatever.  I actually LOVE southern food, but this one was a disappointment.  I made this as directed and even when it was simmering, I threw in the bacon I cooked and let it simmer in it for added flavor.  Anyhow, it was mediocre.  Second time I made this, I used hot sausage, no bacon or it's dripping and cooked this the fast way (cooked sausage over skillet, added milk/flour in the skillet and stirred virgorously).  I actually thought the second one tasted better.  Anyhow, I'm not making this again.

This gravy was WONDERFUL!  I made it for a multicultural day at my school - representing the American South.  I actually quadrupled the recipe, and then kept it warm in a crock pot for three hours, and it was STILL wonderful.  This is EXACTLY what I think of when I think of good sausage gravy, and it wasn't hard to make at all!

My honey is the pickiest when it comes to sausage gravy....he says this is better than restaurant gravy!! I make it with a pound of Jones' farm light sausage, and a little extra butter to give it a rich, but not too greasy consistency. I even like it!!!

I made this recipe for a work potluck...it was a certifiable hit!  I kept it warm in a crockpot for a good 3-4 hours, and it still tasted wonderful.  I used skimmed milk and half and half when making this, and added the crumbled bacon from my fat-making.  Really a simple, but delicious recipe!

Anyone who tried this and doesn't like it, must not like sausage gravy.  Even though I didn't take the sausage out of the skillet first, (didn't read recipe thoroughly), it still turned out GREAT, my husband is in heaven and my 5 kids all love it!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Wonderful!  We used butter instead of bacon fat and used garlic salt for the salt.  Prepare everything and then salt and pepper to taste.  Turned out great over biscuits.  Thanks!

Although this is a good base, without seasonings it is as bland as all get-out. I referred to other sausage gravy recipes and added sage, thyme, Worchester sauce and plenty of freshly ground pepper and salt.

Yummy!  I substituted the bacon fat with butter and the ground meat with Morningstar Crumbles since I am a vegetarian.  It has a wonderful flavor and very easy to make.  I don't have kids, but my parents loved it!!

Made this this morning for Christmas breakfast. So delicious. A great way to start out the morning! I also crisped up a little bacon and added that to the gravy. The more meat the better!

I rated this 5 stars even though I'm one of "those" ppl that add some extra seasonings, etc. This is a great base for standard sausage gravy though! It all depends on what kind of sausage you use as well. I generally use Tennessee Pride Sage flavor in a roll. I remove the cooked sausage and press the grease out through a mesh strainer back into the skillet (cast iron of course). I wind up sauteing a couple Tblsp of minced onion in the grease and cook the flour in that until it's a nice light tan color. I normally only add 1 T of bacon grease to have enough for the roux process. I like to add a bit of thyme, grnd coriander, grated nutmeg and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. I add back in however much of the cooked sausage I'm in the mood for. Sometimes all if it, sometimes only half. Either way I freeze any leftovers and it works alright for me. The recipe as written is good; add more "stuff" if you want a lil more flavor :)

I made this following the recipe exactly.  It came out great.  I actually needed the bacon grease because my sausage wasn't very fatty (I used sage pork sausage from local farm - antibiotic free, etc.) But man, it turned out great.   My husband loved it, I loved it.  I will make this again.  yum.  thanks. 
(Next time I might just crumble that bacon up and throw it on in as well... mmmmmm.... bacon)

Just made this for a lazy sunday morning breakfast. Wonderful. I did use the bacon grease. My 2 year old loves bacon so I gave it to her to eat. I made a half batch since it would only be 3 of us eating it.  I added more salt and pepper then called for. It was fast and filling! Easy also! I will make this camping this summer.

Absolutely wonderful! I used turkey sausage, substituted transfat-free margarine for the bacon grease, used 1% milk and left out the salt(hubbie's on a heart-healthy diet). With a bit of sage for added seasoning, this was a dish we all enjoyed. Might try half white and half whole wheat flour for the roue next time.

We've been using this recipe for many generations now and it comes out perfect every time. We also like to top fried pork chops with it. If you can put gravy on it, this one goes with it! It's our all-purpose gravy. Even my northern in-laws who don't eat much gravy, let alone real gravy, love this one!

I am a B&G conessiuer and this is a pretty gopod recipe.  I use 1 TBSL of butter instead of the bacon grease.  I use maple sausage.  I also use a can of evaporated milk and 2 cups of regular milk.  Also add a pinch of garlic powder and a pinch of cayeene pepper.  Maybe not so much downhome but definitely GOURMET!

Hmmm I made this for breakfast yesterday and it came out real good. In fact, it tastes so much better than those fast food restaurant chain that I've been to!. I halved the recipe though since there's only me and my husband, even that we still had leftovers.

I fried up 6 slices of bacon to get my bacon grease. After I had all contents in frying pan and was stirring, I took the cooked bacon slices threw them in the blender and chopped to bacon bits then added it to the gravy. Made this for men's breakfast at church. It was such a hit it was requested for next breakfast.

I thought this recipe turned out absolutely wonderful!  I had been craving this for so long.  My husband had never had it since we live on the West Coast in BC.  He was in love!  I used margarine instead of bacon grease and it turned out perfect!  I also added just a pinch of cayenne and it really gave it a wonder flavor.

Now this is some good eatin'  I add just a bit of sage, maybe a 1/4 tsp or so and a splash of pickapeppa sauce when I make this.  This doesn't make eight servings though, unless of course you're only having one biscuit, but who can have only one biscuit.

I am no expert on sausage gravy, but this is the best that I have ever had. I have used bacon grease like the recipe calls for and I have also substituted butter and I actually prefer it that way. My husband, who is not big on white gravy of any kind, actually complimented me on this. 
I am pregnant and the first time I made this I was in HEAVEN! I think I made it two other times that week for myself. 
Thank you so much for the recipe!

It tasted fine. If I were to make this again I would leave out the bacon grease. There was way too much grease floating on the top of the gravy for my tastes.

It was a little harder than it probably should've been.  I cooked the sausage well.  When I took it out of the pot, the bottom was covered with the drippings and oil from the sausage (I made a lot).  However it was burning and sticking to the pot slightly.  I whisked in the flour and it sort of caked up quickly and didn't really form a smooth roux-like mixture.  I stirred it as long as I could but I had to scoot it all to one side pretty quickly in order to deglaze the burnt stuff.  I used cooking sherry and deglazed but I had to let it sit for a couple of minutes to boil out the alcohol and leave behind the brown glaze.  The i scooted the mixture back to the other side, mixed with the glaze and repeated deglazing the other side of the pot.  Uggh... by this time the mixture was pretty brown but I felt like the flour hadn't actually cooked enough so I continued cooking it for a while longer.  Finally I added the milk and followed the rest of the instructions as written.  In the end, there was no taste of the sherry (because I cooked out all the alcohol) and it turned out to be amazing.  You do have to add plenty of salt and pepper but when you finally get the flavor right, it tastes so good!  This was my first time successfully making gravy.  lol.  I've never made good homemade gravy.  This was a first.  Thanks for reading this far.  Hope you all had a chuckle :) True story.

2 25 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/17495/sausage-gravy-i ... I read through so many recipes & they're all very similar.  This one I liked because there wasn't one "to taste" measurement!  If four of the five ingredients - sausage being the one that isn't - are listed as "to taste," that  isn't  too helpful if it's your first time making it,  Experience with gravy or thickening, yes; but - anyway, I appreciate it having amounts.  I used my regular white gravy recipe as a guide, reduced salt to 1/4t.  Three cups of milk would usually require 2T per cup.  'Thinking the sausage would"help," I didn't increase to the full amount; increased to 1/3c.  Amazingly, I didn't have grease in the pan so added 2 1/2T butter.  I know this sounds like a lot of changes.  They're minor & probably don't make that much difference.  As I was adding the milk, I though it was too much - too thin - so stopped at 2 1/2c.  After cooking, I realized a half cup more would've been fine.  Mine wasn't too thick with the lesser amount though.  To sum up, these were fine; very filling.  I may be more of a "If there's gravy, gravy-on-it-rather-than-under-it type person."  Glad I tried.  Thanks, Rene!

This is how I make my sausage gravy as well. I simply fry a pound of bacon and then remove about half of the bacon grease from the skillet. I then fry my sausage in the bacon grease. If you buy a good lean sausage, it will not be too greasy. Bob Evans is very lean. I buy mine in bulk from a local butcher shop though. I always add a little sage as well. Very, very good.

This is a great recipe!!
Being young and new at cooking, I experiment a lot. This is the first heavy recipe I had ever tried and it came out so wonderfully, I've been playing with it since.
I have a few secret ingredients that I've added.  Butter, red pepper, and try adding turkey sausage.  Yum yum!!

This was great, I can't imagine how amazing it would have been if I had used bacon grease, unfortunately I only had butter.  Still delicious though.  I made it with the Kentucky biscuits recipe from this site, amazing breakfast.  Thanks!

AWESOME GRAVY!!! My husband (who is a sausage gravy snob) said this is the BEST sausage gravy he has ever tasted! Not too salty, not too greasy, just perfect! The second time I made it I used maple flavored sausage, and it was out of this world!!!! Thank you for sharing!

I loved this! I made this for my husband, my 15 yr old son, and his two friends. They all came back for seconds and thirds! I used Jimmy Dean sausage which left almost no grease, so the bacon grease was a must. Also, I added a little more flour because I like a thicker gravy. At the end I felt it needed more flavor (maybe because of the lack of sausage grease, I don't know), so I added some seasoning salt along with fresh ground black pepper. The seasoning salt was the trick. It tasted great! To reheat, just put it back in a pan, add a little milk or cream, and stir. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Just the taste I had been looking for.  The bacon grease really gave it a great smell and taste, and the consistency turned out perfect.  This is the best homemade sausage gravy I have ever had.

I used margarine instead of the bacon grease, too, and it turned out good. I added a little more flour while it cooked and simmered for about 10 minutes.

Came out delicious. I made this with my homemade biscuits and they loved it.

I had to simmer it a lot longer then the recipe called for however to get it to the desired thickness however.

Simple but excellent.  I usually double up and make enough for later in the week.  When I do I use 1 lb of mild and 1 lb of hot sausage for that little bit of spicy flavor.   I too omit the bacon grease.

This recipe has been a favorite of our family ever since we first tried it.  The bacon grease is a must.  We make this recipe at least once a month.  Thanks for posting and sharing it.

Add 2 T cornstarch to the recipe and S&P to taste/lots
Pretty good. I used a roll of JD sausaged. Cooked 2 pieces of bacon with it and left it with the sausage. I had to add a little water while Icooked it. I also, added 2Tcornisharch (1st in cold water) to thicken. It was good. Next time I will serve ocer Biscuits, not toast and use store made sausage. Great Recipe!

I've made this quite a few times, and seem to change it every time. If you don't have bacon grease on hand, more butter is a good substitute. I tried it with white pepper one time, and the taste seemed off, so I wouldn't recommend that. All in all, it's a recipe I love.

Wonderful!! This is my second attempt at making sausage gravy and I was really impressed. However, I didn't have any bacon grease so I just used some butter and a dab of oil. I added some garlic and onion powder, per my husband request. Really good.

Fantastic!  The bacon drippings make all the difference in the flavor.  I'm very picky about my sausage gravy.  Most taste flavorless and blah to me.  But not this one.  This one is rich and delicious.  I might add more pepper and less sausage next time, but this is the best gravy recipe I've ever made.  Mmmmmmm.....

Very simple and delicious.  I used 1lb. turkey sausage, omitted the bacon grease (didn't have any on hand), and replaced it with a tablespoon of water and two tablespoons vegetable oil.

Next time I'm going to try this with a little bit of diced onion and maybe some green bell pepper.

Great gravy! I left the pork in patties and just added the grease to this b/c I really don't like sausage. I did up the black pepper a lot as we love peppered gravy. Thanks Rene, this is almost the same recipe my Mom taught me to make milk gravy with years ago. Only difference is mom used equal amounts of grease and flour. Wonderful comfort food! I'm glad to see this posted.

I tried this, this past Sunday for company from out of town.  I used what I had on hand which was ground up Italian Sausage.  After reading other reviewes I also used butter since I had no bacon and also omitted the salt.  They loved it, as I am not a breakfast person, I also had some and have to say, this was really good.  Thanks so much for the post.

My husband was very pleased with this!  He grew up in the south and so he knows good sausage gravy when he gets it.  I planned on using only half the pound of sausage after reading others' reviews but then promptly forgot when I added the cooked sausage to the gravy!  Oops!  And it was too much sausage.  That is the reason for the four stars instead of five.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will REMEMBER to only add half a pound of sausage!  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe! Tasted just like what my grandmother used to make.  Only thing was I increased the amount of gravy, otherwise a little too much sausage.  Thanks Rene

I have been looking for a good sausage gravy recipe, something that could stand up to my grandmother's.  This was a close second!  I followed the recipe exact, and I did find that there was more sausage than gravy, so next time, I will be sure to double the gravy part of the recipe.  Oh, and I did add a little sugar(that's one of my grandmother's secrets!) and some kitchen bouqet to give it a little color.  Turned out great - will definitely make this one again.

I have to admit, my dad makes the best gravy ever ... but this came in to a close second! Delicious! I used sage sausage and added a few drops of hot sauce at the end. I also added more salt (because I'm a salt addict) but ... yes, very very good. Next time I'll try making it with hot sausage! Yum!

We loved this recipe.  Used butter instead of bacon grease but will use it in the future.  Will also try with a variety of saugages.  Husband & sons loved it with J.P.'s biscuit recipe from this website.

This seemed just like sausage gravy I've had in southern homes.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  My husband thought there was too much sausage.  Will probably reduce by about a quarter if I make it again.

I made this for breakfast this morning. I served it over homemade biscuits. Honestly, I thought it was a little bland. I had to add quite a few dashes of hot sauce to give it any flavor, and even then it was only so-so. I don't know if I will make it again... not sure it's worth clogging my arteries for. ;) Thanks though!

TOTALLY AWESOME!  My husband calls this "Biscuits & Gravy", all that's added is tea biscuits.  We also make hash browns and eggs with this meal.  It's one of those comfort foods/meals especially in the winter.  Yummy!

I was glad to find this recipe.  I kept forgetting ONE ingredient, until you helped me remember.  Bacon grease.  I had always used just drippings from the sausage!  Thank you, it is good!

This is a great recipie.  The first time I made it, my family absolutely raved about it.  I did think that it was slightly meaty.  The second time I made the gravy I cut the sausage to 3/4 pound and added three strips of bacon torn in little piecies.  Either way, an excellent dish!

Very good and easy homemade sausage gravy. I used italian sausage because I had it left over from lasagna. I had to bacon grease so I did use shortning. I think a little more pepper or maybe some tabasco are in order. But overall great recipe.

Sounds like a broken record, but this was excellent :) Followed this recipe to the "T". Used Jimmy Deans Hot Sausage. Never made it before today. Hubby and son ate it all up, they raved about it. Will use again. Thanks for the super easy recipe. Great for Sunday morning breakfast! Now on to try the Biscuits in the other reviews. Thanks Rene

Loved it!  I had however followed the advice of the prior posting.  I did use about 3/4 cup of onion which I sauteed with my sausage - also I use Jimmy Dean's SAGE sausage - really gives it a nice flavor.  The Worcesthire sauce is a nice touch.  Also - when I use to make I my gravy never turned out thick enough - just realized the secret is the amount of flour!  I love this website!

This recipe is really a wonderful base recipe. I found that I needed more flour than what was called for. I also added more salt. Thankfully I had plenty of bacon grease on hand as sausage generally doesn't render much. Good recipe to start with esp. if you are an experienced cook. You'll know what to do.

I've been looking for a good sausage gravy recipe - that is why I'm so glad I found this one.  We just finished eating my first batch - and we loved it!  I didn't have the bacon greece on hand - so we did without, and never missed it!  Thanks!

Very good recipe. Added a little more salt and pepper. Also used 1/2 lb zesty sausage, 1/2 lb italian sausage and 1/2 lb regular sausage.  Also addes a little more milk until the thickness we like. A great base to start with. Thanks!

Left out the bacon grease and didn't simmer for the 15 minutes. Add salt and pepper to suit your tastes. I also used a combination of heavy cream/milk instead of milk by itself.

Wonderful....I loved it, as did my family!  Only change I will make next time is to add a bit more milk and flour to make a little more gravy.  It was about 50-50 on the gravy and sausage and I prefer there be a bit more gravy.  I also recommend adding a bit more salt and pepper.  This recipe is great though, really loved it!
OH, I used butter in place of bacon grease as well since I didn't feel like frying the bacon.

Fabulous!! I used pre-cooked links cut up in a pinch and butter instead of bacon grease, & it was still very flavorful. I served it over hashbrowns.

Very Yummy gravy. I followed the recipe as is and it came out great. Next time I will try a spicy or maple flavored sausage with this. Made this with J.P.'s Big Daddy biscuits. Soooooo good. I always wanted to make my own biscuits and gravy and now i have found the perfect combo.

Being raised on a farm, I grew up on sausage gravy like this, and the only thing I do differently is sometimes I replace 1/4 cup milk with 1/4 cup evaporated milk.  It gives the gravy a smoother texture and a nice body to it.  If you add butter instead of bacon grease, use BUTTER not margarine.  It makes it so much richer tasting, but the bacon grease really is the best for flavoring.

This was a good tasting recipe as long as it was eaten right away.  I made this for a buffet and after a few minutes (7-8) it seperated and looked greasy, however it did not taste greasy.  I would make this for "home" but not for guests.

I didn't enjoy this gravy as much as I thought I would.  Maybe the sausage I bought was poor quality, but the gravy turned out oily and lumpy and tasteless.  I don't recommend this recipe.

I found this recipe about 4 years ago and have been using it ever since. I made this without the bacon grease once and it just didn't taste as good. Whenever I cook bacon I save the grease and store it in the fridge. That way I have it on hand when I need it. I increase the amount of salt to about 3/4 tsp and the pepper to about 1/2 tsp. I usually serve it over biscuits for breakfast but it's also good on mashed potatoes and chicken fried stead. Thanks for sharing this recipe! It's a favorite family favorite.

This was a very easy, very tasty sausage gravy recipe.  I used vegetarian sausage, and just used margarine to melt and mix with the flour.  A keeper, for sure!

Very good recipe. Quick and easy! 
We added diced green pepper and onion along with seasoning salt to enhance the taste. It does seem to be missing something, needs to have a bit of sweetness? Good overall!

Excellent.  I changed the milk.  I used Carnation Evaporated Milk.  Made it easier to make.  Did not scourch nor curtle.  We like it for dinner once in a while.

My hubs is a huge fan of Bisquits and Gravy so I thought I would make this recipe using the leftover bisquits from Thanksgiving! It came out PERFECT! The only thing I did different was I added the bacon I made for the bacon grease!

Pretty close to what we had as kids living on an AFB overseas.  I think the difference is in the acutal sausage, not anything wrong with the recipe.  We enjoyed it.

Good recipe.  But I add the flour directly to the sausage.   I also add about a half tablespoon creole seasoning.

I made it exactly as the recipe says and it's the best sausage gravy I ever made. I thought  it  might  be  too runny, but it thickened up nicely. My husband is a southern  boy and he and our grandchildren loved it!

I added melted butter instead of bacon grease. When I make this again I will add just 1/2 to 2/3 pound of sausage instead of 1 pound. This was a very meaty (but tasty) gravy. There was so much meat that it didn't cover the biscuits as much as I would have liked. I used mild Italian sausage and that added a nice little bite.

This gravy is excellent!  It was a bit greasy though, so next time I may try minimizing the bacon drippings or maybe just forego them entirely.  I added rosemary to the mix for an interesting flavor.

I made this just this morning and it is amazing! It's very similar to the southern gravy I've been making without a recipe (was looking for a recipe so I could make a consistently delicious southern style biscuit gravy). The bacon grease does the trick! Definitely going to make this again . One quick trick, if you butter your biscuits before adding the sausage gravy it makes it taste just like if you'd made this gravy with butter!

I am so happy to have this recipe!   I have never been able to make a good sausage gravy and so easy!  My family loved it.  I made it for dinner and added onion, mushrooms and topped with shredded cheddar.  Served it over fried grits and it was yummy - not a low calorie dinner but every once in awhile you have to just go for it!  Thank you for posting!

Initially,  I madw this recipe as stated. Like another user said it was bland. I just about doubled the pepper and added a little over a tsp. of Worcester. Much better after these additions. Thus 4 stars.

This was quite nice, I think my first time ever making sausage gravy. I made it exactly as written (glad I started saving bacon grease recently!). I had it for three breakfasts, over biscuits. It wasn't quite thick enough to start, and I actually liked the reheated leftovers more. Maybe not the best recipe for this, but I did like it a lot.

Great easy recipe, the only reason I only gave it 4 stars was I did not have bacon grease on hand so I used butter, I think the bacon grease would give it a bit more flavor.

I printed this recipe out years ago and it is the only one I ever use. It's awesome, and my husband raves about it -- and he's had biscuits and gravy in a lot of places!

I love biscuits and gravy and this gravy is fantastic.  Make sure you add the bacon grease and use good sausage.  I tried this recipe with the value brand and it kinda sucked.  Jimmy Dean all the way!  This recipe isn't as fluffy as IHOP's, but it tastes so much better!  Oh, and I sometimes double the milk to make more gravy and it still tastes great!

I was surprised how easy this was to make.  My husband was impressed, which is all I ask for!  He said it could use a little more pepper next time.  I did not add the extra grease and we have extra lean sausage and it was still great.

This is our new "kick off special" I make it every Sunday for the one o'clock game.  It makes a huge batch, is very easy and a huge crowd pleaser over biscuits.  I'd give it the extra stars but it does have a fall back (all the guys glued to my couch).  Don't be afraid of adding little hot sauce or cayenne ;)

This is a great sausage gravy recipe.  The key, I think, is to brown up the flour with the grease.  Great recipe!!

This is just like the sausage gravy recipe I learned from my friend's grandmother when I was a kid.  My mother-in-law also makes it this way.  It's a family tradition.  Now that I have this recipe, I no longer have to guess at the milk to flour ratio!!!!
Thank you, Rene!

This recipe was very easy to make.  My fiance made this and it was his first batch of gravy that he has ever made.  I was not at home when he made it.  I had left the recipe up on the computer(after making big daddys biscuits) and by the time I came home,  wahlah! He had it made! Very simple, very good.  Thank you!

I used spicy sausage, 1 tbsp butter in place of the bacon grease and added 1/4 tsp curry powder to the recipe.  Since I made this for a party for work, I have been told that all other sausage and gravy pales in comparision.

This was amazing, like the others I used butter in place of bacon grease.  I made homemade buttermilk biscuits, which I found on food network's site.  It was a perfect breakfast:)

Made this recipe this morning for my daughter and myself. Very quick and very good. The bacon grease was a little over-powering in the taste though, so I think I'll reduce it down to 2 tbsp. from now on. Definite keeper!

Made this for my husband to take to work with JP's biscuits.  Fast and easy....I didn't have any bacon grease so I added a little oil to have enough fat to mix with the flour.  Cooked it up and threw it in the crockpot so it would stay warm.  Will make again.

This recipe was really easy.  I didn't have any sausage in the house so I used 1/2 lb. ground beef seasoned with thyme instead.  I also didn't use bacon grease...I used margarine instead.  Still turned out great over biscuits.  Thanks!

This was great! It is just my husband and I, so I cut the recipe in half. My only suggestion for cutting in half is to use a smaller skillet, I had a pretty thin layer of liquid on the bottom of the pan because my skillet was so large. Other than that my husband said this was the BEST sausage gravy he had ever eaten! Thanks Rene!

This was a hit, easy to make larger for a large group of teens and just easy in general. 
I made it pretty much as in the recipe (well I never measure anything unless I am baking)but I put my favorite cajun seasoning I put in everything and it added that zip. Thanks for posting.

I loved the recipe however I used a blend of venison and ground pork and the fat content was minimal.  I used an additional tablespoon of bacon fat and it turned out great.  Thanks!

this is good taste pretty much the same as the other recipe I'v tried on here.I did use the bacon grease and then cumbled the bacon I cooked and added it to the gravy also. Also add 3 tbl. of maple syrup. Over all good and I would make it again.

Husband made this; his first attempt at gravy anything.  He said it was easy and delicious!  (I'm not a sausage gravy fan) We halved the recipe and used butter instead of bacon grease and cooked the sausage in the butter, as the kind we use doesn't give off a lot of fat.

I sent my husband to the store to buy bulk sausage, and he came back with Maple flavor. I was worried about that, but added a few crushed garlic cloves and plenty of pepper, as recommended by a previous reviewer, and it was fantastic! Even the kids had seconds! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Great recipe! My husband raved about it! I had to add lots of ground black pepper and some salt for flavor. I also added about 1/2 tsp of butter. I didn't have any sausage on hand, so I made it with ground turkey, and it was DELICIOUS!!

This recipe was pretty good.  Very similar to the gravy recipe that I've been making for years.  I probably won't make this again though.  Thanks.

This was very good.  It reminded me of what I would get back east or in the South.  So yummy!!!  The sausage I used didn't render much fat, so I had to use a whole package of bacon.  I cut it before adding it to the pan and cooked it until done.  I ended up using half the bacon pieces in the gravy (thanks to a suggestion from another poster).  It was great!  Next time, though I think I'll forgo the bacon to make it a tad healthier.

This recipe is fantastic!  I made this for some overnight company.  They couldn't get enough!  I made sure to use really good sausage from the butcher which left me with little drippings.  I used a little extra bacon fat then.  I would make this again in a heart beat!

I have to admit that I am guilty of using the packets of "Just Add Milk" gravy packets from the seasoning isle of the grocery store.  However, since I forgot to buy gravy mix during my last shopping trip, I used this recipe instead.  I substituted 3 Tblsp of margerine for the bacon grease, which worked out just fine , and because the pork sausage is salty enough, in my opinion, I didn't see the need for extra salt.  It turned out great (much better than my cheater gravy packets) and I will be using this recipe again and again!  Of course I cheated and used frozen biscuits, but what can I say?  I'm not a morning person!  Thanks for a great recipe!

very good- added more salt because had to use butter instead of bacon grease as didn't have bacon- perhaps the bacon grease provides the needed salt

It's been so long since I made sausage gravy I had to resort to a recipe....we just don't eat like this anymore. But hubby's been putting in long hours & he loves this kind of thing so while he slept in, I whipped this together & served it to him on top of biscuit halves, of course. To be honest, this was much better than mine ever was ...thanks! (I think ;o) )

Excellent recipe. I used Jimmy Dean's original country sausage, and also tweaked it with a pinch of garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper. Will definately make again, very often.  JDG

Great Recipe!! I used Jimmy Dean country sausage, and there was more than enough flavor!! Plus I upped the amount of gravy a little and it made just the right ratio between gravy and sausage.

This is my new favorite breakfast, thank you Renee! It was my first attempt at making biscuits & gravy & it came out great. The only thing I did differently was to use sage pork sausage and added a few shots of Franks hot sauce at the end. Very tasty!

This is the BEST sausage gravy I have ever had.   I have made it many many times since I found it and everyone who has tried it enjoys it greatly.   I do advise heavily seasoning it

This was really easy and had a pretty good taste.  I think it does need a heavier seasoned sausage than I used, or maybe just some extra seasonings in the gravy.  I did double this recipe just to make sure I had enough, and the little that was left over reheated well if you add just a little milk.

YUMMY!!!  This was a great find.  I have always wanted to make sausage gravy from scratch, this was excellent.  My husband and girls ate it up.  I added a little more salt and pepper.  This is a keeper.   Thanks Rene for submitting it, and to allrecipes.com for a great site.

This is great!  I didn't have bacon grease (I was surprised because I always cook bacon) so I put in a stick of maragine.  I know it looks excessive but this recipe is supposed to be rich and tasty.  When I added 1/4 cup of flour, I knew it wasn't much.  So I added another 1/4 cup of flour and the gravy thickens quite nicely.  I can't imagine why would someone try to eat this gravy wihtout any salt/pepper.  I added a nice amount of pepper and salt to it and it came out almost perfect!

Make sure you use country-style sausage for this recipe.  Mild or Hot, however you fancy it.  The gravy is supposed to be tasty and rich so don't try to skimp on any ingredients.

This is a keeper. I used butter since I didn't have bacon grease available and used seasoning salt in place of the regular salt. Like some others, I think I might double the 'gravy' portion of the recipe next time- I prefer a saucier sausage gravy myself. This was my first attempt at homemade sausage gravy, though, and I'm very happy with this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

An okay recipe.  From reading all the reviews, it seems that everyone has altered the recipe drastically before rating it so high.  I am no exception!  I added 1/2 c. half and half, sage to the bacon grease, loads more pepper, and applewood smoked slab bacon.  And yes, it did turn out sublime.  Great for breakfast over biscuits and a big old cup of strong black coffee.

This gravy was ok.  We did not have any pepper so that may be why it was just ok.  I cooked the sausage, added some butter and when that melted, I added the flour, Mrs. Dash, a lot of salt, and milk.  I did add much more milk and flour so that there would be`enough to feed the four of us.  The family loved it but they did not grow up in the country like I did.   Next time I will buy pepper too.

Outstanding!  I used 1 can evaporated milk mixed with an equal amount of water instead of regular milk for a "richer" taste.  Also, use grease from smokey bacon for added flavor and add some of the crumbled up bacon to the gravy as well.  I increased the black pepper slightly.  Many have said it is the best sausage gravy they have ever had, I know it is a keeper for me.

This was really good.  I used butter instead of bacon drippings as one reviewer suggested and it turned out great, though I'd like to see what difference the bacon makes.  It definietly made a lot of gravy...my boyfriend and I hardly made a dent!

Absolutely wonderful!!!! My sister from down south is staying with me and she said it taste like her favorite restaurant's biscuits and gravy. The only change i made is i added a half box of maple breakfast sausage but everything else remained the same. Will make again soon.

It was a hit in my family.  I had to use butter for the bacon grease, but it was still tasty.  I also took an earlier tip and added some ground sage.  So yummy.  All 3 picky kids ate it.  No leftovers tho. :(  I would need to make more if we just had even an older kid. (my kids 7,4,2)

Best sausage gravy I have ever tasted..including restuarants.  Bacon grease is the key, and I used hot sausage because we love it spicy.

This recipe was pretty good. I didn't have any bacon so i left out the bacon grease and i used pork sausage with sage in it,I also added a little more salt. Turned out great
