Made it with diet ginger ale and added a bit of cinnamon.  If you're following the new Weight Watchers program, it's zero points.  Awesome!

I used Diet 7-UP and I sprinkled some homemade apple pie spice over the top before baking. My husband wouldn't try them but my kids and I thought they were great. I'm SO making these again.

I've been making this for years. I use diet black cherry soda which I pour into into the cored apple and around the dish. Comes out great !

It was great with the diet orange. I used diet Crush. I could smell the orange when I opened the oven. Next I am gonna try using diet strawberry.  Great with whipped cream or strawberry yogurt on top!

A coworker told me about baked fruit with diet soda so when I suddenly needed a sugar-free fat-free dessert for someone this Thanksgiving, I gave this recipe a try. It went over very well, I used ginger ale. I did add some spices (apple pie spice and extra cinnamon and ginger). I also think two cups is a little too much liquid, I will try again with a cup and a quarter in the future. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious.  We used diet Gingerale and sprinkled some cinnamon on it after it baked.  Very good.  Would probably be good to sprinkle the cinnamon on before it's baked; was tasty even sprinkling after it baked.  My husband liked vanilla wafers as a side.

Will not use this recipe for baked apples again.   I used 8 Granny Smith apples, 1 can of Hansen's diet orange soda, and lots of cinnamon, fresh grated nutmeg and cloves.  The kitchen smelled awesome, but the apples mushy.  My solution was to take out the stick blender & make some awesome applesauce.

I used diet 7up with alot of cinnamon.   I’m not sure if the soda dissolves it or what, but I found you need quite a bit, to get the baked cinnamon apple flavor.  I also served it warm and added some fat free Ready Whip.  This dish is great and satisfies my sweet tooth, even though I’m dieting.

I make these for my nephews whenever apples are on sale. They are good for dessert with a little ice cream or over oatmeal for a hearty breakfast.

Made this for a couple that came for dinner and one was a diabetic.  Thought I would make a wonderful dessert, but I didn't.  This recipe was not flavorful and probably could have been better with cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.  Will not make this again!
