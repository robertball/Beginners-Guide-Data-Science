Awesome crab soup! Made the full batch for our neighborhood New Year celebration and it all went. Will definitely make smaller batches all year long.

If the rating system would allow this recipe wouldn't get a single star but I'm forced to give it at least one just to provide a review. This was an incredible waste of time energy and most of all good crab. Not worth the paper used to print the recipe.
