A good way to add a lot of flavor to the squash, and I love anything that uses swiss chard, we really liked it, just shy of loved it.

This is tasty, but beware of the red pepper flakes!  Too much, for us, but otherwise, a tasty side dish or light lunch.  All the flavor of a pasta dish, but without the carbs.  Thanks for posting!
