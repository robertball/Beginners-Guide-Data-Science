I have made this recipe twice.  The first time I did'nt have buttermilk so I made someusing milk and vinegar.  My husband loved them but I thought the vinegar gave them a funny twang.  The next time I made them I used plain milk.  I still got rave reviews, but still not perfect.  I think that I put in too much baking soda.  I calls for only an eighth of a teaspoon.  I did'nt have that size so I just put in half of a fourth teaspoon.  It makes them rise, and impresses all my family an friends, but I'm going after that good fluffy buscuit that is also a little chewy.  If you put in too much soda they get a little too cakey. Next time I make them, I am going to get the buttermilk, make sure I only use 1/8 tsp soda, and I'm sure they will be great.  They really were easy to make.  My husband sd they tasted just like his Mom used to make, and my BIL said they were the best biscuits he ever ate.  Granted those two would eat paint off table legs, it was good eough for me.

These biscuits came in handy when a friend who is allergic to eggs was coming to visit. I was surprised to find that they were positively delicious. Light and fluffy and a unique taste. We all raved about them. I also substituted whole milk and vinegar. 1 T of vinegar in the milk and let it sit until it starts to thicken. Yum. I went out and BOUGHT a cast iron pan so that I can make them again the genuine way.

AWESOME!!!  This is my new and now "one and only" go to recipe for biscuits with sausage gravy!  This recipe was very quick to prepare and the biscuits were not dense but delicate and light.  These tasted so good!  I've tried many other recipes from this site and for me this is the "one"!  I used these biscuits with Bill's Sausage Gravy recipe.  NO leftovers!!

This is the perfect fluffy biscuit recipe.  Use buttermilk, don't try to substitute (most cooks know that buttermilk and regular milk are not interchangeable), because the extra moisture really matters with these.  Yummy with butter and honey!

The best biscuts I have ever made or eaten. Hands down. I cooked bacon and onions earlier that day in my cast iron skillet. I drained out all of the left over greese so there was only a very thin layer of fat on the bottom and used that instead of butter or spray. It really complimented the flavor. This biscuit is so good it does not even need butter! I would give it ten stars if I could!

Messy!  But the biscuits were delicious.  Very light and fluffy.  I used a cake pan instead of a cast iron skillet.

I made these last night for supper to go with some potato soup I had made from this site. The biscuits were so flaky. They just melted in your mouth. I am making them again this morning to send to a friend of ours who is sick, these and the soup will do him wonders. My husband just loved them. Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious! I substituted 2 cups flour, 3 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt for the self rising flour. I used cold butter and grated it. Thanks for a great recipe.

The biscuits were very heavy and rather tasteless.  Not worth the mess, but I DID make them with milk instead of buttermilk, all the other directions and ingredients I used were as given.

I usually make the J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits from this site, but decided to try these tonight to go with a pot of beef stew (my own recipe).  I was worried at first because the dough was so wet, but there was nothing to be concerned about.  They were fluffy and soft on the inside with just a tiny bit of crispiness on the outside.  I thought they were better than J.P.'s!  I will be using this recipe from now on.

Delicious! I used the cast iron skillet but may try regular pans next time. The bottoms were a little hard, but was most likely my fault. I made them ahead of time and put the entire skillet in my refrigerator covered with damp paper towels so they wouldn't dry out. Baked them a few hours later. Still delicious just the same!

Thank you Andrea, for a terrific recipe! I followed your wonderfully, detailed directions exactly, except I made them smaller (because I was making country ham & cheese appetizers out of them). I wondered how crispy they would get with baking so tightly together:but they were nice and crispy on top and edges, and light & fluffy inside. Perfect country biscuits that I will make again and again!

This was a very easy recipe to follow. I did have to make my own self-rising flour and buttermilk as I did not have these on hand. I was very skeptical about how these would turn out when I seen how wet the batter was. But they turned out perfectly. Great with sausage gravy! I will definitely be making these again.

These were the most amazing biscuits I have ever made. I have been looking for the recipe that was close to KFC biscuits and this beats them. I love that they are baked in a cast iron pan.
My husband loved them and that is who I am cooking to please.

I had my doubts about these biscuits because of the sugar, and the final step of dipping them in flour. I've always made rolled biscuits, not drop. But these were delicious biscuits! Great recipe! I had to use margarine because I didn't have either shortening or butter, but they were still great. My new biscuit recipe!

As written, this is a great staple recipe.  I've used this recipe many times now and have made small tweaks to make it a 5 star recipe.
TIP: add a little more shortening to make them fluffier. Not too much, maybe a tablespoon. You can cut down on some of the butter if you don't like the idea of extra shortening and butter. Or you can only use shortening (4 tbs) and no butter.
Don't soften the butter. It should be very cold. It will take a bit to cut it into the flour so that the lumps are pea-sized, but cold butter is better than softened.
Don't let the recipe fool you about the dough being very wet.  Don't go crazy with the milk. 
Also, for those who used milk instead of buttermilk and found the biscuits to be heavy - it's because of the baking soda.  Substitute with baking powder and you'll find them lighter and better tasting.

The perfect drop biscuit recipe!!!  This deserves 10 stars!  Don't change a thing! These are restaurant quality biscuits. No, BETTER than restaurant quality!  They are so fluffy and light with the perfect soft pillowy texture. If I could can and sell these I'd be rich! I cooked mine in a buttered round glass casserole dish and they came out great.

My Iron skillet must be bigger than most because when I was done putting the biscuits in the pan I was about 2 biscuits short? They rose well but never covered the gaps entirely (No problem)
 These biscuits turned out light and flakey with nice brown buttery top, definately my new go-to biscuit recipe...

This recipe speaks to my southern roots. They melt in your mouth. The bottom crusts up perfectly . YUM!  A seasoned cast iron skillet allows these amazing biscuits to sing.

I tried these today and was absolutely delighted. I did use butter flavor Crisco instead of just plain shortening otherwise I made no other changes.  I topped these biscuits with Bill’s Sausage Gravy and oh was my tummy happy. Thanks for the recipe.

This is definitely worth 5+ stars in my opinion. I made these once with buttermilk and once with faux buttermilk (vinegar and milk) and they turned out delicious both times. I was born in WV, so I am a born biscuit lover. If you have ever had a Tudor's Biscuit World Biscuit (and if you have not and there is one near you, SHAME on you!), these are very close.

I had no idea I could make biscuits like this! I followed the recipe step by step with the exception of not using shortening. I used butter instead which might account for a slightly salty taste. I'll try non-salted butter next time. These were delicious. Crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside. Great recipe.

This is my go to biscuit recipe.  Often times I am without buttermilk and use sour milk by adding vinegar.  Still fantastic every time.  A definite crowd pleaser every time!  I am not a fan of rolling out and cutting biscuits, to messy.  I love the simplicity of this recipe and how quickly I can get them to the table in the mornings to go with our sausage gravy.

I have been making these biscuits for the past to years.  I refuse to try another recipe because they are so good.  They come out light and fluffy and the kids love them.  I have gotten my co-workers hooked on these as well.

Excellent, excellent, excellent. These biscuits are the first I've ever made that are superb.  I made some for my 84 year old neighbor and his wife also, and he complained about them. When I asked what was wrong, he said "you didn't give me enough of them". Needless to say, I send some their way every time I make them now.

I was looking for a bread-like biscuit recipe (because I procrastinated and didn't have enough rise time for rolls). This was much more bread-like than typical biscuits, with great density and visible air pockets. I didn't find the experience to be messy, either (and my 3yo even helped).

I did doubt not pre-heating my cast iron, but I followed the recipe, did not pre-heat it, and they turned out great.

We'll be making these again soon (which won't help my procrastinating)!

Love this recipe! I tried a variation with the dough using a muffin tray, and actually managed to get a yummy chicken stuffing inside.    I'm even going to try to use it as a decadent top crust for pot pie next week!

The best I've made so far, but they got a little too brown.  And they were alittle drier than I would like.  I'll make them again and shorten the baking time.

This is a great recipe for biscuits. My family loves them I have been making them for breakfast off and on since August 2008. I was really pleased with how easy they are to make, as in Aufust that was my first time making buiscuits ever. I was a little put off about making biscuits, but this recipe put my mind at ease. The biscuits come out light and fluffy, moist and just delicious. You do not even need to add butter. I often have requests to make them with dinner. The girls love them in the morning before school. My childrens friends mothers are always so impressed that I get up and make biscuits for my family in the mornings. Sighting how do I have the time in the morning. If only they knew how easy they were to make. I think that I will keep that little secrect to myself. Try them and enjoy!

I truly love my biscuits and I do believe these are the best I've ever made.  I had no buttermilk or even whole milk so I used sour cream, half and half, a spoon of vinegar and club soda to make up the buttermilk.  I've never eaten a better biscuit for flavor or the softness and lightness of these.

Very good!  Though these are not the layered kind of biscuit.  Still, very tender and I love they way they mix up so easily.  No rolling, cutting, rerolling which toughens the biscuit.

At first, i was not impressed. Bland. Increased butter lessen shortening. Upon purchasing a bag of fresh Bread Flour, it fluffed up. Could have been the difference in flour or the freshness.

THE BEST BISCUITS IVE EVER EATEN!!!  My family raved about them.  I made them exactly as the recipe called for.  You won’t be disappointed. You won’t have to play around with the recipe.  I don’t think I can ever make them any other way.

Simple and delicious. I've been able to substitute buttermilk by adding a tablespoon of vinegar to regular milk and they turn out just as well. Using self riding flour is a must.

I've made this recipe twice, and both efforts were an abject failure---completely wasted ingredients. "The mixture will be a sloppy consistency"- wow. Understatement. The liquid biscuits would not hold together at all. There was no picking them up. The first time, I thought I must have made a mistake so I tried again and the next time, I was sure to follow the recipe exactly. Perfectly. Disaster. Don't even try. It's a complete waste of time and materials. The end results both times, an ugly mess of flour lumps which baked into an ugly mess of cooked flour lumps. I'm a bit aggravated.

I will never use another biscuit recipe! I followed the instructions exactly, and they turned out light and buttery and delicious. I made them the first time along with some sausage gravy, and they were promptly devoured. I’m making them again to have with some bacon and eggs. Fantastic recipe!

I make these biscuits most Saturday mornings.  My kids and wife love them. Easy to make and delicious.  The cast iron skillet makes a crusty bottom.  I always baked these on bottom rack of oven. I usually use the 1TBS vinegar to 1 cup milk buttermilk substitute and they turn out great.  Making your own self rising flour works as well but much easier to keep a bag of self rising floor in the cupboard. It is critical to add the  ingredients needed to make self rising floor if you don't have the premade flour. Substitutes are easy to find on Google.  Good luck and enjoy.

Made just as written with the exception of substituting the buttermilk with whole milk and tbsp of lemon juice.  Excellent recipe!  They were tender, flaky and buttery; my family devoured them with salmon croquettes, grits and eggs for breakfast.  Thanks for this go to easy biscuit recipe.  I will never Buy Pillsbury grand again.

These came out really well even though my cast iron is still in storage and I had to just use a 9" round cake pan.  I had them a bit too thin, so added a little flour and rolled them before setting in the pan, my only deviation. They came out wonderfully anyway! I bet they'd only be better in cast iron, so I'm saving the extra star to review after baking in cast iron.

Very good biscuits. As close to my Grandmothers as I've found. The only thing I did to change it was to add 1 more table spoon of shortening.

I have made these biscuits many times, they are reliably delicious! Definitely a favorite. The only time I had a failure was at a friends’s house—I didn’t use buttermilk and she had no cast iron Dutch oven. Follow the recipe exactly and they are a winner!

they were cakey and even though I left them in for 25 minutes the dough seemed a bit raw in the middle. still saved them to try again because I think it may have been my fault judging by the other reviews! the outer crispy area was delish and they look beautiful coming out of the oven in the skillet

The only successful attempt at biscuits I've had. I used lard and an olive oil spread instead of  shortening and butter. I followed the rest of the directions and remembered not to mix too much after adding the buttermilk. I get ricochet biscuits because I am mixing too thoroughly which makes tough biscuits. But these biscuits came out heavenly. I made steak and chicken biscuits with them and they held up.

This was my first try at biscuits and I love how moist these are! I used plain yogurt thinned with water instead of buttermilk and it seemed to work fine. I omitted the melted butter topping and didn't miss it. Great with a dab of honey on top.

This is my go to biscuit recipe! I honestly make these at least once a week. My husband swears they are the best biscuits he has ever had and we both grew up eating hearty bread for dinner and biscuits were a must for every breakfast. The only thing that I changed was the non stick cooking spray. I prefer to add about a tablespoon of vegetable shortening to my cast iron and put it in the oven to melt. Doing this allows the oil to heat very well so when you drop your biscuits in, they will sizzle and make the most amazing crust on the bottom! Seriously! Try it! If you have a good cast iron pan and use it all the time like I do, there is no need to spray the sides of your pan because it is already non stick and seasoned well. Try these biscuits! They are seriously the BEST!!

I made these biscuits and they were amazing. I followed the recipe to T, and was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. The change is would make is adding less salt to the mixture, other than that, perfection. If you are looking for a great biscuits recipe try this one!!!!

I've been making biscuts my whole life and these are arguably the best I've ever made. Light and fluffy with just the right crisp to the bottoms. I've been making the every week now and serving them with soup, for egg & cheese breakfast sandwiches, or just with jam or honey as a snack. Highly recommended!

I have never been able to make good biscuits. But this time "I made great ones"
Johnny's  biscuit recipe is fabulous! I made one change, only because I had to.  I use 2% milk. So I had to substitute it for the butter milk. Otherwise I followed it exactly and they were great! Yes I will definitely make them again and often now that I have found a recipe that I can make  and be proud of. Thank you for sharing these delicious biscuits with all of us!

I have made these biscuits several times now, following the recipe as written. I love these biscuits and so do my kids. I have tried many biscuit recipes looking for a match to my grandma's fluffy, chewy biscuits. These are the closest match, even though they are technically drop biscuits, and the best tasting biscuits I have ever made!
I use a round cake pan and still get great results.

For some reason, my biscuit dough was so soft that I could not keep it together to form a biscuit.  I added a little more flour, let it rest again, and then made them.  I also put butter in my iron skillet and preheated  the skillet in the oven.  (Remember not to touch hot iron skillet with bare hands--ouch!)  I placed the biscuits in the hot skillet and baked for 16 minutes.  They were slightly crisp on the outside, but light and fluffy on the inside--just like we like them.

these did not turn out like the pictures.....kinda flat and heavy. BUT the family devoured them up! so might have to work on them a little more, because they were good.

Anyone who says these didn't come out well just didn't follow the recipe. These are perfect.

This recipe was easy but not sure what "very wet" meant. I thought it was too wet. I did have to substitute buttermilk with milk/vinegar combo. I thought this is why it came out way too runny. So, I added a bit more flour. Biscuits did have great texture and flavor. I do plan to stick to original recipe next time. Will keep this one as favorite.

Great biscuits! I like them in a iron skillet so I put them on the BBQ while cooking dinner and it's done in 16-20 minutes! I used whole wheat pastry flour ... I forgot the butter on top but they turned out great!

Best biscuits ever! So easy turns out perfect every time. Go by the recipe on this one. The trick is not to stir too much or they will be like rocks.

these were good indeed: nice taste and ready in a jiff! used yogurt instead of buttermilk, and a cake pan instead of iron skillet. Thanks a lot!

With this being my first time making biscuits, I was actually proud of myself.  I was amazed it how easy this recipes was.  My family loved it.
