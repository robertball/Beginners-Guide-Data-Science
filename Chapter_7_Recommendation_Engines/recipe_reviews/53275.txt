we were jokingly calling this "mock head" at my party.  i think some people were afraid to eat based on appearance (we used a beautiful mold though).  however, it tasted very good.  decent recipe for not using a head.  there was very little jello in this recipe based on amount of meat.  one person said that maybe more jello would have made it more authentic.  however, i thought it was fine

My mother made this when I was just a litlte kid after a Hog was butched.It is made from the meat in a hogs head as the name says. She made it in a loaf and we ate it as sandwichies or just with vinger on it.

This anything but head cheese. Head cheese is made with a hogs head tongue and hocks. NOT shoulder. This is just bad with out the flavor of real head cheese.

My Dad made it every New Year when I was a child. It is a family tradition in which they used the head of a slaughtered hog. It is a delicious appetizer with crackers.

I followed the recipe with the addition of some pigs feet that I chopped up when the meat was done simmering together. I liked the texture that the feet added. I would have liked it with just a little more salt maybe some sage but that is a personal thing. All in all a good recipe.
