I used light mayonaise as the creamy salad dressing, left out the poultry seasoning, and added onion powder and salt instead of onion salt.  I'd previously made an almost similar recipe that called for lemon juice instead of the orange juice.  My husband liked the lemon juice taste a little better than the orange juice.

The recipe is a good starter recipe. I agree with the other reviews in that onion salt should be onion powder and salt & pepper to taste. Adding you favorite pasta and some peas or other veggies is a must.

I really like this dish.  Leaving it in the refrigerator overnight lets the tastes mix together.  I typically add some ingredients, you know switch it up.  That's what makes this a good recipe, you can make changes to suit your taste.

I don't really get why this has to be chilled overnight...so I didn't do it.  Also, I used a full can of the crm of chicken soup, added 1/4c sour cream, added 1 c of cooked seashell pasta (I just needed to add a little more substance!!), and omitted the hard boiled eggs.  Finally, I used onion powder instead of the onion salt. The OJ was subtle and the overall taste was very good.

This was pretty good, but a little salty.  I did not chill mine overnight and instead of layering the cheese, I mixed all the ingredients together and topped with potato chips before baking.  I also subbed in lemon juice for the orange and it worked just fine.

This recipe is pretty good, but I wouldn't really say it's like a chicken salad.  Did not refrigerate overnight and used a full can of soup.  Fresh from the oven it tasted better than after a day or two, as the eggs got rubbery with time.  Too much celery for my taste.  Not a bad cassarole, but there's others out there...

I like using this recipe as a base. I’ve substituted and exchanged many ingredients, at times using water chestnuts, sunflower seeds for texture. Tonight I added hard boiled egg. It’s simply a great recipe that allows for flexibility! Have fun with it!
