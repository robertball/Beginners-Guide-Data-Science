I rated this recipe average quickness and easiness because I cut up my vegetables instead of using the store's ready cut ones.  It's a very "good for you recipe," and full of texture!  I wonder if it would be at best, if you add some sliced ginger to remove the excess veggie taste...if that's what ginger is truly  used for.

This wasn't all that good. My husband picked the chicken out of it, and that was all that he ate.  This recipe is better with pork or beef, and instead of using the honey and stir fry sauce you can just use soy sauce and get the same flavor..
