What a nice fresh and easy fruit salad.  I used Greek Yogurt with Honey and that was perfect.

Great recipe! I made this without syrup, and with natural yoghurt, so it had quite a sharp taste.

Loved this recipe!  Omitted the syrup in one dish added in another, also used vanilla yogurt because that is what my fridge offered me.  YUM

Great recipe. I also used Greek Yogurt with Honey and 2 pears instead of the blueberries and raspberries and it worked perfectly. Delicious and healthy. Kiddies loved it.

Perfect way to dress up a fruit salad while still keeping it fresh and light. Use whatever fruit you have or like. I added grated coconut and chopped pecans and used a thicker Icelandic yogurt. The maple syrup is a most in my opinion. I didnâ€™t add any additional sugar.

Serving the fruit salad in individual cups helped keep blueberries and grapes from rolling off plates. The single-serve cups balance easily on sturdy plates and keep the buffet line moving smoothly

Really delicious fruit salad! It was only for me, so I just eyeballed amounts. I did not have raspberries but did add pieces of cantaloupe and pineapple that I had leftover from another salad. No orange but added a small segmented clementine. I used lowfat vanilla yogurt and skipped the syrup. Topped with a sprinkle of raw turbinado sugar that gave it a nice crunch. Good and satisfying one-bowl lunch on a hot fall day. Thanks for the recipe!

I served this as a dessert and it was very good.  Loved the mango as it brought extra sweetness  without adding calories.  Adding orange extends the refrigerator life but add the yogurt and sugar just before you intend to serve.  The fruit gets mushy if it sits in the refrigerator too long covered in yogurt.  I  forgot the maple syrup.  Maybe try adding that next time and used vanilla yogurt instead of plain. Added a dollop of low fat whipped cream to top it off.  Refreshing and delicious.

This was great as a healthy fruit salad (compared to those with canned fruit and cool whip). I used honey instead of maple syrup and didn't add the sugar. There were no leftovers.
