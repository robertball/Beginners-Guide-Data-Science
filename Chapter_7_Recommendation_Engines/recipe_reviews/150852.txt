Great recipe. I change the recipe a bit to this: one shot vodka, 1/2 shot coconut rum, fill with pineapple. Splash OJ and shake well. I used to work in a restaurant and just did what came natural to me. My guests loved it!

I think the ratios of this are WAY off. The taste is good once you adjust. I used a 3/1 ratio of vodka to rum to make it as strong as you'd like it. I fill the rest of the glass with a 3/1 ratio of OJ to pineapple, pouring all of it over ice. Taste was great but I fear this recipe is wrong!

Not bad, I added 2 Oz of strawberry daiquiri mix, it makes it alot better. Went from a 3 star drink to a 4 star drink just by adding daiquiri mix.

Great combination of ingredients, but this is a recipe for a Beachcomber "shooter".  It makes a delicious shot, and for a cocktail version just add a bit more OJ and Pineapple to taste.

Delicious!  A lovely, refreshing taste of the tropics!  I quadrupled the recipe for two nice-sized drinks.
