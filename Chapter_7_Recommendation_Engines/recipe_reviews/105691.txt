Quite tasty. I added onions,ginger and garlic as well as some mushrooms which added a bit more flavor. Nice exotic recipe for entertaining.

Rice turned out really good, nice and tasty I used yellow raisins, and pine nuts instead of the cashews. Served with Lamb and Garlic Naan, was yummy. made for my 3 brothers. no leftovers.

This was nice and exotic.  I was surprised by the instruction to sautee the uncooked rice, which promptly got a little burnt by my overacheiving stovetop, but otherwise everything went off without a hitch.  With the coconut milk, it comes out very creamy.  My boyfriend said that the taste is unfamiliar but good (We don't eat much Indian food).

I made a mistake and used cream of coconut (sweet) instead of coconut milk and my whole family loved it!  Then I made it again with the coconut milk and they liked it, but not nearly as much.  I personally thought it was too sweet with the cream of coconut, but will try it again using less than a whole can.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was so good!  I substituted vegetable broth to make a delicious vegetarian main meal.  I followed the directions just as it said and it came out just right!

My husband & I loved this recipe! The spices were perfect and the house smelled wonderful as it was cooking. The only adjustment I will make next time is to use light coconut milk and a 1/2 cup of cashew pieces, to see if it lightens it up the recipe calorie-wise. I served this alongside Country Captain Chicken and Indian Cauliflower (the later is also on this site). Finally garnishing this with fresh cilantro definitely gives it an added umph, YUMMY!

A fantastic recipe.  Made it almost exactly as written, except I had no turmeric and used curry powder instead.  Wonderful side dish--different and delicious.

Wow, this is tasty!  And very easy to make!  I added ~1/2c. onions for extra flavor and I think it helped.  I also made sure to rehydrate my raisins as best I could before they went into the rice (covered in boiling water for ~10 min, drained).  Everyone enjoyed and it was gone between the 6 of us.  Next time I'll add onions and maybe mushrooms, too.  Thanks Michelle!  *Update* Delicious with Vegetarian Korma!  Mmm yum!

Delicious! Put the cashews in at the very end to just get them hot, otherwise they end up super soggy. You need the crunch. I also had to use my curry powder because I was out of everything except the red pepper. turned out awesome!

This was a huge hit with my family!  Served with Grilled turkey & cheddar paninis with mango chutney.  Yum!  Basmati rice takes way longer than 20 minutes to cook but, I knew that ahead of time.  Probably cooked mine for about 40 minutes.  It came out perfect.  Was a very nice Indian dinner and will make again.

Really good and a nice change from ordinary rice. I served this with Tandoori Chicken Thighs. I would only make with Indian/Middle Eastern food though as the spice profile probably wouldn't match well with mutch else.

This is a very easy recipe to throw together without a lot of prep, and tastes fantastic. It's a recipe I tried and have made numerous times since. I throw in about 1/2 cup of diced onion and a couple cloves of garlic.

Excellent rice dish!  As I began cooking it, I realized (and was shocked) that I was OUT of raisins...extremely unusual for me!  Disappointed, I carried on...the rice was still fantastic, but I know the raisins would complete the dish!  Super yummy, thanks!

Wow--this was so easy for a really creamy, delicious rice. I didn't have turmeric and added a 1/2 t curry. I also used lite coconut milk.

I made this as directed except subed Curry for the Turmeric and it was great!  Creamy and delicous right out of the pan, although the next day it had dried out alot.  I may try adding extra broth next time.

Sunday nights, I usually go all out. It's family night. Instead of going out to a restaurant, I love cooking at home. I love creating or simply looking up a great recipe on allrecipes.com.  I decided to try "Indian".  I made chicken tikka masala and I tried this recipe. It was great. I also made naan bread, cucumber raita and mango chutney. My family was so impressed.  This rice recipe was so full of flavor and mild at the same time.  Great Recipe

This is a nice rice dish to go along with curries or masala dishes. I did not have raisins or cashews so I substituted with dried cranberries and toasted pine nuts. Colorful and delicious.

This was a fantastic rice side dish. I upped the red pepper flakes as we like spicy food. The presentation looked wonderful and the taste was creamy, spicy and wonderful on the tongue.

i used Golden Raisins and Roasted Garlic & Bell Pepper seasoning blend from McCormick, a Pinch.   Served with Citrus Grilled Chicken and stir fried Broccoli with onion,red and yellow bell peppers.  Delicious addition.  My 13 year old had 2nds and when I told her it had coconut milk in the recipe I got a "your a cool Mom" look.  thanks for the great alternative to plain old rice.

This was great, very flavorful. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of both curry and cinnamon. Left out the oil and didn't miss it. Also used light coconut milk. Served with Grilled Chicken Thighs Tandoori with was also fantastic.

I loved the way this turned out.  I think that it was a wonderful complement to our Indian Themed dinner.  I served this with  Chicken Makhani (Indian Butter Chicken)  and Naan from this site.  I highly recommend it.

I didnt add raisins nor nuts, but the rice was a delightfully mellow yet flavorful addition to the spicy curry we made.
I used lite coconut milk and added a 1/4 tsp of garam masala.
This is going in the official recipe book.
Thanks for sharing:)

This was a big hit with the family and I will certainly make it again. I only had almonds on hand and used those instead of the cashews.  I also added a can of garbanzo beans to make it a main dish. An extra shot of Thai red curry rub was added as well.  Really good!

This recipe is very tasty. For a healthier version, I replaced the can of coconut milk and vegetable oil with coconut oil and Silk's 'True Coconut' milk. It was very tasty.

This rice was wonderful. Lots of flavor and texture with the cashews and raisins. Easy to make and delicious. It is even better the next day. I will certainly be making this again.

This is the tastiest rice I've had to date! I don't like raisins or nuts in my Indian dishes though so I leave those out along with the chili flakes because I have young children eating it. I LOVE this rice!

I used sliced almonds in place of cashews and purple raisins rather than golden because that's what I had.  It was very tasty!

If you are looking for a good Indian rice , you have found it.  I had never made Indian rice before so wanted to try a recipe that wouldn't be too spicey.  This was delicious and very creamy with the addition of the coconut milk.  I had plenty left over for 2 more meals . One I added chicken and hope to use the other left over rice with another Indian vegetable recipe.  This is really delicious , if you haven't tried basmati rice before here is your chance.

A super duper recipe! We love Indian food and this is such a great dish! You can dress it up with chicken, beef or pork or keep it vegetarian - any way, it is superb! It makes great leftovers too! I used Penzey's Sweet Curry powder and Trader Joe's salted cashews and there is nothing I would change at all about this gem of a recipe!

Didn't have the raisins and cashews the first time and both my wife and I immediately said this is a keeper. Love the sweetness added by golden raisins for our second iteration. And cashews--what else!

Sorry I did not take a picture of this however I did make some changes to it. I used long rain rice , added white wine and golden raisins.. It was a hit  =.   1 cup of rice 80z white wine 8 oz of chicken stock and followed the rest of the recipe. Next time I will add some onion.

It tasted great and very filling but the rice needed a longer cook time.  20 minutes was not enough. Probably double it to 40.

I'm not a fan of Indian food, but this had so many great reviews and it did not have curry spices in it so I decided to make it. I made it to serve with Lentil Soup with Lemon also from this site. The rice was great on its own but was even better with the lentil soup which is more like stew served on top. An Indian friend said it is not authentic because of the raisins but the raisins made the dish. I never liked lentils but I plan on making this rice and the lentil soup every week, it takes 30 minutes to make both. The leftovers make an awesome lunch at work and the smell makes my coworkers jealous. I used veggie stock, that was the only modification I did.

This is a really delicious rice dish (and I don't really love rice).  The only modification I make is to take the advice of a previous reviewer and just add the cashews at the end so they stay crunchy.

LOVED it!! I went with some of the other suggestions and added 1/2 cup chopped onion to the pot and used yellow raisins. After it was cooked, I added some fresh chopped cilantro. I'll definitely make this again for my family.

I added 1/4 cup chopped onion, 1/4 cup diced carrot, 1/4 cup chopped Shitake mushrooms and 1 tsp minced garlic.
I loved it!  Other family members were less enthusiastic.  But all said they would eat it, if I made it again.
When I make it again, I plan to saute  shrimp in a grill pan and serve over the rice.

Loved this, I omitted the nuts because my husband doesn't like them and the red pepper flakes so my kids could eat it. The raisins added a nice sweet touch, I thought a teaspoon of salt was a bit much so I omitted 1/4 teaspoon and replaced it with sugar. Also I only had one can of broth so I didn't add the extra quarter can but it turned out fine.

This was good and easy to make, just keep an eye on the rice when you fry it for the first step.  People are complaining that it was bland, but I don't think it's supposed to be anything other than what it is.  You get savory and sweet together.  It's a mellow dish.  Not every Indian dish is in-your-face spicy/spiced.

I'm not a fan of Cashews or Raisins so made it without and added grated carrots. I also didn't have basmati rice so used a wild rice blend, just cooked it longer, and it was still amazing!

We are a vegetarian family so I substituted the chicken stock for vegetable stock. The flavor was wonderful and it got rave reviews when I cooked it for Community Dinner. I adjusted the recipe to make 25 servings and it was still a little chewy after an hour of cooking. That being said I will definitely make it again.

I took others suggestions and added about a half cup of onion. I sautéed it with the rice. I also usedngolden raisins and added dried cranberries, madjool dates and a small amount of fresh ginger.  This was very delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

wasn't as exciting as I was expecting given all the glowing reviews. Not much in the way of flavor; kind of bland really. I think I might have overcooked it though...ended up tasting kind of like a couscous dish. I don't think I'll be making this again.

I used one cup of rice and a can of Campbell's chicken broth the first time around. My husband couldn't stop raving about it and even took it to work the next day and ate it by itself without any meat or veggies. When I cooked it a second time and followed the rice measurements it didn't turn out as well. Plus I substituted the chicken stock with 1 chicken bouillon cube melted in 2 cups of boiling water. The dish just didn't taste as magnificent as the first go round. But what a wonderful easy recipe. I immediately added it to my favourites list and shared it with my sister. Thank you!

Yummy! It can be a little more spicy but overall a great side dish and one that I will make often from now on! Not to mention the bright yellow color makes it very presentable for company. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Very good.  After reading other reviews, I increased  spices.  Increased Tumeric to 1/3 tsp , added 1/4 tsp Curry powder, 2 tbsp onion, two shakes Cayenne powder (had no pepper flakes) and a shake of Cinnamon.   I didn't have Cashew nuts so tried Walnut but not keen, so used Salted Peanuts which worked well.  Raisins are a must.

I tried this last night for dinner and it was really good ice. Loved the crunchiness of the cashew and the sweetness of the raisins. This made for quite a change in the rice we usually have. I will make it again for sure. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This is a super easy recipe to make and it was very tasty, although the flavour wasn't super strong (which I liked but some people might want to add more tumeric or something). The only thing with my recipe, is that it took about 40 minutes to cook (and the recipe called for 20). It's a great recipe and I will for sure make it again!

Wow! We tried this recipe - sort of - and loved it. We didn't have any basmati so substituted 1 c jasmine & 1/2 c black rice. Then couldn't find chicken stock so substituted beef, and then finally found out we were out of raisins so 1/2 cup of chopped up dates were used instead. Regardless, rice turned out beautifully. Thank you for sharing this recipe, we will definitely make again!

Didn't have everything on the list, but it turned out great anyway.  Very rich because of the coconut milk.  Served it with Tikka Masala, Nann and some Indian sauces/chutnies...very impressive.  Thanks!

Pretty tasty.  But it's missing something.  The flavor, honestly, is a bit bland, except when you bit into a raisin.  I think I'll try the onion/garlic suggestion next time.  BTW, this recipe makes A LOT so be sure you adjust for the size of the crowd you're feeding.

This is one interesting recipe. I used brown rice and substituted the coconut milk with soy milk. I found the raisins made this dish sweet while the spices made it savory, and the blend was odd, but 1 T. of sugar solved that problem. The adults enjoyed this creamy dish, but it was a bit too different for the younger palates.

This is absolutely delicious.  The combination of flavors is outstanding.  We omitted the raisins because my husband and I don't like them, but it was great with only the cashews.  I have made this twice already and will continue to make it again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! Easy to make and delicious. I added some chopped, sauteed onion as well as a handful of dried cranberries. Served it to three men and they all loved it.
