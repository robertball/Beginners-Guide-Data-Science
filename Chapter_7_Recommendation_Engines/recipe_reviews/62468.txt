Delicious! I was a little worried that the hazelnuts would make the hollandaise gritty, but it was silky smooth and lovely. We had this on baked fish with roasted potatoes. Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out great and was delicious!!  I needed a sauce that was quick and impressive, and this delivered.  I didn't have hazelnuts, so I used almonds instead, which made it come out darker and thicker, so I cut it with water and called it "Almond Glaze".  All my guests loved it and not only ate it on their chicken cordon bleu, but on all the sides as well.

Tasted way to 'hazelnutty' for me...just wasn't very good.
