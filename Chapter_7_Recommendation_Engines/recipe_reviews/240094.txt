This is such a nice, simple, light salad.  My bags of greens were 7oz each (and I used two), so I knew I'd have to increase the dressing to coat it all.  I upped the EVOO to 2 TBSP and the vinegar to 1 TBSP (knowing that ration works for me).  I used 10 cranks of sea salt from a ginger and about 1/8 tsp of white pepper.  I subbed almonds for the hazelnuts per personal preference and I used a Granny Smith apple (the tartness really worked).  I can see making this again, particularly as a salad for a dinner party.  THANKS for the recipe!
