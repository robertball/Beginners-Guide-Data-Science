These are great and oh so easy. I got a couple of English cucumbers in my first CSA grocery bag. Neither my husband nor I like cucumbers very much. I searched for something I could make using them and found this recipe. I followed the recipe except that I forgot to add the salt. They are delicious. My only question is how long do these keep? Thanks for posting this recipe.

This is a great recipe.  The English cucumbers make nice slices that don't disintigrate so easily.  Yummy for sure.  I also like pickling spices so next time I am going to try adding 1 teaspoon of pickling spice in a loose tea holder during cooking so I get the flavour without the individual spices floating around in the finished product. Thanks for sharing.

I love these pickles.. I'm on a low sodium diet for health reasons so I half the salt and they're still great..  some times I add less sugar, more vinegar and a Serrano pepper for a little different flavor.

So delicious! Thanks for posting this recipe. I've added a habanero to my next batch. Great for Cuban sandwiches. A good way to use cucumbers from the garden before that last frost.

I no longer buy sweet pickles or sweet pickle relish.  This  recipe is fantastic.  The only thing I do different is I cook it on top of the stove instead of in the microwave...perfect every time!

Just like grandma made, but much easier. I cooked them for 8 minutes and changed nothing. Great recipe!

Made it on a whim after seeing the recipe...so easy and the all the ingredients were in the pantry...didn't really know what to expect...but they turned out great.  Will make more since I really like B&B pickles. All I need from the store is a cuke....and I've got pickles!!!!

I added two teaspoons of pickling spice and used three cucumbers. Everything else the same. Much better!
