I love it when I find a recipe that reminds me of childhood or at least an early memory, this is that rcipe. My Mum made a cookie very much like this but there was one difference instead of jam the cookied was spread with melted chocolate. I have made three different batches one with jam one with my childhood memory of chcolate and then I just went compleatly crazy and spread with chocolate and jam. The last combination was a little messy but worth the effort. I will make these again and a again, all varities. A real keeper.

I found it easier to roll the dough between two pieces of waxed paper, and then place in the freezer for a few minutes to firm it up before spreading on the jam. I skipped the nuts on the outside. After rolling, I placed in the freezer again for a few hours, thus saving a lot of time. I got 45 cookies out of roll, and my kids really liked them.

These were incredibly fun and delicious--I substituted margarine for Crisco and used a triple berry jam.  A great hit!!

I agree with the other reviewers, the dough is way too crumbly and hard to work with.  The taste was great but it wasn't worth the effort I had to put into it.

I had the same problem as Karynjo. The dough kept breaking apart and jam was everywhere! I finally froze the dough log so it would not be so soft. The jam looked more like spiderwebs after all the breaking. The peanuts were messy too. The taste was ok. I doubt I will make again. Sorry!

These taste great, but I had a VERY hard time working with the dough.  It is extremely messy!  I couldn't quite roll it up in an even circle; it was more oblong, so now I have very large oval cookies.  Also, I had to bake them A LOT longer than 12 minutes - almost 25 minutes.  Don't know if I'll try again.

Not enough "reward" for the amount of work involved. I'd rather make peanut butter cookies and put a "jam thumbprint" in the middle of each one! Same great P&J taste...a lot less work!

these were tasty.. i used butter instead of butter flavored crisco.. why use butter flavored crisco.. when you can use butter? confused me a bit. I didn't have any problem making them at all? so i don't get what the other reviewers were saying. i would advise to give these cookies ROOM.. i learned the hard way more space is better. my husband doesn't like chunky pb so i skipped the nuts. i did put the dough in the freezer for an hr before spreading the jelly. Worked out good. Thanks for the share
