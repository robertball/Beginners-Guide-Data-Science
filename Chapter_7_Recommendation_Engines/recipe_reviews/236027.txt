These were so yummy! I was looking for a chocolate treat that was healthy, and these did the trick! To improve nutritional quality I used whole wheat flour and a natural zero calorie sweetener to replace the sugar. Besides the small bit of butter, these "cookies" are very filling and relatively healthy. 
   As far as taste, I call these "cake cookies," because they are like perfectly bite size pieces of moist chocolate cake. They were not as "cookie" like but I found that enjoyable. Overall an easy, yummy, and healthy alternative to standard cookie or cake making. ---And by the way, in case you're concerned--- when eating the cookies you cannot even tell there is kale. It just adds tons of nutrients!

I doubled the recipe and made 24 mini muffins, baked for 12 minutes. Used coconut sugar and half whole wheat flour,  these are great!

I was really skeptical about this recipe.  But I just got done doubling the recipe and making extra!!  These are incredible!  These cookies (or fluffy brownie pillows as my hubby called them) are soft, rich, and chocolatey~ exactly how I like my sweet stuff.  I used whole eggs instead of just whites since we have our own chickens I can't waste any part of my lovely eggs.  More tips: I really crammed that kale into my 1/3 measuring cup so I got some extra in there, use a good quality food processor and really purée it well, & I also put an extra tablespoon of good quality baker's chocolate (56% cacao) in.

These were moist and cakey like the description stated, however, as a personal preference I didn't care for them as I'm not a huge chocolate fan.  The bake time was spot on.  I could not taste the kale, which is a plus!  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I preferred the bites that had chocolate chips vs the bites that didn't, so I would probably add more chocolate chips.  I rated this as a 4 star because I think someone who likes chocolate would enjoy these.

Super yummy and definitely a keeper! Like others have said it is more of a cake texture versus cookie. I used coconut oil instead of canola (can't even tell a difference!) I also used mint chocolate chips instead of the dark chocolate. Seriously an amazing recipe can't even tell its kale! Great way to fill the chocolate craving without the calories and sugar!

I made these in order to sneak a vegetable into my toddler.  These were quite delicious straight from the oven but not exciting the next day.

I really loved these cookies!  I used 1 tablespoon of honey and 1/3 cup sugar substitute plus four Truvia packets to make them sweeter.  They  have a wonderful cake-like texture and are very light--based on the ingredients I used, each cookie had only 35 calories!  This is the first time I've tried baking kale in a dessert, and I was very pleased with the results.  Great recipe!

I got some kale in a Bountiful Basket order and as I've never been a fan of kale, I had no clue what to do with it.  I ran across this recipe and was doubtful but willing to try it as I had all the ingredients, except the applesauce.  (Because of that I substituted a freshly puréed apple and an extra teaspoon of sugar.)

When I told my husband I was baking kale into cookies, he laughed.  He wasn't laughing once he tried them.  What a wonderful surprise for chocolate lovers. I would compare these to a moist muffin consistency.

I would not have believed it.  Even my husband who would never eat kale just loved them.  I am making more today.  I made it exactly like the recipe only leaving out the chocolate chips.  These are so yummy.  Thanks so much for posting and coming up with this recipe.

My family loved these cookies!  I added a bit of cinnamon but otherwise kept everything the same.  I made one batch but they were gone so quickly I made another batch.  Thanks for a wonderful cookie recipe!

These are okay.  They're definitely not gross, but they aren't amazing, either.  We'll enjoy what's left, but I'm not sure I'll make them again.  I am going to try drying them out in the dehydrator because, as a cookie, they're just too moist.

Absolutely excellent recipe. I substituted cannabis for kale and substituted coconut oil for both the butter and the canola. I also added my organic home grown raisins and walnuts instead of chocolate chips. DELICIOUS! Excellent texture.

If you don't eat many sweets, these will be a treat for you.  If you or your kids are used to mainstream baking, however, these aren't going to fool anybody. Make sure your kale is pureed,  not just chopped, or you will have green flecks in the cookies. I added semi-sweet mini chocolate chips and they made the cookies much better. Next time I will increase the sugar and the honey to make them more like a true cookie.

We like the texture, but not the flavor so much. They're edible, but not good. They need more sugar and more chocolate... or maybe more of a sweeter chocolate would do the trick.
