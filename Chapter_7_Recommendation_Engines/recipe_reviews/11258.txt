I made these over the Christmas Holidays and they were very good. I tried the recipe with both lemon and orange peel, and they were equally good.*Add more peel if you want more lemon flavour - I did! For a variation, I rolled the cooled dough into balls and pressed them down with a glass dipped in sugar. I think it made them extra special, and added a nice sweet crunch.
