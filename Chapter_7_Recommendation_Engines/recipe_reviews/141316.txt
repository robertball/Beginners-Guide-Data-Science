I really had to think about if this was 3 stars or 4.  I am giving it 4 stars because - although it was bland - I knew it would be by looking at the ingredients.  The sesame oil in the chicken is excellent - I would double it next time.  It really doesn't need the 3/4 Cup broth - as the Pea Shoots wilt quickly (like spinach) and release a lot of water.  If I were to make this again - I would add more sesame oil to the chicken along with some garlic chili paste,  also fresh ginger along with the garlic - add no or just a tiny bit of broth or water - a pinch of salt or soy sauce and a pinch of sugar to bring out the flavors.

I am one of those annoying people that rate a recipe, even though not following the recipe exactly.  I always read reviews first, just to find out what others think of this recipe and I used suggestions.  I doubled the amount of sesame oil, and am glad I did because it wasn't super strong and I love the flavor of sesame oil.  I also added 3 cloves more garlic, another bunch of pea shoots, used homemade veggie broth in lieu of the chicken broth, half a small onion diced, some ginger, soy sauce, some sherry, and a bit of sucanet to sweeten it up (I don't use regular sugar - only Sucanet which is also knows as Rapidura).  I thought this was so delicious and I wouldn't hesitate to eat this again and again!  I do think that the flavor would have been lacking, but I think it has great potential to add flavors that you enjoy.

I also served this up with Lundberg Wild Blend (a combination of long grain brown rice, sweet brown rice, Wehani, Black Japonica, and Wild Rice).  I would have used another rice (Brown Basmati is my preferred) however the one I used needed to be used up. 

Really, you should try this it is FANTASTIC!

This is fantastic! Used local organic hydroponic pea shoots.   It tastes just like takeout Chinese (but less greasy).

This was simple and good. You can alter the amounts to your taste. The main thing, I think, is knowing these are called snow pea, or snap pea shoots, and getting a little green in your diet!

Easy and very tasty.  We added mushrooms and sugar snap peas along with pea shoots.  Tasted like the Chinese place down the road without the MSG.  Served with basmati rice, eggrolls, springrolls, and gyoza.

I was pleasantly surprised by how yummy this was.  I had gotten pea shoots in my csa box this week and did not know what to do with them.  Can't wait to make it again!

Very mild dish but one that compliments the other dishes on the menu. I forgot to get pea shoots but I continued with the recipe anyway :) Due to dietary concerns I used spelt flour instead of cornstarch but added a tablespoon of arrowroot powder with the broth to thicken the sauce. Delicious - especially when paired with Kale and Adzuki Beans (on this site) and served with rice.  Next time I'll add more garlic and maybe ginger and other spices if I plan to serve alone. Very nice and flexible dinner.

Totally skipped the pea shoots, took advice from others, doubled the sesame, threw in a dollop of soy sauce, some chili powder, salt and pepper, and chopped up a bit more garlic and onions (yes totally changed the whole thing around lol)
but it actually came out great - quick and easy with rice, and gave me a good concept of something to throw together in 15/20 minutes!

This is a great basic recipe that you can adapt to your own tastes and what you have on hand.  I do think there's too much broth in the recipe, and it badly needed garlic, ginger, and other flavorings to make it more interesting.  I had never used pea shoots before, so I didn't realize how woody and stringy some of the stems could be.  When I made this recipe a second time, I sorted the pea shoots into a pile of tendrils and leaves and a pile of thin stems.  I cooked the stems longer, which definitely helped.

This is like asian food meets italian.  Very tasty and healthy.  Marinated the chicken with garlic seasoning a touch of sesame oil and lemon peel/juice couple hours or so before putting on the corn starch and cooking.  Followed the rest of the recipe and what a hit this was Thank you

simple quick and tasty weekday meal. However, while waiting for the sauce to thicken, my pea shoots wilted too much, so next time will add them right at the end.

I made it and it was delicious.  Besides the pea shoots, I added some other greens like spinach which I found in a container at a health food store.  Thatâ€™s the only thing I changed and their have been requests to have it again.
