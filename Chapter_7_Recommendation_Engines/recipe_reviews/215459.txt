Tasty but the potatoes dont cook in that amount of time. I recommend that you nuke them or something first.  50 minutes in the oven it didnt get hot enough.  That being said, my daughter loved it anyway.

Great recipe for leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. My husband and I both loved it. I didn't think the potatoes would cook in that short of time, so I used the canned new potatoes and everything was done perfectly.

My family loves this!! I did cut up the potatoes and boil them half cooked before putting them in the recipe and I am glad I did! This is worth making again!!

As per other reviews, I had every intention of parboiling my potatoes before adding to the casserole but then I realized that the can of biscuits I had was 16 oz instead of 12 oz.  So I decided to save the time it would have taken to parboil the potatoes and added the extra biscuits in place of the potatoes.  Although I will make it again with the potatoes, it was still delicious without!  Perfect comfort food!

My potatoes cooked in the 40 minutes, but I cut them smaller and used red skins.  I didn't have any canned biscuits so I used a tube of crescent rolls.  This was a nice way to use some leftover turkey breast.

Wonderful comfort food with a lot of improvisational room to work with. I used a lot of different leftover elements with some trepridation, but it seems to me the "biscuit bombs" compensate for any minor variances (leftover veggies, potatoes and gravy) you might imagine. Guessing this has a buttload of calories, which to me was the only personal drawback because I went back for THIRDS!

This was tasty. I didn’t have any biscuits so I used crescent rolls instead. And I cooked the potatoes a bit first.  It was a little bland - next time, I’ll add more seasonings. This is a good recipe for leftover thanksgiving turkey.

Hubby liked it. I subbed Tater Tots for the potato and put on top.  Ground turkey was used and turkey broth Thickened with flour. The broth was frozen from previous meal instead of chicken soup.

It tasted pretty good but the potatoes were not cooked.  As another reviewer said, maybe nuke these first for a minute or two, then cut & add to mixture.  That or add 25degrees and another15 mins to cooking time.

I left out the potatoes to reduce the starch a little bit.  Everything else was as is and we loved it!
