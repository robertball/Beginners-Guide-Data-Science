Wow! This is sticky and makes a mess when applying but the end results make it all worth it. My face felt so soft and had a polished shine to it. I've never been into sugar scrubs but I stumbled on to this, had all of the ingredients on hand, and decided to give it a whirl. I'm sold! This was excellent!
