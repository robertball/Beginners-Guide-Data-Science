Excellent Excellent Excellent!   
     I made this for my daugher's class for her birthday and then turned around and made it for my sons class for his birthday the following week.  Very easy and so cute!  The second batch I made was for a preschool class so I added a broken pretzel rod in place of the popsicle sticks.  (easier for them to hold plus it made the whole thing edible)  So glad I found this recipe! It sure made my life easier with 2 birthdays back to back. It quickly went into my favorite recipe box.

These look really cool, but the work is not really worth it for me. I thought by reading the recipe it would not be that hard, but very time consuming....not meant for large quantities. These will expand a great deal during cooking, so don't place to close together on cookie sheet. Tasted good, but a pain.

I have made these 3 years running for my sons birthday treat to take to his class. He always requests them. Because they are time consuming i find it helpful to shape all the balls of each color after the dough has chilled then put them back in the fridge. I have even done this a day ahead and baked the next day. It helps to use parchment paper with the cream cheese based dough. Also the thicker sucker sticks (wilton makes some specifically for cookie suckers) work better. If you make these be prepared to share the recipe and be ready for the kids to request them over and over.

Excellent recipe! I used an 8 oz. package of cream cheese and modified the amount of the rest of the ingredients to make the dough. Turned out great. Used regular food coloring (didn't have any paste), and we (my kids and my nephews) made cookies for Mother's Day. Lots of fun, kids can get really creative w/ this dough. We didn't use sticks, just rolled into dime size balls, or multi colored ropes, and made designs. Will make again and again! Thanks for the recipe!

I made these cookies for my son to pass out to his teachers and bus driver along with thank you notes for his last day of kindergarten.  They are so colorful and cute and a great tasting cookie also.  I'm glad I did not read any reviews except the ones on the recipe page, because if I had, I probably would have added extra sugar, as other reviewers did.  I don't think these need any more sugar.  They are sweet enough, and buttery... yum.  The only change I made to the recipe was a neccessary improvisation.  I began making the dough before I realized we had used the last of the cream cheese (which I almost always have), so I subbed 1/4 C or so of sour cream and the texture of the cookie is wonderful!  I will definitely make these again!  (The kids haven't even seen these yet... they are in bed for the night... they're going to love them!)

5 stars for the concept alone.  I wish I read prior reviews of adding a tad more sugar.  Cookie itself tasted kinda bland-but not bad.  Maybe a 1/4 cup more sugar or even conf sugar.  Other than that it was fun and I think to make them look the prettiest its safe to roll the colors individually and gently attach them.  They get more tie-dye looking by adding all colors into one ball and rolling out.  Check out the pictures posted and you can tell the difference.
Will keep in my recipe box.

What a fun thing to make! I purchased wilton lollipop sticks, and had my five year old paint a terracotta pot. We inserted floral foam, stuck in the pops that we had wrapped in cellophane and tied with ribbons. Then we covered the floral foam with gum drops. My son calls it the 'CandyLand Suprise!" It was time consuming and made a huge mess of my kitchen, but it was worth it!!! Yummy Too!

What a fun project with the kids on an unexpected snow day.  It took a cookie or so to get the technique down (we were making the "snake" too thin) but even the mistakes have their own character.  I added the additional 1/3 cup of sugar as others had suggested and we didn't have a problem with bland cookies.  They are sugar cookies though, not super sweet like choco chip, etc.  Will definitely make again.

My kids and I had lots of fun making these cookies.  We ended up making two batches and passing some out as Easter treats to friends & family.  To make them more Easter-like we used pastel colors, and wrapped the cookies up in cute Easter gift bags with ribbons.  I followed the advise of others and added about 1/4 C more sugar so that they were sweet enough, and cooked the cookies for almost 12 minutes long so that they were not too soft.  I also added lemon extract instead of vanilla, because I like the flavor better.

This cookie was fun to make and the kids loved it but I thought it needed more flavor. It does taste good it just doesn't pop like I like in a cookie. I am sure I will use this again since the kids loved it.

SO CUTE!!  These get 5 for appearance, 3.5 to 4 for taste (I kept recipe as is, not adding any more sugar as others mentioned)!  I have wanted to make them for quite some time & my oldest son was having a cookie exchange in his class for Valentine's this year, so it was the perfect occasion!  Here is what I did that might help anyone making for the first time, I know it will make it easier for me the next time!  First, I only did 3 colours (per my pic), used pink, red and left one ball of dough as uncoloured.  I separated & coloured my balls of dough, then refrigerated until that evening when the kiddies were in bed.  I then made 24 mini balls out of each colour, working in batches as the dough softens quickly.  Once I had all of my min balls, I took one of each colour and instead of rolling all together, kind of joined or meshed them as I wanted my colours separate and not tie-dyed looking.  Once each colour was 'joined', I gently rolled into a snake and coiled.  I did this for all 24 & kept refrigerating once coils were done.  I found it much easier to insert my sticks into the cold dough, as opposed to into the softened dough.  I ruined a few as I thought you pressed the sticks in & the dough would cook around them.  DON'T DO THIS!  Physically insert from the bottom of the cookie so that the stick is right through it!  I hope that these few tips help...it will make it much quicker for me the next time!  I think they looked FANTASTIC all in baggies, tied with ribbon!

Very cute. Took the advice of another reviewer and dipped the sticks in egg whites. Also sprinkled course sugar before baking and the cookies look great.

These are wonderful for Kids!!  I give them 5 stars because kids love them, the flavor is good, they are not the best cookie I have ever had but that is not really the point.  I mixed everything in one bowl to save the mess and I thought they really assembled pretty quickly. Will make again for sure.

These were much easier to make than I anticipated.  I made a Valentine's Day version with different hues of pink doughs.  They rolled together nicely and baked up beautifully.  My kids gave these out to their friends, who just loved them.  These would be great for any holiday, and I plan on making green ones for St. Patrick's Day coming up.  Thanks for such a fun, versatile idea!

Although time consuming, I had a blast making these cookies.  They turned out great, though the taste is an acquired one. Reactions were mixed as the sugar flavor is very soft and in the Netherlands we are used to very strong sugar flavours.  All in all, a nice, not too sweet cookie! will make again :)

First of all, if you are looking for the best sugar cookie ever, look elsewhere. These cookies definitely score more points as a novelty item. However, they're still tasty. So, when you combine a decent taste with a fun, whimsical idea that has multiple options for presentation, these are fabulous! 
Next, these are time consuming! Definitely not something you want to make a couple of hours before the bake sale begins. I like to make the dough ahead of time, get help to tint the dough (especially if you want bright colors, it will take a good chunk of time to mix all the color in to the four different sections of dough), and then make all the balls before I refrigerate the dough. Then I chill it all overnight and make the cookies the next day. If you want to save even more time, you could divide the two just into two and make cookies with only two colors. 
Third, I never found anything called "paste food coloring." One time I made them, I used my Wilton Icing colors...worked fine but are harder to mix especially because they don't have a squeeze tube. What I use now is Betty Crocker Gel Food Coloring. Works great!
Fourth, I, like many other reviewers prefer a little more sugar...1/4-1/3 C. I also like a little more vanilla so I add about a 1/4 t more of that. 
Lastly, a tip for making cookies look like big "whirly pops" when you make one large ball out of the four balls, do NOT mix them up too much. Then, while you coil the dough, twist it as you go. 
Have fun with these!

These were good, however, I did not color and roll, instead I rolled out with a pin and made cut-out cookies, and the dough worked REALLY well for this! I did put the cut-outs on a stick and they "stuck" well. Will use again for "cookie pops."

Very cute but very time-consuming. I used the idea of "gluing" sticks in cookies with egg whites on the last 1/2 after having problems with sticks falling out. Wish I had read further to see one person's suggestion of adding coarse sugar on top. The cookies taste all right but are not terribly sweet. (This coming from someone who's not big on sweets.) You can definitely use regular food coloring as the paste version is not easy to find.

I made these for my son's bake sale and they are delicious. However, I had difficulty moulding the dough because it kept melting in my hands. Not sure if it was the temperature of my hands or home. But I could only manage to shape them into balls even after refridgerating them for another hour and cooling my home and my hands down. Nonetheless, they turned out great.

Definitely a hit!  Kids said they were favorite birthday treat this year.  I used small pretzels as the handles - Snyders of Hanover honey wheat.  Mine only made 22.

I made these cookies for my daughter to take to preschool for her birthday.  I was concerned however that the cookies would be 'bland' as others have stated.  So I added a bit more to it. I used 4oz of cream cheese, 1tbsp of vanilla and a 1/4c more sugar due to the extra cream cheese I also added 2tbsp of flour. I colored each section with wilton Abby Cadabby Sesamee Street colors.  I found the dough very easy to work with and tastes great now too.

This is a very good cookie to work with for both kids and adults! I have and will continue to make this recipe for yrs to come! The only thin I do different is I do NOT add vanilla extract, I always use emolsions. You can find them at hobby lobby. What they are is a thicker richer addative much like an extract but it doesn't bake out while cooking. I use one in this recipe called "sweet buttery dough" and it makes these cookies taste divine. They always look wonderful but the emolsion makes them taste equally good. There are several flavors of the emolsions such as sweet buttery dough, princess, and bouquet. They can be added to cookies, cakes, icings, ect.. Hope you will try them for yourself and agree that they make your bake goods great!!

I made these cookies exactly by the recipe and they came out wonderful. I may add a bit more sugar next time, maybe a quarter cup more, but other than that, the texture is wonderful, the dough colors very well and they were a hit at the baby shower I had (pink and brown were the colors of the cookies). Wonderful recipe, I can't wait to make it with other colors!

AWESOME!  These cookies not only tasted great, they were fun to make.  I rolled three logs, placed them side by side, and twisted them; then, I rolled one log with the twisted colors.  Thank you Christine M for that suggestion.  I only got seven cookies from the recipe so they were bigger than called for.  Therefore, I baked them 10-12 minutes.  Because some reviewers stated they needed more sugar, I then pressed the cookie into sugar crystals and attached the stick.  I used Wilton's "cookie sticks" because lollipop sticks would be too thin.   Thank you Terri for sharing such an AWESOME FUN RECIPE!

LOVED this recipe. I had no problems, I actually decided to make these last minute and I only refrigerated them for 20-30 minutes and they were easy to work with, not too sticky and it was fun rolling them out into ropes. I used powdered sugar to lightly dust my counter instead of flour.

I made these for Valentine's Day using red, pink, purple and white, wrapped each in cellophane,tied with a ribbon, then arranged them in a mug with styrofoam in it for a "bouquet".  Added candy conversation hearts on top of the styrofoam.  They were a huge hit!  Terrific teacher gift for teachers with little ones!  I also used parchment paper-lined cookie sheets.  Will use red, white and blue for 4th of July, red, green and white for Christmas, etc.  Thanks for the terrific recipe, Terri!

These are great!  My son and I made them together and had so much fun.  Definately have the time to do them as they are time consuming, but worth it.  I made the dough and colored it the night before.  The only change I made was adding more sugar per other reviews and they tasted great!  Thankyou for the recipe.

Next time I will increase the sugar and the cream cheese.  They were fun to make!  Just not very sweet for a "sugar" type cookie.

This was fun to do, and my kids loved it. Next time I will use a different sugar cookie recipe, though. This was soft and almost powdery in my mouth. Maybe I did something wrong, but I can't think of anything. Also, don't use the standard cookie sticks you can get at the craft store. Mine were way too thick and didn't work. Next time I'll get the thinner sticks.

This recipe is very time consuming. I did not have paste and used just regular food coloring. I wish I would have read the reviews prior and used additional sugar because the taste was a little bland. Next time I will add more sugar and some almond extract. I will attempt again.

This was a super fun activity to do with kids, I followed the recipe exact, and they are not super sweet, but still good.  I might add 1/4 C. more sugar next time.  Also there is no need to roll the individual colors into balls first, I just made a rough rectangle with each color and cut it into 24 even pieces and it worked great and saved some time!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

These are so cute! It's like you are really playing with Play Doh. I really recommend using the paste that the recipe calls for so you get the deep color without using a ton of food coloring. After I halved each color I halved them again and pre-rolled the first 6 balls of each color so I could ensure I'd have enough of each color for each cookie. I, at first, tried to the first 12 but they started to dry out. Once I got my rope formed I started forming the inside coil. After three loops I took the tail end of the rope and wrapped it around the coil. I found a bag of 100 6" sticks at Michaels and 100 baggies with ties that fit perfectly on the cookie. They also have a ton of different individual colored pastes to choose from. I will definitely be making these again!

The kids and I made these cookies as a flower pot arrangement for Christmas gifts for the neighbors! We didnt change a thing about the recipe! They were absolutely adorable and we got a terrific response.  We made them again for our Christmas Eve gathering and they tasted delicious and super fun to eat for all ages!   Looking forward to making them for other holiday events!

I got 4 dozen out of this recipe. I inserted the lollipop sticks to only 2 dozen and left them out for the rest. I increased the sugar by 1/2 Cup and I think thats a good amount. I found I had to leave the dough in the fridge  and do a few at a time because it softened quickly which made it impossible for me to roll, snake and coil.  I have to agree that this recipe is very time consuming but it is worth it especially on special occasions.  A huge hit with my daughter and I thought they tasted and looked pretty good as well.

I loved these!  They were alot of work so it's not a cookie I would make for everday but for special events they are perfect.  I made these for my oldest son's school bbq and I doubled the batch even.  They were gone in 15 minutes!  The kids loved them.  I plan on making them again for my youngest sons mother's day lunch at school.  I didn't change the recipe at all.

I have made these several times.  They are perfect and so much fun.  Just sweet enough and you can change colors for holidays.  Red and green for Christmas. Orange, black, purple and green for Halloween.  Silver and blue for Hanukkah.  You get the idea.  Love these!!

This is a great Grandmother recipe. Everytime my grandkids visit, we make these cookies.  We don't make the beautiful "suckers", but we do make worms, bugs, flowers, people and even cut out cookies.  This dough freezes beautifully, so I always have some on hand.

Overall, I really enjoyed making these cookies. I didn't get 24 cookies though. I think maybe I made mine a little too large. Even so, it's definitely a recipe I will try again. It is a little labour intensive, so I think because of that reason, I would do this again in a big batch. Meaning I would probably make four batches, colouring each batch a different colour in my mixer.

These came out cute.  They weren't the pain to make that some users said.  I also thought that 1 c. of sugar was not going to be enough so I increased to 1 1/2 c.  They were good.  I'd also advise to be wary of where you place the stick, because nearly all of mine fell out the back.  Place them more in the top half of the cookie's height since they will expand upwards anyway.

5 stars for cuteness, 4 for taste after some modifications and 3 stars for the final product.  I am so disappointed that my batch did not turn out the way that I hoped they would, but I will try them again sometime.  First of all, they are cute as a button and kind of fun to make.  For the dough, I added 1/4 cup of extra sugar and 1/2 tsp of almond extract as others have recommended.  The dough was tasty and the finished cookie tasted like a spritz cookie.  MAKE SURE TO NOT MAKE YOUR DOUGH BALLS TOO BIG OR THE ROPES TOO FAT!  This was my mistake.  Others have said that these cookies expand a lot.  They at least double in size, so stick your lollipop stick way far in the cookie.  My cookies are too soft and way too big and heavy for the sticks they are on.  They are still cooling, but I am quite sure that they will not be able to be eaten as suckers.  So sad ... I was making them for a church fundraiser, so I'm sure that I won't be able to bring them.  Live and learn, I guess.

They were pretty, but weren't sweet/flavorful enough for my family. Next time I will add lemon extract.

Kids like making these, especially the coloring and rolling, but they do lack flavor or sugariness, as the recipe is written.  Maybe some large grain sugar sprinkles on top would do the trick.

These were so pretty!  I added about 1/3 cup of sugar.  I also put my hands in flour each time before I rolled these out.  The dough was too sticky if I didn't.  I baked these for about 6 or 7 minutes, but I think I made mine smaller than the recipe says.

These are a little labor intensive, but the outcome is worth it. I made these as a treat for some of my second graders - they'd earned a reading reward. I rolled the chilled dough on a silicone mat which made the job much easier. I also chilled the formed coils for about 5 minutes before inserting the sticks. They were a big hit with the kids.

Easy and very pretty! I used 1/2 tsp. orange extract and 1/2 tsp. vanilla, but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Took me a few to get the hang of it, but if you twist the log before rolling into the cookie (like you would a candy cane type thing) I think the end result is very pretty!

I made these for a first grade Valentine party.  They were really easy to make.  They take no longer (except for the chill time) to make than a batch of cupcakes.  The results are adorable!  As far as taste, I thought they were kind of plain.  Regardless, I am sure the kids will love them!  Thanks for this fun recipe!

These are super fun and even more fun to eat.  I made this as written the first time and they were great.  I adjusted it a little more for our palette the second time.  Added 1/2 cup of sugar and sprinkled the cookie with green and red sugar crystals before baking.  Perfect and so pretty.  Thank you.  This is so much fun.

I made this recipe with my roommates, all of them over 19 years of age. It really brings out our inner children. Delicious as well! I was really pleased with the results after adding 1/3 cup extra sugar. This would probably also be wonderful with various other extracts like lemon or other fruit/nut extracts.

Cookies were good, not bland, but I did add an extra 1/3 cup of sugar to make them a tad sweeter.  I did have to bake 12 minutes, not 8 as stated.  Quite time consuming but the unique look seemed to be appreciated by my daugther's classroom.  Next time I will try to make with boxed sugar cookie mix to cut down on time.

I had to give these a three for taste. There is none!!! They looked really good and colorful. They did take a while to make but for presentation they were worth it. They just need more sugar or something to give them a cookie sweetness!

Now this is a five star recipe! I didn't make the suckers, but let the kids play with the dough like it was play dough and then baked their creations. They absolutely loved it! Thanks for the fun activity and really great cookie.

hmm... soft cheese in a cookie? I just had to try it coz the pic looked so bright and colourful. I had to use liquid dyes instead of paste, and I didn't get many cookies, I made them too big... they came out like saucers lol much to my daughters delight :) I didn't add extra sugar into the mix, however I did roll them out in icing sugar to stop them from sticking to the counter. Overall, they were fun to make and the taste... yummy! This recipe is definatley a keeper, thanks so much for sharing!

These are adorable!! I haven't tasted them yet but my son said they were good. He said he could taste the food coloring though ,so next time I'm going to add some lemon or orange zest to offset that. Otherwise..I'm happy with this.

These are so creative and fun!  They are also very time consuming.  The cookie itself isn't that sweet (which may be a perfect snack for toddlers).  Next time, I will follow the advice of others and add more sugar.  Also, as with others, my cooking time was about 12 minutes.

This recipe is adorable!  I made them for Valentine's Day for my toddler's school (I used pink, white and red coloring).  

I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar per another reviewer's advice (thank you!) and the cookies taste great! My dough was VERY stiff when I attempted to work the color into it (my house was cold), so I put the dough into the microwave for 15 seconds just to loosen it up.  That worked GREAT and it made the balls easier to work with before I rolled them into snakes.  I also cooked them a little longer 12-13 minutes. 

Such fun!  I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to help, she'll love rolling out all those little snakes!  Thank you for this AWESOME recipe!!!

Not only are these cookies absolutely adorable, they taste good too!  I made a batch this weekend and I'm already planning what colors to use for my next batch and have had lots of request for them.  Definitely a keeper recipe. The only change I made was I added an extra ounce of cream cheese. I expected them to be a lot more time consuming than they were, I started them at around noon and by 4 they were all cooked and ready to go.  Such a fun treat!

Very cool!  Made for a bake sale and were the first ones gone.  It is important to roll the "snakes/worms" the same size, because when baked some will be very brown while others under-baked.  I used popsicle sticks and just pushed down a little on the dough and they stuck just fine!  Thanks for sharing a fun recipe!

Very cute!! I used Purple and Pink for Valentine's Day for my daughter's preschool class. I wrapped the cookie with cute celaphane paper and tied a ribbon around the stick. Got lots of compliments.

Made these for my 2 yr olds Valentine Party at Pre-School and they were a HIT!  I too used halved pretzel rods so the kids could eat the whole thing.  They are little time-consuming, but when you become the "coolest" mom with the "coolest" cookies.... it's worth it!!

Adorable cookies!  I made these for Valentine's day using different shades of pink, red and a little white.  They looked great on my trays of V-Day cookies-I was really impressed with how pretty they were.  I am excited to try these at other holidays!  I am already imagining some cool patriotic ones for the 4th of July!  Thanks for sharing such a great idea with this recipe, I will be using this for lots of different occasions!

This was a fun recipe to make, and the kids loved it. It really does look like PlayDoh (we call them PlayDoh cookies now). We did leave the sticks out, because we had some trouble with that in the beginning.

One of my favorite cookie recipes. They are so soft and stay that way for a while if stored properly.

The color and idea is great, but the recipe leaves something to be desired. Cookies have a heavy, bland taste and seem to just sit in your stomach. Next time I'll try the same idea with my normal sugar cookie recipe.

These were so much to make! The kids at the after school program I work for loved this project. They were really tasty too. The only thing I had trouble with was knowing when they were done. I checked on them at the suggested time and they didn't look done, but then I overcooked them. I think if you cook them for as long as the recipe states, you should be fine. They harden when they cool.

I have four kids and babysit six more on the weekends. I was looking for something different and this was it. I followed the recipe exactly and they were so much fun. We have made them four times now and each time get more creative. My older two roll each color out in a snake, lay them side by side then roll them together gently like a snake then coil to get the alternate colors throughout the entire cookie. They really come out beautiful. The younger ones just take a bit of each color lay them end to end then roll out the snake and coil. After four batches of dough yesterday and tons of cookies later, I was getting tired. They went to bed and I rolled each remaining color into a log, put them together and put them in my cookie press. I put it in the freezer to chill while we did the bedtime routine afterwards. I just pressed them out and baked them in flower shapes, they came out great too and very colorful. They all love them and we will continue to make these. Great idea, thanks!

What a fun recipe to make with my three year old!  We made these for her older brother's Halloween Party at school...  A suggestion:  a lot of people said they felt the cookies weren't sweet enough.  Rather than add more sugar, when I added the color and shaped the cookies I used confectioners sugar to keep the dough from sticking to my hands.  =)

We used this recipe to make fun shapes instead of suckers and they were a hit! I used less sugar because I'm not a big fan of super sweet cookies and it was just perfect. I read that one reviewer said they used liquid food color, not the paste as the recipe calls for and bought some since my local store didn't have the paste. I found that the blue wasn't as true as the paste coloring is, but otherwise found no difference in texture. Thanks for posting this recipe, it's a keeper.

Excellent, Excellent, love this cookies.  Tried making it for my boy, almost followed the cookies exactly except that I substitute 3/4 cup of the flour with wholemeal flour and added 2 tablespoon of wheat germ to increase the nutritional content of the cookie.  My boy loves it and they look so lovely.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

i've made these for the 4th time now. I made them for my daughter's field hockey booster club sale out of their team colors. They went quickly and i had alot of disappointed kids after the game. They said, "you better make some more for the next game" so I did that today out of neon colors for pizzazz! If anyone is complaining about not being sweet enough, i substituted powdered sugar 2 - 1 of reg sugar and also rolling them in powdered sugar as they get sticky works really good too! And yes, they are time consuming but can u see a cuter cookie out there? And time consuming equals LOVE! At least that's what my mother-in-law says when she cuts grilled cheese sandwiches crosswise instead of straight across!

This is a really cute recipe. I made them for a soccer practice, and they vanished quickly. Has anyone tried to add any chocolate pieces yet? I was thinking about adding more color with mini m&m's. I'll report back if I do.

The kids love to both eat these(they are the 1st to go at parties) as well as make these cookies. Even my 3 yr old can do it with a little bit of help.   Takes awhile to make these the 1st time, but after that you get it down to a science.

This is the same recipe as "Play Dough Cookies" from this site.  i find this cookie to be absolutely YUMMY!  I don't think it is bland at all.  I use this recipe in plase of my other sugar cookies now because these are so great and they are so fluffy.  I use these for my kids b-day treats instead of cupcakes and everyone loves them.  I do sprinkle some sugar on before cooking and I think that I may try a clear glaze too, but really plain is wonderful too!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I was expecting the playdough type cookies that you find in groceries, but these were not that cookie. I added almond extract and 1/4 c additional sugar, and they still came out rather plain and unexciting. I put a raspberry glaze on them and they were much better, but I don't think I'd make them again.

These look really cool, but the work is not really worth it for me. I thought by reading the recipe it would not be that hard, but very time consuming....not meant for large quantities. I added the extra sugar as well, and I think it would have been easier if I had not chilled the dough. This only made the dough crack whereas when I first mixed the dough it was pliable like playdough. The recipe also fails to mention that these will expand a great deal during cooking, so don't place to close together on cookie sheet.

These were really easy to mix, shape and bake. I added lots of color so they looked great even after they were baked. I increased the time to closer to 10 or 12 minutes to get them done all the way in the middle. 
The only half-complaint I would have is that the finished cookie wasn't very sweet. I might add just a little more sugar next time. Although, my "guinea pigs" ate them up in short order... and thought they tasted great! My two year old son, especially, thought they were great! A cookie that looks like candy!

Maybe I was doing something wrong but even after chilling the dough for two days it was still entirely too sticky to roll into a coil.  I had my hopes up on this one and tried it twice and both times ended up tossing the dough in the trash.

This is a fantastic recipe! The dough is so easy to work with. I made it with my 4 and 7 yr olds, and it was a great project. The only change we made was how long to bake it, we found it took more like 12 minutes. Excellent!!

These cookies were so much fun to make!  They not only looked pretty, but tasted great too.  The cream cheese really makes a difference.

These cookies are worth the effort!! They came out sooo awesome when they were done and they got so many oooohs and aaaaahs at the bake sale.  Next year I will double the recipe!  Thanks Terri!
