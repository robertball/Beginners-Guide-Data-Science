Not sure what the others expected. This was a delicious sweet tart potato dish.  I cooked it along with another item so it cooked longer at a lower temperature but I didn't change the recipe otherwise. I did use gala apples,pale yellow-skinned potatoes and brown mustard (instead of yellow). Went great with roast lamb and duck with orange sauce. The whole family loved it!

I thought the ingredients in this recipe looked interesting so I tried it even though it had low ratings.  My husband and I really liked this recipe but it does have a sweet and sour flavor that's different from the norm.

I found this to be an interesting dish, however, I believe the key to making this taste good is the type of apple. If you want to make this, use a sweet and firm apple, like a Pacific Rose. Red or Golden delicious will turn to mush and Granny Smiths are too tart for a savory dish. To bring the potatoes and apples together, I also added onion and rather than using olive oil, I used peanut oil.

This was not very good.  The recipe did not call for a certain kind of apples, so I used Granny Smith, which is what you usually use in baking.  It was really sour, due to the apples and the cider vinegar.  Will not make again.

I was looking for a new way to make roasted potatoes and thought this looked interesting.  Unfortunately, I didn't like the taste at all.  I have no suggestions on what I would change....

I made these with honeyed lamb, and my picky husband ate these more than anything else. LOL :)  I used a firm apple type (a jonny mac hybrid) and cut the apple in larger pieces than the potatoes.  The potatoes came out at just the right firmness and the apples were a little soft.  I think next time I will add them later in the cooking time (maybe halfway through).  Oh, I also did you the Dijon mustard instead of basic yellow mustard.

Strange flavor. In addition, if I hadn't caught how bland it was before taking it out of the oven, it would have been a waste. Had to add salt and brown sugar before serving. Not going to cook this again.

Loved it!! My son said it was great because he loves the apple cider vinegar taste (which is why I chose to make it). I added carrots & prebaked pork chops...yummy!! My son liked the granny smith apple (I chose for the colour) but personally I would definitely choose a sweeter apple.  I had left over potatoes (only the potatoes) so the next day I added a few more boiled potatoes,green onion, celery, shredded carrots and mayo to make a potatoe salad....Delicious!!!

No one liked this at all.  Apples and potatoes just don't go together but I gave it a whirl.  Sorry.

My husband and I liked this a lot.  I increased the cooking time by about 10 minutes as the potatoes needed a bit more time.  I would make this again :)

The combination of ingredients reads like a child's science experiment and is devoid of any complementary flavors. I not only wasted the ingredients, but the sheet of paper printing out this recipe as well.
