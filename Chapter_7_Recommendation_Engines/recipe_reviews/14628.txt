I gave this recipe an excellent rating because with a little modifying- Sue's recipe is just the start of a terrific stroganoff.
* Substitute veg. oil for butter
* I used a sirloin steak. I partially froze it to make slicing strips thin and easy.
 * Fresh mushrooms are a must!! Baby bellas or crimini will do.
* A splash of dry sherry adds wonderful depth of flavor
*Beef broth will remove the coveted brown bits from bottom of skillet.
*8 oz of sour cream is sufficient
*Add Paprika, freshly grated black pepper & kosher salt to season dish to perfection.
 My food critics, a husband and five kids loved it. Even the vegetarian high school senior loved the mushroom loaded sauce. Thank you, Sue for the beginnings of a mouth-watering dinner.

One of my favorite quick dinners, so much better than overpowering good beef with cream of mushroom soup! I saute mushrooms along with the beef and onions and add 1/2 teaspoon of paprika before adding the sour cream. 16 oz of sour cream is too much however, I think 8 oz is about right. Make sure you don't overcook the beef and be very carefull after adding the sour cream, if you bring it to a boil it will curdle, just let it warm up and serve immediately.

I have made another stroganoff from this site and it was amazing...and this one just didn't wow me like the other did.  It turned out very runny and truly didn't taste very well.  All the same, thanks for posting.

I followed every instruction and would NEVER make this again.  The sauce did not turn out very smooth. My advice is this - do not try to make a stroganoff dish without the cream of mushroom soup!

It WAS easy....but it turned out quite soupy.  Once I put the sour cream in, it never got creamy.  I wouldn't make this again.

I recently made this dish for my husband and my self.  Neither one of us enjoyed it.  It tasted like you were eating a tub of sour cream.  I would not make this dish again.

So very bland.  Needed some seasoning of any sort.  Made the base recipe and like previous reviews needed to add ingredients to give it any flavour.  Added mushrooms, Garlic, bit of paprika.   Salt - pepper.   Would be a shame for someone who had no clue on cooking to tackle this as their first attempt at stroganoff.  They would never make it again!

Pretty good for a simple stroganoff.  I put the beef in wheat flour (seasoned with salt, pepper, and paprika) before cooking.  I also added garlic, sliced fresh mushrooms, paprika, and red wine to the sauce.  I used less sour cream (reduced fat) than called for and it came out pretty good.

This was a big disapointment. The flavor of sour cream overwhelmed the dish, that really did not make as much as claimed. The bland flavor was really in need of a good kick. Will NEVER make again.

I made this recipe on August 26, 2001, for some company I had over.  I dont know if i did something wrong, i dont know how i could, but it was VERY bland and too soupy.  We had to throw it out.  I will not make this again.

used filet mignon cubes; added mushrooms that were cooked in butter and a little sherry (leftovers).  floured the meat before frying.  helped thicken the sauce which was beef broth, added cream cheese and the sour cream. i know i tweaked this a lot, but the end results were fabulous for us.

Very good. I rolled the beef in flour & paprika, and then sauteed with onions, fresh mushrooms & butter. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup with the sour cream. Then I mixed it with  1 lb. cooked bow tie noodles & a little fresh pepper. Everybody loved it!

I used this recipe as a starter for my left over steak, I sauteed onion added canned mushroom, I would have preferred fresh, but we were in a pinch tonigh.  I used a tsp of beef broth, and a half C. of water, and a little wondra to thicken the sauce less sourcream would have been sufficient, I used half the amount called for and it was still to much.  For a last minute use up what we have on hand, the recipe turned out great!

I drained the beef after cooking it, added half a can of beef gravy, about 8 oz. of fat free sour cream, a 4 oz can of mushroomes (drained) and added salt, pepper and paprika to taste. I also didn't use any onions.  My very picky kids even liked it.

My mom introduced me to this recipe right after I returned home from school two years ago, and it has been a regular meal for my family and I! It's quick and easy (just like I prefer,) the sauce is rich, and the meat tender! I tend to add seasoning salt to kick the taste up a notch.

I used this recipe as a base, and added several ingredients of my own. My old man went NUTS over it- said it was as good as his mother used to make him for his birthday dinner 40+ yrs ago. 
I browned 2.5 lbs of stew beef in a tbsp of coconut oil, seasoned it with Montreal steak seasoning, then diced it into smaller cubes, chopped one large white onion, (could have used two) 24 oz sour cream, 4 oz cream cheese, and 8 oz sliced white mushrooms..served over a bed of wide egg noodles. We had a baby romaine salad with chopped walnuts, feta cheese, tomato with a homemade balsamic and extra virgin oil poured over the top and sprinkled Italian seasoning.

I liked it.  I only had half the sour cream so I added a can of Mushroom soup.   It still had the creamy tecture but added a nice flavor.  Would work best with stew meat (I only had stir fry strips on hand).  Will make again.

Try adding a jar of tomato sauce to this. Thats how I've always made beef stroganoff, my mom's way.  I love it with rice or egg noodles and some garlic bread!!

This was as stated a very basic recipe.  I added a container of mushrooms and served it over egg noodles.  It was very bland and soupy.  I will be trying Slow Cooker Beef Stroganoff III next in my search for the perfect stroganoff to add to my rotation.

Made this as recipe stated. I never serve till I taste. It is a great start to a great recipe. Just by the recipe it (to us) didn't have enough flavor. So I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and a pack of fresh baby Bella's. Salt and pepper to taste and boom!! Perfect. Good recipe as is but adding our stuff made it perfect.

substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream.  got a chunky mess. the butter and cream stayed separted and was inedible.  I strongly do not recommend this recipe.

i thought this recipe was good my kids liked it alot. i did change the serving size to 3 and only added about a half a cup of sour cream, salt and pepper to taste and i also added a little corn starch to thicken the sauce. turned out very well.. will make this again. thanks for listing this recipe.

My husband loves Stroganoff and he liked this recipe.  I think maybe I added too much sour cream, and will add less next time.

Something is missing from this dish. It was bland and too watery. My husband added parmesan cheese to his serving and that livened it up a bit. I was looking for something thicker with alittle kick to it. I won't make this again.

This is a good, simple dish. I accidentally used fat-free sour cream, and it still turned out okay. Delicious over egg noodles! Next time I plan to use less onion and add mushrooms.

I found it a little bland. Next time I plan to put gravy along with the sourcream to give some taste.

This was a good recipe.  I cooked the beef in my pressure cooker first to ensure tenderness, but overall very good:-)
