Loved this recipe! You can also rehydrate them by putting them in 4 cups of water, bring to a boil for 2 mins and then shut off the heat and let sit for 1 hour. Drain, dry off, and then season with oil and the spices you desire.

I am happy to find this recipe. I suggest ordering the giant white corn (GOYA) online...Amazon has it.

Ladies and gentlemen grab your remotes and cold beers, the perfect snack has arrived. The recipe works perfectly for light and super crunchy corn nuts, not hard like store bought. I used tajin spice and loved it.  
Thank you for the recipe.

This sounds great But I can't find giant white corn (such as GoyaÂ®) wherever I look.

Just discovered this snack and the family loves it. However, I don't have a working oven and the fat needed for stovetop frying is over the top. 

This recipe has perfect cook times, which is all that I needed! Thank you!
