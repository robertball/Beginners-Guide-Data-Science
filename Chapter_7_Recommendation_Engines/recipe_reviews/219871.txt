This is extremely good and very easy. I used 6 chicken breasts which I cut into chunks and marinated, and it worked very well with the chicken. Also, I didn't have the buttery spread so I substituted some canola oil. It's a wonderful, light recipe which I can't wait to make again!

This recipe is amazingly delicious! I used 1 tbsp of olive oil instead of Melt® Organic Buttery Spread for the porc and marinated the tenderloin in a ziploc for over 24 hours. The marinade was incredible. I prepared the sauce but honestly, the tenderloin was great without it. I did not skewer the tenderloin either. I grilled it whole, 7 minutes to sear the first side, over direct, medium heat (keeping the grill covered), then 6 minutes on the second side. Finally, turn off the heat, keep the lid closed, and let the tenderloin coast for 5 more minutes until it reaches an internal temperature of 145° to 150°F.

My husband made this for dinner tonight and it was PHENOMENAL. I think it's the best pork I've ever eaten. I think the servings are off though, as we only had 3 servings (each serving about 3 chunks of meat) after trimming the fat. I would recommend getting more than 2 lbs of tenderloins unless you're feeding 3 or less. Also, we served it with grilled zucchini, onion & tomato instead of rice - makes for a nice healthy meal.

YUM!  I did not have all the right ingredients, but I made this anyway with some substitutions:  butter-flavored olive oil for the submitter's butter Melt; half soy sauce half oyster sauce for the fish sauce; my acid was half lime half lemon; my white vinegar was white balsamic; only half the red pepper flakes (you have to know your audience). It sounds like a lot of differences from the original recipe, but really they aren't that different if you look at it carefully.  I served this with sticky rice (Calrose), and we loved every bite!  Thanks for this lovely dinner tonight!

The sauce in particular was very good.  I just sauteed the pork in a pan because I don't have a grill, but it still turned out very well.

My family raved about this meal. The sauce is one of the best I've had. I used olive oil in the marinade but that is the only change I made.

The marinade for the pork was delicious.  I don't have a grill so I stir fried the pork after marinating it and a 2 lb tenderloin was gone by the end of the night.

I used olive oil in the marinade and even though the pork marinated for a little less than an hour, the meat was surprisingly flavorful. I goofed and put the chopped cilantro in the marinade but the thin slices cook so quickly, it turned out better to have cilantro on each piece rather than sprinkled on the top.  I skipped the skewers and grilled them on a grill on the stove top.  The dipping sauce was really good.  We eat a lot of Asian food and so do our friends.  They thought it was delicious.  Plan to make up a couple pounds of this yummy stuff for Superbowl Sunday.

AMAZING!  Recently moved and sauce reminds me of the Thai restaurant we had to leave behind.  Super easy, also substituted with olive oil.  Have made it twice now with pork, then with chicken and was wonderful both ways!

This pork marinate created the moistest pork loin I have ever had. I was floored at how good it was. The dipping sauce on the side is great as well. I worked in a Thai restaurant for 10 years and this really is a simple and legit Thai sauce. I'd add some Thai chili's to both sauces for heat enhancement if you like hot. I will be making this again!!

This is an excellent recipe.  The only substitution I made was to replace the Melt with oil and I used only 1 clove of garlic in the sauce as we don't love raw garlic. Was very easy and delicious. Will definitely make again.

I forgot to make the dipping sauce but the grilled marinated pork alone was great tasting. Next time I'll remember to make dipping sauce ahead of time.

Fantastic recipe! I substituted coconut oil for the canola oil and stir fried the pork rather than grilling but it tasted great anyways. My husband loved it. - Thanks for a great recipe to add to the rotation.

This is Amazing and love it. Never had this in a restaurant so did not know what to expect.  Makes the tenderloin very juicy and tasty.  The sauce idea was frightning at first, however, it totally is an amazing taste. So trust this one it won't let you down expecially when you marinate for 8hrs and know how to grill.

This was very very good!!! I made it with thinly sliced pork loin (as opposed to pork tenderloin) since that is what I had on hand. I didn't want to skewer it so I placed it on a grill rack that I use for grilling fish (it has centimeter sized holes in it so the food won't fall through). I cooked it with high temp and tossed it around on the rack. Next time I will garnish with chopped peanuts in addition to the cilantro. Definite keeper!!!

One of the best recipes on this site!  Made it exactly as written except I didn't have skewers so I sliced the tenderloin into medallions and grilled them like little hamburger patties and I also didn't have the "Melt Buttery Spread" so used vegetable oil. Served with rice and I wanted some veggies with it so I pan sautéed some sliced zucchini and onion "sticks" (I lay the onion on the cutting board with the stem and stalk facing out to the sides and slice it in half then put the cut half down and slice like you are cutting a pizza but in smaller narrower pieces then break each little stick apart) in some butter on the stove and left them a little crunchy and put the veggies on top of the rice, then the grilled pork medallions on top of that and then poured the heated sauce over. It was amazing!  And very quick if you have the pork tenderloin on hand.  Doesn't have to marinate too long!  Can't believe more people haven't discovered this recipe!  And we are not particularly lovers of Thai food but we do like tangy and spicy food.  Also this marinade made the pork very, very tender and I only marinated the cut slices for 30 minutes. THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!

OMG!!! This is SO easy, incredibly delicious and a MUST DO recipe!!! After being on allrecipes.com since inception, this is one of my favorite recipes!! I will be making that dressing for my salads also from now on. Thank you and my husband thanks you as well!!! Let your meat rest for at least 5 minutes after taking off the grill...as you should with anything you grill except hot dogs. :)

This recipe was awesome. I followed the recipe but used olive oil instead of the butter and marinated it all day. My company loved it as well. I will definitely make this again.

We made this recipe recently and it was excellent...definitely a keeper! The only changes we made were to use olive oil instead of the Melt spread, we left the tenderloin whole and marinated it overnight in a vacuum sealed bag. We served it over jasmine rice with butter beans as a side. Very tender and flavorful.

I didn't grill it or make the sauce and it was still delicious.
