I had high hopes for this cookie, but for some reason the rice krispies turned out hard and difficult to chew once these were baked!  Otherwise, the taste was good.  I'll stick to making oatmeal cookies or rice krispies treats, but the combo here just didn't work for me.

My kids love these cookies as an afterschool snack. They turn out equally well without the coconut (if you have one who won't eat coconut like I do). Chewy, crispy...and best of all, EASY to make!
