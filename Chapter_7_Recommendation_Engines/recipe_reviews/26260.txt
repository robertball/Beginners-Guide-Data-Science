This was to die for!! It was very rich.  It could easily be made lighter by substituting low fat/fat free mayo, sour cream, and soups.  Can't wait to make it again!!

This recipe went over really well with everyone at our house!  I would suggest pre-cooking the onions a bit as they were a little crunchy.  I added some Tyme and ground pepper for a bit more flavour and used some mozzarella with the cheddar cheese.  I also COVERED it to bake it, then removed the foil for last 10 minutes and broiled to brown the top.  Very good recipe.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. My husband did not care for it because he prefers my "real" lasagna, but found it better the second day.  Onions are a lot better when cooked!  Picky kids didn't mind it either!! Will definitely make again.  Oh, and I substituted ricotta for the mayo! Yum!

I tried this recipe for a candidate for a wedding reception.  I made the following changes: 1: I cooked my chicken in water with one envelope of Lipton's Golden Onion soup mix, reserved liquid 2: Added 16 oz bag of frozen broccoli 3: Combined chicken, soups, parmesan cheese, ommitted sour cream, added 4oz Cream cheese, garlic powder and italian seasoning to taste, and 2 cups of reserved liquid from chicken. 3: I then layered sauce, uncooked noodles, sauce, broccoli, Italian cheese, noodles, sauce, broccoli, cheese...ended with noodles, sauce and cheese..then poured remaining liquid from chicken over top, baked in oven, covered for about an hour, then uncovered for about 15-20 minutes or until brown....This turned out really good...For the reception, I am thinking about making this in lasagna rolls for an elegant presentation..I'll update on the results..

Very tasty recipe, but definately rich with all the soup and cheese.  After reading other reviews regarding the strong onion flavor, I tried using 3 Tbls. of dried minced onion soaked in an equal amount of cold water to reconstitue. (2 T. dried minced is normally equal to 1/3 c. fresh minced or 1 med. onion, chopped) Then I added it to the soup mixture after sqeezing out the excess water.    This worked very well for two reasons.  Because of the minced size it seemed to distribute throughout the dish well; and it made the lesser amount of onion enough to add flavor without being overwhelming.

All I can say is YUCK!! But... my boyfriend absolutely LOVED it, so I gave it a rating of 3 stars. I guess it's a matter of "to each, his own," but I thought it was WAY too rich (and I love rich foods), WAY too salty and even the smell of it made me sick. It was just too ooey and gross for me. My boyfriend felt bad that I hated it though because he loved it so much and wanted me to make it for him again! He had 2 huge helpings! Maybe I'll try it again, but with garlic powder, not garlic salt, and I'll add some sort of veggie like asparagus or broccoli to absorb all the goo. Good luck to whoever tries it - it's definitely a hit or miss recipe.

My attempt at this recipe was rather dissappointing because it came out too salty and I can't figure out why.  However I would try it again making sure I keep track of the salt content and I would also saute my onions before adding them to the dish.

I made this last night for supper and my 8 yr old son who is a very picky eater absolutely loved it. My friend and her son also came by and  had dinner with us.  The only adjustment that I will make it to saute the onions with butter before adding.  Other than that, dish was perfect. Will definitely make again and forward to friends and family.

This is a GREAT recipe.  I added a little italian seasoning in the sauce because I thought it might be a little bland without it.  I don't care for ricotta cheese and was pleased to find a recipe for lasagna that didn't call for it.  It was delicious and everyone raved about it.  VERY rich.

After seeing all the gushing reviews, I couldn't wait to try this recipe.  Out of the 7 people in our family, 2 liked it okay and 5 asked me not to make it again.  It tastes a lot like tuna noodle casserole with chicken instead of tuna.  Not a bad recipe but nothing special and not much flavor.

Very good, I simplified it a lot though. I used egg noodles instead and just mixed one can of cream of mushroom soup, a tablespoon of minced onions,and some shredded Italian cheeses, 1/4 c of sour cream, and a couple dabs of miracle whip. Threw it all together and topped it with more cheese and some bread crumbs and baked it. Was done in 30 minutes.

My husband and I both agree, with a sacrilegious name like "Chicken Lasagna" this dish wouldn't have been something we would order at a restaurant. But oh boy, after having tried this recipe, we have added it to our regular meal rotation! Made exactly as directed and loved every bite of it! PERFECT.

Very tasty, the only thing I didn't like was the chicken chunks, maybe next time I'll try shredding it or cutting smaller, but some may like it like that.  Very good flavoring.

my family, my parents and myself all loved this lasagna. i cooked the onions, added diced celery, and the chicken, s&p, then i added 3 diced cheddar sausages and put it all into the sauce and also about a cup more cheese on the top and served it with cesaer salad. Looking forward to the one piece left for lunch tomorrow! I'll most definitely make it again..

Followed the instructions exactly as stated and it was absolutely outstanding. I had never made lasagna in my life, so it was pretty risky making 2 of them for the first time to serve as the main dish for a large birthday party. Everyone raved and almost everyone asked for seconds!

This was really good!  I cooked the onion like others suggested.  I also left the mayo out because that didn't sound appetizing, and used garlic powder instead of salt.  I only baked for 40 minutes when I noticed the top was browning.  One hour seems way too long!  Will definitely make again!

This lasagna was delicious!!  I did, however, make several alterations after reading other reviews about how gooey and rich it was.  Wasn't too keen on the high fat/caloric content, so I added 1 bell pepper (diced) and 2c. chopped, lightly steamed broccoli to the soup mixture, along with black pepper.  I also used light mayo, and replaced the sour cream with nonfat, plain Greek yogurt (I replace all sour cream with this - flavor is comparable and MUCH healthier).  Also, I used whole wheat lasagna noodles and only 2c. cheddar cheese.  Very delicious and and improved nutritional value!  Will make again and use "light" in both the soups next time.

Very rich but very good recipe.  I sauteed the onions with the chicken and added some minced garlic.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  I would like to find a way to alter this to not be so rich.  My 5 year old gobbled it up but my 3 year old wasnt fooled into thinking it was "regular" lasagna.  Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out prety darn good. I did make a few changes. I sauteed mushrooms and onions and placed them ver the chicken and cheese when layering. I also left out the mayo and replaced with ricotta cheese. This is one of those dishes that is way better the next day ~ as the favors all *soak in*.

This was good.  Do not add any salt; there is enough in the soups.  I cooked some mushrooms and added that to the soup mixture.  Next time I will cook the onions with the mushrooms to tenderize them.

Great recipe.  Sauce is delicious!!!  After reading some reviews about the onios, I sauteed them in a little of butter/olive oil before adding them to the soups mixture.  Besides that....this is a recipe you do not need to make any change at all.  Feeds a lot of people.  Serve it with garlic bread!!!

OMG we love love loved this recipe! We had family over for Valentines day and this was a huge hit, everyone loved it! So easy to make and the leftovers were just as good as the origional! We followed the recipe exactly (minus the onions) and to cut some fat grams we used fit and active cream of mushroom and chicken soup!! Definitely going to make this again!

This was OK.  It needs more flavor, but I'm not sure what else to add.  Don't make my mistake of using oven-ready lasagna noodles.  They stay pretty crunchy in this recipe.  It didn't affect the flavor though.

This is a keeper recipe.  It was a super easy and tasty!  This recipe had rich and creamy flavor which works very well with salad as a side.  This, however, is not a spicy meal so if that's what your looking for, keep looking.

Maybe it's just me but I didn't like the way it tasted AT ALL.  My husband wouldn't eat the left over's either .  I suggest finding another recipe for Chicken Lasagna.

I took some other reviewers suggestions and sauted onions and mushrooms instead of adding onions to the soup mixture.  I also added Italian seasoning.  It was so good!  Even my daughter, who usually barely clears her plate, kept coming back for more.  I've found another recipe to add to the "rotation".  Thanks for submitting Kristle.

Very good recipe.  It was my first attempt at a chicken lasagna, and the reviews were great.  However, my husband and I both decided that there were definitely too many onions.  I would cut it down to at least half a cup if you're not obsessed with onions.  But other than that, very delicious.

I took the advice of multiple reviews and tweaked this alot.  I sauteed onion and garlic first.  I added spices to the soups like parsley, sage, italian seasoning, and oregano.  I steamed one small bag of spinach and drained well then added to second level.  Finally, I tossed the diced chicken with prepared pesto (about 1/4 c.) I had on hand before adding it to lasagna-try to get more of the pesto & less of the oil from jar.  Everyone loved it even the 2yr old.  It's hard to rate the original recipe with all the adjustments but I really like this.  Thanks for the base.

THE BEST!  I used ground chicken vs. diced and it tasted great.  I played with the spices, too-onion powder, garlic powder, basil, marjoram, parsley and chicken seasoning.  My husband couldn't get enough!  Thanks so much, Kristle!

This recipe is a keeper.  I did make a few changes.  Because of some of the reviews that the onion wasn't cooked I sauted onions and about a cup and a half of mushrooms togeather until they were soft.  I also added poltry seasoning to the chicken while it was cooking and Italian seasoning to the creamy mixture. It was very good serve it with a good salid and crusty bread.

Thank you!!! This recipe was a hit everyone loved it and couldn't get enough. I followed the recipe to the tee, expect i used garlic powder in place of the garlic salt. I felt the soup is salty enough.

I didn't care for this as much.  It tasted fine, but I just found it way too gooey!  It needs something to soak up some of that sauce.  A few ideas that were mentioned were using some veggies like spinach, using one can of soup, or even using ground chicken instead of chopped.  
Anyway, good recipe, just needs some tweaking!

Very good. Only added a small amount of Spinach to the center layer and it was perfect. I made it the night before and then baked it. Our company went back for seconds. Always a good sign. Really easy too. Thanks.

Very delicious!  I also added some frozen, sliced carrots to add color and another texture and it turns out well.  I have made it a few times and it has always been a big hit.

This was tough to rate as my family enjoyed it (maybe 4 stars) but I thought it was too heavy & rich.  I did substitute onion powder for the chopped onion, added a litle garlic powder and sliced fresh mushrooms, & used 1/2 cheddar & 1/2 mozzarella, instead of just cheddar.

Was very tasty.  I will make again.  The only thing I would change about it is that I would use a smaller pasta so there's more with each bite.

I looked in my refrigerator and saw all I had was chicken.  I got tired of doing the same old things with chicken.  I stumbled upon this site and Kristle's recipe.  I had company over for dinner that night and this cooked up really well.  The kids loved it and this is something I'll make again.  Has anyone tried this recipe with just vegetables?  Which ones work best?  Thanks Kristle and her Dad!

Only used 8 oz (2 cups shredded) cheese and this was Delicious!!!
It's definitely a heart-attack waiting to happen (very high fat/calories,) so I suggest to only make it for potluck for co-workers, or at home when you want to make something quick but yummy.

Great recipe. I did saute the onions, with some muhrooms, and added a splash of sheery to the mushroom sauce. I didn't use cream of chicken because I didn't have any. Very good and a keeper.

This is a good recipie. My husband loved it.  The next time I make it, hopefully I will not be in such a hurry.  I only baked it for 30 mins.  The only change I would have made was to sweat the onions first.  But maybe the extra cooking time would have cooked the onions more.  This was not kid friendly at my house, but it could have been from the "raw" tasting onions. But definately worth a try again.

I thought this dish was very good.  I used wheat noodles to make it a little healthier.  I omitted the garlic salt based on other reviews that the dish turned out too salty.  I added some extra parmesan cheese and didn't miss the garlic at all.  When I make this again, I think I will make it a day ahead since it was even better the next day.

I made this for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day and we both enjoyed it very much!!!  It was something either of us had had before and we were pretty impressed on how good it tasted.  He asked me when  I was going to make it again! :)

My husband has always loved my cooking, but the first time I made this, he told me it was the best thing I ever made!  I did make a few changes to the recipe though.  I used more than 9 noodles (more like 12), and added chicken with fresh sliced cremini mushrooms for one layer and chicken with well drained spinach on another.  Yum!

Loved this!  Quick.  Easy. Yummy.  How can you go wrong with that?  Was looking for something to do with leftover chicken.  This fit the bill!  Made it pretty much as written, except added some shredded carrots to the soup mixture for some extra nutrition.  I'm thinking that I might add some mushrooms the next time.  Definitely a keeper!

Pretty good. I sautéed the onions as suggested in other reviews. I halved everything since I was only cooking for 1. I also used penne since I didn't have lasagna noodles. Tasted kinda like a chicken alfredo bake more than a lasagna. Great change for using my leftover rotisserie chicken.

My husband put this on the top ten! Very rich and delicious.  Next time I will serve with a crisp garden salad instead of garlic toast - the lasagna on it's own is cheesy and filling.  No need for bread!

Delicious!  I've made this 3 times now and received rave reviews each time.  I  used mozzerella and cheddar for the cheese.  After the first time, I put some of the cream mixture on the bottom of the dish to prevent the noodles from getting too hard.  It worked well.

One of my family's favorites for group gatherings.  Make a regular lasagna with this chicken white sauce lasagna and you have a ton of compliments to the chef.

This tasted really good.  The only problem I had was that the bottom layer of noodles got hard.  I don't know if maybe this shouldn't cook so long or what. An hour for ingredients that just need to be heated through is a long time. The chicken on top and the cheese got kinda hard too.  Next time I plan on cooking for only 35 to 40 minutes. Just to heat thru.  I also sauteed the onions in margarine before I added them.  I think with a shorter cook time, this will be PERFECT!

turned out very well, I used all light ingredients, added mushrooms, and sautéed the mushrooms and onions before I added them to the mix.

This recipe was GREAT, I have made it 2 times and the first it was very good but a little bit on the bland side for our cooking style but the 2nd time we added some cajun seasoning and used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt... oh man it was superb.

This recipe was alright, but it didnt do much for me. It was missing something and it wasnt enough sauce for me. I used more noodels and left out the sour cream or mayonnaise. With all the oinion on it the children were reluctant to eat it. Overall I would have added more cheese (mozzerella) and all of the ingrendients.

I don't know what it was but something about this combination of flavors didn't work for me. My boyfriend thought it was good but I think I just couldn't get over the strange consistency and appearance of the shredded chicken with the tomato sauce.

This was great!  I was a little uncertain and thought the ingredients didn't have much pizazz, but it turned out very tasty!  I used no-boil noodles, which made the sauce soak into the noodle just right.  I also added a can of veg-all to the soup mixture to get some veggies in!  Great recipe, will add it to my regulars.

This recipe is very easy and pretty tasty.  It's something I'll probably make often just to get away from the normal lasagna.

So good!!!!! I added mushrooms and red bell peppers and instead of mayo I used whole Greek yogurt. Also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt (as others suggested) so that it wouldn't end up too salty. My parents are kind of picky about baked dishes and they both loved it! The texture and flavor was phenomenonal. Oh one other adjustment was I used a cheddar/mozzarella blend rather than just shredded cheddar. 5 stars though for sure!

This recipe was great.  I took leftovers to work and was asked for the recipe.  It also reheats nicely.  It is not dry at all.  We reheated in microwave and it tasted just as good as it did when it came out of the oven.  An easy recipe to follow.  Thanks!  My husband says this is a keeper.

Really good.  Precooked the lasagna noodles and it took about 40 minutes to bubble up when baking.  All liked!

This recipe was pretty good, but a bit too rich for our families taste. I did add zuchini to the recipe, and felt like that was a really nice addition.

Easy, Delicious, but I am sure you can make a few ingredient changes, like greek yogurt for the sour cream to lower the fat.  Everyone in the family loved it and asked that I make it again!

This was a big hit!  I substituted regular lasagne noodles for gluten free due to an allergy.   Everyone loved it.
