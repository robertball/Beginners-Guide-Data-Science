Made the quiche and mostly followed the recipe; however I had a bit more chicken 2 cups threw it in prefer the taste of shallots to green onions so used about 3/4 cup of chopped shallots. I also sprinkled some chopped parsley on top. I also had to leave the quiche in the oven for 45 minutes as the centre wasn't cooking. The top came out golden brown! Let the quiche sit at least one hour to finish setting. Delicious! Serve with your favourite salad!
