This recipe was pretty good, but it seemed to be just a little bland.  I added about 3 T soy sauce, some salt, and pepper and I thought it was great.

Perhaps I shouldn't really be rating this recipe as I used bite sized pieces of chicken instead of shrimp but I thought it was very tasty and easy. With the exception of the garlic, I chopped/sliced the vegetables earlier in the day which made this a very easy and quick recipe. I did need to cook the zucchini and bell pepper about twice as long as the recipe called for and I didn't add the garlic until about a minute before I added the pineapple, onions and juice in order to prevent it from burning. I also think it needed some salt or perhaps some soy sauce. I do plan on making this again (next time with shrimp) and when I do I will probably double the amount of bell pepper or add a half cup of green bell pepper in addition to the red.

I made this recipe last night for dinner, and I have to say I was VERY disappointed with it. Not that it was bad - it was just  "okay". Very bland and not very exciting. I don't even know what could be done to "jazz it up" - it was just a whole lotta nothin'.

This was a very easy recipe that tasted great.  I liked that the pineapple made it sweet - but not too sweet.  My guests were very impressed!

Not bad but not great. I took note that this was a bland recipe so I added salt, pepper, soy sauce but it was still bland. My husband said this was too sweet, maybe I should have added even more soy.

This recipe is great b/c it is easy.  Easy to make and easy to adapt.  I added a little cumin to spice it up and splashed it with soy sauce for flavor before eating.

This didn't have much flavor. I added soy sauce to jazz it up a little bit. I liked that it was healthy and quick though.
