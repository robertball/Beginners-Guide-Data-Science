I use my own homemade dry ranch dressing mix and I up the cayenne to a full teaspoon. We LOVE these pretzels. I do bake mine but really, it's a personal preferance that I do that and not reflective of the recipe. GREAT movie night snack!

THESE ARE SO GOOD !  It was so hard not to eat them all before I gave them to my daughter.  I bought cheap pretzels and had all the other ingredients. I would definitely make these again.

I made these for the first time at Thanksgiving....wow great snack and addictive!  I did reduce the amount of oil to 1/2 cup based on previous reviews I read.  Just made two batches for my youngest adult son who just LOVES them!
