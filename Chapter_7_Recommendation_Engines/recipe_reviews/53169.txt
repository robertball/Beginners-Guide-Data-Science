These are great! I've made these twice and the second time I added a teaspoon of salt to the sugar mixture - oooh, they were really tasty.  They tasted like the peanuts in a box of Cracker Jacks.  As another person said, just keep stirring - the liquid will evaporate eventually, I promise (it took me 15 - 20 minutes I think.)

These are easy to make and taste great (and I don't even like peanuts).  It takes about 15 min to boil all of the water out of the mixture after the peanuts have been added.  Doubling the recipe makes it harder to prevent the sugar mixture from scorching so I would suggest making one batch at a time.

These are easy and great.  The first time I tried them, I thought I had done something wrong because it took so long for the sugar to thicken up around the peanuts.  It takes 6 - 7 minutes.  So be patient!  Then, my oven tends to run hot so I burned them but they still tasted pretty good.  The second time I made them, I baked them at 300 for 25 minutes and they came out perfect.

Before anyone jumps the gun about my rating, and decides not to make these, please try them anyway!  My rating has nothing to do with taste, as I have no clue what these tasted like.  I don't think the recipe was specific enough for me(I'm not very good with syrups and candy).  The syrup never thickened quite enough to hold on to he peanuts. Maybe boiling it for a specific amount of time first?  the recipe made it sound like everything happened right away, so I did that, and ended up throwing away the ingredients.

This is a great recipe. It originates from Africa where it is a restaurant and street food snack. It's called Sugar Peanuts. You may want to wait until the boiling liquid has come to the thin thread stage ~ 223-234ºF (106-112ºC) before adding the peanuts. They will have time to cook before reaching the hard crack stage when all of the water has evaporated. The temperature will drop and you will have to bring it back, but that happens pretty fast. HTH

I love sweet nuts and these are excellent.  It took about 5 min before the mixture came to a rolling boil after the peanuts were added and 8-10 min. after that until the syrup disappeared and all that was left were peanuts coated in a thick coating of sugar.  It was almost like magic!  I don't work with candy much, so I'm glad I read the reviews.  My husband said, "Add this recipe to your book."  They were that good.  Oh, the roasting went well.  Did it exactly like the recipe stated.  When these are right out of the oven, they seem soft, but when they cool they are quite crunchy--if you can wait that long to eat them!

My only advice is to keep stirring! I waited about 15 minutes and all of a sudden the liquid crystallized. I put the nuts on a cookie sheet and baked for about 15-20 minutes (didn't need the full 20 minutes). I tried this recipe both with salt and without. I think it is better without the salt! This recipe is great for parties, too. My friends loved them!

Soooo simple!  They would be great Christmas neighborhood gifts!  They seem like they would be a lot of work, but are simple. Be sure to keep at medium heat until all liquid is absorbed.  I put them on parchment paper and it helped with cleanup!

So much for everyone's advice to "Just Keep Stirrin'!"  I stirred and stirred and stirred, waiting for the liquid to crystalize.  Now my kitchen is full of smoke and I have a pan of peanuts covered in blackened goo.

I came across this recipe and looked at it its the same recipe my customer gave me a couple of weeks ago.  They are really good.  I doubled the recipe.  Just poured water and sugar over peanuts over medium heat and stirred and stirred didnt time myself.  Like my customer said just keep stirring until liquid is abosorbed.  Just be patient and if you keep stirring the liquid will absorb.  Throw them in the oven she told me 30 minutes which I did.  Very good!!!  Just keep stirring is the secret nothin to it!!!!!!

So easy!  So good!  As many others said, just wait!  It will thicken. If you're not sure if it's done, wait a bit longer.  It should be obvious. When you remove it from the heat, it'll crystallize almost instantaneously. I used a sprayed baking sheet and not a blessed thing stuck. If you cook it long enough, you will not have problems with this. The first time I roasted at 350 for only 10 min, as they were starting to scorch a bit.  The second time I did 300 for 20-25 min. and the results were perfect. The peanuts inside will be slightly soft when you remove them from the oven.  As they cool they will harden.

I have made these nuts for YEARS.  My recipe is a little different:  1 1/2 c sugar, 3/4 c water, 1 lb raw peanuts.  I make these at least twice every year.  Stir constantly till liquid is absorbed (18-30 mins).  Pour onto buttered jelly roll pan.  Sprinkle w salt & bake at 300 for 15 mins.  Stir.  Bake for another 15 mins.  Cool.  Store in airtight container.  Do not double recipe.  Found this in a recipe book by Holly Ebel bought in Solvang, CA in the 1980's.

GREAT RECIPE! I got creative with the recipe though. I added abunch of cinnamon, a little ground clove, a bunch of maple syrup, and a little salt to the recipe. Turned out great! However, next time I would make sure I put my peanuts into the sugar mixture immediately before it boils. Even after baking it for 30 minutes at 300, the peanuts don't seem roasted enough. Next time I will also try with brown sugar instead. YUM! Taste like the expensive nuts you buy at the mall during xmas!

I have set my timer to see how long it take to boil out the water.  It took me 9 minutes but I really started to see a change in the mixture after 7 minutes.  Lots of stirring.  I did not have enough raw peanuts so I used salted and they turned out amazing!  You must try these.  What a great snack!!!

These peanuts are exactly what my hubby and I have been searching for! They are called "Sweet and Crunchy" if you buy them from the store. They are so simple to make; I will never have to search the stores at Christmas time for them again!! Thanks for this recipe!!!

These do take awhile to cook but they are good.  You'll know it is time to take them off the stovetop when the sugar suddenly crystalizes and is no longer liquid.  I think I will add some salt next time because just the sugar makes them a bit plain.  Great base recipe though.  I think I might try them next time with pecans and add cinnamon!

I love these nuts!  Simple and very good.  The only issues I had is the sugar mixture seemed a lot for the peanuts so I added more and it was perfect.  And make sure you take them out of the pan as soon as they are out of the oven, mine stuck very badly to the pan when they cooled.

Wanting to make something different for a cookie/candy exchange, I decided to try sugared peanuts and cinnamon almonds.  This recipe was so easy to make and it only has 3 ingredients.  It took me 23 minutes of stirring the peanuts to cook out all of the syrup.  When I spread the peanuts on the cookie sheet to bake, it was lined with parchment paper.  Twenty minutes of baking time was perfect and the nuts were nicely coated and turned white as the coating cooled.  I’m sure this recipe will be made again, thanks Melissa for sharing your recipe.

Yumm-oooo!  Made these real fast for my kid's as a special after school snack.  It did take some time for the sugar to coat the nuts, I had about 13 minutes.   The only change I made was to use salted nuts because that's all I had on hand.  I am hoping it does not change the texture of the nut to much.  Will update if it does!

This was a good recipe.  I made these changes:  Brown sugar, one tablespoon salt.  I think I will use soy sauce instead of salt next time to make teriyaki peanuts!

Big hit with the hubby!! Fairly easy to make, great flavor. Found out by trial and error that the lowest rack in the oven worked best (coating tended to burn on the middle rack...could be just my oven). Would definitely make this one again!

These were easy and fun to make! My mother-in-law used to make these around the holidays but this was my first time. I added a scant tsp salt, as another reviewer suggested, and a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper (another A/R recipe suggested that), and the sweet-hot combination made them a little more unique. After liquid was gone from pan I spread them on a parchment-lined cookie sheet (still kinda liquidy at this point-maybe I took them off the stove too soon) and baked for 25 min. at 300. Delicious- highly recommend!

I have made these many times and started splitting the white sugar with dark brown sugar. I also add cinnamon, which everyone loves.

I tried one after 13 minutes and it was very good.  But by 18 minutes they were over-roasted: burned flavor, but edible.  And what were in the instructions for after they're done?  Leave them on the pan?  They stuck.  Put them on parchment paper?  Are they supposed to glob together?  I liked them, I just need to know what to do after roasting.

These are good. I had to stir for a long time about 30 min. on medium and the syrup didn't seem to get much thicker so I put it on high to get it going and that did the trick. I use a heavy non stick pan and stirred with my rubber spatula. Put in the oven at 300 so I wouldn't burn it for 30 minutes. Put a little cinnamon in the syrup and sprinkled some salt on them before baking. Very tasty. I was expecting a shiny peanut not crystallized but good none the less.

Great recipe! Be sure to use parchment paper to prevent the peanuts from sticking while roasting them in the oven. I made the mistake of using wax paper, then aluminum foil the first two times (doh!). Third time's the charm!

Super easy & really tasty! Reminds me of a candy from when I was a kid - Boston Baked Beans.    Clean-up was harder than the whole process of making these yummy nuts because my saucepan isn't non-stick, but this recipe will be made over and over again in this house!

I had the same problem as another reviewer... My liquid never became a thick syrup?!?  Maybe I too didn't boil long enough...?!?  I am sure this is a wonderful recipe and my review is more from my experience, not the taste. I ended up throwing it all away :(
