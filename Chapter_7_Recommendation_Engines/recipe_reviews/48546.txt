being korean-american myself, i'm very picky about my bul-ko-gi. there are tons of bul-ko-gi recipes out on the web (and i've tried many bad ones), and none have tasted as authentic as this! this recipe took me back to when my grandma would make it for me as a kid.  not to mention, my husband loved this recipe too. this is definitely a keeper!

Oh my god! These korean bbq short ribs are absolutely perfect!! I can't say enough about them--my family loved them and ate them up faster than anything else--they are already begging, BEGGING for more.  Easy to prepare and EXTREMELY tasty! I do have to say though that the rice wine is hard to find if you are not used to cooking Asian foods.  Rice vinegar is NOT the same as rice wine!! If you go to an Asian market though, there will be a whole shelf devoted to different kinds of rice wine--just get the regular clear one.  Also, I omitted the sesame seeds and they still came out perfect.  I also think I am going to marinade it a little bit longer than the 2-3 hours so I could let that perfect flavor soak in even more--to each their own.  THANK YOU for this recipe!!

I'm Korean-American and have had Bul-Go-Gi countless times.  This is the best recipe, trully authentic as others have stated. Recipes I've tried from Korean cookbooks did not turned out as well as this one did. This is definately a keeper.

I prepared this for a group of 70 that meets every month for lunch, but substituted pork tenderloin for the beef because of cost.  I served it to be portioned in a romaine lettuce leaf or flour tortilla, and with bean sprouts, julienned carrot and cucumber, chopped cabbage, and thinly-sliced sweet onion and fresh ginger, and fresh cilantro marinaded for 4 days in sesame oil, rice vinegar, and Serachi. I also made a side of fresh lime-cilantro mayonnaise that needed to be replenished half-way through the line. I also offered jasmine rice as an accompaniment.

Without exception people reported it was the best lunch they had every been served at their meetings.

Tanya, these were so delicious.  I made it last night and I can't stop thinking of it.  So tasty - I marinatred it for 1 full day.. and I did not use any ginger (i forgot to buy some).  The beef had such a complex taste - we wanted to savour every bite.  Thanks so much, my fiancee and I will make this again and again

Don't forget to hang on to the marinade! If you boil it to kill any lingering bacteria from the raw beef, you'll end up with a great sauce for some stir-fried or grilled veggies on the side.

This is my favorite marinade.  I have used it once a week since I discovered it last summer.  I often marinade short ribs or steak in it, and then cook them on my double grill pan (fits over two burners on my stove).  My whole family loves it!  Many thanks for posting it!

I enjoyed this recipe! I used another type of cut of meat... london broil to be exact. It worked just fine. This was my first time using pear. I am not sure but is it a tenderazer? I have used kiwi before but never pear and will have to continue to use pear from now on. I would rec using a little more that the norm on the following: garlic, s.seeds, s.oil, mirin and of course allowing more time for the meat to marinade on the actual sauce. It is delicious!!!

This was very tasty. I used Rice Vinegar instead of Rice Wine as I couldn't find it. Served in pita bread with fresh tomato & lettuce.

AWESOME recipe. We lived in South Korea for a year this is VERY reminiscent of a little place we liked to eat at. Very Good and the meat was so tender with a perfect crispy exterior. I marinaded overnight. Also stir fried some cabbage and carrots in the marinade with a little extra oil. Served with the stirfry and jasmine rice. BIG HIT!!!!
Thanks a million!!

This is a good dish.  A bit sweeter than I was expecting.  Next time I will half the sugar or omit it altogether.

Delicious recipe.  Very simple.  Only change I made was to reserved marinade (after steak was taken out).  The amount of marinade left after taking the steak out was very small.  So to the marinade being boiled I added:
2 T Hoisen sauce
1/2-3/4 C chicken stock
1 T corn starch
Mix well and boil for at least 10 minutes.  Then drizzle sauce over grilled meat and veggies.

Wow, this is our second Korean Dish we have made recently (Bi Bim Bop was our first) and we are in love. The flavors are incredible, and we only marinated for an hour and a half. Made with sticky white rice and sauteed Mushrooms and broccoli in the remaining marinade. Delicious.

Great recipe! 10x better than bulgogi I've had at various restaurants. I was too lazy to pick up a grill pan for this, but a regular pan worked fine (I just drained a bit of the liquid away before cooking). The ginger really stood out and was a bit strong for my taste, so I'll most likely cut the amount in half next time.

This was pretty darn good.  I will make it again.  The pear wasn't very strong.  Might add a whole pair next time.  Also might try it on the grill for variety.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is phenomenal! Im not usually one who likes to combine fruit and meat but in this particular instance, the combination of flavors was absoutely delicious.  All in all, it tasted like authentic Korean Bulgogi/Pul-Kogi from a restaurant. Thinly sliced meat like that is called for in the recipe can be difficult to find; I suggest going to your local supermarket butcher and buy fresh sirloin there and have them slice it thin for you, free of charge.  The thinness of the meat is very important in this recipe; too thick and its just not the same.  Also if you are using a pan, dont stir the meat around too much.  When you initially place the meat in the pan, let it sizzle for a bit and get a nice brown color and then flip the pieces over to sizzle on the reverse side.  Serve with rice and fresh Kimchee and voila...an absolutely delicious, incomparable dinner that will wow everyone!

Great!!  Don't overmarinate it or the meat gets salty.  2-3 hours is enough!  Also, don't forget to use the sugar, that is what helps it brown when you cook it.

My first attempt at Bulgogi & this was perfect. I didn't change a thing. Marinated for a few hours & then broiled on the oven broiler pan - wonderful. I prefer my Bulgogi extremely thin & that was probably the hardest/longest part of making the recipe, but it was worth it. Will be making this again & again!

This is the Korean BBQ recipe to end all Korean BBQ recipes. It is absolutely delicious. I used a small Asian pear,(I have a tree in my yard-I love that tree) grated, and followed all else exactly. I am never going back.

The best recipe I have come across. I made it and used it with noodles, cucumbers and bean sprouts to make vietnamese spring rolls with nuoc cham sauce. I'm sure it would go great with rice as well. Absolutely delicious!

I followed this recipe exactly, and loved the results.  I also reserved the left over marinade and reduced it to give people the option of putting an extra dose of flavor on the finished product.  I used Kikkoman Koterin Mirin, a sweet rice wine.

This is a terrific recipe, every bit as authentic and delicious as the dish I ate in Korea many years ago.  My husband & our guests raved about this.  We'll have this again!  We served with the Korean Cucumber Salad, which was the perfect side dish for this.

This is now my husbands and mine favorite thing to eat. It was soooooo good. The meat was so tender and we only marinated it for a few hours. We added hot pepper flakes and a little chili sauce (We like spicy foods).We grilled it on the bbq and it was crispy and tender and I can't wait until I make this again..... Thanks Kiatta

Yum. Tasted a lot like my roommate's Korean mother makes. Not quite the same, but very close and very good.

Wow, great flavor! I didnt have a grill pan, so I made it in the skillet and it was wonderful - but real pulgogi is kind of crisp and I think you definitely need the grill pan. I will make this  again!

I lived in Korea for a year and since returning to the United States my Hubby and I have been looking for authentic tasting Korean food. I found his favorite in this recipe. I used a fuji apple instead of a pear (didn't have one) and fo a brief moment we were both back in Tongduchon, South Korea. Thanks so much.

This was delicious!  We paired it with two other recipes from this site, Korean Cucumber Salad and Korean squash, as well as some jasmine rice.  We heat up the marinade and put it over the meat and rice.  There was a lot of slicing and chopping involved, but, it was a lot of fun to prepare with my husband...Rachel

I couldn't believe how fabulous this was!  I'm not much of a cook, and it turned out great, much to the happy surprise of my fiancée and myself.  Note that I did substitute rice wine vinegar for rice wine, because I realized too late that we had no rice wine.

I followed the recipe only changing the rice wine to rice vinegar due to not having any. I made a double batch to freeze ahead.When I pulled 1 out I let it marinate a day in a half. It was so good  my picky eater took the rest to school for lunch without a crumb to spare. This dish is sweet and spicy. Just right. Not hot,  but very flavorful.

Excellent and yet very simple and versitile! I use rice wine vinegar as well and omit the sesame seeds because I never buy them and have them in the house. I also omit the green onions sometimes when I am out of them and this recipe still comes out wonderful! My family love the sauce. You will not be disappointed with this recipe!

This is one of the better Korean BBQ marinades I've come across. The only thing I added was  some sriracha sauce (about 1/2 tbsp) as I like a little heat.   As I like my beef a little pink in the middle, I marinated a whole flat iron steak (1.5 lbs), broiled it (5 to 6 minutes a side), and then thinly sliced it. I have also done this in the past with a flank steak. (The marinade may not penetrate the center of the steak if you do it this way.)   To save some time on prep, I put all the marinade ingredients, except the sesame seeds, into my mini food processor and made a puree. I added the pureed mixture to a ziploc bag with beef and sesame seeds.

Great recipe.  I eliminated the pear, rice wine, and ginger - only because I don't enjoy these components.  The rest really took me back to the pulkogi of my youth growing up in Hawaii.  Every week our family would eat Korean BBQ.  Just get a good helping of sticky rice and kimchee to garnish and I am 12 again!  Wonderful!!  Also of note, I mix the marinade, put it in a gallon ziplok freezer bag and throw in my cut meat, push out the air and let it marinate overnight.  You would NOT believe the effect!!

This was really good, even though I made it wrong.  I emptied the beef along with the marinade into a skillet, so it didn't have the charred effect. Next time, I'll empty the beef onto our grilling basket, which will strain the excess marinade, and then grill the meat in the basket.  Outstanding flavor!  Will make again!

Unfortunately the grocery store I went to didn't have sirloin so I ended up getting flank steaks or something like that. The meat didn't cook quite like I would have liked, but the marinade is AMAZING! I put extra ginger in. I used vegetable oil and rice vinegar instead because I didn't have the other ingredients and it tasted just fine. I have purchased beef top sirloin this time and am going to re-try the recipe with the right meat.

This was tasty but I really prefer Bulgogi over Pul-gogi. I used beef tenderloin and didn't marinate the beef. The flavors still soaked in because the tenderloin was melt in your mouth good. Served with "Quick Sesame Green Beans," "Korean-style Seaweed Soup," "Chinese Cabbage Salad I," and leftover "Sesame Noodles."

So awesome! And so easy! I hate to cook, I'm really bad at it, and am extremely picky, but I love this recipe! So do my picky kids! I've been using an apple, because pears are expensive and hard to come by where I live, and I leave out the ginger, as none of us are fans, but my meat still comes out tender and delicious!

This recipe is delicious and very, very easy to make. My fiance loved this. It is his new favorite homemade meal (with Japanese rice or Thai sticky rice). I used an Asian pear. My fiance hates onion so I left the onion out of the recipe but it tasted great.  Do not marinate longer than 2-4 hours because the meat will become tough if marinated for a long time (like overnight). I made too much and the leftover meat that we cooked the next day was not as tender as the meat we had cooked the night before.  If you use a grilling quality steak for the beef, then don't cook the meat well--cook it only to rare or medium rare for maximum flavor and tenderness.   This recipe deserves 5 stars because it is so easy to make and is so good. We have eaten this many times in restaurants and this version is much better than any restaurant version either of us has ever eaten. I think this will be one of your favorite recipes.

This was really good and simple to do.I added onions cut up in wedges, 1 grated carrot and the green onions to make it a complete meal.Didn't have rice wine so used white wine instead. Marinated only 1.5 hours and was still very tasty.Served with white rice and Miso soup.Will surely make it again and again.

Really, really, really good.  I threw everything in a ziploc and marinated overnight.  Cooked the strips on a stove top grill.  Served with white rice and "traditional pot stickers" from this site.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

Very authentic in taste! I blend the ingredients so it won't be chunky. This way when I BBQ it the garlic and green onions won't burn before the meat is done.

This is an absolutely AMAZING and DELICIOUS dish. The flavors in this are tantalizing and I was worried about too much garlic but it was just perfect. I let mine marinade all day and this was so good, it got gobbled up quickly.  Well worth getting your rice wine for this recipe.  Thanks so much for posting this one.

I love this recipe! It makes me feel like a pro making this. The results are so impressive. The first time I made these I didn't have rice wine or sesame seeds and I decided I was ok with that. I used white wine instead, but after my first attempt I bought rice wine to get a more authentic asian flavour (and was surprised coz rice wine wasn't so expensive). Also as the pears I use are quite small I use the whole thing. Tips: 1. beef thinly sliced cooks quite fast, esp in soy sauce, so I cook the beef then leave the onions in the pan with the sauce to let them caramelize, then i return the beef to the pan and heat a minute before serving. 2. These are also great for bachelors and bachelorettes who live alone - i cooked a few slices from the bag one night and cooked a few more the next. 3. I like to use more sesame oil.

Everyone loved this! Such a good flavor; similar to teriyaki. I pan fried it and couldn't get the crispy exterior some of the reviewers said it should authenically have. I think I'll try to cook it a different way next time. Any suggestions?

entire picky family loved it.  tip:  freeze the beef for about 1/2 an hour before slicing it.  it makes it much easier to work with.  i followed the recipe exactly (marinated 3 hours) and it was absolutely perfect.  couldn't be easier.  thanks for a really great recipe.

All my 4 children liked this dish, so this will be a regular rotation in this household. Easy to prepare, and so tasty. I bought the thinly sliced beef usually used to make sukiyaki dishes so the beef were really tender. Since I wanted to sneak in vegetables, I doubled the marinade and boiled the vegetables with it and poured it over the beef as gravy. Thank you for posting.

Quite Tasty! Hubby loved it.  I added 1 tsp chili paste to the marinade for some kick.  Sliced the meat very thinly and then cooked quickly on high heat.  I've never used pear in a marinade before, it was lovely!

Mmm, so simple and so good! I added some carrots cut into matchsticks and a bit of hot sauce, and cooked the beef and its marinade in a super hot wok and served it over rice.

This was delicious! I didn't have rice wine so I used seasoned rice vinegar and it came out fine.  I marinated it for about 3 1/2 hours, grilled it (so I didn't cut it really thin), and it was hard for everyone to stop eating it.  I have two sons - 9 and 12 - and they both said it was the best "steak" they had ever had!

Great recipe! Even after marinating it for only 4 hours, it still got great reviews. I will try to marinate it overnight next time. No grill pan, so I cooked it in a skillet, and served it with white rice, as suggested. I've never cooked with pear before, and was very impressed with the results. Thanks for the recipe!

I used thinly sliced london broil (about 3/4 lb) and added some red pepper flakes.  I let the meat marinate for 8 hours before broiling it.  It was delicious--tender and flavorful.

Very good recipe.  I added some chili flake to perk it up a bit, and also, when cooking the beef, threw in vegetables.  It's the most authentic-tasting recipe I've found.

I've had this dish at restaurants a couple of times, and while I enjoyed the flavor, the cuts of meat were rather tough and stringy. The sirloin I used was almost melt-in-the-mouth, but I didn't like the flavor quite as much. It was very good, but not quite what I remembered. Anyway, we enjoyed this, and I would make it again. Thanks, Tanya!

This was delicious!  I used rib-eye since that's what I had on hand, and I didn't have ginger.  This dish came out wonderful.  I marinated it overnight and cooked it in a skillet on high heat.  It went very nicely with white rice and korean cucumber salad also from this site.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

Delish!  I made this for a lunceon at work and cooked it in a wok.  Everyone thought it was yummy.  Made it with the Korean squash recipe from this site and served it over brown rice.  Quite good.

Outstanding!I marinated the steak all day and did it on the grill..the sauce sort of caramelized and it was oh so good! Served it with rice and one of those napa cabbage/ramen noodle Asian type slaws and we all thought we had died and gone to food heaven. Thanks a million!! Rice vinegar worked just fine.

This is a great marinade.The meat was really tender and flavorful but not overpowering.  I marinated a 1.7 lb steak overnight in 2 pieces (doulbed the marinade which seemed like too much), grilled it in the 2 pieces and and served with steamed rice.  I'll use this marinade again. =)

Until today I would have thought the only way I could ever make pulkogi this good would be if I were reincarnated as an Ajuma. Didn't have pears but applesauce worked just fine. Marinated an extra hour or two. Two pounds of beef fed 8 of us with hearty appetites--and some leftovers! That's what I love about Korean food: the amazing meat is just the beginning--then there's the kimchi and the seaweed and the lettuce and the steamy rice and the gochu jang. Wow, feeling satisfied and already looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Thanks for sharing this recipe Tanya!

We normally make bulgogi on the grill. I was surprised by how good this was, even though I totally do miss the charred crispiness that the grill adds. This is by no means a second-rate cousin to grilled bulgogi, though, it's more like the difference between grilled burgers and pan-fried: can't really fairly compare one to the other as both are so good. I did not like the pear being so small, it got all squishy. In the future I would either use pear juice/nectar or large chunks of pears so that I could eat them separately from the meat as the texture just didn't please me. *It is possible that my pear was too ripe, too.* Thanks for sharing!

Good flavor, considering only marinated 2 hours. Was more soft than "crispy". Will try on BBQ next time.

I've been to a lot of Korean places for BBQ and this is the closest I have gotten. Loved it. Very sweet but full of flavor. Cooked it on a counter top grill and it was perfect. They come out great. Definitely try it!

I have never been to a Korean restaurant, but if this is what the food is like, I'm going the first chance I get!  This was delicious!!  I made exactly as listed.  It was wonderful and I ate it 3 days straight until it was gone!  The hubby hates white rice and I hate brown rice so I made it with Beef Rice A Roni.  It was a big hit.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks Tanya!!

Followed directions-only variation was to add 1 small habanero peppers thinly sliced because we like a little heat without meat!

I got turned onto Korean BBQ in Berkeley of all places and came across this one day and tried it out.  It was absolutely delicious.  I modified it a little though.  I used shredded angus beef which made the meat so delicious.  As not a big fan of ginger (I know, weird) I nixed that and the second time I used an entire pear (a "cooking pear") because I loved the sweetness the first time.  I let it sit in a freezer bag as long as I can handle as I think this is the key to a great result.  I used "sushi" soy sauce which I don't know how different it is and I chose to use brown rice instead of white.  I didn't have any rice wine vinegar so I just didn't use any and it was still FANTASTIC.  I also used organic granulated white sugar (all I had) but unsure how that changed the flavor.

Personally I think that thai sauce (sriracha) (that red pasty stuff with the green lid and all the asian writing on it) is *mandatory*.  It has vinegar in it. To me that brings this dish home :)

From my experience with bulgogi recipes a 2:1 soy sugar ratio provides a salty result. I used 3T instead of 4 and 1T honey, 1T sugar and and grated apple instead of pear, and it turned out great. If you don't have rice wine, just leave it out rather than using rice wine vinegar - it is not the same thing.

Very tasty marinade.  I used boneless chuck steak, marinated overnight, broiled and then cut into slices.  Everyone liked it.

This was really good and my boyfriend loved it.  I doubled the sauce as suggested but I found it to be a bit salty even though I used low sodium soy sauce.  I will make this again but need to figure out a way to reduce the salt.

tasted very good but meat wasn't as tender as i expected. next time i will slice it really thin, i had it about 1/4" thickness this time. nice flavor but not "to die for". i used apple cider vinegar cause i couldn't fine rice wine...maybe that changed it?

Five star recipe!  Primarily because of taste, but also because preparation can be done ahead, general presentation can be beautiful, and ingredients are those I have on hand!  Very very tasty dish -- and a dish I can use for overnight guests, since I can prep all items ahead of time, be out all day, and come home have it ready in about five minutes.  Thanks, Tanya!

This was so tasty! I used a London Broil instead of the cut called for, and it still turned out tender! I also used a stove top grill pan, so I was able to save the pear bits and serve them with the beef, too. Extremely good, will definitely make again.

It was ok, not quite what I thought it'd be. Flavors didn't seem rich enough, perhaps it needed to marinate longer.

I used to live in Korea and have been craving the food recently.  This is my first time making this dish and it came out awesome. I had to substitute the rice wine for just a white wine, used honey instead of sugar, and an apple instead of a pear.  I just didnt have these things around, but it came out awesome anyway!!

This was very very good!  My husband and I both loved it.  I followed the recipe, except I didn't have any rice wine, so I used rice wine vinegar, and I added a tablespoon of sesame chili oil for a little bit of heat.  It was awesome and I will be making this again and again!

I love this recipe. My only mistake was salting the beef before putting it in the marinade. I used low sodium soy sauce and didn't realize its sodium would be enough. Besides for being a little salty it was great! Next time, I won't add more salt.

This marinade is delicious, although I didn't feel like it was traditional Korean BBQ.  It tasted more like a basic asian marinade than something spicy which I associate with Korean BBQ.

I really did not like this recipe. The "Sesame Beef" recipe on here is 10 times better. It may have been partially the meat it called for, as well as a few ingredients. As far as I remember I dumped the left overs...not a family favorite and just didnt do it for us...

This recipe is a keeper!  It is simple and delicious and my young children love it.  I have made it multiple times with different cuts of steak and it has been tasty every time.  I omit the pear and substitute 1/2 tsp of rice wine vinegar for the rice wine.

This was delicious! The meat was very flavorful and I only marinated it for 2 hours.  Next time I will try the others' suggestion of thinly slicinig the meat while frozen.  I cooked the meat in  a hot wok since we didn't have a grill pan and it still came out great.  Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make this again!

This was an incredible recipe.  I stir fried some veggies to go with it and served it over rice.  

Was a bit salty, I'd recommend low sodium soy sauce.

This is a very good recipe.  I think the only suggestion I would make, is to make sure to use very very thin meat, and marinate it for at least 24 hours if possible.  I really enjoyed making and eating this.

Family loved this.  I never have rice wine available so I used white, a tablespoon isn't much anyway and I didn't have any fresh ginger so I used ground dried ginger.  Served with steamed white rice.  Great!

Wow, the flavor of this recipe is fantastic!  I did not have seseme seeds so I left those out and I used rice vinegar instead of rice wine.  I served this recipe with jasmine rice and my family loved it!  Great recipe, thanks!

This recipe was a hit!  Even the child who doesn't like meat asked for seconds. We only had time to marinate the meat for 2 hours and that was fine. We cooked it using the bbq, which worked great. It was delicious, we'll be making it again soon. Thanks for the recipe.

Thanks for a great recipe!  Hubby was VERY pleased with this dish.  Followed recipe almost as it's written.  I halved the soy sauce since many reviewers found it too salty.  Didn't leave much liquid to marinate the meat but it surprised me.  I did marinate it for about four hours in the fridge and the flavor was delicious.  Thanks!

This was excellent and so easy.  I used brown sugar instead of white.  I think this would be great as a marinade for beef skewers, using the chunks of pear on the skewer.  I left the pear chunks a little bigger and I loved that bit of sweetness with the bit of salt in the soy.  Really nice recipe.

Pretty good. Made with some of those Knorr Asian Noodles. But not as good as the real think my Korean friend made.

This recipe was absolutley delicious....a great combination of flavors.  I am going to try the marinade again with beef shortribs, as another reviewer suggested.  I did leave the steak in the marinade overnight, which was the only change made to the recipe. A definite 5 star recipe!
