I only gave it a 4 star because there was nothing about it to give it flavor. I added 2 onions, a clove of garlic and salt free CAVENDEK'S seasoning. It did not need any salt. That made it a 5 star. I will be fixing it again my way.

I made this and since I always read the reviews to see what other variations there are, I added minced onion and garlic to season for taste. Instead of using regular Cream of Mushroom soup, I used Campbells Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic. It came out so delicious!  I seasoned the pork chops before I lay them on top of the rice.

This was amazing! I doubled the recipe and put in a 13 x 9 pan for a family of 6 and used Sharp Cheddar instead of American cheese. sooooo good, the pickiest kid alive ate it!

I added 1 chopped leak, 3 cloves chopped garlic, a couple of handfuls of fresh spinach, and used mushroom soup. Seasoned with sea salt and pepper and cooked at 350 for ONE HOUR. Sprinkled some paprika on top to serve. It was delicious!

I followed the basic recipe but used Uncle Ben's Wild Rice with the seasoning packet, which was perfect!  I also browned the pork chops first for added flavor  Will definitely add it to my Favorites list!

It lacked depth of flavor. I even added grated onions and bell pepper and it still wasn't that flavorful. I did make it with smoked pork chops because it's what I had. I'm not sure if that affected the flavor at all.

This was just ok for me. The rice had a great flavor and was a hit with the family. The pork chops were bland. I will try this recipe again adding additional seasoning to it.

Very simple, but very good everyday recipe!  Also, very economical with pork so reasonable.

I loved this! since the first time I've made a few variations! My first was a chicken cheesy rice, I used cream of celery, chicken broth, canned chicken, and mozzarella cheese. so good!
My husband's favorite was when I used cream of mushroom, beef broth, 1/2 lb hamburger meat with sauteed onions, and triple cheddar cheese. 
I like the idea of mixing up a dish with rice, and throwing it into the oven. One of my go to receipes now. I just switch up the soup, broth, meat and cheese. I keep the water and rice the same of course. It's just so versital.

Very easy.  You put everything together and put it in the oven.  You do need to add your own spices or it could be bland.  I will make it again.

This is amazing! So simple and feeds everybody! I have to make it every other week now. Everyone loves it. I didn't make any changes, other than I used sharp cheddar.
