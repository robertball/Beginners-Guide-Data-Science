Used 2c of reg. vanilla yogurt and added a pinch of brown sugar. Omitted the orange zest and ginger b/c I didn't have any (they were garnishes anyways - no big worries). GREAT FRUIT DIP!! Go great with ANY fruit.  My mom served this at my brother's graduation party this past weekend = huge hit. Will make this often!! Thanks Dannon!

Very unique but tasty fruit dip! Particularly great with apples. Per the former, I added a pinch of brown sugar too but followed the rest of the recipe. Even my boyfriend liked it - and he's not a huge fruit and dip fan.  With this recipe, I think I'm beginning to convert him!

I've made this several times now: as written, the dip is a bit syrupy; with a slight concentrate reduction, it's much better. It's still very good, though, so definitely give it a try! Now whenever I have a bowl of vanilla yogurt (with or without fruit to dip in it), I always stir in a tbsp or so of orange juice concentrate. A good, healthy idea!

This was O.K. I think the problem is that I only had orange juice and not the concentrate so it thinned the yogurt too much. I would have also liked it to be a bit sweeter. Maybe using just orange yogurt to begin with. The ginger really didn't do much of anything. Won't be trying again.
