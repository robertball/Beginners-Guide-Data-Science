This has so much lime juice that it completely dominates every ingredient in the salad.  I had no watercress, so I used baby arugula and romaine, but the lime overpowered the peppery arugula and even the fish sauce was negligible.  Also, there’s nothing to temper the tartness of the lime juice, and oh man, did it make me pucker!  This recipe calls for 3 whole limes for 4 servings (that's a lot of tart lime juice).   If I were to make this again, I’d start out with no more than half the lime juice (maybe even less) and add just a little bit of honey to counterbalance the tartness.  I like all of the ingredients in this salad (I did add freshly-ground black pepper), and I do think you can make it work, but IMO it needs some tweaking.  Sorry, Josie, this just didn't work for me today, but I'll probably try again.
