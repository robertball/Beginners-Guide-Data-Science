This was delicious! I made this in my slow cooker and served it with some Boston Brown Bread!

I made this with homemade apple butter and it was delicious. I'm not a fan of cayenne pepper but in this recipe it gave the beans a very nice kick. I plan on making this again.

Adjusted this to make four servings.  I used all pinto beans and homemade apple butter and left out the cayenne pepper.  This was a different way to make baked beans and we enjoyed.  Served these with apple butter pork chops. Thanks for a new side dish to try.
