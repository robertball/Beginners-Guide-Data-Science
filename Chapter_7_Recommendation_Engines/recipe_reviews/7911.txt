Ok, if you use muffin tin liners like I do your entire muffin (duh) will not be coated in the topping. I didn't even think of it beforehand. I was in a hurry and just made them. The plain muffin inside was lacking something. I think a little cinnamon there like another reviewer suggested would have done it, even without the entire thing being rolled in the topping. As far as the milk, I started out with 3/4 cup but added more during the mixing to get a consistency I could work with putting in the muffin cups. I would say it was at least a cup. I just kept adding and stirred it in until I could work with it and even then was thinking it could use a tad more. My batter was not lumpy after all of this, but they baked up gorgeous in about 15 minutes as another had said. Mine were light and fluffy with nice peaks on them. Everyone still gobbled them up, but I am giving it 4 stars since the basic muffin still needs something.

This recipe was awesome! The only thing I would change would be to use butter instead of oil, it makes for a more tasteful muffin. Otherwise I highly recommend it.

this recipes is similar to one for "breakfast muffins" that my mom has. her's has cinnamon and nutmeg added to the batter, so i added 1 tsp each of those two ingredients. also added 1 tsp of vanilla. i filled regular muffin cups 2/3rds full and only came up with 10 muffins, but they baked up nice and tall. very moist inside, and slightly crisp on top. the cinnamon/sugar on top is what makes them so perfectly sweet and delicious.

I was a bit concerned when making these muffins. The batter was thick and sticky; unlike most muffin batters. But it came out well. It's a heartier muffin than most. 
  

VARIATION: add 2tsp of ground cinnamon to the dry mix.

I used melted butter instead of oil in the actual muffin recipe. That was the only change I made. I made mini muffins and didn't bother with liners, I just spritzed the muffin tins with baking spray. Once they were done, I was able to dip the mini muffins in butter and roll them in cinnamon sugar. I did need a little more melted butter and cinnamon-sugar mix than what was called for. I did also get more than the recipe stated--I was able to get 48 mini muffins out of one recipe. My family loved these. Next time, I might add a little vanilla to the muffin recipe.

Very good.  I did however add some cinnimon, brown sugar, and vanilla to the dry mix.  I also used a mixture of butter and corn syrup instead of just straight butter to dip the muffins in before rolling them in the cinnimon sugar mixture.

Yummy! I added a bit more milk (an extra 1/4 cup) so it was easier to put in the muffin cups. The muffins turned out quite nicely.
I made a mistake the first time I made these and melted the margarine for the topping and instead of reading the intructions right through I just dumped in the sugar and cinnamon and stirred them up with the margarine. I didn't want to throw out the mixture so I just spooned it onto the tops of the muffins before  I baked them. The topping baked nicely and spread out perfectly on the tops of the muffins.

My name is Kya and I am 6 years old. I said that I wanted to bake something but my mom wasn't sure about it but my dad let me. It was fun but I was a little scared about the oven part. The muffins are a little like biscuits but with cinnimon. They are real good!I had fun making them too (Kya's mom)

These muffins were ok.  Texture was WAY too thick for me.  Seemed to improve the next day.  I like a muffin that is light and airy.   However I absolutely LOVED the cinnamon sugar glaze on top. I probably won't make this recipe again, but will try the sugar glaze with other muffin recipes.

My husband made these for breakfast...kids loved them!  Personally, I thought the tops were really good but the muffins themselves weren't very sweet at all...we'll make them again, but next time we'll add something sweet to the batter to make them taste better!  they were good though!

I've never made homemade muffins before, I've always used the box mixes. So, I was nervous... but these were very easy and very good! And only took a teeny bit longer then mixing an egg into a powder mix. And tasted alot better! I will make this again!

These muffins are awesome! They're nothing really special, but they're great for quick breakfasts. I suggest adding two tablespoons of margarine for a little more flavor.

I felt that it needed a little more milk while your mixing all.the ingredients at the end. About 3/4 of a cup more.
But other than that, it was wonderful!

My sister and I recently moved into a new apartment a few weeks ago, and hadn't had the chance to bake something sweet. I came across this recipe in the recipe box. I had all of the ingredients available, so making the muffins didn't take long to prepare. I added vanilla extract to give the muffins some much needed sweetness. Although the batter was lumpy, the muffins were absolutely delicious. Instead of adding vegetable oil to the batter, I'd like to add some melted butter next time. I will continue to add the vanilla extract though. :-)

This is a good, easy, basic muffin. I use muffin tin liners; added the teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and instead of the butter/cin/sugar topping, before baking I sprinkle the tops with cinnamon/sugar mixture.

i even added extra sugar, cinnamon and vanilla to the batter and they were still a little bland. i baked them a little less than stated (according to other viewers) and they were still a little dry as well.

I followed the other reviews suggestions and added more milk then the recipe called for and it made a big difference. They tasted good but need more flavor in the actual muffin.

a great basic basic muffin recipe with good proportions. and just like everyone else said, a touch of cinnamon and vanilla in the batter would be best. oh, do not overbake! mine were done in about 18 minutes and i have an accurate temperature oven. i also used confectioners sugar for the glaze and liked the taste of that.

I made these as directed but I did add 2tsps of cinnamon to the dry mixture and a Tbs of corn syrup to the melted butter. the batter did not turn out lumpy, like some said. not too sweet on the inside but still good.  these were very tasty and my picky 4 yr old loved them.

Excellent recipe.  I halved it and made 6 rather than 12 and it worked well. Also did a version (recipe halved) with 3 tsp cocoa powder and made chocolate muffins - obviously leaving off the sugar & cinnamon topping!

I have these in the oven right now and so far they smell delicious.  I used extra milk and cinnamon in the batter.  I also used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the egg which makes batter more moist and a little healthier.  I also just sprinkled the batter with the cinnamon sugar before putting them in the oven.

Great recipe!  Tastes like Mom's cinnamon toast!  Only change I made was adding a teaspoon of ground cinnamon to batter after reading reviews.  Several mentioned that muffin was bland.  Glad I added the cinnamon.  Nothing bland about it!  Will definitely make again!  Loved the fact that I had everything on hand and didn't have to shop for additional ingredients.

This is a good recipe to add fruit to such as bananas, blueberrys, or even chocolate chips.  It does need some fruit or the chocolate added to it.  The basic recipe alone is a little bland.  Definitely add the vanilla to the mixture.  This is a great recipe to experiment with!!

I made these one morning on a whim, and they were delicious. Like many others have said, I added cinnamon and vanilla and these were still delicious. They have a light buttery taste to them, which isn't too overbearing. Yummy!

We used to make these in jr. high cooking class, under the name "French Breakfast Puffs".  Make these in small-sized muffin tins, and DIP the tops into melted butter (easier than brushing), then into sugar-cinnamon mixture. YUM!

Very basic muffin, but VERY easy to make. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract to the batter to sweeten.  These are great to make if you are in a hurry. They are quick and easy.

I love this recipe. I just wanted to make something simple to eat for breakfast tomorrow, and this was exactly what I was looking for! I read other reviews and decided to add 2tbsp cinnamon to the dry mix. It was just perfect. I added a little extra milk too, and the batter was not lumpy. But they turned out gorgeous! I highly recommend.

These were okay but seemed to be lacking something.  I would suggest throwing in some dried fruit or chocolate chips for interest.

This is a really good recipe. Quick and easy. My husband really loves these muffins. They are good for breakfast and I like how they are light and not really heavy. 

I make this recipe a lot. I dont add the extra 1/4 cup but if the batter looks really thick then i add just a bit more milk.

I had fresh cherries on hand, so I added them into this recipe.  I really enjoyed the cinnamon and sugar on top of the muffins.  I also like the fact that this recipe is not full of sugar.

these actually turned out better than i thought! i used 1 cup (a slight bit more actually) milk like some1 else suggested 2 tame some of the stickyness. but i would suggest that u add SOMETHING 2 the batter: choco/butterscotch/vanilla/peanutbutter chips, 1 of those would, im sure, do great. im not a fan of how empty the muffin feels whenever i take a bite w/out the cinnamon part. (o gosh thats 1 yummy topping). i would also suggest that not only use only 1 tbls. butter 2 put onto the muffintops, but also add 1 extra tsp. cinnamon 2 the mix: the cinnamon aint as strong as id like it 2 be, & i dont like having a tbls. of butter left sitting in the dish when im done. i also like how less crunchy the bottoms are on these(not entirely soft like cupcakes... i guess theyre not supposed 2 be)compared 2 the choco. chip muffins i made the other day. i will def. make these again.
p.s. i would suggest they change the name 2 sugar/cinnamon-coated muffins. sounds more precise.

This was a simple and quick muffin to make.  The recipe time called for it to cook for 20-25 minutes at 400, but mine cooked in 15.  My kids loved these muffins!  I thought they were average.  Not great but certainly not bad either.

not too bad, just a bit less airy than muffins usually are, still made a good breakfast.
