I have made this quite a bit- it is my favorite- however I have found using Libby's pumpkin pie mix and eliminating the sugar and spices is much easier!  Here is my version:
1 - 29 oz. can Libby's Pumpkin Pie Mix
4 -beaten eggs
1 - 13 oz. can evaporated milk
1 box of dry yellow cake mix
1 cup melted margarine
1 cup chopped nuts 
This is truly a 5 star recipe!!

I tried this over the holidays and it was simply awesome! After reading the reviews, I decided to take some advice and use Libby's pumpkin pie mix instead of the pumpkin, sugar and spices. I also used a butter pecan flavored cake mix. My version: 1 - 29 oz. can Libby's Pumpkin Pie Mix, 4 -beaten eggs, 1 - 13 oz. can evaporated milk, 1 box of dry butter pecan cake mix, 1 cup melted butter, 1 cup chopped nuts. Not at all healthy, but truly a 5 star recipe for taste!!

I love pumpkin pie, and this is a great twist. The only thing I did different from the recipe was to mix the cake mix and butter together before topping on the pumpkin mixture. I loved the results!

This cake is wonderful--delicious and easy to make.  I found that it tasted better, when I used two 9oz. Jiffy yellow cake mixes (without pudding in the mix) for the topping. I've made this about 5 times, and everyone loves it.

Thanks to the person that posted this recipe.  I might have kept it a secret if it were mine. ;o)  I made this two nights in a row...once for a Thanksgiving party at work and once for Thanksgiving dinner the following day.  If you think baking a cake one night and then starting again and baking it the next night sounds like a lot of work you're mistaken.  This cake takes 10 minutes tops to throw together--very easy!  

I can't even begin to tell you how much people at both events raved about this cake!  There wasn't a single leftover piece either day.  Sooooo delicious!  I will make it every year.

This recipe is four stars to me the way it's written, but I found a better way after making this a million times. It always bugged me to use so much margarine or butter on top, just to moisten the cake mix. But if i tried cutting back the amount of margarine, it turned out dry and yucky on top. So next i tried half a cup of margarine melted and 1/4 cup of water and that made it soggy and yucky too. So I tried softening only one stick of margarine in the microwave and then mixing it in the cake mix with a fork in a large bowl, like a streusel topping until it looked like coarse crumbs. Then sprinkle it with your fingers on top. It turned out looking much better and crumbly looking and nicely browned but saved half a stick of butter or margarine. It also improved the presentation appearance of the dish!

Wonderful. Used 4 eggs for a firmer texture.  Spread dry spice cake mix and dropped pats of butter (about 1 1/2 cups -- we love butter) across the top. The butter melted and made a crispy topping. I skipped dinner and went straight to dessert!

When I took this cake from the oven rich aroma of the season lured my downstairs neighbor up to my door wanting to know what I had baked.  She ran downstairs to put on a fresh pot of coffee and we had two pieces of this fabulous "pie cake" while it was still warm from the oven! Yummers!!! One thing I did do was before I baked it I toasted the walnuts then I sprinkled them over the cake.  I have shared this recipe with four people so far.

I love this recipe. I had a an alternate version that states to flip the cake upside down after it cools and top the cake with a frosting made of 1 pkg. cream cheese, 1/2 c, powdered suger, and 1 cup (or more) of cool whip. Upside down the cake can be served as dessert bars, I sprinkle the frosting with a few more chopped walnuts to finish it off.

Okay... I don't know what the heck happened with this recipe but it did not work for me!  Sprinkling the yellow cake mix and covering with butter DID NOT do anything to make the DRY CAKE MIX anything but cooked DRY CAKE MIX.

I have made this 3 times and each time it was wonderful even using low fat ingredients.  Try using different cake mixes as spice and caramel work really well with pumpkin.  I will try carrot cake next time.  You can even use 1/2 the cake mix and use the rest for muffins.  You have to make sure the cake mix all gets wet.  I am taking this along with traditional pumpkin pie for TG.  Great recipe!

Very nice!  Just a tad bit on the sweet side, so next time I'll reduce the amount of sugar I add and cut back on the cake mix topping.  The pumpkin mix on the bottom was very pie-like; and the topping had a nice crunch to it.  We will do this one again---only less sweet.

This is absolutely delicious. My family prefers this over regular pumpkin pie. I always use spice cake mix instead of yellow cake mix and serve with lots of whipped cream.

i don't really ever like pumpkin pie, but this was pretty darn good!  My roommates thought that it was terrific though- especially warm with ice cream.  I didn't put the nuts on top, but there were macadamia nuts in the ice cream that I used- very tasty!

I made this with my six year old son.  It was easy and not very messy.  This was a big hit at our thanksgiving dinner.  I had to write down the recipe many times.  The only problem I ran into was that the baking time was a little off.  I think it needs a little more than 1 hour.  Fabulous recipe!!

Thank goodness for recipes like this so I can make a quick dessert for a gathering with items I already have in my pantry. I found it's easily bendable to what you have on hand. I cut back the pumpkin pie spice to a heaping teaspoon and a half, as I didn't want the flavor to be too strong. I also added an additional egg as the other reviewers did. I cut back the sugar to a half cup as I didn't want it to be sickeningly sweet. I did not have yellow cake mix but I did have butter cake mix so I used that instead. This is going to be dessert for family dinner tonight so I'll update my review once everyone's had a chance to dig in. EDITED: Even though I cut back the sugar, I thought it was really quite sweet. Everyone else loved it, though.

Not so good!  The pumpkin filling was great, but the topping was too sweet.  I would have liked to have some type of bottom crust, but the topping was not at all what I was looking for.  If I knew it was going to turn out like that I would have just made a pie.  No one in my family liked it and I ended up throwing the entire cake (with the exception of 2 pieces) away.  I was very disapointed.

Delicious!  I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and mixed in 1/2 cup flour into cake mix before pouring it over the top of pumpkin filling.  Rave reviews from the ladies in our book club!

Since I refuse to make pumpkin pie (family joke) I found this recipe and everyone absolutely loves it.  Of course while enjoying it family has to bring up the pumpkin pie disaster of 1964.  It was so bad not only the family wouldn't eat it, the dog barked at it.  Everyone loves this though.

This has long been a favorite of our family and friends. One change that I learned from my Gram years ago is to use Butter Pecan cake mix instead of the yellow - that really makes it taste like a brown sugar type crisp topping.  Yummy with fresh whipped cream on top!!!

Amazing! I didn't use the walnuts because I didn't have any and used white cake mix instead of the yellow.

This is so wonderful and easy.  I live in Mexico now and last holiday season I made this in small loaf pans, gave some to my Mexican landlords and they loved it.  Will be making again soon.  Thanks so much.

I loved this cake.  I've made it since 1986 and got it from a woman named Marilyn Routsong while we were stationed in West Germany.  It is best HOT! out of the oven or COLD! from the fridge.  Her husband used to bring it into the office in the winter and set it on the radiator.  It made the office smell so nice and warm all morning long.  This is my daughter's favorite cake.

This was pretty good. I think it would be best with a spice cake mix. It tasted better a day or 2 after making it.

Awesome! I used the Libbys pumpkin pie filling to make it a little quicker. I've had several people ask for the recipe, and my husband that usually doesn't like pumpkin is now insisting I make this for Thanksgiving dessert. Thanks!

Very simple to make.  Added dash of cinnomon and nutmeg, and took prior advise regarding the melted butter and cut back on it.  I don't like pumpkin pie, but this is excellent.

So easy and amazing. Great all year round, I like it best chilled or at room temp. No one at a potluck expects this and it's always a big hit.

This is good, but not spectacular.  An hour was too long in my oven--and my oven does not run hot.  I would recommend checking on it after 45 minutes, just in case.  Great for the holidays, thanks!

Easy and good!  This came out like a crumb topped light pumpkin pie- very good.  I made it just as the recipe states (with pureed pumpkin).  What wasn't eaten for dessert everyone requested to take home.  I will make this again.  Oh and it DOES need either whipped cream or vanilla ice cream served with it.

Very good! I took the suggestion to mix the melted butter w/ the cake mix  before topping the pumpkin & it worked real well. I do think that next time I will not use the entire box of cake mix (I think I would prefer it w/ less). My daughter (who is a very picky eater & never compliments me on my cooking) took some home w/ her & called me up to tell me how good it was. Thanks!

This was a big hit at our Christmas party! Everyone raved! I was a little nervous about using the whole box of cake mix, it seemed too much but it worked out great. I used 1 c. melted butter( I had a similar recipe that used that amount) and used a tablespoon to evenly cover the topping. Very important to cover all dry spots. I baked for 55 min. and it was too long in my oven, I will bake less next time. Watch so it doesn't burn from all the butter. Great recipe and easy. Got more requests to make again for Xmas eve!

This recipe was just what I was looking for.  I am one of those who loves the pumpkin pie filling, but scrapes it out of the pie shell, since I'm not that fond of the crust.  The topping is delicious.  Hadn't thought to make a "dump cake" out of pumpkin.  This is upside-down pumpkin pie, only better, since it has such a wonderful topping.  It was a big hit at Thanksgiving, and I am already making it again for another get-together this weekend.  Thanks for submitting it!

This is great!  I was looking for an EASY recipe to take the next day to a party and was a little bored with pumpkin pie (I know that should be impossible).   I had tried some pumpkin cobbler at a craft fair and thought I could make that myself!   And then along came this recipe.  SOOooo easy, especially when combined with Libby's pumpkin pie mix can instead of the pumpkin, sugar, salt and pumpkin pie spices.  I used Trader Joes vanilla cake mix and it turned out GREAT!

I made this exactly as written.  Instead of canned puree I used actual puree I made.  The reason I gave this three stars instead of four was this~ I wish there were a way to make this cake look more appetizing!  Every time I make it I always come home with more than half of the cake~ and it's not due to taste.  It's because it just doesn't look appetizing.  I wonder what I can do to make it look different?  The taste is wonderful!

I was excited to make this as it sounded great from the reviews but unfortunately, my family didn't enjoy it at all.  The combination of ingredients is good but the topping comes out too sweet - probably the combination of melted butter with the powdered cake mix - pure sugar.  Also, the cake didn't rise as much as I expected which made for quite a dense, moist dessert.  Moist is good, but a lighter cake would have been better.

I was a little concerned when i ate this warm, as it the taste of the cake mix was too strong. However, when i let it sit for a day it was AWESOME! Even my 3 year old LOVED it and she doesnt eat anything!!

This was FANTASTIC!! I may never make pumkin pie again! I made this as written except for adding another egg and it was so good I didn't want to share it. Wasn't too sweet at all. I used a Pillsbury golden butter cake mix so maybe the brand you use makes a difference.

Everything was perfect!  I used 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar, as well as a yellow cake mix that was low-fat and sweetened with splenda.

After reading the reviews I expected something different.  The recipe name had "cake" in it...didn't know that meant the "cake mix" and not the texture...LOL  I followed the recipe exactly and mine turned out mushy!  Also the pumpkin had a very bland taste.  If I would have put the crust on the bottom and cooked longer it may have looked and tasted more like that "southern lady's" very famous recipe  on the food channel.  Maybe I have made too many versions of these types of dishes.  I may make it one more time to see if I have the same results.  I did cool this about 1 hour before cutting.  I'm hoping after placing in the fridge overnight the consistancy and taste will improve.

I made this halloween night, The comments were  "this is a keeper, let's make this on Thanksgiving, and Can I have
this recipe?" Although I found mixing the cake mix with the melted butter made it difficult to spread, next time i will try it like the original recipe suggests.
Other than that, this was extremely Fast to put together. I almost felt guilty getting all the compliments....almost. THANKS!

Delicious!  It was much better than we anticipated!  The crunch of the nuts was perfect in every bite.  We will be making it again, but thought that it was very sweet, and will try to cut back on some of the sugar.

This recipe is okay, but I found the topping to be too sweet, as most cake mixes are. Also, you'll coat the dry mix more evenly if you mix it with the melted butter before sprinkling. Not a bad recipe, certainly easier than pie, but I'd go for a slightly less sweet/greasy topping, more like cobbler.

Tried to lessen the fat and used fat free evaporated milk.  Also used "I can't believe it's not butter light"  Recipe was good and simple but I won't make it again.

This cake is so good that my boyfriend wants me to make it all the time. He doesn't need to know how easy it is to make. That will be my little secret. It was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner, but I felt bad because his mom's pumpkin pie was ignored. ;)

I made this yesterday and enjoyed it (a lot)! I do think it could be made with just using 1/2 C. of butter instead of 3/4. But overall it is a good recipe and is mmmmmm tastee.

RAVE REVIEWS
I also have a offset to the "sweet" if you like cranberries Try this-
grab a bag of fresh cranberry, follow the fresh cranberry sauce recipe, But reduce sugar to 3/4 cup and add in nutmeg 1/2tsp. when cranberry sauce is finished take 1 tbs. of the whole cranberry sauce and place into the center of imagined square of a portion,  in the 9x13 in dish--- this cranberry sauce adds a bit of tart to the pie/cake:) Hope you enjoy!

Delicious.  Found that unless I had company, had to make half of it. It's very rich. I took a small can of pumpkin and a box of Jiffy yellow cake and made an 8x8 size dish.

This recipe received mixed reviews at my house for Thanksgiving. My husband liked it, my mother thought it was okay, and I did not like it. I thought it was much too sweet, and I did not like the crumb topping at all (I used a spice cake mix).  I followed the recommendations of a few others and used the Libby's pie mix and cut out the sugar, salt and spice. I am not sure whether using canned pumpkin and adding the sugar and spices would have been better, but I will not be making this again.

I just tried this "cake" for an afternoon get together with friends.  It was a hit!  My guests raved about it and wanted the receipe.  This is a great holiday dessert that will easily become a tradition.  Instead of yellow cake mix, I used a spice cake mix that I had on hand and didn't add any additional spices.  It makes it that much easier to make.

Maybe with a different cake flavor this would have been okay but I threw most of it out..the bottom pumpkin layer was really good and just like pumpkin pie but the cake layer tasted ok on the first bite but as you went on it was almost bitter ..I felt it should have had sugar in it or something.

I used yams in place of the pumpkin and it was delicious, I do this all the time rather than use the canned pumpkin and using fresh pumpkin is rather daunting.

I always get rave reviews when I bring this to a party. I cover with foil for first 30 minutes of baking so nuts (I use pecans) don't get over-cooked.  Probably my oven or where my rack was placed first time I made it...who knows!  Super yummy! Thanks!

This dessert was really great, especially perfect for anyone who is not a fan of traditional pie crust.  I accidentally bought the pie filling instead of plain pumpkin, so I followed the directions on the back of the can instead which called for one less egg and a little less evaporated milk, and then added a few more shakes of cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice.  It still turned out great!  I mixed the cake mix with the butter instead of just crumbling it on top and then pouring the butter over, like some others suggested.  I also don't like nuts in my desserts, so I didn't use them.  Still, my family agreed, it's much better than traditional pumpkin pie, definitely a keeper!  The only problem I have with it is that it's not really a cake at all, and so the title is a bit misleading.  I call it "pumpkin crumble" since it's just pumpkin pie filling with a cake mixture crumbled on the top.  Super delicious, though!

My boyfriend loves pumpkin pie so I wanted to make something like that for his birthday in July. He loved it so much we made it for Thanksgiving instead of pumpkin pie. Very good, thank you!

This is good, very sweet though! I have to say that I do prefer pumpkin pie, but I am glad I tried this. Our guests liked it! After half way through of preparing the cake, I realized I only had white cake mix on hand so that is what I used and it worked fine! I made half with the nuts and half without. It is better with the nuts...it gives it a nice crunch.

This is one yummy dessert. I used the cake mixture on the bottom as a crust as others suggested. It was very good, but I might try it as stated in the recipe. My "crust" tended to bubble up and form waves instead of staying an even layer. If I try this again... and I'm sure I'll try it again... i'll only use half of the cake mixture since I loved the pumpkin taste and would have liked a little more of that yummy pumpkin in each bite. This is an easy and tasty dessert that I'd reccoment to anyone.

This is a keeper. If you hate using the pie shells or playing with dough--this is for you. I added a little cinnamon to the cake mix topping--just to make sure we could taste that comfort taste.! I call my son pumpkin man all the time(3 1/2 years)---today I made this and he LOVED eating this because it was called PUMPKIN too, but yummy enough for kids of all ages!!

This is by far one of my favorite pumpkin desserts and it is soo easy.  Everytime I make it all I hear is "oh my goodness I have to have the recipe"  If you like pumpkin you will love this recipe.  I prefer pecans so I use them.  I also use the smaller can of pumpkin but keep everything else the same.  I ran across this recipe using the smaller can of pumpkin but everything else the same in a Southern Living cookbook and it was excellent. Especially good for those that like the topping more than the filling!!!!

I used pumpkin pie filling and the pumpkin itself was a little bland. I will definitely add more spices next time and a bit more sugar. It was just not as spicy as I wanted but I will try next time to add more spices because I really prefer this to regular pumpkin pie.

Really good! I made mine using the pumpkin pie filling like others suggested and it turned out great, but when I had a small piece without whipped cream on it I thought it wasn't sweet enough and needed more sugar (must've been the pumpkin pie filling I used and not the recipe itself) but when I ate a small piece with cool whip on top it was sinfully delicious---just so scrumptious! We like cool whip with pumpkin pie anything anyway so it's all goooooood :) I made one and brought it to work and my co-workers raved about it!!! I'm making one tonight for dessert after Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow!

I made this 2 times in a row - very delicious!  I also used the pumpkin pie filling to make it easier (instead of pumpkin plus sugar and spice).  When I made it the 2nd time I didn't use all the cake mix and it was even better, as I prefer a higher ratio of pumpkin to the cobbler topping.

No, this was not a big hit with my family! Not really a cake at all, it's more like a crustless custard?! The cake mix just sat on top of the pumpkin and didn't get absorbed. I don't think I will try this again.

Libby's pumpkin pie mix and eliminating the sugar and spices is much easier!  1 - 29 oz. can Libby's Pumpkin Pie Mix 4 -beaten eggs 1 - 13 oz. can evaporated milk 1 box of dry yellow cake mix 1 cup melted margarine 1 cup chopped nuts.  softening butter in the microwave and then mixing it in the cake mix with a fork in a large bowl, like a streusel topping until it looked like coarse crumbs. Then sprinkle it with your fingers on top.

*Much* better when chilled. I used a spice cake mix and sprayed with butter spray, which gave me the toasted color all over.

I used suggestions from this site to revise the original recipe. I mixed  5  large (not Jumbo) beaten eggs; 1-13 oz can of evaporated milk; and 1 - 29 oz. can of Libby's Pumpkin Pie  mix. I also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla, just because I like a flavorful pumpkin pie. I sprinkled a carrot cake mix on top and added some raisins; I think I might use sultanas instead of dark raisins and might add coconut next time. Then I spread one cup of melted butter and about a cup or two of chopped walnuts on top and baked it for 55 minutes. I am wondering how this would be with buttered oats instead of nuts on top.

My brother loves pumpkin pie and he was doubtful about how good this would be. He took a bite and said, "This is better than pumpkin pie."

I used sliced almonds in the place of the walnuts (which make my throat itch) and brought the cake to book club. The ladies loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

This is a tasty, delicious, and flexible recipe. I didn't have a 29 oz can of pumpkin, so I used a 21 oz can of pumpkin pie mix, added a bit more cinnamon, clove and ginger, didn't add salt or sugar, and figured it was close enough. I only had a  15 oz box of cake mix, too. 

But it didn't matter - it tastes like pumpkin heaven and I ate it till I didn't feel good anymore.

Followed the recipe exact, just replacing the walnuts with macadamia nuts. Covered with foil for 45 minutes (as others suggested) and uncovered the remaining time. The topping became browned on edges and so I covered edges with foil, allowing the middle to remain uncovered because it was still soupy. I baked for over 1 hour and 30 minutes, and it finally appeared done. I left it sitting to cool. Cut into it later and it completely crumbled apart, seeming like it could have baked longer. I love pumpkin, and this was edible, but it is not the Pumpkin Crunch that is famous on our island :(

I have made this for years. However- the cake and butter combination is much better if you mix it in a separate bowl and then drop it on top in spoonfuls. it makes a wonderful crumbly texture. I add 1T rum extract to the topping as well.

I am an engineer so when I poor that butter on top and it drizzles off to the side or pools in certain spots it drives me nuts!  So, after I spread the cake mix on, I poke holes in the cake mix using a chop stick being careful not to go beyond the cake mix.  Then, when I pour the butter on, I aim for the holes.  It may help for those who get it too dry.

Great recipe! I have made this a few times and always get raves. Even when I forgot the cup of sugar, it wasn't bad. The cake mix and whipped cream on top give it enough sweet.

I made this today. What a hit ! I took it to my son's as part of the menu for game watching. We ate it with vanilla ice cream . Perfection. I adjusted the spices tho because I blend my own pumpkin spice. I use a lot og ginger in my mix and more nutmeg as well.My baking time was a few minutes more. It was so easy to put together. I am eager to share this with all my family & friends.

This recipe is excellent. I would only do one thing different.I make a dump cake recipe that is the same concept, except that you slice two sticks of butter and place the slices on top of the cake mix and nuts and then bake. This would take care of the areas that do not get butter/stay dry. Next time I will do that and it will be a 5.

It is absolutely fantastic. I hate pumpkin pie and was hesistant to try it, but boy I'm glad i did. I used Trader Joes Vanilla baking mix and it is just insanely good. I also used 1 tbsp of pumpkin pie spice, a lil less than 1 cup of sugar and a tsp of vanilla. YUM!!!!

This was really good.  But I thought that it needed a bottom crust of some sort.  It was more like a pumpkin pudding with a (very yummy) crumbly mixture on top.  Still...it was much better than plain 'ole pumpkin pie!

We just had a bake sale at work and I thought it was a perfect opportunity to test this recipe before Thanksgiving. It was such a simple recipe that I was admittedly a little skeptical, but with all the 5 star reviews, I knew it had to be good. I served it with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon and "Wow!"...it flew off the table with rave reviews. I saved a piece for my very picky boyfriend and was shocked that he loved it! As suggested, I used a spice cake, 4 eggs and 1 cup of butter. I might cut back on the nut topping a little next time. Easy, delicious and something different for our Thanksgiving table this year!

Made this last night for a crowd of 9.  Everyone raved.  I spiced with 3 tsp. cinnamon, and 3/4 tsp each of ginger, cloves and nutmeg.  Also used brown sugar instead of white (and pulp from cooked sweetie pie pumpkin).  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

My family loves this cake! I use 15oz of pumpkin instead of 29oz and follow the directions for milk eggs and spices as indicated on can of pumpkin. It only takes 45 minutes or so to bake, the pumpkin layer is much thinner and crust is crunchier(if there is such a word).Also I don't put the nuts on. My son who does not like pumpkin pie loves this dessert. Serve with cool whip and you will think you have died and gone to heaven....!

My sister and I don't like pastry pie crust so I made this for thanksgiving dessert instead of traditional pumpkin pie.  My aunt had three pieces and my nephew said it was the best pumpkin pie he's ever had!  As suggested I added cinnamon (1tsp) baked it for a little over an hour, but left out the nuts.  Delicious!

So so easy (and I'm a beginner) and very tasty. Good texture - pumpkin w/the crumbly cake topping. I don't like pumpkin but I made it for my husband and he loved it!

I made this for our annual pumpkin carving contest, and what a hit! The walnuts on top add great flavor and substance. I love the fact that it is SO easy to prepare and it is a KEEPER for sure! The only thing I would change is to add a few more spices to the batter, perhaps some cloves.

This is delicious and so simple. I couldn't find my recipe for pumpkin pie cake, and used this as a substitute--well, this is my new recipe!!! Not too sweet, with lots of pumpkin flavor. In response to the person who gave it only a few stars because the cake sat on top and didn't get absorbed---that is exactly what the recipe is suppose to do. The cake makes a streusel-like topping. Yummy!!!

This is wonderful. I have made it twice. (Once just as the recipe states and the other I improvised a bit.) I used fresh pumpkin the 2nd time and it was a hit. I had some left over spiced walnuts that I used on the top. I took some over to a friend's home and her kids loved it. Thanks Christine!

With the walnuts, the recipie needs more sugar, but without it's fine. A little bland for my tastes, but my husband loved it.

It's like an upside down pumpkin pie. The cake mix on top forms a crust. A friend of mine tried the cake I baked and she said, "I don't usually like pumpkin pie, but this is good!" She took the recipe home with her! I'm coming back to print out another copy for me so I can make it for the Thanksgiving dinner at church tonight! I highly recommend this for folks who hate making pie crust, but love pumpkin pie. This also will serve more people than a standard round pie, (only if you can keep them from taking large portions).
