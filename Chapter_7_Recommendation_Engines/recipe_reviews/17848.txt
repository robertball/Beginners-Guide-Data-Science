I thought it was great.  I loved the sweet taste to it.  However, I did make some of the changes suggested by other reviewers, 1 1/2 cup flour instead of 2 cups and 1 1/4 cup cornmeal instead of the 3/4.  You gotta taste this cornbread! Good job, Trish...

This recipe has real potential, but is not perfect.  The cooking time is completely off, as many have pointed out.  Using an 8 inch dish you have to cook 35 - 40 to get it done all the way through, then the edges and bottom are - while still edible - burnt.  I liked the sweet flavor, but the texture was just not really a cornbread texture.  I liked this well enough because I poured chilli over it, but when I tried it bare, it was too much like eating cake.  This is, indeed, the cornbread for people who DON'T like cornbread.  As many have pointed out, it is similar to Marie Calendars in flavor, but I usually use Marie Calendars mix for cornbread, and the texture is COMPLETELY different.

Note: Made it the second time with 1/2 cup less flour and 1/2 cup more cornmeal and the texture was MUCH better

this recipe made 6 large muffins...and delicious by the way. I have searched for a cornbread recipe that is not too sweet, not too bland, and not too dry...I have found it. I cannot believe how good this recipe is. I did cook for add'l three minutes. we made this sunday with the chili recipe on this site..it's listed just as chili...but if you type in a few ingredients in your search, it's made with dark beer and coffe amongst other amazing ingredients...takes minutes to prepare, 2 1/2 hours to cook and we've been making it nonstop since last fall...a winner for sure teamed with this cornbread! thanks!!!

This is the best cornbread I have ever had!!!  I did change the recipe a little bit, to make it more of a cornmeal texture, I put in 1-1/2 c. flour and 1-1/4 c. cornmeal, I also added a little bit of honey, because I like my cornbread on the sweeter side.  But this recipe is definitely a keeper!!  Thanks so much!

For my family of 10, I doubled the recipe and poured it into a 10x14 pan. I cooked it for about 40 min.  It was wonderful, very moist and sweet. Everyone in the family loved it!

After reading several of the reviews, I decided to make this recipe with 1/2 cup less flour and 1/2 cup more corn meal to get a more cornbread texture as suggested by another review.  It turned out VERY tasty.  However, the cooking time is off.  Need to cook about 10 minutes longer than suggested.

I tried a lot of cornbread recipes on this site and this is the best.  I will only make this one from now on.  It's not dry and it's very tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

Great cakey cornbread! I put in an extra 2T. of cornmeal, and the kids loved it. Was gobbled up in no time. --For those who are allergic to eggs/dairy, the eggs, butter, & milk can easily be substituted. I used 1/4 c. water for the 2 eggs, margarine in place of the butter, & soya milk, instead of milk.-- Happy munching! :o)

Absolutely loved this recipe!  Added 2 extra tblspns of corn starch for better texture & it turned out great.  I made regular size muffins & the 20 minute cook time was perfect - golden brown & cooked through.

What this recipe needed was instead of adding milk, add condensed sweet milk.  The cornbread was not as sweet as I thought it would be.  The condensed milk would be much better.  Other than that it was good.

I LOVE this cornbread recipe.  I am not a big fan of making things from a box, so I am always on the lookout for a good recipe for anything from scratch.  I made this recipe into corn muffins.  I noticed that the directions for the muffins were not included, so I'll let everyone know that I simply reduced the cooking time to about 13 minutes and they were PERFECTO!!!  I was actually looking for the copy-cat recipe for Marie Callender's cornbread, and I must say, I think I like this at least as well, if not better!!

It is a good, generic version of cornbread.  Good for those who don't like anything too fancy.  I did as others recommended and used 1-1/2 cup flour and 1-1/4 cup cornmeal.

This was an excellent recipe.  I used the cornbread for a stuffing recipe at Thanksgiving, so I reduced the amount of sugar that the recipe called for.  Because my husband is on a low-salt diet, I also left out the salt.  The cornbread was still good with those reduced ingredients.

This was such a tender cottony cornbread.  It wasn't really cornbread, though.  More like cake.  I will definitely make again, though next time I will reverse the flour and cornmeal measurements to get the grainy cornbread texture.  Delicious.

I tried this this weekend, it makes a very good, slightly sweet cornbread. I found these best prepared as large muffins, as the loaf I made is very crumbly and hard to serve. The muffins however, were excellent!

I tried the best cornbread ever at a Marie Callendar's restaurant and tried to make it at home without success until I found this recipe (thanks, Trish!).  It's an elegant cornbread with fine texture and a delicate taste.  You really can't beat this one.

My son and I really enjoyed this cornbread.  We especially love the cornbread from Boston Market and this comes pretty close.  I gave a batch to a friend who said it tasted a bit like cake.  This went so well with chili that I made.  I strongly recommend that those who like their cornbread a little on the sweet side try this. And I will definitely be making this again.  2 thumbs up Trish!!

Cooked it for 20 min longer than required, and the middle still did not get done.  I ended up microwaving pieces, otherwise the endges would've burned.  But the outside (that cooked properly) tasted great.

A real family favorite.....sweet taste is very much like that of Marie Calanders. Great with chili!!  If you like "true" southern cornbread...this isn't the recipe for you though.

This cornbread is so good. Almost like a cake. It was sweet but not too sweet and moist. I followed the directions exactly. My mom even asked for this recipe to replace her old standard corn bread recipe. Which if you knew my mom and her collection of recipes - that's no small thing.

This is the only cornbread recipe I have used for the last few years.  Cornbread is a HIGHLY personal taste, and while there are those here that don't care for this recipe - it is THE recipe for my family.  Hubby won't even eat cornbread in restaurants now because he says "it can't compare".  Don't let the naysayers or recipe changers alter your course - try this recipe just once- as it is, then if you don't care for this sweet cakey type, you will better know what you are looking for in your next search.   Good luck!

Thanks Trish, some of the reviews almost made me pass on your recipe, but having tried three others with limited success, I decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  It's an easy recipe with good standard ingredients and perfect texture. I didn't change a thing and made sure I blended it well.

This cornbread is awesome!  Just the right sweetness, not overly sweet.  I cook it in a round cake pan for 35 min.  I plan to try to make corndogs with this batter.

This had a very good flavor, but did not cook in 20minutes.  I cooked it for almost 50 minutes and it still wasn't done.  I think a larger cast iron pan, perhaps 10 inch would work better

I LOVE cornbread and this one is absolutely perfect with stews and chilis.  It is slightly sweet, but not too.  Absolutely delicious and very easy and quick.

This is by far the best cornbread recipe I have ever had.  I have now been making it for several years, and the secret to getting the timing right for baking is to pre-heat a cast-iron skillet in the oven, when the oven is ready, take the skillet out and pour the batter in.  If you use a well-seasoned skillet, you should only need a quick spray of oil to keep it from sticking.  The batter will sizzle when you pour it in the pan and it will cook up perfectly.  Another tip--as soon as it is done, take it out of the skillet or else it keeps on cooking after it is removed from the oven and will dry out by the time you get to piece 2!!  There is NEVER any of this left over at my house, the family devours every bit of it!!

I made this for my DH and DMIL  about three days ago and received great reviews. In fact after my DH took his first bite he said it was verrrry good, this was the FIRST time he has ever complimented me on a corn bread recipe (including the one from Marie Callandar's).  I did follow a fellow reviewer and used 1 1/2 C. flour instead of 2 C. and also 2/3 C corn meal. I didn't have a Iron Skillet on hand and was a little nervous but used a metal pie pan and baked it for about 30 min. I turned out just fine.  Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe with us Trish. I read in some reviews that this wasn't very good the second night, I would like to know what they did to it.  I put a wedge on a paper plate, put a damp paper towel over it and nuked it for 30 seconds and it tasted just as good tonight as it did when I first maded it.

This gets requested by my husband, which is high praise.  One change I make is in the ratio of cornmeal to flour--I use 1 1/2 c. of cornmeal and 1 1/4 cup of flour.  It's much more "cornbread-y" to us that way.  I also preheat the skillet, then melt a tablespoon of butter or two in the skillet before adding the batter.  That really makes it nice, IMO.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I have been searching for a sweet, not so dry cornbread and finally found it!  Thanks.  It needs to cook about twice as long as the recipe.  Since it is a very high bread, I though next time I might try a larger pan..

I am not a cook, in fact this is the first cornbread I have ever made. I do like collards and cornbread so I came to the Internet to find a recipe and I found this one. I made this with water instead milk. Absolutely fantastic!! I had to turn on the "Broil" on the oven to brown it on top. Maybe this is how it should be done to start with. Anyway I think I will add green onions next time and try that. This is my first experience cooking. Cornbread making was not taught in Medical School. Thanks to the author of this mix! Doc

Excellent recipe. Good texture and tastes great. I used a 9" cast iron skillet and a 5 1/2 " cast iron skillet. I turned the cornbread out of the skillet when it was done (it came out easily) and put then it back in the pan upside down. Then I placed it back in the oven for about 5 minutes. A process Justin Wilson (The Cajon Cook)called "sweating" the cornbread. 
Yum-Yum , y'all did good Trish!

I like cornbread, sweet and this definately was. You could almost frost it and eat it for dessert. Not for someone who does't like it sweet.

This is a sweet cornbread that's easy to make and GREAT to eat with a meal or a snack.  My particular batches usually accompany chili or stews, and the leftovers usually serve as breakfast with some honey on top.  Very simple, but with GREAT results!!!  Adding additional spices like chili powder or red pepper complement spicy foods.  As already mentioned, cooking times may vary but it's still not too long before it's ready to serve.  GREAT recipe!

Everyone in my family loves this cornbread!!  Even my three year old.  I cooked it in a 20" well seasoned cast iron pan and it came out PERFECT!  The cooking time was exact.  My husband just likes to "Grab a Chunk" and head out to work with it.  It's GREAT with all our meals.  Absolutely the BEST.  Be sure to coat the cast iron pan with a little extra Crisco and the bottom and sides will be crispy and golden brown.  I can't say enought good things about this recipe.  It's wonderful.  Thank you so much!

I have been looking for a cornbread recipe that is lighter than the "hockey puck-like" texture that I got with my mom's recipe.  I highly recommend this recipe to everyone who loves a sweet cornbread.  It is not overly sweet, either.  It's just perfect!  Try it with butter and honey!  Awesome.  Thanks so much, Trish, for posting this one!  GrannieMuffin :)  PS  I made it with nonfat milk and light butter.  It turned out perfectly when allowed to bake an extra 5-10 minutes depending on your oven.  Worth the effort!

My whole family loved this cornbread!  I would only mention that it does not have much corn meal, so if you like a real cornbread consistency, this one's not for you.  It is a new family favorite for us, though!!

This recipe never fails to satisfy. I make it almost as described here, but I use a Pyrex 9 x 13 glass dish. After baking 20 min at 400 I turn on the broiler for 2 min to give it a nice golden top

I've made this many times now, and it's turned out perfectly each time.  My modifications:  1) I use somewhat less than the suggested amount of sugar.  The cornbread is still sweet.  2) I use a 10 in. cast iron skillet.  I put about 3/4 tablespoon of unsalted butter in the pan, and put it in the oven while it's preheating.  Then I take the pan out after a few minutes, when the butter is melted but not yet browned.  I swirl the pan around (carefully!) to evenly coat it with the butter, and then pour in the batter.  This way you get a nicely browned crust.  Usually I end up baking it for longer than the suggested time, but it seems to be oven-dependent.  This cornbread has been a big hit every time I've made it for someone.  I think that cast iron is the key to making this a great recipe vs. a good one.

This is cornbread just how I like it - slightly sweet and deliciously moist! I use an 8x8 glass baking dish and it comes out great every time. Wonderful with texas or cincinnati chili - sloppy joes, too! Try putting sloppy joe or chili on the bottom of a glass baking dish, then topping it with this batter - makes a great casserole! No complaints about this one!

This is by far the best cornbread I have ever made (or tasted). I do not have a skillet so I used an 8 x 8-inch square pan. I needed to extend the baking time a bit (about 10 minutes...just kept a good eye on it) but it still turned out great. If you are looking for a very good cornbread recipe...you don't have to go any farther. This one is sure to become a family favorite.

I changed just a few things. I used one stick of butter. I preheated my griddle with vegetable oil for five minutes before adding batter. Cornbread had to cook for 30 minutes. Came out crunchy on outside and moist on the inside. Absolutly terrific!!

I wish I had of read the other reviews before I made this recipe.  I thought it was a little too cakey and needed more cornmeal and less flour.  Also the vanilla in it was a bit stronger then I wanted it.  And the cook time was off.  I had to cook mine for an extra 10 minutes.  Overall, I think with a few personal tweaks, this could be a good recipe for next time.

I have been married for over 11 years & last night my husband told me this is the best cornbread I've ever made.  We all loved it!  I did follow the advice of several others & use 1/2 cup less flour with 1/2 cup more cornmeal & baked it a little bit longer, but otherwise made no changes.  Delicious!!!

One of my best cornbread recipes..turns out great everytime.  I like to make them as muffins.  It took 12 minutes to bake them.  I also decreased the amt. of flour and increased the cornmeal, otherwise they didn't have the 'cornbread' taste to them.  I also use buttermilk as the liquid if I have it handy, but it's good with regular milk too.

Don't expect traditional cornbread with this recipe.  This made a nice light muffin that will go well with meals when you don't want a heavy bread.  Very tasty, but not close to southern cornbread.

This is the best cornbread recipe we've tried from this site (3) yet!  The texture was just right and the sweetness was perfect!  Only thing I changed was I added a little more sugar and instead of milk, had to use soymilk since we were out.  We loved it!

Tasted great.  Noticed others had same comment... use a larger pan that what is requested in recipe.  Bread raises so high and takes longer to bake.  When cooked in the smaller pan and the corn bread is so thick, it is hard to even pick up out of the pan without it falling apart.  Recipe tasted great!  Those who like a light and sweet corn bread, this is the recipe for you!

I followed other reviewers' advice and increased the amount of cornmeal by 1/2c and decreased the flour by 1/2c.  I also added a can of cream corn, green onions, jack cheese, and a pinch of cayenne.  Because of the cream corn I didn't have to add as much milk--I went by the way the batter looked and probably put in about a 1/2c or so of milk instead of the amount specified.  I made muffins and they took about 25 mins to cook.  They were FABULOUS!  Will definitely make again!

Very good!  I added one chopped chipotle pepper in adabo sauce as the last ingredient.  I baked it for 35 minutes instead of the recommended 20 but it was too brown on top.  I will bake it 30 minutes next time.

This cornbread is absolutely delicious! It is sweet and moist, and everybody will eat it. I needed to cook mine for a much longer time than the recipe indicated, however. An 8-inch skillet produces a very thick loaf of cornbread.

This was very good and very sweet. I did make changes though. 1.5 cups flour, 1.5 cups cornmeal, and I'd probably half the sugar next time. Cooked in about 25-30 minutes, perfect.

I really like this recipe! When making it, I decreased it by half, and made it into 6 cupcakes, so the serving size was 2/3 original. However I also accidently put double the salt in. Wow was the mixture salty!!! So I added some sugar to compensate. The result? Amazingness! Buttery, salty and sweet! It's texture is also really good, not to crumbly at all!

Though we did like this, I can only give the recipe 4 stars because we had to make some changes. Used the suggestion of most & increased the cornmeal, decreased the flour & decreased the vanilla to 3/4 teaspoon. With those changes the flavor was there but next time I will use a 10-inch cast iron skillet because it took too long to cook in the 8-inch, drying out even burning the edges. Super easy to throw together.

Very good, more like a cake  though.  I guess I was looking for a more savory type of cornbread. I can see that many would like this just like it is.  The directions are right on and using a hot skillet is a great idea.  I will use that idea on the next cornbread I try.

I've never been that big of a cornbread fan but my RFL (Reason for Living ;) ) asked if I'd make some soooooo I found and decided to try this recipe.  I followed it to the letter and had absolutely perfect results!  I now love cornbread and make it regularly.  Thanks, Trish, for the post!

This recipe did not work at all for me.  It was more like a sponge cake and had wayyyyyyy too much milk.  It also burned because of the cooking time.  Don't waste your time.

This is the best cornbread I have ever tasted! The cook time was off for me, but it turned out wonderful after I let it cook for 25 min. at 400 and turned the oven down to 350 for another 10 min.  I will never buy a mix again! Thank you so much for this great recipe!

I didnt care for too much for this recipe. I thought it would be sweeter.  Also the cooking time as others have stated is way off. I cooked it till it was done but the top was starting to burn by the time the middle was done.  The inside was fine but the outside was crunchy and overcooked. Maybe if you cover it that would help.  If I make this again I will def. change some things......which wouldnt really make it THIS recipe. EDIT:  I made this again but this time lowered the temp to 350 degrees, and covered it with foil for about 35 min,  then let it cook another 10 min uncovered.  It turned out 100 times better and it was sweeter and alot more moist than last time. I kept all the ingredients the same.

I followed another reviewers advice to make it more cornmeal-y (DMZENEFF) and use 1 1/2 c. flour and 1 1/4 c. cornmeal. I also used whole wheat stoneground flour to make it a little healthier and lowfat buttermilk. I think that the baking time might be a little off, as it's been in for 20 minutes and is still baking. Smells great. I plan on serving it with RaisinKane's Chicken Taco Soup. I'll update later as to how the family liked it. EDITED: Very good. I spread butter over the top when it came out of the oven. The way I made it was a solid cornbread, very tasty. It did take almost 45 minutes to bake. I covered it halfway through to keep it from burning.

What is everyone talking about?  This was an awesome recipe.  First time I've made Cornbread and my husband and his buddy just LOVED it.  Couldn't get enough of it.  It was fantastic.  No point in trying another recipe.  This one is the BOMB!!!!

This one is a keeper, moist and sweet.  My husband even thought it was better than his mom's.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 c. and added 2 Tbsp. of honey.  I also increased the cornmeal to 1 c. and decreased the flour to 1 3/4 c.

A great simple classic perfect for serving with stews or as dessert w/a dab of honey on top.
Like many others I reduced the amount of flour and upped the corn meal. I also used whole wheat flour. This one is a keeper:)

This is our favorite recipe for cornbread. I think the mistake that many of the other reviewers make is to assume that there is only one "correct" way to make cornbread. As with most recipes, there are many, many variations.  I grew up eating a heavier, savory cornbread, which I love... but this sweet and fluffy cornbread is my very favorite now.

Also, I think the baking time is accurate for the muffins only. Switch to a 9 x 13 for the pan of cornbread, and just adjust your baking time as needed.

The problem with such a great recipe is that everyone feels entitled to add to it / make it their own.  So, first, may I recognize and thank Trish for a lovely recipie.  It worked exactly as published.  It tasted great and drew the compliments of my guests.  Thank you.

My enhancements (take it or leave it)...

- I used shortening to grease the pan.  As a cast Iron fanatic I think I get better results with shortening, and it improves the seasoning.  Salted butter has a tendency to stip seasoning from young pans.  The result was a clean release of the loaf and a wounderful taste consistent with other review comments.

- Cooking time was lengthened by using a cold cast Iron pan.  I will compensate by oven warming the pan next time.

- I covered the dish for a few minutes after removal (from 32 min cooking) to keep the loaf moist.  This worked well.

- I am a Vanilla nut and I will consider 3X or 4X the amount of Vanilla (sort of consistent with the over-the-top Amusement Park theme) this should be a little extreme, no?

- To add calories, drizzle loaf with melted butter after 20 min.  This will enhance browning and topping flavor.

Great recipe, Trish.  Thank you.

A little sweet and cakelike. I like when cornbread gets a crisp bottom from cooking in a well-seasoned cast iron skillet (put the skillet in the oven with some butter to melt in it while the oven heats). This recipe didn't really yield those results. I think they would make a better muffin rather than cornbread.

I've been making this for a couple years now and realized I never reviewed it! This is sweet and cakey and comes out perfect every time. I even used sour cream instead of milk once and they still came out good - very rich though. I've actually never made muffins though - too much work! I just put it in a 9x13 pan. It's the only corn bread I ever make now. Great recipe Trish!

EXCELLENT! Baked in 8X8 Pyrex dish (don't have iron skillet). Used 1 cup sugar (we like it sweet) and doubled the baking powder because I used Oat Flour in place of Wheat Flour (wheat intolerant). I have to adjust slightly for that difference - and added 1/2 tsp Xanthum Gum to hold it together (Oat Flour has no gluten). Turns out like cornbread cake, which was very good! We loved it! It's nice when someone with gluten problems can adjust a recipe so that it tastes just as good! Thanks for the post!

Fabulous!
Like other reviewers, I lessened recipe by 1/2 c flour and added 1/2 c extra cornmeal.
Baked it in a 9x9 square at 375 instead of 400, for about 30 minuntes... I have to admit I was a little afraid to do it in the skillet!  Turned out nice and golden brown on the top with no burning.  Great flavor especially with a large dollop of butter on top ;)
Thanks for the recipe!

This is really yummy, but BEWARE: if you don't have a skillet that can go in the oven, an 8" round cake pan is not a good substitute! I guess the skillet must be 8" at the bottom, and wider at the top, resulting in a batter that's less deep than in the pan. In an 8" cake pan, the middle of the batter doesn't bake. I'm going to try again with a 9" pan. Tastes delicious though!

Let me put it this way....hubby and kids say that if I don't make this recipe again and SOON there will be a revolt!  I am now officially tossing my old corn bread recipe and making this one my new "old family favourite."   One little thing though, an 8 inch skillet is not big enough, next time I'll try one a little bigger.

This recipe is definitely not the Southern Cornbread that I am looking for.  It was much too sweet, the eight ounce pan is certainly not large enough and it tasted more like cake than cornbread.  I will keep trying for a better one.

This just came out of the oven and I sneaked the first piece!!  It is by far the most AMAZING cornbread I have ever tasted.  I reduced the amount of flour by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of cornmeal--but next time, I might just make it as is. This is DELICIOUS!!  I have never tasted a cornbread recipe with such a light texture.  Usually, they are very dry, crumbly, and starchy.  This is light, moist, and not dense at all.  I baked it in a regular 9 inch round cake pan for 20 minutes exactly and it was PERFECT.  The center is nice and moist, but fully cooked.  We will be enjoying this tonight with our dinner!

Very yummy but a tad too sweet for me. I'll definitely make these again but will use a little less sugar and less vanilla. Also will use a 10" iron skillet. The 8x8 was too small and made the cornbread too thick and hard to get done. But all in all a great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

The best cornbread I have ever had. Not too sweet, it is perfect. I reduced the flour by 1/2 Cup, and increased cornmeal by 1/2 Cup, as suggested by others. I also made muffins, instead of making one pan. The muffins were perfectly done in 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Will make again and again.

Very good, but if you don't have a skillet you'd better use a 9x13 pan. I used a 8 inch pie dish but after 30 minutes the center still wasn't done. Nothing wrong with the recipe though. It was delicious!

Very yummy.  Used a 9 x 13 pan, (as someone suggested)and 20 minutes cooking time was perfect.  For thicker bread, I would suggest an 8 x 8 pan & cook a bit longer.  This one is a keeper.

My first time making cornbread from scratch and what a hit. The cooking time did seem off as others mentioned but I didn't catch that until I ran into the problem. So after 20 min with an unset middle, I turned it down to 350 and baked for another 10-15 min. It worked great, no burnt edges and middle was set. Someone mentioned the consistency was moe like cake than cornbread and I agree but I liked it. Not overly sweet either which was a bonus on my opinion.

OK, here's the thing. I liked it and I liked it alot but it was a tad bit cakey for me. I was disscussing the recipe with my mother and she (an old southern lady) said "it ain't cornbread 'less it has more cornmeal than flour". So..... I went to a 50/50 mix and I must say, for my taste I enjoyed IT a bit more. However, if you want a powerful corndog mix then back of the baking powder and ....Whoa Boy!!! It can't be beat.

I followed the pack and did the 1/2 cup less flour, 1/2 cup more corn meal. I think the vanilla makes it more cupcake-y than some may like. I would reduce it to 1/2 tsp. Very moist & delicious!

I love this.  We double it and make it in cast iron skillet.  Sometimes I add a little more sugar or a baking sweetener and have used it as a french toast base or just toasted on a griddle.

I have been using Albers Yellow corn meal recipe (from the box) and was dissatisfied. This is the first corn bread recipe i tried other than Albers and is much more satisfied with it. The only thing i did different was cut 1 Tbsp of butter and substituted the milk with Soy milk. It still turned out rather good, but im sure it would be better with real milk. mom liked it.

This cornbread is fantastic!  I used 1 1/4 cups masa harina and 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour, otherwise I used the original recipe as is.  Light, delicate, and cakey; I can't wait to use it as a cobbler topping!

I had cornbread like this in Southern California at Marie Calandars. I have been hunting down the recipe for over 30 years. Cast iron 10' cooks it completely. 8 it took 40 minutes, 8' 30 minutes. I JUST LOVE IT! Thanks REAL BIG!

This recipe is for people who WANT a sweet, cake-like cornbread. I am a southerner and I like the traditional corn bread too. This recipe is perfect with pulled pork. Best recipe for this type bread I have ever tried. Thank you so much Trish! This is a keeper!

Yummy! We have cornbread nearly every week (we like it with tuna fish for lunch) and we've tried a number of recipes. This one is excellent - light inside, crispy outside. I cut the sugar to 1/2 c., used only 1 1/2 c. flour but 1 1/4 c. cornflour, and used oil instead of butter.

Really good cornbread but I like to place iron skillet in oven leave for about 4mins.  I have heard also to leave your cornmeal sit for about 5mins before you place it in hot skillet

Excellent! I gave it a 4 because I modified it.  I did what others suggested and used  1 & 1/2 cups of flour and 1 & 1/4 cups of cornmeal.  I also added a few squirts of agave syrup (it's like honey.  I just needed to use it up).  It had just enough sweetness and was very moist (I even used 1% milk).  I used this recipe for the Corn Dog Muffins recipe on this site.

I have been making this recipe for awhile, and my whole family loves it!  I make it in an 8 inch square pan and cook it for about 5 minutes longer.  Otherwise I don't change a thing!  Sometimes I double the recipe and cook it in a 13 x 9 inch pan baking it for about 45 minutes.  If you like sweet cornbread I cannot recommend this recipe enough!

Oooh no, this is no Jiffy mix.  This is the BEST cornbread ever!  It was moist, didn't have that grainy cornbread texture, was sweet, and sooo good. I did take the advice of another reviewer and added 1/3 cup sour cream for additional moisture.  Also, used a 10-in. skillet, as that was all I had.  PERFECT!! All my other cornbread recipes are out the window.

I did not like this cornbread.   I will admit that I did not have a skillet to bake it in so I used a Chicago Metallic 9 x 9 inch pan.     After the recommend baking time, my cornbread had a gooey center.  I did bake it for a few minutes longer but then got a very dry on the the outside edges cornbread.  Regardless of the texture, the flavor just was not there.   I will not make this recipe again.  I was so disappointed after the good reviews I read.

Well, I followed the directions but what I got was a half burnt, still raw in the middle, thick mostly inedible dark brown chunk. The pan size in the directions is too small, the oven too hot. The center of the bread wasn't cooked even though the rest of it was starting to burn. I had to cut away the entire middle of the bread, plus the edges and bottom were too dark and too tough to be edible, so over half of this wasn't even salvageable. As far as flavor, it was just cornbread. Nothing spectacular. Much like Jiffy. I'm not sure if I want to try this again with a bigger skillet and a lower oven temp or not.

Eh.  It's alright.  I'd rather spend .25¢ on a box of Jiffy mix and save myself some trouble.  There is too much effort going into it for it to taste exactly like jiffy mix.

This recipe tastes more like cake than bread, but that is how I like my cornbread, so it is perfect for me.  I just made my in a greased cake pan and it turned out GREAT!  Had to adjust for altitude (-2tsp sugar, +2T flour, -1tsp b. powder, +3T milk).

I didnt have fresh milk so I used condensed milk mixed in hot water. I used cream corn and I guess it was too much cause it became like bread pudding. The taste was good and it was filling too. My family liked it and I am taking it to the office tomorrow. ( View picture)

This was ok, I thought from the reviews it was going to be excellent. I rated it a 3 because of the flavor not being any different than store bought cornbread, and a pain in the butt to prepare. Mine also took way over 20 minutes to bake. Next time it would be easier to buy the boxed corn bread mix,add an egg and get good tasting corn bread in less time than this recipe took.

My picky daughter loves this cornbread. It does remind me of the Jiffy Corn Muffin mix, but better since its homemade. Very sweet and fluffy.. It is more of a cake than a muffin, but I will be making it again.

This is the best recipe for cornbread I have found, thus far.  I made the first batch exactly as the recipe called. It made a very sweet cornbread.  The 2nd batch, I cut the sugar in half, and added a little more milk to the mix.  It came out fabulous and fluffier than the first batch.  Thanks for this! Next time I will put diced jalapenos in the batter to really mix things up!

I really love this cornbread recipe, simple as it is. I add 1/3 cup of sour cream to it to add moisture, and I end up with a nice, dense, moist cornbread that doesn't need butter and honey to soften it up. Pour some hot chili over it and you've got a meal!

I made these into muffins and they tasted exactly like Jiffy corn muffins.    If you love Jiffy, you'll love these!  While this cornbread was very easy to make, Jiffy's easier so I'll probably stick with that for now.

Loved it, but wasn't wild about the graininess of regular cornmeal, so I mixed it with the milk and brought it to a boil.  Let it cool and added it alternately at the end with the flour mixture.  The result was wonderful, soft graininess, instead of sand.

This is very good cornbread.  I baked it in  muffin tins.  Made 12 muffins and a small individual loaf.  As others suggested, I used 
1 1/4 c. cornmeal and 1 1/2 c. flour.

Oh gosh this is good!  Used my kitchenaid for ease, and baked in a deep dish pie plate for about 45 minutes.  I also added half a can of drained corn, it adds great texture.  Made 8 huge portions.  My new cornbread recipe, and so much cheaper (and better for you) than the mixes!

Yum!! My family LOVED this cornbread. My husband even had the leftover for breakfast! I disagree with other reviewers that it was too sweet, we thought it was perfect. I did have to bake it much longer than suggested- about 15 minutes longer- probably due to the smaller pan I used. This one is a keeper, and I can't wait to make it again! Thanks!

WOW!  This is the best cornbread I have ever had.  I substituted the milk for soy milk and added frozen corn.

I made 9 large muffins out of this recipe and baked them for 21 minutes. They came out great and had a sweet taste which my boyfriend and I both enjoyed! However I made another cornbread recipe on this site several months ago(best ever corn muffins) which I preferred over these. They were more cake-like and moist.

Excellent recipe. I made it in a pre-heated 12-inch cast iron skillet, 20 min baking time was perfect. I tweaked the ingredients a bit. I used other reviews & used 1 1/2C Flour & 1 1/4C Cornmeal, added a touch of honey & small can creamed corn along with a pinch of cayenne ~ it was wonderful! Thanks for the great recipe.

I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of the white flour, and baked it a bit longer than the recipe called for...it came out great.  We all loved it!

A wonderful cornbread.  I substituted corn meal for corn flour.  Much higher and lighter bread.

This recipe was VERY quick and easy to make. I threw it together at the last minute to accompany a soup I was making and it turned out fantastic!  I had to cook it longer than the recipe calls for - about 30 minutes instead of 20 - but I 
also cooked it in a cake pan instead of a skillet.

This was soooo yummy!  It was quick and easy to make, something you can do while your main dish cooks.  The cornbread was not like your typical cornbread...it's not dry.  In fact, because of the amount of flour in the recipe, it was very soft and even a bit cake-like!  The sweetness was just right...I'm going to make this instead of boring old cornbread from now on!  :)

This recipe was too easy!  I loved it, sweet, but not too sweet.  Very moist.  I baked this 
in an 9x13 cake pan and 20 minutes was PERFECT!  Will definitely make again.  
Good served hot with butter.  I served it with a stew and with a lentil soup.  I couldn't 
stop eating the cornbread.

Finally, I think I have found the BEST cornbread recipe ever!! Oh, team this bread with some spicy chili and there is nothing better in this world...I baked this cornbread in a PREHEATED and OILED 10" (a very important step) castiron skillet and cooked for about 25-30 minutes. It was not necessary to make any substitutions. A truly superb cornbread. If you're looking for the perfect example of  traditional American fare- here it is. Enjoy!

Fast, easy recipe to prepare. The texture of the bread is pleasant, very
cakelike instead of overly grainy. A nice, tender, sweet cornbread. Cooking
time may vary, however, I had to bake it for 35min. At 20min it was
very pale and undone. Just keep an eye on it and test its doneness by
colour/clean toothpick. The result is delicious.

I love this recipe! I know a lot of people call this corn cake because of the sugar in it, but hey... That's how they grew up and that's ok! But for me, I love the tast and the texture, my dad always used to take day old corn bread and have in a mug crumbled with milk, and this recipe is perfect for that!! I am trying this for the first time using less flour and more corn meal and  excited to see how much better it will be with more corn flavor, plus using extra cooking time ( which is a major sticking point with the original recipe).. Wish me luck!  :-)

Really tasty!  Reason I only gave this 4 Stars is because mine turned out crumbly and I prefer a moist cornbread.  Want to try again and if it turns out better next time, I will change my rating.  I did cut down on the sugar, but it shouldn't have made a difference in texture.  Maybe it needs another egg or more milk?  You can't beat the flavor though so this is definitely a "try again" one for me...just in case it's me and not the recipe.  Thanks Trish!

I normally don't comment on recipes, but this one was incredible! I baked in an 8 inch glass dish for about 40 minutes at 400 F. The cornbread is just way too thick to be cooked for only 20 min. The edges and top browned quite a bit, but the cornbread cooked evenly inside and still tasted great. The bread reminded me of something you would be served at a country kitchen-style restaurant -- cakey, buttery, melt in your mouth delicious. I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla, but otherwise stuck with the measurements.

The recipe is very clear, easy and quick to prepare.
Was very good, but because I love my corn muffins sweeter,in the second batter I added a few tablespoons of honey.
Recommended!

cooking time seems to be a bit off, but after it was done, it was very good.  the first time I made it, I used a glass baking pan, and the second time I used a cast iron pan.  Definitely dose better baked in the cast iron skillet.

I also used 1/2 cup less flour and 1/2 cup more corn meal.  The timing and temperature is way off like others said.  I baked it for 40 min.+ at 350 degrees.  My husband said it was very good but not fantastic.

This cornbread is wonderful! For those of you out there saying it's just like cheapo Jiffy Mix - I must have grown up using the wriong kind of Jiffy, cause I remember it being dry and blah! This cornbread is MOIST, fluffy, flavorful, and YEAH SWEET! But if that's the kind of cornbread you like, then this will be perfect! Thanks for the awsome recipe - I will be making it frequently!

This was okay, but I think it needed more cornmeal. It didn’t have enough of the corn bread taste, I didn’t think. I doubled the recipe and just baked it in a cake pan until the top was golden brown. If you're looking for more of a cake type cornbread, you'll probably really like this.

Instead of regular flour, I used a small box of yellow cake mix (2 cups). Also, I made it in a loaf pan and cooked it for 45 minutes or so. (When I made it in a regular pan, it didn't cook that well.) It's amazing how a pan shape can completely change the end result! At any rate, when made in a loaf pan, this is amazing cornbread!

Excellent.  Even my husband, who is not a cornbread fan, ate two pieces!  Only problem I had is that I don't have an 8" skillet so I used a heavy 8" casserole dish and it took over 30 minutes to get done.

This is an excellent recipe.  My husband really likes it.  I've been making it for a few years and misplaced my copy, so I thought while I was printing a new copy I'd put in my praises.  My dad who likes traditional non-sweet cornbread will eat it but calls it cake.  Everyone else raves!

This was my first time making cornbread from scratch and it was soooo yummy!!  Thanks so much.  It was the perfect sweetness and I did like many others said and up'd the corn meal a bit and decreased the flour to make it a little more grainy.  Very good and will definitely be keeping!

I loved this recipe, the taste is out of this world. I had to use a larger skillet though (10-12) inch. It's the best I've ever had.

Of all the recipes I made at my 4th bash, this was the biggest hit.  I increased the recipe to serve 20 and ended up throwing about a third of the batter down the drain... and that was after making two additional batches for people to take home!!!  This recipe makes a lot of Corn Bread (though I did make cupcakes... hmmm...).  By far the best Cornbread recipe I have ever tried.  Thanks!

Very good corn bread. I cooked mine about 35 minutes, not sure why the 20 wasn't long enough. We had this with some spicy chili and the sweetness of the cornbread was great!

Fantastic sweet corn bread.  I baked it in a glass dish so it took a bit longer 25-30 minutes.  Fantastic with the Cajun style red bean and rice soup from this site. Will try with chili next time.

I've tried quite a few cornbread recipes from this webite, in the quest to duplicate my husband's favourite cornbread, which he swears is made with "vanilla pudding".  Failing that, I eventually settled on the recipe for Golden Sweet Cornbread, which I gave five stars.  But then recently I decided to give this one a try.  I halved the recipe because I was afraid it wouldn't fit in my skillet.  Even so, it came out very high, so I think I'll make it in a large pan next time, so it's a bit flatter.  It seemed very similar to the Golden Sweet Cornbread to me but I think this one keeps better.  It was very good the next day.  Anyway, my husband loved it and said it was the best ever, so I think this is what I'll be making from now on.  Update: I tried this in a baking pan, and it wasn't as good.  The skillet is the way to go.

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  I should have listened to the other reviews and reduced the flour and add more cornmeal. It was also not very sweet.  I was very disappointed. Especially after everyone had given this recipe such high reviews.  I will not be doing this again.

One word - AWESOME!  We prefer sweet cornbread and this is even better than the recipe I've been using the last couple of years (which I thought was great).  The only thing I changed was the flour to 1 1/2 cups and the cornmeal to 1 1/4 cups.  I used a 10 inch iron skillet which was the perfect size and baked for 25 minutes.  This has a great texture and flavor.  Can't imagine using any other recipe from now on!  Thanks, Trish!

This is an interesting recipe, more cake-like in texture than we expect in cornbread.  I would not care to serve with chili, etc., however, it might be an interesting addition to a bruch buffet.

WONDERFUL!! I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I baked it in an 11x7 dish for 25 minutes.  My husband was raving about this cornbread!  I will be making it again!

Great cornbread, in my Midwest opinion. My husband is from the South and he would heartily disagree. He calls this "cake" and does not want to eat it with a meal. He wants his cornbread sugarless, flat, and crunchy. But I love this recipe. I baked it in a 11x7 pan for 25 minutes and it turned out thick, moist, and delicious. The leftovers are great for breakfast with a little syrup on top. :-)

I hate when a recipe gets so many rave reviews and then doesnt turn out, then you read the reviews and find out everybody changed things! I really wanted to like this recipe, I need a good cornbread recipe. I will try it again with a bigger pan, the batter smelled and tasted good, but an 8" pan at 20min, even 35 min. didnt work. I finally gave up and we ate dinner without it.

Delicious, I had to cook mine twice as long though. I cooked it in a 9X13, did the 1 1/2 c. flour and 1 1/4 c. cornmeal and I added a can of green chilies and oh, 1 cup of cheddar cheese. It's great.....a bit moist though, so if you aren't into that you won't like this one, but SO good in flavor!

This recipe is fabulous.  I have cooked it multiple times.  I do always have to double the time to get the middle done, but it's wonderful when finished.  I also use equal parts of flour and cornmeal for a more traditional cornbread texture.  Next time I will try baking it in a 9x13" pan.  Thanks Trish!  This recipe will be the cornbread recipe I use from now on.

I TRIED THIS RECIPE AND I MUST SAY THAT I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED. IT WAS AN ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS RECIPE. THE ONLY THING THAT I DID WAS  INSTEAD OF USING 3/4 CUPS OF CORNMEAL I USED 
11/3 AND I USED 1 1/2 CUPS OF ALL PURPOSE FLOUR INSTEAD OF TWO. THE RECIPE ALSO NEEDED MORE TIME IN THE OVEN ABOUT 37 MINUTES BUT THEN AGAIN IT COULD HAVE BEEN MY OVEN. IT WAS A SWEET CORNBREAD WITHOUT BEING OVERLY SWEET AND THE TEXTURE WAS NICE AND FIRM NOT RUBBERY OR GLUEY LIKE SOME OTHER CORN BREAD RECIPE. MY FAMILY HAS REQUESTED THAT I MAKE IT AGAIN AND THEY ARE A TOUGH CROWD TO PLEASE. MY THANKS GO TO THE RECIPE CONTRIBUTOR.

Absolutely delicious!  My mother who hates cornbread agreed to taste it to placate me and ended up eating two big pieces.  Had a great sweetness to it.  Perfect with chili and jalapenos would make a great addition.

This is a great cornbread recipe.  I cut back on the flour and added extra cornmeal as others have suggested.  My husband has already requested it for a second time.

Delish, moist, and fluffy!  I've made several cornbread scratch recipes and this one is my favorite of them all.  Popped right out of the iron skillet.  Very fluffy and crumbles great.  This is "company" quality!

This cornbread, with the cajun chicken pasta, were how I was introduced to this website by a coworker.  I've always served them together ever since.  I haven't made it this summer so it's been awhile, but it seems to me I have to bake it longer than the recipe says.  Thank you for sharing this, Trish!

This was wonderful!  I didn't have a skillet so I used a 9 inch glass deep dish pie plate and it worked just fine, I just had to bake it for 8 minutes longer.  My husband is very picky and said that this corn bread was better than his grandma's!  Now that's a compliment! I will definetly keep this as my cornbread recipe and may add some shredded cheddar cheese next time I make this.  Thanks for the recipe!

This tastes great!  I didn't have a skillet and had to use a glass baking dish, so it took a little longer to cook.

This was very good, and easy to make because I had everything on hand. It had the perfect amount of sweetness, and it tasted great with some honey-butter that I whipped up and a big bowl of gumbo. My only complaint (and it's a small one), is that I found that the next day, they were very hard. But they are very moist coming right out of the oven!

I made this recipe without changing a thing except I baked it in a Jumbo Muffin Pan.  It made 6 Jumbo muffins.  I probably had to bake for 25 minutes or so to get the muffins to get to the "golden" stage.  This is a keeper for sure.

I'm stuck in Germany with no Jiffy mix so I thought I'd give this a shot - I substituted vanilla-sugar for extract and it still came out tasting better than any cornbread I've had before.  I will definitely be using this next time I make chili!!!

this was very good but a bit dry. It reminded me of cornbread that I had when i was visiting San Antonio, TX. I was hoping for this to taste the same and it came very close. I'll try making it again and hopefully i'll perfect it the next time.

WOW!! That is how I would describe this recipe!  It was very easy to prepair and turned out fabulas!  I did increase the bake time by about 10-15 min.  I had my family over for a BBQ and they all raved about the corn bread - they couldn't believe that I made it from scratch!  Look out Marie Calandar, you have some compatition!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a good recipe but i wish i had added the entire amount of sugar.  I only added 1/3c but think it would have been that much better if i had added all of the amount called for.  I also added some grated cheddar cheese in the batter which made them very tasty. I will make these again.

This was easily made and tasted very good. I cut the recipe in half but next time I will let it cook longer. The middle was kind of mushy. Overall, very yummy crumbled over chili!

What can I say that has not already been said - these are sweet and excellent!  It does puff up quite a bit so make sure your skillet is big enough.  The one I used was too small so I had some baking over and then had to bake it longer so the middle would be done.  Next time I will probably try to make muffins.  My 5 year old loved it!

This cornbread is really good...everyone loves it.  I've made it several times and each time I had to bake it for an additional 9 or 10 minutes.  I used nonfat milk and cooked it in an iron skillet.

This is delicious!  I followed the advice on a previous review and put the cast-iron skillet with a small bit of oil in the oven while it was pre-heating - it made a nice crust!  My kids slurp this up!

This cornbread, served with "Chili" from this site, was probably the best meal I have had in a long time!  I thought this was wonderful cornbread, exactly as the recipe is written.  My husband doesn't like cornbread like my grandma used to make (dry, crumbly, with nothing but cornmeal flavor), so I thought I'd try this one that everyone said is more like cake.  Well, we didn't think it was at all like cake, but it had a nice hint of sweetness and was pretty moist for cornbread.  I made muffins (the recipe made about 16 regular sized muffins), and found the 20 minute bake time to be perfect.  Thank you for this recipe!

This is the best cornbread I have found.  It tastes just like Mom's.  I used a cornbread mix (thats all I had on hand)and just omitted the ingredients it had in it. I also placed my skillet with my grease (veg. oil about 1 Tbsp) in the oven until hot, so that it gave the cornbread a crispy outer area. Great warm with milk.  Thanks!

I've never tried cornbread before and it turned out better than I expected.  It's definitely not sweet enough.  I made muffin sized corn bread and I'm not sure what I'm going to do with them, probably add ethier honey or icing on top of them to make them sweeter!!!  I love the texture of this bread

This had a great flavor but I cooked mine in a black skillet and it still was not done after 35 minutes.  Perhaps if a larger skillet was used, the cornbread would not be as thick, requiring such a long cooking time.

This tasted great, and had a nice texture!  The only problem I had was that it was not fully cooked in the middle.  I kept it in the fridge for a week, and merely heated it up in the toaster oven as needed.  I will make this again.

This was a very easy and quick recipe. The cornbread was fabulous, and that part about transporting you to a magic kingdom hits the spot! I used a bit more vanilla and a little less sugar, and it turned out great.

Great. It is my new "family" recipe for corn bread. Worth the trouble of getting the mixer out. Just be sure not to under cook. I needed to cook it longer than suggested.

This was a very easy recipe to make that turned out delicious.  The flavor was just sweet enough and the texture was reasonably light and airy for cornbread.  I will definitely use this recipe for cornbread again!

This recipe is "okay".  I expected something that had a heavier texture and MORE of the cornmeal taste, this was more like a "sweetened bisquit" with a hint of cornmeal taste.  On the whole, it is a recipe worth trying, but I probably wont be making it again.

This is more like a cake than a bread. It also took longer than 20 min. in an 8" cast iron skillet by which time the edges were overcooked. But it was fine for cornbread casserole.

I used this recipe for corn muffins (It makes 18 muffins.) The baking time of 20 minutes was perfect for the muffins.  If you add more time they will burn. They are fantastic!

This was the most wonderful cornbread I have ever eaten!  And I mean it!  I served it with chili for a family dinner, and my parents and sisters loved it, as well as my very-very picky husband and daugther.  I usually hate cornbread, its too grainy, too plain, but this is great!  No honey, no butter, nothing needed!  Great Recipe!

I thought this cornbread was excellent. The only change I made was the change in measurements on the flour and cornmeal. It was very cake-like and a little sweeter than I’ve had but really enjoyed it. Will use this one again.

I did like the idea of it having a bit less of a corny texture, but I added 1/4 cup more cornmeal and 1/4 cup less flour anyway, as suggested by the other reviewers. I also replaced the 2 eggs with a bit less than 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce, since I was out. I cooked it in a rectangular glass pan, around 8x11" for 30 minutes or so. The glass pan made it nice and crispy on the top and bottom, while it was moist and soft in the middle. It was the fluffiest cornbread I've ever had! However, do note that it is not very similar to most cornbreads, so it would be better served as a sweet dessert than a side dish for chili/soup.

As I like a more "corny" texture, I also followed the advice of others and added 1/2 cup cornmeal and reduced the flour accordingly. I also used buttermilk in place of whole milk. The texture was perfect! Very tasty as well.
However I am so glad I did not bake this in an 8 inch skillet as directed. I used a 9 X 2 inch round cake pan and it was full. I thought it was going to rise over the top, but it didn't. It also took 15 minutes longer to bake than the directions state. I will make it again many times, but I will use at least a 10 inch skillet or 13 X 9 inch pan next time.

The corn muffins turned out perfect in appearance and texture.  There just wasn't enough corn flavor.  In the future, I would reduce the flour and add more cornmeal.

Deliciously sweet cornbread! This cornbread was amazing! I followed the recipe to a T & my cornbread came out sweet & very much cake like. It cooked up beautifully. My only complaints would be that I did have to increase my cooking time by about 18 mins & I would also cut the vanilla in half next time. Other than that, this recipe is perfection!

I love a sweet cornbread and made this recipe today for the first time, using some other reviewers recommendations, ie., less flour and more cornmeal.  They turned out beautifully; however, they weren't as sweet as I like them so next time I will increase the sugar.  Otherwise, a perfect  cornmeal muffin or mini loaf, hot out of the oven with butter and strawberry jam.  Yum!

I followed other reviewers advice and altered the amount of flour vs. cornmeal. I only had whole wheat flour because I baked a lot this weekend. Put it on top of a chicken pot pie filling and baked it according to the directions for the cornbread. Turned out very well! Family loved it. Great corn bread recipe

I searched for a good cornbread recipe. All of them were bland except for this one! It is delicious and sweet. My search has ended. I will always use this recipe. Hubby and kids love it. I have even used it in place of cake for "Strawberry Shortcake". Super yummy!!

I too make it with 1 1/2 cups flour and 1 1/14 cups cornmeal. Only cornbread I make. It bakes up so fluffy, almost cake like. Reminds me of the Tippins cornbread we used to have at the Tippins restaurants. So good. Have made it dozens of times. Thank you for this fabulous recipe!

Because I love my cornbread/corn muffins sweet, this was THE perfect recipe for me. I added 1 tbsp of honey and made them as muffins (6 XL ones). Halfway through baking, I sprinkled a little extra sugar on the tops. By doing this, the recipe tasted exactly like the ones we had at Disney World which are unforgettable, to say the least!  I made them with dinner and there was nothing left for breakfast the next day! I did have to add 5 minutes to the baking time, but ovens do vary.
Very seldom does a side dish outdo my entree (in this case, my homemade southern mac n cheese), but these muffins did. I will never make another cornbread recipe again.  Outstanding!

Like others, I decreased flour by 1/2 cup and increased corn meal by 1/2 cup.  Used 10 inch cast iron skillet.

This recipe produces a slightly more cake-like cornbread than I prefer. Although this cornbread was good, I like a grittier version better. The cooking time also seems to be  low estimate. Won't make again.

I followed the recipe exactly with no changes. This yields a tender cornbread with a delicate crumb. It's not overly greasy or sweet... Great recipe!

Sweet but not too sweet. Corny but not too corny. Not moist. Not dry. Not crumbly. Not cakey. Perfect. (Followed exactly)

Fantastic recipe!  This is definitely my new go-to recipe.  This really straddles the line between a Northern and Southern cornbread.  It's sweeter and more moist than a traditional Southern-style cornbread but less sweet and less cakey than a Northern style bread.  It is lovely to eat plain and holds up well to chili also.  Love it!  I baked mine in a pre-heated, greased cast iron skillet.

My family loved this recipe!  There were no leftovers.  I made it exactly as directed.  Cooking time was perfect using a 8 inch cast iron pan (i believe this is the trick for this recipe to cook through).  It had crisp edges and it was moist and light.  No complaints here!  Like my 13 yr old said, its perfect the way it is.  It's like having cake for supper (I might try reducing the sugar in the future just the same).

I changed the flour and cornmeal measurements as suggested by MRS. THOMAS (1/2 c. flour and 1 1/4 c. cornmeal). This is the cornbread recipe that I've been looking for. The batter made 12 nicely rounded muffins.

Fabulous.  Like some suggest, I added more cornmeal and less flower.  I heat my stainless steel pan with the preheating oven, toss a pat or two of butter (make sure to roll it up the sides) and add the batter.  I also add corn kernels.  So delicious I am only allowed to make once a year (Because we eat the whole thing in one night.  And there's only two of us!)

Just handed this recipe over to 21 y.o. cousin who's trying to impress his grandma with his newfound skills & not only did he rock the recipe but it was the biggest hit of the meal too. It's not at all dry, not gritty either actually, I almost feel like I could eat it like candy. And clearly, it can be made by anyone!

I followed others suggestions and used less flour, more cornmeal. I also used buttermilk in place of the regular milk, because that's what I had. Yummmy! Thanks for posting this great recipe

My husband is raving about this recipe.  I balanced the flour and cornmeal, but I put it into a 9" square pan and lowered the temp to 375 for 30 minutes.  With a toothpick coming out clean it was done!  Delicious.

I made muffins out of them and they turned out very well.  I can't give the recipe a 5 star because I modified it.  First I did the 1 1/2 cups of ap flour and  1 1/2 cups corn meal.  I also added 1/4 tsp of Mace.  They are practically all gone before they were cooled.  Making more now.

We love sweet cornbread, and this fits the bill. I reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and use 1 cup of white whole wheat flour and 1 cup regular flour (tastes the same to us). It always takes 25 minutes in my large cast iron skillet. I usually serve with honey butter - it's almost a dessert :)

Great cornbread/muffins!  I did as others suggested and used 2 C (GF) flour and 1 C corn meal.  I also cut the sugar down to 1/2 C and were still sweet enough.  I even had problems with my mixer and did not properly beat the butter and sugar; ended up eventually dumping everything together and stiring. This recipe is foolproof. Delicious.

I made this cornbread today for the first time, for luncheon guests. It turned out perfectly!! After reading other reviews, I increased the cornmeal by 1/2 cup and decreased flour by 1/2 cup. I also preheated my cast iron skilled in the oven before adding the batter. I cooked mine for 25 minutes and, again following another suggestion, flipped it over and baked it another 5 minutes. My husband is moaning because I sent our guests home with the leftovers! He was hoping to have it for dinner. I'll make this often -- maybe as soon as tomorrow, if I get to the store for milk.

Wow, I made this cornbread for lunch today to go along with my Chicken Tortilla soup and it was FANTASTIC!! We couldn't get enough of this cornbread!! I see that some people said they changed around the amounts of flour and cornmeal and I may try that sometime but we all loved it as it is.  I fried some chopped up bacon in my black cast iron skillet then pour this mixture on top of the bacon & bacon grease.  I did not even keep track of how long I baked it, I just took it out when it looked like it was done, flipped it over onto a plate - and it was perfect.  The bacon grease adds so much, some people may not like this idea but others will love it, so try it.  This is now our families new favorite!!  I would add a photo but we ate it all!
Oh, and yes, it does taste a lot like cake because the texture is moist and not dry like a lot of corn breads.

Delicious cornbread! I increased the cornmeal to 1 c. and cut back on the flour a bit. I exchanged 1 c. of whole wheat flour for 1 c. of the white. I also added some wheat germ and ground flax seed and left out the vanilla. Cooking time was longer, by 10 minutes in an 8x8 pan. I will definitely make this again!

In my experience twenty minutes is NO Where near enough time to bake this.  I'm now left with a very dirty, burnt oven and a hmmmm campfire smelling kitchen from taking this out and seeing the still liquid inside slosh out of the pan and drip all over the oven.

Putting it back in for 15 additional minutes and will use the toothpick test to ensure it's actually baked through when I take out of oven for attempt#2.

I sure hope this tastes good, because cleaning the oven is not one of my favorite tasks.

Wowowowow! So good! I love how sweet and moist it is! I could even eat it as a dessert! I did about 1/3 of the flour as whole wheat and it added the perfect amount of that healthy texture. They're really filling, and go great with everything!

Found this cornbread to be very dense and with little flavor.  The search for a "johnny cake" recipe continues.

I followed the recipe to a tee. Worked great, had good cornbread flavor. only thing i did was to preheat my cast iron pan and also baked twenty two minutes vs. 20. Kids asked for thirds it was so good.

This is the perfect recipe. Just enough sweetness.

I made muffins and did have to adjust cooking time, but I think that's true with backing almost anything-you have to adjust to your oven. :)

GREAT tasting recipe, like Jiffy mix but smoother texture. BUT used 1 1/2 cups flour and 1 1/4 cups cornmeal per other reviews and cooked in a 10 or 12 inch skillet. Been looking for a sweet and not too dense cornbread recipe, and this hit the spot!

This recipe just didn't work out for me.  I followed the recipe exactly a written but I do wish I read the other reviews first.  I found the muffins to be dry and nothing like a cornbread. In fact there was not enough corn so made it taste like a dry plain muffin.  I'm sure there is a way to Jazz this recipe up, maybe less flour and more corn.

Okay, I'm a southern girl  and I've never had a taste for sweet cornbread. My Hubby is a yankee and it's all he'll eat. After 20 yrs of trying sweet cornbread recipes, I found one my WHOLE family likes, even ME! AWESOME recipe! Thanks for sharing!

My family loved this recipe, but I found it a bit too cakey.  I even changed the ratio of cornmeal to flour like other entries did.  I guess I expected the flavor to be more intense than it was.  Good, but not my fav.

This recipe did come out dry, second time I modified it by adding a pack of instant vanilla pudding and switching out the sugar for honey..Its a great base recipe though and I would reduce the sweeteners in it by half for use as a chili topper

Best cornbread I've ever made, Marie Callendars included!  I substituted the all-purpose flour with rye flour and instead of sugar used molasses-butter for the fat is hands down the best!  I made muffins with my batter-they were light, sweet, rustic and I'll make em' again!

This is the only cornbread recipe I use now.  I usually make muffins, rather than a skillet.  I get 16 regular sized muffins, and they are always moist and delicious.  My picky eaters gobble these up!

I am a true believer that you should follow a recipe in order to give it an accurate rating and I did just that. This cornbread was so dry that the only way I (I say I because everyone else in my family only ate 1 bite) could eat it was by dipping it into the chili that I had prepared. I don't know what went wrong but I will not make this again.

I used a greased cast iron skillet and it still stuck. I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and omitted the vanilla.  Following another review 1 1/2 C.flour and 1 1/4 C. cornmeal. Had to cook an additional 10 min. and rest in oven 5 min after turning off. Excellent recipe! Nice crunch and texture.  I will definately make this again!

This recipe was okay.  It was defiantly sweet. I started out using 1 and 1/4 cup cornmeal and 1 and 1/2 flour. I used Whole Spelt flour and had to add an extra  1/2 cup of flour.  I put them in muffin cups and they got done in about 23 minutes.  They weren't to bad.  A little to sweet for me.

I used a heated divided iron cast skillet with a small amount of bacon grease in each before adding batter.  This was an EXCELLENT corn bread.  I loved the crunchy texture of the corn meal.  I served it with honey and butter.  Grandmother, husband and kids loved it!

I read the reviews and decided Mrs. Thomas sounded like she just "knew". Whoo-hoo! This is the best cornbread and the ONLY recipe I will use. It tastes just like Tippins! Thanks Trish!

This cornbread recipe has become a staple at our house now. We pour our batter into muffin tins instead of the skillet.The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the cornbread doesn't taste as good the next day. Best eaten fresh out of the oven.

I make this cornbread at least once a week.  Just finished a slice with chicken noodle soup.  It is not grainy or dry like the "from the mix" cornbread.  It is cake-y and delicious!  A true family favorite!

This has more of a light, cakey texture than a dense, mealy one. A little sweet, but not too much so. We really loved it served with chili!

Followed directions to the letter and it this recipe had a cakelike flavor and texture, extremely moist and fell apart before I could get it on the plate. Not at all like the cornbread I'm used to. My oldest daughter liked it so it wasn't a total bust. I'm surprised that this did not appeal to me given the rave reviews.

I absolutely love this recipe! I made it for a church lunch and there were barely any crumbs left over. I only have a 12-inch skillet so I have to scale the recipe up, but it turns out great every time!

I personally think it's a bit blan, so next time I would add extra sugar (maybe 2 tablespoons extra).  Otherwise very good, nice texture!

I'm sorry, but I thouht this was awful. It sounded good, but it had virtually no flavor and does not taste remotely like cornbread! I should have guessed from the flour/corn meal content, but I was trying to be optimistic. Oh, well.

I made this for a potluck dinner.  As muffins were easiest to transport, I tweaked the heating time to 15 minutes and the recipe yielded 16 muffins.  The bread was great with the chili but I do prefer a really sweet cornbread if eaten by itself.  Try drizzling maple syrup over the bread and letting it soak into the muffin.  Delish!

Pretty good cornbread.  Sweet, good texture.  I had to use corn flour (didn't have good cornmeal in China) and it came out almost like a cake.  It definitely makes a lot of batter, so use a deep dish if using only an 8" diameter.

Very good flavor however it was a little more cakey than my family likes. Next time I will add more cornmeal and use less flour.

quick, easy, and very good.  I did not have the 8 inch skillet so I made in a 8 x  8 baking pan.  I also made this recipe into muffins, I preferred this recipe in the muffin form.  Thanks for a easy cornbread recipe

I liked it. My 4-year-old liked it. My 2 year-old liked it. But my husband wasn't so fond of it. He said that it tasted too much like cake. This was very good if you want sweet cornbread.

I had to up the recipe for 12 servings as I have 4 kids and a hubby. We are use to slight sweeter cornbread from a box(haha). But my family loved this and it was easy to make. Will do again for sure.

This is *ABSOLUTELY* my favorite cornbread recipe of all time!  Everyone who has tried it (even those who say they HATE cornbread) loved it! Sometimes, for a change I add 1 can of creamed corn and reduce the amount of milk.  Thanks so much!

This was great.  I made the recipe exactly as stated except I baked mine in a 12 muffin tray.  Baked them for 20 minutes and served them with chili.  They were amazing.  My husband & guests raved about them (even professed cornbread haters) and one asked if they could take home the leftovers.  I'll search no more, this is the cornbread recipe for me.

If anyone is using a pyrex pie plate, 20 minutes is not long enough may be 5 minutes or more longer.  The taste is great, restaurant quality.  I will be making again and eat with chili.

This was good but being an old Texas girl, it wasn't my favorite type of cornbread. On the plus side, my hubby who hates cornbread did eat this and asked me to make a pan of it for his dad. (unfortunately, his dad likes plain old Texas cornbread too)

Yuuuuuuummy!  I made this cornbread into muffins for Thanksgiving.. a double batch yielded approx. 36 large muffins.  They were a HUGE hit with all of my 16 guests and they were gone in no time flat with lots of "Mmmm's" all around.  Excellent choice for a sweet cornbread!

Wow this was so good my husband thought I had ordered this from a restaurant.  He loves sweet cornbread so this was a huge hit.  I baked it for 30 minutes at 375 since I was baking ribs at that temperature.  They were a huge hit with the kids too!

This was good. It wasn't much like the traditional cornbread we're used to. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, but my family still thought it was too sweet (compared to the traditional cornbread recipe I usually make). They liked it, just thought it was too sweet. I also followed the advice of the reviewers & decreased the amount of salt to 1/2 tsp. & upped the amount of cornmeal & decreased the amount of flour to make them about even. That was a good move I think. I used buttermilk in place of milk too. I thought it would give it more flavor & it did. All in all this is not bad. I think I'll try it again only w/ 1/4-1/3 c. of sugar. That way it'll be closer to the sweetness of the traditional cornbread. Thanks!

I was quite disappointed with this recipe after reading all the good reviews on it.  I was hoping for a sweet, moist, cake-like cornbread and ended up with the traditional dry, crumbly cornbread that wasn't as sweet as I would like it to be.

I've tried numerous cornbread recipes and they just weren't right, until now that is.  Fabulous! I followed the advice of reviewers and reduced the flour & increased the corn meal.

Delicious recipe! I followed other's advise and decreased flour by 1/2 c and increased the cornmeal. I also added the kernels off of 2 ears of corn, and reduced the sugar by a little since the corn was so sweet. It turned out great, that vanilla is a nice touch!

I followed the advice of previous reviewers and added less flour and more cornmeal.  It came out more like cornbread than cake.  I thought it was good either way.  The second time I made it, I added a little honey.  I seemed to make it a little more moist.  All in all this  is a very good recipe.

This was too sweet and seemed more like cake or a sugar cookie versus cornbread.  I like sweet cornbread, but not like this.  Next time I'll just stick with the Homesteader cornbread recipe on this site -- tastes much better!!

I guess I am one of the few who think that is cornbread is not sweet enough.  After all the great reviews I hoped this would be good and sweet, but it was just an average, although nice, cornbread.  I guess I'll stick to adding extra sugar to my Jiffy mix.

Easy to make, hassle free, great taste!  A little sweeter and fluffier than cornbread I'm used to, but it was very, very good.  This recipe will be kept!

This was a very good cornbread.  I personally prefer the more southern style of cornbread (no sugar, salt, etc.), but this cornbread was also excellent.  Using a cast iron skillet gives the bread a great crust

Trish, my goodness! This recipe is AMAZING! I made a serving size for 24...1 of the 3 9x13 cassorole dishes was polished off tonight by 7 of us.  The remaining 2 dishes are heading off to work with family members tomorrow!!! They are expecting me to make more tomorrow for the family!!! SUGGESTION: For an extra sweet treat folks...drizzle honey on your cornbread!  YUM!!!

It's good.  I've never made cornbread before, in fact it was the first time I have even ever eaten it so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but I enjoyed it and so did my husband.  We ate it with chili and will make it again.

Excellent, nice crust and moist inside.  Followed ingredients exactly, baked in seasoned, preheated, cast iron cornbread pan.

This has to be the best cornbread I have ever eaten.  I am not crazy about cornbread, but I couldn't get enough of this recipe.  I used an 8 inch cake pan and cooked it for about 5-10 minutes longer and watched it carefully at the end to make sure it was done.  I have made this several times and it will now be my only cornbread recipe.

I've been making this for years. I do as others, decrease flour by 1/2 cup, add 1/2 cup cornmeal. This is a sweeter cornbread but that's how we like it. I agree that the baking time is off if you don't make these into muffins. 20 minutes is perfect for a dozen muffins.

I made a lower-glycemic version, getting rid of the all-purpose flour. I replaced it with 1/4 c. whole wheat flour, 1/4 c. wheat germ, 1/2 c. ground flax seed, and 1 c. quick-cooking oats. I'm sure my result is quite different from the original recipe, but just to let you know, I think my version turned out to be quite tasty!

I loved this recipe and couldn't stop eating it.  My husband prefers the more traditional cornbread and would prefer that I not make this again.  That was okay because it left more for me. :-)  I also adjusted the cornmeal and flour measurements to equal amounts.  Thank you for sharing.

I love this sweet cornbread. I made it in a 8" pie plate and it turned out just fine, although it took a little longer to bake than specified in the recipe. The only thing is I need to be really careful not to eat too many pieces. I will definitely make this again.

This was really moist and baked up perfectly in my iron skillet but I found it to be a little too sweet for my liking.  I did, however, like the buttery flavor of it.  Different from any other cornbread recipe I have.

It tasted great.  But both times I've made this cornbread, it didn't bake all the way through.  Even when I baked it longer the 2nd time, it was still very doughy & unedible in the middle.

Light, moist, sweet, and flavorful!  I like my cornbread a little crisp on the edges and slightly sweet, so I cut the sugar in this recipe to a little over 1/3 cup.  Baked in a 10 1/2" iron skillet.  This cornbread is fabulous!

Bake time was 25 minutes longer for an 8" square pan, plus I had to add an additional 2tbsp. of flour in consideration of our high altitude.  Tasted exactly like I thought it would.

This one was alright, came out more 'cakey' and less like cornbread.  The flavor seemed more bland because of the amount of flour compared to cornmeal..For people who prefer the cake kind of cornbread, this would be perfect!

For years I have been looking for a cornbread recipe that isn't crumbly, dry and one that will hold the butter and honey - this is it!!!  It's firm, holds it's shape and the taste is excellent.  Thanks for this recipe!!!

This recipe is really good.  I gave the recipe for my mom to do it because she had a taste for cornbread that day.  Made it with out vanilla extract because we ran out and it tasted good.  Must taste even better with it.  My whole family loved it and that is very seldom that that happens. It is very satisfying.  But it's best eaten warm, not cold.

This recipe is really good, but sweet.  Be careful with the vanilla...sometimes less is best.  My husband loves it with beans.

Very Yummy. It needed to be cooked about 10 minutes longer than the recipe said but that could have been because of my oven. It made A LOT! I had lots of it leftover.

This was the first cornbread I've ever made and probably the best I've ever had.  It left nothing to be desired and satisfied everyone.  It tastes great beside a spicy chili!
Thanks!

This was the BEST cornbread ever!  The cooking time is more like 40 minutes then 20 minutes though.  Next time I might use a larger pan, just so it bakes through a little quicker.  The bottom became quite brown (very done), because I had to leave it in so long to cook the middle.  But, overall it was fantastic, and I will definitely be making this again! ~Scarlett

I've been searching for the perfect cornbread recipe and I've finally found it.  I used slightly less sugar than what the recipe called for.  My husband loved it!
