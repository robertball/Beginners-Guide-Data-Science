I'm from the Caribbean and this recipe is incomplete - that's why it tasted awful. Firstly it would have tasted better with red kidney beans. The beans needs to be half cooked first, then add the coconut milk, then season with escallions, thyme, salt, black pepper, 1 peg garlic, a few allspice. Then add the rice and cook until done. Try that!

It smell really good but was pretty boring. I even added coconut flakes to it.

This recipe is great, I added salt and pepper along with some chives and loved it. I served it alongside some jerk chicken for a perfect meal!

It was okay - kinda sweetish, but very little flavor.

Quick and easy. I used this as a side with some vegan jamaican patties and callaloo and a rundown that I had all prepared from scratch so such a nice and easy side was great.

I make a lot of different rice side dishes and this one so far has been the family favorite.  I also added salt and pepper to taste (which should be a given) and I pretty much eyeballed the coconut milk and I also used the liquid from the blackeye peas in the rice as well as a diced onion.  My husband said so far this and spinach rice is by far his favorite

This was delicious,  next time I make it I will add two cans of black Eyed peas. I put a scotch bonnet pepper in a Tea ball in the broth while it cooked to add some more flavor and a teaspoon of salt and some freshly ground pepper.

I made it with light coconut milk. Otherwise everything as written. Quite tasty. Can be jazzed up with green onions, other crunchy things.
