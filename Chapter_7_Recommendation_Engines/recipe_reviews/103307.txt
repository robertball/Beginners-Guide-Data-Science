This recipe was very good and so quick and easy.  I've made this recipe twice in the past month and I think I'll double the hot sauce next time - it is not very spicy as is.

We didn't have the specialty cooking wine which likely would have made the difference! I replaced it with a pinot grigio which made the dish nice but not excellent. A decent, quick meal that made A LOT for my shrimp crazy family of 4. There were enough leftovers for next day lunch with salad. Might try again but am reluctant to buy a specialty cooking wine for a single dish.

This recipe was sooo good! I fixed this dinner in about 20 minutes using a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and Italian seasonings in place of the 2 cups of tomatoes!  I didn't have bell pepper, but next time I will use if I have it.  Tasted like I fussed for hours!  I added extra hot sauce.. We liked it spicey!  I will definately make this again!

I thought this recipe was good. I didn't have a bell pepper so I used steamed asaragus as a substitute. Also I put this over pasta. It was quick and easy. Give it a try! :)

This was good! Wife does not like spicy, so I used a store-bought cajun seasoning mix instead of the hot sauce/pepper. Had just the right amount of heat. Would make again.

Made just as written the first time except perhaps with one more dash of hot sauce and absolutely loved it. When I made it the second time I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I substituted canned. My suggestion- DON'T!  I cook a lot, try many recipes and believe this dish, as written, is an especially good one. Without the fresh tomatoes it was just ok, nothing I'd make again.
