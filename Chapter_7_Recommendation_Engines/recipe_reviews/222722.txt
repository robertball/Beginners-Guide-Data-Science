Simple salad with simple ingredients.
I was looking specifically for a salad using kale for nutritional and preferrential reasons and this one fit nicely.
Bite size pieces are certainly necessary with this type of lettuce because kale has so much substance.  Flavor seemed mile to me but the ruffle of the leaves and the firmness of it all certainly created a salad that made you recognize this was roughage.
I think this would be just as tasty served like a spinach salad with strawberries and almonds or a chinese chicken salad and just substituting the kale.

I liked the simplicity of the ingredients; the flavor of the kale is not hidden, but nicely balanced with the rest. I added some toasted sesame seeds instead of sunflower seeds. I also found it a touch too salty, so next time, I would reduce the amount. Drizzled in a bit more olive oil at the end.

I liked this salad quite well and am looking for recipes to use my newly grown curly leafed kale.  Only a couple of changes.  I used all extra virgin olive oil and agave nectar instead of sugar.  I think some herbs like dill or basil might make it nicer.

I am thrilled that I tried this recipe and that I read every review.  It is critical to massage the kale.  To do this, remove the stems, put a little olive oil on your hands, and knead the kale like you would bread for about 5 minutes, or until it is a dark rich green.  It's amazing how this changed the flavor.  I tried the dressing, reducing the lemon as suggested to 1/4 of a cup, but this was still to tangy for my taste buds, so I ended up not using it at all.  I made the dressing I make for spinach and strawberry salad, and it was great!  My 14 year old loved it as well.  I will definitely massage my kale in the future!

Just a suggestion for those who have said they blanch the kale. If you want to keep the nutrients and keep it a 'raw' salad, you can, 'massage' the kale for 2-3 minutes (google; massaged kale salad). This squeezing technique breaks down the toughness and bitterness, making it much more soft and palatable. Enjoy!

Great way to eat Kale.  Blanched kale then tossed it in dressing, sunflower seeds and cranberries and put it in the fridge all day (could even go overnight) then at the last minute added tomatoes and some chopped basil.  Nice balance of sweet and sour.

This is a tasty salad.  Love the tangy sweetness of cranberries and the crunch of sunflower seeds!  I blanched the kale for 30 seconds, put it in cold water to stop the cooking process, and then took off the stems and made it bite size.  I used several grape tomatoes instead of one large one, because they have better flavor this time of year.  I did not need the entire amount of dressing, only using about half.  Thanks for the idea.  I'm always on the lookout for another way to use kale.

After reading all the reviews, I made this salad with the following modifications:  I removed the stems of the kale and used 2 tbsp. of olive oil to massage the bite-sized pieces of kale.  I reduced the juice to 1/3 cup and used a blend of fresh squeezed orange (from one small orange) and lemon juice (from 1/2 small lemon).  I substituted 2 tsp. of agave nectar for the 1 tsp. of sugar and I decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp.  I omitted the oil in the dressing, having used it to massage my kale, and blended the rest of the dressing ingredients together and poured it over the salad.  I used orange-flavored craisins.  The salad was a big hit with my family and I will  be making it often.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was great - different from the usual for sure!  I used fresh lemon juice and a little extra sugar, added pumpkin seeds along with the sunflower seeds and my husband had two helpings of it.  We both loved it!  Thanks for the recipe.

My family and I LOVE this salad.  I massage the kale earlier in the day.  (Look it up).  I think it makes a difference.  The dressing is fantastic although I admit I only use half the called for amount of fresh lemon.  This is even good the next day if there is ever any left.

I am hooked on this salad! But, I did make a few changes. I added Coconut Oil instead of Canola Oil. I did not use sugar at all. My tomatoes were not seeded. I used cherry tomatoes...one of my favs! I find tomatoes to be nutritional in every way. Therefore, I cannot imaging wasting the seeds. I also did not roast the sunflower seeds. Honestly, I forgot. Plus, I was making Enchiladas simultaneously. And, I did not add the cranberries. I did not have any on hand. All in all, my 3 year old did not want to taste it. But, my husband loved it!

Best kale salad ever-however, lemon was a bit much; I'd cut it in half, but just added some extra butter lettuce I had on hand and that made it perfect this time.  Next time I'll add 1/2  the sugar or agave; I blanched the kale for 10 minutes; also added some goat cheese. No need to refrigerate. Superb!
*Next time I'll microwave kale for a minute with a few drops of water; so kale won't get too mushy..

I added green onions (I think shallots would have been better) and about 5 slivers of fresh ginger.  I omitted the tomatoes, because tomatoes seem to get a bit to soggy in salads for me, so I tend to add them right before serving or not use them at all. Bite size key word here, but bite size for a toddler, really, really small pieces, much more enjoyable. So very refreshing!

This is my hands-down favorite Kale Salad recipe! I don't bother with massaging the kale as some reviews have suggested; kale having "body" doesn't bother me. If it bothers you, try organic BABY kale. It's very tender and probably closer to what most people are accustomed to in a salad. I occasionally add crumbled feta, bacon bits, or diced apples--whatever I have on hand and am in the mood for. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is my all-time favourite salad. I have tried it many ways and love it every time! To get the kale softer, after it's washed and dried, rub each leaf with your hands, rolling motion, and then chop to bite size (1-inch). I usually just make a small individual portion for myself for lunch, and end up not using specific measurements. For an easy and HEALTY variation, I just use lemon, honey (instead of sugar, and salt & pepper, skipping the oils for the dressing. I find it just as good, or even better than the original recipe.

Super simple and super delicious. Did find massaging the kale is a must & thought there was too much lemon juice in the dressing ... reduced to 1/4 cup and it came out great!

I made this for an office tailgate and it was AWESOME. It was the first dish to disappear.  I did use 2 teaspoons of agave nectar instead of sugar. I wanted the dressing to be more sweet than sour.  Also added walnuts.

Excellent! I was looking for a simple way to use up some kale and spinach. This did the trick! I didn't have tomatoes, but I added an avocado. Might add nuts next time. Definitely a keeper!

This salad was delicious and simple. Love the dressing. Another reviewer suggested masssaging the Kale but if you use baby kale , as I did, there is no need.

It was delicious, simple and healthy. . The sweetness of the dressing balances the bitterness of kale. I think next time I make it I will chop the kale. I added chickpeas and that gave it more substance and some protein.

I wrapped this in a tortilla, added cayenne for kick, diced dried tomatoes and added with the Craisins.  Massaged it all together with a little olive oil on my hands.   I cut the wrap in slices to share with the family but they were a little tardy getting to the kitchen so I ate the entire wrap.   C

I have made this twice in the last week.  We really love it.  We received wonderful fresh kale from a friend's garden.  Love the simple dressing.  Adds a real special flavor.  I made no changes except I use cherry tomatoes cut in half rather then one large one.   Thanks  for the great recipe

I can't believe I liked raw kale so much!  I just wanted to make one plate for me, so instead of mixing the dressing, I just drizzled one part lemon juice to one part olive oil (no canola) over the salad and sprinkled a tiny amount of sugar, a little salt, and black pepper over it.  Delicious!

It was too lemony. Added 2 more tablespoons of sugar and still didn't like it.

I always knead kale first before preparing a salad. I sprinkled on the salt and half the sugar(1/2 tsp.) and kneaded for about 2 min. You can use a lot of kale this way because it reduces the volume to 1/3 of original size. I had a huge bag of kale that needed to be used so I probably kneaded the equivalent of 2 bunches of  kale. I reduced the citrus to 3 Tblsps. for the dressing and even with all the kale I used there was plenty of dressing and citrus taste. I didn't have sunflower seeds and substituted pinon nuts instead. Thanks for recipe.

I really liked this salad. I added sliced green onions, and chopped apple.  I did "massage" the dressing into the kale like one of the reviews suggested. I also added a dash of sesame oil to the dressing and used toasted sesame seeds instead of sunflower seeds.

I took the advice to massage the kale. It made a difference, thanks. I used a little more raw sugar and less lemon juice. Also substituted sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh. I really loved that change!! I keep a large amount of this in the fridge to munch on thru the week.

My teenager didn't like this recipe at all.
I gave it 2 stars because it did taste fresh and healthy.
We won't be making this one again. 
I put less lemon as suggested by others. And when the taste wasn't so great, I added feta. That just overpowered it even more

Wonderful! I had fresh kale from my garden and needed a new salad to try, so chose this one. So glad I did. I didn't have the dried cranberries but used diced dried cherries instead and chopped walnuts instead of the sunflower seeds. W loved it. I did knead the kale with olive oil on my hands before mixing it together.

This was my first try with a Kale Salad.  Absolutely love it, the only change I would make is to add some fresh garlic.

DELICIOUS!

Raw!  We love kale and it's nice to have a way to serve it raw.  This tart, tangy, nutty, sweet recipe will be used by us from now on.  So nutritious.  I did substitute the sugar for honey.

I used dino kale, and massaged it thoroughly. Didn't have sunflower seeds so substituted with pine nuts. Overall, the salad was a hit! Will probably make less dressing next time since we really had to drain the salad when dishing it out (but maybe the tomatoes contributed some fluid).

Fabulous loved it so quick and easy.  Only change would be a bit less lemon.
