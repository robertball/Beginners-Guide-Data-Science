I made this for my husband, and he made moaning sounds while eating the first few bites. He loved it. I'm a vegetarian, so didn't try it. I used perch and followed the recipe, except using lemon pepper, which we didn't have. I served it with rice and sautéed spinach.

Fantabulous!
I followed the recipe precisely other than using Swai fillets. I was wowed by the results. The flavor didn't overwhelm the delicate flavor of the fish but packed enough flavor that the fillets didn't need to be swimming in the sauce. I can't think of a single change I would make to this wonderful recipe. Thanks so much for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was AMAZING! My husband also made yummy groaning sounds (he took the 1st bite) and then I, of course, added to the musical harmony of happy groans. I used Trader Joe's Swai Striped Pangasius (in a red and blue bag). It had a wonderful texture. I hate fishy fish and am a tough critic when it comes to fish but I would make this anytime...so easy too! Oh and I used Chardonnay for the wine. For the side, I made TJ's Mulitgrain Blend (wild rice) with Vegetables (in bad-frozen section)- so easy, so delish! THanks, Kathy!

Used olive oil and sprinkled extra lemon pepper onto each piece of fish as it was frying.

It was very good and very easy to make. 
I didn't have lemon pepper. Perhaps, if I did, I would have scored it as five star instead of four.

If you REALLY LOVE LEMON, this is for you. I do and would have given five stars, but for everyone else it was too lemony. They did eat it, but my husband requested that I change the amount next time.
So, four stars in the overall household-pleasing category. I used barramundi so I believe this recipe would be wonderful with any firm white fish. (Barramundi is an excellent choice because it holds together well when turning.)
One other thing I would recommend - only use a wine you would drink. A huge part of the flavor is derived from the wine you use.

I made this with fresh rainbow trout. Next time I will use a skinless fish. I omitted the lemon pepper and lemon zest because I didn't have any. I salted and peppered both sides of the fish, coated it in flour, and cooked it in canola oil. The sauce was not thickening at all so I added a little flour to it. I served it with lemon asparagus and brown rice. The sauce was great over all of it.

This tasted fantastic! I've never cooked with wine before but it wasn't difficult, I used Pinot Grigio...recipe was great as is...I'm so thrilled to have a trout recipe that will be great for many years to come!

This is our new go to fish recipe. So delicious. So easy. Made exactly as written- except for fresh parsley. I think it was perfect without the parsley but will add to my list for next time. Thank you Kathy for a recipe that is delicious

I used Tilapia, but definitely plan on trying other white fish. I am not a big fish fan, however I would eat this a few times a week! It tastes just like chicken! The capers give it a briny, kind of salty flavor. I added a quarter cup of finely chopped onions that I sauted before the garlic. I also cooked the entire meal in my electric skillet. I served it with a hot pasta side dish loaded with fresh veggies. So delicious!

Just didn't have DRY white cooking wine. I don't know if that made any difference because it was my first time making this recipe. Either way, it was delicious!

This was sooo good! I used 2 tbs olive oil and 2 tbs butter instead of the vegetable oil in the beginning and I didn't have any lemon pepper seasoning or lemon zest, but honestly it was still one of the best dishes I've ever cooked. 10/10 would recommend to anyone. Will definitely be making this regularly!

This is a recipe is excellent as is. I had dover sole and it came out delicious. I will make it again! I served it with a side of Sun-dried tomato orzo from this site and it was excellent!

came out delicious! I was even pressed for time and mixed all sauce ingredients beforehand, then at dinnertime I browned the fish and just dumped the sauce in and let it boil. Saved time and it STILL came out great!

I made this as specified in the recipe other than the fact that I forgot to buy Italian parsley, so I skipped that. I used rockfish, which does qualify as a whitefish I think. In any case it was delicious, according to my one and only customer (wife).

Very tasty dish.  Need to find a bigger fly pan.  Very hard to flip whitefish. Need to really cook down the liquid to make the sauce right.  Must be organized.

It was good, but that first bite was super lemony. I will cut  back the lemon juice & zest next time.

My husband and I both enjoyed this. I used Swai for the fish. I, personally, thought there was a bit too strong of a lemon flavor and the capers add some acidic flavor, as well, so next time I will cut back on the lemon juice. I served this with wild rice and steamed green beans. Will definitely  make again!

This recipe looked like a winner so I prepared it for my husband on Father's Day. I followed your recipe using Orange Roughy and it was a delicious, special entrée yet so easy. The two sides I chose were potatoes and broiled Roma. tomato. I really wish I'd taken a picture because he called the dinner a masterpiece!

I cooked this with tilapia for the first time ( have made it many times with chicken) it was good. I would suggest cutting the butter in half. It was very overpowering and took the beautiful freshness away. It was very lemony which I like but can see how other reviewers we're unhappy. All in all tasty and simple.

VERY good. Will make this again. I was kind of lazy even, I used dried lemon zest, cooking wine, and fish that got lost in the freezer for years lol. So it's probably even better if you use fresh ingredients and a wine you'd actually drink. Served over rice.

I tried this with swai, as did some others, but with a little different twist.  I tossed the fish in almond flour that was seasoned w/ Cavenders then oven baked it at 400 degrees til done.  I made the sauce in a skillet and then added the fillets.  Was great this way and the fish held together.  I will make this often

I bought some ling cod at Costco yesterday and was looking for a simple, easy preparation and great flavor. This recipe fit the bill perfectly. I didn't have any parsley but everything else was done exactly as the recipe states. My husband and I couldn't stop talking about how great this is. Make it and make it NOW!

I didn't have any wine on hand so I used a cup of chicken broth instead. It was delicious. I'd like to make it again without so much butter but it really does make the sauce nice and velvety.

It was too much lemon in the sauce for my husband and I, but as soon as I can figure out the correct amount for us, it will be a fantastic meal!

Excellent easy recipe that will be cooked again and again! I used less oil than called for to keep down the calories with no problems. Much easier than doing chicken piccata!

Cinchy. Great. Quick! Free FRESH rainbow trout from neighbor following a trip to the Sierra Mts. They always catch more than they can use and God knows these days "free" is great.
I dbld the recipe and cooked 5 big 'ens totaling 2.5 lbs  My hubby devoured all but 2. He loved it too.
