I made this for a staff lunch today and everyone loved it!!  It also had an added bonus - the smell of it cleared everyone's sinuses.  It did have a kick to it, but the only ones who complained where the ones who had it plain.  It needs to be served on bread of some kind.  It takes a little bit of work to make, but it's worth it!

This was an EASY, delicious recipe!  I have searched for a shredded beef recipe for years, and now I've found it.  I used a smaller roast... about 3 lbs, and cooked overnight.  I used mine to make enchiladas.  The spicing was just right.  Muy Bueno!

My husband went nuts over this recipe. He says it's one of the best recipes he's ever tasted. He begged me to make it again as soon an possible, and often.

I have to admit he's got a point; th emeat was very tender and flavorful and made some oustanding taco filling.

I used maybe a pound and a half of chuck roast, cut up, and dumped everything into the pressure cooker, everything except the beer, didn't have so subbed 1 cup homemade beef stock, and used red bell pepper instead. Cut some spices in half but kept garlic and jalapenos the same.  I let it marinate for a while cuz we wern't ready to eat, then cooked. Made burritos. Dinner went like this, take a bite say "This is SO GOOD." 
Repeat after every bite.

This was a huge disappointment.  I followed the recipe exactly and cooked it overnight.  I woke in the morning to an amazing smell but the taste was decidedly bland.  It was just a roast.  I dumped red pepper flakes and habanero sauce all over it just to give it some heat.  Will not make this again.

Plugged in for 2 pounds of chuck - 3 servings, and it was awesome. I put it in at 9pm and turned it off at 8am. I put it straight in the refrigerator, and then pulled it out later in the evening for dinner. I reheated the entire contents of the crock pot on the stove top and it fell apart as it reheated... AMAZING

I didn't have tarragon or chili powder. 

I added about 1/2 teaspoon of oregano, cumin, and crushed red pepper, and about 1 teaspoon of kosher salt.

I doubled the amount of beer - I used Dos Equis.
I backed off on the hot sauce - Louisiana Hot Sauce

We ended up using this beef for tacos, but it looks like it would be amazing for just about any shredded beef application - sandwiches, enchiladas, or burritos.

TO DIE FOR!!!!!! Made it for a tailgate party the other night and got rave reviews. Very spicy but very tasty. Thank you Thank you Thank you
Update: If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would. I made it again last night for friends and my husband came home and was not a happy man when he found out there was none left. 
It is very spicy but if you can't handle spice cut it down. 
As my kids would say  OMG!!!  Its that good.

Great recipe....the meat really just falls apart - no shredding needed!!  If you're pressed for time like I was, just start the slow-cooker off on high for a couple of hours, then turn down to low....it'll be ready in six hours.  

If you truly like things spicy, you'll need to add more peppers or hot sauce....

A++! I followed the recipe exactly, using diet coke instead of beer (didn't have any) and it is awesome! Lots of flavor - spicy, but not overbearing, and the meat just falls apart. I served it with flour tortillas and pico de gallo (chopped tomatoes, onion and cilantro) and guacamole. I'll make this often for all kinds of occasions. Thanks!

Excellent as written !!!  I have made this twice and the first time made it exactly as written but felt it needed just a little more spice.  So the second time I added the following to the recipe: Used 1.5 cups of cola instead of beer (really like the flavor of the cola better), 1 cup of beef bouillon (used the cube and disolved it in hot water), a couple shakes of cumin, ancho chili powder and crushed red pepper flakes, 15 oz can diced tomatos, 3/4 can diced green chilis (dont like chopping my own jalapinos)  and 2 cinnamon sticks (cinnamon gives it a more traditional mexican flavor).  Rubbed the dry ingrediants on top of a 3.5 pound chuck roast put the roast in the crock pot then dumped all the wet ingrediants in the crock pot.  The liquid did just cover the roast which helps prevent the meat from drying out, left the slow cooker on low for about 11 hours, took the meat out and shredded it with 2 forks.  I then spooned some of the liquid from the crock pot over the meat.  I decided to make quesadillas with cheese served them with sour cream on top and it was out of this world good.  This recipe is a keeper and probably the best one on this site for shredded beef (Ive tried a few).  Thanks for sharing and enjoy !!!

This recipe entailed a number of firsts for this newish cook. I'd never cooked a chuck roast before, and never used a dry rub on meat either; it was also only my third slow-cooker recipe ever, I think.
This produced some very tasty meat that I had in burritos for days. I do wonder, though, whether all the spices were needed. The cooking left a lot of very spicy broth in the slow-cooker that tasted good over rice.

I love this.  I wrap the beef in flour tortillas and put them in 9 x 13 pan, top that with cheese and stick them in the oven to melt the cheese.  I also make a gravy out of the liquid that is left over to make a wet burrito.  Serve the gravy on the side....always a big hit.

This was exactly what we had hoped it would be! Perfect for tacos! Thanks for such a great recipe!

Make sure you use a dark beer (I used Newcastle) to avoid the bitterness that other reviewers talked about!

The best shredded beef i have ever had.  My family begs me to make this.  I didn't follow the recepie exactlly.  Another user on here suggested using mrs. dash chipotle seasoning so i did that instead of trying to buy all the seasonings it called for.  I used soda instead of beer. I just rubbed mrs. dash all over the meat and seasoned it with seasoned salt and garlic salt and followed the rest of the receipe exactlly

very tasty.. cut the recipe in half as we had a rump roast closer to 2 lbs.. after 8 hours it was more than ready.. and b/c of the very little liquid we made sure to keep an eye on it as we didn't want to dry/burn it.. bf had this in tacos.. i had this straight up.. wasn't "too" spicy.. but that would depend on the individual's preference.. ty so much for the recipe

YUM!  I might cut back on the liquid smoke next time.  It gave it more of a BBQ taste and I am into heat/spice.  My husband really liked it and I plan to make it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. My only warning - be careful which "heat" of hot pepper sauce you use. I used the HOTTEST one we had since it was such a large amount of meat - wow, it sure had a kick. My husband and son loved it, but I think they would put hot sauce on cereal. I would also say that this recipe is very versatile you could use this meat for lots of things. I put it in the crock pot over night and we had it for a football game half time. Perfect! * I didn't have liquid smoke so I substituted 2 tsp molasses and it gave it a slight smokey flavor.

Loved making in slow cooker. Had a very good spicy, smoky flavor.However,the meat part that was not IN the liquid dryed out some,(due to the very long time it was in cooker(10 hours). Luckily, I checked at 6 hours and turned over;that helped , but wished I had done sooner. Half the meat was very moist and the other half was a little tough. It was pretty spicy for us, (and I used only half the Tabasco and all the cayenne). If I make again, I will halve the cayenne also. Uses a lot of ingredients (although I had all on hand)and I think the meat part of "Shredded Beef Enchiladas" from this site, uses less, was equally good. I used beer this time, I will try with cola some time too.

We found this to be a fantastic dish! While I did tweak the seasonings a bit to taste (I added more of the recipe's seasonings and then some beef bouillon granules), I kept it pretty close to the original recipe. Extremely easy and extremely tasty. We will be making this again soon!

Super yummy but got bland after a few days. Easy to make and good on rice as well as in a taco. I might add red bell pepper and more onion next time.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I made exactly as it suggested minus the mustard power ( I made the screw up and bought mustard seed due to the shopping list just saying mustard lol) The taste was awesome. Not sure how people can say this has no flavor.  You need to go to the Dr and be checked out as your taste buds must not be working. Even my wife liked this and doesn't care for spicey recipes. I actually used this as a sandwich filler.  I split open a 8 - 10 inch roll. I put melted butter all over the bread and baked in the oven on 400 degrees for 12 minutes.  I then put the beef on the bread and put on some colby jack cheese.  I used the juice from the meet as a french dip juice and boy was I impressed.  I will definitely be going back and forth between this and italian roast, which I also use as a sandwich filler.  Yum is all I can say!  Great job on posting this whoever the owner of this recipe is :)

Hugely disappointed!  I followed the recipe almost.  Okay, so I subbed celery seed and a pinch of salt for the celery salt, poblanos for the jalapenos, and molasses and water (I was desperate) for the beer/soda.  Glad this was a make-ahead meal, as I would have been scrambling if it was tonight's dinner.  Boring, flat flavor; spicy without being flavorfully spicy; and leaves a smokey aftertaste!  Hopefully I can turn it into a soup or something to dilute the flavors.  Definitely will not make again.

Excellent recipe and very simple.  I used 2 Tbs of chile paste mix instead of hot sauce and Coke instead of beer.  

Serve with toasted tortillas, mexican cheese mix, and white or sweet rice (I used jasmine cooked with chicken stock).

Mmmm, we really enjoyed this. It's a unique recipe because it's spicy and flavorful but without the usual flavor of Mexican beef. I was out of liquid smoke and had to make without and it was still delicious. I also didn't have any fresh produce so left out all the veggies, if I were to add them in the future I'd probably chop and add with 1-2 hours left on the cooking time, just to preserve their texture. The large ingredient list makes for a very complex and satisfying flavor, will make again with few if any changes, thank you for sharing.

I thought this was a good recipe. Although instead of hot pepper sauce, and Jalapenos, I used one can of chiles in adodo sauce. It came out plenty spicy. I do have to agree that the dry spices were too many and complicated. I have found simply rub Mrs. Dash Southwest Chipotle Blend, along with garlic powder, salt and black pepper does the trick. Then keep the liquid ingredients the same or just dump in a jar of favorite salsa. Still add in your onion, bell pepper, and throw in some frersh garlic ! Easier and delicious !

This was delicious, just made it tonight. I followed the recipe except for leaving out the liquid smoke flavoring and taking the seeds off the jalapenos. Next time I would definitely add the liquid smoke flavoring and probably another onion. I loved how the onions turned out.   The meat was super tender and easy to shred and that was after only 7 hours in the crockpot (although I did use grass fed beef which cooks a little faster). I recommend this easy dish to everyone!

Easy. Tasted great. I used 1 roasted Hatch chile and left out the green pepper and jalapeno. I didn't have beer (hubby drank it while I wasn't looking) and so I used beef consomme instead. I used Franks Red Hot cayenne pepper sauce and cut it in half so it wouldn't be too spicy for the family. I only had a 2.5 lb. chuck roast though but I cooked it the entire time and the broth was all gone giving this an almost burned aftertaste. (my error not the recipe)  I did use mesquite liquid smoke. Thanks I served this with flour tortillas and corn tortillas. We preferred this with the corn tortillas.

I used this one a big scale - I quadrupled the ingredients for 21 pounds of beef.  Because it was for a crowd, I cut way back on the cayenne.  The result was very flavorful without being too spicy.  This is a very good recipe!!

Divine beef could be another name for this recipe! All the men in my house (including the 7 year old) raved about this shredded beef recipe. I changed nothing, except for the last 45 min or so had to add water-would have preferred beef stock, but I had none. Great recipe and thanks for sharing it.

This meat was really good.  It was so tender, it just melted in your mouth!  I used only 2 Tb. of hot sauce(I was a little afraid), but it could of used more.  I didn't have any liquid smoke, but it still turned out great.  I wrapped it in flour tortillas with beans, rice, cheese, and sour cream.  Will definately make again!

I give this 3.5 stars but admit I did not make it as described.  First I bought a Top Round roast which did not turn out as moist in the middle as it could have been (I did not cut in half because it was in a net). For the rub I did not have any celery salt or tarragon so had to do without but I did leave the rub on to set overnight in hopes of getting a stronger flavor. Also I did not have a slow cooker so had to use the stove and decided to make enough liquid to keep the meat covered. I used 16 oz. of Mexican Beer and added 1 cup of beef broth, 1 cup of salsa and 1 can of green chillies with juice. I simmered the meat on low with a tight lid for 11 hours. The smell of the liquid smoke seemed more like Tex BBQ though so I might leave that off next time I wish to make a Mexican dish like Machaca Con Huevo (shredded beef with egg).  For the Machaca, after shredding the beef I stir fried one chopped onion, a bell pepper and another can of green chillies with 1/2 cup of the reduced liquid from the pot. Then I soaked 21 oz. of the shredded beef in 4 raw scrambled eggs, then dumped it all in the pan with the veggies, a cup of chopped cilantro and scrambled them with 8 more eggs (for a total of 12). I served it with tortillas, avocado, cilantro and salsa-see photos.  It turned out pretty good, but I think I can do better with the beef. Next time I may try the "Slow Cooker Carnitas" recipe (which is great) but sub in the chuck roast and beef broth instead and see how that turns out.

This was sooo flavorful!! We used all of the ingredients as listed. It is very spicy, but full of flavor! I did add 1 and 1/2 cans of beer when I saw it was going to dry out, worked out perfect!! I also had to make a few burritos after 8 hrs of cooking, the meat shredded and was very good! I will be using this recipe again...Thanks!!

Excellent!  I made it for company and we ate it all week in various forms.  I still had some to freeze.  One of my guest made it though and she was not as crazy about it, she said it didn't have as much flavor even though we both followed the recipe exactly.  I wonder if mine had more flavor because I assembled it the night before, and then cooked it for 9 hours the next day.  I'm going to make it that way again and again.

I didn't particularly care for this. It smelled delicious as it cooked though.... I thought this had a slightly bitter taste even though I used Coke in lieu of beer (I didn't want to open a new bottle of beer just for this recipe - since I made this at 9 AM, I wasn't in the mood to drink the rest!). On the contrary, my bf thought this had a sweet taste, similar to BBQ brisket (go figure!). My bf always tells me that I set my expectations too high. When a recipe doesn't meet or exceed those expectations, I am disappointed. I was hoping that this would be very similar to Chipotle's barbacoa (i.e. spicy shredded beef), but it wasn't (well maybe...). If I would have ACTUALLY done my homework beforehand, I would have KNOWN that Chipotle's meat is braised with chipotle adobo, cumin, cloves & oregano - none of which are spices found in this recipe (duh!). My bf and I made tacos out of the meat (i.e. flour tortillas, fresh garden salsa and cheese) and served them with homemade guacamole (complements of the bf) & beer margaritas to wash 'em down. This was a filling meal, but I don't think I'll be saving the left-overs for the enchiladas I hoped to prepare later this week. which is a real bummer since I would have liked to see how well this meat freezes. Oh well! Thanks anyways :)

Hmm... I followed the recipe exactly, except for decreasing the hot sauce to 1 1/2 Tbsp. and used only one jalepeno pepper and this was still a quite a bit too hot for our taste. Cooked this all day (10+ hours) on low and still was not pull apart tender, actually was quite tough. I haven't had this problem with cooking a roast in a crock all day before. Never-the-less we used the meat (cut into chunks) on burritos loaded with sour cream and cheese to kill some of the heat and it was palateable. Probably won't try this one again.

This was a very flavorful dish and reminded me of the meat I get when we go to Chipotles. So if you like that - this was excellant. To go even further with this dish next time I think I will add a chipotle with some adobe sauce from the can.

This had to be the best dish I have ever made.  The marinate created during cooking is to die for.  I served this over mexican rice and thought I was in heaven.  This is a keeper.  I used a whole can of Diet Coke in lieu of the beer and it kept it well covered while cooking.  I didn't use the peppers as my family is a little wimpy.  Fantastic recipe, the secret is the marinate.  Use it.

This was so yummy!  I slow cooked on the stove top for 4 hours because I was already using my slow cooker for refried beans.  The meat was tender and very flavorfull.

Excellent recipe! To reduce the "heat" a little bit, I cut the Hot Pepper Sauce in half and added 2 tbls. of sugar - it still had plenty of kick! I served it at a neighborhood get-together and it was a hit!

I'm on the fence about this one.  I made it exactly as written, however I find the taste to be, well, almost bitter. (I did make it with beer and not a cola, which would make it sweeter, but I make other dishes with beer and don't think that contributes to the bitter taste.) I much prefer Rolando's Beef Catnitas recipe also from this web site.  Looking at all the other rave reviews, I'd say give it a try, it might be to your liking!

This was just an okay recipe for me.  I didn't like the smell of the liquid smoke at all!! The taste of the roast was very similar to beef jerky.  I'll have to make this recipe again because my boyfriend loved it, but if you ask me, there are better slow cooker recipes out there.

Wow, was this ever good. I made taco's with the beef yesterday, and today I'm making chimachanga's with the rest. Tastes much like we had in a Mexican restaurant in Arizona.

well I didn't have ALL the stuff on hand - missing celery salt and green bell pepper, but I did put everythign else in, and for teh 7lb briskete i had, it took about 14 hours on LOW (should have done part of it on high) to get to shreddable stage. Received many many compliments on it. Thank you sooo much for sharing!!!

I love this recipe, my family does too. I back off a little on the hot pepper sauce, but everyone adds what they like. I also add what's left over to a pot of chili, it adds great flavor. I'm working on incorporating this to a beef enchilada recipe, but haven't gotten in down yet.

Yessssiree! This one the hubby liked! He smiled when he came in the door and asked "What smells so da.. good!?" I used leftover swiss steak (since it's just the 2 of us now, we only eat part of a round steak...I hate to waste the rest!)and simmered it in my crockpot all day. Of course I had to taste test it along the way...we're lucky we had any left for supper. This is one that good for us working people. Put it on in the morning and come home to a feast. This one gets awesome ratings!

Very good recipe...used it as a burrito filling.  After I shredded the beef, I decided to add some tomato sauce as I felt it was missing something.  But you should try without as you might like it as is!

Thanks for the recipe!

I made this exactly how it says EXCEPT I used beef broth instead of beer or soda AND I added red crushed pepper... My husband and teens are absolutely ridiculous when it comes to spice. I went looking for a recipe before making my annual beef tamales. I was looking for something new and amazing. This was it.

I didn't change anything but made it as written as it was cooling it smelled soooooo good.   I cut my roast into three large pieces before I put it into the crock pot.  After about 6 hours it was still a little tough so I turned it on high for a couple of hours,  the meat was so tender  I had no trouble shredding it.   Used it to make tacos, delicious.  We had so much left over that I used some a couple of days later to make 'spicy beef' sandwiches on hoagie rolls with Swiss cheese.  Husband said they were delicious.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe. Everyone in my family loves it! Burritos, tacos, nachos, the list is endless. I do use 6 oz. of regular soda: Coke/Pepsi rather than beer and about a .25 teaspoon of liquid smoke.  Thanks for the great recipe Kyle! Yum.

This is our favorite way to have tacos.  The flavors are fantastic.  I use less (a lot less) of the hot pepper sauce since we have young children, but do everything else the same.

Delicious! I was a little worried that all the flavors might compete and overpower each other, but they all mellowed out to a fantastic, married flavor. Served it in flour tortillas with all the fixings. Very good. Thank you :)

This was a huge disspaointment to me. I followed the recipe exactly but I just did not like the way this tasted at all. In my opinion the Worsteshire and beer just did not mesh together well and with the hot sauce mixed in it just had the worst smell as it was cooking. My husband even commented on the smell. I definately will not try to attempt this one again but will stick to the traditional way of making Mexican style shredded beef.

I made this tonight and it got rave reviews!  I put the roast in the crockpot last night since it was frozen and put the garlic on top.  I cooked it all night and most of the day and it was SO good!  I have never had such wonderful tasting beef in a restaurant!  Awesome!

My wife loves shredded beef.  Like some suggested I made a fajita type dish out of it.  It was easy to cook and with a great flavor.  This was the first dish I ever cooked in a slow cooker, and will do again.  It was a hit.  I personally like spicy food, and did not find it spicy.  Everyone i fed it to does not though so i cut down on the hot sauce, they still found it spicy.  So if you dont like spicy cut out the hot sauce.  Great recipe

So... I didn't follow the directions exactly and that being said, this beef is FANTASTIC!!!  Due to deciding to make it for dinner for 2 in the early afternoon, I used a 2# skirt steak, halved the spices, replaced the beer with cola, omitted tarragon just cause I didn't have any, and slow cooked it on medium-high for 2-1/2 hours.  Fork shredding it was a little difficult since I fast tracked the cooking process, ended up doing most of it by hand, but once it was shredded I returned it to the liquid for another 30mins.  Then switched it to Warm setting and used the liquid to make awesome spicy mexi rice.  Made beef burritos with rice, black beans, avocado, lettuce, tomato, sour cream and cheddar and they were declared the BEST burritos I've ever made!  I'll make grilled quesadillas tomorrow and I can already tell this is the kind of meat that's even better the next day.  I can't wait to try it 'the right way' and cook it slow and low.  Maybe next time I'll try with beer- And for those who said the beer added a bitter taste, I think to avoid that use a good dark beer (like Negro Modelo or Guiness), at least that's true with corned beef which is a similar process.  THANKS!!!  TOTAL KEEPER!!!

I made this dish for an open house with many other dishes and had great reviews from all the people who attended.  This an recipe can be made in advance and also freezes well.  I tortillas and bread and people liked it on both I plan to try it in a puff pastry crust as an appetizer for an up coming holiday party.
Don't be afraid of all the items in the dish it really gives the meat a great overall flavor.

Super yum! I added a can of coke...what the heck.  Next time I will put the crockpot out on the back porch.  The house smelled like meaty yumminess for a week!  I used it for sandwiches, quesidillas and enchiladas.  Sooo good, yo!

Made this dish according to recipe. Smelled great, but tasted just ok. Will make again, however because husband liked it. We made shredded beef taco salads.

Good recipe. Used on venison, and it took the gamey taste out. Great for shredded beef tacos. A little spicy for little kids

Great texture, but not enough of that Mexican flavor I like so much. Almost had a "pot roaast" flavor. I made so much that we had burritos one night and tacos the next. For the tacos, I added extra seasoning to spice it up a bit. Smelled so good cooking!

Wasn't blown away by this one.  It's good and the meat cooked perfectly but the seasoning was just not great.  It smelled great cooking, but the flavor just didn't get into the meat like I expected with slow cooking.

This recipe is SO GOOD!  I have yet to have all of the ingredients on hand, but it turns out great nonetheless.  I did follow others advice and wrap roast in foil. Turns out fork tender everytime!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good.  I had to make mine on the stove because my slow cooker died. I used a can of chilies instead of the jalapenos and I didn't add liquid smoke just because I didn't have any. When it came out it was really easy to shred.  I made enchiladas with Red Enchilada Sauce (from Sara) and they turned out really well.  I will use this recipe again!

My hubby is Mexican-American and I was looking to make something comforting for him for Father's Day.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I cut back on the pepper sauce, used Pepsi instead of beer, and added a can of diced green chiles instead of jalapenos.  Served it with warm flour tortillas, fried potatoes, refried beans, and other burrito fixings.  He ate 2 LARGE burritos and took 2 more for his lunch today.  I will definitely be making this for him again.

This was just ok. I used it for burrito's. The texture was nice but the taste not brillant. Much prefer some of the lime based marinades for grilling burrito meat from this site.

WOW!  This is incredible!!!!!   The whole family loved it!  We did use it the next day for enchilada filling.  Neighbors ended up staying for the lunch enchiladas and they were raving about the beef!  (We did reduce the hot sauce.)

Even my picky eater husband liked it.  I will tweek it to my personal preferences next time using a bit more jalapeno peppers and a bit fewer onions.  Over all it was a big hit at our house.

Phenomenal recipe. I didn't have bell pepper or jalapeno so it was omitted. I also only had about 2 Tbsp of the hot sauce. Perfect flavor and the kids really enjoyed it in tacos. I also added some cornstarch mixed with water to the juices to make a wonderful gravy. I'll make it again for sure.

I thought the recipe was good but did not think tasted like Mexican beef.  As I have a syndrome for which I have to watch spices, I supplementeed more paprika and cumin in order to use 3/4 of red pepper and chili powder.

DELICIOUS! My crockpot's low setting is on the high side, so mine cooked in about 8.5 hours, but still tender as can be. Awesome recipe! Will use it again!

Made this when we went camping...not a good idea...did not have enough time to let it cook.   We brought it home and put in enchiladas and it was wonderful the next day!
