Loving this recipe. I did add a couple things. Before adding all that other stuff to the ground beef, I added taco seasoning for more flavor. For the rice, I used spanish rice. All about your preference, but great recipe to start with.

This recipe was great! I added 2 cups of sharp cheddar shredded cheese and I substituted 1 cup of black beans for the instant rice.

Very good! Everyone liked it. I did add taco seasoning to meat before other ingredients. Omited corn and used packaged fajita fillers that had rice and beans in it.

Followed recipe exact, except used canned corn instead of frozen (it's what I had on hand).  Anyway, it was alright, a bit bland for my taste.  Tried to flavor it up with taco seasoning, and hot sauce.  It's lacking something, maybe garlic?  However, it was very easy.  If you like very mild flavors than you might like this, but I wont make it again.

This dish definitely adds a little more flavor to our family Mexican food night. My husband and I LOVE it and will never go back to our simple "bean, ground beef and cheese" recipe. The picante sauce is a nice touch and it isn't spicy.
