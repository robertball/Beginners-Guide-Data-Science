My husband loves raisin cream pie and I thought I'd try this one for his birthday. It is very sweet and too rich for my taste. Also too many raisins. It's tasty and if you love raisins and extra sweet you'll probably love it. I prefer the custardy raisin pies with less raisins and with meringue topping. That being said my husband is enjoying it in small doses!
