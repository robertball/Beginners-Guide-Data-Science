I love this stuff! I used to have it as a kid and couldn't find the right recipe for years. However, now I have it and made it at least three times since I found it last year. It's so good and not too bad in the health department. No changes required.

This receipe is great, however, after combing the  the cranberries, pineapple and sugar this mix needs to sits for at least 2 hours to take away the cranberry tartness.

This was perfect! But make sure you follow the recipe. NEVER substitute the whipping cream for whipped topping.  I've found that this doesn't work in any recipe- especially, I'm sure, in something with cranberries! :)

Hey everyone, this was also my Grandma's cranberry salad recipe, but she taught us to combine all the ingredients except for the whipping cream and this the important part-REFRIGERATE IT OVER NIGHT- This helps the sugar and pineapple juice tame the tart cranberries. Then the next day whip the whipping cream and fold into the cranberry mixture. I love this recipe it has been a family favorite for over 50 years

yum!  My son won't eat anything with chunks, so I just added the nuts, pineapple, sugar, and marshmallows to the food processor after I had pulverized the cranberries.  My marshmallows were old and hard large ones so it took a while.  Then I drizzled some whipping cream (more like half a cup since that was all I had) into the food processor at the end.  My 4 year old, who normally would turn his nose up at something like this, said he loves it and called it cranberry whip ice cream.  He even asked to take it in his school lunch tomorrow!  I will definitely try this recipe again, but next time will try leaving out the sugar, it was awfully sweet.  Oh, despite what another reviewer said, I would never use whipped topping instead of whipping cream.  Whipped topping is incredible unhealthy and full of GMOs.

I don't know what went wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly except for subsituting the whipping cream for Cool Whip, yet it was very bitter/sour.  The sugar wasn't enough to compensate for the raw sour berries, no one could eat it and we ended up throwing our Christmas dessert out.  I might try this again but cook the berries with 1 c water and 1 c sugar first, then freeze and add the rest in and see how it turns out.  It sounds like it should be yummy if I could figure out what I did wrong...

I made the recipe exactly as written, and it turned out perfect. Everyone loved it, and I have a standing order to make this for every holiday.
