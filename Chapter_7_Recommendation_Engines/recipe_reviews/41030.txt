This is sooo good!  I used "Bacardis real fruit mixers Margarita" concentrate (because I was making the margaritas anyway) instead of the OJ concentrate & I had to skip the tequila due to the kiddies the dip still came out fab.  I only made a few skewers, for presentation and stuck toothpicks in the rest of the fruit (strawberries, grapes & cantelope) in a "chip & dip dish".  It looked nice & went well, thanks!!

I made this dip for a party and it was a hit...I was up late making it the night before and realized that I had forgotten the heavy cream...I substituted buttermilk instead and just added a pinch more sugar!  It was great, but don't know how it compares to the recipie as it is written, since it was my first time making it...Bonus, the buttermilk has a lot less fat than the heavy cream!  Enjoy!

I have made this a couple of times. It is very good, I really like it with angel food cake cubes. It looks very pretty severed in a Margarita glass.

This must either require tequila or I did something wrong. Not a good taste. More on the lines of "Tang" drink mix.

I tried this for a fiesta party we had.  I'm not a big fruit dip fan, but everyone who tried it thought it was real tasty.  I would make again if a fruit dip dish was needed.

This recipe was O.K.  Nothing super special.  I took it to a family get together for a dessert.  If I were to make it again I was use it as an appetizer or snack, not as dessert unless you're looking for something super light.  I've had better tasting fruit dips.

I have made this two times.  Both times everyone loved it.  I am planning to make it again for another party.
