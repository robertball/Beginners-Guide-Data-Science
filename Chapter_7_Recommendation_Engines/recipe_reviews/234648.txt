Perfect pasty filling.  I put it in a 13 x 9 pan and put a pie crust on the top.  Very tasty.

This was delicious, easy, filling, and most importantly, kid approved! We love rutabaga so I did a whole large rutabaga and one less potato, but otherwise as stated! I come from a family of yoopers and this tastes as good as any filling I've had while visiting the U.P. Will be adding to the dinner rotation and sharing the recipe! Thanks!

This makes perfect pasty filler! I used pastry dough to make mini pasties for toddler hands (using an upside down cup as a circle cutter, folding the dough over filling and pressing closed with a fork) to dip into ketchup. I chopped the veggies into tiny cubes and actually got some good root veggies into my picky eater!

This was so good.  We ate with a splash of ketchup on the side, cause that's how we like to eat our pasties.  We also used the whole rutabaga, otherwise no changes.

Very good pasty filling. It would taste great inside a crust if you want a traditional pasty, but also tastes good on itâ€™s own. If you like foods with lots of flavor you will want to add some spices, but for me the natural flavors of the food are enough.

I didn't think you could create a pasty taste without the pasty crust but this was as close as you can get.  Both my husband and I loved it.  Thanks for sharing Aunt Anna's recipe.  BTW, we live in Ontonagon, Mi.  Just 15 miles away from Aunt Anna.

I thought this was delicious. I topped with a balsamic ketchup and made per recipe. Really does taste like a pasty filling
