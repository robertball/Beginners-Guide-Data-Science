OMG! What a great steak sandwich!  The garlic/parmesan mayo is awesome!  I got away with using Hellman's lite mayo and it was still really good. I can see many uses for it. Instead of round steak I used sirloin and slightly froze it to get the steak thinly sliced.  I used a vidalia onion, cut up a green pepper and added that to the mixture. I used a bit more sea salt, Worcestershire and liquid smoke (just another dash).  And, even though I had the garlic mayo I did add a bit of garlic to the steak, onion, and green pepper mixture - just a little out of habit.  We got some really great rolls for these and the provolone cheese just put it all over the top! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was GREAT! I did have to add a little extra salt and worcestershire sauce to the meat while it was cooking, but that's just a personal preference. I also added tomato after it was baked, but again, that was a personal preference. We LOVED the garlic parmesan mayo and I think next time I would even add a little more parm. cheese. I think this would also be great with some sauteed mushrooms too. I will definately be making this one again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I did not try this myself but my two boys and husband thought this was quite tasty. My husband thought it was perfect, actually and he loved the Not difficult at all and fed my three boys quite well.  The portion sizes were exact, making two smaller filled hoagie rolls and two very full filled hoagie rolls. Next time I try this, I'd like to add in sliced red or green pepper to stretch it a little for myself. Four portions fed three people in this house. ;)

this has been a huge hit at several parties.  Used the thin sliced rare roast beef from the store deli.  and mada another version using pulled apart rotiseerie chicken.. Also used the dinner rolls you buy in the tray, cut them as one in half, toasted, and spread everything on. then baked it in the tray covered with tin foil. very easy to make a lot!!   Wow It is gone in 60 seconds!!

this was good as is,although had a very strong garlic flavor even for me,a garlic lover.i don't really know what the worstershire and liquid smoke was for as i couldn't detect either of the flavors in the meat. i will def. make again but will tweak it a little until i get what i was looking for. i was looking for a sloppy steak sand.,so maybe a little beef broth in w the meat and maybe tomato? thanks for a starting point,though

This sandwich is awesome! To ensure the round steak is tender, do the following: pound it out (if you don't have a meat mallet, you can stab it to death with a fork then pound it out with the back of a large heavy metal spoon), slice it as thinly as possible...paper thin!, or consider marinating it in the worchestershire for a while. The mayo sauce is awesome too.

We all loved this! After I cooked the steak with the onions, I transfered to a crockpot and added steak seasoning and allowed it to cook on low for a few more hours. It did fall apart a bit, but we liked it that way.... it tasted wonderful! My husband raved and said to keep this recipe on top :)

This recipe was delicious.  I purchased thin sliced round steak from my butcher, but still found the meat to be tough.  Next time I might pound the round steak first.  Overall a great recipe!

this was okay.  The mayo is very good, but the round steak was tough even after coking on simmer for 30-40 minutes.  May be better in slow cooker.

This was awesome!  I used eye of round steak and was worried that the meat might be tough but the sandwiches were great.  Really I think any steak you like would work with this.  The dressing is what really makes the meal.

I've made this sandwich several weeks ago and I'm making it again tonight.  The first time I made this, I added a slice of tomato.  But tonight, I think I'm going to add cremini mushrooms and banana peppers to this.  This sandwich is just FANTASTIC!!!!

Wow! That was way too garlic-y. No thank you. 10 minutes was a bit long for that thin meat too. Definitely searching for another steak sandwich.

This sandwich was AWESOME!  The garlic mayo spread makes the whole thing, so don't get stingy when spreading it on!  I used roast beef from the deli, instead and still LOVED it.  I will be making this as a regular meal in our house!

Not usually a big steak sandwich fan, everytime I have made something like this the steak came out tough, but this was AMAZING!!!!  The garlic mayo/parm. cheese combined with the steak was sooo yummy.  I didn't have the right cheese so I used a shredded cheddar jack cheese, still really good :)

This was awesome! I am sensitive to fresh, uncooked garlic so I sauteed it with the onions, added green peppers & fresh mushrooms in the sautee and set aside.  Then I cooked the steak (I used thin sirloin) in the same pan used for my sauteed veggies.  I did add a bit more salt to the meat as I was cooking it.  It was absolutely delish and my whole family enjoyed every bite.  Will definitely make this one again.

Awesome! I used sirloin since I had it on hand and omitted the liquid smoke since I had none. My hubby absolutely loved these and asked me to make them at least once a month! The leftovers were even yummy the next day eaten cold! I can’t say enough good about this recipe. I’m so glad I found another great use for steak.

My teenage son really loved this.  I only used one small clove of garlic in the mayonnaise instead of three, and it was still pretty strong.  I also thought that toasting the bun first, and then essentially toasting it again when melting the cheese, was too much and the buns got too hard.  When I made the second round of sandwiches, the bread just toasted when the cheese was melting and it turned out great.  Finally, instead of round steak, I just picked up some thinly sliced sandwich steak from my butcher and it worked out great.  All in all a delicious sandwich, and I think the previous reviewers were correct in saying that the mayonnaise really made it.

This recipe was so delicious!! We didn't use the liquid smoke and opted for an aged parm and it was perfect. We tried using steak and it was too tough and you were pulling the meat out of the sandwich. Instead, we were able to buy a roast at the meat counter, get it super thin sliced and the meat was tender and perfect after a few minutes of cooking. This is now a family favorite! :)

Ive been craving a steak sandwich for days now, and after searching and reading a few reviews, decided to go with this one. It blew me away, the garlic mayo was fantastic with the crunch of the bread, and the provolone melted nicely over the tender steak. I'll definitely be saving this one for future use.

A delicious sandwich, made even better with homemade 'Ciabatta Bread' from AR.  Not a huge fan of round steak, I had a package in the freezer that needed to be used.  I'm glad I tried it on this recipe as it was very well received.  I really liked the mayonnaise spread that was added to this.  My hubby liked the chewiness the bread added to the overall taste.  I made this as written and added a slice of tomato before serving.  A really good sandwich that I will be making again.

Very nice sandwich.  I "cheated" and used deli roast beef that I had sliced a little thicker than usual.  I also sautéed a green pepper along with the onion.  The garlic/parm mayo is a very nice addition!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, fotoe!78!

excellent, I used rib-eye, didn't have bun so served open faced on a toast slice, used garlic salt instead of cloves as we don't like much garlic. I used harvati cheese, great!

Delicious! I used thin sliced top sirloin instead of round steak, and reduced the garlic in the mayo.

Delicious -was looking for a good steak sandwich recipe for round steak. Also added mushrooms to the onions and steak. Wrapped the sandwiches in foil when I placed back in the oven to make sure I didn't lose any of the delicious goodness going on in the sandwich. You must try this sandwich. YUM!

OMG yummy!!! The garlic mayo was sooooo good!! Although my hubby isn't a fan of mayo on his steak & cheese so he wasn't a fan & thought the garlic was a bit much. I however loved it! The only change I made was to put the Italian seasoning in with the meat as it was cooking instead of on the sandwich afterwards (sounded kinda funky to me to add on top) Other than that, great!!!

This is definitely a sandwich you have to put it all "together" before you judge it. When I tasted the meat by itself, I thought this would be a boring sandwich....but, when you taste the finished product, it is really quite good. My daughter gave it 5 stars, hubby 4 stars....a keeper for sure.

The other reviews were right-they mayonnaise is fantastic!  I think it would be great with muschrooms, but unfortunately, my children did not.  The sandwiches were delicious.  Thank you!

This is delicious!! I make steak sandwiches with spinach but was looking to see if there was anything different to do with steak sandwiches. It's the mayo and the seasoning of the steak and onions that make this so delicious!  This will be a regular with my three teenagers!

What a great way to throw together a quick meal.  It couldn't  have been easier. All I had on hand was tortillas so scooped it into those with the sauce and before I knew it the pan was empty!  It will be a regular from now on.

The mayo spread used with this recipe is wonderful! I will use it over and over again on turkey, chicken or roast beef sandwiches. It is so simple and flavorful. My husband really liked it too. I altered the recipe using what I had on hand... I substituted Deli Roast Beef for the steak and marinated it in a garlic and black peppercorn marinade. I then warmed it in a skillet with onions until they were tender. The garlic and peppercorn gave it a steak-like flavor. I think you could substitute all kinds of meats and marinades and this recipe could come out great every time.

Five stars for the taste.  Like others have said, the garlic mayo makes this sammy!  I did use more worsteshire than called for as well as added some fresh ground black pepper. Left out liquid smoke. Next time, I believe I will do the onions (and mushrooms) separately.  I think they needed longer than the steak did.  Also, I know very little about cuts of meat, I found "top round" steak that was thin, so I used that.  Kid asked me to make again!

I enjoyed the seasoning used on the steak. I made my own rolls and used a family-size sirloin steak marinated in the seasonings here. Grilled to medium, sliced thin, then put on rolls with the onions and the garlic parm mayo and cheese.

Yum!  This was delicious.  My husband loved it.  I sprinkled the steak with seasoned salt, black pepper, and granulated garlic and left out the liquid smoke.  I probably used triple the amount of worcestershire.  I also added sautéed red and green bell peppers in addition to the onions.

I have made this a few times and it’s a hit with the family. I use whatever steak I find on sale. This top I used sirloin tip steaks and it was delicious.

Yum!  Good and garlicky. The hard rolls were nice and light and crispy. Everyone loved it. Next time I’ll cook the meat in two batches. Too crowded in the pan and steamed the meat instead of browning and created a bunch of liquid I drained off. Then I added a cup of beef broth and more salt and Worcestershire. The meat didn’t have a ton of flavor by itself but the mayo and Italian seasoning flavored it well.

I used left-over rib eye roast, which turned out to be a BIG mistake because my four young teenage males fought over the limited helpings!  The only other thing that I did differently was to add the Worcestershire sauce directly into the mayonnaise mixture.  I'm making them again tomorrow for our Friday night dinner with LOTS more beef and onion.   You should have seen how the eyes of my young ones lit up in joy when I told them!

Good sandwich but not the ultimate steak sandwich I was expecting.  I think this would be better with some au jus and/or with marinating the steak.  We won't make this again - we'll continue to look for another steak sandwich.

Flavor was great, we love garlic and the sauce does make the sandwich. We like peppers so I also added some red and green peppers to it.

This was seriously good. I made it as directed, but used a really good cut of Angus flank steak and sliced it thin. Fantastic sandwich. No need to change it! My boys loved it too. That speaks volumes.

It was OK.  Like others have said if you look at the picture other things have been added.  I think it at least needed some grilled green peppers.

Key to thin sliced is partially freezing the meat, and a real slicer.  Been making similar to for yrs as I've traveled east to west....now the amoroso rolls are the other ticket

It was very yummy! I added a red bell pepper to the steak mix, but other than that, I stuck to the recipe. The Mayo was simply delicious. Will make again. Thank u for sharing this recipe.

The best quality meat you can find, the better.  I roasted the garlic in the bulb...sliced off the top, drizzled olive oil on top of bulb then put in preheated 400 degree oven for 30-35 minutes.  Let it cool for 15 minutes then squeezed out the garlic after it cooled a bit (cool longer if you need or put in fridge for 15 min) add more garlic than recipe calls for, it's yummy by itself.  I didn't add liquid smoke too.

Slice it deli thickness if you have a slicer like I do.  Otherwise but deli beef or pound it thin.  Pictures shows tomato  on sandwich.  Not on list  of add-ons.  Great and easy.  Use Steakum if desperate.

Minute steaks the ultimate. Please. Maybe roast beef, or better stills thinly sliced top sirloin or similar. Then it might be an ultimate, or at least a good one.

I am not a huge fan of raw garlic, but love the more mellow flavor of roasted garlic.  I also fry the onion then flash fry the steak to prevent it becoming tough.  Great sandwich!

Holy cow this is good! Delish!! Don't change a thing!! The entire family ate this. 5 and 7 year old included. I eat a paleo life style so I didn't do the bread. I splurged on the cheese and mayo. Soooo good!

I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because if you follow the directions, you will burn the heck out of your sandwich tops. Which I did. Turn the oven off and let the cheese melt, but keep an eye on it. Otherwise, I think this is a great recipe.

Followed the recipe but seasoned my steak and seared it.  Used Garlic & Sea Salt, Lemon Pepper and a little olive oil.  The provolone cheese makes it extra special!  LOVED THIS SAMMI!
