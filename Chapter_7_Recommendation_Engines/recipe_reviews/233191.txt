Definitely has a good kick from the tomatillo sauce, but this is a fantastic salsa with a perfect creamy texture.  We enjoyed it as much as a fresh veggie dip as we did with tortilla chips.  And my next batch of fish tacos definitely will be topped with this.  Four ingredients into the blender, and in less than 5 minutes, you'll have a salsa/dip that'll WOW folks.  Loved it!

When I saw this recipe posted on the main page, I was so intrigued that I went to the store, bought the ingredients and made it that night. It took me a few minutes to find the cooking sauce because I was just overlooking it among all of the salsas, but I eventually found it in the Hispanic foods section in Safeway.  I thought it was really good, and very easy to prepare. It had a very small bit of spiciness to it, and I knew my husband liked a bit more of a kick, so I added a touch of cayenne pepper to it.  I made tostadas, and poured the sauce over the top.  So good.  Honestly, I thought my husband would rave over it a bit more than he actually did, but he did mention that he liked it.  We have a lot of it left over, so I'm going to use the rest as a dip.

This recipe is perfect as is! Very quick dip to put together and presents nicely for when guests stop by. We dipped veggies, pretzels, and crackers and all worked well with it! I cant wait to add as a sauce for grilled chicken or tacos!

I could only find jarred and canned Herdez® Salsa Verde, so I bought the jar Verde salsa to make this dip. It isn't hot and a very nice flavor,  for those that don't like heat. I'm still on the search for the cooking sauces since I do like heat. This was delicious as a dip, and would make a terrific sauce for fish tacos, or even a taco salad.

I think I'm a wimp: This is very spicy to me. It's GOOD, but like . . . I don't want to sit down and eat a ton of it as it's written. About 2/3 the Herdez plus a few drops of lime juice are in order the next time I make this. :)

First, I have to admit I hate cilantro. I can’t tolerate the stuff.  To me, it tastes like soap.  Therefore, whenever a recipe asks for cilantro, I use parsley and that works out just fine.  Secondly, I couldn’t find the HERDEZ® Tomatilla Verde Mexican Cooking Sauce, but I did find the Traditional Chipotle, so I used that.  Please keep in mind that the HERDEZ® Mexican Cooking Sauces have a kick, so if you’re not used to jazz, taste as you go.  I added a lot less Mexican cooking sauce than requested in the recipe.   Lastly, to my dismay, when I went to get the Greek Yogurt, it was gone, so I used sour cream.  So despite all this, it still turned out fabulous.  This is a great recipe that makes a very tasty dip with very little effort and can be easily adjusted to suit your tastes.

This is a wonderful 4 ingredient salsa, and I’m so glad I found this recipe.  This took me 5 minutes to put together.  It took me longer than that to take apart the blender and wash and dry it!  I made this up in the morning and served it mid-afternoon.  Loved the thickness and texture of this salsa.  We not only enjoyed it on tortilla chips, but fresh veggies as well.  It would make a great addition to most Mexican dishes.  For those have problems finding the HERDEZ® Tomatilla Verde Mexican Cooking Sauce, I found it at our Kroger™ store for $2.59 a jar.  It was located on the top shelf with the Mexican food items.  Great salsa that I will be making again.

Absolutely perfect. This Creamy Tomatillo Avocado Salsa is great as a dip and can be used as a topping for tacos, taco salads, enchiladas or any other Mexican recipe. I'm even going to try this on a burger. This delivered just the right amount of spicy heat for me. It took me longer to wash off and spin dry the cilantro than it did to make this recipe. The Greek yogurt works well and no doubt sour cream would work as well. This will be my go to dip and topping. I'm going to stock up on the Herdez Tomatillo Verde Cooking Sauce for this one. What a great recipe Valerie!

Okay....Valerie, I'm a wuss ;-) I forgot how spicy the HERDEZ cooking sauces are. And no one could eat it as written. However, I loved the flavor it was just to darn hot. But because I was serving it to my kids, I needed to adjust the heat in it. I basically had to increase the avocado & Greek yogurt by 4 times what the original recipe stated but left the cooking sauce and cilantro the as is. Still had a great amount of heat without hurting my little ones and everyone enjoyed it but hubby. He wouldn't try it because of the avocados, but for me, making it the way I did, will be a keeper. And it still had it's creamy texture. I'm just glad this recipe is soo easy when it comes to evening the heat without losing the flavor. So it's a win win for the whimpiest heat seekers to the atomic bomb dropping eaters

Ooh spicy! I really hate avocados but I really enjoyed this. My avocados were tiny so I used 2. Very creamy and tasty. My boys loved this with chips. :) Also I misread the recipe and used a cup of the yogurt :/ But it was still delicious. Thanks!

Fabulous!  We ate this in lieu of our normal salsa & sour cream with my Farmer's Market Vegetarian Quesadillas, and my family LOVED it. I added a bit more Greek yogurt but will definitely make this again.  So, so good!  Thanks, Valerie!

Wow.  This is definitely a 5-star dish!  I now know what I will bring to parties from now on.  This dip was excellent and so easy to make!  I started out with 1/2 a bottle of the Herdez tomatilla Verde sauce and kept it that way because it was perfect for us.  The only problem was I have to stop myself from eating all of it.  Thanks Valerie for a fantastic dip.

This recipe was an awesome twist on a traditional guac.  Being from New Mexico, you'd think I'd be used to spicy stuff, but on the contrary, I am a spice wimp.  Using the ingredients, but at different amounts, I'm not going to confess how little sauce I used and how much avocado and greek yogurt, but suffice to say I liked it, and my wimpy family loved it as well (Hubby would have prob liked it spicer, but he is always out voted when it comes to the amount of spice we use on things in this house).  We ate it on shrimp tacos, and it was a huge hit.  There's lots left over, and I'm sure it will be yummy on chips or veggies, or whatever else we find to dip it in.

I couldn't. Find the tomatillo cooking sauce so I used Herdez jarred Salsa Verde and used about 8 oz.  this is a perfect balance between creamy and spicy.  I used it as a condiment with shrimp.  Well done, Valerie.  We all enjoyed this.

DELICIOUS! I did only use about 8oz. of the tomatillo sauce b/c I wanted it to be more on the thicker/creamier side, and sour cream in place of the greek yogurt b/c I accidentally bought that instead (I could've sworn it said sour cream, lol). Great flavor and nice spicy kick. I really loved the creaminess that the avocado added. This would go great w/ just about anything...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Valerie, I don't have to buy my avocado salsa any more! Thank you so much! It's delicious and so fresh tasting! We like it a bit spicier so I added a tablespoon of chopped pickled jalapeno. Can't wait to try it on fish tacos!

I was looking for a basic recipe that wasn't too involved (ie; roasting etc). I also had a partial can of green enchilada sauce I didn't want to waste, so I used that and added some salsa verde to give me the 12oz,. Used sour cream instead of greek yogurt and half cilantro and half parsley. Delicious!!

Excellent!  Easy!  No changes.  We didn't find it spicy at all, but we live in Texas, so we are used to pretty spicy food. This will be a HUGE hit at our parties.  Talk about a low stress appetizer people will talk about!

Considering I don't like avocado, I actually really liked this. I can use it as a sauce and I made enough that I put some in the fridge and will be trying it on some fish or shrimp tacos!

This salsa can be used for so many things.  Great with tortilla chips, dipping sauce for quesadillas, drizzle on grilled shrimp or drizzle a little on some fresh cut tomatoes.  I did cut the amount of Herdez sauce in half.

This is a very flavorful dip or sauce.  I am not a fan of cilantro but it didn't bother me in this recipe.  It would be great thinned out and used as a sauce on fish tacos.

Served this at a pot luck...everyone loved this dip!  The only complaint (if you can call it that) was from one person who said it was bit too spicy, but then admitted that they normally don't eat spicy food.  I followed the recipe exactly and used a blender to mix it all together.

I love this dip. It's very fresh and light tasting and super easy to make. I don't like a lot of heat, so I used only 1/2 of the jar of cooking sauce. I also used less cilantro but didn't measure. This is an easy recipe to tailor to one's own taste. I served it with Roasted Garlic and Black Bean Artisan Tostadas.

This was very enjoyable. For our family, it wasn't very hot at all! Even my one year old loved it. It would be a great dip or dressing. I could see this very easily on tacos! It is a crowd pleaser for sure!

OK, so I didn't follow the recipe exactly...I used sour cream, not yogurt (already had sour cream in the fridge), and I added the sauce in increments so it wouldn't be too spicy for me and wound up using about half the jar.  My husband and father-in-law really enjoyed this!  Nice change over the usual guacamole.
