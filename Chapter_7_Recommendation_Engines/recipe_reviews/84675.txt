this was PHENOMENAL!!!!  I just dumped all the ingredients in a big plastic bag and marinated the salmon 6 hours and it was SOOOO delicious!!!  very fresh, rich tasting.  I added the juice of 2 limes instead of lemon and added about 2 tsps of chili pepper.  I used regular balsamic instead of white and it still all came out fabulous!  I grilled mine in a pan and cooked the remaining marinade in a small sauce pan until it boiled and added a little cornstarch to thicken it- truly made the dish!

This dish is so delicious!!! I love salmon, and this is one of the best recipes. I have to say it is great broiled, but it is simply wonderful on the grill. I marinated the whole fillet with the skin and put it on some foil and it was great.***Update***I used some leftovers to make salmon patties & it was out of this world! Simply mix with seasoned bread crumbs, beaten egg, diced onion, green peppers, spices & brown in the skillet. Excellent!

This was good, I really enjoyed the cilantro flavor.  We had it with grilled asparagus, grilled orange peppers, and some garlic bread.

Best salmon I have ever eaten.  The only changes I made were to omit the red pepper flakes and substitute white wine vinegar for the white balsamic (couldn't find it).

Also, I cooked mine on the grill.  I highly recommend it.

It was easy to make! and the dish was delicious! I added extra cilantro and green onions, used 1 tbsp red wine vinegar, and half the amount of white balsamic vinegar. I don't have a broiler, so I just baked the salmon uncovered on 450 for about 17 minutes. I marinated for only 2 hours and it still was fantastic!

This was an excellent flavor for Salmon!  I followed exactly - my demise though was it was over cooked.  I think the total cooking time is 10 min, but was unsure the way it was written.  I cooked for 15...too much :(  Still a great recipe though!  Thanks!

Great recipe. Tastes awsome on the grill. The only thing i left out was the cilantro and it was still delicious! I always use this marinade for salmon now when bbq'ing.

I recently got married and have been trying out new recipes on my husband, and he LOVED this one! He ate so much of it that when we went to the gym later on he felt sick. But never regretted eating the yummy salmon. It was very moist, flavorful, and easy to prepare. The only disappointing part about it was that it has to marinate for so long, because once you smell it you want to eat it right away!

YUM! This recipe is effortless and can be done within minutes.  Great last minute fix! (though the suggested marinating time is ideal) Healthy and satisfying =)

Really enjoyed this dish!  It had a slight sweet flavor to it that was unique.  I added feta cheese to the top of it after taking it out of the oven which I thought was a nice addition.

This was a great recipe!  I don't use sugar so I added honey instead and used regular Balsamic Vinegar instead White as I didn't have any.  I marinated for about 4 hours and used Wild Salmon, I won't buy Farm Raised.  Yummy!  Give it a try :)

This was delicious!  I substituted basil for the cilantro, and only marinated for about a half hour before grilling.

This recipe is really flavorful and light, however I am only giving 4 stars because if left in the marinade for too long (6 hours-overnight) the lemon can cook the fish and then it will be overcooked.  I marinaded mine for 2-3 hours and the cilantro really came through!!  I followed the recipe except used cayenne instead of pepper flakes cause I didn't have them.  I also didn't have the green onions so I may have used more garlic. I could have used less vinegar, but it came out tasty! I also used double the cilantro.

Loved this! I put the green onions, cilantro and garlic in the food processor before adding to the marinade. I replaced the red pepper flakes with paprika. While grilling on the BBQ I put the marinade in a saucepan and brought it to a low boil and then let it simmer for a few minutes. We lightly drizzled the marinade over the salmon to serve. It was fabulous!

This was pretty good - I would probably omit the sugar next time, or maybe just use a tsp or so of brown sugar or maybe even honey, as the salmon definitely had a sweetness that I didn't like.  The white balsamic, garlic and cilantro flavors came across beautifully - mild but detectable - and the only other change I'll make next time is to up the spice factor, maybe use a chopped fresh chili or two so the oils permeate the marinade a bit more.  Otherwise, a great recipe!

I'm only going to be repeating what others have said, but this recipe was absolutely DELICIOUS.  My husband and I eat fish at least once a week, and this has been my favorite marinade so far.  I was only able to marinade it for 15-20 minutes, but kept spooning the marinade over the fish as I was getting together the rest of the meal.  I used honey instead of sugar, dried chives instead of the green onion and brushed just a little more marinade on when I turned the fish.  Fantastic!

This salmon recipe is AMAMZING!  I have never felt inclined to rate a recipe; however, I felt I needed to give it the 5 stars it deserves.  My husband said this recipe is company worthy and wanted to know when I would be making it next.  The kids loved it too!  The combination of cilantro and red pepper flakes is perfect.  Yummy!!!

The best salmon ever! We grilled ours on cedar paper that we found at the grocery store. The fish was just the right amount of spicy and the cooking time was right on. I will serve this to all my guests. Oh, be sure to use wild salmon- tastes much better.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have white balsamic vinegar, so I substituted it with 1 tbs regular balsamic vinegar and 1 tbs white wine vinegar.  I also used sushi grade salmon and cooked it so that it was slightly rare on the inside (I live in Japan, so the salmon is super fresh here).  I served it with a side of guacamole, yellow rice, and broccoli florets.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is my first ever review but this recipe was so awesome I had to post something!  I followed the recipe exactly except for using 1 tbl instead of 2 tbl of sugar.  It was so moist, tender, and well seasoned!!  Just perfect.  Will definitely use this one again and again!!!!

This was great except for the cook time for us. The marinade was wonderful and I even forgot to add the sugar. I followed the cook time as directed but pulled it out after 2 mins at 500. It was already well done at that point. Next time I would probably just check it after the initial cook time. We prefer our salmon med rare. Just watch the cook time according to preference. Served with steamed cauliflower tossed with harissa oil and cilantro and brown rice made with a little cumin. Next time I will try grilling it and maybe serve it with a moroccan carrot salad. Update: made this again and served it with the cucumber carrot salad also from this site.

This is a difficult one to rate. I think if you "tweak" the amount of cilantro and red pepper to your taste, it would be a 5 star. With my family, as written, it was a 3-4, which means tasty.  I followed the recipe but marinated in a plastic bag instead of baking dish. I also baked at 450 for 20 minutes rather than broiling since broiling causes major smoke with my stove :-( I boiled the marinade for my husband since he likes spicy. He loved the marinade poured over his salmon. It is worth a try, just tweak to your taste.

The only changes I made to this were to use dark balsamic vinegar and I didn't use the green onions.  I grilled this and since we're just learning how to grill it ended up dry and tasted mostly of smoke.  I want to try this again because I believe it could be delicious!

Excellent flavor, I initially used regular aged balsamic vinegar. It tasted great, but I bought some of the white balsamic , and it is wonderful. This is the only way I do my salmon, I like the fresh taste of the marinade, I also reserve some for a sauce.

Fabulous!  I changed the vinegar to plain balsemic as someone had suggested and also  changed the red pepper flakes to cayenne pepper.  I took out all onion.  This is a really wonderful recipe to plank grill.

Agree with others who say "unique flavor." Even though i marinated for about 8 hours, it wasn't super strong. Will try reserved marinade for sauce next time - it turned out a little dry. Will make again, though!

Only changes we made were to use apple cider vinegar and honey instead of sugar.  REALLY great way to make salmon.

Made some changes due to items on hand and personal preference:
 1 T garlic powder instead of fresh (I know, who runs out of garlic?!)
 3 T fresh basil and one 1 T fresh parsley (chopped) instead of cilantro
Doubled the green onions since I had some to get rid of.
Marinated over night in a gallon ziploc bag, approx. 28 hours.
Grilled on a cedar plank.
It was fabulous. My picky partner who says "don't add anything to fish" raved about it.
Thank you for the great base recipe!

Bomb.com!! I marinated the salmon for about six hours and then pan seared it. Everyone loved it - said it was restaurant quality. Great recipe!! Oh, I didn't have 'white balsamic vinegar', so I just used the regular stuff and it was delish!!

I found this recipe too close to dinnertime, so I only marinated it for about an hour, but it was still extremely delicious and flavorful.  I will definitely make this again and actually marinate it for the full time.

This was quite good but I found the balsamic taste a little over powering.  I did use regular balsamic instead of white...not sure if that was the problem.

I didn't care for this, it was too sweet and spicy, the rest of the flavors were overpowered by the sugar and red pepper flakes.

I used frozen salmon fillets, and the cooking time had to be extended a bit.  Tasty dish!  I left the green chunks from the marinade on the fillets and baked it along with the salmon.  I ate it all, and my husband scraped it off & only ate the meat.  Either way, very good!

Fantastic! We love fish and had tired of the same old salmon recipes. I followed the recipe(though I doubled it), and it was perfect! Just add to marinade before work and grill when you get home. Really simple and delicious.

I'm generally not a huge fan of salmon but my husband made this recipe for me and it was awesome.  All the flavors together are excellent.  We've been making this over and over for the past year.

I'm sorry to say I thought this was rather disappointing.  My boyfriend said that you couldn't even taste the marinade; it just tasted like salmon.  It didn't have a very appealing presentation either.  It wasn't bad just...not at all worth marinating for so long.  I've had much, much better salmon minus all the prep time and marinating.  Thank you anyway.

I never liked salmon before this recipe.  Most of the time I don’t have cilantro or green onions on hand so I don’t use them if I don’t, and it still turns out really well.

Amazing. Do season first, and marinate after. All the flavours come thru. The cilantro is not overpowering and the red pepper flakes are perfect. Depending on the size of your fish, be careful how long you marinate. You don't want to cook it with the lemon. I grilled individual pieces with a fish rack that allows you to turn them all together. Perfect.

Delicious! Very flavorful - not for those who enjoy bland foods. I loved the garlic and cilantro! Also, this was super easy as I did all the prep work beforehand. I served it with a tossed basil salad and warm french bread - the salmon is so seasoned and flavorful that I would go for more mild, basic side dishes. I made it for the three of us 20-something girls and we all loved it!

Positively great! I instead white balsamic I used fig  balsamic, no green onions, and rosemary instead of cilantro . Also used  a regular  pan to cook it in. Turned out beautiful! Made it for the family and even the picky eater ate it all! This is now a go to for me, you can change it up or make it as is and it is great.

I didn't salt & pepper the salmon, I did rub it with the onion and red pepper flakes though.

I didn't have time to marinate (and to be honest I dislike marinating salmon), so I mixed up the "marinade" (but replaced the lemon juice with white vinegar, used regular balsamic instead of white, Splenda for baking instead of sugar and a dash more of onion powder instead of green onions).

Then I heated the marinade on medium high heat in a ceramic skillet, tossed the salmon skin up in the bubbling marinade for 7 minutes, then flipped it for five minutes more - it was quick with a crispy skin and the cilantro and Splenda caramalized it!

Of note, I do have a gas stove.

Bomb!  We loved it, as others did not have white balsamic vinegar used the red. Served it with apparatus and the lemon roasted potatoes recipe on this site. Which by the way was also a very big hit. In reading the other reviews it does have a sweeter taste due to the balsamic vinegar and a little bit of sugar.  If you're not too big on the sweet I would just reduce these by half . Also  heated the marinade to serve on top of the salmon and finished it off by topping with sliced avocados.

We were really divided on this tonight - it seems we either loved it or hated it (split equally).  I followed the recipe  ingredients exactly, but grilled it instead of baking.  For those that didn't like it, the flavors didn't blend together and it just tasted weird.   Those that liked it, liked the play of vinegar and cilantro.  I won't bother making again unless it is requested.

Loved it. Made it for my family and can't wait to make it again! :)
The only thing we changed is, instead of using what the recipe called for, we used dark balsamic vinegar. It was a big hit and note: You can use the marinade on other meats like chicken!!  - ZBT

No one in my family likes salmon but I'm always on the lookout for recipes because it's so healthful.  I loved this, my husband liked it, and my two kids ate it without complaint.  SUCCESS!  Will definitely add this to my regular rotation!

This tasted like something I would have ordered in a restaurant, DELICIOUS! The only thing I did different was use white wine vinegar and one lemon and it's zest (what I had). Put everything into a freezer bag, marinated for 6 hours, very simple. I BBQ mine on foil brushed with olive oil, and it came out perfect. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

This wasn't bad, but I just don't know if the taste was for me.  I felt like the marinade completely masked the taste of the salmon.  It's not that it was bad, it was just very strong.  I'm not sure if I would make again for that reason, but I'm keeping the recipe.  I may make again with less marinade or less marinating time (I did overnight).

The best! I've made this several times and refuse to make my salmon with any other marinade. Delicious flavors without over powering the salmon. I substitute parsley for cilantro because my husband is not a big fan but that is the only change I make. I recommend this marinade to all of my friends and family.

This was such a great marinade!! I made this with swordfish since my hubby & I are not really into salmon. It was absolutley delishes! It looked & tasted resturant good! This will definatley be a recipe I will me making often. And as one other reviewer mentioned the only bad thing about this was waiting for it to marinade cause its soo true as soon as you smell it you want to eat it!!! Great recipe thanks so much!!

Fabulous!  The salmon had a nice light tanginess to it!  I omitted the green onion and cilantro because I did not have any.  I added ½ t. parsley, ½ t. basil, extra garlic, and used red balsamic vinegar instead of white.  I scaled the recipe for two salmon fillets, but after making the marinade with the scaled amounts, I realized I wanted more marinade.  While making the second batch of marinade I grabbed the wrong bottle and ended up adding malt vinegar instead of red wine vinegar!  The recipe still came out great despite my mistake!  I’ve never made the recipe before, so I’m not sure if the malt vinegar added to the taste or if I had enough red wine vinegar in the mix to counteract any negative taste the malt vinegar may have imparted!  I will make it again, this time using the correct vinegar, and see which way I prefer!  I wrapped each salmon fillet in aluminum foil and the fish came out incredibly moist.  I served the dish with rice and an Italian vegetable mix.  Incredibly easy and just as good!

This recipe is very good, it has a unique flavour. Like another user said, I used regular balsamic vinegar instead of white, only because I didn't have white at home. I also crushed some onion flakes instead of using onion powder. I used 2 tspn crushed chili pepper and omitted the green onions (didn't have any).  I followed another user's advice and used the left over marinade as a sauce by boiling the marinade and adding a tspn of cornstarch.

I mixed all the ingredients (did not do the rub step, just added to the marinade) and marinated the fish for 24 hours.  I grilled instead of broiled.  A keeper for sure.  Would be great on tilapia or grouper too.

This recipe is one of my families favorites. It's simple and has tons of flavor. We were getting in a rut when it came to making salmon, but this was a pleasant surprise to the mouth.
