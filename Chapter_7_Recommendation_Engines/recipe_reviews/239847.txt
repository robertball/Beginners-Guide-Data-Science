While this was good, I didn't find it had that rich decadent flavor to make it worth the high calorie vs low nutrient investment.  I'm lazy, so I used steam in the bag broccoli and cauliflower and nuked for only 2:40 to keep them al dente (from this point, I followed directions).  I had a hunk of fresh Romano, so I used them in place of parmesan.  There was also no baking time (that I could find), so i baked at 400 because that's what I was baking another side dish at.  I baked for about 30 minutes and broiled at the end to brown the bread crumbs/cheese.  THANKS for the recipe!

I make broccoli multiple times a week, so I used 1 1/2 pounds of cauliflower instead.  I followed another reviewer and did NOT precook the cauliflower, as I prefer my veg with texture.  I'm used to even measures of butter and flour when I make a roux, so instead of 2 tablespoons of flour, I upped it to to 4 to evenly match the 1/4 cup of butter. I had cream to use up, so I used that with a little milk to make it fully 1 1/4 cups.  I followed other reviewers (thank you!) and cooked the casserole at 400 for 25 minutes covered and 25 minutes uncovered.  This is the first vegetable casserole recipe I made that did NOT include cream-of-something soup.  It's a keeper!  Thank you MikeP!****FORGOT TO MENTION****I shredded the cheeses myself instead of buying pre-shredded cheese for maximum cheesiness.

Was great, used cornstarch instead of flour as I had none. Baked it at 400 for 30 min as the other reviewer said. Very cheesy.

Using what I had on hand I used cream instead of half & half.  I did not cook the veggies prior, just added an additional 20 minutes to baking time.   I also added a finely chopped onion.  Turned out great, veggies cooked but not mushy.  My family loved it!

Soooo good! Good riddance to the tired old green bean casserole. This is hugely better. I always over buy at the farmer's market, especially this time of year -winter is coming,  so looked for a good recipe to use both broccoli and cauliflower. This is it. I cooked the veg in the microwave. Added a little dijon to the egg mix. Used Pepperidge farm herb dressing (it was in the freezer) instead of croutons and forgot the butter. I did cover the dish with foil for the first 20 mins. Uncovered it then added some olive oil to the dry dressing and it came out perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. Enjoy.

So glad you don't use canned soup! Added sauteed garlic & onion and served with brown rice.

It was a little too mushy for my tastes. I think just blanching will be better. I also would reduce the cooking time.

I made half the sauce bkz  I only had cauliflower.  I used milk in place of the half/half which was fine.  I microwaved the caulifl. first but that just made it too soft after the oven bake.

I have never rated on this site before because most recipes are very good. This one was not it was bland. I love cauliflower but it tasted horrible in this recipe. We threw most of it out. I won't make it again.
