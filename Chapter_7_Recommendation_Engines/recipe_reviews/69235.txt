So yummy! I made the following changes and they are the perfect consistency.  I used honey in place of the corn syrup.  I used 1/4 cup raisins, 1/8 cup chopped pecans, 1/8 cup coconut in place of the 1/2 cup raisins.  I added 4 tablespoons ground flax for health.  I used old fashioned oats in place of quick and I added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon for flavor.  I followed the recipe for everything else.  These are better than any store bought granola bar for sure!  Make sure you spend enough time mixing the mixture so that it is evenly coated.  I thought I might have the crumbly problem at first but I just kept mixing and they came out perfect!

I made these for the first time in March 2005 and followed the recipe except for the vanilla extract.  They were quite yummy, although a bit crumbly as others mentioned and could have been a bit more flavorful.  I really liked how not messy they are to make, too.  I just made these again this week, except used honey instead of corn syrup, made  a bit more of the sugar concoction  and used those Florida Natural fruit snacks instead of raisins.    Prepared this way, the granola bars hold their shape quite well and taste  fantastic.  My boyfriend almost died when he had the first bite and I suspect I'll be making them weekly now.  Update 7/07: I use this recipe more than any other recipe EVER!  I guess we like things sweet, but I always use 2/3 cup brown sugar, 2/3 cup honey and 2/3 cup peanut butter.  Perfect for us. I also just dump the mixture onto a cutting board after getting it all mixed up and shape it into a square with my hands, let it set, cut them up and individually wrap in foil. I've tried lots of dried fruits in them and they're all great, usually use cranberries.  I'm going to try adding cinnamon next time!  THANKS!

HELPFUL TIPS AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS: I found it easier to use my hands and not a spoon to flatten and pack together in a pan.  Honey makes all the difference instead of the oil.  Then I placed it in the fridge for an hour, cut in squares, and placed each one in plastic wrap for easy grabbing.  Store at room temperature as they get dry/not chewy if left in the fridge.  I can't believe how good these are.  I do agree with the poster who used 2/3 C of everything (raisins, brown sugar, honey, pb) instead of 1/2 C.  Makes a huge difference!!!!  I also sprinkled some pecan pieces (NOT crushed, just chopped a tad) OR sliced almonds ...about 1/4 - 1/3 a cup, & it was the perfect combination!  I used a bag of raisin/cranberry mix instead of JUST raisins.  You can really make this colorful w/your choice of fruits for the holiday season!  I don't allow my kids to have chocolate, but I can easily see why others insert m&m's in these. Just be sure to add them last so they don't melt!

This recipe is delicious...with a few changes. Here is what I did to make it more healthy:
1. Eliminate corn syrup and add 1/2 cup water with 1 Tb honey. 
2. Used whole oats--but soak it in just enough hot water to soften it up (but don't add so much that it becomes watery)
3. Original recipe was a bit too sweet, so I used slightly less than 1/2c brown sugar on my next batch.
4. Use wheat puffs instead of rice.
5. Add 2 Tb. flax.
6. Use around 2/3 c lowfat peanut butter to make batch stickier and to eliminate any crumbliness.
7. Press finished batch firmly to hold it in place.
8. Add some pumpkin spice or cinnamon.
9. Use nuts or other fruits in place of raisins---be creative! I used soy nuts, pine nuts and baked pears---delicious!
...enjoy!

This is very good and very versatile. The binding ingredients are the corn syrup, sugar and peanut butter. If you look at the other recipes on this site, they are basically all the same. I used Special K because I couldn't find Rice Crispies. I also ran out of oats so I just topped it up with choc chip muesli. And instead of raisins, I put chopped almonds because my daughter doesn't like raisins. As others have done, I am going to try honey next time. 
Tip: if the mixture hardens while mixing, just put it in the microwave for 20 seconds and continue. It was not easy to mix. I lined the pan with a big piece of foil, filled in the mixture, folded the foil over and used my hand to press it down firmly and evenly. Therefore, I did not have sticky hands, a sticky pan or a crumbly mixture like others have experienced.

I wish there were more stars.  The great thing here is that you can substitute forever and still have a GREAT recipe.  I use cheerios instead of "crispy rice cereal" and I add some crushed up pretzels for a nice salty crunch.  I prefer craisins to raisins and I use almond butter (way expensive but healthy they and tastes great).  I usually gripe when reviewers give this many changes, but the point is, IT IS A GREAT RECIPE... SIMPLE, VERSATILE AND DELICIOUS.

Taste like a rice crispy bar!  I've made them 3 times in the last couple of days using M&Ms and chocolate chips instead of raisins and smooth peanut butter.  Fill the 1/2 cup 3/4s full of the light corn syrup and add a little honey to get to a full 1/2 cup - it helps the bar stick together better (don't use more or it turns out too sweet).  Also add a 1/4 tsp of salt - don't know why but it makes a world of difference in the taste in a good way.  Thank you so much for this easy delicious recipe.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I tweaked a bit of this recipe by using honey instead of corn syrup. I also used a full tablespoon of vanilla extract instead and since I'm not a big fan of raisins, I used cranberry trail mix instead. Personally after making this recipe many times, I found that adding about 1 tbsp of butter really helps. Delicious!

Okay I have made these three times in five days and my kids are asking me when I am making them again. AND, my DH has asked for them in his lunch. I guess everyone in my house loves them! These went together super fast and I like the cereal/oats combination and unlike alot of granola or granola bar recipes there isn't alot of sugar so they are healthier and less expensive to make. I made the first batch as directed, the second minus the raisins and pressed mini chocolate chips on top and in the third I replaced 1/2 cup of cereal with coconut and added finely chopped dried apricots. They were all very good. Thanks for the keeper!

These are so good and easy.  Everytime I make them someone asks me for the recipie.  

A lot of people said that they didn't stay together very well but i don't have that problem.  Of course you have to let them cool a little before you cut them just like any other bar.  Storing them never seems to be a problem becuase there are never any left.  I always add some cinnamaon to them, makes them extra good.  I have also made them with chocoalte and peanut butter chips instead of raisins.  Both are excellent.

Yum! Excellent! Instead of using 9x13 pan I pressed about 1/3 cup into muffin tins and then when cool just flipped over. Perfect size to throw in lunch boxes! Saved me having to cut into pieces!

When I first tried this I thought I would be giving it 1 star because it wasn't holding together at all.  You do have to give it time to set.   These were very good but they just wernt overly flavorful as prepared in the actual recipie.  I found adding cashews crushed, sunflower seeds, chocolate chips, and raisins helped a lot.

Good basic recipie.  First few bites arn't that great but they do grow on you. 

Make sure you cut them into small pieces not large bars, they hold together that way.  Also let them fully cool.  Make sure when you put it in the pan you press it firmly down and together, not just let it lay loose.

Fantastic recipe! I love recipes that allow you room to tweak it to your own liking without jeopardizing the final result; this is one of those recipes! I'm currently living overseas and don't have access to corn syrup (and found out afterwards how to make my own LOL) so I used maple syrup. I found that the amount called for wasn't enough to adequately mix in with all the cereal so next time I'll use just slightly more than 1/2 a cup. I also altered the recipe by using only 2 cups of rice crispies and 1/2 a cup of corn flakes. Along with the cereal changes, I used creamy peanut butter and then crushed lightly salted peanuts and added them to the mix. In place of raisins, I used plain M&M's. They turned out GREAT!!! What made this recipe even better was the fact that it's truly 100% family/kid friendly, allowing even the youngest of kids to help out. Oh, one last note, when I was mixing the brown sugar and maple syrup together on MH heat, I threw in about a handful of miniature marshmallows. It all mixed together perfectly and created a great bonding agent in the end. Definitely worth trying!

I'm giving this recipe a 5 star, not that I followed it completely but it was very good with the changes I did and thats only because I made this recipe with my cooking class of 10 small children at March Break Camp and its a peanut free environment.  So with that in mind I couldn't use the peanut butter so I use MOLASSAS (same measurements).  The kids also wanted to add chocolate chips and mini marshmellows so because the mixture was sticky enough, we just added them on top then pressed down on all of it in the pan...worked out great!  OMG...THE LITTLE MUNCHKINS LOVED THEM!  Next time I'll make them at home using the peanut butter.

Put plastic wrap in your pan, then fold it over the sticky mixture and press hard with your hands. Otherwise they are quite crumbly. Less mess too this way!

This was very good.  I was looking for something that wasn't too sweet.  I  subbed craisins for raisins.  I cut them up and wrapped in waxed paper to be able to take to work.

Wow, pleasantly surprised at how good these.  I made mine with 2/3 cups shredded coconut and 1 cup finely chopped dried apricots.  To compensate, I used 2/3 cups of corn syrup, brown sugar and peanut butter to make it stay moist and soft.  If made to a T, it's very good too.  I've tried white chocolate chips and craisins, butterscotch chips and crumbled Heath bars for a special dessert,rainbow sprinkles and dried fruits for a little girl's tea party - pretty much any combo you want.  Just make sure you increase the sugar mixture accordingly to preven a dry, crumbly bar.  And I spray my hands with Pam and mix with my hands.  Sooo much easier than using a spoon.  A super fun recipe to make with kids and makes a great school snack/party food.

Thanks for the great recipe.  It is excellent...and easy. No baking required.  I followed the recipe with a few changes:  I used only 1 cup oats, plus 1/4 cup wheat germ, 1/4 cup sunflower seeds, 1/4 cup sesame seeds, and 1/4 cup flax seeds.  I used honey in place of corn syrup and golden raisins.  They held together well and were delicious!  Next time I will use less sugar, as the honey adds more sweetness than corn syrup.

I made these almost exactly as is (just added 1/4 t salt and subbed chocolate chips for the raisins), made sure I mixed them a lot, and they turned out perfectly: didn't crumble at all!   Thank you for this recipe!!

Good.  I personally would add a little salt to the sugar mixture.  It just needed a little extra kick.

My 4 girls absolutely love these.  They are better than the store bought, and definately cheaper to make.  I tend to double the recipe and use a 17x11x1 jelly roll pan and it fits perfectly.  I cut them into 1x3 inch bars and it gives me 51!  Instaed of raisins I use chocolate and peanut butter chips.  If you add these to the cereal mixture they melt though.  I found if you evenly spread out the chocolate chips in the bottom of the baking dish, then press the mixture into the pan the chips do not melt much.  (My girls like to SEE the chocolate chips, but that's just them.  :)  Anyway, these are very tasty and a great way to get the kids into the kitchen with you!

These are very good and easy to make.  I followed the recipe, but used smooth p.butter and choc.chips instead of rasins.  I'm sure that you could substitute in dried cranberries, apricots, etc.  Use the base recipe and customize to what your own likes are.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

HEALTHY VERSION: puffed wheat instead of crispy rice, water instead of corn syrup, 1/2c jam for flavoring (i used peach jam) and decrease the brown sugar by half. I found it too sweet. Overall, great recipe, will definitely make again!

Very yummy! First time I made it I subbed the corn syrup for honey and it tasted good but was very crumbly.  I just made the other day and used half honey and half corn syrup and added just a bit more peanut butter.  It held together.  I added craisins, chocolate chips, flaxseed meal, and sunflower seeds. Love these and they freeze well too.

My kids went crazy for these!  I used dried cranberries and sunflower seeds along with mini chocolate chips.  My peanut butter was low fat.  I left the brown sugar at 1/2 cup and replaced the 1/2 cup corn syrup with 1/4 cup liquid lecithin.  Will make many variations of this recipe!

I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong, but I have tried to make these three times now and I only end up with a crumbly mess that won't stick together.  I wish there was a way for people to comment on reviews.  Maybe the corn syrup really needs to be boiled to a certain temperature?  Oh and people don't throw it out if it doesn't work for goodness sake, crumble it into a bowl and eat it as-is or pour milk on it because if you didn't make granola bars you at least made your own cereal! :D

Wow, tastes way better than any other recipe from this site that I have made so far.  The rice cereal gives this a nice crunch.  I like the corn syrup idea.  I will try honey next time like other reviewers have done.  I didnt add raisins, but put coconut in instead.  My husband said these taste better than store bought granola bars.

Delicious!  I used Better N Peanut Butter product (2 g of fat per serving vs 16 g) and it tasted great, couldn't even tell the difference.  To flatten bars grease a piece of wax paper and push the bars down.  Variations are endless--nuts, chocolate, butterscotch, etc.

Update: I've made these a few times now, including for my son's preschool class and all the kids love them.

These are great, and super easy to make.  My 3 year old enjoyed his task of mixing the krispies, oats and craisins while I heated the rest on the stove.  They're nice and chewy, and have a great flavor. I subbed craisins for the raisins, honey for the corn syrup, and I added a little extra vanilla.  I don't think they're going to last long!  I can't wait to try them with other goodies mixed in.

This is by FAR the best granola recipe I have ever used...I use honey instead of Corn syrup, and have added all kinds of goodies to this, coconut, dried fruit, cheerios, seeds, nuts, WHATEVER! I find it best made pressed into a pan and then cooled quickly, for maybe half an hour in the fridge before cutting.

Very good, made them 3X now. I used 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2 honey for the syrup. Added craisins,  almonds 1/4c of wheat germ and 1/4c of ground flax. Important to role and squish recipe together as it cools to hold together tight.

MMMMM, so good!!!  I substituded for ingredients that I had on hand: smooth peanut butter, honey, puffed brown rice cereal, and old fashion oats. I took the advice of others and used 2/3 cup of everything and used honey. I used half raisins/half cranberries.  I also added cinnamon and 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder to get a chocolate taste without adding any chocolate pieces.  I had no problem with them being crumbly. My roommate keeps asking me when I will be making these again, which I definitely will!

What a nice surprise these granola snacks are!  I am not usually a huge granola fan but these are delicious and so addictive.  I had problems with the bars being too crumbly the first few times I made this and have experimented with a few things to get them to stick together better.  It's true that you need to mix it THOROUGHLY.  I recommend using a stand mixer when combining the sugar mixture with the dry ingredients.  If you have to mix it by hand, I recommend making more of the sugar mixture (2/3 cup instead or 1/2 cup) to get your bars to stick together.  Also, because of others suggestions, I used honey instead or corn syrup, added a bit of salt, and I added raisins, cranberries, sliced alonds, and coconut.  Everyone asks for the recipe when I make these.  Try it and you won't be sorry.

ohmygod these are sooo good, its incredible, no wonder the recipe has five stars...first off, you don't need exactly 1/2 cup of honey, i put a little less that 1/2 cup and added water to fill the mark, i added 1 tsp of cinammon, and this is essential, 1 teaspon of salt...this is a must, they are incredible with salt...a lot of people had problems with their chocolate chips melting in the mix, but there is no need to put them in the mix right away...the granola is not going to harden until you let it cool it in the refrigerator. So my advice is to the let the granola cool at room temp for ten minutes or so, add in the chips, mold, press into the pan and voila...

I love this recipe - I  mix it up with different fruits and nuts, and sometimes I use oil instead of the peanut butter if I don't want a peanut butter taste.  I also use honey instead of corn-syrup and then bake it for 15 minutes at 350 so that they're not crumbly - one of my favorite combos is cranberries, almonds and white chocolate chips, sunflower seeds, and wheat germ.

This was a great recipe - my kids loved it.  I did make a few changes, mostly an acumulation of others' changes . . . I omitted the raisins and added chopped almonds instead; reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 c. (and it was still plenty sweet!) and used honey in place of corn syrup.  I also added about 1/4 cup of mini baking m&m's just before spreading out - awesome!  Thank you!

Amazing! I followed the suggestions of others by substituting honey for corn syrup. Also used choc flavored rice krispies and added craisins and sunflower seeds. Took minimal time.

Pretty good - great for a quick snack.  They don't stay together very well but I put each bar in a plastic wrap - stuck some in the fridge and grabbed them as I needed them.  My 1 year old loved them.

These were, as I expected, delectable!  The first time I made them, I was pleased but they were a bit too sweet.  Many people say up the peanutbutter, corn syrup and brown sugar to 3/4 cup, which I did but I would not reccomend upping the sugar. I could barely taste the peanutbutter. The next time, I used honey to make it healthy and only put in 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Now I am not a honey-lover but this batch is addictive! It was halfway gone by the next day! To make it even better, I put on a peanutbutter spread like frosting and chocolate chips like sprinkles. We ate it as if it were a healthy peanutbutter cake. Definitely a kid-friendly keeper!!

Wow!!!! I love it and it taste so much better than the ones I buy. I used a cup of quick-cooking oats and a cup of the Take Heart bluberry instant oatmeal. I would rate this another 5 stars if I could.

I have made these twice now and they are a really quick and yummy snack. The taste reminds me of a chewy granola bar but a little more sweet. I am planning on varying this recipe some next time I make it, perhaps some mini chocolate chips or craisins instead of raisins?

Yum, Yum, Yummy! Great no-cook granola bar recipe, and so versatile! After reading other's reviews, I used 2/3 cup of brown sugar, PB, and corn syrup. For the corn syrup, I filled the 2/3 measuring cup about 2/3 full, then topped it off with honey. I will definately be making these often!

the easiest granola bars ever!  ..... and very tasty, too.  however, i gave 4 stars instead of 5 because i found them too sweet and in need of tweeking.  the second time i made these, i increased the pb to 2/3 c. as some other reviewers had suggested.  i changed the corn syrup to honey and decreased the brown sugar to 1/3 c.  i now only use a 1/4 c. of brown sugar.  i've made these with rice crispies, but prefer special k or nestle fitness and crush the flakes with my hands when i mix them with the oats.  i love the consistency of these bars.  they kind of have the texture of a rice crispie treat.  i love cutting them into bite size squares and eat a couple when i'm on the fly.  these are perfect for kids:).

So easy and so yummy. Once you eat this granola bars, you will never go back to store bought ones.  I usually toast my oats in a pan to get uncooked oat flavor and texture out.  Everyone loves them.  Thank you for the recipe!!

These are really really sweet! I used honey rather than corn syrup but next time I will use 1/4 cup honey and 3/4 cup peanut butter. I think overall it's a great recipe - I like the rice krispie crunchiness! I also added whole flaxseeds and walnuts and chocolate chips.

This is outstanding!!  I used honey instead of the corn syrup and noticed that after it cooled down it was a bit honey flavor overkill; however, the next morning the flavors fussed together and it was perfect.  I added golden raisins and cranberries.  I sprinkled chocolate chips over the top and placed under the broiler for a few seconds just to melt them so that I could spread the chocolate over the top.  Next time I'm going to add sunflower seed to the mixture.

This is by far, the best granola I have ever had. The first time I made this, I made it into bars, but they came apart easily. So the next time (and many times since), I have made it into granola that I either put into a baggy and eat as is, or eat with milk. (this is SO good!)
I make the following modifications:
I use half (or sometimes all) almond butter in place of peanut butter because it's healthier. I also use 2 1/2 cups of oats, and not the quick ones! I increase the peanut (or almond) butter to 2/3 cup, 2/3 cup of honey (instead of corn syrup), and it's quite sweet this way, so if you don't like it too sweet, use less honey. I use 1/2 cup of brown sugar, increase the vanilla to 3/4 tsp, and add 1/3 cup of sliced almonds, 1/3 cup of raisins, 1/3 cup of dried cranberries, 1/4 cup of wheat germ. I mix it all up in a bowl, let it sit in the fridge for an hour- and wallah!
This never lasts more than a week, and everyone who tries it can't get enough of it.

EDIT: Add cinnamon and nutmeg to brown sugar\honey mixture, takes it over the top.

I made these just like the recipe except for the raisins because I wasn't going to let that stop me from having a sugar treat today.  Next time I will try Chocolate Crispies.  Less messy than Rice Krispie Treats.

I really didn't care for these. I found them too sweet as a granola bar, and not satisfying as a cookie.

Very good, very easy, very easy to change/add/ substitute. You might need to up the amount of corn syrup/ peanut butter if you add extra stuff to it.

Try wetting your hands with cold water to push it in the pan without it sticking to your hands (this works with Rice Krispie squares, too)
Will definately be making this lots!!

I just made these today and they are the best granola bars I have had. I substituted 2/3c honey for the corn syrup as others suggested and also added cinnamon. I also used smooth reduced fat peanut butter and old fashioned oats since that is what I had on hand. The possibilities with this recipe are endless! Best chewy granola bar I have made!

I have tried a lot of granola bar recipes, and usually my hubby gives me the "just throw them away and buy some" line! However, he ate two pans of these and the kids even liked them, too! I used honey instead of corn syrup and added a little cinnamon and wheat germ. They stored great for 7-10 days and we really enjoyed them. Thanks!

I can't believe how easy these were to make.  I used 1/2 cup honey instead of the corn syrup, and they came out great. Instead of using a spatula, I put everything on a sheet of parchment paper, and then folded the mix over and over until it was incorporated. Then just shape into a square and cut before it cools. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and pretty nutritious, too! We do not need to buy granola bars from the store anymore, these are so fast and easy. My kids love them, sent them with my daughter for her treat day. Great summer recipe that does not heat up the house. Will probably play around with adding different ingredients for a change of pace.  This recipe is a keeper!

Pretty good and a great quick snack!  The only thing I was confused about is it calls for raisins but never says when to put them in - I didn't realize until I finished pressing it into the pan that an ingredient was missing.  Hm.  But still good even without the raisins.  Next time we'll add some fruit and probably some chocolate chips :)

What I like about this recipe is that it's very forgiving. You can make it as written and it'll be delicious, or you can mess around with it and add new things if you'd like. It's hard to screw this up unless you don't have enough corn oil or peanut butter for your dry ingredients. I tend to use honey instead of corn oil, but sometimes I use a mix of both. Like I said, it's a forgiving recipe. I always have creamy peanut butter on hand (add more than the recipe suggests...more is good), so I add a handful of peanuts. And I usually add more raisins, too. 

These snacks don't taste like granola bars to me. I'd say they're more like peanut-butter-rice-krispie-treats with other goodies thrown in. In any case, be sure to make lots, as people gobble them up quickly.

I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because it was crumbly. Next time i would use a little less syrup than suggested and i would use about a cup and a half of honey on top of that to make it stick more. However i put it in the refrigerator and it was not crumbly after that. However, the kids wanted them at room temperature. I used milk chocolate chips in it and it was delicious. This recipe is great!

The 1st time I tried this I did exactly what it said and it was so crumbly. So I tried what the others suggested with the peanut butter and honey. We loved it! This is now something that is alway in our kitchen! Thanks.

I just made this with my 3 and 4 year olds (I do child care) and it is SO good.  I switched raisins for craisins  and added chopped walnuts and chocolate chips.  I added a bit more of the corn syrup to accommodate the extra ingredients, mixed it all with my hands, and squeezed balls of it into greased muffin cups and pressed down to make patties.  No crumbling at all.  Thank you TinaMarie for sharing your recipe.

Ok, so I took others advice and subbed honey for corn syrup and upped the amount of honey and peanut butter to 2/3 cup.. others complained of their bars being too dry but mine were too moist! I ended up having to add in extra oats and cereal. Still delicious but beware of doubling the wet ingredients :)  Also added dried cranberries.. yum!

Yum. I subbed honey for corn syrup...without doing that, I would've for SURE felt like I was eating treats instead of a healthier snack option. I also prefer creamy PB so I used that. They come together with minimal effort and are surely a comforting hit for people of all ages.

These are good and, with some changes, great. I made them the first time exactly according to instructions. They were decent, but somewhat crumbly and bland. The second time, I used 1/4 c honey in addition to the 1/2 c corn syrup, added chopped cashews (because I had some laying around), and subbed dried cranberries for raisins. They were excellent. BF, who considers himself a granola aficionado, was enthralled and called me from work to tell me how amazing they were. Thanks so much for this great base recipe!

These were okay. I modified a bit based on other reviews and used half honey and half corn syrup.  I also used brown sugar Spenda and craisins.  I added about 3/4c lightly salted mixed nuts.  I still thought they were too sweet, but my husband likes them.

I read many granola recipies and settled on this one because I like Rice Crispy Treats..lol.  I didnt use oatmeal, I did add 1/2 cup wheat germ.  These taste so yummy and my daughter has ate them multiple times today.  The possibilities are endless I bought tart cherries so I will be making cherry & walnut next!!  THANKS!...ps I also think banana chips with pecans and maple syrup instead of honey, would also be tasty!

These are fantastic! I make them once a week for my husband to take to work and for me to nibble on. I took the others suggestions and sub honey for the syrup. I also upped the honey and to 2/3c and about 1/2c for the brown sugar. I add 1/4 cup wheat gem, and dried cranberries or goji berries, too. Way cheaper then store bought granola bars and much better.

These are delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly.  They held together well, cut easily, and stored wonderfully.  They didn't last long in our house.  My husband and I even did a taste test between these and granola bars from the store.  These won!  We also took some time and figured out the cost of ingredients used in a batch vs. the cheapest store brand we can buy.  The price was the same, but this recipe makes twice as many bars.  Great value. Next time I'll add chocolate chips for variety.  Try these!

These dissapeared so fast! I wanted to make home-made granola bars but didn't want to turn on the oven, so these were perfect. I increased the honey and peanut butter to 2/3c and they were delicious! I lined my pan with foil, poured in the mix and dipped my hands in water to spread them out.

Mmmmm!  I read a lot of reviews and ended up making this with high protein Special K cereal and 2/3 c each of peanutbutter & brown sugar.  Then I added 1/3 c each of honey and light corn syrup. I mixed it in a plastic bowl, then turned it out onto my wooden cutting board and rolled it out with a wooden rolling pin.  The mixture did not stick to the wood at all!  I wish I had a big wooden salad bowl to mix it up in because it did stick a little to the plastic.  Then, I cut off one edge (just to make it straight.  I swear!) and put in in the fridge to cool faster.  I just ate it and it is really really delicious.  But, really, I could totally have waited until it cooled on the counter because I'm an adult.  I think.  The mixture does stick after it cools so it's best to get it off the cutting board as soon as it's firm enough to move. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Very Similar to a recipe I learned in kindergarten with a few changes that I made to be healthier.  I use 4 1/2 cups Special K Complete with protein, no oatmeal, 3/4-1 cup creamy peanut butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup light corn syrup, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 T ground flax, 1 T cracked wheat, no raisins but I sprinkle a few chocolate chips on top after pressed into a pan.  I add the flax, cracked wheat and Special K after mixture is melted on stove.  Always a favorite that will disappear quick.

This was very, very tasty but crumbly.  I read many reviews and followed suggestions using honey instead of corn syrup and 2/3 of a cup for peanut butter and honey but used recipe amount for brown sugar (otherwise too sweet!). Two BIG SUCCESS SECRETS... use parchment paper rather than greasing the pan, they just glide off and no mess.  Also don't add salt into the mix just sprinkle with a tiny bit of salt after you press into the pan.  Amazing :)

Loved it.  Based on reviews I used 1/3 c. honey, 1/3 cup light corn syrup and 2/3 cup brown sugar.  Mine stuck together great and easily cut into bars.  They are soft and slightly chewy.  Not like the texture of any packaged granola bar that I've tasted. I used creamy peanut butter.  I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the dry mix.  I think 1 key might be make sure it comes to a boil.  Also, make sure to mix well.  I just cooled mine in the pan on the counter - I read a few reviews where they were cooled in the fridge.  This shouldn't be necessary.  Next time I may try w/ cranberries and add some salt to cut down the sweetness?  It tasted really good and they held together great but I think they would taste even better if I didn't taste so much honey. (I know that's an addition - not the original recipe so maybe that's the problem!)  Either way I will definitely make these again.

Yumm!I took a little of everyones advice when I made it, plus I traded 1 cup of multi-grain flakes for rice crispies, that way it has more nutritional value. The end recipe, which I think is just right is: 1c multi grain flakes, 1 1/2c rice, 2c oats, 1/2c coconut, 1/4c flax seed, 1/2c brown sugar, 1/2c karo syrup, 1/3c honey 1/2c peanut butter, 1tsp vanilla 1/8tsp salt. I pressed chocolate chips on top. Thanks for all the great ideas.

One of the best granola bar recipes I have made.  This is one I will make over and over again.  So many variations you could do with it.  I did use honey instead of corn syrup.  And cut down a bit on the brown sugar.

Great recipe to make with the kids. Husband loved them. I am not a fan of marshmallow so this was a nice variation of rice krispie treats. Loved the addition of oats and how quick it was!!

I made these several months ago with my Brownie troop and forgot to rate it. We made a couple of substitutions based on tastes - chocolate chips, M&M's.  We actually made this twice - the 2nd time the girls served this as a dessert at a family dinner.  Everyone loved it.  This is an extremely easy recipe, something that kids can make and have fun with and this lends itself to substitutions.  Great recipe!!

My husband and I love these.  They are so versitile(spelling?).  I have made them as directed and they are delicious.  I have also used dried mixed fruit.  Last time I was almost out of oats so I used prepackaged apple cinnimon oatmeal.  They were really good.  A good used for leftover oatmeal after warmer weather starts.

I made these a couple of weeks ago and forgot to review. I only remembered when I had requests to make them again. The first time I made these I went with the recipe and used raisins, yesterday I used cherries instead. Both times they disappeared almost instantly. Many Thanks.

These were very good. I lined my pan with parchment paper and sprayed sandwich  bags with pam to uses as "gloves" to crush down the granola mixture.  I didn't have a lot of time so I put the granola bars in the freezer to cool down for about 10 minutes before cutting.  Instead of raisins I too added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  This last time I froze the chocolate chips while I was getting the rest of the ingredients together and stired them in just before pressing into the pan.

True to the name, these snacks were gobbled up.  My kids weren't thrilled, but they need time to adapt to new food.  These snacks satisfy our "cookie craving" and are faster and less fatty than cookies.  Delicious!

Simply delicious.Easy to make and a great homemade snack.They are a little sticky but everybody loved them. They also freeze well.
I used Maple syrup instead of the corn syrup.
I have already made another batch of them. Thanks for the recipe.

This is my favorite kind of recipe.  It's very forgiving and handles substitutions quite well!  To keep mess at a minimum and to pack the bars together well, I pressed the mixture into the pan using a sheet of waxed paper.  (This is a great trick for Rice Krispie squares too.)  I had no problems with stickiness or crumbliness.

This is awesome! Out of many granola recipes I have tried, this is the one that gets eaten by everyone in my house and is typically gone the next day. I used Maple Syrup instead of corn syrup and the last time I added 3/4 of miniature marshmallows. I just can't rave enough!

This recipe is a good start to a granola snack, but I found it may have had a little too much oats or rice krispies, as they kept falling apart.  Other than that they are very good with dried cranberries and whole or half almonds for a nice healthy chewy treat or even a quick breakfast for the kids if I wake up late.

My kids love this.  We make this about all the time now.  The only thing we change is the krispies - we use Honey Nut Cheerios.  

This is great for them to snack on before a basketball/cheerleading activity & really great for those days that we have tournaments & they need a little snack.

These are great and easy to make up!!  I had the same problem wtih them falling apart, but then realized I was cutting them too big.  So when cut smaller, they hold together just fine.  My 6 year old loves these, and I think I'll be making them quite often now!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Excellent!  The kids LOVED it, and it was so easy.  I had everything on had too!  I didn't add the raisins, but there are so many things you can do with this recipe!  My daughter suggested drizzling melted chocolate (even white chocolate) over the top.  This one is a keeper!  Thanks.

So I would give a 4 star to the actual recipe but a 2 to the name. The name implies granola based goodies. This in fact is a semi healthy but then take it all away rice krispie recipe. Super yummy, don't get me wrong, but at the end of the day a 1/2 rice crispy, 1/2 oatmeal, rice crispy treat. I wonder if you are really doing any health justice to substituting marsh mellow fluff for corn syrup and brown sugar. Again, super yummie recipe but not nearly a granola snack I was looking for, instead a really time consuming on clean up oatmeal cookie after dinner treat. Trust me I ate way more of them than my kids did, they are really tasty

My family loved the flavor and the texture of these snacks.  Held together nicely with a nice peanut butter taste.  I added mini-chocolate chips on top.  I also used 4 tbsp. of ground flax and fiber one cereal in the dry mix.  Can't even tell either ingredient is in there.

These bars are pretty good. Crumbly unless you increase the syrup/peanut butter mixture almost double. Even the kids like them.

Very tasty!  I like the versatility.  I did change it up but am rating the recipe as a "base".  Here's what I did:  substituted puffed wheat for the crispy rice, substituted dried cranberried for raisins, added 2 tbsp ground flax seed, added 1/2c chopped walnuts, used 1/3c corn syrip, 1/3c honey and 2/3c peanut butter.  Still pretty sweet so I might omit the corn syrup next time.  Overall a great starting point!

I made this for a healthy recipie cooking contest in health class.  They were very good! There is just one problem though; the 9 x 13 inch baking dish is a little to large for this recipie. The first time I made it, I used this size baking dish and the pieces were too thin and falling apart. I made it again with a smaller baking dish and it helped a lot.

I added a 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to the existing recipe (they will melt, but this is fine) and it was fabulous--almost tasted like no-bake cookies!  Great recipe!!

Good base recipe, although I changed a few things. I used honey instead of corn syrup, 1 tbs butter, 3/4 c natural pb, pinch of salt. Overall good recipe!

Got rave reviews from school--my daughter took for snacks. I doubled recipe, still used 9x13 pan, and cut 6 rows x 4 rows for 24 bars total. Could probably add another row for smaller bars since they are thicker.  Cutting/chopping bars with metal serving spatula worked much better than a knife. I reduced brown sugar and added salt per other reviewers. I used 1/2 crispy rice cereal, and 1/2 honey nut Cheerios. Given the sweetness of the recipe, I would probably go with plain Cheerios next time.  I like the chopped pretzel idea for next time also. Is a fun recipe you could vary in many ways.

I followed the recipe exactly (and added a few chocolate chips) and it turned out great. It was very sweet though, more like a cookie than a granola bar. In fact, I have a cookie recipe that uses special k instead of the oats and rice krispies, and without raisins....but other than that, it's exactly the same recipe.

I did not have success, but then i altered the recipe. I do not want to use corn syrup so I added more brown sugar with a little water. Made great cereal, but not bars.

These are so yummy...however I rate it a 4 because it doesn't really taste like a granola bar to me. I did use chocolate chips instead of raisins and I'm glad because I don't think raisins would have tasted near as good. They taste more like a dessert to me. But super good!

Very good and so easy! I didn't have crispy rice cereal so I used corn flakes. I also used half honey and half corn syrup since I was almost out of corn syrup. I omitted raisins and added chocolate chips on top. This recipe is so versatile, I will use it a lot!!!

My 2- and 4-yr-olds enjoyed this snack. And my husband said it tasted professional, the kind of treat we'd find at our favorite bakery. That's the kind of comment I LOVE!   Based on other reviews, I sub'd honey for the corn syrup and up'd only the peanut butter to 2/3 cu. I also sub'd Craisins for raisins and added a half cup of white chocolate chips. YUM!   They don't stick together as well as rice krispies treats. My 2-yr-old wanted a spoon to eat this. But my 4-yr-old forged on with just her hands. And I pressed it all into a 9x9 dish and made 16 squares. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good- using the 9x13 made mine come out too thin so I will 1 1/2 the recipe next time. I also thought they were too sweet so I'll use less corn syrup next time.

This is the first granola recipe I have made, and it is pretty good!  I followed other reviews and exchanged honey for corn syrup, added 1/2 c. chocolate chips, and 1/2 c. cranberries (in addition to the raisins).  Maybe I added too many sweets cause it is pretty sweet!  Or maybe next time I will add Cheerios (the photo of this recipe looks like there are Cheerios in it), and more oats...for more balance next time.  But overall, great recipe...thanks!

I usually make homemade granola bars for my husband to take for a work snack and when I saw this I thought I'd give it a try.  He doesn't like raisins so I substituted choc chips and I can't really review these from my own taste perspective because I am one of the few who doesn't like chocolate and PB together...but they came out great (so I'm told).  The choc chips melted into the mixture, so they turned out like chocolate/peanut butter Rice Krispy treats.  There was no baking and the whole recipe was done in about 10 minutes.  As a little side note, I've found the easiest way to spread batter like this or granola bars into a 9 x 13 pan is to flatten the batter to a relatively even layer with your spatula, then lay a piece of wax paper over the top, put in an 8 x 8 pan, apply pressure and smooth back and forth.....works every time!

I made this but increased everything from 1/2 c to 2/3 c.  I love sweets, but the extra corn syrup and peanut butter made it just too sweet.  Next time I will stick with the original recipe.  Very tasty adn filling.

I have no idea how people are getting these to be dry.  I followed the recipe pretty close (minus raisins) and these were very chewy & plenty of syrup to cover dry ingredients.  The changes I made were omitting raisins (by mistake), using regular oats instead of quick oats, using honey instead of corn syrup, and adding 3T ground flax seed & about 1t cinnamon.  These are very good!  I think I may not have to buy store bought granola bars now.  My kids and I love 'em & I think my hubby will love 'em too. *Now that I think about it, it probably made a difference in 'wetness' by simply switching quick oats to regular oats.  I would suggest to others to use regular oats b/c they are a little more healthy since it takes the body a little longer to digest, thus keeping you fuller longer.  And they still taste wonderful with regular oats.*

Very easy and very yummy. I didn't have chunky peanut butter so used creamy peanut butter and added some peanuts. Also was short on corn syrup so added honey. It came out perfect. I will never purchase granola bars from the store again. This is not only easy, but also healthy and very economical.

OK...follow one reviewer and upped the ingredients to 2/3 cup honey, 2/3 cup brown sugar and 2/3 cup peanut butter.  Used super crunch PB.  Added about a cup of sliced almonds and stirred, stirred, stirred.  Topped the bars in the pan with a sprinkle of mini chocolate chips.  Sent them to work in my husbands lunch box and got rave reviews.  Thanks TINAMARIES for sharing

I made these today because the recipe reminded me of something a relative used to make when I was a kid. As it turns out, I didn't like it much then OR now. However, I think that's my personal taste coming to bear--they're not bad, I just don't like the flavor of the corn syrup mixture. Some people suggested using honey, but then complained that it was too sweet...that's because honey is much sweeter than corn syrup. Also some of the "most helpful" comments suggest "replacing the oil with honey" but there's no oil in this recipe. It also doesn't tell you what to do with the raisins. I think this recipe may have gotten re-written at some point. Someone else even mentioned eating these "straight out of the oven", but there's no cook time listed! Thanks for the recipe.

We loved these!  Used creamy peanut butter, only because of daughter's illness, we 'Gobbled 'em up!'  Simple to make too!

Very good.  I followed others advice and upped the "stuff" to 2/3 cup.  For the syrup, I used probably 1/6 cup of honey (all I had) and then topped it off to 2/3 with the syrup. I wasn't really sure about the "just to a boil"...the more I stirred, the less it boiled so I ended up letting it simmer for a minute or two trying to decide if that was "boiling".  I used another person's advice to just stir stir stir once I put it in the dry stuff.  When I thought it was thoroughly mixed, I stirred some more.  Finally I dumped it all in the pan and used the back of my Pampered Chef scraper (spoonula) to push it all down.  Then I put it in the fridge for about 10 minutes (I had stirred it well enough that it wasn't that hot to begin with) and it is not crumbly at all!  It is like a real granola bar but with the fun of a rice crispy treat.  This was great and will be made many more times.

Very good.  I've been searching for a homemade granola bar recipe and this one is very tasty.  I really like that I don't have to bake this one.  I used honey in place of the corn syrup, added just a bit of cinnamon and coconut, left out the raisins and used a small amount of craisins...delish!!  Also only had creamy organic peanut butter and it works just fine.   I couldn't wait for it to cool to taste it so both my husband and I took a bite.  He loved it too.  I think this will be a keeper.

Fast and fantastic! My hubby who is not a fan of peanut butter loved them. I used honey instead of corn syrup and followed others suggestions and used 2/3 cup for all. I pressed dried cranberries into the top as soon as they were in the pan. They stuck very nicely. I left them in plastic bags in the cupboard and did not have any problems with them drying out. I can't wait to make them again and try some variations with mini chocolate chips or different cereals or dried cherries! Yum.

Today I decided to make granola bars (3/7/09) and tried several of the recipes listed.  This one is the all time Very Best granola bar ever (and I just hate granola bars).  I used cereal on hand (Honey Bunches of Oats) and regular (not quick cooking) oats, chopped walnuts and some leftover almond crunch (Mrs. May's Naturals) and drizzled the top with Honey...otherwise every other ingredient as stated in recipe.  Wow! Was I surprised since I don't like granola bars.  Will be making these often!  Note:  the recipe didn't say how long to bake or at what temperataure so did 350 deg oven for 15 min and they seemed to come out fine...I cut them whilst they were still warm from the oven.  I'm gonna have to smack myself to keep from eating them all!  Tiffany from Texas

Excellent!  Based on other reviews, I increased the PB and honey from 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup but left the brown sugar at 1/2 cup.  I used a good quality creamed honey and 100% PB.  My biggest tip is rather than using rice krisps I used KASHI brand "7 whole grain honey puffs" which added more texture and variety.  To finish I added sliced almonds, roasted/salted cashews and flax seeds.  I still found the recipe a bit sweet so next time I might use less honey/brown sugar.

These are great and so much easier than the others on this site!  I've made then with honey, light corn syrup and recently sugar free maple syrup.  Not a big enough difference in the results to justify using the super high calorie honey, the maple syrup was my favorite for sure for taste and calories.  I mix up the ingredients but get good results with staying together if I round the measurements a bit lighter on the dry ones.  I add 1/2 tsp of salt too.  Thanks for a great granola bar!

These are awesome and will become a regular snack at my house. We subbed pecans for the raisins (because no one at my house likes them), we used honey in places of the corn syrup and used 2/3 cup brown sugar.

These are so tastey and really quick and easy.  I added flax seed. I used honey which I think is a MUST.  I cut back on the sugar by half and thought they were plenty sweet. Thanks for the recipe!

It's really great how easy these are and adaptable to whatever ingredients you have on hand!  I used Crispix cereal, Grape Nuts Trail Mix Crunch, snipped dried apricots, raisins, salted peanuts, chocolate chips and the corn syrup/brown sugar mixture.  Made just half a recipe so formed it in a loaf pan -

Great, easy recipe!  My kids LOVED these and they were a snap to fix and a healthier alternative to just plain old krispy treats.  I added 1/4 cup flax seed just for a health kick.

A weekly favorite of mine.  For those with crumbling issues, I suggest the following (instead of increasing the sweet stuff): after mixing well, dump into greased pan and press loosely into shape with spoon.  Then cover with greased foil or plastic wrap and use your hands to press in very firmly (put your body weight into it!).  The denser packing makes them hold up much better.

These came out PERFECT for me!  They have the taste and consistency of store-bought granola bars!!

The only thing I altered was adding more raisins (about 1 cup total) and using creamy soy nut butter in place of the crunchy peanut butter.  (I think I'll add a little cinnamon with the raisins!)     

I'm not sure how others found these too crumbly--maybe their peanut butter was too dry, or perhaps CREAMY peanut butter would work better than crunchy.  It might also help to make sure you mix it VERY thoroughly before putting it in the pan--this takes a while, so be patient--and to let them cool completely before cutting (they were much better the next day; they do fall apart if still warm).  I also used my hands, as some suggested, to press the mixture into the pan.  
I will definitely make these again (and again, and again)!!  I really want to try them with chocolate chips!  Thanks!!

YUM! If I hadn't made them myself I wouldn't have known they were actually healthy! These remind me of Clif Bars. I used honey instead of corn syrup and increased it and the brown sugar to 2/3 as others had suggested, I toasted the oats in a skillet, and used Kashi puffed 7-grain cereal instead of puffed rice to keep it healthy. I also threw in about 1/4 cup chocolate chips, which totally melted and turned the bars into an indulgence. I can't wait to try other combinations of flavors! Excellent, super-quick recipe - thanks so much!

Make sure you let the brown sugar and corn syrup come to a good, hard boil before removing from heat. That might be why some revies didn't think they set up too well.  I added M&M's!

I'm a huge peanut butter fan, and these are really good. However, I did use smooth peanut butter, and I would have described them as Peanut butter Bars, even though I added dried apricots  and cranberries, and some coconut.Yum!

I'm telling you now, double the batch!  My husband loves them, loves them, loves them.  My kids love them too, and I could easily eat the whole pan!  Using crunchy peanut butter really makes all the difference.  I omitted raisins b/c of family preference.  SO easy, cheap, and delicious!

Talk about quick! Talk about easy! These mixed up in a snap. The directions don't indicate when to add the raisins...I put them in with the oats and cereal. I also added a handful of chocolate chips. No bake cookies don't get any easier than this.

The name says it all.  It's very hard to stop eating them!  I used craisins instead of raisins (better taste, fewer calories).  I also used half the amount of corn syrup; they taste fine but are crumbly as a result.  This is a recipe you could easily play around with.  You could add chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, white chocolate, mini marshmellows, or other dried fruit.  Will definitely make again!

I was surprised at how good this was!! I made a few changes.  I mixed the corn syrup with honey for a little different flavor.  Plus as after I poured the hot mixture into the cereal mixture I mixed in about a cup of chocholate chips.  The chips melted a little and made the bars a little gooey, which I thought made them wonderful!  I'll make a bigger match next time!

This was a very good recipe, though I did alter it significantly. I added about a 1/2 cup of slivered almonds, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and mixed in about 4 cups of crushed cinnamon-flavored life cereal along with an additonal 1/2 c. of the cereal whole. I also used honey in place of corn syrup. Lastly, due to the increase of dry ingredients I doubled the honey, brown sugar, peanut butter and vanilla mixture. The kids - and hubby - loved it!

I made these with peanut butter chips in place of the raisins and also chocolate chop too. My kids prefer the chocolate chip but I am a huge peanut butter fan anyway. I was thinking I would save money making these instead of buying granola bars but my family is eating them so fast I can't keep up with them! At least they are a healthier version then the ones in the store!

These were delicious and a very healthy snack!  They're a nice variation on a Rice Krispie treat, and the peanut butter made them especially good.  I'll be making these a lot!

THESE ARE AWESOME!!!  OMG, sooooooo good!  It was hard to stir, but the "effort" was so worth it!  I omitted the raisins, added coconut and drizzled melted chocolate on top.  FANTASTIC!  THANK YOU!

Came out great.  I increased the honey, peanut butter and brown sugar from 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup. Used a heaping 1/2 cup of trail mix with raisins and nuts, then added a handful of chocolate and peanut butter morsels.  Granola's did not crumble at all when cut.  Lined the pan with waxed paper and lightly greased it.
Refrigerated before cutting.

These are so addictive!  I cannot stop eating them!  I substituted part of the corn syrup with honey, and may try cutting back the corn syrup even more to reduce the sugar content.  YUM!

These are pretty good.  A bit crunchy.  I followed the recipe with the exception of replacing the raisins with mini m & m's.  Next time I will add more peanut butter and a bit more corn syrup.

this is awesome!  first of all, its very very quick--only took like 15 minutes to make.  I used cheerios (we have like 6 bags for some reason) and it turned out wonderfully!  I dont know if my batch filled up the pan for some reason, but thats no big deal.  i do suggest lining the pan with wax paper though.  the only bad thing is that it's really crumbly-- i don't know how much more it'll harded, but besides that, the taste is EXCELENT!!!!! my whole family loves it!

My family is staying away from refined sugars as much as realistically possible so I substituted brown rice syrup for the corn syrup and date sugar for the sugar. I noticed that it looked like it would not stay together well so I melted 3TB of butter and added that in too. They came out well and taste yummy.

I wasn't sure after the first bite, but then I found myself eating more and more of it. At first it seems like the peanut butter flavor doesn't really fit with this, but then it grows on you. I did substitute chocolate chips for the raisins. Next time it might be even yummier to drizzle some melted chips over the top of this. My family loved it, and asked that I make it again.

I put chocolate chips in the mix right away, only for them to melt when I poured in the peanut butter mixture.  It still tasted fine, but I really enjoy have chunks of chocolate in my granola bars.  You could also use peanut butter or butterscotch chips.  This is a great way to use up the cereal (rice krispies, cheerios, ) that has lost its appeal from being in the pantry for too long. :)

Great Basic Recipe!
I always double because my kids and husband love this! I use 3/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup maple syrup, old fashioned oats (mixes better) 1/4 cup sliced almonds, half peanut butter half almond butter, and substitute 1 1/2 cups of the rice krispies for either honey nut cheerios or honey bunches of oats. It adds great texture. Absolutely delicious!

These bars were good. I used honey and used smooth peanut butter, but added crushed salted roasted peanut. Unfortunately, I used a bit more rice crispies than the recipe called for so my bars fell apart slightly (but they still held up). Keeper!

By using other peoples reviews, here's what I did: 2.5c rice cereal, 1.5c oats, 0.5c sunflower seeds, 4Tbs milled flax seed w/blueberries, 2pinches sea salt, 1tsp cinnamon, 0.25c chopped almonds, 0.25c dried fruit mix (mango, cranberries, blueberries). Pot on my stove had 2/3c brown sugar, 1/3c honey w/enough lite corn syrup to make just under 2/3c total then 2/3c Better'n Peanut Butter (Trader Joes). Mixed then pressed into mini muffin tins sprayed w/nonstick spray. Reciped made a little over 4.5dzn "muffins". I like them very much. Husband said they were good. Tomorrow I'm taking to work for "Healthy Snack Day". Hopefully I can amend this later to let ya'll know how well they go over. Doesn't matter though as I'll be more than happy to eat them all!

Mmmmmm!! This is what everyone said when they tried these. I used honey instead of corn syrup and sprinkled some chocolate chips on the top, freezing for a few minutes to harden them. I loved the peanut- butter and honey taste. My dad said he likes these better than rice crispy treats!

This is sooooo good! I did increase all the 1/2 cup items to 2/3 cup and since we have a peanut allergy in our home, I used Trader Joe's sunflower seed butter instead of peanut butter. You would never know it was not peanut butter. Also used chocolate chips instead of raisins. Thank you for this recipe!

Took reviewers advice and increased PB, honey, and brown sugar to 2/3 cup. Kept raisin measure same and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips! Omitted vanilla. Next time I think I'll experiment with decreasing just the brown sugar as it was a little too sweet and a tad gooey for me. Dried cranberries would probably work better than raisins, although the chocolate chips in it were wonderful!

Still a great recipe! Everyone loved it! So easy too! Will definitely make again!

Yummy!  Made mostly as directed, other than substituting mostly honey for the corn syrup (made 1/2 c. equivalent by using 2 tbsp corn syrup and the rest was honey).  I microwaved the honey/syrup and sugar combo for almost 2 minutes (stirring every 30 seconds) and this worked out well.  I did cut back on the oats (used 1 and 1/2 c. to make the mixture a little more gooey) and added a tsp of cinnamon and a pinch of salt.  Really tasty.  Wrapped the cut pieces individually for freezing for our lunches when school starts back.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, replaced syrup with honey, slightly less sugar, more peanut butter. I thought the flavor was delicious but it is still somewhat crumbly. Nothing some yogurt or patience won't fix. Definitely will be making this again.

What a hit with the kids (and unfortunately our dog the first time)!!  Made with some chips, coconut and raisins.  Yummy!  Will definitely make over and over with many different varieties of fillers!!

Seriously! So good and SO easy! I cannot say enough that this is a great recipe! I am really happy to watch my kids gobble it right up.  It is inexpensive to make, and makes a lot of granola bars. The only thing I did differently is use crunchy almond butter b/c my daughter's school is peanut free.  She can now take granola bars to school!! The almost butter worked wonderfully!!

I substituted the 1/2 cup of raisins with 1/4c of raisins, 1/8c chopped pecans, and 1/8 craisins. I also substituted the corn syrup with honey only because I discovered that I was out of corn syrup. This turned out awesome. I would like to add more dried fruit next time.

I thought these were going to be a granola type breakfast bar.  They are not!  It was nothing but a mess.  The texture was awful, just like practically taking some cereal and dumping it into a pan.  Nothing was stuck together at all!! Even if it did, this was NOT a granola bar! Tried to fix this, but at this point will stop trying and toss it out.  Will NOT be attempting this again.

These are the easiest granola bars to make and they are so yummy!  This recipe can easily be changed to suit your likes, such as adding chocolate or butterscotch chips.  Love them!

These taste really great as written. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because they are more crumbly than I would like. Not a big deal. The reviewers who suggested using 2/3 of all the wet ingredients probably have it right. I'll try that next time. My husband liked them and he doesn't usually like stuff like that. I added 2 Tablespoons milled flax seed but that's the only change I made. I cut them into rectangles and wrapped each one in saran wrap and I plan to have them as snacks during the week. I'll definitely keep this recipe! It's great.

I made them with 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 TB honey and 1/2 cup water. I added 1/8 cup flax seed and 1/3 cup coconut and 1/3 cup chopped apricots. They were great. Next time i will add a bit more peanut butter and a bit less brown sugar.

My family and I love this recipe! I used crushed Corn Chex, cranberries, honey and creamy peanut butter because that is what I had in my pantry. I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and they are wonderful! I love how versatile they are. I also found it much easier to mix with my hands once the mixture became cool enough to handle, also using my hands to press in the pan.

Really yummy!! My daughter helped with making these treats and really loved them.  I also used honey instead of corn syrup... I may do half and half next time (I found them a little sweet).  Thank you for the great recipe!!!

I just made this recipe and I love it. It's delicious, and very versatile, so I was able to use what I had in the house.  After reading the reviews, I used 2/3 cups of peanut butter; and since I didn't have corn syrup, I used 1/3 cup each of honey and blue agave.  I also mixed 2/3 cup of mixed raisins and dried cranberries (got to clean out the cabinet a bit) into the hot syrups before I added the peanut butter, so they could plump up a bit.  Because agave is so sweet, I kept the sugar @ 1/2 cup.  The only suggestion I have for anyone is to mix the ingredients in the largest, widest bowl you have.  I used my second largest, and each time I thought I was done mixing, I found a dry pocket of cereal. I got it all well mixed, though, and I think I got my day's arm workout in! haha. Next time I'll use a wider bowl. But all in all, I love this recipe and look forward to using it. And it looks like a great way to get rid of all those random half boxes of cereal in my cabinet. yay!

These are so great! they are really versatile too. I used chocolate chips and they came out great but I can't wait to make them again with nuts and raisins-much healthier. I also used honey instead of corn syrup.

These are great and super easy to make.  Made as written except used honey instead of corn syrup and sunbutter due to my son's peanut allergy.  I did think they were a little on the sweet side so I made reduce the honey and/or brown sugar next time.

I liked these, especially the crunch of the little peanut bits the crunchy peanut butter added. I used puffed whole wheat cereal, old fashioned oats, and a mixture of molasses and water instead of the corn syrup. They were kind of crumbly this way, but I think it was the molasses. They tasted fantastic, though!

These are wonderful! I used dried cherries instead of raisins, creamy peanut butter, and 3/4 cup of light corn syrup. They turned out so chewy and delicious! I cant wait to make them with chocolate chips next time! Thanks for the great recipe :)

I didnt have corn syrup  so I looked online for a corn syrup recipe and used that instead. I dont know if I made the corn syrup right because it wasn't really thick, just sticky but I used it anyway and none of it really stuck together. It's like a big crumbly mess lol but it taste realllly good. I added a pinch of cinnamon to it & it made a huge difference

Yummy!!  Made these with the oats and rice krispies.  But used honey instead of corn syrup.  I also followed the reviewer's advice about the 2/3 cup of brown sugar and honey.  I only used 1/2 cup of smooth peanut butter.  The texture turned out perfect.  I used dried cherries for fruit.  Thanks for a good recipe.

These are sooo good! I had to stop my kids from eating them all up at one time. I used creamy peanut butter and chocolate chips instead of raisins - they melted from the warm corn syrup mixture and gave the bars a yummy chocolate/caramel flavor. I will definitely make these again and again.

I made these for my kids today with a couple of changes - I substituted honey for the corn syrup and sunbutter for the peanut butter because of nut allergies.  I also added a pinch of salt and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Otherwise I used the ingredient proportions exactly as stated.  They turned out tasty - 3 out of 4 of us enjoyed them, they were fast and easy, and I would definitely make them again!    They were a little thin using the 9x13 pan and wanted to fall apart, so next time I'll use a slightly smaller pan and cut smaller (but thicker) squares.    Note that an easy way to press them into the pan is to dump the mixture into it, cover with a piece of waxed paper, and use your hands to press it down.

These are great!  I added 1/2 cup of grapenuts, some almonds, dried cranberries, and rasins.  My family loved them and they're easy to make.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and used wax paper to press the mixture into the pan.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is great!  It has become a favorite in our household.  I swap out the corn syrup and use honey instead because I prefer to not use hfcs.  My kids love 'em.

The best thing about this recipe is how versatile it is!  I followed the recommendation of others to sub honey for the corn syrup.  Changed the cereal to what I had on hand and used regular oats (also because that is what I had).  Added dried cranberries, dried raisins, and nuts.  They were great and the kids love them.  Great for lunches.  I might try it with the corn syrup too, it will be a different flavor.  Great recipe and fun to play around with-you can do so much with this one!  Chocolate chips are next!

Very good.  Only change I made was to use multigrain cheerios instead of rice krispies since I don't have rice krispies in the house.  These are a bit of a pain to stir all together but are worth it.  They didn't crumble much when I cut them, but while I was putting them in the pan I made sure everything was very well squished together.  I think I'd like these more with craisins instead of raisins, but I like craisins better anyway.  Bf enjoyed these as well, so we'll chock them up as another bar cookie success in this house.  Thanks for the recipe.

I prefer to use the corn syrup as the recipe states. Honey just overpowers the flavor so much. I also use whatever cereals I have on hand (mixing them up even), they don't always stick together that well but they sure are good!

I added coconut, ground flaxseed, sliced almonds, dried cranberries, and some mini chocolate chips.  I wanted to use honey instead of light corn syrup, but only had 1/3 c honey in the pantry so I added that + 1/3 c light corn syrup.  Used 2/3 c brown sugar and 2/3 cup peanut butter as suggested by others.  I didn't press it into a 13x9.  Just put a piece of waxed paper on the counter and pressed the mix onto it in a long rectangle.  Then I cut it into long strips - homemade chewy granola bars!

Great recipe!! I always read the reviews before making something (yes, I know it's cheating) but I did mine using some healthier cereals, added flax, etc. However, I did the water & honey thing and I don't think it worked as well as it would if I'd used all honey. My stuff is crumbly yummy granola instead of bars. But I'll take it! And look forward to experimenting more.

Easy and delicious! This is a great basic recipe that you can customize easily to what you would like in it and substitutions are a snap. I used cherry flavored craisins, pecans, and flaked coconut in mine. Will play around with chocolate chips next time.

My kids love this recipe.  I use honey instead of corn syrup.  I also double the amount of honey, brown sugar, peanut butter and vanilla.  It makes the mixture more chewy.  Instead of raisins, the kids wanted dried mixed berries.  We will definitely keep this recipe for use again.  Thanks!

Really good - and FUN - to make with the kiddos. I substituted agave nectar for the corn syrup. You could also use honey as a substitute too. I made 1/2 the batch drizzled with a little chocolate sauce (semi-sweet choc chips, butter, vanilla) for a less healthy version, and I must say it was so delish! Thanks!!

I made these and shared them at work.  Everyone loved them, especially this one guy, so for his next birthday I made him a batch.  He was very happy!  Very simple and versatile...I like to add different things each time like sunflower seeds, goji berries and wheat germ.

These were easy and tasty.  Instead of rice krispies I used 1 cup of Total and 1 cup of Kashi Go Lean and 1/2 cup of puffed brown rice.  These cereal choices make for a healthier snack as far as nutrients go.  Really you could do many variations with this is your base!

Brown Rice Suryp is the biggest change I would make I eliminate any added sugar and just replace the corn suryp for Brown Rice Suryp.  I make a triple recipe each week for my family and we love them but if you want to make them much healthier, get some brown rice suryp from the health food isle, it's expensive but worth it!  Thanks for sharing, love these!

Pretty good! I didn't have rice crispies so I used honey nut cherrios. Still turned out great. I used honey instead of karo syrup & I used 2/3 cup for all the wet ingredients! They still came out a bit crumbly though. NOt dry, but they just didn't stick together too well. I also added a 1/4 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. lemon juice & 1/2 tsp.cinnamon. Made it really yummy!

I have made these several times for us here at home substituting dried fruits, nuts, seeds, haven't had a bad batch of these yet. Recently sent these to my brother-in-law overseas fighting the war. They were a welcome taste of home. Something to send that would make the journey and still taste great when they arrived. I doubled the recipe, used craisins instead of raisins, sunflower seeds, almonds, and a handful of pecans. Fabulous! Thank you!

FABULOUS! What a great granola bar!!! I have made 3 batches of this in just a week! In fact we made a special trip to the store just to get oats for it! I followed other reviewers and used 2/3 cup of honey, Golden raisins with cherries (personal Preference), Brown sugar (I used splenda Brown Sugar) and I only had regular Peanut Butter so I chopped up some nuts and threw them in there... and yummm yumm yummm I wish I could give this more than 5 stars! I will for sure be making these again as for all my friends are in LOVE with them! Thank you!!!!

These are delicious.  I added craisins and a few chocolate chips. I used regular oats rather than quick and the consistency seemed fine to me. I left out the brown sugar altogether and didn't miss it.

Great recipe!  I followed some of the other reviewers idea of 2/3 cup of PB, honey, brown sugar, and raisins.  Even hubby said "not bad" which is a high compliment for anything containing oats!  Kids age 2 and 4 loved them too!

The only changes we made to this recipe were omitting the raisins and using honey instead of corn syrup.  These came out wonderfully!  They did not fall apart, and next time we are thinking of adding chocolate chips to make it a little different.  My husband was skeptical about the peanut butter, but even he agreed that these are delicious and the peanut butter is a *must*.  Will make again and again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was so impressed by the way this recipe came out. I added Craisins and almonds put them in little snack-size plastic bags. Perfect for my small snack weight loss plan.

Excellent bars that can be customized to anyone's taste. I used honey in place of the corn syrup, smooth PB, rolled oats, and added sesame seeds, 1/3 cup each of wheat germ and mini choco chips (after the sugar, honey, pb was mixed in or the chips will melt). I omitted the raisins. Honestly, I thought it was almost too sweet. But I can see where adding dried fruit and/or chopped nuts may help cut back on the sweetness. Next time I'll try adding walnuts and dried cranberries or apricots. Husband and child both loved them.

We LOVE these!  There are six in our family and we ALL love these.  I use half honey and half corn syrup and they seem to be perfect this way.  They taste good with all honey but we prefer it with half honey.  My children like them with chocolate chips but me and my husband like them without so I double the recipe and press them into a jelly roll pan.  Then I press chocolate chips into half of the pan.  This way I can control how many are in each bar.  I wrap them up individually and they stay good for days (if they happen to last that long).

I love this recipe! The kids literally gobble it up and it's easy and fast to make. I omitted the raisins, and use my hands to shape it on a cutting board. Then cut it into granola bars and wrap in plastic wrap.... well the half that isn't eaten in the first hour, LOL.

Yum!  I cut the brown sugar down to 1/3 cup and used half honey and half corn syrup.  I also omitted the raisins and used unsweetened creamy peanut butter.  These are pretty good!

I have made these twice now and  it cant be easier to make. I use 2/3 cups instead of 1/2 cups and use honey instead of corn syrup. I have used trail mix in a batch and choc chips in the other. Took them to a volleyball tournament and not one was left, even the adults enjoyed. Great and healthy snack.

These are so good! I have made several granola snacks for my family and this is the only one that caught their attention.  I did change a couple of things like using rolled 10 grain in place of the cereal. I used a lot more peanut butter, probably double what it called for. I also added flax meal, wheat germ, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries. They were a little dry for bars, but they held together great when rolled into balls. My kids love them and they don't even realize they are so healthy!!

Love this!  Used the 2/3rds ratios like recommended except 1/3 corn syrup and 1/3 honey.  Used craisins and pecans and 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a tad bit of salt.  So easy to make.  At first I thought it was going to be hard to stir but was done in about a minute or so and was no big deal.  Lined a 9x13 pan with oversized parchment paper and sprayed with Pam.  Used a sandwich bag sprayed with Pam to mash it down at the end.  Very easy and so good!  Next time I will try it with just honey. I can see making this a lot! ***Update 2 weeks later: I have made this 3 times and love every bite.  Just use my hand to press into pan.  Still using 1/3 corn syrup and 1/3 honey but now I am out of corn syrup so next batch will be all honey.  My mom couldn't stop eating these either!

Very easy and quick recipe to make.  I used honey instead of corn syrup and added craisins instead of raisins.  I made another batch with coconut, chocolate chips, sunflower seeds, and pecans.  Everyone loves them and they are easy enough for my 9 year old to make!  Thanks for sharing!

Very versatile. We used all honey, doubled the peanut butter, and added 1/2 oz. of baker's chocolate. We added the peanut butter mixture to the cereals and mixed, then rolled it into balls. We call them meatball cookies, which the kids really like.

I made these yesterday and they taste really good.  However, they did not stick together to form bars very well.  Maybe I did something wrong.  But it's very tasty anyway.

I pretty much followed the recipe other than adding my own fruit. I had no problem with the quantity of corn syrup (next time I'll try honey), and the fruit. I used smooth peanut butter, and added dried cherries, chocolate chips, raisins and walnuts. I would like to try some of these choices: honey, more vanilla, coconut, craisins, and apricots. I used wax paper to pat down instead of my hand. It took me about 25 minutes to make. Make sure you use a big bowl for hand mixing. Also my batch made 20 squares. **UPDATE** Just made this a second time but used the honey instead. With honey it fell apart. Since this was my only change I am assuming corn syrup makes the snack stick together better..? Anybody else try both ways?

These were great!  I love these and will make these from now on.  I love how you don't have to spend time baking and can change up the bars and make different varieties.  I didn't have corn syrup so I used honey.  This time I made them with out the raisins but added mini chocolate chips.  They definitely melted but tasted great.  They came out great and everyone at our play group loved them and couldn't get enough.  Net time I will try cinnamon and raisin.  Thanks!

These were quite tasty but I agree with the other reviews that you can be a little more creative than the recipe and add other items rather than just raisens. I also used double peanut butter and honey instead of corn syrup which was the way to go. As for spreading the mix in the dish, do not use a wooden spoon. I used wax paper with a little cooking spray on it and it worked perfecty. I smoothed out the granola easy without having it stick to anything but itself. Also the trick of putting it in the fridge for an hour to cool and cut into squares works really well. :)

YUMMY! I just made these and instead of corn syrup used honey and creamy peanut butter. I also used 2/3 of raisins brown sugar and added chocolate chips. Next time I will add pecans and shredded coconut. This is a VERY easy snack to make and probably alot healthier then the "boxed" ones. To put them in the pan, I sprayed olive oil from my misto on my hands and nothing stuck! :) I have made these and the playgroup granola bars from this site and these are MUCH better. The playgroup ones are cakey and these are not at all.

With all the reviews I was a little hesitant to make this recipe thinking it would be a big sticky mess... it was perfect the way it was written!  I did spray the pan and also sprayed the back of a wooden spoon to help push it into the pan nicely.  Then I put them in the fridge to chill them and THEY JUST DISAPPEARED!  They were a sure fire hit with my kids!  I think I might try to substitute the corn syrup with honey to at least TRY to make them a little healthier.

These are awesome!  Kids (teenagers) love them!  I spayed my hands with Pam and mixed with my hands - worked better than trying to stir.  Same for packing it into the pan.  I'm going to try substituting the oatmeal and raisins with 2 cups of raisin bran next time.

oh, these are delightful.  the crispy rice adds a nice light crunch.  i used 2/3 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup corn syrup, 1/2 cup honey, a healthy glob of creamy peanut butter, (1/4 cup wheat germ and 1/8 cup ground flax seed -- just because), 1/2 cup chopped almonds, 1 cup cranberries, and a handful of chocolate chips. i pressed hard in a coated pan with hands -- no crumbles.  wonderful!

Thanks for all the review comments!  I Loved it.. I sprayed my hand with non-stick cooking spray to press it firmly in.  They were not crumbly!  I used the quantities in the original recipe but substituted corn syrup for honey!  Thanks for the great, yummy recipe!

Fabulous! I didnt have rice crispies so I used cheerios and they turned out great! You could use any type of cereal I suppose. I used 2/3 cup of peanut butter, corn syrup and brown sugar as suggested by another reviewer. Perfect!

these are delish! i subsitute the peanut butter for sunbutter (we have a peanut allergy in the house), use honey in place of corn syrup. i add golden raisins, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds and ground flaxseed. i have made these twice already and don't plan on stopping! oh, the first time i made them like others suggested, i made more of the syrup mix (1 & 1/2 batches) they were great. the 2nd time i made them i didn't make extra and they didn't turn out so good...they were crumbly and didn't hold up well.

I make this granola snack in different variations all the time and everyone asks for recipe.  My favority is with dried cranberries and white chocolate chips.  Although, I did end up making more of the peanut butter mixture because when I added all the cranberries and chips it seemed to fall apart easier.  I went up to about 3/4 cup of each instead of 1/2 cup.

This was good, we enjoyed it...it was maybe a little too sweet, though. I might try adding dried fruit pieces next time. But, overall, it is a very good snack.

Just like Quaker Chewy Granola Bars. I made some with honey, m&m's and mini chocolate chips. You can add almost anything you want. These are really good and a huge hit with my kids! They re also soft enough that my two years olds have no problem chewing them.

I give 4 stars purely on potential, as these didn't work out for me - they crumbled apart.  So I'm doctoring them by adding more PB/sugar/honey, and a bit of salt to counter all the sweetness.  Hopefully they'll hold together now.  
Another tip - if adding chocolate chips, add them AFTER you've poured & shaped the batter.  If you add them when you're mixing everything together, they just melt.  Despite the crumbling, the flavors are great.

These are easy and delicious!  I made half the recipe because they are very sweet and filling.  A great basic recipe that you can add anything to, whatever you have on hand.  Next time I will use honey in place of half the corn syrup because they are very sugary.

These are WAY better than any I've ever bought (will hopefully never buy them again!).  I used almond butter and used some of the other suggestion regarding proportions.  I spread mine into a disposable pan that I re-use (12 1/4 x 8 1/4) and use a heavy rolling pin over parchment to really pack them together).  I let mone sit for at least an hour, then cut into bars.

Perfect chewy granola bars. This is a flexible recipe and I have made it several ways. I substituted honey for the corn syrup--I found that they are plenty sweet and don't need any additional sugar or honey as some reviewers have suggested. Quantites in the recipe work great. I add almonds and dried blueberries and flax seeds about a half a cup of each instead of raisins. Tip: Mix well and after flattening in pan (I use a 1/2 sheet pan with a small lip with parchment in bottom)roll over it with a rolling pin.

GREAT BASE RECIPE!  If you are wondering what I mean by that I mean that this recipe can be changed so many ways and still turn out GREAT!  For a Gluten free friend I changed the crispy rice to spelt puffs and the oat to spelt flakes.  Another time i used almond butter instead of peanut butter and it turned out great.  I've added/subtracted so many things instead of raisins - you can mix nuts, dried fruits.  Just use your imagination!!!

The taste was good but the bars are really crumbly.  I used creamy peanut butter (all I had).  Maybe that could make a difference.

Nice snack and easy to make. Though not necessarily healthy with corn syrup (why does it have to be so yummy though). Anyway. Made my own variation with organic brown rice, brown rice syrup, a bit of wheat germ mixed in as well and then used some cocoa powder in with the peanut butter concoction for a chocolaty taste for the kids and they loved it.

my family loved this recipe.  I did change a couple of things and used splenda instead of sugar (I do not like to use alot of sugar).  I did use honey instead of the corn syrup and it tasted great!  I also used corn flakes instead of the rice cereal and just crushed it up.  It did break apart more than what I wanted it to but my kids loved it that way.  They would sprinkle some in their yogurt and in their cereal to add a little taste.  Thanks

This is a good bar - soft and sweet.  I used honey instead of corn syrup and I think next time I may use 1/2 of each.  The honey taste is very strong.  I used 2/3 cups of peanut butter and added some chocolate chips.  I felt it needed more "stuff" in it.  I would probably double the raisins and then add nuts, coconut etc.  It's missing all that good "filling" in granola bars.  But it's a great start and allows for plenty of personal creativity in what extras you want to add!

Yum! I have to give the original recipe only 4 stars - the amounts are a bit off. To make them 5 star, do the following: 1. ADD almost 1 cup of raisins & some good shakes of cinnamon to the cereal & oats before mixing in the goo. 2. USE some salt - maybe 1/8t., 2/3 cup of brown sugar,  and 2/3 cup corn syrup(Include 2-3 T. of honey in this measurement) - 3. BOIL the mixture for not quite a minute. This seems to make the bars a bit more solid. 4. MIX in 2/3 cup of chunky peanut butter with the vanilla & mix quickly into the dry ingredients. 5. PLOP the mixture onto a large cutting board and shape them into a rectangle, pressing down to half-inch thickness before slicing. When cool, wrap these individually in Saran Wrap. NOTE: I have made these also omitting the cinnamon & adding 1/2 cup of mini M&M's. The only problem is that they melt & get crushed in the warm mix - but taste great.

What a GREAT recipe!  Reminds me of rice krispy treats, but without all the butter guilt!  I did up the recipe to 2/3 cup of raisin, brn sugar, pb, and syrup as suggested by other reviewers to give it that sweet taste.  I also added a couple table spoons full of wheat germ for some added nutrients.  My niece and nephews LOVED it!  My name says it all and I will be making these again!!

This was a wonderfully quick and easy snack, and it tasted GREAT!
I did add 1/2 c. wheat germ and increased the corn syrup and brown sugar each by a 1/4 c. to accommodate the added dry ingredient.  I also couldn't resist balancing my healthy ingredient with some M&M's!  WOW!  My whole family loved them!  We'll be making this on a regular basis, I'm sure.

This was so easy and delicious. I used honey instead of brown sugar. I added the peanut butter to the corn syrup and honey when I heated it (smooth, we don't use chunky). I didn't have enough oats so only added 1 cup of oats, added 3 cups of All Bran Bran Buds, 1/2 cup of dried cranberries and 1/4 cup of white chocolate chips. Turns out that wasn't enough chocolate chips to really taste them but I think I will just leave them out next time as it was so good anyway. I added the Bran Buds to give it a kick of fiber and you couldn't really tell, the crunch could have been peanuts.

These are wonderful!  I used honey, natural peanut butter one time and almond butter another time, oatmeal one time and some left over muesili another.  Each time they are gobbled up by my crew!  Such a wonderfully versatile recipe that has earned a place in our recipe file for ever!  Thanks so much!

I felt this recipe could have used a little less crisp rice and next time I will omit the raisins.

My boys really like these! I subbed mini choc chips for the raisins. I've also made them w/creamy peanut butter instead of chunky.

These turned out great.  I love them.  I didn't have rice cereal, used raisin bran instead and added craisins (instead of raisins, althought the raisin bran had some).  I also used honey instead of corn syrup, worked great.  I lined my pan with foil and sprayed it well with pam.  These were a little crumbly, but still held together.  I do think it is on the sweet side, so I will cut back on the b.sugar next time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Good, but only 4 stars because as the recipe stands, I couldn't get it to stick together.  It just crumbled apart.  I then added honey like others suggested.  I actually ended up making another batch of the sticky mixture to cover the granola, no matter how much I stirred it crumbled apart.  Was better after I added 2nd mixture.

I make this recipe all of the time just to keep it in the house.  I like to experiment by adding different dried fruit and nuts.  As long as you keep the ratio of dry to wet ingredients the same it is wonderful. (if you add an extra 1/2 cup of nuts, take out 1/2 cup cereal)

Wow!  These are awesome.  So easy to make and so addicting.  I listened to what others said and used a mixture of honey and corn syrup (1/3 c honey, 1/3 c corn syrup) and then I used 2/3 c brown sugar and 2/3 c crunchy PB to keep with those portions.  I also added some salt to cut down a little on the sweetness.   The first batch I used raisins and then made another batch with honey roasted peanuts and toffee for fun.  SO good!  Will make these again and again...

I took the advice of another reviewer and used 2/3 cup brown sugar, 2/3 cup honey, 2/3 cup peanut butter and 1/4t cinnamon.  Then replaced the raisins with chocolate chips!  Came out so good but didnt stick too well together.  Excellent recipe though, so cheap and easy!

These taste delicious but may need just a little bit more of the peanut butter/corn syrup mixture--they didn't hold together really well and either stuck together or were really hard when refrigerated--I just crumbled up the pieces and ate on yogurt though!

Super easy to make and a huge hit.  I made these for my daughter's soccer team and the kids and the parents devoured a double batch!  I followed other's suggestions about 1/2 corn syrup and 1/2 honey and I added M&M's instead of raisins.  I let the mixture cool for about 10 minutes before adding the M&Ms.  This helped keep them from melting, but we did crush a few as we tried to mix them in (mixture was stiff) and as we pressed them into the pan.  Next time I would try mini M&Ms because I think those won't crush as easily.  Honestly, though, it didn't detract from the recipe at all.  This was a winner!

Great recipe!!  I used 1/4C.honey and 1/4C. corn syrup.  This made a soft bar that was sweet but not too sweet.  Not as hard as a traditional granola bar.  Added a snack size box of raisins and a handfull of chocolate chips.  I imagine you could use dried cranberries etc in this recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I used honey instead of corn syrup.  I let the honey and brown sugar boil for a minute or two and I also pressed the heck out of these in the pan.  They turned out perfect.  No crumbles at all!  You do have to let them cool a bit before cutting.

We love, love, love these!  I have made them at least once a week for the past month and can't keep them in the house for more than a day!  In fact, my 9 year old had a birthday last week, instead of taking cupcakes to school he wanted to take these. You will not go wrong making these.  I do not like store bought brands and I love these!

Delicious!  I didn't have quite enough Rice Krispies (2 cups), I used dried cranberries instead of Raisins, I didn't have Corn Syrup so I used 1/3 cup of Honey and 1/3 cup of Butterscotch Syrup which adds up to a little more liquid that what was called for.  It turned out great!  This recipe was really easy and everybody in the house loved it!

These were great.  My 2 and 3 year old enjoyed helping me make them and they really enjoyed eating them!  At first, my husband turned his nose at them, "I don't like granola stuff."  But then, I caught him eating it out of the pan.  (He like it!)  I only had creamy peanut butter and used dark corn syrup and it turned out great.  I'll try honey next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! It is still warm in the pan but I can already tell it's the best granola I've made so far.  I used brown rice crisps, "healthy" peanut butter, and honey instead of corn syrup to make it a bit healthier. I'll be making this over and over again.

I love this recipe because it is so easy to make and my family loves to eat it.  I've made it several times.  I substitute honey for the corn syrup and use lightly crushed Special K in place of the rice crispy cereal.

This was so easy to make and I didn't have to turn on the oven. I added crush Fiber One flakes and grounded flax seed to make the granola more healthy and filling. I had to play around with how much of the Fiber One flakes to add since too much made the granola too packy. This is a keeper!

This is a great, versitile recipe! I followed the recipe for the first batch...YUM! For the second batch I used Multi Grain Cheerios, Craisins and apricots. These were a little more substantial....Equally YUM!!  A little tip...if your kitchen is warm, pop the bars in the fridge for awhile.

This is great.  I used 2/3 cup of sugar syrup and pb because i added some extras to the oatmeal mix and didnt want a crumbly bar.  We added crasins, coconut and mini m&ms. Great for preschool class snack.

Easy to make! Addictive! Added 1tbsp flax seed and reduced the oats by 1tbsp. I invited my fiancee to try one and he ended up eating four! Also freezes well between wax paper.  Really need to pack this mixture into the pan so it doesn't crumble.   Less expensive, tastier and comparable amount of calories as storebought versions. I will make this often!

I thought this was okay... It took our family of five a few days to eat it.  I probably won't make it again.

This was a delicious and simple granola bar. I added milk chocolate chunks instead of raisins. Everyone enjoyed them and asked me to make them again.

These were great and super easy to make.  I used Special K instead because that's what I had on hand.  I used natural peanut butter for an even healthier trans-fat free snack.  I accidentally left out the raisins because the directions never mentioned them and I didn't double check the ingredient list.  Next time I make these I'll try some raisins or other add  ins.  Great recipe.

These are great! I had two huge boxes of corn flakes so I used those in place of the rice crispies and I also used dried cherries instead of raisins. My mom tried them and said they were the best granola bar she's had! She ended up taking most of them home with her. Thanks!

These were great!  The list of ingredients calls for raisins, but the directions don't say to put them in, so I just put them in with the oats and cereal.  Yum!  I think I'll try with chocolate chips next time.

This taste like the store bought granola bars for kids, but it doesn't really hold together well.  It is very sticky and easily falls apart in your hands.  I don't think it is very healthy either.  Thank you anyway.

This was a good granola recipe, but I will continue to search for just the right one.  These granola bars did not store well and tended to break apart and stick together rather easily.  I used the specified amount of peanut butter, and although I love peanut butter, the flavor was a bit strong and did not taste as healthy as I would have liked.  I still recommend others try these, just not for me.

This recipe lived up to it's name.  Everyone loves it!  I doubled the batch and put it in a 9x13" pan for a heartier size.  I also cut the raisins in 1/2 and used 1/2 cp. chopped dates.

Very Yummy!  I am making this to take camping with us tomorrow, and I can't keep my fingers out of it!  A teeny-tiny bit dry, but easily adjusted for next time.  I left out the raisins, simply because my kids (and I) don't like them.
Very easy, very good.  Writing this one in the permanent, "to keep" cookbook.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, substituted 3/4 cup of Craisins for the raisins, used honey instead of syrup, added sesame seeds, and used Splenda brown sugar.  All I had was creamy peanut butter. It worked just fine. After chilling for about 30 minutes I cut them into bars, wrapped them in waxed paper, and put them in a plastic contained in the refrigerator. This is a fabulous basic recipe that allows you to create your own preferences into it.  They were a bit sweet, so next time I'll tweak the sugar.

This is a great granola bar recipe! I did substitute honey for the corn syrup. I also switched and put in 2.5 cups of oats and 2 cups of rice cereal. I didn't add any raisins but I did add chopped walnuts and almonds. I also added in chia seeds and flax seeds for the added health benefits. I wrap these in parchment paper and store them in a freezer bag. My husband and kids refuse to eat store bought granola bars anymore!! Thanks for the great recipe

Great quick no-bake snack! Followed recipe but also added about 1/4 cup of unsweetened coconut flakes! Light, chewy and not too sweet. Will make again with chocolate chips and/or other dried fruit like, cranberries or apricots. Will prob add more chopped peanuts, as well,  for some added crunch, as the peanut bits in the crunchy peanut butter aren’t crunchy enough for my liking.

Made these with creamy PB then added a half cup of chopped dry roasted peanuts. Very good. Then raided the fridge, found several nut butters; macadamia, almond and cashew. I did increase the nut butter to three  quarters of a cup. Made three more batches, one of each flavor, added a half cup of dried cranberries to each and quarter cup of cocoa powder to the cashew bars. Super yummy, so don't be afraid to mix it up. Made my MIL smile ???? and her son says they're dangerous, he could eat a whole batch.10/26/18 made these again using 3/4c creamy PB, 1/2c chopped peanuts and dropped crispy rice cereal to 2c. These were the best and didn't dry out as quickly.??

This is a great recipe. But I increased brown sugar and peanut butter to 2/3 cup per other reviews and used 1/3 light corn syrup and 1/3 cup honey or agave. I also add 1 tsp cinnamon. Makes a sticky mess but well worth it! Coat everything in nonstick cooking spray and just use hands to press down into dish before cutting into bars. Have made this recipe many times!

These were great. Per other reviews, I increased the wet ingredients to 2/3 cup and it was perfect. I also used honey instead of corn syrup. Really versatile recipe.

Like other reviewers have mentioned, these aren't very flavorful. It is a nice base recipe. The changes I made were: I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 3/4  cup of toasted mixed nuts (salted for extra flavor and to counterbalance the sweetness), and 1/4 cup of sweetened condensed milk.
One reason why these don't stick together is because of the fat content from the Peanut Butter. In order for your bars to stick, you need a proper fat/sugar ratio to the overall weight of the other ingredients. The addition of sweetened condensed milk changes that ratio and solved that problem. I also stuck them in the oven for 12 minutes @ 375. It's important to let these completely cool in the pan before cutting.

These are so yummy!  I made them exactly as the recipe stated and thought they tasted delicious!  They are chewy yet crunchy and not too sweet.  Delicious!  I may try making these next time with a few chocolate chips added in.

Didn't have corn syrup on hand, substituted with honey and touch of Agave syrup. Also included dried blueberries. Family loved them!

Very good and easy recipe. I used honey and agave syrup instead of corn syrup. It came out really good but a little too sweet for my taste buds. I will try again with less honey and different ingredients. Fun recipe that is ready super quick!
Thanks!

I followed other reviewers suggestions to increase amounts and substitute honey for part of the syrup - they’re delicious but I’d say they are more of a dessert than a snack.

I read many of the reviews and increased the sugar, syrup and peanut butter to 2/3 cup each.  I also increased the dried fruit to 1 full cup, I put in a combination of dried Apricots, cranraisins and raisins to ensure fruit in every bite.  The extra ingredients ensured there was sufficient coating for the dry ingredients.  I put cooking spray on wax paper to press firmly into the pan for a solid bar.  I refrigerated for 30 minutes to be able to serve quickly.  I took these to a function where we have a person who is intolerant to gluten and corn (no corn syrup) so I substituted honey and it worked equally well.  Great snack to have on hand.

I swapped the corn syrup for honey, added unsweetened coconut, almond slivers and hemp hearts. Because of the added ingredients, I used heaping portions of the honey and brown sugar and it all turned out delicious. Holds together well.

I used Rice Chex cereal and 1/4 cup white chocolate chips and 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. Omitted raisins. Used honey instead of corn syrup. Was very good, but next time I would decrease the brown sugar to 1/4 or less if using chips because it was a bit sweet this way.  My came out crumbly, not in bar form. I think if it is pressed into a 9X9 pan instead of a 13X9, I would have gotten bars instead of crumbs.

Sooo good! I can see I'll be making these on at least a monthly basis. My picky eater loved them even with me adding in cranberries and coconut. You can basically add any type of extras (nuts, different cereal, chocolate chips, etc). I mixed together and put into a 9x13 pan covered and left for a couple hours then I cut into rectangles and wrapped in clear wrap.

Made it several times and different variations. Also, sometimes using honey and some molasses. Always came out great. Was a little too sweet for me according to directions. To form the bars I pour the mixture between 2 pieces of oiled wax paper and place a heavy pot on top. Also freezes great and can thaw a pack for the week. Super fast, super easy.

We enjoyed this bar, perhaps too well.  I used half cinnamon Chex and half rice Chex, tastes fabulous.  Chocolate chips work well in this bar.

Awesome! I made it as others had suggested with 2/3 cup of honey, brown sugar and peanut butter. I added a half a cup of chocolate chips. Next time I'll add close to a cup of mini chocolate chips. I can see how this recipe could incorporate so many other great ingredients-totally customizable!!!

These were good - the rice cereal gives them a nice crunch, and keeps the bar light. Like others, I used 2/3 cup of peanut butter, which helped with the binding, and replaced half the raisins with craisins (and used a bit more). A dash of cinnamon also added a lot. 
One problem: the consistency isn't great; the bars are crumbly and don't stay together well.

VERY GOOD - but boiling the honey will kill all of the nutrients.  I warmed the honey and peanut butter together - and it worked out great!

I love this recipe. This is the third time I have made these. I press them in mini muffin tins to make them easy for snacks. That makes them around 70 calories each give or take. I change them up sometimes adding cashews, coconut, chia seeds sunflower seeds and or chopped up dark chocolate. So Jewel777good. Thank you for this recipe. Next time I think I will add macadamia nuts and coconut:)

I cut the recipe in half and added peanuts and craisins. I used honey instead of corn syrup. This is a great and easy snack to make! I made it with a two year old and it was very fun. I think I didn't mix it well enough because there is a lot if crumbs that won't stick.

This was my first time making granola bars and I had seen so many different kinds of recipes I didn't know where to start. I'm glad this was my first one to try, this recipe is perfect and easy and tasty! I did what others suggested and added a little more peanut butter, corn syrup and brown sugar. I made a double batch right off bat and used half rice crisp cereal and half honey bunches of oats cereal. I also added mini chocolate chips. I did this in the beginning and they melted, but it tasted amazing.... if you wanted them whole I would suggest adding them after. Also I used wax paper instead of cooking spray, less mess and easy clean up. This recipe will be a keeper for sure!

These are great!  I also used the honey instead of the corn syrup from the suggestion of SHMANESSA8.  It worked great.  I also used only 2 cups rice crispies and instead added 1/2 cup sunflower seeds.  I also substituted dried blueberries for the raisins.  They turned out great.

These were awesome!!! I made a few changes since I didn't have all the ingredients. I used multi grain Cheerios, honey instead of the corn syrup, dark chocolate chips instead of raisins (they melt and coat the whole bars with yummy chocolate coating, I'm a bit of a chocoholic ;), creamy peanut butter, and added 2 T ground flax seed. I also found it easier to mix with my hands as they were a bit crumbly before I dug my hands in and really got to mixing. The end result was delish!! I will be making these again but I will try a dried fruit instead of the chocolate and rolled oats this time. Defiantly a keeper!!!

These were soooo good!!! Everybody raved over them!! I added to the mix dried blueberries I had laying around along with some flaked coconut and some chopped walnuts. I also used 2tbs of vanilla extract instead of just one, and I used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 corn syrup as I had never used corn syrup before, and it just looked gross, lol.

These were not crumbly at all for me. The secret to that is this:  after I put the granola in the pan, I sprayed both hands with Pam and then pushed it into the pan. I really packed it down nice and tight. THEN, I put it into the refrigerator for an hr, before I attempted to cut squares out of them, then I wrapped them in plastic wrap, and left out at room temp. PERFECT!! And the were alllll gone in a matter of a couple days!
I am making again today, and I cant wait!!!(either can my hubby. He likes to bring them in to his friends at work:-)

These were actually pretty great! I followed the recipe closely and only omitted the raisins as I'm not a big raisin fan. The consistency was good, the flavor was great, and they're so quick and simple to make. This will definitely be my go-to recipe for when I need a granola bar fix, and I much prefer them to the store-bought ones.

This recipe could easily be expanded on with other ingredients, too. Adding some chocolate chips, coconut, cinnamon, and some various nuts would make these exceptional!

Okay but not great.  Peanut smell was a bit overpowering.  Probably better with mini chocolate chips than raisins.  I much prefer the Easy Granola Bars recipe on this site.

I made these exactly what the recipe called for and they are delicious!  I don't understand people changing a recipe all around(unless you don't have something and use a substitute) and then rate it!  Make the original recipe, rate it.. then tweak it and make it your own recipe.

This is a fantastic basic recipe.  Like others suggested, I recommend switching the corn syrup for honey to cut down on the sweetness.  I also took the advice of others to add several other ingredients to include sweetened shredded coconut, dried cranberries, raisins, and sliced almonds.  I didn't measure my own ingredients so I'd say about 2 oz. of each. It takes a little bit to set up but these are really easy, really quick and tasty!

With a few changes these are close to the popular store bought granola bars. The good news is you can control what goes in them. I made this as stated the first time and too dry, so next time I part-way followed one of the popular suggestions with the 2/3 measure on some ingredients. Held together much better. I will continue to work on these over time to get them just right for my family. Good way to sneak in some healthy items on the kids and they won't notice. By the way, I've never liked any homemade granola bar recipe I've made before, but this one was the exception.

These were WAY too sweet for us. I used Kamut puffs (puffed Khorasan, an ancient grain) in place of rice cereal and honey in place of corn syrup, plus added 1 cup flax. The texture is perfect and just like chewy granola bars from the store. They would have been excellent if they weren't as sweet as candy bars. Next time I will try to substitute some other, less sweet binder for the brown sugar.

Just made these and they are delicious and so easy to make.  Used honey instead of corn syrup and added a little wheat germ and flax but otherwise kept the proportions the same.  I had no trouble with them crumbling.

Wow, these are delicious! Can't say I agree with whoever said they were bland, these are way better than the  you buy at the store. I made the recipe as stated, just added a small handful of mini choc. chips. a couple tbsps. each of wheat bran and ground flax to add some extra nutrition (neither has a noticeable flavor). A person could easily customize this base to add whatever. I'm thinking for next time some almonds, sunflower seeds and dried cranberries or other fruit. I pressed the mixture into a lightly greased 9x9 pan, it went in very easily, just be sure to press it in firmly so the bars are intact.

I think this is a pretty good recipe but next time I would not put in any sugar. I used honey instead of corn syrup as well. Otherwise a good recipe and I will adjust it in the future (maybe adding a few chocolate chips or M&Ms). Thanks!

Wooo Hooooo!  Found this recipe and it's a winner!  I LOVE Rice crispies in granola bars and now I can say I've found a replacement for the ones at the store!  I couldn't help myself, though.  As I was bring the sauce to a boil I threw in some marshmellows.  The rice crispies would have been lonely without them!!!

These are SO easy and versatile! I love the fact thet I can mix in whatever I have on hand. I did chocolate chips the first time- after the mixture cooled off a bit. I did add more peanut butter because my family really loves that flavor. I also dumped it out on a cutting board and shaped it that way- much easier to cut. I just bought mini M&Ms for the next batch. Super easy!

The other reviewers are correct, this is really easy, adjustable and yummy! I made some substitutions in direction 1, due to lack of ingredients (chocolate chips for raisins and peanut butter puff cereal for crispy rice), but kept the heated "glue" ingredients the same. It was awesome and my husband woofed down a whole row as soon as he spotted them. Keeper recipe!

Great recipe as others have said, I tweaked it a bit just like everyone else though!  Increased all the 1/2 cup measures to 2/3, left out the raisins, used honey instead of corn syrup, added 1/3 cup each mixed grains, coconut and applesauce.  I wanted a sweet/salty flavor so I added 1 teaspoon of fine grain sea salt--good, but next time I'll try adding roasted & salted peanuts instead.  Rather than bars to be cut, I formed the mixture into little balls and placed them on cookie sheets on waxed paper to dry.  With the applesauce they came out a bit too gooey/wet, so I placed them in a 250 degree oven for 25 minutes, then turned the oven off and let them sit in the oven for about 2 hours--perfect!  Crunchy outside, chewy inside.  Next time I'd cut the peanut butter and applesauce back a bit.

These were great!  I took them to our playgroup and everyone loved them.  Like one reviewer has suggested, next time I want to try to use honey instead of the corn syrup.  I would try to make sure you can eat them within a day or two because they dry out the longer they sit.

Very simple and fast, and it was definitely delicious! I substituted the raisins for cherry craisins, added a little bit of cinnamon, and some pecans. The only thing I would change would be to add more nuts and seeds to make it more like a trail mix bar. It was a lot lighter than I expected.

This was a big unsuccessful mess for me. The brown sugar/corn syrup mixture did not melt for me.

My first attempt at granola bar and it tasted awesome.  I did make a few alterations.  Used honey + maple syrup instead of corn syrup, used kashi (twig like) cereal, and no raisins as I don't like them.  Also added a 1/4 cup or so of white choc chips.  1 cup mixture of pumpkin, flax seeds, nuts, etc.  Wanted to eat it morning, afternoon, evening, night (which is not that good a thing LOL)

These are really good and use a lot of high fiber ingredients.  They are perfect for an after school snack to tide those hungry kids over until dinner.

Ive been forced to make this at least twice a week for the past month for fear of revolt if i dont. These are SO good (i do half honey half corn syrup-packed into a 9X13 pan and refrigerated) and have basically replaced cookies and ice cream in my house. I add some flax seed in there just because i can and no one notices :) lovelovelove them!

Loved them! Used honey instead of syrup due to suggestions. Good, and I like honey, but maybe not THAT much. Will do half honey and half syrup next time.... which is right now :)

I have made these  a dozen times so far. My family gobbles them up within a day or two.  I add chocolate chips and omit the raisins ( just personal taste) .  I also took other  reviewers advice and add a bit more corn syrup and pb  ( 3/4 cup instead of 1/2)  and this makes the bars a little more gooey, which we like.

I really like these. I tried the recipe as is and was impressed but couldn't leave well enough alone. I added some flax and sunflower seeds, rye flakes and meal, millet and a few others keeping the ratio the same and they were fantastic.

These are really yummy. I love that they are chewy. I totally didn't have all the dry ingredients so I added my own mix. I even used cornflakes instead of rice krispies and rolled oats because they are healthier. Yum.

So yummy!  I followed others' suggestions and used honey.  I upped the peanut butter to 2/3 c because I used  a natural peanut butter and it is thinner.  We all loved it!

These are terrific!  I love granola bars and these beat the box granola bars.  I used honey instead of corn syrup and dried cranberries instead of reasons.  Try these you'll like them.

GREAT recipe - My one son doesn't like raisins very much so I substituted mini chocolate chips - they melted almost immediately but it's still yummy!  Next time I'll try making it with honey - what a great recipe with so many combination possibilities!

These turned out great! I used a little more honey than the recipe called for since the oats seemed a bit dry. I used special k cereal and added almonds. My brother absolutely loved them, and now wants me to make them every week :) Thank you so much for this recipe!

Easy and quick.  Less than 10 minutes from start to cool enough to hold together in squares and eat.  The "sauce" works great with any combination of sweet and salty things.  I have used granola, oats, crunched up potato chips, etc.  I would suggest using an 8x8 pan for a nice thick bar.  I also found it easier to cover it with waxed paper and press down into the greased pan than to press it down with a spoon.

These are really good. I like that they are so easy to make, not high in fat, and versatile.   I did the following exchanges (but not b/c it needed it, it is good as is):   Honey instead of corn syrup, Reduced crispy rice to 2 cups- added 1/2 cup grape-nuts, old fashioned oats for quick, Craisins instead of raisins, Added 1/2 cup ground pecans, 1/2 cup  butterscotch chips, 1 tsp. cinnamon 
I expected that my kids would like them (which they do), but my husband- who doesn't normally like granola bars.. REALLY likes them too!!! I am so happy! Good, healthier snack.

These are my favorite, always have them on hand for snacking.  We're not raisins people so I omit those but add chopped almonds, dried cranberries, chocoate and/or butterscotch chips, coconut, miniture marshmallows, or whatever I can think of.  Always great.

These are really yummy!  I used crushed M&Ms and they were a hit.  Only complaint was that arround the edges it was more crumbly that I would have liked.  I did use honey instead.  Seems much better than corn syrup.

These were very good. My 7 year old and her very picky friend made these and loved them. My daughter's friend liked them so much that she ate two and took two home. Next time I will try some of the reviewer suggestions, such as using honey in the place of corn syrup and dried cranberries.

Found the granola bars to be a bit too sweet, so next time I will probably use less sugar. Did as over reviewers suggested and used honey in the place of corn syrup. Added dried cranberries along with rasins, pecans, and coconut flakes.

Yum! Used organic Koala crisp for the rice cereal. Used regular oats. Subbed honey for the corn syrup.  They are very good.  I don't think we will buy them from the store anymore they are so easy to make and I can use organic ingredients (since I can't get organic granola bars where I live).

Mmmm, very tasty! I don't like using corn syrup because of the high fructose in it, so I used agave nectar instead. I did have a bit of a crumbly problem but not too bad. I think next time I will use more peanut butter to help them stick together more and to get more PB taste. I think I'll also add ground flaxseed next time for extra health. I love how easy this was to put together, too, and no baking. Thanks Tinamaries!

Very good, very easy, very high in sugar so not diet food (especially with the number you'll eat in one sitting!).  :) These are a great substitute for the store bought granola bars though and you can easily make them all natural and suit your tastes, plus you can add in other healthy add-ins and they're way cheaper this way.  I followed the basics of the recipe with substitutions to fit our family.  Since we have a peanut allergic child, I used sunbutter (sunflower seed butter, which works the same in recipes).  I didn't have rice crispies so I used a Cheerio-like cereal.  I kept the proportions the same (5 cups dry ingredients with the oats, raisins, cereal) and used a combination of 5 cups of oats, cereal, coconut, dried cherries, finely chopped dates, sesame seeds, walnuts and white chocolate chips.  The sour and sweet with the tart cherries and sweet white chocolate along with the crunch of the cereal and walnuts made them really good.  I greased the pan with olive oil and used wet hands to press it in well, and it didn't stick at all or crumble.    I'll definitely make more, with a mix and match of ingredients each time.  I wrapped ours in waxed paper for quick breakfast/car snacks.

I just got done making these. They are wonderful! My husband wouldn't even wait until they dried before cutting in. I added pecans, m&m, and cranberries to his and m&m, cranberries, and coconut to mine. I will definitely make these again. No more buying granola bars from the store!

My kids and I love this recipe!  The first 2 times I made it seemed like there was too much oatmeal, so the 3rd time I used more peanut butter and it turned out perfect!

I used honey in place of corn syrup the first few times I made this recipe and on a whim thought I would use corn syrup as stated.  I definitey liked it better with the corn syrup, it was less sweet for me.  Also, did as others reviewed and increased the corn syrup, peanut butter and brown sugar to 2/3 cup.  YUMMY!  My husband thinks these are sooo addicting and they don't usually last longer than the day I made them!

Very tasty, I used the honey instead of corn syrup.  And used about 3/4 cup of trail mix (peanuts, almonds, raisins etc) along with 1/4 cup of coconut and 1/4 cup of craisins, yum.  Probably needed a bit more sugar and honey mix, the oats tended to be flaky and crumbly in parts. I will be making these again for sure!

Loved it! lots of good advice on here, though I think the original is pretty right on, lots of ways to cater to your own tastes. The best thing about these granola bars is that you can sneak healthy things in without your kids/spouse knowing. :)

This recipe is one of the best I've ever had, though like everyone else, I've made several changes.  I actually did not have any rice crispy cereal, so I have at times substitued it for bran flakes or even puffed wheat rice (my personal favorite).  I also found I liked a slightly higher ratio of the "sticky" ingredients.  I also substitued the cornstarch for honey and added a little bit more vanilla.  I have made this recipe over and over again, and always get great reviews from the tasters.

I used 2/3 honey (instead of corn syrup) and 2/3 reduced fat creamy PB.  Unfortunately they were pretty crumbly, but still tasty.  I will def make again but will stir thoroughly before spreading in pan.  I used waxed paper to press into pan.

I think this is an excellent snack!  I omitted raisins and used honey in place of light corn syrup.  I also added a dash or two of sea salt.  I'm calling these "Peanutbutter & Honey Bars" and added them to my prized recipe box.  :)  I'll be making these quite a bit!  Next time I'll add extras like raisins, nuts, etc.  Great recipe!

I substituted honey for corn syrup. They did taste pretty good but something was missing. They fell apart and were very messy. I added more peanut butter and honey to try to get it to stick together. Then it had too much honey flavor. Maybe I should cook it a little longer to make it crispier.

These were great. I made a few changes. I used 1/2 c. honey instead of corn syrup. I used a little more than 1/2 c. of brown sugar. I added some slivered almonds and used dried cherries instead of raisins. This is a great recipe for kids to help with. My 3 year-old helped stir the dry ingredients shape the warm granola after it was mixed.  Yum-O.

I have served this granola to both children and adults, and all love it! (I add chocolate chips, dried mixed berries, flax seed, and sunflower seeds to the recipe.) It's a great snack for every age and any occasion.

Pretty yummy.  Passed the toddler test for sure!  Only thing was, I was expecting a bit more of a "granola bar" but instead I ended up with something, I thought, tasted like a peanut butter rice krispie square.  A bit on the sweet side for me though but they held together very well.  Alterations were - Added 3tbls ground flax, I used half honey and half golden syrup (like corn syrup) and increased it to almost a cup, added almost 3/4 cup pb and added a few more raisins.

Best homemade granola bars I've ever had.  They hold their shapes better if you put them in the fridge and only take them out to eat immediately.  I like to make them with honey.

My 5 stars are (like a lot of people's) for the basic recipe.  So easy and versatile!  Yesterday, the kids (2 and 4) helped me make it, and I used 1 cup of Krispies, 1 cup of Kashi Heart-to-Heart, and 1/2 cup of Special K.  I used whole oats, but passed them through a manual nut grinder (done by the 4 YO).  I added 1/4 cup of wheat germ, used 1/3 each of raisins and dried cranberries, used 2/3 cup of br. sugar, 1/3 each of corn syrup and honey, and 2/3 cup of peanut butter.  YUM!  Today I used a slightly different variety of cereal, and cut back on the PB and brown sugar, increased the wheat germ and used all honey.

I mixed the whole thing in a bowl, then turned it out on a foil-coated cutting board and shaped it into a rectangle.  Once cooled, I cut it up and wrapped the pieces individually in aluminum foil for portable snacks (with recyclable wrappers!).

I will do this again and again!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I found that they just didn't hold together enough to cut them, or get them out of the pan. 
The taste was very good, but I substituted cranberries for raisins, and threw in 1/4 cup of toffee chips.
I'd make them again, but I'll increase the proportions of the wet ingredients.

As is, I give it a three, my main complaints being that the recipe is crumbly and very sweet. However, as lots of others have said, I look forward to playing with the ingredients and the measurements of each to get to something that sticks together better, and that doesn't fall apart.

Versatile and delicious. Can make it "healthy" with dried fruit and ground flax seeds- or add chocolate chips, m&m's etc. I ended up substituting equal part honey for the corn syrup, adding 4 Tbls. of flax seed and 1/2 tsp of salt. Formed mixture into block on non-stick cutting board. Waited about 20 minutes, then cut into strips, another 10 minutes to half the strips into bars. This seemed to alleviate the crumbling problem. Thanks for a great recipe.

Pretty good, although I think the recipe needs to be tweeked a bit to my liking. I used Kashi Go Lean - High Protein & High Fiber Cereal in place of the rice cereal. I also added some flax seed and replaced some of the corn syrup with honey. It's a good base recipe to play around with. I'm excited to try another batch.

Tastes really good but never really got hard enough to cut into squares. Every time I tried to cut them they just crumbled. Still good though.

Just made these bars on a whim because I had all the ingredients on hand.  Very easy and fast to make!  The only change I made was that I used 1/4 C. corn syrup and 1/4 C honey.  The kids love them, and I do too!!  These will be a regular snack in our house!  Thanks for sharing!

Healthy baked goodie, but we got tired of eating them once we were 3/4 the way through the pan.  I used dried carnberries in place of raisins, and they were yummy.

These were awesome!  I made the recipe exactly aw written except that I bought creamy peanutbutter instead of the crunchy by mistake.  I didn't have any trouble with them crumbling - I wonder if substituting honey for the Karo syrup has something to do with that??  Anyway, we loved them.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is such a delicious recipe! When I was in junior high school we were served granola snacks, that I loved, and have been looking for a recipe similar to that for years! I'm glad I found this one! I took other people's suggestions and used 2/3 cup honey instead of corn syrup, 2/3 cup peanut butter, 2/3 cup brown sugar, and I added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans, and 1/4 cup shredded coconut. My husband loved it, between the two of us, this only lasted about 3 days! I would definitely make this again!! Thank you!

Well I followed the recipe for the syrup/peanut butter mixture, but instead of all rice crispies I used half cheerios too. Once everything was mixed and in the pan I just knew they were going to crumble so I winged it from there to see if they would hold up better with some changes. I preheated my oven to 350. Melted 1/2 C butter with about a 1 1/2 tsp (I didn't measure I just sprinkled in to my taste) poured over granola bars. Sprinkled some semi-sweet chocolate chips over this and popped into the oven until chips were nice and ready to spread. I spread the chocolate chips over the mixture (I know time consuming...) and let it cool. They definitely held their shape better. Tasted pretty good too.

Yummy....taste was great....they just dont hold together that great when cutting. I did sub honey for the syrup, and mini choco chips for the raisens. Maybe the corn syrup holds the bars together better. I also added a handful of sunflower seeds. I will try with the corn syrup next time, but the peanut butter taste is excellent.

I added chopped almonds and dried cranberries, and took out the peanut butter, turned out pretty good. i substituted honey for corn syrop, but i think they'd turn out better with corn syrop.

I like it, but I couldn't sell my kids on it.  I'm still going make them eat them as an after school snack because it's better then all the processed snacks out there.  Hopefully the recipe will grow on them.

This is good stuff!!  I made my first batch using the corn syrup, as I was out of honey.  I also used Choco-Nilla Krispies, which was a wonderful substitute!  My second batch was made with regular Krispies, Craisins, cinnamon chips instead of chocolate and honey rather than corn syrup.  I took it to my daughter's preschool for snack, and all the kids asked for more!  The possibilities are limitless for what you can add to this recipe.  I also just dumped it onto wax paper, shaped into a rectangle by hand, and refridgerated. I will be trying lots of variations I'm sure!

These were very good, like a glorified rice krispie treat.  I am only giving it 4 instead of 5 stars, because the instructions left out what you are to do with the raisins.  I just threw them in with the dry cereal.

I made these for a camping trip with my family and the entire batch went in two days. The only change I would make next time is add more peanut butter, and possibly add other dried fruits for variety. The directions fail to mention raisins, but it was easy enough to mix them in after pouring the peanut butter and sugar mixture. They were a little sticky and some were hard to keep together, but the bars certainly lived up to their name!

No funky ingredients, so easy and so tasty...what else could be better.  I subbed 1/2 c coconut for 1/2 c of the oats and used choc chips instead of raisins.  Even my hubby (a granola bar hater) loved these!  Will try raisins and cinnamon next time!

These are sooooo good! I omitted the raisins, and added butter scotch chips in the end instead. I also used creamy peanut butter, as I didn't have the crunchy kind. they came out so light and airy and crispy delicious! Next time, I will try to make them with chocolate chips. They really are very good and sooo easy and quick to make! Honestly, even better than the store bought granola bars no kidding!update:... I found the best combination was to make them with white chocolate chips and raisins... Amazing!

I followed the recipe pretty carefully(using other's suggestions, where i noted helpful). i doubled the recipe, and for one person it mightve been a little over-the-top, and didnt measure exactly(with the sugar concoction) as i didnt want a crumbly mix as others had warned about. i found with the measurements i used it was a bit sweet and really soft(which i did like). i added some coconut, walnuts, slivered almonds and a few sesame seeds. i also put some carob chips on the bottom for a chocolatey fix. i lined the pan with foil which i found helpful!
what i liked about this recipe is its the first time ive ever made granola bars and it was very easy, and hard to screw up! it tastes very light(prob b/c of the rice krispies), which makes it perfect.
i will definitely be making this again.
thank you.

I used corn flakes b/c I didn't have rice cereal.  My husband and I really liked them.  2 of the kids thought they were Ok.  One didn't like them (she is super picky.  I would add more nuts and dried fruit.  I did like the peanut butter.

These are great! I was tired of spending so much money for boxed granola bars, so I checked here for a recipe. Made these this morning, and I know that I will never go back to the boxes. They were a snap to make, and you can easily change the ingredients to suit your taste. You can even make them high fiber by using a high fiber cereal or sneaking in some flax seed.

This recipe is just too easy to make and tastes better than the granola bars that I buy!  It is a tad addictive which is not the best for me but other than that - I will defintely make it again.

This is a total hit with my family!  We tend to go through alot of store-bought granola bars, so I'm thrilled to find a substitute that is cheaper and tastes even better!  My Kindergartener proudly told everyone at school "My mom knows how to make granola bars at home!"
I made a few of the substitutions that were mentioned by other reviewers:  I used honey instead of corn syrup and I omitted the raisins and pressed mini choco chips into the top instead.  They were a little crumbly--next time I may substitute only half of the corn syrup for honey and see how they turn out.
Thanks, TinaMarieS--and be sure to thank your sister-in-law for me!

These are a big hit at my house.  I substituted choc chips for the raisins but you could add just about anything you like.  Prep time was only about 15 minutes at the most.  I used a sheet of wax paper to press them firmly into the pan and was cutting and serving them in about 30 minutes.  Instant gratification!  Good lunch box snack.  UPDATE: I made these again and this time instead of raisins I used both Craisins and chocolate chips.  Also, substituted honey for half the corn syrup.  They were gone FAST!

These were good.  I personally didn't like the peanut butter in them, so if I were to make it again, I would probably try to do a honey mixture or something.  Thanks!

These were really good!  Not too sweet and a good snack for kids.  They were a little crumbly...not sure if it was something I did or if thats how they are.  I know the ones you buy in the store are crumbly.  I will definitely make these again!

These sound great!  Any ideas for semi-long term storage?
