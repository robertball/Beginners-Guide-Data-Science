A chicken fried steak does not have chicken.  It is called chicken fried because it is fried with a batter on it like chicken  :)

Loved this comfort food! I did add a little garlic and some seasoning salt to the flour and deep fried it as well. Awesome! To help the batter stick together- after coating the steaks, I put them in the fridge for 30-60 minutes. They were perfect. This recipe is very versatile as well. You could use any kind of thin meat, IMHO.  Thanks for sharing!

This was super easy and fast. I didn't make the gravy because of time but the chicken fried steak was really good.

This was AWESOME! I added some cayenne for a little kick, I think 1/2 tsp...wonderful! This was the first time I have made chicken fried steak and this will be my go-to recipe from now on! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Not wowed by this. The breading was good, although my family prefers a bit more salt. I guess we are just used to the traditional cube steak version. The steak tenderloin version here is just too strong a beef taste. I like a more mellow beef flavor for this particular dish. Sticking with cube steak next time, but will use the breading recipe again with more salt.

I made this with Bob's Red Mill gluten-free all purpose flour and cube steak.  My kids and husband GOBBLED IT UP!!  I used the same recipe to make chicken fried chicken breast for me, which I gobbled up.  Since we don't do dairy, we skipped on the gravy, but it was still AWESOME!  This will definitely be our go-to for chicken fried foods!

The breading was delish!  I refrigerated the steaks after breading for about an hour to make sure it stuck.  Cannot give it a 5 as I was in a time crunch and used packaged peppered gravy mix.  Next time, and yes, there will be a next time, I will make the gravy as the recipe suggests.  Definitely a hit with me & the Mr.

It was "OK". Just like all other recipes that require a coating, I could not get a nice thick coat. Alot of it came off during the frying process. It was very messy to make and we all agreed I shouldn't make it again. I'm sure if you know how to coat food properly it would be good. The taste was not bad but not fantastic either. Disappointed.

Fabulous!  Really tasty comfort food.  After loving it as is I tried it with cubed pork steaks, and it was OK but not nearly as good as beef.  Definitely a keeper!

My son wanted this for his birthday. I followed directions exactly. It was so awful, we and our guests took all but 2 bites and tossed it. Think I'll look for another recipe. So disappointing and sad and costly. Such a waste of everything.
