Very tasty.  I made it in the crockpot and let it simmer all day.  The chicken was so tender.

This recipe is really good but tastes similar to chicken Jeruselum.  In a saucepan, I warmed the soups, sour cream, wine and spices and stirred until smooth.  Then, I placed the chicken and mushrooms in the baking dish and poured the mixture on top.  Approx 5 min before chicken was done, I steamed chopped broccoli and sprinkled over the top and served all over angel hair pasta.  Very tasty and would recommend.

I changed nothing. It was AWESOME. This is truly a five star if ever there was a five star. Nothing hard to do, common ingredients, and it tasted liked it took all day to prepare. My wife really likes this one and asked that we have it again soon. Can't say enough good words. I read reviews, but, like so many others I felt I have to make it as described to know what if anything needed changing. NO Changes here. Thanks for the great recipe Mary Ann.

great recipie.  an easy substitution for the wine is chicken broth because it really needs the liquid.  for some additional flavor I add white pepper.  I have made it over and over again.

A really tasty sauce over chicken served with egg noodles!  I also cut this recipe down, used cream of mushroom soup, wine, sour cream, and real garlic.  I browned the chicken in a splash of olive oil and garlic and onion before adding to the sauce in the baking pan.  The sauce is very tasty, the entire dish came together quickly and easily.  I will definitely make this again!

This is probably the third or fourth chicken/cream of whatever soup/mushroom dish I've made, and I would definitely say it's the best. The  sour cream and wine (I just used a splash of wine, as it was cheap plonk) really gave it a pleasant richness. I didn't have much time in the kitchen so I browned bite-size pieces of chicken in olive oil, added the onion and mushrooms, and cooked til soft, then stirred in the sauce ingredients. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe!

Very good, quick way to use leftover chicken. For two people, I used 1 can of mushroom soup and about 1/2 cup sour cream (low fat), 1/3 cup wine. Sauteed green onions with the mushrooms, added the liquids and simmered for 10 minutes, then added chopped up leftover roast chicken; I also added some seasoning salt (Pappy's Choice).  That added some punch.  Served over rice.

Made this last night and it was great! I used a large can of Cream of Mushroom instead one of each (not too fond of the cream of chicken). I also served this over egg noodles. When doing the chicken, I was aware of folks saying the chicken was kinda bland or dry so I sprinked some Johnny's seasoning over the chicken. Chicken was still dry but had good flavoring. Once it was done I cut the chicken into a bunch of bite size pieces and mixed the noddles and chicken with the sauce. Next time I think I'll cut the pieces of chicken prior to cooking and mix them in with the sauce to cook.

My boyfriend and I loved this! It was quick and easy, but tasted rich, like it took a long time to make.  I used light sour cream and soups, which turned out great. Also used full amount of wine. Served w/biscuits (very good over) and will make pasta with next time! Thanks for sharing this recipe, its even great as leftovers.

This tasted a lot like cream of chicken helper.  1 used 1 cup of sour cream which was plenty and I replaced the mushrooms with fresh steamed broccoli.  I cut the chicken in cubes and cooked on the stove top which took half the time and was juicy.  Was quick and the kids enjoyed it.

This is one of my favorite meals from home, but I've always just had it with one can of cream of mushroom mixed with 8 oz sour cream, poured over chicken and baked.  This seemed like a good way to fancy it up.  I scaled to three and going by the previous suggestion used one can cream of mushroom, 8 oz sour cream and 1/3 cup white wine.  I think because I'm using cheap cooking wine, the wine taste was really overpowering.  Next time I'll just a small splash.  Other than that, it was really good.  I served it over white rice.

I put this recipe in my RecipeBox about nine months ago and just now decided to give it a try.  WHAT WAS I WAITING FOR!!!!!  This was so easy and tasty!  Just splendicious!  I used chicken broth instead of the wine and may try low sodium soups next time.  I agree with previous reviews that there's a lot of sauce.  I had 2-3 cups of sauce left when the chicken was all gone, so I may try 7 or 8 chicken breasts next time (and there will definitely be a next time...real SOON!)  Thanks Mary Ann!

This was a wonderful dish.  We used Egg noodles and instead of wine we used milk.  That was really good.  We are not big drinkers, but my hubby would like me to try the wine kind for a more authentic Italian flavor.  It was great and easy!!!!

What a great recipe!!  I easily had everything in the house and my fiancee can't say enough about it.  In fact we are having it Thanksgiving along with the Turkey!  I think those that rated it poorly are definately trolls....I recommend this to everyone and several of my friends are raving about how good it is!  Yummy!  Oh I did add 1 cup of wine...easier to meaure out.

Followed the recipe except for using fat free sour cream and one can low sodium soup--so easy to make, nice flavor, and my husband raved about it!!  With regard to the abundance of sauce, I removed the chicken from the sauce when done, and dumped in some almost-cooked pasta, and it soaked that sauce right up to make a yummy accompaniment to the chicken.  If I don't make this again I'll be in trouble!

very successful for dinner party.  Suggest cooking the onions unless very finely chopped.  I added herbs from garden and worstershire sauce.  After baking sauce is liquidy but will thicken in a few minutes.  Served with curly pasta

Very simple, but very tasty!  I subbed frozen peas for the mushrooms (don't like mushrooms, and the peas were on hand.) I also added one small can of diced green chiles, which upped the heat and flavor.  Whenever I bake chicken, I do so with the lid on the baking pan; I think it helps keep the chicken moist.  Perfect for a stress-free dinner party.

I thought this was very tasty.  I only used 1 can of soup as some others suggested, plenty of liquid.  I browned the chicken & onions in olive oil, salt & peper then added to the rest.  My kids eat this.  I'm adding it to my faviortes.

Easy, quick, tasty, not much cleanup.  Just my kind of recipe.  Chicken was very tender.  Next time I make this I will add something for color like broccoli or peas, otherwise it was excellent.

Tastes great.  I have made it several times, each time trying something different.  Less wine is definitely the key in making it a thicker consistency.

Wonderful recipe!  I did not use any cream of chicken soup, used half the amount of sour cream, used fresh garlic and doubled the mushrooms.  I usually make a complex, time consuming chicken scallopini recipe, but from now on I will use this as it is way less work and tastes very similar.  Delish!

Iffy...

The sauce was kind of gross.... too sour cream-y for me.  And I love sour cream.  I just wasn't wild on this.  I served it on noodles.  A bit too saucy.

I made this and cooked it my slow cooker and it turned out real well.  My husband loved it and there was almost no time involved in preparing it.  A great mid-week dish.

This was a very simple and delicious recipe.  I did find it slightly bland so I added 3 cloves fresh garlic, red pepper flakes, and cajun seasoning.  Served with egg noodles and french bread and everyone really enjoyed it.

This was a pretty good soup/cream and chicken recipe, but the ratio of sauce to chicken was really off.  Way too much sauce!  Such a shame to waste it!  I halved the recipe so I only used the cream of mushroom soup, but next time I think I'll half the sauce and use more chicken.  Otherwise, pretty tasty!

I just sometimes don't understand the criteria with which people rate recipes.  This chicken is easy to make, fairly healthy especially served with just steamed broccoli since the sauce goes well with the vegetable, and it's not bad, but certainly not an amazing awe-inspiring dish.  It's standard fare for a busy work night when one wants something decent and healthy and easy to make.  I seasoned the breasts with salt and pepper before baking and substituted light sour cream.

I can't imagine anyone not liking this dish.  It is so simple and fool proof.  I guess the only downside would be that it does take an hour to bake.  JUST TRY IT!!!

This was tasty. I prepared it in a saucepan on the stove instead. I also didn't have enough sour cream, so i finished the measurement with cottage cheese. I also added a splash of Cardamon and Ground Savory. Then i served it with a side of Dill and Buttered Carrots. Yum!

Awesome recipe.  I divided it in half and didn't find the 1/4 cup wine too much at all.  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and because I divided it in half I used one full can of mushroom soup instead of half each mushroom and chicken!
Thanks for the recipe!!

This was just ok, I forgot the onion(oops) so it may have been better......way too much wine, I think half the wine would be better(And I LOVE to cook with wine!!!) May try this again & doctor it up a bit.

Very tasty dish.  Made only a couple changes.
1/4 teaspoon of black pepper, and I substitued 1/2 cup of White Zifandale instead of 3/4 cup of Dry White Wine.

Was easy to prepare and will make it again.

I found this recipe to be quite tasty. I added sliced zucchini, chopped red bell pepper and I sliced the 6 chicken breasts! The sauce was a little runny but it tasted great over spaghetti noodles!

This was okay.  I used the sour cream I had in the fridge and it was fat free.  I think it made the sauce really salty and kinda funny tasting.  If it was full fat or even low-fat sour cream I think it would have tasted more rich and flavorful.  The chicken was a bit overdone so I cranked up the heat and cooked a bit shorter.  It made a ton of sauce and it was real thin, so I skimmed off the top some extra fluid and let it sit while my pasta and veggies finished cooking, giving it time to "set up".  All in all, it was a tasty dinner, but I would probably not make this again unless my boyfriend asked me to.  Thanks for the recipe though :)

This recipe was very tasty.  We did not have any wine in the house so I used milk like others suggested.  There was plenty of sauce to use over noodles, or maybe rice would be good too.  Thanks for the yummy recipe.  We will definetly prepare it again.

This was DELICIOUS!  It does make a lot of sauce, but it was excellent served over noodles as a sidedish with dinner the next night.  My husband always complains that chicken breasts get too dry in the oven, so I might try chopping the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces next time.  Will definitely make this again.

This was awesome and so easy to make. I thought it sounded blah, but was I surprised. Chicken could also be cut into bite sized pieces and then everything served over noodles or toast (similar to stroganoff but even better). I didn't really measure the sour cream or wine and it turned out beautifully. I cannot recommend this one enough!!!

This dish was simple to prepare and using wine added depth and interest to the sauce.  Definitely serve with something green!

Yummy! The white wine definately gave it an extra something. Love all the extra sauce, perfect on a bed of noodles.

This was a very tasty meal. I made this with everything it called for except I used the chicken broth instead of the wine and it was excellent! I also did this on the stove top instead of the oven and then served it over pasta. Yummy!

Excellent!  The first recipe that has inspired me to comment.  I did substitue fat free sour cream and heart healthy soups but it was still excellent. The white wine was just enough to bring the taste up above anything someone would think had canned items for ingredients.  Highly recommended.

This recipe went over great with my husband and kids!  Even my picky four year old devoured the entire bowl without complaint!  Only thing I would do differently next time is cut the white wine from 3/4 to 1/2 cup as it was a little on the strong side just for my personal preference.  My husband kept comparing the flavour to a good swiss cheese and loved every bite!  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Both my 11 y/o daughter and I loved this. I didn't have the chicken soup or any white wine (strangely) at the time so I used equal parts mushroom soup and chicken broth for 3 breasts and 1 cup sour cream. The breasts came out really tender. Served it with Rotelle. Delicious! I want to try it with the wine and chicken soup to compare.

I thought this was very good. Instead of garlic salt I added fresh garlic which added to the taste. When I first made it, it was a little bland. Would absolutely make it again.:-)

Delicious!  I'm giving it 4 stars only because this dish, while lovely, seems to me to be in need of some underlying complexity of flavor that just isn't there.  I added a generous amount of fresh basil to the left-overs and that was nice . . . will try adding dry herbs to the mix next time.  I made this in the slow cooker and it was super moist.  Also added a package of crimini mushrooms . . . very nice with the creamy wine sauce.  : )

Even though at first I totally messed this recipe up I managed to save it and it was wonderful. I served mine with green beans and roasted baby Dutch potatoes and it was a hit. One note: use a shallow baking dish like the recipe states, not a deep one like I tried to. Your chicken just will not cook in that one hour in the deeper dish. Lesson learned!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I used chicken broth instead of wine, and let it cook all day in the slow cooker.  **Update**  I made this again using wine and in the slowcooker.  Tasted better than with chicken broth.

This dish had a decent flavor, however it just came out too runny for my taste. I'd definitely omit the extra liquid and cook the onions beforehand. They came out crunchy as well.

I though this was pretty good! The sauce was a little rich and I would probably cut back a little on the wine next time since that was the strongest flavor in the dish. I might even add some peas next time for color. All in all it was a fast simple meal that tasted pretty good!!

Very tasty.  I followed the advice of others and laid off the wine a bit - did 2 cups.  Would actually lay off it a bit more, perhaps 1.5 cups, with 1 cup chicken broth.  I served over cavatini and my family gobbled it up.

This was not a very tasty dish.  There was too much sauce. With the amount of white wine suggested, it should be called white wine chicken.  I would also brown the chicken rather than baking raw in on top of the sauce.  I would also use sour cream to taste instead of 2 cups coupled with 2 cans of soup.  I wouldn't use this recipe again.

This was OK but I should know better then to cook with wine for my husband. As soon as I put it on the table he smelled it. It is a good recipe, this was just a personal dislike for wine.

Yum! I’ve always been a fan of “cream of” recipes since my mom always made them growing up so this is right up my alley. So I almost made this as written but didn’t have wine so used chicken stock as others suggested. I’ll try wine next time or maybe add a pinch of boullion powder or poultry seasoning to the stock as it lacked a little flavor. The only change I’d make to the written recipe is to double the mushrooms! When I had the leftovers the next night I sautéed my leftover mushrooms and added them on top and it was even better. Can’t wait to try this in the crockpot. I’ll be making this over and over!

I only had 2 breasts, so cut the recipe down but next time I will  use a full cup of mushrooms.  I liked the idea of the Balsamic  chicken and it truly made it good.

This was quite good.  It's not something I would make frequently, but it was easy, and something different to do with ingredients I had on hand.  I would suggest pounding out the chicken breasts until thin.   We prefer a bit more flavor, so next time, I will add paprika.

I made it using chicken broth and not white wine and I still liked it very much. Will make it again and again.  Will try it with wine next time to see if there is any appreciable difference.

I used 3 cloves chopped garlic instead of garlic powder, and I used 2 medium shallots instead of the onions. Also, I used 1 pound of chicken tenders and 1 pound of boneless skinless thighs. The aroma was delightful when cooking. I baked it uncovered for 1 and a half hours on 350 degrees. Jasmine rice was what I placed on the plate topped with the chicken and sour cream mushroom sauce. Broccoli as a side works well. All ingredients were organic, and GMO free. Deliciously aromatic dish enjoyed by all. Will repeat this one with with changes I made for sure!

This was good.  I served over garlic buttered noodles. Next time I will put in a larger baking dish because the sauce bubbled out & I had to clean my stove after baking.

WAYYY too.. tangy? I was really hoping it would be more like that brand of sauce called "Chicken Tonight". However, my husband kinda liked it. But, probably won't be making again.

Would be a great crock pot dish. Chicken was bland. Sauce was semi tasty. I suggest sauté mushrooms and onions and use fresh garlic in lieu of garlic powder. Remove garlic onions and mushrooms and set aside. Brown chicken in a dash of olive oil. After chicken is browned add the vegetables back in the pan.

Way too much sauce! Also, because you put the chicken on top, it ends up having no flavoring. If I make this again, I will saute the onions and mushroom; salt, pepper, and garlic powder the chicken and brown it before putting it in the sauce. More mushrooms, too!

The chicken was moist and tender but lacked flavor in a big way.  And the wine flavor was way too much for our taste.  We ate it but would not do this recipe again.

The only change I made to the recipe was to use light sour cream. It was fair and on the bland side. I think 2 cups of sour cream might be a bit much. I was hoping for more of a stroganoff flavor. While everyone in the family ate the dish, most were in agreement that it was just okay.

My kids loved it!  And they are picky!  Since they do not like mushrooms I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup.  I also did not use the chopped onion.  It does make a ton of sauce so you can either 1/2 it or just use the extra another day.  I put it over egg noodles and brown rice, both were good.  Thank you for this great recipe!

This is a delicious recipe. I also warmed everything in a pan before adding it to the chicken. I had a lot of extra sauce so I fried up some ground beef and mixed it together for lunch the next day. I almost enjoyed the leftovers even more than the entree!!

This was very good but like many other have said, somewhat bland.  That being said, this recipe is going to be one of my regulars now.  Easy and my husband loved it as well!  The only change I made to the recipe was that I only used cream of mushroom soup since that's all I had on hand and the sour cream was low fat.

It was slighty bland but still good. I thought there was too much sauce. I used shallots instead of onions and added more garlic powder and pepper. I am going to make this again but just keep adding more flavor to it because my kids loved it.

The sauce was really tasty, and there was a lot of sauce.  I would have liked it a bit thicker, but if cooked long enough (taking the chicken out) it thickened up.

I didn't like the taste of this at all.  Way too much sauce, and it was bland.
