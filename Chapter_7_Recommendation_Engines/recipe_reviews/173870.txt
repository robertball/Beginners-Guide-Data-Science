This was sooo yummy! I can't remember the last time I had a sandwich this good and filling at the same time. We took a turkey breast, boiled it with onion salt and garlic powder until it fell off the bone. Took some club rolls split them just enough to lay them flat. Toasted them under the broiler for five minutes. Then we placed some turkey, a slice of swiss and put them back under the broiler until cheese was melted. Then a slice of bacon, lettuce, and roasted red peppers. The chipotle sauce we used mayo, chipotle marinade (that's what we had on hand) and a tiny bit of chilli powder. I really did feel like I had ordered the sandwich from a menu. It was wonderful! Served this with Old Fashioned Potato Salad also from this site.
