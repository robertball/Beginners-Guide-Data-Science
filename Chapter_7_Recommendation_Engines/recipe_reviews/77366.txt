This recipe doesn't work as it is written. Althought the bread doesn't need a yeast packet, it does need 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.  Also, although I let the bread dough rest for an hour, I don't think that that is necessary(after all there is no yeast). I also think that the baking pans should not only be greased but also floured.  With these changes the resulting bread is quite delicious.  A true polish delite.

After some minor tweaks (like adding some baking powder for lifting power and more walnuts for extra flavour and texture) this bread was truly delightful and has become a staple in my family. Best eaten warm with butter. Just delicious! And the aroma that fills up your kitchen as it's baking is heavenly too..Thanks for posting..

I followed this recipe to a T, except that I poured all the batter into a 9 x 13 casserole pan.  I made it for mother's day, and everyone loved it.  It truly tasted authentic.  My 80 yrd Polish Grandpa said it was the best he had ever tasted.  I might try using this dough for cookies at x-mas time. The dough has a gingerbread taste to it.

I served this to my Polish friends, and they loved it, and said it was like the piernik in Poland. I did make some changes. I followed the advice and added 1/2 tsp of baking powder and I did not let it rest for 1 hour. After it was cooled, I divided the loaves into three layers. I sprinkled two of the layers with a bit of brandy and then spread them with plum butter. After re-assembling, I covered the entire cake with a chocolate ganache.

We loved this bread - a wonderful surprise taste of honey lingering in your mouth - I added apricots and it worked well at a church breakfast

I love the taste of the honey, nuts and rasins. I eat it with peanut butter for dinner.

This recipe was great!!!!  I omitted the raisins, just because I'm not a fan.  I'm glad I added walnuts though because they added some texture and flavor.  I love the spices in this bread!  I think dried cranberries or "craisins" would be good in this bread!

I grew up eating this as a child and was excited to find the recipe. I did follow the advice of a reviewer and added 1/2 tsp. baking powder. I also agree you need to grease and flour the pan. My family ate half of this up for breakfast and finished it off later with coffee. We all thought it tasted best when we heated up the slices in the toaster oven first. Mmm!

This came out great! I was born in Poland but moved here at 9 years old and this is very similar to what my grandmother used to make. Definitely a keeper!

Autentyczny! says my Polish spouse. Used still-liquid honey so didn't have to heat it or let the batter sit. Added 1/2 t b. powder, 1 c. OJ-soaked raisins. Made 1 thick loaf + 1 8x8" pan.

2 7 18 ...http://allrecipes.com/recipe/77366/piernik-honey-bread/ ... Keep in mind, this is bread, not cake; & if you expect typical quickbread, open your mind.  It isn't typical.  It's good though, just different.  The texture is similar to rye bread; dense & dry.  The honey is subtle, just right.  Very relieved that it can be tasted.  Other recipes with honey have been disappointing.  Spices are even more subtle; highlights the honey.  As another reviewer did, I baked in a bundt pan, an hour five.  My thinking was if I don't like it, I'd rather wash one bundt pan than four small or two larger loaf pans.  With that, it does mess with your mind a little - looks like cake, tastes not.  'Really glad I tried this.  'Finding recipes for crystallized honey aren't common.  Thanks!  Ohhhhh, I almost forgot.  Because i think I know things sometimes, I changed directions.  I combined the sugar & spices.  Whisked the oil & eggs together; added milk then added that combination to the sugar blend.  I also added the baking soda as well as a half t baking powder & salt to the sugar mixture - before adding the liquid.  If I make again, I'll add those to the flour - or not. ;D  No raisins or nuts; nothing against them.  'Only mixed with a whisk for about five minutes; rested an hour; poured in greased & floured pan.  PS HI SUZYQ!  ;D ... 'More I have of this, the more I like it - especially toasted with butter.  Here's another star!  Thank you!

Fabulous recipe - not too sweet and just the right amount of spice.  I made half this recipe which was the perfect amount to make 4 small bundt cakes (using my Nordic Ware Bundt Quartet pan.)  Reduce the baking time significantly should you do this.  Also, I added a little baking powder, didn’t bother boiling the honey, stirring for 10 minutes, or waiting an hour.  I mixed all dry ingredients in one bowl, mixed all the liquid ingredients in another, and then combined, stirring in the walnuts and raisins at the end.  When the bundts had cooled, I dusted with a very light coating of powdered sugar for appearances.  I actually planned to freeze all but one so I’d have something on hand should a friend drop by for coffee, but frankly, they won’t last that long.  This is a keeper.

This is delicious!!!  I did take the suggestion to add baking powder.  I also baked mine in a bundt pan, which turned out perfect!!  It actually finished baking in an hour using the bundt pan, which was nice as well.
