I love zucchini "noodles", but this recipe can be simplified. Just use a potato peeler to make thin strips (discard the core/seeds), and sauté in a little olive oil. Sprinkle with sea salt and pepper to taste, and add sauce or grated Parmesan as desired.

I have always admired this when I've seen it done in restaurants so I was happy to find this recipe so I could duplicate it at home. Cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the "noodles" and in my case one minute was too long. I sliced the zucchini very thinly with a mandoline and, while I was happy with how that turned out, I found the one minute of cooking time in the boiling water made them limp rather than the crisp tender I was after. Next time I'll shorten that to maybe half that long, skip the step of continuing cooking in the skillet in the butter and garlic, and just simply toss the zucchini in that mixture instead.  Great potential in this recipe that I'm looking forward to getting right the next time.

Yummy idea! It got me looking up all kinds of zucchini pasta ideas and recipes. I omitted the last step, just drained it well and served it with marinara sauce. It was fantastic.(Marinara sauce: sautéed onions with barest spray of oil, then added a can of whole tomatoes to the pan, a lot of basil, a bit of oregano, salt and pepper to taste and a couple tbsp of splenda, simmered till it was thick in consistency) For cheese, my bf used some parmesan and I used some low fat mozzarella. Very yummy, very low calorie!

I wasn't looking to use this as a noodle base for sauce, but rather as a simple veggie accompaniment. It was perfect. Wonderful flavor that I don't think I would WANT to mask with a sauce! I made my slices on the thick side, and the cooking method as such was spot on. They were beautifully bright green and crisp.  I sauteed them in olive oil rather than margarine. P.S. This is the recipe that made my (normally zucchini averse) children clean their plates!

I was aiming to make these as healthy as possible, so I just boiled them until they were cooked enough for me, drained, salt and peppered, sprinkled on parmesan cheese.  I ate this with Marinara Sauce II.  Delicious!  Lucky me, I have enough left for lunch tomorrow!

I used my vegetable peeler and made strands that way.  I skipped the butter step at the end, and just sprayed with a zero calorie spray margarine.  I topped with jarred fat free spaghetti sauce, and it was the best, most filling lunch I have had in a long time.  I am not ashamed to admit that I am going to have it again tomorrow too!

This was a great alternative to eating my spagetti sauce with rice.  The zucchini has great taste.

This is one of those simple dishes you can whip up in no time, and I cooked mine for the time stated in the recipe. Since my garlic was no good, I used a little sweet onion instead and seasoned the "noodles" with garlic salt, pepper, and Italian seasonings. Perfect with a dusting of Parmesan cheese. Yum!

I bought a spiral cutter, and was going to make an alfredo sauce, but my daughter wanted something lighter and found this recipe.  I'm glad she did!  I didn't boil my noodles, just added them raw to the sautéed garlic and butter.  When they were done, I drained off the excess liquid, added about 1 tsp. of herbs de Provence, a few tbsp of fat free half and half, and then the grated Parmesan. This was an amazingly good substitute for Fettucini alfredo and everyone loved it.  Since the zucchini cooks down a lot (used 7 med ones for 4 adults with NO leftovers) this will be a great way to use up all the zucchini from the garden this summer.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! Next time I will let the zucchini sweat for a little longer than 30 minutes. I cut my zucchini by hand (I really should get a mandoline slicer!), so it wasn't all that thin, but the recipe worked very well anyway. I served it with 'Simple Arrabbiata Sauce' over top. Thank you!

These were a nice change from how I normally cook my zucchini. I skipped cooking in boiling water and I don't think it needed it. They turned out a bit salty although I did rinse them before cooking, which I am sure wouldn't have been a problem had I not skipped the boiling. I will rinse them better next time. They turned out tender-crisp which is how I love my veggies. I made these for my lunch and served with spaghetti sauce and enjoyed every bite. Thanks for the recipe Becka!

I used a mandolin with large grate to get long noodle shapes.  I foolishly skipped the salting and boiling part.  I sauteed some onions, garlic, chicken (diced, cooked) and mushrooms, and then added the zucchini, diced tomatoes, freshly ground pepper, salt, and chopped fresh basil. A diced pepper (hot and/or mild) would have been good, but I was too lazy to go and pick one.  The noodles cook very quickly, and they cook down quite a bit. I plated it, leaving the juices in the pan, and grated the parmesan on each serving.  I only used 1 medium zucchini and it made two reasonably sized portions.  It was one of the best things I ever tasted.  Thank you for this neat idea.  I would like to try these noodles in a cold salad with balsamic vinaigrette, in a cheesy rich sauce, or in a "pasta" casserole.

I can't believe how delicious and easy this was. I just regret not making more. A new favorite that I can't wait to make again. I ended up letting the zucchini sit in the colander for a few hours, should prep in the morning for delicious lunch or dinner meal.

No need to salt and boil your zucchini noodles. Simply cut into thin strips and cook in a skillet with a little butter or olive oil. I grate the garlic on a zester so it is super fine and distributes better through out the dish. I use salt and pepper to taste as well as the Parmesan cheese.

Every year I seem to have a ton of zucchini left in my garden and have no idea how to use it up. It usually just goes bad and I feed it to the cows. But this recipe changed everything. It's DELICIOUS!!!! Sorry cows, this years zucchini is for me!! Thanks for sharing :) :)

If you have a "Y" peeler, you can make this by pressing a little harder on the zucchini and making thin ribbons.  Then you don't need to boil them, just saute them in a pan for about 1 minute.  Add a tablespoon of pesto and you'll think you died and went to heaven.  FYI, both zucchini ribbons and zucchini noodles can be frozen easily and thawed quickly.

Made this with Chicken Marsala (also on this site).  Needs no changes at all, but will say be careful with the garlic. A little less is better than a little more in this instance.

I've been making zucchini 'noodles' for my family for a couple of years now because we try to keep our carb intake low.  The dollar store sells cheap plastic mandoline's that work very well.  I just trim the ends, push the squash through the mandoline, then stack and slice into ribbons.  I also don't cook for 30 minutes, I think 10 is plenty.

My daughter gave me a spirooli, which cuts the zucchini and yellow squash into spirals. This was the recipe I chose to make "zoodles." I loved the flavor and decided I prefer squash cut this way rather than in rounds. So much better and slightly crispy rather than soggy and limp! The first batch I followed the recipe exactly. On the second batch I decided to see what the difference would be if I omitted steps 1 and 2. No noticeable difference, so I'll take the shortcut next time. I also served the cooked squash topped with a garlic and basil tomato reduction. Another delicious way to eat it!

Zucchini Noodles' Haiku: "I love zucchini! I liked eating it this way. (I didn't boil.)" I used one hefty zucchini just for me for lunch, which I sliced w/ a potato peeler, then left the strips out on a clean dish towel, sprinkled in salt, for a little over an hour, b4 following the rest of the directions (save boiling) in the skillet. Even just w/ the butter, garlic, s&p and parmesan, it was fantastic, but I went ahead and scooped on some leftover AR's "Brian's Favorite Sauce" (an Italian sausage spaghetti sauce) which put this over the top!

These were pretty tasty I did skip the salt and the boiling, and went to the fry pan and turned out just fine. I also used yellow and zucchini and a little red pepper to give it some color will use again thanks

DELICIOUS! I actually simplified the recipe, as I had very little time to cook and had to come up with a vegetable side dish, quick, quick, quick. I peeled the zucchini, and cut them into strips. Then  I heated up a bit of olive oil in a frying pan and added the zucchini, sprinkled in some garlic salt, pepper and some minced garlic from a jar. Let is cook (all the while stirring) for about 5-7 minutes until it reached my desired firmness/tenderness (I like them still a bit crunchy). That's it! simple and delicious!! Thanks for the idea!!

Made this for me and maw tonight....we  LOVED  IT!!!.  Only had five zucchini on my plants, but worked well.  I cut the butter back to two tablespoons of butter and about a tablespoon of olive oil and doubled the garlic, also cut up and added about eight basil leavs and a tomato cut in large pieces.  Put the tomato in just before Serving,  salt, pepper and cheese to our taste. Next time I am going to add a bit of onion and some mushrooms.  What a great way to use zucchini.  Think this will be great cold also.

I used a peeler to make long thin strips, and sprinkled some salt on them, and let them sit for 30+ min.  Then I rinsed them in hot water, and drained them until I was ready to sautée them for 5 min.  Tender crisp! My husband really enjoyed it.  I used 2 large zucchinis and it was enought for our family.

I haven't made this dish but can contest to the genius of using zucchini as a noodle substitution in soup dishes. Spaghetti squash works equally as well too!

For what this is, its pretty good. It was pretty low-calorie which is what I was looking for, and fairly tasty too. I probably could have eaten 16 servings myself though :)  I would make this again though... but it is sort of a lot of work peeling al of the zucchinis with a peeler.  Tasty though.

Just as good as it looks! It does make a few dishes to clean up, but definately worth it. Let the zucchini sweat in the salt for the whole 30 mins, a bit longer if you can so it won't turn out soggy. Yum!

I thought this was an interesting recipe. Seems like it would be perfect for someone on a low carbohydrate diet. I thought it did just taste like a soft somewhat noodle shaped zucchini which it was. The downside of the recipe is I felt like I had to clean quite a few dishes between chopping, boiling, straining, and sauteing the zucchini. I did 1/2 recipe, but it still seemed like a bit much. I also thought even though the zucchini was boiled for a minute the salt still was more than I personally prefer. It did all get eaten, and we did enjoy it,  just too many steps for a sauted zucchini.

Absolutely wonderful! I made this last night for my family.  I wasn't sure how my hubby would like it but surprisingly he loved it and insisted I make it more often.  My 8 year old also loved it!  I think next time I'll add onion as well.

Great way to avoid carbs, it was surprisingly very much like regular pasta when prepared similarily. I added sauteed mushrooms, some baked chicken (cubed), tomato sauce and topped it with parmasan. Only downside is minor and does not hinder the immediate meal at all, it is very soggy if you have leftovers.

Used a veggie spiral slicer ($5 amazon) to slice the zucchini. I skipped the first two steps and just threw the slices in a cast iron skillet with sautéed garlic and olive oil. Seasoned with salt and pepper, a little butter and topped with fresh grated Parmesan cheese. Served with chicken marsala. Was delish!

I did like the flavor of these but after all the cooking mine seemed to have a lot of juice which I wasn't sure if it was from not draining enough or too much butter - looked like it could have been a combo of both so next time I will try to address that better. I will probably try to use olive oil for the part of sauting on the pan.

I too skipped the boiling step and just sautéed the noodles.  I have a fantastic little julienne peeler so the noodles were very fine.  I added a bit of Old Bay seasoning.  I'll make this again.  Even my 15 year old son loved them.

These were fantastic!  My husband and my son even loved them...and they're typically not big fans of zucchini.  Great recipe to use up zucchini.  Like many others said, I used olive oil instead of butter.  Added some red pepper for a little kick, too.  Loved the "noodle" effect, and the "al dente" texture/bite.  Preparing zucchini this way eliminates the mushy texture you often get with steamed or boiled slices.  This made it much more appealing, too.  I'd imagine that you could also add long thin strips of carrot (as well as yellow summer squash) to this veggie noodle dish.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was great!  I let the zucchini "sweat" for 20 minutes, but think that's really not necessary as I'm putting them into boiling water anyway.  I used a spiral slicer and it made curlicues that looked really cool.

Made it twice, loved it. It is much better with smaller, more tender squash picked before the seeds develop fully.

I melted butter with Italian seasoning and tossed it. I used minced garlic and shredded onion as well. My 22 year old daughter, who is not a fan of squash, ate 2 servings! Delish!

The recipe is fine but the idea that you have to drain, boil and drain zucchini noodles again is absolutely ridiculous!  I NEVER cook zucchini noodles and I've been spiralizing veggies for 20 years.  You just spiralize them and put the hot or cold sauce of your choice on them.  If you want to cook them or heat them a bit, just zap them in a microwave.  I've been known to spiralize them and put butter and Parmesan cheese on them and micro them for a quick snack.  They're fine.    They do NOT require boiling and cooling to get them "al dente" like regular pasta for goodness sake.

I've actually never liked zucchini.  I've made this twice now, as a substitute for pasta, and I absolutely love it!!  The seasonings bring out the best flavor in the zucchini, and the zucchini itself is such an amazing compliment to red sauce.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
         I would recomend letting the zucchini set for at least 45 minutes.  The first time I made this, it was still a little too watery after only 30 minutes.

I actually forgot to drain my noodles for the 30 minutes -- they still came out great! 

I made them twice so far! Def make sure to add the salt! It really makes them less soggy! 

It only took me about 10 minutes to prep/cook 3 zucchinis with the spiralizer.

Suggestions (also others mentioned):
- Boil less than a minute if you want firmer noodles (they come out pad thai texture if you do a minute)
- Merely toss in the garlic/butter stove-top mixture...5 minutes will be too long

This "Zucchini Noodles" recipe is a definite keeper!  I had to ad-lib the recipe at the last minute when I realized that "my" mandolin (inherited) had very limited capacity (slicer only). I shredded my zucchini in my food processor, resulting in 1.5-inch-long spaghetti-width strips. I sprinkled the zucchini strips modestly with salt to encourage excess moisture to drain off them, and let them sit in a colander for 4 hours while I waited for my husband to return from work late. The zucchini appeared to be reduced in volume by about 1/3 at the 1.5 hour mark (lots of moisture drained off), with only a little moisture draining off them in the remaining 2.5 hours. I cooked the zucchini by throwing it in a pot of boiling spaghetti sauce (homemade from garden tomatoes). I enjoyed the end result far better than regular spaghetti (much lighter); however, my husband refused to eat it based on appearance alone (next time I will use a spirooli for better presentation!). Thank you Becka for sharing your recipe.

I like the taste of this dish but it is very easy to overcook the zucchini, and then they are just too mushy. Best works with young zucchinis, where seeds are not well developed yet. Would not recommend it for large size zucchinis - the seeds will all fall of and the texture will not be the same.

I used a mandolin for this fun recipe. We really liked this but along with some others, 1 minute was too long and my zucchini became limp, so I skipped the skillet and used this as a side with just a touch of butter & pepper. My husband, who has never cared for zucchini actually liked it. I think the process softens the texture and flavor. I will definitely make this again but will watch my boil time. Thanks!

I did this a few weeks ago using the special cutter. I used olive oil and roasted them on the grill. I did not boil them at all or soak in water. Just cut toss in EVOO season, grill then sprinkle with parm.

I bought a little kitchen gadget called a spiralizer. By pushing/twisting zucchini (or, yellow squash, cucumbers, etc), through the gadget, it creates perfect spaghetti like strands. The prep of this recipe is made very simple.

These are fantastic. I normally use tofu shirataki noodles but wanted to use up some zucchini. Since my zucchini were cut on the thicker side, I did boil them and then sautéed with olive oil and garlic (and salt & pepper). I served with alfredo sauce and grilled chicken... YUMMY and will definitely do this again. The texture isn't the same as noodles but zucchini does not have an overwhelming flavor, which makes it perfect for this.

Great recipe!!! as is but I do agree that it is not necessary to boil(we like al-Dente). I have tried altering but original recipe is still great.  My personal favorite change was to add sautéed chicken breast cubed and my favorite pesto from this site by Anderval.

This was delicious.  If you use zoodles (which we vegans call zucchini noodles), there is a vegetable "peeler" available that peels them into thin spaghetti-like strands... makes cooking this dish a snap!

Wonderful as a side dish instead of noodle replacement. Since I'm diabetic, I used this as my starch.  Everyone else had rice, I had zucchini noodles until everyone tasted them .... then we all had them.  Reading other reviews I skipped the boiling stage as my noodles were very thin as well. Can't wait to try it as a noodle based dish.  I took the left over seedy part of the zucchini and cut it up and steamed it.  No waste. Keeper in my recipe book!!!

This was wonderful.  I got a GEFU spiral cutter to make zucchini noodles. I've never cooked zucchini noodles before.  I used ghee instead of margarine but did everything else according to the directions.  It was much better than I expected it to be.  It was delicious!  I cannot wait to cook it again.

This is my new favorite way to prepare zucchini. Why? Because it is so quick, simple and delicious! I also like to include chili flakes when I add the garlic and tend to omit the parmesan - although it is tasty as well.

Quite tasty. Served with "Simple Arrabbiata Sauce." I only boiled for about 3 minutes because I was afraid it would get mushy. After cooking on the skillet, the noodles tasted perfect. Served with "California Grilled Veggie Sandwich." I'm looking forward to making more of these noodles with the sandwiches to use up the bumper crop from my squash and zucchini plants.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!! I’ve made it at least 5 times. It never disappoints! I use a spiralizer to create the zoodles. I follow the recipe exactly but it can also easily be paired down to just one or two zucchini. If reducing zucchini just remember to also reduce the salt. This is a keeper!

This is a favorite during zucchini season. Easy to make, yummy and a great way to use up the zucchini.  Fresh herbs are in my garden at the same time the zucchini is on so I add basil, oregano or lemon thyme while it is frying.

Super easy and awesome.  I added crumbled bacon.  
I did not parboil the zucchini noodles.  I did one pan.

I followed the directions exactly and they turned out perfect.   I would not change a thing.  The only problem was I didn't make enough.   I made the zucchini noodles with a spiralizer attachment for my mixer.

I used a tool to make the zucchini spirals and didn't boil the zucchini but sauteed it instead in a little olive olive oil. I also made pesto sauce, which had garlic and Parmesan cheese in it, and spread it as a sauce for the zucchini.

After spiralizing the zucchini , I put it in a colander and pour the boiling water over  it. By doing this, I always have tender-crisp zoodles. No need to salt and drain beforehand

this is fabulous! not a soul in my house thought they would like this BUT I will say there is no photo because there is none left .I did make a few subtle changes and additions. I after I cooked for 1 1/2 minutes and cooled, made certain all the water was drained tossed into premium olive oil to cook on stove, added chopped rosemary and the parmesan cheese>we had this with the rosemary chicken and oven roasted seasoned small tri color potatoes. What an unbelievable meal. the kids are asking for more "noodles" for tomorrow FANTASTIC

I made this tonight for the first time.  I really enjoyed (as did hubby) this version.  I have cooked zoodles previously in EVOO but actually found this cooked just enough in 1 minute without being overlooked.   I dumped noodles and cooled then meted butter, added a little garlic and tossed noodles.  I added Adobo (everything better with it), and

I've never boiled the noodles before I plan fried them.  Even though I drained it,  it was watery.  I'll skip the boiling next time,  but the flavor was great with the garlic and herbs.

I hunted for a recipe for Zoodles, because I had a feeling that the water in the zucchini had to be expressed before cooking, and this recipe's trick for doing that worked perfectly.  I first used a spiralizer to make the noodle shape.  If you wait the full 30 minutes with the salt on the zucchini, it reduces in size by about half, letting you know you really made a difference with this step.  I recall that it is also helpful to literally squeeze the water out using paper towels (I didn't do this, but think it would have eliminated yet more water).  I then only doused the zucchini in boiling water for 30 seconds, like one reader suggested, then sauteed it in a little butter and the garlic, like advised.  It was the BEST tasting zoodles, we've ever had!!!  Thank you for the technique...

I used as a side dish for two so only used one zucchini and one summer squash. Adjusted other ingredients accordingly. I also, like other reviewers suggested,  skipped the boiling step. I would definitely make again and try changing it up with maybe chopped tomato or red pepper. Whatever is in season! 
Delicious as is or a good base recipe. Thanks!

Very good —just don’t keep zucchini in boiling water too long.  I did about 2 minutes max.  I’m thinking next time I will skip the boiling part and just sauté.  I drained them and then added them to my garlic and onion sautéed mixture.  I used the Vegetti machine for cutting the zucchini.  I added Parmesan cheese at the end and tossed with some salt.  It’s good!!

With changes 4*. Cooking time is way off. As suggested maybe 30 seconds in boiling water. To add nutrients, I prepped thinly sliced mushrooms, red peppers 
( mandolin) , finely diced onion and finely chopped garlic. These extras were in my wok cooking in unsalted butter and a little EVO.  I boiled  the zoodles  for  30 seconds, drained and shocked them and then added them to the ready and waiting medley. To finish them I sprinkled on the Parmesan. Prepping and timing is Everything in this dish. I felt the end result was tasty, healthy and worthwhile.

I've made it! but i did followed the alternative way for a vegan diet. so removed the processed cheese and instead sprinkled nutritional yeast which is a superfood and contain many nutrients such as protein and b12 etc. instead of table salt ( which is chemical processed 7 times in a bleaching process ) i switched to himalayan salt.

I kept the noodles in the strainer for several hours to drain more water, and I don't add the parmesan cheese because it's so delicious it doesn't need it.  My only complaint is that I always wish there was more!

I hate Zucchini and this was amazing. After speaking with a friend, I did not boil the noodles. And instead of letting them rest on a strainer. I put them over paper towels twice.

The use of zucchini is a great idea, especially for gluten free diets.  This can be made MUCH more easily with a turning slicer, also know as a Taglialegumi.  To the spiralized zuke, I added pesto from Costco, though Trader Joe's pesto is also great.  It was super easy and delicious!

This recipe is very good.  I use it as a side dish, or add marinara sauce with shrimp for a full meal.  I have also added grilled or broiled chicken breast.  The garlic and butter enhance the flavor of the chicken for a filling main dish!

I made these last night, and they were the perfect side dish to chicken Parmesan! The flavor was great. The only thing I did differently was used powdered garlic because I didn't have fresh.

We found that, even for 4 servings, 6 zucchini was too many zucchini. So, since it was just two of us, we pared the recipe down to 2 servings using just 2 zucchini. We have a Veggetti (the small one) and decided to try smaller noodles this time. I am glad we did this, because I found the texture more palatable. Other ways we modified the recipe: we used butter instead of margarine, more garlic (from a jar) and probably more parmesan (I didn’t measure, I just topped each dish with some cheese). In step one, when we placed the noodles in the colander, nothing drained. We ended up forgetting to use salt and pepper, which I am sure would have amped it up some, but overall I was pretty bored with the results. The next time I make zucchini noodles I will find a different method.

Very tasty. Will definitely make this again. Even though I cut the zucchini manually, it was worth the effort. I'm sure a mandolin would make this easier. It even reheated well for leftovers and maintained a nice texture.

Loved this recipe!  Me and my kids are proud of my husband anytime he eats his vegetables , last night he ate at least a cup and half of zucchini noodles!  I was surprised at how much the quasi veggie eaters and hubby ate last night, with request for me to make zucchini noodles again in the future.   I used 7 zucchinis and that made enough noodles for a family of 8.  I also splashed a little white wine in at the beginning of the sauté, added about 2 cups of mushrooms, and 1/2 cup of very finely chopped yellow onion.  We served it with garlic herb chicken and shrimp, and sugar snap peas.. Also used the veggettie noodle maker to make the noodles.

Finally tried it and it wasn't bad.  I like zucchini so I thought to try this out. I would probably go from cutting  to skillet and leave out the boiling part. Added turkey sausage and made it a complete meal. Kids liked it, so it's staying in rotation!!

I didn't want the "noodles" overcooked so simply sauteed them with the garlic and olive oil for a few minutes, until they were tender crisp.  Delicious!

I saw a picture of zucchini noodles and it looked really good.  I found this recipe and decided to try it. I read a bunch of the reviews and tweaked a few things.  I used a julianne peeler to peel a huge zuke and a yellow summer squash. I saw that some people said they let it sweat for a while, so I let mine sit in a colander for about 4 hours.  I did toss about 2 tsp salt in and mixed it up.  I let the colander sit on paper towels and was amazed at how much water came out.  Instead of boiling, I rinsed it off with my sprayer and really hot water. Then I laid it out and blotted it with paper towels to dry it off.  Then I sauted it in the pan in olive oil and garlic for a few minutes. It was super good! I wanted to make the zuke again today but just chopped instead of noodles. I had so much it ended up into 2 colanders. I didn't salt them and noticed that after a 1/2 hr no water was coming out. I lightly salted one of them and almost immediately saw water start dripping out. I am hoping I can cook them the same and have the pieces taste as good as the noodles did!

Everyone loves this. I bread it with Parmesan and Panko. Try the Chipotle-Panko. Cook it on a wire rack so it browns evenly. I've tried it on baking sheet and doesn't do well. A deep pan with wire rack takes 2X as long to cook but it's eatable.

Very, very good recipe to use the abundant zucchini from your garden!!   I also used a vegetable peeler to make my "noodles" and used butter in place of the margarine.    We love garlic so I used 3 cloves and cooked them briefly to get the raw taste off.    Did not cook the additional 5 minutes  (step 3) as this seemed like a long time and things would have gotten mushy.  I finished up the recipe by only heating the "noodles" in the butter and garlic mixture.   Served with Feta and olive meatballs also found on this site.   Going to make these again and again!!

I love this idea and look forward to trying it!!  Just wondering if anyone of you zucchini noodle experts tried to freeze the Zucchini noodles for later use??  I have a great crop and freeze it shredded to make breads and cakes after thawing.  Any info is greatly appreciated.  Thanks!!

When you're using very large zucchini the first 2 steps take the bitterness out of "older" zucchini. If not you can skip the steps. Love zucchini noodles.

I tried this. It is really good.  I didn't bother to boil the zucchini.  It is watery enough, just put a little olive oil in a frying pan and gently sauté for a few minutes.  Zucchini is pretty soft.  I made a pesto sauce  to go over it and added Parmesan cheese. Patti

To spruce up and quicken this weeknight "30 minute" recipe, I used a julienne peeler to "form" the noodles; I have sauteed and boiled the zucchini with no difference in texture (as long as you don't OVER cook); and to really fancy things up- toss with coconut oil, bacon, garlic, shrimp, and dried basil and oregano. It was almost a meal in itself.

This recipe is a very good one as a change from a pasta sauce topping.

I have not tried this yet... but I do have relatives that have an allergy to glutens. I know that margarine is a no no in a gluten free diet. Real butter would have to be used to compensate.

This recipe was amazing. I don't know why I hadn't thought of this ....but I am sooo happy someone else did! My family loves this dish, and it will certainly be added in the meal circulation.
