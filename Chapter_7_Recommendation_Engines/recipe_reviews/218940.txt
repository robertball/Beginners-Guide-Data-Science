I made this last night for dinner and it was delicious!  I used bone-in chicken thighs from which I removed the skin (I hated to do it, I love chicken with skin, but I'm on a weight loss program).  I didn't have any Italian seasoned bread crumbs so I used Panko and added dried oregano, basil and thyme. At first I was hesitant to add Italian seasoning to an Asiany dish, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't discard the marinade, I boiled it down to a syrupy consistancy and served it over leftover Asian noodles with green onions.  This was really wonderful and I can't wait to try it with skin-on chicken once I get skinny.  Thanks so much, simplylo!

Excellent!  I didn't have dry sherry so I just substituted white wine.  I marinated the chicken for about 5 hours and breaded the chicken with the same recipe but since I didn't have wheat germ I used panko (I had it on hand and you can't get more Asian than that!) instead.  It was delicious.  I think I even cooked it too long and still came out juicy.  Yum. Can't wait to make it again.

This was by far the best tasting chicken I have ever tasted!  Who would know soy sauce, ginger and Italian seasonings would go so well?  I used a whole cut up chicken and took the skin off (I don't like the skin and it's so bad for you anyway!). I also used low sodium soy sauce.  That's the only changes I made.  The coating on this chicken is just incredible.  Oh, and it's even better the next day . . .cold!  Next time I'm going to make a boat load of chicken drummettes using this recipe.  Can't wait!  Thanks for an awesome recipe simplylo!

I thought it was very good, 4 stars, but my guests gave this rave reviews so I'll rate it 5. I used white wine instead of sherry (didn't have) and would use low sodium soy sauce next time. Also didn't have wheat germ so used 1.5 cups bread crumbs. I let the chicken marinade overnight before breading and baking. Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe. Would cut down the soya sauce a tad, and had to use white wine b/c no sherry, otherwise followed the recipe exact. We loved it.

I thought this recipe had good flavor, but no one else in my house would eat it.  Not quite the flavor I expected with all of the spices in it.  Ended up tasting fairly "earthy".
