Yummy! This is a fabulous bread recipe! Very moist on the outside with a crunchy crust. I absolutely love the spice and almond combination in this bread recipe. Makes wonderful and very flavorful sandwiches too! Definately beats any store bought bread by far. Ommited the egg wash though. Thanks for sharing!
