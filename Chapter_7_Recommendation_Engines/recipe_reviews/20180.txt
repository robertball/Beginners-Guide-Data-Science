This is perfect for anyone who loves lemonade and cake!  With its cool refreshing flavor and its creamy texture this is great.

I was really hoping for something cool and refreshing given the other reviews, but this just doesn't work.  The gelatin mixture isn't lemonade-y enough.  The texture of the angel food cake is just weird with the gelatin mixture.  I had to add a little pink food coloring to actually make it pink.  My mother makes something similar to the gelatin mixture only with a graham cracker crust and regular jello that is just heavenly- I'll stick to that in the future.

Not that appealing visually nor was it very tasty.  Luckily I made two desserts because this one bombed. I made it exactly according to the directions.
