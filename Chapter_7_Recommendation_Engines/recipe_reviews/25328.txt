How can anyone go wrong w/ this! It's soooo simple and so flavorful. I added some chopped bell peppers and corn, but there are so many possibilities w/ this dish. I was so happy to see someone finally using nutritional yeast that I felt I had to make this. Thank goodness I did!!!

Basamati rice is supposed to be lightly flavored so anyone complaining about little or no taste is just about right :) It is meant to be incorporated into the main dish. Recipes aren't always meant to be followed to the T and I usually tweak any recipe before I make it :) Everyone's sense of taste is completely different, too.

My husband and I loved this rice. It makes a great simple, light side dish. I spilled the basil while I was pouring it and probably doubled the basil (woops), and it still tasted great! Thanks!

This was a major surprise! I made it at the last minute because we had NOTHING for a side dish. I used regular margarine instead of soy, and we didn't have any nutritional yeast, but it was delicious! Even my picky husband liked it. Very good, easy recipe that has a lot of flavor! Yum!

This was a major disappointment. The rice took 40 minutes to cook, and the taste was not good. No one in the family enjoyed this. I had better hopes for this one, too bad.

Pretty good.  Instead of rice, I used riced cauliflower, and I used the equivalent of chopped fresh garlic and fresh basil.  A few dashes of Italian Seasoning at the end gave it a nice kick!

Not as tasty as I was expecting.  My husband liked it but I did not.  I used real butter instead of soy butter so perhaps that could have affected intended taste.

I was surprised on how good this recipe tasted. This is the first time I have used this type of yeast. Following the advice of another poster, I added cut some color peppers and also added cut up mushrooms.

I think this is really good.  Yes...I made changes ONLY because I like to use what I have instead of running to the store.  
Used long grain white rice because we prefer that to basmati and used real butter.  Threw all ingredients into my rice cooker and let it cook.  It's a light flavor and will pair great with the fish I'm making.  I will be saving this so I can make again.

This rice is SO GOOD. I started by using brown rice instead of basmati, and rich homemade chicken stock instead of water, but did everything else as directed(except the butter wasn't soy). It was so moist and flavorful. I already had the nutritional  yeast but hadn't yet used it in anything, and wow...I"m a fan. It adds a beautiful flavor texture thats slightly nutty and salty and the basil in the rice is a little minty. It's just delicious and simple and the perfect rice as a side.

Fantastic! Love that I now have another use for my nutritional yeast. I had basmati rice on hand, but chose to use jasmine. I used regular margarine and cooked 2c. rice in my rice cooker (2 cups is the minimum). Followed the rest of the recipe cooking in a saucepan. The ratio of rice to all the other ingredients was perfect! Went great with the steak I made.

My rendition is no longer vegan, but it is tasty.  I had no nutritional yeast so I used grated Cojita  and I went with fresh basil.  I also just omitted the soy margarine.  In my opinion, it wasn't needed.  We enjoyed this.

This was a little disappointing. For one thing, the proportions of water to rice seemed off; normally I try to follow recipes as written, but every set of rice instructions I've ever seen calls for twice as much water as rice, and this one calls for three times as much water as rice. Since the instructions here were to cook the rice until the water was evaporated -- just like every other recipe I've seen -- I went with what I knew worked, and used 2 cups of water. Also, I really love nutritional yeast. I REALLY love it. I expected a mild taste, but I was also somehow hoping for a fuller flavor. This just tasted like watered down nutritional yeast with some dried basil. Having said all of that, it wasn't bad; I just had higher hopes. Probably won't make it again. Thanks though!
