This recipe sounds awesome.  I have not tried it yet, but I can't wait to make it.  I have been looking for sauces such as this and I'm hoping it turns out as good as it sounds

It was delicious! Much more like real New Mexico red than the tomato-based salsa we get here in Colorado. This is the real thing.

Very, very good. It came out the consistency of a sauce, not a paste. No reason to buy store-bought versions, trust me. I added 2 dried chipotle peppers as written in the notes. Thank you Pasquale for the recipe.
