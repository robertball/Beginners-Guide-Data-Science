Have been wanting to try one of the "green" smoothies, and since I had everything on hand for this one, mixed up a batch today for lunch.  I had red grapes instead of green, but other than that, followed the recipe to the letter.  For any of you concerned about the spinach, don't be; the sweetness of all the fresh fruit is what you taste.   Great way to get the kids to eat a little spinach, they'll never know.  It was a hit in this house.

I skipped the mango, but this was still a great green smoothie!

For a green smoothie, this is pretty good. The calorie count is great also, due to not having the addition of dairy in the drink. I couldn't understand why it was called a kiwi drink with all of the fruit, but honestly that is the dominant taste. Pretty much all of the fruit I used was frozen, but my blender will work with them that way. Was nice and filling. ty

Would have been better if I peeled the grapes, but it was still great!

I skipped the mango and it still tasted great. I made way too much so i decided to freeze them in an ice cube tray and stuck toothpicks in there so i can pull them out and eat them like popsicles. It turned out to be a great drink and snack too!

This was a really good green smoothie! You can't even taste the spinach, so don't be afraid to add more if you wanna get a little extra health in there! I didn't add the green grapes because I didn't have one at the time. Instead, I added vanilla yogurt to give it the sweetness that the grapes were for. And I had to add a LOT more ice cubes than it called for, but I like my smoothies a little icy. I didn't give it the fifth star because although delicious, this smoothie is VERY acidic, so you can only drink a little bit before it's too much. Will make it again though!
