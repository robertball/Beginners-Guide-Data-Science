This was Terrific!  I made a few changes based on other reviews: Pounded the chicken, then floured it lightly (with plain flour), dipped it in the egg mixture then dipped it into the flour mixture.  I browned the chicken in butter and olive oil until done and placed them on a cookie sheet in the oven (250 degrees to keep warm) when they were done.  While they were in the oven, I made the sauce.  I doubled the recipe, brought it all to a boil (I added a little sugar, 1 tsp... helps cut the sour of the lemon), then added a little bit of cornstarch mixed with water to help thicken it.  I added the chicken right before serving... just long enough to coat it.  That way the breading didn't get soggy.  Everyone raved... it tasted like the one I order at my favorite restaurant!  Thank you Terry!

The first bite my wife took she looked at me and said ‘oh, you will be making this again’!  This came out just fine.  I modified the original some however.  I added lemon zest to the flour mixture.  I fried the chicken medallions (I cut the breasts in half) in olive oil and butter.  I also decided to use low sodium chicken broth instead of the bullion granules. I added 1 cup of white wine (doubled the sauce recipe) to the broth as well.  After adding the sauce mixture to the chicken, I used a bulb baster to siphon some of the sauce/broth off so the chicken was not completely submerged.  I simmered this extra sauce in a separate pan, also adding some lemon zest and cornstarch to thicken it (remember to mix the cornstarch in a small bowl w/cold water before adding to the hot liquids – otherwise the cornstarch will just pill/ball up and not dissolve).  I also added some to the chicken pan as well.  I added some capers to both the chicken pan and the saucepot too.  Finally, before serving I sprinkled some lemon zest on each of the medallions.  It was just great!  Many of my modifications were from other suggestions found here.  This is a great recipe to try.  Since you are zesting the lemon, try to use the fresh squeezed lemon juice.  Nothing compares!

Just a quibble, but the dipping in egg first makes this dish "chicken franciais" and not "chicken piccata".  It's a minor change, but hey - it's cooking.  Chicken piccata is dredged in flour - no egg.

This is a good recipe, but, it would have been better if a Pinot Grigio wine was used with a good chicken stock and 2 tablespoons of capers were added. Chicken should be removed from pan and kept warm, then added back to sauce until thickened.

This was a basis for a great meal and with the suggestions of many others it came out a five-star meal!  I doubled the flour mixture and dipped in the dry mixture, then wet and dry; fried the chicken in olive oil; added a half cup of white cooking wine to the broth mixture; and then added about 2 tbl. of capers while simmering.  I also used the reduced sodium chicken bouillon powder to cut down on the salt.  Absolutely fabulous!

I thought this was great and will definitely make it again.  I too refrigerated the chicken in the breading for about a half hour as some suggested it helps the chicken keep it's coating.  I also added fresh chopped basil to the top as a garnish and it really helped the flavor.  I put in a clove of garlic into the sauce and doubled the sauce to poor over the pasta.  The dish was a bit bland, but still very good.  May try some other variations next time.  Awesome on angel hair pasta!

The reviews for this recipe were very helpful, and the final product was delicious. I pounded the chicken breasts, then floured lightly with AP flour, dipped in the egg mixture, then in the flour mixture before sauteeing, After the chicken was cooked, I kept the breasts warm in a 250 degree oven. I doubled the sauce recipe as others suggested, and added 1 tsp. sugar, and 1 tbsp water mixed with 1 tsp cornstarch to the sauce. I added the warm chicken to the sauce in the skillet just before serving - not soggy at all. Good recipe, great reviewer suggestions.

OH MY!! YUM!! I made this for dinner last night and my boyfriend and I LOVED it! I am not a big chicken breast lover but these came out so tender! I used the chicken bouillon (some have tried the broth but I had it in my kitchen) but almost tripled the sauce recipe because I served it with angel hair on the side. I double coated the chicken with the flour as others suggested and even added slivers of fresh garlic to the pan while the chicken cooked (omitting capers because not a fan). To make the dish a little healthier, I cut down on the butter and used some cooking spray. To keep the chicken from sticking, I gradually spooned the sauce to the pan. This dinner was light, easy, and YUM!! I am definitely making this again and again!

Super yum! This was FANTASTIC. As far as piccata goes, this is probably the BEST I've ever made! Having said this, I did make a few "tweaks" which I feel enhanced the outcome. To start, I generously seasoned each chicken cutlet (I used thin cutlets instead of breasts) with s&p. In addition to the seasoned flour called for, I first dredged my chicken in plain flour, then dipped it in the egg / lemon wash and finally in the seasoned flour. I sauteed my chicken in a couple T of EVOO on medium-high heat and then set it aside (no oven) while I made the sauce. I deglazed my pan with 1/4 c. Pinot Grigio and to this, I added the juice of 2 lemons (FYI, a medium-sized lemon yields ~ 2-3 T juice - I used 5 T total), 2 T (drained) capers, 1/2 c. chicken broth and 2 T unsalted butter. To finish, I added my chicken, covered my pan and simmered on low for 20 minutes as directed (NOTE: the floured breading will help thicken your sauce, but you need to get past the ever so slightly soggy texture to allow it to work it's magic). Looking back, my only regret is not doubling the sauce. It was SOOOO incredible!!! I was literally lickikng my plate, hoping more would magically appear. :) Served with oven roasted red potatoes (Donna Lasater) and crusty Italian bread, this was an AWESOME meal. Thanks for sharing, TERRY! :-)

This was FABULOUS!!!!!  With just one bite, my family was already asking me to make this recipe again.  I did add a little white wine to the broth.  I served it with pasta, and wished there was more sauce.  I think next time I will double the sauce ingredients and reduce half in a separate pan so not to boil the chicken with too much liquid.  This is very flavorful without being overpowering!  Thanks

Delicious . . . and some great modifications! As suggested by others, SUBSTITUTES: I used wine instead of water, chicken broth instead of the chicken cubes; ADDITIONS: added capers, sliced mushrooms, and artichoke hearts; COOKING MODIFICATIONS: ensured my chicken was well coated with the flour mixture, added a bit of italian seasoning to my flour mixture for extra flavor, and added corn starch to thicken the sauce.  DON'T OVERCOOK CHICKEN: my mistake was overcooking the chicken a bit.  When I cook this again, I'll take out the chicken breasts while I cook the mushrooms, capers, and artichoke hears then put it all together for about 10 minutes at the end.

This was wonderful! I pounded the chicken to make it thin, and doubled the flour and egg/lemon to "double dip".  I also added 1/2 cup of white wine to the sauce and doubled the sauce recipe.  To reduce saltiness, I used reduced sodium chicken broth rather than the bulion.  I added all of the sauce to the pan, then used a baster to remove enough sauce to keep the chicken from being completely submerged and simmered it separately.  This allowed the butter to be mixed into all of the sauce.  I also added capers and mushrooms during the last five minutes.  I used the sauce in the separate pan over angel hair pasta and added the mushrooms and capers that I cooked with the chicken.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Awesome recipe. Easy and fairly quick to make too! Had to increase the amounts for the breading as original wasn't enough once the egg started to get it wet and it stuck in the dish. Didn't have any problems with it staying on with only single dip. Thanks Terry!

To make this a 5-star, I made a few small changes. I added grated lemon peel into the flour mixture, and also pressed a small amount of grated peel into the coated chicken just before frying. This added a wonderful lemon flavor. Like other reviewers, I "double dipped," and had no problems with the coating coming off. Most importantly, remember to pound the chicken thin, about 1/4 inch, and even. I added a few tablespoons of white wine and also a small amount of water -- thought the liquids were a bit too salty otherwise. Delicious!

Had a good Flavor but It came out soggy & the breading didn't stick?? I followed this to a T. I also did the dry wet dry per other reviewers. I too had to add cornstarch to thicken & leave lid off @ the end because it was soggy & the breading was everywhere.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I listened to many of the reviews and they all helped make our supper tasty so thanks to everyone!  I doubled the flour but not the bouillon mixture.  I should have because the chiken started to stick to the bottom by the end of the cooking period.  I also floured then dipped then floured again so the mixture would not fall off the chicken when boiling.  Lastly, refrigerated the chicken before frying it to cover all my bases.  I don't know which suggestion helped the most.   All I know, the chicken was scumptious!

When I printed this out, I didn't notice that the recipe didn't call for capers or mushrooms.  So, I pounded my breasts REALLY thin, added way more fresh lemon, and put in the capers and fresh sliced mushrooms in during the simmer. Yum.  Next time I will double the sauce.  I served it with lemon wedges (my hubby LOVES lemon!)  and fettucine.  Defintately a new regular for my family!

This was too salty for me. (I had to do the "raw potato chunks trick" to soak up the excess salt). I suggest using chicken "broth or stock" instead of the boullion powder & water. Also, if I am going to eat a battered food;I like it crispy-which this was not,after covering for 20 minutes. Will bake the chicken after browning, while making the sauce. Will add some fresh garlic, pepper, white wine & drained capers(at the end), to give more flavor. Also, will double the "sauce" to have to pour over rice

I had asked my daughter what she would like for dinner, and she requested, "Lemon Chicken”.  I do have a simple recipe, but I wanted to try something new, so off to allrecipes.com I went.  I had to try this one just because of the mixed reviews received, and here’s the skinny on what I think.  The breading is the problem!  It gets real soggy and is quite gross.  If you omit the egg/lemon, and just coat the chicken (which I pounded first) with the flour mixture, then that will take care of that problem.  Being that I did have this soggy stuff to deal with, I knew I had to come up with something to salvage the meal.  First off, I used a whole cup of a good quality dry white wine (instead of the water), with the 2 teaspoons chicken bouillon, and I used 4 tablespoons of lemon juice, mixing them all together.  When the chicken was done simmering in the wine mixture, I removed it and then transferred to a warm platter.  I mixed 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with a whole cup of 1% milk (it’s what I had on hand) and slowly added that to the liquid in the pan, cooking until thickened, and then pouring the sauce over the chicken.  The presentation was gorgeous and she was in heaven from the first bite, and immediately gave the recipe a 5 star rating.  Because of the doctoring I had to do, and changing the sauce altogether, I’m only giving 3 stars, even though it turned out to be 5. (Go figure!)  Thanks for sharing all the same!!

Excellent sauce--I pound out the chicken first, and add capers and artichoke hearts while it simmers.  Fantastic with fettuccine alfredo on the side.

Absolutely fabulous!  Great flavor~my husband said it was better than a restaurant.  I added mushrooms and capers as suggested and it was wonderful. I also pounded the breasts flat and they were really tender.  I also added seasoned bread crumbs to the flour to give the coating a little texture.  I doubled the sauce and after removing the breasts to a serving plate and scooping the mushrooms over I poured the remaining sauce over angel hair pasta.  Just delicious!  Will serve it again and again!

Yummy!  I love chicken piccata, and this is a good recipe.  I'd recommend dipping the chicken into the dry ingredients twice, though (into the dry, into the wet, and into the dry again) because the breading just doesn't want to stay on otherwise.  Be sure to ladle some of the yummy pan drippings over your chicken!  Mmmm...

We decided to bake this dish instead of cook it in a pan and it still turned out great!  It gives a good flavor to the chicken without being overpowering.  And the butter/lemon juice made the chicken very tender which made for an all-around great meal!

eh, not the best chicken I've ever made, but it wasn't horrible.  I recommend taking the chicken out of the skillet BEFORE adding the sauce, so that the breading doesn't become soggy.  I also recommend low sodium bouillon, or chicken broth instead.  It was a little on the salty side for me, and I like salt.

This recipe is excellent tasting and easy to make.  I followed the suggestions of others, including pounding the chicken, sauteeing in butter and olive oil, double dipping and refrigerating, deglazing with wine and doubling the sauce with canned chicken broth, finishing with capers and sauteed mushrooms.  This would be a great recipe for company...it is restaurant quality. It will definately be in our regular rotation.  My husband can't stop talking about it.  Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good, but I made some changes: 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, pounded and each cut in half (or pork cutlets, pounded); 1 egg; 3 Tbsp lemon juice; 1/2 cup AP flour; 1/2 tsp garlic powder; 1/4 tsp paprika; 1/8 tsp AP seasoning; 1/8 tsp onion powder; 1/4 cup butter; 1/2 cup chicken broth; 1 garlic clove, minced; Pinch of sugar. Optional: 1 Tbsp cornstarch; Parsley to taste. 1) In a shallow dish, beat the egg and 1 Tbsp of the lemon juice together. Set aside. 2) In another shallow dish, mix together flour, garlic powder, paprika, all-purpose seasoning, and onion powder. Dip the chicken in the flour mixture, tap off excess. Dip into egg mixture, then again in the flour mixture--coat well. 3) In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat and brown the coated chicken pieces. NOTE: If the chicken is finished cooking before the sauce is ready, place them in a 250ºF oven to keep warm. 4) Meanwhile, heat chicken broth, and then add the remaining 2 Tbsp of lemon juice and a pinch of sugar. Once sugar is dissolved, add minced garlic and stir for at least 30 seconds. NOTE: If serving with angel hair pasta, double this sauce, reserving 1/4 cup cool chicken broth. Add 1 Tbsp cornstarch to cool broth and stir until dissolved. Add mixture to sauce just after garlic and stir until slightly thickened. 5) Pour sauce into skillet (or add chicken to sauce) and coat chicken. Sprinkle on dried parsley or minced fresh parsley to taste. Serve immediately.

This is fantastic. My husband is not fond of citrus with poultry but he has asked for this several times. Per personal preference and reviewer recommendations I made a few changes. I used 3 boneless chicken breast which I butterflied and cut in half, I dredged in AP flour, diped in beaten egg whites then dregded again, shaking off any excess. I cooked the chicken in butter/olive oil till brown and crispy.  Keep the chicken warm after removing from the pan. To the pan I added 1/2 cup lemon juice, 1/2 cup chicken stock, 1 cup white wine (not sweet). I let this reduce till slightly thickened. The flour from cooking the chicken and the brown bits on bottom of pan are enough to thicken the sauce. At the end I whisk in about 1 tbl butter and add 1/2 cup capers. I do not return the chicken to the pan rather I plate the chicken and spoon on the sauce. This retains the crispiness of the chicken.

This is added to my "favorites" from this site.  This recipe was soooooooo good!!!!!!!  I thought it was restaurant quality.  Here's what I did a little different -  I browned the chicken in the butter and then removed the chicken-since I doubled the recipe I had to cook it in 2 batches because my pan wasn't  big enough for all of it.  When all the chicken was finished browning - I scraped all of the bits from the bottom of the pan - those bits make the sauce sooooooo tasty!!!  I then added the chicken back into the pan - some pieces overlapped - but all of it fit - I then poured the lemon/broth mixture over the chicken and put the cover on and simmered for 10 minutes......I then rotated the chicken pieces - (the pieces on top I put on the bottom and the bottom pieces I put on the top) and I simmered for another 10 minutes.  The sauce thickens as it cooks.  When It was finished,  I took all the chicken pieces out and put them in a deep platter and then again, with a wooden spoon scraped up all the brown bits on the bottom of the pan, stirred and then poured it over the chicken.  I absolutely loved this recipe and would give it 10 stars if I could......I HIGHLY recommend this.....This goes AWESOME with Rice Pilaf - and have some crusty bread handy for the dipping.......oh so good!  Thank you for this recipe!!!!!!!!

This is the most flavorful chicken ever!  I use more lemon juice (1/4 cup) it creates such a fantastic flavor.  This is a request always in our house.  The kids and my husband LOVE it.
Since I have been making this recipe for a long time,I also cut the chicken breast into 3 pieces for quicker cooking.

I have never had Chicken Piccata before...and I decided to try it out.  This was very good.  I did put the lemon in the egg to tone it down like another reviewer had suggested.  Thank you for such a fancy dish that I feel comfortable serving to guests.

An excellent, easy dinner!  The lemon was the perfect amount of flavor.  I can see how some of the coating would fall off and I might try the suggestion made by another reviewer by "double dipping" the chicken (which, ofcourse would require doubling the egg/flour amts).  But, most if it stayed on the 5 breasts I used.  I might add some mushrooms during the last 5 minutes next time I make this. Thank you Terry!!

I originally printed this recipe up in 2006.  I have been making it ever since and my husband and I love it.  We don't make it too often as it isn't the healthiest, but it is good.

Two things I do - I remove the chicken from the simmering sauce and then dump cooked egg noodles or angel hair pasta noodles in so they are good and coated before plating.  After I plate the food I sprinkle capers over the chicken and noodles.

This recipe is delicious, but is not healthy.  No egg is needed.  Dredge in seasoned flour.  Saute in 1/2 butter & 1/2 olive oil.  Thicken lemon/water mixture with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch.  Cook as directed.

Im glad I read the reviews first! I decided to cut the chicken breasts in half to make them thinner. I did a thin layer of flour prior to dipping them in the egg and flour mixture. Also, I put them in the oven while I made the sauce and they stayed crispy. If I wouldnt have cut them in half they wouldnt have been cooked thoroughly. The sauce was great but only enough for 2 chicken breasts. Served over linguine and it was delicious!

Chicken was nice - some suggestions though, no offense.  
Definitely want to pound and season the chicken, then flour, egg, and flour again.  
No need to season flour or else will burn in pan.  
Use olive oil/butter mix to fry chicken.  
Remove chicken, add lemon juice and chicken broth to pan, and add chicken.  Simmer. Don't flip chicken over or you're bound to lose the coating.

I put off making this for quite a while after finding the recipe because most of the Piccata recipes I've tried haven't been great. This was very, very good, though. It's very easy, and simple and the whole family loved it. I doubled the ingredients for the sauce, though, so that I would have a little extra to serve over some fettuccine.

Loved Loved Loved this recipe!!  I did change things like past reviewers though.  I thought 1/4 cup of butter was a bit much considering I'm trying to eat healthier, lol.  So I used olive oil to saute the chicken.  I also addes freshed minced garlic and of course a bunch of capers.  My son had never had these and said, mom I like these little green round things :)  I added two whole squeezed lemons into the recipe, if it's suppose to taste like lemon mine sure did and it was yummy!!  I totally forgot to add the mushrooms :(  But I will for sure next time!  This is a keeper!!! Thanks!

This Chicken Piccata has the potential of being a gourmet meal! But, this recipe need to be altered a little. After you coat the chicken, refreigerate it for 30 minutes. Brown it then keep it warm in oven. While it is staying warm, that is when you make the sauce. Also, the sauce needs too be doubled. Another thing is that I used thin chciken cutlets and it turned out absoultly amazing. My whole family was surprised how good this turend out and called it an "easily 30$ gourmet meal at a resteraunt!". I served this with noodles, chopped parsley, and mixed vegtables. It was incredible!!!

I made a few of the revisions others suggested and this turned out great.  All the leftovers were eaten!  I used a combo of chicken broth and white wine in place of the bouillon.  Increased the amount of flour mixture and dipped the chicken in the flour mix, then egg mix, then flour mix again.  I thought it created a nice coating this way.  Also doubled the sauce recipe and added 1 tsp. of sugar as other suggested then put a little basil and oregano because I like the seasonings so well.  I think cornstarch and water mixed in with the sauce it a must to get it to thicken a little.  As suggested I kept the chicken in the oven while making the sauce because I didn't want it to get soggy.  It turned out just fine this way.  I will make this dish often!  Thanks!

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and dipped the chicken in flour, egg, then flour again, which meant I had to double the flour mixture & egg mixture ingredients.  I also added about 1/4 c of chardonnay to the bouillion mix.  I've always had chicken piccata with capers, so I tossed in a few capers at the end.  We liked this dish, but I think we'll stay with my old standby recipe.  Thanks so much!

Excellent! I doubled the sauce & flour mixture per others suggestions, and cooked the chicken & sauce separately.
Added 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms (sauted first), and 3T. of capers to the double recipe of sauce.
Served the chicken, topped with sauce on a bed of thin spaghetti noodles tossed with fresh garlic & olive oil..steamed asparagus on the side. Beautiful presentation.. this one is a keeper!

This was excellent and easy!  I did take previous reviewers advice and dipped chicken in flour, then egg mixture and then flour again.  I then refrigerated it for 15 minutes before adding it to the skillet for browning and my coating stayed on perfectly.  A few other small adjustments: I substituted white wine for the boiling water and added sliced mushrooms and capers while simmering.  I will definitely be making this again!

Once again, a five-star recipe that is....good. The taste is quite good but the breading needs help. I suggest skipping the breading altogether and simmering the pounded breasts in the juice of a lemon, a 1/2 cup of chicken broth, a splash of white wine and adding a few minced cloves of garlic. Towards the ends of the cooking time (20 minutes) add a tablespoon of capers in juice. Thicken to a sauce consistency and pour over.

Extremely tastey.  One of our favorites and very easy! I pounded the chicken breasts out which help decrease amount of time you had to saute in butter.  Will be making this one again!

I made this for 12 guests over the weekend. Of all of the dishes I was making (eggplant parmesan, braciola, bruschetta, tiramisu, and chicken piccata), this was by far the easiest and most praised dish. Definitely a keeper! :)

This is a really good recipe. I did alter a bit from an older recipe I had. I added a cup of white wine to 2 cups water and 3 chix boullion in a small pan and reduced for about 20 min. Then after frying the chicken (skipped the egg dip and just used flour) I poured my reduction into the fry pan,  to deglaze and added 3 tbsp of lemon juice and half a stick of butter. Placed the chicken back in the pan for about 10 more min., turning once. This recipe is lick the dish good! LOL

Great flavor. I made according to the recipe for the first time, except for using 2 chicken breast instead of 4, and the flavor was amazing! Will definitely make again, but this time I will follow reviews and place chicken in stove while making the sauce to keep if from getting soggy.

I used this recipe and the reviews and some of my own ideas to make a "wow!" dinner. I pounded the chicken breasts to 1/4" thickness. I used m2 eggs, 1 cup of flour, add italian seasoning, garlic salt and lemon pepper for the breading. I used butter and olive oil to fry them over med high heat till browned and crisp, then put them in a 350 oven to keep warm. Made a gravy base using 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 cup chardonnay. Combined 4 teasp chicken bouillion & 1 cup boiling water. Poured 1/2 bouillion water in skillet with drippings.  Slowly added 1/2 of the wine/flour to a runny thickness.  Added four tablespoons of snipped green onions & 1/2 cup fresh mushrooms.  Poured in the rest of the wine/flour and the bouillion water and thicken to taste.  Added the chicken and spoon gravy over it. 
Sprinkled with lemon pepper and served immediately.  Good with peas and angel hair pasta. This was to die for good!

The flavor of this chicken was phenomenal, but we were a little turned off by the way the coating on the chicken got soggy by simmering in the sauce.  My daughter and fiance have asked me to make this again, but we all agree that the chicken should be browned in the butter and then set aside and kept warm while the sauce is prepared, then briefly dipped in the sauce and served with extra sauce on the side or drizzled on top.  The only changes I made to this were to add about 1/2 cup of white wine to the sauce (I doubled the sauce so we'd have enough to put over our rice) and I added the zest from the lemon to the sauce as well.  I also added just a touch of salt to the seasoned flour before breading the chicken.  I served this with French cut green beans and Slow Cooker Risotto (a personal recipe from an AR member).

I made this using turkey breasts and 1/2 cup of organic chicken broth intead of the bouillon powder and water.  It turned out to be the best piccata I have ever tasted!  The turkey was so incredibly tender (the cuts were thin), we almost didn't need to use a knife.  The flavour was incredible.  I also substituted parsley for paprika.  I will use this easy recipe for turkey and chicken all the time!

Loved this!  Eight minutes per side is plenty.   I added 1/2 C. chardonnay.  Thickened with corn starch.  Next time will flatten chicken or use medallions.  Easy and good.  Will definitely make again.

All i can say is, WOW. This tasted just like the version at my favorite italian resturaunt.  It was also probably the best and easiest thing i have ever made. Messy, but easy.  I made a few changes, as i read the reviews and decided to double the liquid, altho i must say, if you like the sauce i would triple it next time or even quadroupal it.  The recipe as is, is basically no sauce, and i felt doubling it, didnt make enough sauce either.  I used thin chicken cutlets and marinated them in white wine, fresh lemon juice and fresh garlic cloves for about 6 hours before flouring, egging, and then seasoned flouring.  Then i sauted them in butter and olive oil for about 2 mins on each side (they were VERY thin)  they browned beautfifully, and then i placed them in the oven at 250' just to keep warm until i was done making the sauce. After the sauce was bubbling and tasting delicious, i added the chicken cutlets and let them simmer in the sauce about 1-2 mins before serving.  We ate this with angel hair pasta as some suggested.  My husband LOVED it and i LOVED it MORE!!!!!  Just a PS tho...you wont like this dish if you dont like lemon flavor. Next time i may experiement and add some fresh herbs and maybe try it with rice next time.

I love this dish! I also made some changes based on previous experience. I added some lemon zest, lemon pepper and garlic powder to the flour before dipping it in the mixture.  After the chicken is dipped in the egg and flour mixture, i put it on the fridge for a half an hour. This make it so much easier to cook in a pan! It makes it so crispy too! I cook the chicken first and then put it in the oven to finish off while making the sauce.  I add a little flour/water (2tbs flour to 1/4C water) mixture to the sauce to thicken it up. Everyone in the house loves it!

Just like Buca's! I pounded my chicken breasts first, then had to double the flour mixture to cover the larger chicken pieces. The egg/lemon mix does not need to be doubled.  After browning, I removed them & added 1/3 cup white wine to deglaze pan. I doubled the water/lemon juice/chicken boullion sauce (I also added a tspn of cornstarch to this sauce to thicken just a tad, otherwise it's too thin. I've made this twice so far.) ADD CAPERS 5 MINUTES BEFORE SERVING! YOU MUST ADD CAPERS! YUM!

I should have listened to the recommendations that others gave, by doubling the recipe and double coating the chicken. It started to crumble off a bit while I was cooking it. It still tasted mouth watering wonderful, that is why I gave it 5 stars.

The idea was good for this recipe, but it really lacked in flavor.  After I fried the chicken, I removed the chicken and set it aside. I then added mushrooms and some garlic finely chopped.  When the mushrooms were done, I added 1 tablespoon of flour and mixed it in and picked up all the fried bit.  I then added 1/4 of white wine, 1/4 cup of lemon juice and the bouillon mixture.  After it started to thicken I added the chicken back in for about 10 minutes.  I garnished it with italian parsley and some chives.  Taste again for salt and pepper.  It was delicous.

I followed some others' advice and pounded the chicken, added 2Tbs capers, and added lemon zest.  I had no pinot grigio to add, as suggested, so I splashed some Marsala into the pan (I didn't add too much, though, because I know this isn't Chicken Marsala!).  I didn't use any extra flour on my pounded chicken breasts, and I think that's why I didn't have the problem others had where the breading separated from the chicken.  A lighter dusting doesn't fall off and my chicken was brown and crispy, too!  As suggested, I removed the sauteed chicken from the pan, made the sauce, and tossed the chicken back in at the end.  PERFECT!

Very Good Very Moist. I did add some additional lemon juice, because I love the flavor and a little white wine. I also added some capers and wow wee, a great meal. Thanks for sharing.

This was sooo delicious! I did change a couple things.
I browned the chicken in butter and olive oil, I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and placed the chicken in the oven after browning, I sliced some onions and fried them in the butter/olive oil before adding the chicken broth. I also didn't re-add the chicken to the broth. I thickened up the broth with cornstarch mixed with milk and made a sort of gravy to put ontop of the chicken. It was soooo yummy!

This review/rating is based on the changes suggested by other reviewers. However...this was awesome!!!! Double the sauce, use chicken broth instead of boullion cubes, use chicken cutlets, remove chicken while making sauce and add sugar to sauce. I was eating the sauce up with a spoon! Also, served with angel hair and summer squash.

Very good recipe but I also tweaked it a bit.  I found that when I made it the first time it came out soggy and breading didn't stick and I always dip flour, egg, then flour.  

So now I cook the chicken til done and add sauce about 1 minute before serving.  I add a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit and I also add fresh sliced mushrooms in the sauce and right before serving, capers.  I also added double the spices to the flour, a pinch of tex mex and some bread crumbs.

delicious! i am learning to cook real meals, instead of just sweets, since i plan on moving out soon. this was the first chicken dish i have tried. i ran out of the flour mixture half way through, so i strongly suggest doubling that. other than that i have no complaints. WARNING: if you think that you are going to have crispy chicken, you are mistaken. mine was not soggy, but it was not crispy at all. if you want crispy chicken, may i suggest making the broth/sauce seperatley and then pouring over right before serving? if you do not mind non-crispy, simply yummy chicken, make as stated in the recipe.

Wow this was so good!!  I had never had capers before and some friends (WC) convienced me to try them.  For this I double dipped the chicken (flour-egg-flour), fried it in EVOO, used chicken broth (1 cup) , half a cup of white wine, and added 8oz of sliced mushrooms and 2T of capers.  It was so good.  Even my 3 year old ate it up!! Thanks for the recipe.  And thanks Ladyjaypee for the recommendation!

This was a treat to the taste buds! I doubled the sauce and realized during cooking that it was a bit too sour. I modified it by adding more water, more chicken stock, and more butter.  I also thickened the sauce by using some corn starch and added capers before serving. Yum! Served with spiral pasta and hot buttery garlic bread! Also makes a good dipping sauce for the bread!

Took other reviewer's advise and double dipped the chicken.  Sauted mushrooms in a little olive oil and set aside.  Added extra chicken broth and a little white wine.  Used lower salt chicken broth in place of chicken grandules.  Added the muchrooms and the sauce from the chicken on top of white rice and mixed it in.  Loved the recipe as did my guests.  Also served the roasted vegetables from this site and a chopped salad.

Excellent recipe. I did make a cream sauce with the juice. I used canned chicken broth 14 oz. instead of bullion and water. I made a roux with 4 tbls of butter and 4 tbls. of flour. Cook for just a few minutes added the broth and kept addind remainder of chicken broth to desired consistency.poured it over the chicken really yummy. Great sauce for pasta. Overall a really good piccata recipe. Try it with veal "really good"

Just made this tonight and I thought it was delicious.  I used three thick chicken breasts and cut them in each in half to make 6 thinner breasts.  I doubled the flour mixture and the water/bouillon mixture (otherwise there definately wouldn't be enough).  I floured the chicken, then into the egg, then into the flour again.   My chicken wasn't soggy at all and my coating stayed put. I think it's because I browned it pretty well first in the butter, then I took the lid off the last five minutes of the simmering time, which helped thicken the sauce.   I added fresh mushrooms, capers and a little white cooking wine and let that  simmer the recommended time.   I served it with white rice and it was excellent!   I'll definately be making this again.

I made this tonight, and I thought it was excellent!  Definitely would make more sauce next time, though.  The flavor was great, and I am sure adding wine, mushrooms and/or capers would be good with it too.  I didn't have a problem with the coating falling off, but technically you should dip in flour, then egg wash, then the coating for best results (I am in culinary school - this is a basic).  I will make again because this was good and very simple!

This dish is very very tasty. I had one problem----the chicken browned very nicely  in the butter after I added the water and put the lid on the pan all of the nice browning fell off and was soggy. Any suggestions.

I have lost all faith in what other people say about a recipe.  It is a sogy version of shake and bake.  Smelled good because of the garlic, but give me a break

Yummy!! I followed a few of the other recommendations - pounded the chicken flat, refrigerated it after the egg & flour coatings, doubled the flour and sauce ingredients, added capers and white wine, etc. When the chicken was done I removed it to a plate and put my angel hair pasta right into the sauce, tossed, then served in a bowl topped with the chicken. Even my kids loved it - my 4 year old gave me a thumbs up half way through dinner!

Really great but a little bit salty.  Next time I will use 1 cup of water because it will cut back on the salt and it will give more sauce.  I added capers too which are delicious.  I took someone elses suggestion and put the breaded chicken in the refrigerator for a bit and the breading seemed to stay on.  I also browned the chicken in a combo of 2 TBS butter and 2 TBS olive oil.  And you will have to double the flour mixture - you'll have some left over but it's easier when there is more rather than less.

Beautiful!! I double recipe for flour, Added wine and a couple of slabs of butter in sauce, but fried in only olive oil. I simmered for only 10 minutes, any longer the flour coating on chicken may begin to fall off. I microwaved slices of lemon and placed them on last minute for presentation.

An excellent recipe! To avoid sticking, I use olive oil and a touch of butter when  browning. I also use white wine and more garlic. Very good quality and also very forgiving !

YUM YUM YUM!  I have made this with Veal and Chicken - both times delicious!  I do have to flatten the chicken before coating and I still have to master keeping the breading on the chicken while cooking - but the taste - FANTASTIC!  I loved it, my husband loved it - even the kids loved it!

used white wine and paste chicken stock/water as the liquid.  Also added shallots to the sauce.  
I chose to remove the breast while the sauce cooked, then poured the sauce over just before serving.  It kept the chicken crispier.

Very good! Store was out of chicken breasts (I know, can you believe it!) So I used the chicken strips instead, turned out great. I did take chicken out and put in oven at 200 degrees while sauce was cooking, so chicken would not get soggy. Put chicken back into sauce for last few minutes....it was awesome, will definitely make again

The sauce was way too acidic.  I even tried adding a small amount of sugar as others have suggested.  The chicken by itself was delicious, but it's not a true piccata when dipped in egg.  Piccata is only dredged in flour.

This recipe is delicious and easy. The first time I made it I did not turn it over halfway through cooking, and it yurned out fine. I pounded the chicken breasts to about one half their height before coating. The end result is tender and very yummy! This is one of the best chicken recipes on this site.

This was very flavorful for the few ingredients required. I added some capers because I love them in piccata. My first time making it and it was pretty easy. I served it with Green Beans Amandine (also from this site) and rice pilaf. My only complaint would be to at least double the water because there wasn't enough of the delicious sauce.

This was way too lemony for us ~ I used fresh Meyer lemons.  The chicken itself was tender and flavorful, but we just didn't care for the lemon sauce.  I ended up throwing out the sauce & just making a flavorful pasta side dish.

This dish is very flavorful! I made two minor changes: I fried the chicken in grapeseed oil instead of butter and used 1/2 cup of reduced-sodium chicken broth in lieu of the bouillon powder and water. There are only two things I plan to change the next time I make it. 1) Cook the chicken longer in just the oil, so that the breading is more crispy. 2) Double the amount of liquid so there's more delicious sauce.

No need to double the sauce or to make it in a different pan.  I made this twice, first just as stated and the second as others recommended and I would go just as teh recipe states - it is perfect.  My family loved it!

This was excellent. I make my own version of  chicken piccata but wanted to follow a recipe this time to see how it would differ from my own version. I used 3 chicken breats and sliced them in half lengthwise to make thin pieces. I doubled the water, chicken bouillon and lemon juice as I wanted to toss some cooked spaghetti in the sauce, and I also added about 2 tablespoons chopped capers to the sauce. Super easy to make and everyone loved it.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. The sauce did not come out well at all, and the chicken barely had a lemony flavor to it... it just tasted like unseasoned fried chicken.

I know a lot of people make a lot of changes to this recipe, but I thought it looked fine the way it was, so I followed it pretty closely.  I pounded the chicken thin, added a couple pinches of salt to the flour and I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter.  That's it - no baking in the oven, no doubling the sauce, etc.  It came out wonderful just following the recipe and it was easy!

I LOVED this recipe!! I followed the following suggestions: dredged in AP flour, diped in beaten egg whites then dregded again, shaking off any excess. I cooked the chicken in butter/olive oil till brown and crispy. Make sure to keep the chicken warm after removing from the pan. To the pan I added 1/2 cup lemon juice, 1/2 cup chicken stock, 1 cup white cooking wine (we don't have alcohol in our home). Reduce till slightly thickened.  At the end whisk in about 1 tbl butter. I do not return the chicken to the pan rather I plate the chicken and pour the wonderful sauce on top. I couldn't get enough!

We made this for dinner tonight and loved it.  I followed several of the reviews and made a couple of my own modifications.  I very lightly floured prior to the egg wash.  I used Panko breadcrumbs instead of flour for the garlic/paprika mixture.  After browning, I removed the chicken while making the sauce.  I doubled the recipe and also added some white wine, garlic, some cornstarch dissloved in water for thickening and followed the suggestion to add just a bit of sugar.  The sugar helped round out the sourness of the lemon. I let the chicken simmer in the sauce for a few minutes.  It was a big hit that we'll make often.

Simple and good. The chicken pieces were breaded the night before cooking. Doubled the lemon juice. After work, I just placed the chicken pieces on a baking sheet and sprayed lightly with oil. Broiled in the oven for ~5min/side. While made the sauce. Doubled the sauce, added lemon zest and starch. When the sauce began to boil, added the chicken to coat.

Easy and absolutely delicious.  In order to ensure a good coating, double the flour mixture and double coat it, ensuring you leave in the frig for 30 min or so.  Also, if you love lemon, double the lemon in both the broth and egg mixture. So juicy, it really was amazing!

Impressive and great flavor. I made a few changes based on other reviews. I dusted the chicken with flour, then the egg mixture, then the seasoned flour and let it sit in the fridge for about a half hour. That seemed to help the seasoned flour stick better. I also browned and cooked the chicken to nearly done before putting the liquid in for the sauce for just the last few minutes. My first batch turned out great. I didn't do this with the second batch - put the liquid in right away like the recipe calls for and the breading started coming off/getting soggy. So, make the sauce very last for just a few minutes or take the chicken out and do it separately like some other's suggest.

This was a winner in our house!  I did take another viewers suggestion and browned the chicken first.  I also tripled the sauce and added a small amount of flour, for a slightly thicker sauce to use over pasta.  Will make again.

Chicken piccata is one of my favorite dishes. After reading the reviews may I suggest NOT using egg to coat the chicken before breading it. Pound the chicken flat first and then coat it just with the flour. The egg is what makes the coating come off during cooking and also makes it mushy. Also try using organic chicken broth instead of bullion cubes and water. This will make a huge difference.

I loved this!!  The lemon flavor was great.  I did reduce the amount of butter by about half which increased the lemon flavor.  The  extra sauce went well over steamed red potatoes.  Yummy!

This has become one of my favorite chicken recipes.  I did add a couple more tablespoons of lemon juice to intensify the flavor.  The chicken turned out very moist and flavorful!

This is a very tasty recipe. I tweeked it a bit. Instead of using garlic powder, I used 2 garlic cloves. I added about 2 tablespoons of wine with the chicken bouillon mix. And before I even started on the meal, I marinated my chicken in spices, lemon juice and olive oil. Served it with pasta and marinara sauce. Husband even loved it!

This really requires more flavor.  1 TBS capers, an additional garlic clove or 2 will help.  It's also lacking in salt.  1/2 tsp is suggested.

Made this last night for the family. It was just OK.  Served it over pasta.  Followed a lot of the suggestions.  Pounded the chicken thinker, and doubled dipped the flour, doubled the sauce, added capers etc.  I did not cook the chicken in the sauce as I can imagine the breading trouble.  I poured some sauce in the pasta and the rest over the platter of chicken.  If I make it again, I'll have to play with it a little.  To much work for too little flavor.

I also really enjoyed this recipe, but did find that the breading got a little mushy. I added sliced garlic and some minced lemon zest when I added in the liquids, and also reduced the sauce a little after removing the chicken. Very easy recipe, with good flavor, and easy to riff on (I used a bit of Dashi No Moto instead of broth since that's all I had)... a good basic  recipe for the repertoire.

Pretty good recipe. I used fresh lemon juice and followed other reviewers suggestions and dipped the chicken in flour, egg, then flour again. Next time I will use chicken broth instead of chicken bouillon powder and add a little white wine.

WOW! What an easy and delicious recipe! I was wanting to make a good meal at home by using common ingredients I already had. I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted fantastic! My husband loved it. I served it with steamed vegetables and it was a hit! I love quick and easy recipes that taste like you've been cooking for hours!

This is a very good fast and easy base recipe.  I did make several changes.
First, I omitted the egg entirely.  I added all seasoning to the flour mixture
(1t onion & garlic powder, ½t paprika, ¾t Italian seasoning).  I browned the chicken in 2t EVOO (not butter) and set aside (covered) on a plate.  I doubled the sauce, as suggested by others
but instead of using the ½c boiling water, added white wine along with  8oz. sliced fresh mushrooms and cooked for approx. 10 minutes on medium.  I returned the chicken to the
pan – turning several times for another 10 minutes.  Just before serving, I added 1t corn starch (w/white wine) to thicken the sauce a little.  Excellent served over Basmati rice.
This was on the table in about 30 minutes!

A great standard recipe that can be modified to your taste. I did not use the egg at all because I figured it would become mushy. I simply shook the chicken breasts in a freezer bag with the seasoned flour (I also added a little thyme), and added the lemon juice the same time I added the chicken broth. No problem with sogginess and it had a great flavor. I used half margarine and half olive oil to brown the breasts, and also added minced garlic to the pan. I halved the bouillon powder. I added fresh mushrooms and cut up asparagus also. In the end I added corn starch to thicken it all up. Yum!

We enjoyed this recipe and I did take in to account several of the  reviews.  I did double dip the chicken after soaking it in the egg/lemon for several minutes.  I added a little olive  oil while cooking the chicken.  I removed the chicken after cooking for several minutes on each side.  I then sauteed a little garlic and a few mushrooms before beginning my sauce. I just added the chicken bouillon and water to the mushrooms and garlic.  I added the chicken back and covered for six minutes.  I flip the chicken and cooked five more minutes.  The sauce was absorbed in the coating on my chicken so I removed the chicken to a plate and added 1/4 C. cooking wine to the skillet to deglaze the chicken particles.  I then tried to make another sauce with  more water, bouillon,fresh lemon  juice, and a little cornstarch.  The chicken was great.  It was so moist and leaving the chicken on a plate while the sauce cooked and thicken helped the outer crust to become more crisy.  I served the chicken  over rice with sauce and a squash and zucchinni medley.   A good recipe but  like everything else  this will need adjusting to your personal taste!

This did turn out very tasty, but like others, I did have to tweak it a bit...  I doubled the flour, egg, and bullion mixtures.  To the flour mixture, I added quite a bit of paprika, sage, turmeric, and garlic powder. (which all helped to make a wonderful flavor)  I did flour the chicken, then dip in the egg mixture, then flour again, and the bredding stayed on quite nicely.  However, after simmering for 10 minutes, the chicken had become very soggy, so I cooked it another 15 minutes with no lid, and although there was no sauce for the chicken, it still turned out great.  Very quick and tasty, but does need additions to be 5 star rating...

This was a tasty recipe!  The breading was the only downfall.  Next time im going to cook the breaded chicken first, set aside, then cook the sauce on its own and pour over the top!  All in all my husband loved it!!

I didn't have any problem with the coating sliding off because I first dried and lightly floured each chicken breast. However I had to make several changes to make this truly a five star recipe, therefore I had to give this a 4 star. I added summer savory for added taste boost and used chicken stock that I had made previously and frozen instead of the too salty boullion. I did like the fresh lemon and think that it added to the final tastiness of the recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  As suggested by others, I pounded the chicken breasts, then refrigerated them for an hour or so after dipping before I browned them in a mixture of butter and olive oil.  They were perfect!  After browning, I removed the chicken from the pan and deglazed it with lemon juice (I used more than the recipe called for) and 1/2 cup of white wine.  I returned the browned chicken breasts to the pan and cooked them for 10 minutes, then added 1/2 pound of sauteed mushrooms and 1 can of artichoke hearts, cut up, and cooked another 5-8 minutes, until done. Just before serving, I added 2 tablespoons of capers.  I served the Chicken Piccata with Fettuccine Alfredo V (also from Allrecipes.com), a Caesar salad and fresh broccoli.  It was a wonderful meal that both my family and our guests thoroughly enjoyed.  Thanks for the great recipe!

fantastic recipe...I also doubled the lemon juice etc and added 1/4 cup white cooking wine. 
make sure you refrig your chicken for 1/2 hr prior to browning...helps keep the coating on.
delicious!!!!!

As written - 3 stars, however I made the following changes.  First, flattened the chicken, and then breaded etc...  Browned the chicken in butter and olive oil, removed and then deglazed the pan with white wine, followed by lemon juice (2x more), and chicken broth (not from bouillon).  Added chicken back in along with a jar of artichokes, simmered for about 10 minutes and then stirred in capers at the end and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Served with roasted spinach!  Now it's 5 stars!

This is awesome.  I make it fairly often and it has kind of become my specialty.  I took the advice of others and added some things - I add way more lemon than is called for and I sometimes throw lemon slices into the simmer, and I also add about a half a can of chopped artichokes, a couple tablespoons of capers, and a quarter cup or so of white wine.  Sometimes I serve it over roasted garlic mashed potatoes, and other times I serve it over pasta.  It's even better when garnished with fresh parsley.  This is a great recipe that, with some tweaking, will garner oohs and ahhs from all your guests.

Simple, simple, simple!  I pounded my chicken first to make it cook more evenly.  I like to garnish this with lemon slices and fresh rosemary.  Served with rice and fresh green beans.  Was a big hit!

Excellent! I added the capers and mushrooms as suggested. I had bouillon cubes instead of powder and used only one, and added a few splashes of white wine. Also used 2T butter and 2T olive oil. Easy and so good.

I made and froze this recipe for 50 people. I received so many compliments and so many wanted the recipe.  It is easy to make, doesn't take alot of time, and it freezes very well.  I froze the sauce separately.  I garnished it with fresh lemon slices.  It looked and tasted like a gourmet entree.

This was good.  I served it over plain basmati rice.  The flavor wasn't as complex as the chicken piccata I've had in restaurants, but I am guessing that is because there was no white wine or capers.  I liked it, though, and I love recipes where I have everything on hand already.

This was awesome!  A good recipe for company.  I pounded the chicken breast first.  Added garlic, Chardonnay and capers.  My husband once had a bad Chicken Piccata dinner at a restaurant and hasn't eaten it since.  I didn't tell him what this was called until he finished his second helping!  He loved it as did our 18 mth old and finicky 3 1/2 yr old.  I served it over rice.  I'll definitely be making this one again.

Loved it! Was very easy to make and had a fantastic taste...however more sauce then it calls for needs to be made. Next time I'm doubling (at least) the sauce ingredients. I always like to have some sauce in the pan at the end...

I made this for an impromptu dinner party.  This recipe was awesome and quick!  The chicken breasts I used were pretty thick so I pounded them flat before dipping.  After reading some of the reviews I sprayed the skillet with Pam so the breading would stay on. I also added capers at the end while simmering to give it additional flavor.  Everyone raved at how good it was and there were no leftovers.

My whole family loved this, including my finicky kids.  It tasted like restaurant quality piccata.  I did add about 1/2 cup white cooking wine and when finished cooking, I added capers.  I served it over white rice.  There was none left!  Definitely a keeper!

I loved this recipe  It was easy and quick.  The chicken turned out juicy, tender and full of flavor.  I added a little wine to the sauce.  I know this recipe will be a regular at my house.

This was really good.  Very simple to prepare.  My two and four year olds ate it too.  I added a splash of dry white wine to it (maybe 1-2 tbsp.) just because all the piccata recipes I've tried have included it.  I followed the recipe as stated and didn't have any problems with the coating coming off.  Will definately make this again.

The flavor is amazing.  The only change I made was to substitute chicken broth for the bouillon.  My only issue is that you are pouring a liquid into the already nice and browned, crispy chicken.  It takes away from the nice, crispy texture when you pour that liquid into the skillet following the "browning" step.  Next time I probably won't use the liquid!

I combined this recipe with Mushroom Piccata. After breading the chicken, I added some fresh pepper and lemon pepper.  I did the following for the sauce:  I added  cup of fresh mushrooms, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1 cups chicken broth, 1 cup white wine wine with 4 tablespoons lemon juice.   I also added 1/4 tsp of lemon peel. This makes a lot of sauce for 2 pieces of chicken  I also used 2 tsp of cornstarch.  next time try:2 tbl. of capers while simmering, and a clove of garlic.

Yumyumyumyum. Made this exactly as is except with 3 chicken breasts instead of 4. I would think 4 chicken breasts would've crowded the pan, so use an extra large skillet and make a bit of extra sauce.
As there was no salt or pepper in the coating, I did add a little bit along with the paprika and garlic powder. Otherwise, everything was perfection. Will definitely be making again.

Tip: Give yourself plenty of time to dissolve the bouillon in the water. Maybe it's just me, but it always takes longer to dissolve than I think it will!

This was pretty good...I followed a few tips from others...we pounded chicken and dipped 1st in flour then egg then flour.  Browned the chicken(which pretty much cooked chicken all the way), then put in some 9x13 pans and kept warm in oven while making sauce.  We tried to double sauce but then got confused as to if we should add more butter since we were done browning.  The butter kinda goes away as well, so we did add some more butter and as others suggested add a 1/2 tsp. of sugar.  Since we doubled we added 4 tbls. of lemon juice, but i think next time i will cut back to 3 when doubling.  The sauce was good, just had an initial tang to it, but it actually grew on me.  Also next time instead of sugar I might try adding wine to see the taste difference.

This was amazing. It is one of the best chicken recipes that I have tried on this site! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. I paired it with a Lemon Basmati rice found on the site and some steamed broccoli! Perfection.

very, very good. I used 6 pieces of chicken tenderloin. Next time I will make more of the sauce. I made rice and asparagus for sides and the flavor the sauce has compliments both of them perfectly with this chicken

It was tasteless and mushy. The coating just went to mush once you added the broth and cooked it. Very disappointed.

Really really good.  I took another readers advice and cooked the chicken in olive oil and butter first and let it sit in the oven while I made the sauce... Really delicious and I served it over a be of pasta...

Needed more sauce.  I doubled it and still needed more.  Also would have preferred more seasoning and lemons.

Turned out actually good.  Was a little worried when I tasted the sauce...it was so sour.  I added a couple tablespoons of cream, one tablespoon sugar, some salt and pepper.  Mellowed it out some.  I added some leftover sauted mushrooms, onions and carrots to the pan after the chicken cooks.  I think that this would be just as good with out the breading, as others stated it got a little mushy with the sauce.  I think next time i will just flour the chicken, fry in the oil then add the sauce.  My people all enjoyed it, though.

This was pretty good.  I cut the chicken into strips and cooked the strips in my electric skillet.  It did feel like it was missing something, so I'm going to make it a few more times with some additions.  I served mine with brown rice and whole green beans.  :)

I made this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it. Nice, light dish. I took another reviewers advice and kept the chicken in the oven at 250 egrees while preparing the sauce. I also substituted chicken broth for the chicken bouillon powder and added a bit more lemon juice (I like the bite of lemon personally). Added the capers last 2-3 min of simmering and it came out beautifully. Will make again!

"Exceptionally perfect" says the husband.   I used 2 teaspoons of chicken bouillon powder and it was TOO salty. Dumped out that "broth" and started over with fresh boiling water and only 1 teaspoon. Much tastier. Wonder if it matters what chicken bouillon powder you use? In any case, used hot Hungarian paprika and a real lemon. He's asking for it again tomorrow, so this definitely seems to be a keeper.

This was exactly what I thought Chicken Piccata should be. I used butter and olive oil to fry my chicken.  I did add capers , minced garlic and 1/2 cup white wine to the recipe, also salt & pepper to the flour mixture. There was no need to thicken the sauce it was perfect.  Will be making this for company again very soon.

I would make it again with some modifications. I found the chicken bouillon to be a bit overpowering... Next time, I will try the white wine recommendation.

Followed the recipe with no substitutions and chicken came out good. My husband and I both liked it, but it was a bit too lemony. Next time I will reduce the lemon juice just a little.

i was really happy with this meal idea.  I pounded the chicken pretty flat to tenderise, but otherwise I followed this recipe exact.  Its really mild.  My entire family liked it...i have young children.

Well, the chicken turned out great, but the sauce was horrendous! I used fresh lemon instead of the stuff out of the bottle. Is that why it was WAY too lemoney? I added sugar to the sauce to make it somewhat edible.

My husband and I really liked this.  The chicken was very moist and tender.  It was not a big hit with the kids, they hardly ate any of it.  I don't think they liked the lemony taste of the chicken.

My changes were:  Pound chicken, dredge in flour first, then egg, then panko bread crumbs. I added capers.  I then sauteed my already cooked fettucini in the chicken drippings with even more lemon juice and butter and a lot of parmesan cheese and it was very yummy. Thanks for the recipe.

First I have to admit that I rarely follow recipes exactly.  So going off the many review recommendations..... I substituted chicken broth for bouillon/water, grated in some lemon zest, added white wine and capers to the sauce (all in "looks about right" measurements) and then thickened with some cornstarch.  It was very good, even my picky eater agreed.  Will be making this again!

Positively delicious. I am a lemon addict, so I added two extra tablespoons of lemon juice. It made all the difference. But even without the extra juice, it's still scrumptious! This is fabulous!

This recipe was 5 stars all the way!!! It rivaled the Cheesecake Factory's Chicken Piccata which is my all time favorite. I did make a few changes based on other reviews and to suit my preference. Like some other reviewers I also like my breaded chicken to be crispy so I followed the recipe for deep south fried chicken on this site for the chicken. I also used 3 big boneless skinless chicken breasts cut in half rather than pounding them thin which I think works better and it holds its shape better. I fried the chicken till it was crispy and browned and fully cooked and then put in the oven to keep warm while I made the sauce. I doubled the sauce, added some dried basil and italian seasoning, also added a couple tblsp of butter. I added the chicken to the sauce to coat right before serving. Served with whole wheat spaghetti and used the extra sauce on the pasta. It was AMAZING! I will be making this once a week!!!!

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site!  I've made it more times than I can count.  I prefer to double the sauce for spooning over pasta and add capers, otherwise I make it exactly as written.  I serve with angel hair.

It's been a long time since I cooked meat, so I'll assume the dryness was my fault.

This is a super-easy recipe and the chicken comes out really tender and flavorful without a lot of extra stuff or hassle. Worked great for me, thanks for posting!

A little too soggy, a lot too salty. I couldn't really taste the lemon flavor, too overpowered by the garlic powder/boullions.

Not so crazy about this dish.  It was okay, but don't think I'll make it again.  It was kind of bland and I wasn't sure what to add to "fix" it.  I did add white wine to the sauce, but it still didn't help.  Sorry.  I really WANTED to like it!

I hate reviewing a recipe when I make changes before I try the original, but I didn't think 1/8 tsp of paprika and garlic powder would be enough, so I added more of both to the flour. I also made double the sauce and poured half into the chicken, the other half I added one clove of crushed garlic, and a dash of paprika, and some corn starch to thicken the sauce, I served the sauce over pasta (but not the chicken) and it tasted great!

This was excellent both times I made it.  The first time I found that all I had was the 'fake' lemon juice in a little plastic lemon...and it came out very well in spite of that, but I believed in my heart of hearts that fresh lemon would push it over the top to greatness.  In my frenzy of enthusiasm, I over did it with the fresh lemon the second time around- it was still outstanding, but the beauty of the lemon is in its subtlety- so don't make the same mistake I made an go too nuts.  Other than that, I basically followed the recipe and reviews, doubled the sauce, browned the chicken and put in the oven while the sauce reduced.  Adding some white wine, letting it simmer down, then a small amount of cornstarch thickened up things quite nicely...threw some capers in at the end as well.  Good stuff!

This recipe is great, but I couldn't figure out what was missing... white wine! Of course! I too, like another member, butterfly the chicken breast and then between 2 pieces of parchment paper, pound the breast until it's about 1/4" thick before I dip in egg mixture. Then after, I return the chicken to the pan and add the broth. I pour a small amount of white wine (about 1/4 - 1/3 cup) white wine, place the lid on and simmer on low for 15 minutes. This time, I used sauvignon blanc -it's what was in the fridge and already open.

Delicious! My husband and I loved this and I will make it again. The chicken does not need to "simmer" for 20 minutes, I simmered for about 10. I used I can't believe it's not butter, instead of real butter, and "poultry seasoning" as I couldn't find the bouillon. Served it with broccoli and cous cous- a perfect meal!

This has turned into a favorite.  Definitely refrigerate your floured chicken for some time before cooking.  Helps keep the breading on as some others suggested.

Very nice!  Cooked the chicken, removed it from the pan and then the sauce so breading would not get soggy.  Double-breaded the chicken. Also thickened with a bit of cornstarch and added a touch more lemon juice.

Excellent recipe. so simple my fourteen year old daughter decided to surprise me and make it for dinner. She made the cutlets thinner, made more of the flour mixture and tripled the sauce and it was delicious! will definitely make again.

Flavor was ok, but we were turned off by how mushy the coating was after simmering in the covered pan for 20 minutes.  If I try this again, I think I would simmer the coated chicken in the butter by itself for about 15 minutes on low heat, and then stir in the sauce (of which I doubled and was glad that I did) only for the purpose of glazing it for a minute or two. In addition, the mushy coating falls off very easily and doesn't stick to the chicken.

Loved the texture of the chicken and the flavor of the sauce it makes.  I had to add a little broth because it was a little salty and lemony for my taste, but that was a small addition to a great recipe.  Will make again!

This is really tasty.  When my 3 year old says "this is the Bomb."  I know it's a winner.  

 The only thing is after I brown the chicken I don't put it back in the liquid because experience has told me that it will lose the breading.  But that's up to you.

I made this tonight for dinner.  It is fabulous!  I tried it a few different ways that reviewers recommended, but it's best just as published and looks very appetizing.  I'm making it for an elegant dinner for 60 people in a few days, along with Garlic Mashed Red Potatoes and Airport Bob's Green Beans.  YUM! Add a Mandarin Orange Caesar Salad and Buster Bar Ice Cream Dessert and it's a hit!

After reading the reviews and seeing how everyone was saying this came out soggy I changed it. First thing I did was double batter and flour it. Fried it in some oil for 2 mins on each side. Than turned the oven on @400 for 15 mins. While chicken was cooking I did the sauce doubled it, used chicken broth instead and added some parsley, basil, s+p and like a tablespoon of sugar. Added some flour to thicken. Than poured the sauce ontop when chicken came out. This is really a excellent chicken. A great change from the norm. Will def make again. Thanks

I had never tried chicken piccata before, but this is abolutely delcious, a wonderful, delicate flavor!  I pounded the breasts flat, and double-dipped them (flour, then eggs, then flour again, then let them sit about 10 minutes so the coating would not come off. Wonderful.

I made this as part of a menu for a party, scaling to serve 20. I followe otehr reviewers' suggestions.. flour mix then egg then flour again, sitting on fridge for 30 minutes before frying in olive oil. I also cut breasts in half length and then in half in width to make medallions. I made these earlier in the day so I fried the chicken then set aside and made the sauce later on before the party. I didnt make the with as much lemon as called for because i used fresh squeezed and simmered the sauce with cut lemon slices instead. It was a big hit! I used this along with the Herbed rice pilaf recipe also from this site. Thank you for a great addition!

I make this constantly! Love it! I only make a few minor changes due to personal preference (original recipe is good too!). I use 2 tbsp. of olive oil and 2 tbsp. of butter to cut down on butter. Also, I only use 2 chicken breasts (pounded thin), but kept all the other ingredients the same, so essentially double the sauce--yum! I serve over white rice. Delicious! I have it memorized!

made this recipe and it turned out great! I follow the comments under the recipe. It turn out great because of it. I coated the chicken in the flour mixture and I put it in the fridge for about 1/2 hour. Then I cooked it in a pan. It stayed together nicely.

I then made the sauce and added the cornstarch to it which made it nice and thick. I added it last to the chicken in the pan for only a minute, and then moved it to the plate with fresh veggies. It was so yummy that everyone finished their plates! I will make this again soon.

a lot of work and the batter part didn't stick very well.  don't think i'd make again. UPDATE: i read other reviews and took their advice. i added olive oil with the butter and made sure the chicken was a deep golden brown before taking chicken out. i also doubled the sauce and added a little sugar to the sauce. this time it came out a lot better.

This was really good!  I didn't change the ingredients one bit, just how I cooked it.  I dredged the chicken in the flour mixture, then egg, then back in the flour.  I browned it in butter and olive oil.  I took out the chicken and set it aside.  Since we were have ours with angel hair I took a couple laddles of the pasta water (after the pasta was just about done because of the starch content to help thicken the sauce) instead of using the 1/2 C of boiling water.  Then I added the boullion and the lemon juice then cooked it for a couple minutes.  Instead of putting the sauce over the chicken I used tongs to remove the pasta from the water and put in the sauce pan and tossed it a few times then served the chicken on top of the pasta.

I added minced garlic cloves to the egg mixture and the sauce, and lemon pepper to the sauce. I reduced the sauce a bit before adding 1 tbsp corn starch dissolved in 1 tbsp water to thicken it a bit. Capers would have been ideal, but I didn't have any, so I garnished the chicken with chopped cilantro (harmonious with the lemon flavour) and lemon.

My very first time rating a recipe but felt compelled to do so. I made this exactly as written, was so incredibly easy. My 15 year old son asks for this at least once a week and this is what he wanted for his birthday dinner. Thank you so much!

This recipe scared me at first, it sounded somewhat complex. Boy, was I wrong. This was almost offensively easy to make. When they say double the recipe for sauce, they mean the broth...great idea! I made it over rice and it came out delicious. If you like lemon, this is a fantastic recipe.

This is the 2nd time I've made this.  I LOVE this chicken.  My husband thinks it's a "3.8", so I gave it a 4 star rating.  I followed all of cristyscookin's suggestions for doubling the sauce, adding the tsp of sugar, etc.  Hubby liked it better this time with the sugar.  With 3 chicken breasts, I barely had enough flour.  If using 4, I would definitely double the flour to be sure I had enough.

We double or triple the the sauce because it's so good & we enjoy it on angel hair pasta. We also pound the chicken out thin into a cutlet. The chicken cooks faster & absorbs the flavor better. We've also added capers & artichokes when we have them on hand. This dish is a regular in our kitchen!

It took one hour to go from frozen chicken breasts to a nice meal on the table.  It was quick and delicious and I'll make it many times in the future.  I used two chicken breasts instead of four.

Delicious! This is great because it is made with things you have on hand and since it is a stovetop dish, the oven does not heat up the house during the summer. The chicken is very moist.

My husband really liked this (why I gave it 4 stars), and I thought it was pretty good, but not memorable (3 stars for me).  

I added capers, and used a lot of fresh lemon juice.  I used a lot more seasoning in the flour, and the flavor still did not come through.  This definitely needs fresh garlic and sea salt.

This was a so-so recipe...my boyfriend didn't eat it at all. He is a chicken lover and usually eats most everything I prepare. The flour coating on the chicken came off very easily in the pan. Also this needed a bit more flavor, perhaps some salt?

This was a great base recipe- I used 6 large chicken breasts so i actually tripled the sauce and served w the sauce over penne.  I added some marinated artichoke hearts, capers, and white wine to the sauce. And, like the other reviewers, I cooked the chicken all the way through and just dipped it in the sauce for a few min at the end- the breading ended up fine.

This recipe was quick and easy and REALLY good. I actually marnated the chicken first for about half a day in some Italian garlic and herb marinade. It made it that much better! Very tender and juicy!

Even after following suggestions from other reviewers I just didn't love this recipe. Maybe it has to do with not liking lemon flavoring all that much. Chicken did indeed come out quite tender. Thanks anyways for the recipe.

This recipe was so good! I followed others advice, adding mushroom, capers and increasing the sauce.  I think the really good part was I used talipia instead of chicken.  It was dish licking great.

Wonderful! Next time I will double the sauce as well as flour, egg, and flour again. I served it over Angel Hair tossed with olive oil, parmesan, and tomato basil seasonings with veggies on the side. My husband and I both loved it!

I did not have success with this recipe. I followed the recommendation of some of the posters here and omitted the egg.  Maybe I should have used it instead.  The breading became soggy and slimy and came right off the chicken.  I ended up with chicken breasts boiled in a lemon sauce.  I doubled the gravy recipe as per suggestions but not the lemon juice.  Even at half the required amount the lemon flavor was too strong for my taste.  I ended up thickening the sauce with the seasoned flour...but that didn't help either.  It's a shame because the recipe looked really promising.

This was amazing! I added a few tablespoons of white wine when I made the sauce. I also pounded the chicken breasts with a meat tenderizer. I also doubled the sauce.Very moist with a great flavor. We served it over angel hair pasta with broccoli. YUMMY!!

A lot of lemon.  I have made this before and it was better when I cut out some of that lemon.  Also, I made it once cooking the chicken w/out the sauce, and once with the sauce.  I like it so much better in the sauce.  Thanks!

Rarely can I ace a recipe on the first try, but this was a huge success tonight with tots, teens and adults. As suggested throughout the reviews, I doubled the sauce to serve over pasta and added a little extra water and sugar during simmer so sauce wasn't as sour. Served over angel hair with very easy garlic asparagus from this site! Great recipe - much easier than many others p thanks!

Super easy to make, and I had all the ingredients already in the house. I liked that it was light and different from other chicken dishes.

Very good and tasty. 
I made it lower in fat by not flouring the chicken, just pounding thin and pan frying in Pam. Doubled the sauce part and added 1 tsp of garlic minced and fresh lemon zest. Great with rice and broccoli! A hit with my husband who is on a diet and tired of low fat food.

Good recipe.  Whole family enjoyed this.  I followed the recipe as is except to refrigerate the chicken for 15 minutes before frying.  Would have rated it 5 stars except the flour mixture ended up being soggy after cooking.  Will have to try something different next time to keep that from happening.

Delicious. I followed other reviewers suggestions and pounded chicken, double dipped in breading, added wine to the broth, and added capers for second half of simmer. Will definitely become part of the regular rotation.

As others have said:  Pound the chicken flat; double dip the breading; add wine to the broth (and add more broth--the sauce cooks down so much you'll find yourself scraping the pan to get every last bit); add capers during the second half of the simmer, and I served it on Far East brand Sesame Ginger Rice and it was amazing.  Restaurant quality for sure.

Absolutely deeelicious!  I cut the cutlets in half to be thinner, and used butter Pam instead of real butter to cut the fat.  I just lightly floured the cutlets and added lemon quarters.  Even the teenagers loved it!

The recipe is awesome with some individual add ins. I also used capers, artichoke hearts, and fresh garlic. The breading stays in place with the half hour frig time. I did not get a soggy coating at all. I made sure the breading was good and browned. The sauce is great with rice(I made mine with chicken broth for added flavor). This is a keeper. I have used it several times already!!!

This was absolutely great!  My husband loved it too and he can be a pretty tough critic. The lemon flavor was great! I prepared the dish as others recommended by doubling the sauce ingredients and using chicken broth instead of bouillon.  I forgot to add the white wine (it still turned out good) but will try it the next time I make.  I put in the capers and that added some zing.  Also the next time I make this I will cut down on the butter to brown the chicken.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is DA BOMB! Try it with cod. I did tonight and it was amazing!   Double the paprika & garlic powder and 1/2 the lemon and you're set.
I first saw this recipe 3 weeks ago and already I've made it 4 times.

This is extremely tasty!  Many have noted that the amount of coating should be increased...I had just enough, but my chicken breasts were a little on the small size.  I added some freshly ground pepper to the flour mixture, and, just before putting the chicken in the pan, I sprinkled them with a tiny bit of garlic salt.  Like others, I substituted the bouillon/water with chicken stock and wine.  I stuck to the butter over olive oil...just had to watch it carefully so it didn't get brown, but I think, overall, it really added to the flavor of the sauce.  As someone else here suggested, I removed the chicken from the pan at the last minute and tossed my angel hair pasta in the sauce.  The pasta went in a serving plate topped with the chicken sprinkled with chopped parsley.  I served it all with spinach sauteed in butter and garlic and some fresh rosemary and olive oil bread.  Mighty fine!

Definitely need to double the amount of coating mixture, or you won't have enough. Capers would be good with this. I added fresh, sliced mushrooms & liked their taste better than the chicken. Pounded the chicken thinly and added 1 tbsp lemon juice to the broth. Dissolved a bouillon cube in a cup of water & used some of that since a few people mentioned it was too salty. Good & fairly easy recipe, but the amount of butter is more than I'm used to & left my stomach upset for the rest of the evening, even though I didn't have much.

My wife and I LOVED this dish.  We have this on the menu for when our family is coming to visit.  I added extra lemon while the chicken was cooking, hoping to keep a nice, clear sauce...flavor was great, but I would still like to have a nice, lemon butter sauce for a better presentation.  But a great, wonderful dish!

Excellent recipe. The taste has just the right amount of lemon flavour. It put a smile on my face to hear my children say they really liked it. The only change I made was to double the ingredients for the coating (flour,paprika,garlic powder) as their didn't seem to be enough for the amount of chicken.

Good Piccata.  It had a strong lemon taste and was very moist and tender.  I pounded the chicken breasts to about 1/2 inch thickness and added about 2 tablespoons of white wine to the liquids. Once the simmering was done, there was just enough liquid left behind--wasn't overly watery.  The dish turned out great and was quick to make.  Thanks, Terry, for a delicious recipe!

This chicken has great flavour and is super moist!  Simmering it for 20 minutes in the broth give you just enough time to chop some vegetables, toss a salad or cook the rice.

This was very good.  I made the changes as suggested (dredge in flour first, use butter and olive oil, put in oven and put sauce on before serving) and because  I had half and half that I wanted to use I made it a creamy lemon sauce.  I mixed two tablespoons of cornstarch and half and half together and mixed it into the sauce and added half and half until I liked the flavor and before it was thinned out too much.  It was so delicious the dog ate the leftovers :(

I'm not even sure where to begin. I made this recipe and followed it exactly. The breading came right off. Slid right off the chicken in pieces and into the sauce mixture. . What happened?

I picked this recipe this evening when I couldn't think of anything to cook for dinner.  One of the best recipes I've found for chicken in a long time.  I didn't change it up much.  I added some parsley to the flour mixture and used chicken "stock" instead of bouillon. I think I will try it over angel hair pasta.

Followed the recipe exactly. Next time we'll cut the chicken into thin strips and make it that way. We used chicken breasts and the parts with the coating were delicious, but most of the chicken missed out on the flavoring of the lemon juice, so we're thinking of making the chicken smaller next time so it absorbs more flavor. Overall, it was an okay dish, but it didn't have really strong flavors (which I've come to expect from recipes on this site). The flavors are more subtle in this one, but still good and yummy. I'll be adding this to our list of meals and most likely tweak it a bit in the future!

This was the first time trying this recipee.  Not only was it easy but very delicious.  Great flavor, different than what I usually make and perfect flavor of lemon and chicken.  The whole family ate it up.

Easy and tasty. Can also easily adapt with minor changes: more or less lemon or butter depending on oreference.

I tried the original version which I give four stars, then my own where I doubled the sauce and added a half cup white wine. I liked the wine added even better. I will actually triple the sauce next time to add over angel hair pasta.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used a package of Costco chicken breasts, which is 2 larger breasts. I cut them into thirds and poundes a bit. I had to add a bit more flour mixture to make it work, so I would say 1/3 cup would have been better, and I did not flour thickly, but cutting and pounding probably added more surface area. I wish I had doubled the sauce but I was short on lemon, however I think it still turned out quite good, I just like sauce. I will, be making this recipe again soon and see if I can do a bit better with the breading not falling off in some places, as I am sure that was cooks error.

Although my family enjoyed the sautéed chicken, it was way too lemony for us.  I had read that this was a very lemony dish, so I cut all of the lemon juice in half, and it was still overpowering.

I followed other suggestions of putting the chicken in the oven while making the sauce separately.  Unfortunately, my butter got way too browned, and I ended up with a very lemony, dark brown sludgy mess.

I add a little more paprika and garlic powder, I also make extra sauce and serve it over angel hair! Pounding the chicken first helps with cook time but doesn't have to be done. This is by far my favorite dish!!

I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted lemon zest for the lemon slices. Even my son says I really don't like lemon chicken and loved it. I also use chicken tenders instead of chicken breast.. I will be making this one over and over again.

I was skeptical about this recipe at first because it seemed too simple. But I guess things don't have to be complicated to be good. My boyfriend and I both thought it was really tasty.  I made a mushroom risotto to go with it was definitely a hit.

I made this last night and was a little wary because I have a very picky eight year old whose taste buds seem to rely heavily on how things look. I was thrilled when he took a bite and said this was his new favorite! The only thing I did differently was, double the sauce. I'll definitely make this again!!

Kid friendly, quick weekday dinner served in 45 min., with simple ingredients on hand, a definite keeper in our household!  Followed recipe and added sage to flour mix, used olive oil instead of butter as others suggested. I cut up the chicken breast as I needed to feed four hungry people with fantastic results! Served with sauteed peppers and mushrooms.

I have no doubt that the recipes for this dish comes out tasty, but  it's NOT "Piccata". It's missing the capers  which makes the Piccata. Also the piccata has no eggs, chicken it's drenched in flavored flour. This one it's more like a Chicken Francese.

This was an awesome recipe. The ONLY reason why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because chicken piccata does not need any eggs. The chicken should be covered in seasoned flour. Other than that, this recipe will become a regular in my household.

Outstanding! The lemon flavor was perfect, not too strong, but just right! I did slice the chicken breasts in half to make them thinner, but you don't have to.

This is extremely similar to another recipe called: Famous Chicken Francaise. Not sure which one came first. If you have tried one, you have tried the other. Both are lemony and definitely for lemon lovers.

Very easy and the chicken was VERY moist and tender, although I think I'll be adding some garlic to the recipe to add more flavor.

This is a favorite restaurant pick of mine and this recipe is just delicious!  I used tenderloins, which worked great, and left out the paprika.  I found the bouillon powder to be rather salty, so next time I'd use chicken stock.  I added capers.  With just a little prep ahead of time this is a meal you can have on the table 30 minutes after you arrive home from work.

I absolutely love chicken piccata and have tried many recipes. This recipe is one of the best! When I bread my chicken I also add some Miss Braggs all seasoning and parmesean cheese to the bread mix. The chicken comes out so juicy and bursting with flavor - it almost doesn't need any sides!!

Very good recipe for chicken piccata.  I did make some minor changes as well.  I sauteed the chicken in butter and olive oil.  I also added the traditional capers while the chicken was simmering.  I like this recipe because the chicken cooks in the sauce, which makes the chicken moist.

My family loved this chicken. Instead of pounding it out, I butterflied the chicken breast. I did a flour then egg then flour breading. I also used chicken broth instead of water and bullion cubes. It turned out great!!! My husband (who is super picky) said "you are definitely making this again."

I made this on the spur of the moment tonight when my original planned dish didn't sound good. It was simple...extremely so. I used all the ingredients, but pounded the breasts very thin and cut them into smaller pieces. I didn't return the chicken to the pan as I reduced the sauce and just poured it over the chicken at the end. I also topped itnwith capers, because I think picatta without capers is a sad thing. I served it with angel hair pasta and steamed spinach. Thanks for a simple weeknight meal.

I thought this was fantastic!  I did only use 2 chicken breasts (split in half length-wise), so the flavor was a tad overwhelming, but at the same time it was a beautiful flavor!!!  The hubby wasn't too fond of this but I loved it so i'm giving it 5 stars:)  Oh, I used 2 large cubes of chicken stock instead of the bouillon powder.  thanks for the great recipe Terry!!

This isn't really "paccata" because traditionally you would use chicken scallops, Fresh lemon juice and slices, white wine and always always capers. I found this dish to be more of a just plain Breaded Lemon Chicken. OK but NOT Piccata. Sorry!

These were very good but I changed the recipe not because I ment to but because company dropped in while making and I stopped cooking after frying them up so they turned out the be great chicken tenders.. I usually don't review if I change the recipe but thought if someone out there runs out of time as I did then want to let them know they will still be great..Its a great breading..

Chicken was so juicy and tender.  I used juices left in pan and poured over pasta.  Great dish!

This was pretty good.  I feel like it was missing something.  I served over angel hair pasta and followed the recipe.

I loved this recipe.... overall...but I did like the chicken taken out of the sauce while it thickens.. and I did a couple of other things different.. I did not have any chicken broth... so I used 1/2 of an envelope of chicken gravy mix and still included the lemon juice.  It was delicious.   I also served rice... cooked with lemon water and chives and topped the entire dish with a little lemon zest..  It was really good... my hubby loved it.

So easy and delicious and just the right amount of lemony flavor!  It's a great recipe for last minute dinner ideas, since all the ingredients are easy to find in the pantry.

Made this last night for dinner and MAN O MAN was it delicious, I did pound my chicken breast very thin and doubled the sauce, other that that I followed it to a T and the breading was nice and moist not musshy and stayed on the chicken just fine! I served it over white rice and drizzled the delicious sauce all over, I think next time I will even tripple the sauce to cover all of the rice. YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY

I'm a beginner and this was easy enough for even me.  Used many of the suggested improvements:   Used fresh lemon and zest.  Used 3 Tbl of butter instead of 4 Tbl.  Pounded chicken flat so it would cook more evenly/faster.  Dipped chicken first into a bit of flour, then the egg mixture, then into the flour& seasoning mixture.  Pulled chicken out of pan and placed in oven while I made sauce.  Used a full cup of chicken broth instead of half a cup of water and buillon.  Added italian seasoning to chicken at same time I added chicken for last 10 minutes of sauce simmering.  Served with broccoli on the side.

This was not my favorite recipe. Difficult to get the batter to stick and keep from getting soggy. The sauce was more like a broth, and pretty bland. A little sour tasting. Not a disaster, just not my favorite!

This was pretty good.  I ended up seasoning my breasts with onion salt, garlic powder and white znd black pepper.  I also used smoked paprika in my flour mixture because that is what I had..  I used 6 breast halves and quadrupled the sauce so that there would be enough.  Like other reviewers I had to thicken up with corn starch and a few tablespoons of butter.   I made the sauce separate so that the chicken wouldn't be soggy by the time ut was time to eat.  Will probably make again because this was pretty Simone and my 4 yr old even ate it.

Yummy, after reading the reviews, I doubled the sauce, adding capers and the juice of the capers, along with fresh lemon juice.  I also added about a tsp of red pepper flakes for a little kick.  Served over wheat pasta, perfect.

This is a great recipe.  The only change I made was to thicken the liquid slightly and serve it over bow tie pasta.

Very good but I prefer it served over angle hair so I like to have more of a sauce to go with it.  I like the chicken recipe though.  I deglazed the pan with white wine before adding the bouillon water and I also added capers, more water, and a cornstarch slurry to make more sauce.  It was delicious with these modifications!

As written, the recipe seems a little lacking for flavor.  The 2nd time I made it, I added lemon pepper and seasoned salt to the flour.  Then I quickly sauteed in button/olive oil, as well as sauteed chopped garlic and onions.  I let the chicken then bake another 20 or so minutes while I mixed 1 cup chicken broth and 2/3 cup white wine mixed with the extra lemon juice.  Let that simmer for the 20 minutes the chicken was baking.  Added some wondra to thicken up to a glaze, and then topped the chicken with the glaze once coated.  YUM!

This was good - even though I messed up.  I read the reviews and this is what I did - I'm writing this down so I know what NOT to do next time.  I did the triple dip of flour as suggested...plain flour, then egg/lemon mix and then flour mixture.  Then I fried in half butter half olive oil.  Then I put in oven at 250 to keep warm.  Meanwhile I had pasta water boiling for angel hair - and I used chicken broth - brought to boil and then added lemon juice, capers, and some white wine.  I doubled the sauce as was recommended.  Then I made my mistake - once the chicken was in the oven - I took my simmering sauce and put it in the chicken pan - to get those extra juices.  Then I added the chicken back into the pan - and unfortunately my pasta wasn't done!  So the chicken sat in the simmering sauce for too long - so when I put the pasta on the platter and then put the chicken/sauce mix on top...I realized...where's the sauce?  It was gone!  and I had made a double on the sauce?!  So the pasta was dry - but the chicken was really good and moist since it sucked in all the sauce.  lesson for next time...don't add chicken until i KNOW the pasta is done...and already on the platter.

Love this recipe!  It took me a couple of tries to get it right.  I did make some changes based on other posts.  I did a dry dredge first, then dip, then dredge.  In addition, I cut down the butter to 1/2 and used olive oil.  Finally, I put the chicken in the oven to keep warm and make the sauce separately.  Delicious!

I lightly floured the chicken first with plain flour, then dipped it in the egg mixture, then dipped it in the flour mixture, and it came out great! I will definitely be making this recipe again.  I tried adding cornstarch to the lemon sauce to thicken it and it came out a little too thick, so next time I will prepare the sauce according to the recipe with water only.  Great recipe, thanks!

This was superb! My whole family loved it. I doubled the amount of sauce but not quite as much lemon. (Maybe a TBS less). I used the frozen chicken tenderloins because they are already thin and cut into strips which was perfect. I served with wheat angel hair pasta and fresh green beans.Perfect meal!

I was looking for a chicken entree that would please both the lovers and non-lovers of chicken french so that I could avoid having to make 2 complete and different dinners for my family.  This is perfect.  I left out the lemons to please the non-lovers.  The lovers savored the new twist on the dish.  Very good!

I made this as suggested in other posts with the chicken broth and I even doubled the sauce. I served it over angel hair pasta.It was very bland tasting, in my opinion. I added some garlic powder and freshly ground black pepper, hoping to save the dish, but everyone still refused to eat it. Sorry, looks like my family are the only ones who disliked it.

This is sooo good. I pound the boneless breast very thin, and they cook very quickly. I did thicken the lemon sauce with a little Wondra. Served with rice pilaf and broccoli. BIG HIT !

This is a fabulous recipe. I've made Ina Garten's Chicken Piccata, but it didn't turn out half as well (and we love Ina G. in this house). Make sure you don't over-batter the chicken, otherwise it won't turn out well: over-flouring/double-dipping will make fried chicken, and your sauce will make it soggy. I used the cornstarch to make the sauce thicker. Next time I'll add capers. Jamieson Clem loved it, and the leftovers are awesome over pasta. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is delicious!  I've heard that breading the chicken isn't traditional, but boy is it good!  I thicken the sauce with a little bit of cornstarch.

I made this to recipe and really enjoyed it. It was very simple and the lemony flavor went great with a light pasta. Definitely reccomended for a change in your chicken night!

This was fantastic!!! Just wanted something different to make with chicken breasts but never expected anything this good. Only thing I did (I hate people who change half the recipe and review their version of it) was to sprinkle the finished product with capers. Mmm Mmmmm

very good.  The breading didn't stick very well, but the flavor was there and it was very easy to prepare.

This came out pretty good. I let the flour mixture sit on the chicken in the refrigerator for half an hour before cooking and it worked well. For the sauce, I used cream of chicken soup, fresh lemon jiuce, lemon rind, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Came out nice.

Contrary to most other reviewers, I did not much care for this. It was a lttle tangy for my taste, I have had other Picattas that had a mellower lemon flavor, which I prefer.

this recipe was excellent! i used fresh bass instead of chicken. the key is to get the meat nice and browned before adding the sauce.

This was a great recipe--easy to make, and had a great flavor! We made it as written, and found the breading on the chicken came out a little soggy. Next time around, just for our own preferences, we will probably pan fry the chicken first, then put the sauce over it when serving. But this was still a great recipe, will definitely make again!!

This is a great meal and is a hit every time I cook it. I use the recipe as a base and adjust the amount of each ingredient to my personal taste. Also, after I bread and brown the chicken I don't leave it in the pan. I put them on a cookie sheet and pop them in the oven to stay warm. A few minutes before I'm ready to serve the meal I take all the chicken and put it back in the pan and let them soak. This way you keep most of the breading and don't have soggy chicken, but the breading has time to soak up the juices. Then I serve it over angel hair and pour juice over all of it.

Made this tonight with some chicken medallions. Kids (9&11) and hubby loved it! I was surprised how nice and evenly the chicken cooked. I breaded in flour first, then the egg/lemon juice mixture, and flour again. I heated 3 tbsp olive oil and added 2 tbsp real butter, then cooked the chicken. Nummy! 6 stars!

We loved the flavors of this recipe but dont like the soggy texture. I have made the recipe a few times and have found that it is best when I make the chicken and bake it while the sauce cooks. Just before serving I pour the sauce on the chicken so it stays crispy. All in all a good recipe.

This was really tasty...I added some salt and pepper to the flour mixture to give it more flavor.  Also, I followed others advice and placed the chicken in the oven at 250 degrees while the sauce was cooking.  I served this chicken over linguine with an alfredo sauce, a lemon slice and some garlic bread. Delicious!

I made this following the recipe exactly, and it turned out really good - I would make it again.  I ended up with quite a bit of sauce, so I was wishing I had made some rice or something to pour the extra sauce over.  Nice, lemony flavor.

I splurged and cooked with butter, and was very disappointed.  Only modification was using white wine in place of some of the boullion liquid.

I'm only giving this a three because I made some changes but with those changes it was absolutely delish!!  I used a whole container of chicken stock and about 4 or 5 tbs. of lemon juice, ended up adding a teaspoon of chicken base, two splashes of white wine and two cloves of garlic.  Like someone mentioned before, I pounded out the chicken, dredged it in the flour, egg, flour and browned.  Took it out and made the sauce in the same pan, a large wok.  After the sauce was finished I added sliced zuchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and capers.  I mistakenly served it over angel hair the first time, the sauce will not stick even after it's been thickened with cornstarch.  So the next night I made some mashed potatoes with 1 clove of minced garlic and about a tablespoon of grated parmigano-reggiano.  I served the leftover chicken and zuchini over that and it was heavenly!!

This recipe has become a favorite in our house.  Several changes I've applied:  I pound the chicken breasts flat (for even, quicker cooking), I flour, egg, flour when breading (helps it stick better), double the flour mixture ingredients and add at least 2 c. of chicken broth (crumble just one bouillon cube into it since I'm using chicken broth to start with) for more sauce.  I make this in my big stainless electric skillet so I can control the temp. better (brown the chicken around 300 degrees and simmer in sauce around 175 degrees).  Adding 8 oz. of fresh sliced mushrooms and a small sliced onion to cook with the sauce really adds a lot to this meal too!  Since a "piccata" is supposed to have a "sharp" sauce, I've kept the lemon juice as is; if you use mostly butter when frying (I add a small amount of canola oil to raise the smoke-point of the butter some) the browned-butter taste and the lemon juice flavors compliment one another very well.  We eat this over egg noodles.

Awesome recipe. One of my favorites and the best part is how simple it is. I made it a couple of times for my family and boyfriend and they've been asking for it again. I made it with orzo, mushrooms, and capers. Came out perfect!

Delicious and easy.  I would agree with the suggestions to brown/cook the chicken completely, remove it from the pan and then make the sauce in the same pan.  This should help keep it more crispy.

This was fantastic - my not so picky yet extremely apathetic boyfriend enjoyed it, and asked if I'd make it again (of course with a touch of coaxing). only thing i did different was cut up the chicken pieces (they still came out really juicy) and i substituted chili powder for the paprika. A definite make again.

Dish was good, but I added more garlic and paprika.  Also needs mushrooms and still seems to be missing something.. Decent dish though.

AMAZING.

Even though it's not technically "piccata" due to the egg, it's still unbelievably delicious!

I added capers for more taste.

This recipe is delicious.  I have made it a few times now and every time i get compliments on the recipe...its quick and easy and not a lot of fuss to make.  I usually have to make some extra so my husband can take some to work.  I have tried a few chicken piccata recipes and this one is the best so far.

Very Good recipe for a twist on your old fashioned chicken dinners...it lacked a bit of flavor for me BUT the recipe does leave room to add your own spices, which is great for next time now that I know.  I do love the sauce!

I doubled the sauce, but didn't take out the chicken prior to making the sauce as others suggested. (I thought the chicken would be too dry that way.)  I thought it came out just fine the way the recipe was written, and the chicken was nice and tender.

Only great recipes get 5 stars from me  and this one ranks.  I did add 1/4 cup wine and some capers, doubled sauce, served over rice.  Only problem was the soggy breading. Will just pour sauce over next time.  Overall I thought this was excellent.

I thought this recipe was very tasty.  I took the advice of a lot of the reviewers and dipped the chicken in the flour, then the egg, then the flour.  Also, in the breading mixture I added oregano, salt, pepper, lemon pepper and onion powder.  I also used a lot more flour.  As for the sauce, I added just a dash of red wine, which gave the chicken a very refined taste.  I browned the chicken until it was nearly cooked.  I made the sauce separately and added mushrooms to it.  Then I poured it over the chicken and let it simmer for about 15 minutes until the chicken was fully cooked.  The results were good and the chicken was not soggy.    I served it with maple dill carrots and rice and thought it was delicious.  I'll definitely make this again!  Thanks!

My husband really liked this chicken recipe, although I thought it was just okay.  As recommended, I floured the chicken before putting it in the egg mixture and then floured it again.  I made the sauce, thickened it with a little cornstarch and then poured the sauce over the individual chicken breasts.

Great recipe!  My 6 year old daughter and I made this for lunch with some plain leftover pasta we had.  I did add some capers to the sauce.  Lemon and capers are my favorite.  My daughter loved it minus the capers.  This is definately going to be a regular around my house!!

My family really loved this recipe, but I had to alter it a little bit. I used olive oil along with the butter to cook the chicken. I didn't have enough flour and substituted with some finely crushed saltines. YUM!!  I also added white wine to the sauce along with a cornstarch slurry. The cornstarch is essential in my opinion. Overall, a great recipe.

This recipe was very good.  I made some changes to the recipe based on other reviews.  I dipped the chicken in milk and floured with plain flour, let sit in the fridge for 15 mins.  Then I dipped the chicken in the egg mixture and used the spiced flour mixture next.  I browned as called for in the directions.  Changes I made to the broth were that I added a few tablespoons of white grape juice (I didn't have wine) and about a tablespoon of capers.  I served this dish with egg noodles which I threw in the bottom of the pan where I made the chicken (after removing the chicken) and added a little extra broth and butter. It turned out very well.  We will make it again.

My family (including my husband, who is a very picky eater) loved this recipe. I made the chicken into strips, and double-coated the chicken as recommended by others. When I make it again, I will wait to put the sauce (thickened with Wondra) on until serving the dish. It seemed to make the coating too soft instead of crispy.

This turned out amazing. I didn't have eggs, so I used olive oil and lemon juice before dipping into flour mixture. I added lemon pepper, pepper and seasalt to flour mixture. During simmering I added capers. Served with rice topped with the butter sauce from the pan. Excellent.

This came out amazing.  I did take the other reviewers advice and covered the chicken in flour after I pounded it and before drenching it in the egg mixture.  I then covered it in the flour mixture and let it sit in the fridge for an hour.  I browned it on the stove top and let it finish cooking in the oven on 250.  I added white wine and capers to the sauce.  Delicious!

I made this today for my family, 3 out of four of us liked it alot.  So that means I will make it again.  I refrigerated the coated chicken 30 minutes, and in the last 5 minutes of cooking, I added 1 Tbs drained capers.  Yummy!

My husband said this was better than restaurant quality!  It was delicious! I added an Italian blend of spices to the flour mixture and pounded the chicken breasts thin before coating. I served this with Emeril's Aglio e Olio but next time I will make more sauce to serve over my pasta. This is a keeper!

It was very good.  I chilled the battered chicken for thirty minutes as advised by another review.  The batter stuck very well.  I also added a jar of roasted red peppers as advised by another.  It was so easy too.  I hold out my five stars for the most special, but this was yummy.

This was pretty good.  I fell into the same problem that many other reviewers did with the coating falling off of the chicken when the liquid was added.  I made sure the chicken was pretty much done and all the way browned and it still came off.  Definitely need to double or triple the sauce.  Wasn't quite lemony enough for me.  But it had good flavor.  Maybe I would use half unsalted butter and half salted because all salted was too salty....and I am a huge salt person.  So for me to say that, it was salty.  It was good though.

OH MY GODNESS!  ;)  This was so good that I just had to shout! I had a can of roasted red peppers I added during the simmer stage, and I also used the oil from the peppers rather than just plain water for mixing in the bouillion. This is a prize, and I'll certainly be making it on a regular basis.

I also love this recipe but have to add to it. I add milk to the egg and I add cornstarch to the sauce. I also add mushrooms and capers.

Very tasty and easy. The key is in the sauce. Definitely double the sauce if you expect to serve with pasta and make sure your chicken is in small, thin pieces. A few minor changes: I marinated in 1-2tbsp of lemon juice as meat defrosted from freezer and then discarded and rinsed. I decided to just dredge the chicken in flour and then fry (no egg). Came out nice and light. Removed the chicken to the oven at 250 degrees after cooking through and before adding the chicken stock and the rest of the ingredients (returned to pan after simmering completed though). Added a tsp of  cornstarch and a little white wine to sauce while simmering. Next time I will try to add capers but didn't have any on hand.

Husband said it was one of the best dishes I've made! I liked it and it was quite simple to make. I too refrigerated the coated chicken breast for about 30 mins in the fridge.  Will include in my monthly chicken recipes. Thank you!

Great recipe. I add a couple of teaspoons of Knorr Roasted Chicken Gravy mix to thicken the sauce slightly. Great recipe. I serve it with scorched buttered pasta (topped with Asiago cheese) and asparagus. Thank you for the recipe!

I just made this dish. Super easy and very good. Directions didn't say anything about pounding the breast thin but I did anyway. It did cook a little faster that way. I only gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a little salty but it could be the brand of seasoning I used. I also had to thicken the sauce a little at the end. I will make this again for sure. Thanks!

I didn't like this recipe at all. I actually began adding white wine, lemon juice and garlic powder to the broth while it was cooking because the flavor was so bland.  It helped, but not significantly because the chicken boullion is so potent. Will not make again.

I don't understand why recipes get rated so high when 90% of the people change the recipe to make it 5 stars. The recipe as is, is three stars. WAY TOO SALTY as mentioned. Chicken Broth would be a grate substitute but I don't know how much.

Chicken was really tasty, but 'sauce' completely evaporated in the pan. I refrigerated for about an hour prior to frying & the breading stayed on just fine.

AWESOME! Instantly went on my top ten all time favorite dishes. I did add 1/2 cup white cooking wine and 1/2 cup more water, but just because i like to pour the extra sauce over my side dishes. Delicous.

This is one of my daughter Kaitlyn's favorites.  We all love it but she really goes crazy for it.  I highly recommend this recipe.  I made an entire tray of it when I catered my oldest daughter's sweet sixteen.  Needless to say, our guests were going up for seconds and thirds!

Delicious! My whole family loved it. Followed some of the suggestions and made the following adjustments: added more garlic powder and paprika and added salt to flour mixture. We love mushrooms so added them like in the Chicken Piccata III recipe. Went easy on the lemon and added white wine and fresh garlic. Turned out great! Very moist! Will definately make again.

This was excellent and simple to make. I listened to some of the others and took their suggestions, doubled the sauce and added a tsp of sugar. I also used chicken stock rather than the bouillon since that is what I had. The chicken was a little soggy but very good. My son and husband loved it.

If given the option, I would maybe say 3 1/2 stars, but it wouldn't have felt right rounding up to 4.  It was good, but a little bland.  The lemon was pretty much the only flavor to the chicken.  It might be worth it to tinker with the recipe a bit; I especially liked the suggestion of another reviewer of using white wine and chicken stock.  I think I'll try that next time.

Really enjoyed this chicken!  Very easy to make- started it then fixed the other stuff while it simmered.  My husband never likes white meat chicken, says it's too dry, but changed his mind after eating this.

This makes a delicious chicken breast!  I used chicken broth instead of the boullion/boiling water combo and it turned out great!  I also used a lot of lemon juice but only a hint of it came through.  Definitely not too overpowering.  Excellent!

I totally agree with kelly 1097, this was inedible.  The breading, even after refrigerating it, etc. was soggy, wrinkly.  I followed suggestions of others, as well, and wound up just tossing this in the bin.

Absolutely delicious.  Just the right amount of lemon flavor.  I served it with a noodle side dish but it would be great served over rice.  Good company dish too!

Really easy to prepare and absolutely delicious. Hadn't got any garlic powder so added crushed garlic to the sauce.  Reduced the sauce and put it on the accompanying pasta. Wonderful.

This was really good!  It only took a minute to bread the chicken breasts.  Once they were in the pan, I had time to fix my sides.  This is a perfect recipe for a 30 minute meal!  The chicken breasts were very tender and juicy.  My husband has already requested them again!

Really yummy, moist, flavorful chicken! It's one of my husband's new favorites.  I served the chicken pieces with some of the sauce from the skillet over hot noodles cooked in chicken broth.  Yum-o!  This recipe will definitely become one of our "regulars."

This was the first time making Chicken Piccata.  This recipe was so yummy.  The chicken was so moist and also didnt have a strong lemony taste.  I subsituted chicken broth for the boillion cubes.

This was great! But I needed to make changes. The chicken breasts were so big, I had to slice them in half, thickness-wise. And I could only brown 2 at a time in my frying pan, so after they were browned I put them in a baking dish, added a few sliced mushrooms and poured the sauce over them. They baked about 30 minutes on 350. I served over buttered noodles with grated cheese & a touch of lemon juice. Gosh, it was really good. Thanks.

This recipe is a keeper for sure! I tweaked it. Used only 1 tsp chicken bouillon and substituted chicken broth for the water (next time will just use just the broth/no bouillon) I also doubled the flour and both the paprika and garlic powder, used 2 tsp olive oil instead of butter, doubled the lemon juice (we LOVE lemon)and tossed in a few capers. Next time I'll add some mushrooms. 
It was awesome over brown rice with mixed veggies.

We're big veal piccata fans, but since no veal was available at the grocery today, we decided to try this recipe with chicken very thinly sliced. I thought it was okay, my husband liked it better than I did.  I did add about 2 tbs. of capers and doubled the sauce. I also added a bit more lemon juice (after doubling for added sauce) and felt it could have used even more for my liking I took the advice of other reviewers and made the sauce separate from the chicken, so we had no problem with the coating coming off.  I'll probably try this again and add a bit of white wine to the sauce.

We would give this many more stars than 5 if we could!  We had never had picatta before and had no idea what we were in for.  Turned out to be just FABULOUS!  We did take the suggestions of others and doubled the sauce, we added 1/4 cup of capers and a small can of mushrooms.  We served it on top of noodles with steamed broccoli on the side.  EXCELLENT!!!

Very Good!  Used 1 cup boiling water with 1 chicken bouillion cube, added 1/2 cup Sauvignon Blanc, poured over chicken.  With 10 minutes left for simmering, I added fresh sliced mushrooms and 1 4 oz jar of capers.  Excellent lemon flavor -- moist, juicy chicken.  Very Good reheated, too.

This recipe is tasty, but I tend to have a problem getting the chicken to fully cook in the frying pan.  You should probably pound out the chicken before attempting!

I read the other reviews and decided to take out the chicken while I sauteed some onions and mushrooms, then added the chicken and simmered on each side for 5 minutes. The breading was STILL soggy and I can't even imagine it if I would have cooked it for 20 mins! It wasn't so bad and my boyfriend said it tasted like the one from the caterer.

It was alright, i've had much better. **Update. I changed it a little, and it was great!. Dipped chix in flour, then egg mixture, then the flour mixture. Cooked in olive oil/butter. Once both sides were browned, I took out of pan & put in the oven at 250 for approx 15. For the sauce DOUBLE IF NOT TRIPLE IT! I used premade chix broth, approx 1 cup (wish i used more) added approx 2 tsp cornstarch and about 1/3cup sherry (I was out of white wine). I also added mushrooms, capers, and a little minced garlic and let it simmer while the pasta (egg noodles) cooked. YUM!

Delicious!! Chicken came out moist and flavorful.  Be careful when browning meat, breading falls off, use lots of butter.  Served over spiral pasta that was tossed in olive oil and garlic salt. mmmmmm!!! it's a keeper!

Yum! I also double dredged the chicken breasts and added white wine and mushrooms to the sauce.  I also zested some of the lemon in both the egg mixture and the water mixture.  I served with angel hair pasta (mixed with olive oil, spices, broccoli and parmesan) and it was very good! Will definitely make again.

I made this 2 nights ago for my girlfriend and I. She LOVED it!!! I cooked along with some Garlic Linguine and the meal was both delicious and satisfying. I will definitely make this one again.

Good Stuff. I added capers and italian seasoning for flavor and some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Served with pasta.

I read somewhere that if you dip the pat dried chicken onto flour before dipping it in egg mixture and other coating, it will stick well. I tried it as it works! didn't refigerate the chicken at all after coating. I followed others recommendation to use extra chicken broth, white wine and lemon juice. the lemon juice serves as a thickening agent and could over thicken your sauce if you add too much. I also cut the chicken breast into thin strips. it means a lot more work, but it's easily to keep the leftover since hubby and I can't finish it all.another suggestion, don't toss all the chicken into the sauce if you knew you can't finish it in one meal. keep it in fridge and prepare new sauce when you are ready to eat the leftover. ( This makes sense if you cut the breast into thin strips). I omitted mushroom and antichokes.

This was okay.  Not as much flavor as I like, but I will try it again and add some of the extra people mentioned.  On its own though not a ton of flavor.

This was okay, I would make it again, but it didn't blow me away. The breading did get mushy...I think from cooking in the liquid...perhaps just fry it with out the liqiud and make the liquid seperate and use as gravy.

I DIDN'T LIKE THIS WHEN I FIRST MADE IT, BUT IT WAS MUCH BETTER WHEN I DOCTORED UP THE LEFTOVERS.  I SCRAPED THE BREADING OFF THE CHICKEN, CUT IT IN INTO SMALL CHUNKS, SEASONED IT WITH LEMON PEPPER AND GARLIC SALT, AND SAUTEED IT AGAIN IN BUTTER AND OLIVE OIL WITH CHOPPED ONION, CHOPPED RED BELL PEPPER, AND SLICED MUSHROOMS.  WHEN I MADE THE SAUCE THE FIRST TIME, I MIXED A CAN OF ITALIAN SEASONED CHICKEN BROTH WITH 3 TBSP OF LEMON JUICE, 1/2 CUP OF WHITE WINE, MINCED GARLIC AND CAPERS. I ADDED ARTICHOKE HEARTS THE LAST TEN MINUTES. THIS WAS GREAT OVER BOWTIE PASTA.  MUCH BETTER THE SECOND TIME.

This was a great recipe, however quite high in calories when I figured the ingredients (500/serving).  I weighed my chicken breasts and they averaged 7.5 oz. each.  I also used olive oil instead of the butter.  I will make this recipe again, but maybe for special occasions.

Very good. I refridgerated my breaded chicken breasts about 30 minutes prior to cooking. I also doubled the sauce and added about a cup of fresh mushrooms, sliced. I served this with garlic bread, sauteed spinach, and rotini pasta tossed in the sauce/mushrooms. Yum!

VERY lemony.  Next time I will most definitely half the lemon content and refrigerate the floured chicken so it sticks better during cooking.  This recipe has potential :)

Pretty good!  Not too much lemon flavor as some had stated.  I added capers and artichoke hearts.  Next time I think I'll pound the chicken flat and use a little more of the flour mixture - I think that will improve the flavor a little.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Excellent recipe and it's even better with some tweaking.  Great add-ins are a T. of capers, artichoke hearts, and mushrooms.  I sometimes use half chicken broth and half white wine for a little extra zing.  I've also made this recipe using mild fish like grouper or tilapia; just simmer the fish for 10 minutes and don't turn it.  The leftover sauce is great over angel hair pasta.  It's so easy and it tastes like something you'd get in an upscale restaurant.

This turns out great with the following suggestsions.. Use real garlic instead of powder; Use chicken stock instead of boullion powder and use a dry white wine instead of water.  I also throw in capers and double the sauce.  I always "scallopine" the chicken as well, pounding it thin and then cutting into smaller pieces.

PERFECT!  I doubled the sauce, and added bread crumbs to the flour mixture.  I used olive oil instead of butter, added capers, lemon slices, and mushrooms while it simmered, served it with pasta and bread, just like our favorite Italian restaurant!  So good!

Hubby asked me to make this last night and it came out great! I used pre-cut chicken cutlets. I also doubled the flour mixture seeing as many said there wasn't enough. The "breading" did fall off a bit while cooking so next time I too will refrigerate first. I added sliced baby portobello mushrooms, about 2tsp of capers and a little extra garlic powder. Also, used just about 1 cup of water and only 1tsp of the bouillon (which was actually an accident) and it was perfect! Not too salty at all! Only regret is that there wasn't more! Hubby LOVED it and asked me to make them again this week! :) *Add a little olive oil to your butter to prevent burning.

This is a keeper! I followed the advice of previous postings and pounded the chicken into cutlets. I also added fresh mushrooms & capers during the last 20 minutes of cooking...it turned out restaurant quality. I'll definitely make this again and again!

It was good.  I wish that I had pounded out my chicken flat prior to cooking, because my chicken got dry while cooking through.  Also, my lemon sauce ended up way too thick for my taste, maybe I overcooked that as well.  Not like chicken piccata that I have had in the past, but it was quick and easy and tasted good.

This recipe is delicious -- the chicken comes out just right, with the perfect amount of lemom flavor.  I pounded the chicken down flat prior to coating, and I added a small can of drained mushrooms when simmering in the boullion, which came out very good!

Tasted like restaurant piccata! I used half the butter, and added fresh mushrooms  and a half cup of white wine, and it was very good. Next time I might aslo add capers, and artichoke hearts.

YUMMY!!! I Loved the idea of the lemon in with the egg - toning down the tartness.  I simmered boneless breasts and did add some white wine and let it slowly simmer until it had a nice glaze - the whole family loved the flavor and tenderness.   Will make again!!

This recipe was a hit with my husband.  The leftovers for the next day were even good.  I made bow tie pasta with a white cream sauce and green beans to compliment this dish.

I thought this turned out very good. I thought the chicken was a little tuff but I think I over cooked it to start. I also had 6 pieces of chicken and I don't think I had enough of the chicken broth in the pan. This didn't stick to the pan for me. I used a cast iron skillet so maybe that helped.I also added a little wine to this because I have always heard of wine in this recipe. I will be making this again. It was very simple and I like that part of the recipe the most!

Ditto, to previous cooks comments.  Do not leave chicken in pan while preparing the sauce.  Remove chicken from pan and place in a warm oven, while you are cooking the sauce.  Add chicken back into the pan for a few minutes once your sauce in thickened with cornstarch.

I followed the adaptations of a few reviewers summed up by Cristy Basso Short (pounding chicken, lightly coating in flour, warming chicken while preparing sauce, and doubling the sauce.)  I used King Arthur Measure for Measure Gluten Free Flour.  Came out delicious and will be on my rotation!

Delish. For some unknown reason I didn’t read the reviews first so I had to learn my own mistakes. Firstly: definitely triple the flour mixture. I had to add more midway through and it was a pain because my hands were all goopy. Second: deglaze with a white wine instead of water- this just makes more flavor sense. Third: what about the capers?!?!  You can’t have chicken piccata without capers!

I made this to try something  different with  the chicken breasts I had.  This came out fantastic!  I will make this again for sure.  I did add a few slices of lemon in the pan with the chicken as it was cooking.  I think it was just a little too much lemon so I won't try that again.  I served this with white rice and we used the juice in the pan on the rice.  It was delicious!

Followed recipe exactly. 1st, there wasn't enough flour mixture to coat 4 breasts (had to make more). 2nd, breading turned soggy after adding liquid. 3rd, other than lemon totally flavorless. I cannot understand all the positive reviews sorry.

I cheated and bought chicken cutlets because I have zero space to work in. 
A quick dip, dredge, then browned the cutlets nicely. Added the broth with remaining lemon juice, allowed to reduce a bit. 
Versatile, healthy, popular with my family. This recipe is requested more than pizza!

Very tasty! I did makes a few tweaks based on the reviews for this recipe. I used two chicken breast and cut them in half instead of flattening them. I also double dipped the chicken in the flour mix as well (dipped in flour, dipped in egg, dipped in flour again). When the chicken was done cooking I put them in a oven set at 250 to keep them warm while I made the sauce and noodles to go with this meal. For the sauce I used 1/2 cup of chicken broth instead of using the powder. I also added half a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I put the chicken in the pan with the sauce right before serving so nothing was soggy by the time the food made it to the plate. Husband loved it! Will be making it again

Dipped chicken in flour, then egg, then the flour mixture, looked good until I added the sauce, the breading started falling off.  Going to make again and serve the sauce over pasta with chicken on top.

Honestly, the sauce had the most amazing flavor!  I made it exactly as written.  If I were to make again, and I’m sure I will, I will season the chicken before doing the egg wash and flour.  When eating just the chicken, it was a little bland.

This was good, but I needed way more flour to cover my chicken. It's a minor gripe, but by the time I realized it, my hands were all covered in chicken juice, egg, and flour, and I already had two in the pan, so it was a little bit of a pain. to drop everything, wash my hands, get the flour, etc. while two chicken breasts were already overbrowning. Just a forewarning, make extra seasoned flour before you start.

I've made a few changes that I think take this dish from great to phenomenal.  

For the chicken itself: 

Replace chicken bouillon powder with equal measurements chicken base

Ditch the egg mixture, and simply season the raw chicken breast with S&P, Garlic Powder & Paprika, then coat the entire thing in flour and pan sear in vegetable oil 

This is the authentic way to make it, and the way that most (if not all) restaurants worth anything will do it.

For the sauce:

Add a 1/4 white onion, a 1/4 Cup of Capers (drained) and 2 T minced garlic to the butter and saute until soft.  Then deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup white wine (instead of water).  Once the wine reduces a little, add the lemon juice and chicken base (make sure to use actual chicken base, not bouillon powder for the best flavor)

Finally serve the chicken this over Capellini and steamed Asparagus, pouring the sauce over everything. 

Will definitely make again.

This was fairly easy to make and it had great flavor.  I would ay that for four large breasts you will probably have to increase the ingredients to coat them properly.

So good ... I’ve made this version twice now, along with another version similar once. I serve this over rice. I made extra sauce so I’d have it for the leftovers. I really liked it. Lemon isn’t overwhelming, but enough you taste it, but not all you taste. I don’t add salt because I use better than bouillon verse powdered flavored chicken. It had enough salt. This is a simple, delicious meal

Holy moly!  This is the best chicken piccata recipe I've ever made!  Me and my boyfriend were instantly wow'd as soon as we tasted it.  Only wish I'd made more!!  I did add some starch to the sauce to thicken it up a bit.

The only thing I'm changing the next time I make it is I'm going to make more sauce.  There was not enough.

This came out quite well. I was unprepared for such a potent lemon flavor but, it was an immediate hit. We served it with sticky rice and cheesy broccoli and the kids loved it.

Yummy, this is a very good dish and easy to make. I used a 1/2 cup of chicken broth instead, and it came out tender and juicy and lemony.

So good and pretty easy. I added capers while it was simmering and served it with some spaghetti; to make extra sauce I added some chicken broth in the skillet.

The only change I made was to cut the recipe in half since it's just my husband and me.  It was delicious!  This will be one of my regulars.  I can't believe it's so low cal and low carbs.

I shouldn't be rating this because i made it with a lot of changes but overall loved the dish.

Changes: Added bread crumbs , garam masala & lemon pepper  in the flour mixture.
Things I would further change: I used the  quantity suggested for half the amount of chicken breasts. I would use double the fluids (water and lemon juice) because almost all liquid was gone and while it was good to eat on its own, I would have preferred more with the quinoa we ate on the side. Make it three times for 4 chicken breasts. You can add some white wine for the same.

I further garnished with a little lemon zest and chopped cilantro.

With all of the positive feedback I had to try this recipe. Well as much as my family and I are a meat and gravy family, this was a BIG miss with all of us. I followed the recipe to the T and had to triple check the directions when taste testing the gravy before serving....it was simply slow simmered lemon juice. This recipe for us was a waste of time and ingredients. Sorry but we won't make this again.

Absolutely delicious! My husband and I said it tasted like adult KFC in the best way. I used better than chicken bullion and oat flour for a gluten free option.  My only complaint was that the nice crispy outside completely melted once we cooked it in the lemon mixture and had to finish it off in the broiler to crisp up. TIP: BRINE YOUR CHICKEN! Seriously even 15 minutes will make it more tender and juicy than you can imagine!

We all love this dish, I did make a few modifications, I only use 1 tblsp of lemon in the water with the bouillon because we do not like it too lemony, I double the sauce so I use a full stick of butter, 1 full cup of boiling water and a large bouillon.  Other than that we love the way it tastes!

Loved this and so easy. I used grilled not breaded / fried. To me the trick is to get just the right amount of lemon.

This was very good, though I've never used an egg dip for Chicken Piccata. I prefer Lemon Chicken Piccata on this site. Thanks Terry, I enjoyed making your recipe.

It's more of a chicken and gravy rather than piccata. I followed the recipe according to "most helpful review" and I did not care for it. I'll stick to the traditional capers and lemon butter with white wine sauce next time.

We liked it except for the fact the chicken lost it's nice crispy coating once it sat in the sauce. I will make this again but cook the chicken through, keeping it warm while the sauce is cooking and then just serving the sauce as a side.

This was REALLY good!  Next time season the flour and double dip. Stick in fridge for 30 minutes to retain coating.  Double sauce and add capers, maybe lemon zest.  Serve over angel hair pasta.  Can either fry chicken and make sauce separate for crispy chicken, or follow recipe.  Good both ways.  Important thing is to have plenty of sauce.  Squeeze additional lemon juice on meat before serving.  Outstanding

My family really enjoyed this recipe! So quick and easy to make on a busy week night. The only change that I made was due to my gluten and dairy intolerance I used gluten free flour and dairy free butter. I also added a little more chicken bouillon and some salt and pepper. Paired it with fresh green beans with garlic and long grain wild rice for a perfect and quick dinner!

I followed a few suggestions from other posts. I pounded the chicken flat, dredged the chicken in egg and flour then egg/lemon and flour mixture.  I doubled the sauce and added 1 cup of white cooking wine. Cooked chicken, then put on pan to keep warm in oven. Added 1/3 of  capers and 2 tsp of minced garlic to sauce. Put sauce in pan and added chicken. Sarved with pasta. Soo yummy!

My family really liked this recipe.  A few changes that I made were to add more lemon to the egg mixture and not simmer the chicken in the broth/lemon juice at the end as we wanted a crispy coating.   The chicken was moist, juicy, crispy, savory and tangy.  Very delicious.

This recipe is a keeper. I however followed others suggestions such as doubling the flour, used one less chicken bouillon, and set them to rest for a bit in the fridge. I sliced two chicken breasts to make four thin slices and pretty much followed the procedure to a T. I used one chicken bouillon added the hot water and to give it a bit of extra taste added 1/2 cup of low sodium broth. To add a bit of color I sprinkled a bit of dry parsley before I put it to simmer. The chicken came out juicy and soft. Served it over thin spaghetti and it was perfect. I had only one lemon so I sprinkled a bit of lemon pepper I had to make up for the missing lemon  juice. This was AMAZING will definitely make it again no doubts!

This was really good. I added a little extra lemon juice to the eggs and to the broth, which I used in lieu of bullion. Added capers at the end and voila! A perfect dinner served with rice and green beans. The only problem I had was the crust pulled away from the meal during the simmering, not a big deal.

So I made mine with turkey breast rather than chicken, I was kinda skeptical about how it would turn out because turkey can over cook so quickly. But it turned out to be the juiciest turkey I have ever eaten in my life. I think the breading helped seal in the moisture.

The sauce on the other hand I wasn't super crazy about, I cooked my sauce separately and waited until serving to pour over the meat just so it wouldn't get soggy. I followed some other reviews advice and added a bit of white wine, garlic, sugar, and cornstarch slurry, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really to my taste. I got too much of the wine flavour and not enough of the lemon.

Will definitely be using the breading recipe again, but maybe with a different sauce next time.

loved it! A few changes I made was to tenderize the chicken and dip in the flour first, then egg, then flour again. I also made ziti noodles to go with it and boiled them in water with 2 boillion cubes to give them a chicken flavor.  I used the left over grease to make a flour n milk gravy to put over the noodles. My mom loved it said thegravytasted like my great grandmas chicken gravy! :-) Great compliment!

This recipe was outstanding. I doubled the sauce based on other reviews and added capers. I also added a little cornstarch to thicken. My only issue was, the chicken stuck to the pan and tore off the yummy coating. Anyone have a remedy for this? Im going to try to spray the pan next time before the butter. I made this with mashed potatoes and broiled asparagus. Next time I'm going to put over linguini. Absoloutely delicious!

Just tried this recipe. I used olive oil and butter to brown the chicken. I used low sodium chicken broth instead of bouillon.   I also floured the chicken, dipped in egg, then coated with the flour/paprika mixture.  I browned the chicken, took it out, covered it, and made the sauce. I doubled the amount after seeing that the 1/2 cup of low sodium chicken broth was not much.(also added mushrooms)
 I used a little wine, and also thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  I then returned the chicken to cook about 10 minutes.  The chicken did not get soggy. It was very good.  A lot of lemon flavor.  My picky 25 year old son actually told me it was very good.  And believe me, he doesn't dole out compliments easily.

Great! I was a bit worried about the sauce because when I taste tested it seemed way too lemony and/or salty. When served on the chicken however, the blend was really tasty. The family loved, even my picky 6 year old nephew.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe at all. The flavor was pretty bland, even adding more seasoning and it just overall did not have the zing it needed and was a little soggy. Will look for another recipe.

I liked this, but the 4 1/2 stars is really not for this recipe as written.  I tried to implement changes as suggested by reviews...added wine, capers, doubled sauce.  I would love to see one recipe with all the additions.

this was SO delicious.. i don't care if it's a true "piccata" or not.. what matters is the taste.. that being said.. always using what i have on hand and reading the reviews i made some adjustments.. parmesan cheese for the flour (and a little more than 1/4 c), 3 T margarine, 1 tsp chicken bouillon, and bottled lemon juice for fresh.. poured the sauce over rice.. super flavorful.. ty for the recipe

It was OK, but not too flavorful.  I added capers and that gave it a punch. 

The chicken was moist and well cooked, but we could barely taste the lemon and certainly could not taste the other spices.  I would double the lemon juice and spices if I made again.

Not a bad rescipe.  I used 2 TBSP of lemon juice versus 3 TBSP just because I'm not a fan of a super lemony sauce.  I added 1 TBSP of capers and doubled the recipe by omitting the boullion powder and water and opting for a good chicken stock.  I also added 1/4 C of white wine.  My breading did not stick.  I should have put it in the refrigerator for half an hour or not submerged the chicken in the sauce.

Can't say I was impressed by this. I did coat the chicken and let it sit in the fridge for about an hour to help it stick, but the flavor really wasn't anything amazing to me. I have never had chicken piccata, so maybe I was just expecting more. My husband thought it was so-so as well.

Fantastic!!  The whole family loves it!  All I changed was to TRIPPLE the liquid in #4.  We all love lots of gravy!  and I thicken the sauce with a little corn starch at the end.

Excellent as is. Most of the changes people are making is taking the original spices and flour coating and doubling them.  That's all according to everyone's different taste buds. I would try it with the original the first time. These people who change things without trying the original first are not being fair to the submitter.

I have been using this recipe since 2008 and just love it. It is easy and pure. Not a lot of ingredients as it should be. The lemon comes through very well. I follow the recipe as written except I do add capers. Just want to say thanks to Terry C after so long.

My whole family loved this recipe. I wasn't sure if it was seasoned enough, but one taste disabused me of that notion. This will become a staple chicken recipe at our house because I always have all the ingredients.

Removed chicken from pan to warm in oven while making sauce & replaced in sautee pan for last 2-3 minutes.  Also added an extra tablespoon or two of lemon juice to the sauce.  Served with quinoa & sauteed spinach.

This chicken was so delicious!! I will be making it again real soon!!

 I always use tenderloins when recipes call for breasts because I find the chicken to coating ratio to be better and the chicken cooks faster. This was so moist due to the simmering, next time I will make it with (small) breasts because I think it will hold up and not get dry. I loved the lemon flavor. I added lemon zest to the egg mixture and will use more juice in the broth next time. Also, I added more garlic powder and paprika than called for. I also added garlic powder to the broth. This recipe doesn't take much time at all (especially because I used the tenderloins), but maybe I'll try to see how using canned/boxed chicken broth will turn out to save a couple minutes.

One last recommendation, while I usually love lots of buttery richness in dishes that call for it, I found that 1/4C butter was a bit much. I will maybe use a butter substitute ('I Can't Believe It's Not Butter'), mix regular butter and the substitute, or just use less regular butter next time.

This was very good as written.  The only improvements would be to add the lemon zest to the sauce and thicken it at the end of cooking.  Will definitely make again with these modifications.  Thanks for the recipe!

I gave this recipe 4/5 stars for being an excellent weeknight recipe but not something i'd serve at a party. I added capers and some cooking white wine. I also tried to thicken sauce a bit with cornstarch. I breaded chicken a few hours befor cooking and had to double the flour  garlic powder and paprika mixture to cover chicken sufficiently. I also used smoked paprika rather than reg paprika. After browning chicken  in evoo (did not use butter) and making  sauce I combined both topped with lemons slices and capers and baked for 25-30 min on 375 just until cooked through. I served with fried (in cooking spray) plantains with a homemade cajun dipping sauce for a fun twist. yum!

Yummy.  We added capers.  Takes high heat to brown the chicken enough that it doesn't get soggy when the liquids are added.  I had to add additional water to the broth while the chicken cooked as it all boiled out.

I thought this was delicious but I did make a few changes.  I cut the butter and flour in half, added a couple of shakes of chile powder, used much more lemon juice, and pounded the breasts thin.  Delicious recipe, and very easy.

Tasty and easy.  I filleted the breasts then pounded them to about 1/4" thick.  I cooked them in olive oil and butter.  I followed some other suggestions and made the sauce separately then drizzled it over the cooked chicken.  I added cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit.  I also added a few capers, which I love.  Served with rice and broccoli.

This was so awesome, I made it twice this week. I like that it is made with everything that I have in my kitchen on a regular basis. I did pound the chicken and double dipped it in egg and flour, like other reviewers and made the sauce after the chicken was completed, and poured it over the pieces when I was ready to serve. Thank you for the fabulous recipe.

yum! I made it for a VERY LARGE crowd so I ended up baking it after breading each piece of chicken and then just ouring the broth into a pan and it turned out very moist. Never made Piccata before - good stuff!

The flavor of this dish was okay (a little too buttery), but the texture was nothing to get excited for. It was probably my own fault, but I thought it was a little soggy on the outside. I should have turned the heat up more to brown them more I guess? I probably won't be making it again.

delicious - I added cashews for some crunchy texture, a few diced red peppers for some color, and laid a thin slice of lemon on top as a garnish. Couldn't have been better!

I enjoyed this recipe, however when I doubled the sauce I should not have doubled the lemon as it was too lemony for my family.  I will try it again with a little less lemon next time.  Thank you.

This was superb! I doubled the yummy sauce.  I wanted my chicken to stay a little crisp so I lightly fried it then put it in a warm oven until the sauce was ready. We ate this over linguini with broccoli and garlic bread.

Absolutely wonderful recipe! What I did different was cook the chicken in butter, put it on a baking sheet and kept it warm in the oven while making the sauce separately. Also, I thickened the lemon sauce toward the end with cornstarch and added capers.

This was excellent. My husband is very picky and I was worried the lemon would be too much for him but he loved it! He requested that I make this at least once a week. My 17 month old even liked it! I followed the recipe exact. Next time I double the sauce by adding some white wine so I can toss some noodles in it as a side.

YES, the best.  If you do not like lemon, do not make.  This is the BEST recipe if you are looking for a perectly easy Piccata.  As suggested many times, triple the liquid.  I used half wine, half chicken broth added to the butter.  I made the chicken as directed, placed it in the oven to keep warm at 210.  Added cornstarch to thicken after letting it reduce.  Dumped in linguine to the sauce and served the crisp chicken on top.  Yes, I added capers to the sauce.  Best piccata I have ever enjoyed and got raves from my husband who is the fussiest eater I have ever known.  Used a total of 1-1/2 cups of wine and chicken broth.

I found the lemon flavor to be pretty strong and the chicken was soggy even after adding it back to the sauce when it was finished.  I can only imaging how it would be if it was in the sauce the whole time.

I followed this recipe exactly as written. I ran into the same problem that some other reviewers had. After dipping the chicken in the flour mixture the flour mixture became a soggy mess. I remade the flour mixture and placed it in a ziplock bag and then added the chicken and shook the bag to coat the chicken. That worked. The rest of the recipe worked out and the end resulted was really good. BF really like it too.

This recipe was delicious, but I did change some things based on the reviews. Definitely quadruple the sauce if you like sauce. I tripled it and still could have used more. I used fresh garlic instead of powdered. I did the regular flour dip, egg dip and then the seasoned egg dip. I browned the chicken in mostly olive oil and just a little bit of butter. I used chicken broth instead of bouillon, added the capers and white wine. After browning the chicken I did put it in the oven on 250 and made the sauce separately. I served over whole wheat pasta. My boyfriend really liked it, and he is very critical.

This is good, although I doubled the amount of garlic powder mixed with the flour.  I also skipped dredging in the egg as I like a thinner coating of flour on the chicken.  Doubled the sauce too.

Very good, thank you! It was however; a little tart for my taste so i did add some water towards the end.  Next time (and there will def. be a next time) i will cut down on the lemon juice just a bit. I bought the thin sliced b/s chicken breasts and they worked wonderfully.  Thanks again for the recipe

Awesome.  I did double the sauce and add capers, put the chicken, thinned out, into the oven to keep warm while the sauce cooked.  Then put the sauce on top at the table, served with pasta.  Also if you add cornstarch, just add a LITTLE, I used to much and made paste :)

I made sure to pound the chicken very thin and then followed everything as stated.  The sauce is very good, just need to make more next time.  Great taste and presentation.

i didnt really know what to expect when making this, but it was wonderful.  the butter got nice and browned, the chicken was so moist, and i added a few spaghetti noodles to soak up that awesome butter sauce.  i'll be making this for christmas, as we are having an italian style meal.  thank you!

Made this last night - just as described except I used boneless, skinless thighs instead of breast. My son and I both loved it, the lemon was perfectly subtle. Served with a red wine risotto and boiled baby carrots. Wine suggestion: Australian or German Reisling

Use 2 Chicken Breasts. Triple Dippings. Double Dip With Flour. More Butter Will Be Needed Along With Equal Parts Olive Oil. As You Cook Chicken Keep Warm In Oven. Double Sauce Except Bouillon(Used 1). Simmer 1 Minute.

It wasn't a wow meal but no one complained and it tasted good.  The bread crumbs fell off a bit but helped to thicken the sauce.  I used chicken broth instead of bullion.

This is a great and simple meal that made my whole family happy, even my daughter who is something of a finnicky eater cleaned her plate.  I served it with boiled red potatoes and steamed brocoli

I don't know what I did wrong, but all of the breading came off the chicken when I used my tongs to bring it from the pan to the plate.  My husband said the flavor was "weird."  He was outvoted by children who said it was the "best chicken ever."

Chicken was perfect I did do the "double dip" like the others suggested.  I had some trouble with the sauce, it was thin but still tasty.

this was very good! I did make some small changes---added more seasoning to the flour, pounded the chicken, browned the chicken in olive oil instead of butter for 2o mins, added a couple cloves chopped garlic and then worked on the sauce. I deglazed the pan with a a splash of dry white wine, added chicken broth, lemon juice and let it reduce a few minutes and then added the chicken breasts back to the pan to thicken the sauce up. Finished with some fresh herbs and lemon slices for color and flavor. I served with egg noodles and some steamed green beans. My picky kids ate it all up and so did my husband. very fast and tasty!

Ok so I followed other reviewers' recommendations for this one. I did marinate the chicken over night in dried seasoning,garlic powder and the juice of one large lemon. I then pounded the chicken breasts.To fry, I dipped in the flour mixture(to which I also added basil),then in the egg one then back to the flour one. This worked out well until the end when the breading started to fall off when I was transferring to a dish. So I made the decision to then make the sauce and not bother to put the chicken actually in it.So while the chicken went into the oven at 240 to keep warm,I used a can of chicken broth and the juice of one whole lemon. The sauce was still bland and VERY lemony so I added black pepper,minced garlic and some dried Italian seasoning, let it boil down. I did add some corn starch to thicken the sauce then just poured the sauce over the warm chicken.  I liked the flavour of the chicken a LOT. The sauce was just so-so. This one definitely won't go into regular rotation though.

Wonderful recipe.I added garlic powder and pepper and paprika to the flour.  I added lots of fresh chopped garlic to the butter and olive oil when sauteeing the chicken.  I added fresh asparagus to the broth when cooking also capers.

This is the first chicken piccata recipe I've tried and it was great! I've made it twice and my family prefers the bottled lemon juice to real lemon and zest. Weird, huh!? The second time we didn't even bother with the sauce it was good chicken on its own. Served with pasta with butter and lemon pepper.

Thisw was an easier recipe than I expected.  The lemon flavor was great, not lost in the breading.  This recipe has replaced my grand-daughter's favorite Cluntry Fried steak.

This chicken looks really good on a plate and also tastes wonderful. I oversalted the first time, though the recipe did not call for salt, which was why I added a little bit into the egg mixture, which almost ruined my dish the first time. To save it, I added water to the pan covering the chicken and let it come to a boil and then I dumped out the liquids, and repeated that three times until I got the flavor I liked. *Do NOT add salt to this dish, it is not needed.

This was delicious!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and put the chicken in a warm oven while I made the sauce in the pan . . . I added the chicken back to the pan just for a couple minutes before serving, so it doesn't get soggy.

This was a really easy/quick recipe.  The flavor was good, but not great.  I did double the sauce and used some dry white wine to liven it up.  Overall, this is a good recipe to keep, but not a mouth-watering recipe

I've only tried making this and Barefoot Contessa's Chicken Piccata. This was a bit more tame with the flavors compared to the Barefoot Contessa's overpowering chicken piccata taste (recipe called for 1/3 cup lemon juice). This was still very tasty. I'll continue with my quest for the best chicken piccata recipe for me.

maybe it's just me but i thought the chicken was a bit bland for my taste. i think i should have seasoned the meat more before dipping it into the egg mixture. other than that it was very tender and the flour browned coating was delicious.

I did not enjoy the flavor of this recipe at all. The chicken was good, but the sauce left a lot to be desired. I kept adding things to try to increase the flavor and ended up with something more edible, but not even close to the original recipe. I won't be making this again.

Very good, though my fiancee preferred the chicken before it underwent the final sauce simmer.

I picked up some chicken breasts for $.77 lb and figured I would take advantage of a full lemon tree in the yard.  Good choice too.   This was very easy to whip up and delicious served with vermicelli.   Next time I will either pound the chicken or else slice into portions that are about two bites. After cooking this recipe I would probably opt to use chicken broth instead of bouillon.  I omitted the capers simply because I'm just not partial to their flavor.  I did triple the broth and added sliced garlic (next time just one clove, crushed) and it was great with the pasta. I will be making this dish again as well as sharing the recipe some friend. Yum.

This is simply a terrific recipe.  I liked that it didn't have 10,000 ingredients, and I had everything that was needed on hand.  I've made this 3 times in the past 2 weeks.

I have made this for my boyfriend and friends alike.  It's always received rave reviews!  I try to make extra sauce and serve it and the chicken over angel hair pasta with a side of steamed veggies.  A real crowd pleaser!  I do, however, take the suggestion of other reviewers and keep the chicken in a warm oven until it's time to serve instead of cooking it with the sauce.  Great recipe!

This was very good. I took the advice from another review to use the flour, egg, flour process. The coating really did stay on MUCH better. I will try adding lemon pepper seasoning and more garlic to the coating to pump up the flavor next time.

Very tender chicken... turned out great. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of flour... and added very chopped garlic to the butter before browning the chicken... also some salt/pepper to the breading mix. Other than that... same recipe and it was GREAT! Thanks again! -erica b.

My husband told me I outdid myself after the first bite. I made enough for four people, but two portions didn't get eaten right away.  My daughter reheated a portion the next day and said it was "scrumptious".  I love it - the taste and how quick and easy it is to prepare.

I love this recipe precisely because it does not include capers, which I don't really like. I too doubled the sauce, and thought this recipe made a lovely dinner. Great way to help me use up lemons from my tree!

This was great! My kids even liked it....a lot. I did double the gravy (then I had to thicken). I did flour, let rest for a half an hour in fridge, egg wash and re-floured then poured the gravy and cooked the rest of the way. If you like picatta "crispy" finish in the oven and leave the sauce on the side. I love it soggy. The coating stayed on great.Very pretty for you gourmet cooks. I also added extra garlic powder to the gravy..  YUMMY STUFF.

This was an excellent recipe and we loved it.  Based upon some of the other reviewers who recommended dipping the chiken twice, I did that too.  IMO it isn't necessary.  In the past when I've made Chicken Piccata I have only lightly dredged it in flour without the egg mixture beforehand.  I don't think dipping in the egg adds anything.  Next time I'm going to skip that step.  I also added a little cornstarch to the liquid in the pan to make a little thicker sauce - would do that next time also.  All in all a wonderful recipe - a "keeper"!!

This was a great recipe!  I was amazed that it stayed brown and crispy throughout the cooking process.  I used 1T butter and 2T olive oil to improve healthful value.  The sauce came up a little short, though.  I also added capers at the end

I have just made this and it was wonderful, everyone loved it! I followed the advice of several reviewers, pounded two chicken breasts and cut them into 5 pieces each, rubbed a teaspoon of packet chicken seasoning into them, then dipped them in flour then in the egg mixture and in flour again, fried on olive oil for a tiny bit and put them in the oven. After that I made a sauce with some water, bouillon powder and flour. Served it with a fresh salad. 5 stars :)

Great recipe. I tried it tonight, and we were astounded.  You couldn't really taste the paprika, and the garlic powder was just hinted at, but the lemon and butter were very profound and enhanced the chicken quite well. If anything, though, it oculd be suggested to lower the amount of lemon juice used.

The sauce was realy, really bland. I kept trying to add things to flavor it up a bit but it didn't help a whole lot. I probably won't cook this again.

For the 2 teaspoons bullion I used Wylers Granules and it ruined the sauce, it was WAY too salty.  The chicken part of the recipe was very good, but I ended up grabbing an old standard cookbook and quickly re-creating the sauce.

This was very good! I even ran out of lemon juice to put in the sauce, and it was still delicious. The chicken turns out perfectly. My only complaint was that it did not seem to make very much sauce, which is not what I expected. My fiance whipped up a cream sauce out of what sauce there was though, which turned out quite nice. We will definitely be having this again!

I made this recipe no changes, it was excellent! I think I used too much chicken and not enough of the boiling water mixture because one piece or two did start to burn but will just adjust for that next time.  Will def make this again!

This was okay, but not great. I followed the directions with no changes or substitutions. The coating on the chicken was soggy.

Not sure what this is suppose to taste like but it was pretty good. The breading was a little soggy and came off if it was handled to much. The lemon flavor was just enough and not over powering.

I thought this was pretty good. I added a lot more lemon juice for flavor, but I was using the kind that comes in a bottle and not fresh lemon juice so maybe that is why. I made it with some garlic and cream noodles on the side as suggested by some other reviewers. Was a good dish and would make again. Seems like something was missing from the crust though that could have given it more kick but I'm not quite sure what. Maybe will add lime next time like one reviewer suggested.

Like others, I pounded the chicken, then floured it lightly (with plain flour), dipped in egg mixture then dipped in flour mixture. I browned the chicken in butter added 1/2c of white wine, brought it all to a boil, then added a little bit of cornstarch mixed with water to help thicken it. Must add capers!

this was good but next time i will use fresh lemons for the lemon juice.to make a thicker sauce i let the sauce reduce by half and mixed 1/2 tsp. cornstarch with 1/4 cup water then whisked it into the sauce and added about 1/2 cup white wine.

This was okay for a low calorie meal. I served it with cooked carrots. I upped the amount of garlic powder and will add even more the next time. I used chicken broth and white wine to simmer it in. It needs a little more 'pizazz' so next time I will add more spices or maybe some sweet chili sauce.

This was the first recipe I made from this site, and it turned out great every time I made it. It's been a while, so all I remember as far as deviations from the recipe are concerned is that I put the chicken in the fridge for 15-20 minutes once they were covered in flour. That seems to make the coating stay on much better once it gets into the pan. Served with rice, and it was great.

This recipe wasn't as good as I expected from the reviews.  I liked the sauce and the unique flavor of it, but the chicken wasn't fabulous.  My husband gave it 3.5 stars so I don't know if I'll give it another try.

Disappointing - mainly because adding liquid to the skillet while the chicken is still cooking loosens and wets the coating on the chicken, making it gloppy.  Chicken piccata I on this site is a better bet.

I thought this was really good!  Just a few minor changes: I used olive oil to brown the chicken to make it a little more on the healthy side.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon sugar to the sauce and as others suggested used 1 less Tbsp lemon.  Made it  next to Rice Pilaf and my husband and 3 year old ate it all up!

Excellent!  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I bought thin cutlets, and they worked out great.  The only change I made was to lessen the lemon juice in the sauce at the end.  I used only 1 tbsp and it was perfect.  I'll definitely make this again!

Mine didn't turn out very tender.  The coating/sauce combination had a good flavor, though.  Overall, not worth the effort.

I have been looking to recreate chicken piccata, and under the influence of all the positive ratings i followed suit. I now make it all the time, using this recipe. It's easy and wonderful. In terms of change, mine are minimal- I do as other reviewers have suggested and pound the chicken thin, then coat in egg and flour twice. Very good. I add extra lemon but that's my own personal obsession! I love it.

I wanted to decrease the cook time so I pounded the chicken flat before dipping it in the egg and flour mixture. With more surface area to cover, I ended up needing slightly more flour (maybe 2 tablespoons). I allowed the chicken to simmer until my husband came home, so it ended up being a little more than 20 minutes.

I normally have a problem with chicken being too dry. This chicken was so juicy and tender, too! I could easily cut it with my fork. I loved the lemon zing, too. I would like to make this again with capers, and I saw another review recommending white wine, which I will also try.

I rated this recipe based on ease of preparation, taste, and how kid-friendly it is because I am a mom of four. My five year old son almost spit out his first bite. I'm assuming he thought it was too tangy because he normally likes chicken. My husband also thought it was too tart and asked me to use a bit less lemon juice next time (but he did say "next time!"). :)

Excellent recipe and so easy that, once I assembled the ingredients, my 2-year old cooked it! I didn't have lemon juice in the house so I substituted orange juice with about 2T sweet chili oil. It wasn't as spicy or acid as lemon juice would have been, but it made a lovely, savory chicken and sauce. My husband and the 2 kids just about licked their plates clean! Thank you!

Delish!  Served with Fettucini Alfredo.  Only change I made was to cook the chicken breasts in lemon olive oil rather butter because I had some in my pantry.

Maybe it was because I used fresh lemons, but this was WAY too lemony. Next time I think I will cut it back to only 2 tbsp of lemon juice. 

The chicken ended up very tender, and the breading was good. I did add a little bit of Wondra flour at the end to thicken the sauce up a bit.

This was awesome and easy! I nearly liked the skillet and my hubby, 3 and 6 year olds loved it too. I did as others in doubling the sauce and served over rice. I did 4 cups of cooked rice and the sauce even when doubled barely made a good coating. I may triple it next time.

This was a nice simple chicken recipe, and yet very delicious. I would suggest making a little extra sauce because it is so good! Very flavorful and tender, I will be making this again.

Excellent recipe. I did as others said and added the chicken to the sauce right before serving since I hate anything soggy.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.

WOW! I made this last night and it was wonderful! Very tasty sauce. I double dipped the chicken coating and refrigerated it for 30 minutes suggested by another reviewer and also doubled the sauce amount. Next time I'll triple it though. The only other thing I changed, I used low sodium soy sauce, unsalted butter and Herb-Ox no sodium chicken boullion and it still turned out great. Will use this again.
THANKS!

I thought this dish was a little bland, but I didn't have garlic salt so I'm sure that was the key.  I'll give it five stars though because my husband loved it!

I've never tried something on this site with such high ratings and been so disappointed! The sauce was SO salty I had to dump it down the sink and start again. I was able to make a good variation based off of this recipe, but I DO NOT suggest making it as the recipe states. What worked for me: made the chicken with egg/breading and fried. Made the sauce using 1/4 cup margarine (didn't have butter), 2 TBSP lemon juice, 1 TBSP sugar, a dash of garlic, basil, crushed bay leaves, then thickened with cornstarch/water mixture. Poured sauce over chicken at the table. It turned out quite tasty with these modifications.

Pretty good. I had the heat a little too high and so the butter got a bit brown, I think. The "sauce" turned out a bit too strong because of it. Any tips?

DEEEELISH! My husband and I both loved this. It's easy to make and very tasty. The only change I will make is to double the amount of sauce.

This was very good. I doubled the sauce and added a little cornstarch to it. Coated the chicken and then put it in the fridge for 30 minutes, and added capers. I served over noodles, and it was great.

Awesome! The kids didn't like it as much as I thought they would, but I think it had more to do with the consistancy than the taste. Next time I'll try to keep the chicken crispier, and I think they'll like it more.

This I give 5 stars, however I made the mistake of adding way too many capers to my dish and some of the liquid (while trying to get the capers out) and my sauce was extremely salty (my own fault), however since I am new at this, I must have put the cornstarch in at the wrong time because it was clumpy and tried my darnedest to break it up... anyway, Thank you for the recipe, I will for sure make this again (with no capers..lol)

Both my husband and I really liked this. I omitted the flour and lessened the butter (just cuz I'm on a diet :D ) and added a few sprinkles of parsley and basil. I'm definitely doing this again. Thanks for sharing Terry!

I'm a little surprised. Reading the reviews I had high expectations for this recipe. Perhaps this is how it's supposed to taste and I just wouldn't like it no matter what. I followed the recipe exactly as suggested, but used one reviewer's advice and added cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it and only added the chicken in the end, I also made sure the chicken was thin, so I don't think I went wrong anywhere, I'm not crazy about the taste, not a favorite and probably wont' be making again. It's not a healthy recipe anyways, with the frying and the butter etc, it's probably best that we don't eat this often, so I'm not so sad that we didn't love it!

This is soooo good!  You should definitely try it! I cut my chicken breast into strips before coating with flour mixture and cooking. This puts more flavor in each bite!  I only use half the butter, and substitute the other half with olive oil. I also double the lemon juice with the boullion. Just turn chicken pieces very carefully so as not to remove the breading!

I like this but changed it more for my taste.  I don't use egg or flour and I use olive oil instead of butter.  I don't like the breading part, because it seems to get soggy in the sauce.  So I just spice the chicken and make a sauce with 2 c chicken broth, 2 tbs lemon juice, and 1 cup white wine (since the wine reduces).  Since I like it better with all the changes, I didn't rate it as high.

Very good! The sauce needed to be quadrupled for our tastes... I think it would have been too bland otherwise. However, the problem could stem from that I didn't use a tenderizer on the chicken. I will definitely be making again to find out!

We do a lot of chicken, so I'm always looking for new ways to cook it, and this is so delicious!  My boys asked me to "make this all the time."  I agree with what other reviewers have said - not enough flour mixture or sauce.  Double these.  Thank you very much, Terry!

This was very good. I didn't have the granular bullion so I used a cube. I also upped the garlic and paprika to a 1/4 teaspoon. I threw in a tablespoon of capers during the last 10 minutes of cooking time. I also thickened up the sauce with a little flour and served over noodles. Thanks for the recipe this was really tastey. Thanks for the recipe.

I wish I could just drink this sauce; it was so good!  I did as some others suggested and did not cook the chicken in the sauce:  I poured the sauce over the chicken when I served it.  I also doubled the sauce (mmmmm), added 1 tsp or so of sugar, and added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Will definitely make again!

I think this recipe has potential but needs some tweaks for my taste.  Personally, I thought this was extremely salty.  The next time I make it I would use low sodium chicken broth instead of the granules.  In also followed other's suggestions such as pounding out the chicken, dipping in flour mixture (w/ fresh lemon zest) - egg mixture w/ fresh lemon juice - flour mixture, and then sauteed in olive oil & butter.  Removed from pan and placed the chicken in the oven at 200 to keep warm.  Moving on to the sauce, I used fresh lemon juice and also added some jarred lemon zest.  I also did the corn starch/water mixture to thicken it but think I used too much as my turned out a bit more 'gelled' then I would have liked.  Served over rigatoni noodles w/ carrots.  I think the chicken itself had great flavor, I just need to tweak the sauce a bit so it's not so salty and the texture is more smooth.

Pretty darn good chicken. I did pound out the breasts before I did anything - I also doubled the amount of flour and seasoning that I used to coat the breasts. In addition to these changes, I used the juice of one lemon - and frequently squeezed lemon juice on the breasts as they were cooking. Great lemon-y flavor - very tasty, will likely make again!

I took cristyscookin's suggestions.  I would marinate the chicken with the seasonings adn I baked my chicken. It came out tender and with a good taste.

Though the chicken was tender, it was extremely bland to me. I was also disappointed at the mushy coating. Perhaps baking the chicken, as other reviewers had done, and using the butter-sauce just as a gravy and not a poaching liquid would be better.

My husband really liked this one!  I did not dip the chicken in egg - just the flour mixture.  I used chicken stock instead of the cube and added cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  We also poured the sauce over our rice - yum!

This was AWESOME! It was very easy to make and the chicken was very tender and tasteful. I used this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. I used a few pieces of crushed garlic in the pan as well. Very yummy.

Loved it! Had to add more flour because it was only enough for two, because of that I double the amount of the garlic and paprika. Also I added a little more chicken powder.

This recipe was really good. Yes, it was a little soggy but I do not like my chicken piccata crunchy, so it worked out well. I made two changes: 1: Used chicken broth and let it simmer to close to 30 minutes. 2. Added some capers at the very end. Yummy. Will definitely make it again.

Sorry, we did not care for this at all. I doubled the sauce as to have extra for the linguine I paired this with. I followed the direction of adding extra broth as it evaporated out of the pan, however this turned the crispy coating (that I looked forward to!) into a mush. The chicken had a good taste but the texture was very unappealing. The kids ate it but asked to not to serve it again.

I was expecting a more lemony taste - perhaps I should have taken note of what other people had done to modify it.  I will try again but change some stuff.  It definitely needed more sauce.

Excellent, we all liked it. I doubled the garlic powder, but otherwise didn't change anything (I made 3 chicken breasts). I think next time I will make more sauce--it is delicious over pasta, which I made as a side dish.

Good stuff, while simmering, if the liquid reduces too fast, then you add some broth.

This was good- but I would cut the boullion in half next time because it was just too salty.  I used "Better than Boullion" and a whole fresh lemon.  I also just used 2 chicken breasts but kept everything else the same, except I did use 1 cup water instead of 1/2 cup, so I would have more sauce.  Next time, I would thicken the sauce with cornstarch.  Served with cappelini pasta and veggies.

Good recipe!  However, I did notice there was no salt & pepper listed in this recipe, so I added some sea salt and ground pepper.  Had to double the flour mixture for 4 breasts - maybe they were larger than most?  I also took note of other reviewers saying it was 'soggy' so I removed the pan cover for the last 10 minutes and the chicken was very tender and juicy, not soggy.  Will make again.

I noted the others' advice and ended up letting the chicken simmer in the sauce for only about 5 minutes after putting it in the oven awhile. It was an easy, healthy, good recipe. I served it with couscous and green beans, didn't pour the sauce over it, and it was very good. I'll definitely make it again.

Sauce has good flavor needed a bit of thickening. Needs more garlic and salt. Served over whole wheat pasta nice combo.

I followed all recommendations, and I wasn't a fan of the taste. The others who ate it said, "good, not great."

This is a family favorite at my house.  I add lots of garlic after right the chicken browns before I add the liquid. I also use Montreal Chicken  seasoning instead of bullion.

Great, so lemony and moist. I added some wine and a little extra lemon juice by accident, but it turned out great.

UPDATE: I recently made Cook Illustrated's version just for comparison. We all agreed that this version on AllRecipes is better! I will, however, take CI's advice to cut the chicken breasts into two 1/4" thick cutlets. This made for very tender, cut with your fork, chicken!

Delicious and so easy to make!  A great dish to make for guests.  I think this recipe is better than many versions I've had in restaurants.  It's one of the few recipes that mom, hubby and all three kids will happily eat!

This was an excellent recipe.  Very easy to prepare and very tasty.  Just added a little wine to the broth, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  A big hit with my family.

The chicken had really great lemon flavor, but I agree with other reviewers about the soggy breading.  I might forego the simmering bit at the end next time, and just spoon it over the chicken as a sauce or forego the breading and just simmer it in the broth.  Overall, a good recipe!

I love this recipe-it is so simple and delicious!!!I never have boullion cubes in the house so I always omit the last part and just brown the chicken in the skillet before we eat it. I also use plain bread crumbs instead of flour. Thanks for this great easy chicken recipe!!!

Very good. I used 3 chicken breast and doubled the sauce and it still wasn't enough. I cooked with mushrooms and capers as suggested and also used 1T of cornstarch mixed in wine to thicken. Now that I made it I know how to tweak it for next time.

This was yummy, a little heavy on the lemon flavor though.  I suggest using fresh lemon juice since the lemon is the dominant flavor and it tastes a bit cloying with bottled
lemon juice.  I also needed some flour to thicken the sauce, which I mixed with angel hair pasta.

Fantastic!  Easy and delicious - how could it be any better?  Followed recipe exactly as given.  I was almost hoping the 15-yr old "chicken-hater" wouldn't like it so there would be left-overs, but she likes it too.

Very Easy. Very Tasty. I added capers and mushrooms and doubled the sauce though. Then I lifted the chicken out of the sauce (when it was done) and put some corn starch in. I let it thicken for a few moments, then put it over pasta. It was YUMMY! I will definitly make it again.

Delicious!  My husband said I'd definitely have to make it again so I know it must be worth 5 stars.  I doubled the sauce as suggested by others however I still did not have enough so I guess I'll have to quadrouple it next time.  :)  I also double dipped the flour and it came out perfect!  Thanks!

Very good, very easy!  I would say this is more like Francese than Piccata, but if you add capers it would be more similar.

GREAT recipe!  The chicken was juicy and tender, the taste was superb!  I thought it was a little salty, but I think that's just me, I don't like too much salt.  I will probably fix this for a formal dinner, it's very easy to cook and it doesn't demand much attention.  I was able to fix the side dishes and dessert while this was cooking.

DELISH! I loved it. My friends loved it, we will be making it again. So simple, yet so fancy! I also doubled up on the sauce and added capers. I also added a smidge of cornstarch and water at the end to give the sauce some texture. I highly recommend this recipe!

For this recipe, i substituted veal cutlets for chicken, which took about 6 minutes on each side. Also, instead of the chicken boullion in water, i used a dry white wine and added capers. It came out fabulous.

This was ok. I'll make it again because husband liked it. It fried up really nice, but after putting the liquid over the chicken it turned all soggy. I guess I was just in the mood for more crispy chicken. Not bad on the flavor...served with mashed potatoes and veggies.

Years ago I had this delicious chicken and could never remember what it was.  This is what it was.  I'm sure it would be delicious if I could just get it to turn out right!  :o)  My coating will not stay on!  We end up eating plain chicken with pieces of the coating hanging off - looks very unattractive.  Will try again!

I made this dish last night and my husband and I loved it.  I had never made chicken piccata before and I am not much of a cook, but this recipe is very easy.  I did double the sauce as recommended by others and tossed some penne in it.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought this dish was pretty tasty, but my fiance didn't like it at all... it tasted more like lemon chicken than chicken piccata (we couldn't believe that there were no capers!!).  But if you can get past the fact that it's really not like piccata, then it is very good.

This is as good as you get at an Italian restaurant.  I doubled the boullion/water and lemon juice to have sauce to put over angel hair.

Fantastic, simple, healthy--everything you could want in a chicken dish. The chicken was so moist you wouldn't even know it was done in pan.

This was pretty good.  I had to improvise a little because I was with out some items.  I did not have the Chicken bouillon powder so I used a packet of Chicken Gravy.  I also doubled the sause as suggested.  I ran out of lemon Juice so I used some lemon lime soda (Sprite) in place of it, and it turned out pretty good.  This is a keeper!

As suggested by most people, I doubled the sauce too. However, I found it rather soury so I added some sugar to it. Pretty good, will try it again.

This was an awesome meal!  My husband is super picky and he loved it too.  I did change a few things though.  I used olive oil instead of butter, I also added mushrooms and onions to the sauce.  This one is a keeper!

Amazing! I doubled the water and bullion to create more gravy & poured over agel hair. I also needed a lot more flour, garlic etc. for dredging. No leftovers! Next time I will try to cut down on the butter and add olive oil.

This was wonderful. We normally don't eat fried chicken, but the lemon sauce over it was great. I took the advice of one of the reviewers and added white wine to the broth. Will definetely make again.

i thought this was very flavorful. i must've did something wrong tho. i did everything the recipe said except i replaced the water w/ white wine. i guess i read the reviews wrong n' thought u were supposed to replace it rather than ADD it. the liquid evaporated too quickly and i was left w/ just chicken and no sauce. next time i'll do it exactly and ADD white wine. it was still delicious tho. if i can mess up n' have it taste this good...can't wait to see how good it will taste when i do it right.

Very Delish! I found that the coating browned a bit more than I was expecting during the 20 min cooking period, but it ended up just adding more rich flavor. I found that the breading didn't totally stay on, but I think using a non stick pan would have helped a lot. I really enjoyed this recipe, as did my boyfriend who usually considers chicken breast bland and boring. Thanks!!

My whole family liked this recipe.  Very tasty and tender.  I pounded the chicken breasts to a uniform thickness (between 1/8" and 1/4" cut them into 2" x 1/2" pieces before dredging and cooking.  This will definitely become a regular on our table.

This was DELICIOUS!!  I added a small can of mushrooms and some chopped artichoke hearts.  Also I skipped breading the chicken and added some water mixed with corn starch to increase and thicken the sauce.  Definitely a keeper.

I read some of the other reviews so I changed it a little. I double dipped the chicken then I cooked it in a little olive oil until chicken was completely done. In a seperate pan I combined the bullion, lemon and water, it was still a little watery so I added a can of chicken broth. Let mixture come to a boil then slowly added about  half the mixture to the chicken and let it simmer (for sauce thickened). It was awesome so good and breading stayed on. Will cook again!

I think the recipe was good but the coating did not stay on mine.  I will make the chicken seperate from the sauce next time.

I made this with large shrimp. I browned the shrimp in butter and olive oil, removed them then made the sauce. (I also added capers - I liked them but my boyfriend didn't...) Very good!

I followed others suggestions and added mushrooms,garlic, white wine,artichoke hearts and capers.  It was good but not amazing.  Think it might have been pretty bland without the changes.

My 7 year old daughter and I really liked this. My husband did not like. He said it had no flavor and was to soggy. He told me not to make this again. Since I liked it so much I will have to make it when he is not around.

Reduced this to two servings and didn't do the breading. Excellent recipe. Added a bit of fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic powder. Also, reduced the amount of chicken bouillon so it wouldn't be so salty.

Tried this for the first time tonight and we really liked it. I doubled the ingredients in Steps 1 & 2. I also added 1/4 cup Italian bread crumbs in Step 2. Instead of bouillion cube and water I used 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup white cooking wine. In step 4 I added 2 teaspoons of capers & one package of sliced mushrooms. Served with steamed brocolli & carrots and a prepackaged pasta side dish. Highly recommend!

Excellent flavor. Found it "just right" on the salt content. Will use the double amount of flour mix next time. Tastes best on the same day, next day- a little too soggy. Otherwise, great recipe for a fast and easy weeknight dinner.

The best recipe on this site so far.  I made 3x's the amount of sauce, and served chicken on a plate of pasta.  I sprinkled with garlic salt and parsley flakes.  My whole family LOVED it.  Thanks for this great recipe.

Quite good.  I cooked it with sliced mushrooms and served it over pasta.  I mis-timed the pasta so I had to leave the chicken simmering an extra twenty minutes.  I just added more chicken broth and lemon juice so the pan wouldn't dry out and it turned out well, a nice feature of a recipe.  One complaint: when just eating pasta with sauce, the sauce was too weak -- I had to add more lemon and butter.

Super easy!!! Great instructions. And for those of you who have never purchased capers before, you can find them in a jar next to the olives and relishes. I will make this again!

Pretty good on the whole. For a more authentic piccata, I pounded the chicken thin, and removed it from the pan after it was cooked and made the sauce separately. I added some white wine to the sauce and used broth instead of boullion and water. Was skeptical when I tasted the sauce on its own--a little sour--but it was very tasty over the chicken and pasta. Will make this again!

Very good!!  My kids even loved it and that is always a bonus!  The only problem I had was that some of the breading fell off when I turned the chicken over.  Other than that I will definitely be making this dish again.

My husband LOVED this recipe. He isn't a big fan of chicken in general, but he loved this! I also refridgerated the chicken after it was battered and floured, and then re-floured before putting it into the pan. Once the chicken was done, I threw fresh spinach into the pan and it cooked in 3 minutes. The recommended lemon in the recipe worked perfectly for us, and I threw in white wine as well for the chicken to cook in. We loved it!!!! Will make over and over again.....

I wanted to try this recipe exactly as written.  I liked it, but next time I will take the advise of other reviewers and add garlic, wine and capers to the sauce.  I also thought it was lacking in lemon flavor so I will also add more lemon.  I used a cast iron skillet,half butter and olive oil, and had absolutely no problem with the breading falling off as others have stated.  I also doubled the flour mixture and it was exactly the right amount to cover 4 pounded chicken breast.  Can't wait to try this again with the changes!

Delicious!  My husband enjoyed it too, though he said he didn't taste the lemon... and i used a little extra of that!  
I definitely think you need to double the flour to coat the chicken well.  I also pounded the chicken to about 1/2 inch thickness.

Chicken was very tender, but I really dobn't see the point of adding the chicken boullion and additional lemon juice, it didn't add any extra flavor, just made it very salty and made the coating soggy. Will try again eliminating those ingredients.

this was really, really good.  i had a little trouble- there wasn't enough flour for the three large chicken breasts i used.  also, i added a splash more of the lemon juice.  other than that, it was great.  next time i'll make it with lots of mushrooms- i put them in when i added the chicken broth mixture & they really soaked up the flavor.  served with asparagus & mashed potatoes-- used extra broth as gravy-- next time i'll thicken that up as well.  very pretty golden color.

I absolutely loved this dish, not only for the taste but for the simplicity as well.  I used a 1/2 cup each of flour and breadcrumbs and let the coated chicken rest in the fridge for about half an hour so the breading would stay on better.  I used 11 tenderloins (since that's all I ever have) and threw in about 2 Tbls of drained capers and some dried parsley.  I served this with steamed green beans and roasted potatoes.  My in-laws really enjoyed this too and they are picky!  Will use this again in the future.  Many thanks.

the addition of egg actually maked this a franchese and not a piccata....so this a good chicken franchese. I would also suggest finding thin chicken cutlets, it cuts down on prep time,and cook time and helps if you do not have the tools to pound out chicken. I always add capers to my piccata with a smidge of tomato sauce....yum yum yummy!

This was saltier than I prefer.  Maybe increasing the boiling water would help to dillute the bouillon and make the dish less salty.

This was such a moist and flavorful chicken! We really enjoyed it.  I added some fresh sliced mushrooms, and it was a perfect meal.  Very easy preperation.  Thanks Terry for sharing!
