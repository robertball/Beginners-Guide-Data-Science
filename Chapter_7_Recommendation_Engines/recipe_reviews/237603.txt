Made this exactly as written except to use black beans instead of black eyed peas.  The sauce is way too oily!   Oily and not very tasty.  Am now considering draining off the sauce somehow and replacing with some Italian dressing. There are better cowboy caviar recipes out there.

I didn't care for the dressing at all so I had to throw it out (too oily and flavorless).  I'm glad I didn't put it on the bean/corn mixture before tasting it.  Instead I used a prepare balsamic vinegar dressing.

Delicious! My family loved it! I used pinto beans, black beans, half an onion, and half a red pepper. When serving, strain the beans with a slotted spoon. You can make another batch with the remaining marinade. Terrific!

I made this on New Year's Day, as a non-traditional way to serve black-eyed peas.  I followed the recipe closely, but I chose to put in only 1/2 cup of onion, because I don't care for the taste of raw onions.  This reminds me of Three-Bean Salad, and the dressing basically tasted like the liquid from sweet pickles.  I boosted the Southwestern flavor by adding some cumin and some chili powder, to taste.  Not sure I'll make this again, since the canned ingredients listed are not usually on my pantry shelf.  Thanks for posting.

I did the same thing as some of the other cooks here. I made the oil mixture, tasted it, and decided against it. All the veggies really need is salt, pepper, and a bit of cumin. There's enough liquid in the canned beans and corn, even when drained, to make a sauce. I also used chopped tomatoes and a can of green chilis to give it more flavor and kick. Yummy!

This was a hit at my sisters bbq!  I made it exactly how the recipe was written. I did add fresh squeezed lime juice. I didnâ€™t feel like it was too oily at all!  Definitely would recommend refrigeration overnight like the recipe stated. I had to share with my sister so she could make it today!!

Add another kind of beans instead of black eyed peas and other vegetables.  Add spices to suit my taste.  Always good and always get asked for recipe.  Made it many times!

A friend brought this to a weekend get away and we couldn't get enough of it. So delicious! I will definitely be making this in the future.  Might make it for a family birthday party this weekend.

Had to do a special shopping trip for this one and learned about a few new types of corn and beans (I had almost NONE of this in stock), but it was worth it. I've bought something very similar premade before, but this beats it hands down. I could sit down and make a meal out of this! Yum! Great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe except my husband isn't big on the beans so I used a can of the tiny peas drained and a can of French style green beans drained. Otherwise I followed the recipe.
