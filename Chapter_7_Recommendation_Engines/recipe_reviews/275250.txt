Turned out great!! Since this was the 1st time using my air fryer, I didn't realize I should've sprayed the pan because clean up was horrible.  But the recipe was wonderful

I went 16 minutes bone down and 11 minutes bone up and 5 minutes each side with bbq sauce applied in an Emeril Lagasse Power AirFryer 360 Plus.  Rib internal temp was 160 degrees when finished.  Ribs were of good flavor and cooked but not real tender like my smoker would do them.   Still air frying would be an alternative if you didn't have the time to smoke them.
