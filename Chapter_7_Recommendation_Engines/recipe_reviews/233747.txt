Updated review - we love spice in our house so hot sauce, peppers, and heat in general are a staple to any recipe. Also, these freeze well for a perfect grab and go breakfast. Just toss in the microwave for 30 seconds or so and you have a yummy and healthier grab and go breakfast that you can munch on the go and wave to the lugs waiting in line at the drive thru.

Easy and tasty. Made for a carry in breakfast and works well to pack and carry. Only one problem - the egg overflowed in my oven and so I had quite a bit of smoke in the kitchen. Next time I will have some foil to catch overflow.

I made this for my family breakfast for Father's Day (well I made it the day before because I was going to be away). It was pretty tasty overall, however both my mother and father believe that there was something missing. They believe that it needs something moist to bring it together because the biscuit becomes a bit crunchy (and a tiny bit hard.)  Overall we enjoyed it. I paired it with a really delicious hash brown casserole recipe from another website. It was  definitely an excellent breakfast dish compared to my normal pancakes.

The whole family loves to grab these in the morning! You definitely have to roll the biscuits out to make a thiner cup. I added my own seasoning (garlic and cumin for taste) the awesome thing is you can fit 2 in a baggie, heat for 45 secs and breakfast is served! Going to try different varieties (bacon, chorizo, veggie, etc). I always add hot sauce to mine after heating for extra pizzaz. :-)

WAY too much biscuit. I guess we prefer egg more. Glad to have tried though.

Three stars for flavor and 4 stars for practicality. Made this so we could eat them while travelling on a long trip and not have to stop as there are not may option in the first three hours of our route. I just didn't care for that funny flavor of refrigerator dough. Will try again with homemade dough.

made it with biscuits from trader joes, spicy linguica, corn, egg and shredded cheese. The corn seemed to keep things moist. Was really good.

Easy and good,  I used a jumbo muffin pan and I think a normal sized one would have been too small.  I will try a veggie version next (I imagine saut√©ing the veggies first). And maybe turkey bacon and spinach...its a keeper

I've made something even easier and you'll have everything on hand. Instead of a dough, I spray the muffin pan and then lay a thin slice of potato on the bottom. Pour the egg mixture on top. 1/4 cup should be enough, top with cheese and bake at 350 for 15 minutes or until mixture loses the shine. I have used broccoli and cheese, green onions with ham, swiss and corned beef and Mexican blend cheese with onion and green pepper. All were very good.

This is a very easy and very good recipe.  I made it just as the recipe says except that I only had Grands biscuits, so I divided each one in half and rolled it out.  This can also be easily adapted into a brunch food by adding mushrooms, onions, olives, etc.  It is also good to add crispy bacon bits instead of the sausage.

I was looking for a recipe for my 85 year old mom for bacon, egg & cheese.biscuits that would freeze & reheat easy, this recipe filled this requirement perfectly! I had already bought the ingredients for homemade biscuits & so I made them. She didn't have a muffin pan, so I used her smallest Corning ware bowls for the egg cups. They worked fine and were a better size for her.  I mixed spicy sausage with bacon. I added some spice so she could taste them, a little pepper jack cheese, too.  Next time, I'm putting the cheese in first because she says it ran off when she reheated them, but otherwise she really loved them! Thank you so much!

This is a great idea as a nice little breakfast to take to work. Being experimental I have come up with many ways to construct these. I do prefer to use large muffin cups tho as I can add "stuffings " to them such as pour the cup 1/2 full, add cheese, bacon, carmelized onion, and ham and fill it the rest of the way. I also use a tiny bread loaf. Nice recipe!

Easy to make and enjoyed by the whole family. I made the biscuit dough from scratch following this recipe: http://www.food.com/recipe/baking-powder-buscuits-488965 and rolled it quite thin (about 1cm) in order to make it stretch over the edge of the muffin cups to contain the egg mixture. Unfortunately a couple still poured over and required a little post-breakfast cleanup of my oven.  I used chopped sausage from the day before and thought maybe I'd over-filled the cups with it, but they turned out perfectly after 15 minutes in a 400¬∞ oven. About the only thing I'd adjust is the number of eggs for the number of biscuits you end up with: the biscuit recipe above made 12 cups which only required 3 eggs. I'm glad I didn't use the 7 called for!

I just made this morning using crescent rolls instead of biscuits because I didn't want too much bread as some of the reviews said.  Otherwise I made it just as the recipe reads, except I mixed the cheese into the egg mix and just sprinkled a little on top.  I might add one more egg next time.  My husband really likes them.   We were given some pork sausage and this is a great way to use it.  I will love trying this with cubed ham or bacon.  I'll be interested to see how they freeze and reheat in microwave.  Clean up was a little much because it sticks , but I have  very old muffin tins, so maybe it's time for  new non-stick ones.  It did not overflow for me at all. It's a keeper for us!  Thanks!

I've made this recipe twice now and love it !  Easy to freeze and heat up later. I eat them as a meal, too.  I made them with my large muffin pan that makes 6.Tried  both biscuit and crescent rolls and think I prefer the crescents.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe, and love how it is so versatile.

Winner in our house. I use the refrigerated dough because it's easier and veggie sausage. When I make a batch, will put whatever cooked veggies I have plus protein (black beans and corn, spinach and veggie sausage, kale and veggie sausage, pepperoni, etc). Also I use half the cheese recommended (don't find it need it all) and fill the muffin cup to 3/4 full even if the actual dough is filled and overflowed. It's generally not a problem with sticking, except in my cheaper muffin pans.

I added cumin, freeze dried chives and a little cayenne pepper and it was awesome.  Also, you don't necessarily have to have a crust for these. I made low carb ones for the diabetic folks in the family.

These are a welcome change from scrabbled eggs and toast. For those of you that are having trouble rolling out the biscuit dough try this...flour each biscuit on both sides and press flat with your fingers.  Let the flattened dough "rest" for about 10 minutes. Then, using a rolling pin, roll the dough out to the correct size.  (Pressing the dough out slightly and allowing it to rest should prevent it from shrinking after you press it into the muffin pan.)

Hack #1 - measure the milk into a 4 cup measuring cup and then add your eggs and seasonings and beat.  This way you can pour into the cups.

Potential hack #2:  Try using small tortillas in place of the biscuit dough - the lazy way is to curl the tortilla to make a cone shape.  Pour the egg mix right before the oven and note that the tortillas can tear easily and egg will seep below.

Used Italian sausage, diced red bell pepper, red pepper flakes, green onions and fennel seeds.  Hand-flattened the biscuit dough to fit the muffin cups.  Yes the egg mixture overflowed over the top of the cups.

These are delish. They hold up well in the fridge so you can put a few in a ziplock and reheat the next day. My hubs will eat like 5 in a sitting though. Haha

Took these to a breakfast potluck at work and they were a huge hit! I'd probably add more salt & pepper next time but I wasn't really going to taste raw egg mixture to test it out. I'm not great at rolling out dough so I was nervous about that part initially but I got the smaller, flaky biscuits and they actually rolled out pretty easily with a little flour! Definitely a necessary step as the dough was almost too thick even then. Make sure you really coat the whole muffin cup as mine stuck to the sides pretty comically on one pan and were perfect on the other (newer, shinier, non-stickier) pan :)  Two rolls of the smaller flaky biscuits made 20 cups, which was really perfect for the same amount of goop!

First time making this and it came out great. I did some tweaks to the recipe though. 

First, I used a can of pillsbury biscuits (8) and split all but 2 in half  then rolled them flat. I didn't want too much dough and I'm glad I did cuz I later read that some ppl were complaining it was too much dough. 

I made 4 variations(3each)  since these were just for my husband and myself, I didn't want to get bored of the same flavor through out the week.
1- egg & Mexican blend cheese, 
2- spinach, onions and Mexican blend cheese, 
3- baby Bella mushrooms w/arugula, spinach and Sorrento cubes garden herb cheese
4- sujuk(Albanian sausage) with Mexican blend cheese. The Mexican cheese blend I used was 2% reduced fat. 

I used the last two biscuits to make pigs in a blanket with cheese for hubby man. I was testing this out for super bowl day. Came out good ?? 

They were all DELICIOUS!!! I will definitely be making these again.

This is a great recipe.  I have made a number of different recipes using Crescent Roll products for the shell.  Any meal type filling can be used and flavored to taste.  One thing that I have found is that with some biscuit or dinner roll dough, preheating and even partially baking the shell helps to ensure it gets done.  It is especially important when the filling is precooked as I do with some recipes.

I made a whole30 version of this with just home made country potatoes on the bottom, all organic eggs and bacon. Tastes great chopped up in a salad with avocado.

Made these for Sunday breakfast, they were awesome. I did change the recipe just a little. I made a mistake and only got 1 tube of 8 biscuits. I got the pillsbury southern homestyle grands. I cut them in half and spread them out to fill the muffin tins. I cut the eggs to 6 instead of 7 (next time I will cut the eggs to 5, it made more then I needed). Everything else I followed to the recipe. The combo of everything was perfect. Husband loved them and now we have breakfast on the go for work.

Awesome recipe and convenient. The kids love them and I have started breakfast prepping for the entire week. I make two types. One with sausage and the other cubed ham, and both with a touch of velveeta inside. Make sure you move your oven rack to the upper-middle level or the biscuit will get over done and don't forget to trim the brown edge off of the top. You do these two things and you'll be good to go.

This could not be easier. I can't wait to play around with this recipe. If you add onions and peppers it could be an omelet cup. Great, easy, hot breakfast option for school days.  I would suggest putting a cookie sheet under the muffin pan as mine overflowed.

Love these with Grands honey butter biscuits.  Grands work best if you split them in half.

I love this recipe but I have made it twice and I found that using the "cheapy" little canned biscuits were way better than my second attempt with the big Grands biscuits.  The ratio was totally off with the big biscuits making way too much dough.  thanks for a great recipe

We followed the recipe to the letter all of the egg ended up at the bottom of my oven when the biscuit dough rose. I wouldn't make this again.  It is a good idea but would probably have been better with a pie crust instead so the egg wouldn't overflow.

half a biscuit would work much better and it needed a little garlic or rosemary, otherwise a very impressive presentation when it comes out of the oven. Totally make it again.

I must have totally messed up the instructions. The egg muffins wouldn't come out of the cupcake wrappers, so they had paper all stuck to them.  I tried to freeze the leftovers and they did not thaw well. I'm sure it was all my doing, but I would not make this again.

My husband was the one who cooked this and it was delicious.
He said it was simple and easy to make.  You can change items for those you would prefer but overall it was an A++!  I count myself lucky to have a hubby that can cook....better then me!!

Did anyone else have a horrible turn out with this? What am I doing wrong? I rolled out the dough, pushed into the cups, filled with bacon/egg/cheese and baked. Upon baking the egg was pushed out of the cups by the expanding biscuit dough. I ended up with cooked egg all over the outside of my pan and muffin cups with raw egg and biscuit. It was a mess. Had I continued baking my biscuit edges would have bee burnt.

I used Grands biscuits and it overflowed. I will try it with regular biscuits and hopefully they won‚Äôt overflow. I got lots of compliments when I took it to a breakfast potluck! This will be one of my go tos.

Make sure you have big cups for your muffin tin & use small size biscuits.  I had egg mixture all over the bottom of my oven. It smelled for days afterward. I also added some green peppers I had & some bacon. My grandkids loved it.

Was very good. I will be making it again with a few changes. I used the grande size biscuits in a regular size muffin cup. They expanded and overflowed in the oven. It made a terrible mess. So next time I will either use regular sized biscuits or get a large muffin pan. I made the recipe as written and it was really good but want to try adding some onion and bell pepper.

Haven‚Äôt eaten yet, but rating on ease of recipe. Sounds easy, few ingredients, and you can customize which I like. Rolling out the dough is tedious, in the future would use something that didn‚Äôt need rolled out like a wonton wrap, or not use a bread element and just make with eggs. Grocery pickup substituted regular sized biscuits with jumbo, so I halved each biscuit - 8 jumbo biscuits made 16 biscuit cups. Everything else was as expected, add meat, sprinkle with cheese, pour scrambled eggs over the top. Using biscuits just wasn‚Äôt as straight forward as I thought. Luckily I made these in advance and will be freezing, so will have something easy to heat up for breakfasts.

I just made a batch of these muffins and they are really good! I used pre-cooked turkey sausage crumbles and added some Tony's Creole seasoning to the egg mixture to spice things up a bit. I have a hungry fisherman at home and these muffins are perfect for him to heat up for a quick breakfast before he heads out on the boat on chilly mornings!

So I didn't make any major changes.  I made this in individual casserole dishes for a brunch dish... I rolled the biscuit dough really thin, sauteed green peppers, onions and turkey sausage for the filling and added some spices to the egg mixture and extra cheese.  Because they were in casseroles, they had more egg and had to cook longer but they were GREAT when they were done.  The ratio was perfect and the egg rose really nicely.  Everyone loved them and in the little Le Creuset dishes they were really cute and a fun brunch item.  These will DEFINITELY be making an appearance again.  
OH, AND I bought "Junior Biscuits".  So the people who complained they were too biscuity I think you could just minimize the dough.  It made a nice base without being overwhelming.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars, was that I wasn't keen on the biscuits.  Will make it again but using crescent roll dough or pie crust instead.  

I did substitute sausage for the ham and added bell peppers,  onion and tomato so it was  like an omelet in a biscuit cup.

Added diced peppers, topped with grated cheese and skipped wrapping the bacon in the tin. They came out perfect. Great texture!

OmG put a WARNING NOT TO USE grand biscuits. They puffed up so much they push all the contents out over the pan, egg everywhere. So all I was left was a sausage biscuit

These were excellent. I did make my own biscuit dough and rolled it quite thin. Besides the sausage meat I also added a little chopped green onion to each as well as chopped, cooked mushrooms.   I sprinkled the cheese over the egg mixture last. They were perfect!  Note:  I froze them to take camping for an easy breakfast.

Do not use the "Grands" " style biscuits.  They will rise to much and cause the egg mixture to seep out of the biscuit cups.

Wow, the one time I didn't read the reviews first... mistake,,, way to much dough. will cut them in half next time so the eggs don't spill out all over. I always try to give a recipe a couple of chances and I think with some of the modifications that others talked about this will be great and versatile.

I am utterly confused as to how this recipe could have worked for so many other reviewers.  I used Annies organic flaky biscuits.  In retrospect I see that this recipe should be impossible.  Biscuits rise in the oven, so when I placed mine in the oven, the biscuit part rose, which pushed all the liquid eggs out and onto a waiting pan below.  I mean if you want to make quiche, you need to use pie crust dough, not biscuit dough.  In the end, I had muffin cups filled with biscuit, with a crowning of sausage and a small bit of egg on top.  85% of the eggs were on the pan that I had thankfully placed underneath my muffin pan.  In the end, I had to scrape the biscuits out of the pan because they were glued to it with the eggs that had run all over everywhere.

Great idea! Note that the biscuits rise quite a bit and will easily overflow, I found 1 whole biscuit too much for each muffin tin (regular size), they overflowed and left almost all biscuit and very little filling.  Next time I'll slice each in half  to be a little thinner crust, but they tasted amazing and are great for potlucks!

I read a review that said it was too much biscuit  for them so I made it without the biscuit and it turned out just fine. I alter the recipe almost every time I make it. I used turkey sausage patties, which are the perfect size for my muffin tin and serve as the base, and hash brown potatoes, then I pour the egg mixture over it and bake 20-25 minutes at 350. I've also added zucchini and squash or red, green and orange peppers with onions - it's so versatile, you can add whatever you like!

I make these for our Sunday school class and never have anything left.  They are the best and very simple to make.  This is one I actually follow the recipe because it is good as is.  Sometimes I do sprinkle more cheese on the top.

I make these a couple of times a month for breakfast. I only make 10 at a time (one can of biscuits) so I usually end up using 5-6 eggs. I don't measure anything...no need. I fry some bacon or sausage or chopped ham...throw it in the biscuit cup, fill the cup up with Eggs (S&P) and then top with a sprinkle of cheese. I freeze any leftovers and reheat them in a pinch.

Kids love them. I made it for the upcoming week and it turned into Sunday dinner. Use small biscuits, not grands or large biscuits. The first batch of large flaky expanded too much and pushed out some egg. If you don't have the entire muffin hole covered with biscuit, it's ok. Egg fills in. I didn't use paper cups either and no problem.

Good basic recipe.  I added red pepper, onion, cayenne pepper to the sausage during cooking, and added a rolled out biscuit to the top of each to make it more like a stuffed biscuit.  Will make it again and vary the recipe each time.

I will adjust the amount  for what we will eat that day. I also used too much flour and it did not taste good the next day. I will make this again soon, it is a great recipe and my kids loved being able to help make it.

You either need more cooking skill or more patience than I have to make this work (you probably have more of both!).  The biscuit dough keep shrinking back down the sides like it wanted to be biscuits again.  When I finally  got it into the oven, the dough burned before the egg part got done, it cooked over (thanks to the person who warned about this I put it on a cookie sheet) and what could be eaten was way too doughy.  Just a hot mess.  I might try again with crescent dough but I think I'll stick with casseroles until my skills improve.

I thought this was a great idea and it is, however, mine was sort of a disaster!  I used "large" size biscuits from the can and that must be too much biscuit because when they started cooked, they puffed up so big, all the egg ran out of the cups and spilled to the bottom of the oven and burned! I would Either A- place baking sheet under cups to make sure this doesn't happen again, B use way less dough, but then it's going to be hard to form a "cup" or C soft scramble the eggs a little first before adding......I sure did make a mess and burnt up my eggs, but I did salvage some of the cups and am taking them to Thanksgiving anyway.

This was a bit more frustrating than I anticipated. It is definitely not something I will try to make in the morning again. I might make them ahead of time. If you have a non-stick muffin tin don't grease it. It makes the dough slide down in the pan. Mine didn't have much flavor, even with salt and pepper. The biscuit was overcooked by the time the egg got done. I probably won't make them again.   Although, it's probably worth a second chance. I made a pan of them in a regular muffin tin and another batch in a mini loaf pan. The ones in the mini loaf pan turned out 10 times better.

I made it this morning. I used Aldi biscuits, only 10 in a package, so I did two with only sausage, egg, and cheese.  The biscuits didn't come all the way up the sides of the pan, which was fine for us.  It turned out really good.  My husband liked it with the biscuits, but I preferred it without the biscuits.  Next time we'll be adding veggies as well.

So it was fairly easy to make, however using the Pillsbury Grands per regular muffin cup was too much dough. The egg mixture overflowed - much on the bottom of my oven and not enough in left in the cup. We all thought it was too much dough. The parts where there was still egg/sausage/cheese were good.  I will try again by cutting the dough in half before rolling out.

Flavor was good, but clean up was a nightmare.  I used cooking spray just like I always do, but they stuck in the muffin cups.  We ended up using forks to eat them because they were in pieces.  I had to let the pan soak and still had to scrap and scrub forever to clean it all up.  Next time I'll just stick to my basic breakfast casserole in a 9x13 pan.

The cups were too full and the egg overflowed all over the oven.  I will split the biscuits in half next time.  Otherwise, these were great!

These are yummy but can be difficult to remove from the pan.  Make sure you grease the pan well or perhaps use a muffin wrapper.

Easy to make and simple to eat on the go. Hoping they freeze well as another reviewer mentioned. Cooking time was longer for my oven to ensure the egg was baked through. Be careful for spill over as it will smoke. I used sausage and turkey bacon. I added a little garlic & minced onion to the egg mixture for extra flavor. Thanks for sharing, it's a keeper!

Delicious! I used Grands biscuits,  so I may try smaller biscuits next time! My husband likes less bread and more meat so I used a lb or more of sausage! Great recipe!

Very easy and very tasty.  I took the advise from others about putting something under the pan to catch the cheese/egg overflow.  Next time I will roll the biscuit dough a little thinner.  I definitely will do this again.

This was the messiest breakfast cups I have ever made. Good idea in theory but totally not worth the huge mess in the oven from the eggs.

These are wonderful and easy to make. I did cut down the size of the ingredients because I didn't want that many. I actually made 10, the size of the biscuits can. I'd add cheese in my egg filling and possibly try ham or bacon. Just to see how those taste. These are excellent as is though. Simple to make.

I love the idea of making a quick and very  simple breakfast. Haven't made it yet, but since I make my own home-made biscuits, this recipe is on my agenda for this week. My family loves cheese, so I'm going to mix some into the egg mixture as well as sprinkle on top of Breakfast Muffin. Thanks sooooo much for sharing.

Delicious! Will definitely make again for guests. In regards to the reviews that said it lacked flavor, I made this with Neese's Hot Sauage and it was full of flavor, but not spicy. I recommend making sure you have flavorful sausage.  

I used crescent roll dough because it was what I had on hand and Egg Beaters (but did not add milk, salt or pepper) because there is an egg yolk allergy in the family. I used about 8oz of the egg beaters for 12 standard size muffin cups. I did not alter the cook time or temp and did not measure the sausage quantity or egg quantity per cup.

Didn't make any changes at all....Took them to ladies golf today and they were a HUGE hit!!!   Even tho I had to make them the day before they were still great.   Hot out of the oven would be the best way but heated up they are still great!

Was pretty good. Used grands flaky biscuits and pulled them in half to cut down on the dough. My two year old wouldn't eat it but my husband was a big fan.

Amazing recipe! We had no sausage or biscuits so we used lots of cheddar cheese, bacon, tomatoes and basil. They turned out as pizza flavoured breakfast cups!!!
