Due to user error, bad reviews (wrongly) happen to great recipes.  This turned out perfectly.  I DID adjust the baking time, as I was using a traditional lard pastry crust and I wanted to be sure it cooked through.  I baked at 425 for 15 mins and then down to 400 for another 5 mins.  The pastry was golden brown, and the filling nicely set - consistency of jelly, not runny.  Thank you so much for posting this traditional French Canadian dessert!  Grandma Watts would be proud!

Delish!! I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have walnuts, but they would be so good in this recipe so I will use them next time! A truly Canadian classic, and one of the best butter tarts I have had! Make sure to use PURE Maple syrup!! The pure maple syrup is thick and not too sweet!

These were fantastic.  The only thing I did differently was add about  2 tsp of vinegar; I remember my mother in law doing that, possibly cuts the sweetness a bit. I also used currants instead of raisins.   I love a runny consistency...a perfect butter tart  should require serious licking of the fingers and wiping of the chin during consumption! These actually set a bit more than that but the flavour was divine.  Will make again for a Canadian treat to share with my Aussie friends.

VERY GOOD. This is very close,  I think , to my misplaced Butter
Tart filling recipe. I made this and used corn syrup instead
of maple syrup like my other recipe. I can stop looking for my old recipe. This was very good.

I used my own pie dough and aluminum tart  pans.  The filling made enough for 7.  I omitted the raisins, and added pecans on top of a few.  I found it too sweet and despite using dark maple syrup I found the brown sugar was too predominant.  If I were to make it again, I would try a 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup.

Best butter tarts I've ever had!  It's a keeper of a recipe.  I used my own regular pie crust recipe but the butter tart filling was superb!

Loved this.  I used a mini muffin tray, cooked at 425 for 12 min, then 400 for 5 min.    My only issue is that (using the mini muffin tray), some of the tarts bubbled over onto pan and burned.  I peeled this small spots off, but wish I left a little more room.

Wasn't really a fan, it tasted great but was super runny and leaked everywhere. Family did not care for it.

These turned out awesome. They had a nice flavour of maple that blended well with the nuts and raisins. They were slightly runny but we like them that way. Would do this recipe again.
