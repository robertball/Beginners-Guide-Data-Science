MAKE THIS PIE!   OK, here are some "tweaks"...  Reduce sugar to 3/4 C. unless you like it super sweet.  Save yourself alot of time and buy a bag of frozen sliced fresh peaches (just like fresh without the hassle of poaching and peeling fruit).  I also use Marie Callender's frozen pie crust and it has never let me down.  Go the extra step and brush beaten egg over bottom & sides of crust before adding fruit.  Like others, I baked this pie 15 mins at 400, then 45 mins at 375.  Crust was firm (bottom) and flaky around edges.  I also made a streusel topping and sprinkled on top during last 20 mins baking time.  This pie is to die for... thanks Mary!

I made this recipe for 3 men and two teenagers ~ everyone had seconds. I used more peaches than called for (about 4 cups), increased the vanilla to 1 1/2 Tablespoons and added a 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon directly over the fresh peaches. I also added my top crust and baked at my usual pie temperature of 450 degrees for 10 minutes and then 350 for about 45-50 minutes, until the crust was golden brown. I served it with vanilla ice-cream. Everyone raved about this pie. To avoid a soggy bottom crust, try brushing a little beaten egg over it to seal it before adding the fruit filling. This works beautifully with this pie and blackberry pies, too!

WONDERFUL!  Very easy pie to make and flew out of the pan.  Everyone loved it and everyone wanted the recipe.  I did cut the sugar a tad, but other than that didn't change a thing.  I even used cheap store brand pie crust and was still wonderful.
Thanks so much for sharing this one.  I've made 3 this week and will make this the rest of the summer.
***** And now that it's fall I subtituted the peaches with apples and added some cinnamin and nutmeg for a wonderful apple pie.  I've gotten rave reviews with it.  My husband asks me to make it all the time.  I also took the recipe and used rolled out biscuits into a muffin tin and diced the apples and placed in the cups on top of the dough and then spooned some of the mixture overtop and it made some wonderful little tarts.
Mary, thanks so much for this recipe!

A great peach cream pie without any cream, which was killer because I never have cream around.  It tastes luscious (more of a custard than a cream), and it's a good balance of peach to custard amounts.  I even happened to have only one frozen pie shell around, so this was perfect!  Note: The cream mixture is really thick and pasty before baking, don't worry it "melts" and turns creamy as it cooks.

I have always enjoyed peach pie but since my wife passed away, it is up to me to make a pie.  I used the increased ingredients (vanila, spices etc) and baking temperature. I have Parkinsons and have absolutely no sense of smell and so I have to rely on visual inspection to determine doneness,  It took 10 minutes at 450 degrees plus 50 minutes at 350 to bake.  It was perfect!!  Yes I will make another Peach Pie (soon)!

Very nice!  I made as a deep dish because I had so many peaches.  This pie got rave reviews from hubby and the kiddos.  It's a little runny if you try to eat it before it's completely cooled, but it's still quite good.  Once it had fully cooled it was firm and delicious.

I used 1/2 cup Splenda instead of sugar, increased the amount of vanilla to about 1 1/2 t. and added about 1t. of almond extract.  Also added cinnamon, ground ginger, and nutmeg.  It was delicious, crispy on the top and bottom.  A keeper!

Since something obviously went very wrong with my pies considering all the great reviews (though a couple did mention spillovers), I will give it the highest rating, but mine were a disaster and I won't be able to taste them!  My friend gave me fresh peaches from her tree and I had enough for two pies.  Within ten minutes of putting them in the oven, I notice smoke coming from the top of the stove.  They were already spilling over!  Ten minutes later, there were flames.  I highly recommend using a deep dish with this pie.  I am not new to pie baking and have had pies cook over before, but never like this.  What a waste of homegrown peaches (I'm feeling sorry for myself).  I'm sure if you use a big enough pan, they would be wonderful.

This was the perfect peach pie recipe!  My 8 year old son asked me to make a homemade fresh peach pie for Christmas dinner dessert.  As you can imagine finding fresh peaches in late December is not easy nor cheap.  I had to try to ripen them the best I could, blanch them to make the peeling easier (although the skin wouldn't come off just from blanching but it DEFINITELY made it easier to peel).  I followed the recipe exactly.  Note: 5 medium peaches will be more than enough (a little over 3 cups).  Also, make sure you put little 1/2" inch foil strips along the edge of the entire pie crust to prevent burning.  Take them off after baking and you will have a perfectly lightly browned edging.  I will be making this again. I can only imagine how wonderful this pie will be with the big Georgia peaches in season.  Yum!

This was an excellent recipe.  I used a frozen pie shell and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup which was plenty.  The variations in reviews probably result from differences in amount of juice in the peaches.  I tried to drain mine off a little after I peeled them.  The pie was perfectly brown after one hour at 300, which really suprised me!

This is the best fruit pie I've ever tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came perfect.  I did take the advice given on this board and put a pizza pan under the pie pan to prevent spills in the oven.

Thanks for sharing this recipe!  I will make it again and again.

I chose this pie because similar ones were made with boxed pudding. However, the pie was "SUPER SWEET!" I thought it seemed like a lot of sugar for the amount of fruit. It took about 4 good sized peaches to make the 3 cups. I used a vegetable peeler and it worked great. I cut the peach slices into about 1/4" to make sure they were soft after baking. The mixture that is spread on it is kind of thick, but does melt down into the peaches. It was almost like a soft sugar cookie dough that goes on top. After it was baked I thought it had kind of a dry looking appearance. To fix that I brushed a light glaze on top and it did look pretty. I wish I would have cut the sugar back considerably and I like sweets. About 2 slices only got eaten, unfortunately. I had hopes for a good from scratch peach pie. Possibly cutting back the sugar might help some, I don't know.

The best peach pie I've ever had!!  As per some suggestions, I added much more vanilla, 1 1/2 tablespoons, and some cinnamon.  I also topped the pie with a streusel topping.  I usually bake pies at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and then 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  I did this one the same way and it was perfect. If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would!!

I made this recipe and I do believe the cooking temperature  was incorrect. The pie baked for one hour at 300 degrees and still was not done. I set the oven up to 350 degrees and baked it another 30 min and the top finally turned brown but cutting into the pie after it cooled the crust was raw.
The ingredients were tasty without the crust. Could this be a error? I would not attempt to try this again.

EXCELLENT recipe.   I did cut back on the sugar a little, but only because I was using fresh Palisades Peaches, and I added a couple shakes of cinnamon to the mix.  
Cooking it at 300 for an hour, it came out perfectly, with a nice crispy outter layer.  My kids and man LOVED it.   Thanks Mary, will be my "go to" recipe.

The time and/or oven temp must be wrong.  Though it tasted delicious, it was literally pie soup after several hours of cooling.  I placed it back in the oven at 350 for 30 more minutes, and it was more pie-like.

We used 4 cups of frozen peaches, and sprinkled the peaches generously with cinnamon. Tis was so friggen good. If I was on death row, my last meal would be Peach cobbler.......well.....sprinkled with bacon maybe. But anyway, it was only slightly runny, but it was probably due to my not being able to wait until it fully cooled to eat it! My wife used her pie crust handed down through her family and it was wonderful. Enjoy everybody!

This was great!  So quick and easy and so very yummy! I followed the instructions very closely, only using canned peaches, and then turning up the heat to 325 for 10 more minutes until the crust was golden.  It came out of the oven beautiful, and was fairly firm when cut into.  I did rinse and pat the peaches dry which probably helped prevent any bubbling over (I had none) and kept the pie from being too juicy.  Thanks Mary for this quick and super yummy dessert!

This pie was wonderful.  My husband and I loved it.  I did add 1/4 t. of cinnamon to the filling.  I also added a top crust with melted butter brushed on and a mixture of 1/4 c. sugar, 1/4 t. vanilla and a dash of cinnamon pressed on top.  I will say that before I baked the pie, I was skeptical about the oven temperature of 300...my pie was not done in 1 hour, it took 1 1/2 hours.  When I make this again, I will try increasing oven temperature to 350 and bake for 1 hour.

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would. It tasted fantastic! However, I did make the following changes to suite my taste more:
1/2 cup of sugar only
no vanilla

For the peaches, I used white peaches fresh from my peach tree which were succulent and sweet. 

The pie was baked first at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and then at 375 degrees for 45 minutes. The result tasted similar to that of Asian egg tarts but with the addition of many sweet peaches! I loved this recipe which is saying quite a lot considering I usually dislike pie! :)

Excellent pie, very light and creamy.  Was a hit at a block party. I used very firm peaches and had no problem with a runny pie.  The only change I made was to put a top crust.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will use over and over again.

This is now my husbands new favorite pie!  I used a bag of frozen peaches and accidentally used a 1/2 cup of butter than a 1/3 of a cup and it turned out really well.  I took the suggestion to cook for 15 minutes on 400 but I put it back to 300 degrees the rest of the time after about 10 minutes of the 400 degree temperature.  It set perfectly for me.  I might sprinkle the peaches with a little cinnamon next time.  There will definatly be a next time!

This is one of my favorite pie recipes! I get LOTS of compliments! It might be ok to use canned peaches and frozen pie crust, but ya gotta do it justice and take the extra step to make it with fresh peaches and a real crust!! It's definately worth the extra effort! I make it with a deeper dish and double the peaches -3 cups isn't very much. Place it on cookie sheet and anything that boils over won't make a mess in your oven. Looks pretty nice with a lattice top crust as well. Up the temp to 350 or so or it will take FOREVER too bake!

This was great!!!!  The only change I made was to use almond extract instead of vanilla and "that made the pie" said my husband.  The only reason I used almond was because I ran out of vanilla, but I will continue to use the almond from now on.

I made this pie with the peaches we got in Grand Junction Colorado! Those famous western slope peaches!! Anyway it was so good. I looked in every cookbook I had and finally decided on this recipe and I'm glad that I did. I made it for my family for our Labor Day Bar-B-Que and everyone loved it. Mom wants the recipe now. The only thing is that living at a high altitude I adjusted the temp and time. It still took awhile to get the top brown. I baked it at 350 for about and hour and 10 min. It was just perfect! YUMMY!!! And great with vanilla ice cream. I did put a little cinnamon on the top also.

This was The GREATEST peach cream pie I have EVER tasted. I have made alot of apple pies, strawberrie rhubarb pies in my life and my hubby has neverate 2 pices in one sitting but he did for the first time w/ this one! A+++ Thanks for sharing!!! I even used  7 cups of peaches to fill a 10 inch pie plate and a little over a cup of sugar and an extra blob of margerine, and it couldn't taste any better!

Wonderful and super easy recipe and we will use this as our standard for Peach Pie. The only change I made was I cooked it an extra 10 minutes at the end on 325 so that the crust would brown a little. This helped make it more solid so the pie didn't run like the others mentioned. Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe!

This pie is simple and delicious. I didn't change anything. A lot of people said they added cinnimon, but, even alone, the peaches make the pie very good. The only thing bad about this is it will not stay in pie form when it's warm. It spills out everywhere. I'm still looking for a regular peach pie recipie. This one is great, and very easy.

I made two of these pies last night... this was my first time making peach pie (although i'm not new to pie-making in general).  I would make this again with a few changes.  I would add cinnamon to the sugar/flour/butter mixture.  This time I sprinkled it on top but I think it belongs mixed up.  I did add an extra teaspoon of vanilla and I'd stick with that, too.  I cooked them at 350 for 1 hr and 15 mins... still, the crust on the bottom was soggy somehow, maybe it would be regardless because of the peach-juices.  I think i'd up the time in cooking to at least 1.5 hours... I guess I'll check out what other peach pies are cooking at.  The pie does have good taste.  A tad too much sugar .. i'd cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup next time.  Also a bit more instruction on how to (or even IF to ) peel the peaches would be nice.  I did peel them (dipping them in boiling water for about 20 seconds, then putting in cool water.. really did the trick).  One other thing... this is not your typical "peach pie" and to me more like a peach kugel, so if you're looking for a traditional peach pie look elsewhere.  Nevertheless it had a good taste amd like I said, I'll make this again with my changes.  Good luck.

EDIT:  I made this again, cut down the sugar, etc.  I don't think i'll be making this again.  It was STILL too sweet, and much too soupy.  I'm changing my stars from 4 to 3.  Sorry... will keep looking for a traditional and delicious pie!

Taking the reviews into consideration, I made it with 6 medium southern peaches, reduced sugar to 3/4 cup, and tossed the sliced peaches in 1/4 tsp cinnamon. I added a lattice crust, and brushed both the top and bottom crusts with beaten egg.  Baked at 400 for 15 minutes, then 375 for 45 minutes and it came out perfectly golden brown (and smelling fantastic). I popped the oven door open and let it cool for half an hour before taking it out. No runnyness at all. Great recipe!

This is a really easy, tasty pie, made it a few times now.  Recommend a deep dish pie pan if you have one.
I get good results with a graham cracker crust.
Agree with others on less sugar (as little as half cup would be fine) adding cinnamon and going at 325 F for one hour.  I usually end up adding about a 1/4 cup of cream to the mixture that pours over the peaches--makes the pie creamier and easier to spread the mix on the pie.  This pie, imo, is best eaten cold (like a mousse or cheesecake), so I put in the fridge for at least 4 hours before serving.

Other than slightly reducing the sugar, I followed this recipe exactly.  The peaches tasted ok, but the "cream" part was way too sweet and not creamy tasting at all.  I was very disappointed.

tasted good, but the mess it made was aweful. My smoke alarm went off when I took it out of the oven. Next time, I'll try mixing the peaches with the sugar mixture before putting it in the pie shell.

I did not care for this recipe. Ok, the flavor was ok (particularly with fresh peaches) and the prep was easy, but the mess this created in my oven, even with two sheets of aluminum foil under the pie, was horrible. The pie cooked for nearly an hour and a half and never got cooked in the center and the edges burned. My guests were kind enough to eat it without complaining, but I would not make this recipe again. Find another recipe.

Awesome!  I upped the oven temp to 325 for my altitude (5300 ft.) and still had to bake an extra ten minutes.  Added a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg on top of peaches before covering with topping.  Yum Yum!

Wow what a yummy mess!!! When I put the topping on the pie, I didnt think I had enough, so a doubled it...DO NOT do this! The topping speads and covers the pie, so the extra I made ended up on the baking sheet I'd put my pie plate on (a baking sheet is a must if making this pie!) I also baked 425 10 min and 350 50 min. Not soggy at all and topping was hardened and flavorful (w/cinnamon and extra vanilla). Used fresh farm peaches boiled and pealed. Thanks!!

Delicous.  My family loved this recipe.  The presentation before it was cut was great until I cut it.  It then looked like I was serving peach cobbler but nobody cared because the taste was wonderful.  Will make again.  Thanks

I made it with no changes and I would have given this recipe 5 stars except that it ran over and made a mess in my oven.  It was a very good pie but I think next time I will use a deep dish crust.

This turned out just fine, but as much as I love sweets, it was too sweet.  Maybe it was just the peaches I used, but I'll cut the sugar to 3/4c or less next time.  Also, I used 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla but I think it needs more, maybe 1T. Without it there's no "cream" taste, just sugary peaches.  I baked it for 1 hour at 350 as per suggestion, which was perfect.

I cut the sugar content by half as recommended by other Posters. Baked at 400 for 15 mins. and 375 for 40 min. Set very well.
I also used Almond flavoring instead of vanilla. Will opt for the vanilla next time. 
very tasty.

I used Pillsbury pie crusts. Followed ingredients in recipe exactly except cut back on sugar amount a little. Sprinkled a little cinnamon on the peaches. Brushed egg on bottom crust. Made top crust lattice. Baked 15 min at 450 then 45min at 350 I will make the pie again. Everyone made a point of saying how good the pie is.

Made crust using Joy of Cooking Flaky Crust recipe. Used a small amount of egg wash on crust before putting in 4 cups of peaches. Sprinkled peaches with cinnamon and then poured cream mixture. on top. Covered edges of crust with foil until pie had 15 minutes of cooking left and then took off while putting a streusel topping (also from joy of cooking) on top. Yum yum yum. Oh also cooked for 10 minutes at 400 before putting down to 325.

This pie was good, but not great.  I think it would be much improved by letting the peaches sit with some sugar and cinnamon and/or vanilla before hand, just to give the whole thing more flavor.  The texture and sweetness was fine for me, but if I make it again I'll add either more vanilla, cinnamon, or nutmeg... just something else to make it more special.

This is a good recipe. My boyfriend loved it but my 10 year old son didn't. I did make a few changes. I added cinnamon, I used a deep dish store bought crust and I baked at 350 for 1 hour. There was no spill and it came out pretty good. I will try it again.

This tasted good and it was easy.  I would recommend a top crust of some kind because it's not very attractive.

The pie was excellent, however I did have to cook it an additional 15 minutes, and somehow I think there was a little too much cream mixture because it boiled over all over inside my oven. Besides the mess, the pie was absolutely fantastic! And I will make it again, but I will not use all the cream mixture.

I found this to be an okay recipe, but it was missing something, and the "cream" part spilled over the top of the pan and I was left with mostly just the peaches in the actual pie, however I did not change the recipe a bit? hmmm..  tasty anyway, thanks!

I cut the sugar a bit and added cinnamon and more vanilla, as reviewers suggested. Even so, I found this pie good, but nothing special. It needs to be cooked on a higher temperature (15 minutes on 400 and 45 on 350) if you want it to be fully baked.

This recipe reminds me of the peach cobbler I had as a child.  This is very easy and so delicious.  We make very often at our house with canned peacheds.

Excellent pie!  I used more peaches than called for and did not have any problem.  No spill-overs (I used half very ripe peaches and half less ripe)  Thanks for the recipe.

This is not a pie I'd make again.  It's sweet and tasty, but I didn't like the mooshy consistency of the filling.  I did bake it for one hour at 350 degrees. I also did sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on top before baking it.  It's too much like a cobbler and too little like a pie.

All in all, this was a very good pie. The only thing I would have done differently was to add more vanilla to the recipe. I think it gives it a more distinct taste. I used a tablespoon and I think it still needed more. Of course that's just my two cents. Like I said, all in all, it was very good! I also used caned peaches instead of fresh, but I drained all the syrup so it wouldn't be too runny.

This is the best and easiest peach pie I have ever made! My family loves it!  I used a bought pie crust and a little extra sugar on the fresh peaches because they were a little tart.  I give this pie an A+!

I made this because it resembled one that my mother-in-law made decades ago.  This one was very similar and delicious!  It was a bit too sweet for my taste.  If I make it again, I will reduce the sugar to 1/2-3/4 cup.

I make this pie all the time. My mother years ago gave this recipe. You can also use apples but add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to mixture. My recipe is 350 degrees for one hour.I always use a baking sheet under my pies. ( I have a special pizza like pan with a whole in the center. Made to bake pies.) If using deep crust pie shell increase baking time to one hour fifteen minutes. Made this for a contest got first place.

I used the higher baking temperatures and had a boil over within 10 minutes of putting the pie in the oven.   Glad I had a cookie sheet under it as suggested.   I turned it down to the 300 degree temp and finished cooking it in an hour or so.
I used the streusel topping but thought it might be better if sprinkled on a little sooner than the last 20 minutes.    All that being said, everyone enjoyed  it and asked for the recipe....The only ingredients I added was a sprinkle of nutmeg and some cinnamon in the streusel, and a splash of bourbon in the egg batter.    I'll definitely make it again :)

Loved It!  I always use half stevia as sugar replacement and this worked really well with that change. Otherwise made as recipe stated. A new summer favorite for sure.

I followed the recipe closely. I think I would really prefer a traditional peach pie recipe. It seems to lack flavor. I used fresh peaches and it still seems bland.

This was great tasting; however  we decreased the sugar to 3/4c & it was still a little sweet for us.

Took this for dessert on Thanksgiving.  It was a home run.  Everyone loved it.  It could have been baked a little longer but the taste was fabulous.

Cut back on sugar, cooked 15 mins at 400.  Adding more peaches may result in overflow.

Great for a sweet pie you need to make in a pinch! I only used 3 peaches and I found it quite sweet.  I would use the full 3 cups of peaches next time. I also feel like something flavour wise is missing.  Reminds me for sure of the Quaker peaches n cream oatmeal pack flavour though.  Would make again for something different.

This recipe has to be altered so much in order to make this pie. I followed it exactly and within 10 minutes it was boiling over and burning in my oven. Ridiculous that all of these reviews have had to alter this one recipe in order for the pie to come out correctly. I don't normally use recipes and this will be the last one I ever use. I just had an abundance of peaches and thought this would be simple and easy.

Very good pie.  Per the reviews, I cut the sugar and added cinnamon.  Also added a struesel topping toward the end of the baking time.  Used a foil cover pizza pan to catch the overflow.   Nice and rich, good texture, and FINALLY got a peach pie that wasn't runny.   I really liked being able to spread the flour mixture over the top instead of mixing it in.  Will take the advice of another review and try this for other fruits.  DELICIOUS!

This was a great pie. I did revise it by adding 1 tsp almond extract and 1/4 tsp of immitation rum to the flour, sugar, and butter mixture. It came out great. my husband said it was the best peach pie he had ever tasted.

I have never made fresh peach pie so this was a first.  It turned out amazing and only lasted about 3 days!  I put it in the fridge to keep which made it even better!

This pie was great!  I made it to use up some peaches on my counter - husband and kids were thrilled.  They wanted to finish the whole thing on the spot.  Not too sweet, but I only used 3/4 cup sugar.  Also, baked at 350 for about an hour.  It was perfect- light & fruity!

Just plain delicious.  So easy, and a beautiful finished product.  LOVE the low cooking temp -- I accidentally baked my for about an extra 20 min. & just turned a lovely caramel brown on top.  Used about 3/4 cup sugar, and was just sweet enough.  My mom & grandma's peach pie recipe is now history ....

The only thing I didn't like about this pie was the top (though nicely browned) stayed sort of soggy. I baked it at 450 for 10 min.and 350 for 50 min as others suggested but will try it as the recipe suggests next time. I think a streusel topping would solve my problem but I don't have a good recipe. Any suggestions? I made mine with fresh frozen peaches (thawed) 3/4 c. sugar and cinnamon in the batter. The flavor is outstanding! One of my very favorite pies! TIP: definatly warm any leftover pies in the microwave for a few seconds..YUMMMM!

I thought this recipe was very tasty but I was disappointed with the consistency. I found the filling to be very runny. We ended up just scooping it out like cobbler instead of pie. But again, it did taste good.

I loved this recipe!  I took several of the suggestions and added a 1/2 tsp vanilla, some cinnamon, a crust on top and baked at 350 for 1 hour.  It was delicious.  I will definitely make this one again.

this recipe has potential.. and it did ultimately turn out good. However, like others i found 300 degrees was not enough. I strongly suggest that you do 350 for 1 hour. At 300 the pie was soupy and the crust not done. Believe it or not after baking it for 1 hour at 300, i threw it in the oven again for 45 minutes at 350 degrees! It came out set and browned...i then chilled it in the fridge a couple of hours(after cooling)yummy! served with ice cream, double yum!!! good luck!!

Sooooo delicious! I've made this pie twice now and the oven temp needs to be raised to 350 or the pie will be in there for two hours. I used a double pie crust instead of just the bottom because I love crust, and it turned out lovely.

very simple and good for my little son's breakfast, as it's loaded with fruit.

Good and creamy. Should have been way better if I had used fresh peaches, but they're not in season... Will try it this summer. Canned peaches are OK, but not really more. I spooned the dough on the top of the fruit and flatten it with a knife, the oven does the rest. Try it, for it's easy, quick and good (delicious if fresh fruits are used).

Very tasty.  I followed recipe exactly and it turned out a bit watery.  My brother and boyfriend loved it.  Probably great with vanilla ice cream!

Very easy to make.  Seemed to be a bit runny, but I tossed it in the fridge and it setup great.  I would make this again!

OK...now I know how to make three pies.  This one was excellent!!!!!!!  Have not decided....I may want to add some cinnamon next time.  Its very good just as it is.  The entire house smelled of peaches and vanilla!  My only tip....My crust turned out a little light on the bottom.  Try and not overfill the crust with peaches, that way you won't have overflow.  Then you can avoid putting a cookie sheet underneath to catch drippings.  Perhaps if I used a sheet of tin foil rather than the cookie sheet I might have gotten a darker crust?

I used 3 fresh peaches and sprinkled a little cinnamon on the top of them prior to adding the sugar and butter mixture. This is so easy and the taste was great. I couldn't believe it would come out so good with so little ingredients.

My husband and I made 3 of these for a work luncheon.  They were gone before lunch ever started.
