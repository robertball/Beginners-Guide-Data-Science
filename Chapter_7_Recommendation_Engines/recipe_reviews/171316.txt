Excellent! Very simple yet elegant, and tastes wonderful.  I love grilled peaches, and this is a great way of serving them.  I didn't use raspberry sauce or vanilla ice cream; just used strawberry sauce and strawberry ice cream bc of what I had on hand, but raspberry sauce would be delicious I'm sure. My peaches did take longer on the grill, but I put them on the top rack bc I was cooking chicken underneath.  A lovely dessert.  Thank you for the recipe!
