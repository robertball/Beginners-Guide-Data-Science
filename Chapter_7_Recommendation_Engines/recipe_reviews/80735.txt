With a few adjustments to suit my cooking habits and family's tastes this was easily a five-star recipe.  I doubled both the onion and garlic; omited the herb bundle; and added 1 cup of water into the soup, using non-instant rice which I also simply added into the pot THEN simmered for the 25 minutes. Perfect! My husband thought it was the best!

This is a good, easy recipe.  I added some heavy cream and little more flour to the broth for a creamier texture.  Good stuff!

A perfect soup for a cold day!    I omitted the thyme simply because I’m not a fan of it.  I chopped 1 TBSP of fresh parsley and added it to the soup; as opposed to making an herb bundle.  I had leftover chicken breasts from the night before.  I chopped up the chicken and added to the soup and simmered as called for.  I also had leftover rice, which I added to the soup once I turned the heat off.  The Old Bay Seasoning adds a delightful flavor and browning the flour beforehand makes for a wonderfully creamy soup without the floury taste.  The best recipe for cream of chicken soup I’ve yet to find, and sooooo… simple!  The recipe states that it serves 12.  I halved the recipe and it was only enough for one meal for my husband and me.  If you’re using this for a main course, as I did; you may want to increase the amount.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I made some tweeks with it after reading ALL of the previous reviews. This is a great base recipe, but we all have different tastes, so it bothers me when people cut down a recipe without making their personal adjustments to it. I made this last night for a Men's get together that is happening tonight. I doubled the recipe & made these adjustments: instead of chicken breasts, I got a roasted chicken from my local grocery and chopped all the meat up. I used 2 onions, 8 cloves of garlic (we like garlic). I used 6 cups chicken broth, 4 cups half/half, 2 cups heavy cream. I didn't use the spice bundle, instead just added 2 TBSP of dried parsley. Even though I doubled the recipe, I used only 1 1/2 cups of cooked rice. I also sprinkled in some of Paula Deen's "House Seasoning"...I always have that on hand. I did have to add a little bit of corn startch to thicken it up a bit...but the final product was PERFECT! I will definitely be making again. BTW, the longer it cooks on the stove, the better. Tonight I will be transfering it over to my crock pot to keep it warm.

This recipe is quite good but I like a little more exotic flavors. I used a whole large onion and added a chopped hot pepper and 1 tsp. curry powder to give it some zing.  I used cooked brown rice I had on hand instead of instant.  A little different but very, very yummy.

This was a very good recipe but like all recipes I put my own touches into it.  I had roasted a chicken the night before so I used the left over chicken from it.  I also added 1/2 white wine and cut down the milk 1/2 cup.  In place of 1 cup of broth I added the left over gravy from the night before that was chicken broth based.  I didn't have Old Bay so I used Emerill's chicken rub and about 1/2 tsp. of tarragon.  I also sauteed about 1/2 lb. baby portabellas and 1/2 matchstick carrots in TBS. of butter and added it with the rice and about 1/2 steamed peas.  Simmered it for 30 minutes, removed the bay leaf, added a little fresh ground sea salt and pepper to taste.  Absolutely delicious.  Very elegant soup, I felt like I could serve it at a dinner party.  I think fresh aspargus in season would be good in it too.  Thanks for sharing.

Easy and delicious!  Helpful hint:  sear the chicken first then add water to let the chicken cook through, and then use the chicken broth in the soup!  I ended up adding at least 1 cup extra broth to thin out the soup.  Used instant brown rice and it turned out great!!

my husband and i both really liked this recipe. i had to kinda wing it at the beginning because i chose to boil the chicken rather than cook it in the olive oil. i deviated slightly from the recipe by using dried spices (guess-timated the amounts), adding carrots and adding some cornstarch at the end to thicken it up. but it was still a really good recipe..i would definitely recommend it !

This makes for a good cream soup base.  I doubled the onion, added asparagus, and added the non-instant rice with the broth and 2% milk (one extra cup of broth).  I used one packet (.75 lb) of Schwan's roasted pulled chicken. I omitted the spice packet, but added a bay leaf and celery seed.  This simmered down to a very thick and creamy soup, which I thinned just a touch with leftover broth.  Hubby really liked the kick the Old Bay gave it.  This is my new go-to base for cream soups.  I'm looking forward to trying this out with different ingredients.

This was super easy to make. My 9 year old daughter loved it. My husband wants it a little thicker. Next time I will add some cream and more flour to thicken it. I loved using whole spices and bundling them. It gave the soup a good flavor without having to eat the spices.

5 stars for taste ... DELICIOUS (keep in mind I made mods due to my special-needs-diet)!! 4 for presentation (it's not very pretty). I changed it to make it SND friendly, as I am gluten-allergic & I eat paleo (keep your thyroid healthy, kids, if you don't want to end up like me). Hubby loved it, too! He came home tired & this quickly made his world a better place. 

1st mod: grapeseed oil over olive for its higher smoke point and lighter taste.

2nd mod: no flour. It's not a bisque; it doesn't need to be thick.

3rd mod: sub one can regular (NOT LITE) coconut milk instead of half/half. Coconut fat is super-healthy and easy to digest. Keep it in

4th mod: deglaze the pan with a generous pour of dry white wine after sauteeing vegetables & before adding the other liquid, because YUM! Cheap is fine (I use pinot at sprouts for 3/$10 & use about 1/3 bottle. Let the veggies soften in the wine at a simmer for a few mins)

5th mod: thinly sliced 2 white mushrooms & added to veggies when I added the wine

6th mod: Omitted bay leaf. Tossed thyme and parsley in loose and removed stems later. 

7th mod: Poured soup over rice (hubby eats rice, I don't). Made regular jasmine rice in rice cooker. We have greyhounds who eat rice nightly, so we always have rice in the cooker.

Fine-sliced green onion, grated carrot and fresh parsley for garnish improves the look. Paleo is no-dairy, but I believe in sauteeing onion and garlic in butter. Keep the butter. Defat leftovers before reheating. YUM

Definetly a good start for those who have never made this kind of soup before like myself. Tweaked the recipe a ton but I love to experiment. Doubled up the recipe and added prob 3 cups of flour cause I love thick soup. Also added celery cause I'm a celery junkie. Turned out really good. For those who don't know what kitchen twine is like me it's only a fancy kitchen term for string :) Had fun making this so I totally recommend it.

I used cooked brown rice, a whole sweet onion and added 1/2 of a finely chopped jalapeno to suit my tastes; I also omitted the flour - and besides reducing the milk to 12 oz. (I use canned milk when cooking) and adding a few ounces of cream cheese for richness - I pretty much kept this recipe intact.

The best cream of chicken rice soup ever. I was very easy to make. It took a little longer then the time stated but that might have been because I used bone in split breast instead of boneless. Also it was very thick so next time I will probably add more chicken broth then recommended. Will definitely make it again instead of regular chicken soup.

It was delicious. I was disappointed though because it didn't thicken as much as I thought it would. It was rather runny. I also have no clue what Old Bay Seasoning is & what would be comparable. My son did not like it. I think it would have been good to add some vegetables like celery & carrots, but for once I followed the recipe closely, even down to the shredded chicken breast.

I loved the recipe, but changed it to fit my own style, I used a Pt. of heavy whipping cream instead of milk, mixed with a thickening agent to the broth. After thickened with all the other ingredients, I added Gnocchi's to the cream mix, tastes like Olive Garden's Chicken & Gnocchi soup

Not bad.  I did make several changes though.  I didn't have chicken stock so I just used chicken bullion. I added chopped carrots, celery, and green beans and added a few extra spices. I basically just loosely followed the recipe and made changes as I felt like it or needed to due to lack of ingredients.  I also thought that this recipe was skimpy on serving sizes.  I added extra liquid and still it did not feed as many as it said it would.

I used the basic ingredients of this recipe to make a standard cream of chicken to use in other dishes. It turned out so well, I served the remainder as a meal.  I made without herbs and rice.

Really good, I made some changes based on earlier reviews.    I added 2 ribs of celery and 2 carrots with one large onion.   Also, increased flour to about 1/3c.  I didn't have fresh herbs, so used dried, and made some regular white rice to add.   I had to add chik stock as it sat, so keep extra.   I probably added 3 additional cups over the course of the afternoon.  Kids love it!

I'm not sure what everyone sees in this soup. Yes, it was easy, but very bland. I did stick to the exact recipe. It was very watery and really no taste at all. I tried adding a little cornstarch to thicken and some more spices to add flavor, but still I did not care for the soup at all. I expect cream soups to be thick with good creamy flavor. Will not make again

This recipe was great.  I had to substitute a few ingredients, but it turned out so well.  I used Uncle Bens Wild Rice microwavable pouch and dried minced onion.  I also added a few spices since I didn't have any Old Bay seasoning.  I will definitely be making this soup again.

This was great.  I had some changes.  Used leaks instead on onions so I had to add more garlic and doubles spices (used dry).  Because I used oat flour instead of all purpose I added some tapocia starch thinken it up a little.
Husband loved.

Great recipe, I had chicken marinated in Kraft Italian dressing so I cubed & seared it in a couple tbsp. of the dressing in the bottom of the pot. I made my own broth using chicken better than bouillon. Once the onion, garlic & flour mixture was ready I added my broth with 2 cups milk & 1 1/2 cups heavy cream along with the chicken, a couple tbsp. of butter & pepper to taste. I omitted the bundle of herbs since I used the Italian dressing & after simmering I added the rice (cooked in chicken broth) & my son & grand daughters added some freshly grated cheddar cheese to theirs.

Used a cut open bag of Success rice since I didn't have a box of Minute rice. Didn't cook it separately, since I wanted the starch to thicken the soup.  Also made it with leftover Thanksgiving turkey. So easy, so good - thanks for sharing your fast recipe!

My husband loved this.  I made it for him.  It really isn't my thing.  I made quite a bit of changes based on what I knew he would want .  I boiled the chicken and shredded it.  I upped the butter to 4 tablespoons and the flour to 6 tablespoons.  I used a whole onion and 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley.  I used 1/4 teaspoon of dried thyme, 2 cans of chicken broth, 1 1/2 cups of 2% milk and 1 1/2 cups of half and half.  I used leftover cooked regular rice instead of instant and upped the Old bay to 2 teaspoons.  I think the Old Bay saved this soup.

Tried out the recipe but didn't work out. Even with a slurry the soup didn't thicken.

OH my my my this soup is a really great starter recipe ! 
I use this as a base for about five or six favorites.  Substitute 
broccoli  or  mushrooms for the chicken.  I sometimes add ONE CUP of 
shredded cheddar, and sometimes i dont !  Very nice mixture of 
ingredients and spices.

I Had never tried a cream soup before . So this looked easy enough . Those who hate changes will not like this review - but I always use a recipe I find for a base and then add what I like and take out what I dont. I boiled 2 chicken legs with thigh att and then took the meat off . Added chicken bouillon , bay leaf , all spice , garlic minced , pepper and salt , celery & onion . let cook for a bit and then added my 3 cups of regular milk , instant rice ( all I had on hand ) a grated carrot and potato. Then thickened with a flour cold water mixture . Let cook for approx 10 min more and wow - it was perfect a nice thick hearty soup - not one that needs crackers . A meal in it self ! Will def be making again .
