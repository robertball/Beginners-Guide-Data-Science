Hi everyone ... this is my recipe.  The sauce is not supposed to be thick, but if you like it that way you can add a little cornstarch mixed with cold water, or make a roux (flour and butter).  Also I use thin chicken breast cutlets not tenderloins (the allrecipes staff changed my recipe to tenderloins).  Thanks for all the nice compliments - I am glad most of you liked this!

My family and I loved receipe.  I just made a small change the second time I made it. I used unmarinated artichokes. (I found the canned worked better than the frozen ones.Frozen artichokes were too tough) Be sure to rinse and drain artichokes well before adding to receipe. When I added cooked chicken back to pan I simmered longer than just a few minute so the sauce really thicker.  Can't wait to make for company!

Very good and so easy to make.  I cut the chicken into chunks and added 1/4 cup sundried tomatoes and a 1/4 white wine. Served it over Jasmine rice - a great meal to make after work.

Fantastic - This is a great recipe.  Restaurant Quality.  If you thought the liquid was too thin, you didn't reduce it enough.  I used a small jar of artichokes in oil and drained it.  Added a large hand full of capers (always rinse under water and pat dry in a towel as they tend to be salty) and let the artichokes & capers blend with the broth until all was reduced to 1/2; returned the chicken to the sauce let that combine for 10 minutes or so and it was great.  Nice recipe - a keeper for sure.  One to impress guests

Just made this dish for my husband, and he gave it great reviews! It was a simple dish, easy to make with ingredients I had on hand. Will definitely make this again and no need to tweak it...it's perfect!

Holy cow, this is delish!!! I'm not going to lie, I was a bit skeptical about how this was going to turn out, but I am SO glad I tried it! I did thicken the sauce a bit using flour and butter, but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. So yummy!!!

This recipe was good will make again with a few changes. 1. Instead of chicken stock I will use white wine. Also as with other reviews I added sun-dried tomoatoes it really brings the dish together. Also I didn't bread the chicken it was late and I just wanted to get dinner done. I really don't think it hurt the dish.

Easy & good. I drained my artichoke hearts on a paper towel since some said it infused an off flavor. Capers & artichokes are an acquired taste if you ask me. I did have to dip the butter in flour because my sauce wouldn't thicken. Served over egg noodles & it was a very tasty, satisfying lunch. Thanks!

It was delicious. I did make a few small changes tho. I reduced the chicken broth to 1 cup and substituted a cup moscato wine for the 2nd cup, and used half olive oil and half butter to saute the chicken.

mega yum! Just made this for my boyfriend and he's starting to think I have a clue in the kitchen.  I made it as it is here and served over orzo mixed with a little fresh lemon juice.  

I'm not sure if I messed up a bit on it, though, since the sauce was not thick at all.  I split the recipe for 3 servings, and I may have accidentally used too much broth.  I'm definitely making this again and paying better attention next time.

Hubby and I absolutely loved this dish Pina! I made this recipe as stated with the addition of a bit of garlic powder to the sauce and after one bite decided this one was a keeper for sure! This was quick and easy for any night of the week yet I consider this company worthy. Next time I'll warm up some Italian bread to mop up more of that wonderful sauce!! Thank you so much!

This was excellent!  Followed as written, added extra lemon (because I love the flavor) and at the end, to thicken up a bit, added 1/4 cup mozzarello and 1/4 cup parmesan.  Could add more to make it thicker.  Wonderful!

I sautéed shallot and garlic after taking out the chicken and then added some flour and cooked for about a minute. Then I added the wine and that helped thicken the sauce and added tons of flavor. Rave reviews! The key is to rinse the canned artichoke and jarred capers really well.

I did make this cutlet as we love thin sliced cutlets.  I used plain artichokes from the can as i dont like the marinated ones.   It was very goo and i also rinsed off the capers.  thanks for a good recipe.

my little family loved this.  i followed the recipe exactly as written using wheat flour.  i thought the flavor was nice but the sauce did not thicken up as i expected it to. still, i would make again with some corn starch standing by and without the butter at the end.  i served it with jasmine rice and steamed veggies.  tasty, easy, light meal, fairly healthy to boot!

This was great as is, flavorful and easy.  I added chopped red pepper with the artichokes not because it needed it, just personal preference.  I will try to add more flour to the pan after taking the chicken out or letting sauce reduce further to see if I can get the sauce a little thicker. Thanks Pina for a fabulous recipe will make again.

This was really tasty! I added in some sauted red onion, used frozen artichokes,  and at the end, added a bit of milk to make a creamy sauce. next tiem I think I'll dice the chicken up instead of leaving it in large pieces. I served this over whole wheat couscous and really enjoyed my meal.

Made this as written and found that the artichokes broke up a lot in the sauce as it reduced.  Second time I added them and the capers with the Chicken. It made for a much prettier plate of food and didn't change the flavor.  I do make this with half the called for salt.  Family member has had a heart attack and we really cut back on cooking with salt.  It's surprising how quickly you can become accustomed to you food tasting like itself not like a salty potato chip.

Amazing!  Just finished cleaning up after dinner had to let everyone know how wonderful this.  Added thinly sliced fresh mushrooms near the end.  I loved how easy it was to make.  I will be making this again.  Put right into my recipe favs.

Next time I would skip dredging the chicken with the flour mixture & just season the chicken with S&P and a little bit of tarragon.  I sauteed 2 garlic cloves in the beginning & added 1/2cp of white wine in with the chicken broth.  I thought this added alot of flavor. I only used half the artichoke marinade to keep it from going sour.  Next time I would add at least one shallot & a cup of mushrooms for more flavor but everyone said they enjoyed it the way it came out. Mushrooms would be a very nice addition to this sauce.

I have made this several times. both by following the recipe as written and making changes. Equally as good either way. Tonight I added a shallot some garlic, a splash of Marsala wine, and mushrooms. thickened the sauce a bit and served it over rice

I love this recipe!  I made it for my husband and he loved it too.  I cooked the cultlets in butter and also added some white wine.  Finished it up by adding some corn starch to thicken it up.  Put it all over some angle hair pasta and it was amazing.  Would definately make it again and share it with a friend.

Not sure what I was expecting, but it was good. Think I will drain the artichokes next time. Hubby said it tasted to 'artichokey', but he ate a good portion. I love artichokes and capers in most dishes, so will try reducing the artichoke liquid next time. Will try again, thanks for submitting the recipe!

This recipe is excellent!  When watching carbohydrates, I eliminate the flour and simply use the salt & black & white pepper seasoning as a rub directly on the chicken taking care not to make it too salty.  I only whisk in one little butter pat to cut down saturated fat.  I find most of the flavor comes from the marinated artichoke quarters anyway.  I've cooked my version and the original version for company and either way everyone loves this chicken.

This is a sensational recipe! The 2nd time I prepared it - i doubled on the lemon juice (fresh squeezed) - used half of the capers and doubled on artichoke hearts. I served it with Rigatoni. Very easy to prepare and the blending of flavours exquisite. I only cut back on the capers because they are salty!!! The third time I prepared I used chicken thighs - they worked well also. Thank you Pina!!!!!

This is one of those dishes I found by using the ingredient search because I didn't want to leave my house.  It uses fine tasting items, and served over capellini, it makes a very satisfying meal.  I especially loved it heated up for lunch the next day!  It's one of those recipes that you can easily change by your choice of what to serve it over.

Very easy dinner!  I added a bit more lemon and left out the butter.  The butter would have made it HEAVENLY!  Gotta watch the old waistline though!  :)  This dish doesn't look as easy as it actually is!

This recipe resembles a delicious chicken piccata recipe that I like, but this one is simpler. I have made it exactly as written and I love it. It is good served with orzo pasta or basmati rice. I'm sure spaghetti pasta would be good too. What I love about this recipe is that it is simple and relatively quick to make and almost all ingredients are easy to keep on hand with the exception of the parsley which I leave out sometimes. I've made this multiple times and have loved it each time. Thanks so much for sharing!

Great quick dish but too many capers for my taste.  Next time I'll only use a Tbsp or 2 at the most.   Goes great with sweet potatoes.

Excellent! Added some garlic powder and paprika to the flour. Pounded the cutlets for tenderness. Drained the artichokes. Used some corn starch to thicken the sauce. Put in fresh parsley. So delicious and so easy.

Love the flavors.  I use regular chicken breasts instead of the tenders since they're always cheaper.   Pound the chicken between sheets of plastic wrap to at least 1/2", cut into a few pieces, and cook in a couple batches.  I find the pounding tenderizes the meat, and greatly improves the dish.  Transfer to a pan in the oven to keep warm.  Also, skip the salt in the flour mix.  Plenty of salt in the capers and artichokes.  If you want a thickened sauce, pour a little bit of the chicken broth into a small tupperware before adding it to the pan, add some of the leftover flour from the dredging (hey why waste it all?), close tightly, shake well and add to boiling sauce while stirring.

Hands down, this is one of the best recipes on AllRecipes. A total tip of the hat!

Excellent recipe. Bight and flavorful - really pretty on the plate as well. As others recommended, I subbed 1/2 cup white wine for 1/2 cup of the chicken broth. Served with roasted broccoli. Fantastic meal.

Super simple recipe with a big payoff. Wife and I both loved this and we will be making it again... tonight in fact. 

Intentional and Accidental Changes:
- We used canned artichoke hearts in water instead of marinated because I purchased those by mistake. 
- We heavily seasoned our chicken but skipped the flour.
- We added jarred sun-dried tomatoes because others mentioned  adding them to the recipe  (great flavor compliment to the capers and artichokes). 
- We made a small amount of roux to thicken the sauce but I don't think it needed it. 
- The chicken cutlets made for beautiful presentation but next time I'm just going to cube some chicken breast instead. 

Even with these changes it was fantastic over rice. We're going to try it over quinoa this evening. Thanks for the recipe!

This was amazing. Everyone loved it. I did drain the artichoke before adding and that I think made the flavor  better but less sauce so people were fighting over it.

I used only a pound of chicken so I reduced the broth and flour by half but kept everything else the same. Served with rice and a salad.

Excellent as written! Followed directions exactly except didn't whisk butter into sauce, only because I forgot- but honestly I can't see that it needed it at all!  I added a tiny bit of cornstarch in water to the sauce before adding the chicken just because we prefer a thicker sauce and salted it to taste. (Probably not necessary, but we like salty) I let chicken simmer in sauce for a good 10 minutes. Makes a slightly tangy, delicate sauce and juicy succulent chicken. My family loved it!

This is quite tasty.  Thinly sliced 3 chicken breast halves; seasoned them with the peppers and salt.  Put Kamut flour in large baggie, added the seasoned chicken slices and shook to coat.  Heated olive and butter (no canola), browned and removed the chicken - had about 3 batches. To the heated chicken broth, added a handful or more sun dried tomatoes.  Did not have lemon so used two limes.  Drained the artichokes and capers while cooking chicken. Cooked as directed from that point, except to add the chicken back about 10 minutes before serving and adding about half cup half and half  near the end for a creamy consistency.  Served over steamed zoodles.  Thanks for sharing what turned out as the beginnings of a great idea!

Basic GREAT recipe.  I usually improv on many recipes.. but this is a good basic one to launch from.  Added sliced leek , red bell pepper  to the capers and artichokes (cause I needed to use them up from my fridge) added a little white wine to stock while reducing.  When done, poured whole skillet over platter of farfalle pasta (cause I had it!) Only thing I had to get from store was chicken and artichokes (which btw .. I used non marinated quarters) Came out Dee-li- chious!

This was SO easy and quick! We LOVED it exactly the way it was - used 3 chicken breasts cit into cutlet size. Served it over egg noodles and had enough left over for 3 lunches! I recommend this recipe to anyone in a hurry for some great food!

Both my husband and I love cabbage so this was the best recipe. I did add rotisserie chicken to the recipe which made it a great dinner all by itself. Next time going to try pork.

I loved it!  My comments were, "If I were served this in a restaurant I would be so pleased!"  I did add some flour with the butter to thicken. Otherwise followed the recipe.

Simple and yummy.  Served it with pasta,  I did adda little flour to thicken the sauce after reading the reviews, but other than that followed the recipe perfectly.  Might have wanted to add an extra cup of broth so that there was more sauce.

We really enjoyed this easy to make and refreshing dish.  I added a tablespoon of heavy cream during the simmering/reducing phase and it was just enough to mellow out the capers and lemon juice.  Served it with Angel Hair pasta and veggie.

Made this almost as written.  I didn't have the full amount of chicken, so I added some mushrooms which I sauteed with the chicken toward the end of cook time.  I did make a slurry of corn starch and water, but that didn't affect the taste at all.  Served over spaghetti.  I think the next time I make, I'm going to cut chicken tenders into chunks and keep the mushrooms.

This was a keeper! Presentation was definitely company worthy, not difficult to make & tasted wonderful! A great recipe! The only changes I made were using grilled, non-marinated artichoke  hearts & replaced the liquid with my own Scuppernong wine, & cilantro in place of the parsley & only 1 pound of chicken breasts as it's only my husband & I. We both LOVED it! I served it over whole wheat spegetti & would use a different pasta because the spegetti kept sliding off the fork & spoon! The sauce doesn't need thickening at all.

This is a great little recipe. I made this today for my husband and I and because there was only the two of us....I halved the recipe exactly. I made no other alterations and the recipe was perfect as is. I served it over Basmati rice with green beans and salad.  I will definitely make this again. I would not hesitate to make this for company and perhaps serve over a home made noodle. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent recipe!!!!! Could give you easily another 3 stars
I used only one cup strong home made chicken broth and one cup white wine and kept the chicken breast whole.
This recipe has  lot potential to variations.

Thank you

Easily one of my favorite recipes - the only alteration I make is to add extra white pepper, lemon, and capers...cause well, I can :)

Definitely one of my top three delicious "go-to" recipes.

Excellent!  I made it with the broth for the kids and they loved it.  Chicken turned out tender.  I skipped the canola oil and browned the chicken in olive oil plus 2 T butter, then added another tablespoon of butter at the end.  I am planning to make this for a dinner party with white wine for part of the broth.

This was fantastic!  I didn't use any flour but added some cornstarch near the end to thicken it.  Also added a bit of white wine to deglase the pan and I used canned artichokes instead of marinated.

I'm generally a harsh critic...but this one was great.  I did add a little shake or two of flour on the second simmering of artich. and capers, but it only thickened it a little and surprisingly I liked it thin!

I really like this recipe.  I always make mine a little saucier (more butter and I put a cup of white wine in with the broth), and I also use bone-in cuts of meat, just because that's what we like.  But everything else I make exactly the same and it's wonderful.

I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could.  It was very good, and the whole family liked it.  I made a double batch because I had a lot of chicken breasts to cook, and it took a long time to brown all the chicken, and some of it started to burn in the pan.  I wouldn't double this recipe again.  I added a few mushrooms since I had them (even more would have been better) and some steamed cauliflower at the end, which blended very well.  Served over brown rice with salad.  Good dinner.

I did drain the artichokes and rinsed them because I have experienced the off taste before. The sauce thickened nicely once it was reduced and the butter whisked in. Everything worked just fine, BUT I decided to add more lemon than it called for. This probably wouldnt have been a bad decision, BUT I did this prior to the reducing. Therefore, the lemon flavor was intensified. It was pure lemon. That's all you tasted. I dont think it's the recipe's fault though.

This was very good, perhaps the sauce could use a little more butter. If you like this, try Chicken with Lemon Caper Sauce, also on this site. It is to die for.

We really enjoyed the flavor of this dish!  I let the sauce reduce too much, and was bummed about that, but that was my fault.  I wanted enough sauce to pour a little over our angel hair pasta and that didn't happen.  Next time I'll add another cup of broth before reducing to half.  I'll also dice up the chicken, throw it into the sauce and toss with pasta or rice.  Can't wait to make this again!

DELICIOUS! I used chicken cutlets pounded down to 1" and substituted dried parsley for fresh. I also omitted white pepper as I didn't have any on hand. I served the chicken on top of white rice and poured the remaining juices from the pan on top of both. The melding of the flavors was incredible. This one is a keeper - thank you for sharing.

It's a great and simple recipe to make especially during the week.  My husband and I (and now our teenage son) love chicken piccata so this is definitely up our ally.  Thanks for sharing!

Followed recipe but sauted onion and garlic first and fried the chicken with those. Also, I added diced marinated Greek olives and peperoncini to the mix and served over linguine noodles. Unbelievably delicious!!!

This dish was great and easy to prepare.  I had all the ingredients on hand.  The chicken comes out very tender, especially after the last step of simmering the chicken in the artichoke broth.  I did add a small amount of extra salt for more taste.  Great dish.

This recipe was easy to make, delicious as dinner and awesome lunch to bring to work today. (Amazing leftovers)! I served this over a bed of quinoa seasoned with shallots, parsley and Thai basil. The first response at dinner from my husband was, "This recipe is a keeper".

I loved this! I adjusted seasonings because I only had 1.25 lbs of cutlets. I used almond flour instead of wheat or white flour. I dumped in the jarred artichokes with the oil and added the rinsed capers. No need for the parsley--I didn't have fresh anyway. Used low-sodium chicken broth. Yum!

Loved this recipe, it'll be one of my regulars.  Pounded out the breasts to ensure easy cooking, added a little corn starch to thinken the reduction after 30 minutes of simmering. Served over angelhair for the starch.

Yes however lighten up on the capers and lemon juice. A bit too tangy. Thickens nicely with additional time. Nice over Pasta.

Outstanding.  Tip: amp up the lemon by adding the zest of the lemon that you squeeze to make the lemon juice.  This will definitely be a frequent dinner for our family from now on.

This was excellent. Changed very little other than using olive oil and butter, but no canola oil. Also, I used a little of my own chicken stock or could use a little vegetable stock because I don’t care for canned anything. 

It was simple and delicious!

Made with 4 rounds of pounded chicken breasts. (Three full breasts in Bell and Evans organic. Cut breasts through lengthwise. Pounded. 3 minutes per side. Second addition of canola oil needed after two batches.) 1 cup chicken broth instead of two and added 1/3 cup white wine. Lemon slices added at time of artichokes. Served over thin spaghetti. Everything else same.

This was easy and had a great flavor, but mine turned out somewhat greasy. I'm sure it's my error.  I used two large chicken breasts, sliced into cutlets. I did not have canola oil, so I used vegetable oil in its place. And I used whole wheat flour. I was disappointed the chicken lacked crispness. I served it with thin spaghetti.  Wonder if the vegetable oil and wheat flour were the culprits? Or was it the marinated artichokes?

I eliminated as much of the oil as I could when frying the chicken. Next time I will try baking it. This dish has amazing flavor but cutting back on the oil will save a few calories.

I cut the recipe in half for 2 people, and it was wonderful.  We ate it all!  Next time I will add more chicken stock to make more sauce.

This was excellent.  Lots of flavor, makes your taste-buds come alive.  I used breast cutlets rather than the tenders.  Definitely a repeat.

I made this recipe for dinner yesterday and it was GREAT. A perfect blend of flavors and I served it over angel hair pasta with garlic knots and salad.  My husband ate 3 servings and I had 2. I plan to incorporate it at least monthly into my menu planning.

Huge hit with my family!  I’m sure it’s fine as is but I took liberties anyway.  Added cooked bacon, garlic, and the previously recommended sun dried tomatoes before I added the chicken broth and lemon juice.  I also served over egg noodles (mixed with parsley) like a previous commenter did.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Delicious! I wanted to make it low carb so I added veggies and didn't serve it with pasta or rice.  I added mushrooms and sundried tomatoes.  The tomatoes over powered the lemon taste so I think I'll skip those next time but will definitely make this again.

I made the recipe using  2 boneless breasts I cut into tenderloins. Other than that, everything was the same. Loved it! Husband and daughter really liked as well. We love lemon chicken and chicken piccata and this has a lot of the same ingredients. A keeper!

This was good, but definitely needed flour to thicken up the sauce.  It was very runny otherwise.

Excellent recipe.  I know a lot of people who review the recipes don't like it when others change the basic recipe, but I believe in expressing individual tastes.  The basic recipe would have been fabulous, but I added some minced garlic, 2 Tbsp. white wine and some sliced mushrooms.  Creativity creates the best cooks.

Everyone liked this one! I added sun dried tomatoes as others suggested, and it went very well and added color to the dish. Not hard to make and will definitely make again.  We served it on rice; add a side dish of asparagus and fresh bread and you've got a great meal for company. Thanks!

I made this the other night and it was fabulous!  The only thing I changed,  was that I added about 1/2 cup white wine to the pan before the chicken stock.  It just gave a little more depth of flavor.  Definitely will make it again.

Will use low sodium chicken stock or broth next time.

My whole family loved it!. It tastes similar to Picatta. The only thing that I would change would be to increase the amount of sauce. We were licking the pan. Definite repeat.

This recipe was a real hit! I didn't have marinated artichokes so I used water packed canned artichoke hearts and  marinated them in an olive oil and vinegar salad dressing I had in the refrigerator. I also used bottled lemon juice which was fine, but I will use fresh the next time I make this dish. Delicious, quick and easy after a long day.

More likely my fault !! I use thin chicken cutlets and did not cook them in the sauce . The sauce had plenty of flavor a little watery, but then again I did not cook  with breast .. Will give it another go in the near future. Hopefully they will let me review this meal again and I will be able to kick up the stars...

I made this recipe for guests and everyone liked it.  It should be paired with rice, pasta or mashed potatoes so you can get every bit of the wonderful sauce which I thickened with a roux of flour and butter as the submitter suggested.  I'll definitely make it again.

It was good the 1st time but delicious w  changes. I found it to be too salty so I cut the salt out of the flour mixture. I like crisper veggies so I used plain artichoke  hearts in a can instead of marinated. Substituted 1/2 cup of the broth with wine and served over farro. Very good and easy

Considering that I like artichokes and capers, I really liked this recipe.   I did thicken the sauce with a cornstarch and water mixture as suggested by other reviewers.  I also omitted the butter, and it still tasted great!

This was very good. I did add garlic powder and white wine as other reviewers recommended. I also added pasta to the chicken and sauce near the end and the pasta was so good! My husband really liked it and I will make it again.

Love this will definitely make it again my husband loves capers always looking for Mediterranean type dishes like this    I did substitute some good dry Pinot Grigio for half of the chicken broth     I also served it on top of egg noodles I think it would be great on any kind of pasta.  I failed to notice you were supposed to take the chicken out before you made the sauce so I left mine in the whole time I use tenderloins and they turned out fantastic regardless. I cook a lot I should've picked up on this but ultimately didn't matter I also think this would be good with shrimp love the dish definitely will make it again you should make it !!!

Like Charlotte, I used un-marinated artichokes. Added dried shallots and a bit of Italian seasoning. And did I use chicken tenders with panko breaking. I'll definitely make this again.

One thing I wanted to comment on this recipe, you don't have to necessarily use chicken strips of white meat as you can also do this with cut up chicken thighs. Chicken has gotten expensive so you have to start using other cuts than just wings and breasts.

This was simply amazing- my hubby who is super picky- raved about it. The only hung I do differently was to use seasoned breadcrumbs- and once chicken was cooked - add flour and water to thicken the sauce as it simmered. He actually raved about it which is rare praise for a man who doesn't like to eat anything other than sweets and fast food!

I used to small chicken cutlets and this definitely made a difference. I wound up burning the oil because it went for so long. I'd say the size needed is around half that of a chicken breast, and Definitely do Light brown, be careful of burning. This was a pretty good dish that had plenty of flavor but not the best(may have something to do on my part).

This was very good!  Here are my minor changes.  First, you only need 1/2 cup flour, at most.  You're shaking most of it off.  I didn't use marinated artichoke hearts because I was trying to keep this healthier.  So just artichoke hearts in water, salt and vinegar.  And although I intended to use some butter at the end, I forgot!  It was still delicious!

Perfect on a cool fall/winter day! I did add a red onion to the broth and thickened with cornstarch (my husband prefers thick broth) Also threw in a few left over tortellini.

This was delicious! I did not include the artichoke liquid, and added a bit of flour to the sauce and cooked a bit longer to thicken it. I thought I would have leftovers but the family devoured it!

I made this with veal cut in bite size pieces instead of chicken so I did not have to cook it very long. I also added some mushrooms, peas and garlic,  just because.  I used 1 C of chicken broth and 1 C of white wine.  The sauce did thicken but it is very easy to add a little more wine to get the consistency that you like.  I served this with spaghetti squash.  This will be a go to  menu item.

Ok is the sauce supposed to come out like soup? I followed the recipe exactly as written and it came out like soup? On the bright side is made for a very juicy chicken and was bursting with flavour. I just marinated the chicken in the broth and then transferred to a platter and drizzled some broth over top. Id make it again was pretty easy to make and was yummy.

Not bad at all. Unique flavor blend , light lemon pepper wit h hint of tartness from artichoke hearts. Good easy dish. Next time i may try adding garlic for a more robust flavor. But this is good as it is.

I made this as written.  The only problem was it was way to salty.  Next time I will rinse the capers off. I threw a potato in to help eliminate some of the saltiness .  I also added some sour cream to also cut the salt.   I will make this again with the changes.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was YUMMY! I followed the recipe almost exactly, using whole wheat flour to coat the chicken. The only thing I did different was I added some sun dried tomatoes (a really good call). I served with Ronzoni SuperGreens thin spaghetti. It was easy and delicious!!  My husband and kids loved it and it's tasty and elegant enough to make for guests.

Easy, quick recipe with basic ingredients. I used chicken breast that I cut up into bite size pieces and served it with pasta. If you want less sour, rinse the capers and marinated artichokes. The sauce came out perfect for me.

This was very good!  It looked beautiful!  I used Whole wheat flour which I loved it stayed on the chicken and it gave the chicken a beautiful color I also used Canola oil.  I bought the wrong size jar of Artichokes so did not have enough but I really liked this dish I will make it again!

All six of us at the table loved this super tasty dish.  The chicken was a little dry and I'm thinking it might be because I didn't bread them.  I will do that the next time.  I served it with a pea salad.  The flavors complemented each other very nicely.

the sauce is wayyyy too plain. it needs cream or something. the chicken tasted good but the flavors in this recipe just seemed... meh. if i did make it again i would deff make it into a cream based sauce and put capers on it after it was done- cooking capers made them taste different.

I've made this and the one thing I definitely recommend is adding white wine after browning the dredged chicken. Definitely dredge the well seasoned chicken. It's still yummy with rice, noodles, any kind of potato. My family loves it.

Oh so tasty! I did find it a bit too lemony for my taste, but it was still excellent and so easy to make! I didn't change a thing. Will definitely be making this again, but I may try adding some sauteed mushrooms.

My husband and son love this that is all that matters. I didn't care for the lemon juice and juice from the artichokes. I think only the lemon juice should be used as the packed artichoke liquid is oily and seasoned adding that to me gives it more of a twang taste.

Love this dish!  I just finished cooking it and so I did a taste test.  Wow, its delicious!  Used the juice of 2 lemons, 2 cans of unmarinated artichokes, seasoned salt and a little more broth than what was in the recipe.  Also used 12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs so there is plenty of leftovers.  I can hardly wait for dinner!

This was awesome!  I doubled the recipe but didn't double the amount of lemon juice.  I added a hand full of spinach and some mushrooms.  We grilled the chicken rather than pan frying for a more healthy fare.  The flavor was wonderful.

AMAZING. I made this two days in a row! Once at a friend's house and another at my own with some variations based on our respective pantries and preferences. Works great as written as well as a base to experiment a little.

With the lemon juice, capers and liquid from the artichoke jar, this dish can be quite acidic.  Perhaps for some that's the goal.  I rinsed the capers and agree with Charlotte to use unmarinated artichokes.  I also thickened the sauce and added some cream of chicken soup along with garlic, a tablespoon or so of chili peppers, and some peas and sun dried tomatoes for color.  I paid much more for the artichokes that I did for the chicken, nonetheless would argue for using far more artichokes than the  recipe calls for, perhaps a 3:2 ratio of chicken to artichokes.   With all that preparation I doubled the recipe to make it worth the time.

Very similar to chicken picatta except with the addition of 
The marinated artichokes. I adjusted the amount of capers, as my family loves them and used slightly pounded chicken tenderloins. Great as is, but I like to add some white wine to most of my chicken recipes. Thank You for Sharing.

This is good, but the quality depends on the artichokes you buy. The ones I had were not stellar, but the dish over all was tasty. Needs more color, maybe add spinach and sun dried tomatoes next time.

Great recipe, I added sun dried tomato's and a healthy splash of pinot grigio. I also doubled the butter, increased the amount of capers and used cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I will be making this again.

I couldn't believe how easy, quick and good this was.  I did half chicken broth and half white table wine, added a little garlic of course.  Delicious.  Keeping this one in the recipe book.

This was such a hit at my dinner party ! The only things I changed were I cut chicken I to chunks before cooking  and also sauté  the artichokes ( I used canned whole artichokes - not marinated ) with a bit of butter .  When slightly browned , I added capers and about.1/2 cup white wine mixed with 1/2  of chicken broth and about 3 T cornstarch as we like thicker sauce. Then I added the cooked chicken back into the artichoke mixture and simmered about 3 minutes.  I served the chicken - artichoke & wine mixture over cooked rigatoni pasta  with grated Parmesan cheese on the side .

It was a really great dish and really easy. I read the reviews so all I changed up was 1 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup of white wine. My boyfriend and I loved it!! Will be making it again.

Too much lemon juice, so it was too tart and sour for my wife. Reduce lemon to less than a tablespoon next time. Also, presumably the author of this recipe forgot to mention thickening the gravy: add a tablespoon of flour to the the oil and caramelized bits and make a roux before adding the chicken broth with the tablespoon of lemon juice (or less).

I also used unmarinated , well drained artichokes. Also added a bit of garlic prior to sautéing chicken and added  some white wine. Used a touch of flour at the end mixed in T of broth to thicken sauce a bit. Because I used unmarinated artichokes, at the end it needed a bit more S and P, some chopped fresh organo and thyme. Also could add at the end  sundried tomatoes, or even grape tomatoes fresh from the garden for additional flavor and color.

I made this recipe as written, and hubby and I both enjoyed it!  I may have reduced the sauce to far, but it still looked like a lot left in the pan.  But after adding all the chicken back in, the meat must soak it up!  I used frozen chicken breasts, cut into tenderloin strips and served over rice.

This was a hit. I think using whole wheat flour gave it an extra something.  I also used sundries tomatoes and  served over rice. I will be making this again.

Wonderful recipe! I'd give it more stars if I could.  It felt like a gourmet meal eating out in a fancy restaurant.  Since I'm diabetic and also gluten free, I needed to lower the carbs so I did not use flour.  I lightly sprinkled with arrowroot powder, salt, and pepper, rather than dredging the chicken in it.  I also added lots of minced garlic, which I love in just about anything.  I served this over "zoodles" made with a vegetable peeler peeling noodles from zucchini.  I microwaved the zoodles for a couple minutes before topping with the chicken.  So good!

I made it, but cut in half.  I wanted to use what I had on hand, which was canned artichoke hearts (I had "cornered the market,"as my husband says, when they were on sale and had several cans).  I already had everything else.  Added chopped sundried tomatoes and a few sliced mushrooms that were needing to be used.   Used a little more OO as didn't have any marinade from the artichokes, and used a tad of the oil from the sundried toms.  Tasted good, but not quite there, until added the butter - two Tbs and it turned silky and wonderful. Then took shears and clipped the sauteed tenders into bite side and it was heaven, and oh, so pretty.  A definite winner in my book!
I added a picture of my dish in the skillet.  It looks quite different from the others which show a lot of sauce.  I served it over bowtie pasta.

Why do they show chicken legs for this recipe and yet in the recipe itself it says use chicken tenders?
The picture of the chicken legs looks yummy - the other picture with the chicken tenders looks like mushy!

LOVED this!

I used gluten free rice flour since i was out of the All Purpose and it worked great!  I thickened it some with a heaping tbl of leftover seasoned flour and water - this will be a staple recipe from now on!

Delicious! The whole family loved it. To thicken the sauce a little, I made a rue. I didn't have artichoke hearts so I substituted them with hearts of palm. Will definitely make it again!

We loved this... I did not alter the recipe (other than sprinkling some cornstarch prior to adding the chicken back in) and it was a perfect and very easy meal. We served it over a bed of wold rice and a side of artichoke with hollandaise sauce. Lovely! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. It will be well used in our home.

The chicken was very moist and tasted good. I would cut the lemon juice, capers, and artichokes amount in half. It was way too sour for kids but loved the chicken..

This has become a go to recipe for me. The only thing I do different than the recipe is that I rarely have capers on hand so I usually omit it all together or use some kalamata or other tangier olives instead.

This dish was really fast and easy to prepare. It reheated well too. I used artichoke bottoms as that was what I had. I had requests to make it again. I may just decrease the salt, I found it a little salty.

I make this recipe on a regular basis and my family loves it.  I usually put over whole wheat penne pasta, but have also used rice.  I have even swapped out the chicken for shrimp for a scampi feel.  Delicious!

This was good but not something I would rave about.  I used marinated artichokes but drained before adding.  I had to double the amount of butter just to get the tartness of the sauce to a tolerable level.  Definitely would recommend UN-MARINATED artichokes.  Added sundried tomatoes like others and I think that added to the depth of the sauce.

Super easy, quick, and awesomely good chicken piccata. Needed to thicken sauce with excess seasoned flour paste. Marinated artichokes are the only way to go, as the dish needs that extra flavor. Who wouldn't love this?  :)

Delicious!  Super tender chicken (don't overcook). I can only rate the chicken with thickened sauce because I omitted the artichoke  and capers.

This was without a doubt the best chicken cutlet recipe I have ever made!!  The flavor was incredible - I used an electric frying pan and it worked really well.  I will make this over and over again - would work great for company!!

I loved how easy this recipe was. I am not a cook by any means but my girlfriend and I really enjoyed it. I was concerned my kids would be wary but it is a great meal for the whole family. I did try the suggestion of adding mushrooms and I would recommend portabella. Also saute the mushrooms before adding to the sauce. Otherwise reducing the sauce to a half takes forever! I also would add a few more capers. I served it with egg noodles but will try an angel hair pasta next time. Enjoy! We did!

This was great, I changed it a little by adding a 1/2 cup of white wine, another 2 tbs of butter and canned artichokes drained.  Served it over Fettuccine and the family loved it!

Delicious!  I added a bit more lemon juice and served it with mashed potatoes.  I will try serving it with pasta and add mushrooms next time.

My 13 year old son found this recipe and made it for us! It was amazing, I normally don't take seconds or thirds of anything but I did that night! While I think it was perfect as is, we thought sundried tomatoes would be a good addition. Will definitely be making this again.

This was a great recipe.  Easy to prepare & very tasty.  I did have to use a little more oil then the recipe called for but otherwise this is a real keeper.  I cooked about 6 thin cut chicken breasts and had the leftovers on another night - they tasted even better!!!

After reading all the rave reviews, we were expecting to like this dish. We love artichokes, but as another stated~ this dish has a very "off" flavor. My husband and I both ate very little and my three children ate the chicken that did not make it back into the pan..  Even to rinse the artichokes, I don't think I'd make again.

I was surpised that I didn't like it.  Next time I will use plain artichoke hearts.  The kids ate the chicken minus the sauce.  My husabnd liked it and took the left overs to work the next day. So nothing went to waste.

Fiancee who's crazy about chicken and flavor loved this and said no changes or tweaking needed.  That's a big compliment.

I just made this last night, and my husband and I agree it's our new favorite. It was so easy and delicious! It was great for a weeknight dinner. It'd also be a tasty dish for company. I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce didn't thicken up enough so I added a little cornstarch (mixed in cold water, of course). I served it with brown rice. Next time I'd like to try it with pasta.

Very tasty, although I made a couple of changes.  Instead of adding the artichokes, I added mushrooms (my kids don't like artichokes).  I also added more lemon juice and the zest.  My kids loved it....it's definitely a keeper!

This was fantastic. I used thin sliced turkey breast cutlets, and served over angel hair pasta. It was easy to make and really impressed my husband.

Very good recipe.  I served this over rice and cooked recipe to the tee didn't change a thing.  Next time will serve over egg noodles and add a little more spice to the chicken.

Just made this dish and we did not care for it at all.  The marinated artichokes provide a horrible flavor.  I think if I used regular artichokes the dish would have been good.  I put it over egg noodles, didn't use the sauce and put tons of parm cheese to kill the taste of the marinated artichokes.

This was just "ok". Not one person in my family cared for it. We ate it, it was not horrible but I would not make it again.
