Since I didn't have a few of the ingredients, I substituted. For wheat germ, I used ground up oatmeal. For soy flour, I used more whole wheat flour. For canola oil, I used olive oil. For soy milk, I used rice milk. And then, I only had two eggs and it still turned out delicious! Imagine that! :) I also added strawberries and maple syrup. YUM!

Just a note to the last reviewer: You can use soymilk w/ just about any recipe that calls for milk. There's no special recipe that you need to use soy for. I nebver ever use regular milk in baking and I make everything from brownies to cake to cookies etc... 
Anyhow, this recipe is good. Nothing special, but pancake recipes can only get so creative anyhow. Since you can use soymilk in place of regular milk in any recipe this recipe isn't original or anyting, but atleast it shows people liek the last reviewer that it's no big deal and doesn't make it taste a bit different.

I have made this recipe numerous time and they always turn out great.  I increased the almond extract to 1 teaspoon and added blueberries.  I freeze the whole batch in ziploc bags and pull them out as needed for a snack before running or going to the gym.  They're great with or without syrup!

I thought this recipe was excellent. My four year old wants to have pancakes like every other day and now I don't have to tell him no. These are high in fiber and really healthy. The only adjustment I would make next time would be to use vanilla extract instead of the almond.

I have been looking for a healthy pancake recipe that made thick fluffy pancakes and this is it! I made a few alterations to make it even healthier. First I used 3 oz. flaxmeal and 1 oz. oil instead of the 1/4 C. oil. I didn't have wheat germ, so I used almond flour instead. And since I didn't have soy flour, I used 1 tbsp. black bean flour (which is extremely high in fiber). I also increased the almond extract to 1/2 tsp. In spite of all of these changes, the pancakes were wonderful.

These are yummy - just like cookies!
They're very light and fluffy too.
I bet they'd be good with strawberries

I did not have soy flour, I just added three more tablespoons of whole wheat flour. I also used vegetable oil instead of canola oil and lactose-free milk instead of soy milk because I'm on a tight budget and I need to use what I have on hand. I did not try these myself but my husband and kids said they were really good--they must have been, they ate almost all of the pancakes I made! I will say they turned out really fluffy and light, even though made with whole wheat flour and wheat germ. VERY hearty. I served them with homemade maple-vanilla syrup. NOTE: I might try substuting applesauce for the eggs next time, just to see how they turn out.

I love this recipe. I add 1 t. of almond extract as well. I think it really highlights the whole wheat flavor. In place of the 1/4 wheat germ I have always used uncle sam's brand cereal you can buy in the healthy section of Walmart. It gives the pancakes a bit of a crunch from the flaxseed. Couldnt say more wonderful things about this recipe. Thank you!

We made these pancakes with skim milk and a little butter instead of the soy milk. We added blueberries and diced stawberries. Absolutely delicious!

My mother used to make us whole wheat pancakes when I was younger and they were always dense and horrible so I didn't have high expectations for this recipe.  Fortunately I was wrong!  These pancakes came out fluffy and delicious.  I will definately make these again.

These pancakes are very heavy. They fill you up fast & taste o.k. but they are a little too heavy for me.

Made a few changes to fit my family's taste. 1 c wwpf, 1 T white cornmeal +1 T yellow cornmeal + unbleached ap flour = 1 c, 3 T ground flax seeds, 1 T sugar, and I left out the soy fl cause i didn't have any. Also used olive oil instead of canola and vanilla extract instead of almond. Very good. Will probably play with it more to make a multi grain pancake.

Great taste!  I left out the salt, changed the sugar to honey, and omitted the almond extract.

Very good! I don't have soy flour so I used oat flour (Quaker oats ground up in the blender-saves money!). Thankfully, that worked! I also used cow milk & applesauce for the oil. I added some Splenda & 2 1/2 tsp cinn. The almond extract was an interesting touch-added a nice flavor. I accidently used whole wheat flour in place of the wheat germ & that worked, too! Thanks so much!

For Whole Wheat pancakes, these are quite good; however, not good enough to make me want to switch from my unbleached all-purpose flour.

This is a staple in our home.  Our son is allergic to dairy and egg so finding good recipes can be a challenge particularly for breakfast food.  I use an egg substitute in this recipe and they come out perfect every time.  They are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside just the way that pancakes should be.  My little one gobbles them up and so does my big boy (husband)!!!

I'm always a little torn about how to rate a recipe that I tweaked so much. These tasted great and were perfectly fluffy even with my changes, and I love that this is the only recipe I've come across that uses THIS much whole wheat flour. Alterations: I didn't have wheat germ, so I used about an 1/8 cup nutritional yeast and 1/8 cup chopped walnuts (no particular reason why, just had these things on hand); I used unbleached white flour instead of soy flour; I used vegetable oil instead of canola; I used 1/2 tsp vanilla instead of the almond extract. I also added blueberries. This is a keeper!

I didn't have any almond extract so tried it with maple extract...also cut back on sugar and did not add salt. The sugar I used is lavender flavoured and added a unique flavour to the pancakes. I ate them dry they were so YUMMY! Also, I have a dairy allergy so used water instead of milk.
