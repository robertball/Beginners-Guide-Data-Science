We LOVED this! I had no issues w/ it being too salty or greasy. I did 1/2 the recipe and use pickled diced jalapeno peppers in place of the fresh b/c that's what I had on hand. Loved the buttery cracker topping! All of the flavors went great together...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've been making this filling for years. It's just a basic cheeseball recipe, adding bacon, jalapenos and a crumb topping. I don't understand why mayonnaise is always added as an ingredient. It's unnecessary. Just ensure cream cheese is very soft. This doesn't yield a party size amount, so if entertaining, double.  More than 5 jalapenos are needed for a true jalapeno flavor. If you drain the bacon properly, won't be greasier. I mean it is a cheese dish. Some grease won't be avoided. I also season with a little garlic pepper.

This has quickly become a favorite among my family and friends at gatherings.  I double the amount of jalapenos,added garlic to the cheese mix, and chives to the topping for some added color.  I usually use the Italian blend cheese instead of just motz or whatever I have on hand.  Last time i added a little muenster cheese mmmmm.

I looked at the reviews concerning this recipe and decided I would follow the original except for some small modifications.  I used 10 medium size jalepenos with seeds, 2 more ounces cream cheese, 1 1/4 c cheddar cheese, and 3/4 c mozzerala.  We had no issues with the dip being greasy or even close to it.  Perfect dip for a large number of people.  If you are entertaining less than six, I would recommend cutting the recipe in half.  Will make this dip over and over, we loved it!!

Too salty, too greasy. I doubled the jalapeno's & cut mayo in half . The cheddar made a layer of grease that the crackers soggy Truly a disappointment.

This recipe is great!  Just made it for football games yesterday and the family loved it.  I did make a few alterations to accommodate what ingredients I had on hand; instead of green onions I grated about a quarter of a Spanish onion into the cheese mixture.  I had no mozzarella cheese so I used all white cheddar, and I added a few cloves of garlic because I'm incapable of making anything without a little garlic.  I omitted the bacon because I failed to ration it and had to use what I had crisped for potato skins.  I also used half mayonnaise and half sour cream, simply because I like the tangy flavor of the sour cream.  I made a half recipe but used 4 whole jalapenos because we like hot and spicy foods.  

Some reviewers have commented that this turned out greasy.  I've noticed in my years of cooking experience that the quality of the ingredients, specifically the cheddar cheese, makes a huge difference.  I made the mistake of preparing a family favorite casserole with a store brand shredded cheddar cheese and the end result was a very greasy dish that I found inedible.  The other times I've made that same casserole I used a much better cheddar cheese and the dish was never greasy.  A better cheese will give you a better end result and the price difference is negligible.  I used Cabot Alpine Cheddar in this recipe and it was just delicious.

I have a huge family with a lot of great recipes, but there are a LOT of people aged 13-25 in my family and they always me to make this at our family gatherings! I drain the bacon and do just sour cream instead of mayonnaise. I serve with corn chips, quinoa chips, or regular tortillas chips. Everybody loves it!!

THIS RECIPE IS OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!!!!!! I had a ton of jalapenos from the garden and needed to use them quick. I also had some leftover crab meat and threw that in. My mouth is watering just remembering how amazing it is! Definately will be making this again!

Yummy and not too greasy as others have stated. I drained the bacon on paper towels for a few minutes before adding to the other ingredients. The whole family loved this recipe.

We really enjoyed this dip. It was perfect for using up a bunch of fresh jalapenos. I left some with seeds because we like it hot. I did not have any issues with it being too greasy or too salty at all. I like it better without the cracker topping.

The only thing I change about this recipe is I put it in a bigger dish (13x9) so you get more cheese cracker topping over the yummy cheesy goodness. Other than that you do not need to change a thing with this recipe. I have made it several times and ever single time I have been begged for this recipe. Other times I have been out right asked if I was going to make for them. This one is a winner! Serve with a good thick corn chip and stand back or get trampled.

This dip was delicious! My adjustments are for 8 servings. I used 2 tablespoons of mayo, 2 tablespoons of sour cream, and a Sargento's Mexican cheese mix. There is less grease when you use a mix of Monterey jack, cheddar, queso quesadilla, and asadero cheese. I left off the topping.

Loved everything about this dip!  Easy to make, really delicious.  Kept the seeds in one of the peppers and wasn't too spicy. I didn't have scallions so I omitted those and still turned out delish.  Was unsure of what to serve it with - ended up using tortilla chips and was perfect.  Will definitely make again.

Every party I go to I get asked to make this recipe. It is soooo good. I use a few more jalapeños because I like it spicy and I don't measure the shredded cheese because I put more and I like it really cheesy! It's such an easy and simple recipe but is so delicious. Definitely recommend making it!

My new favorite dip.  and absolutely NOT too salty or greasy.  The chips are much saltier :p  Next time I will add more jalapeno.  Great taste, but not spicy enough.

Omit all the cheese (except cream cheese) and it won't be as greasy. Poppers are traditionally just jalepeno, cream cheese and bacon. This is good, but too greasy!!

I’ve made this several times and it’s always a hit! The recipe is great the way it is. sometimes I will tweaked it a little to make it less greasy, by replacing one of the cream cheeses with a light cream cheese. I also used reduced fat mozzarella cheese. I use turkey bacon when I make this for my family since one of my relatives is allergic to pork. If I want to make it vegetarian friendly, I’ll use veggie bacon or skip the bacon all together.  it always turns out wonderful!

I made this recipe today with changes others suggested. I used bacon bits, 1/2 sour cream 1/2 mayonnaise. It was good. Better when cooled off. It definitely needs more jalapeños about 7. I also think it doesn’t need the cracker toppings

I have made this twice and it has been a big hit both times.  I do leave some seeds in the jalapenos to give the dip just a little more kick.

I like how I could make this dip ahead of time then cook it just before I need it. I used pre-cooked bacon, the kind you put into a salad, and only used 3 jalapenos. I also substituted the 1 cup of mayonnaise to 1 cup of greek yogurt and it tasted pretty delicious.

I love this recipe! I made some changes to the recipe by adding a cup of sour cream instead of mayo, I used bacon bits instead of cooking bacon, I used a 8 ounce bag of  Monterey Jack, cheddar, queso quesadilla & asadero cheese instead of the cheese in the recipe, I added 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and instead of the topping I used a half a cup of the cheese described above. Oh my goodness, I couldn't stop eating it! Definitely a keeper!

Made this for a football game and followed directions exactly with the exception of replacing the mayo with sour cream based on other reviews, and using seven jalapenos. I did not think the dish was greasy at all, although I did use lite sour cream and one brick of lite cream cheese (the other was regular). I could hardly taste the bacon so I think next time I would add the whole package of bacon and some garlic or garlic salt to give it more flavor. I might also add more jalapenos or jalapeno seeds as the dish was not spicy at all, but still pretty good.

I brought this to a BBQ (along with Tostitos Scoops) and it was devoured in record time! 
The only thing I did differently was to add about a cup of cooked, crumbled bacon to it, as other reviewers have suggested.

This dip was a huge hit. I will make it again. The only substitution was I used garlic and herb bread crumbs instead of Ritz crackers because of what I had on hand. I did not have any issues with it being greasy. It was delicious.

This has become a favorite of mine! I do make some slight changes to the recipe though: 

Sour cream instead of Mayo
A whole package of bacon (cause it's bacon!)
I leave the seeds in (I've not noticed much change in heat or spice with or without seeds)
I use at least one tub of Jalapeno cream cheese instead of two regular cream cheese.
And I broil the last few minutes to give it a nice browned top

This is always a crowd favorite and I've never had a problem with it being greasy or salty. Highly recommend!

I doubled the amount of jalapenos in suggestion by one of the other reviewers. The dip was okay, but didn't really "WOW" me, you know. It was rather plain, and I HATED the topping. It did bake really well though.

I've made this on two different occasions, and it was the hit of the party both times!  Now I have to share the recipe!

I made the recipe, but omitted the buttery crackers and butter. I tried to use fresh cheese, not bagged, as well as regular  Hellmann's mayonnaise, not one with an oil blend.  I used a small amount of fresh grated Parmesan cheese on top prior to putting in the oven. It was looking very good at the 15 minute mark, not greasy,  with a light brown edge. My husband likes the cheese a little crispy, so I continued to let it cook. That's where it seemed to get a little oily, as other reviewers stated. 
I would make this recipe again. Next time, I may trim back on the mayonnaise. I might add a few more jalapeños and bacon, and not cook quite as long

This dip is amazing, you can eat it with absolutely anything and this is by far everyone's favorite!  I made it EXACTLY per recipe twice and I can't keep it for more than a day!  Everyone loves it!!

This recipe is awesome!!!!!!!!! I whipped it up for a family and friend dinner and everyone kept eating and they didn't want to stop. Needless to say there wasn't a lot of talking going on. I gave this recipe five stars, because it is a five star recipe.

We tried it for the first time and it was a hit at the party.  We did leave seeds in 2 of the peppers.

I was really looking forward to trying this. Made it as directed. I thought it was just OK. The rest of my family and friends did not like it at all. Sorry, but will not make again.

Easier and faster than poppers, and creamy good.  The recipe made a lot, and I will definitely make it again.
