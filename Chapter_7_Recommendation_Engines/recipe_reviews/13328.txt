My son and his friend are not fond of onions and gave this soup 4 stars.  My husband and I both thought it was a wonderful 5 star soup. I did use 1 lb of chicken and added a little more water and hot sauce. I also added some chicken buillion granules.  Thanks Kat!

An easy soup to make with great flavor.  Perfect for a cold winter night.  I used elbow pasta instead of seashells, and added 1/2 cup frozen corn, it worked out well.  This soup would probably freeze well too.

I thought this was okay...it certainly was quick to make, but I didn't find the flavor to be extraordinary.

This was so quick and easy to prepare--perfect on a cold winter day! It would easily lend itself to just about any vegetable or bean -- I did add a stalk of chopped celery and I did double the chicken and the pasta--to compensate for the added pasta I added a can of chicken broth. I will definetely be making this again. Thanks!

It wasn't bad, but it was a little bland for me.  However, I did use only one package of onion soup mix.  The soup mix has a strong flavor to it, so I decided to cut out one of the packages.  But, in doing that, I think I cut out too much flavor.  Also, if making again, instead of thinly slicing the potatoes, I think I will dice them instead.  I also think the pasta should not be added until the last twenty or so minutes of cooking.  By the time my potatoes and carrots were tender, the pasta was mushy.  I added green beans for some more color, and I think it was a good addition.  Overall, not a bad recipe, but needs tweaking to improve it.

This was a good variation to the chicken soup I usually make.  I did make a couple changes to the recipe. I did not have boneless chicken so I boiled the chicken in 5 cups of water first and then when it was almost cooked (about 15 minutes) I took it of the bone and cut it.  I then added the rest of the ingredients as stated with the exception of the hot sauce (I did not any).  Also, I only used 1 package of onion soup, added about ¼ cup of white wine and 1 tsp. Rosemary.  Next time I think I will cut the potatoes in small chunks instead of slicing them.

We loved this soup! I was worried about the amt of dry onion so I only used 1 pkg, increased the water to 6c (adding 2 chix bullion cubes) and used only 1 (15oz) can tomatoes.  Also, I increased the chicken to 1 lb, added a chopped celery stalk and a couple extra dashes of hot sauce.  Very good, very easy & a keeper recipe for my family. Thanks Kat!

I LOVE this soup!!!! So did my husband. This soup is fantastic on a raining cold day!!! The first time I made it it was too sweet for us. So the second time around I minused the suger and peas (I don't like peas). It was delicous.

I was looking for a quick, tasty recipe to use up the ingredients that I already had, and I found this recipe to be so-so. After cookie the meat I put the soup in my slow cooker because we were going to eat it for a late lunch. At noon, when it had been cooking for 4 hours or so, the potatoes tasted awful, and the soup overall lacked flavor. I whipped out the spices, added more garlic, and eventually added some white wine into it. When my husband tasted it at noon, he didn’t really like it but at 10pm that night when we got home from a party we both agreed it was much better. I didn’t really like the italian seasoning in it, but I did add some cayenne pepper to give it some extra spice. I would make this again, but not without my alterations.

A tasty & hearty soup.  Instead of browning the chicken,I boiled it in the required water; sauteed 2 medium onions, 1 large toe of garlic and then proceeded with the recipe, using a package of baby carrots. A dash of crushed red pepper was also added.

I didn't have any chicken so i used ground beef instead. I added a bit more water, a beef boullion cube, and a stalk of celery. Very easy, very quick. Will definately make it regularly.

I used the leftovers from the grilled cajun chicken allrecipe -- since they were highly seasoned I only used one packet of soup mix.  I cut the sugar to 1T, and I added 1c of pasta to make the soup heartier.  My husband liked this a lot.
