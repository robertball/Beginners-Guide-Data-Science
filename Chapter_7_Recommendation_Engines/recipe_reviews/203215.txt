I made this tonight for supper.  I doubled the recipe, and I had dry white beans on hand instead of canned, so I cooked those first and used them.  I also substituted drained, canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  It was a real hit, everyone loved it, even hubby ate two plates.  I gave it four stars because I cooked it quite a bit longer than the recipe suggested, and we found that it definitely needed salt.  Served it with grated Parmesan cheese and bread.  I'll definitely make it again.

This was delicious. I tweaked it, however, and used 4 chicken breasts cut into bite sized pieces, 2 cloves of garlic (which needs to be put in about a minute before the chicken or it burns) and used a can of zesty chili style diced tomatoes. My family loved this recipe.

I added a pound of squiggly pasta to make it stretch for our family of 5. My pickey eaters LOVED IT and went back for seconds (I think my Husband went back for THIRDS!!). I didn't have fresh basil so I used italian seasoning instead. I also added a little salt to taste. I am passing this recipe on to my Sister, I think her Family will like it, too.

Really good - this is a wonderful combination of ingredients. Cranks right up to 5 stars with the addition of a little salt and lemon juice or white wine. Simple, healthy and delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved the combination of ingredients in this recipe, perfect for using up summer garden vegetables.  The chicken, however, does need salt, and I also sprinkled it with paprika, onion powder, thyme and a pinch of cayenne pepper before browning in olive oil.  I also used dry beans and cooked them in chicken broth for more flavor.

The chicken was not nearly cooked! There was no seasoning. Because the chicken was not cooked, we had to leave it on longer, which made the veggies totally soggy and icky. Skip this one... or, if you want to make it, try cooking the chicken MUCH longer.

This was so good!  I used 1 can diced tomatoes instead of fresh, as someone else suggested.  I also used up the leftover veggies from my kabobs the night before.

Great quick, healthy, and tasty! a few modifications though...first i marinated the chicken. Second, take the garlic out of the pan before you put the chicken in (add the garlic back when you add the veggies). This way the garlic doesn't burn. Last i added an onion, a bell pepper, mushrooms, and used 1 can of diced tomatoes (not drained). Overall a great dish!

This wasn't our favorite. It was fine, just nothing that stood out to us. A bit bland for our tastes. I don't think I would make it again, but if I did I would definitely add lots more seasoning. Thanks for sharing!

This was great.  I needed a recipe for my sis in law who has a very restrictive diet.  I added  two cans of tomatoes and another can of beans.  Also added fresh spinach under the dish before you serve is a yummy alternative as well.

Delicious!  So quick and easy!  Important note: the original recipe is for two servings.  I added another chicken breast, another tomato and one cup of farfalle pasta, and it ended up making more than enough for four people. I also added a good bit of salt and "Crazy Mixed-Up Pepper" seasoning.  Will definitely make this again!

I also tweaked this recipe, well not really tweak just added more veggies.  I added 1 onion cut into chunks, 1 bell pepper, cut into chunks, 2 cloves garlic-chopped, an extra tomato, and I also marinated the chicken beforehand in Italian dressing.  Will definately keep this one!

Very hearty dish.  I've made this twice and didn't drain the beans either time, which seemed to work well.  I also used one garlic clove and added more tomatoes.

I made it as it was written except I didn't have frost zucchini so I used a bag of frozen. It was good and we ate all of it. It was a little bit bland though. I didn't drain the beans and that was a mistake. I should have drained the beans and used chx broth to make up for it.

I used 3 fresh tomatoes to use them up - and I used green beans since I didn't have zucchini.  I thought it was great, I did add a little lemon juice from the suggestion on one of the reviews, and oregano instead of basil (I love lemon jc & oregano together) - will definitely make this again

My boys LOVED the chicken.  I doubled the recipe since I have a family of 5- all boys.  I used an electric skillet and the chicken was moist and juicy.  They would not eat the beans, but loved the zucchini.  This is definitely a keeper in our house.  I may only use one can of beans next time on the doubled recipe.

OMG - this is to DIE FOR!  The chicken was incredibly tender and juicy - I used romano beans and zucchini fresh from our garden and will add this to my all-time fave summer meals!
