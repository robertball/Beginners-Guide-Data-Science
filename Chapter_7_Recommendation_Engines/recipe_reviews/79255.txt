I made this as a meal and it was excellent. I changed the sauce a bit and served it over rice. The changes I made to the sauce were: I lacked peanut sauce so I used 2 tbls. of peanut butter, I increased the chicken broth to 1 cup, added 1 tbls lime juce and 1/4 cup plain yougurt. I also used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil on the chicken. The dish was very flavorful but not spicy, so if you like heat you may want to add some cayenne. Highly recomended.

I made this for a holiday party with some friends. They loved it and gobbled it down. I made it the day before. It was a fair amount of work for an appetizer but well worth it.

I made this for a meal instead of an appetizer. My husband is nuts for Thai food and he loved this recipe. I doubled the sauce, but I won't do that next time--it makes plenty. BTW, my peanut sauce comes in a tall bottle with a black label and a red dragon, if you're looking for a good one. I served it with brown rice and veggie egg rolls. Very, very good.

Turned out excellent.  I did use peanut butter in place of the peanut sauce.

This recipe is fantastic.  I had to make the peanut sauce from a recipe on this site.  We eat as a meal with white rice and a veggie.  For toppings, try a serving plate with lime wedges, chopped peanuts and cilantro instead of the green onions.  Great flavors and an easy cooking technique with better than restaurant results.

We took this to a New Year's Eve party and people at these bites to the very last morsel was gone! I cannot wait to make again. We added 1T of p'nut butter and the sauce was even better with this addition. We topped with chopped peanuts.

This was really great! I did not have tumeric or coriander available so I added a little tamarind paste and a half cup of peanut butter to the sauce mix in addition to the prepared Thai peanut sauce, which is a must. I also added some fish sauce to the chicken when I sauteed it. Love the dipping sauce. This sauce would be great doubled and served with Pad Thai noodles. Very easy to make and has a restaurant quality taste. This one is a keeper!

I cooked the chicken with only the seasoning mix -- AWESOME!  I used freshly ground coriander and think that made the extra little difference, too.  I served it with peanut sauce and a side of cilantro-lime rice.  Yum.

It was delicious.  I made it as a meal - tossed the chicken and sauce with some cooked soba noodles and stir fried veggies.  My husband and the kids have asked for it again, which is a big compliment.  Thanks for the recipe, I can't wait to use it as an appetizer too!

I didn't have the majority of the ethnic ingredients... nor did I have brown sugar... duh, but I still pulled this off using regular milk, maple syrup, white sugar, cinnamon, and assorted other spices that seemed to make sense to me.  The key was that I did have a bottle of Thai Spicy Peanut Sauce that's normally intended as salad dressing.  It worked perfectly!  I did have to add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce up a bit.  Sorry I'm not more helpful, but I give this one a big go for it!

I used this as a meal.  Instead of squwers. I slices the breasts and served them on top of noodles that I stir fried with cabbage, onion, carrot, mushroom and spinach.  I drizzled the sauce on the noodle mixture and placed the chicken on top.  My husband and baby both loved it. 
 I used fresh ginger instead of ground.  regular coconut milk in stead of light.  Used three full chicken breasts halved then sliced. 
  twas delicious. I will make again.  The only thing I might change in the future is adding a bit of fish sauce to the mix.  It could have used a  little umame.

Wow! This was delicious. My husband and I took the advice of other reviewers and turned this into a main dish. We decreased the amount of chicken breasts to 2, but used the same amount of dry seasonings. Great flavor! I added extra chicken broth and a little lime juice to thin the sauce and served over rice and vegetables. Delicious!

I made this as a meal and served it with rice. It turned out quite nice, both in appearance and in flavor. It's definitely staying in the recipe box as something to have again.

Cover the chicken with oil and spices as the recipe states and then let it marinate overnight.  For Christmas - double the amount of chicken (8 thighs served 11) but not the sauce.  Use thighs instead of breasts.  Brown thighs on each side and then cover and cook about 10 min. Use glass bowls and SS utinsils.  Everything stains orange!

AMAZING! Made it as an entree and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. Changed it a bit by adding 2 tbsp of peanut butter to the broth/milk/sauce mixture. Then I also made an incredible thick & spicy base sauce with 2 tbsp chunky PB, 1 tbsp honey, 1 tbsp water, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tsp chili pepper sauce, 1 tsp ginger powder, and a small amount of lemon juice. Worth it's weight in gold! My man and girlfriends say the meal was the BEST Thai meal they've every had.

This is the real deal!  I followed the recipe almost to a T.  I used Pad Thai sauce instead of peanut sauce.  They are basically the same.  I would recommend half or the salt but that rub concoction is A-1!  A dash of red pepper would be useful if you like a little heat.  I cooked this as a main dish to be served with brown rice.  I also added peeled whole shrimp cooked in the pan after the sauce.  I will cook this for dinner guests.  Bravo!!!

I make this often with angel hair pasta for a quick lunch or dinner. I usually skip the chopped peanuts and add a squeeze of lime over the final dish. Leftovers are great.

I made this using the "Thai-Style Peanut Sauce with Honey" recipe from this site which I liked. The only ingredient I didn't have on hand was coconut milk so I just substitued regular milk. I served it over rice alongside stir-fried veggies. This was very flavorful & tasty but slightly rich so next time I think I might a little bit more chicken broth. Overall it's very good and I love how easy it was to prepare.

Awesome! I substituted curry powder for the  turmeric (because I didn't have any turmeric) and it turned out SO good! The peanut sauce that I used was a little spicy so it turned out just perfect! I served it over rice noodles for a dinner, it was delish!

Oh, yum! Very similar to chicken satay, and so I used another peanut sauce recipe from here that had more of an Indian flair, but nonetheless this was really good. Next time I will try using breaded chicken bites.

We liked this very much. You can find the peanut sauce in the Thai section of your international aisle. I've had similar dishes with peanut butter that absolutely revolted me, but I love Thai food and the bottled House of Tsang sauce went well here. In the future I might sweeten and ginger up the sauce a bit more because I love those favors. Thanks for sharing!

Made this for Super Bowl.  I could go on and on but "yummy" sums it all up.  Made just as written and even got adventurous and made my own Thai peanut sauce  (okay, truth be told, I didn't have the store bought stuff in the house).  Again, Mmmmmmmmm.  They were gone in a flash.

Great recipe that can be made ahead. I marinated the chicken in the morning and then just grilled it closer to the party and make the sauce then as well.

My husband wanted me to make this recipe.  The spices were a different combination from what we normally cook with - I even had to buy 2 of them!  I thought the chicken was incredibly flavorful and delicious.  I love the added crunch of chopped peanuts on top.  We both barely used any of the dipping sauce - the drizzle on top of the chicken before serving was enough for both of us (we ate it as a meal instead of serving as an appetizer).  If I were making this for just us I would just use peanut sauce alone to save time, but if serving as an app for a party I would make the sauce again as the recipe directs.  It was good, we just didn't use much of it.  This tasted great as dinner served with green beans on the side.

Used peanut butter and yogurt as suggested by others. May try a little coconut on the coating of the chicken next time

I made it as written. Aside from finding it a bit too salty, this was delicious! I would reduce the salt in the spice mixture next time and maybe reduce the amount of chicken broth and coconut milk in the sauce to keep it thicker and more peanutty.

I made it as directed.  My Thai-loving friends loved it. I'm not a big turmeric fan but I liked it enough to enjoy a little taste or two!

Oh my. What a tasty recipe. Everyone loved it. One guest who said he didn't like peanut sauce went back for thirds. I am going to serve it next week at our girl's night out party. Thanks for sharing.

Jury is out and I would say it was good, but not out of this world. I took this to a New Year's eve party and I wasn't too happy with the way it came out, thought others wouldn't think much of it either. Surprisingly, everyone who tried it said they loved it, including my boyfriend who runs away at the word "Thai". So, it's definitely good and worth trying. I may do it again when I have people at my own house and I can do a better job of keeping it nice and warm. Perhaps I had cooked just a little too much that day and wasn't going to be pleased with anything! About the sauce... I tasted it as written and did not like it ... I think it was all the coconut milk. I actually did add a couple TBSP of peanut butter and enjoyed it much more. It's all in what you prefer!

This was very good. I followed the recipe exactly, but used chicken breast strips and served over rice with a salad for my husband and I. The coconut milk really gives the dish a nice flavor.
