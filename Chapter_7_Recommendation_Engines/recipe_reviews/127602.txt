Needs some fresh grated black pepper, and we also add a little crushed garlic to the marinade...The onions can be left in the marinade overnight.

These onions pair really well off of a spicy marinated taco meat. I usually like to let the onions sit overnight, but 2-3 hours will do in a pinch.

Pickled onions never sounded good to me until I had them on a sandwich at a local restaurant. Now I'm hooked! I have been using these to perk up my veggie sandwiches and they are great. I love the new twist. The temp is below zero here in Minnesota and there was no way I was going to get out the grill, so I just simmered the onions in the vinegar solution on the stove until they were soft (about 5-10 min).  I cut down the sugar and salt a bit due to personal preference, and added a bit of pickling spice.

This is one of those recipes I would never have thought to try - or even ordered on a sandwich! - but a few weeks back we ordered a sandwich platter from a local deli for a work meeting.  I picked a BLT on Ciabatta with pesto mayonnaise, but these were also on the sandwich and they MADE the sandwich!  I was so happy to come across this recipe - made them the othe rnight as I was grilling veggies for another recipe, and had some for lunch today on my turkey sandwich. Great sweet onion/slightly tart flavor that is a great addition to sandwiches! Thank you, CookBrooke for sharing! :)

Easy to make and very tangy. My husband didn't care for the smell of the vinegar mixture while cooking but I enjoyed the flavor.

I used white vinegar and added a bit of dill and sea salt instead.  These smelled wonderful cooking and have a great taste to them.  I also canned these using the boiling water method to seal the jars for longer storage.
