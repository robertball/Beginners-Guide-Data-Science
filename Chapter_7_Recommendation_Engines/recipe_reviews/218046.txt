I made this as a birthday cake for my daughter! It was such a hit!!!! and very very delicious!!!!! I made a few changes, but that shouldnt change the overall outcome of the recipe - I used cookies n cream flavor ice cream. I made the brownie mix according to the low fat version. I lined the spring form pan with oreo cookies. I will make this recipe again!!!

I just followed the instructions on my brownie mix which saved me from adding an extra 1/4 cup of oil and an extra egg.  I used vanilla ice cream softened with some milk.  I was a little disappointed with the overall taste, I didn't care for the texture of the frozen brownies and the homemade chocolate sauce was messy to work with.

Very good! A few tweaks to make it easier:

I microwaved the chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk in a large glass measuring cup. With my 1600 watt microwave, I gave it one minute, and then stirred for 30 seconds until completely melted and blended. Pouring it from the measuring cup avoided the mess that some other reviewers have noted. I used a rubber spatula to spread it to the edges, but I didn't worry too much about spreading it perfectly for the first layer. 

Next time, I will also bake the brownies in a single layer right in the springform pan, and slice to make two layers. The only problem I had this time was that my cake pans were just a tiny bit smaller than the springform, even though they were both supposed to be 9". That left a little room around the edges when I put the brownies in the springform. I will also try parchment to remove it more easily after baking.

I switched out the mint ice cream for one with carmel swirled into it. It was an instant hit. You can have it ready to serve in 3-4 hours but it sets up much nicer, serves easier and looks prettier if it can freeze for an entire day or even overnight.

I made this, but added my own twists to it...I used a really good vanilla bean ice cream, and made my own recipe for chocolate ganache that I poured over the top before freezing...DELICIOUS!!!

I made this last night and it was very good...the only thing you really have to worry about is getting it in the freezer before the ice cream melt

So yummy! A new family  favorite. It’s a versatile recipe since any ice cream would go great inside. I made it the day of for my daughters birthday and it worked out great. However, a full day to freeze would make cutting the pieces more clean. The brownie stays soft enough to cut and the ganache is over the top! I made whipped cream and piped it around the edge.  Fantastic recipe

I looked to this recipe to easily make an ice cream cake for my younger sister when she returned home from a trip to China with friends. I was glad that she and the rest of my family enjoyed it and look forward to trying more recipes
I didn't realized that I actually had condensed milk and used regular skim milk to make the chocolate sauce and it turned out to be pretty more liquid than desired. I would like to have the chance to try it the correct way, double checking the store rooms for cans of condensed milk.

This came out quite well. I used a little less than 1 quart of vanilla ice cream between the two layers . I will definitely make this again.

Baked this for my grandson's birthday, making 7 layers.  It was good but I won't make this cake again. I used 2 brownie mixes so I could have 4 brownie layers, and I used chocolate chip ice cream because he doesn't like mint. Those were the only changes to the original recipe. It was not a pretty cake, but we decorated the top with candles. 

I had a very hard time getting the brownie layers out of the cake pans, even though I sprayed the pans with PAM.  The ice cream dripped out between the layers, and the chocolate sauce was so runny that most of it ran down onto the cake plate.  I had chocolate all over my kitchen, my apron, the cake, plate, etc.
