Brought this to a family dinner and I ended up not letting anyone eat it after I actually tried it.  Nothing worse than crunching on granules of sugar.  I may try it again but with much less sugar next time.  It seemed like even though I spent  ALOT of time mixing the butter into the dry mix, the sugar just didn't mix in.  I also think I baked it too long (30 mins) because the apples turned to complete mush.

Made this for the first time,  I read the previous review first and I like hoop so I added some extra brown sugar and a few extra tablespoons of butter to make a caramel goo this desert was great

I had 2 Granny Smith and 1 Golden Delicious apples to do something with and found this recipe.  I wish an actual measurement in cups was used for the apples because they can vary widely in size.  Mine were softball sized.  I left the peel on.  I was excited to try this recipe as apple crisp is DH's favorite dessert.  He wasn't overly impressed.  I think the main complaint was that there was no liquid or "goop" in the bottom.  Overall this is very dry.  We'll finish this batch but I doubt that I'll make it again.
