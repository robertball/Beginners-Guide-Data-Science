1.11.17   I’m a dedicated wine drinker but occasionally enjoy a cocktail, and this is a good one.  Bought a bottle of grenadine to make this, tasted it, and wondered if it would make the cocktail icky-sticky-sweet.  Well, it didn’t, I would think partially because of the fresh lemon juice giving it that great sweet-tart balance.  Winner in this house, even husband thought it was good!

This was very good.  I don't normally drink whiskey, but I liked this a lot.  We were looking for Gatsby period cocktails and this was a possibility.
