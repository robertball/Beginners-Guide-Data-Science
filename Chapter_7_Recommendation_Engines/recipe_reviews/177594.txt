A decent starting point, but I added a lot. I didn't have any orange marmalade so I just used the juice of an orange and added some extra corn starch. I also added some Chinese chili paste to give it a kick. That way there will still a lot of taste, but not that sticky, too sweet flavor. I will definitely use it again!

I made this last night and the only change that I made was to mix a little orange juice and sweet chili sauce (about 3 tablespoons)in to spice it up a little.  Excellent recipe! I did not think there was too much sauce, I like the extra to mix with the rice.  My husband gave it a thumbs up, and my very picky 6 year old even liked the sauce with the chicken!

OMG!!! SOOO good a great way to get my kids to eat their veggies (me too). I thought at first I would not like this recipes because I am not big into citrus flavours but it was worth trying I do not regret it once so ever although I left out the onion.

I was so excited about this because I love stir frys...but I don't know what happened.  This had the worst flavor ever.  I LOVE orange stuff but this didn't remind me of orange chicken at all.  I almost want to try it again because maybe my marmalade was bad (although I just bought it) or something haha. Anyways, first time and I was definitely not a fan.

Nice zesty orange flavour.  Next time I will use less chicken stock mixture, as there was too much sauce.

I made this for my Home and Family life class. Everyone loved it! My Ag shop teacher enjoyed and commented me on it. the orange marmalade really is the main part of the whole dish. The fresh veggies that I used were green and yellow bellpeppers and sliced onions and tomatos. My classmated enjoyed it!

excellent flavor, but too much sauce.  had to add more corn starch to thicken it down more, and scooped some out to throw away. next time, i will try reducing the sauce mixture by 50%.

It was important to watch the amount of chicken stock you use.  I happen to use about 1 1/4 cup, and had a nice sauce.  Thank you for those that posted your notes about that.  I would agree to add a lil chili spice to it next time, was a lil too sweet for my liking, but I would make it again.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed this dish.

Yuck.  I love orange chicken, but I didn't like this at all.  Very faint orange flavor, mostly tasted like soy sauce.  I'll never make this again.

I like the recipe. I added salt and pepper to the chicken while cooking it to add a little bit of flavor. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

Too much sauce, I used about half. All was very good. Might add some more spice next time, the flavor wasn't as I expected.

This was a hit at dinner tonight.  I followed the directions to the T.  I only gave it 4 stars because the chicken was a little dry (my fault I'm sure) My 2.5 year old really loved at and My wife and I usually have a heck of a time to try and get her to eat chicken.  Not this time. Thanks

Good Would make again. Yes, ther is a lot of sauce but I added a lot of veggies so I needed the sauce. I didn't think the orange was overpowering but next time will add a little spice.

We had to add some seasoning to this dish (salt, pepper, red pepper flakes) but the marmalade really was just too overbearing. Will not make this recipe again.

I made this exactly as written and it was just ok. The sauce thickened nicely but there was just so much that it made the dish soupy. Half as much would have been good for the recipe quantity of meat and veggies. Also, it did seem rather bland for a stir fry. I ended up adding some salt, red chilli paste, and ginger, which kicked it up a notch.

It was ok but needed twice as much corn starch to thicken and I added Chinese red chili and sesame seeds which helped.

It was very good, but next time I would add some chili sauce to give it a kick, and some peanuts to give it some crunch. I also used oil to fry the chicken and veggies, not the spray. Easy to make and I liked the orange flavor.

I was surprised how bland this tasted. The sauce needed more cornstarch to thicken. The amount was okay for me since I just threw in an arbitrary amount of vegetables and doubled the chicken amount. Was not that impressed with the flavor - it really didn't taste like anything.

this was a solid base recipe. i'd make it again but definitely add some more flavour as it was kind of bland. but nothing was wrong with it in particular. i added some hot chili sauce to heat mine up and the hubby added soya sauce. i think it would be good for feeding guests because there's no overpowering flavour/heat.
