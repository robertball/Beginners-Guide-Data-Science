This is a great fried chicken recipe! Talk about easy!! Instead of the black pepper and the garlic salt, I did seasoned salt and garlic powder. I cooked the chicken in the oven instead of a pan. Yummy!

Very good, however, I needed to continue the cooking process on low heat, not medium high......

I would give this one star, but I am afraid that I must have done something wrong.  The chicken simply would not cook evenly in the pan, and it took forever.  The coating was nice on the few pieces that worked, but on most it fell off and we had to finish cooking it in the microwave!  Not a keeper.

This was good, but needed a lot more spices.  I will make again but probably double the spices.  My kids loved it though!

This recipe was awesome. The only thing I did different was use honey flavored frosted flakes instead of corn flakes. It gave the chicken a wonderful honey flavor to it. It blended nicely with all of the other spices! This one is a keeper! Thanks!

I made this recipe in 2 batches. I oven baked both but in the first one I used oil heated and cast iron skillet. This did not work very well, the breading fell off. The next one, I used a rack and baking pan. This way worked better and  helped the coating stick better. I also used frosted flakes since that was all I had in the house. It had a nice sweetness and terrific crunch! Thank You laVanda:)

This was a good recipe, but not fantastic, so I give it three stars. I added an extra 1/4 tsp of each of the spices because it was too bland otherwise.

I thought it was very good.  I soaked the chicken in a brine to give it a little more salt taste and used frosted flakes.  My three boys and my wife loved it.

I cooked mine in the deep fryer.  Maybe it was that, but alot of my batter fell off.  Even at a lower heat.  It was a little too bland for us so I doubled the seasonings.  It was insanely good!!!  I'm going to try it again in a pan.  I gave it 4 stars because I feel like if I had been at LaVanda's house it would of been perfect.

This was quick and easy.  I made it as a picnic chicken and it worked out great!  Be ready for a different texture than traditional fried chicken, it is lighter and provides a nice crunch!  I added additional seasonings, seasonal salt, shallot pepper, seasoned pepper, parsley and a fine herbs blend.  Next time I'll throw in some dried mustard to give it a bit of a tang.

I added garlic Powder and seasoned salt along with cayenne. I made it with boneless breasts and filet the breasts.
It was juicy and flavorful.

This recipe is great for chicken tenders. Instead of the garlic salt, I used seasoned salt and added about 1/4 tsp of garlic powder. I also added about 1/4 tsp onion powder. I pan fried the chicken in a little olive oil, but next time I will try baking them on a rack and baking pan, as some of the coating fell off while flipping the chicken.

Came out perfect!  I didnt change a thing since I knew I would be topping my thinly sliced chicken breasts with sauted mushrooms and Munster cheese. Perfectly beautiful!

I used this recipe to make chicken fingers tonight since my 7 year old won't touch regular pieces of chicken. He said it was better then the ones at his favorite restaurant.  My husband loved them as well.
