I added this sauce with a bunch of vegetables I had in my fridge, and while it looked and smelled pretty delicious, it was rather bland. We added Maagi sauce to it to give it more flavor, but next time I plan to increase the amount of soy sauce and ginger, and hopefully that will make it less bland.

Bland, and I think cornstarch would have been better than flour in this recipe.  Upped both ginger and soy sauce and it still didn't do much for the flavor.

Sauce was good but I will double it next time to have extra for the rice!  It was also a bit bland but I used Braggs Amino Acids instead of soy sauce so that might have been the problem.

I thought this was a great recipe as a guideline to make your own veggie stir fry. I added a few other veggies, and followed most of the preparation steps. Only other change I made was to use sesame oil place of vegetable oil. In place of chicken stock, I used Swanson Vegetable stock since I was serving this to some vegetarian guests. Also agree with GreenGirl24, I used cornstarch in place of flour and not as much. There were no leftovers after eating this dish!

I made this recipe to go with a teriyaki chicken recipe from this site. It turned out I didn't have enough soy sauce on hand, so I rounded out with some oyster sauce; and I didn't have four bell peppers on hand, so I filled in with yellow squash and red onion. The recipe is flavorful, and the finished dish was both colorful and delicious! Very versatile - definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Overall very good! I used veggies I had on hand (carrots, mushrooms, broccoli, bok choy) and tofu. I used fresh grated ginger, garlic and onion for flavor and found it just right. I also cooked veggies for less time to keep them crisp.

Like many have said, this is a great guide for a simple recipe.  It is just what I was looking for.  I wanted to be able to use ingredients that I had on hand.  I adjusted according to the amount of vegetables I wanted to cook and according to taste.  I followed others’ suggestions and used corn starch instead of flour.  The only addition was red pepper flakes because I like things a little hot. Otherwise, I adjusted the taste with soy sauce, ginger, and salt and pepper.  I can’t wait for leftovers tomorrow!!  Thank you!

Very good.  The sauce was the correct amount for the vegetables in the recipe.  I used veggies I already had on hand-reduced amount of red bell pepper, carrots, broccoli, added a few additional mushrooms, some onion, and celery.  I would suggest using fresh ginger if you have it on hand.  Next time I plan to omit the water.  I served this with Korean BBQ Steak Tips (recipe from Butcher Box).

I made this tonight to jazz up my stir fry veggies. Used cornstarch in place of flour (dec 1/2 amount). Also added 1/2 tsp of garlic and onion powder, 1/8 tsp cloves and cinnamon.  Turned out well, but not outstanding.

I found this to be inspirational and did use it as a guide but I made changes that turned out great!  It was a lazy, Sunday evening, we had freshly cut Trader Joe's vegetables in a convenient refrigerated package, AND also some  frozen packs of brown rice that's great and  microwaves nicely.  
  The spice  mix was a good start, but I wanted to add more flavor so I used a group of spices in a McCormick Blend "Chinese Five Spice", a mix that you could buy or make yourself; it contained anise, cinnamon,star anise,cloves, and ginger, which truly created a more exotic, rich and spicy flavor meaning it was much more flavorful.  Also I used Tamari Soy Sauce, using less soy sauce required and one can play with the amount to use as the label suggests you can use 1/4  the amount when substituting it for regular salt for the same amount of sodium. It's also made with more soybeans than other soy sauces for a richer flavor . I have used it for decades in various things.
   The flour clumped a lot w/ water and broth added as I mixed it- I ended up straining out the lumps. I would suggest either leave it out all together, and increase the  liquid by mixing water with  broth,(I used vegetable broth), more of the spice mix ,(note-add equal amounts of water with the additional broth),  or perhaps try to create a heated mix with the recipe's ingredients, using warmed olive oil & the flour ,(maybe substitute rice flour whisked into it for gluten-free folks), then slowly add the broth as soon as
