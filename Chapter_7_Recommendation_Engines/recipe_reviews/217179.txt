ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! If I could give this recipe more stars I would! This was my first year attempting Easter bread, and I chose this recipe because it sounded the most like what I was looking for, and it really, REALLY exceeded my expectations. I did do a few things slightly different, due to what I had and such...I am lazy, lol, so I mixed everything up in my bread machine on the dough cycle. Also, I only had pure anise oil, which is waaaay stronger than anise extract, so I used 1/4 teaspoon and that was perfect. I had an orange that was really to tart to eat, but I didn't want to waste the entire thing, so I zested it and threw that in the mix as well~YUM! Finally, I decided that I wanted a sweet glaze on top, so I baked it plain and then made a simple glaze of powdered sugar, vanilla and milk and drizzled that on top before topping with the colored sprinkles. The dough for this bread was wonderfully soft and super easy to work with. It smelled amazing while baking, and once I was able to cut into it, it had  the most wonderful, light and airy texture that I just loved! This will be a new Easter staple for my family...I am sooo happy that I found this recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)

This dough was VERY easy to work with.  I actually misread the ingredients and only added 1 egg initially.  Thankfully, I caught my mistake. I was worried that adding more wet ingredients after the dough had come together would mess with the consistency, but it still worked out well.  

As another reviewer said, I used vanilla because I had no anise extract (although I'm sure the anise would've been delicious). Finally, I made a cinnamon glaze (1 cup powdered sugar, 1 tbsp margaine, 1 tbsp milk, 1 tbsp cinnamon) to go on top.  Yum!  The bread also reheated well the next morning with a couple seconds in the microwave.

This bread was wonderful.  I used my stand mixer with dough hook for kneeding.  I wanted for Easter morning, but didn't want to get up early.  I made night before and put in fridge to raise overnight and worked beautifully.  Put it on round pizza stone after kneeding, covered with plastic wrap sprayed with a little cooking spray so dough wouldn't stick...at 7 AM it was perfect to bake, just left out for 10 mins to bring to room temp and baked.  This could be changed in so many ways with different extracts and/or shapes.  Yummy!!

I have been making a version of this bread for about 30 years and it is one of my signiture and requested favorites.  I have never been completely satisfied with the recipe I used, however, as it was heavier than I wanted, so I tried this one.  It, also, is heavier than I am looking for and also not sweet enough; good, but not great.  The search resumes!

I followed this recipe, but the bread dough was very dry.  When I baked it, I watched it carefully, but the top was too brown and the inside was still doughy.  I bake bread on a regular basis, so this wasn't just beginner's bad luck.  I'll not make this again.

I liked it, but my family wasn't crazy about the anise. Although golden brown, it wasn't thoroughly baked.

Wow! My first time making this bread and it was delicious! Used the dough cycle of the breadmaker like another reviewer. Didn't have any anise extract, so I used vanilla extract. It still tasted great! Light, fluffy and just slightly sweet. Thanks for the great recipe!

Found this recipe today. I'm Italian and found this very much like my mother's bread. I added raisins - no other changes..made 2 different shapes. They both turned out beautifully! Thanks for sharing! Happy Easter!

I made this and it was wonderful. I am full Italian American and have my own version of "Easter bread". This was easy to make and really delicious. I added juice from one half fresh orange and rind to the milk mixture and it's great. I put it in a bundt on after I twisted it and baked it, it's gorgeous!

This was my first time making bread ever, this recipe was perfect! I used vanilla extract instead of the anise and it worked out great. I did expect it to be a little bit sweeter, but I've never had this bread before so I don't really know how it is supposed to taste. I highly recommend this.

I've been making this recipe for years! My pic is the twisted loaf and colored eggs.  If your adding colored eggs there's no need to boil first. I color raw eggs- they cook while bread is baking. I only use anise oil- so 1/4 tsp is perfect - that stuff is strong! I throw in 1/2 tsp anise seed powder as well. I use quick rise yeast and still let is rise an hour! Sometimes I can let my breads rise 30 min - w/ quick rise ..but not this bread! Let it rise an hour or more and you will get a light fluffy bread! I let it get 2 -1/2 times the size before I bake it. My husband is Italian - and says this is the real deal like grandma used to make! - I omit the icing.

I tried it last night.  Thank you for all the tips in the reviews, I let it rise in the fridge over night, baked on a pizza stone, 20", turned oven off and left in oven for 3 min.
It was the perfect texture, and baked properly.
Thank you!

This was really, really good - and very easy to make!  Everyone loved it and ate it up.  I made it all by hand following the recipe on Easter morning.  I'm not experienced in bread making and it turned out great.  The dough is soft with a nice flavor.  I added a simple powdered sugar glaze.  The house smelled wonderful, and it was perfect with coffee.  I will definitely make this again.

This is a wonderful bread or do I call it a cake  ;) 
I had looked at other recipes and this one seemed to be the best and it was!
I added  1 tsp of lemon zest and 1 tsp lemon juice.  
Great new Easter tradition for the family.

I loved this recipe!  When I saw that it used anise extract, I knew I wanted t o try it.  I did not have the  "rapid rise" yeast on hand, so I used regular yeast and just let it rise once, punched it down and then proceeded with the rest of the directions.  This made a very fragrant, tender bread.  I made one large loaf that I am going to use at an event, but pinched off a bit of dough to make a "roll size" portion for taste-testing .  I did add some orange zest  as another reviewer suggested...the anise and orange is a perfect combo!  I plan to drizzle a glaze over the loaf shortly before serving.  I will be making this again!  Thanks, LadyAnna123 for the recipe!

ah, it was a lot of work for something came out just like bread. nothing special.  I think  I must have done something wrong with the yeast because the bread expanded but not an impressive amount.  I also made another similar recipe and that dough did double and I didn't heat the milk as warm

I made it  without the sprinkles and instead of twisting it, I just put in a loaf pan. It came out beautiful golden brown and it was delicious
