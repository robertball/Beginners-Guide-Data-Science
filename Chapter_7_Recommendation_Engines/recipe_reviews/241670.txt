The people here do not seem to understand that unleavened bread is for communion, it is supposed to taste bland. It is a sin to eat communion bread/wine to fill our stomachs, instead it is for prayer and remembering Jesus Christ. I like to do it every Saturday but you can do it as often as you want, I pray that more people turn to Christ. God bless.

Nice, simple, dense bread. Made as a side for spagetti, family loved it! Will definately make it again. Only 4 stars because it is a little bit bland, might add garlic powder for garlic bread next time.

Adding sugar helps with a better taste. This is more of a dinner type bread that does not rise but would be good with any pasta dish with garlic added or just using a garlic butter.
