I made these today.  I used my own sugar cookie recipe instead of the mix, so it made about 3 dozen.  It took me a long time to make the cheeks and ears, and I had a heck of a time with the "whiskers" even using tweezers.  But they're fun and I know the kids will love them.

Used ready made sugar cookie rolls.  Cut out the shapes and added the candy for decorations.  The kids really enjoyed these.
