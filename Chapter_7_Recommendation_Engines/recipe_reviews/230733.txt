This turned out really well!  I used raw honey instead of agave or sugar (about 2.5 tbsp), I also added about 8.75 ML of coconut water (C2O brand)to help level out the consistancy of the sauce and add more sweet coconut taste, extra firm tofu, and sesame seeds.  After the dish was complete, I drizzled on some sriracha hot sauce to give it a kick.  Next time I think I'll add some water chestnuts and pineapple chunks!

Delicious!  Didn't have beans so tried snap peas.  It was a big hit.

This didn't turn out well for us. I used the veggies as listed and chose Napa cabbage. Before the sauce even got in there, there was so much liquid from the veggies I had to drain it. After I poured the sauce in it I had a soupy mess. I tried to let it evaporate but that just cooked my veg more. There wasn't enough flavour and I added another tbsp. of red curry. I even ended up adding a couple tbsp. of peanut butter entirely defeating the purpose of "peanut free" but I felt it needed more. Won't be making this one again.

Made this last night and it was so good! Used an entire can of coconut milk. Didn't have curry paste, so used chili paste and added curry, which made it pretty spicy, but still good! Also added water chestnuts and a can of pineapple. Didn't have rice noodles, so I used some spicy noodles I had. Turned out great! Will definitely make this again. It turned out more than 4 servings for sure.

As usual I didn't have all the ingredients (red curry paste).  I followed the directions but instead of the red curry paste I just added some curry powder and hot sesame oil. I'm sure it would be must different with the rcp but it was delicious non-the-less. The recipe was healthy and delicious. Will definitely make again. I will put red curry paste on my shopping list so I will have all the ingredients.
