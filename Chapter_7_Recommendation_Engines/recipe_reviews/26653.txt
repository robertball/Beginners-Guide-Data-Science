This is a great dish!! I actually just put the meat, onions, water and seasoning packet in the crockpot. I left out the taco sauce. Our whole family loved it - and it was something we could eat all day and night... whenever someone was hungry. The meat was tender - and it was really delicious. I've made it a couple of times and it's a keeper... great the next day too.

I made this recently for a family reunion with 85 people, and served it in taco salads.  I received great compliments and it was easy to just reheat in a crock pot and serve on a buffet table.  Very tender meat and YUMMY!

I made this recipe for 15 people and it was just perfect!  It was very smooth and the consistancy was just right.  I received a lot of compliments and people asking for the recipe.  Thanks Ortega!!

This was an extremely easy and quick recipe to make.  It was also very good.  We do not like onions, so those stayed out of the recipe and I did not add the taco sauce, but did add some of the juices after shredding the meat.  It was delicious and such a better way to eat tacos than with regular ground meat.

I always make my own taco seasoning (Bill Echols on this website) and use my favorite salsas (another brand) but those are the only changes. This is a go-to recipe for my family.

This recipe was a godsend, as well as delicious!  I was asked to make tacos for
40 people!!!  This recipe was easy, I put it in the crockpot before I left for work
came home and it was just about ready to go!  It was the hit of the party!

"Real" tacos, in Mexico, are made this way, not the Americanized ground beef.

Thanks for a GREAT quick and easy recipe!

I was so glad to find this recipe, I was surprised at how easy it was. There is only one restaraunt in my area that I know of that serves shredded beef tacos. This recipe was just as good if not better.

I liked this, but next till will not add the green chilis. It made it too sweet for my taste. I will make it again, but it still needs something...

This was very good.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  We ate it like machaca with warm flour tortillas and homemade salsa, cheese, and sour cream on the side.  I decided not to use the taco sauce as we don't particularly care for bottled taco sauce, so the meat was a bit dry.  Next time I will add some of the yummy broth back into it.  Also, I used a chopped fresh pasilla chili rather than canned.  The only real problem with this recipe was that it made the house smell so incredibly good that it was torture to wait until dinner time.  Thanks for the treat.  I will make it often.

Very good recipe. I will definitely use this again. I used beef broth instead of water. ( always do). Came out excellent. Just like the restaurantsâ€¦ but I had problem with my tortilla they seem to always be over stuffed with this good meat. :D
