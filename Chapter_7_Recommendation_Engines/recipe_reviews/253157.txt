Update 7/12/16 : This is good with tofu or use chicken in strips, whatever is good. Triple the amount of sauce when adding noodles or rice. Also, add some extra flavor and add a Tbsp of toasted sesame oil. Yum!!  Original review: This is so good and equally versatile. I have made this twice and served it with white steamed rice and once with  rice noodles. Yum! The leftovers are great wrapped inside radicchio leaves.  Thank you for the recipe.

This has become a go to weeknight dinner, as the recipe is written I rate as 4 star but when additional veggies are added it is 5 star! I add thinly sliced mushrooms and more greens, have used both brussel sprouts and bok choy. Either worked well and there is no need to remove the meat from the pan before adding the veggies, leave everything together so there is only 1 dish to clean :)

For those looking for more flavor, try finishing with a sprinkle of cilantro.  Yum.  I couldn't stop eating this and I didn't feel guilty.  I Love the ease and the fact that I didn't have to make a starch for a filling meal (we are diabetic).  I will definitely recommend this to my friends and family.  Thanks for the recipe.

I followed this recipe pretty much as is with the exception of a couple of changes.   I added onion to turkey when cooking it, and substituted white sugar for agave syrup.  This was great and light.  I served it over Jasmine rice.  Delicious!!!  A new staple for me.

I have made this several times. It's a good quick meal. I use broccoli slaw blend and julienne any crispy veggies that I may have hanging around in the fridge waiting to get used up. Snap peas are particularly good. I also add cilantro as everyone in our house loves it. The sesame seeds don't add much IMO, but hubby likes to add chopped peanuts to his portion. I sprinkle a little toasted sesame oil over the top once cooking is done. Easy, quick and healthy--- what's not to like?

Added roasted chickpeas instead of turkey & used honey instead of agave. It was pretty yummy & inexpensive. 
The cabbage on it's own isn't very filling, so add as much protein as you need to have a full meal.

Very tasty recipe. Pretty much made it as the recipe calls for, with the exception of fresh ginger, organic cane sugar in place of agave syrup, a touch more garlic and added soaked rice noodles to the wok, stir fried it all up together and oh my, so good. Will make again, thanks.

This is a great quick, weeknight, healthy meal.  I didn't have that hot sauce or agave. I used chili/garlic paste and brown sugar. It got a bit spicy. I did double the whole sauce recipe. I added the first batch didn't have much flavor. So, made another batch. Also, used lean ground beef for the turkey and a whole onion.  Next time I want to try sweet Thai chili sauce.

This is a keeper recipe for my family.  It was easy and quick to make. I added some additional veggies, red bell pepper, onion and some additional match stick carrots. We will definately make it again. I may try adding a different meat next time.

I made this as written but doubled the sauce. I also added snow peas. I grated some cabbage for the slaw, but added diced carrots instead of grated. Used sriracha sauce for the heat along with some red pepper flakes. Used sugar instead of the agave sauce, didn't have sesame oil or sesame seeds. This is a great weeknight recipe because it's completely filling without requiring a starch.

To the member who gave this dish one star because you didn't know what "coleslaw mix" is, shame on you.

We loved this and it is so versatile and quick.  I tripled the sauce because I am a big fan of sauce, only double the hot sauce though.  It turned out to be the perfect amount of sauce too. I thought I might try adding red onions next time, I added snow peas this time and used an Asian salad mix instead of slaw mix.  However, I think the slaw would have been much better, even though this was amazing and full of flavor.

This makes it into rotation at least once a month.  Thanks to ground turkey triple packs from Costco and my lack of imagination on what to do with them.  The fact that this uses up any left over veggies in my fridge is a total win in my book!  The recipe is simple enough that you can adapt to whatever you have on hand.

Awesome base but definitely double the sauce and keep the cholula or siracha on the side for some added heat! I also don't make the sauce separate -I cook the turkey, once it's cooked I add the slaw stuff, then I just add all the sauce ingredients at the end. Fabulous! AND....it's good hot or cold. Thanks!

This was really good. I made it exactly as stated. Next time I’m going to use the entire bag of slaw (14 oz. ) not just 8 ounces so might have to increase the sauce a bit. It would be good with hamburger too. I’ll make it again.

I made it into a vegan recipe by using vegetarian meat crumbles instead of ground turkey.  I also didn't cook the cabbage mixture.  I just warmed up the dressing and combined the chopped veggies with the meat crumbles.  I see why they call it Crack Slaw.

This was so good.  I used pork sausage instead of ground turkey, and water chestnuts for extra crunch.

Very good and healthy.  I also used honey as I didn't have agave.  Otherwise made as written using Louisiana Hot Sauce.  Sprinkled some sriracha on top and some peanuts for extra crunch.

Tasty, but even with only about 2/3 of the sauce, it was too spicy for us. We added some raw coleslaw mix on top to take out the heat and it that did it. Next time I'll reduce the hot sauce, soy sauce and the pepper by at least half. Still, it was a quick, healthy, tasty meal and I'll make it again. Thanks!

Quick and easy - just as described.  I had it on the table in about 20minutes. I used 1/2 lean ground beef and 1/2 lean ground Turkey . I left out the hot sauce for the kids but added it to my portion.  Both tasted great my kids actually cleaned their plates- quite an accomplishment for me. I used honey/ brown sugar instead of agave. I will definitely make this again!

I made the dressing wrong and loved it. At a glance thought the sesame oil was a dressing ingredient. Didnt have sesame oil or seeds so I used tahini in the dressing.

I tweak up as usual.  Added  1T. Sambal Olek, 1 clove minced garlic, shaoxing (sp?) Chinese cookingwine, and sesame oil to the sauce mixture.  I added snap peas and additional shoestring cut carrots to the listed veg. and, sauteed the veg for a minute or two b4 adding the slaw.
The variations are only limited to your imagination. ie ground pork, beef, chicken, lamb or seasoned cubed tofu. As for the veg, celery, baby bok choy, baby corn, zucchini or yellow summer squash, bean sprout. leaf spinach or chopped kale.  It cooking not rocket science......make it YOUR OWN!

I made this recipe to the T except I used ground venison in place of turkey. I can't eat turkey. This is a fabulous dish. We both really enjoyed it.  It was super fast to prepare, so I will be making this often. I used minced garlic from a jar and the tube of ginger you can buy in a paste.  Talk about being able to throw something together fast.

A bit bland but has great potential.  Nice and easy.  I  would brown the turkey as it looked a bit anemic. I will definitely make again.  I used broccoli slaw an it was good.

It was a good meal.  It tasted like a deconstructed pork egg roll.  I doubled the sauce and used about 10-12oz of coleslaw. Both the wife and I enjoyed this and will make again.  We didn't serve over rice or noodles like many have said but may try it next time.

I made this and served over jasmine rice. I didn't have any green onions so I sliced a whole yellow onion into it since a few people said it needed something. Whole family loved it. Requested a double batch for next time.

My family absolutely loves this recipe.  I've made it twice in two weeks.  It is quick, easy, and healthy.  We added more vegetables to the stir fry to clear out our fridge and beef up the   veggie to meat ratio.

Great recipe.  Need to double the veggies for us. The spice profile was great for our family tastes - medium heat and flavorful.

This will definitely be added to my favorites! Truly enjoyed the combination of flavors with a little “kick”! After reading the reviews ( I like dressing) I made a triple batch of the sauce, but only 1 T of the hot sauce! Just right for me!  Next time I will add more of the coleslaw mix! I can’t wait for an opportunity to make for a family gathering!

This was indeed addictively delicious! I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce. 

I made a mistake and substituted Sambal Oelek for the hot sauce --- that was so hot that it made me sweat --- so don't substitute chili paste for the hot sauce (my husband pointed out that the first ingredient in Cholula is water and the first ingredient in Sambal is chile peppers. 

Even with that mistake, this tasted so good we kept on eating!

I enjoyed this dish. My only change was to replace Agave syrup with stevia powder. I like it a little spicier so added additional chipotle hot sauce to mine. I'll be making it again.

I doubled the veggies, doubled the sauce too. I used siracha since I was out of Cholula. Cut the salt down by half and used a hair less sugar. 32 oz Cole slaw mix fr Sams plus what ever other veggies I had. It was the perfect amount for 5 adults with a leftover lunch for one the next day. Served it over thick mashed pot's. Excellent.

I used sriracha sauce for the hot sauce.  I doubled the amount of sauce, added more of the veggies plus snow peas, sugar snap peas, peanuts,  rice noodles, and additional sesame oil  per other reviewer’s recommendations.   Loved it!  We are thinking pork will work well with this recipe, too.  It’s a keeper!

Really easy, fast, and yummy. We have always called these recipes "egg roll in a bowl". I didn't have agave nectar, so I used honey. Will definitely make again.

Used garlic chili sauce instead of Cholula the second time I made it. That was pretty tasty. This has become a staple for us now, perfect for busy nights.

We loved this. I doubled the sauce but instead of 2 tbsp of hot sauce, I used 1 1/2 and used Coconut Aminos or Bragg Liquid Aminos. I had a bunch of extra veggies from a veggie tray, including broccoli, snap peas, cauliflower, and mushrooms. I added the firmer veggies after cooking the turkey for a couple of minutes to my wok and then added others in stages, stirring and covering in between. I added the garlic last and reserved the green onions. Continued to flow recipe and after the turkey was fully incorporated, added the green onions and cooked for another minute or so. Removed from heat and added sesame seeds. Husband served over brown rice ramen noodles, and I made wraps with mine with steamed collared greens. I added some shiritake rice, raw green onions, and a little more sesame seeds to my wrap. We had a salad on the side, but with the extra veggies, we did not need it. I also served it with Kimchi on the side, and husband like mixed into his bowl. Yummy and easy meal and can be made so many different ways!

I doubled the sauce and doubled the slaw. I subbed brown palm sugar for agave and sriracha chill sauce for hot sauce. I also added cilantro. I liked very much after the changes.

I made this based on rave reviews but I am totally baffled as to why people love this recipe. It lacks flavour, even when I made extra sauce as others have noted.  Maybe it’s because I am Asian? Not sure but I needed to add other Asian condiments to make it more flavourful.

Just ate my first delicious serving for breakfast! Ran out of time/energy last night when shredding veggies to add to my scant slaw mix so had to refrigerate it all overnight. I served it with instant ramen noodles (boiled without the seasoning) and chopped peanuts. I’m already looking forward to my next serving!

Delicious!  I only made the veggie part, kept it raw, and added the garlic and sesame oil to the sauce.  I used a bag each of cabbage slaw, broccoli slaw and carrots so I made a generous amount of sauce, keeping the hot sauce at 1 T.  It was zingy at first bite and after marrying in the fridge for a half hour, it is AMAZING! No more boring slaw for this house!

It was great!!  My oldest daughter (17) is picky about veggies... she took one look at the name and saw that there was cole slaw in it and turned her nose up at it. 
We used it to make "easy" lettuce wraps... basically romaine lettuce boats. I put one on everyone's plate, with extra lettuce leaves and "slaw" and there was none left over - everyone loved it!

I thought I had all the ingredients on hand, but I was short of few, so I subbed out a few things...
* I was out of rice vinegar, so I subbed it with white wine vinegar.
* I was out of agave syrup, so I used a little more Blue Agave Sriracha than the recipe called for and a tablespoon of brown sugar to sub out the agave syrup and the chipotle sauce.

The last change I made was to dice and saute a pint of mushrooms with the turkey.  I saw a recipe once that used mushrooms to give the give turkey a "meater" flavor and I loved it and always do it now with basically every ground turkey recipe.

I accidentally dumped my oils into my sauce bowl instead of the wok...so I just tossed the sauce+oil into the wok and cooked the turkey in that instead of adding the sauce later. Still delicious!

I used sriracha for the hot sauce and the heat was very manageable.

This was quick, delicious, and healthy. I used a full 14oz bag of cole slaw instead of 8oz and doubled the sauce. I also left out the sesame seeds and served it with crushed peanuts on top. Will definitely be making this again and double the recipe for the whole family since this was only enough for 2 very hungry adults.

I added a couple of tablespoons of oyster sauce to improve the flavor.  I almost always make it with ground turkey.  It's a keeper of a recipe.

Meh.  If you need a pretty dinner for very little money or effort this is worth making.  Otherwise I'd say skip it.

Nothing like cabbage.  Cabbage is a great green.  If you want a bomb egg dish.  Take this recipe and put it either in an omelette or fritata (if you are a bad cook like me)
It is perfect for a keto diet and keeps well.  Add shredded chicken, or tofu crumbles or jack fruit for a moderate protein, high fat  nutrition dense fall back.  (Though I am not a no-carb fanatic. you could probably take out the sugar/honey/agave, and replace with carrots and jicama or mango,  or just keep it spicy.

BF loved it ad it was super spicy. Unfortunately I didn't feel there was enough flavor other than pepper for me. it was fast and easy though. I'll take a tip from this when I make my usual free form stir-fry and use precut slaw.

Great meal!  I added fresh mushrooms quartered. Used organic ground chicken and fresh carrots (julienned and lightly steamed). Will be adding to my weekly menu.

good simple recipe I didn't add the hot sauce as some do not like it so I added to mine separate .. easily changed up or substituted if necessary!!! I didn't use ground meat I had to use thin sliced pork as that is what I had and I did add extra veges to use them up...

I loved this!  

Excluded the red pepper and ground turkey.

Added around 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar.
Then topped the slaw with Aldi's chickenless breaded patties, sliced up.
Sprinkled with red chili flakes.

SO GOOD.  Rightfully named crack slaw.

I liked it, my husband loved it.  I didn't feel it had enough flavor, so I added heat to it.  I think I'd like it better with sliced beef, chicken or pork.  I'll make it again, and add extra flavor, maybe a little more ginger and garlic.  This can be tailored to any flavor, with any vegetables.

This was good, but not GREAT!!! as others have rated. I made it as directed except substituting brown sugar for the agave syrup. If I make it again, I would add more cole slaw mix ( our store sells 1lb bags- I would use it all) and maybe corn starch to the sauce to thicken it.  Overall, it was quick and easy and pretty tasty.

This was okay, but not terribly exciting. I made my own slaw from cabbage and carrots I already had. I'd like to add something to the sauce to make it zestier if I make it again.

It was okay, but there wasn't a "wow" factor for me.  The substitutes I used were a sweet red chili sauce, real maple syrup and lean ground beef, and I doubled the sauce amounts as per other reviewers' suggestion.  While it tasted fine, I'm not sure it's something I'd make again.

There are some good flavors going on here. I had apple cider vinegar on hand instead of rice vinegar, and that seemed fine. If I do it again I would use half the meat (and possibly chicken, beef or shrimp) or another bag of veggies as the meat seemed to be the star of the show.

My husband and teenage son loved it.  They did add some stir-fry sauce to theirs. It was so easy to make and open to substitutions if you don't have something or your want to make a change.  Great recipe to start with and experiment further if you want to.

It was ok.  Quick and Easy.  Great way to  add more veggies.   Left out agave but unchanged other than that.  Lacked flavor.

This was very a very tasty and easy meal that my husband and I loved.  Will definitely make again.  I couldn't find the chipotle hot sauce so I used regular hot sauce and added a tablespoon of adobo sauce from a can of chipotles I had.  I also doubled the amount of sauce and used a whole bag (12 oz) of coleslaw mix and it turned out perfect. Oh, also added 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes and left out sesame seeds.  Great dish!

This was delicious.  I shredded my own veggies, so I had more than you would with a package of slaw mix. I doubled the sauce, but used only 1 Tbsp. of hot sauce. My husband loved it. Since there are just two of us, we fortunately have leftovers and get to enjoy it a second time.

Love this! I make double the sauce and use brown sugar instead of agave syrup. I serve it with rice or noodles.

Decent recipe, but missing 'something'.   Hopefully someone will be able to tweek the recipe so next time I make it, it will be 5 stars.
