This is really good. Next time I'll cut down on the oil, you don't need that much. I put some dry ramen noodles on top for crunch. I ran the ginger through my garlic press, so I got the ginger flavor but not the tough pieces themselves.

This received mixed reviews at a ladies' luncheon.  Half of the ladies enjoyed it, and the other half didn't. It makes a lot and is very colorful, but you must love oriental/thai cuisine to like this, and must also enjoy raw cabbage as there is a lot of cabbage compared to the dressing. Even though I used packaged coleslaw and broccoli slaw (thanks to a previous reviewer's suggestions), still quite a bit of time and work was involved in making this. It was interesting, but I can't say I'd make it again.

Yum! I only used regular green cabbage, carrots, and onions for this one (only thing on hand!). I recommend putting the peanut butter in the bowl first and mix liquids slowly! (I splashed it everywhere trying to get it to mix!) I used white vinegar (less of it) and olive oil, and put in extra minced garlic and ginger. I like it to be thick and not runny dressing.   It was really good.  I think I would try this coleslaw dressing on chicken breast.

This was unusual and delicious, I served it as a side dish with mu shu veggies and it was a hit.  Beware, though, this recipe makes about 2 quarts of slaw!  Next time, I'll half it as it does not taste so great after day 2.

Great recipe!  I used the pre-shredded coleslaw mix and added shredded red cabbage and pre-shredded carrots.  I also tossed in mandarin oranges and chow mein noodles.  My friends begged me for the recipe!

Very Tasty & good for you! 

I halved the recipe but found the dressing too thick, so I added some sesame oil & a bit more canola oil until it got to the consistency I wanted. 

Also threw in some supermarket rotisserie chicken and voila - a wonderful light meal!  

Will definitely make this for my next party/potluck.

I simplified mine by using 1 bag of shredded mixed cabbage, plus 8 baby carrots, julienned.  I thought 2 red bell peppers was way too much - I prefer just 1.  I cut the dressing ingredients in half - perfect amount!  If you do that, be sure and let it sit for about 30 minutes before serving, or it will be too dry.  It's actually best the next day because the vegetables have had time to really absorb the dressing.  Thanks for the recipe!

I sustituted a bag of cole slaw mix for the cabbage. The sauce is overwhelming and will wilt the salad, so I'd suggest adding it to taste, per serving, just befor eating. I loved it. My friend sided with the 'overwhelming' for the sauce.

After making this recipe and absolutely loving it, I now find myself craving it!  I followed some of the suggestions of other reviewers and used brocalli slaw and regular bagged slaw, and fried some wonton strips for a topping.  It is a definate keeper for my salad recipe collection.  Everyone that has tried it has loved it.

Changes I've made to the dressing...EVERYONE who's tasted it demands the recipe!...Changes to the dressing as follows:  (scaled the recipe for 4, so amounts are for that)...add 1 tsp (dark) sesame oil, 1/4 tsp sambal olek (chili paste) (or up to 1/2 tsp to taste),change brown sugar to 2Tb, pinch ground ginger instead of fresh, eliminate garlic.  I don't use all of the dressing made...use just enough to lightly dress the salad ......Yummmmmm!!!!  I think the sesame oil and chile paste do the trick!!!  Chili paste does not make it hot/spicy, but gives just another "what is in there?!?!?" flavor layer....

The dressing on this is very good. I cleaned out my veggie bin and added broccoli, snap peas, jicama and even tossed in leftover couscous. Next time I will add a squeeze of lime, red pepper flakes and sesame oil. Thanks for sharing, this was really good!

Took this to a Superbowl gathering and got great reviews from friends.  I definitely recommend not putting on the dressing until time to serve.  I also made a few adjustments to the dressing:
Cut Soy Sauce to 2Tbs
Used 2 Tbs dark sesame oil and 4 Tbs vegetable oil instead of all vegetable oil.
Cut peanut butter to 4 Tbs and was still plenty peanutty.
The is an easy one and a crowd pleaser - give it a try.

This was a very good recipe. The first time I tried it, I followed the recipe. The second time around, I omitted the vegetable oil, as I find that the peanut butter (I only used half of the recommended amount) has enough fat in it to emulsify the dressing . I also added a dash of sesame oil and 3 big pinches of sesame seeds. After tasting the dressing, I thought it lacked a little on the sour note, so I added the juice of 1/2 lime. I made enough for 4 portions. I didn't have napa cabbage both times, so I used iceberg lettuce that I soaked in ice cold water for 1/2 hour to make it really crispy. It added a really nice texture along with the other cabbages. 
Will continue to make this again and again!

Made a couple of changes to this recipe to suit more of what I enjoy about "asian" flavors.  I substituted tahini for the PB, cut the oil in half using 2.5 tbls of light sesame oil, and .5 tbls of dark sesame oil for more sesame flavor.  I also substituted apple cider vinegar for the rice wine(didn't have rice wine).  I made a batch of the veggies, and a batch of the dressing.  Whenever I have some, I just lightly toss a serving of the veggies with the dressing just like you would with a salad.  The bite of the cabbage and the vinegar plays well against the savoriness and depth of the sesame and tahini.

This was very good.  I used olive oil and less of it than called for (as suggested).  I used super chunky peanut butter instead of creamy style for an added extra crunch, along with broken up ramen noodles (as suggested).  Everyone ate it, even the kids.

I loved this recipe!  It was delicious!  Definitely a great, simple, inexpensive potluck dish!  I agree that it is much easier using pre-chopped ingredients.

I love the flavor, but forget that not everyone else does. If you're a peanut butter "sauce" fan, this is an absolute hit.  Can do everything day before - chop veggies and make sauce - just don't mix until you're ready.

We enjoyed this. I normally buy one a costcos which is way to high in calories. Due to WW diet, I did a little adjusting. First cut recipe in half.  Only used 1 tbsp of oil, and used canola oil instead.  I also reduced the brown sugar and soy sauce to 1/2. Still was very flavourful. Certainly very close to the store bought one.

This is a family stand-by.  We've been using this recipe for 5 years, and my children love it.  It goes by the name "peanut butter cabbage salad" in our house.  The only significant changes are I use my blender for the dressing to make it nice and smooth, and I often decrease the amount of cabbage since we love the dressing.  Sometimes I only have one kind of cabbage, and while it's not as pretty, it still tastes amazing. I also don't always have all the other veggies, or have different proportions, and it still gets gobbled up by the kids. This is a keeper.

This was delicious. I did make a few substitutions: raw almond butter for peanut butter, 100% pure maple syrup for brown sugar, and olive oil for vegetable oil. I also had half of a yellow pepper that needed to be used, so I tossed it in with the red. It's a beautiful salad, and the flavors blend well. I don't like raw onion, but I went ahead and put it in (green parts only), and it wasn't strong at all. For those who thought the sauce was too thick and/or overpowering, the almond butter is much lighter and thinner (and healthier), but you still get that great nutty flavor.

This is excellent! I halved the recipe using a 1 lb. bag of cabbage, and added the cilantro and green onions.  So much easier this way.  Dont skip the cilantro and green onions- they really add to this.  I also cut the oil back in half, like others suggested.  I may cut it even more next time.  I may have added a tiny bit too much ginger though.  Still, this is a wonderful alternative to regular coleslaw. It is fancier and great for parties or barbeques.  Yum! (Edited 5/22/2010)

I used this recipe for the dressing only. I liked the flavor, but thought it needed a bit more sugar.  I didn't have any brown sugar, so I used white and I cut back on the oil per others suggestion.  I served this over shredded cabbage and broccoli.  I also added some chopped turkey to mine for a little more substance. The tangy egg salad spread I made today (also on this site) didn't fill me up. Thanks Bobbi.

Made dressing as per directions (with chunky peanut butter). For the veggies, I just used a 1 lb. bag of cole slaw mix, the cilantro, and the green onion. Very good, but next time I will add more onion (couldn't taste it) and some chopped peanuts for crunch.

Delicious! The dressing also makes a great satay sauce for chicken or tofu. I found that using sugar-free, salt-free peanut butter makes it taste more "authentic".

I've also made this salad and added cubed cooked chicken for a summer main dish. I've brought it to pot lucks and some people didn't like it, but most (including me) loved it. The people who didn't seem to like it weren't adventurous when it came to trying new things; some people are just too used to ordinary foods, so don't let that stop you (unless you or your family think the only good coleslaw comes from Kentucky Fried Chicken)!

Delicious. I used about 1/2 the oil called for to lighten it up and was still really good. The second time around, added a grated apple into the slaw and used some sesame oil in place of some of the vegetable oil, and that was great too (apples + peanut butter = yum!). I've also used the dressing as a more traditional salad dressing, for an asian chicken salad or similar. This one's a keeper, mostly for the dressing; the rest of the ingredients can be modified for whatever you have handy.

I don't review a lot of recipes but I just couldn't resist on this one!  It is absolutely delicious!  For someone who loves thai but is cutting out carbs, this is perfect (minus the brown sugar of course).  It is so versatile too, I've often used broccoli slaw in place of the cabbage.  And I'll add either shrimp or chicken breast and cashews or peanuts to make it a full meal.  Thank you for this totally awesome recipe!!!

I reduced the ginger significantly because experience has taught me that I don't like peanut butter + ginger. In moderation it's delicious, and this was terrific. Do be sure and use creamy peanut butter, because crunchy just looks SUPER unappealing in these types of salad recipes. Thanks for the recipe!

This is awesome.  Such a refreshing (lighter) take on the traditional creamy coleslaw.  A flavorful way to get your roughage, and easy too!  I just throw the dressing stuff in the blender.  It keeps pretty well too if you don't dress it until you eat it.

Wow. This was fantastic. The only change I made to the dressing was subbing olive oil instead of veggie, and using unsweetened natural PB. I let it sit for about an hour before pouring over a salad made with whatever I had on hand...red cabbage, orange bell pepper, sugar snap peas, green onions and cilantro, all sliced thin. I also toasted a handful of slivered almonds and tossed in right before serving. Amazing. One of the best recipes on this site.

I loved it, but I made for a casual dinner of 6 friends and reviews were divided from terrible to wonderful.  Made a 2nd time and took to work, again responses were all over. I think it is just a matter of personal taste when it comes to this recipe.

I love this recipe!  I'm addicted to Cold Sesame Noodles, and this lets me have the same idea without the guilt!  I jazzed it up a bit, by adding fresh lime juice. substituting the oil w/ 2 tbls peanut oil, 2 tbls olive, 1 tbls sesame, and 1 tbls chili oil.  You can mix it up to your taste.  I also used extra chunky peanut butter, and substituted 4 packs of Splenda for the brown sugar, for the low carbers out there.  I keep the sauce on the side, and pour it on as needed about 1/2 hour before devouring.  I also used pre-cut coleslaw mix with peppers and carrots already in it.  So Easy and Fanstastic!  I can't wait to make it again, and it will be in my fridge all summer.

Great recipe. I used prepared coleslaw for ease (saves a lot of chopping)!  We don't use peanut butter in this house, so I substituted all-natural almond butter. I used 5 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of chinese sesame oil instead of the vegetable oil. I garnished the top with some salted sunflower seeds. Sometimes I also top it with fresh cilantro if I have some on hand.  One note, if you like your salad crisp and crunchy, do not add the dressing until just before serving! That is my preference. The dressing has so much flavour to it that the "marinating" that other reviewers talk about is totally unnecessary.

This is truly a nice find.  Use a much pre-shredded veggies as possible to cut down on chopping time and it makes even more worth making again & again.

I've made this 3 times in the past month and even people who like their food plain and basic love it.  It's really simple to make especially  if you use the bagged coleslaw.

I will sum this up with one word..YUM! The dressing is the key, you would definitely use this dressing to a great cold pasta salad as well. I made a huge batch for a BBQ and did not have any left overs.

Excellent!  I made this twice last week.  My husband who won't eat cole slaw, had seconds.  My daughter loves the peanut butter.  Would be great with seafood on the side, or an elegant meal.  Nice colors and wonderful authentic asian flavor.

My review is mainly for the dressing. Following other reviewers' suggestions, I used toasted sesame oil instead of vegetable oil (that gives a more pan-Asian flavor) and added about 6 drops of lemon juice from the little concentrated ones you buy at the grocery store. Because my son is highly allergic to peanuts and we do not have peanut products in the house, I subbed SunButter (sunflower butter) for the peanut butter. 

 If you are making this salad, I don't think you need to stick to the letter of the law for the greens and veggies. Really what you want is at least a base of a crispy crunchy greens. Then add in whatever else you feel would go with a tart peanut-buttery asian inspired dressing.  If you want to go in the Vietnamese / Thai direction, you could serve it over a cup of rice noodles of some sort.

This was very tasty.  It's really good right after you make it, and for a short while afterwards, but is definitely not so good the next day and just gets worse after that.  Something about the peanut butter makes it pasty and unappealing the next day.

Good but would change the following--used less of almost everything to my liking:
Less Rice vinegar--4 TBLS;  
Half the oil (and use sesame oil);  
Less peanut butter--3-4 TBLS (used chunky);  
Used honey 2 TBLS instead of brown sugar;  
Less ginger--1 TBLS; 
Add some kick with red pepper flakes or cayenne or chili sauce with garlic.  
Add toasted sesame seeds to the top and a little lime.  I pureed the dressing before adding the ginger or garlic.

I cannot see how anyone would not give this recipe 5 stars. I believe the key to all the complaints regarding the heaviness of the dressing is setting it on the side and using it at will.

Everything is super fresh, and the dressing has enough vinegar to make it light enough. If it's still too thick for your taste halve the oil and add water to desired texture. This really is an amazing recipe.

I love this salad!  I used a bagged coleslaw to keep it simple then added chopped peanuts.  I personally think that's the key ingrediant for this yummy salad.

Oh my gosh!!  This is the recipe I was hoping to find.  I didn't have the red cabbage nor the nappa, so I used extra green cabbage.  It is so delicious that I am worried there may not be any left for dinner (I only made 1/3 the recipe mind you).  I am serving it with grilled tuna.  It simply couldn't be any better!

I thought this was a really good recipe. After I made it the first time, I made it again with some modifications. First, I was kind of shocked that thinly slicing a medium head of cabbage yielded more than 9 cups of cabbage! Second, I agree with one of the other reviewers who said that the recipe as written yields too much dressing. The dressing is really good, but you can cut the amounts in the dressing by half (but don't skimp on the garlic and ginger!), and you'll have plenty! As for the modifications, I substituted lime juice for half the vinegar and sesame oil for half the vegetable oil the second time I made this, and I thought it improved the flavor tremendously. Second, I mixed the dressing with the cabbage and other veggies so that the flavors could blend. In fact, I thought it got better the next day. Mixing the leftover portions with some rotisserie chicken breast makes a great Asian Chicken Salad!

Excellant! Made a double batch for a picnic and it all went. People loved it and went nuts over the dressing. It's smells and taste incredible with the fresh ginger, garlic and cilantro. I went a smidge lighter on the oil and subing just a little out for sesame oil. I also used only half the red bell pepper called for maybe because mine were large and it seems alot. The slaw part is very adaptable. It's the dressing that makes this salad unique and a freshing change of pace. Loved it!! Thanks RRITCHESKE! (*update* - made again using all natural peanut butter and thought because of the natural oil present it made the dressing a little too oily. stick with blended creamy peanut butter for best results.)

I liked the recipe but didn't plan to review until my kids were asking for seconds!  I only had red cabbage on hand, added green onions, chopped watercress, and chopped some peanuts too.  My 7yr old loved it, but he likes most things~ But when my 6 yr old loved it, I decided to review this!  For me, the dressing tasted better once it had 15 minutes to sit so the flavors could meld together better!  Save at  least the dressing recipe here~it's great!

I used 3TB olive oil instead if 6 TB veg oil and 1 tsp ginger instead of the fresh ginger as called for.  The dressing is fantastic and the 5 stars are really just for that.  I used a bag of 'broccoli slaw' and cut up some red pepers and cilantro instead of cutting up all that cabbage.  Will make again.

Fantastic!  I love the dressing... I think the dressing is really what makes this slaw so great.  I've made this a couple times - but mixing up the combination of salad items... using only regular cabbage with scallions and cilantro.  Another time using just red cabbage, shredded carrots and scallions.  Great each time!!  I will make again and again!  Thanks so much...

I had a asian slaw similar to this at a bbq one summer, and had to duplicate it! I am not normally a fan of coleslaw, so this is my new favorite bbq side to mix things up a bit! I always get huge compliments, and like others, I used the packaged broccoli slaw, cole slaw mix and shredded carrots for ease. Definitely mix everything right before serving, and I love adding some chopped peanuts and fried asian noodles on top. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good. I took it to a party and everyone loved it. I just used bagged coleslaw and carrots because that's what I had. This dish sat out all day and still tasted good, so I'm sure I'll be making it all summer. I also marinated chicken in the same ingredients as the dressing and ate that alongside the salad.

WoW...this was great!!!   I gave it 4 stars because I made some changes....Used pre-packaged coleslaw cabbage & pre-packaged brocolli slaw half of each.  halved vinegar (1/2 balsalmic & half white wine)..halved oil (1/2 sesame & olive)....since it's just me and my daughter..we made plent of dressing but only used the amount needed individually. (Had enough dressing leftover to make for lunch or snack tomorrow.) I added some chicken breast I had made earlier....This was soooo nice and lite.  No guilt about eating after 6pm.  Simple to make..but with flare and gourmet style!..And Cheap!! 

Very Impressive!!!

I thought the dressing was way to much for the lightness of the cabbage.The dressing by itself was pretty tasty but I substituted half peanut oil and I also put a teaspoon of chili oil in for a little kick. I would probaly make it again but cut the dressing in half and maybe marinate some chicken in it for another dinner.

Love love love this recipe!!  I use half sesame oil and half "regular (ie canola).  This coleslaw gets rave reviews wherever I take it, even my picky brother likes it - he said "Way better than regular coleslaw."

I am a big fan of Asian food.  I could eat that style of food three or four times each week and sometimes do.  But I've often wondered what sorts of salads might be appropriate as side dishes to the main courses that I enjoy so much.  Hey!  I just found one.  I prepared Chow Mein Noodle Casserole, which can be found on the allrecipes website, with this recipe as a side dish and it was THE BOMB.  Admittedly, this salad offers of somewhat exotic flavor, mainly because of the ginger, so it isn't one that will receive unanimous approval, but it is absolutely wonderful, in my opinion.  Is rice vinegar the same as rice wine vinegar?  I did not have rice wine vinegar, so I used 2 tbsp of rice wine vinegar and 4 tbsp of white wine vinegar instead.  This is a world-class salad.  Love it.

I was really excited to try this, but truthfully I was a little disappointed.  After reading the reviews I was careful not to add the dressing until just before I served it and now I wish I had put the dressing on sooner as it was better after it sat for a while.  Also, there were comments on too much dressing but I thought it wasn't enough dressing.  The dressing flavor was very good and the salad was pretty, but I probably won't make this again.  It was just "OK" when put all together and alot of work for just OK.  Plus I have  TON of leftovers!

I've made this several times. Quite tasty (obviously or I wouldn't keep making it!). To save time I use the bagged coleslaw mix (the type with all 3 kinds of cabbage). This works perfect with half the dressing. I always replace half the vegetable oil with sesame oil for an even more addictive flavor. Also - it's easy to turn into a quick meal with the addition of some grilled chicken breasts.

Fantastic!! I made this salad for a family barbeque, and though I thought the peanut flavor was a bit too much, everyone else raved about the salad. When I make this again, I may cut back a bit on the peanut butter. Such a great salad!

Absolutely fabulous!  I used pre-packaged coleslaw, chunky peanut butter, left out the peppers and carrots, and used a little less ginger (because I don't like it) and it came out so good!  I was sort of flying by the seat of my pants because I didn't have any measuring utensils, but even with approximations this is delicious.  Just like something you'd expect to find in a Thai restaurant.  I will be making this again, and again!

This is really delicious. I've been taking a cooking class with a Thai teacher, and this recipe compares favorably! I did add a few ingredients based on the cooking class: juice of a lime, a Tbs of fish sauce, a couple Tbs minced mint. I used one less Tbs oil than called for. If I'd had some peanuts I would have put some in. I think it would also be delicious with shrimp, or very firm tofu cubes.

Very good! I used broccoli stalks shredded in the food processor instead of the green cabbage. I also used half fresh basil and cilantro and subbed out half of the veg oil for sesame oil. I have made many variations of asian coleslaw but this was the first one with peanut butter. I liked it a lot. Some toasted sesame seeds would be a great addition. Served as a side for Asian Spicy Tuna Salad sandwiches also from this site.

This is the same as Chinese Cabbage Salad I -but that dressing contains no peanut butter and  everyone loves it.  Made this one yesterday and was a big hit - lots of raves from everyone - basic same dressing except adding peanut butter.  Nice addition.  I added cucumber, green onion and mixed nuts.  Am making tonight again and adding chicken for a main dish.

Delicious! I had something similar at an expensive Japanese steak house and haven't been able to forget it. This recipe is a dead ringer for that one at a fraction of the cost!

I was in a hurry, so I used pre-shredded coleslaw mix and halved the dressing, then tossed in a handful of crumbled ramen noodles. I could eat the whole bowl in one sitting!

Great slaw! To make things simpler, I used one head of regular cabbage and a couple cups of shredded carrots. I also used almond butter instead of peanut to make it slightly healthier.

This is outstanding! I added a little extra rice wine vinegar. I serve this at cook outs all the time-people love it. The only thing is you have to make it right before you are going to eat it, so I just prep everything and mix it all together before serving.

Used two bags of premade coleslaw mix to save time instead of slicing the cabbage myself and I only added about 1tbsp of oil. I also added sunflower seeds and about a cup of crushed pineapple. Great new coleslaw, thanks!

The only reason I gave this recipe 3 stars instead of 2 was because the dressing is going to be great on other things, like chicken or noodles. I used previous users tips and used 1/2 the recipe and used broccoli slaw. I found the recipe to be quite dry. Using half the oil when I halved the recipe made the whole thing taste like sticky peanut butter in my mouth. However, I am not a cilantro lover but it really did add zip to this coleslaw, and while the amounts for the garlic and ginger may seem huge, they are needed. I did not add enough and you could tell. I might make this again, but I would 1/2 the cabbage but use the entire amount of dressing. I would also add some crushed red peppers flakes to the dressing for heat.

My coworker told me that an Asian salad with a peanut sauce sounded good and that we had to find a recipe for it.  I couldn't find anything that sounded good until I ran across this.  I added two cups of cooked chicken and 1/2 cup of spanish peanuts, then garnished it with some fried won ton skins and we definitely have a winner!

this was great! I halved the recipe for the dressing and added it to a bag of simple pre-shredded cole slaw (just cabbage and carrot), yet it was just delicious!  I can't believe how good it tastes for how little work I put into it. Thanks!

Love this recipe, and so do all my kids!  I just buy the bag of coleslaw and bag of red cabbage, which saves a lot of time.

This was a big hit at a recent party, even with my husband, who likes neither cabbage nor peppers! I made the following changes: cut oil and sugar by half, used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy, used only half the dressing, and topped with chopped peanuts. A delicious and beautiful summer salad.

This recipe has become a staple around our house. We absolutely love it. Our main use of it is when we smoke a pork shoulder and make BBQ pulled pork sandwiches with it. Amazing!! The only thing I've changed is to take out the red cabbage and increase the Napa cabbage to 4 cups as I'm not a big fan of red cabbage. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

I adjusted the recipe for 4 servings and used a prepared cole slaw mix for convenience. Adding cucumbers is a MUST in my opinion. Really the recipe is a great jumping off point for all kinds of additions...chow mein noodles, cold spaghetti, mandarin oranges, sesame seeds, peanuts, Siracha hot sauce...all would be great thrown in! Everyone who has tried it has loved it!

YUM!  I used 2 packages of precut coleslaw for the amount of dressing in this recipe and it made a ton even for a big picnic.  I'll cut it in half next time.

Excellent, excellent excellent!  The dressing is very easy to make and can be used on just about anything.  I substituted powdered ginger (about 1/3 to the fresh) and olive oil.  This is my new favorite to keep in the fridge for a quick and yummy salad.  Or, as dipping sauce for the kids.

I loved this recipe and so did my family.  I put in less green onions and added a a bowl of crunched up ramen noodles (uncooked) on the table for folks to sprinkle on top.  Next time I'm going to add some grilled chicken.

This is awesome. Beware it makes quite a bit. I don't add the dressing to all of the slaw because I know we'll have leftovers. So just add to what you'll eat at that meal because it's best with the dressing just added. I made a few slight changes. I used one tablespoon of sesame oil and 2 Tbls olive oil. I also used 1/2 red peppper and 1/2 yellow pepper. Then I chopped some peanuts up and tossed some on top. It looked and tasted wonderful. What a great way to use up cabbage and all the peppers in my garden. Thanks for a great recipe.

Very tasty. I often make this for dinner, and nothing else. It's so good and light too. I use 2 bags of shredded green & red cabbage, chow mein noodles and slivered almonds. Sometimes I add chicken!

Wow, this knocked my socks off!!! I wish I could give it more than five stars! My only change was to add some rough chopped pecans and I liked the added crunch. I've been looking for a good Asian dressing for ten years and the search is finally over!

This was really a delicious salad/slaw.  I just cut up a small head of green cabbage; toasted some sliced almonds with a pat of butter; added about half a can of chow mein rice noodles and cut up a half a grilled chicken breast into pieces.  Didn't add bell peppers, carrots or cilalntro.  I only used half of the ingredients listed for the dressing (with only one tablespoon of ginger and one large clove of minced garlic).  I also added about a quarter cup of water as it appeared a little thick.  A teaspoon of sesame oil is what put it over the top!

This recipe was not one of my favorites. I found the mixture of peanut butter and cabbage to sound interesting, but tasted very bizarre. I must say that it was a waste for me to make because my family would not eat it. I guess that you really have to have a love for Asian flavors to enjoy this recipe. Was just a little too far out for me!

I recommend using a bit less peanut butter (I used 3 Tbsp.) for a better consistency.  I liked this a lot as a side dish for asian marinated seafood or terriyaki chicken.  Good with the addition of peanuts.  Do not mix the dressing in until you are ready to serve or the cabbage mixture will become soggy.  I used a mixture of bagged cole slaw mix, broccoli slaw, shredded carrots.

This was just "OK". It sounded wonderful, something unusual, but the taste didn't impress me or my husband. I made 1/2 the recipe, and still had lots of leftovers. It was "interesting", but I won't make it again. Thanks anyway, Bobbi!

Yummy Delicious! I have been looking for a cole slaw recipe similiar to one that we order at a local BBQ resturant (Wood Ranch BBQ-here in California). I think this is the closest I will get. And it's incrediable! The dressing is fan-tabulous! The slaw you can actually add-lib as you go. (I used green/red cabbage, green onion, a ton of cilantro, cucumber, and that's really it). Next time I may throw on some peanuts. Everyone looooved this!

WOW! What a great salad. Other than cutting the recipe in half, eliminating some of the oil and using grind-it-yourself peanut butter in the dressing, I followed to the letter and was glad I did. This was so yummy. As another reviewer suggested, the dressing would make great satay. Thanks Bobbie.

Great different recipe.  I too used chunky peanut butter and it was great.  I did not have fresh ginger so I added 2 T ground ginger.  Fresh would have been better.  Thumbs us from my 4 year old and my 40 year old.

Purple, oragne, red, green..this salad is beautiful AND delicious.  I must admit, I kept it in my "recipe box" for awhile because I thought all the chopping of the vegetables would be too big of a pain, but was it ever worth it!!  The peanut sauce is sooo yummy.  Try it!

This is an interesting twist on a "traditional" slaw.  I used one bag of precut coleslaw and one bag of broccoli slaw to cut down on prep time.  It is VERY GOOD!!!!!  I too used chunky peanut butter and tossed in sunflower seeds to add crunch to the final product.  I served on a bed of red lettuce leaves for an attractive presentation.  A big hit at the last barbeque.

This salad does involve a considerable amount of chopping but the results are FANTASTIC!!  I received rave reviews from my co-workers, and I am online right now running off copies of the recipe for several people who requested it.
SUGGESTION: I also like a little extra crunch, so I added 1/4 cup of chopped, dry roasted, unsalted peanuts, and 1/2 of a 3 oz package of ramen noodles (which had been lightly toasted). Just wonderful.

The peanut butter in the recipe is essential. BUT!! its very true that once you make this recipe it doesn't TASTE like there's any peanut butter in it. Also I found that mincing the fresh giger through the garlic press helped alot. Don't use pwodered ginger. Its just not the same. I loved this recipe!! one if the best I've found on this site

This salad is AWESOME! Soooooo tasty!
I did make a few changes to the recipe when I prepared it.
I used packaged coleslaw mix with cabbage and broccoli (cuts down on prep and chopping time!)
I also used crunchy peanut butter. I love the crunch to this salad!
I'm watching sugar, so I used brown sugar twin instead of brown sugar and couldnt taste a difference.
I also added some chopped green onions to garnish. MMMMM!
I'd also use this sauce with chicken satay for a thai-ish sort of meal. I'm going to be feeding this stuff to everyone I know!! Thanks saladrecipe.com!

I made this for a weekend BBQ and everyone raved.  This will be regular side dish for all summer BBQ's! A lot of prep work, but worth it.

My husband and I are addicted to this salad.  I have made it so many times since I found the recipe.  I made it to a T the first time, but have since gotten lazy and gone to the various bag cabbage mixes to save time.  I found some honey chipotle peanuts  we like to add to it.  They are a bit spicy, so hubby puts more on than me.  We have not changed the dressing as we really like it as is.  I do use olive oil because I don't buy vegetable oil. Give it a try and if you need a time saver the broccoli slaw you can buy in produce department  is so delicious and easy to use.  I noticed people saying it got mushy the next day.  I never put the dressing on the whole salad.  We just put it on our individual salads, so we can have it for days. UPDATE: We have been making this so much.  Time saver tips we like.. garlic in the jar, ginger paste in a tube, bagged shredded broccoli, and dry rice noodles in a can.  Makes prep so fast!

Excellent coleslaw. Definite Asian flavor but would compliment a variety of other dishes.

I left off the cilantro and Napa cabbage to no ill effect. I generally prefer lighter flavors and used one full head of green and a half head of red cabbage for an estimated total volume of a healthy 2 gallons (very roughly 32+ cups) compared to the 9 total cups called for in the recipe. The dressing, as written, was sufficient to thoroughly coat and flavor the entire slaw without overwhelming the flavor of the cabbage et al.

Very easy and fast to make. Some people balk at mincing the ginger and garlic. Do it. The flavor is not overpowering but critical to the overall flavor. Don't cheat and use dry. I find it far more efficient use of time to mince the ginger myself while I already have knife in hand, though, some prefer to pull out a (very very small?) blender for the task. Too much set up and clean up for me.

I've seen a few complaints that it isn't good the next day because it wilts. It's a coleslaw. That's the goal. In fact it wilts quickly. My two gallons of fresh slaw reduced to fit below the rim of a standard 6 qt mixing bowl in the hour and a half between tossing in the dressing and serving. However, wilted doesn't mean mushy and at 24 hours it still has its crunch. I can't speak to it lasting longer because I never have 3 day slaw in the house, but it should keep quite a while (longer of you ferment it) without losing its crunch.

We've made this several times. First time we followed the recipe exactly and it was a huge hit at work potluck. Subsequent times we have modified based on ingredients on hand (sometimes using green cabbage only or skipping red peppers). Every time it has been delicious! Depending on the number we are serving we have cut recipe in half or doubled. This one is best fresh as vegetables will wilt. To save time I usually prep veggies and dressing separately so I can just mix prior to serving.

Love the dressing for this recipe.  I make the dressing and use prepackaged broccoli slaw and/or coleslaw mix. I do add the chopped green onions, cilantro, and red bell peppers.  Yummy!  I always get asked for the recipe.

This was delicious!  The peanut butter is definitely the secret.  I took the lazy route and bought a bag of pre-chopped cole slaw mix from Publix and threw it in a bowl with a few tablespoons of peanut butter, about a tablespoon of rice wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons of sesame oil, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 tbsp soy sauce and lots of minced ginger and a few dashes of garlic powder.  DELICIOUS!

Excellent. Another recipe I can vary depending upon what I have on hand. Per my usual method, I double the garlic and halve the sweetener, and throw in whatever vegetables I have that need to be used up. The secret IS the peanut butter.

This was some of the best coleslaw I've ever made.  I used only green cabbage since that's all I had and substituted white vinegar for the rice wine vinegar.  It was delicious, we couldn't stop eating it.  About a third of the recipe should be enough for a family.  I served it with pork dumplings.

This is a wonderful salad to serve along with any type of oriental dish. I changed the proportions of cabbage slightly because I really like napa cabbage.  I also threw in a package of crumbled uncooked ramen noodles (threw away the seasoning packet) and some ground peanuts--I just wanted a little extra crunch in my salad.  I was a little short of garlic so I added some chili garlic paste to the dressing.  That also made it a little spicier, which is what my husband really likes.  I served this to my son's high school football team along with the Perfect Sesame Chicken from this site and the boys raved!

Delicious!  Easy enough to make.  Everyone liked it.  It is important to apply the dressing immediately before serving or it will become soggy.  The dressing would be wonderful on stir fry too.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

My new favorite coleslaw recipe!  I altered the recipe to serve 2-4 people.  I will definitely be making this multiple times this summer.  Plus, without any mayo or dairy ingredients, it is safer for summer picnics!

This was okay.  My mom enjoyed this, but I didn't think it was anything great.  I'd only make it again if she requested it.  I followed the recipe exactly for the dressing, but used pre-shredded coleslaw and I completely forgot to add in the cilantro.  I much prefer the Asian Salad recipe on this site.

This was so tasty and a very nice change!  I like using Napa cabbage so I only used that which gave me 9 c. shredded.  We were camping, so I just used 1 t. ginger and 1 T. garlic powder.  Used one red and one green pepper, no carrots or cilantro.  This was very, very good.  It does have a tan color to it that might not appear to be too appetizing to some.  I also used chunky peanut butter (our taste) and next time, am going to use shelled peanuts for even more crunch and texture.

I tasted something similar to this slaw one summer and I have been looking to duplicate it ever since. I followed the recipe except for I used all Napa cabbage and no peppers.  Loved it and so did my husband!  It would probably be good with even less peanut butter too. I served this with white rice and Kai Kang Dang (also on this site). Yum! Thanks:)

I used a bag of cole slaw mix, then cut the dressing recipe amounts in half.  I used a little less peanut butter and soy sauce.  I also added some water to thin the dressing out a bit.  Added some peanuts on the top to garnish.  Different and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is good but it does have a very strong flavor.  I would suggest cutting back on the soy sauce.  It's good but you can't eat a lot of it at any one time.  I would suggest cutting the recipe in half for 4 small-medium serving sizes.

Good  and easy. I  didn't even have everything  like fresh cilantro and fresh ginger/garlic and it still turned  out. It does need some crunch though  so ramen noodles might  be  a good addition.

I'm not sure if I should be rating this, I'm basing my rating on the sauce.  I used broccoli slaw instead and also made them into wraps.  Mixed the sauce with the slaw, green onion, cilantro, diced chicken and some chow mein noodles.  They turned out great, just wish I would have made more of that sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.......even though I didn't follow it to a T!

Great taste. Used broccoli slaw for ease, and put the peppers, carrots, green onions into my mini food chopper before adding. Kept the cilantro too. This made the recipe an easy one for a weeknight. Definitely needs only half of the dressing. Wasn't flat or wilted for leftovers with the broccoli slaw.

Delicious!  We loved it. I made a half-batch using a 1-pound bag of coleslaw mix. I used a combo of canola oil, unrefined peanut oil and sesame oil.  Added some sesame seeds and chopped pea pods too.  I made the dressing a few hours ahead and then tossed it with the veggies when we were ready to eat. Thanks for the great recipe!

i've tried a few similar recipes for asian slaw but after making this three times have decided that it's the best.  it's an awesome, flexible, and forgiving recipe.  the first time i didn't have red peppers or napa cabbage and it was still stellar. the second time i skipped the green cabbage and ran out of peanut butter and it still received acclaim at a poolside bbq of gourmet housewives. and this last time, i had all the ingredients but eyeballed the amounts and it's still fabulous.  black sesame seeds and cilantro make a nice garnish.

I just made this and it's great! Only change I made was I left out the oil in the dressing to make it a little healthier.

Absolutely delicious!
I only had Napa and red cabbage and it was fantastic.  I only served half the slaw mix with a bit of the dressing so that I could add more later if my guests wanted more but that I could keep it longer in the fridge if it was to be a leftover... glad I did as I have a bunch left in the fridge.. it is delicious with the sauce added right before serving :)

HUGE hit around our house--and this is coming from a sworn enemy of coleslaw/cabbage (my husband). The dressing is also delicious over broccoli slaw if you're short on time. Some chopped unsalted peanuts sprinkled over the top are also quite tasty. A tip: don't toss the entire mix of slaw with the dressing; let each person dress their own and you can serve this "leftover" for several days because the slaw mix and the dressing keep just fine separately.

Update: I still make this years later, only a favorite version now is to toss the dressing with a bag of broccoli slaw, some cooked chicken, and some cooked noodles (about 8-oz spaghetti) for delicious peanut noodles. I use crunchy peanut butter....

I've made this salad many, many times and it is always a favorite wherever I take it. And it is easy to make additions or changes to the recipe. It makes A LOT, so I generally keep the dressing on the side and add it to half the salad, then if I need more salad later, I add the rest. It isn't like traditional coleslaw, where you have to let it sit for awhile. It is good freshly poured over the cabbage.

This recipe was very good. Tasty and colorful. I only used 1 Tbsp of oil and added a dash of sesame oil. Omitted the cilantro (forgot to buy) and added chow mein noodles. Went very well with panko crusted pork chops!

Awesome recipe so glad I tried this! I brought it to a party and it was a hit! I did modify per other reviews with less oil, with water and using a little peanut oil/hot peanut oil. I also used more ginger and cilantro and added crushed red pepper and topped with cashews and mandrin oranges.  I do think this recipes is great just alone as I have made it that way as well. Thank you so much!!

I had to find a coleslaw recipe that didn't have mayo.  This slaw fit the bill.  Didn't change a thing and it was a big hit at our Memorial Day BBQ.
Everyone loved it.

I took this to a BBQ potluck occasion, and I didn't see everyone's reaction, but the bowl was empty when I packed up to go home! The dressing is outstanding. I used crunchy peanut butter in it, and I put it in a jar and mixed it into the salad when I arrived. I also used a bag of prepared coleslaw, a bag of broccoli slaw, and a bag of shredded carrots with the other ingredients. Very tasty. Thanks for a good one!

One of the better Asian coleslaws I've had.  The dressing was a little heavy, so I'd scale back next time.  Also added Ramen noodles for more crunch.

Although my husband really liked this, I thought it was barely OK. The dressing was too thick and totally weighed down the delicate cabbage and veggies, kind of a gummy  mess.  The dressing did have   great flavor but I think I might use it  with stir fried green beans or other hearty vegetable.

great tasting!  My family loved this but I did alter it a bit.  I substituted olive oil and only 2 T of it and added 1 t of sesame oil. Omitted the fresh garlic because I forgot it.  Added 1 can of sliced water chestnuts and about 1/4 c of toasted sliced almonds. Yummy!

I was a little disappointed with this one.  I will say that the presentation is great and it's definitely unique.  Unfortunately I thought that I could substitute this for rice or noodles with a teriyaki steak -- wrong!  Neither the kids nor my husband would eat it. The recipe makes a lot and we had LOTS of leftovers.  I thought it was o.k. - but couldn't eat that much and ended up throwing most of it away.

I love this recipe and make it again and again.  The only modification I make is to use more PB and less oil which is a personal taste issue, I believe.  We haven't have "ordinary" coleslaw since I discover this gem.  Thanks, Bobbi, for a really great recipe!

This was good, but came out a little too vinegar-y. Next time, I would play around with the peanut butter/vinegar ratio.

Good.I found that replacing vegetable oil with toasted sesame oil is more flavorful.I took egg roll wrapers and cut into strips and fried till crispy and puffed.Sprinkle on top of each serving.

This recipe makes a ton!  If you like a crisper coleslaw, definitely to not put the dressing on until the very last minute.  Mine sat for 15 minutes and it became very soggy.

CAREFULLY use a mandoline to slice cabbage quickly and thinly.  Speeds up prep and you get fresher ingredients than the bags of pre-sliced mentioned by other reviewers.

Used the ingredient scale provided and scaled the recipe to feed 30 people for my graduation party.  It was awesome and SO easy to make!  Even though it's way different from regular cole slaw, everyone thought it was great.  It compliments BBQ very well.  I will used this recipe over and over again.  Thanks!

I rated this a 3 because "as is" I didn't care for the PB dressing much.  I would rate it a 5 star after I fixed the Dressing.  That said...the salad is like colorful confetti.  A wonderful and beautiful salad for presentation.  Tasty too!
The dressing was thick, bland and peanut-buttery.  It just stuck to my mouth like paste and the kids didn't even like it.  Luckily I hadn't added it to the salad yet and so added 1 TBL garlic chili paste, 1/4 cup Healthy Boy sweet chili sauce, 1/4 cup teryaki sauce and some salt and sugar.  I would probably play with it even more, but this made the dressing much more pliable and pourable and eatable.

Wow! This recipe is so yummy! I had a little trouble figuring out exactly what to use for the rice wine vinegar...in my pantry I had red wine vinegar, rice wine, and rice vinegar...no rice wine vinegar... anyway I decided to go with the rice vinegar (since it said great for salads on the bottle) and it was just right.  I also used a 1 lb. bag of cole slaw mix (just the right ammount!)  I used 1/2 tbsp of ground ginger and 1/2 tbsp of garlic powder.  I also omitted the pepper and onions (we don't like either). I added some chopped roasted unsalted peanuts ~ and to top it all of I forgot about the cilantro!  Even with all of that this recipe was soooo tasty! I can't wait to share the recipe.  Thanks a lot!

I could make a meal of this dish alone! I forgot to add the cilantro, and it was still excellent.  Can't wait to try it again with the cilantro.  I used bagged cabbage, so it was really quick to put together.

Great recipe! It was exactly what I was looking for. I used pre-shredded coleslaw and added purple cabbage done in the food processor. I also used the food processor to mince the ginger and blend the dressing. It was easy and fabulous!

Absolutely wonderful! Served it with the Thai Breaded Chicken Fillets recipe (which was equally wonderful) as a second course. First course was your Cannellini Beans and Greens on Garlic Toast with Hot and Sour Shrimp Soup. It was a "hit" with my dinner guests!

What a wonderful twist on cole slaw.  This was a big hit in family, even with my fussy husband!  Try this taste-bud pleaser instead of plain cole slaw.

I loved this recipe, I will make this again for sure. I used packaged salad mix with romaine, chicory, broccoli red cabbage and cauliflower. I made the dressing as recommended with the only exception being That i used refrigerated “squeeze”ginger. Yummy! I used this to top wonton tacos. Yummy!

This was such a hit!  I really didn't alter much. I did read a bunch of reviews first and also cut the oil in half and used olive oil instead. I only had crunchy peanut butter so I put all the dressing ingredients in the magic bullet and mixed it. 
I used shredded cabbage and some broccoli slaw - saved some time and mess. 
I REALLY recommend adding the dressing slowly as you will be surprised at how much it covers and you don't want it to be sopping. 
Delish!

Made it for a church event and it was a big hit. It makes plenty.  I used crunchy peanut butter and it added an interesting additional texture. I I was tempted to add some sesame oil, but I'm glad I didn't.  Definitely worthy of an encore.

I made this pretty much as written, except I forgot the red peppers. They weren't missed; everyone loved this salad. Everyone at work asked for the recipe. As with most slaws, it doesn't keep very long with the dressing mixed in because it gets soggy (but still tastes great). If I knew that we would be eating on it for a couple of days I might keep the dressing separate. One thing I did different with the dressing was to add half the oil and I added both vegetable oil and sesame oil. This salad would be great with the crunchy Chinese noodles, add some chicken, almonds or sesame seeds...lots of possibilities!

Very nice twist on cole slaw - we loved the flavor!  I used packaged cole slaw - added some green and red bell pepper and some red onion, since that's what I had on hand.  I also didn't have creamy PB,  but knew we wouldn't mind the chunks of peanuts.  Will make again.

I added a teaspoon of  sambal oelek as I like a tad bit of spice. Omitted the cilantro because we don't care for it. Decreased the oil by 1 tablespoon.
We enjoyed this and also had it the next day. I didn't think it was too wilted as others have stated. I did add more shredded veg to the dressing than the recipe called for...maybe that made the difference. Will make again.

This is the slaw recipe I've been looking for. The only thing I changed is using just 1 tablespoon of brown sugar since I don't like sweet. It was just enough.  Made second time with sunflower kernels and it was so good. Everyone loved it.

Love this and will likely use the dressing elsewhere.  My modifications: little less oil, replaced half oil with sesame oil, more vinegar, a little less sugar and used maple syrup because it's my favorite, used bagged slaw mix with purple cabbage and carrots, added slivered almonds.  Loved the cilantro and red bell pepper additions but the dressing and slaw is such a good base you could probably get creative.  Thanks for a great recipe for a non mayo slaw!

Excellent!  Very good flavor.  Took advice from other reviewers and tossed it with broccoli slaw.  Served it with Ginger Glazed Mahi Mahi (from this site) coconut rice and sugar snap peas.  My mother-in-law kept saying how beautiful the plate was!

I enjoyed this coleslaw recipe and my friends did too! I agree with other reviews that it makes a lot of servings. I would recommend cutting in half as I had a party of 8-10 and had plenty of leftovers. I also made the night before and let the sauce set and thicken, pored of the next day and mixed well. I felt it wasn't too thick as other reviewers did. I would make again if requested.

I really like this, but I do think it is a flavor that one either likes or dislikes, and there is no getting around that.  It would be great with some baked tofu pieces or chicken added in.  Some chopped peanuts would also add good texture, or some crunchy noodles.  Pre-shredded coleslaw mix is definitely the way to go.

Great recipe..huge flavor...I actually used a Nutri Bullit for the dressing and emulsified the oil,vinegar and ginger along with all the other ingredients for the dressing...came out spot on.
It's a huge hit with my family now.

After reading the recipe & reviews, I immediately went to tweaking this recipe.  First, I cut the amount of cabbage & veggies in half (except cilantro, I doubled that.  Big fan) & still had more than plenty.  I used 20 oz. of bagged Angel hair cabbage & 12 oz. of Broccoli slaw.  I left the amounts for the dressing the same as I like a wet slaw (except the oil - I halved it & used sesame instead of vegetable oil) then threw in some Crushed Red Pepper for a bite of heat.  (Don't dress this salad until you're ready to eat it, though - that was a good tip.)  I also added a large can of those crunchy Chow Mein noodles & a large can of mandarin oranges.  Lemme tell ya - I took this to an Asian-themed dinner party & it was a HUGE hit.  This is one very UN-BORING coleslaw.  I'll be making it again soon!

Delicious!  Of course made a few alterations- left out the peanut butter completely (just a matter of taste and it was sweet enough without it), and used bagged cole slaw mix.  Halved the recipe as other suggested, and it balanced perfectly for the entire bag, it even stayed fairly crisp through the weekend leftovers.  Served it on a pulled pork sandwich, delicious!

I love Asian food so I was really excited to try this. Unfortunately, the result was an unappetizing brown sludge that was overwhelmed by the flavor of peanut butter.  Thanks, but I'll be looking for another Asian Slaw recipe.

AMAZING!!! I omitted the red cabbage due to personal tastes. For the dressing I did not add any oil and used a smidge of ginger powder instead of fresh and the dressing was fantastic. Added chopped peanuts on top for some crunch.  Will definitely make again...probably will add some grilled chicken to this for a main dish.

This salad turned out really well. I did not have all different kinds of cabbage so made less dressing to accommodate. Love the dressing. It would be great with pasta.

DELISH! And I didn't have ANY of the vegetables it called for (I had cabbage and cilantro; that's it). I had everything for the sauce and I just mixed in the cabbage and cilantro, and I'm telling you, I ate ALL of it! I can't wait to make it again. OH, and instead of plain peanut butter I used the Earth Balance Peanut Butter (crunchy) with Coconut oil (people...this stuff is ridiculously good), and it was amazing! I also didn't use all of the oil it called for (I made it for ONE person, and I used 1 tablespoon).

This was some good eatin!  Folks, I whipped this up exactly how the recipe stated and it went over very well.  Phenamonal! One has to consider what else you are going to serve it with because it is, well, "Asian" Coleslaw.  I paired it with fish tacos.  People were piling it on high.  One dear soul ate four heaping tacos, I figured she was only good for one.  Be Blessed, eat well~!

This is the best asian dressing I've made!
I substituted the vegetable oil and used sesame oil instead. That gave it more of an asian flair. I also added 1tbsp of Siracha hot sauce, added a lot more ginger (b/c I love the flavor) and only used 1/2 the peanut butter(so that its not so thick). Outstanding! The cabbage mix lasts a long time in the fridge. I served it atop some korean style tacos (used the Kolbe Korean meat from Trader joes). Big crowd pleaser

Loved this! I used packaged coleslaw mix for the green cabbage and carrots, and then just added sliced red cabbage, red bell pepper, and cilantro. The dressing is delicious! I would use the dressing on other things - maybe baked chicken or a regular salad! I do recommend NOT mixing the dressing with the cabbage until you are ready to serve because the cabbage does get wilty fairly quickly. I also added crunchy chow mein noodles on top. I think it would be good with mandarin oranges and/or raisins too. Everyone at the BBQ potluck loved it and ate it all. I had to send the recipe to six different people! It does make a lot. It was perfect for a BBQ but would have been too much for a smaller gathering. I would halve the recipe for just my family.

This is a really great slaw to take on picnics since is contains nothing that will spoil.  As a timesaver, I found out you can use 1 3lb bag of warehouse club pre-shredded coleslaw mix and the dressing quantity is the perfect.  Changes I made to the dressing (based on personal taste):  I used extra chunky peanut butter (nice textural crunch from the big pieces of peanut), I added 1.5 tbs Sesame Oil and 1 tbs chili-garlic paste (available in just about every grocery store) for just a little heat.
Makes extra, it's going to be a hit at your party!!!

My husband didn't like this...I didn't really like it either, and I couldn't even get my daughter to eat it. I believe the Rice Vinegar was a bit too strong and that was the problem. I don't think I'll be making this again, maybe a modified version, but not this way...Maybe if the Rice Vinegar was cut in half, it won't have such a strong taste.

We loved the flavor and so easy to make, but beware, the recipe as stated makes a TON!  10 servings is not a joke, at least.  Again, loved the flavor and I'll make it again for a potluck, but to just serve with dinner, I threw more than half of it out because it did not keep well.

My husband is meat and baked potatoes with sour cream down the line and he said, This is just plain delicious. And it is. I made half the recipe and he had three servings.

I made some changes as follows though I'm sure the original would be just as fine. For half the recipe ...

Dressing/I added a squirt of toasted sesame oil to the dressing, and used almond oil instead of vegetable oil, and only half the brown sugar.

In the salad I used two carrots, half of one red pepper, threw in some broccoli sprouts for added nutrients, used extra coriander, used six small spring onions including the greens, and no red cabbage (but only because we don't like red cabbage.)

Served with hake pan fried in a heaping tablespoon of grated ginger, chopped coriander and six cloves of garlic chopped. Done in sesame oil with a squirt of almond oil.

Enjoy :)

This dressing is awesome! I didn't follow exact directions, as I am only preparing for 2, and after reading several reviews, the result was delicious. I could put this dressing on any salad or use as a spring roll dip.  This one's a keeper!

I tried half this recipe with only pakaged coleslaw and none of the other vegetables. The dressing was not good so I tweaked it. I added lots of sliced almonds, hot curry powder, lime juice and white sugar. let sit until sugar disolves. You could even add some ramen noodles and the spice packet to the dressing. Yummy.

Great go to recipe!  I followed the instructions exactly (how else to you rate a recipe??)  and it was perfect.  I did use sesame oil for 1/2 the oil the second time, because I like the sesame flavor too.  Thanks for sharing this!!

Delicious. We made this as a light, family main course. We used olive oil and regular peanut butter. Hint: If you want to use two cabbages instead of three, the Napa cabbage and bag of cole slaw works well, and isn't too "cabbage-y" but perfect.   The red peppers and carrots take care of the colorful appeal. The cilantro and ginger make this dish smell heavenly.

I love coleslaw and hate mayo. This was a great take on one of my pot luck favorites. I would make this again definitely. It was a hit at the church picnic.

Great recipe!  I get compliments every time I make it.
I use broccoli slaw (has carrots in it) instead of cabbage and I don't put in onions or the vegetable oil (I agree with prior review that the peanut butter has enough oil in it)
I do add shelled edamame.

This is was wonderful!  I made a giant bowl full for dinner and am eating what's left for lunch.  Which is saying something because I only eat leftovers if I really like them.  Otherwise I pawn them off on my husband.

This was a very tasty slaw.  I really enjoyed the peanut butter and ginger taste.  I think nect time, I will use a bit less oil and less sugar.  It lacked a little bit of tanginess.  For the vegetables, I only used one kind of cabbage (green), grated carrots and a big grated daikon radish.  I also didn't use all the dressing.

Really a great change-up for slaw!  I've taken it to 3 different pot-luck events and everyone loved it.  I did make some changes to the original recipe, though.  I decreased the amount of oil to 2 tbsp due to other reviews.  Then, after tasting the finished dressing, I added 2 more tbsp of rice vinegar for a total of 1/2 cup.  This gave it a bit more zing!  I also tried a variation using parsley instead of cilantro because I knew one of my dinner guests didn't like cilantro.  The result was still a very interesting slaw, but a bit less pungent.  I like it both ways!

Tasty, quick and easy.  I used it to make a quick coleslaw to top my asian fish tacos. Was lacking alot of the ingredients, but made a third of the recipe, roughly using 2 tbs rice vinegar & p.butter, with 1 tbs each of soy sauce and regular sugar (out of brown). Added some garlic powder and drizzled in sesame oil to taste instead of the recipe's 3 tbs vegetable oil. Finished it off with white pepper salt to taste. It worked but next time with some grocery prep I'd add in some toasted sesame, chow mein or crispy rice noodles, and definitely include all the veggies. Add some chicken in and it could definitely be a good chicken salad. Next time I make it, maybe I will upgrade it to 5 stars.

I'm not a fan of mayo-based coleslaws, and so I tried this recipe...I loved it!  My husband also really liked it as well.  This is my first review on any recipe website, but really felt compelled to write a review for this recipe.

I only used 1/2 the oil suggested in the recipe and 2/3 of the peanut butter, and it turned out great!  Highly recommend.

Delicious!  My husband loved it.  I only used Napa and red cabbage and didn't use carrots because I didn't have any, but I think they would add even more crunch.

This is a great salad.  the original recipe is five stars, though what makes it a truly great salad is that it takes to variations very well.  I've added cucumber, radish, dry roasted peanuts and want to try adding edamame too.  Made without red pepper once as I didn't have any and I missed them.

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars! My hubby and I LOVE it! Only change I made was reduce vegetable oil to 4 tbl and peanut butter to 4 tbl to lower calories. Did not affect taste at all! Add dressing as you eat it to keep cabbages nice and crisp. Yum!

Wonderful recipe.  It was a great way to use up a bunch of red and green cabbage that I had in the summer from the farmer's market.  My husband (who is very picky) raved about this recipe.

Great recipe....I did make some minor changes however I substituted bagged cabbage, added some julienned red/yellow pepper, julienned carrots, and 1/4 slivered almonds. I also decreased the rice vinegar by 2T and will decrease the ginger next time as it waa a bit strong. Delicious slaw. Great for parties and summer get togethers!!

Yummy recipe!! I followed it to the letter with the exception of adding a bit of water to the dressing to thin it down as suggested by others.  I cheated and used bagged cabbage & carrots to help cut down on prep time.  I also bought the ginger "in the tube" that made it easy. Great recipe!

This is an awesome recipe!!!  I was not expecting it to be so good!  I had to substitute the vinegar for balsamic vinegar because it was the only one I had on hand and it was still amazing!!! This is the only coleslaw I will make from now on.

I used a pre-mixed Asian slaw packet from the store so maybe that threw it off a bit - the flavor was great and I'll definitely try it again cutting up my own veggies.

Very Good! I used a bag of pre sliced cole slaw it has all the different cabbages and carrots and green onions in it. Only takes about 15 minutes if that. Also those little bags of peanuts you get from Mickey D's with their sundae came in handy. One pack was enough. I also used red wine vinegar rather than rice vinegar.

I had only green cabbage and green pepper so that's what I used.  And I used crunchy peanut butter because that's what I had on hand and with everything crunchy, extra crunch wasn't going to matter.  I detest coriander so eliminated that.  To add some color I added chopped broccoli as I noted some other viewers had done.  I tossed the vegetables with the dressing just before serving - my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the salad.  I believe this is still basically the same recipe and thank the poster.  I will make it again.  It's certainly an inexpensive dish.

I had to make changes based on what I had on hand: only red cabbage, brown rice vinegar, agave nectar, fresh ground peanut butter, sesame oil and added sesame seeds and it was fantastic!  Even my 4 year old liked it, though I was worried it would be too "hot" for her with the ginger and fresh garlic (she likes almost everything--lucky me!).  I also let the slaw sit as opposed to tossing right before serving as I prefer the cabbage wilted.  Will definitely make again.

I LOVED this recipe and so did my family (except for my husband). My husband was the only one that was not a fan since he hates veggies and never really liked asian flavors. Just as others have mentioned, this recipe is not for people who do not like Chinese/Thai/Japanese food. Everyone else in the room finished up the entire tray.

Excellent!  I make this often.  Great with Sesame Seared Tuna.  The only change I made was to exchange some of the vegetable oil  for Toasted Sesame Oil.  This really adds to the flavor.

OMG! I don't care how my guests feel about this (they haven't even arrived yet) -- I could sit down right now and eat the whole bowl!  Hubby feels the same!  Used just regular cabbage (all I had) and no red peppers (out of them), but STILL it is just delicious!!  This is the best dressing I have had on an asian salad. Thank you soooooo much! I am taking this recipe to kids' retreat this summer - I am sure going to be the star!

This was excellent - Of the recipes that I was trying out for this meal, this was the one I was the least sure about, but it was awesome - I reduced the oild to 2T though, and added 1T sesame oil. I found without it the sauce was a little beat weak. If you had a gang that wasn't afraid of a little heat this slaw would be good with a little bit of chillis or hot pepper sauce. I also used packaged cabbage slaw mixture and broccoli slaw. It saved a lot of work and looked and tasted fabulous.

I must admit I'm a sucker for peanut sauce... this was AWESOME!  What a great twist on coleslaw.  Didn't want to buy 3 kinds of cabbage, so I used just green and red.  Otherwise, no changes, and none needed!

Would give this recipe more stars if I could . . . it's wonderful!  I couldn't find any Napa cabbage, so I used extra green & red and didn't add any oil (advice from previous reviews) or cilantro.  Added a handful of chow mein noodles before serving.  Everyone raved about it, including me!

This was very good.  I felt like it was missing a little something but still wonderful.  Would be good with grilled chicken on top, manderine orange slices, chopped peanuts or almonds.  Something along those lines.  I used a bag of pre-chopped cabbage mix.

All I can say is delicious!  I tried this recipe last week, and have already made it again.  It does make a lot, but in my house it goes really fast.  I slightly altered some of the quantities--more red cabbage, less green, etc.  Also, as my husband loves ginger, I added more of it (approx. 1/2 TBS).  With minor changes to suit our personal tastes, we both love this recipe.  We stored it in the fridge for about 3 days after I made it, and it lasted well.  The veggies were not quite so crunchy, but still very good.

This is without a doubt the best slaw ever!  I took it to my in-laws for dinner and my MIL (the slaw afficionado) raved.  I did use a little sesame oil in the mix to give a little more "Asian" flavor.  Outstanding!

I use the recipe just for the sauce because it is delish! I scale the recipe down and use crunchy peanut butter, which gives the salad a great texture. However, the salad gets soggy really quickly, but it's perfect for eating right away.

Love the dressing minus the ginger (eeew ginger)- I tend to shred cabbage and the add to it green onions and whatever crunchy veggies I have on hand-- I sometimes marinate some chicken thighs in the dressing and broil them and top the salad with them-- really yummy addictive taste..

This recipe is quite a bit of work, and received mixed reviews from my church group of 50.  It was very pretty but I got as many "didn't care for it" as I did "it was pretty good" - Won't do this one again.

This recipe was great. Even my children liked it! My husband especially loved it. It was a pleasantly different way to prepare coleslaw. I prepared and then served it beside the Asian Flank Steak recipe. They really went well together!

I made this because my husband is very picky about veggies and I figured the peanut butter would win him over. Just a note...go EASY on the dressing as a little goes a long way and can make three bites "enough" if there is too much on the salad mix. DH was not crazy about it and had only a few bites. I would add less PB next time. I liked the taste and will make it again. It also tastes like a sauce I had on soba/udon noodles at Big Bowl Restaraunt and would try it on noodles.

This salad is scrumptious and presentation is spectacular!  The chopping is rather intensive, even with a food processer, but the end result is worth it in my opinion.  Even the hubbie, who is not a huge vegetable fan, enjoyed it.

Very very tasty. The only modifications I made were: using 3T of oil and a lower fat peanut butter product called Better 'N Peanut Butter. I will definately make this again. Next time, I'll use bagged coleslaw mix, napa cabbage and the rest of the usual ingredients. I think I'll also try subbing a bit of the oil wth sesame oil or chili oil.

I have taken this to several potlucks and I always return with an empty bowl.  It is best when you use the three kinds of cabbage, but in a pinch, plain old green alone will do.

This sounded so good and had tons of great reviews but I was disappointed.  I'm not a picky eater.  I halved the recipe and used reduced fat p-nut butter, and used broccoli slaw instead of napa cabbage (cause I don't know(or couldn't find it) what that is)) that's the only changes I made.  But the dressing tasted too much like vinegar and not enough like p-nut butter.  Sorry

This salad is fantastic! I added some red pepper to the dressing to make it more spicy. To avoid any wilted leftovers, I doubled the dressing and put it on the side instead of mixing it in with the salad. Then, I topped it all off with fried bean thread noodles. This would make a good main dish salad with cooked chicken slices. Yum! I can't wait for lunch so I can eat the leftovers.

I made this salad for Father's Day and my husbad's family loved it.  It is very refreshing when you serve it very cold.  Instead of slicing the vegetables I shredded them in my food processor to resemble traditional coleslaw. I also added more cilantro than what the recipe called for, just because we really like it. I ate the little bit that was leftover with grilled chicken for lunch the next day.  I will make this again.

Very colorful! The green onions are really nice in it. However, it took me almost an hour to make it. It made more servings then the recipe said it would.

Take the shortcut and use preshredded coleslaw.  It makes this recipe quick and easy.  I then added the cilantro and green onions since I had them. I didn't really measure anything for the dressing, just eyeballed the measurements, whipped it in my mini processor and it was fab.  I  halved the dressing as others suggested but found the'slaw too dry, so I whipped up a bit more and it was perfect.  I agree about only using fresh ginger and garlic, it wouldn't be the same without it.  I also think the cilantro was a key ingredient, giving it a distinct Thai flavour. I too added the chopped roasted peanuts on top-Excellent!!! My husband loved this and I'll definitely make it again.

I must admitt that I didn't try the salad. I made the dressing with additional brown sugar (to taste) and sesame oil in place of the vegetable oil. Used a premade, "regular" salad, and tossed in some fried chow mein noodles. Took it to a potluck, and numerous people asked for the dressing recipe. Thanks!

This slaw disappeared - not a leftover!  It's rich in texture, colors and flavors.  I used only regular cabbage and it was fine.  I will have to make it again soon in hopes of using it in lunches.

This IS excellent-I've had a dressing recipe very similar that adds a bit of zip. Just halve, seed, and coarsely chop a jalepeno pepper then add it into your processor with the rest of the dressing ingredients. Hm-and I use honey instead of brown sugar. Anyways, REALLY yummy!

I just made this recipe for lunch, and it took less than 5 minutes to make!  I used the packaged coleslaw mix instead, and I omitted the chopped cilantro and bell peppers.  I also added half a package of crushed ramen noodles. Delicious!

I served this to 36 friends last night and it was very well received. I served the salad with chow mein noodles (the crunchy ones) on the side and a sprinkling of sesame seeds on top. Try it. You'll like it! This colorful salad is both beautiful and delicious!

True, it's different, but I don't think I'll make it again. I just don't prefer the taste of it over traditional coleslaw.  I used two bags of coleslaw mix.

Such a yummy, refreshing summer salad!  Pairs well with grilled chicken or pork.  I omit the green onions due to personal preference.  I have also tried this without the peanut butter because my boyfriend is allergic and it is just as good!

I loved the dressing!!! I actually used a pre-shredded bag of mixed cabbage, carrots, etc. I added the rest of the ingredients  and it was delicious.  I made the recipe to feed 4 and if I did it again I would make extra dressing.  Yum!

I followed the ingredients for the Asian sauce as directed except I substituted white vinegar. I only used white cabbage, carrots, and cilantro and then mixed it all up. It was perfect! I wouldn't change a thing! Next time I make this I'll be sure to buy the green onions and red pepper too! Perfect side to go with BBQ brisket.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I pair it with the Asian chicken thighs recipe from this site. I sub the thighs for chicken breast, let it marinate overnight, broil to cook, boil the remaining sauce for two minutes and add some corn starch to thicken then use the sauce to baste while cooking and finally toss the cooked chicken in remaining sauce. I cut into chunks and let chill. I make this awesome slaw dressing and mix that with bagged cabbage, the chicken, red pepper, green onion and top with wonton strips! A little of this dressing goes a long way. Absolute heaven!

I made this dish using Napa cabbage only as I had a very large head. Although it likely wasn't as pretty as the original recipe, it was delicious, satisfying, and different. I paired it with a beef and broccoli stir fry and the textures and flavors were pleasing. My son-in-law gave it a rave review!

This Slaw will go with just about anything, cant wait to try with pulled pork. Like other reviews I kept the peanut dressing and slaw seperate until ready to serve maintaining the crunchiness I'm looking for! I will try next with a dab of seseme seed oil ...... Awesome recipe!

A lot of ingredients, but it is delicious!  I used it for tuna steak tacos.

Needs sesame oil for real Asian flavor. Lime juice a welcome addition as was Sriracha. Balance any added lime juice with more brown sugar. Goes great with bulgogi beef in Asian tacos.

I asked my son if he would rate it 5 out of 5 stars, he said no, 200!  I left out onions and red bell pepper taking it back to be a bit basic and the kids have asked for thirds on the veggies tonight, thank goodness it makes enough to feed an army.  Pairs with Hawaiian chicken sliders.

Delicious!  I modified the amount as well as the veggies. I used green cabbage, celery, cucumber and it turned out great.  
Great tip to run the ginger through the garlic press!
I used very little oil and eye balled everything else.

I used the bagged cole slaw mix with purple cabbage and carrots instead of chopping all the different kinds of cabbages.  Everyone thought it was swell.

Easy and flexible.  I used 1/2 a red cabbage, 2 julienned carrots and 1 red pepper.  I used half measurements of the dressing ingredients and made the following substitutions: peanut butter for cashew butter (that's what I had at the time); added 2 tablespoons of Mirin sauce; squeezed a large half lemon at the end.  The cashew butter turned out to be a great substitute as it is more neutral on the palette and allows for all the other flavors to come through.  The sprinkle of lemon juice at the end also lightened up the taste.  My husband and I ate it served on tortilla chips...

I was emailed this recipe and asked to make this slaw for a family gathering with an Asian food themed dinner.  To be honest, I wasn't optimistic. I'm not a fan of traditional slaw. Surprisingly, this slaw with its amazing peanut, ginger, garlic dressing was out of this world and has become a staple in our home. My picky rarely-veggie-eating daughter loves it so I couldn't be more pleased as I struggle to help her eat well. I generally make twice the amount of dressing and sometimes wrap the salad in spring roll wrappers and Miss Picky brings them for her lunch. Delicious!

I used red cabbage only. It's what I had on hand. It really held up to the dressing well. I used half the amount of oil as recommended by others and used sesame oil instead. That really made a great Asian flavor. Added some shelled edamame as well.

This was refreshingly different!    I cut the oil by 1 T and added a little Agave just to sweeten the sauce a tiny bit.  Also added some coarse chopped cashews just before serving.

I like this recipe as an idea generator, but find the dressing overpowering as written. I use only 2 Tbsp oil, 3 Tbsp peanut butter, about half the vinegar, and add in a tsp of hoisin sauce, a tsp oyster sauce, and a Tbsp sesame oil. We use pre-chopped slaw and broccoli slaw, and dice onion to add as well. With these changes we love it. Thank you for a great base recipe!

First day: You need to be in the mood of oriental food otherwise it is too strong. After a day rest flavours were not that empowering, the creamy of the peanut took over and balanced all together.

Good recipe however you do not need to use all the dressing or you will end up with over dressed soggy slaw. I cut the dressing measurements in half and it still turned out well dressed.

I loved the dressing!  However, 2/3 of it was plenty for the salad (I am not a heavy dressing person).   I think next time I would use red onion instead of green onion for a little more tang.  I would also add some raw peanuts.  I used green pepper instead of red (since I had it)  red would have been better.

Absolutely love this Asian Coleslaw dressing/receipe.  It is refreshing and tastes like a pro made it.  I also love the fact the dressing stores well;  does NOT have to marinate with slaw and I can just add it to fresh coleslaw and serve.  I store the dressing in jar so I can shake it up after being in the refrigerator.  Just makes it easier for me.  
I have BP issues and a little of this dressing goes a long way stretched with white balsamic vinegar sprinkled over slaw.  This will be and is a classic/keeper receipe-have  received nothing but compliments on this receipe - Definitely a favorite!!!

Simple and delicious. I suspect the original was probably made with sesame paste rather than peanut butter. Either way, it's great

Made this as an accompaniment for honey Sriracha wings. They go great together, would have been 5 star, but a little heavy on the ginger, which personally I am not a great fan of, but my husband is and he said it was spot on! Great job on this recipe, thanks.

This was a great way to use a beautiful napa cabbage I got at my local CSA.  I made a few changes-I didn't have any green or red cabbage so I substituted shredded kale from the garden.  I used natural peanut butter (just peanuts and salt), reduced the oil and added a little water to thin the dressing. I also replaced half the oil with toasted sesame oil. I added a bit  of siracha for a little kick and topped the whole thing with toasted cashews for more crunch. Great on a hot summer day!

Awesome.  This is now our family's favorite cole slaw recipe.  I sprinkle sesame seeds over it right before serving.

I made this generally following the recipe with the exception of a few additions and deletions based on personal preference - omitted the  bell pepper and the oil in the dressing  and added mandarin orange slices and chow mien noodles.  I think toasted  almonds would make a tasty addition also. Since folks warned that the salad did not hold up well on a second day, I added the dressing to  portions as I plated them and stored the dressing and noodles separately from the vegetables.  Hopefully  this will help lengthen the freshness of the salad until it is all gone!

I like it, added some orange pieces to brighten it up a bit more. Next time I'll cut down on the oil and peanut butter a bit, maybe up the cilantro.

For oil, I used about 1-2 T of Sesame Oil, 2 T Coconut Oil (all I had that wasn't olive). SOOOOOO good! I also included Daikon because it's delicious. And I'm pretty sure I added extra Rice Vinegar, because I LOVE vinagerettes....and vinegar. (Cooking, with me, is so much NOT an exact science!) Also, a TINY splash of Lemon Juice would not go amiss. (I felt I had to because I had no onions OR cilantro to add to this.) But don't eat this on an empty stomach if strong flavours don't particularly like you. (raw garlic, raw onion, vinegar, lemon juice, raw ginger...)

One of the tastiest ways to enjoy cabbage! Great flavor. Great eye appeal (very colorful), easy to make. I think I will increase the dressing next time. I like my slaw a little on the creamy side.

The ingredients in this salad are perfectly balanced for all the different flavors.  I only had chunky peanut butter and it worked out great, in fact we liked the small bits of peanuts in it, also I only had regular green cabbage,  with these small changes it was still very delicious.  Easy to prepare after a day's work, does not need to sit long for the flavors to blend.

I really enjoyed this base recipe a lot.  Some changes that I made: Instead of using 6 Tablespoons of vegetable oil, I used 4 T of vegetable oil and 2 Tablespoons of sesame oil.  This gave it a much more distinct Asian flavor that I was looking for.  I also added roasted sunflower seeds, which helped with the texture immensely!  I also wanted to give it a slight spice, so I added crushed red pepper flakes.  Then to make this a main dish, I added about half a box of whole grain spaghetti to it.  I found there was plenty of the sauce for adding the pasta in to it, otherwise it would probably be too much.  All these changes really made it perfect!

I really like the dressing for this.   I felt the slaw itself was missing something,   I think next time I'll add some crushed peanuts and make this a 5 star!

This was absolutely delicious.  I followed recipe exactly as written but used chunky peanut butter I had bought by accident which I don't like as a spread on sandwiches, but loved it in this slaw.  I did add some toasted sesame seeds and red pepper flakes (sriracha would be good too if you like a kick).  Highly recommend this slaw...I could eat the whole lot of it.

Be careful, this stuff is addicting! And it's a recipe that can easily be changed to fit your tastes. I add a little sriracha to the dressing b/c I like that warm heat at the end. And, in addition to cabbage, I've also thrown in brussel  sprouts, kale, and almonds  with good success. Agree with reviewer, Sammarti, you can reduce the oil and never miss it. It's the peanut butter/soy/vinegar combination that really makes this delicious.

I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and whatever random vegetables I had on hand. It always turns out great because of the dressing.  I usually halve the recipe and whiz it up in a personal blender. Delicious!!!

This salad was really good, didn't knock my socks off, but made for an excellent side dish to an otherwise very greasy asian dinner.  The only recommendation I would have is not to dress the whole salad at once.  The leftovers got very soggy and weren't very good the next day.  

I did make this whole salad with Napa cabbage, just because that is what I had on hand.  I also added some chow mein noodles on top to give it an extra crunch.  Again, only add these right before eating, otherwise they will get soggy.

This is the best cole slaw I have ever eaten! It was the highlight of our meal ( with peanut chicken and sesame noodles from this site). I made the dressing exactly as written but used a bag of chunky pre made coleslaw with two different kinds of cabbage and carrot. This will be a regular in our side dish rotation.

My only changes were to add three sliced jalapenos (once dressed they add just a little heat) and approx. 1t of sesame oil.  I get the dressing fully mixed then add a little and taste, add a little more and taste.  I also used a Korean brand of dark brown sugar that's extra dark.  This was fantastic.  I bagged up the undressed slaw and will eat it this week and dress it as I go.  I'd definitely make it again.  It's beautiful to boot!

I'm so happy - this is almost identical to the Spicy Peanut-Cilantro Vinaigrette from Cheesecake Factory ! (they use it on their Santa Fe Salad)   Obviously I added some cilantro and a small amount of chilli- garlic oil and loved it.

Thank you Britcheske!

This was so amazingly tasty!  My husband ate this 3 days in a row and my grown daughter had to have the recipe.  I did make couple of changes/additions. Didn't use Napa cabbage.  I added some roasted pumpkin seeds, sliced roasted chicken.  Another night I served it on top of a bed of steamed basmati rice.  I used chunky peanut butter in the dressing because that's what I had.  The dressing is killer-I'm gf, so I substituted liquid aminos for the soy sauce.  What a great meal.  Can't say enough good things and I rarely ever review anything.

I think the sauce was a little on the thick side. Thinned it out with a little sesame seed oil and a little more vegetable oil

I used a bit of sesame oil along with the vegetable oil.  I love this cole slaw.  I usually cut the recipe in half unless I have a bigger crowd.

I followed the recipe disappointing.  I might try it again with less peanut butter. The sauce itself was great but when on the vegetables it just tasted like peanut butter.

Loved this recipe!!! I didn't have time to chop up all that lovely cabbage...I used a bag of already made cabbage and cut down most of the ingredients by half! 
3tbs of oil, 3tbs of rice vinegar, 2 1/2 tbls of Peanut Butter, 1 1/2tbls of Soy and 1tbls of ginger and 1tbls garlic and 3pkts of Splenda (looking for a better sugar substitute, that's all I had at the time)
I added shrimp for protein! Delicious!!!

I have been searching for a restaurant quality Asian inspired salad, and boy o boy is this it!!!
I have tried many recepies and many store bought dressings, but none of them have satisfied my taste buds like this recepie.  
I love the dressing its bold and it has depth. The salad has crunch, brightness and texture.  
The only change I made was to omit the oil.  I also sprinkled the served salad with crunchy chow mien noodles. 
I kept the dressing separate and added when serving to ensure crispness.
The quantities made enough for our lunch and dinner for 2 days.  For dinner I topped with warm chicken chunks. Delicious! 
This recepies is a keeper and will be a regular treat.

Super good! Although I didn't have all the listed ingredients (no bell peppers, and only red cabbage), it came out well. I used sesame oil, and omitted the brown sugar. Also added half a jalapeno, 'cause I wanted a bit of spice. The ginger and rice vinegar made it different. Will make again.

Very nice recipe even with the omissions and adjustments that I made.  I only used green cabbage.  Would have been prettier with the addition of red cabbage but the flavor was wonderful.  I cut recipe down to about 1/3 of a head of cabbage, 1 carrot (both grated), 1/8 c red onion chopped finely, 1/4 of a yellow pepper chopped finely, 1/8-1/4 c chopped cilantro, 1 garlic clove pressed, 1-2t of ginger, 1.5 T peanut butter, 2T rice vinegar, 1 T sesame oil (mix of toasted and plain), 1 T soy sauce, 1 T brown sugar.  Then sprinkled w/ toasted sesame seeds.  Totally forgot the green onions but was going to use chives b/c I had them.  I served this with Korean Short Ribs out of Webers Big Book of Grilling.  It was delish!

I liked this.  The peanut dressing is delicious.  The recipe make very large portions, so cut back accordingly.  Chopped salad vegetables will stay fresh longer if not mixed with the dressng, so only add dressing to the quantity to be used and the rest will keep in the fridge.

I like both the slaw adders of cilantro and green onions,though I used chives. The dressing is interesting,though I increased the soy sauce by 1/3. I was a little concerned the dressing would be overwhelming based on some comments,but I found it a good balance. I only dressed the salad we were eating tonigh, but have extra of both.

My favorite Asian Cole Slaw!!! I just add whatever I have, regular cabbage. The only thing I changed was decreasing the oil to 3 TBSP, 1 TBSP sesame oil and squeezing a lime in it. You can use crunchy or regular peanut butter and add some chopped peanuts to it for some crunch.

I used natural peanut butter that had no added sugar. 

We liked this a lot. Yummy peanut flavor.

Next time I would add some cayenne or sriracha.

completely Frankenstein-ed this recipe but it was still great! (had to since I didnt have everything that it called for)

first off instead of any of the veggies listed I used 1 bag of broccoli slaw & 1 bag of tricolor coleslaw (both were approx 14 oz) - plus 1/2 of white onion sliced thinly.

dressing alterations done by me this go around:
**most important - I doubled all ingredients!**

used almond & walnut oil instead of vegetable oil
added literally 4 drops of sesame seed oil
used 12 ginger root herbal supplement capsules instead of minced fresh ginger
NO cilantro since I hate it

I have made this recipe dozens of times for pot lucks and everyone raves about it. Usually one or two people ask for the recipe. I've never made it with napa cabbage, because I use what I grow in my garden. I think it tastes better with fresh cabbage from the garden. I've eaten it after it has been in the fridge for more than a week. It is not quite as crisp and the dressing is a bit watery but it still tastes great.

I loved this salad.  I cut the oil and vinegar by 1 Tblsp. and there was plenty of dressing.  Also I don't care for large pieces of carrot in a salad so the carrot was shredded.

I made a number of adjustments the second time around and it was even better (I tried to list them here, but ran out of characters).  Not being a fan of cilantro, I left it out.  Always being iffy with ginger I left it out as well (I was forced to anyway since Mariano's produce is sucking lately, and the piece I bought was rotted out).  Leaving either or both out still gives a slightly sweet and somewhat bitter dish. I agree wholeheartedly that you should toss the slaw with the dressing as you serve - the vinegar breaks the veggies down really quickly.

I halved the recipe, used seasoned rice vinegar, sesame oil ( a little less than called for),  crunchy peanut butter (loved the extra crunch it gave the salad), and Splenda brown sugar blend to taste.Otherwise no changes. My family loved this slaw and we will use this one again!

Love it! I cut the recipe in half. But so far I've only mixed half the cabbage mixture with half the dressing. I can't stop eating it! I didn't use any napa cabbage (just no room in the cart!). Will definitely will be making it again.

The dressing is exactly what you expect in flavor and consistency.  I'll try the healthier almond butter next time.  Instead of cabbage, I tossed in raw sweet potato with the red pepper, onions and cilantro.  The sweet potato is even better the next day and the colors are beautiful!  Slivered almonds add great crunch and visual appeal.

Easy and good. Went well with the Asian- style tuna dish I made. Would make again.

Absolutely delicious!  I serve it with the cedar planked salmon from this site and the brown rice medley I get at Trader Joe's.  Oh, I also add some sort of heat.  Usually sriracha, a teaspoon or two does the trick for my family.

The most helpful tip I have for this recipe if you don't have a crowd large enough to eat it all in one sitting: mix the dressing and the veggies but keep them separate. Dish out the veggie mixture into individual servings and dress them like a salad. The chopped veggies will last a couple days longer that way.

I was pleasantly surprised how delicious it was; will definitely make again. I didn't want to bother with three kinds of cabbage, so I just shredded a whole head of napa and it was great. Also, I made a mistake when making the dressing -- I grabbed a bottle of mirin instead of rice vinegar (they look so similar)! To fix it, I then added the correct amount of vinegar, but then it was too much and too thin. So, I discarded about 1/2 a cup of the mixture, and added a bit more peanut butter back in to thicken it back up. Honestly the mirin kind of added something I think, it ended up being very good dressing.

I love this slaw. One tip: I use packaged cabbage/slaw mix but, do not buy the package of "Angelhair Slaw". The cabbage is cut to thin to hold up to this dressing. This slaw makes a great as a main dish salad with chicken added. It is a lot of dressing for one package of slaw mix. I used the leftover dressing in a beef and broccoli stirfry. It was excellent.

Delicious and fresh. Prepping everything takes a little time but is well worth it. I wonder if the dressing itself would be a good dip for spring rolls?

I had tasted something similar to this recipe before and recalled the one ingredient this recipe lacks. Raisins. Add raisins to taste. You'll be glad you did. (And, as someone else noted, I also added a small amount of sesame seed oil, which should only be used in moderation.)

Very good!  I substituted two tablespoons of sesame oil out of the six tablespoons of vegetable oil just to boost that asian vibe.  Could also sub out the green or red cabbage for shredded carrots and/or onions if that's all you have in the fridge.  I'm tempted to add just a tad more peanut butter.

Added lime juice and sesame seeds to the mix.  Also decreased the oil & substituted sesame oil for most of it.  Used only Napa cabbage.  It was wonderful!  Will definitely make again.

Love this recipe. I wanted a recipe using fats that are good for you instead of mayonnaise based. This fills the bill and was delicious. I used cashew butter instead of peanut butter.

I am actually only rating the dressing portion of the recipe. I tried this recipe tonight but used a bag of Broccoli Slaw instead of the cabbage. I used one bag of the slaw and cut the dressing in half.  It was delicious! I threw in a few raisins and let it chill for a few hours before serving.
I served it with "Slow Cooker Honey Garlic Chicken"

Yum!  So happy to have found this recipe.  I used a container of prepackaged coleslaw and omitted the green onion (because I didn't have any).  I do not eat oil, sugar or salt, so I was nervous about making the dressing without that stuff - but it worked out great.  Substituted water for the oil and agave for the brown sugar.  Seriously yummy.  Threw some raw peanut halves on top.  Thank you!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this slaw.  I cut the recipe in half and didn't use the napa cabbage.  Instead I just used more of the head of green cabbage and some red.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It's a nice twist on basic coleslaw and a fancy addition to a meal.

Delicious! A complete hit at the weekend Korean bbq party. Will make this again and again! I think the cilantro and the peanut butter really kicked it up and I tossed in a small pinch of red pepper flakes. It was equally good immediately dressed and crisp and also after completely marinated several hours sitting out. Thank you for posting this!

Very, very delicious.  My husband doesn't like regular slaw so when I made pulled pork sandwiches and wanted some slaw with it I served this and it was just the right compromise.  It was so good with the sandwiches!  Unlike a few other reviewers, we found that it was just as good a day or two later.  I'd suggest tossing some of the dressing with the vegetables then reserving the rest as you'll want to have this on other salads later on in the week once you get a taste of it.  Have made it three times in two weeks already. Thanks for sharing this!

I guess I'm the minority here because this did not float my boat at all. After assembling the dressing, I knew I was not going to like this but hoped that after tossing everything together I would have a change of heart. Not so much. The dressing was just too savory for my liking (and it was VERY garlicky). Had there been a hint of sweetness to it, I think I would have enjoyed it MUCH more. NOTE: To save some time, I purchased small bags of pre-shredded green and red cabbage but since my grocer does not sell pre-packaged Napa cabbage, I had to shred that myself. My final change was to use matchstick cut carrots (found in my grocer's produce section) instead of slicing them myself. FYI: I knew that the full recipe would make a TON, so I scaled back. Halving this was definitely a smart move. I had some leftover slaw, but only a small amount (contrary to my opinion, my husband and parents thought this was OK). Maybe this will be a winner for you, but it didn't do much for me. Thanks anyways, RRITCHESKE. :-)

This was amazing.  Huge hit with a big crowd - doubled the recipe and there was literally not a drop left.    Shortcuts: Buy bagged cole slaw/cabbage mix for the green cabbage - then I just had to cut red cabbage. I also bought bagged carrots and added a bit more then the recipe calls for - gives it good color and texture.  Used the fresh ground ginger & garlic from the tubes which was also a time saver. I added fresh ground pepper to the peanut butter dressing - gave it a bit more dimension.  To finish it off I took a bunch of roasted peanuts and crushed them and tossed them in just before serving.

We loved this.  I kept the dressing separate until ready to serve.  And that way I could send it with my husband for lunch the next day.  I didn't have green cabbage, just red and napa.  Also, my husband doesn't like cilantro, so I left it out.  Very easy, except for doing the julienne carrots.  I also put some diced chicken in the dressing for a little protein.  It made a wonderful meal with a side of hummus and pita.

Great slaw - light, crunchy, zesty. Husband claimed it was the best slaw he'd ever eaten, and he's not one for undue compliments.

This was a huge hit!  It took quite a bit of time to make, but well worth it and will be made several more times over the summer.  We made it with the Asian Shrimp burgers in a pita.  It was a nice combination.

This was a pretty good noodle-less asian slaw.  For ease of mixing, I measured the dressing ingredients in a small bowl, nuked it for 30 sec. on half power and let cool while assembling the veg.  After tasting the dressing, I added a few drops of sesame oil and a few shakes of red pepper flakes.  Squeezing a lime over the slaw really perked it up, too.

NOTHING this high in sodium is healthy for anyone. Definitely go with a low sodium soy sauce, low sodium rice vinegar and low sodium peanut butter - salt tastes great and adds lots of flavor but causes a plethora of health poblems. Those with heart disease or Meniere's (my problem) know what I mean. Daily intake of sodium is reccomended to be less than 2000 grams per day - two servins of this recipe and you are more than halfway there!

Tasty.  I used almond butter instead of peanut and a mild olive oil.  I used a bit too much garlic and ginger, but it made me think that the garlic could use some light cooking and maybe the whole sauce would be better if it was warmed until everything melded and mellowed together.

This was very yummy. I made this with chicken stir fry from this site. I substituted half the oil for sesame oil and toasted some sesame seed to top off this salad. It was a big hit with my family. I will make again adding chicken or steak for an entree'.

I only had green cabbage, and so I used that for all three kinds of cabbage the recipe called for.  I also used green onions and cilantro, but did not have the other ingredients.    The dressing I followed to the letter except for omitting the ginger root.  Even with a number of ingredients missing, it was delicious!  My husband and I both loved it.

This is a great recipe and a refreshing change of pace from regular mayonnaise-based cole slaw. I only had regular green cabbage on hand, so I shredded it with carrots and  chopped green onions and then added the dressing. Sprinkling black sesame seeds on top added a nice color contrast and extra Asian flavor. This salad will become a new family favorite.

I tripled this and with automatic calculating it was so easy!  I did use half Toasted Sesame oil and half Peanut oil in place of the vegetable oil.  Also put chopped blister peanuts on top after tossing.  It was yummy!!

Made it twice in 2 weeks.  Both times gobbled up.  Kids love it because of the peanut butter.  Great alternative to traditional coleslaw.

Since it is just two of us, I cut the dressing in half, added the scallions and cilantro to the dressing and used most with bagged broccoli slaw. The remaining dressing was used as a sauce for pot stickers - amazingly good!

This was absolutely delicious and very easy to make.  I went the easy route and bought bagged cabbage/slaw mixes.  The sauce was delicious and would probably be good on an aisian noodle dish.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really great!  I used a bag of coleslaw and placed the rest of the veggies in a food processor.  One bag of slaw method requires you make the full amount of sauce listed.  I made this with the chicken satay recipe and added some cashews.

I have to give the recipe only four stars because I played with it a little. I did not have rice vinegar on hand so I used 2 TBS lime juice and the rest I used white vinegar. I was short on oil so I used 5 TBS oil and 1 TBS toasted sesame oil. I used 1 TBS Braggs and 2 TBS soy sauce. I omitted the cilantro because I am not a huge fan and used flat leaf parsley instead. I added slivered almonds as well. 

 This is a wonderful salad. The ginger and garlic make is zesty and the peanut butter makes it creamy. I am brining this to two parties this weekend and even if it is the only vegan/vegetarian thing there I will be quite happy eating a big pile of it.

Served this at a party and loved it.  Many people asked for the recipe - the few negative comments were from people who weren't cilantro fans.  I used a bit less oil than it called for and was glad I did.  Also, it doesn't save well, so don't plan for leftovers unless you keep dressing and slaw separate.

This is really good! The only changes I made were Bragg Liquid Aminos instead of soy sauce and powdered ginger instead of fresh because I didn't have any. I also added some toasted sesame seeds.

my changes: used grapeseed oil vs vegi oil, used liquid amino vs soy, and almond butter vs peanut butter.  This was very good and I'm not even a big fan of cole slaw.  Oh and i didn't put the dressing on until i was ready to eat it per serving.  thanks a bunch

This is my favorite coleslaw.  It's easier to use bagged coleslaw mix but if you have local fresh cabbage available take the time to use it!! It makes a big difference but is good either way.

I didn't want to have to buy three kinds of cabbage, so I just used green and red. It turned out really good. This will be on our repeat list!

I have made this a few times as a side dish to the Teriyaki Chicken (recipe on this site) and it is always a HUGE hit.  I use my food processor to shred the cabbage and keep the dressing on the side.  The cabbage lasts for up to a week in the fridge, which is great because I usually have a TON left over.  Great healthy snack!  Hubby LOVES it and adds grilled chicken and apples on top for variation.

My husband and I both thought this recipe was a fair at best. I have used other asian salad recipes that I prefer. It was a hassle to have to buy three different types of cabbage. Don't think that I will be making this again.

Pretty good, but you have to serve the dressing (which is EXCELLENT) when you are going to eat it or it gets too watery, which makes leftovers difficult and taking it places hard.

great recipe! i didnt have rice wine vinegar, so i used a combo of white wine and apple cider vinegar. turned out great! i also added some chow mein noodles at the end for crunch. i think that was nice touch thats worth a shot... i served it with asian BBQ flank steak and it was fantastic. thanks for the awesome recipe! its a nice change from ordinary coleslaw!

I reviewed this recipe YEARS ago but only with stars, not with comments.  I made this today for an office potluck and based on the rave reviews of my coworkers, it was time to add my two cents!!  This recipe is wonderful, but doesn't keep really well.  Luckily, when I make it for a crowd, that is not a problem!  I do tweak the recipe for ease of making by using one bag of coleslaw mix (with green and red cabbage and carrots) and one bag of brocolli slaw.  I also add a couple of teaspoons of Asian garlic chili sauce to give it a bit of heat.  It is delicious and is wonderful with additions such as chicken, chopped peanuts and crunchy chow mein noodles. Bravo for a great recipe that make me look GOOD!! :)

I first had the pleasure of tasting this delightful dish that was served to me by my sister-in-law Michelle.  This is a terrific recipe and now I am going to make it for myself with one twist.  I want to substitute Hot peanut butter. Yes,you heard it right!!  HOT peanut butter!  I think it will be delicious!  I love all things hot and paring the hot peanut butter with my favorite slaw should really be a winner!

I'm giving this three stars because the vegetable mix is excellent - colourful and tasty. However, I didn't care for the dressing. It seemed too rich and creamy, and some of the flavours (ginger, garlic) disappeared entirely.

Thank you so much, Bobbi!  This is just too good.  Since I like more dressing and my spouse likes less, we just add it to our individual bowls at the table.  A refreshing break from mayo or vinegar based coleslaws.  Definitely a keeper!

Made this for a group of 10 discerning appetites on vacation in West Virginia.  Needless to say, only one kind of cabbage was available up there in the mountains, but it was a hit anyway, alongside bbq chicken and macaroni & cheese.  Looking forward to trying it with the recommmended mix of cabbages.

My husband and I absolutely LOVE this slaw!  He doesn't care for peanut sauce as a rule, but this recipe has so many great flavors going on, it appeals to everyone.  I plan to take this to our next family gathering- I know it will disappear!

WOW! This is really a great salad - as stated below the dressing is outstanding, and the cilantro gives the salad a little extra kick. I will definitely make this again.

It is defiantly not your average coleslaw.  I love the Asian flare. The peanut, ginger and garlic…. How could you go wrong?  The dressing could be put on top of all kinds of dishes.  This salad, I would not change a thing. Make it from scratch, not a bag of coleslaw mix; it real does make a difference. A couple tips; peel and grate the carrots (julienne is nice but takes time); freezes the ginger and grate it (on the small side), the skin will come off on the out side of the grater.  If the flavor is to strong, just use powdered garlic and ginger in its place (to taste).

delicious - better tasting when made the day before you plan to serve it. I also used rice wine vinegar as recommended in one of the reviews.

I made this to take camping and it was a hit!  For ease I bought bagged coleslaw mix and it was still wonderful.

Delicious, easy-to-make, Versatile! I followed all the shortcuts everyone suggested here, used chunky peanut butter, omitted peppers, but did use the cilantro. Make and refrigerate (better with age).

This is a great salad. I made it three times this weekend, for three different potlucks, and it was devoured at all three. I topped it with chopped peanuts, and used chunky peanut butter.
