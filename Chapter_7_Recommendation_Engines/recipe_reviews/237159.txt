This is an excellent recipe, and I tweaked it a bit to my tastes of course.  Added a little taco seasoning to the cooked chicken and a little to the mixture before cooking. Instead of using canned corn, I used a bag of frozen (keeps from having to drain the can). Used the Rotel as others had suggested instead of salsa. Did not put the Doritos on the bottom, but put them on top for the last 5 minutes of cooking (on top of the cheese when adding it), because it keeps the Doritos nice and crunchy. We all very much enjoyed this!

As I do with all of the recipes, I read the Reviews first.  I made a few of the recommended changes and a few of my own.  My grocery store pulled two of their cooked chickens while I shopped - a great time saver!  I did not use sour cream, but instead used almost a full large can of cream of chicken soup, no cream of mushroom and instead used 1/2 of a big jar of Tostitos Medium Salsa con queso.  I too used the Ro-tel tomatoes but those with lime and cilantro and also added the Mexican shredded cheese. 

Placed about 2 pounds of chicken in bowl, sprinkled with chili powder and a spicy garlic/hot chili blend spice, dried cilantro and then added all of the above.  Lightly sprayed (with olive oil mister) the 13x9 pan and crushed Nacho cheese Doritos.  

Filled with chicken mixture and baked at 350 for about 25 minutes.

Removed, sprinkled more cheese and topped with additional Doritos (lightly broken) and baked an additional 10 minutes.

Served with a boxed garlic chicken rice pilaf that I added a small can of green chilis to and also used hot chili olive oil for the oil portion needed.

Everyone loved it - so glad I found the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I made this exactly how the recipe called. It was good but the only problem was the Doritos on the bottom were very soggy. I recommend adding Doritos on the top a few minutes after it's done for a nice cruch.

Left out the cream of mushroom, used white corn and added it when I mixed everything else. Very good and quite easy!

OK usually I make the recipe according to the directions and this is the first time I didn't follow the directions I didn't use the corn or the mushroom soup however I used rotel  tomatoes instead of salsa. I used 1/2 of a packet of taco seasoning. half a cup of milk and a half a cup of sour cream instead of one cup of sour cream their recipe called for it sounded too creamy for my taste. The results were delicious my son is a picky eater he actually asked for seconds and this is unusual when I make a new dish so I am reading this recipe a four star but like I said I didn't make it according to their directions

I made this tonight and it was so delicious! My family loved it too! I think it's a new family favorite. I'm sure I will make this again and again and again. I love it! I made some minor changes. I only had cream of chicken soup (don't like mushrooms) so I used two cans of cream of chicken soup. My husband doesn't like corn so I left it out. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was great! It was so flavorful and the perfect comfort food. Even my two year old loved it!

This is VERY good! My husband and 3 kids gobbled it up! I would maybe next time use half the can of corn, it was a lot in there. Maybe save some crushed Doritos for the next day when reheated to put on top for the crunch.

This is very easy to prepare and my family loved it. The only change I made was to use cheddar cheese because I already had it on hand. I did put out extra salsa, sour cream, green onions and black olives for topping this and served it with refried beans and Mexican rice.

It actually reheats well in the oven for using up the leftovers.  I think kids would be crazy for this casserole and do plan to remake this.

Great recipe! Will definitely use less salsa or rotel next time! Also used white corn for sweetness and worked out well! Added a little more cheese to the top and baked 10 minutes longer! Very gooey!!!

It turned out perfectly. I used salsa and natural sour cream which made it a bit tangier. Definitely a kid pleaser and if you are in the mood for something salty, this is it. If you are looking to cut out some calories it would be pretty easy to substitute ingredients. Fat free sour cream, no fat tortilla chips, reduced fat cheese...I would however I would not change anything because it was yummy. It would taste just as good with shredded beef or pork, very versatile.

Used hot rotel instead of salsa and crumbled the Doritos on top during the last 5 mins of cooking. Did not layer them at the bottom. It was good!!

Where shall I begin....No.1, WAY too much Doritos; No. 2, serves way more than 6 (I used a lasagna pan and an additional 9x 9  pan); No. 3, recipe calls for corn; but, doesn't include when to add (that was pretty much a no brainer tho).  The flavor was good tho.

I made this tonite and my family adored it! I followed the recipe to a t except i used a can of cheddar cheese soup instead of can of mushroom as my family doesn't like mushrooms. This made it creamier and cheesier and delicious. My family wanted seconds and thirds! Will make again. Next time ill try cool ranch Doritos

Family loved it, used salsa instead of tomatoes, no corn, cream of chicken soup. Fresh chicken breasts instead of canned. Added scallions. Bottom of casserole dish with Doritos then spread mixture on top. Added more cheese 5 minutes before it was done. Next time I’d add black beans.

I added some taco seasoning to the chicken. I left out the cream of mushroom soup. I added about another cup of cheese.  I split the Doritos, half on bottom and half on top. I also had to bake for 40 minutes instead of 25 to get it hot all the way thru. 

This was a very good casserole. I do think it could use another cup of chicken. Would be good as a dip served with chips too. Adding beans, olives, or jalapeños would be good additions.  It makes a lot so I hope the leftovers reheat okay?

My picky family LOVED it! Changes I made were to use Rotel instead of salsa, and I put a layer of whole chips in the bottom, then crushed chips in the mixture of chicken and other ingredients. I used just a few dashes of garlic salt to get a little more zing in the mixture. The old "Dorito Mexican Chicken" recipe just got replaced!

I would use less sour cream, leave out the corn, and mix the chips with the chicken mixture instead of on the bottom

It turned out good , however it would have been a nice appetizer, very strange as a main course. Next time I'll save the chips for dipping into this recipe.

This is my favorite recipe. Since making it for the first time 3 weeks ago I have made it a total of 4 times and absolutely love it. My 22 month old son loves it too. It is really a comfort food for cold winters in Maine! A must try for anyone who loves cheese and Mexican. I use mexicorn for the corn and so add a packet of taco seasoning to the mixture to give it more of a Mexican flavor. Super delicious and super easy!

OMG!  I have already made this recipe 2 times for my family and each time there was none leftover and for my picky eaters this is a miracle!  If you haven’t tried it I suggest you do immediately!  One of the best new recipes I have made in a very long time and with all the cheese ( I used nacho cheese Dorito  and Mexican blend cheese) it was the perfect combination!

I've made this a couple of times, using Campbells cream of chicken and/or herbs! My family and co-workers love it. The guys I work with actually eat it as a dip more than casserole.

Making this now.  Not for the first time.

Using left-over rotisserie chicken we froze a month ago, after I chopped it up, I added a chopped onion & sauteed it for a while with a couple tablespoons of 'taco seasoning' mix.

Then finished up just like the recipe calls for (I FORGOT the salsa, dang it, so that'll have to go on top.

Pretty delicious! Makes A LOT of food, so I would say it could serve around 20 people if served with chips and salsa. Corn isn't necessary but goes with the dish and adds more substance.

This was great! I used mild salsa and my picky eaters and I all loved it. I did sprinkle some more chip crumbles on top of the cheese for fear of the bottom chips losing their crunch, but the bottom chips didn't get soggy until leftovers the next morning. I didn't add corn. I also only put in half the sour cream because one kid doesn't like sour cream, the dish turned out fine and adding cold sour cream on the side was good. (The girl liked it even though she could taste the sour cream.)

Definitely making again! I changed this up some though. I only used 1 can of cream of chicken (no cream of mushroom). I also do not add sour cream but put on top when serving. I added a can of drained black beans. I add crushed Doritos on top for a crunch then another layer of cheese.

I wasn't too sure when I first saw this but I did make it using the exact recipe except I used a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes instead of salsa. This was really rich but very good. Wish I'd put more Doritos on the bottom. I did a layer but could've used more and I'll put a layer of crushed Doritos on top with cheese next time. I also added "tamed" jalapeños on top when I served it and it really added a little tangy pop. Will definitely make again!

This was very good.  I used ground turkey instead of chicken, cooked it in a skillet in some salt/pepper, cumin, and cayenne, before putting it into the casserole dish.  I topped the casserole with the cheese AND the rest of the crushed Doritos, and the final product tasted just like a taco.  Everyone really liked it, and every single one of us had seconds.  My reason for the 4 stars is twofold: personal preference (I don't like to eat mexican flavors more than once a month), and re-heating it with the chips kinda makes them chewy.
I'll def make this again, though.  Next time, I'll have scallions and sour cream to top it.  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe!!

As someone else stated, the directions did not mention the corn. I just added it to the blend in step 3 and it turned out great. My teenage boys loved it, of course.

My family loves this recipe. I have been experimenting with different types of Doritos. This is good no matter what kind you use but I think I prefer the nacho cheese Doritos. I also substituted another can of cream of chicken soup rather than the cream of mushroom. It just happened to be all I had in my pantry at the time.

This was delicious.  I had Frito chips on hand and used those instead and I couldn't resist adding a can of green chili peppers.  Was very tasty :)

It was ok but not something I would make again. Seemed a little dry to me, but could have been something I did wrong:(

so easy and delicious!!!!  I love that it takes few ingredients that I normally have on hand. And I love that you can make it ahead of time  and keep refrigerated and then toss into the oven before church.  My 3 teenage boys Love It!!

I used a can of rotel tomatoes instead of salsa, large can of cream of chicken soup, omitting the mushroom soup and 16 oz of sour cream. Little extra cheese.
Sheer heaven.

Between the salsa and two processed cans of cream soups, this was way too salty for me! I would probably use half the Doritos next time and find some way to reduce the sodium in the other ingredients, if at all possible.

Sooo good!  Definitely putting on our favorites list :-)  Made just as the recipe called but added a 1/4 bag of taco seasoning to mixture because I didn't have Mexican cheese blend.  Used shredded Colby jack.  Don't forget the corn!  It didn't show to add this in the directions and I was skeptical of how it would taste in this dish.  But it makes all the difference.  So glad I added it to the mixture.  Plus, add the Doritos to the top for the last 5 minutes of baking as others have said.  Will keep them crunchy.  I also put my last of the.cheese on at that time too.  Oh, and I used ranch Doritos.  Im wondering if it would have been too cheesy if I used the nacho cheese Doritos.

We loved this. Added sweet corn as someone suggested.  Would probably add more chicken next time and use Rotel instead of salsa.  But it was so easy and good - great comfort food.

This recipe was OK. I used Rotel like several others did. I used about 4 cups of chicken, otherwise it probably would have been too liquidy. I sprinkled some jalapenos over the top for extra punch and we crumbled a little extra doritos over our servings once we dished it up. We all thought it was nice for a change, but don't know if I'll make it again.

Very good! I used the rotel and as another reviewer suggested, put the Doritos on top so they would be crunchy. Even my super-picky 3 year old liked it! Thanks!

Made this tonight. Everyone loved it. Husband wants to add sautéed mushrooms next time. Very easy to make and little clean up afterwards which is a plus.
