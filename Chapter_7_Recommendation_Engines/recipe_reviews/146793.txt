What a great way to dress up an ordinary boxed brownie mix. I've made something similar in the past, only I'd make a Chocolate Irish Cream Frosting and while I do think it's good, I have to say this frosting is better!  Nice contrast between the light frosting and the dark chocolate brownie. It is a lovely frosting, buttery, fluffy and with just a hint of the Irish cream. I also like the idea of the sprinkling of toffee bits, for which I used crushed Heath bars instead.  This is, overall, creative and delicious but the frosting, in particular, shines. I plan to remember this one and use it to frost a layer cake in the future!

These brownies are spectacular!  I often find brownies with frosting too overwhelmingly sweet, but this frosting is a superb complement to the fudgy brownie.  It is light, fluffy and perfectly flavored with just the right amount of Irish Cream and coffee.  I used a Ghirardelli Triple Chocolate Brownie mix but the frosting was the star.  I cannot wait to wow my brownie loving friends with this recipe!

These were very good! The frosting is very sweet, but has a good Irish Cream flavor. Next time I will make half the frosting because you only need to skim the top of the brownies to enjoy the taste of the frosting as using the full amount was too sweet for me. I also substituted Kahlua for the brewed coffee in the frosting. After I brought the Irish Cream liquor, milk, and Kahlua to a boil in my microwave, I put in fridge to cool and thicken. I did not have a problem with runny frosting at all. It was the perfect consistency. I used a potato peeler and a Hershey bar to make chocolate curls on top. Will make again and again!!

Awesome brownies! I made these for Father's Day and everyone loved them. My dad said they were the best brownies he's ever had, and my 9 year old nephew really liked them too. I kept to the recipe and they turned out great. Thanks for this one!

I chose to make these for St. Patrick's Day.  They taste alright but for any other day of the year I'll stick with regular brownies.  I'm not crazy about the frosting and feel it might be better by adding cream cheese.  For the top I melted 1 oz. semi-sweet chips with 1 teaspoon of shortening, put in a sandwich bag, snipped off a corner and drizzled.

mmm, these are good!  I compared the directions for this to those on the brownie box and made some changes.  I used only 1 egg, 1/4 cup veg oil and then still a 1/2 cup of the baileys.  The first time I made these I used the suggested 9X13 and found the brownies to be too flat.  They were in for the recommended 30 min and the texture was off.  So next time I did a 9X9 pan and only had them in for 25 min.  Much better!  With the smaller pan size I also only needed half as much frosting.  In the frosting I reduced the sugar by half.

These brownies are different from the norm. Definitely a special occasion brownie. They were easy to make, but just a heads up - the frosting/topping is very runny. It needs to set up in the fridge before being cut.

Top Notch!  I eliminated the coffee because I didn't have any.  Also did not heat up the icing first, just mixed together and it was divine.

I've made the brownie with the icing exactly as the recipe calls for and it was good but so sweet that I thought my teeth might fall out. Just made the icing again but on choc fudge cupcakes, while the icing is a bit on the runny side, it is amazing on the cupcakes!

I used Ghiradelli mix, which is a couple of ounces smaller, but it still worked out. I halved the frosting because I made them in an 8x8 glass pan (which took like 40 minutes to bake), used Kahlua instead of coffee, and didn't boil the mixture first. I thought that the frosting was a little too "oreo-like" with the taste of sugar, but everyone else really enjoyed them and I was asked 2-3 times for the recipe. Personally, I'd try the brownies with kahlua instead of bailey's next time, and use one of my other frostings.

I ran out of Irish Cream while making these but they still came out great. I'm sure they will be even better when I use the correct amount of Irish Cream.

Great flavor and texture. I used Pillsbury Fudge Brownie mix. I did not change the recipe at all, but did not cook for 30 mins. Mine were done closer to 20 mins. I don't get the reviews saying they had runny frosting. Make sure the brownies are cool when you frost them, add a tablespoon of powered sugar at a time to thicken if needed and make sure to boil to irish cream mixture. I microwaved for several minutes and let it boil for a bit. Make sure not to boil too long through or you will end up with irish cream rock candy! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made the brownies (without the topping) for a St. Patrick's Day party this year, and everyone loved them. You could definitely taste a Bailey's flavor, but it wasn't overpowering and even the kids at the party liked these. No one I know likes whipped/spreadible topping on brownies (maybe it's a regional thing?), so instead of making the topping called for in the recipe, I used the Vanilla Glaze recipe on this site (and used part Bailey's, part milk for even more flavor) and just drizzled it over the top to make it look pretty. Will make again, thanks.

We have made these twice now and they turned out pretty well. We needed to double the frosting part of the recipe to get enough for the whole pan. We'll make these again. We used the Reduced Fat brownie mix.

I only made the frosting from this recipe to top the "Best Brownies" recipe from this site.

I boiled the milk, Irish cream, and coffee in a saucepan instead of in the microwave. I did have an issue with a film forming on the liquid (from the milk), which I had to remove.

I followed a suggestion from another reviewer and placed this liquid mixture in the fridge for about 2 hours before adding to the butter mixture.

I halved the sugar and I'm happy I did. It was just the perfect sweetness.

This made just the right amount of frosting - enough for a light layer across a 9x13 pan of brownies.

I liked the flavor of the frosting and it complemented the brownies well. I made this for a St. Patrick's Day potluck and they received rave reviews.

These are pretty good and I am not sure if the 1/2 cup oil is really needed.  I didn't make the frosting but I put toffee crumbles on the brownies.

I've made these brownies about 5 times now. Always a huge hit!  I just have trouble getting them out of the pan!  So I serve them in the pan and everyone circles around like a pack of hyenas cutting pieces out until the pan is empty.   Any suggestions?  I've used crisco, spray, and butter.  Nonetheless, they are fabulous!!

I made this with Kahlua and it was very good but I got the comment that is was too sweet. I ended up toasting some almonds and topping the frosting with them. It was delicious and cut the sweetness.

Very good, and very easy! I made two pans, one with Irish cream as the recipe calls for, and one with Amarula, and both turned out very well. I followed the recipe as listed, other than just mixing all the ingredients for the frosting together at once, rather than cooking the milk, liqueur, and coffee together in advance. The frosting itself turned out quite tasty, and would be a frosting that would also be quite good on other items. I also had no toffee bits or Heath bars to use, so I just melted some chocolate and decorated the top of both pans with the melted chocolate. I would most definitely make these again!

I gave this 1 star, not because they tasted bad, but because it doesn't deliver the Irish creme flavor at all. I made my own brownies that everyone loves instead of a box mix, but added the Irish creme liquor. Then made the frosting exactly as you are supposed to, but just tasted like regular buttercream. I even added extra Irish creme, but still nothing. I won't be trying these again.

Meh. Made these for St. Paddy's Day. The frosting is the best part, but by no means would I consider it the "star" of the show (it's good, but not "stellar-out of this world-good"). The brownie part tastes just like that - a basic, fudgy brownie (I used Pillsbury fudge brownie mix). The Bailey's added nothing to the brownie itself and was a total waste of an expensive ingredient, IMHO. I could detect the slightest Irish cream taste in the frosting. It wasn't overpowering in the least and complemented the brownie nicely. NOTE: If you do not have brewed coffee to add to the frosting (like me), Kahlua works fine. My only other change was omitting the toffee chips. I didn't have any and they seemed out of place anyways. After having tried many frosted brownie recipes, I've come to the conclusion that I prefer mine plain. Basic brownies are delicious as is. They need no enhancements to make them better. My hubs and I agree that when the craving strikes, we'll stick with what works best. Thanks anyways, Kim! :-)

Really good!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the optional toffee baking bits. I didn't have any so I just sprinkled the top with a little green colored sugar. Not sure about the purpose of heating the coffee, liqueur and milk. As it cooled, it made a scum on top that I had to remove before using. The next time, I would make the icing without heating the liquids first.

These were a huge crowd pleaser at work when I brought them for St. Patrick's Day. I, however, thought they were a bit sweet, but I'm not a huge sweets person.

This was moist and delicious. The Irish Creme liquor lends well to the flavors. I used a dark chocolate brownie mix, but a regular mix would have been better.

These are fabulous! I used my regular brownie recipe and modified it to add the liqueur, but it's the frosting that makes them wonderful. I didn't add the toffee bits and they were still great.

Really good and moist. a nice big batch. I didn't taste the Irish cream flavor that much, but it was a nice hint in the background. I think I probably had a stronger coffee flavor in the frosting--I used about 1/2 teaspoon of instant coffee flakes instead of a teaspoon of brewed coffee.

Delicious for St. Patricks Day gathering!....disappeared quickly!...used instant coffee for brewed coffee and followed suggestion using potato peeler on Hershey Bar and made chocolate curls instead of toffee bits. Next time I will cut the topping ingredients in half (did not use it all!).....and let the cake and icing cool a bit before spreading on brownie. Very close to 5 star!....Irish creme flavor was delicious....mmmmm! ;)

I thought these were ok, nothing too spectacular. I guess for all the good reviews I was expecting something with more flavor. Maybe it was because of the box brownie mix. maybe it received such high ratings because it is easy, just not anything that made my mouth go WOW! Thanks for sharing, maybe I will try these again using another brownie from scratch recipe

Great way to make boxed brownies special. Next time I would add a bit more Baileys to the brownie mix...the flavor was not all that noticeable. I used 6 tblsp. of Baileys & 3 cups of powdered sugar and skipped the coffee in for the frosting. I used a little less than half of the frosting for the brownies and the rest for the "Perfect St. Patrick's Day Cake" from this site. I also skipped the toffee baking bits and drizzled the brownies with chocolate ganache instead.....yummy!

Amazing!!!! These are dynamite. I used the No Pudge brownies because it only makes an 8x8 pan and it's only two of us. I also halved the frosting and it was a tad too runny for me so I added more powdered sugar. The brownie was super fudgy and tasted exactly like Irish Cream and the frosting was awesome too. Together they make the perfect spiked brownie!!

These were pretty tasty. The brownie came out very fudgy however I couldn't detect the Irish Cream at all and the icing made it a bit too sweet. Guess I would just do the normal mix next time!

I followed this recipe exactly, & they turned out sooo good! The only thing was, I only baked the brownies for half the time the recipe calls for. It may be that my oven runs a little hot, but I'm glad I checked on them or else they would've burnt. Also, I don't think a full stick of butter was needed for the frosting. Next time I make these, I will only use half a stick. & there will definitely be a next time!

These were wonderful.  The frosting really made them.  We are not coffee lovers in our house, so I just used an extra teaspoon of milk.  The frosting was sweet.  Next time I think I will make a double batch of brownie, so they are thicker and that will make a better frosting/brownie ratio

These are delicious! I made them for my friends for St Pats Day and they loved them. I also drizzled melted chocolate chips over the top by melting them in the mircowave, putting it in a bag and snipping off the tip. Will definitly make again! =)

These were a hit at my office for St. Patrick's Day.  Everyone loved the (strong) hint of Irish Cream in them.  I will definitely make these again!  Next time I'll try them with the toffee bits... didn't have any at home so I left them off this time around.

These were amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly as it is written.  I used the Betty Crocker Original Supreme brownie mix, which I think on it's own makes the best brownies.  The brownies came out fabulous, rich & chewy with a great Irish Cream flavor in the background.  And the frosting really made it all that much better.  I brought them to work today for St. Patrick's Day, and it isn't even 11:00 yet and they are already half gone.  I am not in love with the toffee bits though, I think I will probably leave them off next time.  They are ok, but I don't think they really added anything to the overall brownie.  All in all, these are staying in my recipe box and I will definately make them again!

These were not to my liking.  I was really looking forward to the frosting most of all because of a previous review but what a disappointment.

Too sweet - the sweet factor overpowered the Bailey IC flavor. I've made a lot of modified-mix brownies, and will go with other options than this.  I limited the total liquid to 3/4 Cup (not including the eggs), and the texture was what I wanted (not too dry).  The Bailey's was a nice thought... maybe in a scratch recipe where I can lower the sugar content.

These are tasty brownies that were  much enjoyed by the group I served them to.  I lined my pan with aluminum foil and greased it, so that I could lift them out of the pan to ice and cut them.  My only objection is that both the brownie layer and the icing layer were thin.  They have a definite flavor of the Irish Cream, especially in the icing.

I t was really good!  Loved the toffee on the top .  The flavor and texture were very good as well. When you add the frosting they become really rich brownies (that would be the only reason I gave them 4 stars),  They were pretty easy to make as well.  (I like to use O'Donnells Irish Cream from Aldi's to make these too.)

I needed a quick recipe for dessert and found this one. I used a gluten free brownie mix and added the Irish cream to it and mixed according to the box directions. I didn’t have time to make the frosting so I used a store bought buttercream frosting and added the Irish cream and some instant coffee granules (I heated them up according to this recipe and cooled before adding). I ended up using a little more Irish cream to bring out the flavor more. Overall the brownies were a hit and I will make this recipe again.

These are a hit whenever I serve them. The taste of Irish cream is subtle, but it makes a wonderful brownie. (They are better with Bailey's, by the way.) Men seem to just love them, but I just served them to a group of women at a luncheon recently, and almost everyone asked for the recipe. Note: they are even better when stored in the frig and served chilled.

YUMMY!!!! Made it for party and everyone ate them right up. I was running behind and didn't add the coffee just because I didn't have the time to add, but still super good.

Completely amazing! Used dark chocolate with chocolate chunk brownie mixture & added some dried mint before baking. For frosting, didn't boil milk & Irish Cream & used 1/2 tsp finely ground coffee beans vs. 1 tsp brewed coffee.

I made NO modifications... straight from the recipe and these turned out wonderfully!  These would be good with a Baileys Irish Cream Cheese Frosting too... I will try creating something like that next time.

These are fabulous! I messed up the frosting the first time, but remade it and it came out just fine. I only used about a 1/4 cup of toffee bits though. This is a great recipe, thanks!
