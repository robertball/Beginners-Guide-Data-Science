Everybody loved this juice!  I used 1 can mango juice and 1 can 'passion fruit, guava, and orange' juice and it tasted great.  Mangos are out of season so I only put in two and made up the rest with strawberries.  The red spiced it up a lot in color and the strawberries added a nice flavour.  This recipe makes a lot of juice and I had to scale it down.  I don't think I added enough vodka because it froze completely.  But once it started to defrost (I put it in some hot water to speed up the process) I couldn't keep my guests away from it.
