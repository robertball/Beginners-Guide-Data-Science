This recipe takes waaaaay longer than any of the times quoted in the directions.  I had to allow my first 1 1/2 cup of jello refrigerate for almost 2 hours just to becomesome-what firm then wait another 3 hours until the blended cool whip-jello mixture to become set enough to add the top layer.  I also ended up with three layers since every time I've made jello mixed with cool whip it tends to seperate...and this did.  I have no idea how they created the bottom layer in the picture.  Must have great food stylists because jello and whipped topping always seperate to some extent.  If anyone has ever made the jello Magic Mousse recipe you've witnessed this.  I highly recommend the Magic Mousse recipe.  I give this a three because you really can't ruin jello and cool whip.  It still tastes good.  I don't like strawberry jello so I used orange and when I mixed the cool whip in it smelled just like a creamsicle, and tastes like one too.

My first try the cool whip layer didn't harden in the given time, I gave it an extra 45min still nothing.  I ended up just saying the heck with it and putting them together regardless.  Unlike the previous poster I had no problem with the cool whip layer separating.  If I would've had the extra time I could have done the whole wait  to make sure it was pretty but I just didn't.  Next time I will start early in the morning!!
