This recipe has been a holiday favorite in my family for four generations!  While the ingredients may be unusual, the blended flavor is truly sensational.  The cheese lessens the tanginess of the lime jello, and the nuts (we prefer chopped pecans) create a nice texture.

This was good, but not the greatest. I think it is something that some people will love and others will avoid. My 14 year old couldn't get past the cheese.

I used to make this with lime jello, all the time. This time I used peach jello, omitted the sugar, and added cream cheese with the whipped topping. It came out great. I have also made this with sugar free jello, the low fat cream cheese, and low fat whipped topping. It was ok, but not my favorite.
