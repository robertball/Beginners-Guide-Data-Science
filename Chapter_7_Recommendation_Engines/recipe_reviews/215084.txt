This was a great soup! Female crabs are called "sooks" and fallis a great time to buy them cheap. You want to include the "coral" red stuff that is inthe cavities as well as the mustard to really get the flavor. It looks weird, but don't throw it out! I added an onion and a stalk of celery to this, because I've never heard of crab soup without it. Other than that, I used half water and half homemade veggie stock and it was incredible! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm from Baltimore and this recipe is the real deal. It's excellent! I added onion and celery because that's the way my mother made it. I prefer it w/o the barley, but that's just me. My mother said that if there was a thunderstorm while the soup was cooking that it would be ruined. I don't know about that part, but I've always kept it in mind! I like to add some local crab meat too.

Lifelong Marylander here and this soup was just perfect!  Tastes like real crab soup and not just some tomato based veggie soup with some Old Bay thrown in .  Thanks for the recipe. Keeper for sure!

I made this soup as best I could.  Whole blue crabs were not available, so I ended up having to use all pre-packaged blue crab meat (I used a full pound.).  I'm sure my soup wasn't as flavorful, but it was still good.  The lack of whole crabs also meant that I did not have any tomalleys to work with.  I also didn't pre-cook the carrots; I just added cut up carrots to the soup when I added the tomatoes and cabbage.  The soup simmers long enough to cook the carrots.  I also used fresh green beans, so I added those in the same time I added  the potatoes to be sure that they had enough time to cook.  I note that the recipe never says when to remove the ham bone or whether to cut off the remaining ham and put it back into the soup.  I did.  After about two-three hours of simmering, I removed the bone and returned bite-sized pieces of ham to the soup.  The recipe also never says whether to put the cooked bacon in the soup.  I assume you crumble the bacon and add it in towards the end.  Since I didn't have any tomalleys, I skipped the bacon step altogether.  As for seasoning, I used 2 T each of salt, black pepper, and Old Bay, as instructed.  I thought the finished soup had a bit of a spicy bite to it, so I may cut back on the pepper next time.  Even without the whole crab, tomalleys and bacon, it was still good.  I will try making this again when I can get whole blue crabs.

I am not from this area and have never tried this soup but I loved it and I am now a big fan!  I added chunked ham from the bone instead of bacon and used local (NC) crab and It was amazing.  my picky children loved it too!

Amazing! Skipped barley and potato. I'm from MD and this is the best. That is all.
