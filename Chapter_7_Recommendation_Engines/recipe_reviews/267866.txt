Worth the extra effort! A few tips:

1. Line your baking sheet with heavy foil, then spray with vegetable spray.

2.  The sauce will be thicker than you expect. It does not drizzle, but it can be brushed onto the butternut squash.

3.  You may need to adjust the roasting time, depending on how large your butternut squashes are. Mine was large and it took about 20 minutes more for it to get nice and soft.

4.  When moving the end result from the baking sheet to a serving dish, used to large spatulas and it will be just fine.

This was so delicious.   I changed the smoked paprika to regular paprika and used dried oregano instead of fresh. We loved it!!!

Epic fail! I could not get the squash to cut correctly. It went everywhere. It was very messy. I loved the sauce, though. I am going to try it again, but microwave the squash so the peeling comes off and easy easy to cube. Then I will roast or bake the squash and add the sauce to it.

Made no changes but had one ingredient we didnâ€™t like , we are thinking the smoked paprika.
