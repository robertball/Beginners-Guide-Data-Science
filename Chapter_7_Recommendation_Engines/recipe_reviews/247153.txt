No significant changes. I'll definitely make it again.
It will take less time to make after a little more experience.

it was ok, I'm not big on sesame dressing or teriyaki, but my son loves it so I'll be making it again in the future, lol.

I didn't make the recipe.....I had a lot of subs ....Ramen for noodles, couldn't get the toasted sesame dressing....used sesame and ginger dressing , marinated the meet  in dressing, garlic, teriyaki sauce to enhance flavors. omit the flavor  packet
 for ramen. the meat  used was round steak. This combo was very good and quick and very flavorful I will give the a 4 1/2 out of 5 Thanks. and always  Happy Cooking!
