this recipe is horrible, Im not sure if youve noticed, but there are literally thousands of barbecue sauces out there, it is very vague to just list barbecue sauce as one of the ingredients!

You may use any barbeque sauce that you want for this recipe. I typically use honey or brown sugar. They also exists many types of duck sauce, I use a duck sauce that is yellow in coloring and tends to have a sweeter taste...the brand I use is "Dai Day Duck Sauce"

Absolutely loved it! I followed the advice of the person who submitted it. I used a spicy brown sugar bbq sauce mixed with the reccommended brand of duck sauce (which will now be the only duck sauce i buy!). I cooked my ribs on the grill and then I glazed them with the sauce and cooked them a little longer. Scrumptious. Do try...don't be thrown off by the low rating!

We like a sweeter BBQ sauce, so we really enjoyed this and couldn't have been easier to make, especially since I usually have these two items on hand! I will be using this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
