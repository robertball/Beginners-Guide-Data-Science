I REEEEALLY wanted to give this recipe 5 stars because of the taste.  BUT,  They came out EXTREMEMLY overcooked.  I had 1/2" to 3/4" boneless chops and baked them for 50 min.(took them out 10 min's early).  The cheese (used vermont cheddar and provolone) got REALLY cooked.  I don't understand how everyone else's came out tender after an HOUR even if they had 1" or better chops!  I do plan on making this again, but I will only bake 35 min's. and I will add the second cheese 10 min's before it's done.  I crumbled the cooked bacon on top, then vermont cheddar, then provolone.  My kids really liked the taste and they don't like pork chops normally. I'm sure with the shorter bake time they will be FABULOUS!**UPDATE** I tried this again with the same cheezes, but cooked 25 min's, added the mozz/prov cheese and cooked for 10 more min's.  Came out FANTASTIC.  I used bone in center cut chops this time too.

My family, who are not big pork chop fans, really loved these.  I did make a couple of enhancements that were suggested by others:  I seered the pork chops in the bacon fat and used shredded cheddar and Jack cheese on top.  (Couldn't bring myself to use "cheez-wiz".) The chops I used were very thick (~1").  The people who said these were dry probably over-cooked them.  You have to be very careful with pork chops, they cook quickly and tend to be dry if overdone.  Seering helps to trap in the juices.  Anyway, we enjoyed these and maybe now I won't get faces and rolling eyeballs when I say we're having pork chops for dinner.

These are the very best pork chops that I've ever made!!  Awesome!!  They were very moist and flavourful and so simple to prepare (child's play, really).  I added garlic powder and black pepper and I browned the chops in the same pan that I used for partially cooking the bacon.  I lined the baking pan with foil before putting it in the oven for a fast and easy clean-up.  My husband and I both just loved these chops and I will be preparing them on a regular basis.  Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe!!

These were really good.  I took the advice of some others and instead of wrapping my chops, I chopped the bacon and topped the chops with that.  I also used cheddar instead of cheez-whiz...I just couldn't bring myself to use it.  I seasoned my chops with garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper.  Then I browned them in the bacon grease left from cooking the bacon.  Placed them in a baking pan, poured a small amount of beef broth in the bottom of the pan (hoping that would keep them from drying out), and baked for 30 minutes.  I pulled them out, topped with bacon and cheese and baked for 10 minutes more to melt the cheese.  My chops were tender and juicy.  They were exactly 1 in. thick, boneless chops.  They were not dry at all.  I recommend keeping an eye on them and not cooking for the full hour unless they REALLY need it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I haven't written a review in years but really wanted to comment on this one.  OMG!!!!!! I thought I'd feel like I was eating a heart attack but surprisingly that was not the case.  I didn't brown the pork chops as some reviewers did.  I put shredded cheddar on top because that's what I had.  And my only addition was about 10 minutes before done I put a little bit of Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce on top.  Next time I make them I will make them exactly as I did this time.  Give them a try...totally worth it!

I was kind of going out on a limb when I tried this recipe because I was having company over and I myself had never tasted it. Thank God it turned out awesome! I spiced it up by adding monteral steak seasoning to the pork chops before cooking them. I was not sure of the kind of cheese sauce to use so I used Ragu cheese sauce and we loved it. It is even better when you use the cheese sauce that is left over as a dipping sauce. My husband says this is a keeper and I agree. Thank you for the recipe.

So easy.  Very "American" with all the meat and processed cheese!  Delicious flavour.  Something kids and picky husbands would love.  I did too!

Best things in life are simple, just like this recipe! It is very rich in calories so we won't make it all the time but we will keep making it! I am sure the recipe as-is, is great. However I didn't have cheese sauce so I topped them with half a piece of sliced cheddar (sandwich cheese), and it was still great. Don't expect the bacon to wrap around unless you have silver dollar size chops, just lay it on top and don't worry about it! Super Recipe, thanks for sharing!

These were awesome!  I substitued some shredded colby jack because that's what I had on hand.  We had these for dinner a week ago and my fiance is still talking about them!  The pork chops came out very tender and juicy.  This wasn't the healthiest recipe so I wouldn't make it all the time.  But every once in awhile we like to splurge and I would definitely consider making this again.

This was really good. I did tweak it. I used 1" thick chops. I seasoned the chops with a sprinkling of cumin & garlic powder and then seared them in the bacon grease as suggested by other reviewers. I wrapped them in the slightly pre-cooked bacon and put them in at 375 for 30 min. The last 10 min I pulled them out and sprinkled a shredded cheese mix on top. My husband was unsure when he saw me prepping everything, but in the end he went back for seconds.

Love it! although we are bacon lovers so i made a lot more bacon, i don't know how much considering my husband kept eating it, but i wrapped the bacon around the pork chops as well as laying it on top, also i used cheddar and monteray jack cheese. This is a new family favorite. Even my 1year old was able to eat it, and he loved it!

This was okay, but I will never make it again. It felt like something was missing. I used shredded cheddar cheese, which I added during the last 10 minutes of the cooking time. It seemed like it needed a sauce or maybe some type of filling stuffed inside the pork chops. It was tender, though. As far as meat wrapped in bacon, I still prefer "Bacon Wrapped Chicken" from this site.

This recipe was inspiring for me! I did make a few changes and it turned out GREAT! First, I put a BBQ rub on my chops (I used 1/2" chops). I seared them in the bacon grease and put them in the oven for 25 minutes. In the meantime, I made a cheese sauce (melt 1 tablespoon of butter, add 1 tablespoon of flour, mix. Then add 1/2 cup of milk and wisk until tick. Add 2 slices of Velveeta) and crumbled 4 slices of bacon in the cheese sauce. After the chops baked for 25 minutes, I poured the cheese sauce on top and baked them for 10 more minutes - YUM!!!

My family LOVED this one, and it was so easy. I did make a few adjustments.. I also browned the pork chops in the bacon fat. Then I sprinkled them with garlic powder and topped with the bacon. I baked for 15 mins at 400. Then I added two tbs of Marzetti's Honey Dijon dressing and sprinkled with shredded mozz/provolone cheese and baked an additional 10 minutes. It was WONDERFUL! It reminded me of Outback's Alice Springs Chicken.

Yum!  Used liquid nacho cheese and it was great.  Seasoned the chops with garlic powder, pepper, and cajun seasoning as well.  Will make again.

This was a very yummy recipe.  I use swiss or cheddar cheese instead of cheese sauce and it comes out great.  I don't brown my chops beforehand.  I just wrap the bacon around them so the ends are underneath the chops.  Saves on the cleanup.

I seasoned the chops with salt and pepper.  I then took the advice of another member and browned the pork chops in the bacon grease.  I also sliced a half of white onion and placed the onions on top of the chops before putting them in the oven.  I baked for 40 minutes, then sprinkled the cheese over the chops and baked an additional 5 minutes

After following the directions to a T, I used velveeta cheese, and it came out SO burnt on top. It looked disgusting, but the inside was incredibly delicious!! It was so tender! Next time I'll cook the chops first, then when they're done, wrap them in the cooked bacon and spread the cheese on top. Thanks Ashley!

Tasted good and SO simple to make. I only baked for 30 minutes based on reviews and that was perfect. I just put a piece of American cheese on top instead of cheese sauce. Yum!

I really should have followed my instincts on this one!  I'm giving it three stars because the recipe came out well and I know there are double-Whopper with cheese  people who will enjoy it, but this recipe was not for me.

I followed the advice of several...seared the chops first with a bit of the bacon grease, adding garlic salt and pepper, and I used a sharp cheddar cheese because, like many, we don't have a cheez-whiz product in the house.

However, if you are looking at the recipe and thinking heavy, cholesterol, or "I don't like bacon and cheese together" then this might not be one you want to try because it is all that.  (I ate half a boneless loin chop and that was plenty.)

I believe next time I will go for more of a fruit or a tomato, feta, basil type topping for my pork chops.  I'm glad so many like this one, it's just not for me....but it's easy and I'm sure it's a kid pleaser!

I thought that it was delicious, but i burnt the bacon and i figured out that just the pork and cheese together was very good!

This was just Ono (Delicous). I wish I seasoned the pork chops like the other reviews but I totally forgot. So unlike anyone I stuffed my pork chops with Mozzarella and stove top stuffing. I will be doing this again but next time I'll add some pepper and just alittle salt on the chops before wrapping the bacon. Thank you!!!

I made it with thick cut peppered bacon and a shredded 4 cheese Mexican blend. I seared the chop in the bacon grease and it was very moist and had a hint of bacon flavor which is good because it was bland.

My fiance loved these. He is a bacon fanatic. Although slight tweak using real cheddar cheese chunks but they were still delicious.

This prep for this recipe was a little more unpleasant than I was expecting. I really dislike handling bacon and the smell of it when its cooking so I was a little put off at first. I made my way through wrapping the bacon around the pork chops and getting them in the oven. Once they were out an on the table they were a HUGE hit! Even our four year old liked them! I haven't had this moist of a pork chop in years. Very satisfied!

With a few changes this was wonderful. I make 2 chops and sprinkle garlic pepper on top of them then wrap the bacon after it was been lightly fried. Then I cook these for about 20-25 minutes or so then sprinkle mozz. cheese on top and cook another 10 minutes or so. They come out moist & perfectly cooked and delicious! My boyfriend loves them.

These wer sooooo good and so very easy! This was my first time cooking pork and I didn't have a meat thermometer so I left it in the oven for the recommended time and I think it got a little over done. Next time I make these I will keep a better eye on the meat and use a thermometer. They tasted great, my mom loved them so much and she is not a bacon eater. Will definitely make again. The flavor alone with the bacon is great, but it might be fun to experiment with some seasoning. I didn't have any cheese sauce on hand so I just topped them with parm. Also seasoned chops with salt and pepper before wrapping them with bacon. A keeper!

seems so wrong...tastes so right.  Can't be healthy, but sometimes you just have to eat for taste :)   We pan seared and seasoned them in bacon as suggested by other reviewers, and laid bacon on top.  Thanks for a great idea.

This recipie was so delicouse it's my husbands new favorit meal but I did make a few small changes that I think really helped; I lightly cooked the bacon so that its not raw but still very flexible then I browned the chops (like others sugested)in the same pan I cooked the bacon. I also brushed a thick layer of Original Diana sause on the pork chops befor putting on the bacon and after the bacon was on, I also added another layer of sause hafe way through cooking (the sause adds lots of flovour and stoped the bacon from burning) I held the bacon on the chops with tooth picks. I only cooked the chops for 35 to 40 min because mine were small and added gratted marble cheese right at the end just so the cheese could melt. Very moist and flavorful, a new favorit!

Very good. I didn't have time to cook the bacon on stove beforehand so I wrapped it around while raw and at the end of 25 min (my chops were small) I broiled it for 10 minutes so the bacon cooked completely. Very flavorful

Made again and cooked the bacon in the chop grease as suggested.  Also added mozzerella cheese to the chop/bacon at the end and broiled for 7 min.  It was again great, but I think I cooked it too long because the very middle of the chops were kinda dry

my family loved this dish, i altered it alittle. i put the pork in the pan and put a few peices of diced onion on top, then covered it with a slice of swiss cheese, then the bacon. then 15 minutes before it was done sprinkled cheddar cheese on top. it came out awsome!

I tried this recipe as it was. It was good, but needed more flavor and less salty "cheese sauce". I am going to put a bbq rub on my chops and sear them in bacon grease first, then lay the bacon on top of chops instead of wrapping them. Cook them for about 25min then add some 4 cheese mexican blend on top. cook for about another 10-15 min and try it that way. ( i used boneless center cut pork chops about 1/2"-3/4" think.)

Made twice, so far, and the family gobbled it up. I did crumble the bacon before I put it on top of the chops. Served them with green beans and applesauce. So good.

I went a little different. Take the other changes, pan brown chops and dice bacon. But after I pan seared the chops I pressed them into a equal mix of grated asiago chese, grated parm cheese and bread crumbs. Bake for 20 minutes and broil for 5 minutes. Super yummy!

I made this with some adjustments.  First, my pork chops were not 1 inch thick, so i decreased the cooking time to 45 min.  Also, i had leftover Alfredo sauce, so i used that as my cheese sauce.  I added to it some red pepper.  I served the chops over thin spaghetti that was also tossed in Alfredo.  The bacon didnt come close the wrapping around the chops, so i just cut it in half and laid slices on top. My boyfriend said he would definately eat it again.

My chops were butterflied 1".  I seared them in the bacon grease.  Set the "soft" bacon to the side.  I coated them with w/ Dale's seasoning, leaving 1/4" in the bottom of pan.  Seasoned both sides of chops with garlic salt and minced onions.  Then lay the bacon across in the shape of an asterisk*.  Baked at 350 for 18 mins.  Then added cheese (nacho/taco shredded) for the last 10minutes.  THIS IS AN ARTERY CLOGGER, but GREAT!  Chops were moist!

I seasoned the pork and seared it and put cheddar cheese and bacon on for the last 10 minutes, but I overcooked the pork so it was a bit dry.  This was very tasty though, and I will make it again, just not cook so long.

Very good and awesomely easy.
I wrapped the pork chops with bacon and cooked them covered for 40 minutes. Then I uncovered them and drained the grease and cooked for 20 minutes. This allowed the bacon to become crisp. Once cooked, I put a slice of swiss on top and let it melt. It was soo good.

followed the recipe to a tee.  Too little sauce to keep the pork moist. Mine was dry, and you couldn't even tell there was cheese sauce on it. 1 tablespoon didn't even cover the center of the chop.  The bacon didn't wrap all the way around the chop either....Very dry. Sorry not a keeper for me.

This was a simple and great tasting dish. It was very heavy so this one will be used on a light rotation. The only problem I had was my cheese got a little too brown on top. Next time I would wrap the bacon over the cheese.

I tried this but made my own cheese sauce with colby jack cheese. It came out really good. Has a great smell to it as it is being cooked as well. I think I'm going to experiment with this recipe with different kinds of cheeses. But, I will be using this recipe again. Thank you great dish my family loved it.

This recipe is alright but the pork was so over cooked it was hard to enjoy.  I suggest baking for only 45 or until your meat thermometer reads that they are cooked and also rubbing some garlic and pepper onto the chops before wrapping in bacon.

I was on the road in Louisiana and cooked this one night in a Residence Inn with what I had on hand.  Since I didn't have cheese sauce I opted for some Tostitos Salsa Con Queso...I used some cayenne on the pork chops and it came out pretty tasty, I'd definitely like to do it again, but now that I'm back up in New England I'll go a little less southwest and use vermont chedder

This was ok, but rather bland. I seared the chops as some other reviewers recommended, and I used 1" chops which I baked for 45min. They came out tender, just not very flavorful. I used Ragu double cheddar sauce. I think real cheese would have been better. The pork needed a dry rub of some sort.

Awful. It was way too much. This was like, to quote my husband, a giant fat sandwich. I could only manage a couple of bites. My husband ate about half of his, but it made him sick. Even my one-year-old pulled his out of his mouth and threw it onto the floor. I won't be making this again.

The recommended cook time for the chops was a bit long. Also, I'd highly recommend using  a real cheese, or if you are dairy free because of a milk intolerance, trying a smear of goat cheese if you can tolerate it.

I wasn’t impressed but everyone else likes it so I gave it 3 stars. I did sear them with the bacon fat, I didn’t over cook them they were still moist but the meat seemed tough to me. Maybe I’m too critical? I would give them a try but use a meat thermometer 60 minutes I think is way too long.

The process is ok, but it's important to note the thickness of the recommended chops.  Mine were thinner and came out VERY dry.  Also, there is no recommended seasoning (which is ok) but I do recommend that you do something to your chops before following these cooking instructions.

Instead of cheese sauce... I made a glaze that consists of molasses, water, brown sugar, cinnamon and bbq sauce. Tenderize the chops by stabbing with fork, brush glaze on both sides, the wrap with uncooked bacon. Sprinkle salt and crushed red and black pepper over them lay on cookie sheet, at 25m flip over and brush more glaze. Put back in oven for 25more min. Take out oven and brush again with more glaze!! Absolutely delicious!!! Served well with sautéed veggies and mashed potatoes

I love it! Wish I could've given 5 stars, but I made a few adjustments. First, I used shredded mozzarella and cheddar cheese, but at the 30 minute mark it was a little too crispy than I had hoped, so I took the pork chops out and thankfully they were cooked all of the way through. I also threw some onions in the bottom of the Pyrex pan for flavor, as well as a little dash of bacon grease. I'm definitely be making this again, but next time I'll be putting my (real) cheese on after the pork has been in the oven for about 10-15 minutes, then let it finish cooking. It was still delicious!     **Side note. . Don't let your bacon get too crispy when you cook them in the pan, or else they turn rock hard in the oven!! Next time, I might just defrost the bacon and let it cook with the pork chops.

LOVED IT!! Had 2 boneless 1" thick round pork chops that came already wrapped with bacon from the store. Put them in baking dish and added about a quarter inch of water in bottom that I sprinkled some garlic powder into. Sprinkled some garlic powder on one, and the other some Lawrey's mediterranean herb seasoned salt. I baked them for ONLY 30 minutes. Put a round slice of provolone cheese on top and stuck back in oven for 3 minutes, just long enough to melt cheese. YUMMY!! Even kids asked what smelled so good! Lot's better than the Shake N Bake I used to always make, and so juicy and tender! Both seasonings were good, but the Lawrey's herb one was my favorite. This could a very versatile recipe!

Substituted the Cheese sauce out for Famous Daves Hot & Sassy Barbeque sauce... BOOM! EXPLOSION OF MASSIVE DELICIOUS PROPORTIONS!!

ALSO: after I wrapped the Bacon around the pork chops, put a couple pinch fulls of Brown Sugar to sweeten these things up... Words cannot describe the amount of delicious these things are! My taste buds will never be the same...

I see thick cut pork loin on sale at my corner grocer all the time. This is something that'll make taking advantage of those cheap cuts of meat as something you can turn into a savory and delicious meal. I used the "Cheddar Cheese" sauce concentrate from the soup aisle out of the red and white can. Make the sauce according to the directions on the back of the can but keep it cold and mix the milk and soup in a bowl with a whisk. Coat the chops with a "BAM!' spice of some type. Cook thick cut bacon first about half the time you normally do. And then quickly sear the loin chops in the bacon drippings 2 min each side. Then, cut the bacon in half and lay the strips side by side over the top of the chops placed in a baking dish. Then, pour the prepared cheddar cheese sauce over the top till it is halfway up the side of the chops; make sure to coat each of the chops generously. I baked for 45 minutes at 350 and it was dellish.

I browned the chops in the bacon grease then baked for 30 minutes with the cheese and bacon on them. The chops came out perfect. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because I did not like the flavor of the processed cheese with this dish. Next time I will try sliced or shredded.

maybe I did something wrong??!  The reviews sounded wonderful, I had to try it.  It just didn't turn out as great as everyone said.  The best piece of advice that I read was to line the pan for easy clean up....I don't think I will try this again.

I altered this for time put salt & pepper on pork chops grilled them. One piece of bacon to each pork chop broke in half and put only on top, then put shredded cheddar cheese baked about 20 min and then broiled for 3 minutes. I enjoyed it!

My family loved this dish what a simple recipe and easy to clean up if you foil line the pan. I did brown the chops in the bacon drippings before baking and did not add cheese of any kind (husband hates cheese)This will be cooked again in my kitchen, thanks for a great recipe.

Who knew you could make such a great dish with only 3 ingredients? I used pepper jack cheese for mine and my husband's and cheddar for the kids. I thought I made enough for lunch the next day but both of my kids had 2nds! And the greatest thing about that is my 2yr old son does usually eat meat unless it's mixed in with something! I will definately be making this again soon!

This is the best way to cook pork chops I've ever tried! I season (Nature's Seasons or salt & pepper) the chops on both sides before wrapping them for extra flavor. I don't put on any cheese, but instead dribble some extra bacon grease on them before sticking them in the oven. Probably not healthy... But oh so good!

This was very good.  I was not too sure about it when I first saw it.  If you like pork & cheese you will love this.  I added some onion slices on top of the pork chops before I added the bacon.  They were great.  I will make it again.

nice recipe.  reading some of the other reviews a jazzed it up a little bit. i seasoned the porkchops and seared them in the bacon grease first. i wraped the porkchops with 3 slices of bacon (kinda big pork chops) and cooked them for about 45 mins, then i put shredded montery and colby cheese and let them go for another 10-15 mins so the cheese didnt burn.

Excellent Pork Chops, even my teenage daughter loved it!!!
