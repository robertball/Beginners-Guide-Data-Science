Delicious! If you are using 1/2 cup olive oil, you don't need to add water, just cover the pan with aluminum foil. It should be done in about 1 hour or less at 400F. Serve with freshly baked bread! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Very pleased to see a recipe for Briam. This one is very good but a little too much oil for us (realize that you use a lot more Olive oil than we normally do). Anyway, cutting it back by a half worked just fine.  Thanks for a good recipe.

Simple, healthy and delicious! I usually don't go for mint, but it really works here. The capers are also key.

I really liked this but bf didn't--not a surprise, since he doesn't really like tangy sauces.  I also subbed a few different veggies in here but it didn't really change the overall flavor. Very easy, if a number of steps.  If you like capers and vinegar you will really like this.  thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! Great way to use up zucchini and eggplant at the end of the growing season. I will make this again and again.

I was looking for a Greek sauce to go over baked meatballs that had feta and dill in them, so I adapted this and it was delicious! I only had fresh mint handy (snipped it off the new plant on my windowsill) so used a lesser amount of dried other herbs. Accidentally forgot the garlic and parsley, but dried parsley doesn't have a lot of flavor anyway. I only used 1 Tbsp capers, and used 2 cups of canned tomato sauce instead of the fresh tomatoes to make it quicker.  Definitely a keeper!

Good, but it took longer to cook than stated.  Or maybe I should have sliced my potatoes and eggplant thinner - I did about 1/4 - 1/2 inch.

Loved this!  So amazed how much flavor it had.  I switched the olive oil for broth and customized the veggies to our taste.  After 3 tries we like it best baked uncovered for the last 15 mins to thicken the juices.

The fresh tomato sauce is delicious!  I will 1/2 the recipe and NOT use water.  I had to remove almost 1 1/2 cups of liquid.  I will follow the suggestion in a previous review to cover with foil and not add water.  This was a perfect side for grilled marinated lamb chops.  Definitely will make again!

Delicious and healthy veggie dish!  I didn't have most of the vegetables so I used broccoli, brussels and red pepper with the potatoes and onions.

I thought this was good but I prefer a regular Ratatouille over this recipe.  a nice change and a good way to use up my garden veggies but not a favorite for me.

This was simple to make and got rave reviews. I was a bit nervous about it because I have never made it before and I brought it to a party with my Greek friends. They loved it. It was all  gone in 15 minutes. I will make it again.

Really great recipe. The subtle mint taste makes it different from other similar recipes. I didn't have okra and replace them with regular yellow beans. Perfect recipe to prepare when the veggies and the herbs are fresh. I froze a part of it to enjoy later in the winter.
