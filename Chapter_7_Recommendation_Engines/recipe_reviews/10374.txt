I had no eggs, so I needed a basic recipe w/o them.  This one fit the bill.  I love raisins, but my husband does not.  Enter chocolate (of course), almonds and toffee.  Double the milk and add cinnamon.  YUM.

I didn't have any eggs, so I was looking for a cookie recipe that didn't call for them and came across this one.  I was very surprised and pleased with how yummy they are!!  They are so soft and chewy even the next day.  I used chocolate chips instead of raisons, b/c my husband hates them (I bet they are so good with them though!), and he said that I needed to make them everyday...HA!

These cookies are fantastic! My sister and I were looking for some cookies to make, but didn't have any eggs in the ingredients. These worked wonderfully!   I did change the recipe a bit, though. I added chocolate chips instead of raisins, added another 1/4 cup of milk, a few dashes of cinnamon, a teaspoon of banana extract, and added a 1/2 cup of peanut butter. Delicious!

Wow wow wow... such a great base recipe.  I had no eggs and my husband was begging for oatmeal raisin cookies.  Found this and used oil instead of butter, 1/2 sugar 1/2 agave, more oats less flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, dash salt, almond extract and vanilla extract and holy cow the house smells amazing and my hubby is killing the whole plate of em'! THANKS.

These were pretty good considering there was no egg. I couldn't stop eating the dough it was so good! I did change the recipe like someone else did. Doubled the milk and added 1/2 cup (natural) peanut butter. I also soaked the raisins in water for a few minutes so they would plump.

I fallowed the recipe to a T but subbed raisins for chocolate chips. I was craving a chew chocolate chip cookie but had no eggs on hand. They are not the best chocolate chip cookie I have ever had but for how simple the recipe is they are amazing cookies.

I did half a batch with raisins and the other half with chocolate chips.  I also used oil instead of butter and the family loved them.  My son insists we need to make them frequently.

Good cookies, but I really didn't think that they were very oatmeal-y and I found myself wanting that.  So, I'd add more oatmeal next time.  Otherwise, these were easy to make, easy to eat.  I wouldn't mind making them again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Shortbread and oatmeal cookies combined. Yum! Nice buttery oatmeal flavor. Only used half of the raisins.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I tried it as written except for adding pumpkin pie spice, wich didn't spice it enough in my opinion.  After baking the first batch of cokkies, I quickly added an egg to the rest of the dough to see if that made a difference.  It made the cookies still puffy, but more cake-like.  They were okay, but still not what I was looking for.  I like my cookies flat and chewy rather than puffy and light.  I will keep looking!

Hello delicious... these were a great midnight snack! I scaled the recipe down to 10 cookies which worked well. I replaced the raisins with vegan carob chips (I don't like raisins in cookies) and in order to make these cookies completely vegan I used a vegan soy margarine and rice milk. My only regret was not making more, my boyfriend asked if I could make more tomorrow. Thank you!

Mmm!  I thought these were a great oatmeal cookie.  They were tender on the inside with a crisp buttery bottom.  They were more of a carmely flavored oatmeal cookie because of all the butter and brown sugar.  I added a bit of cinnamon to mine and choc chips instead of raisins.  This will be what I make everytime I am low on eggs or need a quick cookie!

Yum! These were awesome! I didn't have any eggs & really wanted to make oatmeal raisin cookies. They turned out great. I added 1/2 cup of sugar to give it just a tiny bit more sweetness. :)

A family favorite!  We don't like raisins so we sub chocolate chips for them.  Also fantastic with dried cranberries and white chocolate chips!

I was low on eggs and was in the mood to bake. I made these in the past and was glad I found them. They are absolutely delicious. They are quick and easy to make with basic ingredients. I didn't have raisins this time but they were still just as good.

I had no eggs, no vanilla and i only had instant packages of oatmeal! Lol, i wanted something sweet so i made due with what i did have and it came out great. I also had no raisins so i picked out a cupful from my box of raisin bran lmao..did you know a box of raisin bran doesn't have 2 scoops!! Anyway the dough is delicious. I had to add more milk. If you're not sure if your baking soda or powder is still good for the powder add hot tap water to the powder and see if it bubbles if it does you're good. Same with the soda except add 1/4 teaspoon of vinegar. If it bubbles it is still good. Happy baking!

I made these cookies with Pamela's gluten free flour and gluten free Irish oats, the cookies turned out amazing! I also substituted half of the butter for coconut oil. I completely loved this recipe, and so did my family! 
(In my opinion, these cookies could be made vegan easily)

Loved these! Simple and delicious with either brown sugar or white sugar. Instead of raisins I did white chocolate chips and switched out the vanilla extract for almond. All amounts remained the same. I rolled them into balls and they came out like snowball cookies. Perfect with a cup of coffee (for me) or a glass of milk for the kids!

I replaced the raisins with chopped pecans, because my husband doesn't care for raisins in his cookies. I halved the recipe and dropped the dough by tablespoonfuls onto the cookie sheet, yielding a dozen large cookies. I baked them for 14 minutes and they turned out crisp at the edges and chewy in the middle. Delicious!

Made these last night cause I didn't have any eggs.  Great oatmeal-type cookie.  Added the following for more flavour:  1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1/2 tsp salt, an extra 1/4 cup raisins that had been soaked warm water.  Really comparable to my usual oatmeal cookie recipe that uses eggs.  Texture is in between cake-like and dense. Cookies do not spread while cooking, and I found a teaspoonful of dough on the cookie sheet really stayed as a teaspoonful after cooking.  Therefore, I added more batter to each drop, and of course it made less cookies.  I had 3 dozen altogether.  Put cookies in a container shortly after cooling, as I found them getting hard pretty quick.  Checked the cookies later on and they were nice and soft and slightly chewy.  Really great recipe overall.  Thanks for sharing!

These are a perfect oatmeal raisin cookie! I subbed King Arthur’s gluten-free flour with no issues. I baked small cookies for 14 minutes, and they are lightly crispy outside and perfectly chewy inside. This recipe is a keeper!

Good easy cookie when you are out of eggs.  I used chocolate chips instead of raisins, because of family preference.  But I'm sure that I would have liked raisins as much.

I halved the recipe and used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of raisins. Really yummy! Crispy and chewy. I can't eat eggs so this recipe is great!

Very nice recipe for anyone with an egg allergy. Made it for kids, and left out the raisins. Still came out quite nice. Not an overly sweet cookie. Very simple and easy to make.

Who really uses teaspoon size cookies? Made mine much larger and got just over 2 dozen. Very tasty. Follow other reviews to moisten the raisins in some water and to use a little more oats and a little less flour, also used 1/2 C milk instead of 1/4. These were great for an eggless cookie. Thanks for sharing.
