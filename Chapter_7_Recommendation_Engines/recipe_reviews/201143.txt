Made this tonight and EVERYONE went back for seconds.  I also used 2 cloves of fresh garlic.  I used cyan pepper instead of red pepper flakes and regular salt because I didn't have an celery salt on hand.  Served with green beans.  Nice easy meal!

Wow this was really good.  I made the recipe as written with the tomato sauce and juice and it was fantastic.  I was toying with the idea of just using jarred pasta sauce, but knowing how good it tastes as written I will make it this way from now on, DELISH!

Came home last night and did not have a clue what to have for dinner.  Had a 1 1/2 of ground beef in fridge and tired of burgers.  This was perfect and I started it late.   Another HIT!  My two men in the house loved it!  Maybe next time I will 2x's it because they complained not enough for lunch on the following day.

Excellent recipe.  I added parsley, oregano, and thyme, and it came out fantastic.  My two young boys and my husband scarfed it up.  One thing was that I turned up the heat to 375 after I added the mozzeralla because it didn't seem hot enough after 20 minutes.  That helped a lot.

Nice family-friendly meal!  I cut the recipe in half, but still used a full pound of ground beef, used extra onions and green pepper and added some minced garlic.  I also used low-sodium V8 because that's what we had in the house.  I would highly recommend using a better pepperoni (like Kretschmar or Boars Head) that you can get at the deli.  They have a truer pepperoni taste and aren't quite as salty.  Will make this one again, especially for a night that I need to put together a meal quickly.

Very good recipe, I used 2 cloves fresh minced garlic in place of the garlic salt. I love the pepperoni, its a fun twist on an old family favorite recipe.

Meh.  It was ok.  I agree with the reviewer below me.  I think I was expecting it to bake into more of a stable casserole (like lasagna) somehow, but it did not.  It was just a pile of noodles, pieces of ground beef and pepperoni on the plate.  The flavor combination is fine; it tastes just like pizza.  And it was very easy to make.  But I will not be making this again.

I didn't have the small shells so I used elbow macaroni which worked well in this casserole. The pepperoni I bought made this taste a bit like a pizza and my brother thought leftovers were fantastic.

This is very good.  I can also freeze it, so it's ready at any time.

THIS WAS JUST OK. I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE OTHER REVIEWS RAVED ABOUT THIS.  IT WAS FAST TO MAKE, BUT I PROBABLY WON'T MAKE AGAIN.

Really good...whole family enjoyed it.  I had some frozen red, green and yellow bell pepper strips, so I chopped a couple handfuls and put in the sauce.  It made a really good flavor.  Will make again.

Excellent! Followed the recipe for the most part. Used GF pasta (rigatoni) and pasta sauce I place of the tomato sauce.  I added crushed garlic instead of garlic salt. My kids went back for seconds!! That indicates a hit in our house!!

Good but not spectacular. We think it needs more pepperoni. Made it per recipe. We think it will be better reheated after a day in the fridge. Was not dry. Will try ground garlic instead of garlic salt next time. I preferred the sloppy joe casserole.

I didn't have tomato sauce or tomato juice so I substituted with 2 cans of tomato paste with equal parts water.  I added some sugar to take counter the acidity from the tomato.  I also added some rum and shiracha sauce to give it a kick. I used half of the mozarella and mixed it into the beef and mac mix for some added gooey yumminess!!!  I will definitely will make this again!

This was really tastey. My family enjoyed it and especially the added pop of flavor from the pepperoni. It was easy to put together and the sauce alone could be used just as a pasta sauce on its own. We added a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese for some extra zest. Definitely a keeper!
