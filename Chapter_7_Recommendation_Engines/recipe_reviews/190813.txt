Great for a quick lunch! I used leftover turkey and swiss instead of provolone.  I love anything that combines bacon and avocado and this was really good.  All I added was a dill pickle on the side!

This sandwich is very very good - try serving it on a croissant to make it really special and perfect to serve at a luncheon.

So, so good. I used low-carb bread and bibb lettuce. Most of the ingredients in this sandwich I found cheaply at my local discount grocery store, so I didn't break the bank. Very yum.

This was very good!  With the addition of avocado, there was enough creamy richness that I didn't even need to use mayo (which I usually ALWAYS do on sandwiches). I also opted to leave out the cheese and save a few calories, and I still had a very filling and satisfying supper, and since I used a really healthy high-fiber bread, a pretty healthy one! Thanks for sharing!

Simple and fast. I spread the mayo on both pieces of bread and toast them oin a skillet. I add a little onion and use queso fresco instead of provolone. Makes a great sandwich!

This is a very good sandwich. It's like a turkey club with avocados. I used sharp cheddar since thats what I had on hand. This was great for a quick dinner.

My favorite things to eat! Omitted the mayo, lettuce and cheese. Replaced the bread with a toasted bagel and regular bacon with crisp turkey bacon - layered open faced leftover turkey breast, organic avocado, turkey bacon,  vine ripe tomatoe and lots of cracked black pepper. Significant other thinks it looked strange to say the least as he munched away on his traditional hot turkey leftovers...but what does he know about good eats! It was exceptional! ...think I will do it again!

I made this for lunch today and my kids love, love, love them!  I found a way to get in those veggies again.  I always use 100% wheat bread and low fat mayo or Miracle Whip.  The only real fat in this is from the bacon and I cook it on a George Foreman grill so at least a lot of the fat is drained.  I will make this often.

I think it's a 4.5; my husband gave it a 3.5. Yummm! I sliced up mozzarella cheese instead of provolone, only because that's what I had on hand. Thanks for sharing!

This is really good just as written and also so easily adjusted to what you have on hand or your personal preferences. I made it pretty much as written the first time though used white cheddar instead of provolone since that's what I had! I used a bagel thin instead of regular bread and used maybe 1 tsp of may just because my bread pieces were small. I used 2 slices of regular sliced (Oscar Mayer) turkey and 2 slices center cut bacon. I thought the avocado was a little too thick - but I used a pretty big one plus had small bread! :) I discovered I really liked it dipped in a little ranch too (which I had on my plate for celery sticks). I think next time I'd leave the cheese off, didn't think it really added anything. Very good sandwich! I made an extra to take to lunch at work tomorrow. :)

Fantastic. Getting a nice deli cut of turkey meat is really worth it for this. . .  I used 2 slices of Havarti cheese. I think any kind of cheese will do.

Great sandwich!  I needed something to throw togeter quickly after a late ballgame and this fit the bill nicely.  I had everything on hand.  This was a nice change of pace from an everyday sandwich.

I made this recipe using Italian multi grain bread from the bakery. I followed the recipe as directed, using a little less bacon and no tomato (not ripe yet!). It was very quick, easy, and tasty - I will definitely add it to my regular lunch rotation.

YUM!  I had this at a diner in Ouray, Colorado.  Their prep was a little different and highly recommended if you're not worried about calories.  Grill/fry the turkey in butter first in a skillet.  Put the sandwich together, minus the lettuce and grill the whole thing like a grilled cheese sandwich.  AMAZING!

Yum! Your recipe was the spark I needed to find something to do with leftover smoked turkey from Thanksgiving. I had bread that was too large for the toaster, so we toasted for a bit in the oven. Then spread both sides with mayo, sprinkled on parm & cheddar and broiled that for a bit. Then added the rest. Delish!! Thanks for helping spark my creativity with leftover smoked turkey, which I'm not a huge fan of.

Add mustard, I use 1/2 an avocado for each sandwhich it really turns up the flavor. Add onions, salt to taste, I use chester cheese and I also toast the sandwhich before serving it.

Excellent recipe! I made mine both on ciabatta rolls and toast, as I had to make 5 sandwiches and only had 4 ciabatta rolls. The rolls made a fantastic sandwich reminiscent of what you would get in a restaurant. My husband who had both types of the sandwich, said the ones on the ciabatta rolls came out much better than the wheat toast.

Also, I did mine a tiny bit different. I put the mayo on the bottom of the roll, then 2 slices of bacon, the cheese and then the turkey. I let that bake for about 5 minutes in a 350 degree oven and then I topped with the rest of the ingredients. Cut in half and served with baked chips and a pickle...Yummers

what a nice light yet satisfying sandwich for lunch. My only dlimena was cooking the bacon but then I found, "Bacon for the Family or a Crowd," on this recipe website which made preparing the bacon so much easier.  I used Oscar Meyer Turkey Bacon, deli turkey breast, provolone cheese, local fresh lettuce and white toast. I also took half of the avocado and decided to mash it up and spread it on one side of the bread instead of just slicing it. I also used fresh local grown tomatoes, sliced thinly. I had this with some hot soup. yum!

A nice change from a typical BLT.  I needed to use up an avocado and came across this recipe.  The extra meat on this made for a very filling sandwich.  I served this on toasted sandwich slims and served 'Ginny's Cauliflower and Pea Salad' from AR, with it.

I changed this a bit and put the turkey on the bread first, then the bacon, then the cheese.  I think it greatly improved this complex dish.

I have seen this on here for awhile, and I finally got around to making it. I need to remind myself to go beyond the first few reviews, on most all of the recipes, as they seem to be the same people, and dig further to see what others thought. I thought this tasted good, but it wasn't great. I found it "dry" and it didn't really all come together. I am assuming for lack of dressing. Plus, the bacon was hot while the turkey was cold and the vegetables were even colder. Adding some dressing besides the optional tsp of mayonnaise, and using a panini press, would have solved both of these. I wanted to follow it as is, though, the first time.

It was a good recipe, very simple, but I wanted something a little more. I added a chipolte mayo made from canned chipoltes in adobe sause, lime juice, and some cilantro. I also used a multi grain bread and spinach instead of lettuce. this is a perfect sandwich for any lucnh day. The avocado adds a buttery and creamy texture that I love!

Delicious... best in the summer with crockpot roasted turkey breast but still acceptable in November with leftover turkey and less than stellar tomatoes,  and to take it over the top add some cranberry relish and chipotle mayo!  But a solid 4 stars as written!

I'll be making this again and will go with smoked turkey.  I can't wait to make it with nice warm tomatoes from my garden!  OMG!  I thought I was putting a profile picture up when I joined and the picture is up where the pictures of the sandwiches are! I am such a non-tech!

I made this with vegan mayo, bacon, cheddar cheese and deli turkey. I also crushed the avocado half and seasoned with cracked black pepper. Delicious! The flavours work really well together and was a great recipe to veganise :)

I used sandwich thin breads, string cheese,and 2 pieces of turkey bacon and honey roasted turkey instead. 

But this us one of the best sandwiches I have had in a long time. It tastes restaurant quality.
