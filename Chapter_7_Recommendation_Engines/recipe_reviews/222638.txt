This was a delicious and easy recipe!  My boyfriend was so happy there was a whole pan, as he couldn't stop eating it.  The only thing that I substituted was Italian blend shredded cheese (with cream cheese in it) instead of plain mozzarella.  Super tasty!  Will make again for sure.

This recipe was great -- I'm going to replace my current baked ziti recipe with this one.  I did add 2T of Tastefully Simple garlic bread seasoning but even if you don't have that I'd recommend adding some seasonings of your choice (oregano, garlic, etc).  I also mixed the sauce in with the ricotta mix instead of layering it.  I found that it only needed to cook for 35 minutes and I took the foil off about 10 before the timer was set to go off so it got a little brown on top.  Yummy!

This was very tasty! I made it for my parents and my Dad couldn't stop eating it. I ground beef to make it a bit more hearty. I also didn't layer it, I just threw it all together and it turned out great.

Made this for dinner tonight.  It was really good, but not to die for.  I did follow the directions to a T because I've never made baked Ziti before.  I found that the layers didn't really melt or come together during baking like I hoped they would.  It's something I'll try again, but I'll have to think about adding something to thing out the ricotta mixture because it couldn't really be spread so I ended up with drops that stayed that way when it baked.  I will try this again, but maybe add a little cream or something to give it a creamier consistency.  Thanks for the post.

First of all I added meat to the sauce and to offset the increase in mass and density I doubled up on mozzerella, added 22 ounces of rocatta instead of 15, and doubled up on the sauce.

This is seriously one of the best baked ziti recipes I've ever tried! Absolutely delicious! 38 minutes is about perfect for cooking time btw.

I've made this recipe a few times, this is my go to baked ziti dish now! The first time I made it following Carol's recipe, with the exception of the layering.  I just mix together all the ingredients, except the final 1/4c cheese for the top, and pour it into the baking pan.  Delicious!

Ever since I've made the following tweaks:  mix all the ingredients (except the topping cheese) including the uncooked pasta and add about half again more sauce, 1/2c each ff half and half and water.   The pasta cooks in the oven, is never over done,  and the sauce thickens up nicely.  Sometimes I add browned hamburger seasoned with garlic, S&P. 

Thanks for posting the recipe!

This was a wonderful recipe. Ended up having it two nights in a row (no leftovers.) All 4 of us thought it was great. Could use a little seasoning but other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

I think next time I would prefer to mix everything together, as opposed to layering it.  I also like ground beef in my ziti, otherwise good and easy.

Very, very good!  I found though it's easier to fold in the pasta, sauce and ricotta mixture together, then put into the pan, top with additional mozzarella at end.  Overall, very good! Brava, Carol!

Yum! The only change I made was to add some vegetarian sausage. This was a hearty and satisfying meal.

This is so easy to make and always delicious!! I add a little more sauce and cheese to mine  so you can use this as a base if you want to modify. I made it for my boyfriend and he had two servings and took some home as well!!  I have made it for dinner parties and everyone loves it!

Simple, already in the kitchen ingredients. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta as it's less expensive for the wallet and diet alike. Definitely a keeper!

I liked that it was easy to prepare, but I still added the ziti and the ricotta mixture together making one layer.  Also, it looked like it would be on the bland side so I added some garlic salt to the ricotta mixture and sprinkled dried basil on the sauce.  My goal in preparing this was to use up the cheeses that had been hiding out in my freezer.  I couldn’t tell you all the different cheeses I used, but it worked out great.

Yes I liked Baked Ziti number one. Plus the picture doesn't go with the recipe ingredients. They should match.

This is the easiest Baked Ziti recipe I've ever tried. I served it with meatballs and garlic bread. I did add 1/2 cup of sauteed chopped onions and 1 teaspoon chopped garlic to my sauce as I thought it needed to be a bit more flavorful. Overall, it was very good and my husband had a second helping of it.

This was perfect for my meatless meal this week! It could use a little more sauce, which I had left over anyway since I cut the recipe in half. I need to remember to lightly salt my pasta next time.

THIS ROCKED! ! I added Hot Italian  link sausage, that I broke up a bit to act like little meatballs. I used cottage cheese instead of the ricotta,  along with a tablespoon of Herb de Provance. The shredded smoked Gouda sprinkled throughout sent this to Heaven! Thank you Carol;)

I made this for dinner, and my picky 11 year old had seconds!  My family thought that the sauce/cheese ratio was good, as they don't like their ziti too saucey.  I did think that I would add some herbs to it to spice it up, it was a little bland, but sometimes bland is good.  I'm definitely putting it on my rotation as it is REALLY easy to put together.  It's a perfect dinner when one is too tired to cook.

I thought this was fantastic! Very easy to put together, and the taste you want is all about the sauce. I didn't think it was dry at all, but see where adding some sauce couldn't hurt, and if your sauce is bland, so is your Ziti. We combined a four cheese with a roasted garlic sauce (could only find 24 oz jar.) Very good, will make it again and again!

This came out really yummy.  I used a little pink sauce in mine because I ran out of red (I mixed alfredo with marinara). It was excellent.  I usually make lasagne but this is almost as good and a lot easier! AND, my husband loved the leftovers!  He has asked me to make it again!

Made a batch of this last week as a trial run for our Christmas party--it's awesome! I have 4 huge pans of it in my freezer waiting to be served up to all our friends. It would have been 5, but my family begged for it again tonight!!

I thought the flavor was very good. I just used a jar sauce so next time I will add more herbs. Also, the dish was EXTREMELY dry. I went back and checked the recipe because I thought I had not added the correct amount of sauce. I will try this again with more sauce and spices.

This recipe has made my ziti famous amongst family and friends. So quick and easy... Absolutely delicious. My dad actually said to my mom upon trying it for the first time "why don't you make ziti like this?" Haha!!

I used a homemade marinara sauce and added several herbs to the ricotta mix.

Simple and crazy good! I made it exactly the way the recipe called for it, and will definitely do it that way again. I also plan on adding ground beef and or sausage at some point and probably some vegetables; this recipe is a very good base to get creative with.

This was my first time making baked ziti, and thanks to this recipe, I nailed it!  Easy to put together, tasted great, and the family loved it... I’ll definitely be making this again.

Here's the deal. The recipe as a whole is as easy as it gets. Boil. Layer. Bake. The problem is, thus recipe has zero flavor. Ricotta and Mozzarella are both a very muted cheese in flavor. The pasta is just that, pasta. All your flavor is coming from the sauce. There's no salt or anything, unless you take it upon yourself and do that. I like to try the recipe as written first, then, if it's not where my tastes are, I can adjust. In my opinion, it could use extra seasonings. It's a great start.

So simple, yet so delicious! Believe it or not, this was my first time eating baked ziti and I loved it! I could imagine adding extras in there but this first time I made it as written and used Victoria marinara sauce from Costco. Delish! Hubby said it was a keeper and my toddler finished his plate. Winning!

I made it EXACTLY as per the recipe and it was terrible...and I took it to a potluck supper, based on the reviews!! It was dry and not cooked all the way through, even though I followed the recipe instructions to the letter. VERY DISAPPOINTING.

The whole family loved this meal! However, because it made so much, when I reheated it, it was a bit dry. Next time I will increase the sauce to pasta ratio.

This is a great basic recipe by itself. Every time I make baked ziti I start with this recipe and then change and/or add things to my liking or what I have on hand. I sometimes make it with ground beef, or use spinach, diced tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, garlic, change up the cheese or seasoning a bit depending on my mood. I've made this a zillion times, and plan to make it many more!

Loved it, added fresh basil and black pepper to the ricotta and topped it with some basil after cooking. Used "Rao's homemade marinara" jarred sauce. Highly recommend!

This was easy and tasty. Like others, I felt it needed some seasoning. I added basil, oregano, parsley, and garlic powder to the ricotta mixture (I actually didn't have ricotta cheese so I subbed cottage cheese and it worked nicely).

Great recipe!  I stayed true to the recipe and made it a meatless dish.  I really enjoyed it, as did my DH, but he thought it would have been great with meat added. Served it with a salad and homemade rolls.  Thanks, Carol A for sharing your dish!

I made it but added cooked ground beef to the sauce and a lot more seasonings like basil, oregano and garlic. Taste like a lasagna but with different pasta. Very good.

My husband made this as we were looking for an easy, quick recipe that would feed 8 people. He followed the recipe exactly and I thought it was good as it was, but next time I might add a little more sauce and something to thin out the ricotta mixture. I like my ziti a little creamier, but that could be preference. Served with meatballs/sausage in sauce, salad and Italian bread.

Had this for dinner and it was great, thanks for such an easy, mostly-accurate recipe (did anybody else count 4/3 sauce? I am tired...). Very filling and will leave plenty for leftovers and freezing for our small family. Definitely a keeper.

I went with some of the comments, doubled the mozzarella, added more sauce, and mixed it all together as opposed to layering, then adding more sauce and cheese on the top. It was my first time making ziti and it turned out delicious! Next time I will experiment with seasoning.

I use rigatoni and add extra cheese. Use real parm., the refrigerated kind. Sooo much better. Yum!

This was excellent as is but the 2nd time I made it I decided to add some veggies. I sauteed 2 medium zucchini and a small onion and added them to the marinara sauce with a can of diced tomatoes. Super delicious and a couple servings of vegetables per serving!

Loved it,simple and quick dinner. The fiancé is a beef guy, so added 1lb ground beef to the ricotta mix.  Also added the sauce to the mixture and then layered on top of the noodles.  This made the mixture creamer and easier to spread.  Heats through in about 40 minutes. Next time will add a little more sauce, as it was just slightly dry.

It was a bit dry the first time, so I used two jars of spaghetti sauce the next time (as the jars are now smaller than the recipe calls for).

This recipe was so- so.  Was a little bland.  Needed some additional spices like garlic and oregano.
Easy to make,went together well.  A bit dry too, would recommend more sauce.

One of my regular dinner standbys-- easy, fool-proof, and suits vegetarian and non-veg family members.
