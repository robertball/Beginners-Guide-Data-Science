BEWARE: Do not make this recipe as it stands - there is a line missing that will break your heart. The only liquid named is to soak the yeast in - there should be another amount (a cup or so) of milk or water too!  You get bricks if you bake it as written.

I got a hard ball of nothing.  Then I realized I should let set out, the dough was workable.  I tried to bake some, very bland and tasteless.  I am sure there is something missing here.  sorry.
