This recipe is fantastic; I swapped half the bread flour for wheat flour and added an extra 1/2 tsp of yeast--the result was a gorgeous bread that's pleasantly sweet.

Nice loaf, very tasty.  Next time I will skip the final brushing with honey.  It leaves the loaf sticky.  I will sprinkle a handful of oats on top of an egg or milk wash just before baking.  This is good with a mixed grain type of rolled grain hot cereal mix, instead of just oatmeal. Substitute one cup of whole wheat flour for one of the white flour, too.  More fiber/flavor.  Also, I cooked the rolled grain cereal with potato water (water saved from boiling potatoes for mashing)so whatever vitamins and minerals are boiled out of the potatoes are now in the bread.

This recipe produces excellent bread with a few changes! As some other reviewer I also found that with the fluid-flour ratio as stated in the recipe the dough turns out very sticky... I needed to use 3 more cups of flour in oder to get a workable dough. Also I used half wholemeal half plain bread flour and it tastes great. 

Definitely worth the 4 hours!

I don't know if my dough had issues because it's been raining for a week nonstop and the humidity is a b***h. I followed the recipe exact and it was super sticky. Even with about a 1/4 c. added flour. I couldn't stop eating the dough, though. Good stuff. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer from start to finish.  Let the dough rise in my huge metal bowl then transferred it to two greased loaf pans and let it rise again. Smells unbelieveable--taste is incredible. EDITED: Grandma tells me that the wetness of the dough is to be expected with an oatmeal based bread. The taste and texture of this bread is unbelieveable. So wonderful. This one's a keeper for sure.

Nice light loaf, although dough was quite sticky.  Baked them in a smaller pan for a higher loaf.  Won a blue ribbon at a county fair on this, will be entering it in the state fair, too.

This recipe produces a great loaf of bread. It's nice and light with just a hint of sweetness. The only thing was that I had to add a couple more cups of flour as the dough was too sticky. My relatives are begging me to make more!

Excellent bread.  I did add an additional cup of flour and some more while kneading.  
I am a novice bread maker and this is a great first time recipe.  Easy, simple and tasty!  5 stars & beyond!

My husband said this was the best bread he has ever eaten. I also took it to a class I teach at night and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I did not have bread flour so I used all purpose. also I had to add about an extra 3/4 cup of flour, but it was perfect after that. Will make this many more times.

Meh. I had a very different take on this recipe from most. Incorporating the suggestions of many reviewers, I used half whole wheat and half bread flour. The bread was good, not great, certainly nothing that rocked my world. It was moist and the flavor was OK. However, I'd suggest that the last 1/2 cup of water is unnecessary and contributes to a very sticky dough. Even after adding another 3/4 cup flour to try to give the dough some body, it was still soft. I went ahead with it, which I now know I shouldn't have done. There wasn't sufficient structure to support the loaf when it rose (I did not experience the problems others reported of the dough not rising.) It  looked gorgeous, nice and high. But as soon as the heating element kicked on in the bread machine, POOF! it all deflated. The result was a relatively flat loaf - the outsides were higher than the middle, which was less than attractive. That aside, as I said, the flavor was still reasonably good, and let's face it: homemade bread, even so-so homemade bread, still tastes wonderful when fresh. I suspect that if I had left out the later addition of water, the results would be a lot lighter and higher. Because of the extra pain-in-the-butt step  to allow the oats to steep for an hour, this is just too fussy a recipe for me to want to try again. I'm going to cut my losses on this one and move on.

Super fantastic!  I followed others suggestions and added about 1 extra cup of flour (I only had all purpose) and one extra packet of yeast.  Very delicious!  The whole family is raving; I took it out of the oven half an hour ago and we have already finished a loaf.

AMAZING! Very delicious & excellent texture although I think I may have just gotten lucky. I didn't realize I was out of bread flour & already started soaking the oatmeal so decided to forge ahead. Super glad I did but I have to admit I was very doubtful throughout the entire process all the way up to my first taste. 
Outside of my unplanned change to All-Purpose Flour, I followed the recipe EXACTLY (including the oats soaking in 2 cups of water for an hour) up to the kneading part. And, although the dough was more like a really thick batter, I did not add additional flour or change the ingredients whatsoever. However, I could not knead the dough as it never came together despite letting it mix in the stand up mixer for 10 minutes. So, I just threw on the dough hook & with the mixer on med-high, let it knead the dough for 20 mins. Then I POURED the dough/batter into the oiled bowl and, convinced I'd just wasted an hour and a half, covered with a warm towel to rise.
I couldn't believe my eyes when an hour later I came back & it was pushing the towel up over the top of the bowl! The towel had stuck just a little which is normally no big deal but being that the dough was so batter-like, when I pulled it off the dough sank like a deflated balloon. Hmm. I ended up once again POURING the dough into the loaf pans & it rose perfectly again!
It jiggled a lot when I was carrying it to the oven but when it came out it looked gorgeous! The texture is divine & it tastes delectable!!!

Those that are having to add more flour are NOT letting the oatmeal sit in the 2 cups of hot water for an hour. If you follow directions EXACTLY as this recipe is written then you will not need to do this.  This is an excellent bread recipe!

Delicious!!!!!!! My husband loved it.  I don't like buying bread from the store and I try to find bread recipes that I can continue making and this one is definitely a keeper.

Added Flax seed! One third cup whole flax seeds to the hot water mix hoping it would dissolve a little to let out the nutrients since I didn't have a grinder and I used half wheat and half white flour. I like braided bread so I baked a regular loaf and one braided. Voila! Best bread ever. Love trying new recipes!

This bread tastes seriously fantastic. When I first took it out of the oven, I couldn't stop eating it. Strange thing is, I was about to give up on it at first. I had to add about what seemed like an extra 1-1 1/2 cups of flour to get it to come together. I wish I would have measured, so I knew how much extra I was adding. I thought I did something wrong, but re-read some reviews and found out that others had to do the same thing. As I added more flour, I also increased both rise times to 1 1/2 hours each. I let it knead about 15 minutes, on the lowest spead, in the kitchen aid mixer which helped some with time and work. I decided to braid mine just like the main pic and it did look pretty. The honey on top is a little sticky, but it really adds to the flavor. Despite the issue with the flour and the longer rise times the taste is very good. As it is kind of dense, moist, and sweet I think it is best, personally, as bread and butter. That works for me though.

I'm relatively new to breadmaking but I've tried at least a dozen different recipes so far and this one is my FAVORITE! My daughters also love it.   The texture after toasting is very nice and this bread is delicious as a grilled cheese sandwich or for morning toast.  I have made this recipe using the following flour blends:  ~half all-purpose flour + half whole wheat flour ~half bread flour + half whole wheat flour  ~ALL bread flour  The all bread flour version is definitely my favorite, but the others were tasty too.    With all three versions I made, I did throw in an additional 1 cup of flour on top of what the recipe calls for. The dough is still sticky with the extra cup, but it turns out fine!  And it makes for a moist bread even 3-4 days later.

My son recommended this recipe and I've made it several times.  I follow the recipe exactly and it always comes out great!  One thing I really like about it is, it's not crumbly like a lot of homemade bread.  Sometimes I leave the honey and oats off the top and sometimes I put them on.  It does tend to make the bread sticky, but Oh! So Good!

Made this last week for a company potluck, turned out perfect - moist and just the right amount of sweetness.  To 'gild the lily' I took fresh salted butter and creamed it with some honey...totally awesome!

This is my favorite bread to make. My husband loves it as well. I add vitamin C powder and substitute 1/2 cup of flour with flax seed for added nutrition. I did have to use more flour since I use AP flour. I put honey on one of the loaves and leave the other as-is. We eat the one with honey fresh out of the oven... it's so YUMMY! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe yet. It is one of my favorite bread receipes. I've made it several times and each time I get wonderful results. My husband loves it, especially the honey/oat top. As other reviewers have mentioned the top can be quite sticky, but if you let the bread cool before eating it the top is fine. It's hard to do becuase this bread is so good hot and fresh! I hope you enjoy this bread as much as my family has!

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would.  I haven't baked bread in years, and have only done so with a bread machine.  I disposed of the bread machine last year, and a friend of mine talked me into making bread (actually - guilted me - she makes it DAILY).  Well, this made two generous sized loaves.  Within 30 minutes, my 16 year old son ate one entire loaf by himself.  Then, the other loaf was finished by the next morning.  They begged for more, so I started the process again for two more loaves.  My youngest asked me to pack it in her lunch box every day for school (nothing on it - just plain).  It is SO soft (which was a complaint about homemade bread in the past by my husband).  It also sliced very well and had an excellent texture.  I used my kitchen-aid stand mixer so I didn't have to knead it for 20 minutes myself.  As other reviewers noted, I needed about 6 cups of bread flour, total.  I am now starting with 5, and adding more, as needed, to the mixer after about 10 minutes of kneading.  Next time, I plan to use half whole wheat and half bread flour and see what happens!  Also, I skipped the honey and oatmeal on top, and it still has a very nice browned loaf bread look.  Also, the recipe says to preheat oven to 350, but to bake it at 375.  I baked at 350, but it required about 45 minutes baking time, as opposed to the 30 minutes stated.  Absolutely the best!  Thanks!  I have enjoyed making homemade bread for my family.

Please, please make this bread! You won't be sorry! I even messed up the bread at first, and was able to fix it (using techniques that would make seasoned bakers shed a tear or two), and it still came out fabulous. Since I didn't want anything too sweet, I opted out of the honey topping, but even without it the flavor of the fresh warm loaf straight out of the oven put a smile on my face. I also added a bit more flour, probably 3/4 cup. This is going to be another staple bread in my house!

reduced the recipes to 75% so i can bake 2 loafs in a 8x8 inch square pan side by side. i used my bread machine. soaked the oats as per instruction, then after the hour, just dumped the oat mixture into the machine, added flour and the yeast and had on the dough setting for kneading..  i did 2 cycles of kneading which is total of 40 minutes. i did add an add'l 1/2 cup of flour to help the dough come together which it never really did!  anyway, i forged on...took it out, let it do the first rising which it did well and took about 2 hours, then took it out and tried to "shape" into loaf. didn't happen cuz it is just simply too wet and sticky of a dough so i just poured it into my 8x8 pan and made a cut straight down the center. let it do the 2nd rising, again looked good. popped in the oven for 38 min and out came a delicious, and chewy bread.  this receipe is perfect. don't mind about the wet dough, think a cross between a pound cake dough and a bread dough.

I'm never making any other bread again. I made this using a bread machine. I soaked the oats in the boiling water, salt, honey, and butter (or oil, if you want to substitute). Then I put in the flour and the yeast. I set it to a standard bread setting, and it has come out flawless every time. My husband said tonight "wow, you must have worked out all of the flaws with bread making in the machine." I smiled and said no, I just found the right recipe.
Canola oil can be substituted for butter.
This is also the perfect recipe for anyone suffering from IBS. Using white flour and oats can really help the stomach digest unsolluable fiber.

This recipe makes FANTASTIC rolls. So far, I've eaten them plain with butter, put veggie burgers on them, and used them in a breakfast sandwich. Really a great recipe! I make the dough in my bread machine and then bake it in my regular oven.

I have been making this bread for about 3 years now.  Every time I try a new bread recipe, I always end up coming back to this one again!  I do not use any shortening -- I use applesauce instead, and can never taste the difference.  I also 1.5 this recipe and it makes 2 very nice size loaves.  As is, my loaves always turned out very small.  My only complaint about this recipe is that the dough is so sticky that it's very difficult to work with.  But, it's our favorite bread, so we soldier through the sticky mess! :)

I made the recipe using my bread machines dough cycle and it turned out great.  I prepared the boiling water, oatmeal, butter, etc. ahead of time as described in the instructions but only with 1 2/3 cups water then added 1/3 cup more water with the yeast to make a total of 2 cups water and adjusted the flour up to 4.5 cups so the whole recipe was closer to my usual ration of water and flour.  The dough was easy to work with prepared like that.  The oatmeal mixture was dumped directly on top of the flour which was waiting in the bread pan.  Yeast on top of that then into the machine for the 90 minute bread cycle.  I removed the dough and divided it 60/40 for 2 loaves of different sizes.  Flattened and rolled up each, covered for 1 hour then baked for 25 minutes at 350.    The big loaf was 90% gone 1 hour after it was baked (wife and 3 kids helping).  The crust was very nicely crisp and the bread soft and hearty.  The sweetness of the honye could be tasted but I put more on mine (no one else did).

Very enjoyable...it wasn't as light as I'd read in some reviews, however I did follow the suggestions of some other reviewers and use half whole wheat flour and half bread flour.  Wonderful texture for sandwiches or toasting.  EXCELLENT taste!  The honey/oat topping was very good, and not sticky as some had described since I gave it enough time to cool before eating.

I added a cup of flour and an extra packet of yeast, per some suggestions. The texture of this bread is gorgeous, just lovely. It needs a little more salt, IMO, to balance the sweet honey. That is easily rectified and I will make this again!

This was a very delicious bread! The texture is wonderful, very soft and moist! I love the honey brushed on top; it looked so pretty and tasted great. I soaked the oatmeal for one hour just as the recipe stated, and the bread was great! My whole family loved it. The only change I made was to substitute whole wheat flour for half of the white flour. I added a tsp. of wheat gluten, as well. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

this was excellent.  I made in food processor.  Only thing I did different was brush with honey after bread was done and sprinkle oatmeal on top.  Light, airy, and a deffinate keeper. This made 1 loaf !!!!!

The first yeast bread with which I have had successful results!  After decades of failure, this one was the charm.  My husband has asked me to make this bread from now on.  This bread is moist, tender, and tasty.  After the first batch, I started adding two cups of freshly ground whole wheat flour to the oatmeal "sponge" because we want to add more fiber to our diet.  Either way, this recipe is a "keeper"!

EXCELLENT!  Mixed the dough in my bread machine (had to add extra flour).  Made into 20 rolls.  Baked at 350 for 20 mins.  Have made this recipe many times so far and passed the recipe onto my sister.  They also love them.  Thank you for the recipe!!

I make this bread probably once a month with a homemade soup.  My family of six think this recipe makes the best homemade bread they have ever tasted.  And we have used plenty of recipes in the past.  I definitely recommend sticking to bread flour for sturdiness since the loaves are so moist.  And the suggested 4 cups has never been enough.  I would say that I easily use between 5 to 6 cups of flour total, counting the flour to dust my counter with.  Even after dough rises, you MUST use extra flour for dusting.  But it is well worth it, as it will produce two outstanding loaves of moist bread that everyone will love!

I had great luck with this recipe - I made sure to soak the oats in the hot water/honey/butter liquid for the full hour and didn't find the dough too sticky at all. The only changes I made were that I split the called for flour to 2c. white and 2c. whole wheat, used from other suggestions I used 2 packets of traditional yeast which i proofed in hot water with sugar in it first.  To make the wash, i used 1 egg and 1 tbsp of honey, and did a quick reapply 5 mins before the end of cooking to add some oat flakes to the top. Would defiantly make this again!

This is my all time favorite oatmeal bread recipe. It didn't get five stars from me because the honey is overpowering in the original recipe as is. I've cut back the amount of honey to one tablespoon in the dough and didn't miss it. I've used the dough to make rolls and crusts for other recipes. I've made variations on this recipe dozens of times. It's a good bread for making croutons or bread crumbs, but I've found it doesn't hold up well in puddings and pain perdu. I think it's the extra moisture from the oatmeal.

This bread is delicious! The 4 of us in our family ate 1/2 of the first loaf while it was still warm out of the oven. I needed to add about 2 extra cups of bread flour because the dough is sticky. 
I recommend using something other than warm honey to stick the post baking oats to the top of each loaf, though. The brushed-on warm honey will remain sticky and makes handling and storing the loaves difficult. I'll apply egg wash and oats just prior to baking next time.

By far, the best bread ever.  I've made this recipe several times and always need an extra cup to cup & 1/4 of bread flour.  Moist, slightly sweet and delicious.  Also wonderful toasted.

I am new to bread baking and have been adding an uncertain amount of flour to make it more workable.  The results are always delish!  The next time I will follow the recipe as written.  I'll bet that it will be even more wonderful with a more concentrated honey flavor.  Great recipe.

Very nice bread.  Takes some time, but most bread recipes do, and it is worth it.  I ended up with a soft loaf with a flavorful crumb.  The household seemed to enjoy it.  Thanks for the recipe!

After FIVE cups of flour I still had a sticky, unkneadable mess which finally dislocated my pinky finger. No idea what went so wrong when I followed the directions exactly up until I added more flour to get the dough to pull together.

Great recipe, comes out delicious every time! Needs to cook a bit longer than 30 minutes or it comes out a bit doughy, I find. Also wondering how to get an awesome braided effect on the top of the bread... must experiment! This bread is SO good!

I love this bread!  I tried to make it a bit healthier by subing white whole wheat flour, cutting back on the honey, ommitting the toping, and addding 2 tb ground flax.  I also used 2 pkgs of yeast to help the whole wheat rise like bread flour.  I let my kitchenaid do all of the kneading.  This is my family's new everyday bread.  Thank you!

needed 1 extra cup of flour and used an egg wash topped with oats before baking.  It was delicious!  I will make this again.

The taste is 5 star...but every time I make this it never rises like I want it to. I make plenty of different types of bread and this is the only one I have trouble with rising. I tried letting it rise longer-tried different pans... I just can't get that big beautiful dome!

This bread has the most amazing texture because of the oats. It's also quite sweet and has a strong honey flavour, so it's excellent served with butter or peanut butter, but not cheese. I've also made it with 1/4 cup of honey instead of 1/2 cup, and it was still sweet, but with less honey flavour. I don't put the honey/oatmeal topping on it. Instead, I wet the tops of the loaves and sprinkle oatmeal on them before baking.

After a second attempt, 4 stars for the flavor and texture - great bread. The first time around, I followed the recipes exactly and the dough turned out very wet and sticky - impossible to knead and after baking, the bread was still wet. The second time around, I halved the amount of water and everything turned out perfectly.

Instead of 2 tablespoons of butter, I used the whole stick for the recipe.  I also used some 10 grain cereal, prepared according to the package directions and allowed to cool while the oatmeal mixture soaked, used 1/3 whole wheat bread flour....also, i crused some oats and the ten grain cereal and used egg wash to help it stick to the bread.  Even with all those changes, my friends and family swear that it is the best bread they've every tasted! this will be my go-to recipe (with my changes incorporated) for eternity! Thanks Leslie

Great bread.  Made the first time as written except I did have to add 2 cups of flour.  It was totally delicious.  The second time, I added 1tsp yeast and used 4 cups whole wheat and 2 white and threw in 4 tablespoons of ground flax seed.  It still had the wonderful texture of the original but healthier.  Yum!!

Great with a few revisions. We prefer wheat bread, so I used 2 C all-purpose flour (I didn't have bread flour) and 2 C wheat flour. I added another 1/4 t yeast to help it out. At this point it didn't remotely resemble something that could become a loaf of bread, so I kept adding more flour until it did. I also added a bit more yeast to compensate. I took other reviewers' advice and decided to skip the honey and oats on top because I wanted to be able to make sandwiches. Instead, before baking it, I warmed a small amount of honey and milk, brushed it on top, sprinkled some oats, and brushed some more milk-honey mixture on top. They turned out wonderfully!

5 Stars all the way!  This bread was so good!  I did need to add more flour and used 1 cup of wheat flour in it.  I did not use the honey on top of the loaf, instead I brushed it with milk before baking and then sprinkled on the oatmeal.  I have made 6 loaves of this bread and it disappears almost before it even cools.  I will be making this bread much in the years to come!

This is ta good honey and oatmeal bread I have made.  The dough is like every saids very sticky and I didn't feel my bread rised as high as I liked, but it was delicious.  Also, our family loves our bread very sweet, so I had to add about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of white sugar.  I will definately make this bread again,  Oh, I used regular flour instead of the bread flour and it was still great.  I don't know if it is because I used regular flour or not, but my bread tends to go really dry after a day.

This bread is DELICIOUS!  I took it to a work Christmas party and got rave reviews.  I did make a couple changes.  I used 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 wheat flour.  It was a little sticky and while I was kneading it I had to add quite a bit of flour (I used wheat).  But it turned out great!  I will definitely be making this again.

The first time I made this, the water I used to activate the yeast was too hot and our kitchen was too cold for the dough to rise well so the bread came out really tough, but today I made it right (left a cup of hot water and the bowl of dough in the microwave and the dough rose perfectly!) and the bread was soft and delicious. I also added one more cup of bread flour and one more packet of yeast. It was worth the long preparation time and I am definitely making this again.

This bread is delicious!  I replaced half of the bread flour with whole-wheat, as some of the other reviewers did, and it gave it a wonderful nutty taste.  I used quick-cooking (instant) oats, and still got wonderful results, so don't worry if you don't have just plain rolled ones.  However, I found that the amount of flour called for was not enough... It took about two cups more than it stated in the recipe.  And, it did not rise very much.  I finally gave up waiting for it to double, after going longer than the rising time on each rise.  Even this would be okay, except the reason that I didn't give it five stars:  the baking time is off.  I cooked one 9-by-5, as called for, and two smaller loaves.  The thirty minutes was perfect... for the mini loaves.  The other was still doughy in the middle!  I had to cover it with foil and put it back in the oven.  When it finally became bread, not dough, it was very tasty, and worth all the extra effort.

I am a novice at bread baking so my first attempt at this recipe was not successful. My dough would not rise, and the end result was a really dense/yeasty tasting mess.  After reading some helpful hints on this site,  I attempted again and was really pleased with the outcome.  Not only did it look beautiful, but it sliced great and was really enjoyable toasted with alittle butter.    Thanks for an easy recipe and a great learning experience.  I will bake this bread again!

I substituted whole wheat flour for 1/2 the bread flour and added 1/4 cup each of flax seed and sunflower seeds.  It did require more flour than called for in the recipe.  I let my Kitchen Aide do the kneading for me.  It rose beautifully and it tastes great.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband hates oats, but he needs to figure out a way to get them in his diet.  I have tried all sorts of things, including pulverizing oats so they look like flour, but he still hates them.  He loves this bread!  My modifications:  2 packages yeast, over 6 cups flour (half wheat), left off the honey/oats topping, and baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  It came out great, and my boys loved helping me knead.  Thanks, Leslie!

Great bread.  I use the kneading hook on my mixer instead of had kneading it for 20 min by hand and it turns out just fine.  I also omit the oatmeal and honey on top of bread so that a picky child of mine does not realize that there is something healthy in this bread.

I love this bread, it is my go to bread recipie.  I love its texture.  I always add a cup of whole wheat flour, and only use a cup extra flour then the original recipie calls for.  It is really great when made into rolls too!

So, I just made this bread. It quite literally just came out of the oven (the oven is still hot) and already one of the loaves is gone. I followed the directions exactly, apart from the fact that I did need to add about a cup and a half more flour than was called for, and I did end up kneading for close to half an hour (my arms were killing me!). To top it, before I put the loaves in the oven I brushed them with milk and then sprinkled oats over their tops. Other than that, exactly what the directions called for, and it's delicious! Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

I love this recipe!

I've found that it's very important to use bread flour.  When I switched, I found that I used less flour -- about 5 cups total.

I also did not like the results when I doubled the yeast.

Be sure not to rush!  You can extend but not cut back on the recipe times. I use my Kitchenaid mixer to knead -- two minutes at level 2.

I divide mine into three smaller loaves.

Flavor is definitely yummy but the original recipe is too heavy/dense. I followed the recipe to a T and it left dense compacted unbaked dough on the base. Definitely add more yeast or flour next time and bake a bit longer covered to avoid overbrowning but baking through.

I made this as written and the dough was too sticky. Rather than add extra flour, I used it as was, and the result was not as much rise as I would have liked. HOWEVER....the taste I would give 5 stars. Very yummy, and 3 days later it is still moist and fresh tasting. My husband ate almost half a loaf the first night. This one is a keeper; just have to play around with it.

I love how this turned out.  Wonderful texture and crumb!  The flavaor is amazing.  Next time I make it though I will decrease the water by 1/2 cup, the loaves are too heavy.

This is such a nice light flavorful bread.  Like others, I needed to add additional flour, about 1 cup.  The only other change I might make is using an egg wash rather than honey for the top of the bread, as the oats didn't adhere as much as I would have liked.  Other than that, this is the oatmeal bread recipe that I have been looking for.  Thank you so much Leslie!

I substituted 2 cups bread flour with 2 cups whole wheat flour and, for diabetic considerations, used 1/3 cup honey.  Easily worked in additional 1-1/2 C flour - like everyone else.  I'm VERY pleased with the results.

Made it following the recipe exactly And it is amazing! I wanted bread that would hold up to roasting, not being too crumbly and this is it! Don’t be fooled by the dough’s apparent stickiness, it’s perfect!

I used my own starter, didn't have honey so substituted with maple syrup, and used whole wheat flour with added gluten. Kept the rest the same. Turned out great!

I was so excited to bake this bread and when I was in the middle of prepping the dry ingredients I found out I run out of bread flour even regular all purpose flour . I followed the exact procedure but  I used different ingredients. for the 4 cups of flour the recipe called for, I ended up using 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 3 1/2 cup wheat flour. Other reviewers stated the dough is really sticky which is true but sometime a lot of factors affect the outcome like, where you live, humidity, elevation for that said there is no such perfect recipe. It's the baker and the eater decide if  the recipe is really for you to keep or to tweak ! I ended up asdding 1 cup wheat flour gradually and do more kneading by hand.
Happy to say, MY BREAD TURNED OUT WONDERFUL!!!  I couldnt resist trying it before it toatally cools down.
Note: I didn't add aditional honey on top as the bread is already sweetened. Can eat even just bread and taste so yummy!!! Thank you Leslie Vaughn  for sharing this wonderful recipe.. This is such a keeper.
My bread ended up

Slightly sweet, a delicious healthier bread. I used whole wheat white flour and it was delightful plain, toasted, with honey and cinnamon and used for grilled cheese with Muenster cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

It is a very good recipe.  I have been making it for my very fussy grandson. I used egg wash and oats on top vs honey.
I've made 6 loaves  so far. Delicious

I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out perfect. No extra flour needed except during the kneading process. It has the perfect hint of sweet honey without being over powering. This was my first time making bread and it turned out amazing, I was highly impressed. The bread flour was perfect, no wheat flour was needed in this recipe.

Recipe was great. I followed exactly and it is a very wet dough to start. I let my stand mixer knead it for 8 minutes and it came right together no extra flour needed. I would just say don't add more flour. You may be concerned about how wet it is after you add everything together but as you Knead by hand or mixer for enough time it'll come together and be a much lighter loaf than if you added that extra flour.

I followed the directions  exactly.  The dough is very sticky and mushy. Not like yeast dough. Had to bake 40 minutes to get it light brown. It tastes ok, but it's kinda mushy. Not light at all. Next time I will use more flour.

Way too much water for the amount of flower - possibly the recipe will work with instant oats.  Ended up adding around 6 six cups of water to get something besides flour soup.

Delicious and beautiful looking. Very loose dough - like cake batter. I let the kitchenaid do the kneading because it was so wet. But it baked up into two lovely loaves! I'll make this again for sure.

Excellent texture and taste. Delicious toasted. I brushed the loaves with warmed honey and topped with oats prior to baking. I baked one as a loaf and the second as a freeformed dome.  Both turned out well, but I preferred the dome shape for cutting and serving. Our 14 year old granddaughter made this recipe as her first yeast bread after mastering soft pretzels. It was a huge success.

First time making bread using my kitchenaid mixer. Dough was very sticky after i kneaded it and i even added another 1/2 cup of flour but i let it rise and it was perfect and no longer sticky. Then i proofed in the tins and baked, perfection! Followed recipe except i brushed the top with egg white and water and sprinkled on oats

This is one of my favorites on big bake days. I love the sweetness and texture that the oatmeal and honey add  to this  bread. It is amazing for toast and jam and I am going to try using it for french toast for a hearty brunch.

This recipe is great! I made 1/2 the recipe the first time.. used 1/2 the water but same amount of yeast.. it was delicious! I think I ended up adding about 1/2 cup of extra flour while kneading though.. it just kept soaking it in and getting sticky... the extra flour really helped with the texture

I grew up with my Mom baking bread every Thursday. Honey Oat was always included and was the children's favorite. So happy I found this recipe to bake for my own babies! It's exactly what I remember and the loaves came out beautifully.

This loaf was easy to make, I made it with all whole wheat flour with 2 tbsp of wheat gluten added to keep the loaf light and fluffy.  Make sure to let the oats rest for 1 hour so that the water gets sucked up.  I used maybe 1-2cups extra flour including the kneading process. Great recipe.

My family loves this bread. I have a few recipes I make regularly but this one they ask for the most. My husband takes a loaf to work and his coworker that owns a catering business loves this bread. He’s on a low carb diet and ate half a loaf in one sitting! Thank you for an awesome bread! We love it!

I followed the recipe exactly and made it in the bread machine, I wouldn't change a thing about it.  I can imagine without the machine doing all the work it would be tempting to add flour while kneading, but the sticky dough is what makes it so soft. Just a touch of sweetness too,  yum!

I end up stirring in much more flour than the recipe calls for because it is such a sticky dough. Also, I leave it to prove for an hour each time.

This recipe was great. I used wheat flour and added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of yeast like somebody else had recommended. The honey sweetens it and really adds to the flavour. It’s a very hardy bread, my mother and I had to split a piece! My only problem was that Because I used wheat flour I took it out a little too soon so the middle was a bit doughy. I should have left it in ten more minutes.

Tastes great but I had quite a few hiccups. First, dough was too sticky. What I should have done was to knead with some olive oil. What I did was add some flour to the mix until it was kneed able. Second, i had to let the dough rise over a 12 hr. period and the damp wrap I was using came off. This caused the dough to dry up a bit and also it had risen to about 3x its size. I think that the combination of these errors produced a loaf of bread that  was a bit doughy at the end. Additionally the loaf came out with cracks and such on the sides. None of these problems were of the recipe, but I just wanted to share my experience. Taste is phenomenal!

This rating is for the recipe as instructed.  I read the reviews and knew I was taking a chance by not adding extra flour, but there were a few reviews that said it worked fine for them.  It did not work for me.  Had to pour the batter into the bread pans and while it looked lovely while baking, it fell as soon as it began to cool.
On the bright side, the flavor is wonderful and I will try it again with additional flour.

wonderful, used just over 4cs flour total, about 1/2 and 1/2 bread and whole wheat flour. Barley malt instead of honey. one loaf in glass bread pan, one boule in preheated cast iron Dutch oven. I'll make this again with lots of room for variations

This bread is ok. It has good flavor but I don't love the texture and the hour long soak at the beginning is just one more step in an already long process. I'll use a different recipe next time for my honey oat bread.

This bread is delicious and easy! After reading some of the reviews and to avoid the super sticky dough, I extracted some water from the soaking oatmeal/honey mixture, warmed it up and activated the yeast in that The dough was still sticky, but it came together with kneading.

My first try at a yeast bread in over 25 years and it was a major success!! A deliciously sweet and moistly dense bread! Just the way my family likes it. Would rate recipe a five but made the following changes based on taste and only having instant yeast: added just a little less than 1/2 cup of warm water, in splashes, after each addition of flour;  kneaded in a handful of raisins;  only proofed dough once; brushed on honey and sprinkled with oats before baking to avoid sticky tops; made one loaf and six buns. Ambrosial warm and freshly baked with butter and excellent with peanut or nut butter  of your choice. Yum!

definitely too much water in this recipe! but I like the idea of soaking the oats. I let them sit in water in the fridge for a few hours (which I always do with my steel cut oats for oatmeal and stuff). the bread probably would have tasted better if i didnt have to add so much flour to compensate for the amount of water i put in!

This is a great bread, easy to control the sweetness too.  I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour with no problem.  For those who say it is too sticky, bread is a matter of feel.  Sixty years ago, an old cookbook I had, said to knead and add flour until the dough was as soft and smooth as a baby's bottom!  It has never failed. I also brushed the honey and sprinkled the oats on the loaf just before the second rising, taking care to keep the honey away from the pan so the bread wouldn't burn, it worked great.  This is a tasty, light bread that is just like an old favorite I lost when my house burned up in a wild fire.  Thanks for giving it back to me!

Edit: I made this bread again, using only 1C water in step 1 with the oats, and using the recommended amount of flour. I actually preferred the first version - this time, it didn't make enough dough for 2 proper sized loaves, and they were a bit dry.

I should have read the comments first! I'm surprised this recipe has such a high rating with so many problems. The water to flour ratio is VERY off - I had to add 3+ cups flour to get *almost* the right consistency - it was still very wet when I finally gave up to let it rise. But, it did rise, and I baked the loaves (1 in a 9x5, 1 in a circle loaf on a baking sheet). The flavor is very good and consistency is okay but it is too moist and hard to cut. If I were to make this again, I would only put 1 cup boiling water with the oats and go from there. I think the oats were meant to have soaked up all the water, which they didn't.

This worked up into a lovely hearty bread. Easy to make with a great taste. Be sure to cook it the full time. Even my husband liked it and he is not a bread eater. I will definitely be making it again.

This was my first time making bread, and this came out magnificently. I made very few changes: I added slightly more honey to the dough, and a 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon dusting atop each of the loaves prior to baking as well as a single teaspoon of cinnamon mixed into the two tablespoons of warm honey drizzled on top after baking. The cinnamon helped give the honey topping a distinct color against the bread, as well as an added depth to the overall flavor.

The bread came out great. I made one regular loaf and two 'baguette' shaped loaves, and they're delicious. It would have gotten five stars, except that the ratios are WAY off, the recipe wouldn't have worked as written. I reduced the liquid by 1/2 cup based on other reviews and still had to add significantly more flour than the recipe called for. If I make it again, I'll take the time to document the exact tweaks that were needed to make it work.

Overall, this is a good bread recipe. It tastes and smells wonderful, looks incredible, and is generally very yummy. However, the were a few places where I thought changes could be made. Like a number of other reviewers, the main change I would make upon my next bake would be to reduce the water by almost half, both in during the soaking stage and starting the yeast. If all the water is used, the dough ends up being too sticky to even pick up, let alone knead. My solution was to just keep adding flour until the dough was workable, which turned out fine, but if you have a limited amount of flour, cut the water. My bread still rose wonderfully, even with a ton of extra flour, so that at least works in a pinch. Make sure your kitchen is warm for the proving process to work fully. The only other thing I would alter would be the cooking time. Maybe it was my oven, but 30 minutes was just not enough to cook the inside fully. The top was beautifully brown, but the inside, even after returning to the oven for an extra five minutes, was still undercooked. With those changes, this recipe is a winner!

I made this, but I did do one thing differently. I simply microwaved the oatmeal mixture in 30 second increments until it started to thicken and then put it in the freezer until it was close to room temperature. This cut down the time it took to make the bread by quite a bit and the bread was still very good. I would recommend doing this if you are impatient like I am.

This bread tasted alright when it was finished, however it was probably the biggest pain to make out of any bread I've ever done (and I'm a baker).  

The dough was incredibly sticky, even after adding an extra cup of flour, being kneaded in a kitchenaid for 10 minutes and then by hand for another 10.   

I'd suggest adding less water to begin with - maybe soaking the oats in one cup of water rather than two - and adding extra water as needed after the flour's been added.

Turned out great! As many other people already mentioned before, the 1/2 cup of water may not of been necessary because I ended up adding a LOT of flour while kneading as the dough was so soft. I also suggest putting the bread in three pans instead of two as mine ended up being too big and not cooking throughly. I also put the honey and oats on top of the bread before cooking it so the oats were golden and crispy. Overall, really loved the recipe and even my little brother who is usually very picky liked it.

We really liked this bread. It's dense without being heavy, has a nice soft texture, and a slight sweetness that makes it great for breakfast toast. Like other reviewers, I did a half whole wheat and half white flour mixture, and like other reviewers, I needed to add 2-3 cups more flour to make it come together (this is why I gave it four stars). Even so it rose well, baked well, and stayed fresh and soft for the three days it took us to eat it all. I will definitely make it again!

Made this exactly except subbed 1/2 flour with whole wheat.  SOOOOO GOOD!!  I like to make huge batches of breads and freeze them for my family instead of store bought bread.  The honey wheat recipe I've been using didn't turn out so well last time so I tried this one.  It's my new favorite!  My 3 year old keeps asking for another piece.  I tripled the recipe and it made 4 perfect loaves in my 12x4.5" Wilton loaf pans.  Definitely a keeper!

Wish I had read the reviews before trying this recipe. Being very new to baking bread I thought something was majorly wrong when the dough came out live a thick mush (made me think of Oliver Twist asking for more gruel), and I had followed the instructions exactly, placing the oats, etc. in the boiling water, letting it sit for an hour, etc. Fortunately, having had success with Amish White bread, I had an idea what the dough would look like if I wanted to knead it. (Almost said needed to knead it, but decided a groaner might not be needed). I added about a 1/2 cup of flour at a time until the dough was workable (ended up adding about 2 cups). I did not add the honey oats to the top (consider that an unnecessary garnish). It turned out great! My wife loved it and said I can give up the Amish Bread, though I doubt I will, both are very good.

Great recipe! I made a few modifications (halved the honey; replaced one cup of flour with whole wheat flour and added half a teaspoon of yeast like the others did;  and added walnut and raisins) and it still turned out well.  Crusty outside and moist inside. I mixed on high speed for about 10-15 minutes and resisted to add any extra flour. The dough was very sticky at first but became more and more manageable as the mixing went on.

This recipe is good. I changed it a bit. I use whole milk instead of water and used all purpose white flour. I don't scoop the flour out of the bag as this makes the dough heavy, I sprinkle it from the bag into the measuring cup. I make sure I don't use over 5 cups of flour.

After I scald the milk I put in 3 tablespoons of molasses and a 1/4 cup of honey and 2 cups of rolled oats and 3 tablespoons of butter. I stir it around and then add a half cup of cold water, i check with my fingertips if its feels really warm but not hot I will add the yeast, it should feel very warm but not hot. I put in the yeast and stir it around and then wait 10 minutes, add 2 cups of flour and stir it around and then add one more cup of flour.

I place about a half cup of flour onto the table and carefully scoop the dough out of the pan onto the flour and carefully just keep putting flour onto the dough and just lightly patting it in until I can start to kneed, it takes me about 3 minutes doing this and then I kneed about 3 minutes, put the dough into a bowl in a very warm place, sometimes the car is really warm and I set it in the car with a towel on it, don't set directly in the sun, did that once and it started cooking it slightly, just find a really, really warm place and set it there. 

I use to over knead and put in too much flour and now as soon as its not sticking to me, its still really sticky but not sticking all over me. I stop kneading and now it comes out great.

Hope this helps.

made this for the first time yesterday, and it turned out brilliantly :)only change I made was to use a sachet of yeast, rather than active yeast, which I put into the oats after the hour along with the flour. after reading other reviews, I was expecting a really sticky dough, but maybe not having that extra 1/2 cup warm water made a difference? think I used about another 1/2 cup of flour at most to dust during the entire kneading process, and the dough was a delight to work with, nice and elastic and smooth. made one loaf and one plait, and the loaf was demolished by the family in minutes. the plait I had to threaten my hubby and kids with serious pain in order to get them to leave it alone for breakfast lol. will definitely make again, sooner rather than later, and would strongly recommend this recipe to anyone looking to try it :)

This is one of our favorite bread recipes! We have to modify it slightly by adding more flour, totaling closer to 6 cups to get it to form, possibly due to the last addition of water and our elevation & humidity. I also don't brush the honey on and usually make one loaf into rolls or buns. This is a very good recipe, one I love making in my kitchenaid mixer and we all LOVE to eat!

Loved this recipe. Not too difficult to make either. This was my first time making bread and I was a bit unsure of how it would all turn out. After 4 hours, it turned out just fine!! :)

Wow! This bread is ah-mazing. I kneaded it by hand and because the original recipe has a really sticky dough, I ended up adding an extra 3-4 cups of bread flour until it was an easy to handle ball of dough. I didn't have rolled oats so I used quick cooking oats and let the oat and honey mixture sit for a little over an hour and it came out perfect. I am really amazed at how soft and moist this bread turned out as I was positive it would be chewy and dense because I added so much extra bread flour but it wasn't. It tastes kind of like a slightly sweetened sourdough bread. I will definitely be making this again and again! It is so easy and seems foolproof!! Thank you so much for this amazing recipe! :)

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I adjusted the servings for one loaf and followed the advice of a reviewer to let the oatmeal soak for the whole hour. My dough did not turn out wet and sticky. The only issue was that it rose a little lopsided, but that was probably because I put in my warm oven. Because the floor is even my  baked goods tend to follow the dip in the floor. No matter, the bread was delicious - warm, soft, slightly sweet. My white bread fanatic husband inhaled half the loaf.

This is perfection. I love this bread exactly as it is, and no matter what I do to it to mess it up (I'm forgetful), it still comes out amazing. This is the bread that I use to impress people when I go to their house.
Actually, I must say that I have only used AP flour, since I never have bread flour. It's still great. Also, this last time I used 1/4 ww flour, and it was great too!

I've tried this recipe twice, the second time with better results. I added 1/2 to 1/3c extra oatmeal and 1-1/4c extra flour. This recipe is really forgiving. As long as you let it rise, you're good to go. I found that my dough rose pretty slow.  It's  a delicious bread!

I just made my first of MANY loaves of this scrumptious  bread.  The taste, moistness &  texture  of this bread are some of the   reasons  to make home made bread.  
I too had to  add quite a bit of additional flour while  kneading.
Liked the way the oatmeal looks on top.  Sublime right out of oven.

Wonderful flavor!  I eat a slice for a snack, and that has never happened with any other bread in my entire life!  I added 1 1/2 cups raisins and 1 cup walnuts, and it makes super toast.  Due to so many comments about stickiness, I added 1 cup whole wheat flour + 1 Tbsp. gluten because of the whole wheat, and had almost 3/4 cup of flour left over.  Now I'm wondering if the left over flour was because (for the first time in my life) I used BREAD flour instead of all purpose.  So next time I'll do it exactly as written, measurement wise, with the only change being BREAD flour instead of all purpose and no added whole wheat to see if BREAD flour makes that much difference.  There is probably a reason that bread recipes call for bread flour, but I've never used it before.  Stay tuned.

The only thing I did not like about this bread was the honey brushed on top. It made the top crust sticky and a bit tough.  Otherwise,  this makes a very nice loaf with good flavor and texture. As other reviewers mentioned, I added an extra cup of flour. The dough was still a little sticky, but baked up nicely..

I tried this recipe for the first time yesterday. Dough was alittle sticky whenever you first knead it and even after the second rise but it is worth the irritation! I added flour to help but really with the oatmeal and honey it is going to soft and alittle sticky. BUT after you bake it (I didn't add the glaze of honey, I ran out of honey) it is so soft and delicious, only slightly sweet. My boyfriend and have used it to eat sandwiches and toast both uses were delightful. I highly recommend!

Best bread ever!  Was amazing for dinner hot out of the oven and even better toasted the next morning (what was left :)...Also a perfect texture for sandwiches.  I had no honey on hand so I used molasses.  It gave the bread a beautiful color.  Definitely saved to my recipe box!

This bread is absolutely amazing. I told my husband we were not allowed to eat one whole loaf the first night, but it was really hard for us to restrain ourselves... I swapped in 1 c of whole wheat flour and it was still fluffy and delicious.

Delicious!  And easy too.  It takes a long time, but it's mostly just waiting-around time, so perfect for a Sunday around the house.  I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems.  The dough was sticky, but that seems like a common occurrence - I kept flowering the dough and the board while kneading until it was no longer sticky.  Turned out perfectly.

This turned out amazing the first time although like many others, I had to increase the flour - by two cups. I doubled the yeast after reading the reviews.  I also used half wheat and half bread flour. I substituted an egg wash for the topping. The honey measure was perfect, in the background, and not too sweet. This morning, I was wondering what sort of jam I should get to compliment this wonderful bread when toasted but I discovered, to my delight, that plain old butter was all I needed for a perfect light breakfast! Goodbye store bought bread!

I really wish I would have checked the other reviews before I made this bread and saved myself some time. I also wound up adding over 2 cups of extra flour to deal with the sticky dough. Once that problem was solved everything went as planned and I ended up with gorgeous and amazingly delicious bread. I will make this again and again and again!

I just pulled the loaves out of the oven. they look great! In regards to the stickiness issue it wasn't an issue for me. You definitely need to soak the oats for the entire hour. Also if your having problems with it maybe you don't have the right oats, real rolled oats are a lot more absorbent than quick cooking or steel cut. I get mine from the health food store for about $2 a pound. I only used 1/4C of honey since I'm trying to get more of an all purpose bread and didn't want it too sweet. I also used wheat flour instead of bread flour, doubled the yeast (because of the change in flour density), and added two tbl. of golden flax seeds (whole) to the oats when steeping. They smell so good! I should have waited to write this until after dinner but I was too excited! UPDATE: Tastes as good as it smelled!

I made this for a pre-Christmas treat and my family loved it. It was so cake-like and delicate. Yum!
(I didn't brush the top with honey after baking because I didn't want it to be sticky.)

This recipe is easy and good in taste. This is the first trial and I' m definitely will try again in the nearest future.  I modified it with adding some almonds and dried grapes. Its much chewy.

While this version is good, I'm partial to the version we've been making for years, which includes molasses, wheat germ, and a variety of seeds (e.g., sesame, poppy, flax, others).

Substituted 1/2 of the flour for whole wheat flour, and did have to add a significant amount of additional flour to get to a kneadable consistency. Otherwise, absolutely delicious!

This bread is amazing! However, the bread needed almost 2 extra cups of flour to make a manageable dough. Though it took almost four hours to make the bread, most of the time was just letting it rise.

This is the second time for making this bread, and it is by far the best homemade bread I have ever had!  It comes out moist, and slightly sweet, just like I wanted an oatmeal bread to be. They rise beautifully and round up really nice on top.  My family only wants me to make this now.

Great recipe. My bread machine broke so I tried the "old fashioned" way and the bread was awesome. My hubby said it was the best I have made so far. And I have been making bread forever!

I made this recipe for a VBS tasting table. Shaped it into two large boules. while it spread more than I'd have liked, it was beautiful and so moist and tasty. With the extra honey/oatmeal on top, it was just perfect.  Will be making this in loaves for my family next.

This is the best bread recipe that I've tried so far.  I really liked the use of honey instead of sugar (like in many other recipes). I did need to add probably another cup of flour as I was kneading.  I used only whole wheat flour. To avoid the sticky end result that some people mentioned, before I baked it I drizzled honey over the top and sprinkled uncooked oats and wheat germ over that. The result was hearty, homemade deliciousness!

This bread is absolutely fantastic. It was only my second attempt at baking bread and it came out perfectly. It's so delicious that I've already eaten one whole loaf all on my own. Horrible for my diet, but the flavor is amazing. I think I might try adding nuts the next time, but really this bread is fantastic all on it's own.

This is the first review I've ever given on this website.  I've been using enjoying many, many recipes from this site and after following this one to the letter over and over again and enjoying loaf after loaf, I had to let others know how wonderful this bread recipe is!
It is very easy to follow, and the end product is to die for.

Great bread!  As some of the other reviewers mentioned, I also found it necessary to add some additional flour - about an extra cup.  I didn't have bread flour on hand, but used half whole wheat flour and half AP flour (White Lily).  Excellent result and well worth the time!

This recipe more than lives up to the reviews. I halved the recipe and added some spelt flour along with a cup of white flour and enough whole wheat to make the dough firm. I also threw in a handful of bulgur wheat and a mystery grain (possibly barley) from my cupboard. I will definitely be making this again.

The bread has good flavour, but it only gets 3 stars as I was disappointed with how little it rose. My yeast was new and I proofed it as per the recipe but it just didn't rise a lot especially after shaping into loaves. I followed the recipe exactly and I may try it again using a little more yeast. My family still enjoyed it though. Thankyou Leslie.

Wow!  This is delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe noted, however, did have to add more flour as I went, and also used 1 cup of wheat flour in place of one of the cups of bread flour.  It came out beautiful, and tastes wonderful!  Thank you so much!

I made this today with only a few minor changes. I substituted 1 cup of the bread flour for wheat flour. I also added approx 2 tbsp of flax meal. The rest of the recipe was the same. The flavor of this bread is INCREDIBLE. I put it in the bread machine for the dough cycle and then took it out for the rising and baking. The dough was a bit sticky but it turned out perfect. I would highly recommend this recipe. Thank you for sharing.

This was a nice oatmeal bread.  I added a couple handfuls of unsoaked oatmeal to the dough when I was almost done kneading to give it more texture and flavor, and also sprinkled some on top before I baked it.  I also used all whole wheat flour.  The result is a hearty, healthy and tasty loaf of bread.

Excellent!  Easy to follow recipe.  I followed the recipe to a tea and everyone loved it.  I gave one loaf to a friend and she snacked on it all day until she realized that she had eaten the whole loaf.

I was surprised by how light this baked up.  I used 1/2 WW and 1/2 bread flour.  You would never know the oatmeal was in the dough.  If I make this again I think I will either decrease the honey or increase it to make either a savory or a sweet bread.  Thanks for a change of pace.

Fantastic flavor - I'm a beginner at this, but after only trying a few other recipes, I know I'll be returning to this one. BUT... honey topping has to go! I'm serving this bread to toddlers, and it's a mess. BTW... toddlers love the bread too! Otherwise, like so many others here, I had to add quite a lot of flour to get the dough the right consistency. But... flavor of this bread is GREAT!

This bread rocks! Very good. As suggested, I did add additional flour but added it while I was kneading it. Omitted the honey and oats topping and instead brushed on melted butter and sprinkled oats on top. Made chicken salad sandwiches with the bread for dinner and my three year old even ate all her crust.

Good stuff!  I followed the recipe as written and it came out perfect.  Makes delicious french toast if you can keep it long enough (it was tempting to eat it all straight out of the oven).  Thanks for this one - it's a keeper!

This bread is awesome.  I made it tonight and ended up using almost 6 cups of flour!!!  However, itmade two perfect loaves, so I'm not complaining.  I am going to try adding in some ground flax, and maybe subbing in WW flour for the white (I used all purpose, not bread flour). Plus, I baked it for almost an hour (internal temp of 190 via a thermometer, rose to 202 deg. after removing). This is great, just needs a little rewriting :)

Excellent!  Moist and flavorful.  We ate almost the entire first loaf in 30 minutes.  This will be my go to recipe for bread now.  Thanks Leslie :)

This tastes wonderful!  I mixed this all by hand using 1/2 AP and 1/2 WW, and added 3 T. vital wheat gluten.  Oh, the aroma!  I kneaded in an additional cup of flour.  Will definitely be making this again; thank you for sharing the recipe!

This is an amazing, melt in your mouth bread recipe.  The crust is crispy and the crumb incredibly soft and moist.  I added an extra 2 cups of AP flour after doing 2 cups AP and 2 cups WW due to the stickiness of the initial dough.  I baked it in rounds on a bakers stone and was amazed by the flavor and texture of the loaves.  I highly recommend it with butter and honey, curled up on a comfy sofa.  I would not, however, recommend it for sandwich bread.    Amazing!

Really delicious!  I didn't make a single change to this recipe.  I'm not a very experienced bread-maker, but this came out just perfect.  My family loved this, and I will definitely be making this often!

This bread tastes awesome.  I made some modifications based on previous reviews, and I will need to play around with the recipe a little more. I let the oatmeal soak for longer than an hour and added the yeast directly to it (omitted the 1/2 cup of water) and had to add about 1 cup more flour as it was very wet still.  I subbed in one cup of ww flour.  I didn't have enough honey so had to add some corn syrup. I also replace one T butter with oil.  It took an extra long time for the first rise; next time I will add an extra tsp of yeast.  My kids loved this bread.

Absolutely delicious! The honey give it a light sweetness, and the soaked oats make it soft and chewy.  I substituted 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour for the all-purpose.  I also agree with other reviewers that this recipe does use more flour than called for, but do not just dump it in until the dough isn't sticky, knead in small amounts gradually.  It did take me awhile to knead the dough until it wasn't sticky anymore, but I tried to add as little extra flour as possible (I just kept re-coating my hands as I kneaded), and the texture of the finished loaves was light and soft.  We also ate our first loaf before it had even cooled!  Definitely a family favorite!

This was a great bread!  I added some rye flour since I was out of wheat, and also a big handful of sprouted wheat finely chopped in the food processor.  It made a moist, dense, and sweet couple of loaves that went perfectly with split pea soup.  I brushed the top of the loaves with egg yolk instead of honey.

This one is a keeper! I made it just the way it is but left off the topping out of pure laziness. Oh, and it needs more than 4 cups of flour -- a lot more. I didn't measure, just kept throwing more handfuls into the Kitchen Aid until it looked right. I think next time I'll start with 5 cups. It was a wonderful sandwich bread, possibly the best I have made so far. It's not too heavy, nice and soft, and has a slightly sweet flavor that neither gets in the way nor overwhelms. It is closer to a white bread than a wheat bread, but after making this I do not think I will make a plain white bread again. They tend to be too boring.

A nice texture, very easy to cut with few crumbs as result. Even better toasted. The oatmeal just dissolved in this recipe! It was a little too sweet to use with most sandwiches, but made great breakfast bread. Also, I tried putting all the dough into one bread loaf pan (only have one and many times the loaves turn out too small if I put in two), but this one really does need two loaf pans or should be halved! I got a huge loaf of bread, some of which spilled over to the bottom of the oven during baking.

Thanks to other reviews, I knew to add extra flour. This subtly sweet, chewy bread was a huge hit in my house! Though it took a bit of time, it was really easy to make (it was one of my first bread making attempts). Delicious!

I used milk instead of water. And I soaked the oatmeal in the milk for about 30 minutes before putting it in the bread maker.

Awfully crumbly and quite dry even though I waited the recommended time for each step.  I guess I am just not cut out for breadmaking.  The honey was tasty though.

Yay...my first time ever baking bread from scratch. It turned out great! I was so happy to cut into it and see it look like bread! After reading other reviews, I only used 1.5 cups of water to soak the oats and all in, but still ended up using probably close to 5c of flour by the end of the kneading. For some reason I added one dash cinnamon and 2 dashes nutmeg to the beginning oatmeal mixture. I also used 2 packets of yeast. The dough rose as it was supposed to the first time..maybe it's a beginner mistake, I didn't handle the dough much between punching it down and shaping the loaves, I will do that next time because the loaves didn't rise as much as I had hoped. I actually made 8-3x5 mini-loaves, baked with a pan of hot water on the bottom shelf in the oven. I baked them for just over 35 minutes but I think I should have left them in a few more minutes, but they passed the 'hollow knock' test so I took them out. They seem a little too moist and dense. Probably just my oven, or maybe the water wasn't supposed to stay in the whole time. Either way, I made honey butter to go with them, and have already eaten one and had one mail-order request haha. Absolutely great!!! I will make another batch soon with full size loaf pans.

This bread is truly amazing. It is very moist and has a great light honey flavor. I didn't measure flour, I just added to the dough looked right. I also used half whole wheat and half regular flour. I have made lots of bread recipes and this is one of the best!

I made this in my Kitchenaid and it turned out really well, with a couple of minor changes.  I didn't have any honey, so I used an equal amount of brown sugar.  I also found that it needed at least 2 more cups of bread flour than indicated in the recipe.

This bread is delicious, my husband was skeptical but loved it in the end. He came running upstairs with a piece for me to taste when it was ready. The only thing I did differently was change one of the cups of bread flour to wheat flour, next time I'll do half & half. This bread reminds me of fall because of the slight sweetness from the honey and it hardiness. Yum.

Awesome bread recipe!  I too used more flour...probably around 5 cups.  I quit measuring after cup 4 and just added till it was right.  Next time, I'll probably use part wheat flour as others did...and maybe even a few more oats.  I aggree it could use more yeast too!  Overally a wonderful consistancy and taste!  This recipe is a keeper!

This bread is absolutely delicious. I did end up using about a cup more flour, as all the other reviewers mentioned. The crust painted with honey and dusted with oats was lovely and an excellent touch to this already lovely bread. I would suggest adding more honey to the bread mixture to sweeten it up just a tad bit more. Or serve it with a honey butter. I ended up making a simple honey/butter mixture which really gave it that extra flavor. But if you don't have quite as big a sweet tooth as me, leave the bread as is. It's truly yummy.

This turned out great, just what I was looking for.  I think I even accidentally doubled the amount of oats and it still turned out great.  The honey/oat topping is a great touch.

very tasty! 
though like all other reviewers said, it needs more flour since the dough is sticky. other than that, it's nice and fluffy. Love the slight taste of honey. it's definitely a keeper! :)

Firstly, this is a lovely recipe. I did use 5 cups of flour and another 1/4c on kneading the dough! Used 1T. and 1/2tsps of yeast and half whole wheat and half high gluten flour. I used Dark Maple Syrup instead of Honey in both the recipe and on the topping. It's tastes so good just out of the oven with butter. Thank you so much for this recipe. It's been well loved by La Familia!

This is a wonderful sweet Honey Oatmeal bread, very moist and only lasted the family a day and a half, they couldn't take their hands off of it!

this was more dense than i like my bread to be -- but it tasted good -- i think that if i make it again i will have to use two pkgs. of yeast to get it to rise enough... ditto with the other reviewers - it needed between 1 & 2 cups more flour.

Delicious!  You will have to incorporate more flour (about 1 cup) into the bread.  I plan on making it again this weekend.

Definitely agree with the other reviewers...dough is too sticky as is according to recipe, must add more flour.  Tastes great though!!

I liked this bread; it turned out light and soft with a touch of sweetness. All in all, a good whole wheat bread.

It wasn't exactly what I expected, but still good.
