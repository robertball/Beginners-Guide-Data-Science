Love this receipe! It's easy and everyone loves it. The only modifications I do is I don't add the caraway seeds and add a dash of cinnamon and pick up the browning from the pork with a little chicken broth and pour on top before baking.

WOW! Was this good! I did this in my crock pot and omitted the sugar completely....Don't really know why you'd want a cup of sugar in this dish???
Deleted one star for that very reason. The sauerkraut was soooo good and even began to brown a little in the crock pot. The chops were falling apart and extremely tastey. Can't wait to make this again!

This was very good and very easy. I think I'll just make it on top of the stove in a covered saucepan next time. If you didn't like the kraut, use canned sauerkraut, the Bavarian style isn't as tart (or rinse it to remove some of the "sour").

Excellent recipe! Easy and delicious!  I used Bavarian sauerkraut which already has the caraway seeds in it; therefore, I did not need to add the extra caraway seeds. Also, Bavarian sauerkraut has some sugar in it; so, I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. I rubbed both sides of each pork chop with salt and black pepper prior to browning. I used a red delicious apple. Delicious! (I served with the allrecipes.com recipe for zucchini cornbread.)

Amazing. I did only use 1//4 cup of brown sugar as I had read in previous reviews. Perfect harmony of sweetness. I used smaller sized, boneless pork chops, so I browned them for about 3 minutes on each side - rubbed salt & pepper on the chops before browning them, and sprinkled a bit of sugar to get them to brown quicker. I baked them for 35 mintues instead of 45. Perfectly cooked. My husband and I both enjoyed! Thank you!

This was amazing and very similar to a dish I had at the Hirschgarten in Munich! I basically kept to the recipe, but I added 1 cup water to my brown sugar first, added half a chicken bouillon cube, and simmered that in the pan I browned the chops in before adding it to my sauerkraut stuffs. I also sprinkled the chops with cinnamon and nutmeg before topping it with the sauerkraut stuffs. Excellent! Thanks for the recipe! I served it with fried potatoes.

Delicious! I made 4 pork chops in an 11x7 pan. Used a 14oz. can of sauerkraut, 1 McIntosh apple and 1 Gala apple, 1 onion and 1 cup of brown sugar(will use less brown sugar next time). Did not have caraway seeds. Served with buttered whole wheat noodles and asparagus sauteed in olive oil with minced garlic. Excellent dinner.

I had no idea that this recipe of mine had been published until a couple of years ago.  Some reviewers commented that 1 cup of brown sugar is too much and I agree.  My Dad taught me to make it when I was a teenager and he never measured anything. I guessed that it would be 1 cup but I know that's too much.  The brown sugar does add a good flavor to the kraut but use whatever you think is enough. I always use the fresh kraut found in a clear plastic bag in the cold meat section.  Thank you for all the reviews and I hope you enjoy this family favorite.

This was delicious. I added black and white pepper and red pepper flakes to the sauerkraut mix. Was not too spicy at all. Also, deglazed pan after I browned the pork chops with 1/4 cup or so wine and poured it over the chops before I put on the kraut. Will definitely make again. Yum.

Made this almost exactly as written but I only had two pork chops which I put on top of the sauerkraut mixture in a slow cooker after browning them.  I was somewhat concerned about the amount of onion, caraway seed, and brown sugar, but I wanted to make it as written the first time around. I used a mandolin to cut the onion and apple into shreds so it would more closely resemble the sauerkraut and avoid large chunks of either.  Made some mashed potatoes to go with it.  I was surprised to find that after cooking just on the edge of boiling for about 4 hours, the caraway flavor did not overpower the dish, nor did it taste like onion.  While it was not overly sweet to my taste, I might cut back on the brown sugar next time to get a little more "sour".  But the sauerkraut when eaten together with the mashed potatoes was awesome.  Don't know what it is about that combination but it always hits a home run, as does corn and mashed potatoes eaten together.  Anyway, I will be making this again... thanks for an excellent recipe!

Super yummy! I only used half the brown sugar and rubbed the meat with salt and pepper before browning. Easy and hearty meal.

OMG MOST DELICIOUS chops I have ever made.  That was my husband's comment after his first bite.  It was so good, that he told me he was taking it to lunch with him the next day.  He just got home from work and told me that he was bringing another chop with him the next day for lunch.  I hardly ever comment, but since my husband just told me he is going to eat it again the next day for lunch, convienced me to write a review.  He said he loved the sauerkraut and I said, good thing I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, he told me when i make this next week, TO USE THICK BONED IN PORK CHOPS AND TO FOLLOW THE RECIPE EXACTLY AND USE THE CUP OF SUGAR...

This has to be the best chops and thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe.  I would give it 10 stars if I could
 I did add a few adjustments, before searing the chops I coated them with salt fresh black pepper, onion powder and after removing the chops I deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup of red wine and poured it over the chops before adding the sauerkraut.

My husband, whose parents are from Germany, said this was a very authentic recipe and absolutely loved it.  I cut the recipe in half to make 5 smaller, center cut chops.  Served with spaetzle and sauteed spinach.  Will definitely make this one again.

This was a delicious recipe!!  I seasoned my chops with black and white pepper, garlic powder and kosher salt and then pan seared them and placed in slow cooker.  I reduced the brown sugar to make it healthier to about 1/4c and it was still sweet enough.  I suppose you can even omit and sub applesauce.  Thus the reason for only four stars.  This recipe is a keeper!!

Loved this!  Followed other reviews and cut back the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Used a jar of Claussen's sauerkraut(32 oz)mostly drained of liquid, and cut back to 1 tsp of carraway seeds.  Left out the apples.  Made for New Years dinner with black eyed peas.  Excellent!

I was put on the spot to do something with the center cut loin pork chops for Sunday dinner.  Found this recipe and hit the ball out of the park!  I omitted the caraway seeds and no one noticed.  Easy to make, and a delicious alternative to the usual pork chops on the plate in brown gravy.

Good flavors - the whole family (mom, dad, 3 yr old, 2 yr old) enjoyed it. My only complaint is that the pork was overdone. I checked the temp at about 42 min, and it was already over 160! I think part of the problem was the sear time - I seared the pork for 4-5 min each side as directed, which seems like a long time to sear, so I think the pork was probably close to a good cook before I even put it in the oven. Next time I will sear for just a minute or two on each side, and then start checking temp after 30 min in the oven.

I have to give this 5 stars because of the rave reviews everyone gave it.  I followed the recipe in terms of ingredients, though I only had 5 chops instead of 8. I did not change the serving size for the other ingredients and am glad I didn't.  The sauerkraut and apple made a great side and went well with the leftover mashed potatoes we had in the fridge. I did not follow the cooking instructions just because of schedule.  I seasoned the chops with salt and pepper and then browned them just long enough to get a good sear. Then I put them in the crock pot, threw the sauerkraut mixture on top and cooked on low for 4 hours.  It turned out great and was so easy so it was definitely worth the investment.

Totally bumbled this up and forgot to add the brown sugar.  d'oh!  It tasted good anyway but I didn't care for the smell.  It was my first time cooking with sauerkraut and probably my last.  Not sure if the brown sugar would have masked that part of it for me.  Hubby enjoyed it and will probably make it for himself when I'm out of town.

We love this recipe.  I used 3 pork chops and a whole bag of kraut.  I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and next time I'm going to try 1/8 cup.  You can always add more but you can't take it away if it's too sweet.  This would be awesome in the crock pot.

I'm not the biggest sauerkraut fan....but being from central pa, i had to give this a try to bring in the new year.  I liked that it was easy and could bake in the oven.  I did not use the brown sugar.  After  browning the chops, I deglazed the pan with white wine and poured this over the chops, also added salt/pepper/garlic powder to chops while browning...will make again this way (but only on new years!)

The Pork Chops were great.  We used really thick bone in chops, I am going to try no bone in chops next time.  The Family LOVED the sauerkraut.  They loved the different taste than just plan sauerkraut & pork chops.  One daughter thought it was too sweet, so I may have been a bit heavy handed with the brown sugar, I can always try and reduce the amount I put in next time.  Time was perfect, may reduce the time a bit but that could be my oven. Overall my Mother-in law who is the ultimate judge complimented it and said we should make it again.  Winner winner!

Well received dinner.  Followed as written in the future I will sauté the apples & onions prior to mixing with sauerkraut to insure apples are cooked thoroughly.

The simplicity of this recipe is amazing. I seasoned the pork with salt and pepper. I used a pink lady apple and added a red pepper. I omitted the caraway seeds because I don't like them and used the bavarian saurkraut as recommended by previous reviewers. I served it with buttered rice noodles. I actually forgot the brown sugar and honestly didn't miss it! The pork was so tender. So easy and delicious. Will make again!

I made this recipe but due to family dietary restrictions (my husband is diabetic) I made some changes. I cut the recipe in half because I hate to be stuck with food we don't like. I used 4 cups of homemade sauerkraut no seeds, 1/2 an apple, no onion (I am allergic) and after I browned the chops I deglazed the pan with a couple of tablespoons of hard apple cider. Then I put the meat back into the pot, covered it with the kraut mix and baked it for about an hour. My family loved it. Will make it again.

I used a green apple, and put in about half the amount of sugar.  Went light on the caraway seeds, as there is already caraway in the family sauerkraut recipe.  Delicious!  This meal disappeared fast!

Growing up in Germany, it's hard to find authentic recipes I can make that are written in English.  This one did it!  I left out the carraway seeds because I'm just not a fan of carraway.

Blech.  My porkies were dry and the mixture of sauer with the apple and onion just didn't work.  All I tasted was sauer. I took someone's advice and didn't add all the brown sugar. That might have helped had I used more, I guess.  

BUT the recipe doesn't specify how big a porkie. Mine were pretty thick and I browned them against my better judgment.  I think if  had just thrown it all in the oven, my pork would have been perfect.  I only cooked them for 40 min. too....

My husband loved this!  And it was super easy.  I ended up making a half recipe because for 2 people 8 chops is a ton of food.  This will become a staple for us.  We also like to use a little more kraut than suggested.

My family found this dish to be delicious!  A few minor changes -- I halved the recipe (but still used a full apple, actually about an apple and a half), used pure maple syrup instead of brown sugar, one 14 oz can of sauerkraut, and only used 1 tsp of caraway seeds.  Oh my - so good!  The sauce is wonderful. Definitely a keeper.

very easy to make. I cut down brown sugar to 1/4 cup but still too sweat to our tastes. I think depneds on the type of apple? (I used golden delicious).

This is a very simple recipe that’s flexible enough to adjust for the dietary or taste preferences of those seared at the table.  I accompanied it with egg noodles and a few slices of black bread.  It’s certainly worth keeping this recipe at the top of the list.

Four starts instead of five, because we used only 1/2 cup of sugar, and a very tart apple. I imagine it would have been a bit too sweet with the full amount of sugar. That said, we keep returning to this recipe. It's a great winter dish, particularly delicious over mashed potatoes.

I liked it...my family not as much. They aren’t big kraut fans but it is a great food for the gut! Used 1 can of kraut and about 1/2 amt of caraway seeds (all I had anyway) and I thought it was great.

I only added 2 Tbs of brown sugar and if you have someone who doesn’t like sauerkraut rinse it first and that removes a lot of the bitterness. My wife who has suffered through my families tradition of pork and sauerkraut absolutely loved this.

This was just the recipe I was looking for.  I wanted to cook 2 pork chops, so used 1/2 apple and 1/2 jar sauerkraut.   Next time I will slice onions into rings, as I don't care to eat them and they would be easier to pick out.  My meat thermometer went off after about 30 minutes, so watch your cooking time.  I think this will be even better tomorrow as a leftover.

Great recipe EXCEPT even the wonderful cook who added this recipe admits her guess of how much sugar is in this family recipe was probably too much!! This is a 5 star recipe if you add the sugar to taste starting out with only 1/4 cup (IF you want to add it at all and I do but my husband doesn’t like it sweet so we only add a little to counter the sour). The apple and the cooked pork juices and sweet onion will temper the sour so unless you want a sweet dish do not add one cup sugar. My Czechoslovakian grandmother loves this dish very sweet so it is up to the person who is eating it.  This is a very good dish next to buttered and salted boiled potatoes or egg noodles.

Super easy and oh so good! The sweetness of the brown sugar mix with the sauerkraut was wonderful. I chopped up some leftover Thanksgiving ham and added it to the kraut for a little added yum factor!

I used homemade Kraut.  I only had two, thick cut boneless chops.   But I made the kraut "dressing" for four.  I didn't care for it, but husband (of German rearing)  RAVED!  he's already asking when I'll make it again.    It was a home run!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Really good! I had two center-cut pork chops, so I scaled it down to two. I used a 14.5 oz can of sauerkraut which was a lot for two chops, but I like it, so no problem. I specifically got some red delicious apples and used about a half of one. I did omit the caraway seeds. I followed a reviewer's suggestion of adding some chicken broth to the pan after the chops were sauteed. That was then poured over the kraut mixture before placing in the oven. It was ready at 45 min, but maybe I should have checked it earlier. Pork seems to always come out on the dry side. Nice dish that certainly tastes of the fall season!

I used half of the brown sugar based on other reviews. The pork chops were very moist. My husband and I both enjoyed the flavors and will definitely make it again.

This was comfort food my mom would prepare in winter. She did not add the sugar. Instead she doubled the amount of apple and just before serving it she would stir in 1 cup of sour cream with the sauerkraut. Oh...the memories!

I used my own sauerkrau,t which is not as sour as commercial kraut, so I cut the dark brown sugar down to 2 tablespoons.  The pork chops were quarter cuts so there are about 12 thin chops.

Really this is excellent, but under NO CIRCUMSTANCES add 1 cup brown sugar! I literally added about 2Tbsp and it was perfectly sweet enough. Even if you hated sauerkraut and wanted to completely mask the taste 1/2 c would be plenty. Also, I didn't brown the chops ahead and didn't add caraway seeds as I used Bavarian style that already had them.

This was easy and delicious. If I'm making it for myself, I use all ingredients as listed.  My husband likes it plainer, so for him just the sauerkraut  dotted with butter.  Either way, very enjoyable.  This is one of those recipes that evolves with tou  as you make it - which are always the best recipes.

I was searching for a recipe that my mom use to make. This seemed just right, except I've made some additions, to make it a ONE dish meal....I layered sliced potatoes in a 9 x 13 casserole.  I browned the chops slightly, with salt and pepper, before adding to the casserole. I topped with chopped apples and kraut mix.  I baked it in the oven for   2 1/2 hours at 350, covering half-way through cooking time.  The potatoes have a wonderful flavor  and the chops can be  cut with a fork!

Excellent! A bit less brown sugar and grate in an entire apple. I used 4 very thin pork chops so barely seared then baked for thirty minutes.

Great recipe but could use some help. I cut the recipe by 75%(only cooking two chops). How do I adjust the cooking time? These were overdone.

I used half the sugar but, my husband still didn't like the sweetness the apples added.  I might choose more tart apples next time.
I served this with mashed potatoes and steamed red cabbage. It was a delicious, hearty, easy meal.

I cut brown sugar in half and it was plenty sweet.  Also, didn't have caraway seed, but will use it next time.   Very good, and plan to make it again.

I took the advice from others and cut down on sugar a bit.  Used country style ribs  from my freezer.  Will make again, easy and very tasty.

This is very easy to make and is comforting to smell while in the oven. I only made three cutlets, which may have thrown off the time in oven, as I overcooked the pork, I also didn’t add onion; but, the flavor was amazing. I cannot wait to make this again! Highly recommend. And thank you to the author for sharing the recipe’s inspiration!

This was outstanding! I had never had sweetened kraut before and was skeptical, but I made the recipe as written. The flavors just work so well together!  The brown sugar and apple toned down the sour flavor without making the dish overly sweet. I am usually not a huge fan of caraway seeds, but they added a kind of pungent note that is so nice here. I have to say this is now my (and my husband's) favorite pork and sauerkraut recipe.

I suggest using much less sugar. I only used 1/3 cup, and I could have cut back even more. I can't even imagine how sweet it would be with the full cup of sugar. Otherwise very good.

Been making baked sauerkraut and pork for years! Drain in a sieve 1 lb sauerkraut from a jar or bags -the best. Place loosely in a glass baking dish, toss with ample drizzle of olive oil, chopped raw thick sliced bacon, sliced shallots, and diced apple, no sugar or salt! sprinkle with ground peppercorns or Mrs Dash Table Blend pepper mix the best (I use it on everything!). Bake in 325 to 350 degree oven, turning every half hour for two hours. In a separate baking pan place the pork, drizzled with olive oil and seasoned with sliced shallots and carrot chunks and quartered potatoes and bake along side the sauerkraut during last 45 to 1 hour. Best Sauerkraut Dinner ever!

Way too sweet! We love pork chops baked with sauerkraut, but adding all this brown sugar ruined it for us. Simple baked pork chops under a pile of sauerkraut gets our vote. Easier, healthier and much tastier!

Delicious. After browning the pork chops, I added the onions, apples, brown sugar (I only used 1/4 cup), and about 1 T of butter to the same pan to brown and lightly carmelize the ingredients before mixing them with the sauerkraut.  Whole family loved it!

Rinsed sauerkraut, added 1 cup broth, omitted sugar.   Layered ingredients.    Browned (in butter) and baked for about 2 1/4 hours in my nifty stovetop to oven pan.    Added potato chunks for the last hour. Removed cover for last 1/2 hour.   We loved it.

I made a few minor changes. I did not put the brown sugar in or the caraway seeds as we love the tart taste of the sauerkraut and my family does not like caraway seeds. I also chopped the onion in larger pieces and I peeled the apples and then sliced them as I do when making a pie. I also did not drain the sauerkraut and  sautéed the kraut and onions for about 5 minutes just to pick up the browned pieces that were in the frying pan from browning the chops it  definitely gave the dish a nice golden color as well as picking up more of the flavor from the browned chops. My family loved the dish and it was so easy to make with  minimal mess and clean up . Will definitely be making again.

I made this with 2 thick center cut chops, half  of sauerkraut, onion and apple, 1/2 tsp caraway seeds and about 1 tbsp of brown sugar. Browned chops in olive oil with sprinkles of pepper, salt and garlic powder. Cooked in a convection oven @350 for 40 min and the temp was 165 so next time I'll check the temp at 30 min. and decrease oven temp to 325. Yummy flavor!

Enjoyed very much. Had to cook longer because my chops were thick.  Only change to recipe-I used less caraway (but def use them its a must) and I added potatoes.

This was relatively quick and easy considering I had ALL ingredients on hand. It turned out beautifully! Tender, flavorful, perfect. Definitely will make again!

It was very tasty & we will definitely make again. I had a small pork roast so I used one 15 oz can of Libby's Bavarian Style Sauerkraut with caraway seeds, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 apple and 1 1/2 teaspoons caraway seeds. We cooked in slow cooker and served with mashed potatoes.

We are 65 and 75. Made it as described in recipe. Never had sauerkraut taste so good. This is the first time I did not lose half my sauerkraut in a recipe. So good to eat.  Pork was moist not dry. Used the meat thermometer till it said pork cooked. Also cooked the onions in the juice after browsing pork.  Used an enamel pot with lid in oven.

Delicious! I didn't have caraway seeds so I added some cinnamon like someone suggested in another review. The whole family devoured this dish!!! I will definitely be making this again and again and again.... :)

Pretty sure it's gonna be just fine. I didn't have any apples, so I threw some of this Bolthouse Farms C Boost in it which is mostly pears. I tossed some lightly burnt bacon crumbles in with the sauerkraut with garlic/onion and some random amount of brown sugar and thyme.  Just realized I forgot the foil on top but not sure I'm gonna go down and put it on there. Oh well.

Very good recipe but it seemed like it was missing a little something. I did not use the caraway seeds, so that may have been it.

Great, easy recipe. Pork is very tender and the kraut has good flavor. Used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar since we had sweetness from the apple. Added a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar too.

Absolutely delicious! My favorite of all baked pork chop recipes, with a few modifications: I'm not a fan of caraway seeds, so I didn't use them.  I love brown sugar, but substituted coconut sugar since it has a lower glycemic index compared to regular sugar. I used a sweet onion. The sauerkraut I used was a traditional Old World recipe that contained no sugar, vinegar or preservatives.  It came in a refrigerated glass jar.  My husband raved over this dish. He said "You couldn't get a pork chop this good in a five star restaurant!"  I've tried many pork chop recipes over the years and this surpasses them all. This will now be my "go to" recipe!

Superb recipe!  The only change I made (since I did not have any apples available) was to add a 16oz jar of Motts Cinnamon Apple Sauce to the dish while cooking as a substitute for the fresh apples. It was an incredible dish with our dinner guests begging for more! I will be making this recipe more often,it was a HUGE success! Yummo!

I used red cabbage instead of kraut, no sugar; didn't have an apple. That's why I gave 4 stars, because I didn't follow the recipe.

I'm thinking i know what the original recipe is supposed to be (we, germans, often use Ham or ribs instead of pork chops) and would never serve it with noodles, but other than that its pretty close to our traditional recipe. almost like my me-maw's :)

Notes from family members: Mom- needs less apple & more sauerkraut , brother-needs pineapple, nephew -less onions, my kids like the onions sautéed a little before combining everything. My dad & I like it just the way it is:)

This was really good.  I didn't add the caraway seeds when I tried the recipe.  I might try them next time.  Two other changes I will be making next time:  1) saute the onions with the pork chops (they didn't cook all the way when baking); 2) reduce the brown sugar to probably 3/4 cup rather than the full cup (it was a bit too sweet).  Also a little piece of advice, use a thermometer when baking.  I think it maybe cooked 30 minutes.

I halved the recipe and I must say - it just qualified as a 3.  Somehow, it just wasn't as delicious as I thought it would be.  I will eat it...but I won't make it again.

My husband could not stop raving about this and he is not a sauerkraut fan.  I salt and peppered the chops before browning.  I deglazed the pan with about 1/3 of a cup of white wine and poured that over the chops before piling on the sauerkraut.  I left the caraway seeds out and reduced the brown sugar to about 1/3 of a cup.  My chops were done in 35 minutes.

This was delicious!!  I didn't use caraway seed as DH doesn't like them, but otherwise followed the recipe to the dot except for adding more brown sugar to the sauerkraut.  I love sauerkraut with added brown sugar and it is the only way my hubby will eat it.  The addition of the apple was great.  I'll be doing that from now on!

This was a very good recipe. Easy to prepare and good flavor. I drained and rinsed the kraut and only used 3/4 cup of brown sugar.The caraway seed and apple really gave it a good flavor.  Will make it again I'm sure.

Only recipe with sauerkraut my husband will eat:-). I also add enough apple cider so that it starts to top other ingredients.

This was so tasty (and easy)! The caraway seeds make a big impact. I modified a bit by adding canned apple pie filling with 1 fresh cut up apple to keep the chops more moist. My family loved it, thanks for sharing.

I loved this dish! I am not a cook, but I try, and this was so easy. The only difference I made was not using the caraway seeds.

This is a great easy , good, recipe ... I add a dash of salt and pepper, a few pats of butter on top, and throw in a few whole cloves .. it just gives it a little more flavor :)

Tried this recipe for the 1st time tonight. Made according to directions, except for the amount of sugar. As we don't like sauerkraut too sweet, we reduced brown sugar to about 1/4cp. This was definately unique...Unsure if I will make this again. It wasn't bad, just not really to our taste.
