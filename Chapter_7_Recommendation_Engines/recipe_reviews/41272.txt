Great recipe, taste like the ones at the restaurant where I work.  One note, if your biscuits do not rise, try placing them on the baking sheet touching, it gives them more support to rise together........I learned that at work after a few flat tries!

This is the most excellent buttermilk biscuits I have ever made!! I made 42 BIG ones and laid them on cookie sheets to quick freeze then put them in a bag. I work 8am -5pm and it is so nice to go home and pull them out already ready to go in the oven!! super recipe!!!

I made these biscuits and wasn't impressed, my daughters liked them.  they came out flat.  So since I thought that maybe I did something wronge I made them again.  This time much better results, also I added 2 tspoons of sugar. Much better and they were gobbled up.  FYI I was only able to get 8 nice size biscuits from this recipe.

I cannot believe how easy these were! I've always avoided making biscuits because of the time and mess involved, but these came right together and taste great-- just the sort of biscuits I loved as a kid.

Not sure but I might have done something wrong...these came out tough and somewhat heavy and flat.  Flavorwise, they were great...had sausage gravy over them.  Will try again, in case it was something I did :)

I made these biscuits along with Buttermilk Fried chicken and gravy.  They were good, especially served the next morning as biscuits and gravy, however they were pretty flat.  I see the review saying to try putting them together so they will rise.  The taste is good enough to merit trying them again with this technique.

These are EXCELLENT! Here's what I did: I used butter because shortening has trans fat. I used 2 tbsp more than called for in the recipe. I combined the dry ingredients in my food processor and I cut the cold butter into cubes and added to the dry ingredients and processed until completely combined. I removed the flour mixture from the processor and added the exact amount of buttermilk (I used lowfat buttermilk) called for. I mixed until JUST combined, then I used my hands to turn the dough to combine the last bits of dry ingredients at the bottom. I then formed it into a ball (no kneading!) by just pressing, and I placed on my floured surface and gently rolled to 3/4" thickness (I found 1/2" to be too thin!) The trick with dough is to not overwork it. You do not want to knead this and you don't want to over-roll it, either. I then cut these and baked at 450 for 8 minutes and they came out absolutely delicious! Follow directions and don't overwork and you too will get great biscuits!

WOW, I had never made buttermilk biscuits before, this recipe is such a breeze. The end result is fantastic, soft, moist biscuits.  They make the house smell wonderful and reheat well in the microwave without drying out.

I made two batches, both without rolling out the dough - just shaping it by hand. The first batch I made exactly according to the recipe, and they turned out alright - slightly hard and not so tasty. But by the second batch I only had 1/2 cup of buttermilk left, so I substituted 1/4 cup skim milk, and added 2 teaspoons of sugar, as well as a healthy sprinkling of dried oregano, and adding at least 2 tablespoons extra of shortening. Wow, the second batch turned out perfect, crumbly on the outside, soft and warm and buttery inside! I will definitely make these again, and hope they turn out as good as the second time!

these are great! check your baking powder and soda if your biscuits come out flat. these ingredients should be replaced once a year (i buy new just before the holidays, when baking ingredients are on sale). if you increase the buttermilk by a scant 1/4 cup you can make drop biscuits!

Not too bad. I think that I ran into the problem of adding all the flour when I should have added about 3/4 due to the weather conditions of the day. However, I found them to be flavorful and the texture was OK; a little tough, but I fear that I overworked the dough; again, I blame the weather and flour. I will try these again, they had a great flavor.

These are okay.  I took the advice of others and tweaked the ingrediens, including the addition of sugar.  I'd leave the sugar out next time, that is, if I made them again.

I thought these turned out great! I did use butter instead of margarine and followed another reviewers advice to use an additional 2 tbsp. Save yourself the expense and drawer clutter of a biscuit cutter, I just used the mouth of a cup.

Pretty good biscuits.  I added 2 more tablespoons of butter and used a cup of regular milk.  They are nice because they don't use yeast.

Pretty good biscuits, i tend to moneky with the proportions a little bit...and i find that they need a little extra shortening and a touch extra buttermilk to be really spectacular.  As is, however, they are only 3 stars :)

This is the closest approximatation of the classic southern biscuit on allrecipes.com. My suggestions for successful baking are to use a soft wheat flour (i.e. White Lily, Red Band), handle the dough minimally, place  very close together on the pan and--for heaven's sake--don't try to substitute plain milk for buttermilk. To give the biscuits a "golden brown" appearance, try brushing the tops with milk before baking. Finally, a cold biscuit is a completely difference can of worms: The texture WILL change once these cool, and they are 100X better eaten right after cooking.

YUM!! I didn't have buttermilk, so I made my own with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar and enough milk to make 1 cup total "buttermilk". (Let it sit for at least 5 minutes before using.) Just use 3/4 cup of it like the recipe calls for. I also used butter flavored Crisco in place of the shortening. It gave it an extra buttery taste.

This is only the second time I've tried to make biscuits and I thought these came out really good. Sometimes it's the simple things that come out really good and this is one of those things. I just patted out six good size biscuits ('cause that's the way my grandmother use to make her biscuits) and put them on the cookie sheet. It did take a little longer to bake because I made them a little larger than called for. I'll use this recipe again!

Excellent biscuit recipe SO moist and tender! Changes I made were to use 1/4 c butter + 2 T butter flavor shortening, 1 cup buttermilk and 1 tsp salt. And, I sift all dry ingredients prior to blending. KEY- DO NOT OVERWORK!!

I read the reviews from before and put the changes all together.  I changed 1/2 tsp salt to 1 tsp, 3/4 buttermilk to 1 cup buttermilk added 1 tbsp sugar and 2 tbsp more of butter flavored shortening.  It made these biscuits so flaky and moist.  They were very good, best biscuit recipe I've ever made with the alterations.

Since I altered this recipe somewhat, I am giving it 4 stars. (In place of the 2 or 3 I believe it deserves) I made the bisuits much smaller than suggested, into 1 1/2 inch "bites" to appeal to my children. They were very cute and tall, but as dense as river rock. The insides were tender, just too heavy. I am pretty sure, however, that making them larger would not change the dense texture. This Southern girl will proclaim that these are NOT gravy biscuits, but WOULD do well making sandwiches and served alongside heartier meat courses. Don't even DREAM of trying to save a baked batch of these later...even microwaving won't refresh them.

These biscuits turned out great.  Flaky, tender, tall, with a nice crunch to the tops and bottoms.  Instead of kneading, I gently worked the dough just enough for it to stay together, then patted into a rectangle.  Folded the rectangle over itself in thirds, and repeated twice.  This dough is a little on the dry side and you won't need much flour when you're working with it.  Then patted out into a rectangle a little over a half-inch thick.  I then cut the rectangle into 8 pieces and patted each gently into a rounder shape.  Baked in a buttered round metal cake pan with the biscuit sides touching for a taller final shape.  Took about 15 minutes in the oven and they were biscuit heaven.  For best 'fluff', make sure your shortening and buttermilk are very cold, and handle the dough as little as possible.  Sometimes it helps to also let the dough rest a few minutes before baking.  Replacing shortening with butter would probably add more flavor, but the shortening will give more flakiness.

I made these biscuits and I think the flavor would be much better with the addition of a tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of salt, not 1/2 teaspoon of salt, as stated. Brushing buttermilk on top of the muffins before baking gives them a nice shine. Otherwise, a good recipe.

These are pretty good biscuits. I usually make frozen ones but decided to give these a shot. Worked well for biscuits and gravy. I will probably keep using the frozen ones however.

These biscuits were good (it is hard to mess up biscuits) however I wouldn't call them fluffy, they were very heavy.  I made them with Saco buttermilk blend for baking but I don't think that is why they were heavy. I will keep my original recipe.

I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so I made my own by combining 4 1/2 tsp vinegar with 1 cup milk and letting it sit for 15 minutes.  The biscuits rose well, but the taste was bland.  Next time maybe I'll add some sugar.

I make these every Saturday morning because they rise so great & are SO EASY - I use the 2% milk we have in the fridge instead of going out to buy the butter milk & I just pull off chuncks & form them by hand, they are a tadd less fluffy than dense - maybe that's why.
