We really enjoyed this but since I made some changes, I can't give it five stars.  First,  I cut back on the ginger and garlic by half as I didn't want it to be overpowering - I figured I could always add more if necessary.  I didn't have siracha sauce so I used Frank's Hot Sauce.  I also added cut up raw chicken to cook with the veggies.  I also didn't have ramen noodles so I used broken up rice noodles which I cooked as per the package instructions.   Next time I will increase the spices a bit more.   I will definitely make again.

This was excellent! Down in the footnotes the recipe submitter said that sesame oil could be used instead of peanut butter. I love the flavor of sesame oil and do not keep peanut butter on hand and so sesame oil it was. I had some mushrooms that needed used and threw them into the mix and they worked nicely. I halved the bok choy because 4 cups seemed like a lot and I have mixed feelings about my decision. It could have used more texture wise but the flavor was there and quite pungent . This would be good with all sorts of different veggies. Snap peas and asparagus are the first to come to mind. This recipe is a keeper and one I will make often. Thanks for sharing!
