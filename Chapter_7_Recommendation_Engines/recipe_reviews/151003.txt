I made this with Jello instant sugar free cheese cake pudding and pie filling. I am diabetic it is hard to find recipes that taste this good and I can eat. My non diabetic husband liked it so much he asked me to make it again the following week. He couldn't tell it was almost sugar free.

Delicious! I will definitely make this many times. Changes I made: I used homemade cranberry sauce, and I forgot to put the walnuts in the middle, so they just ended up on top.
