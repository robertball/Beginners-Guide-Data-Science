This is fantastic!  Now a weekly staple in my diet!  Can eat with pita or veggies.  Blend with hummus, pickled beets, etc, for a more traditional Middle Eastern meal.   Yummmm!

I liked the recipe. I was looking for a recipe for veggies. I put less mint and salt than the recipe called. Also, added some garlic.

Creamy deliciousness! As written in the notes regarding the herbs, I used mint and basil...and loved it. Thank you for the recipe.
