I replaced 1/2 the oil (used regular vegetable oil) with applesauce, used only 1/2 cup sugar, added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and omitted the raisins.  I also baked as mini muffins instead of a loaf.  Yummy!  Chewier than regular zucchini bread.

Yum!  Light in color and texture.  The raisins add great flavor.  I used 1/4 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup oil and it worked great!
