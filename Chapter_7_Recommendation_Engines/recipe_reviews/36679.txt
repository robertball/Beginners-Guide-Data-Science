Brilliant.  I used catfish instead of cod -- it gives the stew a little more oomph.  Also, be sure to cut the potatoes into smaller pieces; if you leave them halved, they don't cook all the way through.

The flavor was good, but the recipe had all of the pieces of the stew in entirely too large chunks.  I had a hard time eating this.

I never tire of this stew - it's fantastic!  I often use only half the suggested amount of potatoes and add more liquid.

This was very good!!  I also added other seafood bits in there and subsituted sliced taro instead of potatoes.  I also mashed half the taro to thicken the sauce and served the stew over black rice.  Good seafood stew recipe!

try slicing potatoes into thin rounds. yhey will cook quicker without over cooking everything else. I have a similar recipe that my dad taught me, he was raised in a portruguese fishing village. you can use any firrm wight fish. also try adding shrimp, crab, lobster or clams. place shellfish or mollusks at bottom and fish on top.
