I loved this cocktail! It was so refreshing!  I didn't notice until I got home that I accidentally bought grapefruit juice cocktail, so, it was probably  sweeter than using just grapefruit juice, but, we really enjoyed it.

Good grief - this was delicious!! I served it at a coed wedding shower and it was such a hit we had to go buy more champagne. We used grapefruit juice and it was perfect for our group!
