Really, really good! I put in as much spinach as I could, as others have suggested and it was awesome. We also added in more pesto- try 1 1/2 or 2 tablespoons.
Really easy and really fast. Thanks!

This was quick and tasty. I make something similar and never thought to add sour cream to it. I made it for a family dinner, and there were no loeftovers.

This was so simple and an easy way to clear up leftovers and make a presentable meal. I made it for my roommates and there was nothing left! I did listen to the one review who suggested the red pepper flakes and the garlic though, it added a great flavor!

I thought this was good and easy, but lacking something.  I added some garlic, but next time I might add red pepper to give it a kick.

This recipe was quick and easy. I liked the fresh spinach. I also used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. However, the sauce did seem a little bland. I tried adding crushed red pepper to liven it up, but it didnt seem to do the trick.

We enjoyed this dish very much: no leftovers. I made it because I had a lot of fresh spinach left that I wanted to use. I wish I had chopped it a little first. I added about 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce, and that provided a nice kick. Next time, I will make the recipe with a full pound of pasta and double the diced tomatoes but keep the sour cream amount the same, using as much spinach as I can fit!

This was pretty bland even with the suggestions from other users. I added in oregano and pepper flakes to kick it up. The sour cream became gritty upon mixing it with the sauce though.. I wonder why?

This was a pretty good dish.  I took some notes from the other reviewers and from the "Spinach Tomato Tortellini" recipe from this site.  I used a can of diced tomatoes, a box of frozen chopped spinach, and a small onion.  I flavored it up with Italian Seasoning, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and chili flakes.  I used celantini pasta because it held the sauce very well.  For those who complained of grainy sour cream, don't add it until the very end before serving.  If the sour cream cooks, it gets grainy.  Pretty healthy, cheap, quick, and easy meal

A great go to when out of ingredients.  I didn't have sour cream or pesto.  In its place I sauteed some garlic in evoo, added a few shakes of basil, salt, and used Hellmann's mayo instead of sour cream.  Definitely can use more spinach.  I also added grated romano for a nice kick. My 2YO ate it all up.

THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING! If you add these few changes.. you'll feel like your eating restaurant style pasta! When adding the sour cream and pesto sauce to the spinach and tomatoes MAKE SURE you drain the tomato juice till there is just a little but left. This is after you cook the spinach but before you add the sour cream and pesto. Also I added about 7 more tablespoons of pesto than this called for and it just gave it amazing flavor. Along with this I grilled chicken and sauteed mushrooms to put in it, on the chicken I put a little bit of garlic powder. I'm not kidding, do these changes and you'll have a SIMPLY DELICIOUS dish.

Fantastic! I made the following changes: 16 oz of wheat pasta (doubled), about 2 pints halved cherry tomatoes (instead of canned), 3/4 cup fat free sour cream (instead of 1/2 cup), 2 tablespoons of pesto (instead of 1), and then added steamed fresh broccoli (about 3 cups), sauteed onions, Parmesan cheese, minced garlic, Italian seasonings and pine nuts. Healthy and delicious!! :) Husband loved it! I think the broccoli really made it. Thanks for the recipe! A nice change from regular spaghetti.

My dad really liked this, but I thought it was just okay.  Like others, I thought it was pretty bland.  I even used stewed tomatoes, oregano, sauteed onions, and chicken, but it just didn't taste like much.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 3 because my dad liked it so much, and it can be hard to get him to eat vegetables. o_o

I made this for dinner last week and followed some of the suggestions of others by adding diced chicken breasts, i put as much spinach as I could fit in the pan, and I added a few dashes of crushed red peppers.  It was really really good and my Fiancee really enjoyed it also!

It sounded good and thought I'd make it for my husband for dinner and when I added the sour cream, it looked like spinach tomato soup.  I added a small amount if oregano like someone else suggested.  Anyways, I didn't look very appetizing and when we both tasted it, we did not care for it!  Sorry, not for us!

It was so simple to make and absolutely delicious. But I stir fried some garlic and minced meat in olive oil so that the sauce is more exciting. Added also, a dash of tabasco sauce as I couldn't find any chili flakes. Works wonders!

Very quick. Taste is average.  I left out the pesto.  It would make a good base dish, and could be embellished a bit.

Good quick recipe...I pureed the tomatoes so not so chunky and added garlic and pasta seasoning to the processor. I didn't have enough sour cream so added a little cream cheese also. I prechopped the spinach and then used hand processor while cooking...my family doesn' like chunks! Everyone devoured! Oh and I only had penne on hand.

Thanks for the idea of using sour cream to make the tomato sauce creamy. I did add some mushrooms, garlic, a little onion, dried oregano and fresh basil. I also used 5 fresh tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes.

As some suggested not enough flavor but that is easily corrected.   Salt and freshly ground pepper of course but a few cloves of garlic and hot pepper flakes to taste.  The sour cream really is the crowning glory here and tastes much better than regular heavy cream.   Thanks for a good starting point.

I liked this a lot. I added chicken breast strips to it because we were eating it as a full dinner. It turned out really good- I think next time I will add more sour cream and more spinach.

Very tasty! This was a last minute recipe and I am so glad I tried it.  It took minimal time to prepare and is a great dish to get those veggies in.  I didn't have any basil pesto so I just added dried basil, olive oil and salt.

Added sliced chicken sausage and 1 large fresh tomato and I used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes.  Also went with low-fat sour cream and whole wheat pasta.  Topped it off with a sprinkling of shredded Parmesan cheese.  Delicious.  Would definitely make again.

Added bacon to this recipe, and added the juices to the sauce, and it seemed to give it that extra flavor the other reviewers thought was lacking.  I also used cream and cream cheese in place of sour cream.  Bring the yogurt to a simmer very slowly stirring the whole time or it will curdle!

This recipe was super easy, but very bland.  I added chicken, garlic, fresh basil and oregano like others tried, but it didn't make it much better.

This is quick and easy! When ever I see "bland" comments I go right to the garlic. I pressed 2 large garlic cloves(could have done 3. but I like garlic a lot) into aprox 2 tbls of olive oil with salt and Italian seasoning mixed in a jar. Then I strained the oil out into frying pan and sautade half an onion. I put the left over garlic in with the spinach (I do this so I dont over cook the garlic yet the oil still gives the onions a great taste. I could almost eat them plain like this.) to wait for mixing with tomatoes and onions when the onions are done. Other then doubling the pesto I followed the rest of directions and it turned out wonderful! Next time to make it more saucy I may almost double the tomatoe and sour cream and triple the pesto and add more garlic onion salt and Italian seasoning.

Rather bland.  I put in some dried oregano, garlic powder, and ground red pepper like some others had suggested and it was still pretty flavorless.  I'd suggest pine nuts though.  My husband makes something similar to this with pine nuts and it's really good.

My husband says this is a five star recipe, I would maybe only give it 4, but it was still yummy, and super easy!  I had everything I needed on hand!  I used italian seasoned tomatoes, but I think next time, I'll use plain and add the seasonings myself.

This recipe was quick and easy.  I used gluten free pasta and fat free sour cream to make it suitable as a gluten free, low fat meal.  It was great.

I am usually skeptical about adding sour cream to hot dishes but this time I tried and it was surprisingly well tasting.  It does punch out the tomato flavor out more; my family ate it all at once!

I doubled the recipe and left out the basil pesto. I added 2 pounds of sausage for my carnivore of a father. Everyone loved it, and they are all picky eaters! Thanks for the idea!

We enjoyed this pasta dish! I only had a can of olive oil-garlic diced tomatoes on hand and no pesto--so I sprinkled in some dried basil instead with it.  I thought it was great and can't wait to try it with the pesto next time! Thanks!

My family of boys really enjoyed this pasta.  I used two fresh tomatoes because I didn't have any canned ones.  My dad thought that it added more flavor anyway.  I did not add the optional ingredient but my family added Parmesan cheese after I served it to them.  They said it was a tasty finishing touch.

It was really good, but I used fresh tomatoes, which made the sauce really watery.  The recipe seemed bland so I also added in some cubes of chicken, some garlic, fresh basil, and nutmeg.  Next time I'll try it with less tomatoes, or with canned tomatoes like the recipe called for!

Rather than use sour cream I used about a 1/4 cup of light cream and 3 tablespoons of cream cheese and it made for a super rich creamy sauce!

I enjoyed this recipe!  Like others, I added garlic & onions first w/oil & butter, used fresh tomato and double the spinach.  Then added 1 cup of starchy pasta water and swapped goat cheese for the sour cream - YUMMY!

Very colorful and has lots of great veggies in it, but I found this sauce to be very bland.  My fiancé and I were adding a bunch of salt to our pasta to make it taste better.

This was really good. I did sautée some onion and garlic first, and also added a dribble of balsamic and some sliced black olives . That you can easily tweak this recipe with what you have on hand is a plus for me. Next time I may throw in some additional veggies, broccoli or peas. Note that the spinach really cooks down so you can add a lot more than you might think at first.

Fresh spinach from the garden. Added 6.5 oz. drained clams with a touch of garlic.  I'll do this one again.  4.5 stars
