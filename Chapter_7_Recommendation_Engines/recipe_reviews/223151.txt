I just made this recipe for the second time last night and I would be remiss if I didn't rate it, especially since I was asked to make it again. Last time I made it was Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The fact that it's cold kind of throws you but it's absolutely delicious. I have a 30 minute drive to the in-laws so I'm always looking for recipes that I don't have to reheat or that I can stick in a crock pot. This dip is perfect because I can make it ahead the night before,  refrigerate overnight while the flavors meld, then get to the party, pull the saran wrap off, throw Triscuits on a plate and voila! My 11 year old son (who hates vegetables and clams) helped me make it last night. While he stirred the vegetables on the stove top, he said "this smells amazing!" When he tried the finished product, he said "this is the best thing I have ever tasted, and I don't just mean that because I helped!" Thanks Chef John!!!

Most excellent! One of my all time favorite dishes, ever. I could eat this daily. My whole family loved it too, which was a downside since it disappeared too quickly. Prepared exactly as written.

I brought this to our July 4th party and everyone raved about it. We used fresh caught hard shell clams which we steamed open and then minced. I cooked the veggies and then added in the clams and cooked for about 5 minutes. I then mixed the clams and veggies and cream cheese together with about a 1/2 cup of cheddar and then baked the whole thing in an 8x8 pan at 350 for 20 minutes. It was awesome!!

Everyone loved this dip.  I think it could be served with hard breads, veggies, and other crackers.  It was better the second day and even better the third.

If you have not yet made this, you really should. Delicious comfort spread/dip (if there is such a thing). Plus, it seems easily to customize if you choose.

Would make a nice gift for a dinner invitation.

This was a lot of work for very little return.  I made it the day before and thought that the flavor would meld over night, however it was rather bland, not very clammy, and because it was made with all cream cheese, it was very stiff and hard to get out of the bowl.  I had to use a knife so that people could put it on very stiff french bread rounds.  Anything less tough than the french bread rounds would just crumble.

This was fantastic! I added a lot more peppers than the recipe called for, and it made the dip "meatier", if that makes any sense. I left out the green onion and cooked with onion powder instead. This dip was popular with everyone at my dinner party, but it is definitely a treat due to the amount of bacon fat and cream cheese. I would make it again!

Great either warmed or room temp. Outstanding flavors, even better with an appropriate adult beverage and Carr's Table Water Crackers.

The flavor of this dip was good (after I modified) but I could not taste a single bit of clam flavoring. I think the cream cheese and bacon overpowers the clams and clam juice. I added cayenne pepper and creole seasoning because it was so bland- despite the jalepeno. It was way too thick to dip out of a bowl- I had to spoon it into individual custard dishes for each person along with spreading knives. Disappointing.

This is good. My kid has an allergy to peppers so I swapped out a fresh, seeded, chopped tomato for the cooked peppers, otherwise I followed the recipe. It was a hit and definitely worth making again.

Excellent dip.  More flavor than regular clam dip which I love.  Made exactly as directed except I did use more of the liquid from the second can of clams to give it more of a consistency of dip instead of spread.  A great recipe!  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks Chef John!
