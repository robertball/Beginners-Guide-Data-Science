After reading several of the reviews for this recipe, we decided to forgo the egg white and replace it with 2T of mayo. mixed w/ 1t. lemon juice.  We brused each piece of fish w/ the mixture, followed by the crumb topping.  It was delicious! This was an inexpensive, quick and easy meal to prepare.

THe best cod I've ever eaten.  The only reason why I'm giving it a four star is because I took the suggestion of lemon and mayo instead of egg whites and I think it made a big difference in taste.  I sauteed 3 cloves of garlic in oil then added it to a little mayo and lemon juice until it was thin.  I then brushed that on the fish instead of the egg whites.  It was awesome and super flavorful.

I made a couple changes. I rubbed the fish with fat free mayo rather than the egg white. I also didn't add the oil to the crumb mixture. Instead, I patted the crumbs onto the fish and then sprayed it with my oil spritzer. I baked as directed. It was so good. I've shared the recipe with a few people who also really enjoyed it. Thanks!!!!

I have to agree with what other reviewer's have already said here. Lose the egg white and replace it with a mayo-lemon juice combo ~ I use 2 Tbsp. mayo and 2 tsp. lemon juice(just ehough to leave a hint of lemon with every bite.) Soak the fish fillets in buttermilk for about an hour before preparing to eliminate any "fishy" taste, add a bit more seasoning and this is a delicious, healthy meal, one which the hubs and I have been enjoying for weeks now. Thanks for the post, dakota!

Couldn't see brushing the filets with egg white, but neither could I see swabbing them with mayonnaise as it seems most reviewers chose to do.  I brushed the filets with melted butter and moistened the crumb mixture with it as well.  The idea of the Italian seasoning with the delicate fish didn't appeal to me, so I chose to substitute fresh minced garlic, fresh chopped dill and parsley.  I baked the fish in a shallow pan that I had drizzled with a little melted buttter.  My filets were a little thicker, so I found that 20 minutes at 400 degrees was perfect.  I love fish prepared this way and do so often.  The addition of the corn meal was new for me, however, and I can't say that I even noticed it, so I would call it unnecessary.  Served this with "Broccoli n Tomato Pasta," also from this site, and a tossed green salad.  My idea of a perfect meal.

Very delicious.  My only suggestion is to season the fish itself before adding the breading on top.  I used some lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Please notice that the description clearly states this is a "low-fat" recipe.  Therefore, substituting mayo for the egg white truly changes an important factor here.

Good recipe ~ nothing too fancy - simple and easy to make. I made it with and without the egg white and my family did not notice a difference. This is a meal I'll make again. I did need to tent the fish at the end of the cooking time to prevent excessive browning of the breadcrumbs.

The best fish I have ever tasted! I took the advise of others and used Italian bread crumbs and used mayo instead of egg white, and it came out perfect! Will definitely make again!

I like a lot of flavor, so I used crushed, seasoned croutons instead of bread crumbs.  It really adds dimension and does not compromise texture.  I loved it!

This was okay.  I thought the topping was a little dry.  If I do this again, I'll probably make a light sauce to drizzle on top of it.

This is a tasty and quick dish. I added a bit more Italian seasoning and used fresh garlic. I also used a whole egg. A little less healthy but very tasty.

I make fish fairly often and look for variations.  Read a few reviews for this recipe and eliminated the egg, mixed 2T light mayo with about 1t fresh lemon juice and brushed fish with this mixture.  I lightly sauted two green onions and two minced garlic cloves in about 2T olive oil.  I used this to grease my pan and placed the fish on top - yum!  I did not use garlic powder, salt, or italian seasoning, but used italian panko crumbs.  Everything else the same.  I made creamy mashed potaoes and topped the potatoes with the fish.  Nice presentation and everyone raved over how good it was.

This was great.  I was going to do the mayo/lemo trick per other reviews and decided to stay with the healthy route.  Glad I did, as it was perfect.  I did coat the entire fillet with the crumb mixture instead of topping.  I served over sauteed spinach with garlic and lemon.  YUM!

A very good recipe for crispy oven baked fish.  I substituted Old Bay seasoning for the Italian and added a couple dashes of garlic salt.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and cooked it at 375 for 30 minutes. It came out perfect.

I rated this a 3. I'm just not a big fan of Italian seasonings on fish. I'm really just making a comment for those who found the cooking time off. The rule of thumb for fish is 5 minutes per inch of fish (thickness of the fish, not length). For us, we don't care for raw fish at all, so I start checking for donesness at 15 minutes. I like it done, but still moist. If it's dry, you've overcooked it. A white fish like cod or snapper should be opaque when done. A salmon should have a sheen to it, a moist sheen. I know some people like their fish a bit raw, but it's not a good idea per health department suggestions.

Used sharp cheddar since I was out of Parmesan. Delicious! The kids (12, 10) & hubby loved it! This works well with tilapia, too.

I made this dish for the family this evening.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. I wanted to keep it as fat free as possible so I didn't use the mayo coating.  However, I did change up a few things.  I used an egg substitue and added minced fresh garlic and a little salt & pepper.  Coated the fish filets with the egg mixture then coated with panko breadcrumbs/parmesan/spice mixture.  I added, oregano, thyme, lemon/orange pepper and onion & garlic powder to the panko mixture.  Coated the entire filet and cooked them at 400 on a wire rack/broiler pan for about 30 min.  It came out perfect and everyone loved it.

very good crumb coating for fish, I did soak the fish in buttermilk for an hour and half first though as it does get out the 'fishy' taste (have been doing that on fish for years), one reviewer suggested instead of egg white, mix mayo and lemon juice - well that is what I did and I felt it was a great alternative.  Yummy, moist fish, does take longer to cook depending on your filet sizes.  I added some red pepper flakes to the crumb coating as we like our dishes jazzed up with some heat! Thanks for the recipe, will alter it for salmon (dill in place of Italian seasoning), I am sure it will be fantastic on that :)

After reading the reviews this is what I did:  Sauteed 6 crushed cloves of garlic in canola oil in a cast iron skillet over medium low heat, stirring constantly.  Once the garlic was golden I removed the skillet from the heat and spread the garlic evenly in the skillet.  I mixed 2 tbl of light mayo with fresh lemon juice and put even amounts on 4 pieces of cod fillets.  I placed the fillets on top of the garlic in the cast iron and spread the mayo, then seasoned with fresh ground sea salt and pepper.  Then I topped it with italian seasoned panko crumbs mixed with parmesan cheese.  I sprayed the topping with oil spray.  I baked it at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes.  I had fillets that were pretty thick (frozen section from Costco).  It turned out wonderfully...looked pretty and tasted great!

It was very good - but I think there was just a little too much topping for the fish. Next time I'll use less topping, or else use more olive oil.  I made orzo and a fresh salad to go with it and it was a hit.

You'd be hard-pressed to find a tastier fish recipe.  We've made this twice, once exactly as instructed (five stars!), and once with Panko bread crumbs to make it a touch healthier (4 1/2 stars). ;)  It's already very healthy to begin with, so I may go back to the original way. :)  After reading many of the reviews on here, I'm sure they're all great.  The fantastic thing about this recipe, though, is how healthy it is without sacrificing taste.  When you start adding mayo, salt, etc., it defeats the purpose.  I'd recommend giving it a shot this way first; hey, you can always sprinkle a little table salt on it once it's served. :)  Happy eating!

This was really good and easy. I stuck with the egg white at my daughter's request (doesn't like mayo), and the only thing I changed was to salt the fillets before baking. Ended up so crisp and light. Everyone including the kids asked that I make this one again.

When I first found this recipes, everything sounded great except the corn meal.  I needed a quick and easy cod recipes so I gave this one a shot.  Boy was I surprised at how tasty this was.  Everything blended together and tasted wonderful.  I did brush on low fat mayo to help keep the fish moist and hold the topping on, but that was the only change I made.  Very good-give this one a try.

This recipe was very good, although it makes a lot for the amount of fish called for.  My husband especially liked cod prepared this way, and it has become his favorite way to eat fish.  I prefer to use melted butter rather than the olive oil, and I use more than a teaspoon so that the mixture isn't so dry and browns well.

Many of the reviews suggested mayo and lemon juice as a substitute for the egg white, so I went with that :) sorry, it just sounded better in my opinion. I followed one reviewer's suggestion and used 2 tablespoons mayo, 2 teaspoons lemon juice, and then I added personally a tablespoon of mustard. I put the breading all around the fillets as well. I added to the bead crumb/and cornmeal garlic salt, lemon pepper, and Italian seasoning (like you said). Everything turned out great, husband REALLY liked it :) Thank you for the recipe.

Was very happy with this recipe! Followed recipe almost to a T, but I didn't cut my fish into 3oz pieces - so it took just a bit longer to fully cook.   Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was okay.  It was kind of bland, but we did have a thick piece of fish (cod) and used plain breadcrumbs.  Maybe if we used a seasoned breadcrumb and thinner fish it might be better.

I used mayo with a little lemon juice instead of egg white as suggested by other reviewers - hubby liked it, I didn't.  I'll try this recipe again as originally written with the egg white.

I made a few changes in this recipe and both my husband and I loved it!  About 30 minutes before cooking, I soaked the fish in milk to lighten the taste. I also seasoned the fillets with lemon juice and pepper before putting on the topping.  I left the cornmeal and olive oil out of the topping ingredients.  The fish turned out perfectly--I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Delish and easy to make!  Adding to our (bi)weekly rotation.  It honestly only took 30 minutes to prepare this meal along with 2 side dishes (quinoa and sauteed spinach+mushroom).

Only made 4 minor changes: no cornmeal (because I forgot); halved the measurements for 2 fillets of tilapia; coated both sides of the fish with the breading mixture; baked it on a greased, lined pan instead of a broiling pan (easier cleanup).

And that was it!  The fish was still crispy (top and bottom) even with the modifications.  I'm sure it could have been crispier had I used a broiling pan and cornmeal, but we were happy eaters anyway.  Bon appetit and try this recipe!  :)

I thought it was great!  Used Mexican Parmesan (stronger flavor for those who thought it was bland) and fresh fish (someone said it was soggy, that can happen with frozen fish) Also I crumbled up italian croutons since I didn't have bread crumbs. I would highly recommend it.

We have never been big fans of cod, but  will buy it now.  This was a great way to serve it!  I did saute garlic and add salt and pepper at the beginning.  I did not have cornmeal, so used 2 t. grown flax seed!  I thought it smelled strong of fish, so i baked it in a small amount of whole milk, about 2/3 c. to absorb some of that.  worked great!  I did the mayo and sprayed the oil on at the very last with my Misto sprayer.    It turned out very delicous.  You do want to start with a good quality piece of fish.   I think this is a great way to get kids or non-fish lovers to try it.

Actually I am a big guy who eats big .I have made this dish many times now. It is so easy tastes  good. Take the other peoples recommendation and use Mayo and lemon instead of olive oil it makes a huge difference. Forget the light Mayo--use the good stuff. Time-wise, use the cooking time as a reference, but wait until you see good browning of the bread crumbs. One other thing: crush macadamia nuts into the breading mixture.

Scrumptious!! I've just begun my foray into fish, and started out frying. This was my first attempt baking, and it was sooo successful! Although I too switched-out the egg white for mayo/lemon juice, I give this poster 5stars because they nailed the important stuff -roasting rack, temp & time, brush-on, &all other methods!)Critical 2first-timers 1 observation: I think reviewers complaining about dryness are using the wrong breadcrumbs. Not Progresso Italian style, but PANKO! The poster does say "dry bread crumbs." I find its always best 2go with panko 9 out of 10 times! Happy eating :)

I used the mayo and lemon in place of the egg, but followed rest of recipe.  It was good and I was very pleased that the measurements were right on target. No waste like many others I have tried.  If you are making just 1 lb. of fish you need to increase the ingredients or you won't have enough coating. Thanks dakota.

This recipe may have potential. I used the suggestion of posters to coat with 2 tablespoons mayo and 1 teaspoon lemon juice instead of egg. I added 1 teaspoon refined white sugar to the coating. Always do that when using lemon juice to keep the sourness down.  That turned out to be the main flavor that I got out of eating this, and was the best part.  The topping browned nicely and was starting to burn, but the fish was still raw.  By the time the fish was cooked, the topping was burnt and added crunch to the meal, but very little flavor. Suggest baking the fillets for 5 minutes before sprinkling the topping over them. Another "cure" for this might be to coat the fish, bake it at 350 degrees until done as tested with a fork, and then add the coating and broil until the topping starts to brown, which is does very quickly.

Yum! My husband loved this recipe.  Not only was it simple, but it tasted wonderful!  I also didn't use the egg white but followed the idea of using the sauteed garlic with lemon.. but instead of mayo I used Greek yogurt.  I also don't really like black pepper, so I put in cayenne pepper instead. It added a bit of a kick we really enjoyed!

This is a great recipe.  Made it with rave reviews.  Husband said "Do again".  The only thing I did different was I didn't do the egg white.  Didn't want to waste the egg.  Instead I rubbed the cod with a little olive oil and then put the crumb mixture over the top.  Oh so good!

I give this fish recipe five stars, very healthy and delicious way to make cod.  I used mayo instead of egg white (helps the bread crumbs stick better and better taste) and I soaked the fillets in milk for an hour to get rid of the fishy taste that cod sometimes has (when it’s not right out of the water fresh). I also breaded both sides. I cooked it until the outside was light brown and it came out perfect, moist and flaky.  

For those who like more flavor you can always add you favorite kicker to the fish before breading them, I will try a little dill next time or a little Cajun seasonings to add some variety. The recipe is a most for anyone’s repertoire.

I cooked this the other night and also used mayo in place of the egg, plus I used Kraft's 5-cheese Parmesan blend that comes in the shaker cannister and added about 1/4c. because we like things cheesy around here.  I rinsed the fish before coating and topping so it didn't smell/taste as "fishy" and cooked it on convection like another reviewer suggested.  I have NEVER seen fish disappear at my table as fast as this did!  Typically the only way my family eats fish is off the grill, but my husband told me he'd "let me" make this any time I wanted to!  :)

Very easy and great.  I replaced the egg with 2T of mayo. mixed w/ 1t. lemon juice and I used Italian Breadcrumbs instead of plain and didn't add the Italian seasoning. I brushed each piece of fish w/ the mixture, followed by the crumb topping. It was delicious!

Well, I never knew this before, but cod fillets have tiny bones in them (was it just the ones I bought??), so this turned out not to be such a hit. I would in the future use something else, like basa. Also, I had a tough time with the crumbs sticking to the fish. I found the whole thing a bit dry, but the flavour itself was ok; I'm sure with a bit of experimenting this could be really good, but I'm not sure I'll make it again.

Hey, thank you for this recipie, it was great!  Like others, I ditched the egg for the mayo and it was sensational!  I am not very experienced with sea food although I really like it and wish I could know how to cook all seafood dishes to perfection.  I now have cod down!  Thanks!

Very good basic recipe. I decided against the egg white after reading the reviews recommending mayo and lemon juice. However, found that I was out of mayo, so I used Greek-style yogurt instead with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice -- worked great and even more healthy!

This was very tasty and easy to preprare. I seasoned the cod with Old Bay seasoning, but next time I'll take care not to add so much, as it was a little salty. Other than that, I thought it was absolutely wonderful. I served it with rice pilaf and salad. I felt very healthy!

I wanted something that would be quick and easy to make and boy this is the recipe for that.  I sprayed the fish with pam instead of using the eqq white.  My husband loved it.  Next time will use garlic salt in place of the garlic powder but that is just my personal preference.  Wonderful recipe.

I made some minor changes, more out of necessity than intent.  Left out the cornmeal, used a whole egg instead of a white.  It turned out great, thanks!

Tasty and light.  I sprinkled garlic powder on the fish and brushed on a whole egg like a couple of others.  I also doubled the olive oil because the crumb mixture was a little dry for our taste.  It turned out very tasty sprinkled with lemon juice and served with spinach saute.

Delicious and easy!  I'm trying to find ways that I can actually like fish and this was a great start.  I didn't have cornmeal and I sprinkled a little garlic salt on the fish before putting on the topping.  I will definately make this again!

After trying a newspaper recipe for Cajon Cod with negative results, I was glad I found this one. Great flavor and easy to make. Even tasted good warmed up in the microwave the next day. We plan on serving this to dinner guests.

Very nice recipe - especially when you want to make a healthy meal but don't have much time.  Next time I'll cut the topping recipe in half since it made way more than I could use.

Yum!  Found nice cod on sale and really didn't want to make fish and chips.  This is a terrific and super easy recipe.  Like others, I substituted mayo and lemon juice for the egg but, not docking Dakota for that.  We will make again for sure. Thank you for sharing Dakota!

We love this dish, It had great Italian flavor. The only thing is I doubled the recipe. Paired it with Caprese Couscous Salad (On this sight) with French cut green beans with bacon bits. this was very tasty together. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

My biggest advice on this recipe is to use 3oz fillets.  Mine were much larger and the topping just wasn't enough for the larger fillets.  I did take the advice of others and used 2 Tbsp mayo mixed with 1 tsp lemon juice in place of the egg.  I liked the flavor of the topping well enough.

delicious. I used my low carb bread crumbs, left out the corn meal,  pan fried it almost to completion then spooned a bit of parmesean over the tops, turned off the heat and covered with lid for a bit.  Was faster, yummy and didn't have to heat up the house with the oven.

Excellent - Like other reviews I used italian bread crumbs and insted of an egg I brushed mayo mixed with lemon juice on the fish.  I also soaked the fish in buttermilk for an hour then disgarded the buttermilk before brushing with mayo/lemon juice and coating with crumbs.  Turned out amazing!!!

This is a great recipe. I used Italian style bread crumbs and, since the fresh seafood counter was out of cod, I got flounder. I beat an egg (with yoke), dipped the fillets, and then coated them with the crumb mixture. Delicious!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and dipped the cod in light mayo and lemon juice to make the topping stick. Because of this, I omitted the olive oil in the topping. I baked this on a cookie sheet for 20 minutes at 400. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I was surprised that I didn't care for this dish. Maybe it needed salt, or it could be that I just don't like cod. I can't really put my finger on it, but I normally love fish and when I made this I only took a few bites. My husband liked it (which surprised me), but I honestly don't think I'll make this again.

We liked this--used cod and mayo (not the egg white) and some seasoned bread crumbs. Also didn't have parm cheese so added a tiny bit of feta. All ate it.

Really good.  I followed the recipe except I used Italian bread crumbs so I left out the extra Italian seasoning.  I did the mayo lemon thing and think that's definitely the way to go.  Also, breaded both sides and baked on a rack over a cookie sheet.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!!!!

I made this fish recipe, but instead of using the same breading I used tortilla chips and dill pickle flavored chips, put in food processor used the mayo and lemon and breaded it with my dill tortilla crumbs, delicious and flavorfull you should try it.

Ok, I made a few minor changes to this & it was to die for! First time I have ever made fish this good myself! I used crushed Garlic Flavored Croutons instead of Bread Crumbs, Italian Bread Crumbs instead of Cornmeal, Mayo instead of egg (the kind made with Olive Oil). I also doubled the oil in the dry mixture & added a dollop of Mayo to that too. yumm!

Delicious.  When you buy a great fillet of fish the topping is perfect...no need to mess with mayo.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again!

This was ok, for a weeknight meal, but I wasn't thrilled by it. I will try this again with fresh fish, as I used frozen fillets. I use them from time to time, with good results, so I'm not sure it was the fish. Thanks.

This was excellent!  I also used the mayo instead of egg whites.  I had some leftover spaghetti sauce so I poured a little over the top after it was baked.- YUMMY!

This recipe made the cod taste so buttery and rich!  Great recipe.  I followed the recipe but as per other reviews, I added about 1 tbsp mayo and about 2 tbsp lemon juice to the egg and dipped the fish in it before the bread crumb mixture.  I also omitted the olive oil and used Italian Seasones bread crumbs.  I served the fish with lemon wedges on the side.  I will definately make this again - I wish I had more fish on hand or I would make it again tomorrow.  Thanks!

Very good.  I did the mayo/lemon thing, and the fish turned out tasty.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the fish's texture was mushy, but maybe that was just the fish and has nothing to do with the recipe.

terrific taste and low-fat.  I used Italian seasoning and substitute non-fat yogurt and feta cheese for the egg white and Parmesan cheese.  Very easy and quick to prepare/cook.

I was never a fan of cod fish, but this recipe sounded so good I had to give it one more try. I'm glad I did because it was delicious! Like a lot of people, I omitted the egg and instead brushed the fish with about a tablespoon of lemon.  My family really enjoyed it. Thanks Dakota:)

Loved this!!! I think this may be my hubby's new favorite fish recipe.  He was still complimenting me on it two days after I made it.  Made it as is, I don't rate recipes I change, because then it's not the recipe, lol.

Tasty and easy.I did use the egg white despite the other reviews, I did add a little bit of lemon juice to the white though.I also increased the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp and added a dash of onion powder.I thought it would be better to dip the fish in the egg and then the mix, instead of just brushing it on, it turned out wonderfully will be making again!Thank you for this great recipe

I just made this for dinner, Wow! Of course I did change a few things per the reviews..I can't give the orginal recipe 5 stars (since I didn't follow it exactly) but what I made DEFINETLY WAS!!!  I used 1/4 cup crushed Brownberry Sage & Onion Stuffing, and instead of brushing with egg white, I made a mixture of 2Tbl lowfat mayo and 1tsp lemon juice. Also I drizzled an additonial 2tsp olive oil on top. Sure, it added some additional calories but not enough that I'll lose any sleep over it. Again, WOW!!

This is a keeper.  I soaked the fish in milk for 30 minutes to get rid of the "fishy" smell since I was having picky eaters over for dinner.  I minced toasted walnuts and added them to the mixture and omitted the corn meal.  I also added some fresh herbs that I had growing - oregano, basil, thyme - instead of the dried herbs.  My husband and I love it.  It will be a way I will fix fish again.  Any kind of white fish works well.  I used Talapia and another time I used File fish.  (Or is it Tile?)

How I wish I had had this recipe years ago! What a fast and delicious way to cook cod! I changed things around a tad due to missing some things in the kitchen:  1. I cooked the fillets in a baking dish sprayed with cooking spray rather than a broiler rack. 2. I brushed about 1 T mayonnaise on the fish first then spooned the crumb topping on top. (I found out at the last minute I didn't have a lemon on hand so it was just plain mayo.) 3. I bumped the Parmesan cheese up to 3T and it made the topping super cheesy tasting. So, as you can see, the changes were minimal but the fish still turned out FANTSTIC. I would recommned this recipe to anyone who is starting out cooking fish and is afraid - I would say it is close to foolproof and the outcome is so flavorful!

Hubby and I both love this recipe.  We use tilapia instead of cod and I don't do the egg white as the crumbs stick to the damp fish just fine.  My other changes: double the topping as more is better. I also double the oil as one teaspoon just doesn't seem like enough.  The crumb topping is great with other side dishes like green beans, broccoli, cous cous, rice, etc.  This is one of our monthly staple recipes!

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was it needed a little more flavouring. (I used thick cod pieces)I will double the topping next time:)  I, too, used the lemon mayo mix for the top and that was a great touch(more of that next time too.) Great recipe and my kids went back for seconds!  Yummy!

After reading reviews I decided to forgo the egg whites and rub lemon and mayo on the fish before I spooned the topping on. I forgot the oil in the topping mix which wasn't missed at all in the final product.  This was quick and easy and reduced to a great meal for one!

My whole family enjoyed this lowfat dish. I took some of the previous suggestions and they all worked well. I soaked the fish in milk for half an hour before cooking, added extra Italian seasoning and put in some Cayenne pepper (I think the recipe would have been too bland without it). I used the egg white (not mayo because no one will eat it) and mixed it with some salt and pepper and lemon juice.

Thanks for this nice recipe.  Tried it with Tilapia as Cod was sold out.  Will make it again.  Wasn't a fan of the eggwhite, so next time I will use lemon juice before topping it with the crumb mixture.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it was exactly what I was looking for.  Personally, I prefer a bit more spice, and for myself, would add a little red pepper or Red Hot to the mayo rub in the beginning.   I didn't even try the egg white, based upon the reviews.  Also, I seasoned both sides of the fish with McCormick seafood rub and lightly salted as well.  I used thick cod loins, so it took about 25 min. to cook.  I got rave reviews ... .even the kids loved it!  Thanks.

With modifications, this was truly divine.  I used Japanese panko breadcrumbs and added cayenne pepper to the dry breadcrumb mixture for some "Oomph".  I also spread fat free mayo on the fish instead of egg whites....the bread topping seemed to stick to it better.  12 minutes at 450 was perfect.  The fish was so light, so healthy, and even add a hint of "heat" with the cayenne...something I truly think this mild dish needs.

Wonderful.  I used Italian style bread crumbs and skipped Italian seasoning and used Zatarain's Seasoned Fish Fry (which is basically corn flour) instead of corn meal. I dipped the cod in Asian brand (very finely ground) rice flour before dipping into the egg so the bread crumb mixture would stick to the fish better.

This was good.  I made some slight changes and followed the advice of others on this site.  I subsituted fat-free mayo w/ 1T of lemon juice for the egg white.  I also added some Emerils Essence to the spice mixture and omitted the cornmeal.  I also used Hake, which is a cousin to Cod b/c I had it on hand.  The only thing I would do different next time is roll the fish in the spice rather than top it.  We really enjoyed the flavor.

This turned out very good. I used a piece of mahi and a piece of cod,and liked the mahi more. One of the few recipes I've tried that I didn't tamper with and really liked.

Great easy recipe! I used 1 Tbsp of mayo mixed with 1 tsp of lemon juice as suggested by another reviewer instead of the egg white. Delicious!

I gave this 5 stars because I do not like fish and I could eat fish prepared this way.  I used Hake instead of cod (it was what was on sale!) and I added more breadcrumbs for the cornmeal since I was out.  I also added some onion powder.  I used alot of lemon juice (in place of the egg white).  The lemon juice seemed to cut the fishy taste because the dish was mild tasting.  Definitely will make this again.  My youngest mowed it down and my oldest ate it without too much complaint.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We all enjoyed this tasty flavorful dish. I needed to add more oil to the bread crumb mixture and I also used quite a bit more garlic. The topping goes great with almost any type of fish. We used Tilapia and it was great Verona!

Very yummy and satisfying.  I figured that the topping would need more oil to come together, but I whisked it for a minute or two and it was perfect.  The topping ended up a little crunchy, which I liked.

I really enjoyed this recipe except there was a lot of the topping left over...kind of a waste. Also, I had to increase the bake time a lot since the cod I used was pretty thick. But it was tasty...no leftovers!

This was the best fish recipe I have made yet. This is great, highly reccomended. I added a few shakes of dill over the fish after I put on the egg whites. I made this dish for the family and they loved it. It's our new favorite

I read the reviews and made this three ways last night since I had 6 fillets of wild caught Alaskan cod (36 oz). Have to say our family loved these each way and wants this again. A great recipe. I used the breading recipe (double batch) as is but added a salt substitute equal to the garlic powder.  I used a knife to stab the fillets to let the flavor penetrate, put them on Al foil with release and added a light olive oil spray. No stick plus easy cleanup.  I prepared 4 fillets by rubbing on a very thin layer of mayo . In a separate tray,  I put  a coating of Old Bay on another filet and Red Lobster Seasoning on the last. I drizzled bottled lemon juice to all and then added the bread crumb mixture to all. For the two seasoned fillets, I drizzled on chardonnay  and added some extra to the pan. I baked at 450 but it took 30 minutes to cook (still had very moist fillets). A surprising outcome was that everyone liked the variety. All 3 seasonings had a different taste and each was preferred  by different people, but by slight  margins. The second time I made these, I used 2 seasonings, the mayo and the Old Bay.  This is a great tasting fish recipe.

I made this twice.  The first time I forgot the cheese and added the second time I made it.  I think I like it best without the cheese.  My husband had seconds the first time I made it, but wasn't so impressed the second time.  So I'll continue to make it, but I'll still work with it to incorporate the cheese somehow.

Loved it!  My go to is ritz crackers and butter. I wanted something new.  I did not use the egg white, but sprayed the fish with "pam" olive oil spray.  I ised panko bread crumbs and parmesan romana and then put the topping on and cooked as Directed. Moist and delicious.

Tried it with Tilapia. It was delicious! I did follow the advice of those before me, and I mixed mayo with lemon juice...spread it evenly on each fillet, then put the bread crumb mixture on top of that. Yum! My guests loved it as well ;)

I really don't like to leave bad reviews but we really did not like this recipe. I  wanted to, it was quick and easy to make, and healthy, but it was quite dry and bland even though I also seasoned the fish itself. I just think this needs too many changes to bother making again but if you do I highly suggest taking some of the great ideas for improvement from other reviewers.

Making this review as a note for myself. Add more mayo/ lemon sauce on fish and less bread crumb mixture.

I have tried this topping with other types of fish and it really works best for cod. Cod tends to be moister than many other fish. When I used other types of fish, the topping soaked up any small amount of water from the fish and made it rather dry. The topping does dry out the cod some too, but being so moist it really is quite perfect. We make this at least once every other week. It is a family favorite!

Pretty tasty. I really liked the sharpness of the Parmesan - I bet this would work well on any milder fish.

Good recipe.  I also read reviews and didn't use the egg whites, I brushed the fish with a little butter and also sprinkled a little fish seasoning on with the cracker crumbs.  Would make this again.

This is an excellent recipe- the best fish I've had in years!  I followed other reviewers' advice and did not use egg white to coat the fish.  Instead, I seasoned the fish with a sprinkle of black pepper and a little lemon juice, and then brushed on a mix of 2 TSP mayo and 1 tsp lemon juice on the fish.  I made the breadcrumb mix as directed in the recipe and added it onto the fish after brushing on the mayo and lemon juice mix.  We like extra flaky fish, so I cooked it for 25 minutes at 450 in my gas oven.  My husband can't get enough of it!

This was outstanding!!! I didn't have Cornstarch and figured it was just to help thicken it a little so instead I crushed up about 5 Ritz Crackers and the topping was perfect and oh sooo yummy and flavorful... Oh and I love seasoning... So I actually tossed in some minced garlic, onion powder, freeze dried dill flecks, salt, and pepper, and parsley. Also, all I had was shredded parmesan cheese and that works just fine and I added a little more olive oil to the mix just to get it a little more moist!!!
I also used this lemon butter dill sauce from a McCormick's jar at the store, over the fish then coated the entire area with this topping...
This is my favorite fish topping ever!!!

This cod recipe was quite good. My boyfriend and I both liked it quite a lot for simple, easy, reasonably healthy dinner. I plan to make it again. I think it needs just a little something more to give it some oomph; adding just a tiny squirt of lemon at the table seemed to do the trick. A very serviceable dinner that the whole family can easily enjoy.

if you use the lemon juice and mayo as others suggested this is fabulous! will be making it again and again. I also just used Italian breadcrumbs and a spray of olive oil pam over the top instead of mixing oil into the crumb mixture.

Excellent recipe that is simple to make. I did use the mayo/lemon juice combo instead of the egg white as suggested by others and Italian Panko bread crumbs. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as it was written. I will be making it again! Thanks!!

This was excellent!  I followed another's modification by skipping the egg and adding 2T mayo and 1 t. lemon juice.  I would use 1T mayo with 1-2t. lemon juice.    My family loved this recipe and I will probably make it again.

I just made this recipe last night and thought it was great and easy! (my 10yr old daughter even wanted it again tonight) and I had the leftovers for lunch today! I cooked it a bit longer maybe 10 more minutes being that I had 2 large pieces.    I also used the mayo and lemon juice  and also added a scant 1/2 tsp of salt to the crumb mixture.

This was just excellent! I did do the mayo/lemon juice mixture recommended by others and I didn't have cornmeal, so I left that out. But I love, love, loved this dish. I served it with quinoa polenta seasoned with Italian seasoning and a sprinkle of grated cheeses and asparagus that I roasted in with the fish. Yumm!

Results looked just like the picture (good!).  Taste was relatively bland.  I suggest adding a pinch of cayenne to the dry ingredients and spreading a thin layer of Hellman's or Best Foods (excellent flavor and consistency) mayo or a thin layer of Miracle whip under the dry, finishing with dry.  Or, a thin layer of salsa on the top would intrigue the palate and keep the fish very moist.  Just sprinkle the dry ingredients on top of the salsa.   Enjoy!  ...from a seasoned cook.

Love it!!!  I took other reviewers' advice by substituting the egg white for 1 Tbsp. mayo mixed with 1 tsp. lemon juice- that gave it an incredibly creamy flavor! The bread crumb topping is very flavorful as well. My 3 year olds couldn't get enough.  I will definitely make this again.

Easy to make, came out good.  (I used pollock.)   Just that much better than plain breadcrumbs and butter topping. It took more than 12 minutes to cook through, maybe about 15 and it was perfect.  I did it with the mayo/lemon juice mixture in place of egg white as recommended by many reviewers.

This was awesome, I made this last night so much flavor. I only had 2 pieces of Cod so i skipped the egg and used mayo mixed with roasted garlic. Then i put the bread crumbs and baked. I also seasoned the fish first before i added anything.and added garlic power to breadcrumb mix. Will def make again. Thanks

Cod is my fish of choice and this recipe is excellent. I did opt mayo for the egg white and added some old bay spice as well. It is definately a keeper and I look forward to having this again in a few days!!

This was delicious when I substituted the egg as others said.  Loved the mayo/lemon juice instead of egg white (although I never tried the egg)    I didn't cook on broiler pan because I hate to clean them!  Put it in glass baking dish, sprayed it with nonstick spray and cooked at 400 for about 15 min.  It was great.  Definitely a keeper.

I used this recipe on 2 lbs. of cod filets (changed the recipe to 6 servings) and it turned out great!  I followed the suggestions from others about the mayo/lemon juice mix instead of using an egg white.  I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I will definitely make this again!

I tried this last night and it was great. Not only was it simple, it was quick. I did use the suggestion of seasoning the fish and substituting the egg for mayo...It was delicious!

Very good!! I took the advise of others and used 2T mayo & 2t of lemon juice mixed with some sauted garlic in olive oil. I also soaked the fish in milk to rid of the fishy taste. Used slightly more seasoning and even my 12 year old who hates fish was eating it off of my plate!! Thank you, will be a regular dish in our household.

I made this recipe with tilapia.  It was extremely fast and easy to prepare.  I made this for my boyfriend and he LOVED it.  He said it was the best way he's ever had tilapia.  I omitted the egg and instead mixed 2 tbs mayo w/2 tsp lemon juice.  It was amazing.  I will make again next time we have tilapia.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

This one's definitely a keeper.  Made a couple of changes to use what I had on hand.  Substituted tilapia for the cod, dropped the cornmeal and mixed together panko and parmesan bread crumbs.  Also added a little cayenne pepper and paprika.  Put lemon juice and olive oil on the fish and spooned the dry bread mixture on top.  Came out perfectly cooked with a nice mild flavor.

This was great prepared as written. Don't change a thing! Maybe it has something to do with the quality of your fish. i bought the cod at a fish market and I think it was the sweetest, juciest cod I have ever made.

Like some others I found the crust tasty but the fish really bland.  I even tried the mayo/lemon juice mixture as well and followed the rest of the recipe to the T and it just fell flat for us.  Perhaps using some herbs on the fish before crusting would help?

Also I followed the other reviewers advice on soaking the fish in milk prior to baking and it did take away all of the "fishy" taste!  Because of that I even got my stepson to eat some!

Sorry. I was very let down by this recipe. My guest couldn't help but show her reaction either (not a good reaction). I typically have high expectations, but even at having low expectations, I can't say that this was good. Once I wiped off the breading and douced it with lemon juice and gave it a sprinkle of sea salt, it was better.

I have never made a fish meal from scratch and everybody loved and raved about it!
I changed the recipe;I used fresh garlic and added some fresh rosemary but kept the recipe the same apart from those alterations.Very tasty,I'll be making again and again.

What a great and healthy way to eat fish! I followed the advice of others and used light mayo in place of the eggwhites.  I also used a shallow jelly roll pan sprayed with nonstick spray which made the fish much more tender and prevented the breadcrumbs from burning.

I followed the advice of others and brushed the fish with a bit of mayo instead of the egg white.  I also drizzled a bit of olive oil on the bread crumbs to make it more moist.  Baked in a convection oven and the end result was excellent.  Great family dinner, but you could even serve this for a casual get together.

This was really good! I have never cooked fish before- with the exception of frozen fish sticks, and I was worried it wouldn't turn out. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using a wash of light mayo/lemon juice instead of egg whites (thanks other reviewers!) It was crunchy, moist, and flavourful. I used haddock as it was on sale. My husband has requested this be put on our regular dinner rotation now.

I was generally pleased with this recipe. I was looking for a haddock recipe and read online that cod recipes are usually good for haddock too. This was good, but nothing spectacular.

Really easy to put together, and very tasty!  I don't know if it was me or the recipe, but I baked it for a total of 25 minutes,and it still was a tad bit undercooked.  I also skipped the egg whites,and used 2Tbsp of Mayo + 1tsp of Lemon Juice as someone else suggested. If I had to do it again, I would have also added a bit of salt.  Great recipe though. I would definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing!

I had to make some slight modifications as I didn't have cornmeal or parmesean cheese.  Instead I substituted 1T crumbled feta, 1/4 c mozarella, and 1T balsamic vinegar.  I served it over rice, and made a lemon butter sauce to drizzle on top.  It was delicious, and I would definately make it again, as it was easy and fast!!!!

Easy dinner on a worknight. I sub'ed mayo instead of the egg as well. The cornmeal made it slightly gritty, so I would probably just stick with bread crumbs in the future.

Similar to others here, I used a thin layer of mayo instead of egg whites.  I also added a dash of Canjun seasoning to the breading.  Very tasty and I will absolutely make this again!

My husband and I loved this dish, my son ate some.  We did some alterations by mixing about 1 T of mayo with some fresh squeezed lemon and brushed that on the fish instead of egg white.  I also added a bit of cayenne pepper and some salt to the fish.  Very tasty, not fishy and good flavor

This gets 5 stars for ease and taste.  I brushed the fish with a small amount of mayo instead of the egg white and piled on the crumb topping.  SO flavorful! Wonderful, easy, mild fish - no fishy taste at all - both kids and husband raved about it.

My husband and I really loved this recipe, he was skeptical of the cod being "too fishy," which is why we tend to stay away from cooking fish at home. I did modify some of the recipe, I used seasoned bread crumbs and doubled the garlic powder. I also used bigger cod filets, just baked them longer. Fish was very tender and delicious! We will be making this again.

Delicious and so easy.  The only thing I changed was the egg white.  I used lemon juice instead to give it more flavor.  I also used butter instead of olive oil.  I suppose it's not as good for you, but does add even more flavor.

I have two kids, ages 8 and 5.  They and my husband ate every scrap of the fish and said they would most definitely eat it again.  I took the advice of some reviewers and used the low-fat mayonaise.  The fish had great flavor (not fishy at all) and was very moist!

This was AWESOME! I did exactly what the recipes says BUT I baked it in a 9x12 pan and lined it with aluminum foil, sprayed with PAM.  I was done it three seconds.

I thought this was easy and tasty. I used mayo on top instead of egg white and thought it added a nice flavor and moistness.  I didn't have "italian seasoning", so I combined small amounts of dried marjoram, basil, rosemary, oregano, and thyme. I think I would've enjoyed it more if I wasn't so skeptical about grocery store fish (especially when it's on sale). Scary.  Besides that, a recipe to try for sure!

We are not big fish easters at our house but we are trying to eat more healthy. This was a delicious recipe.....simple with lots of flavor.  I think I would add touch of lemon juice next time.

This was good with a few adjustments.  I added a little more oil and put salt and pepper along with a little italian seasoning on both sides. I brushed the fish with mayonnaise instead of egg.

As suggested by another reviewer, replaced  egg  white with a mixture of 2T of mayo and 1t of lemon juice. Brushed each piece of fish with the mayo/lemon juice mixture. Spoon on the crumb topping on each piece of fish. Then using a Misto, spritz each piece of fish with olive oil.  Delish, moist quick and easy.

Excellent! 
1. made it with mayo and lemon juice instead of egg whites. (Also sauteed some fresh garlic and added that to the mayo).
2. didn't have corn meal so used 1 tbsp of almond flour. 
3.  I had thick fillets so after 15 minutes at 450 i cooked for another 15 min at 400. 
4. I added cayyene pepper and hot pepper flakes to the crumb mixture and placed some underneath each filet. 

Felt like a fancy meal. I sauteed some green beans and spinach and added alfredo sauce on the side. Thumbs Up!

I won't make it again. It was just okay and there are other good cod recipes out there to try. The bread crumb topping didn't have a lot of flavor and cod is such a mild fish it really needed more. Maybe with more parmesan and Italian seasoning it might be better, but I can't bother to try. Like I said there are so many other great recipes to try.

Delicious and easy!  I also took a reviewer's advice, but instead of brushing w/plain mayo, I brushed it with *wasabi* mayo from Trader Joe's.    I also used Italian style bread crumbs and just added a little pepper & garlic powder. I also plucked a few basil leaves from my plant and laid them on top of the mayo, before the crumb mixture. I cooked my 1 lb. fillet for 15 minutes and served it with salad and butternut squash cubes sauteed in butter. YUM!  Thank you for the recipe and reviewer suggestions!

Yes,  I  would make this recipe again.  
This time, which was my first time making the recipe there were a couple issues  that  happened .  I followed the recipe cooking time to perfection. Yeah my fish was  way too dry.
 I didn’t realize that I have a confection oven until the fish was done.. The recipe you did not give me any other cooking time except  The time figured for me regular oven.
If you have a convection oven, 10 minutes is way too long for cod fillets. Maybe eight, or even seven  minutes  would be a better Cooking time when using a convection. It should be noted. I unfortunately fortunately followed the recipe cooking mine a full 10 minutes 10, thus they  turned out very dry.

This recipe was beyond delicious , fast and fun to make. I hadn't prepared fish in a long while and wanted something fast. I used this recipe making only a couple of small changes. I used mazto meal instead of bread crumbs and sole instead of cod.  Yummy! Even my 10 year old twins devoured it!  Will absolutely use again!

Delicious! My family loved this! I also followed the review of others and skipped the egg white and used mayo with a tablespoon or so of lemon juice. Kept the fish moist, helped the topping stick to it and added great flavor.

Love this recipe! The topping adds a nice added crunch. So flavorful! I would recommend seasoning the fish before adding the topping since there is no salt in the topping. I just used salt and pepper and it added flavor. First time I made I used a broiling pan and second time I cover a baking sheet with foil. I loved the foiled pan better. Super easy clean up! Served with lemon wedges.

I'm rating this as 3 stars, but I'm not sure I'd make this again. I made the cod as the recipe stated, and while it's a low weight watcher point meal (3 smart points), and low calories, it was also very bland.

So easy and so good!  I didn't have eggs so I mixed the dry stuff  (doubled) with about a tablespoon of mayo and teaspoon milk, topped the fish fillets and put them on a pam sprayed baking pan.  12 minutes later served with salad.

Very plain.
But I will try again because it was a nice crust.
Perhaps double the pepper & Italian seasoning.
I served with lemon slices to flavour and that was helpful to enhance the fish.

I thought this was a very good recipe.  I would agree with with another reviewer, to season the filets before the crumb mixture.  I think I would prefer butter instead of olive oil but I do understand it was a healthy recipe.  So I left the olive oil.  Everyone in my family really liked this recipe.

To keep the fish from drying out, I added 1/2 cup of broth to the pan. This allowed the topping to be crispy while  the fish stayed moist. It was delicious. My kids liked it and they usually won't  eat fish. My daughter likes lemon, so I squeezed some onto her portion at the end.

The flavors were good but we did not enjoy the Cod.  it was also quite a bit messy and the topping really didn't stick well to the fish. if i were to ever try again it would be on tilapia instead but it's also a lot like another recipe that i just love and is WAY easier to do.

I liked how easy the prep is for this recipe. I mixed all dry ingredients except the cornmeal and the oil and set aside. I used the oil on the baking rack. I did brush with the egg whites, then sprinkled on the dry mix. We liked this a lot. Will make again. Thank you for sharing.

I made the cod without any change,but it lacked taste,and flavor.  I've used much better recipes for cod than this.

The changes were minor... I used half the fish and the full amount of crumbs, also used half whole wheat panko crumbs and the other half original bread crumbs. Instead of black pepper I used lemon pepper.  The fish was excellent flaked beautifully and was very moist.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this recipe exactly as written.

The breading is a little dry/powdery, but flavorful! It's a nice break from the lemon flavors that seem to permeate so many other cod recipes. Very quick and easy to pull together.

Even my super picky 3 year old enjoyed it.

Not my family's favorite cod recipe, but it's one we'd absolutely have again.

Great cod, and healthy! Did the mayo and lemon juice and turned out fabulous! If you use oregano for the Italian spice the dry mixture smells like Pizza Hut breadsticks!

Cod is always an easy fish to work with. I would've added mayo if I would've read the reviews it was a little dry with just the egg white and the Italian seasoning!!! I used a recipe for the macaroni and cheese that was on all recipes also very good

This recipe needs salt and seasoned breadcrumbs. I think it also needs the topping to be damp so it sticks. I think mixing the egg or lemon mayo in with the topping to make a kind of slurry to top the fish would alleviate the dryness problems that the oil alone can't quite manage. Garlic mayo would also be tasty. I can't recommend to follow this recipe exactly as written, but relatively minor technical adjustments will make it better.

I made this as the recipe said. It was good but could be better. The crumb topping was very dry. Next time I will try the lo fat mayo/lemon juice instead of the egg white and probably leave out the corn meal.

I have now made this twice and it has become one of my favs. When making the bread crumb mixture feel free to be liberal with the parm cheese (or other seasonings for that matter). This is super easy and dresses up a basic fish nicely.

This was pretty good, and really the only reason I took off a star was because I used light mayo/lemon juice instead of the egg white (I was out of eggs!) I forgot to mix the oil with the bread crumbs, so I kinda sprinkled it on top. Next time I'll try mixing it and see if it holds together better. I also seasoned the fish with Old Bay and a dash of salt before putting everything on it. :)

I liked this recipe, my husband wasn't as big of a fan, but he generally doesn't like fish.  Anyways, followed the modifications of others, using mayo and lemon instead of the egg wash.  Turned out really good.  Will definitely be making again.

Awesome recipe. I used the mayo /lemon combo instead of the egg, also used Ritz crackers instead of bread cumbs and cornmeal.  I didn't have Italian seasoning but use oregano and basil. This dish is a keeper. It is very similar to a fish topping we had at the Boston Fsh House in New Smyrna Beach Florida. Ths will happen again with other white fishes like Halibut.

I definitely benefitted from the previous reviewers' comments.  Since I was cooking for two, I made following changes.  First, I did not need to waste most of an egg, so I opted to go the mayo route.  I also opted to avoid commercial mayo and made my own, using a pastured chicken egg, light olive oil and lemon juice from a lemon off my backyard tree.

I rolled my cod pieces in the mayo, then rolled them in the topping, however I subbed in crushed rice crackers since this is a wheat free household.  

I served them with a drizzle of aoli built from my mayo plus some garlic and extra lemon juice.  

Was fantabulous!

A very quick, easy way to prepare cod. I gave it 4 stars as I altered the recipe with suggestions of previous reviewers.  I, too, used mayo (with added lemon juice) to coat the fish before putting adding the crumb topping. Also, I had no regular bread crumbs on hand, but used pancko crumbs instead and added used 3 tablespoons of corn meal compensate for the larger crumbs. This recipe would work nicely with other mild fishes and I may even try it on thinly pounded chicken breasts.

This is really good and really easy. I followed other reviewer's suggestions to use fat free mayo instead of olive oil and eggwhite, and used Italian breadcrumbs instead of the breadcrumb/cornmeal combo. I added a little smoked paprika and salt too. I used frozen hake from Costco, baked at 350 for awhile, then broiled to make the outside nice and crispy.

I too used the mayo instead of the egg whites. Family loved it and it was so simple. Great weekday meal.

Absolutely delicious! As recommended, I used the mayo and lemon in place of the egg white. Tons of flavor...this is a definite keeper!

Thanks for the recipe! I also omitted the egg and just squeezed lemon juice over the top of the cod before breading. Also, I did not have cornmeal or bread crumbs but I just pounded croutons until they were fine. I baked it at 375 for 35 minutes.

This was really good.  I did notuse the egg whites.  I simply used mayo on the fish and coated.  Other than that, everything else was the same.  My 10 year old son had seconds!  This is definitely something I will fix again.  It is nice to hve a healthier dish!  I may try this with perch.

This definitely met my need for fish and chips. Even thought it's not the same it still tasted really good and is better than being fried. I did not use cornmeal and used egg substitue instead of the egg white since I had some in the fridge. I took others suggestions and baked on a wire rack in a cookie sheet so it would not be soggy on the bottom. Broiled a little extra time for crispness.

This was pretty good, I mixed mayo and olive oil with lemon pepper and garlic powder and spread that on the fish, then I added the bread crumbs and topped with grated parmesean. I didn't use the cornmeal because I had none. Although I sprayed my broiler pan with cooking spray I stillhad a problem with them sticking, so next time I will try buttering a baking dish and cooking it in that. Nice and easy dinner!

Very yummy! After reading the reviews I made this with mayonnaise instead of eggs. Loved it! I didn't have any cod on hand, so I used white perch. I definitely recommend this.

Quick and easy. Used panko instead of bread crumbs and it worked well. Mayo and lemon juice the way to go.  Next time we will also add some lemon pepper seasoning.

The recipe works and it is not bad, but we found it pretty bland.  We prepared it as directed, with no modifications and felt the crumb topping could have been much more flavorful.

I followed other reviewer's advise regarding changes. It turned out very good. Even my picky eater ate it without a single complaint, but my husband thought that it was just o.k. I replaced egg white with garlic olive oil and used italian bread crumbs. It's the first time I cooked cod.

Good!  Used the egg whites, but added lemon juice and used shallots in the breading mixture.  Instead of cornmeal I crushed some tortilla chips and it worked just fine!

Used the lemon juice/light mayo to hold the crumbs on that other reviewers recommended. This was very good!
*Update*: Made this again tonight, but left out the parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning- I put some of Emeril's Essence cajun seasoning in the breadcrumbs and a couple grinds of black pepper in the light mayo/lemon juice mixture. Husband and 18-month-old son loved it! Served with Zatarain's red beans and rice and steamed cauliflower/broccoli w/garlic- so easy and fast!

i did it!  i read review after review and decided even though i didn't have cornmeal on hand, that i would try this recipe.  i have tried a million fish recipes and finally found one that is delicious.  like others, i omitted the egg white and used the mayo with lemon.  i substituted the spice combo for some  citrus seasoning blend that i bought at sam's club.  i have saved this to my recipe box and will make it again and again.  thanks.

This was okay.  The breading was kind of soft, not at all crispy.  The flavor didn't really make a great impression.  Not sure I will make this again.  Maybe if I broiled it a bit at the end to brown the top more it would be better but the seasonings need some work too.

This was very good, though I didn't follow it exactly. I used seasoned panko crumbs, and fresh bread crumbs as well. I didn't have cornmeal on hand, and didn't use the egg, or mayo.. just coated it with a little flour and piled the crumbs on top. Once out of the oven, I drizzled lemon juice on the top.

made this with the mayo and lemon juice instead and it came out great!! I also used real freshly minced garlic, one large clove. Then I sprayed it with Pam Spray, butter flavor. Came out great. I didn't give it a full 5 stars since I used other's suggestions instead of the original.

OK, I just made this winging it...brushed mayo on the fish, and dredged it in Italian bread crumbs mixed with some parmesan and garlic salt.  Filets were thick so it took 30 min at 410...Excellent!

Very good and so easy to make. I can't eat wheat so I ground oatmeal to replace it.  I also popped the cod into my toaster oven (on broil) instead of using the big oven.  It was delicious.

This recipe was definitely a disappointment. The cooking time isn't correct, and after checking every 5 minutes after the supposed cook time the oven couldn't do its job. It was a little tough/dry, and the Italian seasoning couldn't do anything to hide it.

My family liked this recipe quite a bit. Like other reviewers, I passed on the egg white and used a very thin brushing of mayo on the cod before adding the crumb topping. Instead of packaged bread crumbs, I made fresh ones from whole wheat bread. I also substituted fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder and dried oregano and basil for the italian seasoning blend. A lovely, quick main course that I served with a variety of steamed vegetables and wild rice.

I think the crumb topping is just too much.  I ended up scraping mine off and eating the fish plain.  Just not my taste...

This was so good!  We used fresh Tilapia and breaded all sides in the bread crumb mixture.  This is now my favorite way to eat Tilapia!

this was very yummy...but I had to make a few changes.  I used 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon of Italian breadcrumbs. I didn't have cornmeal.  It was a great substitute.  Only problem I had was the bake time, it should be 20 minutes or until flaky.  Our 5 and 1 1/2 year old enjoyed this one.  Definitely use this one again.

I thought this was easy and delicious. I work nights, so my dinners have to be made ahead and microwaved. Usually, this doesn't produce great results, but this fish was still really good. I think I added extra corn meal.

This was okay, but I have made a similar recipe using Tilapia and a parm/crumb topping that turned out much much better.  I will still to baking cod w/butter from now on.

This was good, but not great. The cooking time was too short, and if you extend it the topping burns at 450, so I'd say 375 for 35 min is better. It was a bit dry, but ok otherwise.

This was easy and tasty.  I also omitted the egg white and instead spritzed the cod with Pam, used panko bread crumbs, and didn't use the Italian seasoning but used 'season all'.  Everyone liked it, even my picky 6 year old!  My kids all said it smelled like fish sticks but tasted way yummier - thanks!

OK, so I made a few changes. I used tartar sauce with lemon juice to coat the fish instad of the mayonaisse everyone else was using. (I highly recommend this for tartar sauce fans!) I also omitted the Italian seasoning and sauteed it in canola oil in an iron skillet. The topping went all over the place, but the taste was out of this world!

I liked the recipe and also substituted mayo for the egg white.  Fish was cooked perfectly but we didn't like the flavor of the topping.  My whole family agreed the Italian seasoning was too strong.  I'll make it again but without any Italian seasoning.

We were so disappointed. The fish wasn't flavorful enough for us. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes, but a can of italian diced tomatoes saved the day. Then with a little homemade lemon butter it was very good.

Cooking low carb, I substituted crushed pork rinds for the breadcrumbs, left all the seasonings the same, and brushed a little mayo and lemon juice in place of the egg, and it was GREAT!  Very moist inside, yet crispy on the outside.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone, low carb or not!

This was very quick and easy and tasted pretty good.  I thought it was a bit bland though - I would consider squeezing some lemon juice on at the end maybe and increase the herbs in the topping.

This was a great alternative to my usual baked fish.  Used mayo instead of egg white.  I think I would season the fish a bit first next time.  I want to try on halibut next!

Great recipe!  I used catfish rather than cod and it was wonderful.  I guess any whitefish that you like would be just as good.

Eh, just so-so.  We opted for the mayo/lemon juice spread instead of brushing with egg white.  My crumb topping was not crisp, but kinda mushy.  I had to force it down (picky and pregnant), but my hubby said it was okay.  Most likely won't make again.

Mine turned out ok, follwed the recipe but used Tilapia instead since cod was $9.99 a pound when I went to the store. I think it just needed a little something else, will make again but add more spice and salt.

When I made this, I used store bought Italian bread crumbs instead of the plain bread crumbs, Italian seasoning and cornmeal.  Also, I squeezed fresh lemon juice on the cod before coating it with the egg.  It had good flavor.  I will make this again.

I assume you are using fresh cod. What if the cod is frozen?  Does it need to be thawed before cooking - or just cooked a few minutes longer? Thanks!

The topping was great, but the fish was awful (I attribute it to the frozen cod - don't ever buy frozen fish, ever).
I modified it a bit: I used the mayo and lemon instead of egg per other suggestions. Also, I added a couple of dashes of onion powder, a whole teaspon of the italian season, and a couple of dashes of allepo pepper.  I also used romano cheese instead of parmesean. It was great other than the fish. I will definetly try this recipe again with FRESH, non-frozen fish.

Mayo and lemon were great suggestions. I also added garlic salt, onion powder, a little of Mozzarella and Cheddar cheese instead of the Parmesan, and a tiny bit of chili pepper power. Outstanding!

This was very good. As others suggested I used light mayo instead of egg white and sprinkle a little lemon juice over the fish before adding the topping. I think this would be good with most types of fish. I used orange roughy since it was on sale. The fish was nice and flaky and didn't dry out at all.

This was really good.  I marinated the fish with Tomato Poblano dressing and Chile Lime Hot Sauce.  This eliminated the need for egg whites (or mayo).  I made my own bread crumbs by putting some garlic-flavored bagel chips in the food processor.  This one definitely goes in the keep pile!

This is a great recipe for a quick, healthy dinner. Took suggestions from many others...I left out the cornmeal and used parmesan bread crumbs, substituted mayo mixed with lemon juice for the egg and added some salt and cajun seasoning to the bread crumb mix. Turned out great - served with steamed broccoli and my husband loved it!!

This is a wonderful, simple way to prepare fish any night of the week.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used (light) mayonnaise in place of the egg.  I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and left out the additional herbs/spices.  Really tasty!

This is a good recipe in which takes out the gamey fish taste.  The only thing I think I could have done different is also add some Italian diced tomatos on the top at the end of baking.  The family that hates fish loved it though.

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a little mayo and lemon juice to the fish before adding the bread crumb mixture.  Whole family thought this was bland.  It wasn't awful but definitely not that good.  Maybe it was my tweaking however, I will not make again.  Sorry.

Delicious, I served it with Ratatouille which complimented the fish really well.

This wasn't very good at all.  The bread crumbs had no flavor, except raw bread crumb flavor...I ended up putting this under the broiler after cooking it for 15 minutes to brown the bread crumbs, but they still tasted awful.  I won't make this again.

This worked out very well.  We made a few minor changes based on previous reviews - used some garlic salt, substituted wine for the egg white.  We also used corning ware over a broiling pan.  This allowed us to drizzle some extra wine around the fish about 1/2 way through baking.  Also increased baking time to 25 minutes based on using 1 0.75 fillet instead of 4 small fillets.  

Easy, heathly, and cheap.

This was quick and easy!  The only part that keeps it from being a 5 star are the ingredients that keeps it from being as "low fat" as it could be.  Perhaps that is being to picky because the taste would not be as great with out alittle additives.

Very good flavor but it was a little gritty.  I'm domestically challenged and this was the first time I ever cooked fish so it could have been something I did.  As suggested by other members, I used 1 tablespoon oil, italian bread crumbs, and 1/4 tspn garlic salt.

I made this recipe with a few changes in order stay within Michael Thurmond's rules: New orlean's seasoned fish fry breading mix subbing for bread crumbs and cornmeal (so tasty!),and i brushed white wine over the cod before spooning the crumb mixture instead of egg. This is a very delicious recipe and i may use it again tomorrow night!

I'm not a fan of fish at all but I try to have it every now and again as it's healthy. Not surprisingly, I really didn't like this. The crumbing was really bland, and the fish was over-whelming. Husband didn't think it was up to much either. I won't be making this again. Sorry.

I made this recipe tonight and I thought it was good. I thought it lacked a little in flavor, but was not bad. I followed the advice of other reviews and opted not to use the egg, but some mayo instead to make it more moist. It was moist, but I just felt like it was lacking something. I will definately make it again, I will just play around with the topping to see if I can't jazz it up a little.

We ran out of parmesan cheese in the middle of preparing dinner, and I only had 1T, so I'm making a leap of faith that this actually IS a four star recipe (rather than the 3).  If I make this recipe again, I may add a little stock or wine to the pan, just to keep things moist.

I try use fish 1x a week since it is healthy and I didnt follow exact directions...so maybe that is why I felt this recipe was just nothing great.  I dredged it in the topping rather than just placing it on as a topping.  I would rather use a beer batter or my recipe for crab stuffed haddock/cod (see online) jellyko

We are not big fish eaters, but the whole family loved this, including my 17 month old. I also used the suggestion of spreading a light layer of light mayo on the fish before putting on the breading.

I used 1.5 lbs of cod and doubled the topping--but it was WAY too much topping! The fish was tasty though and my family enjoyed this for something different. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was just okay.  My husband and 8-year-old don't like fish anyway, and my five-year-old and I, who love fish, just thougt it was okay.  One thing that really improved it was that I grilled zucchini and yellow squash with garlic and tomatoes to go with it.  Eating the fish with the tomatoes made the flavor much better.  Maybe if I made it again with some sort of chunky tomato sauce to pour over it it would be good.

This recipe is really good.  My children are good fish eaters, but rarely do they request a certain dish.  They've asked me to make this again!  The flavors are light and delicate; if you like strong flavors, you might want to spice it up a bit.  We enjoy it just the way it is.
