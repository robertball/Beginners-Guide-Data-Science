This recipe has great potential.  I would add some onions and maybe a few leftover or frozen vegetables for a bit more flavor.  I had a small bowl of leftover Fettuccine that had been dressed with garlic olive oil, that and 2 eggs in a 6" skillet was perfect for one serving.  I made this for a quick lunch and served it with a small green salad.

This is a good meal, but an even better base for a better meal. Just throw in extra ingredients to make it what you'd like, like making an omelet. I added ground sausage and additional spices.

Last night my boyfriend and I wanted to get rid of the rest of what was left of our pasta, so we through in some garlic, onion, yam, and a tiny bit of pepperoncini... we also used whatever spices we thought fit well. This morning I found this recipe and added the egg, seasonings, some deli meats (Genoa salami and turkey) and a layer of shredded mild cheddar on top. So delicious!!! A great base recipe you can have fun with. Just dont burn your hand like I did when I took it out of the oven :)

This was a great recipe! Really easy to make in a short amount of time. Even my son loves it and he is a very picky two year old! Something that I will definitely make again. I added dried parsley and red pepper flakes for taste.

I just have a major appreciation for pasta, and eggs.   Economic, nutrient rich, and can be prepared in a multitude of creative ways. (i.e. various cheeses, vegetables, lean meats, starches etc.)
