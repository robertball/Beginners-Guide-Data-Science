This is a very tasty marinade. I marinated boneless skinless chicken breasts for several hours and they were very tender and delicious. The only change I made was to use fresh herbs from my garden instead of dried, making this a true Summer Italian marinade! I used the remainder of a bottle of cooking wine for this recipe, but will be using a dry white wine in the future. Thanks for this recipe. I will definitely make this again and again!

4.5 stars. 1/2 star off due to cooking wine ingredient. Better to use an inexpensive dry white wine you'd actually drink. Also, instead of basil I chose rosemary. Upped garlic to 1 tblsp & used 1 green onion. I would use fresh herbs when available but the dry worked also. I cut recipe in 1/2 using 1 C wine with 1/4C lemon juice and 2 tblsp olive oil but kept herbs at original recipe quantities (I didn't bother adding whole peppercorns). I only needed enough for 2 chicken breasts. The extra (unused) I marinaded a smaller cut sirloin steak in. Both times I did overnight marinading and find the flavor profile versitile for different meats. Well, I liked it plenty with my few minor adjustments. Tasty without being overbearing. Of course you can adjust flavors to you liking - Thanks for the post!

I used fresh herbs and marinated 3 boneless/skinless breasts for about 8 hours (20 serving as written made about half a ziploc gallon bag's worth of liquid); pan fried about 3 mins then baked about 10. Nothing to write home about, kind of oily and not enough Zing. I honestly enjoy just a bottle of zesty italian dressing for marinade to this, but I am glad I tried it, and thank you for posting it! It would probably be great for picky eaters as it is somewhat bland.

Delicious!  I used some leftover White Zin and marinated boneless breasts for about 8 hours, then cooked them on the Forman Grill.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for posting it!

Made this tonight for a couple of boneless skinless chicken breasts. I halved the recipe and it made too much for just 2 breasts, so I marinated a pound of sliced mushrooms in part of it. I baked the chicken and sauteed the mushrooms over a pretty high heat. My husband and I liked the chicken, but ironically the mushrooms tasted better than the chicken! Next time, I'll at least double the garlic and the onion. I think those two will give it a much more rounded and deep flavor.

i think i must have the ratios off because i tried to use this on shrimp but it came out way too sour and we love sour!  i used pinot grigio instead of cooking wine.. i also added the zest of the lemon i used for the juice.. so maybe that's the reason? i left out the whole black peppercorns but still felt this was overwhelmingly peppery and we're huge fans of pepper! i'm not sure what i did wrong since everyone else seemed to love this

I loved it!  The chicken was very moist and tasty.  Reminds me of a restaurant we use to go to many years ago.

This was a great recipe. It allowed for a lot of modification and still had a terrific end result.  I gave it four stars only because the recipe recommends cooking wine. Even a very inexpensive wine is better than cooking wine. If you are worried about waste because you don't drink wine consider this,  you are using more than half of the bottle in this recipe. 
This was a last minute, Sunday night scramble for me.  I didn't have any fresh herbs so I used all dried.  I don't care for basil and thyme together so I switched the basil for rosemary. I did have fresh garlic and lemons. I only had two hours for the chicken to marinade  so I pounded them 3/4 inch thick.  I really had my doubts (because of all my changes, not the recipe) but it was terrific.  I can't wait to try it again with fresh herbs with a nice long marinade!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!
