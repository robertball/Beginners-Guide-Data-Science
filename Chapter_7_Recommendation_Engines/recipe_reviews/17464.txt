Really fussy to make but taste wonderful.  I used flour tortillas and the coating of them in enchillada sauce is far more complicated in the recipe then it need be.  But both hubby and I really liked these and I will make them again and again. Thanks!

I just posted my review...just wanted to add that I also took the advice to use flour tortillas which is really the best way to do things...  No oil, no mess..no fuss...

I didn't drag my tortillas thru the oil or the sauce.  I rolled mine and then brushed the sauce over all the rollups then I poured the remaining sauce over them.  I also only used one can which was more than enough.  These were really good and I think next time I'll add chicken or shrimp just for variety.

This is very tasty.  I added ground hot turkey sausage for a little more flavor.  I also used both red and green sauces, it's hard to say which is better...try both!

The Enchiladas where terrific. They took a little bit of work but most good food does. I doubled the recipe and was able to do the cooking and filling in about an hour and a half. While the work was nice and messy the crowd loved the recipe. I even added imitation 'ground beef'. It was Great.  If I keep getting compliments this great on my cooking I'm gonna open a restraunt:)

I wasn't sure if I would like these or not.  I love Mexican food, but you don't normally see spinach, mushrooms and carrots in a Mexican recipe.  These turned out to be delicious, and they were great the next day!  I used flour tortillas and skipped the oil process to cut down on fat.  I also used frozen spinach and low fat cheese and they were still great.

I absolutely loved these enchiladas.  My husband expressed concern about putting carrots in enchiladas but we both loved the result.  I added extra cheese and sauce and it was perfect.  I only wish I had doubled the recipe to fill all my tortillas, as the yeild was much smaller than specified.

Messy, messy messy, when prepared as directed, but worth it.  I used flour tortillas.  For me the filling was only enough to fill up about 8 of them.  Next time I might add some cilantro or red pepper to the enchilada sauce, it was pretty mild.

The family loved these. I used flour tortillas and only one 14 oz can of enchilada sauce, which was the perfect amount.

These taste just like the restaurant enchiladas we love!  However, I used 8 flour tortillas instead of 12 corn ones.  This solves the "torn tortillas" problem - flour tortillas do not tear, and restaurants in Texas, where we live, always use flour tortillas for spinach enchiladas - they just go better with spinach & mushrooms.  Dip the flour tortillas briefly in enchilada sauce - no need to dip into hot oil, so the dish is also lower in fat.  A great recipe! (but try the flour tortillas!!)

These could be great, but they are dying for spice!!  Will try again & add some cumin, chile powder, & cayenne.  We went through a half bottle of Tabasco trying to spice them up a bit.   They were, however, much tastier the next day. I used corn tortillas and layered everything in 9x11 casserole dish.

This was an excellent recipe.  The flavor is outstanding.  I omitted the step of dipping the tortillas in oil and they turned out wonderful.

This recipe was GREAT!  My husband and guests all loved this dish!  I can't wait to make them again.  I think next time, though, I will grate the carrots instead of chop.  Also, I did not soften the tortillas in oil, but covered them with foil and put them in the oven for about 10-15 min.  Works great!  Thanks!

These enchiladas are a great way to get kids to eat--and enjoy--a vegetarian meal.  My son loves these, as do my husband and me.  One note of caution: be careful what enchilada sauce you use.  There is a lot of variation among the different brands, and while some are good others are pretty bad, and can affect the ultimate quality of this dish.

Great!  Wonderful!  Tastes very good.  My husband, who doesn't like mushrooms even said it was better than the cheese enchiladas I usually make.

This was delicous.  I used flour tortillas and ommited pasing them through the oil. My boyfriend loved it.  I did add a little bit more cheese than it called for.  Excellent recipe.

Time saving tips: Shredded carrot vs chopped, sprayed 4 flour tortillas front and back with cooking spray, warmed in microwave 30 seconds to make pliant for filling.  Poured sauce over the rolled enchiladas and omitted it from center. In this case (for Christmas Eve) added chanterelles.  A good base recipe from which to diverge.

I thought these were a bit bland.  Maybe a spicier cheese, with some cumin, cilantro or chili powder?

Flour tortillas, no oil dip, CHOPPED Carrots, and add some spice (your choice..  Mine is jalepenos).  I'd say this dish could go head-to-head with any meat dish, and I rarely eat meatless main entrees!

This was a great recipe, time consuming but well worth it!  My husband loved it!  I had a bit of trouble with the tortillas tearing as I dipped them, but that will probably improve with technique.  I added lots more cheese and onion! Delicious!!!

This recipe went over very well, despite being a little messy to make.  We had fun with the chaos, though!  I highly recommend.

These are fantastic! I've made them twice in the past few days, and will definatly make them again. Even my picky husband said they were good and had seconds. Outstanding!

I enjoyed this receipe and liked the tip about the corn tortillas in oil.  It made them soft enough to roll up.  I would use a little more cheese on the inside of the enchilada.  I just like lots of cheese.

Very yummy recipe. Don't listen to the other reviewers about not using oil. If you don't, the tortillas will crack, the oil makes them soft. I tried it both ways. Also, I used frozen spinach from a bag and it was still good.

Pretty good recipe, but corn tortillas are a pain. The second time I made it, I didn't dip the corn tortillas in oil. It still tasted pretty good and is a lot healthier/easier. (this isn't traditional, but...)

Great recipe... I skipped the oil for the tortilla shells, and I couldn't figure out what enchillada sauce was, so I used salsa.  Great leftovers too!
