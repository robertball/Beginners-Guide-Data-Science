We really enjoyed this flavorful roast.  I didn't have red onion or plain yogurt so I used vidalia onions and no yogurt.  I took the foil off for the last ten minutes to let it brown just a little bit.  I served it over egg noodles and the sauce over the top was quite yummy. Thanks so much!

This turned out really good!  I didn't have all the ingredients though.  I didn't have the plain yogurt, buillion cubes or red onion.  Even without thus stuff the pork turned out great, very tender with lots of flavor.  I will be making this again

AMAZING!  We had to cook our pork loin longer than 1.5 hours but I think it may have been slightly frozen in the middle still.  The flavors meld so well, the pork is incredibly tender and the entire dish is delicious!  We served the sauce on mashed potatoes.  If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!

Thank you for all your comments! I just realized that the recipe is in fact incorrect and SHOULD say "1/2 tsp SALT" and NOT 2tsp. 
I appreciate all the feedback. To me, it is always constructive to hear another's  opinion.

Awesome! I made it as written with two exceptions due to what was on hand and my convection oven. I used sour cream instead of yogurt and a sweet onion instead of red. I covected the tenderloin on "roast" at 325 for 1 hour and fifteen minutes and it was well above 160. I was worried because it was overcooked, but it was still excellent and very tender. Next time, I will check it at one hour -there WILL be a next time. The sauce was a little salty, but the meat was not. The pepper flakes give it a kick that jumps this from a four star to a five. Thanks!!!!!

I really liked this one!  I have made it with or without the yogurt, didn't make much difference.  I have also ommited the oregano & basil and just used thyme, I prefer it that way.  Overall a really good recipe.

We liked this recipe.. but I cut back on the parsley. I used chardonney, but the marinade had a bite to it. Perhaps a sweet wine would be better.

I cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp and would just leave it out next time.  It was a bit too salty.  There is plenty of salt in bouillon in my opinion.  I used loin rather than tenderloin, taking care to remove as much fat as possible before cooking, and it turned out remarkably moist and tender.  I also used "Better Than Bouillon" in place of bouillon cubes.

Excellent - as another reviewer said, consider cutting the salt. The next time we make this, we won't add any salt because the buillon cube had enough salt in it.   My kids loved this and they are fairly picky.   Great blending of flavors.  We will make this again.

Not bad. Used cream of chicken instead of the bouillon. Baked for an hour.

This recipe was amazing! I actually added some extra parsley, doubled the garlic, and used 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise instead of yogurt. I also opted for fresh oregano, basil and thyme. The sauce is very colorful which is nice on the plate, however the sauce is a little TOO liquid. It's still delicious, and the pork loin was very tender. I served this with mashed potatoes (yummy with the sauce!), some cooked baby carrots with dill and butter, and a nice fresh salad. It was a wonderful dinner!

Left out the oregano because I dont care for it. I used pork chops instead of loin and marinated them (4 hours) with wine, sour cream becuase I didnt have yogurt, dijon, garlic, lemon juice, the seasoning listed...including the boullion cube. It was sooooooo juicy and delicious. I served with red potatos and asparagus. My husband LOVED it
***EDIT**** I made this again a few weeks ago and I dont know what I did different or wrong but it was disgusting. We took a few bites and in the trash it went. I think it ruined this recipe for me and I wont make it again  :(

This was very good, but extremely salty.  I halved the ingredients and used a pork tenderloin, baking it for a little less than an hour. 
There was quite a lot of liquid left in the baking pan which would probably have make a delicious gravy for mashed potatoes.

Excellent!  Made this for a recent Christmast party & my guests LOVED it.  Be sure to marinate it for 3 or 4 hours prior to roasting.  I didn't have plain yogurt so I used sour cream.  Also increased the Dijon. Give this on a try - you won't be sorry!

This is the best pork I've ever made!  My hubby and 2 yr old LOVED it.  I added some water and thickened the drippings to make a really yummy sauce. Divine!!!

This is a GREAT pork tenderloin recipe!  I normally do NOT like pork tenderloin because it either has hardly any flavor or it is extremely dry and chewy.  My hubby and I couldn't eat enough of this.  I loved the marriage of flavors...and think it was perfect.  I did have to change a few things for personal preference/what I had in the fridge though.  I used Chobani plain Greek yogurt for the plain yogurt.  I also didn't have any dijon mustard on hand so I added a tablespoon of honey and about 1.5 tsp of ground mustard.  I also only added about 2 tbsp of fresh lemon juice because I must have had the most non-juicy lemon EVER.  I minced the garlic and the red onion in my mini food processor so it was really finely minced, which was perfect.  And lastly, my tenderloin was only 2 lb. as I had cut a 4 lb. tenderloin in half to make two meals from it.  Would make this again for sure.  Thank you!!

I think this is an exceptional recipe!  I was a bit put off by all the ingredients at first, so I made it with what I did have.  I omitted Dijon and lemon juice and it was STILL fantastic!  I added a little more wine and butter to the juices and used a flour/water mix to thicken into a gravy.  My boyfriend and little girl LOVED it, we had no leftovers!  :)    kudos, and thanks for sharing!

Yummy! I made only 2 changes to recipe (white wine vinegar instead of white wine b/c I did not have any and left out the lemon since there was enough acidity already with the vinegar), marinated overnight and roasted in my Romertopf - fantastic! Meat is full of flavor and supermoist, and the sauce is delicious (poured liquid into little saucepan, added some starch mixed into 1/4 cup apple juice - still no wine - and some heavy cream: seasoning was spot-on).  This will be my standard pork loin recipe!

I thought this was absolutely delicious.  It will probably be better the next time I make it - I was short a bit of lemon juice and had no yogurt, so the next time I make it I'm sure it will be that much better.  But regardless, I will for sure be making this again!

I made as written, and cooked right away.  This was just ok.  It might be better marinating overnight, but I probably won't try again.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some wine and a fellow AR Buzzer recommended this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly did not change a thing. It was an enjoyable piece of pork, although not sure this recipe is a keeper for me. Thank you for sharing. Did take an extra hour to cook that the recipe.

I have to start this off by saying I don't like pork.  This, however, was amazing.  I used a pork loin as I didn't have tenderloin but it was fantastic.  Even my picky 14 year old son loved it.  Will be making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Just wanted to add that I didn't use any salt and it was salty enough.  Also I will use less garlic.  I already reduced it to 2 cloves but it was still too much for my taste.  Oh and I didn't have dijon mustard so I just used regular spicy brown mustard.

Way too salty.  Unfortunately I didn't see the reviewer's suggestion to cut the salt until AFTER I had made this.  I may try it again, just without the salt next time.

This recipe was great, but I think next time I will leave out the yogurt all together, and I did add a few more red pepper flakes-we love heat!

This recipe was wonderful the meat was so juicy and tender. I made this for new years dinner and it was a hit. I read that it was a little salty so i did not add the salt and used spicy mustard instead of dijon. The salt level was still high but it was still really good! I also let it marinate in the fridge for about 3 hours. I recommend this everyone!

very tender! I used all fresh herbs and the marinade/sauce was very tangy and flavorful. I did reduce the salt to approx. 1/2 tsp.

This is such a great change on the normal pork loin. I did not have parsley, so I used dried. I did not have yogurt, so I used sour cream. I am sure you could leave it out all together and it would be just fine. It turned out wonderful. My husband really enjoyed it. I baked it in the sauce, covered. Then took the cover off towards the end to brown it up a bit and reduce the sauce. I served it with mash potatoes and some of the sauce on top. You'll be mopping up the drippings with each bite of pork!

I rarely review recipes, since I so often find myself having to fine tune them to my liking. But this was the best tenderloin recipe I've ever made! I agree with some of the comments that it was a little salty, but I love salt, so it was just perfect for us. The chunky "gravy" resulting from the cooked out marinade was fabulous on potatoes as well!

This was an excellent recipe. I used a 2lb pork tenderloin and baked it for 1 hour and it came out perfect. It was so tender you could cut it with a fork and was very juicy as well.  The sauce tasted great baked on the pork, but I did not end up using any of the "extra" sauce to pour over it. I am not sure if it is because I used "Greek yogurt" instead of regular plain yogurt, but the sauce came out sort of curdled or chunky. It looked unappetizing so I didn't want to serve it with the meal. The portion that had cooked into the pork was really flavorful so I will probably try to use regular plain yogurt next time to see if that changes anything.  Otherwise the dish was great and SUPER easy. My husband liked it so much he told me to make it again tomorrow night! This one is a winner!

I accidentally overcooked it and the sauce burnt onto the glass pan I used. It was a little tough but edible. Should have matched it more closely. Anyway, I omitted the plain yogurt, used a regular onion instead of red, used grainy Dijon mustard and used dried parsley instead of fresh. Next time I will skip the salt because the bouillon was salty enough on its own. I found it a little spicy, so I may use less or omit the chili flakes next time. It was good in a pinch, but I've had better tenderloin recipes than this. Most likely won't ake again.

This pork tenderloin was full of flavour, moist and delish!  Only small changes were omitting the oregano as I was surprisingly out and I did use whole grain dijon.  Oh, left out the salt too, don't think it was needed with the bouillon.  Scaled the recipe back for one pound of tenderloin and it was cooked in about 1 hour.  Loved the bit of a bite from the pepper flakes and the lemon juice/wine gave it a nice tang, yummy!

The loin was very moist and the red pepper flakes gave it some zing.  I didn't have yogurt so i used sour cream.  I added it after it had cooked which made it creamy. will make again.

Pronounced as "Excellent" by my teenager. It turned out very moist and tender. I followed the recipe closely except I used a bit more yogurt and added tarragon and sage to the list of spices. Served with rice and veggies. Made for a yummy dinner!

we didn't have yogurt so we used sour cream

as it made it pretty tangy

This is the best pork sauce I have ever made.  The first time I used it on a roast and liked it so much that now I use it on any type of pork.  The other day I cut up a pork tenderloin, pounded it into fillets, marinated it in this sauce and then pan fried.  Delicious sauce!

Used this on porkchops, and it was great!  Changing the recipe yeild from 6 servings to 2 makes the perfect amount of sauce for four porkchops.  Still cook in the oven, but be sure to have your meat thermometer nearby -- they won't take long.

I used all the ingredients, but slightly increased the portions, due to pork loin size.  This meal was great!  I served it with egg noodles and asparagus.  The sauce was great, but salty on the noodles.  This was my fault.  I will definitely fix this again.

I wish I could give this recipe more stars because I had high hopes for it and thought the flavor showed promise.  However, my family did not like it at all - thought the marinade was way too salty and overpowered the pork.  I think the bouillon, wine, and lemon juice would be adequate; no need to add salt.  Although I would be willing to try the recipe again with this adjustment, my family is adamantly opposed, so I guess the recipe is a one-timer for us.

This is fantastic!! I didn't have Dijon mustard or thyme, so I subbed regular yellow mustard and sage. I only had plain Greek Yogurt - good choice. Everything else was exactly as the recipe called for. The whole family agreed that the pork would have been even more amazing if I'd had the Dijon that was called for, so I'll buy some soon. Even my youngest son, who doesn't care much for meats, gobbled this up. I WILL be making this again - probably often! Thank you for a wonderful recipe Jamie M!

Very good.  Mine took about 1 and 1/2 hours and I had the oven at 375.  I followed the recipe exactly and since it s summertime I used all fresh herbs instead of dry.  I best part was the next day; the meat was so good sliced cold on some garlic naan with veggies and tiziki.  An awesome no-cook summer sandwich!

I wrapped this in foil and did it on the bbq for guests and was really ashamed over how it turned out.  The flavour was very herby - I think I would have liked it way better on lamb.  Overall, the flavour combinations seemed very mismatched.  And in foil on the bbq the meat just went dark grey and soggy with white dryed yogurt spots all over  - very unappetizing.  Won't try this again.

Yum. Lots of depth to the sauce. I use sour cream in place of the yogurt as I always have it on hand. Fresh parsley is a must, I don't use any if I only have dried.

I tried this recipe on my foodie hubby today and OH MY!!!  Talk about hitting it out of the park.  I did not have fresh parsley so I used dried rosemary; 1/4 cup of chicken broth for the bouillon cubes and used plain greek yogurt.    BUT this was an absolutely amazing recipe and has become a favorite to be cooked again!!

This was excellent! A little spicy for our taste, so next time I will probably cut out the pepper all together. My husband and I liked it like that, but our little guys, not so much. I served this over buttered egg noodles and wish I had doubled the marinade because it was so good we were practically licking the plates! I also shortened the cook time by putting it in my pampered chef deep covered baker in the microwave. It sounds crazy, but comes out just as tender, juicy and yummy!

Wonderful!  The marinade seemed a bit tart to me so I did add a little bit of sugar to balance the acidic ingredients. I don't really remember how much I added; I tasted it as I added a little at a time until it just began to cross the line into sweet then stopped.  I did also take the advice of previous reviewers and cut back on the salt by about half.

The pork was very tender but didn't have nearly as much flavor as everyone said. However, I didn't use the yogurt as I read a review that said it was fine with or without it.

This was really, really good. It was more than well done by the time it had it's hour & half cook time, but it was still tender and moist and the flavor was great, with the 'gravy' this makes the tastiest surprise. I will mention that I left out the wine and the salt and bouillon cube. I was making this for my family, including kids, and this recipe as is packs a whopping sodium punch. Even so, it was very, very good. It drew my 7 yr old into the kitchen saying "What's that amazing smell"? and both kids ate every bite.

This had a lot going on for flavor, but not our thing.  The dijon, lemon, and onion weren't a good mix.  I like onions and this was too "oniony".  Probably won't try to rework this.

This was amazing!!! I left out the yogurt (didn't have any) and cooked till it was ~145 degrees. I put the left over juices in a pan and added a little corn starch to make a sauce. this was so good my husband and I could not stop eating it.  Thank you for sharing!

This made a great marinade and sauce for the meat after it was cooked.  I added some chicken broth and flour to thicken it up then heated it up.  Lots of positive comments from the diners.

used this recipe to marinate Pork for next day's grilling party. 

Huge success !

++ Used leftover red wine instead of white what gave an additional flavor. 
++ added a few finely chopped green chillies, what turned out quite nice.
-- used Sour Cream that I had in the fridge, but in doing so created imbalance unless one likes sour, so next time will use yoghurt and lime.

-I didn't have regular dijon so I used stone ground.
-I couldn't find a 3lb tenderloin so used 2 littles that added up to about 3lbs.
-Cooking time ended up being 65 minutes.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. 
Thank you!!

The roast came out perfectly tender.  The flavors were a bit overwhelmingly sour, but mellowed atop a pile of buttered egg noodles with a side of sweet steamed greenbeans.  As noted, a little too salty.  Between the dijon and the bullion, little or no salt would be better.   I substituted vanilla FF yogurt, as it was all I had.   I actually went two hours because it was a 4lb roast.  Also, cooked it open for the last 15 minutes.
Might try this again with some variables... less lemon, sweeter wine or maybe top with a little brown sugar and ginger.

Delicious!  I used this for thick pork chops.  I used white onions instead of red, sour cream instead of the yogurt and lemon.  I also was out of chicken bouillon so I reduced a can of chicken broth.  I let the chops marinate for a few hours, pan seared them and then finished them in the oven.  I boiled the marinade, used it as a sauce with white rice and green beans.  Even my 2 year old son liked it.  In fact, he finished all the left over rice that I mixed with the remaining sauce.  I'll definitely make this again.

So delicious! Just the right blend of tangy and spicy, and the seasonings are perfect for pork. However, my husband and I both thought it was too salty. Next time I will cut back the salt to 1/2 tsp, then salt to taste on my plate.

Made this exactly as written except used a pork loin roast, not a tenderloin.  I also reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. and also added some hot mustard powder with the other spices and marinated in the refrigerator for 4 hours before putting in the oven.  Very good flavor.  Will make again as my husband really liked it.

Wow!  My whole family loved this.  Very tasty and quite moist.  I found it to be easier than another recipe I usually use for pork loin roast.  I did not use the salt due to the bouillon and it was fine.  I used dried parsley as I did not have fresh, and bottled lemon juice and spicy brown mustard because I didn't have dijon on hand.  I look forward to trying it again with all of the proper ingredients and I will definitely be working this into the dinner line-up.  I also made baked potatoes since the oven was already on and the cool of the refrigerated cinnamon/clove-spiced  apple sauce I served with it was a nice complement to the spicy/tangy sauce.  Thank you for this recipe.

Wow, is this ever good.  I made it the first time as the recipe states, let it marinate overnight and covered it while cooking.  Was so good that my family requested it again not long after.  The second time I didn't read the instuctions and forgot to cover the loin.  The sauce reduced down and was way too strong.  My family remembered the great sauce from the time before and covered their potatoes with it.  Not a good idea this time as it was too strong.  Make the recipe and follow the instructions and you are in for a wonderful treat.  Don't forget to cover while cooking.

I used shallots instead of red onions and sour cream instead of yogurt.  I used the ratio BUT I only used one 1 1/2 lb tenderloin.  J likes this one better than the other.  I also put some mushrooms in.

this was pretty tasty.. i used this as a 2 day marinade for pork chops (change of plans etc).. i left out the yogurt and chicken bouillon but followed everything else pretty much to the letter other than subbing dried parsley for the fresh and white onion for the red.. the reason i left out the bouillon was b/c i was worried about some reviewers saying this was salty.. i think i should have added some of it/half of it? maybe next time.. ty for the recipe

So, so tasty. I made it tonight and just about died, it tasted so good. Very flavorful. I love the slight tang from the Dijon mustard.

Definitely made a  very juicy and flavorful roast.  Just think the marinade is a little to strong as a sauce. I will remove from the pan and heat it up with some cream to tone it down some. Very good though.

loved this marinade!  I recommend searing the roast first for presentation and the extra flavour. I did not have yogurt so I used sour cream and no fresh parsley so dried worked!

W@W! This was reeeeaaallyy good! I only added a pinch of salt instead of the 2 tsp, especially since the recipe calls for bouillion cube which is also salty. The only other deviations I made were to sub sour cream for the yogurt as that's what I had on hand. I also seared the meat on all sides before covering with the marinade and baking. This is so yumalicious!

We used vermouth instead of wine and this was FANTASTIC.  I think the cook time listed is a little long -- it was tender, but a little overcooked.  Otherwise, PERFECTION!

I thought it was great, my fiance loved it... I just found it to be a bit dry by itself, but if you dip it in the juices or marinade it is FANTASTIC! i can't say enough about how flavorful and filling it was.

Not bad, but not good.  A little too much lemon as well.

Very good!  Just the right amount of everything.  The only thing I changed was that I cut my loin into chops, marinated them, and then grilled them in a skillet until thoroughly cooked.
