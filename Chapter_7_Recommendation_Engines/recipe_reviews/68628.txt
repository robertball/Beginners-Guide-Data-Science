I decided to try this recipe at the last minute and didn't have 3+ hours to marinade.  After cooking the marinade I placed the pork chops in a baking dish and completely soaked them with the soy mixture then baked them 45 minutes in the soy mixture bath.  For the last 15 minutes I put the pork chops on a rack and baked with the ketchup/cocktail sauce.  The chops melted in our mouths and were delicious!!  My family thought the cocktail sauce wasn't the best complement to the pork - so I might try it with the original chili sauce next time.

Yes, this was a mistake, but not one made for the good.  My advise is... follow  the orginal recipe.

I made this exactly as written and it was wonderful! I tried it again in my slow cooker and even though it came out juicer it was still very good, though not as good as when cooked as per directions. To make in the slow cooker I used frozen pork chops so I also didn't get to marinade them, either which detracted from the full flavor experience. Hubby really liked it too. This is a keeper.

Easy to make, tastes great, family favorite.  Be sure to bake in shallow pan so chops will get crisp on outside.

I enjoyed the recipe as is, and for my taste I think that using sweet chili sauce instead of cocktail sauce would make this way too sweet! I will probably decrease the brown sugar next time, but that's just me.

My family loved them but I thought they were too sweet.  I'll probablyl make it again though just cuz my family loved it so much.  I did like the sauce on rice - I think eatcing the dish with rice helped thin out the sweetness a little....anyway - I'm just giving it 4 stars cuz my family loved it.

Wow...this was really delicious!!! It was so full of flavour, the right amount of spicy and sweet! BUT I used the 'original' recipe, I love chili and don't really care for cocktail sauce, so I didn't replace it.

Wow! This is a great 'mistake'! I tried this the other night, and my boyfriend was both shocked and delighted when I told him I basically used cocktail sauce for this marinade. I would definitely do this again!! I think next time I might add a wee bit of cayenne or crushed red pepper for an extra kick!

I Thought this was very good, the cocktail sauce gave it a nice taste. I'm not a big pork chop fan but this was delicious, it was not too wet, but just right. My roommate and I are going to try this on other types of meat in the future, like chicken or fish. It should be just as awesome

Excellent recipe, with a little change.  I used chili sauce, ketchup with Tabasco sauce and did not marinate the pork in the first step..I omitted that all together because of time restraints. I will marinate next time to see how that turns out.  But, oh, how wonderful! I will make again!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were WONDERFUL!  I  love cocktail sauce!  I finally realized that it was cocktail sauce I liked more than the shrimp in shrimp cocktail so this recipe seemed right up my alley!  I did make a slight change, however, after trying the original recipe.  I wonder if many folks realize there is LOW SODIUM soy sauce available?  I used that the second version instead & it worked beautifully!  The original soy sauce level contained a WHOPPING 4735 mg. of sodium, (189% daily requirement) so by using the low sodium version, I was able to lower that amount, at least.  In addition to that, after making it with this minor change, the next time I added about a Tablespoon of horseradish, to add spice.  This was because my family requested "more zip";-).  It did zip it, and again, the dish had the same wonderful flavor!  

This recipe is DEFINITLY a keeper!  I will admit that with the sodium issue & the high  sugar element, I will have to  limit the times I serve this wonderful meal!  Thanks so much Bookchicadee for publishing this great "mistake".  I hope the minor changes will inspire those who wanted more zip, & lower sodium to try it again.  You won't be disappointed!

Now, if I can try with Splenda, I can lower the sugar level, but you can't always have everything!  I'll update if I have any success.

I made this twice so far. The second time I used 1/4 soy sauce and 3/4 cup Kikkoman Less Sodium Teriyaki sauce  because I ran out of soy sauce. I didn't use the second half of the recipe on top and grilled it and it was wonderful just as a marinade.

I thought the cocktail sauce added a nice flavor. My husband even said I could make it again (that doesn't happen very often). I used a tangy cockatil sauce.

After cooking the pork chops I boiled the left over sauce for about 10 minutes on the stove and served as a topping for the meat. My family loved it and have requested I make it again!

It was ok but not great.  There's a lot of sugar in this.  I probably won't make it again.

I thought this was very good.  The cocktail sauce I used has a strong horseradish base, and I love horseradish!  Unfortunately my husband wasn't as fond of this version, he prefers the one I usually make which is similar but with the chili sauce.  I will compromise and make this version, every other time!  Thanks for a nice recipe idea.

I made this just as the recipe directs.  Marinated for 3 hours.  The pork chops were absolutely delicious.  The sauce was so flavorful and went incredibly well with the mashed sweet potatoes that I served with the pork chops.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

My husband is incredibly picking....he likes things "plain"' but after trying this dish, he said we have to make this the next time we have company!  I marinated a pork tenderloin for three hours, and cooked in a 350 degree oven until the internal temperature reached 155.  Took it out of oven, covered in foil, and let it rest foot 10 minutes.  This pork was melt in your mouth perfect and delicious.  Fabulous recipe!  I couldn't eat any leftovers because me husband insisted that he use the remaining meat for sandwiches for his lunch!

I am not fond of pork chops, but I made this last night and I will definitely make it again.  My boyfriend loved it!!!  I only used 1/4 cup of soy sauce to cut back on the sodium and I didn't have dried mustard so I used spicy brown mustard instead.  I will probably use less ketchup next time just to cut back on the sugar....otherwise it was a winner!!

Just an FYI chilli sauce in the bottle and cocktail sauce 
are used interchangeable all the time.

We absolutely loved this recipe, some reviews said that it was too sweet so I did cut back the sugar and sweet ingredients a bit, but the tomato moist sweetness on too of the savory pork chops was crazy good!!

We made this with 2 changes.  We used Agave Nectar instead of honey since we were out of honey and low sodium Tamari instead of soy sauce as that's what we prefer. Since most of the marinade went down the sink after marinading I gotta believe that the sodium count isn't as high as listed but with the low sodium tamari it was even lower than that.  Really really liked this and would make again.

I made this for dinner tonght. It was good. I had hoped that the pork had more of a glaze than a sauce but it was good. I served it with an Oriental Rice dish and corn. I would rate this a 3 1/2 star if I could.

This was great. Everyone loved the taste. I am not a great fan of chili so I'm going to try this 'mistake' on a couple of other recipes.  I hope submitter can submit a couple more mistakes.  Thanks for sharing.

I only changed the recipe from the cocktail to the Sweet Chili Sauce.  That sauce was yummy--which is why I gave it three stars.  The pork chops soy flavor was too strong.  I followed all the directions including marinating times.  I used butterfly pork chops and cooking them for an hour would have been way too long.  I cooked them for 45 minutes and they were still overdone and dry.

I didn't have cocktail sauce so I used the original chili sauce. I also omitted the lemon juice.  I didn't have ground dry mustard so I used spicy brown mustard! I didn't cook it nearly as long, it was ready in 40 minutes! I thought it was delicious!  It reminded me of ribs!  Yummy :)

I made this for dinner last night.  I actually DO NOT like cocktail sauce so I was a little concerned putting it in the recipe, but assumed the other ingredients would overpower it so I wouldn't notice it.  It turned out great, and my husband loved it too!  I used less ketchup than the recipe called for because I ran out...I thought it was a bit on the sweet side (didn't notice any zest), and will probably use less brown sugar next time, but it was tasty!

This was very good.  I did use some of the marinade to cook the chops, then I drained them before I put the chili sauce mixture on top.  Recipe doesn't say, but once you put the chili sauce mixture on top of the chops, finish the cooking with chops uncovered.  Chops were moist, and the leftovers reheated well in the microwave.  I will definitely make this again.

I had to make an adjustment to the marinade since I'm out of honey. The best I could do was substitute hoisin sauce. That turned out fine, and I wouldn't be surprised if honey would have made it too sweet for me.

Th e sauce needs to be tweaked a bit so the ketchup doesn't overwhelm the other ingredients, but the meat came out amazingly tender.  I will definitely make this again.

I wish I would of checked this recipe out more thoroughly before I made it. My legs swelled terribly from this recipe.  This should not be listed as a healthy recipe. The sodium count is 4,735 mg. That is unbelievably high.  Yes the dish was delicious, but I will not make this again.  Talk about heart disease in the making. I have to give it one star due to the sodium count. If you have blood pressure issues or heart disease to do not make this.

I was unsure about the cocktail sauce portion of this recipe. Instead, I used the original recipe with sweet chili sauce and cooked it in the crock pot. The pork marinated overnight and I cooked it with the marinade in the crockpot for 7 hours. 5 hours in, I spooned out some of the liquid, then poured the sauce mixture over the meat and continued cooking for 2 hours. It was delicious! Maybe next time I'll be brave and try it with cocktail sauce instead.

I wasn't to thrilled with this recipe, the marinade was awesome. The reason for the 2 stars bc the sauce wanted cocktail sauce which my husband and I thought was a huge mistake! We may do this recipe again but only with the marinade!!

I'm giving the recipe four stars because my family rated it a six or seven on a 1-10 scale. I mixed this recipe up with another one and used thin, bone-in chops. They felt it would be better with thicker chops.
We will try it again, with the thicker chops.
They loved the sauce; especially the cocktail sauce.
Thanks for sharing!

Great flavor.  I only made about half of the sauce, as it seemed like a lot.  Easy to make although it is 4 steps.  I would make it again.

Followed exactly as written.  Combination of Flavors was inedible for us.

I had these last night.  They were AWESOME. As I was preparing the sauce.  I discovered I didn't have cocktail sauce.  It was chili sauce instead.  So, I added some horseradish and worchester sauce to the sauce.  They turned a great. I will definitely make these again.  Also, going to try this sauce on chicken.

The pork chops were tender. But the taste was gross.

Tried this yesterday.  I cut it down to 2 servings & made Al's homemade cocktail sauce on this site.  It was really pretty good, however, next time I think I will marinate it overnight and do the rest of the time in the crock pot the next day.  I think that the chops might be a little more tender this way.  Will let you all know how it turns out this way.  The recipe is a keeper.

Followed the recipe exactly, except barbecued the chops. I found there was way too much soy sauce and this overpowered the taste. Would have been better with less and maybe a touch of rice wine vinegar. Won't make again.

Very bland.  The only flavor that stood out was ketchup.  Kept it in the oven for 90 minutes and it still did not look browned like the picture.

Too much sauce. Next time I'll use half of the recipe.
