I tried this recipe twice.  The first time through, I followed the recipe to a "T" and the pie was perfect!  The second time through, I used all the same amounts and did everything the same, EXCEPT I didn't cook the cherries and sugar and cornstarch.  I mixed them all together in a bowl and let them macerate for a few minutes, then placed them in the crust and baked.  The cherries held together better this way and the juices still made a nice gel to hold it all together.  I'd suggeset cooking the pie a little longer, though, if you do it this way, because you aren't starting with a hot filling.

5-Star filling. I used my own crust and 2 one pound bags of frozen, tart, red cherries (Let thaw before cooking or you'll be stirring for an hour!. I also added an extra 1/2 tbls. of cornstarch as the frozen berries were giving off a ton of liquid. I was told by four different people to open a bakery after they tasted this pie!!

I'm not a fan of cherry pie myself, but even I enjoyed this recipe. I used frozen "dark sweet" cherries and the "Pie Crust" recipe from this site. My only problem was that I couldn't get the cherry mixture to come to a boil. Finally, after about 25 minutes of trying, it started to really thicken up so I went ahead and finished the recipe without it ever actually boiling. This didn't seem to affect anything though, and everyone who tried it liked it.

OMG!  This is the most delicious cherry pie ever!  My hands looked like I was an extra for a horror film after pitting all those cherries, but it was worth it. I added a tsp. of vanilla to the filling mixture, but other than than, I wouldn't change a thing!  I did a lattice top and used a different pie crust - "Grandma's Secrect Pie Crust" from this site. It's perfect for this pie. Great recipe!

5 stars for filling, 1 star crust...

Definitely use the filling from this recipe.  It is so amazingly good!  It's off the charts great and you almost hear a heavenly choir as you taste the perfect flavors.  But the key to this recipe is to replace the crust.  Look up a totally different recipe for the crust.  This crust has good flakiness, but is so very bland that it detracts from the superb filling.  My family ate the filling and scraped the crust away to avoid that part - even with the cinnamon and sugar I sprinkled on top to combat it.  No, you can't salvage it by adding a little this and that. Trust me, you do not want this crust at all.  BUT - The filling is the BEST!  It has such great flavor!  Can't say enough good about that!  I am adopting the filling as my permanent cherry filling recipe.  Mmmmmm....

This wonderful pie filling recipe has solved my problem with runny cherries without a pasty or custardy filling.  I used my own crust instead.  I can see why it won first place. And oh so easy!

This was a very good recipe, just the right texture for the filling.  It was a little too sweet for my tastes, but that is something that varies widely among different people.  I would only suggest tasting the mixture as you are adding the sugar if you prefer more a more tart cherry pie.

Four stars only because I used a different crust.  I used very ripe pie cherries straight from the tree.  The filling was spectacular - the gel amongst the cherries was like silk.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

I'm writing this review for the filling only as I make my own crust. I used 4 cups frozen dark cherries that I thawed and drained ahead of time. If you are using anything but sour cherries I suggest you reduce the sugar to about 3/4 cup. Also if you are using pure almond extract versus immitation almond extract I suggest adding only 1/8 tsp as using 1/4 tsp overpowered everything else. I suggest putting about 1/4 Cup of the 3/4 cups sugar directly on the bottom crust with about 1Tbs flour and cook your pie on 450 for about 15 mins and then reduce heat for the remainder of the cooking time. This allows the sugar to caramelize on the bottom and prevent a soggy bottom crust. I do this with all my fruit based pies. Note that if you do this then that leaves 1/2 Cup sugar for the filling. Last but not least I agree with other reviewers that you don't need to cook/boil the filling before hand. Just toss the cherries with almond extract, sugar and cornstarch let sit 10 mins and add to pie crust. It will boil in the pie while cooking and will not be liquid at all (make sure you allow enough time for cooling down though)

This tasty recipe left me licking my fingers after I finally placed the pie in the oven. The included crust recipe is a little bland, but this pie is otherwise a great treat. The almond extract makes a world of difference.

Finally--a recipe for a cherry-pie filling that actually gels!  I can't describe how many cherry pies I've made that were too runny or too dry.  This recipe also works fine with sweet cherries.  Thanks very much, Beth.

I made this with high hopes... It didn't live up to them, unfortunately.  The only cherries I could find (frozen) were sweet, dark cherries. I have a baby and didn't really have time to buy fresh cherries and pit all of them. Something was off in the flavor. Not too sweet though. Considering I used sweet cherries and the called-for amount of sugar in this recipe. I used already-made pie crust. But I always do that! It's sooo much easier for me. If I ever have more time I will definitely try and use fresh cherries. Just wanted everyone to know - BEWARE of the frozen, dark, sweet cherries.

The filling made in step 2 can be used in a no-bake pie, such as one made with a graham cracker crust, by extending the boiling time from 5 min to around 15 min.  This also concentrates the flavor a bit by boiling down the liquid.

Fabulous recipe that gels perfectly!  For those like me who would have to google how many cups equals a pound of cherries, the answer is 2 1/2 cups per pound for small cherries or 3 cups for large cherries.  I used 6 cups of larger cherries for this recipe and it was perfect!  I like my pie tart since I always put vanilla ice cream on top so I reduced the sugar by 1/8 cup.

Great. I bought frozen sweet cherries from Sam's, but by the time I got home, they were almost defrosted; I had to make pie in a ramrod fashion, found this recipe to use, and ran with it. I used a storebought pie shell b/c I was doing this fast.  Great timesaver also bc this recipe says the piecrust doesn't have to be prebaked. Bc these were sweet, not sour, cherries, I used only 3/4 cup of sugar. Perfect. I even rounded up the cornstarch to 1/4 cup. The consistency of filling was perfect.  It should end up as thick as the canned cherries you can buy.  I think those reviewers that complained of a runny filling didn't let it simmer long enough.  You must be sure not to rush that step. You'll see the difference between thick like a gravy, and REALLY thick like pie filling. Keep simmering until it thickens like that.  Will file this away to make again, perhaps using a combo of berries next time.

I loved this pie!   I did not have quite enough pie cherries for two pie, so I  used 2.50lbs of pie cherries and .75lb of bing.  I did not increase the sugar, but did add 1 additional TBL of cornstarch.   Made enough filling for two pies.  (oh, I should admit that I just used bought pie dough).

I've tried this twice, once as written, and once just combining the sugar, cornstarch, and cherries and not cooking them before baking.  BIG mistake.  The liquid didn't gel at all, so I poured out the filling and cooked again!  Delicious--just be sure and cook the filling before adding to the crust.

This was great! I don't like cherry pie, but my husband and our friends loved this! They said it was the best they'd had! I used two 14 oz. cans of pitted tart cherries. I boiled the juice from the cans with the sugar and corn starch, then turned the heat down and mixed in the cherries (so they could heat up a bit) and butter and extract. It turned out perfectly! I did use a different pie crust recipe from this site, and it was flaky and light. I've never made a pie before, so this was really fun. :)

The best cherry pie ever! This was my first time making a cherry pie from scratch. This was easy, quick and delicious! I made this recipe from the cherry tree at our new home. What a way to start making good memories. I followed the recipe exactly. WOW! I added a brushing of egg whites and a dusting of sugar over the top crust before baking to make a beautiful sweet golden crust. My oven baked it perfect in 50 minutes. Thanks for sharing a great recipe that will stay with me!

I should note that I used my own crust recipe so this rating is strictly for the filling. Wow!  Absolutely delicious!  I made this at Thanksgiving, for those who are not big fans of pumpkin pie, and this was gone in a matter of minutes.  It was expensive (I used canned pitted sour cherries, which were over $3.50 for each of the 3 jars I needed), but worth every penny when I tasted it.

Oh wow! this was the best cherry pie filling recipe I have ever made. I used my own crust recipe, because quite frankly, I know how to 'work' my crust, and I like my crust. The filling was beautiful; the pie sliced up so nicely, there was no leakage in my pie plate at all. My husband devoured 3 slices in short order, saying it was the best I had ever made...We get several pounds of sour cherries(around 30) every summer through a neighbour, so it is not as if I don't make cherry pies frequently.

Perfect!! 

I had tried this recipe for the first time this past Easter Sunday for my boyfriend's grandmother's party and everyone loved it! The taste was on point and the crust came out just right. I was asked to make another for an upcoming birthday :) Thank you, thank you!

I made this pie for Christmas and received raving reviews.  People doubted I made it from scratch even, saying it was bakery quality.  I used 3 12 oz bags of frozen pitted cherries and it filled my 9" pie crust perfectly.  Will definately be using this recipe again.

Five star filling.  (Gave only four stars because I used my own pie crust recipe.)  I had to use the total amount of sugar in the recipe because my cherries were very tart, but the filling becomes sweeter after the baking process.  If you only like cherry filling, after trying this recipe, you will LOVE it!
I have also made this recipe by substituting Splenda and it was sweeter than when I used sugar, but the consistency was the same and 
it was still very good.  On another occasion  I added fresh blueberries after cooking it ontop of the stove and it was delicious.

Absolutely the best cherry pie recipe on here. I used 1lb of frozen dark sweet cherries (thawed before use) and cut the sugar used in half. Served with a dollop of freshly whipped cream and it was to die for!

I used fresh sour cherries from the farmer's market, cut the sugar to 1 cup, and cut the almond extract.  I used a Pillsbury pie crust. This was very good, but I think next time I'll cut the sugar even more -- it was very sweet!!

Fantastic recipe!  I was a bit too sweet for me, I will cut back on the sugar next time.  I also used jarred cherries as I didn't have fresh ones.  This tasted amazing, thanks Beth for your fabulous recipe!!  ....I used a different pie crust recipe..

My first pie ever! This pie turned out wonderful although the filling was a little runny at first. (fixed with cornstarch--- remember to stir with a little water in a glass BEFORE adding, or else it will clump into little white balls and look gross!) I learned that if you leave the pie in the fridge overnight the cornstarch makes the filling perfectly wiggly (my version of saying the right consistency). If you don't think the filling is thickening, leaving the pie in the fridge overnight will really perfect it. I put leaves and an acorn design in the middle. (be creative and make any design!) My mother doubted I could make a perfect pie---especially she doubted the crust --- but it was complemented on by my whole fam. In my taste the crust WAS a little bland, but you can fix that by sprinkling cinnamon and sugar over the bottom and top crusts. When refrigerating the crusts... you dont have to go the full timing.. just make sure they are chilled before using. I also used butter instead of shortening, i guess thats a bid old fashioned no-no, but it made it nice and flaky-- perfecto!

This was my first attempt at cherry pie.  I used 5 cans tart pie cherries (well drained), which turned out to be just enough. The almond extract made ALL the difference in the filling (which is DELICIOUS)--don't skip it! The only problem I had with the filling was my cherries didn't hold together, but that's probably because I used canned ones that were already very mushy. If you're going to do a lattice crust, let the filling cool first!  I didn't, and was left trying to weave melting, stretching strips of dough with very little success.

I'm giving the filling 5++++ stars!  It is outstanding!  I was going to make the cherry pie but after tasting the filling I decided that I'm going to make cheesecake instead and use it as the topping.  I used 1.5 lb (750g) frozen sour cherries (thawed and drained) and omited the butter and almond extra.  I added 1/2 tsp of lemon concentrate juice to get rid of the starchy taste.  This turned out perfect ... like the canned stuff you buy at the store.  Another keeper in my books since cherry pie filling is not sold here in Germany!

I made this last weekend to take to a friend's home for Sunday dinner.  This was the first time I'd made cherry pie and was a little nervous that it was going to turn out too sweet.  After cooking the cherries with the cornstarch and sugar I tasted it.  Sure enough the fruit I was using was sweet especially for sour cherries.  I ended up adding 2 Tbls of lemon juice to help break up the sweetness, which worked out perfectly.  Next time I'll check the sweetness of the fruit before adding sugar.  Also I didn't have any almond extract on hand so I used vanilla and it was a good combo.  Everyone loved the pie and I'll definitely use this recipe again.  Thank you Beth!

I have made this cherry pie numerous times and it's always a huge success. The only change I make from this recipe is you don't have to heat and boil the cherries, sugar and cornstarch. Just mix all the ingredients together, stir them and let sit for 10 minutes. Then pour into pie shell cover with top crust and cook for 1 hour. Saves time by not having to boil the cherries and turns out just as perfect and hold together beautifully!!!!

This is a great, easy cherry pie recipe.  My hubby always loved and begged me to make apple pie.  He never thought he would like cherry pie.  I made this for an event one year and ever since he got a taste of it he asks for this now - rarely his beloved apple pie.  I can't find sour cherries so I use 2 bags of frozen dark sweet cherries.  I replace the sugar with Splenda to make it a sugar free recipe and it is still incredible.  I add a little more almond extract than the recipe calls for and add in some vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  I am also a lazy baker so I 'cheat' and use the pillsbury pie crusts - they are better than any I can make from scratch.

The amount of cherries called for was WAY more than what would fill two 9 in. pies.  It was quite soupy, as well.  But the taste was good.

Fabulous cherry pie recipe.  I did not use this recipe for the crust but I did for the cherry filling.  It was great, I have never eaten cherry pie better than this!  This will now be my all time cherry pie recipe.

This recipe was a bust. The filling was really bland and the crust had way too much fat in it. I should have only used 3/4 cup of shortening for the crust, because 1 cup made it totally impossible to work with. I added tons of flour and it made pretty much no difference. I think the bland filling was my fault because i didn't relize i bought sweet cherrys, so i'm sure the filling with sour would have been great, the texture of the filling was perfect, it jelled nicely. But the crust was such a pain to work with I was too mad to even enjoy eating this bland pie lol. I won't be using this recipe again.

I thought this was delicious. I used frozen sour cherries (from my tree). I liked the idea of cooking the filling before putting it in the shell. It was so much easier to see just how thick the filling was going to be. I did not use the pie crust recipe given, only because I had some premade which I wanted to use up. My husband commented just how good those cherries tasted. Will be making this again.

Overall this was a great recipe. I used canned sour cherries (in water) and followed the recipe exactly. It was really sweet--too sweet for my taste. I used it with the Best Ever Pie Crust recipe, but might try a different crust if I make it again.

Used my own crust, and had to make it with dark sweet cherries, but otherwise made as written. Do not skip the cooking step.  This jelled perfectly and the almond extract was lovely! Thank you! I can't wait to try this with sour cherries if I can ever find any!

We have two cherry trees, but they are young & won't be bearing any fruit this year.  I had a few pounds of sweet cherries from the Farmer's Market & decided to try my hand at cherry pie.  This was the first recipe I tried & there is no need for me to even look for another recipe.  This recipe is perfect!   I used my own pie crust recipe, just because I am used to making it.  The only change I made to the filling recipe was to leave out a bit of the sugar, since I was using sweet cherries and not sour cherries like the recipe calls for.

Everyone who tasted this pie LOVED it.   I went to the Farmer's Market today and bought six more pounds of cherries so that I can make more pies.  

Thank you for sharing this recipe!   Its now a family favorite.

I used my own crust recipe, so this rating is just for the filling. Other than cutting the recipe in half (just my wife and I) I followed the recipe to a tee. This is the best cherry pie I have ever had! The balance of sweet and tart is perfect. Baked it in a 6 inch pie pan for 45 minutes. Five stars and highly recommended!

Very good pie.  The next time I make it I will omit the almond extract.  Although it isn't much it does give it a slight almond taste.

I made this for a christmas dinner and am just now getting around to rating it. My dad compared this to his mother's pie...which he has been trying to recreate since her passing 20 years ago! Everyone said it was the best cherry pie they ever tasted. Will be keeping this one!!!

Delicious filling - I used 2 cans of sour cherries packed in water (each around 14oz) and used Pepperidge Farms Phyllo Sheets as a crust and made a cherry tart! It was a hit and the best cherry tart/pie I've ever had!

I thought this pie was fine.  Didn't love it like so many people did here. I used canned tart cherries.  Maybe that's why.  Next time I'll use fresh cherries and see if that will make the difference.  I also used a store bought crust.

I only gave this 4 stars because I didn't make the crust.  The filling, though, was out of this world!  I used 4 cups of tart cherries from a tree and it took me about an hour to pit them.  I followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out great!  The amount of sugar and the almond extract offset the tartness of the cherries and the juice jelled up nicely instead of being too liquidy.  Next time, though, I'll double the filling because my pie plate is big.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I don't generally care for cooked cherries, but I had a bunch that were going bad so I decided to try a pie.  This was my first fruit pie ever, and it turned out soooooo good.  It was easy, and the flavor was phenomenal.

I used my own pie crust recipe; however, the filling I made with fresh cherries and it turned out better than I could have imagined.  I was concerned at first that the sauce was thin, but it thickened in no time at all.  I would definitely make this again!   Excellent!

This was SO GOOD! I used the pie crust recipe I always use when making pie and used 3/4 c sugar, as suggested by the other reviewers. The filling was terrific; this was my first time trying cherry pie made w/ real cherries rather than the canned stuff. Everyone liked it so much I made a second pie today, but w/ 1/2 tsp of almond extract, and it tastes great!

What a great cherry pie recipe!  I admit I didn't use the crust; I make mine with a combination of butter and shortening.  The filling was excellent.  Not too sweet, just enough to offset the tartness of the cherries, and thick enough not to run all over the place.  A funny thing, though:  If you find yourself in a position like me where you only have a pound of cherries (my friend picked me a tiny bit over a pound from the tree in her yard), halve the recipe.  I halved it and made the pie in a regular old 2 cup Fiestaware soup bowl.  (The shallow one that's about 5 or 6 inches across.)  I made enough crust for a one-crust 9-inch pie, cut the bottom crust out of it, then made a lattice top with the leftover pie crust dough.  I always use an earthenware pie plate anyway, so I thought this would work and it did.  Perfect size!  :)

This pie is a snap to make...and has turned out beautifully each time I've made it.  The filling is particularly nice:  not too sweet and just thick enough...and the almond extract is a really nice addition.

Crust was amazing. I thickened the filling too much, so it turned out rubbery. I'll try making it again following the recipe this time.

Delicious.  If you let the cherries and sugar mix sit on low heat for ten minutes, the juices really pour out.  Also, make sure to note that you have to turn the heat in the oven down before you put the pie in.

Sprinkle sugar on crust before baking.  Kept cherries whole after pitting.  Everyone wants a cherry!  Can add almond extract.  Lots of water will come out of the cherries so there is no need to add water.
used a paper clip to pit the cherries. Only had 1 pound of fresh sweet cherries so I cut the filling ingredients in half. Used a frozen Marie Calendar pie crust which comes in 2 crusts. One I left in the fridge. After warming the second to room temperature, I cut into strips and created a lattice on top! See youtube.com "Betty's Quick Tip" and allrecipes.com "Chef John's Peach Pie" for good videos on how to make the lattice for fruit pies.

This was spectacular! Can't believe I have waited all these years to make a cherry pie from scratch!  I used store bought pie crusts to save time since I was making so many pies. Due to nut allergies in the family, I used triple the amount (per the internet) of vanilla extract.  As others suggested, I put 1/4 cup sugar on the bottom of the pie crust before adding the filling to prevent the bottom crust from becoming soggy.

This pie was perfect. Will make many of these in the years to come.

My daughters and I took a trip to Detroit's Eastern Market today.  We bought some fresh tart cherries, and when we got home, we decided to try this cherry pie recipe.  It turned out great - delicious and beautiful!  We used a different crust recipe (I've always had good luck with the recipe that came with my Pampered Chef stoneware pie plate), but we didn't make any changes to the filling.  It was time-consuming, mostly because we had to pit all the cherries, and it took a long time for the cherry mixture to boil, but it was worth it.  This recipe is a keeper!  (Next time, we may try it with a crumb topping instead of the lattice crust)

What a great recipe! It is the very first time I had ever baked a pie, and it turned out perfectly! The only thing I did differently was add a tiny pinch of Chinese 5 spice to add a bit of "mystery ingredient". Perfect!

This pie tastes absolutely amazing! It was the first pie I've ever made from scratch, and everyone in my family said it was the best cherry pie they have ever tasted! Some other reviews said the crust was bad so I brushed it with egg whites and sugar. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great!

This recipe was perfect! I used another cherry pie recipe last year when cherries were in season, and it was much more watery. The filling for this was, as another reviewer put it, like silk. I didn't think the crust was bland. It's just plain, flaky, and buttery, which is perfect with all the flavor of fresh cherries. My husband is allergic to corn, so I used potato starch, and added an extra tablespoon for more thickening. I also used vanilla extract instead of almond, since that's what I had. Thanks for the delicious pie!

This was my first time making a pie of any sort and man was it easy and so so yummy. I'm not sure why everyones been bashing the pie crust recipe because we thought the consistency was fine. It didn't crumble and it tasted fine! However I only chilled it for 2 hours because I was impatient and it was getting late. The pie was pretty sweet so I might add a little less sugar next time but it was still so so delicious! This will be my go to cherry pie recipe from now on!

My daughter in college requested a homemade cherry pie when she came home last weekend.  I selected this recipe and cooked it for her.  Despite missing a step and forgetting to add the butter and extract in the final step, she raved over this pie.  It was NOT, as some have commented, too sweet.  In fact, it wasn't sweet ENOUGH on its own, but was perfect with a couple of scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Quite good, and I WILL make this again.

This was excellent! I took other viewer's advice from the Cherry Pie III on this site & came over to this one because it calls for more cherries in the pie which I agree makes a tremendous difference!!! Everyone raved about it & left none for the baker:( I am off to make another one for me!! TFS!

This was my time making first cherry pie and it came out fantastic! I topped it with a proper lattice crust, and used fresh sour cherries. Next time, I might experiment with a little less sugar, so that the tartness comes through a bit more.

Ok,  I make pies all the time.  I am not a novice, but I really messed something up on this one.  I measured my cherries by weighing them (after pitting).  I used 2 pounds, which actually measured out to between 4 and 5 cups.  I used a different crust because I like my crust better.  I forget to add the butter, so I dotted it on top.  However, the pie was like soup.  The filling thickened perfectly on the the stove top.  But out of the oven it was like I had poured cherries and juice into the crust.  It tasted yummy.  The only thing I can think of was that while pitting the cherries, we lost power for about 7 hours causing me to put off finishing the pie for almost 24 hours.  I put the cherries in the fridge and didn't add anything to them until I was ready to actually make the pie.   I don't know if they sat to long?  Crazy.  I will try again, but maybe add a lot more cornstarch and remember to add the butter in.  However, that shouldn't make a difference in the chemistry.  Any ideas?***Edit*** Well, I cooled it in the refrigerator overnight.  That caused it to gel and set up.  I've never had to cool a pie completely before cutting.  This one seems to require it.

This pie filling is awesome! I can't speak for the crust because we used my mom's recipe. I made this pie for Easter and wasn't able to find fresh cherries anywhere. I substituted 3 cans of tart cherries packed in water, and also added the juice from about 1/2 a lemon. It was fantastic and everyone loved it!

Cherry Pie has always been a problem for me since it is often sour and runny. This is the only recipe I make now. It always tastes great with the right consistency.

Yum! My 9 year-old daughter scraped every last bit of cherry off her plate. It was that good! I opted for vanilla instead of almond extract and stirred in an extra tablespoon of butter. Oh, and I added a dash of salt. I'll make it the same way next time. Delicious!

After having read the reviews I used a crust recipe that I already had.   I loved the flavor of this filling.  it was spectacular.  However, the 4 star rating comes from the fact that even though I made it twice it did not gel properly.  I used fresh, dark cherries.  I am not sure if the water content is higher in those vs. the sour cherries but it was just soupy.  Delicious, but soupy. It was so good that I will try it again with a little bit more cornstarch and hope for the best!

This pie was great, but I was disappointed because I couldn't find any sour cherries.  I used sweet red cherries and left out some of the sugar.  Everybody loved it, but I want to make it with sour cherries.

Didn't use the crust due to reviews & didn't think the almond was necessary. I used fresh sweet cherries, so cut sugar to about 3/4 cup. The mix set up nicely, filled my pie pan & tasted delish once cooled. Will use again.

Wasn't sure how many cherries made 2 lbs., so used what I had which was 8 cups after they were pitted and sliced - turned out great with no other change to filling recipe.  Based upon other reviews I did not make the crust, used frozen deep-dish pie shells, one for top and one for bottom.  My husband, who is not a cherry pie fan, said it was the perfect blend of sweet and tart. Thank you Beth for a great filling recipe.

Wow!  Perfect cherry pie!  I followed the filling part and found it to be right on in terms of sweetness and thickness.  I am lucky in that sour cherries are at their peak right now, so I used one kilo of fresh cherries.  I added the almond extract and thought I had made a big mistake; it was so "extract-y" tasting, but luckily, it all combined lovely once it baked and the true sour cherry flavor came through.  I used the recipe for "Butter Flaky Pie Crust" from this sight instead of the one listed for this recipe (personal preference) and even made a lattice top!  It was beautiful and tasted as good as it looked.  I am truly happy with this recipe and it made my 11-year old super happy on his last day of school before summer break!  Thank you, Kenan!

Yum!  I used approximately five cups of Oregon brand red tart cherries in water (drained before using, of course), ¾ c. sugar, and added 1 t. lemon juice, ¼ t. salt and a dash of cinnamon along with the butter.  I baked it for 45 minutes and used the Ruth’s Grandma’s Pie Crust recipe from this site.  I made this pie for my dad’s birthday and will be making it again for my fiancé.

Yummy. I used half sweet and half sour cherries since that was what I happened to have. I was afraid the filling would be too sweet with the sweet cherries so I cut down the sugar a bit. Would like to make the recipe exactly but I have a hard time finding good sour cherries around here.

This was easy to make, my first pie from scratch.  I cut out a tiny bit of sugar and I should not have.  That extra 1/4 cup of sugar would have made it just sweet enough.
My crust was yummy too.  I would make this again.
I used freshed cherries.

Definitely a five star filling - I used a premade store bought crust, so I can't comment on the crust recipe.  I also used sweet cherries since I couldn't find sour ones and ended up using just 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 and 1/8 like it calls for since my cherries were already sweet.  It came out superbly, and was pretty easy to make as well. I will definitely be saving this recipe for cherry pies in the future!

So this was the first cherry pie I have ever made. It was super easy, especially because I cheated and used a frozen pastry sheet. I did however pit the cherries myself with help from my husband.It was D-LISH! My husband loves cherries, and he loves this pie! I am going to make it again later this week I am sure. Thanks!

This was my first time making cherry pie and this is by FAR the best and easiest pie I’ve ever made. I followed the directions carefully and came out with a perfect filling and crust! 

While I wasn’t sure of what cherries to use, I grabbed some fresh bags from the grocery store myself, pitted them, and finally weighed the cherries to equal 2 pounds. 

I’ve seen reviews of people not cooking down the cherries in a sauce pan. I highly suggest you do if you are buying them fresh and can’t find the ripest cherries. It will help immensely. 

Additionally I’ve noticed others use their own crust recipe or weren’t a fan of the crust recipe available. The original crust was really simple to make, and while it may not have had much to it I thought it didn’t detract anything from the filling itself. I also did an egg wash and sprinkled sugar for additional sweetness. 

Overall I can say I’m really happy with how the pie turned out and can’t wait to make it again! My boyfriend and I couldn’t help ourselves but to dig in before the pie was fully cooled.

This is honestly the ultimate cherry pie recipe. I followed the recipe, but used sweet cherries instead and cut the sugar down. I also added some lemon juice. I didn't use almond extract because I'm allergic to almonds. I also forgot to add butter near the end, but the pie turned out fine. I added an egg wash as well. And instead of its pie crust, I used my own. The pie turned out perfect! The cherries gelled quite nicely. The extra heat near the beginning added some charred bits to the pie, which added to the appearance, and for some reason this is the only pie I've ever made where the pie crust actually turned golden brown instead of remaining white and dry. I will probably use the idea of having a higher temperature near the beginning in my future pies.

I tried this and while the flavor was great, I could not get the filling to gel up. A runny pie is not my thing.  I'm feeling frustrated, and will give it another go tomorrow.

Was just amazing! It's very time consuming to pick, pit and then make a pie. So I broke up the process by picking and pitting and cooking one day. Put the cherries in the fridge. The next day prepared the crust and poured in the cherries. It worked!

The first time I made it I add 4tbs because I had frozen cherries, the second time I didn't have enough cherries so we added blueberries.  Very good pie! Yes, I'll be making it again. The pie really should be cool or chilled before serving so that the filling can set. Both time I've made it I have made it soon enough to have it chill & filling runs when you serve it, but next day after give time to set and chill for left overs it does not.

I made this and really enjoyed the taste of the filling. I used my own crust recipe. I used fresh sour cherries. But I the filling didn’t thicken. When I cut into it the filling ran. It tasted great but I’ll try adding more cornstarch next time.

This is the best cherry pie recipe I have ever tried.  Cooking the cherries in advance is the key I think.

Great recipe! If you can't find sour cherries, just just add butter and almond extract to hot canned pie filling - using sweet cherries in a pie is an insult to sweet cherries and to pie. Tart cherry pie with vanilla ice cream will change your life.

I used my own tried and true and familiar pie crust recipe which I use lard in.  It is very similar to this one though.  I put in 1/4 cup cornstarch (easier to measure).  I buy fresh pitted cherries and freeze them.  The old method I always used made a pie you might have to drink and over-browned the crust.  That is why I decided to try this one.  I put in the almond extract, but I will probably omit that the next time.  My whole house smelled like almond and overpowers the cherry taste.  I sometimes use cinnamon with cherries, but think they don't really need improved on.

Pretty perfect. I left out the almond extract. Be patient and wait for the gastronomy gods to pull out the juices. Heat helps, so go ahead and turn on the stove before there's liquid, but not while sugar is dry.

This pie was AMAZING. I didn't use the crust recipe though, I had a different one. I also added a vanilla bean. Was so mad that everyone liked it so much, because I definitely could have ate that whole pie myself!

The flavor of the filling is very, very good.  I used 3 cans of tart red cherries and next time will use 4.  I thought the filling could have been a little thicker, but I did make one error when making up the pie so that could have been the problem.  I did not use the pie crust with the recipe as I have my own pie crust recipe that I always use. I felt the amount of sugar was exactly right for 3 cans of cherries, when I measured it was just a tad over 5 cups.

I used 2 cans of canned cherries and gluten free flour for the crust, and this turned out amazing! Added a little dab of butter and almond extract to the cherries before baking. Delicious!

I use Ruth's Grammas Crust from this site for all of my crust, so the 5 star rating is really on the filling. I used the Kirkland 3 cherry blend frozen cherries since they are out of season, and this pie is best cherry pie I've ever tasted. We have several pie plates/pans, and even the "deep" dish can hold different quantities. I had to use 3 pounds of frozen cherries because this filling doesn't increase in size like some pies, and kept the other ingredients the same quantity.

I have made this recipe quite a few times. I have used both canned and frozen tart pie cherries. I use four 16 oz. cans of cherries, drained or four lbs. frozen cherries, thawed. I mix the sugar and cornstarch together and then stir the cherries into that mixture.  I let that all stand together while I get my crusts together. I stir in the almond extract and then fill my shell.  The butter is added and then the top crust. I do not precook any of the filling before baking at the suggested temperatures and times.  This is my favorite cherry pie recipe!

Fantastic recipe. I didn't make my own crust but used the Tenderflake Deep Dish pie shell, one for the bottom and one for the top. I thought the amount of cherries would be too much so used 1 1/2 lbs, cut the sugar to 1 cup and the cornstarch to 2 1/2 tbsp and it filled the shell perfectly. Shared my first harvest of cherries and will definitely make this pie again.

This is the best sour cherry pie ever!!  This year (2016) my sour cherry tree was very generous - picked at least 25 pounds of sour cherries.  Thank goodness for this recipes.   I did not make the dough - I bought it ready made.  It's a lot easier, but I won't let that affect my 5-star rating.  Deeeeelicious.

This is what I think of, when I think of cherry pie.  I was a little uneasy about the crust, at first.  It was nearly soggy after mixing it together and I even left it uncovered in the fridge to chill, hoping some of the water would evaporate off; I so thought I'd have a sticky mess when it came to roll.  This ended up being THE pie crust I've been looking for.  Is it a little bland?  Yes, but it so totally works by not upstaging that incredible cherry filling.  This will be my go to recipe for pie crust from now on.  I did add a heaping spoon of sugar to the flour for the crust and might experiment with subbing butter for some of the shortening, but I am really in love with this crust; I've never had one easier to roll or handle and come out with such great flakiness.  And the pie filling!  I did sub half of the sugar with honey, cooking the cherries with a half cup of sugar and adding the half cup honey after I removed the pan from the heat.  I was a little concerned that the honey would make the filling too watery, so added another teaspoon of cornstarch.  I also used the 1/8C sugar on the bottom crust with 1T flour before pouring in the filling, as suggested by another reviewer.  No worries there, it came out perfect.  This pie is so amazing I want to stop people on the street and have them try it.  Or eat it all myself.

Picked fresh cherries yesterday, pitted them and added  about 1/4 c sugar, then refrigerated over night.  Today I found this recipe and gave it a try.  The pie is DELICIOUS!  No problems getting it to jell at all.  The author does say to "Stir Constantly" that is the trick.  This is a must do when making jelly as well.  Stirring allows the moisture to escape leaving perfectly jellied fruit.  Yum 2 thumbs up

I followed this recipe with 3 changes. I used regular cherries. I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and the pie was still plenty sweet. I didn't use any almond extract and I didn't miss it.

I think this pie filling was OK. I like sweet taste but not too sweet. It is better to adjust the sugar to taste when adding it to the cherries. I will try it again but will adjust the sugar better and review it again.

I use my own pie crust recipe but the cherry filling recipe for this is great.  I did make some alterations to it as other have.  I used 2-1 lb. bags of frozen cherries and used a little extra cornstarch just as another reviewer suggested.  However, I took out about a third of the sugar.  It was a little sweet for my family's taste.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This cherry pie recipe turned out awesome!  I used store bought pie crust because I just never have good luck making pie dough.  I picked the cherries from the orchard my grandmother planted. I omitted the butter (for diet reasons) and I completely forgot the almond extract.  My 88 year old Dad said it was the best cherry pie ever and he said it was even better than his Aunt Margret's and she made everything from scratch including grinding the flour and rendering lard. So I feel like a pie-making champ because Dad loved the pie. I give credit to the fresh-from-the-farm pie cherries.

Loved it and so did my fiancé's family. This was the first time making a cherry pie. Due to the other recommendations here I used another pie crust. The other modifications I did was use fresh dark sweet cherries and it was not too sweet. I used an entire bag from the produce section which was roughly 3 cups. It could have used more but it was the perfect filling to crust ratio for me. It also took longer in the oven to cook, roughly 15-20 mins more for my oven. Would definitely make again! Great summer pie!

The only thing I changed was the sugar amount which is just a personal preference. My husband is Russian and he and all our Russian guests eat sour cherries off the tree and think of their childhood. I knew I could get away with much less sugar for this particular audience.  It was devoured, plates scraped, seconds had.  Success.  Thanks!

*GREAT* recipe!! I realized I didn't have enough cherries, but my roommate had some extra frozen berries so for the last about 1/4 cup we used that. It overflowed a bit in the oven but I think that's because I didn't seal it properly. (Thankfully I was making something on a baking tray underneath with the leftover pie crust and it didn't coat the bottom of the oven!) 

My roommate made some fresh whipped cream with some leftover whipping cream we had.. It was marvelous. Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  The first time I made it I cooked the filling on the stove as the recipe directs and it was great.  The second time I tried not cooking the filling prior to adding it to the crust as a couple of other reviewers suggested, but it didn't work for me at all.  It turned out like a big soupy mess.  Will definitely cook the filling from now on.

The filling is five stars for sure, but pass on the pie crust. Instead, surround this delicious cherry filling with the following pie crust recipe also from this site: Easy Homemade Pie Crust by Chef John. It is THE best pie crust you will every make and will complement this scrumptious cherry pie filling beautifully.

Made this pie filling exactly as written, except I used my own crust. This pie was a hit, gone in seconds! I used 3 bags of frozen cherries because fresh we're not in season. HUGE hit!

This was our first cherry pie we have ever made, and we were overall very pleased. We used a different pie crust recipe, but it was very similar to the one above. The key is to make sure your butter or shortening and water are very cold and make sure you add the water a table spoon or two at a time, and stop adding the water when your dough is coming together. The cherry filling was delicious. I gave it plenty of time to simmer and cool on the stove and it was not too runny at all. We used frozen tart cherries because that is all we could find in the grocery store, drained some of the juice, and they worked perfectly. They ended up tasting very similar to canned cherries but I would like to think they were superior. The only downside to this recipe was the cost, the frozen cherries for one pie were about $8, but it was worth doing homemade in the end and we are going to try make it with fresh cherries when they are in season and try it again. But overall, very good and very pleased!

Perfect, one of the best pies I have made. Loved Loved Loved it. I used canned tart cherries as fresh cherries are out of season and besides that A LOT of work. Canned cherries work good for me and this is the perfect recipe. I drained the cherries and then followed the recipe from there on out. This will be a staple for holiday meals at our house as quite honestly that is the only time I usually make pie. My husbands favorite pie is cherry and i have been looking for a good recipe and this fits the bill.

I used my gram's old crust recipe, but this filling and it was AMAZING! the pot was a little hard to clean, so make sure to use a non-stick pot.
I used mainly dark cherries and a little more sugar since I made it for a three year old (The Hello Kitty pie) 

it was so yummy

Pie shell pastry was super easy to make. I'm terrible with pastry and my pie turned out looking like I had some clue what I'm doing. The filling was great with the corn starch. I used only a cup of brown sugar and didn't have any almond extract, but my boyfriend and friends absolutely loved this pie. I'm keeping this recipe!

I really wanted to give this a five star rating, but since I don't use the crust recipe I didnt think it would be fair. The filling is 5 star quality for sure! Cherry pie is my husband's favorite and after 16 years, I'm finally able to make it for him. He's even told me he likes this pie better than his mom's and that's saying something.

This was my first cherry pie ever! I always get mine at the pie company, and it's always outrageous! I wanted a pie simular to the pie co. While this pie isn't exactly the same I think it's better! Not too sweet. This is now my pie recipe i'll be using. Love it! Thanks!

This was a great pie! Sour cherry is my favourite and luckily, a local farm market had pie cherries on sale, so I didn't even need to pit them! I used about 3/4 cup of sugar and 4 Tbsp of cornstarch based on the taste and consistency of the cherries/juice that I had. My family loves this and luckily, I have more cherries in my freezer for another one soon! Oh, I happened to have a pre-made crust available to use, otherwise I always use the Crisco pie crust recipe. Thanks for sharing this - it's a keeper for me!

This is the first pie I baked since I was in my early teens (now 29!), and the first cherry pie I've ever baked.  It was DELICIOUS!  I used a different pastry recipe though, per some of the reviews.  I also substituted almond extract for vanilla extract and increased to 1 tsp.  I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Sounds weird, but my husband couldn't stop eating the pie :)    I would definately make this again.

This pie was amazing!!! I was a little short on cherries as I had to pick out a few bad ones from my bunch so I had some extra leftover dough. I also only used 1 cup of white sugar and still found it to be slightly too sweet for my taste - that would be my only change for next time...a bit less sugar. My BF said it was the best pie he's ever had though!

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe! It was the first pie I ever tried to make completely from scratch and talk about nailing it. I have to make a special mention of the crust. It comes out perfect every time. I've used it for this cheery pie, for an apple, and for a berries, and it's always perfectly flaky with the right amount of crunch and never gooey. My father is an excellent cook, and he's very hard to please, but every time I use this recipe, he goes on about how well the crust comes out. This pie never lasts long in my house! All in all, great recipe, one that I will continue to use.

Wonderful flavor and not runny at all!  I used 3 cans of tart cherries and it was the perfect blend of tart and sweet.  I used the Baker's Secret pie crust, which I use for all my pies now and get rave reviews on it also.

This pie turned out excellent! I had some frozen fresh sour cherries and I drained the juice into a sauce pan added the sugar & cornstarch then the cherries and cooked it till thick, then baked it in the oven and VIOLA! Cherry pie! I did cheat with the pie crust and bought a dairy case ready crust to save time. I will do this again with other fruits! Thanks! A++

Made this pie for my dad's birthday. He said he'd never had a better one in all his 64 years. LOVED(!!) this pie filling idea, as I don't like canned cherry pie filling that is full of red dye and high fructose corn syrup! Gave it 5 stars for filling taste/texture. However, I used my own crust recipe of 2C flour, 1tsp salt, 1C frozen, shredded unsalted butter and 1/2 C very cold heavy cream. With this pie filling and my own crust recipe this is an OUTSTANDING dessert! Thanks for being willing to share with us, Beth!! :o)

This pie rocks! My boyfriend's mom makes the best pies, so I had some stiff competition our first Christmas together. This pie blew anything he had eaten before out of the water. While we liked how sweet it was, some of you may want to use slightly less sugar if that's not your thing. Oh, skip the crust. I bought one at the store and just glazed it with egg whites and sugar.

I didn't have almond extract so I used brandy extract and it was great. Pitted fresh bing cherries (won't work that hard again).  Great Pie!!! Also, this is one of the easiest crusts I'v ever made but I'd recommend a little more salt, that's it, thanks for sharing.

The recipe for the filling was perfect. We even used the same one for a peach pie filling. We didn't make this crust recipe after reading the other reviews, but we made Grandma Ruth's from this website.

****DO NOT make this crust******* The filling is superb, and deserves 5 stars.  But the crust is just awful, and deserves not only a '1' star, but negative -5 stars, if that were possible.  It is impossible to work with and makes what is usually (for me at least) a joy to bake pies a very, very frustrating experience.  Because I had no more crisco or even butter, and not enough time before my 4th of July bbq to make another crust, I ended up actually mashing the darn dough that crumbled to the touch directly INTO the pie pan, and doing a crumble on top.  It in turn completely crumbled when served.  The cherry filling was delicious.  But it wasn't 'Pie', as it had no form whatsoever.  I think the submitter made a mistake in writing the recipe or something, because there is no way the pie in that picture could have been made with a workable crust.  So frustrating.

I used premade Pillsbury pie crust. My husband told me after I made it that he didn't like cherry pie. But then he tried it. He said it was the best pie he had ever eaten! I think this ones a keeper!

OUTSTANDING!  I had recently made an awful cherry pie and was on the hunt for a winning recipe and found this one!  It's best to make it a day ahead so that the cherry gel sets well.  I cut into it today and the filling stayed in place, not like the other recipe I used where the cherries rolled around like marbles in an ocean of juice.  Going based on the other reviews, I made my own crust which is "no fail," so here it is:  10" Two-Crust Pie Pastry 1 cup butter 2-2/3 cups flour 1 tsp salt 10 tablespoons cold water  Cut shortening into flour and salt until particles are size of small peas.  Add water and toss dough with fork until all flour is moistened.  Roll into two balls on floured surface.  AWESOME RECIPE AND MY FAMILY LOVED IT!

This was so simple and SO good! We used fresh sour cherries from our neighbours tree and it was absolutely the best cherry pie I've ever tasted!!!
