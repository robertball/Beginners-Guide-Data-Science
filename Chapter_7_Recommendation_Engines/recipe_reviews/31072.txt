I came across this recipe quite by accident.  Delicious, moist, I mean almost to die for.  It is simple and quick to prepare.  I always try to make a recipe exactly as stated first so I can fairly judge it.  I tried this with out added bluecheese.  It is
mild and delicious.  Even my non bluecheese eaters loved the gravy.  For those of us who like a bit more bluecheese I added more and it also was excellent.  I love gravies made with whipping cream.  I however can not afford the calories on a regular basis as they tend to go to my hips.
The next time I make this I will make
the gravie with nonfat half-n-half, nonfat canned milk, or nonfat milk.  When I use nonfat milk in place of whipping cream or half-n-half I add 1
tablespoon of cornstarch for thickening per cup of liqued.  I will
also use olive-oil in place of butter.
I like some of the other reviewers sauteed mushrooms and served them on the side.  I will be making this again soon with a nice cut of steak.  I know it will be a hit too!  Thanxs Toni for an excellent recipe.  It is a keeper for sure and I will use it again and again.  This recipe is well worth trying!

This was very good.  I substituted the 1 cup of whipping cream and 2oz. blue cheese with 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup blue cheese dressing.  Turned out great!

This was very tasty.  I took some suggestions from other people and made a couple of changes.  I cooked some mushrooms along with the pork chops (put them in towards the end.)  I seasoned the chops with Nature's Seasoning Blend and cayenne pepper.  I also used 4 oz. of blue cheese instead of 2.  I served this over linguine .  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Excellent recipe.  The gravy was very tasty - you must enjoy blue cheese, of course.  I added about a tablespoon of flour to help the gravy thicken.  Very fast and simple to prepare.  I served it with rice and green beans.  I'm already looking forward to the leftovers!

Great recipe - super simple, and the gravy was deliciously different (you must enjoy bleu cheese, though).  Simple enough to whip up after a long, hard day at work.  Had a gourmet flair.
Thanks for sharing it!

I served this to my husband and we both loved it!  We decided to grill the pork chops and then add the gravy.  I also used about a teaspoon of corn starch to thicken the gravy just a little.  I'll definately make this again!

This was wonderful.  I used Stilton instead of bleu cheese and it had a wonderful creamy texture. I used a few sauted mushrooms and served it with roasted Parisienne potatoes and steamed broccoli.  My husband said it was a definite "do again"!  The sauce would be nice on linguine with a nice piece of herbed salmon....many uses for this sauce recipe.  Also, no corn starch etc is necessary if you simmer the sauce for the full 5 minutes to reduce it.

This recipe is great if you are on the Adkins Diet, but it is not one of the taste sensations of the century!  I will make it again, but next time I will add chopped fried onions and sprinkle crumbled bacon over the top of the chops for added flavour.  My husband liked the taste and is keen because the recipe is on his diet.

I tried this tonight.  It turned out pretty good.  It was very easy to make.  The gravy is really rich; it would be good served with some crusty bread for dipping.

we love this recipe! It is quick & easy after a full day of work.  We are big fans of blue cheese so I always use a whole 4oz container instead of just 2.

Loved this. I did edit the recipe, but WOW. FIRST difference was I did dredge my chops in flour and shook off any excess. I had seasoned my flour with onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper. I salted the chops just a bit before dredging in the flour as well. I put PLENTY of butter in the skillet, and sauteed 2 cloves of garlic prior to throwing in the chops. DON'T be afraid to cook those chopes JUST 3-4 minutes on 1 side, flip and repeat and youre done!! Then cover those babies with some foil and set them aside. they will be PERFECT! Next, I threw in a good amount of mushrooms right into the pan I just used for the chops. I gave several liberal shakes of worcestershire to cover the shrooms. Sauteed them for about 10 minutes until they were getting nice and soft and the worcestershire sauce reduced a good bit. Oh - and I added a splash of white wine to the mushrooms as well, so I let that cook off a bit. THEN, I eyeballed my heavy cream and my blue cheese. I stirred, let it simmer for a bit, stirred a whole lot more (and taste tested repeatedly..) - then covered with a lid. It probably simmered about 10 minutes or so. All I can say is WOW. The gravy MADE the pork chops just phenomenal!! yum, yum! We had oven-baked potatoes with chives, sour cream, cheese, bacon bits as a side. A fantastic, comfort-food meal that will for SURE be repeated in the near future. MAKE THIS NOW!

This is an awesome recipe for blue cheese lovers. I'm not a big fan of pork chops, but the hubby likes them. I saute some onions in the butter before putting well seasoned chops in the pan. Deglaze those good bits. I don't use the heavy whipping cream, but use nonfat sour cream, a container of stella blue cheese crumbles, some bottled blue cheese dressing and sliced mushrooms. I serve it with rice and broccoli. Watch the family clean their plates!

This was fantastic!  I made this AS IS and it was just wonderful.  So many people review a recipe that they've altered in some way.  Although their alterations may be wonderful as well, I don't feel it's fair, nor helpful, to review a recipe that you've changed.

Wonderful recipe!  Topped the chops with sauteed mushrooms/garlic, served the Blue Cheese Gravy on the side (daughters not crazy about bleu cheese).  I didn't have whipping cream on hand, so I subbed sour cream and a little milk - the gravy was smooth and delicious.  Served with Garlic Mashed Sweet Potatoes from this site, and sauteed brussels sprouts. What a terrific flavor combo.  Thank you Toni for a great recipe; it's a keeper for sure!

YUM . . . . I skipped the garlic powder & sautéed 1 T freshly minced garlic in the butter until it was just fragrant and used 4 oz (+/-) of blue cheese with 1 C half & half. It took perhaps 15 minutes of simmering to achieve a good consistency, but it was a grand slam. And to think I didn't like pork chops . . . . This recipe is a keeper, fer sure. The sauce was even more tasty the second day; the next time I make this, I will cook the gravy a day ahead. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

This recipe smelled great and looked good too, however, the taste was definitely not my cup of tea.  If you like bleu cheese, then you'll like this recipe.  The taste of the cheese was too strong for the gravy.  I really liked the pork chop flavor, but the gravy ruined it.

I would have given this recipe 10 stars if I could have!!

It was so simple and easy to make! The flavor was amazing and everything turned out just right. I served it with sauteed mushrooms with garlic and mashed potatoes (made from the box). 

I will definitely be making this again and again. Thanks, Toni. :)

I'm biased, Love Pork and Love Blue Cheese, even saying blue cheese could probably make liver taste good, thou not really willing to test that theory. Very simple ingredients all worked to make this a superior entree. I served with caramelized red onions and shallots, lemon orzo, and roasted garlic cauliflower.

THIS IS AWESOME.... I changed this a bit, on the pork chops I marinated them with soy sauce and wor. sauce for about an hour.  Then I cooked them in a pan with a tad of EVOO.  Added the whipping cream and blue cheese and garlic.  DIVINE!  I took leftovers to work the next day and couldnt get enough.  Flavor was wonderfully strong and delicious

Very nice flavor.  I used low fat milk instead of whipping cream to make it a little lighter.  The resulting sauce was a little runny but it didn't affect the taste in my opinion.  Make sure you use a really good quality blue cheese.

This is one of the easiest and most dellicious recipes I've ever tried!! Here's a tip: cook your pork chops in a cast iron skillet and then use the same skillet for the sauce. Because the skillet stays so hot, the cream will thicken very, very quickly!

This recipe is AWESOME!  So easy to make and with only a handful of ingredients.  In place of the garlic powder and black pepper, I used McCormick's California Style Garlic Pepper with red bell and black pepper.  I covered the chops while they were cooking.  I ended up with tender, juicy, flavorful pork chops topped with mouthwatering blue cheese gravy that exploded in your mouth.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Toni.  I'll be making these often.

This is one of the best, easiest recipes I have every had. My husband flipped over the great taste. I added just a little more Blue Cheese, since the container was a four oz container, just use it. I also took this recipe into work and 1 of the gals made it with Chicken Breast, said it was amazing!!!!!

This makes an awesome gravy.  I added a little flour to make the sauce thicker.  I could have added a little more blue cheese myself, but for those who aren't as big a fan of blue cheese as I, the flavor wasn't too strong.  I cooked my pork chops according to this sites,
"Roast Pork Loin Chop" recipe, and they turned out very moist.  I will definately make again.

This turned out really good. It was a little too salty for me, so next time I might try using garlic in olive oil so saute the pork instead of butter and garlic powder. I also added a little bit of flour to thicken the sauce and more blue cheese. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

This was delicious!  I used stilton instead of blue cheese.  Also, any drippings that accumulated under the set aside pork chops, I added to the gravy as it was thickening.  Enjoy!

This is a great go-to recipe on nights where you'd like something comforting and different. I have always fried my porkchops like this, so the taste of the chops themselves was no real surprise. However, the addition of bleu cheese to the pan sauce was a delicious alternative. This is a "pan sauce" and not truly a "gravy" per se', but semantics aside, it is a delicious and wonderful dinner and easily something impressive for guests! I added a bit of salt to the mix of seasonings, but that's just my thing. It's great served with some asparagus and crusty bread. A high 5 for the originator goes out on this one!

This recipe is really good....  I did as another reviewer suggested and cooked some bacon, fried the pork chops in the bacon grease with a bit of butter, and then added the bacon pieces into the gravy... Definately restaurant quality....  I served with boiled red potatoes and garlic bread....

Let's put it this way...I have made a few items from this site and I have never taken the time to review one of the receipes. This was WONDERFUL. I took one reviewer's suggestion and coated the pork chops with flour,salt,pepper, and garlic salt. The cooking time on the chops were half the time suggested (my chops were a bit thinner). I also added a tad more blue cheese then what the recipe called for. YUM YUM YUM! My husband loved it. We will make this again.

This was excellent.  The dressing is also very good on mashed potatoes.

My family said it was the best meal yet! I served it with wide egg noodles, covered with sauteed mushrooms, onions, zucchini and yellow squash. Also, I followed the directions of a previous rater and used blue cheese salad dressing and milk- not as strong as the recipe called for, but still had a nice "tang."

One of the top three recipes I have ever made from this site (and I make a lot). This was tremendous! I used four bonless thick chops (flattened them a bit) and added more heavy whipping cream and blue cheese. I had no problems with consistency whatsoever. Made mashed potatoes on the side and poured the gravy over everything. The flavor was great, great, great. And how simple to prepare. We plan on trying this next on filet mignon. I think it would be superb there as well.  Thank you for this superb dish.

This was totally AWESOME!!  Simple but elegant!  I just prepared this for dinner tonight and got rave reviews.  My boyfriend even went back for extra gravy!  :-D  The one small tweak I did, however, was used a portion of the heavy cream and mixed in a tablespoon of cornstarch to make the gravy a little thicker (I like thicker gravy).  Served with roasted new potatoes and the meal was fantastic.  This one is getting added to my recipe box for sure!  :-D

This was FINE!  My hubby is not a big fan of blue cheese, but even he had seconds!!  I sauted fresh garlic and canned mushroom slices in butter and added to top of chops and gravy.  Very fine!  Oh... I also didn't have cream, so I used evaporated milk and it worked.  Thanks for such a great, easy and impressive recipe!

This was excellent!  True--you need to be a lover of blue cheese to really appreciate the flavors of this dish.  I sauteed some fresh mushrooms and garlic in butter after removing the chops from the pan and before adding the cream and cheese.  The result was terrific...we spooned the mushrooms and sauce over a side of buttered egg noodles....yummy!  Not a dish for those who are counting their calories by any means but wonderful all the same!

This was very good and pretty easy too.  I was surprised that (besides my 2 year old) everyone liked this, including my two boys.  The chops alone were very tasty and juicy to boot.  But the sauce, the sauce was just awesome.  I'll admit, I was expecting the flavor to be a lot stronger, and sharp, but was surprised that it was perfectly balanced with just the right amount of blue cheese flavor.  It was delicious!  None of my kids liked the sauce, but that's alright, more for hubby and me. ;)

This is a perfect basic recipe to play around with. I browned my chops in a cast iron pan with alittle oil. Removed them and added alittle water to scrape the brown bits. Added 1/2 cup of milk and 3 big tablespoons of Philadelphia Cooking Cream (Savory Garlic Flavor) Blue Cheese and Cracked Black Pepper. Let it reduce till it was thick and yummy. Thanks for a great idea! It was lick your plate good :)

This was awesome!  So easy!  I used fat free milk and corn starch instead of whipping cream as others suggested.  No need to double the cheese.  I used low fat blue cheese.  This is a keeper.

OMG, this is SO good. Very simple, not many ingredients and oh so yummy. My family went crazy and it will become a permanent part of our menu. The sauce, (gravy), tastes straight out of a top notch restaurant. I am very impressed. I served this dish with roasted red potatoes and sauteed asparagus and mushrooms. Ah-mazing!

Delicious!  I only changed two things.  I used 1 cup of Half and Half, rather than the whipping cream, and I did not measure out the blue cheese.  I just added a handful or two of the crumbled blue cheese, because I was not sure how many ounces I had.  It came out fantastic!  I would definitely make this again!

I must give this 5 stars.  This was steakhouse worthy, however you must REALLY like blue cheese.  My boyfriend just "ooooo'd and ahhhh'd" throughout dinner.  Made exactly as stated but added fresh mushrooms.  You could easily add green peppers, onions, etc. - very easy to make.  Thank you for this "keeper!"

Big hit with my husband and I .  We love blue cheese.  The flavor is definitely a little milder because of the whipping cream.  However, if you don't like blue cheese you probably won't like this.  If you try it anyway, don't give it a low review because you don't like blue cheese.

Wonderful! These chops tasted like you spent hours preparing them, yet were so easy.I sauteed fresh mushrooms and onions in the pan while i was keeping the chops warm before adding the cream. I used 1 1/2 cups of cream, ( we like a lot of gravy) and 4 ounces of blue cheese

I added sauteed mushrooms & onions in the pan then added the whipping cream & blue cheese dressing. The Hubby said it was OK, I didn't like it , the blue cheese taste. I won't be making this blue cheese gravy again.

I was cautiously optimistic about this. My family loves Blue Cheese Burgers so I tohught we will tried it. It was great! I will definitly make this again. I did use 1% milk since I did not have half and half or cream. We did not missed any richness in the sauce.

This was wonderful!!!! I didn't have whipping cream or Blue Cheese, so I used light cream and Feta Cheese. It was so yummy that I ate all of my chop (I usually eat only 1/2, as I am not a pork lover), and then I was eyeing up my husband's... My husband said that he only wants pork chops done this way from now on.

I fried the pork chops as recommended by the Allrecipes site, in oil & butter, seasoned and floured.  What I really am reviewing is the blue cheese gravy.  Yum.  This was very rich and tasty.  I will make this again.   My husband really liked this combo.

Everyone seems to love this recipe - even me!  (I don't care for pork in general, and especially chops - usually too dry.)  We love blue cheese, so I add extra extra amounts.  Also, tried with both heavy cream and half&half - better with heavy, but h&h was good, too.

The gravy was pretty good, but the real winner here was the way the pork chops were cooked. Perfection. I'll never cook them another way again. Yum!

Pretty tasty, but I didn't give it 5 stars, because the blue cheese gravy was a little overwhelming, so I cut it with Feta cheese. Other than that...it was very good!

Nice change from my usual PC meal. Good flavor, very easy. Used half n half not whipping cream, increased the blue cheese, and added alittle hot sauce.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  I wish I could give it 20 stars!  I used thin boneless chops since it was all I had and seasoned them with pepper and garlic powder and then also dredged them in flour seasoned with pepper and garlic powder.  They only took about 10 or so minutes to cook...but that gravy is awesome!  It cooked up nice and thick and the blue cheese melts nicely into it and it is such an incredible flavor!  I love blue cheese ans sometimes I find blue cheese recipes have a very strong blue cheese flavor but this was perfect. My bf that doesn't like pork chops, agreed that this was great.  It's something you could serve to dinner guests...I would love to try it on a steak!  Thanks so much for this recipe, I will be making it over and over and over again!

I floured my pork chops just a little bit.  I used all purpose flour added some pepper, garlic salt and Lawrys seasoned salt; mixed all that togther then lightly coated the pork chops.  Other than that I kept everything else the same.  This is a really tasty recipe!

Delicious! Husband normally hates bleu cheese. I didn't tell him there was any in the gravy, and he practically slurped it up!:P
Few changes I made: 1) I doubled the amount of bleu cheese from 2 oz. to 4 oz. Even if you are not a big bleu cheese lover like me, 4 oz. is still not overpowering, but enough to add some kick. 2) Instead of using garlic powder and butter, I sauteed the pork chops in olive oil, salt and pepper, onions, garlic, and mushrooms. YUM! I think that just enhanced the sauce that much more! It made plenty of gravy, we poured on our mashed potatoes and dipped our bread in it. Definitely a meal I would make for company.

Simple and rich.  No reason not to give this 5 stars.  Make sure you thicken the sauce and you can use it with chicken, salad or whatever you wish.  I had a busy day, so I turned to this one to please the family.  Did the trick.  I added just a little extra blue cheese so I could call it a sinful, then sprinkled some more on top.

Let me just say from the start...I used FETA instead of blue cheese, and Half & Half instead of whipping cream...and it was great.  I also used it on chicken breasts...and it was great.  A little sauteed garlic and onion was tasty too.  Next time I'll add some other vegetables of choice.

After Tony got over the idea that I was trying to kill him when he saw the blue cheese as I was adding it he loved it, I enjoyed it as well, very different, tangy and delicious!  I did add minced garlic to my olive oil/butter to fry the chops at first.

I'm not a big fan of blue cheese but wanted something different.  The amount of blue cheese was just right, it was not too strong. It was very easy to make too. I will make this again.

This recipe is excellent! The blue cheese gravy is the best part! I heaped sauteed mushrooms on top of the pork chops and poured the sauce over it. Appealing to look at and the combination of the flavors was wonderful! This would also be good with chicken and mushrooms.  Thanks!

YES! This is a keeper. I made it for dinner this evening and it turned out fantastic. Very easy and quick too. I added diced apples to the skillet while cooking the chops. (Hubby doesn't like mushrooms and I thought it would give a little different twist.) We'll definitely be having this again. YUM!

Very tasty. I controlled the amount of Blue Cheese flavor by adding the cheese slowly while the sauce thickened. Also, I sauteed some mushrooms separately with butter and garlic and then spooned them on top of the sauce over the pork chops. Served with garlic green beans and toasted baguettes. Delicious!

I tried this as it fit into my Adkins plan.  It was great, but I added a tsp of chopped garlic with the cream, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and 1/4 cup sour cream just as I took it off the heat. It had a mild bite but was just right for us.

I made this last night because I had some left over blue cheese and found this recipe that sounded interesting.  I don't like blue cheese but this was actually very good.  Hubby even raved and went back for more.  I didn't have heavy cream so I browned a little flour in the butter, added some half and half and then the blue cheese.  My 9 year old said "it wasn't too bad" and from him, that is a compliment.  Great and easy.

This was so simple and absolutely delicious.  I seasoned my pork chops with Penzey's spice blend of Bouquet Garni (thyme, rosemary, savory, tarragon, oregano, sage, etc.), and it made the gravy have a wonderful herbal flavor.  I opted to deglaze the pan with approx 1/2 cup of dry white wine before adding the half and half/ blue cheese, which really brought it to the next tasty level.  I honestly don't think the cream is necessary (half and half worked just as well, just needed to thicken it slightly longer).  This gravy would be amazing on other dishes including chicken, grilled steak, or even roasted red potatoes; we often serve a simple side dish of buttered dill egg noodles which is a great compliment.

Excellent. My husband and our houseguest raved about it. I served it with roasted Broccoli and roasted new potatoes. I used FF Half/Half instead of the Whipping Cream and it was perfect. This was my first time cooking Pork Chops and they turned out delicious!

I sliced the pork chops in half to make them thinner and cook faster. I added mozzrella and low fat chedder cheese (just a bit) to the sauce. It tasted so good. The sauce really made it. I also added cooked mushrooms for my husbands plate. This is a very yummy dish and i will make it again.

As unhealthy as this is, it is by far my favorite pork chop recipe.  I tend to use about 3/4 cup low fat milk instead of 1 cup cream, and about twice as much blue cheese.  Great with potatoes too!

My husband loved this! I did things a little differently though - took other's prior advise, as well. What my husband and I hate the MOST are dry pork chops, which is why I don't really cook them for dinner, but I figured I would try THIS recipe because the chops were paired with a blue cheese gravy - which was delicious! :) To help prevent the chops from dry out I actually wrapped them in bacon, sprinkled a nice layer of grill seasoning on them, and threw them on the grill. I grilled them until their temp was NO HIGHER than 157 degrees inside. While the pork chops were grilling I cooked up the gravy - for this I used 4 ounces of the blue cheese instead of 2 and sprinkled some corn starch in there for a thicker gravy. I served this dish with broccoli and a garden salad. MMMMMmmmm!

This was wonderful. We loved the gravy. I make pork chops covered so they come out more tender. These chops were 1 inch thick and I was impressed how tender they came out. I don't usually have such thick ones. The gravy was delicious. A taste of its own. I wonder why it came out so brown, though. When I need to make brown sauce/gravy it always turns out white. When I want white it always turns out browner. We'll be doing this one again!

I made this for my husband, and he just loves it! (So do I!)  Very easy, quick and delicious.  He suggested we try it with beef cube steaks sometime, too.  I did use garlic salt instead of garlic powder.

I'm only giving this four stars because my pork chops were not tender, even though I followed the recipe exactly.  They were thick boneless porkchops, and I cooked them over medium heat.  If anyone has any suggestions for how to cook pork chops so they are tender, I would greatly appreciate it.  The sauce was delicious and everyone enjoyed it...the only thing different was that I added mushrooms and a little extra bleu cheese.  YUM!

Delicious!  Family loved them.  Very easy recipe for after work meal.  I added a little chicken broth so the gravy would strech further for mashed potatoes.  Definitely would serve to the inlaws.

This was wonderful! It was very easy to follow and was a good meal to make for one.  I had more gravy than I needed, so I added in some green squash and carrots and they tasted great with the gravy.

This is different but in a good way.  I almost always serve with carmelized red onions.  I have also used it over some steaks, chicken, or burgers, and have stirred in crispy crumbled bacon or frozen green peas (or both).

this was just okay. i LOVE bleu cheese and so does my hubby. i used fat free half and half to make it less artery clogging, but then added crumbled bacon so i'm sure it didnt help too much haha! i used more bleu cheese too. dipped the chops in egg and coated in italian breadcrumbs before frying them up. pretty tasty, just wish the sauce had a little more.....something.....and i cant figure out what.

Absolutely loved this one. The sauce is out of this world. I will admit I used about 25% more bleu cheese than the recipe called for, and although I usually always follow the recipe verbatim the first time I prepare it, so many people said they liked it with mushroomsadded , I couldn't resist, and  sauteed 8 oz. of mushrooms in the drippings after I removed the chops, before adding the cream and cheese. We  both loved the sweet/sharp flavor. The sauce itself would also be terrific on chicken breasts, even steaks. Can't wait to make it again.

The recipe was very easy, very fast. I would suggest a strong blue cheese, and if pork is not your forté, I would use a steak.

I liked the blue cheese gravy, but the pork chops were just ok. All in all, it was a good recipe, but we expected to be impressed - we weren´t. I will use the sauce with pasta, or sliced chicken filets in the future. We served this with french fries.

This recipe was great.  I followed another readers recipe.  I substituted with 1/2 cup skim milk, 1/2 cup of blue cheese dressing and 2 ounces of crumbled blue cheese.  I served mine over wheat linguine.  Awesome!  I will make this again.

My husband was a bit skeptical at first but he really liked it. The kids on the other hand didn't like the blue cheese gravy at all. So with that said I'm going to rate it on what my husband thought instead of my picky kids.

We loved this sauce!  Instead of cooking the pork chops for 20-25 minutes in the skillet, I browned them on each side and finished cooking in the oven at 250 - for only the amount of time it took to make the sauce.  Sidenote:  the sauce did not heat up well the following day for leftovers - it separated.

Made this meal today for wife and myself. I must say that this is one of the most flavorful pork chop dinners I have ever had and I am not a huge blue cheese fan. However, the wife is. Followed the recipe verbatum and included the sauteed mushrooms. Both of our comments, "Exquisite".
Will make this again soon for dinner when company is over.

Very tasty!. My only change would be to double the Bleu cheese because I felt it was not "cheesy" enough.  Other than that, beside it being a heart attack on a plate, it was wonderful.

Yum!  What a nice gravy for pork chops!  I added a pinch of flour to the cream to help thicken it up a little bit.  Then, I served it with egg noodles and steamed broccoli.  What a nice dinner!

Quick & easy---very good.  I used thin cut pork chops & gorgonzola cheese as that is what I had on hand.  I agree with a previous reviewer, would be very good with beef.  Husband loved it and is already asking for it again!

This was delish!  I didn't have cream and used milk and it worked just fine.  Made a great sauce.  Thanks for sharing.

I modified the recipe slightly, but over all this is great.  First I fried bacon (about 2 slices per chop) as some had suggested.  I then fried up the pork chops in the bacon grease (I know, not the healthiest meal, but its worth it every now and then!)  I put the chops aside, then I sauteed an onion in the same pan.  Then add the cream and blue cheese.  (Hubby and I love blue cheese, so we added more).  This combo is sure to please!  I served it with mashed potatoes, and some even used the gravy on the them!  This will become an instant favorite!

My wife and I made this recipe before but decided to make it for a family vacation with my in-laws who are very picky eaters... We only brought enough for the adults... this was a mistake as all the nieces and nephews LOVED the sauce! A keeper for sure!

I'm am not a huge blue cheese fan but I thought these were wonderful.  I used fresh garlic and they came out perfect.  The sauce was also very good on the steamed green beans I served with them.

I made this recipe along with egg noodles.  We put the gravy over our pork chops and the noodles.  The gravy was very good but my pork chops came out dry.  I would make it again though.

This was spectacular!! I was a little leary about making this, even though we are both bleu cheese fans, but am I glad I did!! I used real un-salted butter, minced garlic and fresh sliced mushrooms. I'm not a pepper fan, so I threw it right into the skillet with the mushrooms, garlic and butter before I added the chops. It favored the mushrooms and chops perfectly without a huge pepper taste. The only problem I had was that the sauce didn't thicken as much as I thought that it would, so I might add a little more cheese next time, or a little less whipping cream. Mu husband and I definitely thought that this recipe was worthy of a restaurant and will definitely make this again!!

These are really good. I used skim milk and blue cheese dressing. After I cooked the pork chops I made the gravy and then put the pork chops back in the pan to sit for a few more minutes to soak up the flavors. Yum!

This was really good!  I had been avoiding blue cheese during my pregnancy, but now that my little guy is here (4 weeks old tomorrow, awww!) I decided to give it a whirl.  It was really yummy.  I increased the blue cheese (probably doubled it) and used 2/3 cup cream and 1/3 cup 1% milk.  Still really thick- I might try 1/2 cup milk next time.  My husband doesn't like blue cheese, so he enjoyed his pork chop plain.  My kids liked the sauce over whole wheat fettucini pasta and also liked the pork chops.  I used medium-cut (instead of thick) chops and they worked out perfectly.  Not dry at all.  I cooked them to 170 on my digi meat thermometer, then put them on a dish in the microwave (turned off) until the sauce was done.  Great simple meal.

Found this recipe here 2 yrs ago - love it and am updating my review because we now just make the gravy and serve with grilled pork roast, steak, chicken, baked potatoes, steamed vegys, bread dipping... Heat the heavy cream, pepper and garlic powder in a saucepan. Stir constantly. Add 4 oz. (double) blue cheese and stir constantly until until thickened (about 5 min). Had company recently and made this and brown gravy for a pork roast because most of them said they didn't like blue cheese.  The brown gravy didn't get touched.  Luckily, I had doubled the blue cheese gravy.  It was a hit!

This is a great recipe.  I changed it up a little after reading everyones suggestions.  I used a cast iron skillet added two tablespoons of butter along with Italiano Olive Oil.  When pan got hot I added some minced garlic then butterfly porkchops (center cut).  Remove porkchops from pan when done.  While scraping porkchop bits from pan add 1 cup of half and half to skillet.  Keep scraping the skillet when you get it to a boil lower heat and add 4 oz of blue cheese crumbles slowly while constantly stirring until cheese is melted.  I found out that I did not need to add flour or cornstarch as a thickening agent.  I had leftover sauce to use for a second dinner during the week cooking chicken tenderloins that same way I did the porkchops.  This also would be great to put over steaks and hamburgers also.

This recipe is delicious.  I am a big blue cheese fan, but my family is not.  However, both my husband and my children like this recipe.  I use boneless center cut pork chops.  There has also been a few times that I have prepared this recipe that I didn't have the heavy cream on hand, so I have used 2% milk with a little cornstarch to thicken it.  Excellent, and has become one of my "staple" dinners

I made this last night for dinner and it was delicious!!  We inhaled it!  Both my husband and I thought the sauce was out of this world.  I ended up pouring the sauce over everything on my plate, what an indulgence!  Neither of us felt the bleu cheese was overpowering, in fact, we thought it was subtle, but just right.  Not too much, not too little, just a perfect taste.  I was a little worried at first thinking it would be too intense a flavor, but it was great.  And I used 4 oz of bleu cheese.  Give this a try, you should love it!  And it was so simple to make, too.

This was so yummy!!!  I made a pork tenderloin rather than pork chops...I couldn't wait for leftovers the next day!   Revisions I made were that I added sauteed fresh mushrooms and based on other review suggestions added a little flour to thicken it.  Although high in calories, it's a definite keeper to have as a treat.

Really tasty, but a little boring by itself.  i served with asparagus which went well with the sauce.  The sauce would also be wonderful on steak.

Wow!!! I would give this ten stars if I could.  This made the creamiest sauce.  I felt like a gourmet chef!  My hubby, who doesn't like blue cheese, said it was "Excellent".  I made a few changes by added crumbled bacon, fresh chives and fresh cracked pepper to the gravy.  So yummy that I actually brougt the leftovers with me to work so I can have it for lunch (something I never do!).  This will be a staple in my recipe box.   Thanks!

I think the blue cheese gravy was a nicely added touch to a pork chop.  I used half n half instead of cream, and it worked fine (and was lower in fat).  I think next time I will have a thinner pork chop.  Trying to cook it all the way through took longer and dried it out some.  Excellent recipe!

For all you blue cheese lovers out there, this is the recipe for you!  Absolutely delicious.  The pork chops were the most tender of any I've cooked, and the blue cheese sauce was excellent.  The sauce would be fantstic over steak too.  (To quote my boyfriend "This sauce would be great over ANYTHING!")  I added more Maytag blue cheese than the recipe called for - - only suggest doing that if you love blue cheese as this sauce is quite rich.  I can't wait for the leftovers today.

We really loved this!  I added more blue cheese than it called for because we really like the flavor.  It was a bit too much for me but my husband said, "Too much is never enough with blue cheese."  It was evern better the next day!  Next time I'll use the recommended amount of cheese and it will be perfect.

I loved this.  Made it 'as is' and found it delicious!  I love pork chops and I love bleu cheese, so when I saw this recipe, I knew it was something I had to try. Thank you for sharing this tasty meal.

This was amazing! I have a large family so I doubled the recipe and had two pans going. Not everyone likes blue cheese so I made one with a couple tablespoons of ranch with the cream. I served it on the side and all 7 of us were happy!!! I thought the ranch gravy was pretty bland but I also really like blue cheese so it was a big difference in flavor. My husband doesn't like blue cheese but opted for the blue cheese gravy for his seconds. He liked both flavors. I will definitely make this again. It felt fancy but was so quick and easy!!!

Good recipe...I made as is except I served the gravy on the side as a dipping sauce. I'm not a blue cheese fan, but the gravy was delish. My pork chops took about 35 mins to cook instead of the 20-25 in the directions. Would make again.

I will make this later today for the 3rd time. I did sauté some mushrooms to serve with it. This is not a recipe I dare indulge in very often, but when I make it the gravy is so good that I want to lick the plate!

I made pork chops stuffed with spinach and blue cheese crumbles (about 2 oz. mixed with well drained spinach )   breaded and baked  pork chops(4 - 1 inch thick) on rack in oven covered with foil. baked for about 45 min.  Used drippings from roaster pan to make gravy.  OMG I will triple recipe for gravy next time,  I ate the gravy by spoonful what little bit was left. My husband raved about chops and gravy.  Will grill steaks this Sunday and make blue cheese gravy.  Thank you for awesome recipe

This recipe is something you would pay top dollar for in a fine restaurant.  I followed the recipe exact.  I seasoned my pork chops with salt, pepper, Rosemary, and thyme.  I accidentally got the salt a tad too much but the flavor was amazing.  I have never felt the need to write a review until this recipe.  The sauce was outstanding!  I paired this with some herb roasted baby red potatoes and peas.  It was a perfect match.  The people that write reviews and tell you about all the changes they made drive me nuts.  Try this exact first then change it if you want.  You won't be disappointed.

I did not make any changes other then using thinner chops, about 3/4 inch thick.  Made for quicker cooking. This is one of the best recipes I have ever made. I will be making it again and again. Delicious!!

I really liked this dish for me it was no 30 minute meal with the sides that I made. I didn't know the exact measurements of blue cheese so I used 2.5 tablespoons which was perfect it was not overpowering. With the leftover blue cheese I made blue cheese mash potatoes which I put gravy over and as my 3 year old nephew would say bomb.com. I would make the gravy again for sure. THANK YOU for posting this.

I have this every time we go to our favorite restaurant so went looking for the recipe. Absolutely delicious!  I used a small container of whipping cream and 5 oz container of blue cheese crumbles. Sautéed onions and mushrooms. Served with wild rice/quinoa and grilled asparagus. Will eat this many more times!

Sooo delicious! Subtle blue cheese taste and my family could not get enough of that gravy! The only down side is that it is a little heavy and I had to do a 3 mile run just to justify the calories from this yummy meal!

Very nice but something is missing and can't put my fingr on it .  The wow factor is not quite there. I think this would be even better with the pork cut in chunks and served over  your favorite pasta.  Maybe add mushrooms?  Thank you for sharing.

This dish turned out great! I did however make a few additions.  In addition to the pepper and garlic powder, I also added a little garlic salt to the chops. I also added bacon crumbles and chives to the gravy. Incredibly satisfying meal!

Gravy was very rich, you have to like blue cheese to appreciate this one.  I used regular milk instead of the cream.  I'm sure I will repeat sometime, maybe a once a year dish.

Heavenly!  This was an easy way to make pork chops elegant.  I followed the recipe and thought it was just right.  Hubby felt like a king.

My fiance and I tried this a bit ago and absolutely LOVED it!  We are both blue cheese fans so it's right up our alley.  Super easy and great taste.  We used the extra gravy for some noodles (kind of like an alfredo sauce).  When asked what our favorite meal we've cooked this year so far, this was definitely the winner!

I am writing this review after finishing the left-overs. Last night I was a bit sceptical to this recipe - sounded to easy to make something good. I was wrong! It was easy but also very tasty. I have done all as the recipe tells you to. Took few ides from other readers for site dishes - sauté mushrooms and oven backed potatoes. However, those who made the substitutes or put meat on BBQ - you will never get that special taste of the sauce if you do not have the fat from fried meat in the pan. Do not make another common mistake of putting starch to thicken out sauce. 5 minutes in not quite enough, cook it for at least 7 minutes and leave stand to few minutes after. Amazing! My family gets quite spoiled with home made food, but even then this recipe was a big hit. Can not wait to serve it for the guests.

WOW........this was so delicious.  My father has cancer and I'm trying to "fatten" him up so this recipe was perfect.  After pan frying the chops I sauteed mushrooms and a little brown onion in the same pan and then made the gravy.  You definitely want to undercook the chops a teeny bit since they sit and continue cooking out of the pan while you are making the gravy.  I did, and they were perfectly moist and tender.  Everyone had seconds of just the gravy poured over a big helping of rice.  thanks for a great recipe!

The sauce is great.  I followed other suggestions and used half and hald instead of cream for less calories and used blue cheese dressing instead of the crumble.  Was delicious and easy.

These were OK.  The gravy was too thin and the cooking time on  the pork chops was too long, they were dry.  Thanks.

The pork chop was ok - the gravey was OUTSTANDING!!  I used sour cream since I had no heavy cream and it was sooo good.  This could also go over steak just as well.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I've tried a few recipes from this site (I'm pretty new) and this one is the best so far! My picky husband really liked it and even my very picky 7 year old son said it taste good. Wondering what other meat the sauce would taste good on? Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I did 5oz bleu cheese & 8oz whipping cream.  I sauted mushrooms after the chops, before the cream was added w/ some white wine.  I let the sauce thicken/simmer about 5mins while making mashed potatoes & used the extra sauce as gravy mmmmm pretty good & the gravy was even better the next day & i'm not even the biggest bleu cheese fan!  Next time I may try it with feta!  try this one...very filling & delicious!

This was excellent. This is a perfect dinner for a quick weeknight when you have little time. You can easily control the amount of bleu cheese to cut down the richness. I served this with couscous, and it was just perfect. Jamieson Clem went nuts over this dish. SO EASY!

This recipe is great! My husband said this was his favorite pork chop meal so a big thank you!!! I used half and half instead of whipping cream and mixed in 2 Tbls. of homemade bleu cheese dressing. You do have to stir the sauce for at least 5 minutes for it to thicken. It was so quick,easy and wonderful! Thank you so much for psoting this one!

This is spectacular.  I did change it some- evaporated milk and 2% milk, used some flour to thicken it- salt and pepper to taste.  Everyone loved this- even the kids.  I never would have thought to make a gravy with bleu cheese, but am so glad I did.  We served the porkchops and sauce over rice.

REally good. My 2 1/2 year old grandson ate a plate full and wanted more!! I followed the recipe but just increased (?) the blue cheese, I used about 2 palm fulls, which i am sure is a bit more than 2 oz. Served with boiled red potato and aparagus.DH drizzel the sauce over everything.  Thank you. Will definately make again. I would not change anything.

This sauce is awesome! And if you are like me and don't always have blue cheese on hand, you can substitute the blue cheese for parmesean cheese in the can!

Yummmmmmy!!! The blue cheese sauce was delicious! I made with 1/2 cup of lowfat milk to save the calories and just simmered it longer, it did thicken.

I love blue cheese so I added 6 oz. instead of 2 oz. and my family absolutely loved it!  Everyone went back for seconds!  This is definitely a keeper.

Gravy is great with side of potatoes (I did baked,  mashed would be good too.) I prefer a thinner gravy, so don't cook too long.

At first I thought of how to make this by putting it on the grill but There is just no way to save the juices to make the gravy. It was absolutly fantastic. My fiance loves blue cheese and he took his first bite and said Oh my god! I thougt someting was wrong but  it was just him loving the dish so much. I don't usually have whip cream in my fridge so I used 1 cup milk mixed with 2 tsps of corn starch so that it would thicken.

I found the gravy just a bit overwhelming, even though I love blue cheese.  However, thinking back, I may have added more blue cheese than called for. It was a very good recipe though, will make again with possibly a couple alterations on the gravy.

Fabulous recipe, very easy.  My husband and the boys love their pork chops and tenderloins, so I need different recipes!  I grilled the pork chops on my George Foreman, scraped some of the pork chop bits and put in the sauce along with the cream and blue cheese and butter....wow, so good...

The gravy makes this dish delectable. There was enough to dip the steamed broccoli we had with it. I imagine this sauce would be marvelous on steak as well.

This was an awesome recipe. I swapped  the blue cheese for gorgonzola cheese, it has a milder taste then blue and sauteed onions/mushrooms to go with it. The gravy was a bit to much so I will cut that in half the next time I make this. All and all its a keeper.

This is the most moist and tasty pork chop I have ever had!  I made it for lunch and not only was it quick but delicious.  The great news is that it only had to cook for about 18 mins before the chops were done.  I did follow the advice of some others and added some red pepper to the chops while cooking.  My husband doesn’t like blue cheese so I served his without and then just added the sauce over the blue cheese crumbles on my chop.  Amazing and will certainly use again. Thanks for the great recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I used 3 oz of Blue Cheese instead of 2 and I used butterfly cut pork chops and cut them in half.  Since there is only two of us we had enough for 2 meals.  Leftovers were also delicious.  Will definitely prepare this recipe again.

I came across this exact recipe about five years ago and I just love this recipe and have made it often!  It is so easy and so delicious.  The only thing that I (sometimes) do is to add about one ounce of cognac to the gravy.  Sure, the heat cooks off the alcohol, but I like the flavor that the cognac imparts to this great dish.

The combo of pork and blue cheese was not to our taste, but we agreed that the gravy would be great with beef.  Fried up some bacon first and then cooked the pork in the bacon drippings.  This really enhanced the gravy and flavor of the pork.  Will try again, but with beef tenderloin.

Wow!  Talk about amazing!  I made this one night for my husband and I and he LOVED it.  HE said "You have to make this for company"  So a week later I tested it out on my Sister and Brother in law.  They both loved it!  I also sent some over to a friend and her husband that had just moved into a new house and they raved about it as well! The great thing about this is you can make the gravy as strong of blue cheese or weak as you want.  Gravy is also good on Rice or Mashed Potatoes!  A must try recipe!

I didn't make the gravy but was seriously impressed with this method of frying up pork chops. 

Even though it was simple and the idea of rubbing them with garlic salt seemed funny to me at the time they were the most flavourful pork chops I've ever eaten. Wow!

Very Good however I would prefer this delicious sauce with extra blue cheese added at the end (so that it doesnt melt down all the way) and I think it would go better with a great steak!

I added rosemary to the chops and for the sauce I used half and half cream, a splash of white wine and a squeeze of blue cheese dressing. I loved it. Will definitely make again.

The pork chops were good but the gravy lacked taste.  I used 1/2 cup of crumbles and couldn't even taste the blue cheese flavor.  Maybe my calculations were off?

Very interesting flavor.  You have to be a blue cheese fan to appreciate this dish.  I did not have whipping cream on hand, so I substituted whole milk in the gravy.  Will make again.

My family wasn't overly excited about this one but they DID like it.  I'm giving this 5 stars because I LOVED it.  There aren't too many recipes that I will make only because I love it while direguarding my family.  This recipe is way to good to put in the "if i'm ever cooking for just me" file.  I will make it every chance I get.  There is a very strong blue cheese taste so if you don't like blue cheese don't try this recipe.  For the rest of us this is a must try!  Thank you for a delicious way to make pork chops.

this was amazing! I cooked a couple pieces of bacon then sauted chunky mushrooms in the bacon fat.  Crumbled the bacon and sprinkled on top of chops with the mushrooms.  Definitely a husband pleaser.  Blue cheese is only a subtle flavor in this.

my boyfriend and i both liked this recipe... it was fast and easy. i prepared it exactly as written except i added baby bella mushrooms. my only problem with it is that it isn't very healthy. maybe i'll try it again using skim milk and low fat blue cheese dressing as others have substituted.

I have never rated any recipes before, but this one deserves a definite 5 star rating.  Doubled the blue cheese and suggested by many, added fresh garlic and sauted mushrooms to the gravy and simmered the pork chops for an additional 15 minutes in the gravy.  Super!

This was excellent!!!  I used thin bonein chops and used twice as much gorgonzola cheese with lots of mushrooms.  I also was out of garlic powder, so I rubbed minced garlic over the chops.  Definitly make some bread to soak up the gravy!  Yum!!!

This was very good! I used light cream with a little bit of flour instead of whipping cream and it turned out great, with probably less fat. 
This recipe is full of flavor. Yum!

Delicious, but just a little bit too rich. Of course, the success of the sauce all depends on the blue cheese you use; the stuff I have at the moment was perhaps just a little bit too strong for this particular recipe. We did enjoy this though. Thanks, Toni!

If you like blue cheese, you will like this recipe.  The blue cheese does not overpower the pork, at all.  Blue cheese simply has a destinct flavor.  I doubled the blue cheese and simmered the pork chops in the blue cheese/cream sauce for 25 minutes.

I LOVE this website!!  I made these pork chops for dinner tonight, and they are wonderful. I did add some seasoning salt, onion powder, and parsley flakes to the chops, and then cooked them on low in the blue cheese gravy for 3 minutes until the rest of my dinner was done.  I will DEFINITELY make this again.

Great recipe!  Perfect flavor for blue cheese lovers.  I have also made the gravy to use on grilled pork chops.  You don't even miss the pork flavor in the gravy, although the color of the gravy is brighter without the pork and grease from the pan.  Thanks again for a great easy recipe.

I used heavy cream instead of whipping.  We liked the sauce however, it was not a five star recipe.  Will make again perhaps on chicken next time.

This was an awesome recipe.  My fat husband thinks Im a gourmet chef! The only thing I would change is to double the amount of blue cheese, it wasn't strong enough and the gravy was a little runny.  So with more blue cheese it would thicken up.  Thanks Toni!!

These were just wonderful.  We were on Atkins when I first made these and it is a perfect Atkins recipe.  I substitued chicken for pork chops a few times.  So decadent, I wanted to lick the pan clean!

I used pork tenderloin, cut into 2 inch medalions and slightly flattened.  This dish is really rich and fattening.  Next time, to cut calories and increase the sauce, I am going to deglaze the pan with beef or chicken stock and then add half the cream.

Great recipe.  I thickened with Wondra and it turned out great.  I only made 2 porkchops and used the extra sauce on baked potatoes.  Yum!

I cooked this last night and it was wonderful.  My husband loved it and said it was a keeper.  I used pork tenderloin chops and added some flour to a little of the gravy and stirred it back in to thicken.

This was great. I prepared it for our Sunday dinner. We also had mashed potatoes and asparagus with it. I bought Center cut pork loin chops that were about an inch thick.

I made this for the second time last night and once again we ate it ALL! The only thing I did different was add a little cornstarch and water to the sauce to thicken it up a little more. We love it!

This recipe was good, and since I love blue cheese I really liked the sauce.  The only thing I didn't like was that the sauce didn't really thicken.  I used heavy cream instead of whipping cream.  I don't know if that's what made the difference.

I absolutely loved this recipe, however, my husband who eats just about everything (and loves blue cheese) said it was just "all right."  I thought the sauce was great and the pork came out juicy and moist.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am not a big fan of Blue Cheese but loved this recipe.  It added such a good flavor to the pork chops.  I wish I had read Aunty M's review before making this recipe for I would have saved the left over gravy for other uses as she stated.  It is definately a "make again" recipe for my family.

This recipe is so good and so easy! The sauce is ridiculously easy to make and would work so well with so many things. It would go well with chicken and beef. I want to try it as a sauce over pasta.

Great recipe, definitely a keeper.  Only changes I made was to saute fresh minced garlic  in the butter before cooking the chops, and made the sauce using whole milk and a bit of flour to thicken.  Had enough sauce left over to use for steaks I plan to cook in a day or two.  Delicious!

When I saw this recipe, I loved the simplicity.  It is quite easy to make and the results, for me, were delicious.  I only made three changes:  (1) I doubled the amount of cream & cheese.  My thoughts being the sauce would be so awesome on pasta.  (2) I used Lawry’s® seasoned salt (low sodium).  (3) I added chopped parsley for some visual interest.

Easy recipe and turned out fantastic! Instead of frying pork chops in the pan the entire time, I browned them on each side then put them in the oven for 15 additional minutes.

My family really liked this.  The sauce is the winner here.  Watch the time/temp on the chops. Depending on the thickness, the cook times as written, could be too long.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. I did add a little white wine to the pan while cooking the pork chops and then a little bit more to the whipping cream/blue cheese mixture. I also used about 1.5 c of cream and 4 oz of cheese because I wanted extra sauce. After the sauce was done I covered it and sautéed broccoli in the same pan I made the sauce/chops in; which gave the broccoli a nice coating of flavor. I served the broccoli and pork chops with baked potato. Everyone loved it!

It is true.  You got the blue cheese for the lovers but, for those who don't care for it not a problem.  It turns out so smooth, you'll love it.  Kept right with the recipe. Yes you will want to eat it with a spoon, lol just like the others said.

I made it nearly as written, except I used 4 oz blue cheese. Both my husband and I were amazed at how good it was.  It is definitely company worthy.  The pork chops were very moist, and the gravy was extremely delicious.  Don’t wonder or hesitate, this recipe is a knockout !!

We loved this and will make it again.  However, I only gave it 4 stars because after reading the other reviews, I did alter a little - but not much.  I did season some flour with garlic powder, salt, and pepper - coated the pork chops in it and then cooked like directed.  The sauce I made exactly as directed and it was excellent - - served with fresh green beans and roasted potatoes.

Yum!!! Cut this in 1/2 for 2 but, used the original amount of blue cheese because we love it. Mixed a little flour into the butter and little pieces of pork. It was a very nice slightly thick sauce over the chops. Will make these again!

This is a good recipe and a nice change.  I cooked them in olive oil rather than butter.  I used skim milk in place of whipping cream with a TBSP of flour mixed in it.  Then I added 1/3 cup of the blue cheese, and some fresh garlic and herbs  provence,  it thickened really nice in about 3 minutes.

My go to recipe to wow guests .  I follow the directions but usually have such big chops I have to fry in batches and makes for long prep time.  Will try to do a quick fry and finish with baking to speed things up a bit.  Impeccable flavor.

This is excellent -- and really easy.  I made only slight changes to this, including finishing the chops in the oven and adding a tad of bacon grease (good Southern gal) with the butter.  We do love blue cheese and used 3 oz. vs. 2 oz., and it would probably be great with 4 oz.!  We get a cut of pork chops that is called "ribeye."  This is flavorful and tender and was perfect for this recipe.  KEEPER!

An easy delicious recipe.  I brined my pork chops for three days so they were tender.  Next time I want to add mushrooms and onion to the gravy to give it some body.

I would use half the bleu cheese next time, but it was good. My honey inhaled it. And as I was typing this, he commented how good it was. The trick for me is getting the chops done but not over done.

The gravy was awesome! Note for next time: reduce the cooking time cause the chops were pretty dry.

I didn't change anything except I used half and half instead of whipping cream since I had it on hand. I served it with gnocchi  and a salad. My family loved it.

My daughter cooked this recipe for us, and it was DIVINE! We love mushrooms, so we did add mushrooms. She had chosen to make Parmesan rosemary potatoes and caprese salad as the side dishes. The gravy also worked wonderfully for the potatoes! We will definitely be making this again! We are going to make other recipes using the blue cheese gravy. This was a big hit for all of us, myself, my husband, adult daughter and grandsons.

Discovered this recipe today while searching for what to do with the thick cut pork chops I had.  I've never cooked any pork except a pork tenderloin so I was already nervous to begin with.  But this recipe was PERFECT!!  Oh my stars... so easy to create and it tasted like restaurant quality.  I'll be making this again for sure!  I'm also going to try the gravy over a steak.... I'm sure it will be just as wonderful.  (PS... I also sauteed fresh mushrooms in the pan drippings because my boyfriend loves them, so my gravy had mushroom flavor added to it).  Can't wait to make this again!

To start I seasoned pork with garlic salt, pepper, and seasoned salt. I followed everything except the cook time due to the thickness  of the chops. Pan frying the pork on medium heat with one Tbl spoon of olive oil in 5 minute increments per side until 150 degrees then rest for at least 3 minutes.  I used three cheese tortalini and baby gold potatoes as sides it turned out perfect.  I topped the finished chops with chopped bacon and coated the tortalini lightly in the sauce.  The recipe was easy to cook and was a huge hit at home.  A+++

Great dish! Quick and easy recipe! Hubby and my 1 year old both loved it, I will definitely be making again! 

Only thing I did differently was I used blue cheese dressing cause that's all I had in kitchen.

Really easy to make. My two boys (6 & 8) loved it!  I added a little less cream than the recipe called for, and substituted milk instead.  It worked out great!

I used boneless breakfast pork steaks and cooked them as required by the recipe (in butter, and added a little white wine to the gravy. This dish turned out rich and delicious tasting. If you want to thicken the gravy just add more cheese.

Made this with ingredients listed and added 1 cup sliced button mushrooms. I did simmer the chops in the gravy for 15 minutes to tenderize them further.  Next time I'll try something just a bit lighter like Half N Half or whole milk.  Very rich tasting, very easy to make and the gravy was amazing on mashed potatoes.

I just made this recipe.  I was giving up on pork chops until today.  This recipe is simple and delicious.  The sauce put it over the top.  Restaurant quality!  The seasoning on the pork chop was basic and it didnt mask the flavor of the pork chop.  I got a nice crust on the chops cooking it in butter.  The chops were so moist.  I will be making this again, real soon!

Utterly delicious and didn't change a thing. The blue cheese flavor is subtle, so even non-blue cheese fans may want to give this a shot.

This is so easy! and tasty too! My only suggestion is be careful not to over cook the pork chops. I didn't take into condensation the thickness of the pork chops I was using. Always remember the chops are still cooking as they rest. I be bad, a little over done!! Still in my book this recipe gets 5 stars out of 5.

I've been making this recipe from memory for years but came back to make sure I had it right. It's INCREDIBLE! I've served it to company many times and am always praised for an outstanding meal. I always use half and half and probably more like 4 oz of bleu cheese. I add about a teaspoon of flour to help thicken it up enough to coat a spoon. I always make sure to serve it with mashed or baked potato or polenta to help mop up every last drip of gravy, you know, so you don't have to embarrass yourself by licking the plate! YUM-O!!!

Let me preface my review by saying I bought greens to have a nice salad with these chops, but as soon as I pulled them out the oven (I'll tell the oven part later...I know there isn't oven directions), I knew we had to chow down RIGHT away. The greens are spoiling in my refrigerator as I type.
Now, you should know I tweaked the recipe just a bit, and I'm SOOO glad I did. For the gravy, I added enough finely chopped onion to taste. Also, I doubled the bleu cheese (we love the stuff!). I added all the ingredients for the gravy in a bowl and let it sit and marinate while I lightly battered the boneless pork chops with flour, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and some soul seasoning. I fried the pork chops in vegetable oil just enough to get them light pink on the inside and brown on the outside, then, I laid them out in a casserole dish. I made the gravy as directed, with my additions. Then, I covered the pork in the gravy and baked it for 15-20 minutes on 350F. I then added some crumbled bleu cheese to the top and let it bake a bit more. 

We ate this with garlic mashed potatoes smothered in extra gravy and mixed vegetables. This is a great sauce for almost any meat, potatoes, or vegetable. Perfect meal!

Very good, simple recipe. I substituted half and half for the whipping cream in the gravy, and it worked out just fine. And I had enough gravy to drizzle over mashed potatoes which really added a lot of flavor to them.

This recipe is so easy and really delicious!  And it doesn't take a thousand ingredients to make, which is always a bonus.  No changes needed -- make it exactly as written and it comes out perfectly.

This was phenomenal. Added about 10 cloves of garlic to the cream/blue cheese sauce and it was amazing. Will make again.

I tried the recipe as it is written with the exception of me not measuring my seasonings (black pepper, salt and garlic powder); I just seasoned reasonably based on my preference.  The recipe was easy to follow, which is especially important to me because I don't cook often. Even before adding the sauce, the pork chops were GREAT! It was even better once I put the blue cheese gravy on top bc I am a HUGE FAN of blue cheese. Everything came out perfectly! Next time, I may try it with low-fat cream or milk, but I would hate to mess with perfection.  And for those that are on WW (as I am), this equals about 11 points.

Being blue cheese lovers we always like to find new ways to use it in our meals. This did not disappoint! Easy as can be with yummy results (we did add a small sprig of fresh thyme & a pat of butter to the pan juices. Only thing I'd do different next time is to double the blue cheese for our tastes but for those who may not love it as much as we do the recipe as written is just fine as well!

Don't let the simplicity of this recipe turn you away! It's easy and quick, and simply delicious! I'm so glad I found it and tried it. I added mushrooms to it, and served it with a light summer salad and corn on the cob.

I love this recipie.  It sounds odd, but I added a few drops of smoke flavor to the chops while they were cooking, which has a beautiful effect on the gravy in the end. Sauteed mushrooms to go with it.

This is a wonderfully yummy and easy recipe! I have made this for a few guests and it gets rave reviews! Adding a little more blue cheese doesn't harm the recipe either, so if you love it, just add a bit more! :)

Amazing!  My husband made something similar to this that we loved and lost the recipe.  I made this exactly and it was to die for!  I wouldn't change a thing.  My husband said if it wasn't for the fact we wouldn't fit in our clothes by the end of the month, he'd have me make this every night.  I served it w/ steamed green beans w/pearl sized onions and a little bit of seseame oil and real mashed potato's.  YUMMY!!!  Thanks for sharing.

This is amazing! I just finished it and my 10 year old loved it! I followed everything and it turned out great! I used boneless pork chops though, but next time I want to try it with the boned ones! Thanks for this, I can't wait for my husband to get home to try!

A nice change from plain gravy. Very good and easy to make. I added more blue cheese than recipe called for because of personal preference. I think if you like blue cheese you'll enjoy this recipe but if you don't care for blue cheese then you might not.

I gave this a 5 star because this is a really good pork chop recipe. If you LOOOOOOVE blue cheese you will go nuts over this gravy. We LIKE blue cheese and for us the blue cheese was a little over powering so I added some garlic powder and onion powder to the gravy while cooking and it calmed the flavor down just a bit. We really liked it tho and it is a keeper for sure. I think next time I will use 1/2 the blue cheese........ 9/12/20010. We have made this many times. I crave it a lot and have found that Amish Blue Cheese make this gravy even better. Amish Blue Cheese is milder. No so much bite. I put 6 heaping TB. in the 1 cup of whipping cream. Today I made chops in the slow cooker and decided to make some of the gravy to go on them. I melted about 2 TB. of bacon drippings in a fry pan and sauted 1/2 C. real bacon bits for a few minutes in the bacon drippings and then added 1 1/2 C. of heavy whipping cream and and about 9 heaping TB. of Amish Blue Cheese. I poured it over the chops and YUM YUM YUM!!!!!

I just love this recipe and so does my hubby.   I have made a few times now...this last time  I doubled the sauce.  It ended up unnecessary as I was left with too much sauce.  I will have to find something to make with it as it is too good to throw away.  I used 1/2 1/2 instead of cream and it was just as good.  I served with roasted broccoli and fresh bread to sop up the gravy...YUM

Recipe was good.  I did not have a meat thermometer so I was leary about cooking pork and ended up over cooking.  Its not the recipe's fault so I still gave it 4 starts.  I rarely give 5.  Kids enjoyed this so I will make again.

Easy and I get rave responses for these chops! Buy thin cut pork chops for a more tender affordable meal! The gravy is also great as a dipping sauce for bread. Yum!

Delicious.  Didn't change a thing and turned out FAB!  P.S. Bread to dip in the gravy is a must.

This was absolutely heavenly! I doubled the blue cheese but otherwise made exactly the same. It's very rich so it's not an every day meal but great for dinner parties or special occasions. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

Very good....I used thick slices of pork tenderloin and exchanged the cream for fat free half and half.  The leftovers tasted even better the next day for lunch!

Excellent- I love bleu cheese on almost anything- so the sauce can go a long way, I had left over sauce & used over an encrusted tilapia fillet the following night.

WOW - this is awesome.  I had some boneless pork chops and was looking through allrecipes to find something to do with them.  I saw this recipe and just knew I had to make it.  I had all the ingredients at home - I buy blue cheese when it's on sale and freeze it.  I made a couple of changes, after browning and removing the  pork chops I added 8 oz sliced fresh mushrooms to the pan and cooked them till they were nicely browned.  And then I thought, that is just too much yummy goodness on the bottom of that pan so I deglazed with a little brandy and cooked till it evaporated and then added the cream.  I used 4 oz of blue cheese instead of the 2 - I love blue cheese.  I have one pork chop left and I sure hope my daughter doesn't find it in the refridgerator!  haha I served them with some pasta with olive oil (pasta roni) and fresh sliced tomatoes - YUM YUM ... Thanks Toni!!

Wow this was really really good! I used chicken in place of the pork chops and it was awesome. I served it with linguine topped with chicken breasts and then the sauce. Thanks for the great recipe!

Yum! Yum! Yum.  so easy and so good.  The best part is that  the blue cheese gravy is made separate from the pork chops so the whole family can eat this meal (even the ones that don't like blue cheese).  My daughter loved the pork chops alone and the rest of us enjoyed them with the delicious gravy.  Thank you for this deliciously different recipe.

I loved this! My husband likes plain pork chops and I hate plain... Voila, I added this and he didn't. Wonderful rich flavor and so easy to make. I served with rice and corn. We were both happy.

This was really good. I made it with "Strawberry Spinach Salad I" and "Fried Cabbage with Bacon, Onion, and Garlic". The gravy from the pork chops complimented the cabbage very well (to my surprise).

Turns out very delicious! Even my bf who doesn't like pork, really enjoyed it. I rubbed lots of garlic powder, cayenne, smoked paprika and black pepper into the rump pork steak and that made them full of flavour. I fried some chopped onion as well, added it to a sauce, used 150g of blue cheese, 2 tsp of cornstarch and sprinkled everything with lots of fresh parsley. Served with french fries. My man loved this proper, comfort, heavy food. Too much calories to have it too often tho ;(

I liked this recipe a lot.  I added about a tsp of smoked pimenton, which seemed to round out the flavor some.  Will definitely make again.

I have made these several times- and I LOVE them. I followed the recipe to a T. My fiance complained that there was too much cheese. For a person who loves cheese though, there was no problem at all.

This was great! I only used 1/2 cup of whipping cream because that was all I had left. I also used 4oz. of blue cheese just to use up the entire package. Delicious! :)

Completely a 5 star recipe!!! This is probably the first time I've EVER had moist pork chops--I couldn't stop talking about them at dinner! I used canola oil instead of butter because it tolerates heat better. Since my chops were thick and browned before they were done cooking, I threw them in the oven for a few minutes to finish. I sauteed crimini mushrooms in the pan drippings then added the cream and some cornstarch. I used 4oz of Gorgonzola instead of blue cheese. Served with roasted asparagus, and wished I made mashed potatoes to go with the gravy. We tried a little gravy over some wheat pasta, but didn't care for it. Thanks for creating a recipe that finally gets me excited about pork chops!

Oh my goodness, the blue cheese gravy is one of the most delicious sauces I have ever made AND tasted!  I was leery about it at first but my boyfriend insisted I make it, and I am glad I did.  I am going to use this sauce for other things as well.  My pork chops were far from bland (as other reviewers mentioned) but I think it's because I increased the amount of spices and also added some roasted minced garlic that we buy in a jar.  I love making pork chops, so I tend to focus on NOT letting them end up bland.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's now one of my favorites.

This was really good.  Even my 2 picky teenagers were pleased with this.  The blue cheese gravy was mild, so if you're a blue cheese lover, don't be afraid to add a little more.  It was also super easy to make and will definitely be on the dinner table again soon.  I think the gravy would be really good with steak too.

We ate this gravy for the last two nights.  First over pork chops, with broccoli and roasted potatoes, then over pan fried chicken with mashed potatoes and salad.  It is so yummy!  The first night I made the gravy exactly as the recipe was written.  The second night I heated the left over gravy in the pan and added some half and half, and then more blue cheese.  This recipe is a keeper!

It was very bland, I seared the chops in a pan then put them in the oven to finish cooking. I added extra blue cheese, but there was still something missing.

The gravy really made this recipe!  These were really good, I left the recipe as is.  I only wish I had made more gravy...I could have eaten it by the spoonful!

Yummy! I usually use gorgonzola crumbs instead of blue cheese because we like the taste better. I either use fat-free milk or fat free half and half like others have recommended. Very easy and very delicious!

I added a bit more garlic and salt to this.  I serve it with sauteed onions and mushrooms.  Makes you wanna just drink the gravy, but it's not good for you so you actually have to restrain yourself.  One of my Bf's favorite recipes.

Good flavor.  Poured gravy over pork chops and sprinkled with paprika for color.  My husband even commented about the nice presentation.  Served with Roasted Potatoes with Greens and Double Quick Dinner Rolls.

This was pretty good.  I didn't have any whipping cream so I used 1% milk.  I'd try making it again though with the whipping cream and I bet it would be even better.

Very tasty!  I use the black pepper and garlic measurements in this recipe; I eye balled it.  I used skim milk instead of the cream and used 1/2 milk to 1/2 blue cheese as recommended by another reviewer.  The skim milk resulted in a really thin gravy so I added dried milk powder and sprinkled a little flour in the gravy in order to thicken the gravy.  Really enjoyed the overall taste.

This was not good at all.  Edible, but not good. I was really looking forward to it because of all the excellent reviews on the site but mine did not turn out like expected at all.  The pork was juicy but had no flavor.  I followed the directions exactly, other than I added some extra pepper and garlic powder to the chops.  My gravy was brown and had a slight burnt taste to it, but was not overpowering with blue cheese flavor.  Overall, I was disappointed and for the amount of calories in this dish would just rather have breaded and fried chops with milk gravy.

This recipe was excellent although I made a few changes.  I grilled the chops rather than pan frying.  Instead of using the drippings from the pork chops, I sauteed half a chopped vidalia onion and about 6 slices of bacon.  I removed the bacon for another use and put in about 3/4 a cup of whipping cream and about 4 ounzes of a mild blue cheese with the bacon drippings and onions.  The gravy was wonderful, especially with the rosemary mashed potatoes and green beens I made as side dishes.  I will definitely be making this again.

Unbelievable recipe that is so quick and easy.  I use this with pork chops or steak.  If you get a thick steak, you can slice into it and stuff the blue cheese inside.  Also, if you choose the stead, follow the recipe, but after the 20 min. on the stove, i throw it on the grill.  Hope you enjoy.

This recipe was really good because of the gravy. I used thick-cut pork chops like the recipe says, but next time I'll definitely use thinner chops. The thick ones take too long to cook. We love blue cheese and the gravy was delicious served over brown rice.

this recipe was great!  Instead of garlic powder, I sauteed fresh minced garlic in the butter that I sauteed the chops in,  and I used thin chops instead of thick.  Also, I used Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing instead of blue cheese.

This is such an easy dinner to make and the taste is fantastic. I have made many times. Serve with mashed potatoes and make extra gravy. I am under orders from my daughter that I can't make this on nights she won't be home.

Outstanding. Made it for my man, who isn't a huge 'gravy' fan...loved every bite!  So did I.  I would definately recommend this for any occasion.  Mashed potatoes are a must w/this blue cheese gravy.  Can't wait to make again.

Very good recipe.  I had some thick boneless pork loin chops that turned out great with this sauce.  I used about a tsp of minced garlic instead of powder.  For the sauce, I used fat free half and half and a little more than 2 oz crumbled gorgonzola cheese.  It wasn't very thick so I stirred in a mixture of 1/2 tbsp cornstarch and 1 tbsp water.  I put the chops back in the pan with the sauce to coat them all over before serving.  I also served some bow tie pasta tossed with sun dried tomato pesto and extra olive oil on the side with a bit of the sauce on top.  Thanks for helping me use up the gorgonzola in a delicious way.

My husband said this was the best pork chop I have ever made.  The gravy is amazing (and I am not really a fan of bleu cheese).  I used half and half instead of full fat whipping cream to make it a little healthier.  We will definitely make this again!

Delicious! I don't usually like blue cheese at all, but my husband really does, so I made this dish especially for him.  We BOTH had seconds, and wished there was more!  The sauce is fabulous!  I'll probably use what little leftover we have to put over some pasta for lunch.  I used the suggestion of 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup blue cheese dressing, and it turned out perfectly! This one will definitely be a regular for us.

This is one of the best pork chop recipes I have ever eaten.  I added onions to the gravy and you could probably increase the cream to extend the gravy.  I bet it would be good on chicken breasts as well.  I made it with pork stew meat as well and it worked great and ate it over baked potatoes.

I served this to my family tonight and my husband who is a bit of a picky eater loved it. Has just the right amount of Blue Cheese bit to the gravy.  I used Pork Loin and served this with steamed rice; Zucchini and onions as side dishes. If you like Blue Cheese this is a treat.

This was delicious! I did a few things different. I used boneless pork loin chops & added fresh garlic & cooked them slowly until slightly brown. I then made the bleu cheese gravy & added some fresh mozzarella to it (just a little bit) and let the chops simmer in the gravy for about 1/2 hr. until they were nice & brown. I put some of the left over gravy on fresh green beans and served with mashed potatoes. My boyfriend loved it & went back for seconds! Great recipe!

This is awesome! I didn't have actual blue cheese on hand, so I used blue cheese dressing- made the dressing very creamy. I also use fresh garlic, onion, and mushrooms that I add with the chops (I use fast fry (thin) pork chops) and it always turns out great! I only gave it four stars because I think it needs the onions and mushrooms to round it out.

We didn't care for this.  It just wasn't what I expected.  I thought it sounded like it would be really good, love blue cheese & thought it would compliment the chops well, unfortunately we threw most of it out.  Just didn't like it.

Pretty good.  I hate to call such a nice sauce gravy though.  It was a good sauce that could be very versatile.  I suggest using a thin chop.  I used thick chops and they took forever to cook.

The blue cheese gravy was awesome.  The whole family loved it, even the kids, who usually don't like blue cheese.  The key is using the pork drippings, just like the recipe says.  We saved the extra gravy and ate it with everything the following week - from chicken strips to green beans!

I loved it!  I combined 2 recipes as I had to work that day. I seered the chops in butter and seasonings listed here, then used the slow cooker recipe for sour cream chops.  I cooked the chops all day in chichen broth and onions.  When I arrived home the chops were so tender!  I took some of the broth and onions with the blue cheese half and half and about 3 tbs of sour cream, simmered with the chops until thickened. Served over egg noodles. My husband does not care for blue cheese much and went back for 2nds!

This is a great recipe for pork chops.  I made it tonight for dinner the whole family loved it. Made regular cut pork chops and served the sauce on the side so everyone could determine their own calorie intake.  Delicious.  My daughter put the sauce on the angle hair pasta I served on the side.  This is our new favorite pork chop recipe.  Thanks.

This was divine. I used fresh garlic that I threw in the pan with the margarine, I also used a little bit of olive oil. Sauteed the mushrooms with the chops and took them out and kept them warm while making the sauce. Probably added more than 2 oz. of blue cheese but totally worth it. The sauce was very rich but an awesome treat. I have some sauce left over so I might add it to pasta.

This recipe was good but certainly needed some gusto!  I added garlic, onions, and mushrooms but it was still laking in substantial flavor.  Maybe I'll try more cheese next time.

This was my second attempt at making pork chops and this time they turned out juicy and tender! My husband coached me on the right temp (he's an ex-chef),which helped tremendously. As for the sauce, we used 4 tbsp and will definitely be adding more next time. I also added fresh cracked black pepper as the cheese was melting. Served with mashed potatoes, French-cut greenbeans, and a salad....very good meal. I will make again, for sure. thank you for the recipe. I needed something new to make!

I added fresh mushrooms, green onion and chopped garlic to the browned chops and simmered covered for about 45 minutes. Used 4 oz. of the blue cheesein the gravy. Will make again with hamburger steaks & steak fries.

My pork chops were very thick (over 1") and they emitted a LOT of juices, so for a thicker sauce, I doubled or maybe even quadrupled the cheese using 1/2 of the gorgonzola variety and 1/2 regular blue cheese; next time, I think I'd go with all gorgonzola. I used all half and half, rather than cream.  Next time I would use a thinner pork chop or else cut the thick chops in half lengthwise.  This was very good.  We had a lot of leftover sauce; tonight we had grilled burgers and drizzled some of the sauce over them for a blue cheese burger; it was delish.  Thank you, Toni!

Pretty good, I love blue cheese so the gravy was great.  I used very thick cut pork chops, but next time I think I'd try it with a thinner cut.

these were wonderful.  The gravy was a good consistency and the blue cheese was a good compliment to the pork.

This was excellent.  I added mushrooms, onions, and chopped garlic and sauteed it in the butter with the chops.  I also simmered the chops in the blue cheese gravy for 10 minutes.  It was delicious!!!  I will definitly make this again!

This made a wonderful, rich dinner.  The blue cheese gravy would certainly work with any meat.
It was delicious served over mashed potatoes as well as the meat.

This was as good as I expected it to be when I first saw this recipe. It was easy to make and I will make this again soon. The next time I make this I will serve it with mashed potatoes to use more of the gravy.

This was ok.  My chops turned out a little dry.  The gravy was very good.  I might try it with a different meat or cut of chop.

I liked this.. not too blue-cheesy. :) 
I didn't put alot of gravy on the pork chops so there was a lot of gravy leftover.  Will make again but for a larger group.

This was a definite winner in our house.  My husband took one bite and said, "this is a definite 5 star".  I'm not a huge fan of pork chops, and I liked this as well.  Like many other reviewers, I doubled the blue cheese.  So good!  Thanks!

I read all the reviews and thought this was worth a try.  I love salad with blue cheese dressing so I thought this might be good.  It was not.  Pork has a mild taste and the blue cheese overpowered it.   I will not make this again.

This was just ok.  Not a 5 star by any means in my house.  We love blue cheese, but this was just so-so.  Probably won't make it again.  I'll keep looking for other pork chop recipes.

This recipe was o.k. not outstanding.  My husband and family are pretty open minded when trying new recipes, and this one was not well recieved.  The blue cheese was too strong in the gravy.  The vote from my family was to not make it again.

Excellent and so simple!  The second time I made it, I tried deglazing the pan w/chick broth as another user suggested; if you try this make sure you use low sodium broth, b/c I didn't and it tasted too salty.

I did this with pork tenderloin, slicing it just before serving and adding the sauce.  I added one tbsp. cornstarch & one tbsp. water to the sauce at the end as it was too runny and would saute onions and mushrooms next time as suggested for more flavour.  Great elegant recipe.

I have made this many times, most recently with chicken. I love how my husband has no idea there is blue cheese in it and he loves it.   This was great! Probably one of the best pork chop recipes I've found. My husband is a picky eater, so he doesn't like a lot of the things I try. He doesn't like blue cheese, but I fooled him with this one. He really liked the recipe and the people he worked enjoyed smelling the aroma of his leftovers heated up the next day.

This was very easy but it wasn't as good as I had hoped. My pork chops were kind of dried out so maybe they weren't thick enough. I don't think I'll try it again but that is just because there are plenty of recipes that I like better.

This was good.  I even fooled my husband who hates blue cheese into eating this dish.  He said it was good, but could not place the unique taste.  I will make again.

This will become one of my favorite recipes to make.  It was so easy and very tasty.  I too added a little flour/water mix to thicken it.

Very flavorful, rich recipe.  I used a little more blue cheese than I meant to, so the sauce was quite strong. I used regular cut pork chops instead of thick cut and I also made pasta to soak up some of the sauce.  I recommend trying this recipe, but just prepare yourself for a "heavy" meal.  I wouldn't plan on having cheesecake for dessert...

This was really good.  I think I would like it, maybe even better, on some other meat, like chicken or even a tender cut of beef.  Thanks, Toni!

I'd rate it even higher.  I followed recipe exactly and the gravy was perfect.  I did use reviewers suggestions and sauteed some garlic and mushrooms in butter separately and put them over the chops and then spooned over the gravy.  This is a keeper for my Blue Cheese lovers!  Served it with buttered egg noodles.  Mashed potatoes would have been good too.

This was pretty good.  The sauce was very thin - I'll add flour or corn starch next time to thicken it up.  The blue cheese flavor was very strong for those who don't like blue cheese.

Pretty good, I added more seasonings to the chops, browned in the pan, then finished up on the grill.  I wanted the gravy to be thicker so I added some cornstarch.

I love blue cheese but this recipe was not as great as I thought it would be.  The thick cut pork chops took a while to cook and the bits in the pan became very dark affecting the overall flavor. I thought it had almost a burnt flavor.  If I made this again, I would try the standard cut pork chops to reduce the cooking time.

We really liked this. I used more bleu cheese, and added a little sour cream, like somebody else suggested. We have some left over and I'm going to use it on chicken next. Very rich but delicious.

This was seriously the easiest and most tasty pork chop meal that I have ever made!!!  It was a simple, one dish that was wonderful!  

I made the pork chops first, then sauted the mushrooms, then made the tasty sauce.

Everything turned out perfect, and it was great as leftovers too!  Thanks Toni

Honest-to-gosh, I simmered the sauce (meaning I was stuck at the stove constantly stirring the sauce) for no less than 15 minutes and by then the chops were off the grill, the potatoes were done and the broccoli was starting to get cold and yet the sauce did NOT thicken up for me. The sauce was average and I even like blue cheese. We grilled the chops and there were only two of us, but with the water-like sauce it barely clung to the chops and pretty much got all over everything else on the plate. Plus we had WAY too much leftover. A waste of a lot of blue cheese. We won't be making this again.
