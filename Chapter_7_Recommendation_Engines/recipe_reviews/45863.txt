The soup was somewhat thin, but very refreshing with a minty flavor. Instead of the whipping cream, I put a dollop of fat-free sour cream on top. I'll make this again, but will half the milk and broth. Very easy!

We made a double batch of this soup for an appetizer for my parents-in-law and grandparents-in-law, and uncle. Everybody loved it and asked for the recipe.

This was certainly inexpensive and easy to make but I found the mint flavour overpowering. I  served it hot with warm crusty rolls. Maybe when it's cool it tastes different?  Not sure if I will try again.

105 in Amarillo yesterday and this soup was perfect paired with a chilled garden vegetable sandwich prepared on hearty dark pumperknickel. Though I have no sweet tooth, I recommend a bit more sugar or even mint jelly in lieu.

Cool and refreshing, but a little thin. Maybe next time 1c of heavy cream instead of 2.5c milk? I was missing some "body".
