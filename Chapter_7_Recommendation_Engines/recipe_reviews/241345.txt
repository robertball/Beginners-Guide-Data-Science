I loved the look of the recipe but had to "adjust" according to my stock on hand. I used 1/2 c butter instead of almond milk and left out the cocoanut and almonds. It took only 25 minutes to cook.  Delicious!! Perfect snack for my granddaughter!

Delicious. I had everything but was unable to find the  dry-roasted cocoa almonds so I got some dark chocolate covered almonds from the bulk bins and chopped them up. I lined the pan with foil and lifted the whole thing out to cut... made for neater squares. I made a double batch in a 13 X 9 pan and baked for 35 minutes

I thought this recipe was pretty good My only complaint is the cooking time was way off for me they were over cooked baking for 40 minutes i will try them again but only baking them for 20-25 minutes. ...
