Cottage cheese just didn't do it. Then I used Ricotta cheese and it made a world of difference.

I really liked this.  I used fresh spinach and put it in with the noodles to wilt right before draining the boiling water. I used freshly grind pepper and some salt. next time I will add some diced up cooked bacon for added flavor. THX

I liked this dish A LOT..  The spinach and the cheese together was great!  It was a very easy meal to make, took very little time, and the clean up was also very easy..  I used another user's suggestion and went with ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. 

I put slices of well-seasoned grilled chicken with it, and it was delicious! 

Will definitely make again!

I thought that this was a very good quick supper dish but that it could have benefited from a bit more seasoning.  I used large curd cottage cheese and heated it slightly with the drained pasta and spinach until it was soft and gooey - almost like biting into a small piece of soft mozzarella - also added freshly ground pepper, salt, and a sprinkling of nutmeg to resemble the taste of spinach lasagna.  I took the photo before I remembered to top the pasta with parmesan cheese...

I LOVED this recipe. I made it last week exactly the way the recipe was written. I understand that there are some people who don't like cottage cheese, so they substitute ricotta. I did not because I love cottage cheese. I made no substitutions in this recipe the first time I made it. It was delicious, fast and easy! I am keeping this and will make it again and again. Thanks for a great recipe!! I made this again for dinner tonight. I did do a couple of add-ins. I added one can of chicken (no broth) and some bacon bits. I wanted to up the protein  and use it as a main dish not a side dish. I think next time I will also add in some sun-dried tomatoes. I love the way spinach and sun-dried tomatoes taste together. This is an awesome recipe that lends itself to deliciousness with or without extras.  Bon Appetite!

I wouldnt call this one of my favorite recipes...but it was tasty.  Its great because its packed with protein and iron.  I recommend putting in a little more garlic than recommended...maybe about 5-6 cloves.

I loved this very simple recipe! My only modifications are for my own personal tastes; I added a tad more garlic just because, and doubled the spinach because I'm a spinach lover. The cottage cheese adds a lovely touch! Wonderful!

Great recipe.  I didn't think that the dish is too bland as others have stated. I used bow-tie pasta instead of the egg noodles and thought it was really good.  Obviously, you can doctor the base recipe to your own taste, but I think the base is really good, as is.

This is an excellent base recipe.  I followed other posters' recommendations and used ricotta i/o cottage cheese.  I also added onions, mushrooms, bacon bits, basil and an extra garlic clove.  (One of my kids can't stand spinach, hence the bacon bits.)  A hit with the family.

This was quite a good recipe; quick, easy, and the perfect way to use egg noodles. Tastes good hot and cold. I just wish there was a way to make the spinach stay crisp. I suppose if you don't try to cook it with garlic... I will definitely make this one again.

This recipe is not something I would serve to dinner guests, but it's a great quick meal that my 2-year old loves.  I think the next time we make I will add a touch of grated nutmeg (always perks up a spinach dish) and maybe a splash of lemon juice as I think a little bit of acid would really brighten up the flavors.

After a few modifications, this was definitely a 5 star recipe. As previous reviewers suggested, I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I used minced garlic, and as suggested, increased the amount to approximately 5 or 6 cloves (in my family, you can never have too much garlic!) In addition, I used an italian shredded cheese blend instead of just parmesan.

This dish it a bit plain as is. I also substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese. I have also tried adding additional garlic (about three cloves), some black pepper, and a dash of salt. I topped it with some crumbled feta and thought it was much better than the first time I made it.

This was pretty bland as is, and I even added way more garlic than called for. I added a good bit of salt and pepper, and even some basil when I tasted it, but it needs much more. I think baking it with more seasonings and mozzarella cheese is about all that could save it.

I love spinach and am always keen to try dishes that use it. I did make a few changes to suit my taste. I cooked a few slices of bacon and then sauted diced onion and doubled the garlic amount in the bacon grease. I added the spinach and heated it up. I also used rigatoni pasta as that was all I had. It was very tasty and made for a quick dinner!

I used part-skim ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  To really brighten up this dish, add some grated lemon zest and a little juice.  It really makes a difference. Oh, and a little freshly ground nutmeg.

Super easy. Are used whole wheat egg noodles, and pureed the cottage cheese to make it a little smoother. Plus I added some black pepper. My picky girls loved it!

We enjoyed it. We used only 1 T of oil, a bit more garlic and made sure to salt and pepper it. It's a recipe we'll use again.

As other reviewers suggested, I added a few things to boost the flavor.  I added fresh mushrooms and some crisp bacon, but overall it was still missing "something."  It was easy to put together, but just didn't have any depth of flavor.  I think the egg noodles were a bit heavy for this dish, and it might possibly improve the taste to go with a lighter pasta such as linguini.  Not a hit with our family, so I probably won't make again.

I was really looking forward to trying this but it was so bland! I used ricotta and fresh spinach.  Very disappointing.  It tasted better when I added marinara to it.

Delicious!  I added a dash of red pepper flakes.  That was the only change.  Hubby was not excited to try it, but once he did he loved it so much that he is taking the leftovers for lunch!

Might add some additional veggies for flavor, thinking something tangy.  Nice recipe, easy to throw together.  Will make again, but might make small changes.

For Meatless Monday dinner, I made this Spinach Cheese Pasta. I cut the recipe in half and substituted part-skim ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese. Turned out good. Will surely make it again.

This is what it is. IOWS, pasta, spinach and cheese. Nothing special, nothing grand. At the same time, nothing wrong with it, either. I make it occasionally for lunch and dinner (adding a Tbls. of unsalted Butter) because I like spinach a lot, I always have pasta on hand, and cottage cheese is supposed to be better for you than Ricotta (except that Ricotta makes almost everything taste better, lol). I've also made it for breakfast at least twice. Just transfer all of the above to a greased skillet, scramble a couple of eggs (2-3) the way you usually do (adding a bit of water, milk, 1/2-and-1/2 or heavy cream, etc.) and pour the eggs over them. Cook over medium heat until the eggs are cooked to your preferred consistency and enjoy.

I made this for the second time today - I enjoyed it the first time around but did think it could use a bit more seasoning in addition to the garlic.   Added a splash of lemon juice and chopped fresh oregano...and I used gluten-free pasta for a tasty and nutritious lunch with iron and protein.

We loved this dish.  I used a little more garlic and penne pasta instead of egg noodles.  I also buttered the noodles a little before tossing with the spinach and salted and peppered the whole thing.  Delicious.  My vegetarian daughter requested a big pot to take back to college with her to share with her friends.  Definitely adding to our regular menu rotation.
