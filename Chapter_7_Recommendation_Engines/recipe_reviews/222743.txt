I just made this a few minutes ago, and I'm giving it a 4* review with the idea that I'll come back and rate it later after it has rested for a couple of days. For the measurement, I rough chopped the dandelions and then really packed them in, as if it were basil in a traditional pesto. If you don't mind a little bitterness, it is good. I'm thinking of using it as a marinade on lamb.

It was way too bitter. I saw someone online cuts dandelion with honey so I tried that but it's still way too bitter. I was thinking of using it on pasta as a pesto.
