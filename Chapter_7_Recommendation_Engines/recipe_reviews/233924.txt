This is a terrific marinade for chicken.  I prepared exactly as written and used thin chicken cutlets, hubby grilled them to crispy perfection!  If you haven't tried five spice before, it's reminiscent of jerk seasoning, some licorice in the background, so if you don't like those flavors, this one may not be for you.  But for us, a keeper!  Thanks for sharing with AR.

I followed the recipe exactly, including serving it with the “Quick Chinese-Style Vermicelli” on this site as the submitter recommended.  The two recipes complimented each other perfectly.  I sliced the chicken very thinly, marinating it only one hour which was enough to impart great flavor.   We loved it.
