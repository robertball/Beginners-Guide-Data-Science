Delicious - my dinner guests last night loved it!  But whoops - I used all 5 T. butter in the sauce and none in the topping.  Didn't even realize it until just now :-)  Other (purposeful) modifications included:  fresh green beans partially cooked and shocked, just breadcrumbs on top of grated cheese, and only 1/2 t. sugar.  Will definitely make again, and again, and again...

I enjoyed this because it was a new and interesting way of making green beans, however, they seemed to be missing something.  Not one of my favorites.

I rated this as I did because I make adjustments to the recipe.  I can't remember when I didn't make this caserole.  I make a few changes though.  I make it in a 9 x 13 glass pan and I double the sour cream topping.  I don't double beans though.  Make sure you use french cut canned grean beans.  Makes a WORLD of difference!!!

My mom has made this recipe every Tgiving since I was a kid and I made it this year at my own -- it's always a hit. I can't imagine it with canned beans. I would recommend frozen French cut green beans instead of canned and a little less butter. Very rich and very yummy!

The bean part was okay, but we liked the cereal topping most.  'Kind of the usual creamy base to green bean casserole.  Oh, I used cheddar.  Maybe it would rate higher with swiss.

I have to admit green beans are not my favorite vegetable, probably stems from my Mom burning the  out of them each and every time she made them when I was a kid. Anyway, I had purchased a bag of frozen Italian green beans by mistake and went searching for a way to use them. This recipe made them seem very palatable! Since my husband is on a low carb kick, I made a few modifications for that eating preference:  using flaxseed meal instead of flour, Truvia instead of sugar and crushed up pork rinds instead of cornflakes. He really liked it, I however am still on the fence about green beans. Thank you Christine for sharing this recipe and giving me a new way to prepare green beans!

I made this last Thanksgiving and forgot to rate it until now.  I left out the salt, thinking it wouldn't need it with the butter and cheese, but it needed it!  First bite was very bland, but when I added salt to my serving it made a huge difference.  Nice change from the usual green bean casserole -- will definitely make again.

Yummy yummy yummy! I have been looking for a green bean cassarole that is a little different. I really liked this version. I suggest using French cut beans.

Ewwww.

I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because I'm sure some of the blame goes to the canned green beans we used.  Perhaps French style beans would have been better...I doubt it though.

Huge hit at our Thanksgiving dinner.  Only suggestion - use a little less butter in the cornflake mixture.  It was swimming in calories!

Absolute hit always!!  I have been making this dish for years. You must use Swiss cheese..no exceptions on this.  We like French cut or Italian beans better.  I also add (to taste) some wasabi powder or horseradish to the sour cream mixture.  My hubby is not a big veggie eater, but will eat a huge bowl of this.  Be creative with the toppings.  I usually use whatever box of flavored crackers we have in the pantry.

This is a holiday staple at our house.  After you eat these green beans, the old "classic" green bean casserole just doesn't make the cut.

I love this recipe because I'm not using canned 'cream of' soup.  It's very cheesy and good.  I substitute french fried onions on top for the corn flakes.

Love this recipe...it is easy (apart from having to grate all that swiss cheese!) and gets applause every time.  It is a great item for a pot luck and is my staple thanksgiving dinner contribution.

delish!  you could use any favorite cereal for the topping.  for a little less butter, omit some from the crumbs as you need the equal butter to flour ratio at the beginning of the recipe.

We all love this!  I did have to modify as I didn't have Swiss cheese nor did I have dry cereal.  I replaced the Swiss cheese with Velveeta & just did without the cereal.  It was a real HIT at dinnertime.  We even tried it on top of our mashed potatoes which was great too.  Talking about a  yummy gravy!  lol

I changed it up a bit. Instead of Swiss I use emmenthaller  or grand cru cheese and mix it all in the sauce to melt. 
Fantastic!

Delicious!!!
I disagree with reviewer from 5/26. I use no butter that the recipe calls for and it turns out great.
