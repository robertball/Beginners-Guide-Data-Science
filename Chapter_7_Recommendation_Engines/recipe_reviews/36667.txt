This recipe tastes wonderful, but looks awful.  The beans turned the white rice to a dull gray color.  Next time I think I will cook the rice separately from the beans, and then mix them together at the last minute.  This recipe also needed more salt.

This dish smelled incredible during cooking but was somehow a little bland when eaten. Not really worth the prep time.

This is really good. Use a big pot, because recipe makes a lot.

I really liked this recipe.  I did cheat and use canned black beans and added some extra cilantro-but other than that I followed the recipe.  It does make quite a bit so half the recipe if you are only feeding a couple people (unless you want lots of leftovers).

This was a very tasty recipe. The ingredients went well together for a very fresh, citrus-y taste.  I used 15 oz. canned beans, and doubled the coriander & cumin.  I can't wait to try it again with fish or chicken.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We loved this dish. I served it with broiled tilapia and steamed broccoli, and it was fabulous. I used canned black beans, which cut down preparation time significantly.

This just didn't work.  It takes far too long to prepare.  The black beans and rice is not a good combination.  Plus even at half a recipe it makes enough for ten.  Not tasty at all.

I loved this tasty side dish, however, the rice was a little gummy and I will reduce the cooking time to a total of 20 minutes the next time I make it.  It was very good, though.

This is a great recipe!  I am lazy, so I use canned beans instead, but the flavor is great.  Serve with barbequed pineapple and Jay's Jerk Chicken and your company will love you!

Faster to open a can of black beans and rinse --rice needed to cook longer, but I had the time--used only a 6oz can of pineapple and after tasting added more jalapenos for us.  Good and will make again using these adjustments.

ive made this recipe twice now.  both times i used a full can of black beans and skipped that 12 minutes of cooking time at the end, and this time i used a can of drained crushed pineapple instead of spears.  i love the flavors, and the dish looks very festive and tropical.   wonderful flavors, worth the work.  it makes ALOT.  great for dinner parties.

I didn't have jalepeno or red pepper, so I used green chiles and green pepper. I also did not have any bay leaves. I added some chili powder to kick up the spices a notch, but overall, I wasn't too impressed with this. It was good, but nothing I would rush to make again. It seemed a little too salty. I'm sure it would be better with the red pepper that I didn't have, but I would definitely play around with the spices next time as I'm not sure I liked the combo. The flavor and smell of the basmati rice was excellent though; I'd never had it before.

I really like this dish. I serve it alongside grilled kabobs of chicken, red peppers, onion, and fresh pineapple.  I marinate the chicken with some jerk seasoning.  Served with a tropical drink (preferrebly including rum!), and I feel like I'm in the Carribean!

I would cut back on the cooking time on this one, the rice got overcooked and a little mushy.  It could also use a bit more salt.  Otherwise a good side dish for caribbean cuisine.

Absolutely delish!  I made the rice with vegetable broth instead of water, and substituted a little sage and lime zest for the coriander I didn't have. This was a great base for a meal with my non-vegan boyfriend. He had pineapple grilled pork chops, I had grilled tofu chunks on top.  A definite keeper!

I was very disappointed by this recipe.  Like another reviewer said it smelled great while cooking, but ended up tasting bland.  I reduced the cooking time and it still ended up mushy.  I served it with Jay's Jerk Chicken and bbq pineapple.  I won't try this one again.

This had nice flavors in it, but it still tasted bland as though it needed more salt, and I even subbed chicken broth for half of the water!  I scaled this down to 4 servings (for two people).  Used a can of drained black beans rather than going through the process of cooking beans, and I doubled the jalapeno.  Used brown basmati and didn't experience the mushiness that some reviewers mentioned.  Served with Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs from this website.

It was good, but bland, and the recipe calls for too much water.
