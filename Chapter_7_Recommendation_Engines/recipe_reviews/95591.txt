This is fantastic!  I didn't have zucchini so I added a couple extra carrots. I added an extra can of chicken broth too to give it more liquid.  My boyfriend has already requested I make it again soon!

This soup was so good. I loved the flavors! The combination of green spinach and red tomatoes gave it alot of color and eye appeal. Will definitely make it again.

This soup was great.  I used smoky sausage that I sliced instead of sausage meat and Cajun seasoning instead of Italian.  Filling and delicious. Freezes well too for future meals.
