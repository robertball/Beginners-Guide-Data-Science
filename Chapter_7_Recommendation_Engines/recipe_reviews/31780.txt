After reading several reviews that the loaf turned out mushy, I molded the meat in the loaf pan and inverted it out onto a wire-rack to form its shape. I placed the wire-rack  on top of a foil-lined cookie sheet. This works great. It prevented the meatloaf from being soggy and it also allows the sauce to cover all the sides. As for the sauce, I replaced the brown sugar with honey. It  is a good compliment to the dijon mustard  and it helped thicken the sauce. Will definitely make this again, its very tasty.

I have been making this recipe for 3 years and just remembered that I should review it. It quite good. If you make it as is, it will come out juicy and will likely fall apart (but still taste good). I cut back on the milk and vinegar to address this. If you're interested in keeping the calories low, you can use skim milk, all white meat turkey, cut back on the breadcrumbs, and cut back the sugar (1/4 cup is enough) and it all still tastes great!

It is not fair to rate a recipe when you really did not follow it but after reading the recipe and the mainly the first two pages of reviews and making many many meatloaves over the years I had to take some tips from the posters.... so here goes.
For Modifications I used 
1 cup bread crumbs
1/4 cup balsamic
1/4 cup milk
1 tsp chopped fresh rosemary
2 garlic cloves - sauted in advance with the onions.
Used a meatloaf recipe topping that we have been using for years - it is sweet but we like it and don't have to open a can of tomatoe sauce.
For the topping I used 1/2 cup of ketchup with a good dash of worchesterchire, 2Tbsp of brown sugar and Tbsp of dijon.
Bake the meatloaf for the 1 hour as required BUT after the first half hour turn the meatloaf out of the pan onto a foil wrapped cooking pan.  The meatloaf will keep its shape and you can "glaze" it with the topping put it back in the oven and it will coat it on all sides and kind of carmelize.  Hope this helps.

This is one of those recipes you will either love or hate.  It is really different----but, I loved it!  Great use for ground turkey--which can end up bland in some recipes.  LOVED the use of fresh rosemary.  I made a few changes---I used 2 lbs. of ground turkey (just because I had it), & only 1/2 cup milk &  1 cup Italian Bread Crumbs & 1 cup plain bread.  By accident forgot to add the balsamic vinegar! I'll have to try it next time,---now I'm curious if it will be just as good with it.  Per previous reviews I halved the amount of topping.  I'm glad I did, because I thought it was just sweet enough.  However, I read the amount wrong on the Tomato Sauce and only ended up adding 1T. with the brown sugar & dijon---I'll do the same next time because I was happy with the topping.

We liked this dish a lot. For one thing, it was surprisingly moist. But that had a lot to do with the type of ground turkey we used, it had a 15% fat level. We eat a lot of ground turkey here, no beef ever, because of intolerance issues. So, we certainly know of the 99% fat free turkey products. But they tend to taste like balsa wood, frankly. Pure protein always does. If you think about it, boneless, skinless breasts (chicken or turkey) are not the stuff of a simple sauté. You have to add something, even if it’s only cheese or gravy. In fact for this dish, I’d have added about a ½ cup of grated cheese if it were built on the fat free type of turkey. We didn’t fiddle much with the recipe at all. Made it just as is. Came out very well, and the sauce is nice. It did have a vinegar flavor, though. My wife thought that just made it sweeter, but I was very aware of it. I do like balsamic vinegar, so that was OK with me. Instead of prepared Dijon Mustard we used Colman’s Mustard (the powder stuff that comes in those mustard yellow tins). It did very well, but be warned, this is not your grandma’s mustard. This stuff is spicy hot, much too hot if you’re not into spicy heat at all.

For my first turkey meatloaf, I used this recipe. It was good, but I made a couple of changes: no sugar, in fact, I left out the glaze - for my tastes, I don't need it, but Oops, I forgot the garlic (might have added a little zing, oh well, next time) I also used dried rosemary leaves (about 1 Tbsp), used only 1/2 Cup of milk, I used chopped scallions for the onions and added chopped celery. The result was a tasty loaf. Last night's turkey meatloaf was served with steamed green beans and broccoli and onion tater tots, I think I'll try to serve this meal every year on the Tuesday after Labor Day.

This has to be one of the worst recipes we've ever tried.  The sauce was much too sweet, and the consistency of the meatloaf was awful.  We had to throw the entire pan out and by then we were too disgusted to actually eat dinner.

A great meatloaf find for those of us who don't/can't eat red meat.  I have prepared this for my boyfriend and I, as well as for an office potluck and everyone just loved it.  I sometimes cut the amount of balsamic vinegar in half and used 1/4 cup of worstchester sauce to give a little stronger flavor.

Very yummy!  I reduced vinegar to 1/4 cup per other reviewers' comments and also reduced the sugar in the sauce.  Ended up cooking the meatloaf for about 90 minutes till we got a 170 degree reading on our meat thermometer.  (We are sticklers for safety! I think 160 would have been ok...)  It was great and made clean slices, no mush here!  For extra pizzazz, we lined the bottom of the pan with 5 slices of bacon-precooked slightly to reduce fat.  Mmmmmmm!  Fed the 2 of us with a green salad for 3 days with a little left over to nibble on.  (we're small eaters. :)  Thanks!

I have made this in numerous occasions, using ground turkey, but now I am sodium restricted and make this meatloaf with salt free breadcrumbs and salt free tomato sauce and omit the sale.  You would not know the difference at all.  This is a fantastic meatloaf.  Thanks again.

My husband liked this meatloaf a lot and so did I. He couldn't even tell it was turkey. He commented most pleasantly on the sauce that tops the loaf. When I mixed up the sauce it made a little too much volume for me. I would think you could half it and still have plenty.

I rated this recipe a 5 because the combination of flavors was unique and different than most the ones I found.  I reduced the milk to 1/4 milk because I'd had experience with turkey before and it did crumble.  I had to leave out the bread too for a gluten-free person. I do approve it without those ingredients and don't feel the bread or more milk would have changed the flavors and that's a 5. (I hear though another gluten-free variation you could leave all the liquid ingredients in and go for gluten-free oats?).

as the aroma went through the kitchen, into the living room, my son yells to me and says sweetly, "Mom, whatever you are cooking- I am eating" Needless to say, 6 year ols boys are not easy to please. He fell in love with this on the spot. I changed quit a few things. I used 1 cup bread crumbs 1 cup rolled oats. 2 eggs. 1/2 cup milk. 1/4 cup balsamic. 3 cloves of garlic. For the sauce...1/8 to 1/4 cup brown sugar 1-2 tbls dijon. With the changes I made to this recipe, it was out of site! Stayed together, moist and flavorful. My husband, son and I loved it!

Most of the recipes from this website turn out fabulous. Not so with this one.
I had the chance to eat dinner before my husband came home so I was able to spare him the "yuck" factor. Disposed of it and made him an omelet in a hurry.

This is a different taste than the traditional meatlaof. I made cupcake sized meatloafs (in a muffin pan) and they were moist...I did cut the milk a bit. This was different and I may make I again if I am in the mood for a nontraditional meatloaf.

This was an excellent meatloaf.  I loved the moistness provided by the bread crumbs and milk and the addition of balsamic vinegar was perfect.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any fresh rosemary available, so I used dried.  Next time I'll definitely make sure to have the fresh stuff, because we didn't get much of a rosemary flavor.  The topping was phenomenal!  At first, I thought there was way too much topping and I was worried the sugar in it was going to burn (I usually top my meatloaf for only the last 15 minutes of baking), but this mixture thickened up beautifully and didn't burn, even around the edges.  I can't wait to try this again with fresh rosemary.  Thanks, MICKQ, for a great recipe!

Really lovely!  I made the night before and left it in the fridge.  I had a red pepper and fresh parsley on hand, chopped both up, and added them.  I wouldn't make it any other way!

My boyfriend and I thought this recipe was delicious! I read the reviews before making it and since a lot of people said it was "mushy" I just used less liquids. Turned out great! I have to say this is the best Turkey Meatloaf that I have made and will definitely make again! The flavours are fabulous! Do try this recipe, just add less liquids and it will turn out great, you won't be disappointed! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This is the best turkey meatloaf recipe our family has found. There are just a few tweaks we do to it: 1) omit the milk 2) use half the bread crumbs 3) add 2 TBS olive oil for more moistness

My family loves anything with rosemary, and this recipe was quickly added to our list.  Even my 3-year-old enjoyed it!  The sweet topping complimented the rosemary spice very well.  I served it with candied baby carrots, baked potatoes, and a salad.  A very filling meal--we had lots leftover!  Thanks so much!!
A couple tips:  I used my hands to mix all the ingredients together (sounds gross, but worked better than a spoon).  I also put a cookie sheet on the rack beneath the loaf pan to catch spills (the ingredients filled my pan to the top!).  Enjoy!

I loved this turkey loaf!  With that being said I must say I love rosemary, while my family-not so much.   I probably won't be able to make it again just for that reason, but if you enjoy the flavor of rosemary go ahead and make this recipe, you won't be disappointed (if you follow the recipe!).  Oh, by the way,  my meatloaf took about 75 minutes to cook completely.

This is a delicious meat loaf!  It does have strong/bold flavors in it, so you DO really have to like rosemary, balsamic vinegar and Dijon mustard.  My 1 year old even ate this, and he doesn't like meat very much!  My husband loved it too :)

I would give 5 stars after my tweeks.  The original recipe had too much fresh rosemary and too much sugar in the sauce.  I loved the combinations in flavors and my daughter loved the 2nd go around where I cut the above mentioned by more than 1/2.

I really liked this.  The only change I made was that I didn't cook it in a loaf pan to avoid the mushiness that others reported.  The taste was very good but I think I might cut back on the vinegar by about half next time.

PACKED WITH FLAVOR! I followed the recipe nearly to a T except I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, 1 tbsp of rosemary instead of 1.5, 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1 and only 1/4 tsp of salt.  If you are using seasoned breadcrumbs, I think you can omit the salt altogether.  I didn't pre-cook the onions - I just made sure to cut them finely.  They were fine in the end.

I cooked it for 1.5 hours.  The bottom part of it was a bit mushy (hence the 4 stars) so I probably could have cooked it a bit longer.  I noticed that it seemed to firm up over time after it came out of the oven. Since it had a fantastic flavor, I will try this recipe again with more modifications to see if I can get the consistency right.

This was absolutely delicious!  I had to increase the cooking time to 80 minutes, but that might be due to living in Colorado.  I found a red onion complemented the sweet taste.  A must try!

I didn't think this was too sweet at all.  The only thing that made it sweet was the topping, which could be adjusted by the amount of brown sugar added, but I thought it was very complimentary to the taste of the meatloaf.  The first time I made it, I used my pampered chef adjustable measuring cup (found out not too good with liquids) and I must of added nearly a full cup of balsamic vinegar.  I came out with a lovely meat mush instead of a meat loaf.  But the second time I got it right, and I'm definately keeping this recipe.  A little garlic salt for seasoning and viola!  Next time I think I'll make two and freeze one (It's just that good!!)  Very yummy and easy to make.

Wow, I have a lot to say.  First of all, I only used 1 T of fresh Rosemary for the meatloaf and 1/2 C of brown sugar in the topping to 2 # of ground turkey.  (I also decreased the milk and balsamic vinegar by half).  RESULTS:  I thought the meatloaf was too "rosemary-ie" but loved the meatloaf topping.  (And I love Rosemary!!!) Hubby thought meatloaf was not spicey enough and loved the topping.  I am anxious to see what becomes of  the leftovers!!!  Who knows, I may change these reviews. To be continues!!! I hope I can be able to write another review.  FYI, we love meatloaf!!!

This recipe is great with modifications .. after reading the other reviews about too much liquid,  I eliminated the milk altogether and used about 4-5 TBSP sour cream and a little grapeseed oil instead . I also sauteed the onions and used 2 garlic cloves instead of 1 . For the breadcrumbs, I used Panko ( Japanese ) which are really crispy and added nice texture. I don't like sweet so for the sauce I mixed together ( sorry, didn't measure exact amts ) , Heinz chili sauce, Heinz 57, dijon mustard, balsamic vinegar and worcestershire sauce .  Made a really tangy topping. I cooked it in the loaf pan and it came out beautifully firm .. no mush .. cooked just over an hour .. could have used a little more cooking time as my husband found it too moist for his taste ( mind you he likes his meat quite dry ) ..
anyway, definitely will make again but with those modifications .. and you have to use fresh rosemary!

Pretty good. I didn't have any onions, so I used shallots instead. I took the advice of another member and sauteed the shallots and garlic before adding to mix. I didn't want to use milk so I just added another egg and kept the other measurments the same and I used dried rosemary. The meatloaf came out moist and held its shape well. 

Oh, I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes along with the dijon and only about t tablespoon of sugar. it turned out great! I will be making this again.

My husband was skeptical as he enjoys my regular beef Meatloaf.  He tried it and loves it more than the beed one now.  After reading some of the review I modified the recipe a little, using less milk, and less vinegar...other than I followed the rest of the recipe.  VERY GOOD!!!

This turkey recipe was delicious! I was a little alarmed at the measurements for the liquid, but I adjusted and it made for a perfect and juicy meatloaf.  Instead of 1 c and 1/2 c of milk and vinegar, I only used 1/4 cup of each. I omitted the mustard because I didn't have any on hand, but I will probably be making this again so I will add it next time. 

as for a sauce... the tomato sauce sounded gross, so here was what I used. 

I sauteed garlic and capers together in a little bit of olive oil just to get some of the raw garlic flavor out. I added in the juice of half a lemon, and a few splashes of wine. I let the alcohol cook out a bit and then added chicken broth. I added in some corn starch and whisked it in and let it boil until it was thick. It was delicious and it really complimented the turkey.

This recipe is WAY too wet! I used it by the book and the milk should have been cut in half plus the vinegar. The sauce on top as well should only be 4oz and the sugar and mustard the same. I will never prepare this like this again. It's a mess.

This was a big hit.  I used the suggestion of another user and used 85/15% fat ground turkey.  The meatloaf was tender and juicy.  The brown sugar in the sauce made a nice crisp and sweet topping.  I also added chopped button mushrooms into the meat mixture.

Healthy and delicous and SUPER EASY! Edits: only 1/2 cup milk, 4 cloves garlic. Sauteed onion and garlic before mixing it in. Mixed half of the sauce with the meatloaf itself and poured the other half on top. Instead of tomato sauce used mushroom spaghetti sauce. YUM!

This was pretty good. I used 1.32lbs of ground turkey, half the milk and bread crumbs. I bought the garlic but forgot to use it and used thyme instead of rosemary bc I could not find any and it was good. I did not think it was mushy but next time I will go easy on the sugar and a little less vinegar. Otherwise it was great.  I served mine with a steamed mix of squash, onions and mushrioms. Its just about what you prefer, easy prep, great taste.

recipe was perfect! i also made a few changes...substituted 1 cup of the bread crumbs for cup of lipton golden onion soup mix,cut the vinegar down to 1/4 cup,and used cranberry dijon mustard for the glaze. i also suggest putting the rosemary in a food processor to make it more fine.

This was a really good recipe. The loaf was a bit mushy for my liking. I also used 2 lbs of ground turkey instead of the 1 1/2 lbs. I kept the other ingredients the same. My husband loved it, which is amazing since he is not a meat loaf fan! The sauce is the best part. I will definately make this again!

It was so good! I took a little advice and used 1 cup of rolled oats instead and 3/4 a cup of bread crumbs. I added green onion as well and sauted the onions and garlic. I also used 2 cloves of garlic as well. For my side dish I had yellow potatoes roasted with olive oil,salt,and pepper.   Oh and I'd scratch the tomato sauce and stick with ketchup.

Did not like this at all.  I kept to the original recipe.  All you could taste was the balsamic vinegar.  If you got past that taste,  then the next thing you notice is it's mushy.  Too much bread crumb and milk as some previous posters suggested.  Will try again with some of the suggested modifications, maybe.  Might just toss it.

I made this for company last night and servd it with rosemary/garlic mashed potatoes and thyme green beans.  It was so good.  I can't say enough about this recipe.  The only thing I changed was the addition of some chopped sundried tomatoes as mentioned by some other reviewers.  Very lean and moist!!

We found this to be a very tasty meatloaf.  I followed the recipe except I added some chopped sun-dried tomatoes I had on hand.  We realy like the flavor of Rosemary so I will be making this one again.

This is now my favorite meatloaf recipe, with (of course) a few adjustments. I prefer quick cooking oats to breadcrumbs, so I use those instead. For the sauce, I use 1/3 cup catsup, 1-2 tbs brown sugar, and 1-2 tbs Dijon mustard. I don't add the sauce until the meatloaf has cooked for about 1/2 hour. Then I pour off the fat, turn the meatloaf over onto a baking dish, slather the sauce all over it, and finish cooking. I think the addition of balsamic vinegar, plus the fresh rosemary, is what really sets this meatloaf apart. Great recipe!!

Followed this to the letter when I should have done what my gut said to. 

I would recommend half the breadcrumbs, only a quarter cup of balsamic vinegar, add a quarter cup of Worcestershire's sauce, skip the milk and the egg all together. Half the sauce and you could use  honey instead of brown sugar.

Over all I found this recipe disappointing and the next time I think about making turkey meatloaf I will use my beef recipe (but substitute the turkey)

pretty tasty! I read the other reviews and saw that it could be runny, so i cut down on alot of the liquids and it was still slightly runny.  It'll take a little more modification but its worth trying again!

A great recipe.  We've cut back on red meat, but I was tired of making turkey burgers. Meatloaf is one of our family favorites, so I thought I'd give this one a try. It was the best meatloaf we've ever had. It was flavorful and juicy, even though I didn't use all of the milk. The glaze on top was yummy.  I also added fresh basil, (since I have a gigantic basil plant). I am recommending this one to all of my friends.

This was good, didn't need the milk at all. Also, used less sugar in the topping.

I have to say, this recipe just didn't do it for me.  My daughter has given up red meat so I am looking for some new entrees to try.  It was too soft and I didn't care for the combination of seasonings.  I did like the topping, which could be used with other meatloafs.  I say pass on this one.

Absolutely delicious!  I knew right away that it was going to be good since the aroma coming from the oven was awesome.  I didn't have enough room in my loaf pan for the sauce, so I just made it on top of the stove and poured it on the meatloaf after I sliced it.  This will definitely be a family favorite.

Delicious! My picky 12-year-old called it "the best meatloaf you've ever made, mom." I added garlic and a teaspoon of beef bouillon for extra flavor. Also, next time I will reduce the liquids slightly because it was too soft and mushy to slice. Thanks for a great recipe.

I hate to cook and my kids hate my food (instant & microwaved).  My ENTIRE family loved this meatloaf because it was easy to make, delicious, and had enough to provide everyone with second helpings.  Thank you, Tim, for a wonderful meal!

This is a great meatloaf with modifications.  There are WAY too many bread crumbs and too much sauce.  Too much sugar as well.  I like the ingredients, the measurements are just off.

With just a couple modifications, this is an outstanding dish.  Reduce the bread crumbs to 1 1/2 cups and as others have suggested, reduce the milk, balsamic and brown sugar to 1/4 cup each.  I added a sprig of rosemary on top of the sauce for added flavor and garnish.

I managed to avoid the mushiness using a wire rack and cutting out some of the milk,  The rosemary is overpowering and it is just far too sweet.  
If i tried it again, I would cut out the brown sugar entirely and half the rosemary.

Followed the recipe exactly ingredient wise, but cooked it on a wire rack after molding as suggested. The rosemary flavor was just too overpowering.

this was an amazing meatloaf. i used dried rosemary instead of fresh. my mistake! i used the amount it said(with the dried herb), it should have been alot less! also, i didn't cut the leaves up and we kept getting them in each bite. again, this was my mistake not the creator's.  we will definately make this again but with less (and cut up) dried rosemary! it tasted great (other than my mistakes!)

This was my first time making any type of meatloaf and it was great! I read a few of the reviews on the first page and made some adjustments accordingly. I had 1 1/4 lbs of ground turkey on hand, so I used a little more than 1 c. of bread crumbs, 1/2 c. of milk, about 1/3 c. of balsamic vinegar and about 1 tbsp of dried rosemary. I chose to saute the garlic & onions beforehand so they wouldn't be too overpowering. For the sauce I just eyeballed this and substituted ketchup for the tomato sauce. I might like to try honey next time instead of the brown sugar as one of the other reviewers suggested because the consistency of the sauce wasn't as smooth as I would have liked. All in all, this was a great recipe and I will definitely make again!

This is my go-to meatloaf recipe.  I've made it for family members on diets (and told them to limit the sauce) and everyone is surprized how flavorful it is.  It's often a little too soft, but no one here minds.

This is the first time making Turkey meatloaf.  My husband loves meatloaf but I don't eat beef or pork.  I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I didn't use it - apparently I wasn't missing much!  I also didn't have fresh rosemary so I used the thyme and oregano I had in my herb garden.  We absolutely loved it.

This is a fantastic recipe!! I only used one pound of ground turkey because for whatever reason my local grocery store was only selling 1 lb packages and 2 lb packages...so I went with the 1 lb. I also added a cup of chopped green onions to this. After reading the reviews, I made a few other changes: 1) I used one cup of bread crumbs instead of two 2) I only used half of a red onion 3) I cut the milk and balsamic vinegar amounts in half 4)I only used 1/4 cup brown sugar for the topping. I also baked it for an hour after reading the reviews, and it turned out beautifully! Full of flavor, held it's form, and wasn't mushy at all. It's a keeper!!

Ok, I admit it, I tried to make Rosemary Turkey Meatloaf but I did not add rosemary.  I did not have it in the house.  I also forgot to add the garlic.  Although garlic is listed in the ingredients, it is not listed in the directions and I mistakenly forgot to add.  As a result, the recipe was pretty boring.  I did not care for the crunchy onions - I would recommend sauteing first. Although I feel this recipe deserved 2 stars as made, I will give 3 because of my 2 omisions.  I can't imagine the 2 missing ingredients could have won we over on this one however. Not a redo.

This turkey meatloaf is delicious!  I doubled the fresh rosemary and also added 2 TBS chopped fresh parsley that I had on hand.  I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of plain.  I will definitely make this one again.

I learned from all of you!  I made some modifications to the recipe and it came out a 'five.'  First of all, I skipped the milk entirely, and I only used 2 teaspoons of rosemary.  For the topping I only used one third cup of brown sugar.
It came out NOT mushy, but not too firm, and the topping was only moderately sweet, certainly not as disgusting as other people have described it.  The rosemary taste was quite noticeable, but not in any way overwhelming.  I liked it!

This was a real disappointment.  I love meatloaf, particularly turkey meatloaf as it tends to be less greasy.  This recipe, however was definitely an exception.  It was mushy instead of moist.  The balsamic vinegar was a nice touch, but it was completely overwhelmed by the painfully sweet suace over the top.  Perhaps with a lot of tweaking, this recipe could be improved, but I will not be making it again "as is".

This was awful.  The rosemary was overpowering and the sauce way too sweet. We couldn't even eat it.  Ate a bowl of cereal instead.

I loved the taste, but as others have said, it is mushy.  After cooking 1 hour I was left wondering if it was done because of the "mush", so I cooked it an additional 30 min.  Next time I will use less milk and more bread crumbs.  I used Italian bread crumbs first time around and will continue to do so.

we didn't like the consistency of ground turkey in a meatloaf; very mushy. also used too much dried rosemary which threw it off. it's the only recipe i've made from this site that we didn't finish.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous! I must have in the recipe book!  It did not dry out at all and the sauce on top was sooo good.  I think the rosemary and balsamic vinegar is what makes the recipe so yummy!  I was amazed and looking forward to the left overs!  Great job Tim!!

I enjoyed this alot, although my husband enjoyed it even more. It had a bit too much rosemary for my taste (next time I would cut it down a tad). I also cut down on the sugar in the glaze (not much of a sweettooth in me), and it was definitely the best part of the meal... caramalized and flavorful without being overwhelming. I alway buy tomato sauce that contains no sugar, though, so perhaps check your labels to see if your tomato sauce has sugar, and adjust accordingly. May explain some who thought the sauce was overly sweet.

The meatloaf was fine.  The recipe for the sauce was REALLY good.  I only spread a little on top of the meatloaf and kept the rest in a small bowl as dipping sauce after the meatloaf was cooked.  Yum!

This recipe was a HUGE hit with my fiance, who is always asking me to make healthier meals. It was very simple to make, but you'd never know it by the flavor! I made a few substitutions and changes: I omitted the milk altogether; I substituted regular brown sugar with Splenda brown sugar; I used garlic salt instead of regular salt, and I used onion & garlic flavored tomato sauce. I also added green pepper, though next time I think I will cook that and the onion in a skillet first because they didn't soften much in the oven. Even so, my fiance must have complimented me on this loaf at least half a dozen times! This is a truly delicious meatloaf that I will make many more times! Thank you Tim!

Delicious!!  I made a batch of this recipe with minced pork (because I can't get organic turkey mince.)  Based on some other reviews, I halved the amount of balsamic vinegar.  I don't think I missed it, but I might try the whole lot next time, to see what it's like.  I also effectively doubled the eggs (because I made a half batch and didn't want half a beaten egg sitting in my fridge).  I left the topping off (because I don't get the American fascination with sweet gooey sauce on top of meatloaf; I like the crispy crust!) - and it was just gorgeous!!  It had a smooth, velvety texture and was stodgy in all the right ways.  Very comforting!  I was worried that the flavours might be too different for my very picky boyfriend, but he loved it so much he claimed the leftovers for himself for lunch today!  Will definitely become a regular menu item for us.  The only thing I would do differently is to line the loaf tin with baking paper next time - my tin is old, and not non-stick or anything.  The loaf stuck a little round the edges and that's just wasteful!!  ;)  
UPDATE: I definitely prefer it with half the balsamic vinegar.  Gives a mellow roundness to the flavour without being intrusive.

I only made 1 change in this recipe.  Had to use up ground pork after Hurricane Charley came through, so used it in place of the turkey.  Very good!

I absolutely loved it!  It is a little on the sweet side, but I guess you could cut down on the balsamic and the brown sugar if you are not into the sweet taste.  I substituted onion powder for the onion and used 4C seasoned bread crumbs to add more flavor.

This took more like an hour and a half to cook and did not have meatloaf consistency. The flavor is fine but it's more like meat pudding or jello or something. Gross...

I rarely rate a recipe but feel I need to do so on this.  It would have been inedible aside from covering it in hot sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was awful.  Too many breadcrumbs that absorbed the vinegar and made it mushy and the predominate flavor is vinegar. I'm sure with changes, this could be a decent recipe, however, there are so many excellent meatloaf recipes out there (and all can be substituted with turkey or chicken) so I would pass on this for sure!

Literally just finished eating this. I will say this is a unique meatloaf recipe. I enjoyed it but if you dont like rosemary this one is not for you. I made it just like the recipe calls for. By accident I made this in a 1 inch deep pyrex and it seemed to solve the mushyness that some reviews say because I dont own a loaf pan. PS this paired well with a cider.

pretty good!  rosemary was a little overpowering and would probably omit that next time.  also, I took others' suggestions and used honey instead of brown suger and ketchup instead of tomatoes for a creamier consistency. was a little too sweet so may try the tomato suace with honey next time.  cooked in 1 hour and wasn't dried out - will make again!

This was the best turkey meatloaf my family and I have ever had!  Fresh rosemary is a must.  I added a little more panko when I noticed the mix was on the liquidy side.

Im not sure if maybe I didnt use enough turkey but all i could taste was the Rosemary and it had the consistency of stuffing...I found it kind of gross and I would not make it again.  If I did make it again I would not put the brown sugar in the topping as the sweetness did not help at all.

The flavor was good, but the vinegar was very strong. My husband didn't seem to notice, but it was overpowering to me. I think next time I'll cut it back quite a bit and make more sauce - the sauce was really great!

I am a lifelong MEATLOAF HATER and I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! It is pure comfort food to me. Thanks a million for this recipe. I have made it several times and everyone loves it. I use Pampered Chef's Rosemary seasoning instead of straight rosemary. I have used tomato paste when I was without tomato sauce (with only 1/2 cup brown sugar and a little extra water) and it has still been fabulous!

This might have worked better for me if I had gone with my gut and reduced the amount of balsamic and milk. The balsamic flavor was very dominant, and I've never heard of using milk in a meatloaf before this.   I don't advise substituting ketchup for the sauce. If you're short on the sauce ingredients, go without - there's plenty of flavor and moist going on without it.  I served this with mashed potatoes with leek and carrots, which worked pretty well as far as firsts go. My BF ate three servings of the meatloaf so it must not have been too bad.

My wife just raved about this meatloaf. She rarely eats more then one meal of my traditional turkey meatloaf. She usually complains about how dry it is, but this meatloaf was incredibly moist. I was surprised by the addition of the balsamic vinegar. You definitely want to make extra sauce to top the slices. It was excellent as a sandwich on slices of toasted rosemary bread.

I would give this a 5 star as it relates to converting a traditional meatloaf into a healty version...however...my family left bits behind and said it was "strange tasting".  I make a lemon rosemary chicken on the grill that we all love so would make my grilled chicken over this in the future.

Best meatloaf I have ever tasted.  Loved it.  Will definately make again.  I made it for my hubby, son, his friend, me, and my grandbaby.  No Leftovers to be found.  My son was licking the pan I cooked it in.  Thanks for posting

The rosemary gave it great flavor, but the sauce was just too sweet and not for me and the family. Will definitely make again, but with mods to the sauce.

This was great.  My husband said it was like eating candy.  I did add green and red peppers because I had a frozen mix with onions.  I didn't have any tomato sauce but had tomato paste so I add water to the paste.  I also used Splendia brown sugar.  It was great.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great guilt-free meatloaf! You couldn't really tell it was turkey. The sauce was perfect. I followed the recipe exactly except that my loaf pan wasn't big enough so I used a square 8x8 glass baking dish, which turned out fine. I had to cook it for 1 hr 15 min to get the loaf to 165 degrees. I will definitely make this again!

This wasn't as good I had hoped it would be-very bland. I love rosemary & balsamic vinegar so I was excited to try this recipe. I'm going to try it again with a package on onion soup mix mixed in and make a thicker topping.

Wasn't as fabulous as I wanted it to be. It was a tad bit too sweet for my taste. I would recommend using less brown sugar.  I also forgot to add the garlic.  It's mentioned in the ingredients, but not the directions.

My husband is a big fan of meatloaf.  He LOVED this and couldn't tell it wasn't beef.  I left out the egg and made the sauce with tomato paste instead of tomato sauce which gave it a thicker consistency - very yummy.

This was a good recipe. I thought that the vinegar was a little overpowering so next time I will cut it in half. The fresh rosemary was wonderful. It was very flavorful and aromatic.

For my first Turkey Loaf this one was not bad. I did not have all the ingredients (balsamic vinegar and brown sugar) but the rosemary alone was flavorful enough .

Pretty good.  As other reviewers have said, it was a bit mushy.  Next time I would cut down on the milk, but the balsamic vinegar gave it a really interesting taste and made it more than just another meatloaf.  

I omitted the sugar from the topping, and made the loaf in an 8'x8' pan, but otherwise follwed the recipe.  The topping was good without the sugar, but I am not a fan of sweet and savory together.

It took about an hour to cook and could have stood up to longer cooking time, in my opinion.  Looking forward to trying out the leftovers though!

I love this recipe and so does my boyfriend.  I have made this a few times and make a couple small adjustments.  I think a whole onion is a little much, so I use about 2/3 and onion.  I use 1/2 the amt of balsalmic and make up the rest with worchestershire.  I use 1/2 the amt of milk and only make 1/2 the sauce.  I would like to try a few more vegetables in this, so I might try celery next time.  Sometimes, when I am really hungry I'll half it into two loaf pans so it cooks a little faster.  Can even do it in the toaster oven to not heat up the house and use less energy!

It's a keeper!

This was pretty good to my surprise as I am trying different ground turkey recipes to replace beef. This had really good flavor but I will add less milk next time.

I made this today and have to say I enjoyed the recipe alot.

I also added a little Worchester sauce and Parmasean cheese to the meat before I formed the loaf.Saltine crackers to top it off after about an hour of baking with a little more Parmasean cheese topped with the sauce.

However,I did make the sauce and put it in the fridge for a bit.I added basil and a little more garlic to the sauce.


First time making meatloaf and not the last,especially with some garlic mashed potatoes to top it off.Broccoli for veggies is nice too.

Thanks!

I scaled everything to 1 pound of turkey and had to sub dried rosemary-- unfortunately I used a bit too much and the flavor was overwhelming. Still, even if I'd not overdone it, this was still really rich-tasting. I only did 1/4 tsp of salt. I found the mixture to be really goopy and I had to add extra breadcrumbs to hold it all together. I liked the balsamic vinegar in there, however. I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used ketchup instead. The sauce was kind of the best part-- but I could use it on any meatloaf. Overall, this was so-so.

This recipe was fairly easy to make, and I omitted the milk and switched the spice to tarragon.  The flavor was appropriate and definitely improved with the tomato/Ragu sauce, but the consistency was still mushy, although I baked it for 20 minutes longer and used a meat thermometer.  My coworker who loves meatloaf felt the consistency was more like stuffing than of meatloaf.  We think it's because of the turkey.  I probably wouldn't make this recipe again and instead try a traditional beef meatloaf.

Four stars as described, but five with about half as much brown sugar (too sweet).  It takes a couple of pieces, though, before the sweetness becomes too much.  A keeper, for sure.

I loved this meatloaf and have already made it twice. I ran out of milk so I used 1/2 c. cottage cheese instead. I also only used 1/4 c. balsamic vinegar.  I also decreased the amount of salt to 1/2 tsp and I used ketchup to top the meatloaf, instead of the mustard mixture.  I was quite pleased with the results. The meatloaf was moist and flavorful and it was not soggy at all.  It was very good.

This meat loaf was AMAZING!  My husband hates meatloaf, for 8 years I have been trying to get him to eat it and all he says is "I hate meatloaf." I made this one night and he even ate left overs.  There is only one thing that I may change and that is the abount of milk it seemed a little much for my taste.

I love this meatloaf!  As suggested by others, I reduced the balsamic and milk. I also used oatmeal b/c I was out of bread crumbs.  Husband said it was the best meatloaf ever.  I like the sauce as it is.

This is the worst meatloaf I've ever made, and my meatloves are always great. I have never used a recipe until this time and did so only because I wanted to try new flavors in my loaf. First of all, the consistency of this thing was like pudding. I should have known better than to put milk in a meatloaf...egg and bread crumbs are enough to make it moist. As far as the topping is concerned, I'm glad I didn't add 3/4 C of sugar to the tomatoe sauce. To my credit, my boyfriend loved it,

This flavors in this recipe are great together.  Based on previous feedback, I made some adjustments:  I left out the milk and used 1.5 cups of breadcrumbs and also used only 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I also sauteed the onion first (personal preference) and used roasted garlic because I had some extra.  Served this to company with rave reviews.

Excellent recipe, everyone loved it.
Coarsely chopped onion adds texture; seasoned bread crumbs give wonderful taste. Slight modifications: instead of brown sugar (forgot to buy) I used 5 tablespoons of honey; instead of balsamic vinegar (also forgot to buy) I used the same amount of red wine vinaigrette salad dressing (Kraft or Pfeiffer brand).
Suggestions for users who did not like the taste of sauce: use bigger pan, and shape the loaf thinner (perhaps, in a few crossing "bars"); pour the sauce over the "bars" - after the loaf is ready, dispose of the sauce, and you will have salty loaf with just a thin crust of sweet tomato sauce.

I had high hopes for this recipe, a welcome change from "traditional" meatloaf. I second the reviewer who said they were too disgusted to eat. Mine also ended up in the trash.

Thanks Tim!
I made this for Sunday's meal!  The family loved it!  Was very moist, and the topping sauce was wonderful!  I was afraid it would come out mushy after reading other reviews, but I added more bread crumbs.  The balsamic gives it a kick!  This is a keeper, my 4 year old had three helpings!

My first time making meatloaf and it turned out wonderful. The flavors were perfect. I served it with homemade mac and cheese and a five bean salad.  I also cooked it a bit longer and I made it in a larger pan forming the loaf in the middle. It worked out well. Great recipe!

I love balsamic vinegar, but it just didn't taste right in this turkey loaf.  I even used less than called for.  Not bad, but since I was the only one who ate it...I won't make it again. Thanks for sharing.

The aroma as it baked was wonderful and when it hit the table it was a hit with the family.  The balsamic vinegar did the trick.  We made a slight mistake when mixing that may have affected the texture, and we did not get nice, clean slices, but it didn't matter in the end.

This was great! My 2 year old loved it as did the rest of the family. I used dried rosemary b.c I didn't have fresh. Served it with cheesy mashed potatoes, broccoli and carrots.

I followed the directions - and ugh - it came out like mush (or turkey pate), we simply could not eat it due to the texture.  Cooking it an extra 30 minutes didn't help.

This is a great recipe! I only use 1 pound of turkey, and cut the balsamic vinegar to 1/3 cup and the pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. But with these changes, it is absolutely amazing!

this is my go-to meatloaf recipe, with some minor modifications: I use 1 pkg of Ground Turkey (1-1/4 pounds) and then just measure "light" on the other ingredients.  I use italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of regular.  I use onion powder instead of chopped onion, just because I don't like "chunks" in my meatloaf.  I often use dry rosemary, but the fresh is much better when I have it on hand.  For the sauce, I use about half the recommended sugar for our personal tastes.  I cook it in muffin tins, with the foil muffin liners - cooks through in less than 30 minutes and is already portioned out!

I only had about 1/3 cup of balsamic vinegar and that was way too much and made the meatloaf mushy. I think 2tbsp would suffice. Also, the sauce was way too sweet. Still edible in small portions before feeling somewhat nauseous. The leftovers were better after sitting in the fridge to 'stiffen'. IF I do this again, I would definitely alter it somewhat.

My family and I really like this recipe. However the second time it made it I actually increased the cooking time to an hour and 20 minutes. This seemed to allow the juices cook into the loaf and came out much better compared to the first time I made it. Overall is very tasty and delicious

It's hardly fair to say i followed this recipe. I had to use 2 lbs of turkey because of the sizes the store sold and didn't want to have leftover raw turkey running around. Then, I threw in just a few baby carrots, well diced, just to sneak in a touch more veggie. Also didn't use straight breadcrumbs. I spread it between the crumbs, cornmeal, and quick oats that I cut up even further with a veggie chopper. Don't tell the husband, he didn't notice. Next time I might add celery, too. I would probably change the spice profile as this was nice but a smidge bland and flat. Something with a little heat would do better. But it was my first time making meatloaf. The overall texture was good and seemed well baked at 1 hour in my gas oven.

It's a great recap but taste more like thanksgiving stuffing. We were looking forward to homemade mama's cookin. But it took our taste buds back to November. It's a delicious recipe for something a little different than your standard meatloaf.

Made this for dinner tonight.  This recipe was so easy.  The meatloaf was very moist and flavorful. The only addition to the recipe was chopped red peppers only because I wanted to use them before they go bad.  Definitely adding this to my recipe box and will use again.

This was not terrible, but I won't be making it again.  The sauce was too sweet and the meatloaf itself pretty flavorless despite the rosemary.  The consistency was very strange, too.

I read the reviews and put some into consideration. I must say this was a very good recipe and very mosit! I was very happy and will do it again! I did not want my meatloaf to fall apart so as i read on another review i placed it on a foiled rack so it wont sit in its juices and crumble. (What i did not do was foil up the bottom of the pan so now my pan is soaking over night; bummer) i also changed the recipe just a tad bit. As someone mentioned i also used honey to replace the sugar, but for my touch a used balsamic vinegar SALAD DRESSING and mild salsa dip chunky style to replace the plain tomato sauce & added a splash of spice (about; it was done by eye) 2 tbs of HOT, hot sauce. I might add more next time cuz I did not notice it much. I will also add more onion, we are onion lovers! But I'm very excited about this recipe, I got great feedback and no leftovers! Sry forgot to take a photo

Delicious meatloaf. Because I couldn't find a 1.5 lb package of ground turkey I added some fresh ground turkey breakfast sausages (about 1.3 lb) . Added some flavor. No milk on hand so used half and half and three garlic cloves. Turned out moist and very tender. Loved the fresh rosemary flavor. Had some additional tomato topping I used when reheating. Freezes well.

This was a real good recipe for a very nice and not too fat meat loaf. Although, there are some things I will do differently when doing this meal, which is why I gave it 3 stars.

This is definitely a keeper. I decided to make this and had begun to do so, all the while forgetting my oven was out.  Watching countless episodes of Rachael Ray, I realized that I could pat the meat mixture into 7 patties and pan-fried in some canola until deep golden brown.  Remembering the mushy comments I read from others, (although I now think this is due to the fact that a loaf pan is meant for bread and not a meatloaf, I never put a meatloaf into a loaf pan, I always pat it into the shape I want and roast it on a foil lined sheet pan) I rolled the patties in add'l breadcrumbs and this helped them stay together in the pan.  I added the sauce to the pan after I was sure there wasn't too much oil left in the pan and poured in the sauce with a little water and let it reduce.  I do think the sauce could benefit from a splash of worchestshire  since the sugar in the sauce and the sweet of the balsamic in the meat needed alittle something to counterbalance. Overall I saved this recipe and will forward to friends.

This is amazing, and my picky picky daughter loves the tomato sauce.   I use way less balsamic vinegar than the recipe calls for.

I don't do the sauce on top as I don't like sweet meatloaf, but use a little dijon mustard in the loaf itself and adjust the liquid so it's meatloafy.  This is a very good recipe and a nice alternate from "traditional" meatloaf.  I've made it several times.  And it makes great sandwiches on potato bread.

I didn't use many of the ingredients as this recipe called for; I didn't use the vinegar, milk, or tomato sauce.  I used a dash of worchestershire sauce, some ketchup, one egg, and some seasonings here and there.  I made sure to keep an eye on it so it didn't get too dry and it came out great! We ate the loaf as hot meatloaf sandwiches with gravy and potatoes - sooo good! Will definitely make this again.

I thought this was very good.  It's not your "traditional" meatloaf, and I really liked the flavors the balsamic vinegar and the rosemary brought together.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a delicious meat loaf. Normally, I don't care for ground turkey meat loaf, but this recipe was exceptional. I followed it to the letter except I cut back on the amount of brown sugar; I just used two tsps.

This was good but I used 2.5 lbs of ground turkey but keep everything else the same.  The sauce was a little thin but had a good flavor.  I will try ketchup in place of tomato sauce next time.

I made this meatloaf last night and loved it so much am  having it for lunch today! My husband LOVED IT as well. I would agree, you can most definitely 'half' the topping. I made the whole amount and found that I really didn't need it all....but, if you do make all, refridgerate the rest to top your leftovers! YUMMY!!! This is going to be a 'regular' on our dinner table!!THANKS!

I am trying to eat less red meat so I decided to give this meatloaf a try. It was okay - not too flavourful and was a bit mushy. maybe its because it was made with ground turkey. I think i'll stick with making meatloaf with ground beef.

Very good indeed! I'm trying to stay away from red meat but balsamic vinegar made it appear dark like red meat. I can't eat dairy products so used chicken stock instead and since I was only working with a pound of turkey, I cut down on the amount of everything but the breadcrumbs and egg. One and a half teaspoons of fresh rosemary and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar in the sauce. Very very good. Thanks

I made this for dinner and I loved it but my husband thought it was too sweet.  I will try making it again but will do as other suggested and cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup in the sauce.  I will also try bake it longer.

Best meatloaf I've had in awhile. I changed the recipe up a bit like other posters. Substitutions: 1 C bread crumbs, 1/2 C milk, 1/4 C worcestire- all other ingredients the same. 
I also inverted the loaf pan after forming meat mixture and baked it on a cookie sheet (spray the sheet-I didn't)at 375 for about an hour. I like that the topping covers all sides. DELICIOUS!

I attempted this recipe last night. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a soupy mess in the pan. The meatloaf was positively swimming from all of the liquid. If I tried it again, I would cut back on the volume of milk and balsamic vinegar to avoid meatloaf soup. In addition, I only used 2/3 of the tomato sauce mixture for the top, and I think that was even too much. Maybe diced tomatoes with a bit of liqued would be better as a base for the topping.

However, I can say that I liked the bold flavor with the rosemary and the dijon mustard.

I really enjoyed this recipe but did modify it to reduce carbs, sodium & calories.  After my first cooking I will reduce the amount of liquid in it.  Ended up pouring off at least a cup.  So I'm thinking there is no real need for the cup of milk, though I'm sure the amount of vinegar can be reduced a bit.  

This is the ingredients I used to slightly modify this original recipe.

1 1/2 pounds Ground Turkey Breast - Jennie-O All Natural Extra Lean
2 cups - 4 slices of fresh bread crumbs, Sugar Free Bread, 100% Whole Wheat by: Pepperidge Farm 
1 cup onion, chopped
1/4 cup egg substitute 
1/2 cup balsamic vinegar (might back to 1/4 cup)
1 clove garlic, minced 
1 teaspoon salt 
1 teaspoon pepper 
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary

I just "eyeballed" the measurements for these ingredients, so I'm not sure exactly how much of everything I put in. I just kept mixing until it felt like the right consistency to me.

I also realized as I was mixing up the topping sauce that I didn't have any brown sugar! I just omitted it alltogether and it came out fine-- in fact I think it would have been too sweet with the sugar. The balsamic adds enough sweetness for my taste.

Great aromas while this was cooking-- perfect for a cozy evening. 

The only reason I'm giving it a 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because it didn't blow my mind or anything. Sure, great for a meatloaf, but I reserve the 5/5 for things that rock my world. I'd give it a 4.5 out of 5 if I could, though!

Waaaaaaaay too much vinegar.  I made the mistake of hurriedly making this without first reading the reviews.  I'm not sure if I'll make this again using much less vinegar or just find a better recipe.

I was really pleased with how this turned out. My husband doesn't really like turkey but he had seconds of this. I did cut down on the balsamic and added a little worcestershire. The rosmary was a little much I thought, I would cut that down a little the next time I made it- but then again I'm a little sensitive to it for some reason. Also, only half of the sauce was necessary.

This was great! The only suggestion I would make would be to lessen the amount of topping as it was a little too sweet; otherwise this was a really good meatloaf!!!!

I had high hopes for this recipe.  I modified it a bit, leaving out the rosemary and onion, adding chopped spinach and cheese, and I added Worcestershire sauce, and reduced the balsamic vinegar amount.  Even without the flavor from the onion, the breadcrumbs overwhelmed the turkey loaf, and I could hardly taste the turkey.  I would probably do 1/4 the amount of breadcrumbs next time, and less milk.  It was too sticky.  The sauce was actually the best part.

I have to agree with the "volume" comment regarding the sauce. It really did end up being too much. And way too sweet. The places on the meatloaf where the sauce got a chance to reduce down to a paste tasted great, but that only happened on the very top of the meat.

Also, I found that the cooking time was a bit longer. Make sure to hit it with a thermometer. It should read about 165.

We LOVE this recipe!  The only change I make from the original is to mince the onion with a hand blender, but that's due to my picky eaters.  Otherwise, this is perfect the way it is.

I had high hopes for this meatloaf after reading the positive comments. The aroma was enticing as it baked, however the finished product was bad. The meatloaf stuck to the pan and had a thick crust on the bottom, just a disaster and the taste was strange.

This is such a yummy meatloaf. I love it. It holds its form wonderfully and is very flavorful. I make the topping differently (spicy!), but the loaf is the main part.

This meatloaf just tasted bizarre- the sauce was way too sweet and the rosemary seemed out of place.

well... i sent my boyfriend out to get ground turkey, and he said there was none so he bought super lean ground beef. i used that and kept everything else the same. it was awesome!! i took off one star just because i made it with different meat. i can't wait to try it with turkey, i'm sure it'll be grand.

Very moist and great taste. Didn't have rosemary, so sprinkled light amount of oregano. Used half balsamic and half worchestershire. If you don't want crunchy onions, then saute first. Used honey instead of brown sugar.

This is a decent meatloaf recipe, although I found the sauce too sweet even after cutting the brown sugar in half.  Next time, I would probably use pasta sauce out of a jar, which has a more rounded taste.  Chopped onions can taste a bit raw even after an hour in the oven, so I would suggest cutting them as small as possible or sauteeing them first before combining with the other ingredients.

So healthy and tasty.  Using fresh rosemary is crucial to get the best flavor in the final dish.  Excellent meatloaf, even for those that usually dislike it.

This was not good. After one bite, my children wouldn't touch it, my husband didn't like it, even my dad who will eat anything didn't like it.  I didn't make the sauce, but I don't think it would have made a difference.  The rosemary was overpowering, and 2 cups of breadcrumbs are too many.  It was moist in the middle, for which I'm giving it the 2 stars, but the outside was very dry. We gave the leftovers to the dog.  I won't be making this again.

The meatloaf was excellent. The flavors were really good but don't make the sauce. It's way too sweet and in my opinion ruins the meatloaf. I didn't think any sauce was necessary. Loved the rosemary flavor -- really enhanced the turkey.

I loved this recipe.  I have to say I modified it quite a bit by adding finely chopped veggies, ommitting the balsamic vinegar, and including the glaze into the loaf (I misread the instructions-but it was a happy mistake)!  I had already reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and in the future I will reduce that amount further.  It is just a wee bit too sweet.  All in all, a great recipe, and a dish that lends itself well to modification ;)
Thanks for posting it!  Steve

This was a really good meatloaf.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, red wine vinegar, and seasoned spaghetti sauce.  It's really moist and the sauce on top is delicious.

This was just too sweet and the flavors did not go well together.  Rosemary, balsamic and sugary tomato sauce.... For those who make this recipe, reduce the sugar or just use some ketchup.

Delicious and easy to make, with ingredients most have in their pantry.  Was a little mushy to get out of the pan, but once on the plate it firmed up a bit.  Highly recommended!

I made it for my house and everyone loved it. I used Tomato sauce with garlic and herbs and added less of the brown sugar. Still turned out wonderful. I had extra tomato sauce mixture and I poured that into my vegetable stir-fry. Wow, the sauce is great with the meatloaf and the veggies. Thanks for this recipe.

I DECIDED TO TRY THIS IN SPITE OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND I'M GLAD I DID. I USED A 20-OUNCE PACKAGE OF GROUND TURKEY, 1 CUP OF ITALIAN BREAD CRUMBS, DRIED MINCED ONION, DICED GREEN BELL PEPPER, AND SOME GRATED CARROTS THAT I HAD LEFT OVER FROM A STIR FRY RECIPE.  I LEFT OUT THE MILK, CUT THE VINEGAR TO 1/4 CUP, CUT THE SALT AND PEPPER TO 1/2 TSP EACH, AND USED 1 TSP OF DRIED ROSEMARY.   I REPLACED THE MILK WITH SOME RAGU SAUCE, JUST ENOUGH TO MOISTEN THE MEAT MIXTURE.   THEN I BAKED THE LOAF AT 400 DEGREES F0R AN HOUR, SPREAD MORE RAGU SAUCE OVER THE TOP AND BAKED IT ANOTHER 10 MINUTES.   IT TURNED OUT GREAT.

This meatloaf recipe was packed with flavor, not surprising with the 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of rosemary, which is always a pretty powerful flavor. 

The recipe was quite easy to make and had a lot of good ingredients.  Be prepared - the topping for the meatloaf is incredibly sweet and rich.  It provides a nice contrast to the ingredients within the loaf.  In fact, the topping reminded me of what some use for crusting meats like ribs when they grill them.  This recipe was a nice change from the usual meatloaf and I would recommend trying it out!

This was great, with a few alterations.  I halved the balsamic vinegar, due to other reviewer's suggestions, and added less bread crumbs.  I also used thyme instead of rosemary to suit my family's taste.  This was moist, delicious, and smelled great in the oven! A keeper.

My friend loved it but I thought it was very bland. I even added a bit less milk, more rosemary, and other flavors to kick it up. I used very high quality ground turkey too. Good for simple tastes but probably won't satisfy more gourmet tastes.

SUPERB!! I was skeptical by the ingredients in the sauce but we absolutely loved this! It makes a pretty big loaf. You deifnitely need the  loaf pan with it, I just formed a loaf and put it in the 9x13 pan and of course the sauced drizzled off the loaf and burned on the pan, but it didnt ruin the loaf. Hubbie didnt even know it was turkey!!! SOOOO Good, a keeper in our house!

This is fabulous!  The topping is to die for - it complements the meatloaf perfectly, don't leave it off!  As recommended by others, I reduced the brown sugar and bread crumbs but otherwise made as is.

I was so excited to find this recipe. However, once prepared, I was disappointed. The sauce was great...but the loaf itself didn't sit well with me.

I would give this 5 stars but I save that for super extraordinary recipes. This recipe was very good, my boyfriend, normally groans when I make meatloaf, but he gobbled this right up! Even the tomato topping, which I usually don't care for on my meatloaf, was yummy!

I used this recipe with low fat ground beef and it turned out superb! I usually struggle with my meat loaf drying out, but this time it remained moist all the way through. Great Recipe! Thanks for sharing...

Very sweet (kind of a sweet & sour taste).  If I made this again, I would cut down on the sugar and vinegar.

This recipe is awesome...with some slight alterations. I'm not too keen on rosemary so I omitted it and added a tsp. of thyme instead. I also included about a half cup of chopped red bell pepper in addition to the onion. Three quarters of a cup of sugar sounded like a bit much so I only used 1/4 cup. My boyfriend loved it and asked me to make it at least once every two weeks.

It's been a long time since I've had meatloaf, so I was looking forward to trying this.  Assembly was easy.  However, my meatloaf wasn't a loaf, but came out of the pan in a lump.  Taste was okay, could have used LOTS more seasonings/herbs.  Sweet top was good.

This is very tasty - the leftovers in a sandwich the day after were even better. After reading the other reviews - I halved the balsamic and substituted worcestshire for the other half.  I also reduced the sugar for the sauce to about 4 tablespoons and even then it was sweet - but the dijon mustard tempers it a bit (maybe add more).  Also make extra sauce because it evaporates a lot while cooking.

Good recipe but not great.  We will have it again.  The tomato sauce was the best part.  I will probably use the sauce on my regular meatloaf too instead of ketchup.
I did also modify the recipe to lessen the amount of liquids -- only 1/4 cup vinegar and only 1/2 cup milk.  I also used 1 tsp dried rosemary instead of fresh rosemary.

This recipe was good.  Unfortunately, I had no bread crumbs and needed to start cooking soon...I added a sleeve of crushed saltines. I will make this again using a bit more bread crumbs than on the recipe.  The topping was tasty.  Our kids don't like "spicy" things, so they wouldn't try it because of the topping.  My husband and I liked the flavor.

Good flavor but definitely a little on the mushy side.  I cut the brown sugar in half because of everyone saying how sweet it was, and it was sweet, but I liked the sauce.  The flavor went well with the rosemary and the meat.  I think there was too much bread crumbs and milk, that if they were halved it might have been better.  Probably not going to be a favorite, but I will try it again.

Delicious!  I was intimidated because I had never cooked a meatloaf with turkey ; however, since I had a returning soldier who only ate poultry or fish I had to try.  I will gladly do it again because Iam convinced that turkey can be every bit as delicious as beef.  I never would have even tried if it had notbeen for my favorite soldier (that I kind of adopted)!

No stars.   2 cups of dry bread crumbs.   I should have known better.  It was terrible.   I will try it again using 1 cup of bread crumbs and see how that works.   Then I will rate this recipe.

I won't make this again..very bland..but for those who want to try it I would suggest sauteing the onions and garlic and rosemary prior to adding it to the mix. Also, 1 onion was way too much.

Great flavour. Juicy and held together well. I moulded it and baked it on tin foil lined sheet, no pan. Put sauce on for last half hour.

I just wanted to point out the ingredient and the instructions have errors. i went to the market and bought all the things needed. came home and started cooking. Mixing in the things as i read them. error one i noticed was how that step two should have been 2 steps seeing as i mixed the toppings into the bowl before i read to pour the toppings on the top of the mix. this was a critical error as it lead me in the wrong direction. Also there is no mention of where i should be adding the garlic since its not in the instructions. I think these should be added in there someplace not sure if its meant to be in the topping or in the mix. lastly i feel the meatloaf might be more moist if there was a tinfoil over the top before you place into the oven. overall tho it twist great was a tad bit dry. thus why i'm adding the tin foil to the mix.

Based on other reviews saying it was mushy, I changed in liquid to solid ratio.  I also made a small loaf because  we have pretty light eaters.  I used 1 pd of turkey, 1 3/4 C panko bread crumbs, ~1/4 C of dried minced onion, 1 egg, 1/2 C milk, 1/4 C balsamic vinegar, I forgot the garlic, 1/2t salt & pepper, 1 t dried rosemary.  The sauce I decreased the sugar to 1/2 C and I didn't use all of the sauce.  Baked for 1 hour in a loaf pan and it was done.

I'm not typically a fan of meatloaf, but my husband loves it. Since I had the ingredients to make this recipe, I thought I'd try it! We LOVED it!! The Rosemary was definitely what made it so tasty. I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used a little less than 1 Tablespoon of dried rosemary, and it was fabulous! I made a few adjustments just from reading other reviews, but basically stayed true to the recipe. Here are the changes I made. I used 1/4 C Balsamic Vinaigrette, and 1 Tablespoon dried rosemary. For the glaze I only had "yellow" mustard, so I used it, and it was fine. I also put in 1/2 Tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. I packed the meatloaf into a bread pan and then before cooking, I took it out and placed it on a wire rack rested on top of a pan lined with foil. Then I put the glaze over the whole meatloaf. It came out beautifully! Not bad for my first attempt at meatloaf ever!

I absolutely love this meatloaf!  I make it just as is, and end up eating it cold out of the pan I love it so much.

I have had different brands/kinds of ground turkey, so I think part of the mushiness came from the kind of turkey. I have no idea why this calls for so much bread crumbs--I thought the flavor was very good except for the overwhelming taste of bread! I would cut back--maybe even halve them--on a lot of the ingredients--milk, (I liked the vinegar), bread crumbs, brown sugar, and maybe even the onion (I really like onion, but it was a lot). I might try this again with those changes and then toss it if it doesn't turn out differently.

this was decent, however, I cut back on some of the ingredients, and omitted others. I dropped the milk, used just a 1/4 cup of the vinegar, 1/2 cup of fine breadcrumb, and 1/2 cup of rolled oats. 2 cups of either would have been far too much! with the cup of milk and the full portion of vinegar it definately would have been mushy! I also added a second egg. It seemed to stay together nicely.

Easy and tasty to make for a weekday meal.  Good for kids as well.  Next time, I'm going to follow another reviewer's advice and saute the onions a little first before adding to the mix.  Onions were a bit too crunchy otherwise.

The meatloaf was good.  I did not like the topping at all.  It was way too sweet.  I used less balsamic and added worstchester sauce as someone recommended.  I also added some fresh chopped spinach as I find this adds moisture to turkey meatloaf(can get dry).  I really liked the garlic and rosemary flavor.  Definitely a unique version.

I love this recipe and so does my family.  I do a few things different than what the recipe says.  I use my own bread crumbs and use a little less balsamic vinegar.  Also I cut down on the brown sugar and use regular spagatti sauce.  Other than that I make this recipe every other week.

I just made this recipe last week and with a few changes I'd probably make it again.  The glaze was just a little too sweet for meatloaf I think.  I'd cut down on the sugar in the glaze, and add something else to the loaf itself; maybe celery.  This was only the second time I made meatloaf but the results wasn't bad.  I might even mix ground sirloin with the turkey next time.

Overall this was pretty good and I would make it again.  Next time I would use less balsamic as it was a bit overwhelming and the meatloaf itself was quite moist.  This was even better left-over the next day.

the taste was really good, but it took a lot longer than suggested for it to cook through.  i ended up leaving it in the oven for about an hour and a half.

This was a nice change to normal meatloaf.  The sauce was very good...I used Good Seasonings Balsamic salad dressing instead of vinegar.  The only reason I am giving this a 3 instead of a 4 is because my kids STILL didn't like the meatloaf despite the new recipe.

This meatloaf turned out really moist- falls apart when you cut into it. I liked the flavor better than a meatloaf made with ground beef. Easy and delicious. Thanks, Tim.

I'm giving this four stars because I loved the taste, but it was way too mushy (that'll teach me to not read the reviews first).  The rest of the loaf did firm up after sitting in the pan for about 20 minutes while we ate.  Next time, I'd reduce most of the liquids by half and get rid of the milk altogether and I bet it would be a five star recipe.  I thought it tasted amazing.

I took the other reviewer's advice and reduced the milk, reduced the balsamic, added worchestshire and reduced the brown sugar.  My husband and I didn't like the chopped onions nor the rosemary.  The texture wasn't very appetizing.  I think I will stick to lean beef for any future meatloaf recipes.

I thought the glaze was ok but my husband didn't like the sweetness.

My husband and I loved it! I had to make some changes, though, so I could work with what I had in the kitchen... I used 1 pound of ground turkey (not 1 1/2), apple cider vinegar, dried rosemary, spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and half of the bread crumbs were italian flavored. I also just plain forgot the garlic. I don't know how close mine came to what the actual recipe should taste like, but my version turned out awesome!

I haven't had meatloaf in a very long time and was excited to make it again.  I've never made it with ground turkey, but I was willing to give it a shot.  I must say, I was disappointed in the results.  I followed the recipe step-by-step and the outcome was not as anticipated.  As many reviews said, the dish was very moist, which is great, but there was something missing.  It needed more of something and I wish I could pinpoint what.  Glad many others were able to enjoy this dish, but I think I'll stick with good old fashion (lean) hamburger meatloaf.

This a great alternative to regular red-meat meatloaf.  We've had it several times, and it always gets compliments from guests!
