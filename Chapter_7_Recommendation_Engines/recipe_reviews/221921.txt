So bright and citrus-y! I have such a hard time getting quinoa to taste like anything but quinoa, but this was a different story! I would definitely make this again (boyfriend agrees). Also, I've never cooked with kumquats - who knew they had so many seeds! Make sure to de-seed them as you slice them. I served this with pan-seared whitefish, but would go well with chicken too!

I liked the taste with the kumquats. I used my own veggie stock instead of chicken stock. The textures with the kumquats and quinoa ended up being a strange combination...not sure if I would try this again.
