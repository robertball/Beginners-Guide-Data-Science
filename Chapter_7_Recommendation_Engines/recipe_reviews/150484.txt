This was a great recipe. I altered the way it was cooked because I didn't have any minute rice on hand. I used regular brown rice and a rice cooker. I added two lumps of chicken boullion to the water I normally would use to cook the rice. When it was nearly cooked through, I added the chopped onion to the rice cooker, and then a few minutes later I added the mushrooms (I skipped the celery because I didn't have any). The flavor of the rice is great with the mushrooms. I added the parsley and walnuts afterwards. Delicious. I'd make this again, it's healthy, and really improves the taste of boring plain brown rice.

Great taste, but next time I'll use regular brown rice instead of quick rice for the rice its self was a bit lacking.

I made this recipe recently and loved it.  I did not make any changes to it.  I would reccomend low sodium broth just to cut out the sodium.  Overall it was simple and quick to make and very tasty.  I used baby bella mushrooms and the recipe had a great nutty flavor.

I made some substitutions to this recipe, but it still came out great!  It was my first time making a pilaf.  I used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian and used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had in the house.    The biggest change I made was using regular brown rice.  I started it in the rice maker, but when there was 10 minutes left on it, I stopped it to finish it as the recipe states.  It turned out just fine!  I'll be making this again.

My family loved this brown rice recipe. I added some sodium free chicken instant bouillon to cut down on the sodium content. It was great.

we enjoyed this dish served with salmon.  I didn't have any fresh mushrooms, so I subbed in canned whole baby mushrooms instead, which worked just fine.

I loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I used fresh chicken broth to avoid the extra sodium.  I sauteed the onions, mushrooms, red pepper, and celery in olive oil and fresh pepper first and then added black beans.I didn't have walnuts but will definitely add them the next time.

I used regular long cook brown rice and cooked it first. I thought the extras would lose a lot of their flavor during the long cooking process. Tasted great. I will surely keep this one in my recipe box.

Great recipe! My grocery store was out of Minute Brown Rice so I bought Success Boil-in-Bag, cut open 2 bags, and simmered for 10 minutes. Went well with my grilled kabobs.

I should've gone with other reviewers on this and used regular rice instead of instant. My family thought the rice was great, but I didn't like the rice quality at all. 
I did substitute chopped almonds for the walnuts since I had them on hand and walnuts make a family member sick. 
Good flavor - just word to the wise: buy regular rice!!

I thought this was very good, but my family was not too impressed.  It was a lot tastier the next day reheated and my husband liked it better too.  I like how healthy it is.  I will make this again and hope my family takes a shine too it.

My first rice pilaf.... It turned out good. I didn't have instant so I cooked the rice most of the way first, It didn't end up dry like i had hoped but that was probably my error..... I will definitely use this again though.

Very good. I used a half can of Beef Consomme and added water instead of the chicken broth. I also used toasted almond slices instead of the walnuts.

My husband loved this!  Made it as a side dish for Grilled Halibut and it was a wonderful pairing.  I didn't have minute rice but had frozen brown rice.  I doubled the recipe and used 4 cups pre-prepared brown rice and only one can of chicken broth.  I simmered until almost all of the liquid was absorbed. It came out PERFECT!!  The toasted walnuts are so good in this!  Great recipe.

This was great.  I left out the chicken broth and the parsley and walnuts because they weren't on hand... and I used canned mushrooms, and it was still good.  Looking forward to trying it with those ingredients next time!  :)

We enjoyed this side dish although I made a few changes based on what i had on hand.  I added chopped celery in addition to the other veggies and used Trader Joe's precooked brown rice that I had microwaved.  Added the rice to the sauteed veggies and topped with chopped cilantro.  Very fresh with healthy ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will be making again.

This Pilaf was delicious. I hesitated about using the walnuts but they were great. Definatly try this recipe. I gave four stars because I used 2.5 cups cooked brown rice instead of the Minute Rice. I don't know how well it would have turned out as written. Great side dish. I am thinking about adding chicken to make it a one dish meal. Great way to eat brown rice.

Made this as part of a company meal and everyone thought it was delicious.  The toasted walnuts add just the right amount of crunch and flavor.  I followed the recipe with the following changes: added 2 full cups of broth, and instead of the Minute Rice used 2 packages of Success boil in a bag brown rice, emptying the packages right into the skillet to cook in with the other ingredients.  One of my guests plans to incorporate this recipe into the buffet menu they serve at their Christmas party.

Great recipe!  I've been looking for a way to jazz up brown rice and this was quick and easy.  I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used canned and I used toasted pine nuts instead of walnuts.  My husband and I loved it!

Very easy, very yummy! All that needs to be said, actually! Though i did not have any celery i used celery salt instead and also had to settle for almonds instead of walnuts, which i rosted first... still good! Thank you!

I loved this. So simple and such good flavor.  I used beef broth and increased the celery slightly. Will definitely make again!

Delicious! I will admit I burned the walnuts the first time around, and had to cook a second batch with a closer eye. They browned much faster than I expected. Will definitely make this regularly.

This was a very Fall looking dish. I noticed a lot of the reviews said the rice needed more water. So, I added more until it looked fluffy. I left my walnuts under the broiler too long and had to made the second batch with pecans. I'm sure walnuts, pecans or almonds would all work well. The whole family enjoyed this dish! (served along with salmon)

Found the rice was not fully cooked, and really didn't like the walnuts....would maybe make again but with a number of alterations.

I used TJ brown rice and cooked for 3 minutes and then added to the skillet.It could use a little more spice. Maybe more onions. I just threw in a few handfulls.

I rated 4 stars because it needs a little more chicken broth like some of the other comments suggested. I will add more next time I cook this. It will definitely be a keeper.

I cook probably once every 5 years or so (yes YEARS...), I wanted to do something to help wifey, but it had to be quick and easy. This was both; someone with experience chopping stuff could do this in about 15 minutes. I left out the nuts, but it was still delicious!

I was looking for a way to use fresh crimini mushrooms, before they went bad, and came across this rice dish. As I did not have all the ingredients, on hand,  I had to make a couple of substitutions. I used  scallions instead of onions and wild rice instead of instant brown. Oh, I also toasted the walnuts. Even with the substitutions this was very good.
