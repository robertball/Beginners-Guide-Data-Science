This soup was pretty good. I did add some salt, pepper because I thought it needed it. I also increased the onion and garlic powder for more flavor. Pretty easy and inexpensive to throw together.

Chicken noodle soup with no chicken???  No seasoning???  I had some leftover meat off a rotisserie chicken so I threw that in, and of course this was in desperate need of salt and pepper.  I also started by sauteing some onions and a little garlic.  With my minor additions, this went from bland to good.  I wasn't expecting much from frozen veggies, but this is truly a simple soup recipe and perfect for when you don't have the time to spend in the kitchen.  I would make this again when short on time or feeling under the weather.

This is an easy recipe...great when you have some one unexpectedly sick!  The only changes I made were that I didn't have the broth so I used Knorr concentrated chicken stock and 7 cups of water and  I  used Orzo instead of the noodles.  I really liked this recipe and I would make this again.
