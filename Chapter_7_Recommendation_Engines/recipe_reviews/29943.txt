I only gave this 4 stars because I doctored the recipe, but it came out great! To speed up the cooking process, cook squash in microwave, cut-side down in 1/2 in. of water for about 10 minutes. I sauteed fresh mushrooms and fresh spinach with the onion, and added some minced garlic, seasoned salt and pepper. I mixed mozzarella cheese in with the squash (about 3/4 c) and added a few dashes of hot sauce. Instead of bread cubes, I used homemade whole wheat garlic croutons. It was delicious with unique flavoring!

This is so good. I sauted an 8 oz package of fresh mushrooms that I quartered. I also added a 9 oz package of frozen spinich (defrosted and drained), and skipped the basil. I seasoned with kosher salt, pepper and a dash of nutmeg(goes great with spinach). Last but not least I made  garlic croutons to go with the fresh parmesan for the topping and it came out perfect. What a great way to prepare spaghetti squash as with the previos reviewer I also had one sitting on my counter waiting to be used.

I COOKED IT JUST AS DESCRIBED EXCEPT I USED PEPPERIDGE FARM STUFFING INSTEAD OF BREAD CUBES AND IT TURNED OUT WONDERFUL. WE MADE IT AS PART OF EASTER DINNER AND IT WILL BE ON THE MENU FOR EVERY HOLIDAY NOW ON..THE GOOD THING IS , YOU CAN CHANGE THIS RECEPI AROUND AS YOU LIKE AND IT'S STILL GOING TO BE GOOD!

How are people giving 4 or 5 stars to a recipe that they almost completely changed?  You're rating your own, new recipe.  If you want to submit a new recipe for spaghetti squash, that's great.  Based on these reviews, I know how tasty 55 different squash recipes are, not Spaghetti Squash Casserole submitted by NMC0013.

Mmm!  My family all loved this one.  Made my own changes.  Sautéed garlic, fresh mushrooms, and onions.  Added the cooked squash and a can of beef broth.  Simmered till reduced and then thicken slightly with cornstarch/water.  Added 1/2c sour cream.  Poured in casserole dish.  Topped with bread and parmesan.  Baked as directed.  This was a great recipe that will be a family regular in our home.  Next time I will add spinach.

This is a great squash recipe- I did however change it up a bit- I added a little bit if salt and pepper, some extra parmesean cheese and I didnt use the bread cubes. I used cracker crumbs instead. I made a full recipe thinking my husband and i would have leftovers but we ended up eating it all. Very rich and yummy.

Good new use for spaghetti squash. we didn't have the croûtons, I used french fried onions and couldn't imagine this dish without them. For the leftovers I served it atop mashed potatoes.

Yum. An excellent way to prepare usually bland spaghetti squash. I did as another reviewer suggested and substituted spinach for the basil, added nutmeg, and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. It was even better on the second day.

Pretty good recipe, though I'm more partial to a cheesier casserole, with tomato sauce. The bread cubes toasted on top add a nice touch; try substituting flavored croutons for more bang.

Loved it.  I cooked my squash in the microwave, though.  And I used cornbread stuffing mix in place of the bread crumbs.

I had never made spaghetti squash before, actually I had never even heard of it, I had one and decided to use the recipe, I am very surprised I liked it! I followed the directions exactly and it came out really good. I had to add salt afterwards but other than that I loved it!

I used this recipe as a base but made a fabulous casserole by "kicking it up a notch". So knocked a star since I redid.  Used fresh mushrooms (8oz) instead, sauteed a package italian sausage, used fresh basil, doubled the sour cream, added 2 cups mozzarella and seasoned with Lawry's Season Salt. Then took another reviewers suggestion and used French Fried Onions instead of bread cubes. Topped with Parmesan.   Yuuuuuummy!!  Tasted like a hashbrown casserole.  Was low carb too which my neighbors on Atkins loved!!

A little bland but some extra garlic really made it tastey.  Good way to get rid of the ton of Spaghetti Squash that came out of the garder this year.

I doubled the cheese, putting half into the sour cream mix and used rest for topping, made the croutons myself with olive oil, basil, coarse salt and garlic, used dried morrel mushrooms because that is what I had and I added 2 handfuls of fresh washed and chopped spinach to the sour cream mix along with some pepper. Layered it all with croutons on top.

My husband even loved this!  Used a large scoop of cream cheese because I didn't have sour cream and used zucchini instead of mushrooms - spiced it up a bit with of garlic, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper.  Very tasty!  Can't wait for the leftovers!

As someone who loves spaghetti squash, I was not impressed with this recipe.  You definitely need to add salt to the squash but it still lacks flavor and I don't think sour cream is a good complement to the squash.  This made for a weird tasting combination.  It wasn't inedible but I can hardly imagine you would be looking forward to the leftovers.

I like that this recipe is a strong deviation from the typical, boring, predictable combo of spaghetti squash + marinara sauce. I added garlic to the saute pan, since it was so often recommended in the comments, and you can pretty much never go wrong with garlic. Glad I added it. used a large onion instead of medium, and substituted fat free (guilt free!) greek yogurt for the sour cream. My basil was some that I dried in my pantry 2 weeks ago, so it was very flavorful, unlike the typical grass clippings in a jar from the store, and the basil flavor was great in this dish! For the topping, I tore up some rustic Italian bread, sprayed it lightly with olive oil spray, and sprinkled with a bit more basil, garlic powder and salt. Also, I used fresh grated parmesan cheese. I think using quality, fresh ingredients helped out. I give this 3 stars, because it's interesting and a good way to use spaghetti squash, but it's not a knock-out dish. I got a spaghetti squash in my CSA basket, so even though I'm not really enthused about the vegetable in general, this dish was an easy, interesting, and pretty tasty way to experience it. I won't go out of my way to make it again, but if I get another spaghetti squash in my CSA basket, I'd make it again.

Really delicious!  I didn't have mushrooms in the house so I cut up some mini-turkey-meatballs and added those in.  Used low-fat sour cream and reduced fat parm. cheese.  4 stars!

Tasty recipe! I also used fresh sauteed mushrooms as I don't care for canned. Next time I would use a little less onion and more cheese.

Even though i tweeked the recipe im giving it a 5 because it was really good! I took some advice from others also. I used garlic crutons, and sauteed fresh spinich and fresh mushrooms with the onions and added 2 tbs minced garlic. I also added about half cup of mon/ched shredded cheese which i loved. Ill def make this again but next time maybe add a cup of sourcream instead of 3/4!! My fiance even loved it!

Good, but seemed to lack a bit of flavor - might try adding garlic salt, or saute garlic in with the onions.

This was good!  I added salt, more cheese, spinach and topped it with French crispy onions.  Sure I made some changes but it is a good base recipe for spaghetti squash.  Thank you NMC0013.

Love, love, loved this!  Just added salt and pepper to taste, and topped with french fried onion straws instead of breadcrumbs.

I like this recipe. I did not have mushrooms so I used 1/2 c of cream of mushroom/garlic soup. I also sauteed onion, garlic and spinach. I used panko crumbs instead of cubed bread. I will make again.

I am giving this recipe five stars.  This was the most delicious spaghetti squash I have ever tasted and it was easy to make.  My husband was totally impressed.  I didn't have any sour cream so I substituted heavy cream.  It came out incredible (although I ruined the healthy aspect by doing this).  Yum - It was even better than fettucini alfredo.

My family liked this recipe. I thought the texture was great but, it was just a little bland for me. My husband LOVED it! We got the squash for one of his co-workers so, he took 3 servings of leftovers to work and the guys he works with also really enjoyed it. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I love love love love love this recipe. I was looking for something I could do with the spaghetti squash sitting on my counter, and this was it. I did add a little salt to the sour cream mixture, but followed the recipe otherwise. I definitely recommend this one. (Even my picky eaters went for it).

This has no flavor whatsoever. Would probably be good if you used bechmel or alfredo sauce instead of the sour cream and cheese.

Pretty good recipe.  I used fresh mushrooms, and I think it needs more sour cream.  I also seasoned with salt and pepper, and used garlic and onion croutons.  This is a keeper.

The first time, I made this, I followed the recipe almost completely.  I used frozen mushrooms and light sour cream.  Absolutely loved it!  The second time I made it, I used fat free Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and switched to asiago cheese instead of Parmesan.  I used seasoned breadcrumbs mixed with a few tablespoons of grated parm as the topping.  Still love it!  Such a simple and versatile recipe!  My next batch will include some tomato and zucchini.  This also reheats well and you will be the envy of all your coworkers when they smell all that garlicky goodness!  Works well as a side, or a main dish.

I wanted to like this but it was so-so. Maybe I don't like spaghetti squash. This was the first time I've ever had it. The best part was the bread topping. Also, I added spinach, as suggested, but I am sure it wouldn't have been any better without it.

I really liked this casserole, but my kids didn't (but they're not much for spaghetti squash anyways).  I added cut up chicken for some protein and to make it a filling dinner.  I also used approx 1 Tablespoon of Italian bread crumbs on top. Will make again and add garlic and spinach.

This was good, it is spaghetti squash after all. I used croutons as suggested by some, but they were kind of difficult to eat. If I make it again, I think seasoned bread crumbs on top of the cheese would be the best option. I did use an italian blend of cheeses that was quite good.

When I set it on the table, my family turned up their nose. My 16 year old put a little on his plate and smelled it first, then took a little taste and then let everyone know it was "ok" to eat. They all dug in and everyone loved it.

I love this recipe.  I made it with fresh mushroom like another reviewer did.  I then added chicken that cooked I in the same spices.  It makes a great one dish dinner and the leftovers (if there are any) are even better for lunch at work. What a great way to get the kids to eat veggies.

This was pretty good. I did make a few minor changes: Used fresh mushrooms,soy chese instead of parm and left of the croutons. Served by itself, it seemed to be missing something.. not the croutons either! I diced up some chicken breast and had that and then it tasted better. I big serving of the chicken and squash with some whole wheat couscous was a good meal.

Not what I was expecting. I didnt really like the sour cream taste to this. However, it was a new way to use a spaghetti squash, which was nice. I dont think I will make it again, but the concept of spaghetti squash caserole works, I am just not sold on this recipe.

What a great side!  I didn't have any mushrooms so I used cauliflower and instead of bread/croutons I used whole wheat english muffins (3) cubed, which I browned by putting the oven on grill for the last 4 min or so.  This one's  keeper, I'll make it again, delicious!

I LOVE this. I was a little leary but LOVE it. I brought it to work and even someone who doesn't care for squash finished her serving and got seconds. This was a huge hit and now a keeper in mine and many others recipes. Thanks so much.

I didn't really care for the sour cream taste to this, I guess we just like spaghetti squash just with some butter and salt. Sorry

My family likes spaghetti squash with butter and light seasonings, but we did not like this.  Perhaps it is just our tastes though. >shrug

Just discovering squash and made this recipe today. Only change was no mushrooms and used onion crisps instead of bread on top. Simply delicious and a new family favorite. Thank you.

Based upon other comments I added garlic, used bread and panko crumbs, and added a bit of grated mozzarella with the parmigiana, I still found it bland but the others liked it.  I love squash but not spaghetti squash I guess.

Was really good & will definitely make again. Didn't have bread so used Italian seasoned croutons. Next time I will add salt & more Parmesan cheese. Will also crush the croutons to make a more even top crust.

As is, this recipe was pretty plain, and contained a few ingredients we dislike. I used it as a basis to really make a whole new dish. With a lot of reworking, it turned out delicious and was loved by the whole family.

I made it and altered the recipe to make it low carb. I took it the bread crumbs and added a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store that was deboned and deskined. Simple ingredient recipes that I can alter to meet my family needs are awesome and this was a winner.

I have made this twice now, the first time exactly by the recipe and it was excellent...the 2nd time I made a few minor changes.  Added red bell pepper mainly just to add color and I took some advice from another reviewer and added some mild Italian sausage.  The wife raved about both  of them (but preferred the all veggie one)  A great way to use up spaghetti squash.

My husband and I really liked this.  I did use fresh mushrooms lightly sauteed in place of the canned mushrooms and used a gluten free white bread for the crumbs.

Wow.  This is fabulous.  I read the previous reviews and modified this just a bit. I added sauteed spinach and changed the cheese to 1 cup, and then used crackers instead of bread for the topping.  Incredible!

This is easy enough to make, but the flavors were underwhelming. I did substitute yogurt for sour cream due to an allergy, but that doesn't typically alter a recipe enough to matter. We'll stick with Pesto Spaghetti Squash recipe from this site.

I used fresh mushrooms, added some salt, stirred the Parmesan in, and replaced the bread cubes with one cup panko tossed with 3 T melted butter.  It turned out tangy creamy and packed a toasty crunch!

I also modified with fresh mushrooms and spinach. I also added ground pork because my family are meat eaters. Add a bit of salt and it's delicious. It's a nice way to use spaghetti squash other than the traditional.

This was a very enjoyable creamy side that I served with a spicy bbq chicken.  The flavors were simple but good. The only change I made was to use panko instead of bread cubes on top.  If I made again I would sub some italian dressing for part of the sour cream.

I made this recipe as written, and while it was ok, it lacked something, some zing.  My wife says it would be better with more of a cream sauce, and I'm thinking more spices, perhaps a little garlic.  Next time I'll improvise for sure, maybe the other reviewers were right to change it up a bit.

this is good but with that being said its alot of work and lacks on the flavor, I would make this again but would alter adding more cheese not just adding on top. If your looking for something different this is it. Prepare yourself for the extra time.

I basically just used the structure of this recipe.  I'm glad I listened to some other reviewers and my instincts on this one because I imagine it would have been very bland if I'd followed the original recipe.  I used fresh mushrooms (instead of canned), added several cloves of garlic, zucchini and fresh arugula to the saute.  I also added cumin, hot chili powder, and a hint of cinnamon.  I also mixed in some of the bread cubes, in addition to putting them on top.  It turned out very well!

Good, but definitely needed more seasoning. I added quite a bit of salt and pepper. Word of advice, leave the breadcrumbs on top like the recipe said. After baking it, I mixed it in and they all just got mushy.

Delicious!  Even my picky eater loved it and asked me to make it again.  I took the advice of other posters and added garlic and spinach and used nutmeg instead of basil.  Filling but not heavy.  I will be adding this to my weekly rotation.  Thanks for the recipe!

I rated it four stars because it was good, and certainly not flavors I would have thought to mix.  It was bland and a bit dry.  Good, but bland.  If you prefer high flavor foods, I would recommend adding more spices, peppers, and something to increase the liquid.  My husband added some cream of mushroom soup (prepared) to his.  We both liked it with the soup.  We will definitely be eating this again!

Was bland, I can see why others added different stuff to this recipe.  We have to stick with my other spaghetti squash casserole recipe.

YUM! I changed the recipe a little and it was so delicious!  I added some minced garlic (LOVE IT) and I also used a mix of mozzarella and cheddar cheese instead of parmesan. I used garlic croutons instead of the cubed bread. SUPER GOOD and super easy! (To speed it up, you can also cook the squash in a microwave, cut-side down in 1/2 in. of water for about 10 minutes.)

This recipe was easy. I baked the squash in the oven instead of the microwave like the other reviews. I chopped a bell pepper in with the onion and it made a nice touch. We also used crumbled ritz crackers instead of the bread which was good. The some of the kids turned their nose up at it, but what are you going to do? It is made purely with veggies. My husband and I both loved it. 5 Stars!

It was good, but I do agree it is a little bland.  I added fresh mushrooms and spinach and it is a great way to use your spaghetti squash. I also added more cheese.

I loved this recipe. The rest of the family not so much. I thought it needed salt and a little more flavor.

I added to this recipe to give it a 4, but still a good idea. I made my own garlic crutons, used fresh mushrooms, and added spinach, mozzarella on top, fresh basil and oregano and fresh mushrooms. It could still use a little more garlic and maybe some more sour cream or marinara sauce... turned out a little dry.

Really, really bland- was very surprised at all of the good reviews. I had high hopes for this recipe.  I am trying to decide what to add to make this edible for my family- we like spices.  I took two bites and couldn't eat anymore.  Sorry. This needs work.

I made this with plain yogurt instead of sour cream (it's a lot easier and cheaper to get yogurt here) and used it as a re-heat meal for the week.  As such, the bread cubes on top got all soggy (as I knew they would).  I added spinach to the mix because I had some and other reviewers had done the same, but think that it may have been better without it.  It needed salt and pepper after it was finished, but overall, it was pretty good.  Shame there's no way to keep the bread cubes crunchy in the microwave, but if I'd eaten it straight out of the oven, I bet it would have been five stars.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish and my kids ate the prerequisite no thank you helping.  I found it to be a little bland.  We added garlic as suggested by others.  I used fresh mushrooms and added more Parmesan cheese as well as salt and pepper.  We will make this again, it is a great way to use up spaghetti squash, but we were not in love with it.

Excellent dish! Just what I needed to use up the spaghetti squash from my farmer's coop. I made this w/o changes or substitutions.

I had never tried spaghetti squash before so I looked on allrecipes.com for ideas. I tried this recipe and instantly fell in love with it. The colors from the red pepper, basil, and mushrooms along with the squash make this an eye-catching meal and it tastes wonderful!

I just made this.  Pretty good, but not something I would make every day.  The only changes I would make would be to add maybe a cup of shredded mozzarella and a few sprikles of hot sauce.  Not sure what the point of the bread cubes on top is.  They're not needed and are just one extra step. Next time I may even add a little shredded cooked chicken to give it a little more oomph.
