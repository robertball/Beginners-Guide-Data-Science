I've been looking for more ways to cook kale and think I've come across a keeper ;)

I used equal amounts kale and spinach and served it up with brown rice and chicken breast marinated in teriyaki sauce. Very nice. Thanks for sharing!

I used the juice of one lemon, plus some zest, 1 clove of garlic grated on my microplane, and no additional salt as the soy sauce has plenty. Very tasty! I will make this again, it's easy and a great way to get more of this supperfood into my diet!

I added a bit of fresh chopped red cabbage to add a bit of crunchiness and take away a bit of the bitterness.

I don't have a steamer, so I added some chicken stock at the bottom of the pan and brought it to a boil. I threw in the kale and added the sauce after the kale had cooked down a bit. We all thoroughly enjoyed this in my house.

This salad is DELICIOUS. At first I was a little skeptical as I was steaming the leaves, I thought it was going to be warm. No the mix of lemon juice, minced garlic and soy give this nutritious green a great flavor. will make this again for sure.

OH my, this was awesome! I did cook the kale in a bit of reduced chicken stock (as another reviewer did). The flavor really makes the kale taste meaty. YUM! I did make one boo boo...I wanted to double the sauce but didn't pay attention to the proportions and I made it a little too garlicky. My fault...but I mentioned this to point out that the proportions are just right as they are!

I LOVED these flavors and the chewy texture of the Kale (over limpness of spinach which I also love.)  I did not bother to steam, just rinsed it well in a pan, drained it, and left whatever water clung to the leaves to help with cooking.  I added about 1/2 cup of vegetable stock instead of water and brought it to a boil, then turned it down a bit and cooked for 7-8 minutes as directed.  I stirred a few times.  I didn't bother to drain since a lot of the liquid steamed off anyway.  I added the dressing to the hot kale in the pan to warm it up and take the edge off the raw garlic.  Then I dished it up with a slotted spoon.  The flavors were great, the preparation was very easy, and I love discovering a healthy recipe that is so tasty.

I'd never even had kale before I tried this recipe and now I make it all the time for my husband and I. I use a mixture of kale and spinach and don't measure out the ingredients, just sort of guess until it smells right. I prefer to take all the stems out of the kale before cooking as they don't seem to soften up very well. So yeah, overall, I love this recipe and it's so easy!

Very tasty over kale. I made a few additions that kicked it up a notch: a handful of chopped cilantro, some sliced radishes for crunch, and a sauteed red pepper. No matter what other veggies you throw in, I urge you to try adding cilantro, it definitely added depth to the flavors!

I tried it once as described, once without the salt and once without the salt but with extra soy sauce and a little bit of red pepper flakes. None of the attempts were well-received. I'll keep using kale in other recipes but this isn't one that I'll repeat.

Oh My!  This was awesome.  I went to farmer's market today and bought a bunch of fresh young kale. I prepared it as directed, but added 1 tablespoon of Balsamic, only because I love the taste.  Delish!!!

Excellent way to prepare kale. I actually used lime since I had no lemon in the house. It turned out great! It was my roommates 1st kale experience and he really liked it. It reminded us of a pickle. So good! Thanks for sharing.

Just made this, literally eating it now, and its amazing. 
I wanted to try kale for the first time. With all that talk about it being a "superfood"...but I didn't know how to make it! 
This is officially what I am gonna be making (and eating!) for when I buy kale!
Thank you so much!

Delicious! This is definitely lemony and garlicky, but if you love those two things, you'll love this kale! Very easy to prepare, and I loved the slight hint of soy sauce. I steamed the kale for exactly 10 mins. Kale wilts down quite a bit, so in my opinion, this makes more like 6 servings, not 12. Also, when preparing your kale, remove the rib running down each leaf. It is tough and inedible. This will be a go-to recipe in my house!

Fantastic! My husband and I are new to kale & I'm so pleased we found this yummy recipe. I don't have a stove top steamer so I used a Tupperware microwave steamer. Worked beautifully!

I wasn't sure what to expect with this recipe, as I haven't ever prepared kale myself, but it was delicious! For any Trader Joe's shoppers out there, I used their bagged kale as well as TJs jarred garlic (about 3/4T) to save time. This one's a winner!

A great, simple recipe. The kale tasted perfect after steaming for 7 minutes. A tasty, healthy side dish when short on time.

This is delicious, as suggested. I am not that familiar with cooking with kale or the best recipes. So, I decided to make 1/4 of the recipe to try it. Now, I wish I would have made more as I only got 1 small serving! I don't have a steamer, so I put the kale in the microwave and steamed it with 1/2 cup of water. I used a medium sized bowl and covered it with plastic wrap. I cooked it for 10 minutes, on high, stirring once. At 7 minutes, it still had the bright green color but was too crunchy for me in a recipe like this. After 10 minutes it was slightly darker but much softer. I gently drained it and stirred in the rest of the ingredients. It slightly reminded me of collards. ty

It was a little salty for me, even just using the soy sauce.  I also found a few sprinkles of Seasoned Rice Vinegar prior to serving add a nice tangy touch of sweetness.  I'll use less soy sauce, next time.

I'm always looking for tasty ways to add greens to my diet. Between that and seeing this was categorized as a Myplate recipe I thought I would give this a whirl. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was. I scaled it to one serving for just me and didn't want to "crack open" a fresh lemon for just 1 teaspoon so I subbed raw apple cider vinegar. Followed the rest of the recipe as directed. This was the best kale recipe I've tried to date, besides adding it to my fruit smoothies :)

I slightly altered the recipe - I used lime juice because I didn't have lemon. I also thinly sliced 3 big garlic cloves lengthwise (as shown in one of the pictures  for this recipe) instead of mincing it. This gave it a nice mellow garlic taste with each bite with a garlic slice. Next time I'll add even more garlic. I forgot the soy sauce - next time I'll try adding that. Using this recipe, I almost ate the whole bunch of kale in one sitting - I had to stop myself!

Omg! Fantabulous! It doesn't need a thing. For those that are unaware...Just know that the center rib is inedible, So, you must slice it off.

I generally dislike kale, but this recipe was pretty good.  I did make a minor change.  I thought the dressing was too lemony so I added a couple of teaspoons more olive oil.  I also had to cook my kale a lot longer.  I cooked it for about 20 minutes or so.  Not sure if that is typical or not.

I adore this recipe.  Our winter Florida garden is thriving with kale right now, so I was looking for some different way to use it.  This fit the bill perfectly.   I took another person's advice and added cabbage to the steamer (bottom of the basket, then kale on top).  I halved the recipe because it is just hubby and I, but kept the same amount of dressing.  He LOVED it.  I LOVED it!  This is definitely on my rotation list!  Thanks for sharing this!!!!

I made this tonight as our New Year's greens. DH loved it! He said we could make this all year long. My two sons were just okay with it. I used the juice of one lemon.  It may have been too much. I will measure more precisely next time, just to see if it can be even better.

Great way to prepare kale, thanks for the recipe! The only thing I would adjust is use low sodium soy sauce and I did not add extra salt, it was a little salty for my taste but delicious.

This is my absolute FAVORITE way to prepare kale!  My kids gobble it up like crazy and there is never any left over.  The only change I make it to add only half the amount of lemon juice.  It was too powerful the first time I made it!  Other than that, it's a winner!!

So easy, so yummy.  Thank you for the recipe.  I did borrow from a few of the reviews, like adding a bit of lemon zest (I like it lemony) and sautéing the cooked kale with dressing for a few minutes to warm/mellow the garlic. I used low salt soy sauce so I did add the salt, these seasonings seem great to us.  I eyeballed the amount of kale since I was only serving my husband and I - - wished we had made a whole batch for the two of us!!  This will be a standard in our house.

I really like this recipe. After steaming the kale, I kept it warm while I sauteed the garlic in olive oil and then threw the kale in. I then added the lemon juice and low sodium soy sauce. Once everything was mixed, I just turned off the heat and added red pepper flakes. Will definitely make this again!

I didn't measure the dressing, just squeezed some fresh lemon and eye-balled it.  I thought it was delicious, but my husband felt the lemon was overpowering.  I would measure next time.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe. Very tart. I'm glad I tasted it before ruining my whole batch if steamed kale. Decided to just eat it warm with a touch of butter and parmesan. Not the healthiest but neither is soy sauce so whatever.

I loved this!! I try to eat kale regularily because it's so good for you but it's not my favourite veggie. This sauce made it taste so yummy! Normally I saute the kale but the steaming made it tender. My 19 year old daughter loved it too!!!

Delicious!  As other reviewers suggested, I boiled the kale in 1c chicken broth until it shrank down a bit but was still a bit crunchy.  I added just half of the lemon juice/olive oil/soy sauce mixture to that--the whole amount would have been way too salty for my tastes.  Husband ate it all up making yummy noises!

We loved it! I left out the soy sauce, because I thought the salt would be enough. And I added a teaspoon of Garam Masala with the olive oil, garlic and lemon juice. It was a perfect veggie dish, one that I'm sure I'll make again.

I thought this was too bitter. I used Red Russian Kale out of the garden and it's usually mild, but I don't know if steaming it instead of sauteing it brought more bitter taste to it. My husband and I agree that we will move on from this recipe.

This gives a nice tangy, lemony flavor to the kale. It is also flexible. You can easily make changes to fit your mood and ingredients on hand.

You should only steam for max 2 minutes to get the bitterness of the kale out.  You don’t want soggy kale for a salad. Also there’s wayyyyy too much sodium. You don’t need to add salt because the soy sauce is full of sodium.

I followed the directions exactly as presented and it was easy to follow.  The kale was tasty and the sauce was great. It was good and did not overpower the kale. The steaming helped to keep the taste. Now that I have a good recipe I will certainly make kale more often!

I made the dressing with no salt and less soy sauce, because I'm watching my sodium intake. It was very good considering it's kale...which can be bitter. Steaming it without over cooking is the key. I will use this recipe again.

Very tasty way to mow down a whole bunch of kale.  Its hard to measure 12 cups of chopped kale but I think I came close and this served the two of us tonight next to a Middle Eastern chicken dish and we have leftovers for one of us.   After making it a second time we decided this recipe prescribes a little too much lemon and not enough salt for our tastes.  I'll continue adjusting but making it exactly as written is a great start.

Cut stems away and massage the kale with a little olive oil. Sub Balsamic vinegar for the soy sauce, and it will taste less salty. Add Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, and a dash of salt at the table.

This was delicious!  I usually make kale with a lemon and olive oil dressing when doing a salad but never with steamed kale.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out but now I have two great ways to prepare kale.  I steamed the kale in the microwave to speed up cooking time.

I thought this was pretty good and will likely make again. I did substitute home made raspberry vinegar for the lemon juice. I sauted the garlic briefly to mellow the flavor a bit.

good, but next time I think I'll try sauteing the kale in the dressing to get rid of the slight bitter taste of the raw garlic.

Best kale I’ve made!  My teenage kids wanted thirds!  And that’s saying a lot!  I added chicken broth and a large portobello mushroom cut up.  I could eat this every day!

Previously, vinegar was my preferred acid for greens; not anymore. Lemon juice is a perfect match with kale. This dish was delicious. I added a pinch of red pepper flakes. It worked.

Favorite Kale recipe! I use 16oz bag of kale and I can eat all by myself at one meal. 
I use fresh garlic and fresh lemon juice and it tastes much better than minced garlic from a jar and lemon juice form a bottle. 
So easy to make and even my kids says,  "I don't know why I keep eating this. I normally do not like Kale.". 
It goes well with any type of dish- American, Chinese, Mexican.

used lime juice instead of lemon juice and added a teaspoon of the samekh to the dressing. I also chopped up an apple and tossed it in there. It turned out delicious.

The dressing for this is great.  I sautéed the garlic before I added it.  This would go so well on so many other things like seafood, other steamed veggies, salads.  I would have gladly given this dish all five stars, but it was.... kale.  I don't love it.  Sorry, nothing personal, kale.

I absolutely loved this method of cooking kale. After making this twice I preferred my own olive oil, balsamic dressing over the dressing/seasoning mentioned. Definitely going to steam kale from now on! Thank you.

My husband and I love this recipe!     I use low sodium soy sauce and skip the salt, maybe double the lemon but  the ingredients are otherwise the same.  We had it for dinner tonight with broiled haddock and garlic toast.  It was all ready in 15 minutes!

I love that I didn't boil my kale to death! Steamed for the full 10-minutes the leaves were still tough in less time. Wonderful flavor and I added crushed red pepper flakes for a little heat. Very tasty!!

I didn't cook my kale quite as long as I should have, but I like having a different recipe for kale other than my Southern style.  I liked the taste of this recipe, and it was a nice side dish.

I made this for dinner and my husband loved it. We like Kale just about every way it's fixed. I didn't have but about 8 cups instead of 12 so it didn't make much but it was very good.  Will make again soon.

I chopped 1 Whole Foods bunch of kale  which only made ten cups chopped.  Used plenty of garlic and olive oil.  Cooked the minimum time which left  in some crunch.  Good stuff!

We've been growing kale for a few years now, and this is our favorite way to make it! The steaming keeps it nice and "fluffy" and I love the seasoning. I went rather light on the amounts of the seasoning, just to be careful. You can always add more after tasting. :~)

Turned out great! I added a bit more lemon juice approximately 2.5 tblsp. instead of 2 and no salt. Easy & quick to make and the flavors were paired well!

I adjusted the receipe for just 2 of us and I found it did not make enough for 2 full servings. The lemon was very strong. I did put the kale directly into boiling chicken broth to wilt it and that seemed to work well. But for me think I would need to adjust the quantity of kale and play with the dressing a bit unless you are really going for that strong lemon flavor.

This was great.  I used a full bag of organic kale already chopped and a little chicken broth to  help it steam down. Also added a can of garbanzo beans because we love them. Makes a lot with leftovers for a soup, if any is left. Also didn’t add soy sauce because I didn’t have any, but was still fine.

I omitted the soy sauce and steamed the kale in the microwave. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It was very good and a quick side. I'll make it again.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes! I make extra dressing and put it on all kinds of steamed veggies but I make kale nearly every day, sometimes combined with other veggies like cauliflower, broccoli, diced kohlrabi, or parsnips. This dressing is great on pan seared asparagus too.

Super easy, and adds a nice flavor to kale. I have made this several times. I use a healthy bunch of kale, and serve it with either chicken or salmon. If you're avoiding soy, coco aminos is a nice substitute.

This is just the most wonderful side dish on a weeknight, or even for company.  I have made it twice now, and is quickly becoming a family favorite.  The only change I made was to make less than the recipe,  just adjusting the sauce accordingly.  This southern girl loves her greens and the sauce is definitely what makes this dish superb.

I love most things kale but this wasn't one of them. I was certain I would like this tremendously, given the list of ingredients but unfortunately, I was unimpressed. It was okay, was all eaten up but not likely to get served here again.

Do it exactly as written. It's is such a dilicious recipe. I love garlic but others may prefer less.   Just started eating kale to lower my cholesterol. So glad I found this one. I thought I would need to purchase a juicer,  but after doing more research  I found out that steaming the kale was actually more nutrient dense.  I am now
alternating this same recipe with brocolli. 
The recipe now rests on my sugar canister. It's a keeper !

I made this as a side dish, not a salad dish.  This was absolutely delicious.  Since I wanted to keep it warm, I added warm bacon bits.  This will be on my dinner rotation. Thank you for submitting.

This was an easy way to get kale in our diet. Very fresh tasting. I used the zest and juice of half a large lemon, along with 2 tsp EVOO, 1 tsp low sodium soy sauce, fresh ground black pepper and one good sized clove of garlic. I omitted the added salt. Family enjoyed this.

This was good. I had to steam my kale about 50% longer.  I would use half as much sauce and be  very careful with the salt.  Kale has so many nooks & crannies it hangs onto the sauce really well so it was a bit overpowering.  I filled my 2 steamer baskets full of kale (it was probably about half a head) and I'd use half the sauce recipe next time.

I did not have a steamer so I did it in two batches steaming over a half inch of water. Also, I used lime vs lemon juice given what was in my fridge. The dressing was STRONG when I tried it (but yummy!) and I could have used less salt. Next time I'm taking the time to really mince that garlic better so I don't end up with chunks. I'm looking forward to it cooling down and being able to eat it throughout the week.

I made this recipe as stated, and it is, by far, the easiest, best tasting kale recipe I've found.  I don't know why I've never tried steaming it before, but now I will not make it any other way. Sautéing kale never seemed to cook it enough to a consistency I liked.  Two out of three of my kids loved it, and with veggies, that rarely happens. My 4 year old couldn't get enough.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I finally found a way to eat kale! In the past, anyway that I made it fell flat but this recipe was easy and delicious! I do not have a steamer but I put the kale in the microwave with a little bit of water and covered it for 10 minutes! It was perfect!

Tasty. I used light Tamari instead of soy sauce for reduced sodium and it was very good. I steamed for 10 minutes and felt that timing to be good.

Surprisingly good. Had huge amount of leftover kale from another recipe and figured it was a good idea to use it. Very tasty, a little spinach-like which is ok by me. My wife hates cooked spinach and yet loved this.

I cooked it longer than ten minutes as I was using a more mature kale.  I've only tried a few recipes for kale, so while my partner and I both found this recipe an acceptable way to get a nutritious food into the diet, I'll be checking other recipes to see if I can find anything we like better.

Delicious, healthy dish! Turned out so flavourful - even my husband, who doesn't like cooked kale, thought it was great. Made a couple small changes. Boiled the kale a little first, then sautéed it with the rest of the ingredients. Also, used cooking wine in place of half of the lemon juice and didn't add any salt.

DELISH!! I also added feta cheese and fresh cherry tomatoes from the garden. For the dressing I added a little honey to even out the acidity of the lemon.

Really good!  I cooked my kale in chicken broth as some of the others. Accidentally added 1 tbsp of soy instead of 1 tsp, still good!  Such a fast and easy way to cook kale!

I bought a huge bag of chopped kale at the grocery marked down to $1.50 - so I went on a search how to cook it and found this recipe on my favorite site!  This was a very flavorful side dish.  When steaming the kale, I added a Knorr's cilantro bullion, and a chicken bullion to the water.  As one reviewer recommended, I added cilantro (paste) to the marinade.  (I love cilantro with most anything.)  The flavors melded nicely and made a delicious dish.  This was my first attempt at cooking kale, so I'm very happy with the result.  Will definitely make it again. And I've already forwarded the recipe to several friends.

Outstanding. I went to the store to but more kale just so I could eat this again. I'm gonna try less garlic just because I'm not a huge raw garlic fan. Again, outstanding!!!!

I bought a HUGE bag of kale from the market recently and needed some recipes.  I tried this last night and it was both simple and quite tasty! Mine cooked down to about 3-4 cups worth of kale in 7 minutes and was just the right consistency. I really liked the tangy dressing and will probably try that on other veggies as well since they were items always found in my cupboard.  Wow - cupboard - old much?  :)

This really surprised me.  I have used kale in soups but never tried it as a cooked green.  But, since I have an overabundance in my garden I was determined to at least try it.  I really like this recipe.  I didn't have enough lemon on hand so I substituted for half lemon with lime juice.  I topped mine with some homemade pique to give it a little more kick.  Yum

I thought it was good and will use again.  I'm trying to incorporate more greens in our diet.  I followed the recipe then threw in some pine nuts, added just a splash of red wine vinegar (something my family always likes on their greens), and ground some fresh parmesan on top.  It was a hit.  I was going for a Mediterranean type meal and made a quick version of pork scaloppini with mushrooms using some left over pork loin, then topped the meal off with a slice of cheese-jalapeno focaccia bread (store bought). It made it a quick, easy, tasteful meal that wasn't too high in bad fats and carbs.
I read some of the negative comments and think some problems may have been with the cooking of the kale itself.  I had two large bunches that I steamed in a big pot for a little over 10 minutes, until it was a little soft.  I did salt the kale while steaming, but fairly lightly.  After it cooked, I drained it, pealed off the leaf portions, tore it up, and threw away the stems.  I measured out the ingredients per recipe, and tossed as directed and added the pine nuts.  It just slightly coated the big bowl of kale (no liquid left over), and the amount and balance of flavor was just about right to me, but I do like using both garlic and lemon in cooking.  I didn't add but a grind of salt to the seasoning mixture the since it already called for soy sauce, but did add several grinds of black pepper. At that point, I tasted it and decided to add the splash of red wine vinegar and parmesan.

Fantastic! Made this using 1 cup chicken broth as others suggested and it's by far my favorite kale recipe. Use fresh lemon juice. I also added a little more soy sauce because I love the flavor. I mixed the sauce ingredients and added to kale after about five minute of steaming so the garlic would cook just a bit. Plated with chicken tenderloins sautéed in EVOO with garlic and lemon juice, salt, and pepper and it was a perfect under 20 minute dinner from start to finish.

I recently had a kale caesar salad at a restaurant which got me thinking about trying to reproduce the flavor in cooked kale. My first attempt was almost exactly this recipe except I used asian fish sauce instead of soy sauce and topped it with cheese.

We ate it all, but I probably won't prepare it this way again, it was just too "sharp" and lemony to me. I did add Sunflower Seeds and some Feta Cheese to the serving on my plate which cut down on the lemon flavor and gave it more depth of flavor.

I make kale in a variety of ways. What I loved about this was just how simple it is. I did not change anything and when I served it my husband said it was his new favourite kale recipe (and I have some goodies). Making it again tonight!

It was quite tasty with the melding of different flavors, and for one who doesn't normally eat kale, it was quite memorable and delicious!

Realizing the heath benefits of kale, I decided that this recipe would be my first. It was great! I bought a large bag of pre-washed and cut kale from the grocery store, which made preparation a breeze. Instead of soy sauce, I added two chopped marinated sun dried tomatoes. Served this alongside pasta with Arrabiatta sauce, some warm Italian bread with seasoned olive oil and a nice bottle of Pinot Noir.  :)

Used Braggs instead of soy. Make sure you chop that garlic up small.  Left out additional salt as soy/braggs has plenty for me.

This was my first adventure in preparing kale and it is delicious. Unfortunately for husband, he won't eat it because of the amount of garlic.  His loss!

This was easy. I didn't steam the kale on the stovetoop, but in the microwave. I didn't make as much since I was only cooking for myself. I thought the garlic, lemon, and soy sauce was a good combination, and I left the kale in the bit of the liquid that resulted from the steaming. I didn't have straight olive oil, but used a canola/olive oil blend. I didn't add extra salt, but I probably could have used a tiny bit more pepper than the sprinkling I gave mine. I would totally make this again.

I loved the flavours of the sauce with the kale! I used bagged baby kale, which shrank down quite a bit, so I cooked and added some frozen spinach to stretch it out. I will use full leaf kale next time, and take a picture!

It came out okay.  It's my first time making kale, so it's probably that I have to get use to the taste.  It smelled delicious!  Maybe next time I'll try it with the chicken stock for a meaty flavor.  Overall, it was still good and edible.  Thanks.

Really good.  Next time I'll double kale and sauce.  Barely made enough for three people.  Used half a bag of kale.

My husband made a side dish of sauted sweet peppers, onions and peanuts. We decided to combine the kale dish with the pepper dish.  I liked the way the sweet peppers mellowed the kale.  The peanut crunch was also good.  I used 3 cloves of garlic as I love garlic!

I followed the instructions quite closely, and I have to say I loved the results. We're signed up to CSA so we get kale every once in a while, and beyond tossing it into soups I did not know what to do with it. 
This is recipe is awesome. I think it's the lemon juice and garlic that make it really work by softening the kale even more and taking away the bitterness. 
I had very young kale and I followed the cooking time, I believe with older and thicker plants cooking time would need to increased. It should also be great to steam it with white wine and shallots, like one does with mussels.
Thanks for such simple and delicious recipe!

Not sure about this one.  I have never had kale...have wanted to try it as it has been getting so much press lately.  I made this as written.  I liked, my husband thought it just ok, and the teenage kids didn't care for it at all.

I tried the recipe using chicken broth for steaming. It was alright. It was a little tangy for a warm vegetable in my opinion. Maybe better cold?

It was quite flavorful and proved to be a wonderful accompaniment to the baked chicken. One criticism of my wife's, with which I heartily agree, is that if you are going to use soy sauce, there is no need for the salt, as the former is loaded with it. I will certainly try this one again, but as I implied, without the salt.

I've made this recipe several times and the whole family has loved it each time. It's a great way to brighten up kale and makes a yummy side dish for pork or chicken and is also a quick snack or appetizer.

Yum, Yum! I changed the dressing to include a squirt of dijon mustard, but no soy, and no salt.
 I did not steam the kale, i tossed it with kalmata olives, cherry tomatoes and a bit of gorgonzola, then added the delicious dressing.

It was over the top good

Was yummmy. This kale with rice, a nice little meal. It was a bit on the lemon-y side.  I would probably try going a little lighter on lemon and a little heavier on soy & garlic next time.

Wow, really enjoyed this dish.  It was the first time I cooked kale, and I love how easy this recipe is and that it uses ingredients I have on hand.  Can't beat that! I cut it in half for just hubby and me.

The only change I made is to steam the kale in a steamer and then toss it with the mix described. I used very little salt and a good amount of pepper, it was a hit and I have made it repeatedly to great reviews.

Awesome! This recipe is so easy to make and full of flavor! Other than the kale, most of the ingredients should be on hand in your pantry. I made it for the first time tonight and can foresee myself making it again and again. Actually, the dressing would be delicious over fish as well. The one addition I made (to use up veggies) was a handful of cherry tomatoes at the last minute or two.

I always make this. Don't over-steam the kale or add too much lemon.

I bought Kale and then didn't know what to do with it.  This is one of the only recipes I could find and I love it!  I make this almost every week and my 2 year old likes it too.  I will say, I don't follow the measurements exactly.  I make 2-3 servings and I double almost all the ingredients: soy, lemon juice, pepper, garlic.  I like a lot of flavor so I'm not sure how it tastes if you just put in 2 tablespoons lemon, etc.  But I do love this recipe and I've sent it to others to try as well.

Had a huge bunch of kale so I made kale chips and then found this recipe and it turned out pretty good too. I was out of lemons so I had to use limes.

This is my first attempt at cooking kale.  It wasnt bad, but the lemon juice was way too overpowering.  Probably will try a different recipe next time.

This is different, in a good way! 
I made the exact recipe and thought it was pretty good... but missing something, so I made a second batch and added about 1/4 tsp of extra lemon, a couple dashes of aged balsamic vinegar, and a small squirt of sriracha! I guess I made it more Asian Kale than Mediterranean!
I prefer mine, but the original was good too.

I added it to white sauce (with Cheddar cheese) and poured them on pasta, and it was incredible. Thanks for sharing.

I had never prepared or eaten Kale.  I got some in my bountiful basket and didn't want to waste it.  Made this recipe and LOVED it.  I'm no longer afraid of Kale lol

I don't know what it was, but this was awful tasting to me.  Too bitter and too garlicky??? I don't know, but I only finished it because I didn't want to waste the health benefits of the kale.  My husband wouldn't eat more than a couple of bites. :(
