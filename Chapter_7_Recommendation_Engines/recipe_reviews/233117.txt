I adjusted the batter so it wouldn't be doughy and it wasn't but I was never able to get the berry mixture to thicken, there was no serving this warm unless you wanted blueberry syrup for your ice cream. Once chilled it did thicken up. The flavor was bland and uninspiring.

I hate to disagree with the other reviews but I loved this recipe.  It was easy to assemble, quickly cooked and delicious.  I added a bit more corn starch than was called for which gave the berries a good consistency.  My family gave it a "make this again" vote.

I did not care for this recipe.The dough was spongy, did not rise, and had barely any flavor.
