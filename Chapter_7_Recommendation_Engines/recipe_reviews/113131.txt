Simply the best chicken potpie I have tasted and my family loves it. This is my second time making it and decided to use Sherry Cooking Wine, definitely tasted a lot better than White Wine. I would recommend a bottom and a top crust, but cook the bottom crust for about 5 minutes that way your bottom crust will be more crispy. Also, add a 15 oz can of diced potatoes and cut the frozen vegetables to 1 cup of carrots or corn and 1 cup of peas (if you like them) and I mixed everything in one pot this time and still turned out GREAT!!!  Too many dishes last time. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is absolutely a great recipe. It lays out the steps of making a roux and when to add fresh veggies or frozen. I doubled the veggies at the begining adding 4 carrots, onion, celery and 3 cloves minced garlic. I also sauted 4 cups of mushrooms until the liquid had evaporated and set them aside to add with the peas. I also added red pepper flakes for some heat to the sauce. Lastly to lighten it up, I used fat free evaporate milk and low sodium broth. I made this in a casserole dish and used Bisquick for the crust. Followed the recipe on the box,  2cups bisquick, 1 cup milk and 1 egg.  After 10 min in the oven I brushed it with egg white wash.
It turned out beautiful and brown. I let is rest for almost an hour. It was perfect to cut into, maintained its shape. What awesome comfort food!

Classic comfort food!  I made my own crust...so easy:  2 cups all purpose white flour, 2 1/2 t. salt, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/4 cup cold milk, waxed paper.  Place flour and salt in small mixing bowl.  Measure milk and oil, then pour together over flour.  Quickly stir with a fork (do not over mix).  Press dough into ball--do not knead and cut ball in half.  Working with each half, press into flattened circle and place between 2 sheets of waxed paper.  Using a rolling pin, roll each dough half to size needed to cover pie plate.  Remove top waxed paper and using bottom paper to assist, flip crust over onto pie plate.  Then remove second wax paper.

This was fantastic!  In addition to the vegetables called for, I added a small diced potato and some frozen peas.  The sherry is an absolute must for a rich savory sauce. Will definitely make again!

I couldn't believe how good this turned out.  I joined the Allrecipes club just so I could rate this recipe.  I was never a fan of peas and carrots, but I used baby sweet peas (which were great!), and instead of carrots I used corn and whole button mushrooms.  I also added a little nutmeg, and I used 2 crusts for each pie (1 for top & 1 for bottom) instead of only 1 crust.  The cream sauce tastes wonderful, and when the pie is cut, the sauce does not run out like with frozen pot pies, so it cuts very nicely.  I also boiled boneless chicken breasts instead of using rotisserie chicken and it came out great!  Enjoy!  It really tastes great!!!  I will make it again & again!!!

This is my favorite meal to give to friends when a new baby comes or someone could use an easy dinner.  What's best is that it makes 2 so I can keep one and give one away.  I've made it several times now and do not vary at all from the recipe.  I may try adding the bottom crust sometime, but I do love it as is.  Great recipe!

My husband is not a fan of of chicken potpie but LOVED this recipe.  Made half the recipe (should have made the entire recipe as it was that good) and added a clove of garlic.

I was looking for a recipe for chicken potpie that was not made with canned soup.  I was so please when I ran across this recipe - IT IS PERFECT.  I made just as stated with the exception of adding two minced cloves of garlic.  To be honest, I think the garlic was not a good addition and I will not include it next time I make it.  (This coming from a garlic lover!)  I could taste the sherry in this dish and it just made over-the-top good.

Uncluttered, uncomplicated goodness. As those diners from the 40s used to advertise in neon window lights, "Good Eats"!! The Sherry imparts a subtle sweetness. Knowing this, I used half Chardonnay in place of half the Sherry. I also sprinkled in about 2 tsp fresh lemon juice and laced gently with a tsp of white wine Worcestershire sauce, which lends a lovely depth to the flavor, but is by no means required. Also stirred in one tsp Dijon mustard and some snipped rosemary from the garden. Just lovely. Comfort food, times 10! BTW, if you want to prep it completely the night before, you can do so by simply brushing a thin coating of butter on the bottom crust (to seal the pastry against becoming soggy from the moisture in the filling,) pouring the filling in the sealed crust, topping with the second crust, fluting, covering and refrigerating. Just preheat the oven and bake when you come home from work for a complete, easy, homey dinner. Edited to add: Since this is now a beloved family favorite, I invested in a super dry Sherry from Jerez, Spain, the home of genuine Sherry.  Expensive, but so worth it! I have dropped the half white wine, using only this  Sherry. Outstanding! I wouldn't have thought it was possible to improve, but this increased the wow factor exponentially.

This is a wonderful recipe, I served it when company came over and was surprised when we didn't have any leftovers!!!  I roasted my own chicken and I also made my own crusts, which added to the already great taste of the pies.  I used frozen baby sweet peas and fresh baby carrots (which I diced pretty small), which gave the meal a naturally rich flavor.  Although it took me a bit longer to put together because I did my own chicken and crusts, it's the perfect Sunday dinner!

This is my first time making pot pie. I used a whole rotisserie chicken, and then made my stock from the carcass instead of buying cans.   I also did not use the sherry/wine instead I just added the extra stock in to replace it. I used a bag of mixed veggies instead of just peas/carrots.   I made one full size pot pie, and then 4 small personal size pot pies (for the kids) they were a hit! Very yummy. Next time I will make 2 large ones and freeze one as its plenty for my family of 6 if you add a salad.

This was quick and very tasty. I didn't have onions or celery so I skipped that step all together. I also did not have any wine and it still was great. Used a top and bottom crust. Will make again, soon!

I will never eat another pot pie again! I have made this several times and its amazing!!! I do make a few changes though...Instead of meat (im a vegetarian) I use portobello mushrooms, always add more spices, add frozen potatoes, and make my own crust from the betty crocker bisquick box. For the crust, I follow the dumplings recipe on the box (just water and bisquick) then I flatten the dough and simply lay it on top of the pot pie, brush with butter, and cook as directed! DELICIOUS!

I made this tonight for dinner and thought that it was super easy and very flavorful. I made a few changes I don't care for frozen peas so I left them out used corn instead. I used fresh carrots instead of frozen. My husband said all he could taste was onions so my next time i make this I will leave them out or not use nearly the amount that it calls for. Also I love how it made a second one I think that I will pair that with mashed potatoes. Thank you for recipe it is fantastic

I have made this recipe about 10 times now and it is just perfect.  Comes out great every time. The last time I made it I used the leftover turkey and it was delicious.  I put half the filling in my pie dish and cover with pie crust and bake and put the remaining filling in the freezer. It is easier to freeze it in a container, take it out defrost it and then put in pie dish, add crust and cook.

I would like to say - this is the best chicken pot pie in the world - My husband does not like chicken pot pie and he loves this... I did change some things...when I cooked the chicken I added salt & pepper, and about 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning while it was cooking. Once the chicken was done; the cooked chicken juices filled the bowl - I used the juices as part of the sauce (very tasty). Also when I was cooking the onions and celery - I added about 1Tbsp. of flour and cooked for an extra minute. I found that the sauce was watery and I thought by adding the extra tbsp. of flour the onion and celery mixture; it would help thicken it when it was in the oven baking. P.S. DO NOT use dried parsley - it is not the same as using fresh parsley. It turned out perfectly! This is a great meal for a picky crowd.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  It was so simple to make!  It taste better and more hearty than store bought!  I included some of the chicken skin, particularly the brown, crispy ones, into the mix for more flavor.  I also added a can of no salt added sweet whole kernel corn for more crunch.  I substituted the evaporated milk with lowfat 2% evaporated milk. It still tasted delicious and creamy.  To save more dishes to wash, I made the white sauce in one saucepan on the stovetop starting with the broth and milk, then added all the rest in order.  It came out fine and tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Wonderful and easy.  I put a top crust on the pie and sauteed the chicken.  I did not have enough filling for two pies.  Great leftovers.

This was the BEST!!! but~~I was surprised there wasn't potatoes in the ingredients, I HAD to have potato, it's not potpie to me without out!! I used fresh carrots and potatoes (steamed to tenderness) and add frozen peas) a tip: put the peas in a strainer and run cold watet over it and let sit, for a few and then add it...u don't get the thaw out liquid and they do stay crunchy instead of mushy. I don't feel I "changed" the recipe at all~~~did just as it called but added potatoes...that's all and it was the best I have ever tasted...THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL RECIPE, I will make again and again!!!

Awesome dish! As a home ec. teacher, I am going to teach my students to make this very soon.  I did make several changes. I boiled chicken breast and chopped it into cubes. The chicken broth that I used was a boxed broth that is made with white wine, so I omitted the extra wine. And I made my own crust - 2 cups self-rising flour, 1.5 cups milk, two sticks of butter - and spread it over the top. Fits perfectly in a 9X13 Pyrex dish.

I was looking for a recipe without the bland canned soups in it, and this hit the spot! It was delicious, and my family just about fell off their chairs out of pure joy it was so good! I did add some granulated garlic and oregano to give it additional flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!!

My family liked this very much (I'm vegetarian, so I didn't eat it. The grocery store had no refrigerated pie crust,so I made a crust from refrigerated crescent roll dough, and it worked well. This was faster to put together than stated, which was nice too. Served with a tossed green salad with homemade buttermilk ranch dressing. Thanks!

Awesome recipe. Very detailed instructions and it came out deliciously perfect as is. I might play with the recipe a little more next time but it doesn't really need it at all. Even my picky husband liked it and my son is gobbling it up as I type (daughter is in a picky phase so none for her). Oh and I used shredded chicken from my weekly whole slow cooked chicken with mediterranean spices instead of a rotisserie chicken. yummy yummy yummy

I made this last night and it was absolutely delicious! I made it just as the recipe described.... However I used chicken breasts I had in the freezer, thawed them, chopped them up and seasoned them, and pan fryed them until they were almost cooked (since I knew they would be cooked more in the oven). I used white wine as I did not have sherry. I raised the oven temperature to 425 and cooked for only 20 minutes as I had to speed things along since I had to work. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I since have had two more servings because it is truly a fantastic chicken pot pie recipe! No need to try other recipes again! Thank you!

A great way to use left-over Thanksgiving turkey, but too good to only make it once a year!  I made one, very full, 12" deep-dish pie. I made my own dough. Next time I'll double the dough so I don't have to roll it so thin to fit the large pie plate.  I'll use: 4 cups flour, 1-1/2 teaspoons salt, 1-1/3 cups cold shortening, 3/4 cup ice water or a little less.  I diced the celery, carrots, onions and sauteed them.  While the flavor was great, the texture was off (my fault.)  Next time, I'll chunk the veggies.  I didn't have broth, so I made some with water and bouillion.  I love the addition of evaporated milk.  I added poultry seasonining with the thyme.  Great flavor!

so good.  I used the fat free evaporated milk and frozen seasoning mix that has celery, onions, and green peppers.  I didn't have sherry on hand, and so didn't use it.  Still so very good.

Ok first I have to say I have not actually eaten this yet because it is still in the oven.  With that being said, I am confident this is going to turn out awesome!  The cream sauce was delish!  I made a few adjustments out of neccessity only.  I used some reserved drippings and water in place of the broth just because I didn't have broth.  I also used poultry seasoning instead of thyme because I didn't have any.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a T!  I am freezing my second pie without the crust and plan to thaw the inside while thawing the crust when I'm ready to use it.

This is my first time that I had made chicken potpie.  I am impressed how this recipe had turned out so delicious.  My parents love it.  however, I did used 1/2 cup of sherry instead of 1/4 cup.  Very yummy dish.  Thank you.  :)

Very good.  I poached some chicken breasts with celery and sage, and then shredded it.  For the veggies, I sauted fresh carrots, mushrooms, and a clove of garlic along with the celery and onion. I added frozen corn and lima beans at the end.  I found that my filling was a little thick, so I had to add more broth.  I also ended up baking about 15 extra minutes in order to get a nicely browned crust.

Hubby is not a pot pie fan, but said this was the best he had ever eaten.  I baked my own chicken the day before, and in place of frozen veggies I used one large can of Homestyle Veg-All (large cut veggie mix) and it worked perfectly.  I rolled the two pie crusts together to form a rectangle and baked this in a 11 X 15 baking dish instead of 2-9 inch pie pans.  It would make a great potluck dish.  I might cut back on the thyme a bit next time or maybe add some poultry seasoning; but overall this was a great recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

Wow- this is excellent.  My family devoured it- and there is another one sitting in the freezer!  The only thing that I changed was that I used a mix of carrots, peas, corn and green beans.  Also, I skipped the celery and onion.  This is a keeper!

I make this recipe ALL the time. Super flavorful (even without the parsley which I never have on hand). I often make this when I'm taking a meal to someone's house because it freezes so well. I find it needs to bake a little longer than an hour though when it's frozen. Also, be sure to cover the edges of your pie crust with foil until the last 10 minutes of baking. This will keep the edges from getting too browned!

Eh, I don't know, this was just o.k. for me.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't find anything special about this recipe, not any better than any of the other chicken pot pie recipes I have tried.  I might try it one more time but it's not at the top of my list.

This recipe is delicious and perfectly easy.  Loved it, and love that it makes a bunch.  Made several smaller ones and used any old bag of mixed vegetables (corn, carrots and green beans) and it was fine.

Awesome pot pie! Instead of rostissere chicken i used chicken from a can (which is mostly used for pickle salad). I hate celery so i left that out as well as the onions and wine. Seriously who puts that in pot pie? O.o I boiled the peas & carrots in poultry seasoning which made it taste awesome. This is my first attempt at a chicken pot pie & by the smell of it I think I did pretty good! Can't wait to taste it. Thanks for posting!

Absolutely wonderful!  I will never buy pre-made again.  I am actually going to make my own "little" pot pies (like they sell in the stores) so I can have one whenever I want.

This recipe was excellent. I made two pies (doubled the recipe) and with one of them I experimented with the garlic idea that other reviewers mentioned. I have to agree with cook's rating of the garlic. I usually love garlic, but it just wasn't that good in this recipe. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I highly recommend it.

I made my own chicken broth by simmering a whole chicken in 8 cups water along with an onion, 2 carrots, a celery stalk, a bay leaf and 5 peppercorns for 1-1/4 hrs.  Then I cut up the chicken for the potpie, and it was sooo tender.  For the crust, instead of pie dough, I used phyllo.  Brushed a few sheets of phyllo with melted butter and then crumpled up each sheet and placed on top of the saucy mixture.  Fantastic!!!

This is a great recipe.  Only change I made was to add a bit of garlic, shredded swiss and fresh carrots instead of frozen.  I give 5 stars but my family gives less.  They were just not high on it. We didn't save the leftovers as I was only one really crazy about it.

SO GOOD!  We used fresh carrots and subbed fresh green beans for peas as my son is allergic to peas.  We steamed both veggies for a few minutes prior to adding to make sure they would be soft enough when the pie was done.  The sauce was a little bland for our liking so I added a cup and a half of cheddar anda clove of garlic.  We really liked that this didn't have the cream soup.  I can't wait to make it again!  We loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

FANTASTIC!  I made this for family/friends last night and got GREAT reviews.  One friend who is a known pot pie lover proclaimed this to be the best pot pie he has ever had.

I didn't have frozen veggies so used fresh green beans, onion, carrots & celery.

I served with salad & fresh dinner rolls.

Easy to make, easy to eat and makes great leftovers.

The recipe took quite a long time to make, but it was so worth it. I forgot the sherry. This was my first pot pie ever. I added aome cheese because I thought it would be dry. The cheese was great (swiss) but it would have been perfect without it. Next time I'll remember the sherry. Oh, so good!

This was great!  I made my own crust (top and bottom) and put it in a small casserole dish rather than a pie plate.  I used fat free evaporated milk and canned veggies instead of frozen. Oh and I didn't have celery or fresh parsley. 

My husband said I can make it anytime (he just would have preferred less onions).

Wow.. this is really the best chicken potpie. I followed everything the recipe called for except I sauteed the celery and onions in my drippings from the chicken I roasted..(I used the Juicy Roasted Chicken recipe which I really think made a HUGE difference.. the chicken was phenomenal).. I ended up doubling everything up and freezing the other two pies.. I gave the one pie to my sister-in-law and brother who just had a baby...can't wait to eat em again!

So delicious!  Everyone said this was the best pot pie they've had...and I agree..it was so thick and creamy!  I used white wine instead of sherry since it's all I had.  I stayed 95% true to the recipe.  I roasted two chicken breasts on the bone and then cut them up.  Since that was only half the amount of chicken the recipe called for I added some small diced potatoes.  I poured it all into one 9x9 square glass dish.  No other changes, turned out so incredible.

This is a wonderful wholesome pot pie recipe. Pure comfort. Made the filling as written for the most part but instead of adding salt to taste I add Bouillon (chicken flavor) a little at a time to taste. I prefer to make individual pot pies so I only have to use a top pie crust. The filling is very thick and hearty, not soupy like some recipes. Even DH approved and he's harder to please than most. Another keeper from Pam!

Fantastic comfort food to the max! I couldn't find my Mum's recipe so I was in search of something similar...found it! :) I did use 2% milk in place of evaporated milk and used all stock. Will be making this again and again. Very down home and wonderful. I did make my own crust with a ration of 1 part flour to 1/4 of butter and 1/4 crisco (by weight) and a dash of salt...My mum's recipe for crust and it's always buttery and flakey. I did do a one pot type of cooking. Did the veggies and instead of heating the milk in the microwave I added the flour to the veggies and cooked for a couple minutes to get rid of the "flour" taste. (the roux) and then added the chicken stock and milk (cold) and stirred briskly then added the chicken back in. Turned out perfect...no lumps. :) Absolutely yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

I just needed the "sauce part" of the recipe as I ran out of canned soup (my usual way of doing it). Am I glad I tried this, it's so worth the extra effort (not so long to make as I thought). It tastes so much better and the white wine give the sauce a little kick. My changes were that I halved the recipe needing only one pie, and I used the whole can of milk plus 2 onces of water and 1 tsp of chicken granules instead of the broth. I thickened it with about 1tbs of corn starch. My new way of making a pot pie from now on. Thanks!

I used 2 (15 oz.) packages of pie crusts so the potpies would have a bottom and top crust. I altered the 9 Tablespoons flour to 1/2 cup flour. I also added 8 oz. of fresh sliced mushrooms. Aside from those minor adaptations, I prepared the recipe as written. Turned out yummy. Thanks.

I have made this twice now! Both time it turned out really well! I do put a crust ont he bottome though as well, cooking it as an empty shell a little before adding the filling. I did also use a little different combination of veggies, I used steamed baby carrots, spteamed potato, and canned corn. Yummy!

Like others, I added a (criss-cross) crust on top and used more vegetables (a mix of carrots, corn, peas and green beans). I did keep the celery and onions. It took me a little longer to make it than I would have preferred but I am battling the flu so I wasn't cooking with all of my mental spices! We love it. Can't wait to cook the one in the freezer!

I've made this a couple times now and gotten really good results. A bit heavy on the onion for my taste, though. I always end up with enough for two deep dish pies.

This was amazing!! It took me about an hour to do everything, but I didn't do alot of preparation before. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used frozen vegetables and a boxed pie crust. The pie crust was perfect, I just would have prefered fresh veggies. I will make this again and again though...it tasted so delicious, and made a ton of food! We froze the left over inside mix, and I will just have to make a fresh crust :)

Scrumptious!!  The scrawny rotisserie chicken I got only yielded 3 cups of chicken. So only got to make one pie.   YUM! I never knew to make that sauce from butter, flour, broth, evap milk and sherry! This is ultimate comfort food. My hubby ate it up.

Wow! Worth the time & effort. Probably my favorite pot pie recipe. Thanks for a great one! I didn't have pie crusts so I substituted boxed corn muffin mix with a bit more milk than called for & thyme. Great complement!

You  don't want to see a picture of mine. This recipe was way too complicated for me but would have been outstanding  if I had been able to accomplish the directions. If recipes were rated on how difficult or easy they were to make,  this one would have to be way over on the difficult side.  I don't understand why people are calling it quick and easy.  I am not a "seasoned" cook and it is definitely not for beginners.  12 ingredients (really?!) made it hard,  but I'm sure that's what would have made it taste so good,  if done correctly.  I became very frustrated with how long it took me to make it and how difficult  it was.  It took more than 30 minutes just  to get the chicken off the bones and an hour to clean up the mess. If someone else had made it I would've given it five stars! :-) Back to frozen dinners.

I made my own double pie crusts which I glazed  with 1Tbsp cream + 1 egg yolk mix before baking. I roasted a few chicken breasts in the oven with some olive oil and salt. I baked it on the middle lower rack for 15 min at 425, 25 min at 350 and then I broiled it for 5-10 min to obtain a nice golden crust. I used Sherry instead of white wine. I'm sticking with this recipe, it's perfect.

We liked this recipe, however, I gave it 4 stars because it is time-consuming to make. Also, it would be much better if there were a bottom crust. My husband really wanted that. It's definitely a good comfort food.

Cut the amount of onion in half if you make this recipe. It's alot of work. Also, I would use canned veggies if I made this again.

This is the best chicken pot pie recipe.  The only changes I made was to add a little less chicken, added mushrooms, and various mixed veggies.  Other than that I didn't change anything else.  Everyone in my family, young and old, enjoyed this recipe.

Always great!  Just out of preference I don’t use celery and I use fresh thyme when it’s on hand.  My only helpful hint : I like a bottom crust with pies.  So I put one pie crust in the oven for about 20 minutes to let it get set, then I add the filling and top it with the other pie crust ... same baking instructions from that point on.  That also means you need to buy 4 total crusts if you want to complete pies.  We usually make one and reserve the extra filling for a future pie.  Great recipe and we’ve made it a ton!  THANKS

A cold weather hit with my family! Next time, I will eliminate putting the milk and broth in the microwave, it could just as easily have been folded into the mixture slowly. I added a little bit more flavor with spices but I'm definitely keeping this recipe in my book!

VERY good! I followed the recipe as written and this was a big hit in my home.  My only tip is, consider using a low sodium chicken broth as the dish turned out a tad salty.

I'm giving a five and it's still in the oven!  I tasted the sauce and it was amazing.  I used potatoes,  carrots,  and celery.  I just put the flour on the veggies and sautéed it a few minutes.  Faster and works the same.  I've never made this with Evaporated milk or wine and the flavor is awesome!

My family was very happy with the way this recipe turned out.  I used a frozen pie crust because I had one handy and I like a bottom to a pot pie.  Also the bag of frozen veggies I had in the freezer also had green beans in it. Still good =) I'm definitely making it again!

Although I'm not the world's greatest pot pie fan, I served this to my family and a friend and they thought it was very good.  I didn't stray much from the recipe, except I added a bottom crust- partially baking and cooling it beforehand so the crust wouldn't be soggy at the bottom, and I used fresh cut carrots because I prefer them a bit al dente.  For the chicken, I used (slightly under) four packages of pre-cooked fresh carved roasted chicken that was on sale, and which saved some time.
I appreciated the accuracy of measurements and ingredients of this recipe, which produced balanced flavors, sauce consistency, and exact amount of filling for two generous pies.  I gave it four stars based upon 5 reviews at my dinner table: 3@liked it, 2@loved it.

Absolutely delicious!  I added a little more of the moisture so I could add cubed potatoes.  I also used fresh carrots instead of frozen.  This is such a good potpie!

I made 4 of these pies for Christmas dinner this year (none of my grown children were interested in cooking or eating a big turkey dinner) and every bite got eaten.  I made 2 pies today and added a bit more thyme and half and half for a saucier filling and added some mushrooms.  This recipe is simply the best!  I will never eat store bought pot pies again!!!

Down home chicken pot pie with a fancy pants roux?! Who would have thought you could feel so pampered makin this creamy midwestern classic! One tip for taking this over-the-top? Skip the frozen veggies and buy fresh organic carrots and beautifully bitter radishes, all shredded and ready for beddy (after you eat, of course). The bitterness of the radish adds just a subtle jolt to perk up this otherwise flawless farmer favorite!

This is delicious and not difficult, my white sauce clumped with the addition of the hot liquid but was not a problem in the finished pie. The filling is creamy with the perfect texture. I used half and half, not milk. I used top and bottom crust, vegetables as written were perfect, Costco rotisserie chicken package ( makes 2 pies), cooking sherry that I had in the pantry, added  healthy dose of Cajun seasoning to counteract blandness. It added just the right zing which I think the recipe needed. We loved this pie and I plan on giving these to my friends as gifts.

Great recipe, thanks!  Definitely use dry sherry - it adds so much flavor.  I was out of evaporated milk and substituted 2%; will make sure I don’t do that again.  Our only issue was that it could have been a little more moist, and that may have been the problem.  Other than that it was wonderful!

Great comfort food and very easy to make!  I made this at high altitude and should have adjusted and increased the amount of liquid for the sauce. Regardless, it was still a very tasty and easy meal to prepare.

Since discovering this recipe about two months ago, I have made this dish three times. The recipe is seriously perfect the way it is. I would not change a thing. I did bake this in a 9x13 so it was more of a casserole. It only needs to bake an extra 10 minutes that way. Everyone should make this atleast once because it is so simple and delicious!!

I halved the recipe and made just 1 pie.  I added a small potato and used 2% milk instead of evaporated and used Sherry cooking wine.  It was delicious!  I will make this again.  I also used a bottom crust.

I make this on a regular basis for my family of four and usually freeze the second pie. I make it according to the exact recipe and it is always a hit! My kiddos love it and usually anyone I make it for asks for the recipe. I really think the roux really makes it as does the wine/sherry. And I think the evaporated milk gives it a richer flavor.

I don't usually change a recipe much. But today, I had too! This sounded delish!!! I just didn't have all the right ingredient and we also have food allergies to work around some times... today was more what I didn't have to work around!!!

Very tasty.  Well worth the extra effort versus making it with cream of X soup for the sauce.

Best pot pie I have ever made.  Yes, there are a few more dishes than I would have liked but the taste of this was great.  I will make this again.

I absolutely love this Chicken Pie recipe.  It freezes so well and is always handy to have one or two in your freezer.

Wonderful !  Add chopped potatoes!  Brush egg white on pie before baking!  Sherry also adds a lot to the taste of recipe.  Also, this recipe makes two pies, but has only one package of crust in recipe , so, buy two packages of crust.

I added more broth to make the filling somewhat lighter.  Also used white wine in place of sherry.  Served to guests.

I didn't have frozen peas and carrots so I used canned. Also, no white wine so I used white grape juice. Roasted a chicken in the oven.  Made a homemade crust and put the filling into a 13X9 in baking pan and put the crust on top. Will make it again because we loved it. Will make sure to have the correct ingredients on hand the next time. Great recipe, thank you.

Really good. Because I add more veggie and potatoes, it was a little dry, so I'll need to increase the amount of sauce. But we all really liked it. Very comforting food.

The ingredients are wrong.  You need two packages of pie crusts for a total of four pieces of pie dough.    
I also upped the seasonings and added some garlic, poultry seasoning and a bunch of cracked pepper.

I followed the recipe exactly, using a good sherry - not the grocery store kind.   It made 2 pies, so I froze one that my family will get to enjoy another time when I don't have time to cook.  Comfort food at its best.

Really delicious! I struggled a bit with the sauce, it got a bit clumpy when I added the milk/broth mixture, but managed to fix it.

This is good, but the recipe is much more complicated than it needs to be.  All the prep can be done in one pot.  If you're using raw chicken, cook that first.  Remove from pot.  Add some butter or oil or both and cook your veggies (I used onion, celery and carrots) .  Cook on medium heat until softened.  Add the butter.  Add the flour(  9 tbs is 1/2  cup)  (Why call it 9 TBs. instead of 1/2  cup?)and stir until it is obvious that your mixture needs liquid.  There is no need to heat  the broth and milk.  Add them and stir.  Taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking.  Add the chicken and you're done with the filling.  Divide and proceed with recipe as written.  I will never understand why  people try to make cooking so complicated.  Pour a glass of wine, put on some music and cook.

So easy and great use of the rotisserie chicken. Had rave reviews from both friends who came over for dinner. Can substitute any veggies inside the pie. Thanks!

I added more thyme and rosemary and used the mire poix from trader joes (made it so easy!). I also baked the pies about 50-55 minutes. So delicious, will be making this again!

have made this many times, mixing up ingredients as available, keeping to the white sauce base and sometimes increasing amounts to make three deep dish pies so I can freeze one or two uncooked and ready to go for a meal. They take a lot longer to cook if you are cooking them from Frozen. don't overfill the pie plate because it will bubble up a lot and run all over the oven if you're not careful. I keep this healthier by only using a top crust and spraying the pie plate with Pam before filling. homemade crust with thyme leaves and milk wash gives high end result, still great with ready-made crust. today I am trying this with three pies, skip the Sherry, add a mixture of Parmesan and cheddar to the feeling and just under the top crust for something different. always a fantastic recipe no matter what vegetables you choose to use! It is great to use frozen chopped celery carrot onion if you wish for convenience and can skip the sauteing stage of this pie. I prefer to boil my own chicken, remove the fat, save the broth for this recipe and freeze the rest and use that chicken instead of rotisserie but obviously it adds much more time to your work. always a great recipe no matter which way you do it!

This was very good! I made my own crust mainly because I forgot to buy one when I went to the store. I also halved the recipe to make 2 individual pies which still, for us turned out to be 6 meals. I also couldn't find frozen peas and carrots, so I bought a frozen back of peas, carrots, corn and green beans. I would do that again if I made this again. I really liked the corn in it. All in all, I thought this recipe was easy and delicious. I also was happy to use a recipe that didn't use heavy cream!

This is how my DH rated this recipe.  He helped me assemble the ingredients and supervise the seasoning. We halved the recipe and followed it closely except for the additional chicken stock to moisten the filling more (DH likes his sauces).  Sadly, we did not have cooking wine but will make sure to add it next time.  Used both top and bottom crusts--the bottom crust was soggy since I only baked it for 30 minutes.  Will increase baking time next time.

Delicious! The sherry really made this taste amazing! I made my own butter crust, used fresh vegetables that I sauteed, and shredded up a Costco rotisserie chicken. I LOVE this recipe!

Instead of making a pie, I used this to top buttermilk biscuits for an open-faced pot pie. I added garlic powder, ground sage, and was a bit more generous with the white wine. Absolutely delicious!!!

Great recipe!  I was out of celery and parsely, but it was still delicious.  I did add some rosemary and sage and about a 1/4 cup of cream in place of 1/4 cup of the chicken broth, because I actually did have that!  It was wonderful.  I will definitely be making this again!

I used dried parsley that I put in at the end, as instructed. I think if I had put them in earlier in cooking, I would have achieved more of the flavor.

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet.  This is, hands down, one of my favorite recipes.  Anywhere.  I follow it to a "T" and get beaming results.  I use a ready made pie crust and store bought rotisserie chicken to cut down on the cook time.

I followed this recipe except I used a bottom crust.  It turned out looking beautiful and it tasted great too.  The only change I would make in the future is to reduce or eliminate the thyme.  I wasn't crazy about that flavor, but the rest was delicious!

This recipe is so good!  I boiled bone-in chicken breasts and ribs and used the resulting stock for the chicken broth.  I cubed some potatos and boiled them in the broth for a few minutes til soft, then removed them to the bowl with the chicken and continued with the recipe.  I agree with other reviewers here that this recipe includes a wonderful, rich white sauce - don't change it!  I made one pot pie for dinner, and froze the remaining mixture for a future dinner.
