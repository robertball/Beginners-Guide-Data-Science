After reading some of the reviews about it being too dry I decided to add an extra 1/4 cup of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil then reduced the cooking time to 30mins. It turned out deliciously rich and moist.

It was EXTREMELY dry. I could barely eat it. The flavor was not THAT good, but WAS good at the same time. Next time I won't make this recipe.

Unless I did something terribly wrong. This was unbelievable dry. I even cut the 45 min bake time.The frosting recipe did not make enough to even cover cake. The cake was to dry to eat.

This recipe needs to be renamed.  "Sahara Chocolate Cake" would be more appropriate.  I upped the butter and cut the bake time as suggested and I still got a dry mess. I guess I'll pay more attention to the number of stars a recipe has next time...

What I did was I baked it shorter than the given time. And it was really nice! or should I say--almost perfect!

the flavour is great.  clearly an error was made in typing.  It needs a cup ofmilk and some oil.  The cake was ok because I served it for my daughter's birthday with some ice cream.  I am sure the milk and oil would go a long way with moistness.

I've made this cake several times.  My family loves it.  It's my husbands favorite chocolate cake.  I first tried it when it had 5 stars, and was suprised when I came back to it and it only had 3 stars.  Not Dry, but how could it be with with a cup of coffee, a cup of buttermilk, and 1/2 cup of oil.   I only baked it for 35 minutes. ( that's when the toothpick came out clean).  WE LOVE IT.

This recipe turns out dry, dense, and not very flavorful...to call it "Moist Chocolate Cake" is very deceiving.

Unfortunately I made this cake for my Dad's birthday, it looked like a cow pie, and was so dry that one needed a gallon of milk to choke down this monstrosity.

Moist?  NOT!  I learned a lesson here - READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE PROCEEDING!  This cake was sooooo disappointing.  There is NO LIQUID in the ingredients list. This cake is the anti-moist cake.  I recommend you remove this recipe from your site. . . It doesn't produce an enjoyable result.   Sorry.

I made this cake in the 2 9" rounds.  I ran out of cocoa powder and had to substitute 1 oz unsweetened chocolate for 1/4 cup.  Worked fine.  The baking time is definately off.  I baked for 30 minutes and it was a little dry.  Will start testing at 20 minutes next time.  Otherwise, it's a great cake.  The batter was very nice and thick.  Be sure to beat the butter and sugar until fluffy, a good 7-10 minutes.  Maybe that is where previous reviewers had dryness problems.

I wish I’d read other reviews first. The flavor was great but this was the driest cake I’ve ever made. I will redo adding sour cream and less baking time.

I would rate this cake a minus 1 if possible!  I was looking for a chocolate cake made with hot coffee that I had great success with in the past.  Needless to say, I should have read the reviews.  Somehow the milk or buttermilk ingredient was not included in this recipe.  Don't waste the cocoa!!!

The frosting was outstanding, however the cake was incredibly dry.  I even added an extra egg when I noticed how thick the mix was.  Yes, oil or water or both were needed for this cake to be a success, maybe it just was forgotten when typed up.

This cake was dry even when trying to mix it.  I added 1Cup of water and an additional cup of sugar.  Keep poking with a wooden toothpick until it comes out clean.
