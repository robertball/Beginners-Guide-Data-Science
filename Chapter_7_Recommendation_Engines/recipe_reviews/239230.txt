I wish I had leftovers.  This was sooooo good!!  The sauce was incredible.  The chicken was melt in your mouth.  It was just a party going on in your mouth all the way around.  So easy but so fancy.  Chef John you are my hero, you make me look good!  I made EXACTLY as written.  I have wine left and I'd rather make this again than drink it...that says a lot.  You have to serve it with mashed potatoes.  I think it is against the law not to.

I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce was amazing ! I put it together up to the point you put it in the oven. Then held it for an hour before I popped it in the oven. So if you are having company you can do earlier in the day. I have NEVER had a bad recipe from Chef John. He's the bomb!

Who could resist trying a "5 Star Recipe of the Year"? Not me. Followed the recipe almost exactly. For some reason got it in my head that it called for boneless, skinless chicken thighs and actually made a special trip to the grocers for them. It was still absolutely delicious and there was no fat to skim during the final reduction and no bones to deal with while gobbling it down! So tasty we licked our plates!!
Just made this again last night. This time I used the chicken thighs with bone and skin on. I forgot to buy fresh thyme so used about a tsp. of dried.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and EXACTLY like last time it was absolutely, plate licking delicious!

I really enjoy Chef John's videos. Easy to follow and lighthearted. This recipe is awesome. My wife and I absolutely love it. I've cooked it twice now, exactly as the Chef instructs. We live in Georgia, and this is definitely not a "Southern recipe", but it will still make your tongue want to slap your eyeballs out of your head! It is that good! Kudos to Chef John.

I've made this three times now and it's really outstanding.  Word of caution:  if you're a space cadet like me, you'll grab the handle of the pan at some point after it comes out of the oven when you're simmering the sauce...In the 3 times I've made the recipe, I've burned the s*** out of my hand THREE TIMES.  (Yes, I'm an idiot...) - Be careful with that hot pan!  It's worth the pain, though....

Absolutely delicious! I am so looking forward to the colder weather in order to make more comfort recipes like this. Because of personal preference, I added a little more flour to thicken the sauce. No spuds on hand so served over buttered egg noodles and a side of saut√©ed green beans. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is to die for! I had never made Coq au vin before and thought it sounded good. It was INCREDIBLE! My husband said it is a keeper for sure. I made the recipe as it stated except for the thyme-Ionly had ground and it worked fine. Added about a tsp. or a little more. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you Chef John...

Divine!  I have been using All Recipes for about three years now and have made hundreds of recipes found here and this is my first review!!  Make this; do it now!  I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of switching out dried thyme for fresh because my small town grocery does not carry it) and I wouldn't change a thing!  I was nervous about the red wine (I know a crucial ingredient) because I do not like red wine, and even as it was cooking I was thinking I wouldn't like it.  Boy was I wrong!  This dish couldn't be more perfect!  Everyone in the family loved it, even my five year old whom is very picky about what meat he will eat!  I am happy I have wine leftover because I cannot wait to make this again!  Fancy enough for company, simple enough for a week night meal!  Thank you Chef John for an amazing meal!

Discovered this recipe while watching a video from Food Wishes one afternoon.  The red wine reduction sauce was amazing which gave the mushrooms and chicken a wonderful acidic sweetness.  Served this on top of garlic mashed potatoes as recommended by Chef John.  Oh and one more thing:  remember to wear a kitchen mitt when you lift the pan to transfer the sauce on to the chicken.  You don't want to burn your fingers on the pan handle like I did!  Very easy to forget that the handle is still considerably hot from being in the oven.

Edible...nothing special to write home about considering all the work you had to put into this dish with frying the chicken beforehand, etc.  Greasy & uninteresting flavor.

I've got to admit, I'm really confused--but in a good way.  I don't like wine, and the smell while this was cooking was good, but thrown off because I don't really like the smell of wine.  I didn't expect it to be any good because of that.  Boy was I wrong!  The wine enhanced and deepened the flavors that were already there, making them kind of explode one after another.  Such a rich, pleasant experience!  Wonderful recipe, Chef John!

This is a great recipe! I tried to make Coq au Vin before and didn't like it. I had chicken thighs and wine, so I decided to try again with this recipe. It was a slam dunk! I had boneless, skinless thighs. I cooked the bacon first in my skillet, then browned the chicken on both sides in the bacon drippings. Then I made the sauce. Instead of putting it in the oven, I nestled the thighs back into the sauce, covered it and let it simmer for 10 minutes. Oh, mama. My husband and kids LOVED it. The simmering of the sauce with the chicken thickened it, so there was no need for the last step. We used the small amount of excess sauce on the steamed broccoli we had with it. Mmmm, so good. Thanks Chef John!

Made this as one of two main dishes for Christmas dinner. All 10 of us were delighted with the flavor. Made a couple of changes to suit the guests: used turkey bacon and chicken tenders. It still had a delicious taste!  Also made a corn starch slurry to thicken the gravy at the end. Served over mashed potatoes is key to the dish. All we're impressed!

Oh. My. God. This is as good as food gets! We had this last night. Sooo good! It is bursting with flavor but is not a long, complicated recipe that would normally be required to develop such deep savory flavors. This is a winnah! We absolutely will make this again.

Once again, Chef John does not disappoint. This recipe was phenomenal, well worth the time and effort. I followed the recipe exactly, and would not change a thing. The sauce is to die for!  It is excellent paired with mashed potatoes. Thank you, Chef John!

This recipe was among many recommended to me in a request on The Buzz, and looked so good I had to try.  I also watched Chef John's video before making which did help.  I thought it was going to be quite complex but it really was not hard at all to execute!  Perfect dish.  On a side note, I plated the Coq Au Vin over mashed potatoes.  I don't think I would do that again, I would plate them to the side.

This was so good! I didn't have fresh thyme used dried thyme but it turned out great!. I also like my chicken skin a little crispy so at the very end I put it on high on the broil function, otherwise I followed the recipe as directed. Delicious!

This was delicious!!! I made this for a dinner party for 10 of us (scaled the recipe by 1.5) and it was the perfect make-ahead dish. It took me about 3 hours in total (prepping ingredients and cooking) and after it was done, I threw it in the fridge. About 2 hours before serving, I put it on the stove on low heat and re-heated perfectly. I made it in my Dutch  oven.

This was so delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe calls for and it was divine. I used Cote du Rhone for the red wine which is my preferred red for cooking many dishes. My husband said it was absolutely restaurant quality. It was not overly complicated nor did it take much prep time. It would be a great dinner for guests. I'll be making this again and again. Thanks!!!

This was delicious and quite easy to prepare.  i would agree that the bone in Chicken thighs work best.  My husband is still raving about this meal a few days later.  The only reason I did not give it a five is that it was a wee bit bland for my taste.  This is an ideal supper for when my Irish in-laws come for dinner.  They are "meat and potatoes people" and a Moroccan tagine or a tikka massala would not go over well. This will be a great addition to my menu collection for my picky guests.

Just made this for dinner tonight, and it was FABULOUS! 
I love anything cooked with wine, and have never made coq au vin before
It was very comforting dish for winter, and the flavours were just perfect!
I have saved it, and will make it again.
Just be sure to take the time and brown the fonds, as chef John says, it will really bring out the best flavours and give it a rich colour.
Great over roasted garlic mashed potatoes..

I used skin on thighs which I rarely use. I was a bit sceptical about the choice of meat, but it was perfect and I could see why chef John wanted skin on thigh. I spent a bit more time to cook the skin crispy and drain all the fat I could. It was amazingly good. Thank you for the great recipe.

This was so good that I had to roll my stuffed stomach over to my computer to leave a review. My husband is a man of few words, so when he praises my cooking, it‚Äôs as though he‚Äôs reciting me a love poem. It was more like a love song tonight. My whole family loved it and ate every last bit, scooping up extra sauce for their mashed potatoes. The only change I made was to use a Dutch oven since I don‚Äôt have an oven proof skillet large enough.

EXCELENT Chef John!  Wonderful and just as you said. Even the kids loved it. Your video instructions were spot on and very helpful.  Forget the negative review(s),  they must have done something wrong or 'crazy changed' it which drives me nuts.  Everyone was raving about it and it was really a blue ribbon recipe.

Love this recipe! The only thing I didn't really like was the meat itself, it turned out a bit tough. Next time I'll just use boneless skinless thighs or chicken breasts. But the sauce itself is delicious! I added a pinch of oregano to it and it helped with flavor and smell even more. This one is a keeper!

Wow! Very delicious, not a leftover in sight. I followed Chef John's recipe exactly as written but with one slight variation, I used peppered bacon. It came out fabulous, even my picky granddaughter ate every last bite on her plate. Thank you Chef John, I will be making this again and again!

Having never made Coq au Vin before, we followed the recipe to the letter. 
I must say that it was simply divine. 
We did make a slightly larger recipe and were able to have enough remaining portions to enjoy the next day  ;-)
Will absolutely make again and it is quite possible that it is going to become one of our favorite "Go To" recipes for when we have guests over for dinner.
Thank you Chef John for this magnificent recipe!

I consulted some favorite French cookbooks and Chef John's recipe definitely remains the easiest to do while being true to the original.  Yes, I will do this one again!  His treatment of the onions and shallots is unique.

I usually love Chef John's recipes and this one was no different. I have always wanted to try coq au vin but thought it would be a complicated recipe but I followed the instructions exactly as written and it came out great.  I must admit I didn't use any mushrooms as I don't like them and I don't think it affected the outcome at all. Even my husband who was totally skeptical about trying this thought it tasted great.  I recommend this recipe.

Fantastic recipe. Followed it to a T except doubled the recipe and did not add mushrooms since nobody in the family likes them. Lots of work, but so worth it to hear ‚ÄúMom that was so good!‚Äù

I've had Coq Au Vin at the semi-fancy French restaurant, and they charged $26.00 for one thigh. This is BETTER. I've made it several times and it seems to work better for me using a Merlot or Zinfandel than with a Cabernet or Pinot Noir. I use wine that's a little above Sutter Home, but less than $10.00 at the discount store.  I use a ten inch skillet and four thighs with the full amount of sauce and serve over mashed potatoes. Steamed asparagus seems to work great as a side.

Yum! Didn‚Äôt have mushrooms, didn‚Äôt miss them. Don‚Äôt know how old the wine I used was, (open refrigerated Cabernet savinion) it have some sediment in the bottle, which I didn‚Äôt notice until after I poured it in the pan. Flavor of this dish was amazing!

Turned out great!! I new it would. Thanks chef John!  Served with white Jasmin rice and sou vide asparagus.  Meal for four, for under 10 bucks. Then you hear people say,‚Äù oh, fresh food is too expensive‚Äù. Then spend 2 to 3 times more on junk food.

This is recipe is simply delicious. I followed the recipe precisely except I used 10 chicken thighs instead of 6. I suggest using a good Bordeaux wine. This is a crowd pleaser. I am already planning to make it again this week.

I think this is the best coq au vin recipe, the original dish is a peasant chicken stew designed to cook roosters, which are otherwise  almost inedible due to their toughness.
  I had to modify the dish as I do not have a dutch oven and my cast iron skillet is too small. I followed the first few steps up until placing the dish into the oven. I believe the original recipe called for cooking the recipe over heat with wine and chicken stock, not putting the dish in the oven. I used skinless boneless chicken thighs  and only cooked them for 30 minutes to avoid overcooking. Because I braised the chicken in a saute pan, I added extra chicken stock to cover the chicken better. After the chicken was cooked, I reduced the liquid for 5 minutes and stirred in a little cornstarch to thicken it. The bacon is a great touch and adds  to the flavor. I do not understand the reviews saying it was "too much work" , it was no more work than any other stew. Like Chef John says in the video, use good wine as you will probably drink some. Part of the fun of making the dish

I've been using this site for years, and only now have I felt compelled to make a username to write a review. I didn't not deviate from the recipe, and it was absolutely phenomenal! The flavor is very rich and delicious and great to sop up with bread after the chicken is gone. I gladly would have paid 40 dollars for this dish at a restaurant.

Wow wow wow, turned out amazing as written.  I used really high quality thicker cut bacon and mini button mushrooms thrown in whole.  Didn't need additional seasoning at the end - the reduced wine and well seasoned chicken, thick bacon did the job.  Served over creamy mashed potatoes.  My sweetheart had two helpings!  This will go into the regular rotation - beautiful comforting dish.

I made this exactly as stated, Chef John... this is a winner, my whole family loved it. The chicken thighs were buttery and melt in your mouth! The flavor profile was as if I had spent big money in a fancy French restaurant.  I cook a lot, my mother was a classically trained chef and she taught me to cook. I do wish she were still here today to try this. Of all the meals I have prepared for my family this has to be my crowning achievement. You are a genius Chef  John.

I tripled the recipe for company and it came out amazing from plating to palate (I had to remove it from the oven as guests were late, covered it in foil and kept in a warm oven for 30 minutes - still  came out perfect). Usually I check the reviews for all the changes y'all make - didn't have time and did it by the book and it was perfect. Served with garlic smashed potatoes and roasted asparagus and red wine. Thanks for the great recipes and videos, Chef John!

This is so easy and incredibly delicious!  I used dried thyme because that's what I had.  I made a little extra sauce also.  Put the sauce on Chef's mashed potatoes. One of the best main dishes I have made from this site.  Huge keeper to my recipe collection.

This is a lot of preparation but if planned ahead, it goes smoothly. I liked it very much. I really am a white meat lover but I decided to go with the thighs as suggested and it was very good. I especially loved the sauce on mashed potatoes so that was my favorite part. My husband didn't say he liked or disliked it but (and I hate to admit this), he pulled out the ketchup. Why would he do this? He loves chicken thighs. Maybe my problem with him is he gets too many good meals. Don't know if I'll make this again if he is going to use ketchup.

I am not a fan of red wine, but..... Made as written and the chicken had an amazing 'deep' flavor. So good. Thanks again to Chef John.

Better than Julia Child's recipe. (Sorry, Julia). The trick is to use a more subtle red wine, such as a Pinot Noir or Beaujolais. I couldn't find whole chicken legs, so I used a combination of thighs and drums.

My husband went out and bought all the ingredient  for this and came home and made this last night for dinner. Except for changing out onion for red pearl it was done just as given and it was excellent. Guess who like's chef John. A real keeper. Thanks John.

This was incredible. Took a more time than I usually spend on a week night dinner, but well worth it. I will definitely make this for company. Served it over mashed potatoes, with fresh green bean & crusty French bread. Definitely a keeper.

I made this for a special dinner for four.   I followed the recipe exactly (followed the video).  I couldn't have been happier with the outcome.   Served it on mashed potatoes  with braised brussel sprouts.   Felt like we were at a restaurant.   Love your videos chef john.

This was a great recipe. It took quite awhile to make but paid off. I only cooked the chicken for two minutes on each side because I used tinier chicken thighs. It also took less time in the oven as well. I couldn't taste the wine but that was to be expected with the reduction. 
The potatoes I made were Scottish style and baked them on a pan afterwards until one side was crispy.

C'est formidable!  Since I learned to speak french in high school (a really long time ago :-), I've always wanted to make coq au vin, and decided to when I found Chef John's recipe.   Yes, it is as good as everyone one is rating it.  I didn't have any shallots, so, I substituted garlic instead. To avoid buying the minced garlic,  I didn't add it until near the end of the caramelization process of the onions and mushrooms.  For wine, I used Chianti, and because Costco had organic chicken drumsticks on sale, I used 5 large drumsticks instead of thighs, and it worked perfectly!  Another tip, I used a grill skillet which gave me more surface area for browning and deglazing.  I served it with homemade mashed potatoes and fresh steam vegetable medley. We really enjoyed it!  Even my husband, who doesn't drink wine, thought it was delicious and cleaned his plate!

I served this to a group of friends and they totally loved it. I pretty much followed the recipe, though I am not a measuring spoon cook, using my own intuition for quantities. The only thing that maybe made a difference was I cooked 12 thighs in my biggest Le Creuset pot which is such a great vessel for braising. I served it with creamy mashed potatoes, roasted butternut squash lightly sprinkled with brown sugar and a delicious bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape.

We loved this recipe and it smelled great cooking. The recipe made plenty of sauce for six thighs...that's a good thing! Will make again and will reduce the amount of salt on chicken, I didn't add any more to the sauce but it was still a little salty. I would also reduce the amount of bacon as it dominated the flavors.

Looks amazing, but I'm hesitant with so much red wine. I've not had much success with red wine, always comes out super bitter, can someone who has tried this let me know, is it bitter or does the chicken broth/stock help? Thanks!

Stunning! My new husband loved it! Like most of our cooks, I tweaked it a little, adding 2 cloves fresh garlic (as we are garlic lovers) and using dried herbs instead of fresh because that's what I had on hand. I did have some fresh basil growing in a window pot, so I chiffonaded some and sprinkled it on top of each serving - Pretty and yummy! This is a very good recipe and is very forgiving if you have to substitute as I did.

Just made this last night for a small dinner with friends. I made 8 thighs instead of 6 and added a little more ingredients to compensate. IT WAS AMAZING!  Everyone loved it. From the first bite to the last, everyone kept making comments. Because we were talking, the chicken actually sat for at least 15 minutes and I was worried it would dry out but it was moist and delicious. Also, we're on a low carb diet and this meal has only 7 net carbs!

Another winner, Chef John. I made this the wife last night along with parmesan basil orzo and some green beans. The skin was crispy and delicious. There was nothing but bone remaining.

amazing! one of my favorite dishes ever,  just like being in France! to save time I did a few things different.. I saut√©ed the mushrooms, shallots and onions with the bacon and a little olive oil all together. then added flour, thyme and butter. then wine. then in a few minutes, I added water instead of broth. simmer for a while. then turn it off. I fried the chicken separately in olive oil, then baked in oven. before serving, I heated up the sauce again on simmer.

Because of dietary issues, I substituted pastrami for the bacon.  I may sound weird but it worked and was quite good. It‚Äôs a keeper but use a half portion of it because salt content is very high.

I pretty much followed the recipe with one exception. When I got home, I realized that I  had bought boneless chicken thighs. I took away about 5 minutes oven time and followed the rest of the instructions. There were smiles and thumbs up around the table. I served mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus  bunches wrapped in bacon. This is definitely a keeper and next time, I will review my purchase closer.

Made this for Valentine's Day dinner with my wife. It was great. I also prepare Chef John's Mashed potatoes and served it with a small green(heart of Romain) salad. The dinner was great. Thanks Chef John

We liked this recipe, I followed it as printed, but there was not enough sauce for our taste. Maybe I was too generous with the flour. The leftovers I reheated in wine gravy and that was delicious. I will try this again with more liquid.

So this recipe has been around for a while and I like all Chef John's recipes I've tried except the chicken Parm casserole.  But that was the only one.  My husband has been working some long hard hours and I wanted to make something special.  My husband thought it spectacular.  He said, "Please save this one."  I have a habit of trying different things.  My six year old grandson said to me, "Grammy can you make this more."  It's a straightforward recipe.  I wish I could find a way to brown chicken thighs without the oil spitting on my arms.  I did try drying them off first.  I will definitely make these again due to to positive response.  Oh and I did serve over mashed potatoes and made a simple arugula salad as Chef John recommended.

This was by far the best thing I've ever cooked.  Well maybe among the top 3 best things I've cooked.  It had sooo many levels of flavor to it.

I was a bit unsure because I'm not a wine drinker so didn't know what was "good."  I settled on a bottle of Pinot Noir for $10.00.  In fact, as wines go for me, it was also rather tasty and I helped myself to a good portion of it while cooking.

That's not the point. haha...anyway, I'm glad I cooked up 8 chicken thighs instead of 6 so no I've a very tasty lunch item tomorrow.

Thank YOU Chef John!

We have made this recipe countless times over the years, never varying from Chef John's recipe as written and it has never failed.  The chicken is just so tender and flavorful and the sauce is rich and delicious. I highly recommend sticking to chicken thighs even if you don't typically like them! We usually serve this over mashed potatoes with a side of green beans.

It was quite good. Didn‚Äôt have any bacon so I used turkey sausage and I think that impacted the flavor. Will try it again with bacon.

Awesome recipe chef John! we paired the chicken with parmigiano butter on spaghetti squash with seasoned salt. the final product needed no additional spices as we used only onion and no shallots.

This was absolutely delicious. The chicken was so moist, tender, and flavorful. I served it with white rice, and broccoli. Guests raved. Will indeed make again.  BTW, I followed the recipe, no changes.

I made this for the first time for a small dinner party I was having. It was beyond delicious and a huge hit with everyone there. By necessity I had to make two changes and they were to used dried Thyme (didn't have fresh) and 2 cloves of minced garlic since my local grocery didn't have shallots. I love garlic, so this was a great addition anyway. Beyond that I chose not to place the pan in the oven at the end to finish cooking. Instead I simply covered the pan and simmered on top of the stove for about 20 minutes until the chicken was cooked through. So these were relatively minor changes to this fantastic recipe. This dish is simply delicious and full of complex flavors but oh so easy to make!

It was sooooooo good! I don't eat pork, so I used chicken sausage instead of bacon. I also used garlic instead of shallots, honestly just because I had them and didn't feel like going to the store.  The recipe was easy, and the video is funny. I will definitely make this again.

Hubs and I made this disk to the letter except I only had 4 thighs not 6.  I reduced the sauce on the last part a bit more cause my husband likes the gravy thicker.  All we can say is WOOOOW.  This dish is amazing.  I had all the ingredients at the house so it was a cheap dish to make.  This will for sure be made monthly.  THANKS AGAIN CHEF JOHN!  I plan to make many more of your recipes.

A delicious dish that makes you feel like you are truly a chef. The sauce is indulgent and complex and I recommend perhaps making a lot more of it than the recipe calls for. If you are using cast iron, look at the bacon doneness and not the clock so you don‚Äôt overcook the bacon like I did the first time.

What a wonderful recipe. I used cipollini onions, left them whole and added twice a many mushrooms in Big chunks. Absolutely wonderful dish. Be patient at last step, reduce until thick.. May take 10-15 mins, stir continuously when sauce starts to thicken.  Serve with mashed potatoes and broccoli florets, or caramelized Brussels sprouts. What a wonderful dish!!

holy  this was great. super moist yet falls off the bone and has INCREDIBLE flavor. I love dishes where the flavor just punches you in the face and this had that. very balanced flavor yet bold and delicious. I used sangria for the wine cause that's what I had on hand. I would probably opt for more of a dry one next time but wow so good

Great recipe except the chicken needs to marinate in the wine for several hours. Preferably overnight. The chicken doesn‚Äôt have the depth of flavor when it isn‚Äôt marinated.

Made exactly to the recipe.  It took a  bit longer than expected to get it into the oven even though I had prepped and pre-measured the ingredients before starting up the stove.   I felt the chicken was a bit dry, perhaps bc I used a cast iron skillet?   I think the quality of the sauce depends on the quality of the wine used, I used a nice Pinot Noir.  DH loved it,   I thought it was just a tad plain.  Yes, I would make it again.

GR8 recipe that I just did something different with yesterday. My wife and I only eat half of a Rotisserie chicken from our local Sam's club and so I thought since we usually only do a half recipe (3 servings) of this Chef John's recipe, why not try the left over Rotisserie chicken. Obviously it really only needed to be warmed up but I still gave it some additional browning in the skillet as Chef John does-Excellent! So now we have two ways to make this GR8 recipe and with the leftover Rotisserie chicken it only takes half as long to make.

This was absolutely delicious-- I omitted a major ingredient because my husband hates mushrooms, and I added large chunks of carrot before putting it in the oven. Also, I didn't reduce the sauce at the end because there was the perfect amount of sauce. Everyone LOVED it. I doubled the recipe and used boneless thighs and breasts-- about 3 lbs. worth. So good!

This is, hands down, the best recipe I cook. 
This time around I cooked it in a cast iron. So amazing!

I have an old, stained, dog eared, much loved old French cookbook all with braising recipes.  It also has a recipe almost identical to this recipe, I've used it dozens (many dozen times) mainly because it is the only "chicken" recipe mostly because braising usually doesn't involve chicken, the only part of the chicken that can be successfully prepared is thighs and legs and because for so many years thighs & legs have been considered the "cheap dish"....right!  Americans haven't always appreciated these parts of the chicken, leaning more towards the typical "boneless, skinless, breasts" (what could be more bland?) which doesn't braise well at all.  Braise a chicken breast and all you get is mush.  Prepare this dish as chef John suggests and you will have flavor galore on a winters evening,
your kitchen will always smell inviting, and the warmth from your oven will always contribute to the overall comfort of your home.  Saying this, I never braise anything in the summer months, I live in Maine where I grill and BBQ but never bake or roast in the summer.  Sure braising takes a step or two more for ultimate flavor output, but you should care about what you and your family sit down to, make it about flavor to accompany your conversation and enjoyment of a time that makes life all worthwhile....perhaps even fix a dessert now and then!

I have made this a few times over the years and it tastes amazing and is easy to make! It has a few steps and they take a little time, but to me, food is worth effort. I made this tonight for the man, no changes but to scale down to four chicken thighs because he is the only meat-eater.  Served over hand mashed garlic-potatoes and fresh green beans with a lovely spinach  salad....WOW!

The wine sauce tastes fantastic.  Followed recipe as written except for using thick cut bacon and crimini mushrooms.  This involves quite a few steps, but none of those are difficult.  My wife just loves the sauce and, as Chef John says, you can just make the sauce without the chicken.

Really delicious! I don‚Äôt drink, so I never have wine in the house, but I substituted pomegranate juice with some red wine vinegar to add acidity. It tasted amazing, but did make the sauce look very dark, which was sort of unappealing. Overall, I think it was definitely worth the time and effort, and I will most likely make it again.

Simply loved this! Like other reviewers, I wish we‚Äôd had more sauce for leftovers. I made mashed potatoes as a side and smothered them with this sauce as well. I really appreciated having to video for reference. The bacon I chose made it a bit salty well that and I accidentally added more than a pinch to the veggies. I will make it again and have forwarded it to friends and family... whether it be dessert or a wonderful meal, Chef John never lets us down.

Every dinner guest who has had this delicious dish, absolutely raves about it.  Paired with a hearty Hybrid Petite Sirah from Lodi or spicy Old Vine Zinfandel, decadent roasted garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus..... mmmm!

I read many of the reviews that raved about this recipe so I was very excited to make it. It did not disappoint! I felt that It  was not as difficult to prepare as some made it out to be. 

The chicken was tender and succulent. The wine reduction was incredible...this will be one of my go to recipes.

Omg! I've wanted to make coq au vin for years, but for whatever reason havent...until today. All I can tell you is MAKE this recipe!! It is utterly delicious . I made with BA's "perfectly roasted potatoes" (sorry Allrecipes) which I've been making for months now. Other coq au vin recipes call for cognac, of which I am NOT a fan, so maybe that's what had me hesitate.  And thighs--not my fave, but I will eat them. Chef John is spot on about not substituting breasts--don't do it, I can see why--not enough fat to provide the flavor. This will be added to my "go-to's" for dinner for company, for me and my hub when I feel like spending extra time on dinner...or when I just feel like "cooking"..which is often. Followed recipe exactly except skillet part, only because I thought my largest skillet couldn't accommodate the volume of ingredients, so I used my cast iron enameled Dutch oven, which appears to have worked just as well ( but I didnt use the lid when inserted into oven). Will make again and again and likely, soon again. And I too, wish I had leftovers!!

Excellent recipe, super simple. Used 8 thigh family pack and just doubled everything else so we would have plenty of sauce.

Interesting to make, not a fan of the taste. I'm not big into wine to begin with, and it completely overpowered the ingredients. The only thing that tasted OK and not like red was the bacon.  I definitely did not like the flavor of this and neither did my husband.

Wow, this was SICK! Thank you chef John for this scrumptious recipe. Everyone was very impressed and locked their spoons. We had it with rice but I imagine it would be just as yummy with mashed potatoes. Forgot to take a picture unfortunately but I will be making this again for sure and take one then. ????

So delicious we are having the leftover sauce on steaks tonight! I cooked it all on the stove, not the oven, and used a meat thermometer to determine when it was done. Only took 30 minutes after I added the chicken.

Great flavor.  It's a lot easier than the traditional recipe I've tried in the past, but the results are just as good.  For example, i didn't have to flame the brandy, sweat the chicken, or  cook pearl onions in a separate step.  I used 6 large chicken thighs and baby bell mushrooms.  I skimmed off a lot of the fat from the sauce as well.   I also appreciated the video he provided and basically followed his advice to a t.

Absolutely marvelous--restaurant quality!  The only thing I changed was to add 2 more chicken thighs to accommodate some hungry men--the recipe itself was left alone.  I made the mistake of trying to get this to the table on a weeknight and it was finally served at 8:00 pm--LOL! --husband had to eat a snack before dinner.  I will either have to start earlier or make it on the weekend.  I agree with some other reviewers that it does NOT need salt added before serving.  The color presentation was rather blase' and overall just kind of brown throughout but the flavor is irresistible!  Some Coq au Vin recipes use carrots in them.  I served carrots that had been roasted in chopped left-over thyme , olive oil, and kosher salt & pepper.  The flavor went well with the chicken and added some color to the plate.  Will absolutely repeat this recipe.

I used 10 bone-in, skin-on thighs and loosely doubled the sauce ingredients, using a mid-range burgundy wine. My family and I absolutely loved it.  My family liked the sauce so much, they were drinking it like soup, and one of them didn‚Äôt even like mushrooms until today. I‚Äôd make it again on a weekend in a heartbeat. Served with green beans, baguettes, and roasted potatoes. Also like the idea of serving with mashed potatoes on a day with extra time.

Made it with skinless boneless thighs because they were on sale. It was AMAZING!  The wine reduction with mixture was incredible and the meat was so tender just cooking in the over with it.  Served over mashed potatoes with corn as a side. Really nice.

I didn't make it as written so I can't give it 5 stars. It is, however, a very good recipe. I couldn't find the recipe my family likes and I remembered very little so I knew I could trust Chef John's version as a guideline. The things I did different: I made it gluten-free by using corn starch, added carrots (my family likes it that way) and more mushrooms and more bacon and I halved the thyme. We served it the only civilized way: on mashed potatoes.

Very good! I'll have to dial the salt back a little as I was pretty heavy handed with it. I used rabbit hindquarters instead of chicken thighs and they came out just perfect.

Delicious! We followed the recipe exactly and loved it. My only suggestion would be to pour the sauce around the side at the very end (on the platter) so you don‚Äôt lose the crispy chicken skin. Definitely a keeper of a recipe!

Made it to the recipe, except I had boneless chicken thighs, so I  cooked for just 30 minutes in the oven. Still tasted great

Will make it again, only with bone in thighs.

Excellent flavor. I added a sprig of rosemary instead of thyme. I used only 1 cup of wine but increased the chicken broth. I would definitely make this again. This would make a great dish to serve guests as you can make it ahead of time.

Absolutely delicious! Rich and earthy flavors! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because I had them on hand. Will make again for company! Thanks!

I served this for a dinner party last night and it was lovely.  I actually cooked the dish in the morning and reheated when guests arrived so no last minute chaos.

I really enjoy Chef John's voice and attitude! Sounds just like Seth Rogen! Lol. Recipe is easy to follow and ingredients not difficult to find. I saw this dish mentioned twice on two different tv shows so I just had to find out what the big deal was! Im not a very good cook, but I definitely felt fancy making this dish! I'm not into wine or cooking with wine so I didn't like the flavor (but that's just my preference). Although it was pretty simply to follow, it was indeed a lot of time and work for the resulting dish. It turned out the way it was supposed to, just wasn't my type of flavour. We ate it all, but just not something we would make often or write home about.

Made this tonight with boneless skinless thighs. The only changes I made were using dried thyme (about 2 teaspoons) and in the cooking time ‚Äî thighs were cooked and tender after 40 minutes.  Easy to make, great directions and absolutely delicious!

A little greasy, a little salty, but good.  Next time less bacon grease to cook the chicken, no salt in the onion mixture.  Definitely serve with mashed potatoes.

Wonderful!  My husband loved it.  I've tried other Coq Au Vin recipe's, but they always ask for chicken breasts.  This is so much better.  Chef John really knows his stuff.

I love this recipe! I had all the ingredients on hand to make this classic dish which enhanced my enthusiasm to make it. Yes it is time consuming however it‚Äôs worth it. The only change I made was the use of frozen mushrooms and the combo of spring onions and garlic cloves in place of the shallots. Trust me, everyone will love this tried and true famous dish!

I sure don't understand the review by the person who thought this was too much work.   Maybe she made it with skinless breasts which would have not been worth the effort. Its pretty easy to make and is one of the best recipes I have made in a long time.  

In the first place the step of frying up the bacon is not work.  I love to do that.

I used half again as many mushrooms as recommended just because I had them and was not planning other dishes that would use them. 
I used cheap Gallo Chianti for the wine and that served very well. 
'
I cut the recipe in half and it turned out very well. 

Chef John's suggestion to use bone in/skin on thighs is  very good.  These thighs tasted so good that it caused me to  wonder if some my other recipes, that I have been using boneless thighs for, might be better if I used the bone in variety.

Im adding to the review after a couple of months.  I have made this several times and its always good.   I usually serve it with egg noodles but sometimes mashed potatoes.  One time I did not have fresh mushrooms and had a lot of Costco canned mushrooms that I used instead.  That batch was not nearly as good.  The Costco canned mushrooms are very good in a lot of recipes but for this one you really need the fresh mushrooms cooked in the bacon fat.

I couldn't find the recipe I had used before, so I tried this one.
It tasted good, but it wasn't the best coq au vin I had made before.  I like a simpler approach to making it just in one pot, and without using the oven.  However, this tasted still pretty good.

Typical Chef John magic!   

I used boneless thighs from Cost**, pulled them out as they browned, diced them into less than bitesize pieces.  This let me bypass the oven step.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I didn't have shallots so I used green onion, and I didn't have fresh thyme so I used dried. It was very,  good, but a little bland for my taste as I love spices. Perhaps fresh thyme would have made a difference. The chicken tasted wonderful, though. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes per suggestions of others. Chef John's recipes never disappoint.

I will make this again and again. It was delicious.  I love Chef John. He is so funny and he doesn‚Äôt censor his faux pas. That helps us to learn and makes the cooking even more fun!  I made the recipe just the way he said, except I used the pearl onions he mentioned. I put in about 20, peeled and whole. It was wonderful and fancy and was the best thing I‚Äôve made from all Chef John‚Äôs recipes.

I marinate the chicken for about an hour prior, and I use a bit of oregano and basil in place of thyme.  I serve it with Chipotle mashed potatoes and for dessert, I use the phyllo pastry cups with cherry pie filling and a light dusting of powdered sugar.

This is a keeper! Follow the recipe to a T and you shouldn't have a problem. Word to the wise, DO NOT USE boneless chicken breasts. Bone-in and skin-on is the only way to go. I used four (very inexpensive) hindquarters and the meat just melted off the bone. Also, don't skip the browning on screaming high heat! And make sure that bacon is crispy, not flabby. I will use this recipe again and again. Thanks, Chef John!

Excellent I have made several times and the only changes were to add a little more flour and I never place in the oven I just finish by cooking in electric skillet until cooked thru.  Thank you Chef John a winner!

This recipe is amazeballs. The only change I make is to use diced shallot in place of pearl onions (I‚Äôm not a fan). This is my husband‚Äôs favorite dish I make. His eyes light up whenever I talk about making it.

Made this tonight and followed the recipe exactly.  It made for a good dinner but the chicken thighs weren‚Äôt that tender, and, as my husband said, the sauce was a bit flat. Will finish the leftovers but probably won‚Äôt be making again. Glad we tried it though because I‚Äôd been saving the recipe for a long time.

I cooked it through step 7 the day before to reduce effort on the day I wanted to serve the dish, stored it in the fridge and then baked it on the day needed. Actually worked better than straight prep as sauce components had more time to integrate.

Really tasty.  I added more mushrooms and I used a couple of boneless, skinless thighs and boneless, skinless breasts because that's all I had.  The meat was fork-tender and delicious and the gravy, mushrooms, and onions were pure heaven over mashed potatoes.  I used a bottle of Bogle old vine essential red ($10) and it was perfect for this dish.  Just make sure you follow the directions and reduce the wine before it goes into the oven.  Another great recipe from Chef John.

I followed the recipe as written, but increased the amounts since I was making this for a larger crowd.  I also used both skin and skinless thighs and the outcome for both was the same.  Because I had so many thighs I put them into a large casserole dish and baked them for the suggested time.  It turned out perfect and everyone was raving on the taste.  I also accompanied the meal with mashed potatoes, maple glazed carrots and home made artesian bread.  This meal is a keeper!!

This was good. Very tasty. Would have been nice to have a cooking dish that could go in the oven and stove top so a little bit more work but was very tasty.

I use boneless skinless thighs. BIG hit, even with my daughter who doesn't like wine. I had to make my Mushrooms on the side. Not everyone digs them.

This coq au vin recipe was a home run! We love Chef John's recipes and videos so we weren't too surprised. We followed the recipe to a T, only adding pearl onions because we had them on hand. Wonderful served with potatoes au gratin and a nice green salad. Our dinner guests were blown away!

The only only deviatation I made was that I used a cast iron dutch oven instead of a skillet or saute pan as shown in the video.  I covered the dutch oven and baked it for 30 minutes, then basted the chicken and baked it an additional 30 minutes uncovered.

It was awesome!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was totally delish! I had a friend over as well. You know, those guinea pig friends that become your taste testers. My husband loved it as well. I didn't change a thing. I even managed to forget the handle was hot from the oven and burned my fingers a bit. It was worth it. I will be making this again!

The is hands down one of the best dishes I've made. Change nothing except subbed dried thyme for the fresh, only because it was handy. The sauce is sublime! Simple, outstanding comfort food! Thanks chef John!

This is delicious!  I make this every time I get thighs on sale. The first few times I didn't have fresh thyme or shallots so instead I used 1/4 tsp. ground thyme and 1 tsp. minced garlic. I have been adding 1/4 inch sliced fresh carrots to the caramelizing step. I have been using Baby Bella mushrooms and  Cavit Pinot Noir.  It always comes out great!

I did not have all the ingredients, so substituted:
Dried thyme for fresh
Dried chives for fresh shallots
canned mushrooms for fresh
Bouillon for chicken broth

And it came out fantastic!  Served on a bed of egg noodles with a side of green beans with a dash of minced onion and bacon bits in them.

I will make this one again!!

This is one of my favorite dishes as my mother had perfected this and it was a staple in our dinner line-up as I was growing up.  I include both the  thighs and some chicken breasts for those  who prefer the  breast meat but like the chef says, you need to have the thighs for the flavor and consistency.  I purposely make a double batch when I cook this because it is not only loved by everyone but it's even better the second day.  You must accompany this dish with a  fresh loaf of Italian bread so that you soak up every last drop of  this great  sauce..

I loved this recipe. Made it tonight for dinner and it was delish! I was over my boyfriends house making this and his oven did not work, so I just simmered the chicken in wine for 25 minutes covered on stovetop. Thank you chef john! I love your recipes!

My husband is the hardest critic to please. Usually he says that was good or ok. This time he was making yummy noises and had seconds and thirds!

Made it as written, with the exception of a little less bacon, only because that's what I had on hand.  I used 4 large thigh pieces, also because that's what I had.  It was DELICIOUS!   Served with roasted red potatoes and stir fried asparagus and mushrooms (whatever was left after I put the mushrooms in the cog au vin).   Will definitely make it again.

The sauce was delicious! I found that my meat came to temperature in half the time the recipe suggested, so only 30 minutes in the oven was needed for me.

This is so tasty! It takes a bit of prep, but it's simple and anyone could accomplish it. I make the recipe as it without changes.

Well I made this and its is great. I followed the recipe and although my sauce was a little thicker and when I checked the temperature it was a little over cooked but the thighs still juicy and tender. This meal will make someone think you are a chef.

I didn't quite follow the recipe, as the chicken thighs I had were both skinless and boneless. I also added some chopped garlic cloves and used the whole onion with the shallots. I didn't get a lot of fat rendered from the bacon or the chicken so added some olive oil for the the garlic/onion/shallots. Rather than chicken broth, I used a double strength chicken stock (so more or less the same). It didn't need the whole 60 minutes in the oven and I removed after about 45. Ultimately it is very, very tasty. I can only think that those saying otherwise either failed to reduce the sauce sufficiently or used fatty cuts to get too much fat and failed to remove the excess. I'll be doing this one again for sure.

AMAZING!!!!  I followed the recipe with one exception: I used Boneless thighs- just because I hate dealing with bones.  It was terrific!!!  I only had to bake it for about 20 minutes until it was done, instead of the hour it has to bake with the bone in chicken.  And the sauce is truly wonderful!

While this was not the rich intense flavor party in my mouth I was expecting, it is still worthy of five stars. I baked my chicken to beyond 180 degrees and it was still moist and tender. The skin had a slight crisp although I wish I could have gotten it a bit more crispy. The sauce reduced in minutes afterwards to a nice glaze with only stirring and had a good chicken flavor that went very well with smashed potatoes. I went with a veggie that was acidic thinking it would be needed to cut the richness here but it was unnecessary so go with whatever green you would like. This recipe has a homestyle comfort food feel and definitely inspired me to explore other braising recipes. Good one Chef John!

I love to cook as you all do as well. We had just gotten back from France and I was looking at French recipes. I came across this one and my wife said we never had that. So I had some fun to be had on a Sunday. Wow!! This was amazing. The kids loved it too. Nothing to change. Just be hungry. Great recipe!!

This recipe is fabulous just as it is.  I did a few things that others might consider .  First, I marinated the chicken thighs in the red wine for 2 hours before cooking and then used the wine  in the recipe.  You could do this the night before and it would probably be even better. Second, I made sure the chicken thighs were very dry before browning. I then made the recipe as  written up to the last step.  Third, I put the coq au vin in the refrigerator overnight and reheated it in a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes before reducing the liquid.  Finally, I sauteed pearl onions (4 per person) in a Tbs. of butter and 2 tbs of vegetable oil in a covered large frying pan on low for about 15 minutes.  Shake the pan every minute or so to move the onions.  I pushed the onions to one side, turned the heat up to medium high and added button mushrooms that had been quartered (4 per person) They browned nicely in about 5 minutes.  I then added the onions and mushrooms to the reducing liquid for a minute or two before serving.  The onions just melt in your mouth and the mushrooms are wonderful.  I served the coq au vin with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed garlic spinach.

This turned out perfect! I followed the recipe exactly with the only exception being the thyme, I used dry because that was what I had on hand. For a red I used a Merlot. Oh my gosh, the flavor! I served with mashed potatoe,s since many of the reviewers recommended it, and garlic green beans. SO worth the effort!

That was alot of work and in the end, I don't even really want to finish eating it.

I don't know if I used the wrong kind of bacon or cheap wine or what. It tastes too greasy, and like salt from the bacon and chicken broth sat out in a cup.

Pretty yucky. I guess some mash potatoes would hide the undesirable flavor.

For two people who don't like red wine, this was a great dish. I made it with garlic mash and fresh beans and it turned a basic chicken maryland cut into something special. Thank you for sharing, I will definitely make again

Made as it is printed but used 6 thighs and 4 leg sections.  Also added more mushrooms (smaller and halved) whole onion and an additional shallot.  Delicious.

I made this exactly as Chef John did in his video, and it was delicious. I usually don't eat thighs, but these were superb with the bacon, onion gravy.  It was a little salty so I just added more rice to my plate!  I will try the garlic mashed potatoes next time. Thanks, Chef John, for your videos and the little tips you give. I guess an excellent chef like you can't imagine an older, retired person like me not knowing these little tidbits that make a recipe excellent instead of mediocre.

Few modifications:  I only used 4 chicken thighs, added carrots, garlic, and 1-2 tbs. tomato paste.  Fry bacon until golden brown.  Saute chicken in bacon grease until both sides are brown (about 10 minutes total).  Add onions to bacon grease and until golden brown.  Add carrots.  Cook for about 5-8 minutes.  Add mushrooms until tender and close to brown in color.  Add garlic.  Cook for about 1 min.  Add 1.25 cups of Pinot Noir.  Reduce by 1/3 to 1/2.  Add about 1tbs of tomato paste.  Allow to thicken.  Add 1.25 cups chicken stock.  Cook for about 5 minutes.  Add bacon and chicken.  Cook in oven for about 45-50 minutes.  Remove chicken from pan.  Mix 1tbs butter and 1 tbs cornstarch together.  Add mixture to pan, allow to simmer and thicken.

I left out the shallots because I didn't have any.  Came out great.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it.  Served with some egg noodles.

I loved everything about this recipe. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs by accident and maybe I'll stick with that because I didn't have to trim any fat. I don't really prefer thighs so boneless was best for my preference. Only problem, which was my mistake, I used cooking wine instead of red wine and think it made things a bit salty. Besides that, i loved it!

Fantastic recipe! Because of the amount of work involved, I made a double recipe. Instead of six thighs I used fourteen and doubled the other ingredients. I am so happy I did.  We ate half of it tonight and I'm thrilled we will be able to warm it up and enjoy again.

I used skinless boneless thighs because that is what I had in freezer.  Don't think it would have turned out any better with bone-in but ??? Also didn't have fresh mushrooms.  A little expensive using 1 1/2 cups wine and fairly time consuming but both my husband and myself enjoyed. The sauce is so good, think would be good over rice or mashed potatoes?

This is an exceptionally good recipe... not difficult to make and delicious. I followed the recipe as written and paid close  attention to the video...  For some reason my sauce was thicker than I wanted so next time I will look to add or subtract to end up with a thinner sauce.. I think I will just use less flour than called for in the recipe... The flavor profile of this dish is excellent

Wonderful dish!  I had Coq au vin in France a few months ago. This recipe by Chef John is every bit as good as that was. I made no changes, followed the recipe exactly. I only wish that there was more!  I will definitely be making this again.

This was delicious!  It is a very involved recipe and I'd save it for weekends or nights you have a lot of time, but it was well worth the effort.  The flavor was amazing and rich.  Everyone loved it, even the kids.

Amazing dish and fun to make! So very yummy! Was going to do boneless breasts in order to avoid bones - glad I stuck to thighs - the meat just fell off the bones - no mess. Sooo good!

Great recipe. I tripled the recipe for a large dinner party. It was a hit. Leftovers were just as good the following day. I added twice the shallots and half the broth.

This was awesome. I've made coq au vin before but it never came out with the depth of flavor of this recipe.  
Mine didn't come out greasy at all. 
It takes a while to make but it's not difficult. It would be a good Sunday dinner. 
I used Rabbit Ridge Zinfandel for the wine and it came out tasty and bright. 
Taste before adding salt at the end, the bacon can add a lot of salt. 
I served ours over mashed potatoes with lots of the sauce. YUM!

Absolutely delicious.  Followed the exactly.  The sauce was wonderful,  the chicken melts in your mouth.  If you follow the recipe you won't go wrong.  I prepared it and waited to put in the oven.

I only use boneless chicken breasts, do not like the idea of the bones popping up while eating. Also,  I add 1 Tbsp. tomato paste and use much more dry red wine

Delicious! I followed the recipe but substituted and used turkey bacon as well as boneless chicken drumsticks. Also since I didn't have an oven safe dish I just left it on the stove top and flipped the chicken every so often and let it simmer until the sauce reduced. The sauce reduced a bit too much though in only 20 mins. Next time I will add another 1/2 c of wine and maybe another 1/4 cup of chicken broth so I would have more sauce.

Ok the flavor is wonderful but I found the sauce way to thin, I thought it was suppose to be thick like a stew. Maybe next time I would fry the chicken place on the side, do the sauce & place the chicken back into the sauce & place it in a crock pot & thicken it up by adding the pasta water and half the chicken broth or maybe delete the broth all together. My boyfriend is from France & told me it suppose to be a stew thus the title of the dish. Needs a little twicking but altogether good.

excellent. Already had a bit of bacon grease in my cast iron from morning breakfast so did not add the bacon. It was perfect. Tip: use good wine and make sure you use fresh thyme.

I made it for a small dinner party and it was delicious - one guest said it was the best chicken he ever had.  I had 12 thighs so had to gauge the amount of added ingredients so when I make again will follow the recipe exactly with 6 thighs to judge how my calculations were.

Did almost everything the same except I put it in the slow cooker. It was a fairly warm day and I did not want the over one.  So I cut back on the amount of liquids called for in the recipe.

The amounts are right on the mark, which is what matters most in a recipe. The only things I varied was that I removed the skin before cooking,  cooked the chicken longer in the bacon fat and finished it off in the sauce. I didn't use the oven at all. I think this serves to "melt off" more of the chicken fat and makes for a really moist piece of meat. Good recipe.

I trusted Chef John with using thighs ( we are usually white meat people) and it was awesome!  As usual, his recipe was super flavorful  and worth every ounce of effort. I will make this again and even to impress my epicurean parents!

Very delicious and (as many others have mentioned) savory. I cooked it all on the stovetop and simmered it for an hour, once all the ingredients were brought together. I'm always looking for 1 pot dishes, and this one is a keeper. 

Thanks Chef John

FYI, I also added 3 cloves of garlic (I'm a garlic junkie) and a diced red pepper.

Absolutely fantastic!  My family makes Chicken Cacciatore with white wine instead of tomato sauce.  This Coq Au Vin recipe is France's answer to my family's Chicken Cacciatore.  The chicken is "fall off the bone" great!  Flavor is out of this world.  The only "con" I would give it is the amount of salt.  I like salt but in moderation.  I still give the recipe a five star because it deserves it!  Thank you Chef John.  Recipe well done!

I used 2 whole chickens cut into halves and seared off one at a time in a cast iron skillet  I added carrots and shallots to the  mirepoix along with the  mushrooms (shiitake, baby bells, and oyster)    everyone loved the tenderness of the chick while staying juicy.

Yum, I followed the recipe to a tee however I  wish when they called for "red wine", they would explain  for us non-wine drinkers which works best. I used a cheap $4.95 California  Cabernet Sauvignon.

This is an very tasty recipe that is easy to make.   I used chicken legs and thighs.  I did not have fresh thyme so I used dried and I did not use shallots.  Served it to company the first time I made it and they loved it too.

Can someone please share your knowledge with this beginner. I hope this is the correct place to post this recipe question. After reading all the great reviews , I want to attempt this recipe...for 8 people!  The recipe as written is for 6.  Is one thigh/person really enough? If I just add 2 thighs I would think you don't need to increase all the other ingredients, correct?  But if I did want to double the recipe and have 12 thighs, would I do this in 2 skillets since the ingredients would then call for 3 cups wine and 2 cups broth?  Thanks in advance for any help.

Easy 5 stars. I didn't enjoy the oil snow fall in my kitchen from pan frying the chicken on high, ouch! I couldn't handle it so I fried the chicken on medium heat for 10 min on each side instead. Maybe I had this problem because I used chicken leg quarters instead of thighs?

This is fab just as written. I did use boneless, skinless thighs and added some paprika. Used a whole can of low sodium chicken broth and increased the flour to 1 1/2  tblsp. for more sauce. No leftovers :/

Loved, loved, loved! The sauce transforms into a deep, rich, brown by the time it's done cooking and the chicken is fall of the bone tender. Made it with egg noodles which sopped up the sauce nicely. I used Carnivore Cab as the wine (I'm writing this because I know I will forget next time I go to make this).

Wow!  The is an awesome recipe!  I used used skinless thighs and legs. There was no need to skim any excess fat off the pan juices because there wasn't any.  I used Marcella cooking wine since that is what I had on hand. Since I used cooking wine there was no need to salt the pan juices. My mother, husband and I loved it!  Will most definitely make it again!  Thanks Chef John!

Totally awesome! The juices from the pan are the kind you just love to dip bread in - I substituted Rosemary for Thyme as this sounded very much like the Bocce Club Chicken we used to enjoy at the old Bocce Club in Overbrook...great recipe!

I made the recipe to the tee with the exception that I used 2 pkgs. of baby portobello mushrooms.  It turned out exquisite.  My whole family was impressed.  It was delicious.  A sure repeat.  Its not too hard but I could see why each step in the recipe was critical.

Made this last week and took it to work. We loved it! Asked my coworker what I should make with the leftover ingredients and she suggested just making it again so I made it a second time. It's time consuming and requires a bit of attention but it wasn't difficult. I'm a huge fan of Chef John's recipes. Directions are easy to follow and the food is delicious!

This recipe is a lot of work, but absolutely 100% worth every second you put into it. Everyone, even the picky eaters, loved this. There were no leftovers (but, I wish there had been). I thought that the recipe was easy to follow and perfectly balanced. It was the first time I had ever had Coq Au Vin - and I will absolutely have it again, whether or not I make it myself, because this recipe made me a fan of the dish.

Made this exactly as instructed (just without mushrooms, due to son's allergy). This. Was. Divine! It's only been four days ago that I made it, and everyone is asking for it again. I'll make it again tonight. Thank you! Best Coq Au Vin recipe ever!!

This is an awesome recipe that my family of picky eaters loves. I usually make the recipe as written, but last night I made a couple of substitutions. I seldom have shallots or fresh thyme on hand so I substituted about 1/2 teaspoon shallot powder & a teaspoon of dried thyme, and it it still tasted amazing served over mashed potatoes.

Liked this recipe.  I added a bit more red wine and chicken broth to give enough of the sauce.  o also added in some shelled edemame beans for a veggie add.

Really superb dish for a cold Wisconsin winter night.

I made it and we loved it, but I will admit I did make some adjustments.  I am not sure how much my adjustments contributed to the taste, but just so my rating is fair, let me share.
I sauted the onions and mushrooms in fried bacon drippings and added some garlic.  After it all slightly browned I removed and set aside with chopped bacon. I then added flour dredged chicken (used thighs and legs) and a little bit of peanut oil. I seasoned my flour with salt, pepper, and a generous amount of smoked paprika. After lightly browning my chicken, I removed it and then added lots of red wine (LOL) to pan drippings and some chicken stock instead of water. After the sauce bubbled I added it to chicken, and onion mix and added to a dutch oven pot with some fresh thyme and rosemary . I put it all in oven on 275 for 1.5 hours.

Yummy!!! We loved it.

I've made this twice. Make sure you use fresh thyme. Turn on some Edith Piaf and serve with crusty French bread - you'll think you are in a cozy French bistro!

I mostly followed the instructions.  I also took the advice of another reviewer who said they wished they had doubled the recipe.  The only changes were that I used 8 chicken thighs and doubled everything else.  I had lots of delicious gravy, which was my intent and I used Marsala for my wine.  This dish was very delicious.  I would definitely make it again.  Thank you for sharing it.

I made this as written, even picked up some shallots. I've made it with leg quarters, thighs, and with boneless skinless breasts for my wife. It is great with each type of chicken, planning on making it tomorrow with a whole, cut up chicken.

This was awesome! I did add 1 tbsp of ketchup to mellow the colour and I found the need to make a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce before serving. I stirred the slurry into the dish about 10 minutes before serving and it thickened the sauce beautifully. Next time, I will reduce the sauce more before baking.  We used the extra sauce over potatoes and ham the next night- also delicious. Thank you for a great recipe!

I prepped up until the point you put it in the oven.  I also had to switch everything into a baking dish because my skillet wasn't but enough.  Turned out great!Fianc√© loved it and his friend said it was "the bomb.com"  Served with mashed potatoes.  The guys went back for seconds.

This was amazing. The sauce was so delicious. I had never made Coq au Vin before but I will definitely be making it this way again. The package of chicken thighs I bought had 8 thighs in them, so I ended up increasing all the ingredients by a little bit. I like to eyeball everything rather than measure it out. It still turned out fantastic. Thank you, Chef John, for making fine cuisine so easy to do!

I don't like mushrooms so I followed the recipe exactly except omitting the mushrooms and the sauce was amazing and the chicken came out so tender and juicy. I will definitely be making this again!

I used dried thyme instead of fresh (unfortunately) and served over egg noodles. I definitely think it has potential, but was a little too rich for me, despite skimming off the fat. I think next time I will use skinless chicken thighs and half the butter and see how it turns out. Still good though as is.

I made it exactly as the receipe called for and served it with mashed potatoes. My husband loved it and I was very pleased!!  next time I will try it will noodles and maybe a little more sauce and onions, as I am a big sauce and onions girl. Thank you for sharing this receipe! my husband is the "good" cook of the family and I have been told that I "am no Betty crocker" however, this one hit it out of the park!

I have made this several times as it is my husband's favorite meal.  The only thing I changed was adding more mushrooms.  I served it on medium Amish egg noodles. I use 5 thighs and he eats the leftovers for lunch.

I made this tonight and it was soo delicious! Made early in the day but left the baking part an hour before dinner. Husband and son love so much! Made exactly as the video but with 10 pieces of thighs. Served with mashed potato and corn. Will definitely make again! Thank you Chef John, I just love your recipes!

I increased the onions and garlic and used a different type of mushroom (fresh from the local farmers marker) and this recipe was great. My husband really liked it, even when he re-heated it the 2nd day. I will definitely make this again.

Loved it, family loved it!  Used white wine instead of red & broiled the chicken for a bit at the end to get the skin to crisp up.  Served it with garlic mashed potatos as suggested - will definitely make this again!

Best Recipe Ever!  I have made this recipe at least 5 times and the results are amazing.  The only change I make is adding garlic since garlic should always be added!  I also buy a nicer French wine like a Beaujolais; it truly enhances the flavor.  I serve with roasted fingerling potatoes or sometimes garlic mashed potatoes.

Relatively easy and inexpensive for such a delicious meal.  The favors were outstanding, and the chicken was juicy and tender.  I used thighs, and the tops of the thighs protruded out of the sauce in the oven, yielding a sticky, crispy, yummy skin.

Succulent and delish! I didn't use bacon and I added small white beans. I also only had dried thyme. Besides that, instructions were followed.

I hate wine, all wine & liquor. But...we have a lot of Mark West Pinot Noir vintage 2007 and I needed to use it. For the first time in 25 yrs my husband told me it's the best thing I ever made. I made the recipe as directed but used a small white onion and baby bella mushrooms.I used dried thyme and of course homemade chicken broth. I served this over mashed potatoes but as a treat I made thin fries out of red potatoes.After cutting I seasoned the fries w/salt, pepper and garlic powder I then threw in a scoop of King Arthur's flour-yes it makes a difference. Shook off excess flour and deep fried. I served the day old gravy over the fries....heaven. Try not to think about the calories.

This recipe is great! I followed it exactly but next time I will make sure I use the uncured bacon I normally use. I made pommes Anna and roasted asparagus as my sides. I also used a cabarnet Sauvignon as my wine for the dish. My husband is coming home tonight after a long trip and I know he will be surprised and happy about this dish. Thanks chef John!

I made this Fri. night for me and my husband and it was FABULOUS!  I'm not a big fan of chicken thighs, but this was incredibly delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  Served over garlic mashed potatoes.  It did take me longer in prep time, probably 30 min., but well worth it.  I'm not great cook, but couldn't believe something I made tasted so good.  It really helped watching the video beforehand.  This was something you'd probably pay $18+ for at a high-end restaurant.  Definitely on the short list!!

My husband made this on our anniversary and did not make any substitutions or adjustments.  Really delicious.  Definitely not a diet-friendly dish, but for a special occasion, well worth using bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (and bacon!!).

Oh my gosh! Beyond delicious! I've never written a review before but couldn't resist after making it tonight for us and a couple of friends. Made exactly as written and the compliments just kept rolling in. Even our picky 3 year olds cleaned their plates. This recipe will not disappoint.

The chicken was moist but no more than when I roast it and I can do that with a lot less trouble.  The sauce was at best okay.  There was no wow factor at all.

Made this last night for company, everyone really enjoyed this!  I used 12 thighs and increased the mushrooms to 16oz just to accommodate more people but left everything else the same.  Very good taste and definetly worth the little extra effort, will be serving this again.

I made this for my best friends in their anniversary... they told me they felt like they were eating in a fine restaurant, it was a hit!  My husband and I loved it as well.  Definitely one of the best things I've ver made or ate! I  accompanied it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, fresh green beans and, of course, the left over wine ;)

I made 2\3 of this recipe to see if I thought it'd be good for company.  My only regret is not to have doubled it.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was perfect.  I usually go short the first time on salt and pepper because I think sometimes chefs go overboard, but I think you could follow his directions pretty closely.  Yum!  Thanks again, Chef John!

Wow! This was great, lots of flavor. I really don't like thighs but intended to follow the recipe to the letter, however I found boneless, skinless thighs on sale so I used them instead. I was afraid they wouldn't be as good, but I don't see how it could have been better, plus it was great not having to worry about the bones. My only other change was to use dried thyme since I didn't have fresh. I like Chef John's videos. It helps to see it being made.

I couldn't wait to try this consistently rated 5 star recipe a try and I was NOT disappointed when I did!!! Such a restaurant worthy tasting dish that my family truly enjoyed! I didn't change or alter a thing. The chicken fell off the bone and the sauce was amazing! Definitely going to make this one again - probably when I want to impress my friends or family!!! Thanks Chef John - I have made many of your recipes and they are ALL exceptional!!!!

Fantastic rich cold-weather meal.  I like to make it a day ahead of time and let the flavors mellow.  Tastes great with mashed potatoes, noodles, rice or even just bread to sop up the delicious sauce!  Recipe takes time but is well worth it! Five stars indeed and thank you Chef John.

I use a lot of white wine while cooking, but I've not been a big fan of red wine sauces in the past.   This is the first time I was completely pleased with a red wine recipe.   Be prepared for a lot of steps to complete this coq au vin properly.   I didn't notice the "total time to prepare" until after I started on it one night.   Dinner was served much later than expected as a result, but it was well worth the wait.   An excellent dish overall.   Not hard to do, but again time and effort required to complete it.   My sauce after the baking was very watery.   I will allow even more time in the future for the sauce reductions.

Wow, I didn't know bacon bits went so well with decent wine - that was just while I was making this dish:0 I followed the recipe almost exactly (had sliced mushrooms instead of whole, please for give me!). Very rich tasting, so one thigh per person is more than enough. Easy to follow if you watch the video first.

I don't really care for red wine and kept my fingers crossed when I added it.  It was great!  Beautiful savory flavor.  I used what was on hand and substituted some things.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and 1 1/4 tsp of ground thyme.  Cooking time was 30-40 mins total.  I served it with mash cauliflower and pan fried pea patties.  Thanks Chef John!

I followed the recipe and served with mashed potatoes.
My family loved it and I can't wait for the leftovers.
I actually used 8 chicken thighs because that's what I had and didn't want to leave two out. 
We still seemed  to have enough sauce even with the 8 thighs.
This was so delicious.  Meat just fell off the bone.  Thanks once again Chef John!

This recipes deserves every one of its 5 stars! Just made this tonight, exactly as written, and it was outstanding. Even my husband, who doesn't care for mushrooms, loved it. He just threw his mushrooms on my plate - I was a happy camper. My chicken was done after only 40 minutes in the oven, so I would recommend checking the internal temperature after the first 30 minutes.
Thanks, Chef John, for another winning recipe. Now on to Chef John's Chicken Tikka Masala.

Wow...exceptional. Followed to a tee, and it was stunning. Took me about 2 hrs and then some, but well worth it. For the Chicken broth, I used homemade stock, very rich addition. Used a very nice Virginia Cabernet for the wine, and I must say, I've probably never made a better dish!!

My husband said "it seems old fashioned" so he wasn't such a fan - thought the sauce needed something more.  My view is the dish didn't take that much hands-on time and it smelled great when baking in the oven.  So I liked it more than he did.  Served with chef john's mashed potatoes and a green salad using "My favorite balsamic vinaigrette" from this site.

This dish is the bomb! I followed the recipe to a tee accept I used dry thyme instead of fresh, and before adding the sauce back to the thighs, I put them under the broiler to crispy them up a bit.  I was worried because I don't like red wine (or any wine for that matter) so I didn't think I would like this dish.  Boy was I wrong!  I paired it with mashed potatoes and fresh bread and was so stuffed.  Even my husband loved it and he's pretty finicky about trying new things.  If you are on the fence about whether or not you want to try this,  I have the answer for you~GO MAKE THIS DISH!  You'll be so glad you did!

My family of picky eaters loved this. It was a little salty but that was my fault due to the type of bacon I used. This dish was absolutely the best dinner I ever made. I'm don't cook often but with easy recipes like this and the praise received, I'm sure I'll be trying other recipes soon.  Thanks Chef John.

Both my sons liked it... they are starting to adventure with food now that they are young adults.  I used skinless boneless thighs because they were on sale.  Used a little more bacon (12 oz package...easier to just use it all).  I also used a 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme.. I guessed at this amount.   It all seemed to work for a nice dinner!!

This was quite possibly the best recipe I've ever made from Allrecipes!  I followed the directions exactly with exactly the same ingredients and it was so delicious that I forced us to not eat it all so we'd have leftovers for today!  I wanted to try this in advance of a dinner coming up in the future and it did not disappoint.  It took a bit of time to throw together but was well worth it, and I do not consider myself a gourmet cook whatsoever --the instructions are simple.  I totally agree with Chef John that using bone-in thighs instead of breasts is the way to go.  They impart so much flavor and when it was done they were fork tender.  Served it over a bed of mashed potatoes.  So, so yummy!  Can't say enough about it!  I wish I could give it 100 stars!  Fantastic!!!!  :-)

Yes Please! This was amazing. Will make over and over again. We had 3 big eaters and 2 little eaters with plenty of leftovers. My husband has requested this to be a sunday meal so he can take it for lunch in the morning.
