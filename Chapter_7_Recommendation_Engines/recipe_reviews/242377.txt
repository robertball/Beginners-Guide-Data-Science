Wow, are these good! I wanted to try a rib recipe that was different than my usual typical southern BBQ style. I'm so glad I tried these. I was a little skeptical of the amount of Chinese 5-spice powder, thinking it would overpower the ribs - NOT so!  And the glaze is to die for! A perfect combination of flavors. I cooked mine at 225 in my smoker for 3 hours using maple wood. I then wrapped them in foil and returned them to the smoker for 2 hours. Finally, I unwrapped the ribs, brushed on the glaze, and threw them on the grill til the glaze was caramelized and the ribs were nicely browned.  These were fall-off-the-bone scrumptious. The bone slid right out. My guests all raved about these. Highly recommended!
