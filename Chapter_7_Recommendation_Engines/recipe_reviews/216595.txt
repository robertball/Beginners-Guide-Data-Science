Very good mix of textures and sweet/salty.  I didn't have walnuts so I threw in pistachios instead.  DO NOT pass on the sesame sticks! I thought I would be missing chocolate but not really.

This was just okay. I followed the recipe exactly, only subbing pumpkin seeds with pistachios. Maybe, I am to used to theme flavored trail mixes on the shelves. This was just 2 textures and flavors, for the most part, the fruit and nuts. The sesame sticks didn't really do anything  to change the blend. In fact, the person I made it for did not care for the sesame sticks. So, I ended up having to remove them. I later added a couple of other ingredients to jazz it up after the fact. I did 4 servings and it yielded quite a bit more than suggested.
