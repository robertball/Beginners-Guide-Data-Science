This is a good and hearty, thick and chewy cookie, substantial and packed with flavor and texture.  You sure get your serving of fiber with this one! The cereal/oat flavor is not bashful at all, making this a distinctly "cereal"  flavored cookie.  The dough seemed a tad dry and crumbly as I dropped these onto the cookie sheet (with a medium cookie scoop, then flattened them slightly) but they turned out just fine - thick but not poofy, and perfectly, uniformly shaped.  Because I followed the recipe as written using shortening, I added a teaspoon of Lorann Butter Vanilla Emulsion in addition to the vanilla (found it at HomeGoods).  I don't know what difference that made, if any, but they sure tasted great!  I used quick-cooking oats and Special K cereal.  "Almost" like eating your breakfast cereal with your hands!  Yes, they might be just a teeny bit too sweet, but they're a cookie...and I can live with it.  :)

These were great with my morning coffee! I did make some changes.  I had no coconut so I subbed finely chopped hazelnuts, subbed corn flakes for the whole wheat flakes and added 1/2 cup of raisins.  I was too lazy to make individual cookies so I  baked them in an oiled 9x13 baking dish for 25 minutes until they were brown around the edges.  If you cut them right after you take them out of the oven they will be softer and easier to cut - I waited too long.  (Cutting them with a baking scraper/chopper makes it easier than with a knife.)  Good cookies!

This recipe is just like the one that my Grandma and I used to make. I loved going over to her house and asking "Grandma? Do you have Wheaties so we can make Ranger Cookies?" I couldn't find the recipe in her estate, so I am glad to find it here!

Great cookie.  I double the recipe and used cornflakes.  Added 1/2 cup each of coconut and slivered almonds plus 1 cup chocolate chips. Wonderful!

Absolutely one of the best cookie recipes from this website!They're sooo  good and kind of healthy too ;) My only addition was half cup of golden raisins and two tablespoons of ground flax seeds, also I rerigerated the dough for about 20 min before baking oh and also I used butter  instead  of shortening. Thanks! Elvira S. Phoenix, Az.

Very easy to make. These cookies came out very moist and baked into perfectly round cookies. I made some changes only because of what I had on hand. I used only whole wheat flour and added a little more oatmeal because I was out of coconut and added raisin flake cereal with a fourth cup of golden raisins. Lastly I increased vanilla to a teaspoon and added cinnamon to taste. Delicious cookie, will make again!

Wow, these are really great cookies.  I just made a batch and not only are they deliciously crispy chewy (just like a cookie should be in my opinion), with the oats and whole grain cereal, they've got some healthy stuff going for them too.  I substituted butter for shortening; I just like the taste better.  And for the whole grain cereal I used Nature Path's Heritage Cereal.  I'm definitely keeping this recipe and will make these again, but next time I'll double the recipe because using a medium sized cookie scoop only yielded 21 cookies. Well, 20 if you don't count the one I ate immediately after they came out of the oven!

LOVE these cookies. I added another 1/4 cup of butter and used Post Maple Pecan Crunch cereal because I didn't have Wheaties. They spread out quite a bit (probably because I added extra butter), so leave extra space for spreading. Also, they didn't come off the sheet very easy. Next time I will either use a non stick cookie sheet or spray it with Pam.

My picky kids love these cookies. Have made as is and it's great! Have also made with 1/2 choc chips added-great! And have also tried with the choc chips and eliminated the corn flakes which is also great, even a softer cookie! Thanks for your recipe!

Good cookies.  They remind me of coconut macaroons.  Bf approved them as well.  Only a few of mine flattened out--the rest were kind of round on top.  Still, I guess I can live with that.  10 minutes is a perfect bake time.  They brown at that time, and I thought I might have overbaked them, but they were still nice and chewy.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is very good. I use butter instead of shortening and add gum drops (for Christmas time) to make a wonderful Christmas cookie.

I am a cookie fanatic and make many kinds.  These are so good my 14 yr old told me to never make any other cookies but these.  I didn't have enough shortening so added butter too.  I didn't have Wheaties so I used honey bunches of oats.  They are phenomenal!!!

Delicious cookies! I used WW pastry flour, butter-flavor Crisco, and in place of the cereal and coconut, I used 1-1/2 cups of Almond Maple Granola (from this website), and I added 1/2 cup raisins. This is a great recipe, Rhonda!

Very good, very satisfying snack. Rather easy to make and with simple ingredients. I added almonds and raisins to mine - great recipe!

The mix was crumbly and seemed like it would never stick together. I worried adding raisins and almond chips ruins the consistency. Nope! Just press a few scoops into something semi-solid and bake them. They come out chewy, crunchy and utterly delicious!

I didn't have wheat flakes so I used corn flakes, and I added about a cup of chocolate chips and it sent these cookies over the moon! So good! Crisp on the edges and chewy in the center. Perfect cookie. Freezes well. The only problem I had is the 2nd time I made them I didn't have time to make the batter and bake the cookies in one sitting so I made the batter one day and popped it in the fridge to make the next day. BIG MISTAKE! The batter became dry and crumbly and was impossible to work with. Well not 100% impossible since I was able to make cookies with it (and they still taste great and have a great texture) but very, very difficult to work with. Something I will not do again with this recipe, but I will definitly be making it again!

I used to make this recipe from the Betty Crocker Cookbook and used Buckwheat Cereal. I guess they don't make it anymore, so I switched to Wheaties and it's just fine. The last time I made them, I used coconut oil instead of shortening and they came out even better.

The cookies turned out perfect, chewy and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and I will definitely make them again and try some variations, specifically I will try adding some toffee bits for a different flavor.

I have been buying ranger cookies at Kroger's supermarket when I am close to one. The closest is over an hour away. I've looked for recipes for them everywhere, FINALLY!!! here it is on my favorite recipe site. I did substitute rice krispies for the wheaties and next time I make them I will cut back a bit on the sugar. My husband loves them.

Great cookie - chewy and crispy. I didn't have wheat flakes so I used what I had which was a sweetened puffed rice cereal. Worked perfectly. Thanks!

Great recipe! Just as it is written. I’ve tried others and always come back to this one. I have also on occasion added to it, just trying for fun. A couple tablespoons of molasses makes a great add. Raisin Bran flakes is also good. Dried blueberries too. But this recipe is just perfect as it is!

Loved it for easy / simple, but eliminated the 1/2 cup white sugar and added raisins for sugar sensitive children and they were still yummy and satisfying.

I love this cookie and so do all the kids I make them for. I use regular corn flakes instead of the whole wheat. I make them at least 2 times a month. I also make them for fund raisers and they are a hit.

We love coconut and cereal, & this recipe packs a punch of both nestled in a delicate cookie. Since we love the cookie as much as the fillings,  I have reduced the wheat cereal and oatmeal to 3/4 C. each and coconut to 1/3 C. so there is more dough around the fillings. Also, watch the cookies for that golden brown appearance;  10 minutes was too long a cooking time in my oven. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

I made these as written...but after trying them after the first batch, we thought these cookies were dry and too wheaty (I used Wheaties). The flavor was better the more you chewed though. With the rest of the mixture I added 2 tablespoons of butter and a cup of butterscotch chips and they were better.

Exceptional recipe every time I've made it. Sometimes I tweek it a bit and other times I do it exactly as the recipe says. I always double the recipe though as it makes a small batch. When I feel like a less sweet cookie I cut the white sugar to 1/4 cup. I always use corn flakes for the cereal. If I want a softer cookie I use half butter and half shortening. All shortening makes a crisper cookie. Anyway I make it, it's still our favorite.

the cookies were ok, but they burnt.  Not sure why, no one else seemed to complain of that.
