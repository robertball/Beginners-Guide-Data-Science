After reading  previous reviews I came up with a recipe that worked perfectly for me.   I agreed with the lady that said there was no way she was going to cook potatoes for 2.5 hours!  I have real good chicken soup base, where chicken is the first ingredient.  The first thing I did was boil the potatoes in the chicken stock.   Since some people commented that the potatoes were a little bland, I added a couple chunks of garlic to the stock.  Between the stock and the garlic, I knew it would give the potatoes a great start.  I cooked them until they were ALMOST done.  Then I drained them and put them in a baking dish.  In another bowl, I added the olive oil, (NO water!)zest of an entire big lemon after microwaving it for 30 seconds to make it juicier and all the contents of that lemon.  I added fresh rosemary and thyme from my garden along with some Greek oregano and fresh ground black pepper and a little salt.  I baked them uncovered for about half hour stirring them half way through and they were delicious!  We had company for dinner I and wanted something to go with the Souvlaki and this was perfect!  They had had lot of flavor and you could taste a hint of the lemon.  They were as good as I've had in the Greek restaurants and they didn't take long to prepare! I'll definately be making these again.

The first time I made this recipe I followed the directions as stated.However, I used golden potatoes. The 2nd time I used the juice of one lemon, 3 bouillions. I was out of thyme so I used a tsp of oregano. About 10-15 min before they were done I pulled the lid off so that they would be a bit dryer like my fav greek restaurant. The potatoes were good the first time, GREAT the 2nd time.  This is a definite keeper

I didn't follow this recipe completely...so I am rating it on the changes that I made:  added oregano and sea salt (to taste), used fresh rosemary chopped very fine (about 1/2 teaspoon), and subbed chicken broth for the water and boullion.  I mixed everything (potatoes & seasonings, oil, etc.)together and then added only enough chicken broth to moisten everything (1 1/2 cups would be way too much in my opinion).  Roasted them as directed...be sure to start testing at 1 hour if your potatoes are cut into small pieces.  Delicious!

Great potatoes; however, I made changes based on other reviews.  I only used half of the oil, half of the water, double the fresh lemon juice, used 3 cubes of vegetable bouillon, and used 4 garlic cloves.  I also boiled the potatoes prior to placing them in the oven to boil off some of the starches and reduce cooking time.  In the end, the potatoes still took about an hour and 10 minutes.  The potatoes were amazingly delicious and would definitely make them again.  Thanks!

WOW, all I can say is these are far better than any greek restaurant's lemon roasted potatoes.  I cut back the water by half and two hours was perfect, and I tossed them three times during the cooking process. Thank you Cathie!!!

Okay, I know I am in the minority, but we didn't like these.  The had an odd taste that just didn't seem to match.  I suspect it was the lemon.  I will not make them again.

These are some mighty fine tastin' taters.  I halved the recipe and used barely a Tbs olive oil, reduced the water by a 1/4C and subbed veggie bouillon cubes for the chicken-flavored.  Only minor downfall is the bake time... didn't want the oven on for over an hour just for the potatoes, so I steamed them first in the microwave, then baked at 400 for 20 min.  Taste great cold, too.  Thanks!

I loved this.  I tweaked the recipe a little bit - adding three vegetarian boullion cubes instead of two chicken ones, and I used some vegetarian stock in place of some of the water (which I had reduced to 3/4 of a cup).  I upped the temparature to 400 degrees, and baked for an hour - taking off the covering for the last fifteen minutes.  It was absolutely fantastic!

I  found a ''key'' ingredient missing- ''OREGANO''! this is a simple must have ingredient when doing Greek Potatoes, or Grecian Chicken as well. I also prefer Yukon Gold potatoes, and just simply cutting them into wedges, spray a baking sheet with non stick- and coating the potatoes with extra virgin olive oil, parsley,Oregano, paprika, salt, pepper to taste-and fresh lemon juice cover and bake- and i add NOTHING else.. have made them this way for 21 years now- and get people wanting seconds and  thirds..

I think this recipe has potential, though I was not thrilled with my first attempt.  Next time I will use less water as mentioned by one reviewer (I thought they were too soggy) and cut back on the lemon some.  I did use only 1/2C olive oil as someone else suggested, and that seemed fine.  Will add PLENTY of herbs -- I used fresh thyme, oregano and basil, but I didn't use enough -- I think these potatoes should be very savory....  I made with the Greek Bifteki, which I HIGHLY recommend.  I'll be making this combo again!

I was looking to recreate the Greek restaurant potatoes, and these are them! I used chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon. I had about 7 small baking potatoes, I peeled them and halved them, and placed them in a 9x13 dish. Poured the mixture on top, and baked (uncovered) the whole time. I turned them once midway - and they were PERFECT!

OMG!! These aren't LIKE the potatoes you get at a Greek restaurant. These are BETTER!! I only changed the seasonings a bit, using only oregano (2 teaspoons) and salt and pepper (no boullion). Mixed up everything in a bowl, put it in the oven for an hour covered, then uncovered them for the last 20-30 minutes. I have never tasted such a flavorful potato! Had to throw myself between by husband and the pan so he didn't eat them all! Definitely a winner!

The lemon flavour was way too over-powering, and I lOVE lemon.  Having said that, the cooking method is far superior to anything I've done before (cooking in water).  The potatoes turn out nice and soft, just like in a Greek restaurant.  Unfortunately for me, the lemon was just too strong and ruined the dish. I will definitely make this again but with maybe 1/8 of a cup or less of lemon juice!

Followed advice, par boiled in chicked stock and garlic cloves. Wisked olive oil, lemon juice and herbs. Drained and placed potatoes in baking dish. Poured oil and lemon mixture and tossed to coat. Oven 10 minutes, stirred and then another 10 minutes. Topped with feta cheese and fresh herbs - OUTSTANDING! Everyone gobbled it up! Thank you!

This recipe is great!  It is super easy and I like the fact that it doesn't have the heavy ingredients (cream, butter, cheese)that so many potato recipes have.  Plus it is so flavorful.

These are delicious!  I take th foil off at the end of cooking and let the liquid cook off.  This makes the potatoes more flavorful.  Very authentic!

My fiance liked this one alot. Personally I think there was way too much water and oil in this recipe. I think the potatoes would come out better if you drop the amount of oil to about 1/2 cup, left the water out, and then tossed the potatoes in the mixture. Bake for about 40 minutes and the broil for a couple of minutes to get them a little crispy. Cooking them like the recipe called for they came out very mushy. I actually drained out the liquid half way through and marinated a chicken breat in it. I will let you know how it works as a marinade.
1/23/06 - The chicken came out awesome using this recipe for a marinade... I rate the chicken a 4.5!

These were AWESOME! Identical to the ones served at my favorite Greek restaurant. I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the rosemary and was more than thrilled with the results. Even my boyfriend, who is very picky, went back for seconds. The lemon juice is a MUST here. 1/4 cup is the perfect amount. Although I would recommend cooking at least 2-2 1/2 hours.

Yummy yummy yummy. I looked everywhere for a recipe that tasted like those at the greek restaurant I worked at when I was 17, and I've found it. I serve these with anything and everything, from meatloaf to fancy dinner parties, and they always get a good reaction!

Excellent as is ... 5 star!  If you are pressed for time, parboil the 'golf ball size' potatoes with the bouillon, 2 cloves of garlic, and the whole unwaxed lemon and salt in a pot for 12 minutes.  Drain the potatoes reserving 3/4 cup of the liquid.  Make the oil mixture as per the recipe adding new garlic and carefully squeezed lemon, fresh oregano, rosemary, thyme if you have it, and the reserved bouillon, salt and pepper.  Bake at 400 uncovered stirring every 15 minutes until crisp.  About 1 hour.  Jamie Oliver would tell you to scuff up those potatoes after draining them by tossing them around in the pot.  It fluffs the outside and makes them crispier when you bake them.

Quite a good potato dish! I think maybe I'd reduce the lemon juice a tad, or maybe toss the potatoes with the mixture instead of just pouring it over, because the olive oil/lemon juice mixture pooled at the bottom of the dish and the potatoes on the bottom were VERY lemony. I skipped the chicken bouillon because I didn't have any, perhaps that would have soaked up some of the 'lemony'ness. Also skipped the rosemary because I don't really care for it on potatoes, and used a bit more thyme than called for. Also sprinkled lightly with salt right before serving.

These were so delicious. I took off the foil for the last half hour to crisp up the top of the potatoes. They tasted just like ones I've had on holiday in Greece. Gorgeous!

First off I followed the directions of another poster:

The first thing I did was boil the potatoes in the chicken stock. Since some people commented that the potatoes were a little bland, I added a couple chunks of garlic to the stock. Between the stock and the garlic, I knew it would give the potatoes a great start. I cooked them until they were ALMOST done. Then I drained them and put them in a baking dish. In another bowl, I added the olive oil, (NO water!)zest of an entire big lemon after microwaving it for 30 seconds to make it juicier and all the contents of that lemon. I added fresh rosemary and thyme from my garden along with some Greek oregano and fresh ground black pepper and a little salt. I baked them uncovered for about half hour stirring them half way through and they were delicious! 

I also cooked them with baby carrots and they were perfect.  The potatos came out crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy inside!  Ate this with the grecian pork recipe from this site and it was a lovely dinner.

These were some of the best potatoes I have ever had. I will be making these again very soon. My son even had seconds.

I thought these were delicious.  I did take a shortcut because I didn't want to cook potatoes for 2 hours.  I peeled the potatoes and boiled them in chicken broth and garlic until I could just pierce them with a fork.  In a bowl I mixed the olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, fresh thyme, fresh rosemary, fresh oregano, salt & pepper.  I strained the potatoes and moved them to a cookie sheet.  I poured the olive oil mixture over the potatoes and baked them at 400F for 30 minutes, turning the potatoes after 15 minutes.  I served the potatoes with a greek salad (with the Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing from this site) and Souvlaki from this site

It was really good... but the sauce was a bit soupy so I will probably thicken it a bit next time.

AWESOME!!!!!  The only thing is I boiled mine for like 12 minutes to cut down on baking, and I think they didn't absorb as much "juice" as they would have had I baked them longer.  Next time, and there WILL be a next time, I will just set aside 2.5 hours to bake them.  These are a total keeper and if restaraunt style greek potatoes are your thing, you won't be sorry with this recipe.

Tasted great, to cut down cook time, I cut up the potatoes, placed them in the microwave with a bowl, added some water, covered the bowl and cooked it for about 10 mins. Worked great.

The recipe is dead simple to make and tastes every bit as good as what you would get in a greek restaurant. I agree with all of the other reviews - add a bit more lemon. Delicious!

Very delicious and easy to make. I had all ingredients on hand except for the Thyme (used oregano instead).  I didn't feel like heating up the oven or peeling potatoes, so I quartered the potatoes and put them in a Ziploc bag.  In a small pot I boiled the 1.5 c. water with the bouillon and set aside.  I whisked the remaining ingredients in a bowl and then poured the bouillon in the bowl.  I covered the bowl, and put it in the freezer for about 30 min to cool.  Then, I poured the liquid in the ziploc bag and shook the potatoes.  Cooked the potatoes over the grill on low heat for 40 minutes (used two sheets of heavy duty aluminum foil folded first into a boat to avoid all that liquid running off the counter, wrapped up the potatoes with the remaining foil and wrapped again with an additional sheet of foil).  Although there was barely any liquid left when the potatoes were finished, next time I will cut the liquid in half...it seemed way too much and too tricky when first pouring the potato mixture on the foil.  Can't wait to try this in the oven as the recipe says it should be made.

These potatoes were great. I used 3 cubes of chicken base and added some oregano and fresh garlic to the liquid base. I would highly suggest using half of the water called for. I also had to cook for 2 and 1/2 hours and took the cover off the last 15 minutes. I wil definately make again!

I love these potatoes! The other day while making them though, I found I had no room in the oven, so I put them in the crock pot on high for about 3 hours. They were AMAZING! I always make these with Chicken Piccata!

Fabulous, although I used red potatoes and cut them into bite sized pieces, which reduced the roasting time to 60-90 minutes.  Also, uncover after about an hour to allow the liquid to evaporate a bit.

I made these potatoes, following the recipe, and it was the perfect dish to accompany the souvlaki.  Everyone enjoyed them.  Despite the cooking time the potatoes weren’t overly crisp, just nicely browned.  So good, I’m making them again tonight.

I think the length of cooking time is essential to capturing the texture that makes these truly greek style potatoes.  It's a very particular texture you never knew you needed in your life until you've had it or lost it.  Since most greek yiayias dont write down their recipes, it can be tough figuring out h ow to make dishes from childhood.  These seem pretty close.  Every family is different, of course, but these capture the main idea.

Absolutely delicious potato dish. Have shared recipe with many people who love it as well. I always double the recipe so their are leftovers, especially grilled potatoes for breakfast. Awesome!!!!  I always use straight chicken broth for water and cubes. Sometimes I substitute wine for the lemon juice and use Herb de Provence for spices.

Followed a tip for quicker cooking. Boiled potatoes in stock with garlic. Also used the lemon zest and 4 cloves garlic. Baked at 400 degrees for 25min. Turned the oven off for last 5 min, while waiting for the souvlaki.Delicious will make again with pork souvlaki and greek salad! Kids loved it too!

Followed the recipe closely, but substituted granulated garlic for fresh.  Whole family loved it & it made nice leftovers reheated in the toaster oven.  Very nice twist to potatoes that breaks up the boring routine...enjoy!!!

Boiled the potatoes first to cut down cooking time.  Used chicken stock instead of bouillon cubes/water and broiled until they were slightly crispy/crumbly. Turned out great!

By far the best greek potatoes recipe I have ever used.  I used 1 1/2 cups chicken stock in a box and work perfectly.  I uncovered the potatoes about 1 hour in to the cooking time to reduce the stock and brown the tops of the potoates.  Yummy!  Thanks Cathie.

These were pretty good, but the lemon needs to be toned down a little.  It wasn't bad, just overpowering enough that I didn't love the final product.

Tasty side dish! Only thing I did differently was boil the potatoes a bit before baking them for reduced baking time.

These were really good.  The lemon flavor was a little hard to get used to at first.  I made some suggested changes.  Added 1/2 t. salt, some dried oregano, used 1 T. fresh rosemary, and 1 T. fresh thyme.  I added the bullion to 1/4 cup hot water, cubed the potatoes and left the skin on.  Baked about 1.5 hours

When I first made this recipe I thought I had potato soup in my casserole dish. However, I stuck to it and like another reviewer, and after 75 min., I took the cover off with 15 min. to go and these were AWESOME !!  perfect and a nice change from regular roasted potatoes.  The second time I made these I cut up an onion and mixed it in.  This was was really tasty also.

A delicious and different way to have potatoes! As someone else suggested, I uncovered the dish and drained most of the liquid during the last 1/2 hour so that potatoes would be browned a little. next time, I won't probably cover at all and use less liquid.

These potatoes tasted awesome! Cut potatoes into eighths- boiled for a few minutes first and then baked for 20 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered (had to turn up the temperature a little at the end in order for the potatoes to brown). Added some red pepper for spice and put some slightly stale garlic bread, torn into small pieces, on top of the potatoes and occasionally stirred while baking to distribute sauce/juices- delicious flavor. Served with steamed corn and chicken marinated in a similar seasoning (oil, lemon, oregano, rosemary, garlic, red pepper, salt and pepper). Yum!

These are great with the Grecian Pork tenderloin.  Because you cover the dish, they aren't roasted, but almost steamed.  I used 5 potatoes and still had plenty for the 4 people I was serving.

This dish has a long cooking time but the results are worth every minute. We had it at a potluck and it was the first dish to empty. The second time I made it I transferred the potatoes to a cookie sheet and broiled for about 5 minutes. Either way, delicious.

My family loves this dish! I use Yukon Gold or Red potatoes. The cook quicker, and get nice and mushy on this inside while they get nice and crispy on the outside.

ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! These were the best potatoes I ever had! Even better then in the restaurant. I used aluminum foil to cover the potatoes and turned the oven on maximum. The potatoes were ready after 1 h 15 min -- enough time to prepare a broccoli salad and Greek bifteki. Yummmmm

Very nice.  Ate at a Greek restaurant last night and loved their roast potatoes, went looking for a recipe and found this one.  The only change I made was to cook the potatoes at 450 for 50 minutes instead of 350 for 2 hours, and I turned them once at about 20 minutes.  Came out delicious.

Delicious, but needed a little tweaking to give it that extra something.  Added 7 cloves of garlic (whole) to the roasting pan. Added a sprinkling of kosher salt after roasting. Also tossed with about 1 tablespoon each of feta & mint. The amount of liquid was perfect. Super soupy going in the oven, but after 2 hours was just exactly the right amount of moisture / crispiness.

Made tonight - delicious! I didn't have any Rosemary so I just omitted it but they were still really good. I was a little worried that they would be soupy as it was a lot of liquid with the potatoes going in, but they turned out great in 90 minutes. Will make again!

This recipie is great but DOES need changes. First and foremost reduce the water, do not use 1 1/2 cups I used about 1 cup (at most) another thing I changed was I used red potatoes which worked out very well and because red potatoes are small in size i used alot more than six about 11....Like the other comments said use more boullian and maybe add a bit more rosemary and thyme but definetly another clove of garlic. these potatoes are meant to be dry not moist and full of water. I also uncovered them at the end of cooking and they turned out excellent 1st time making these and will definetly make these again the family LOVED them!

This is a very yummy side dish, but I did have to adjust the cooking method to get the dish cooked in time for dinner.  Rather than cook the potatoes in the oven the whole time I boiled them until about 1/2 done and then continued with the rest of the recipe (but of course left out the water).  I really enjoyed the end result, but next time I'll add a bit more lemon (personal preference). Thanks for the recipe!

I have to retry this...I think 2 hours was too long with the oven I used.  They were kind of dry & b/c they were overcooked, it was hard to taste the olive oil mixtuere so I'll try again for a shorter length of time. I had a Greek roommate and her mom always brought this to us and it was delicious.  I have high hopes for round 2!

These were very interesting... the 1.5 cups water turned it all into a liquidy broth, and the bouillon didn't dissolve, since the liquids were room temperature.  So I had to microwave the liquid.  And the potato chunks cooked in a mere 20 minutes!

It was a good flavor, though... maybe we'll try again with little or no water.

I know people don't like it when people rate their changes.  BUT recipes don't have to be followed to a T, and every good cook knows that...
My changes.  I used italian seasoning - not thyme and rosemary.  I added more salt.  I decreased the water to about 1/3 cup and added lemon juice to taste.  They take about 1.5 hours to cook.  If I could rate higher than a five start - I would.  These are beautiful with the chicken gyros slouvaki recipe from this site as well.  A meal fit for a king!

I loved these.  I served them for a greek theme dinner party and they complimented my other dishes extremely well.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of only using a 1/2 cup of water instead of 1 1/2 cups.  They turned out perfect this way and there was just enough liquid left in the pan after cooking to coat the potatoes before serving.  I cut my potatoes in 1 inch pieces and they were cooked within 1 hour.

These were ok.  Made the recipe exactly as written and we didn't taste any of the lemon juice.  They were rather bland.  May need to spice it up a bit more if I plan on making these again.

Excellent flavor and quick/easy.  Young kids, husband and I all loved.  I turned heat up to 400 degrees and only loosely covered with foil, removing foil last 15-30 minutes.  I didn't measure lemon juice--used juice of one whole lemon.  I used about 5 cloves of garlic. I let the liquid mixture sit and meld while I chopped veggies. Used red potatoes.  Was perfect amount of flavoring, liquid, etc.  The lemon really makes this dish! Potatoes were perfectly cooked in about an hour, liquid evaporated, and removing cover helped dry them a bit.  I served with my turkey burgers--delish dinner!

Very, very good. I used oregano instead of rosemary (I find oregano to give more Greek flavour and Rosemary more Italian - but that's my idea) The lemon and chicken bouillon give an unexpected flavour that I personally love with roasted chicken. Use all the liquid !!! I bake the potatoes covered for about 1/2hour, then uncovered for about 3/4hour. When you cut your potatoes a little smaller - cooking time can be adjusted to 1hour uncoverd !!  The liquid reduces and starts to caramalize on the sides of the dish... Make sure to tast this...

Very good recipe, but I changed it a bit as per another Greek recipe on this site. I basically combined the 2. I scaled this down for 2-3 people. I had no lemon, used fresh rosemary and italian seasoning. I cooked it at 400F for 1 hour covered and 15 minutes uncovered. Then I added crumbled feta and cooked for 5 more minutes, finishing with a broil. YUM. I picked this recipe over the other because of your use of the chicken bouillon - really adds flavour. Great basis and next time will add onions!

These are just awesome! I didn't have lemon juice though, but used the bouillon, oil & seasonings. I used red potatoes cut in wedges, and didn't peel them. Baked an hour covered, and about 20 minutes uncovered. TIP: I didn't stir or turn the potatoes at all. They were crispy brown on the bottom, and puffy on top - really, really good!

I read that some people had cut down on the water or oil, but i decided to try the recipe as is. The only change I made was to throw the potatoes in the bowl to get the mix spread evenly, and i used vegetable bouillon. I used red potatoes which have a really thin skin, so I didn't peel them. I did cook them covered as suggested to make sure they cooked all the way through, but uncovered them the last half hour so they would brown. I had made extra hoping to have some for tomorrow's meal, but they are all gone! It's very difficult for potatoes to actually absorb the flavoring but this one did it. One of the best potato recipes I've tried. Thanks for sharing it!

Another hit with the family. I fixed these because I was looking for a potato recipe to serve with gyros. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added more flavor to the dish - more spices, but just flavors we like. Don't skimp on the lemon juice or garlic. I cut the potatoes smaller, more bite size because I think that's easier and more pleasing when served. My family says to make these again - and I figure they have exquisite taste.

This is my favourite way to eat spuds.  I only add a splash of EVOO and use fresh rosemary.  I especially like to eat these cold the next day.  If you love lemon you should give this recipe a try.  It has to be the most stress-free way of cooking spuds

I made these exactly as the recipe stated, and they were very good.  The ones I get in Greek Restaurants are a little more flavorful - next time I'm going to try adding more lemon juice and garlic.  I don't think it was too watery - at the end I spooned the extra sauce over the potatoes, and it was great.

This is bad. I could eat way too many of these!! SOOO good!! Ok. Here's one suggestion for the reviewer further down that thought the herbs were just too over powering- try switching to just oregano- and you'll still have an authentic greek potato dish!!

These potatoes were fine, just not great. I added some crumbled feta before serving and that added some great flavor. I'll probably make them again but will add more lemon juice and possibly salt and garlic.

I love these potatoes!  My whole family eats them up- We had company last night so I made lots of extras. Afterwards, we sat around the table chatting for hours after the meal. Everyone at the table kept grabbing more potatoes (even thought they had stuffed themselves during dinner), while we were talking. By the end of the evening they were all gobbled up! Thanks so much for this recipe.

I didn't like the taste these potatoes had.  I am very open to different tastes and flavors but the rosemary completely overpowered this dish.  I believe these potatoes would be better with less rosemary.  This is a recipe with potential but it needs some tinkering.

These were great potatoes.  I served them with the souvlaki, greek salad III and tzatziki sauce II recipes from this site (with baked pita bread, of course!) Everyone loved my first attempt at a Greek meal.

I didn't care much for these potatos. My daughter liked them ok. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and reduced the oil and water. I only added 1/4 cup of water. I did not want them to  fall apart and become soup. The potatos looked great, but the flavor was odd to me with the lemon and rosemary. I baked them for the 1st hour covered and then I uncovered them so that the liquid would evaporate and the oil would fry and crisp the potatos on all sides as I turned them during the last 30-45 minutes. I got the look and crispness I wanted, but the flavor really wasn't appreciated much by my family. No re-runs on this recipe.

First time I made this it literally was soup, I liked the flavor though.  Second time I only used about 1/4 cup chicken broth with the olive oil and lemon juice, with the seasonings.  Absolutely wonderful roasted potatoes.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Takes a while to cook, but you end up with really moist, delicious potatoes.  One variation we used was to substitute chicken broth for the water, instead of using bouillon.  This helped infuse the flavour, I think.  Delicious!!

I am not sure what the heck all of that water was about, but I reduced it by half (to 3/4 c), and it was still way too much; I ended up dumping the water about halfway through the baking process so I didn't have waterlogged potatoes.  Still had enough flavor for the potatoes to be really good though.  I also added a teaspoon of oregano because it's Greek to use oregano.  (Ask me; I'm Norwegian!)  :-)  And I doubled the lemon juice, but next time I'd add even more as it was such a nice touch.

Loved these potatoes, but did a few things different. First I added about a tablespoon of oregano, used about 3/4 cup of lemon juice and ½ cup water, at least double the garlic, used vegetable cubes instead of chicken, and marinated the potatoes for 24 hours. They were amazing! Full of flavor and super zesty! (Only 4 stars cause I changed the recipe so much)

These were quite good. I cut back on the olive oil and water as some have suggested. I also used veggie bouillon. I substituted oregano for the rosemary. I also added 1 tbsp. of cidar vinegar for zip. Yummy yummy!

These potatoes were great, just like Greek restaurants.  Didn't have fresh lemons, so I used bottled lemon juice.  Used Chicken broth in place of the water and bouillion cubes.  Used about a tablespoon of fresh greek oregano in place of the dried.  Used Yukon Gold potatoes and did not peel.  They turned out fantastic.  I think the recipe cooking time is a bit long as mine were done after an hour.  Make sure to toss them a couple times through cooking time too.  I was preparing Halibut fillets and just basted the fillets with the remaining sauce from the potatoes.  It works excellently.  Will definitely make these again.

tasted like ordinary potoatoes to me- they have potential--- they needed a little more lemon and maybe next time i will try them on the grill instead of the oven- and use butter instead of the oil- i will try to perfect these but tweek the recipe a bit

We really liked these potatoes and went well with our lemon-infused chicken tonight! I added some garlic and onion powders but otherwise, didn't change a thing! Granted, they take a while to cook (so plan your main course accordingly) but well worth the wait! Will repeat this sidedish very soon!

These potatoes are wonderful.  I would have never guessed that lemon juice would be good in potatoes.  I have made these twice now.  They just melt in your mouth.  Thanks so much!

Absolutely delicious - tastes even better than the Greek potatoes at my favorite Greek restaurant! The flavors blend wonderfully. This makes a great side dish for Greek chicken, another allrecipes winner. This is now my favorite potato dish of all time! Thanks so much for posting it!

This was great... my family said "it tastes like authentic Greek restaurant potatoes". Loved the lemony flavour. I used greek seasoning in place of the suggested spices, everything else the same.

I made these as is except I added oregano as well.  They weren't bad, but they definitely were not nearly as good as any Greek restaurant that I've been to.  They weren't as flavorful And I don't like the idea of cooking them covered.  I did it, but I uncovered them during cooking because they were starting to steam, and I wanted them more roasted.  I'll be looking for a different greek potato recipe.

These are the best potatoes I have ever eaten in my life. I used chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water, and dill in place of the thyme. I could not stop eating them and ate them for breakfast the next day. I will make these potatoes forever!

These were absolutely amazing.  I followed the recipe "as is" except I cooked them uncovered.  That solved the potential "soupyness" issue.  I also added a pinch of oregano.  Served with chicken and a salad. These are our new staple potato recipe.

Rather than chicken bullion and water I used chicken stock (and less of it). I think the key to locking in the flavour is basting the potatoes pretty frequently as you go along. I think you get a significantly better texture if you don't boil the potatoes, and you could use oregano with or instead of rosemary. It's so worth it to cook them, and baste them the full time.

Fabulous! For speed I quartered the potatos and microwaved til 3/4 done. Put in pan, I had sprayed, skin side down and poured sauce over the top. Baked at 400 for 15 min then turned to flesh side down and baked 15 more minutes. Crispy outside...fluffy inside. Excellent with the Souvlaki by Abby Benner also from this site. Hubby said the two together was one of his favorite meals ever.

I used russet potatoes, peeled, cut up, added about 1/2 cup of water and microwaved for a few minutes to get them partially cooked. Added a boullion cube, olive oil, lemon juice, pepper, thyme, rosemary, pepper and fresh garlic to the bit of water already in the dish. Baked at 400 F with no lid for about 30-45 min. Yummy!!

Boiled Potatoes in Chicken broth till almost done, well suppose to be. In small bowl made a mixture of Olive Oil, 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 squeezed Lemon, fresh Oregano, fresh Rosemary, salt, pepper. Mixed that up & tossed over potatoes on baking sheet. Tried to cook to make crunchy as I had boiled them to the point of mashing them. After 10 min.'s in oven at 400, I took them out & mashed it all up with a little butter & milk. Turned into tasty Greek Mashed Potatoes.  Served with Greek Feta Chicken.

These potatoes are amazing. I am not a fan of potatoes but this puts a whole new twist on them. I would recommend these to everyone. I would suggest putting 1 tbsp of corn starch for added thickness to the sauch. Makes it even better

I too found that the potatoes were soggy due to the amount of liquid that the recipe called for. Near the end, I drained off the liquid and put the oven on broil to crisp them up and found that they were delicious.

Father Eva and I adore these potatoes.  Sometimes I add sliced carrots to the potatoes as they cook.  I also like to add fresh whole mushrooms to the pan during the last fifteen minutes of cooking time.

So delicious!  I could eat the whole pan of these potatoes by myself, but sadly, I have to share.

Excellent base recipe. I used a 1.5 lb bag of fingerling potatoes and they were great. I used them whole but next time I will try thick slices. I par boiled them and cut baking time down to 25 minutes. I also used lemon pepper, extra garlic, less water, less oil.  Important!! Zest the lemon and add the zest to the mix. YUM!!

I think the type of potatoes you use would increase the goodness of this dish, however the recipe itself was superb.

Delicious! the fresh lemon juice is the key ingredient! for less cook time just cut your potatoes up into smaller pieces. I usually always 'doctor' recipes but didnt this time & they were great!

these were truly amazing. Took them to a birthday party, and not a bite was left! Doubled and followed the recipe exactly, but did uncover the last 30 minutes to reduce the sauce. They were perfect!

Delicious!  I cut down the oil a touch, and I used water with no bouillon cube (didn't have any).  I added oregano per the other reviews, which was great.  I'm pretty obsessed with lemon, so I added about a tsp of lemon zest.   I loved them as is - though my husband preferred a slightly milder lemon flavour, so I'll skip the lemon zest next time.  I will be making these regularly!

Amazingly tasty recipe!! I made this for a large family gathering and EVERYONE was raving about them. The only thing though, I had to scale the recipe to 15 servings and the quantities were a bit off... Had way too much liquid that the potatoes were supposed to be baked in... I couldn't even fit it all into the bakind dish. Also, when they were finished cooking, I had a lot of leftover liquid in the dish which I simply discarded before serving. Will definitely be making these again. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Quite good.  I was craving Greek potatoes!  I served it with pan-seared steak (plain s&p seasoned) and the hubby was pleased.  He's excited to take the leftovers to work, too.

really good! I followed some of the others advice about lower the liquid amount and it turned out excellent. I also sprinkled feta on top which just made them delicious, but feta is always a good thing! The feta with the lemon and seasoning was mouth-watering good, better than some restaurants.

These potatoes were excellent.  I made the changes suggested by Lush but as I only had beef bouillion cubes I used two of them instead of the chicken.  I also took the lid off about 10 minutes early to let some of the water evaporate before serving.  My guests loved them!!

Very tasty!  The only change I made was partially boiling the potatoes first, until they were firm enough to keep its shape. The best part was the smell of the herbs! So good!

These are amazing! I just used ground thyme instead of dried thyme (that's all I had) and 3 chicken buillion cubes instead of 2, because I read a lot of the reviews. I also had to increase the temperature to 400 degrees F to get them to cook a bit faster, and after they were done, I turned off the oven and left them in there, still covered, for half an hour. DELICIOUS, definitely will make these again! Thanks so much for sharing this Cathie :)

These were good, however, they weren't at all crispy for me, since they cooked in the broth, and I found they lacked flavor.  They kind of just tasted like oven-boiled potatoes.  Mine also weren't all that Greek tasting, but that's probably because I didn't have lemon juice.  I would like to try these again, because they definitely have potential, but I think they need the lemon juice and lots of garlic, and a different cooking method to get them more crispy.  One other note - To cut the baking time down, I boiled them for a few minutes before pulling them out and popping them in the oven.  Baking for an hour and a half or so just seemed way too long.

My only problem with this recipe is that it requires 2.5 hours in the oven...therefore, I boiled the potatoes like another reviewer had advised in the chicken broth with the garlic until almost done then finished them off in the oven for 15-20 minutes. I added some water to what I still had in my pot and made a delicious rice! Served with an Israeli spice rub chicken, it was at least 5x better than our favorite Greek restaurant!

The taste is good, although I would use half of the water next time.  Mine were done after one hour; i left them in the oven for 15 minutes uncovered because they were too watery.

What a delicious way to eat potatoes!  I increased the chicken bouillon to three cubes, used oregano instead of rosemary, added a little salt, and served the potatoes with feta cheese.  I wasn't in a hurry, so I didn't try an alternate cooking method as many reviewers did.  It's actually somewhat convenient that these take so long to cook because if you're making a meal with several different dishes, you can start this one well in advance and not have to do as much juggling right before the meal.  I cut the potatoes in fairly small pieces and I think they still took about 2 hours to cook, so make sure to plan ahead.  The only problem I had was that my husband, who is on a diet, thought these smelled way too tempting and forbade me to make them again unless he's allowed to eat them!

These were pretty good. I personally found the lemon juice to be a tad overpowering. I think I would reduce the amount a bit. They were perfect after a little over an hour. I tossed them twice while baking.

These were so yummy!  I left out the rosemary though since I can't stand it, but otherwise made it as is.  Next time I would like to add some garlic and maybe a little dill.  I never would have thought to put lemon juice with potatoes but it paired up quite well.  I will most certainly be making these again!

This was a hit in our house tonight. I didnt add as much lemon and I changed up the bouillon to be the powdered bouillon instead of the cubes and I used only one cube's worth.  I baked it with the cover off because we like them to be a bit dryer.  Besides my hubby repeatedly saying how wonderful they smelled cooking, both kids and hubby LOVED these.  Hubby suggested doubling the batch of seasoning, adding other root veggies and using with a roast.  that I will try too!

I thought these were fantastic! When I made the "juice" I didn't really smell the lemon, so I added a little more but it really didn't need it. Next time I will make it exactly as written.

Just as good as our favorite greek restaurant.  I followed the advice of others and cut the oil in half and I cut the water down by 1/2 cup.  I did need to add garlic salt, it just seemed to need something.  My family loved the potatos and it went really well with a roasted leg of lamb.  Thanks for sharing!

These are sooooo good!!
I followed tips and used 1 cup of water with 3 boullion cubes. I also only used dried oregano & thyme as that was all I had on hand. 
I did find it needed a tad more lemon towards the end so we added 2tbs more and they were prefect. 
We diced our potatoes small and baked in the oven at 400 for 1 hour. Perfect. 
Made these with Souvlaki from this site as well.
Will be making these again.

Great flavor. I added an extra potato and some lemon zest for more lemon flavor.
I will however add less water next time cause even with the extra potato there was still some liquid left after 1:30 and the potatoes were a little softer than I would have liked.

This was delish!  I took the advice of a previous review and slightly cooked the potatoes before hand.  The only other difference was I used a fresh lemon that had 1/3 cup of juice in it.  Waste not want not and all.  Will definately make this again.

This was a great recipe.  It tasts just like the ones at the restaurant.  I cheated a bit and used small potatoes. I boiled them in chicken broth and then put them in the oven.  There was no way I was cooking these for 2 hours!

Been cooking these for years...just a hint...use instant chicken stock mix instead of the cubes.  Coat potatoes with some of the olive oil and then toss in the chicken stock.  I also sprinkle some on top.  More flavour this way.

After reading the reviews I was excited to try this dish.  I was, however, disappointed as the flavour was just OK and did not seep into the potatoes.  As a result, the potatoes were rather bland.

I really liked this recipe. Next time I think I will add less lemon juice though as they were a little too sharp for my taste. These are really good served with lamb and I will most definitely be making them again. :D

I've made several variations of this recipe. Often I've left out the boullion (because I'm out); I use whatever seasonings I have on hand, or adjust to suit the menu; I never peel the potatoes; I always use the juice of 1 fresh lemon. Every way we think they're very tasty!

Fabulous! I cut mine into smaller pieces so it would cook in half the time, and added a sprinkle of mediterranean oregano, just because. I only turned the potatoes once about 40 minutes into baking. I did use an extra potato and probably could have even added another without problem.

YUM!! Had these with some Grecian Chicken Pita Pockets... my husband says "give this 50 stars!" Obviously I cannot do that, but they were good. Cut down on the water, didn't have any lemon juice, and threw them in the microwave for 15 minutes and oven for another 20... SO GOOD!!

We loved this! I scaled down the water to 1 cup as per other reviews. I also didn't have thyme, so I used some basil. I also didn't have that much time, so I pre-steamed the potatoes just a little (still firm) and this way they were done in 20 minutes! I uncovered them for the last 10 and put the broiler on. Yum!

Won't make this again! The taste was all lemon. My husband rated it a 2 because you could eat it, but I wanted to make it a 1. Greek spices to me are mint & garlic. This was disappointing.

I was very skeptical about this one... I turned the potatoes at the half mark of cooking time and there was a lot of liquid left. I took the cover off and cooked for about 10 minutes, then put it back on and cooked 20 minutes more. Delicious! The rosemary scented our entire apartment. I sprinkled the potatoes with a big helping of Parmesean.

The potatoes tasted okay when I was getting rosemary stuck in my teeth. My son did not enjoy this because teh rosemary kept stabbing the roof of his mouth. My husband liked them. We prefer the ones at our favorite greek resturant

Based on some other Greek recipes, I added 1 tablespoon of fresh oregano to the recipe.

I love this recipe and have been using it for some time now.  Instead of 6 potatoes cut up, I use a bag of baby potatoes (red or white).  Nice served with flank steak slices.

These were some of the best potatoes I have ever had. My husband said they were too tangy for him, but by the end of the meal he was eating them right out of the pan. If you don't like really tangy things I would suggest cutting back on the lemon juice and adding more olive oil. It was perfect for me but, for my husband's sake, I will use more oil and less lemon.

I think these potatoes are fantastic.  They have lots of flavor, and best of all, they're super easy to make.  For even less clean up, I toss everything together right in the foil bag that I bake them in.

These potatos were only "ok". They had sort of a bitter taste. Added salt and pepper to better enhance the flavor, but I can't say I'll make them again.

Just made them, still picking at them too.  First bite seems super-lemony, every bite after that is just savory and delicious.  YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY.  I don't know how these compare to real Greek cuisine, but they will definitely be made again in this house.  OH, and I used 1/2 the water, as recommended in the other reviews.

Wow, these are moist and savory. I served with lemon wedges so everyone could squeeze on more juice if they wanted, which tasted great. If you use a thin skinned potato like Yukon Gold - skip peeling because they are awesome with the skins. I subbed chicken stock for the water and boullion and it was fine. Don't cover and they come out moist and roasted! I've never had Greek style potatoes before but this was an awesome intro...thanks, Cathie!

Love these.  I did substitute chicken broth for the water/bouillon cubes, and used 1 cup.  I also used a greek seasoning.  I hate to review a recipe when I altered it, but I think I stayed pretty close.  I will definately make again.

Thank you! I've always wanted a recipe that yielded moist potatoes. Mine seemed to always come out dry. These were so tasty and very authentic tasting. The house smelled heavenly. I used about 1/4 cup less water and used more lemon. I also added a dash of oregano. Can't help it. It's the Greek in  me. Thanks again!

Well, to all the naysayers,  the recipe states "fresh" lemon juice. If you use concentrated lemon juice, please reconstitute.  Those who do not want to follow the directions and cook for the allotted time, the potatoes will never brown. This recipe is awesome AS IS.

OMG! Absolutely delicious.  Better than my local Greek restaurant and they have great potatoes.  Made a few changes to the recipe.  The ingredients stayed as is except I cut the water back slightly to 1 1/4 cups, used only 1/5 cup of lemon, replaced the rosemary and thyme with 2 tsp. of Oregano, used 3 chicken bouillon, baked in a casserole dish turning the potatoes 2 times during cooking.  This was a huge hit with everyone here.

We both liked this even though I used lime juice instead of lemon as that was all I had on hand,  also made about half the recipe for the 2 of us.  I used small potatoes, cut in half and used about half of a Knorr boullion cube.  Surprisingly good!  I would make this again.

Pretty good. I found the liquid amount to be dead on if you cook the potatoes from raw in the oven (greek potatoes usually sit in about a 1/4 inch of liquid when finished cooking). I added 2 extra vegetable bullion cubes and used extra herbs (1 tbsp each fresh rosemary and oregano). I also put them under the broiler for an extra 5 minutes to crisp them up a little at the end. I would reduce the lemon a touch the next time I make them, but, all in all a pretty good recipe.

Excellent as-is.  I currently live in Greece, and the actual quality of potatoes here is different/better/buttery.  I've made this recipe before I lived here - great. Made it with actual Greece-grown potatoes - excellent.

AMAZING, so great with the "Honey Baked Chicken II".  Making it tonight.  One of my favorite meals to serve.  Only thing I add additionally is lemon zest, just because I love lemon flavor and more garlic, just because for me there is never enough garlic.

I made these with red potatoes and used about 8 all together. I also wrapped these in tin foil as made by one reviewer. They had a good taste but there was way to much oil and lemon juice for the amount of potatoes I used. Not sure if it was the lack of potatoes or that the recipe could have been cut down on both ingredients. I won't be making them because we have other potatoes that we like better. .

Very good. I added an extra bouillon cube and extra garlic. I added a touch of salt as well. For the last 30 min I cranked the oven to 450 to brown the potatoes a bit.

These turned out great.   I used oregano instead of the other herbs for personal preference. I let the potatoes soak in the mixture  a few hours prior to cooking.  I started them off in the microwave to reduce the cooking time.  I served them with chicken souvlaki brochettes and tzatziki sauce.

Made as written except for cooking time. Whole baked potatoes take less time than recipe states for these sliced potatoes. It was bland and not something  I will make again. I make a similar recipe roasting the potatoes with sea salt, pepper, less oil and no water,  adding lemon zest. Plus adding garlic and fresh herbs instead of dried.

Halved the water, and turned out pretty good. I added cayenne pepper and used fresh rosemary, otherwise followed directions. Can't give it five stars because it would be pretty mushy with that much water.

GOOD FAST EASY.  We enjoyed these. A simple recipe , but  makes quite different potatoes  for a change. I liked the lemon but might try with a little less next time. I did cook for full amount of time  and they were fine but I don't think I had to. I think these can be drained and refrigerate to serve warmed later.
Easy pre made for company. Definitely make again.

The recipe doesn't state what type of thyme, I am assuming it is leaves because I used ground thyme and the flavor was too intense.  I did add 1 tsp. of oregano as well.  Overall, a good dish but would definitely reduce the lemon juice to half of what is called for, it was way to overpowering.  As noted in previous reviews, I decreased the water by 1/4 cup, only used 1/4 cup oil,  and increased the baking temperature to 400F.  Will make again, but just tweak it a bit more.

Delicious pototo recipe!  Greek style potatoes are one of my favourites and discovering the simplicity of acheiving that flavour is an excellent addition to my "go to" dishes!   The modifications that I applied to this recipe are that  I first melt butter and add this to the  potatoes in the roaster pan along with salt & pepper.  After tossing and coating the potatoes with the butter, I then pour over the mixture.  It is best to always use fresh squeezed lemon juice when making the mixture!   Rather than the individual herbs listed, I use fresh dill and a Greek herb mix from Epicure.  I have made this a few times with different potatoes and it always turns out wonderful regardless of which type chosen.

I used half sweet potato, DELISH! These were so flavourful! I used chicken broth in place of the water and cubes. Replaced rosemary with oregano (taste preference). Also added the zest of the entire lemon, and instead of slicing the garlic smashed them and left them whole so I could eat those(used 4). Mine baked in 1 hour at 375. The juices were so delectable. I really would suggest cooking them low and slow. I've looked at a few other recipes for Greek potatoes.. But most don't say to cover.. I feel that covering them allows the moisture to soak into the potatoes more.. Also makes them so tender.. And really like the ones you get at your favourite Greek restaurant. I cut my potatoes in half (medium sized) and my sweet potatoes in fairly large chunks and they cooked up just fine. I suggest only using a drizzle of olive oil.. As I believe 1/3 is a tad much. This will become a staple in my house now.. Thanks!

I made one small change. I boiled the potatoes for about 15 minutes and then tossed in the olive oil sauce (minus the water) and put it to bake. I like them a little crispy. It was wonderful and the boiling helped the potatoes to absorb the flvor of the sauce. It was amazing.

We really enjoyed this. I cooked them covered for an hr at 400 degrees and took the cover off for the last 15 mins. I also cut them into smaller bit size cubes. Only used 1/4 cup oil and 1 cup water to dissolve the boullion.  Also added oregano. I used white potatoes. Yukon potatoes would be just as good.

Next time I would add a little less lemon, but they were still very delicious and I wouldn't blame the recipe, was probably my error in adding too much.  Try this recipe if you like greek potatoes, as it is spot on.

Excellent! But go real easy on the liquid. I cut the water, olive oil, and lemon juice in half, and it was just perfect. More would have had the potatoes swimming. We're not rosemary fans so I used oregano and a dash each of basil and thyme. I also added a shake of sea salt. This went beautifully with over roasted chicken, and the whole family liked it.

Love this recipe! made it 3 times already and its better than any other greek potatoes that you can buy at a restaurant! Only addition I made to the recipe was par-boiling the potatoes and only cooking them for an hour as I wanted to reduce the cooking time and I feel like they absorb the flavour more. I added some oregano in as well. Other than those slight changes everything else was the same. This comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED its fool proof! it takes so little time to make and the flavour cannot be beat! everyone who tries these LOVES them!

These were really good.  Used stock and added more oregano.  Kept olive oil and lemon.  Served with my tatzikki and marinara pork.  Would make again.  Would  do be great to serve for a big crowd with all Greek food.

I would make these potatoes again, but they are a little bland as written. Like other reviewers I omitted the water and just used enough broth to partially cover the potatoes. Next time I'll increase the spices a bit and add some salt.

I just made this tonight and I followed Donna's instruction (below) but a little different. I used 6 Yukon gold potatoes, and I boiled them (quartered) with one chicken boullion cube and one clove of garlic cut in half. I boiled them until almost done and then transferred the potatoes to a baking dish (9x13). As for the marinade I used JUST 1/3 cup olive oil, microwaved my lemon for 25 seconds (also made a cut in the skin- it came out pretty hot in one spot, be careful) and then zested as much of it as I could and then cut it in half, removed the seeds and squeezed out all of the juice. I decided it needed more lemon juice so I added some from a bottle (about a tablespoon). Then I used 1tsp ground thyme, 1tsp dried rosemary  and half a crushed chicken boullion cube and finally, ground pepper and pink salt to taste. I stirred it good then poured it over my potatoes and stirred them up to coat them. I baked them uncovered for 15mins at 350 then stirred them and then put them back in for another 15mins, until the outsides get a bit crispy :) My fiancé loved them! He says he doesn't care what real Greek potatoes taste like because apparently my version was awesome. Enjoy :)

Delicious! I made some changes - par boiled the potatoes (having cut in to 6 not 4)for about 4 mins and only used 3/4 cup of water. I also added zest of a lemon as previously suggested. After 90 mins, and turning twice they were perfect.

Definitely could have cut down on the water, but other than that this was a pretty good recipe. I had to triple it, as I was having quite a few guests over, and it took just over 2 hours to cook. That was fine with me, as we had appetizers in the meantime, but I can see that amount of time being an issue on other occasions.
The potatoes weren't very lemon-y, actually. I found the rosemary stronger than anything. Some guests mentioned they preferred that, as they didn't like too much lemon flavouring on potatoes. But to be honest I would have preferred a more strong lemon taste. Probably just a personal preference.
Taking one star off for the amount of time it takes and the crazy amount of water.

Just like at a Greek restaurant! :) My tummy was happy after eating this. If you prefer your potatoes to be less dry though, I'd recommend adding more liquids.

So good!  I too boiled my potato wedges in some vegetable/lemon broth before putting them into the oven to bake.  I kept the lemon juice in the dressing and it turned out AMAZING!  Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

These were really yummy. I didn't have 2+ hours though, so I boiled in broth with garlic and then tossed in a lot of lemon juice, Greek seasoning, oregano, salt and pepper, thyme and rosemary. Baked at 350 for about 30 minutes, turning once! Delish! Hubby loved them, will try the original way next time when I have more time! Thanks! :)

I made the potatoes almost as per the recipe.  After reading the reviews, I tweaked a little.  Used 6 yukon gold potatoes.  Only 1 cup of veggie stock.  More oregano and lemon then it called for and less olive oil.  When they first came out oven I found them bland and just WRONG!  And I 'm a pretty good cook so was really disappointed.  They were too hot to throw out so I stashed them in the fridge till morning.  I told my husband about the disaster and I that I was going to trow them out.  He was said no!  You aren't finished with them yet!  He suggested that I pan fry them with some of the pan juice like they do at our favorite greek place.  OMG!  The most outstanding potato ever!  I will absolutely make these again!  If think you must refrigerate overnight in order to prevent over cooking.  They were cold through so when put them in the hot pan they crisped beautifully without becoming soggy!  YUMMY!

Delicious! Tasted just like the ones in a Greek restaurant. I used just oregano instead of the rosemary and thyme (not a fan of thyme) and they tasted just right. Would certainly make again. Very easy too. Thanks for the recipe.

On the weeknights, I do not have 2 1/2 hours to get dinner on the table. I read a good deal of the reviews and I decided to boil my potatoes in chicken stock first to speed up the cooking time and also to add more flavor. By doing that, I obviously had to cut way back on oil and the water but I left everything else the same. These were simple to prepare and paired nicely with my Greek Marinated Kabobs from this site. Thanks for sharing!

I used bottled lemon juice and used a bit more than the recipe suggested and got very lemony potatoes. I also cooked mine in the microwave which took about 25 mins. I also found there was too much liquid but with a bit of velour in I turned the extra into a lemon sauce to go with the chicken which was wonderful. I also added an out 2 tsp of honey just to sweeten them up a little

I recommend to everyone to read reviews before you begin :) I didn't have enough time to cook these potatoes for 2 hours, so I used only about 1/2 cup of water and a little extra lemon juice and turned the temp up to 400 degrees right away and they were done in 45 min. I just stirred and turned the potatoes every 15 min. They were delicious, another keeper. I think next time I will follow one reviewers advice and partially cook the potatoes first by boiling them in chicken broth and lemon mixuture, then bake the rest of the way in the oven.

Very flavorful, moist, and delicious. Never had Greek potatoes, so didn't know what to expect. I followed the ingredients exactly, but microwaved the potatoes first, kept skins on, then cut in 8ths, then cooked covered at 400 for about 40 minutes. Hubby didn't care for the lemon taste, but everyone else gobbled them up! If you like lemon and savory together, then this recipe is a winner!

Made these exactly as the recipe said, except for i drained the oil a little at the end and put it back in. These are so tasty, and although a little time consuming EXTREMELY worth it.

These had a nice Greek flavor however mine only took about an hour to cook probably because I cut them in eighths instead of quarters also if I make again I think I will try boiling the water and dissolving the bouillon cube first... I ended up crushing them and just mixing them in... All in all not bad if you are a fan of Greek seasoned potatoes

What a great recipe! I tweaked a few things and I thought it came out perfect. I cut the water to 1 cup, upped the lemon juice to 1/2 cup. I added an extra clove of garlic and covered the top of the potatoes with rosemary. I cooked it for 1 1/2 hours and added feta cheese on top before broiling the potatoes. Soooo good!

They were good, but nothing spectacular. Maybe increasing the lemon or using some of the zest would give them that extra something.

Wonderful! Made these last night with turkey feta burgers and they were delicious. I used a little less liquid based on other comments and three sprigs of fresh rosemary since I had it. I baked them for an hour covered and then uncovered for the final 30 minutes. Better than Greek restaurants, according to my husband and daughter!

OPA!  Fabulous potatoes.  Tasted really authentic.  I was worried that there was too much liquid, but it soaked right in.  BEAUTIFUL and easy side dish.

These were really, really yummy and tasted just like the ones we've had at our favorite Greek restaurant.  I doubled the amount of lemon and bouillion but kept the same amount of water, I thought it was good to have lots of liquid for the potatoes to "braise" in.  Served with tofu broccoli quiche, salad, muffins and yogurt parfaits for a wonderful mother's day brunch.  Thanks for the recipe!!

These were delicious and received good reviews from my dinner guests (which included some picky eaters). I did not have rosemary so I used Italian seasoning.

I was very excited to try these because I am a huge lover of greek style potatoes. Unfortunately, this recipe doesn`t even come close. I have to say that I was disappointed in the strong lemon taste. Now, if you are a person that really loves lemon, these potatoes would be a sure thing. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Even though these potatoes weren`t quite what I was looking for, I can say that they do hold much flavor and smell fantastic while baking in the oven. Thanks again!

Great recipe! Thank YOU! I see some left negative reviews, and I know everyone has different taste so that's to be expected! We LOVE "potatoey" potatoes, and I guess potatoes are a little bland in themselves, but that's why we like them. (that's what spices are used for!). I love this recipe and find it very versatile, if I'm in the mood for one flavor over the other, I add more of that. If I don't have 2 hours to wait, I soften the taters up first, if I want them a little crispy on the edges, stir a little oil in at the end... either way... I was happy to find this recipe!

They were ok...too much lemon and too much liquid.  If I make them again I won't use lemon and much less liquid...like a 1/4 cup.   Too tart for my taste.

Maybe these just weren't my taste, but I did not like these at all.  I thought the rosemary was way too strong and there was way too much liquid.  I'm giving 2 stars because my family didn't complain about eating them, but they didn't rave about them either.  We pretty much all agreed they had a very "different" flavor...not the "different" that I was looking for though.

This recipie has all the right ingredients but tastes better when prepared differently. I boiled the potatoes in chicken stock, lemon, and some of the thyme (didn't have any rosemary left) until the potatoes were just tender. Then I drained them and while they were still hot I poured on the oil and garlic with some salt and pepper too. Tossed them around and then put them on a sheet and broiled them until nice and golden. Super flavours!

These were pretty good. The portions are huge. I think this is more like 6 servings. I liked the flavours very well, but I would have liked it if more of the liquid had cooked away and the potatoes had browned a bit. Next time I will leave the cover off the dish the whole time and see if that helps. Thanks!

This was great, but I may have used too much olive oil.  The potatoes were swimming around.  I also stuck mine under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the potatoes a little.  This is a great recipe.  Thanks!

Very Good!  I have been trying to find a recipe for these potatoes ever since I first tried them in the restaurant.  This was just as good.  I did cut the liquid down and I never covered them at all.  Added seasoning salt.  A definate "Let's have that again"

Very different taste. I only made 1/2 of the original recipe so I ended using only 1/4 tsp of rosemary. Next time, I might use just a dash of rosemary since I'm not a big fan.

I used 3 Idaho potatoes for 2 people. Adjusted the water to 2/3 cup instead of 3/4 and only 2 TB olive oil per other posters. I used bottled lemon juice and oregano instead of thyme. I cut the potatoes length wise. The first hour and a half I had the lid on. The last half hour I had the lid off. I liked the browned look but I would stick to the original measurements of oil and water because the bottom of the potatoes stuck to the pyrex. I should Pam spray it too and be sure to mix it more otherwise the spices stay on the bottom. Definitely a keeper.

These were pretty good, but not EXACTLY what I was hoping for. I would cut the oil in half; if you'd believe, it was overpowering. I'd add more lemon and maybe some oregano. I did cook for 2 hours because I had the time, but I'm sure shortcuts could be made here.

Excellent.  Didn't change a thing.  These potatoes are requested quite often at home.

I made these with a Greek Stew that I found on another website.  They were absolutely delicious!  I did not have any thyme, so I just used rosemary, and I did add more lemon. Will definitely make these again.

These were Ok for us but not great.  I must say first though, I've never had a "Greek" potato.  The flavor was very mild.  We could barely taste the lemon or herbs.  But with the mildness it was pleasant.  I would definitely cut down the cooking time to about 1hr. 10 min.  Otherwise ours were a mit mushy.  Liked, will try again but with thise modifications.  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved these!  We had them with the Greek Bifteki burger as another reviewer recommended.  The only change I made to the recipe was to swap out the thyme for oregano.

These potatoes were delicious!  The flavor was very full, which is hard to get with potatoes sometimes.  I used only 1/2 cup of water and cooked them uncovered at the end because I wanted them a bit brown.  I know it is not the Greek way!!

Pretty good recipe, although I made several changes: I cut the potatoes into bite size pieces for a quicker cook time. I used low sodium chicken broth in lieu of the bouillon cube and water. I added oregano. I also used lime juice instead of lemon.

To me the rosemary completely overpowered the other spices to the point of not being able to taste them. I will try them again with less rosemary and possibly some basil to help add more flavoring. I did follow the recipe as written, but it just wasn't right for our tastebuds.

WOW! We really liked this.  I only used 3/4 cup water,added a small amount of lemon zest,doubled the garlic and I used garlic infused olive oil.  This was awesome. Will make (many times) again.  Thanks for a fab potato...

This dish has a wonderful texture. It was easy to prepare. I think next time I will increase the flavors, as mine seemed a little bland, but still delish.

Probabyly the best roast potato I've ever had.  Though I did not add the rosemary because I just don't like it.  I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  Absolutely fantastic.  There were none left on the tray after dinner.

Not much flavor...I was hoping for a more "lemony" taste, and I even added EXTRA lemon juice.  My potatoes were still firm after 2 hours in the oven.

This recipe is a good start. Although my family enjoyed these, I would double or triple the fresh lemon juice and garlic. The other reviewers suggestion of less olive oil is a good one. Will try again and attempt for more lemon flavour - maybe some fresh squeezed right before serving. That would help. Going to fry some up for breakfast and see how what kind of leftovers they make.

Made 16 servings of this recipe for Easter dinner. Per previous advice, cut the water in half and did not use quite as much lemon as suggested and added oregano. Took longer to cook and I had to uncover after about an hour becuase of so much liquid. However, they were a hit with my family and everyone was asking what was in them!

We thought these were great!  I made it just like was called for except for adding a little oregano.  We just scooped the potatoes out of the liquid before serving them.  Even my 2 year olds liked them.  We will make again!

these were very good. I followed the recipe exactly and they tasted just how  I was hoping they would.  I served them with chicken souvlaki, peppy's pitas from this site  rice pilaf, and  tsaziki sauce. Will deffinately be making again.

I just found the lemon overpowering. I think the method of cooking, in broth and olive oil and spices, is probably a good idea. I may try again with either no lemon, or half the amount called for.

I scaled this recipe down to serve two people, then cut the water down slightly due to other reviews.  Luckily I checked on them after 1 hour, all the liquid had evaporated and the potatoes were sticking to the bottom of the baking dish.  I also put in a sprig of fresh rosemary and oregano with the thyme.  All in all very tasty and not too lemony at all.  Served with greek style lamb cutlets and steamed asparagus.  Will try these again with more water or lower oven temp. Thanks for the recipe Cathie.

Love this recipe!  My husband and family like these better than those served at the Greek Restaurants.  There cooking time is long, but the prep is easy and it is well worth the wait.
Thank you Cathie for posting this one.

This recipe was almost bang on to the greek potatoes I got on the Danforth as a kid. Next time, I might try the pinch of oregano as other's mentioned to see if it makes it exact. This was excellent.

My husband absolutely went crazy on this potatoes. I customized the recipe for 6 services which increased the water to 2 1/4 cups and then I  saved about 1/2-3/4 cup of the water to add slowly during the cooking time. I cooked them on the grill covered for about 2/3 of the time and then uncovered them to allow them to get a little cripspy.I also added more garlic. This recipe is definitely being added to my permanent file.....

Great easy recipe. I added oregano as readers suggested & wished I hadn't, leave the recipe as is! I used vegetable broth instead (more like one cup) & didn't bother turning the potatoes.

This is my favorite potato recipe!  It tastes great with sauteed or caramelized onions, served either on the side or stirred into the potatoes.  I've even made the recipe without bouillon a few times, adding just a little salt to the water, and it doesn't compromise the taste much at all.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Very tasty... so much so that my 17 month old who hates potatoes loved them!  I do agree with another reviewer, however, that it could have used a little more lemon, and did benefit from a little oregano (I used one teaspoon).

This came out really badly.  Instead of 2 hours, after 45 minutes the potatoes were all "disintegrated" in the sauce.  Not what I was expecting at all.

These potatoes were fantastic - even as leftovers! We matched them with a roasted lamb rack and broccoli which was yummy. I'd use fairly large potatoes - people will probably eat more than they would usually.

I tried these potatoes tonight, and they turned out really good. I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water and bouillon, added a little crushed garlic and only used about 2 tbsp of olive oil. They went perfect with Chicken Souvalaki and Greek salad! I will be making these again!!

We LOVE Greek food in our house, and ever so often I get the craving for Greek potatoes.  Sad to say, these aren't exactly what my taste buds were missing.  These were WAY too lemony, and sour!!!  If I make these again I'll cut back on the lemon juice, and perhaps add more bouillion or chicken stock.  Also, don't forget to add oregano.   (Sigh) Oh how I miss not being close to a good Greek restaurant!

These were easy to make and tasted pretty good. They still didn't taste as good as the ones I can get at the local Greek restaurant though.  Definitely better than boring old boiled potatoes.  Couldn't get my 3 year old to eat them but that's okay - she doesn't like potatoes anyway.  Will make them again. Thanks Cathie!

We really enjoyed this recipe. It's great re-heated to!  If you have extra of the liquid, it's great on salad as well!

We really liked these potatoes as a change from noodles with chicken parmesan.  My husband doesn't normally care for potatoes, but he liked these.
