I decided to disregard a review that told me nothing (Not good, wasn't working...  Because...??  What's the point?), tried it and it worked great for me in particular!  I've made it many times, always testing as I go and depending on my mood, I adjust the heat by using "mild/medium or hot" salsa which is key to if it would be bland or spicy, those spices count.  Great technique for me so I can keep dried beans stored yet still get a fix for a sudden craving!  It's a technique with dried beans you could use in many more circumstances.  I just cooked until thick - on my particular stove, that was 20 minutes.  As many stoves, salsas and beans and quality of spices as there are in the world, try to be fair or informative regarding recipes.

This recipe is awesome.  I am a bit of a salt aholic so I doubled the salt.  After tasting this the first time I decided I wanted to have this on hand.  I made a bulk batch, here it is:  (9 cups of bean flour, 3 TBSP salt(I used 6), 3 TBSP ground cumin and 3 TBSP chili powder. Stir until well blended and store.  Preparation instructions: place 1 1/2 cup bean flour and 3 1/4 cups of water into a medium sauce pan.  Bring mixture to a boil over medium heat and cook until thick about 15 minutes.  When desired consistency remove from heat and add 1 cup salsa, stir and serve.  Yield approx 3 cups.  When I use this to make bean dip, I also chop up pickled jalapenos into it as well as a little of the jalapeno juice.  Yummy!  Thank you so much for this time saving, tasty recipe.

I was just looking at the recipes for refried beans a little amused at the thought of a recipe for this. I always thought everyone knew how to make refried beans. I have to admit I have found some new ideas I hadn't thought of before. Then I found this particular recipe. I was so excited I had to try it out right away never mind that dinner is already done and eaten. I am truly hoping that this will turn out great. It would be great when I am short on beans and someone drops in. If it turns out I will be sure to share it with all of my friends and relatives. Although the beans are not done yet they are not grainy. I think the problem for the cook who said the beans just would not get done is old beans. Old beans will not cook up well. Try buying the beans at a store that has a high turnover rate.An area with a high Mexican population would be good especially at a Mexican store. They turned out great. I will definitly use this again. Try adding a small amount of garlic and onion for even more flavor.

A little soupy for burritos, but a little more bean flour should thicken it up fine. Added a little extra salt and a little pepper and this tasted great. I like refried beans, but not all the fat that goes along with them. This is a great tasting alternative. Try melting some cheese in the original recipe and you would have a great chip dip!

I don't know exactly what happened, but it did not turn out.  It was tasty, but after an hour of simmering, it was still grittily undercooked.  I can only think of two reasons why it didn't turn out:                                    1)  I did not grind the beans finely enough
2)  I added the salt with all of the other ingredients.  I had heard not to do it in previous recipes...

I have a *ton* of beans and probably will try it again, only with the changes.

A nice substitue for the real thing, the kids don't know the difference.  I would use a little less cumin next time (1/4 tsp), just for our taste preferences, but over all a fast and easy way to use those dried beans.

It was quite different than canned, but it worked well. I cooked mine much less than fifteen minutes - it was already quite thick after only a few minutes. Kinda funny - I used black beans and with the salsa added, my refried beans were purple! :-)

Not Good.  Half way through preparing dinner I realized that the beans were not working and sent my son to the store for a can of refried beans.  I do not recommend this recipe.

quick, easy and yummy recipe that lets you control the nutritional value of the dish.  Canned beans contain salt and lard - this recipe makes "refried" beans in a jiffy.  I add minced onion, cumin, and a can of green chilis when I make them.  Thanks for the recipe ACHOCOCAT!

I wanted to like this recipe because it is so easy.  It's edible, and maybe a little better than canned, but by no means tasty.

I thought the idea would be a great shortcut to making refried beans, but it turned out pasty, plain and really awful tasting.  I would rather use canned pinto beans and if I didn't have them on hand, too bad.

My family LOVED this recipe! I would suggest to grind up the beans as fine as possible. I personally used my coffee grinder and it worked great!!! It was a wonderful dip and was soooo yummy on our soft tacos. I can't wait to take this to a family dinner! Thank you!!

Very good, but instead of putting dried beans in the food processor, I added cooked pinto beans and just doubled the amount called for in the recipe. My 18-month-old nephew loves them!

The beans came out crunchy and had a strange consistency.  I liked the idea, but next time I will do them the long way.

I have to be honest...it looks like baby food.  BUT...it has a really good taste. For a shortcut recipe, I would make them again.  I had a problem with them being chunky, but I put them in the grinder after cooking for a while and they turned out alot better.  I also added a bit more seasoning.  Thanks!

I tried this recipe, but due to lack of a couple of the ingredients I omitted or substituted them.
I used the beans, ground then up in my processor, and because I doubled the recipe, I used a teaspoon of salt and of chili seasoning along with five cups of water.
Because of the amount of water it took well over an hour to boil down.
All things considered it turned out very good.
I don’t usually like refried beans, too many years working next to Rosarita Factory. But my husband said these are great.

The method certainly works but the outcome was grainy refried beans.

I forgot to soak my beans so I decided to give this a try because I really didn't want to used canned.  Next time, I'll go get canned.  I ground up my beans in a Ninja until they were almost powder.  My beans came out looking like oatmeal.  I added more water and cooked longer to no avail.  I finally put the cooked beans back into the food processor for another whirl since they were softer but that didn't help either.  These came out gritty.  My boyfriend raves about everything I cook even when I don't think it turned out so well.  Neither of us finished our servings.  It was like eating refried beans mixed with sand.  Not a good combo.

I made this according to the directions and was not impressed with how it turned out. The beans, although ground, were still crunchy after 25 minutes. They also had almost no flavor. It was slightly better after adding salsa, but I doubt I would make this again.

I didn't have time to use dried beans so I just used canned pinto beans instead. As is, the recipe is very basic and bland. But it did give me the starting point. I added minced garlic and minced onion as well for added flavor. It was a bit watery ((as I did not drain the beans)) but I simmered them with the seasonings and drained a bit before mashing them. I think they turned out just fine. My husband asked if I did something different but didn't explain any further....good "in a pinch" recipe.

I initially had problems with the beans not thickening enough and been extremely gritty. One of the helpful reviews mentioned the possibility of old beans and/or a bad grind being the culprit for those of us with this problem. I’m guilty on both counts. I added a little cornstarch to thicken a little more, then but it in a blender. I got good results doing this. An immersion blender would probably be better, but I have to work with what is on hand. I will probably make these again. This was an impulse dish. I don’t eat beans enough to go hunting for fresh beans or to have them cook all day so this is a good recipe I just need to throw them in a blender after they have cooked 15 min.

I used the "flat" blade on the magic Bullet for about 40 seconds, the same blade I use to grind coffee beans.  Next time will do it in two batches which might give it even more fineness.  I used a small, heavy stainless steal pan for cooking and, while waiting for it to boil, it began to stick to the bottom, not sure if it was the bean "flour" or spices.  Persistent stirring loosened it all and it quickly thickened more.  I dutifully stirred it, turned the heat to "warm" and left it lidded to sit.  Adjusted the seasonings to a bit more salt.  Might grate some onion into it to cook or use onion powder next time.  When dipped and hot it was outstanding!  When eating it with a fork as plain re-fried beans there was a tiny bit of "crunchiness", interesting, just not all soft.  I was out of cheese which could only improve it.  I REALLY like the idea of the quickness.  Making re-fried beans in a slow cooker takes about 6 hours or overnight with mashing for almost similar results.

I just doubled the spice, added garlic and onion powder...didn't add salsa and I may use butter  next  time to cut down on the gummy effect once it starts to cool...(maybe that's why you should add salsa but that seemed unappealing to me) otherwise I plan to make this again!
