Iâ€™m always looking for summer drinks for friends when they visit my garden.  The freshness of the strawberries are the highlight of this drink.  Depending on how sweet your strawberries are, you may need to add more sugar.  Be sure to use fresh lime juice.  It is very refreshing on a hot summer day.

Perfect for drinking on the patio on a hot summer night. I made as directed, but eyeballed my rum and was a little heavy-handed pouring it in. The flavor was still great and really forgiving of the large amount of booze. Not too sweet, just right.

I made it originally just as the recipe was written, but it wasn't sweet enough me, so i added more sugar to taste.  The recipe was good and I'll make it again

I liked it a lot. To my taste it required a little less of lime and more sugar. YMMV

I think you need more sugar than this called for, I didn't like how sour it was. I added 2 TBSP of sugar  (for 2 servings) and that did it!

I didn't have any triple sec, but still enjoyed this with an extra teaspoon of powdered sugar.  I'd cut back on the lime juice a bit.
