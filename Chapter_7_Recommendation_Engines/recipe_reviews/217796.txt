A great concept that I think got carried away with too many ingredients. Loved the combo of asparagus, red pepper & red onion but the parmesan wasn't really needed and overpowered & almost completely hid the balsamic vinegar.

I love finding new veggie combinations and this was a yummy new take on asparagus.  I'll definitely be making again, exactly as written.

Yum Yum Yummy!!!  I used a whole bunch of asparagus, 6 small shallots instead of red onion, no pine nuts and no cheese.  I kept everything else the same.  I thought this was delicious!  Even my husband liked it and it is almost impossible to get him to eat veggies!  Thanks for sharing!

This was one of the best recipes I have made from this website!  The only thing I changed was that I added some fresh garlic to it.  Thank you so much for the awesome dish!

I made this as a side dish for baked chicken tonight.  It turned out excellent.   I browned the pine nuts in butter prior to adding them to the mix and I used sweet peppers instead of a bell pepper.

I added a large handful of mushrooms and no seeds or nuts.  I loved the vinegar and parmesan! It was a great side to steak.

Made this and left out the balsamic vinegar and added a little red pepper flakes for spice. Turned out great!

Delicious!  Be careful not to over cook the asparagus!  Check it regularly for tenderness.   I also opted to do a light sprinkling of Parmesan over the finished product, rather than dumping a quarter cup onto it.

Really great! Asparagus, red onion, red pepper and pine nuts are a great combination!
However, I found the butter a little unnecessary. To make it a little healthier I will probably half the butter or skip it all together. That way the marinade would just be olive oil and balsamic! :)

Delicious, colorful, and quick. I don't like onions so I omitted them. I love using the new robusto style olive oil. And i never have pine nuts on hand, so I sub chopped walnuts. One chopping board and one pan, so easy to clean up. Enjoy!

This was absolutely delicious! I did not include the sesame seeds or pine nuts, but I don't feel that I missed anything by omitting them.
