I'm giving this a 5 for it's simplicity and taste. This just takes a minute to whip up and tastes great over a bed of rice. As always there's a few folks here who reviewed the recipe and changed things up, I don't recomend that with this recipe. We found it to be just a fine stand alone recipe. Top drawer 'ol boy, top drawer.

I'm cajun, so I loved it.  My fiance's parent's are Colombian and Panamanian and they loved it also.  Gonna try with catfish next time.  I would use less fish though, I used two pounds of filet meat and it was way more than enough for a 9x13 dish, too much really.

This is a really flavorful, easy, and versatile recipe that my family loved.  I didn't have any stewed tomatoes so I used salsa instead.  It added a nice zing.  I changed the portions to 3 to fit the 1 lb. of fish I had but I did double the sauce ingredients.  I'll try this again and am planning on adapting it to a one dish meal with rice.

Fantastic! I read the other reviews and decided to follow the recipe.  I did, however, add a small layer of steamed rice below the fish and the topping. I highly recommend this wonderful dish!

I don't know what gave it that flavor but it was so bitter. I won't be making this again.

great recipe, my boyfriend loved it. I had to reduce the proportions for just the two of us (plus leftovers) but I doubled the spices because it didn't seem like enough to flavor a whole can of tomatoes. Turned out amazing...served over rice with asperagus. Will definately make again!

I really liked the thick sauce (lessened tomato juice as suggested) but unfortunately it didn't soak into the fish so well. But try frying the leftovers for that and you're in business.

Husband loved it! Used fresh herbs and a little extra. I think I will try cooking the rice with it next time to soak up some of the extra juice.

Excellent recipe.  But all I had was a small jar of Bruschetta and a can of tomato sauce so that is what I used in place of stewed tomatoes...very tasty and pretty, too!  thank you!

Different reviews at my house. My husband said it wasn't too bad, my five year old liked it, my 1 year old ate it, but I thought it was awful. I don't even know what I would do different to enhance/ better the recipe so I will just discard it.

I've been making this dish for years. Our favorite is with shrimp added to the sauce at the end.  Give them 5 mins and it's ready.  Served over rice with garlic bread and a salad. Finest kind.
Best to make a large pot, everyone will want seconds.

It was ok. With the roux and the flavor bases, I expected better. I wouldn't make it again.

Thank you for posting this!  I think it's great!  Of course, I wasn't satisfied until I added some Cajun seasoning and more salt, but everyone likes to season things to their own taste.  I also squeezed the juice of a lemon in it.  This was the best I've had, next to my dad's, but he used to cook it on the barbecue pit, with big slices of onions and lemons on it.  I don't remember everything he did, but this will more than make due.  I will use this recipe again next time.

This was very good. I made it almost exactly as written. The sauce had such a unique flavor. I served it with Sarah's Rice Pilaf and broccoli.
