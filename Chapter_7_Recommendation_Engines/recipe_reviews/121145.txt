I scaled this down to 6 servings to frost "Frosted Cake Brownies," also from this site. I used Bailey's, both in the brownies and in this frosting. I found it needed more milk (or in my case Bailey's) than the recipe called for. What I liked about this recipe after reading it over was the high ratio of butter to sugar compared to similar recipes. Just as expected, it produced a very rich and creamy frosting that did not dry out or harden. Simply perfect on the brownies, and I will go back to it for my next cake too. Thanks Amy!

I'm giving this 5 stars because my only problem with it was it tasted a little too cocoa-y, but that is probably my fault for adding slightly less sugar and not compensating with the amt. of cocoa powder.

I halved the recipe and it was the perfect amt. to ice and fill a 9 inch round cake.  In order to avoid having problems with the cake crumbing or coming apart when you frost, you will need to add more milk than the recipe calls for.  The best way to do this is to add 1T at a time as you are mixing it.  Stop the mixer and take a rubber spatula and spread it around the frosting as though you were spreading it on a cake.  When you pull away the spatula, if it 'sticks' to the frosting and forms very stiff peaks when you pull it away, it is too stiff and you need to add more liquid (but only add a little bit at the time).  You want the consistency to be very smooth and creamy; then it will spread with no problems.  From now on this is the chocolate frosting recipe I will use.

Okay, if you are looking for the ultimate chocolate frosting, this is it! I followed others advice and halved the recipe.  It was the perfect amount to frost a two layer, nine inch cake. (I like a generous amount of frosting.) This is the only frosting I will ever use from now on.

I asked my husband what he wanted me to bake for his birthday- I said I'd make anything- pie, cake, cookies, someother dessert.  He asked for a bowl of this icing.

OMG!  I think my search for the absolute best, most chocolately frosting is over!  This stuff is awesome and so easy to make.  I cut the recipe in half and that was more than enough for a dozen Texas sized cupcakes that were more like mini-cakes in and of themselves but that was OK because I didn't mind getting to taste a bit of it as if I could resist. I used half and half instead of milk and added just a bit more of that until I got the right consistency.  Great recipe!

I have used this recipe twice now and it has come out PERFECTLY every time.  
I used it to frost a 2 layer chocolate cake with a strawberry layer in the middle with chocolate strawberries on top.  Be sure to adjust the above recipe with your cake.  I halved the recipe and still had enough frosting left over to put away for  12 cupcakes.
Be sure to smooth the lumps out of your confectioners sugar!  ALSO- I reduced the amount of sugar so it would not be so sweet.  I use 2 cups in a halved recipe instead of 2.5 I also use SALTED butter.

I gave this recipe 5 stars although I did alter it slightly.  I have a small cupcake business that I operate from my home.  I have experimented with endless frosting recipes trying to find the right mix and have discovered the following formula works best for me - for every 1 cup butter add 3 cups icing sugar.  In doing this you will notice that the icing isn't sickly sweet, like burning in the back of your throat kind of sickly sweet when there is too much icing sugar in a frosting recipe.  This formula works perfectly for me and my customers love it.  I constantly get comments on how delicious my frosting is and not overly sweet. Another thing you will find when you reduce the ratio of icing sugar to butter is that your frosting will no longer crust over.  That used to happen to me all the time and I didn't know why.  The reason why is that the sugar content in most frosting recipes is too high in relation to the amount of butter used.  1 part butter to 3 parts icing sugar is perfect.  Not sickly sweet and no crusting over.  Beautiful and delicious!!!

This is a great chocolate frosting- I didn't find it too sweet and turns out nice and fluffy, both great things when you are piling it on cupcakes. My advice is to make this a night ahead and fridge it so the cocoa flavor can really mellow and the flavors can come together- but be sure to remove it from the fridge at least a half hour before using because its pretty hard otherwise. Also, half the recipe made a ton!

My family of chocoholics really enjoyed this frosting on a Duncan Hines Butter Recipe cake.  Yummmm!  It has a very distinctive cocoa taste, but that's what we like.  I also really liked the texture. I scaled the recipe to work with 2.5 cups of powdered sugar (that's all I had) and it was sufficient for a 9x13 cake.  Since the frosting is so rich, you don't need to go overboard on it.  Oh, one last thing, I didn't have real butter so I substituted Land of Lakes margarine and it was just fine.  Perhaps I'll try real butter next time just to see what the difference is, but don't let the fact that you don't have real butter on hand keep you from trying this recipe.  We thought it was great!

I am trying many different chocolate frosting recipes for a cake I am making for work.  So far, this one is my favorite. It is rich and creamy, not too sweet, has just the right amount of chocolate flavor, and the butter flavor is fantastic.  The only thing I don't like is the color.  It is just too light.  The flavor more than makes up for that though!

Great recipe I'm giving only 4 stars due to having to half the recipe.  Although it is great to also know the larger amount for when my 4 kids need cakes for cake walks and school activities.  I make a cake and chocolate frosting that my family says is better then Hershey's Black Magic cake. My oddest daughter told me that a fudge-ier frosting would be even better for MY cake.  SO when looking for a chocolate fudge frosting I found this one.  After halving it I am VERY Happy with it!  Can use 2%,whole milk, almond milk, heavy cream, 1/2 & 1/2, or buttermilk and either regular or dark cocoa powder.  You can also add the following to change up the style of choco-frosting. 1/4tsp mint, raspberry, or orange extract (with the vanilla), 1/2 CUP creamy PB, 1TBSP strong brewed coffee,  1/2 CUP chopped Andes/York mint chocolate chopped or nuts chopped, or fold in very firm fresh chopped strawberries just before spreading onto the cake. Although, I do suggest sifting the dry ingredients before adding to the butter.

Oh wow! I never like homemade chocolate frosting becuase it's just not chocolaty enough. This was sooo good! I used Ghirardelli Premium Baking Cocoa and only made 1/2 the batch for my cupcakes. I didn't use quite the full amount of milk since I wanted to decorate w/ it. I also added 1/4 cup of Mocha Almond Fudge International Delight liquid creamer. (I've made it w/o and it's just as good!)OH my goodness! The more you beat this, the creamier it gets and also increases in volume. This is also a nice crusting recipe. (Forms a crust when left out to sit but stays soft on the inside.) Cover when not using to prevent a crust from forming. :)

Scaled down the recipe in half. I don't like chocolate flavor so heavy so I cut cocoa in half. A pinch of salt brings out the yum factor. I beat the frosting in my heavy stand mixer for about 3 or 4 minutes to make very creamy. With these changes this is my family's favorite chocolate frosting. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Creamy and delicious with just the right amount of chocolaty-ness.  This recipe makes enough to generously frost two batches of cupcakes (i.e., 4 dozen).  I made a batch of cupcakes today and will refrigerate the rest of the frosting for another batch next weekend.  I better hide it from myself; I know I'll be tempted to take a taste now and then.

I consider myself a pretty serious baker and I was nervous to try this recipe because of the cocoa, I wasn't sure that it would be good enough.  I was so totally wrong!  This icing is SOOO easy and really tastes amazing!!  I didn't really change anything, but I did sift the cocoa because I was afraid it would stay lumpy and someone would get a blob of cocoa.  Because of all the powder (cocoa and confectioners) beware, this totally is a mess.  Use your splatter guard for sure if you have one.  Also, obviously, this makes a TON.  I heavily iced 36 cupcakes and had about 2 cups left (maybe slightly less) which I gave away because I wasn't sure if you could freeze it because of the milk?  In any case, this recipe is definitely a keeper.  TRY IT!!!!

I use this recipe a lot, it's almost perfect. I do use only a third or so of the sugar called for. I sift my sugar and cocoa over my butter , starting with about 2 1/2 cups of sugar. Once it starts to look right I add my vanilla and just a splash at a time of milk until it's spreadable. I usually only need about a half a cup of sugar more and it's heaven! It's fool proof and the best frosting I've found and it's just a few, simple ingredients. There's just way too much sugar as written. This time I cut the recipe down by a quarter and it was enough for a generously frosted 2 layer cake.

Talk about rich! wooziers, I've harped before about not being able to make frostings with butter due to the area I was living in & that's true, with Oklahoma's humidity, I couldn't make a frosting that was butter based because it would be come oily & flat, if I dared leave it out on the counter or travel with the frosting anywhere. So being that I'm now in Oregon. I needed a frosting that was rich as it sounded & light n' fluffy & could easily hold up to the moisture & humidity in the area in which I live. This was the 1st butter based recipe I've tried in a very long time & me likie! I was concerned with the high amount of baking cocoa because I don't like that chalk like residue left behind & this recipe was fabulous, it didn't flatten, it set nicely & didn't have the residue left behind like other recipes have before. I sifted my cocoa & confectioner's sugar together prior to mixing it in, to make sure it was overall well blended. I also grabbed the whipping cream in place of the milk out of pure habit, not realizing until half a cup was already in the mixture when I looked down. I actually won't change that either. Instead of replacing the milk mid way, I chose to just keep with the heavy whipping cream. It build a nice fluff and body to recipes verses milk and I don't think I'll go to using regular milk the next time I make this, because there WILL be a next time. I loved the end result, it worked well with topping a cake and a batch of brownies. TY

It was a good flavor but had a gritty taste of the cocoa powder.  It seems as though the powder should have been added in with water or something to take away the grit.  I followed the directions exactly so I am not sure what happened.  A friend thinks it was because there isn't any crisco in it but not sure that would have helped.

Yum! This frosting is to die for. Made it to go with chocolate chip cookie dough cupcakes and it was the perfect match! I think I forgot to add the vanilla extract but it was still delicious! Easy to pipe onto the cupcakes and even after two days tasted fresh! Hardens a little too so it's not so easily ruined. Definitely going into my recipe book.

We loved the recipe, but we cut the serving down to 12 and added 1/2 cup of melted semi-sweet chocolate chips for a fudgy indulgence!

This frosting was perfect in texture and taste, and it was even better the day after! I halved the recipe as well, and it was plenty. Thanks for sharing!

Even though I made some slight adjustments, I am giving this recipe a 5. Like all recipes, the chef should adjust the amount of certain ingredients to suit their personal tastes. I halved this recipe since I was only frosting a 9" two tier cake. I also substituted the baking cocoa with Imported Dutch Processed Cocoa powder (it has a smoother taste...less powdery and bitter tasting). As I was looking for a creamy chocolate flavor, I used about 3/4 cups of Dutch cocoa; adding it slowly until I achieved the desired chocolate taste.  I did the same with the milk until I reached the desired consistency. This was a great frosting, spread well, held up well and everybody at my New Year's Eve gathering loved it! This is my go-to chocolate frosting recipe.

delicious frosting, and very easy to make. Mine needed some more icing sugar, cuz it came out a little runny, but it all depends on the moisture in the air that day. Nothing that can't be fixed easily! Perfect for decorating and piping on a cake. I scaled it down to 8 servings, and was able to pipe two layers of rosettes and write a happy birthday message on an 8'cake with loooots leftover! I probably could have also filled the cake with the rest of the frosting! Great easy practical recipe. Thank you for sharing!!

I made half the recipe for a layered 9-inch cake and I still had a little leftover. This yields some fantastically flavorful frosting that was nice and creamy. I'm in love. I made along with the One Bowl Chocolate cake from this site and it's a match made in heaven. Thanks!!

This frosting is awesome!  Very chocolatey, but delicious.  It stays creamy, instead of hardening up like some homemade frostings do.  Next time I think I'd add almond extract instead of the vanilla - that would make it even more delicious!

This makes a TON of frosting. I have a KitchenAid stand mixer and it was almost coming out the top by the end of my making this. I was able to frost a 4 layer cake with plenty to spare! The frosting itself is very smooth, rich and creamy...it's to die for!

Fantastic frosting.  I also halved the recipe to cover a double layer 9in round cake.  I accidentally used the 1/3 measuring cup instead of the 1/4 when measuring out the coco powder (so I basically used 1-2/3 cups instead of 1-1/4), and honestly it was still great.  I think I'll keep it that way the next time I make it.

This frosting was excellent.  I halved the recipe and frosted 24 cupcakes heavily!  I think this frosting is best on a chocolate cupcake, because the frosting is so chocolatey that it overpowers the flavor of the cake.  I used it on yellow cake, and I ended up scraping off most of the frosting so I could taste the actual cake.  Still, the frosting itself is wonderful.

I halved this recipe and it turned out nice.  It looks beautiful and spreads nicely.  I wanted a richer flavor.  I know this sounds crazy considering the butter and amount of chocolate, but it not THE recipe.  I'll keep hunting.   I made this to go on a chocolate cake and the birthday girl loved it.

BE CAREFUL! Try this recipe out before you make it for others. The recipe as it stands is so sweet it made my teeth hurt. I don't know how anyone could call this "good" frosting. I halved the amount of confectioners' sugar, cut the baking cocoa by 1/3, and increased the milk (I used half-and-half) by 1/3. It's plenty sweet and on the edge of tasting too "cocoa powdery."  I suppose if you've only ever eaten sickeningly sweet American chocolate, you'll be able to tolerate this recipe without adjustment. For more sophisticated tastes, hold back on the sugar!!!

Very good, creamy frosting.  I would suggest adding the cocoa powder a little at a time - I only used half of the suggested amount and the frosting was plenty rich.

I will echo the good reviews, I just wanted to add that you can use this recipe as a base for really any flavor, not JUST chocolate. The first time I made it, I tasted it before adding the cocoa (I don't like chocolate, but I was baking for a friend, and so wanted to make sure it was good), and it was divine. You could leave it plain for a buttercream, or add another flavor. Tonight I'm making strawberry cupcakes, so I might add some strawberry extract to it.

Nice icing to work with. Had no problems putting it together... just followed the directions. I did end up adding about 2 Tbs milk to get it to the Constancy  that I was looking for. Made just half the recipe for just the outsides of a 3 layer, 9" cake and had about a cup left over. This already went into my recipe box for future cakes!***UPDATE*** This with the "Black Magic Cake" made a dessert that was that was to die for! Perfect combination with a cream cheese filling in between the layers.. Mmmmm!!

I scaled this down a lot to frost cupcakes. I sifted the powdered sugar and cocoa into the creamed butter. I found this frosting easy to beat together with a nice consistency. The texture was noticeably smooth, fluffy and held up nicely when piping onto to the cupcakes. It has a creamy, rich, chocolate-y flavor while not overly sweet. This frosting was easy to pipe onto the cupcakes. I was able to add garnishes on top of the frosting without it sinking or melting. This paired perfectly with “Peanut Butter Cupcakes,” from this website. This is a great frosting recipe and one I will keep in mind to use again for other desserts.

This is delicious! I used half of the recipe to do a two layer chocolate cake. I did use a little more milk. I made this with the Black Magic Cake. It was an awesome combination! The cake tastes better if you let it sit overnight! Amazing!!!

recipe is extremely chocolaty and creamy. I made half the recipe which was enough, but I did add the 1/2 cup of milk to create more of a smooth and creamy and not so dry frosting. It was yummy!

Good frosting recipe and simple! Mine came out too thin to frost cupcakes, I think the milk was too much.  BUt I just added more sugar and cocoa powder. My butter also was too soft, which made it break down too much as it was beating.  Next time Ill make sure its still firm but soft.  Good recipe, Ill make again.  THanks!

Very good recipe!  I have made this several times and it really does make a huge amount.  I used one-fourth of a recip and easily frosted 8 cupcakes plus most of a 9X9 square cake.  Also have made it with almond milk and extract for a nice subtle chocolate-almond flavor.

excellent frosting. It makes to much so I decreased it to half and it was plenty for a 2 layer cake plus had some still left over. Would be best though if put in the fridge after the cake was frosted. Got alittle soft sitting on the counter for a few hours.

This frosting is RICH, but it is sooo good, definitely for chocolate lovers! It does taste somewhat cocoa-ey, but I think that's the point. 5 stars!

The only bad thing I can say a bout this is I probably gained ten pounds from going in the refrigerator multiple times to stick my finger in. =P I halved this to go on top of Brooke's Bombshell Brownies, and I had plenty left over for finger-dipping!

OMG. Best frosting that I have ever had! I made this exactly the way the recipe says to. I cut the recipe in half and it covered a 9x13 inch cake perfectly. I put this frosting on a chocolate cake (crazy cake from this website) for my son's 2nd birthday. Hands down, it was the best cake and frosting ever!

Perfect!  There's a lot of powdered sugar/cocoa dust flying around when you make this but its worth the trouble to clean up.   I didn't use quite as much sugar (maybe 8 cups) and I used almond milk since I'm lactose intolerant.  I iced Cream Filled Cupcakes (by Grace W.) which were delicious also.  My husband says its the best cupcake he's ever had - way better than the fancy cupcake store we go to.

Really good frosting - definitely very rich. I cut the recipe in half but next time will probably cut it in 1/3 since I had a lot left over (I generously covered a yellow bundt cake). It took me an additional 10 minutes of just beating it to get the texture smooth (I also added about 1/4 cup more of milk). I will definitely use this recipe again!

Very good.  Might try substituting peppermint extract for the vanilla next time.  Perfect for chocolate cake.  Halved the recipe as suggested and it was plenty for the top of a 9x13 cake.

This is an outstanding, smooth chocolate frosting recipe. I modified the servings to 16 (half the original recipe) and it was more than adequate to frost a two-layer, nine-inch cake.

The name says it all---very rich and chocolatey!  I will definitely use this frosting again.  I didn't measure the milk--I just added it in small amounts alternately with the dry ingredients until I got the consistency I wanted.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

This is the best frosting I have ever made.  It should get 10 stars.  I used others advice and added 1/2 cup of milk and then added extra a tablespoon at a time.  It was ready to spead when spoon was pulled away and it did not make stiff peaks.  I halved the recipe and used on a cake I had made in a 9x13 pan and had frosting left over.  I put it in the frig and used it a couple of days later.  All I had to do was put it in the microwave and stir it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Absolutely decadent, and so easy to make. I usually cut the recipe in half for a 13 x 9 cake, and have some leftover, which never goes to waste. Believe it or not I cut it up to look like fudge and it gets rave reviews. Just superb!

Fantastic recipe! Very easy. I cut the recipe in half and had the perfect amount for a 2 layer 9" round cake. I even had a lot left over.

This turned out so great!  The recipe is very easy and is basically fool-proof.  The only change I made was to use heavy cream instead of milk.  I figured if I was going to die and go to heaven I may as well go fully loaded.

Good texture, but not chocolately enough for me. I halfed the recipe for two dozen cupcakes. Maybe halving it threw the ratios off, but I still used more cocoa than was required.

Great recipe and very easy to make.  You can adjust everything and it still comes out wonderful. I changed the amount of sugar and milk to my desire sweetness and consistency.  I reduced cocoa and added a little bit of fine coffee powder to make mocha cream.  It's very tasty and easy to spread on a cake!  This is the best and easy butter cream recipe.

I was so excited to use this for a chocolate cake I was making, my first chocolate cake from scratch, but it did not go over well.  My stomach hurts from eating this stuff.  The proportions did not work for me.  It was too bitter and too sweet all at the same time.  HORRIBLE!

I have joyfully been trying many different cake and frosting recipes from this site. I think this may just become my "staple" chocolate frosting. I loved how it was easy to make, it had a wonderful texture, piped easily and it is rich hence the name. I did use abit less sugar than called for and am glad I did. I feel that the full amount may have been a bit too sweet unless thinly applied. I used Blue Bonnet margarine as well. The frosting was piped (using a ziplock with a hole cut in the corner)onto cupcakes I made using the "One Bowl Chocolate Cake III" recipe on this site. They were moist, delicious, chocolatey-EXACTLY what I was looking for. I will search no more!

I guess I'm not a chocolate lover. The consistency was very fluffy and airy. I halved the recipe and took another user's tip to cut out a little bit of cocoa but it was still not as sweet as I wanted it to be. My advice: less milk, less cocoa powder! Chocolate lovers would enjoy this!

This is very good on it's own. However, if you really want it to be OVER THE TOP FANTASTIC, replace the milk with coffee (or espresso) and add a couple teaspoons of cinnamon. OH WOW does it ever make it decadent. Also, I like mine thicker, so I used half butter and half cream cheese, plus i reduced the sugar by a 3rd and it was still sweet enough for me. Yum yum

You can't argue with all of the positive reviews. I had to shorten the serving size to 8 because I was just making two dozen cupcakes and ended up using just about 1 1/2 cups of sugar after tasting (and tasting and tasting). If you have french vanilla extract go for it. Happy eating!!!

This is a great recipe! I chose to make half of the recipe, so I used 2 cups of confectioner sugar and 1/2 cup of cocoa (according to some of the other people who mentioned that it was too much cocoa) and cut the rest of the ingredients in half.  It was perfect!

I just made this frost to top a chocolate pan cake.  I loved the consistency (fudgy) and deep chocolate flavor.  I used Hersey's Special Dark Cocoa. I cut the receipe in half and still plenty left over for a smaller pan cake, cup cakes or filler for cookies.  Warning:  This frosting is rich so I wouldn't attempt to eat without a tall glass of cold mild.

awesome recipe!!!! halved the ingredients and it turned out perfectly! i dunno whether this gonna help, but in the middle of alternately mixing the dry ingredient with the milk, i took out a few tablespoons of the frosting when it's quite stiff/spreading consistency. then use it for the middle layer of my 9" chocolate cake. i continue adding milk to the rest of the mixture and mix it until it reached ganache consistency and use it for covering the whole cake. perfect!

I used this recipe to frost some white cupcakes, and I will definitely be using it again. It was super easy, and I keep all of the ingredients on hand.

I followed the recipe exactly. My butter was at the perfect temperature, which makes or breaks a buttercream. Anyway, it whipped up nicely and has a nice gloss. It's a medium brown color; not too light like lots of baking-cocoa-based chocolate frostings. In my opinion, it tastes and looks like canned frosting...but without the gross aftertaste and weird greasy feeling. It was really yummy.

Next time I make it, I'm going to try it with dark cocoa.

Oh. My. Goodness.  Best frosting ever, hands down.  I halved the recipe, and followed the review advice from a member about extra milk. Sixteen servings was more than enough for a layered cake.  This is definitely a keeper!

Thanks a Million for posting!  Son's birthday order was chocolate cake with chocolate icing.  This put the cake over the top and gave me more than enough for a 3-layer round cake with frosting in between each layer.  I will definitely keep this recipe in my box for future use.

Love it!  The original recipe is huge.  I paired it down a lot.  1/2 cup of butter, 2 cups confec. sugar, 3/4 cup cocoa, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 cup milk.  Voila!  Perfect.  Thanks Amy!

Halfed the recipe and that was enough for 2 - 9" round pans.  Used less icing sugar and cocoa as written.

This came out perfect!  Fluffy and creamy.  I made it the night before and then beat it a little more to smooth it out again before using it.

It was as good as any chocolate frosting I've had.  I think I'm just not a fan of this type of frosting.  It was too sweet for my taste.  I was hoping for something fudgier.  This was like a chocolate buttercream frosting.

Cut recipe in half to ice 12 cupcakes and the amount I had was enough for 24.  VERY RICH and very good.  I only added half of the called for milk and I got a THICK fudge like icing.  This was easy and very delicious.

Oh me, Oh my, such wonderful frosting. It makes my inner chocoholic blissed out.

I added this frosting to the Best Brownies by Angie and was in chocolate heaven.

Thank you again AMY :-)

I gave this 4 stars because it needs a few very small changes to make it perfect:  it needs a pinch of salt and the recipe calls for way too much sugar!  I made enough for 12 cupcakes and made the following small changes:  I used Kahlua instead of milk and added an extra 2 tbspoons, I only used 2 cups of sugar and I added a pinch of salt.  

This is a rich, delicious alternative to a standard butter cream frosting (which I frankly dislike).

Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This is the exact recipe my Mom used when we were kids but she always eyeballed the ingredients so to find this with measurements (scaled down to 6 servings) was a thrill.  So chocolatey and creamy!  Next time I will scale it down to 4 servings since I did have some left over but the flavor is OUTSTANDING!!!!!

This frosting is amazing!!!! This is my new favorite chocolate frosting recipe! I made the recipe exactly as written. I didn't find the frosting too sweet being that it has 9 cups of sugar! It was actually perfect! This recipe made a lot of frosting i was able to frost a double layer 11X 15 cake and some left over. I made this frosting the night before I had to frost the cake! The day after I just put it in the kitchen aid on high and  mixed it, per wilton i added 3-4 tablespoons of corn syrup to thin it out a bit! Incredible!!!!

This definitely has a nice spreading consistencey and half a recipe makes plenty.  But, it didn't look real chocolatety and I wasn't real fond of the taste.  It reminded me of the sugary frostings that you get on a boughten bakery cake, and it certainly didn't look like the frosting pictured on the cake here.  I probably won't make this again.  I have better tasting chocolate frosting recipes.

Halve this recipe unless you're doing a couple of large cakes at the same time. I found it spreads better if warmed up after mixing the ingredients together. Pretty good taste, I use it a lot on my doughnuts, cakes, etc. Any leftovers keep well in the refrigerator.

I took other reviews advise and halved the recipe to yield 16 servings for my chocolate cupcakes.  With the halved ingredients, I would say that the frosting was not chocolaty at all!  It tasted like regular butter-cream with a slight hint of chocolate flavor.  Not at all what I was looking for. And when I used it to frost the cupcakes with the frosting bag it did not look like what you'd want to see on a cupcake).  Next time I'll look for a chocolate fudge type frosting.

Best chocolate frosting ever! I did change it a bit since I didn't have regular cocoa in my cupboard.  I used 1/2 "hershey's special dark" cocoa and 1/2 "dutch processed cocoa" .  It was so rich and creamy.  Deliciously easy to use!

I scaled this to 3 servings to frost a 8 x 9 inch tray of "MMMMM...Brownies" (also on this site). It was a generous amount of frosting.

Love the creamy texture from the butter and the richness of using cocoa. I like my frostings less sweet and so I added the sugar slowly to taste. It spreads well so no need to add extra milk.

Taste is awesome, really easy to make, no problems with consistency (I used whole milk)-- BUT, the color is really bad. One guess what 2nd grade boys thought it looked like (especially out of a star tip on a cupcake)! It made enough for 30 cupcakes with leftovers and a messy pastry bag.

5 on taste; 4 on presentation. I loved that this was not super sweet. It was not the prettiest, like another reviewer stated, but I knew it was going to be gobbled, so not worried about it. Besides, I have a history of not making the best looking desserts, as long as they taste good. Thank you!

I'll start off with THANK YOU for sharing! A received many compliments on the rich cocoa flavor. Just as equally I was told it was TOO much cocoa. I enjoyed the change of taste; it doesn't taste like store bought and it tastes better than most frostings I've made.
On the down side... this frosting was just about perfect right before I followed a suggestion about placing it in the fridge if you make it a day ahead... DON'T DO THAT! It took close to three hours before it was back to a spreadable consistency.
This frosting is perfect for simply frosting a cake and it's even better if you don't care too much about the presentation of your cake. This frosting just doesn't look the prettiest. I remade this again tonight and used it for my famous mint, chocolate cupcakes... it doesn't hold any form or shape. I'll stick to using it between cakes.

I loved this frosting. I used it on One Bowl Chocolate Cake III. The consistency was perfect and it was very soft but not runny so it stuck to the cake perfectly. I would definately use this frosting recipe again. I also put a combination of coconut, icing sugar, milk and butter in the middle of the cake before frosting it with this icing. Fantastic!

I am the type of person that scrapes the frosting off of the cake - just not a big frosting person.  I've been looking for a good, creamy, not-too-rich or waxy frosting and THIS IS IT!!!  Oh my gosh, it is so perfect.  I made it exactly as the recipe is written and it turned out awesome.  You have to try it!!!!

Very nice and very versatile frosting!  This will be the only chocolate frosting I will use from now on.  I made a 1/2 recipe and it was enough to frost a 4 layer cake.  (This cake was decorated with a lot of candy, so I went lighter on the frosting than I would normally go.)  After adding all the ingredients, I found I needed to add a little more milk to make it more spreadable.  Excellent!

This was awesome!I will be using this instead of store bought from now on.  I didn't have the amount of baking cocoa it called for so I used what I had and it turned out really good.  I will use more cocoa next time but it still tastes good.  I loved it!

Made this tonight for classic yellow cupcakes. Very simple, quick recipe and FABULOUS taste/ texture. It reminded my daughter and I of a chocolate whipped cream frosting. It's not sicky sweet like canned chocolate frosting. I took the advice of others and thickened it with cocoa...1 tbs did it. This is definitely a plus plus recipe! Thank you.

This is our go to frosting recipe now.  I will never buy frosting again.  It taste great and spreads well.  1/4 of the recipe is enough to frost a 9X13 cake.  I beat it a long time to give it a whipped texture.

This was FABULOUS! I had a HUGE cake to ice so I altered the measurements to 1.5 cups butter; 6 cups sugar, 1 cup cocoa and 1/2 cup milk. It was so delicious and so easy to pipe. This is my go to chocolate recipe from now on.

Made this to go with yellow cake for my son's first birthday - it was great!  Everyone loved it.  I did half the recipe, though, and it frosted 24 cupcakes and I still had a lot left over!

While the frosting was very tastey, I think "rich" is not the right word to use to describe it.  When I think rich I think of a fudge like frosting.  This tasted a lot like straight cocoa powder and was more fluffy than rich.  Still good, just not at all what I was expecting.

Turned out great, used dark cocoa, and veganized with Earth Balance margerine and almond milk.  It's got a beautiful dark glossy sheen (darker than pic shown here) and amazing flavor.  This is a keeper.

Not to my taste -- too sugary and not buttery enough.  And be warned that the portions are absurd.  I halved the recipe for 2 dozen cupcakes and still had a ton left over!

I halved it as the other comments here suggested, it looks to be PLENTY for 2 9-inch rounds. As I live in Europe I had some  trouble converting the amounts (I bought WAAAY too much) but I had the privilege of using Van Houten 100% cocoa powder (reasonably priced and easy to find). I honestly think this is is probably the BEST frosting I have ever tasted in my life. I'm recommending it to EVERYONE!

I've been searching for a recipe like this!  It's delicious!  Half recipe makes enough for layer cake with plenty left over.  I used margarine instead of butter and we loved it!  Added milk 1 T at a time to get right consistency, and it held up beautifully on my cake.  The color was not as light as I expected after reading some reviews...perfect chocolate brown.

I used 1/2 a recipe to frost two 9" round cakes and it was a perfectly generous amount.  Excellent flavour, and not too rich, it was a perfect compliment for the Black Magic Cake recipe on this site.

Simply decadent! Soooo easy to make. Definitely cut this recipe in half for a 9 inch cake, 1/2 is plenty! I added 1 Tbsp of Kahula. When cut in half, it calls for 1 1/4 cups cocoa, I used 1 cup cocoa and 1/4 cup dark cocoa. Yummy!

This was the perfect topping for both my vanilla and chocolate cupcakes. i made 3 or 4 different frosting recipes before this, and was unhappy with all of them- this was wonderful! not too sweet and no strange aftertaste. the only change i made was to substitute heavy cream for the milk. try this- you wont regret it!

Great frosting! It's the perfect blend of chocolatey-ness without being overwhelming. I used this to pipe onto mini cupcakes and it held perfectly. It also hardens just slightly so I can cover the frosted cupcakes and it doesn't smear. It makes a ton, even when halving the recipe. I was left with about 4 cups leftover and I finally had to throw it away because I kept eating it!

I used this to frost the Black Magic Cake from this site that I made for an early Valentine's Day dessert for my husband. I scaled to 16 servings (1/2 recipe) and it was more than enough to frost the two 9" layers I made. I sifted my sugar and 1 cup of the cocoa. I wish I would have sifted the other 1/4 cup of cocoa because I ended up with a few little cocoa lumps that just wouldn't budge  even after mixing in my KA on speed 6 for 5 minutes. The amount of milk was perfect also. So I highly recommend sifting the dry ingredients. This frosting was very tasty and is a keeper.  Thanks, Amy, for a great recipe.

Great frosting! I used this on a chocolate chocolate cherry chip ice cream cake and it froze well, and decorated well. The kids kept asking for plain 'ol spoonfuls of frosting. Good stuff.

This was the perfect chocolate frosting for us!  I made the Black Magic Cake from this site for the hubster's birthday cake and used this frosting.  We absolutely loved it!  This was my first time making frosting and this came out so smooth and creamy.  Good advice from other reviewers to halve the recipe.  It was more than enough to fill and frost a two layer 9 in. cake.  Who needs to buy frosting in a can ever again!?  This was so much better!  Thank you for this recipe!

WOW!  This is SO GOOD!  I would give it more stars if I could.  "Rich" is probably an understatement.  It is super fudgey and delicious.  I made 1/2 the recipe and it was still WAY too much for an 8 inch, 2 layer cake, even with the frosting super thick.  I saved the leftover frosting to try on brownies.

Absolutely delicious!  I frosted "Wonderful Banana Cake" with this frosting, and the result was light, chocolately and simply scrumptious!  Thank you, Amy!

I've used and enjoyed many recipes from this site, but this is the first one that has inspired me to write a review.  This frosting is awesome.  I made a half a batch, and the only problem with it is that it might not make it onto the cake.  Next time I will make the whole recipe so that I can eat the extra half with a spoon.

This is very good chocolate frosting. The only thing is mine came out a bit too chocolatey.  Next time I will cut back a bit on the cocoa.

I made this recipe exactly as written (only divided by 4). I also beat it really good with an electric hand mixer, so it was nice and fluffy. I used it to frost some cupcakes and it was AWESOME. It spread beautifully.

Mm! This is a dark chocolate-y icing that is stiff enough to pipe right out of the fridge, but creamy enough to spread directly on cake. Well done! I'll be using it on chocolate cake from now on!

My frosting attempts never turn out well-- and this one was absolutely perfect.  I even accidentally just put all the ingredients in the bowl at the same time and used the hand mixer and it came out great.  I halved the recipe and it was the perfect amount to frost a 9 x 13 cake.

This is a classic old fashioned tasting chocolate frosting. Easy to make easy to use. I also made half the recipe. I used very high quality cocoa. It was absolutely wonderful!

I made this according to the direction but added more cocoa powder for a more chocolatey flavor. This recipe reminds me of a chocolate butter cream as it is very fluffy and once it sits for about 5 minutes you can make is smooth and seamless if you place a piece of wax paper on the frosting and gently run your hand or butter knife over the frosting.

I halfed this recipe and then also ended up using only 1 cup of the cocoa.  It was very good but I think 3/4 cup of cocoa for the recipes when halfed would be much better.  It can be intense for some people but all in all a good recipe.  A definite must try.

Very creamy,just sweet enough, and I used whipping cream instead of milk.  I actually was thinking of something else and melted my butter first so it was a soft set when I began whipping it. A 1/2 batch was more than enough for my 7 layer cake filling and to cover.

Today is my son's birthday, and I have ruined two different batches of chocolate frosting I've tried to make for his cake.  Not wanting to run to the store for "canned" frosting, though I would try a completely new recipe.  After reading the reviews, decided to give this one a try.  It's a wonderful, easy, creamy recipe and since I was able to make it the first time without ruining it; it's clearly idiot proof!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe and saving the day for me....and the birthday boy.  Cheers!

made and I have made many. I too, like others halved the recipe. It worked perfectly. The consistency was excellent. I will NEVER use another
recipe other than this one!!

I was looking for a new frosting for my classic chocolate cake and i found this recipe. This is just perfect! While preparing I was worried because the mixture was crumbled and didn t look like " creamy" at all but i trusted and kept working.... Then adding the very little milk ( i scaled the ingredients) and it became perfect! I covered the cake and used it even to decorate with a piping bag. Perfect! And yummi!

Like this frosting a lot!  My family doesn't really like desserts that are way too sweet so instead of 9 cups of confectioner sugar I only put 5 cups.  It was still sweet but not too sweet.  I would probably try 4 cups next time I make it.  Thank you.

FANTASTIC frosting! Cut it down to 8 servings and that was plenty to frost about 14 cupcakes, generously. Add the milk a little at a time b/c I only had to use maybe 2 Tbsps. or so. This is too simple and really delicious. Will be using this often! Thanks for sharing. :)

I gave this a try because it had such amazing reviews.  It wasHORRIBLE and inedible! WAY too much cocoa.  It felt like my mouth was buring.  I gave it 2 stars mainly because I felt bad giving it just 1 and because I was able to salvage the frosting by adding a lot more sugar and some more milk.  I'll stick with other recipe.  :)

I needed this to be crusting buttercream so I made it with shortening subbed for half the butter and i used a few ounces of heavy cream instead of milk.  Tastes great, rich and fudgey.  Will make this again.  Thanks Amy  for the recipe.

Mmm this was surprisingly simple for such a delicious frosting! 8) I didn't have any regular milk, so I used chocolate soy milk in place and it still turned out so yummy! I also scaled this down to 6, so I could frost brownies. Next time I won't bother scaling down, because I'll just eat the rest of the bowl ;)

Rich & chocolatey, indeed! When refrigerated, it has the consistency and taste of fudge. Be careful with the powdered sugar-to-cocoa ratio: too much confect. sugar and it's way too sweet, but too much cocoa powder and your teeth will ache!

I made this to go with One Bowl Chocolate Cake III.  It was excellent!  I did put a bit to much on my cake, so it was a bit sweet - but that was my fault.  Got a little excited.  Will definitely make again!

I used this frosting on a white cake for a friend's birthday and it was wonderful. Next time I will cut the recipe in half because I had so much left over. I did use heavy whipping cream instead of  milk which made it extra creamy.

Wonderful recipe.  It does make a lot.  I cut the recipe in half and had enough frosting to generously frost 24 cupcakes and still had a lot left over.

Delish!  Like other reviewers, I cut it in half and that was plenty for a double layer 8 inch cake.  I ran out of regular cocoa, so I substituted a little dark cocoa, and that made it extra chocolatey.  I subbed in a little coffee for the milk (I like the flavor), and since I am making a peanut butter cake, I added half a cup of peanut butter to the frosting and it is amazing.  It tastes exactly like a reeses cup.

I have been looking for this recipe for 20 years!  I used to make it as a child, love the fudgy flavor and nice thick consistency.  Thank you for sharing!  (Oh, I made 1/2 recipe for a 9x13 and it was enough.)  Thanks again!

Delicious and very easy to make. A couple of tips - sift your cocoa before adding. Mine had little lumps of cocoa powder because I failed to do so. Also, slowly add the milk and mix very well before adding more. It goes a long way, surprisingly.

This made good chocolatey frosting. I read the reviews and increased the sugar and decreased the cocoa, but it still had a very strong cocoa taste.  I think if I make it again, I will cut the cocoa to less than half of what it says, and increase the sugar too.

I made this for my wife's birthday cake I made  and she and the kids loved it. I don't care for chocolate cake and chocolate frosting, but this was the best. I had two big pieces and washed it down with a big glass of milk. I cut it in third and had some left after frosting a sheet cake. I had to add a little more butter and vanilla and mixed to taste.

So amazing and simple. The first time I made it, I quartered the recipe and used almond extract instead of vanilla. Quartering the recipe made enough for 24 cupcakes. Second time I made it, I halved the recipe, used vanilla extract and added a pinch of salt. Halving the recipe made more than enough to ice a 9" cake. Worst part is adding the sugar and cocoa to the butter. Even on the lowest setting of the mixer, a lot of dust made it in to the air.

This is a very good chocolate icing!  Incredibly rich, and very very creamy.  However, the amount of ingredients it calls for it absolutely absurd!  

I followed the recipe and discovered I barely had mixing bowls big enough to handle the load.  When I got done I had iced an entire two-layer cake with an abundant amount of frosting, but there was literally an entire giant bowl-full still left over.

Half or even quarter this recipe!  It'll go to waste unless you're cooking for the Duggars.

I made this for my sons' birthday and he loved it.  I'm not a big chocolate lover, so it was a bit rich for me, but the chocolate lovers loved it.  He says this frosting has to always be on his birthday cake from now on.

Awesome recipe, followed it exactly, but cut it in half.  By cutting it in half it made it perfect to frost an 8" round cake.  I did need to add a little extra milk to thin it out to make it easier to spread.

this makes enough to frost 2 9in cakes with layers!!!!  You can freeze butter cream though, just make sure to mix it thoroughly after it defrosts.  If this is to fudgy for you, you can add a container of whipped cream to tone it down.

Oh Wow! This frosting is amazing! I was a little worried because of the "no substitutes" warning on the butter... I didn't have any, so I used margarine. It was still amazing! Thanks so much for sharing, this is the chocolate frosting I will be using from now on!!

I really enjoyed this frosting but you must love chocolate because it is super chocolaty.  My 6 year old said the chocolate was "overpowering.". I used it on top of TOO MUCH CHOCOLATE CAKE, a recipe from AR.

This was a bit too rich for me, but my hubby loved it.  It has more of a mouse consistency and the cocoa flavor is very apparent.

OMG!  This is the best chocolate frosting I have ever made!  I only made half of the recipe and alternated the milk with the confectioner's sugar in order to get the sugar blended in.  Other than that I followed the recipe to the "T".  This will be ONLY chocolate frosting recipe from now on.  Thank you Amy for sharing your recipe!  GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!  If I could I would give this frosting a 10 star rating.

Incredible.   The only thing I changed was the milk ingredient.  I used Baileys White Chocolate liquor instead.   I used  the same amount 1/2 cup.

Excellent.  I ran out of cocoa so used 2 cups cocoa and 1 cup chocolate soy milk (as we have lactose intolerant family).  Added milk as I reached desired consistency.

I love chocolate and I love sweets, but rich and sweet are not synonymous.  This recipe makes far too much.  I halved it and still had more than enough for 2 8in rounds.  The taste completely overpowered that of the cake, which was very rich.  I wanted to taste my cake, not have cake textured frosting.  I ended up removing about 75% of the frosting in order to salvage my cake.

Very rich, chocolatey frosting.  Easy to make and great consistency.  I also halved the recipe and had plenty for a 8 inch round 2 layer cake.

I omitted the vanilla extract but grated a medium sized orange and it was awesome.  Next time though, I will add the zest last so the taste is evenly spread throughout the entire batter.  Also the frosting was thick so I had to put it in the microwave for 30 seconds to make it spreadable.  I love it and will continue to use it.  Thanks!

Sooooooo Yummy and as the title says it is a very "Rich Chocolate" frosting, so expect it to be rich and chocolatey.  The recipe amount is VERY large though.  I divided the recipe into thirds, made a third of the recipe and had plenty to frost a double layer 9in. round cake (with extra left over).  I also covered with plastic and put in the fridge so I could frost later, it was really firm right out of the fridge so definitely let it sit out for about 20 min. before frosting so it goes on smooth.  I will use this recipe over and over and over again!!!

Honestly, the best chocolate frosting I have ever tasted.  I did use Ghiradelli brand cocoa powder, which can't have hurt.  Oh my, it was so, so delicious.  Also, I halved it, and it was more than enough for a 9 inch round layer cake.

This is a great chocolate frosting, turns out glossy and delicious.  9 Cups is way too much icing sugar, you can get away with much less and still have the sweetness and consistency needed.  Taste after every cup; I think I only used 2 or 3 max.  Very good.

Great icing!  Made this to put on the Black Magic Cake - I halved the icing recipe, as this makes a lot.  I had enough icing to put between two 9" cake layers and generously frost the top and sides of the cake.

Definitely only need 1/2 recipe for 2 layer 8" cake.  It's not bad but I did find it too cocoa-y even though I followed the recipe exactly (by half).  I added a bakers chocolate square to try and even out the chocolate flavour but it didn't really work.  Probably won't make this again. *UPDATE:  this frosting is definitely better room temperature on the cake.  It was a hot day so I had the cake in the fridge and the icing didn't taste the best, but when I left it out afterwards the warmer up icing was definitely better.*

AMAZING!  I cut the recipe in half as suggested and had more than enough for over 3 dozen mini cupcakes.  I will definitely make this again- it was really easy!  I'm not sure I will buy canned frosting again.

This frosting is awesome.  It has a milk chocolate flavor that complemented my dark devil's food cake perfectly.  As others have mentioned, 1/2 of this recipe is plenty for your average sized cake.

When it says "no exceptions" to the butter rule...follow it! I tried with light margarine--didn't work. (even after adding more conf. sugar, lots of cornstarch, and some melted marshmallow--still didn't thicken) Follow the recipe! =0)

This is an awesome recipe! I cut it down to 6 servings since I only had a small 8x8 cake - made the perfect amount. By cutting it down I left out the 2T of cocoa & probably only should have used 2T of milk instead of 3T. Tastes like chocolate pudding! (Using this frosting for a cake white recipe "simple white cake" on this site)

After browsing through many chocolate frosting recipes, I chose this one because it was simple and got great reviews. But I was fearful that it wouldn't be as delicious as the other, more complex frosting recipes that include large amount of chocolate that I had been reading. I needn't have feared. This frosting is AMAZINGLY delicious. I will make it again and again, and never buy store bought frosting again. Thanks for the recipe!

Ok...I'm not a huge fan of chocolate, unless it's chocolate frosting on brownies.  And this recipe totally rocks!  I was eating it by the finger-full! And like I said....not a huge fan of chocolate. But mmmmmm.....mmmmmm....good! I like it better than the store bought kind!  And it's EASY!

I don't usually write reviews, but this frosting is amazing.  Made as directed and had enough to frost two cakes.  My husband enjoyed it.  Will make again.

I am really critical of frostings, but this is awesome! Paring the recipe down to 8 servings is the perfect amount for an 8x8 cake size. 
I used dutch cocoa in it, so it's even richer and chocolatier. YUM!

Texture and flavor are fabulous. I cut the recipe down quite a bit then added just a dallop of peanut butter. It tasted like a peanut butter cup!

Best chocolate frosting I've found to date. However, I cut the cocoa by a 1/2 cup ... plus half the recipe frosts a 4 layer round cake easy :)

It was my wife's birthday so I asked her what kind of frosting she wanted on her cake. I read off a few reviews to help her choose. She told me "make me that one with the husband who wants a bucket full," so I did. She ate half of it before I had a chance to put it on her cake.

Frosting is AMAZING. Super chocolatey. But I recommend 2 cups cocoa instead of 2 1/2. 2 cups was perfect :)

I am VERY picky about chocolate frosting, and this is absolutely the best recipe I have ever tried! It's so good because it's incredibly chocolaty a as well as being creamy. The consistency is perfect.

This is an awesome, awesome frosting. I scaled it back to 16 servings (half of the original recipe) and it was still enough to frost in between two 9-inch rounds, as well as the sides and top and I had some left over. The leftovers are incredible, which is really why I am posting this recipe. You have to try this frosting melted (until bubbly in the microwave) for a strawberry dipping. It's also awesome (melted, again) as an ice cream topping. I will use this recipe a lot, I am sure!

I cut this recipe more or less in half. Used 1 cup butter, 4 cups confectioners sugar, 1 cup cocoa, 1/2 cup milk. The texture was perfect for spreading and tasted delicious!

This was an awesome chocolate frosting recipe.  I will use this from now on.  i made it for the frosting on the Eclair Cake and it was delicious.  i did cut the ingredients in half since I knew it would make a ton of frosting otherwise.

Pretty yummy! This recipe makes a HUGE batch of frosting - I made a 4 layer cake and frosted generously, and still had probably 2-3 cups leftover.

Excellent frosting and super easy! I can see why another reviewer's husband wanted just a bowl of this for his birthday treat. It became fudge-y after sitting in the fridge overnight before putting on cupcakes. Rich and delicious, this is a keeper.

I cut the recipe in half and still had a lot left over after icing 23 cupcakes (I tasted one before icing just to make sure it was ok, since it's a new-to-me recipe. 

This icing is really good, although it's too birthday cake-like for me. Although I was accustomed to the vanilla buttercream icing that I usually make that calls for adding all ingredients at the same time, so that's what I did with this one before I went back and saw that wasn't what I was supposed to do. I may try it again using the directions as stated, or I'll stick with my old recipe (same ingredients, different measurements) and just add cocoa. But that won't be for awhile since I have so much left still!

When it says RICH chocolate frosting, it means rich!  I couldn't eat very much of this, it was too chocolaty for me, but one bite satisfied my sweet tooth! My husband, and friends all thought it was wonderful though, and went back for seconds. I had quite a bit of frosting left over, So I'm sending it to my sister in law who is a chocolate fanatic.   I probably won't make this for ME, but when I bake anything for my sister in law that needs frosting, it;ll be this recipe.

This is so light, fluffy and delicious! It certainly has a distinct cocoa flavor which is just scrumptious! I scaled mine down to 16 servings. Had enough to put a VERY thick layer of frosting on a 13x9 Black Magic Cake and had about 1.5 cups of frosting leftover. This stuff is delicious and easy. Will make again and again!

EXCELLENT!!!!!  I had to alter the amount; WAY TOO MANY SERVINGS unless you are feeding an ARMY.  I divided the recipe by 4 and made what I needed to frost cupcakes.  My Belgian husband was licking the bowl, spoon, etc.  Yum Yum!!!!  
BTW: MAKE SURE YOU SIFT THE SUGAR AND THE COCOA AT LEAST ONE TIME; SIFTING TWICE WILL GIVE YOU A SMOOTHER TASTING FROSTING.

I received several compliments on this frosting and vowed never to buy chocolate frosting again!  I often find frostings from powdered sugar too sweet.  To counter that I sifted the flour directly into a measuring bowl and added the 9 cups sifted to the recipe.  This gave it the perfect amount of sweetness.   If you need help spreading it so that it does not crumble the cake, get a glass of warm water.  Dip the frosting tool into the warm water and spread out the frosting.  This is just enough heat to spread only the top of the frosting without melting it.  It comes out very shiny and smooth this way too.

This is my new favorite choc. frosting recipe. I cut the recipe in half and I replaced the milk with cold espresso to give it a little different taste. I added small amounts at a time, just to make sure the final result was the right consistency. Turned out extremely tasty!  Note: If you don't have an espresso machine, strong coffee will prob. work too.

Ohhhh ohhh ohh!  I love thist frosting!  I made it for my boyfriend's cake.   We had a huge birthday party, and I made a giant cake with 2 layers.  This recipe more than covered both layers and worked as filling between.  There was a good amount left over, too.  I only changed one thing.  I folded in some heavy whipping cream (whipped) at the end because my bf always asks for whipped cream Icing.  The taste was wonderful.  I used unsalted butter, because it wasn't specified in the recipe.  It really tastes fantastic!  The only problem is, I can't stop eating it.

Topped a strawberry cake with this frosting and it was very creamy and yummy.  The kids loved it, and though delicious, it's a little too rich for me.  Were it up to my kids they would give it a 10-star!  We settled on 4.  Thanks for this recipe.  It's a keeper!

Made the full recipe for "Wonderful Banana Cake".  To die for! Was way too much for my 9x13 cake though.  Would cut recipe in half next time. I'm sure we'll figure out what to do with the extras though.

It would be hard for anyone to not like this frosting, though why every review says to scale the recipe to 16 for a 9 in double layer cake is beyond me, unless you happen to like more frosting than cake. I scaled the recipe down to 12 and I still ended up with a tupperware full of frosting that I'm not sure what to do with. I would scale it to 9 next time, but my family tend to like only a thin layer of frosting. This frosting was great for Black Magic Cake, perfectly offsetting its darkness. The milk ratio is low, but it's hard to get the perfect consistency- the line between too little and too much milk in the frosting is so thin that while adding the milk I felt like I was doing an acid-base titration=P. Haha, dorky science joke- now that's what makes a creative review!

This was the best. Used quarter of the recipe for some cupcakes I made for my son. Used 1/2 cup margarine (I know it said no subs but its what I had) 2 1/4 cups confectioners sugar, 1/4 cup milk and same 1tsp vanilla extract. Guess you can make this as sweet as you want but that was good enough for us.  This is the frosting I will now be using so good and so simple. Thanks for sharing
Made again forgot to add 1/4-1/2 cup cocoa

Great recipe! This is truly a chocolate lovers dream on a cake. I used 8 cups powdered sugar, 2 tsp. of vanilla and used whipping cream instead of milk and kept adding in more whipping cream after the 1cup until I reacheda consistency that I wanted. I also added a tsp. of salt because I think it enhances the flavor. I frosted a 3 layer checkerboard cake for a baby shower and got rave reviews, so it is a keeper!

Amazing to work with!!! spreads so easily, just added more milk like other reviewers until it was almost mousse like, delish!!!! will be keeping this recipe, although I cut it down to 24 servings, and frosted a 3 tier round and still had loads left, this makes ALOT of frosting. Next time will cut inhalf for a three tier.

Absolutely delicious frosting!  I pared this recipe down to use as accent frosting on a cake, and I did add more vanilla than called for.  It worked perfectly--even though I have a lot to learn about cake decorating!!  Very tasty!

This frosting is the best-tasting frosting I have ever made! I used it to ice "Dark Chocolate Bacon Cupcakes" and I got almost as many compliments on the frosting as I did on the cupcakes. I didn't find it tasted "cocoa-y" at all(as noted by some reviewers). It has a very rich, creamy chocolate flavor- not too cloying, and not bitter. I only had to use 8 cups of sugar, not 9, and I beat it well with my hand mixer. The result was a frosting that had the perfect chocolate flavor and it piped BEAUTIFULLY onto my cupcakes (using a large star tip). This recipe makes a TON of frosting- I only used half to generously frost 24 good-sized cupcakes.  If one was using it to do a layer cake there would be plenty to decorate with (I've used recipes in the past that were very stingy with amounts, barely providing an adequate crumb coat). I will make this again and again when I need a chocolate frosting.

This was so easy and wonderfully delicious!  My son wanted chocolate cake with chocolate icing for his birthday.  This was easy enough for him to make.  Everyone loved it and was amazed how great it tasted.  We made a two layer 9in cake and cut the recipe in half as others said.  It was PLENTY. Thank you for the recipe!

Best chocoalate frosting EVER!!!  Like some others, I cut the recipe in half for a 2 layer 9" round cake. I only substituted homogenized evaporated milk, used 10 Tbsp added 1 at a time as I was mixing in the sugar, and used salted butter.  To the reviewer who said all her husband wanted for his birthday was a bowl of this frosting...I have to agree with him.

The icing had to be whipped for a while to remove the clumps of cocoa which seemed to thin it out a little. I would only add a bit of the milk at first and then whip it until smooth to see if any additional milk is necessary.

My guests liked it but I choked it down. The taste is WAY too much like cocoa. I think an icing made with actual chocolate would be much tastier. On the plus side, the spreading consistency was great.

Amazing and wonderful because of the chocolate flavor and superior consistency.  It's as great as you would like ganache to be but so much easier to make.

Loved it! Made it as the icing for a Devil's Food Cake and it was devoured. Easy to make, delicious. Halved the recipe and it was enough to frost and fill a 9 inch layer cake.

Excellent frosting recipe! I gave it four stars because I used heavy cream instead of milk. I think that made a big difference in how creamy it is. As a side note, I think that you should use more cream/milk than you initially think you should. The more I added the better it got!

I love this frosting.  It is very versatile.  Use less liquid and it can make roses and stiff flowers, add more liquid and it is a creamy frosting.  My advice is make sure the butter is room temperature and cream well, and then add the cocoa and cream them together well.  Then, add the sugar and milk for a non-gritty texture.  I followed others advice and reduced the cocoa.  I also made the frosting the day before so the taste was smooth.  It makes a generous amount and generously frosted and decorated a 12 inch double layer cake.

This was good - just a little too much cocoa flavor for me. I'd like it to have more of a chocolate taste.

At my house we rate things by "don't do that again" or that was a "do-over." My husband went a step further and said that was the best frosting he had ever had. It reminded him of his grandma's frosting. This is the best "review" that I have ever gotten from him before. This was not simply a "do-over", but a please do that again.

I halved this recipe and added 1 tbsp of cayenne pepper and 1 tsp powdered ginger to make it a little bit spicy, and everyone loved it!  Frosting turns out very fluffy and extremely chocolaty -- thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutly perfect recipe! Switch out vanilla and some milk for Bailey's, eyeball measurements for smaller portions, slip on the milk and just add more sugar, it is so simple it is just impossible to screw up!

This is a fantastic chocolate frosting.  I am a chocolate fanatic and this definitely answers the craving.  I have some excellent chocolate cake recipes but so far I haven't found one that stands up to the flavor that this frosting delivers.

I have tried several chocolate frostings from this site and this by far was a huge hit. The only change I made was less sugar. I iced a 3 tier cake and a monkey cake. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow, this is a great frosting! Light, fluffy, and delicate with melt in your mouth creaminess and texture. This turned out a light brown color and was chocolatey but not fudgey. Very very good. I used unsalted butter and cut this down to 8 servings. Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic!
Perfect flavour and balance of chocolate and sweetness.
I used half milk and half cooled coffee for a mocha flavour for Sandy's Chocolate Cake recipe on this site.

Yum!! I did not care for this icing at first taste, but after I iced my amazing cake (Sandy's chocolate cake from this site) and let it set in the fridge for a couple of hours, it was to die for! I made as directed except I added a couple splashes of my left over French vanilla coffee from this morning. So good! I can't wait to make this for guests!!

This was a really good EASY recipe. I too cut it in half and reduced the sugar to 4 cups for two nine inch rounds. I was out of vanilla so I used 3 tbsp brewed coffee instead, this gave it a mocha flavor which was very good. Next time I will make this and use the vanilla as called for. Thanks for a great recipe:)

I reduced the amount of cocoa and it was still too overwhelming. This is titled "Rich Chocolate Frosting" though, so I guess it was to be expected. Just be sure you are ready for it is all!

CUT THIS RECIPE IN HALF FOR A REGULAR 9" X 13" PAN! I also found it needed more vanilla and a touch more sugar, but I like frosting very sweet.

Another reviewer said her husband wanted a bowl of this for his birthday, I can see why! This is the best frosting I've ever tasted and I've been around for a while...lol! I followed everyone else's advice and halved the recipe & also followed another's advice to use 3 cups sugar to everyone 1 cup  butter and she was spot on. The sweetness to chocolate ratio is perfect and I will never use another frosting recipe again! This is the best. I made this for the first time for two nine year olds, I used one to test the frosting and his eyes bugged out and he said "yum!" and wanted to know when could he have some cake! I used the crazy cake recipe from this site and after eating the cake he told me he didn't like chocolate before but he loves it now and this is the best cake & frosting he'd ever had! Thank you, you Amy, you made me a hero today!

This is a rich dark chocolatey frosting. I used it on yellow cupcakes and was very good with the cake.

This is the best homemade frosting I've ever tasted!! It was super fluffy and airy, not in the least gritty (as some recipes can be), and it was the perfect balance between chocolate ( I LOVE chocolate), and sweet. In this case the recipe was halved as I knew it would make WAY too much frosting for a single cake, and the recipes was followed to a "T", oh, and did I forget to mention that it was my 11 year old son who made it?? It was that easy!!

The best frosting ever!  I halved the recipe and had plenty to pipe on top of a dozen of cupcakes.  I really beat the heck out of it with my mixer and it was very creamy and airy.  Did have to add a tiny bit more milk than called for.  Will use this recipe from now on!!! :)

I decided to make this frosting for 24 cupcakes, It is amazing. The only problem I was there was way to much! All I had to frost was 24 cupcakes and there was enough for probobly 2 times that. I suggest to everyone who decides to make this to only make half the recipe. Unless you need a lot of frosting.

I'm torn between giving this recipe a four and a five because I still found it a tad gritty. Maybe it's me just not mixing enough? I'm forever on a quest for the creamiest frosting. Otherwise I thought it was really good. I used melted baker's chocolate because that was all I had. Really yummy.

I always follow a recipe like it is written the first time.  Today I made my wife a three layer chocolate birthday cake and I had enough frosting left to make another.  Put it in the fridge and will probably find some other kind of cake to make this week.  I mixed the coco with the powdered sugar before adding to the butter to keep it from flying all over my kitchen.  I used the heavy duty beater that came with my Kitchenaide to beat in the sugar and coco then did not measure the milk at all but drizzled a little and let it mix.  Kept adding more until it was perfect.  This is the best chocolate frosting recipe I have ever found.  Just cut the recipe in half if you are only making one cake.

AWESOME!  This is my new go-to chocolate frosting.  I love the flavor of the Chocolate Fudge frosting on this site but the hot fudge makes it a little unstable.  This one holds it's shape even in hot weather and is delish!

After reading the highlighted review of Amy's husband Doug who requested a whole bowl of this frosting for his birthday, I was doubtful! My husband doesn't like frosting at all but he LOVED this!! It went SO well with the "Dark Chocolate Bacon Cupcakes" recipe on this website - try it!

I cut the recipe in half and it was enough to frost & fill one dozen cupcakes. With a couple leftover. Also, added a dash of rum extract cause it looked like I didn't have enough vanilla. KILLER!!!

Wonderful, rich and soooo cocoa-ey!  LOVE it! I substituted Bailey's for half of the milk, to frost a mocha cake, and it made it that much better yet.  Thanks for a terrific, go-to worthy chocolate frosting recipe!

This frosting was amazing!  It was simple enough that my 4 year old mostly made it!  We only added 1/4 C of milk and the consistency was perfect for icing a cake.

I pared down the recipe to 6 servings as I was only making cupcakes.  I also substituted Carob powder in place of the cocoa powder and added about 1/4 tsp of mint extract. YUM!  great frosting, can't wait for the cupcakes to cool so I can frost one!

This recipe was amazing! I didn't have baking cocoa, however, so I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead. It turned out tasting pretty dark so I kept adding vanilla until I got the right flavor. This frosting turned out great with my yellow cupcakes! Couldn't have been happier! I'll definitely be using this recipe every time I make chocolate frosting.

I used this recipe to frost cupcakes for my son's birthday party. I got so many compliments! I didn't intend to change a thing, however, upon adding a portion of the cocoa, I realized I didn't need it all. For a full batch of frosting I only used 1.5 cups of cocoa.

I usually bounce around from recipe to recipe for my butter cream frosting but there really is no reason to anymore. I also usually don't lick the spoon or utensils but after reading all the reviews I just had to give it a try. All I can say is wow! I had the allrecipes  calculator cut the recipe to 1/4 quantity to frost the perimeter of a single 9 inch chocolate fudge cake and there was more than enough to go around. I am going to love to try alternating the vanilla extract with my favorite other extracts: rum, coconut, butter vanilla or orange. This frosting would be great for cakes, cupcakes, brownies and more - very versatile! And I licked the spatula clean.

I halved this and had more than enough for a 4-layered German Chocolate cake (perhaps because I had the "German" filling between the layers, rather than the frosting. It was delicious.

WONDERFUL recipe BUT I highly suggest cutting sugar back to 6 cups...taste then add more sugar if you like.  I think it is plenty sweet enough with 6.  Wonderful creamy frosting and very good flavor.

This was WAY too sweet. I should've checked out the other reviews, not just the ones on the top, before using this. I will not make this again. It completely overpowered the cake, and took it from something that was supposed to be rich to just plain sugary and bad.

This frosting definitely holds up to its name...rich!  My daughter loves to eat the frosting all by itself!  It's a good thing this recipe makes so much frosting or I wouldn't have enough for my cupcakes!  This recipe makes more than three (store bought) frosting containers full.  So cut recipe in half if you don't need that much. 
It's a very simple, very rich and a very creamy frosting.

I just made the worst cupcakes I have ever made and this frosting saved them. It was the only edible thing. now there are only 4 cupcakes left, thanks to the frosting and I was afraid I was going to be stuck with all of them. they would eat the frosting off of them and check the cakes if I let them. Thanks

awesome recipe. I had a happy accident when making this last time and had to finish it in my Vita-Mix. Because of the heat from mixing it set the icing after it cooled. I had no idea how thick I had made it in some places but it turned out like fudge, YUMMM!

This was delicious!  I used 1/2 cup butter and adjusted the rest of the ingredients accordingly to frost the top of a cake in a 9x13 pan.  It was just the right amount.  :)

Yum!  I made half of this recipe for cupcakes and it is so delicious!  I ran out of unsalted butter and had to use 1/2 cup of salted--it didn't seem to affect the taste.  The mixture looked lumpy after adding the milk, but it smoothed out after beating it for a little longer.

I made 12 servings, and it was a disaster. At first it was clumpy and unusable. We had to drain some of the milk out of the bowl. Then we added more butter, sugar, extract, and milk and mixed it. We had to stir it for at least 20 minutes, but eventually we came out with a nice icing.

A little too chocolatey for our tastes (my three year-old was halfway through her cupcake when she demanded, "MOMMY!  A BINK!").  Still good when washed down with a cold glass of milk.

It turned out really good! But I would reduce the amount of cocoa. It tastes reallyyyy cocoay! I only used 2 cups cocoa and about 9.5 cups powdered sugar and it still tastes a bit strong for me. I'm going to make some minor changes but besides that it is super creamy and an all around good frosting! Super easy to make, too :)

First and foremost, this recipes makes twice as much frosting as you need for one cake...keeping that in mind, I divided it in half. I added a teaspoon of instant coffee granules to the recipe to intensify the chocolate flavor. YUM! The coffee makes the frosting so rich and decadent! DELISH!!!

This frosting is amazing!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and frosted a nice sized heart shaped cake with left over to spare.  This frosting reminds me of eating Little Debbie Fudge rounds as a child.  I have made many, many, many chocolate frosting recipes and this will be my go to chocolate frosting from here on out!

This frosting was SO good! It makes a huge amount so you could probably cut it in half and it would still be plenty for a full cake or 24 cupcakes. It's one of the best frosting recipes I've tried. Very chocolately and so tasty!!

Simply Delish!  I am a huge fan of the super sugary frosting, not buttercream, and this one hits the mark!  A keeper for sure!  Next time I may add a bit more milk to make it spread a bit easier, but w the halved recipe I was able to frost a dbl layer 9" cake (had just enough)!

Really, really delicious.  This will be my go-to choco frosting from now on!!  Many people mentioned (and I should have taken note) that this recipe makes enough to frost a few cakes!! I had two cakes to frost and still had enough to frost AT LEAST two more cakes!!  So I'll half the recipe next time.

Really chocolately and delicious!!  It does harden up quite a bit if you refridgerate it, so if you want that soft, chocolate frosting make sure if you have refridgerated your cake you take it out well in advance of serving it.  Delish!! :)

AH-MAZING!  Loved it and added more milk at 1 Tbsp at a time which worked.  I couldn't believe how light and fluffy it came out.  Will definitely make it again!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Spectacular frosting- makes a HUGE batch.  Halving the recipe still makes enough to frost 2 8" rounds with extra to spare.  *To keep the chocolate powder from coating the whole kitchen try mixing it thoroughly into 1/2 of the milk first.

Very easy recipe to make, just be warned that it makes a LOT of frosting! Absolutely fantastic though, will definitely make again next time I need chocolate frosting.

Just finished making this to put on top of some cream cheese brownies.  Perfect...soft, not too sweet and creamy, smooth spreading consistency.

I've never made a chocolate frosting and now I will never buy one again!!!! This is soo good. I cut it in 1/2 as suggested, plenty for a 2 layer, 9 inch cake. I used dark cocoa powder. My husband & son licked the bowl clean after I was done!!

I scaled this down to 8 servings, which was by far more than enough for 16 cupcakes.  It is the best chocolate frosting I have ever made.  I did swap the milk for chocolate milk, since I was out of plain.

Halfed the recipe, except for the milk. It was enough to ice two cakes with just a little left over. When I say that I will never buy another chocolate icing again, I mean it.

The only negative about this frosting is that my husband won't stop eating it out of the bowl while I am trying to frost the cake!  It is so delicious and spreads on the cake wonderfully.  Best Frost receipe I ever made!

Best. Icing. Ever.

It's not sugar-shock sweet, and not greasy (no shortening!). It's a little bitter, like dark chocolate. Goes great on "David's Yellow Cake".

The cake turned out very moist. I had doubts when the batter was thin, but it turned out great. I sifted the dry mix and whipped the eggs to add extra air, and put wet paper towels on the cake as it cooled. Not sure what kind of difference those techniques made.

Really, really good.  Didn't have milk so I used almond milk and it was delicious.  I think the quality of this frosting would depend a lot on the quality of the cocoa powder, I used Penzeys cuz it's the BEST.

I needed to make a frosting for a last second cake and had almost no ingredients to do so. I scaled this down to 9 servings,  I was surprised how light and fluffy this was. I was expecting a heavy stick to your ribs kinda frosting. The only thing is I would cut back on the cocoa just a bit. but it was really good.

Delicious!  I wanted Chocolate Peanut Butter frosting so I substituted 1 cup of peanut butter for 1 cup of butter.  I also added about a tablespoon of vanilla and used half whipping cream and half milk.  I will definitely go back to this recipe!

Insanely good! The only change I made was to add more milk to thin the icing, almost double what the recipe called for. The flavor is phenomenal, very rich but not overly sweet. I set the servings at 12 and had enough for a nine inch double layer cake and a small tray of cupcakes. (I only ice cakes to around 1/4 inch thickness.) Seriously, the best icing I have ever made. Can't wait to try this with raspberry and lemon flavorings.

Just made this for my son's birthday brownie. I had him taste it (picky almost-18 year old) and he thought it tasted like chocolate ice cream. It tastes delish!! Can't wait to eat his "cake" tomorrow.

I halved the recipe which was more than plenty for a two layer cake.  I also used about 1/2 the cocoa the recipe called for (I kept tasting it as I added it) and mixed it all in the food processor.  It has a nice sheen and tastes wonderful!  Thanks for sharing!

Thick and rich. I would definitely half the recipe next time. I had a lot left over so I saved it for a few days and made another cake. I think it was better the second time!

I used this frosting on cupcakes made with the Extreme Chocolate Cake recipe from this site.  They were YUMMY! They tasted just like something you would get from a professional bakery or cupcake shop.  This frosting is rich and chocolaty, very creamy, and piped out of a decorator bag onto the cupcakes with no problem.

it came out exactly as I had hoped. I went with some high end coca powder, although Hershey's will work and heavy whipping cream in place of the milk. Can't wait to put this on some yellow cake. MMmmmmmmm

This is amazing. I JUST now made it and yum! I ended up having to use half and half because my milk went bad (bad planning right there). I also had it turned down to 8 servings which made enough to frost a 9 inch cake.

No more store bought frosting for me!  This is so good.  I used Hersheys Special Dark cocoa to go with my dark choc cake.  I had to use almost twice the amount of milk called for to get the right consistency.  This makes soooo much.  I should have halved the recipe but I am kind of glad I didn't b/c now I have a big tub of it my freezer just waiting for the perfect brownines!

SO rich and delicious!  I used this for my nephew's birthday cake and liked it so much I used it for my son's 2nd birthday as well - with rave reviews both times.  The only changes I made were that I set part of it aside and added some cream cheese for the layers of the cake, which was extra yummy!  And for my son's cake, I added cinnamon which complimented the flavors nicely.  

With adding the cream cheese, it gave me enough to frost a 3 layer cake and I saved the extra and frosted a batch of cupcakes a few days later.  Couldn't let it go to waste!

Bit messy, but lovely!  [If you don't want your filling/cream to be soaked in between the layers and on the top of the cake, put some jelly/jam on it first (apricot's a good choice, because it has a soft flavor)]

This frosting is so easy, and so delicious!  It does make a ton though; I halved the recipe and still had more than enough to frost and fill a 9-inch round cake.  SUPER chocolatey; I may cut back a bit on the cocoa and even the sugar next time for a milder taste.  But no doubt, there will be a next time.

I cut the half and followed the recipes as written..as another view put.....the only thing you could taste was coco powder. I ended up scrapping it off the cake and replacing it with store bought frosting. I don't understand how it got such high ratings.

This is the best frosting I've ever made. I cut the recipe down to 12 servings and used it on the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III recipe then let both sit overnight...amazing! I have to say that I had A LOT left over (just used it to ice the top and around the sides).

This frosting is so good it should be illegal!  My only suggestion is that if you are making an average size cake cut the recipe in half.  I was generous with the frosting and still have a ton left over.

I only made 1/4 of this recipie and I had enough to ice a 9x13 chocolate cake. That being said, this frosting was excellent! I made it to top a cake that I served at our house warming party and I had one guest request to scrape the bowl clean!

I made some cupcakes today to try out a new yellow cake recipe. I picked this chocolate recipe to frost them because of the ratings. The frosting is very rich and a little bitter. I used the calculate button to make 8 servings and it made a little more than the frosting containers at the store. I added about 3 Tblsp. extra of powdered sugar to cut through the rich slightly bitter taste. However, the frosting just seems very similar in taste and consistency to store bought frosting, which I do not care for at all. Although it wasn't to my taste, because of the sweetness, I am sure kids would love it.

I made some cupcakes for my sons birthday and ran out of my store bought frosting.  I jumped on here and found this recipe and calculated it for 4 servings.  It made more than enough.  I was SO pleased with it that I will make this recipe anytime over store bought from now on.  It was quick, simple and delicious!

This is truly exceptional!  I have made it a few times now and it is excellent!  Just halve it! I forgot and had so much my mixer could hardly handle it! :)

I took my time with the milk so I could have a firmer frosting to decorate. 

Thanks!

This is a really yummy recipe.  I love the taste of cannded chocolate frosting (I know - I'm crazy!) and this is actually really close.  I used it to make frosting mounds on thumbprint cookies.  Yum!!

good, chocolatey frosting.  the trick is to whip the heck out of it (otherwise it's more like a ganache).  i would have probably given it five stars but i think it's a little too sugary (grainy?  even though i used powdered sugar and sifted all ingredients) and i personally prefer the chocolate cream cheese frosting on this site (for me it's 5-star all the way!). also, i had to add a little extra milk to get it the consistency that i was wanting.

This icing is INCREDIBLE. If you love chocolate, you'll be in heaven. The only problem I had with it wasn't because of the recipe.. I have a standard size KitchenAid and the recipe turned out to be a bit much for it. When I had about 2 cups of the cocoa/sugar mixture left to add in, I had to transfer it to a bowl and mix it in myself. This makes A LOT of icing. I used it to generously ice 26 cupcakes and I have a lot left. I'm going to make a 9x13 cake to finish it off, because it's WAY too good to go to waste! Very rich and chocolatey.

I am not sure  about this recipe. I cannot imagine what kind of cake you would need to make 32 servings of frosting for. It could have frosted two cakes.

PERFECT FROSTING! I (like many others) needed to cut the recipe in half. I used it to make my daughters birthday cake that was 9 x 9, and I couldn't help but lick the bowl when I was finished, and I don't even like chocolate frosting! This recipe is so creamy and decadent, but not to sweet. It's made easier by using coco powder rather melting bakers chocolate (most recipes I found used that instead) Any one can make this frosting and have their cake turn out with a professional quality (decorating skill aside, I am a beginner lol) I highly recommend this recipe! This will be used by me from now on! For the few people who said it was to sweet must have sensitive taste buds because this wasn't to sweet in the least.

This is the first time I have ever made a homemade frosting. I used it to top brownies. It is a true winner! It is smooth and creamy and tastes wonderful. I will use this recipe time and time again.

Mmmm!  Easy, quick, and yummy.  Very soft, light texture. I scaled it to 8 servings, frosted 9 cupcakes and had almost half left.  Will be good on graham crackers.  And on a spoon.  Like many others did and the recipe suggests, I added several extra tbls of milk to get the right consistency.

This frosting is amazing! I changed the serving size to 8 and had enough to frost the outside of my 2 layer cake with some extra. I filled the cake with some pastry cream. I added in a melted bar of my favorite chocolate and that gave it a great extra chocolate flavor. It also cut out some of the milk I needed to make it spreadable. Will defiantly use this recipe again!

Perfect! This recipe is so good, and it is the favorite of everyone in my family. My husband likes really rich, chocolatey frosting, and I can't stand super sweet frosting, and this suits us both perfectly. I do scale back a bit on the sugar, and add a dash of salt, but that's just a matter of taste.  I never use any other chocolate frosting, this is good enough to eat with a spoon!

It was too sweet and kind of rich, although had a great texture. I scaled down the recipe to 8 servings to go on top of the Best Brownies recipe, and there was some left over. It's a good thing I like my brownies not-very-sweet, or else this would have been too much sugar. It was altogether a little too rich- I could only eat one brownie (out of 25). I cut down the cocoa so that it was a one-to-four ratio of butter to sugar.

So good! DH doesn't like frosting that's too sweet but he liked this one. I halved the recipe to frost 24 cupcakes. I used a bag and tip to pipe the frosting on to make it pretty! I sifted the cocoa but should had done the sugar also. That way it would be lump free!

While it does have a very rich flavor, I had a problem getting mine to mix well.. :/. Ive made tons of frosting before, and maybe I Just added the dry ingredients too quickly, or didn't beat it well enough each time, but the end product still had little chunks of cocoa tha I just couldn't get to mix in...bummer.

We loved this frosting. I paired it with the Black Magic Cake recipe on this site, and they were a great complement to one another. This makes a great deal of frosting; I frosted a big 9 x 13 inch cake, and had tons of frosting leftover. This will be my go-to chocolate frosting recipe from now on - very rich and creamy with a great flavor, and easy to make too, but next time I'll cut the recipe in half. Thanks for a great recipe.

Sorry to say, but I really didn't care for this frosting at all. I followed the recipe to the letter, and the strong flavor of the cocoa just wasn't for us. Also, big mistake I made was to refigerate the cake after I frosted using this, and it was like fudge. I also had to use more milk than what the recipe called for. I'm sorry but I will not make this again, but thank you for sharing though.

Wow!  I was in a hurry, thought the sugar was a bit much, but in a hurry, I didn't think.  The result was tons of excellent frosting for my chocolate cake.  Now, I have another excuse to bake as I need to use up the frosting or will it keep for any length of time.  Lovin' it.

pretty darn tasty, and really easy. Required a lot more milk than the recipe said, and mine got a little lumpy, but the flavor is decent. Its a little bitter from the cocoa, but overall, its a nice frosting for the level of effort that it requires.

This is one of the best icings I have tried. Not too sweet and spreads great. Like another reviewer I only had marg on hand but it turned out great. Cut servings to 8 and there was more than enough for a 13 x 9 cake.

I scaled the recipe to 4 serves (which was enough to frost 12 cupcakes, I don't like a HUGE amount of frosting on my cupcakes). I reduced sugar by 2 T and reduced cocoa by 1 T. This was because it seemed like it would be impossible to mix anymore in. It was BRILLIANT. Perfect amount of milk if the dry ingredients are reduced a little bit. Not too sweet (I added a pinch of salt) and excellent consistency for frosting (especially for a first-time decorator like me!).

I thought this icing was really good with a strong cocoa flavor.   I used it on the Black Magic cake from this site.  My husband was not such a big fan - a little too strong cocoa taste.  I think I will probably stick with a buttercream using melted chocolate next time.

O.M.G. !! I used 4 cups of powdered sugar instead of 9, and added a pinch of salt to cut the sweetness. Also added a TBS or two more of milk as it was creaming. INCREDIBLE! Very smooth, silky and delicious. Thanks for sharing!

Good!  But it is VERY cocoa-y...I halved it and had way too much for a 9x13 cake.  Would try putting in 12 in the # of servings and then leaving out the tbs of cocoa if you needed it for a 9x13 cake.  Overall though, consistency is wonderful.  Thanks!

Made half of this recipe and still had extra for my 9x13 cake.  The overall product was excellent but the amounts were a tad off.  I ended up adding about 1.5 c milk and only 4 cups sugar.  Possibly will make this again.

This was okay-I halved it and added 2 tbsps of milk at a time (but did not need to exceed the 1/2 cup needed). It was super sugary, and I probably could have cut the amount of powdered sugar. I made a very tall 2-tiered 9" cake and kept piling the icing on...and I still had to eat some plain to avoid waste-next time I'm definitely going to make cupcakes or something to use up the extra icing. Kind of felt sick after eating so much sugar...

Excellent! My only suggestion for those having trouble with the color of the frosting is to invest in some higher quality cocoa. The Ghiradelli's stuff can be found at most grocery stores and the price is often comparable to Hershey's.

This is a wonderful chocolate frosting. Straight out of the mixer it feels a tiny bit greasy in my mouth. My perfect frosting would be somewhat more fudgy with a mouth-feel more akin to a truffle. Sticking it in the refrigerator seemed to help quite a bit to produce a nicer mouth feel.  (Also, I quartered this recipe for a smallish sheet cake and that was a perfect amount.  For a darker chocolate, choose a Dutch process cocoa. More expensive, but very pleasing results.

I was initially discouraged by others' reviews about a dull color but went ahead and halved the exact recipe to frost a 9-inch layer cake.  I used Trader Joe's Cocoa Powder and it made a nice, dark rich frosting.  There was enough for a generous frosting with enough left-over to satisfy my kids' desire to lick the bowl.  This will be my go-to chocolate frosting recipe--we all really like it.

I just made this frosting for our Superbowl cake. It is AMAZING! I had to hurry and frost the cake because the kids wouldn't leave it alone. Simple and delicious recipe. I halved the recipe, and it was perfect for a 9x13 cake.

THERE WERE SO MANY RAVE REVIEWS AND THE MORE CHOCOLATEY THE BETTER.I KEPT DOUBLE CHECKING THE RECIPE TO SEE IF I HAD MADE A MISTAKE.I MADE 1/2 THE RECIPE AND ENDED UP USING TEN CUPS OF POWDERED SUGAR RATHER THAN 4 1/2.  IT JUST WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SWEET ENOUGH OTHERWISE.

This frosting is awesome!  I was making peanut butter cupcakes and I needed a chocolate frosting, so I cut the recipe in half and had more than enough to ice 24 cupcakes.  My husband wants this icing on his next birthday cake, he said it was so good.

I got really frustrated when I made this frosting because I did not heed the warnings of HALVING the recipe. By the time I was done I had confectioners' sugar and cocoa all over the  kitchen, and myself. Powdered  is tricky (it likes to leap at you and cut off your air supply), so please, for the sake of your sanity, split the recipe. Make in two bowls if you really need all the frosting this sucker makes.   All in all the frosting was SO delicious. Everyone raved and asked for more.  Will definitely put in my recipe book.

I did not like this frosting at all. My guests seemed to like it or they were just being polite. It tasted like cocoa powder. I would have been better off putting canned frosting on my cake.

Whoa--this is quite possibly the best frosting I've ever had in my life!!!  When I gathered my ingredients, I realized that I didn't have enough cocoa. It was the night before Thanksgiving so of course the grocery store had sold out of everything except some expensive Dutch import--$9 for 8 oz! But after I tasted it, OH MY GOD! It was worth every penny! I'm sure it's good with regular cocoa--which I'd probably use for every day baking--but I think I'll use the import (which has a more potent flavor) for special occasions. I made a half batch since I was only baking 1 cake. I still had enough left over for 12 cupcakes. Follow the directions and you cannot go wrong.

Name sums it up well. It is a very rich frosting with tons of chocolate flavor. I used half and half instead of milk since it was already out of the fridge. Will be go to for a awesome chocolate frosting.

SOO good!  My cake that I made this for did not turn out, but I couldn't help but eat this icing off of it!  It got better every day that the flavors melded together.  At first it tasted really cocoa-y like dark chocolate, but as a couple of days passed it turned into a really rich, chocolatey flavor.  Just plain good!

Really good icing. Just don't serve your cake right out of the fridge or the icing will be hard. I personally don't like the icing in between the slabs of cake to be hard as though I put chocolate bars in the cake. At room temperature this icing is creamy and delicious. Use it on the one bowl chocolate cake III and the cake will be done so fast you will not have the need to put it in the fridge. Loved it!

Absolutely the BEST chocolate frosting recipe I've ever made. I used the servings calculator to cut it to 16 servings and I had plenty to frost a two layer cake (I actually had some leftover frosting). I used this on the Too Much Chocolate cake recipe on this site and everyone at the party raved about it.

Used it to top One Bowl Chocolate Cake III and it was excellent -- only needed 1/2 the recipe (used a raspberry filling).   Spread nice, piped nicely, held up well.

This was my first try at chocolate frosting and this will probably become my standard for now on. Perfect. I didn't have to change a thing (though I did cut it in half, it was only for cupcakes).

Really the best chocolate frosting I've ever made or eaten.  It's very cocoa-y, which is its appeal and makes it important to use really good cocoa.  Like others say, half the recipe for a two-layer 9 inch round cake.

This is the second best chocolate frosting I have ever tasted, and the best I have made. I halved the recipe, and it frosted my two layer 9 in cake with just a little left over. My picky father even said that it was really, really good. Will most certainly use again, thank you!

I gave this 5 stars but i also changed quite a bit, i added only half the powered sugar(halfway when i tasted it, i realized if i added more it would have been way too sweet) but that is just semantics. The cocoa powder gives it a really nice darker chocolate vibe and its a really creamy albeit thick frosting-it is great for formal style cakes(literally perfect for grooms cakes like said above or anything fancy) the frosting holds up well refrigerated on the cake as well.

I won't buy canned again.  I never attempted or thought to make my own...just seemed easier to buy it but this has changed my mind.  It's even fool proof.  I started making it when I remembered that I had wanted to half the recipe.  I ended up using 4 sticks of butter, 5 cups powdered sugar, 1.5 cups cocoa, vanilla and some milk.  Still tasted great.  More like milk chocolate which was an even bigger hit.

Wow!  This is devilish!  Great recipe.  Used this on chocolate cupcakes and have to say this may have been TOO much chocolate.  I know, hard to do, right?  I will probably use this for a yellow or white cake and let this frosting be the standout chocolate flavor.  A word of warning; when you start to add the sugar/chocolate/vanilla, you will think you've done something wrong, because it just doesn't look right.  But stick with it.  The milk smoothes everything out and gives you a spectacular result.  Thanks, Amy!

Amazing recipe!  I used a bit more vanilla than called for.  I was skeptical of the amount of cocoa called for but it worked out so wonderfully.  Very rich, very indulgent.  I did have to thin out with a bit of milk to make the frosting more spreadable -- it was quite thick.

I have tried a number of chocolate icings/frostings from this site and this ones was by far the best.  Perfect on cupcakes or to frost a layer cake. I did add a bit more cocoa as others suggested to bump up the chocolate flavour and I was not disappointed!

I doubt words can adequately describe how incredible this frosting is!  This is my second time making this recipe.  Each time, I made the full recipe, figuring I'd just frost my cake really generously. This is, by far, the best frosting I've come across, in terms of spreading consistency.  I dread icing the sides of cakes -- especially layer cakes, but this did the job beautifully.    I used this recipe to frost David's Yellow Cake, and the two made a great combination, although the cake turned out a bit dry.  I believe that this frosting was the cake's redeeming quality.  I made this for my hubby's co-worker's birthday, and while I used the majority of the frosting on the cake, I did have some leftovers, which I scooped into a tupperware and gave to my hubby to take with him to work, figuring there were some frosting lovers out there who'd appreciate being able to spread the leftovers on their slices of cake.  He told me that by that afternoon, the cake was gone, and the tupperware of frosting was being passed around the office, and folks were eating it by itself, with spoons.  Guess it was a hit.  Thanks for a great recipe!  This will remain my go-to recipe, as far as cake frosting is concerned.  :-)

This is without a doubt the best chocolate frosting I have ever put in my mouth, and my mom agrees. I have used this both on white and chocolate cakes, and no matter what you put it on, it will just make the cake! This recipe as is makes a ton of frosting, though. It is enough to frost at least 3 2-layer 9-inch cakes. It keeps very well in the refrigerator, though. A helpful note - if you're going to be doing any decorating with this frosting, allow it to set in the refrigerator for 5 or 10 minutes first, as it can get a bit runny. And I wouldn't focus on using the 1 cup of milk. Just add it gradually until you reach the desired consistency.

I made this frosting to go with a chocolate cake (for my 2yr daughter's Birthday). It turned out sand-like texture(not creamy at all even though I mixed it for at least 10 minutes). It doesn't have any chocolate flavor. I regretted that I didn't make frosting with heavy whipping cream & chocolate chips. I ended up by asking my husband to buy a birthday cake to replace it. Sorry to say, but I don't understand why people like so much this frosting.

This was awesome. I used half the recipe for 2 dozen cupcakes.  I added less milk because I was piping the frosting on in a swirl pattern and wanted it to hold it's shape.  I will be making this again!

Wonderful!  I used a whole bag of powered sugar (7.5 Cups, if you don't want to measure) Plus 1 additional and thought it was the right amount of sweet.  So 8.5 cups total.  It was very tasty.  Made this in my Kitchen Aid Artisan Stand Mixer.  Worked wonderfully.  Tons of compliments.  Best Ever.  This is my HG for Chocolate Frosting.

This recipe makes a ton. I made it exactly as stated with the exception of using 1 3/4 c cocoa instead of the full amount. I used it on a bundt cake and I could easily frost 4 or 5 cakes with the amount this recipe calls for. Didn't care for the taste. My two young daughters wouldn't finish theirs as they didn't like the taste either and when a kid won't finish cake there is something wrong. The cake was awesome (One Bowl Chocolate Cake III)- too bad frosting wasn't. I like more of a milk chocolate flavor which may be why we didn't like it. Also -the butter mixed in with the powdered sugar and then the cocoa is hard to combine. Once the milk is added it is much easier to mix together. Oh well- onto the next frosting!

I cut this recipe in half and it was plenty to frost a two layer 9" cake. The frosting was really, really rich--duh, as indicated by the title.  Next time, I may use this to just use in between layers, but to frost an entire cake with it was just a bit much. Also, it didn't seem to pipe very well, but I could have added to much milk. Still very, very good!

I made this recipe to put on Chocolate Zucchini Cake III from this site.  It tasted great!  I ran out of cocoa so I used double Nesquik Chocolate Milk Mix powder to substitute.  I also used a brick of Margarine in stead of butter.  I found I could still pipe this frosting really well.

Sweet and chocolatey without being excessively rich. Add a touch of salt (or use salted butter) and this recipe is perfect! As others have said, halve the recipe to get more than enough for a 9" layer cake.

Fudge-y, creamy, delicious!  I scaled it back to 12 servings and was able to frost 26 cupcakes and still had about a cup of frosting left over.  I used the Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa and it tastes like a brownie, EXACTLY what I was looking for.  It is definitely for those who want their frosting to taste chocolaty and not just be brown.

Excellent!  I quartered the recipe (8 servings) for generously frosting 12 cupcakes and still had plenty left over.  I didn't add any extra milk, since spreading isn't much of an issue for cupcakes, and I loved the way it dolloped.

so so so good. Used to frost One Bowl Chocolate Cake III also on this site.  I actually didn't have enough cocoa powder for what the recipe called for, but it still tasted superb - like a wendy's frosty!! yummy!  I will make again with the full recommended cocoa powder amount, which I'm sure will taste just as good if not better!

I made this for a cake I took to work...it was demolished.  I "halved" the recipe and used 4 1/4 c. sugar and 1 1/2 c cocoa; it made it very fudgy and not overly sweet.  Also, very easy!! YUMMY!!

I was scared it would be too sweet, but I loved it. I put it on chocolate cake and served it with ice cream. You need the ice cream because it's rich, but delicious!

This frosting was really good.  It had a dense, chocolate flavor that reminded me of a canned chocolate frosting but better flavor.  If you want something fluffy with a delicate flavor this probably isn't the recipe for you.  I cut the recipe in half and that was plenty for frosting a 9" two tiered cake with extra for piping a simple border.  It definitely has a strong chocolate flavor - next time I might cut back on the cocoa just a bit.  I also ended up using more milk, probably 3/4 cup total (adding slowly a tablespoon at a time while blending) to get the right consistency.  I will keep this on file when I need a rich chocolate frosting!

This frosting is as rich as the title says it is! Fabulous, decadent, chocolatey---perfect! I think this one beats my usual chocolate frosting by a long shot! I'll be using this one from now on =)

I halved this recipe and it was just enough to frost 20 large cupcakes. The only thing I changed was once everything was mixed together I beat it all for about 5 minutes until it was more "whipped". I will definitely use this recipe again! Great flavor.

excellent! i made a couple substitutionsto use stuff I had on hand. I used some coffee liquor with the milk to add more flavor, and I used these choco flavored nestle packets, I have been trying to use them up they are unsweetened chocolate flavored somethimng or another. Icut the butter because the choco things could be sub for the powderr and oil. It worked great. I cut the recipe in half, iced 1 two layer cake and have plenty left over.

I used half regular baking cocoa and half of the dark chocolate variety -- YUM!  I cut back on the sugar -- not on purpose, but I alternated adding the sugar and milk, testing along the way.  I felt if I added the remainder of the sugar it would have been too sweet and taken away from the chocolate flavor.  That's my personal preference, so I would suggest you test along the way.  :-)

I made a 12-serving version of this instead of 32 to frost about 30-40 cupcakes. This is absolutely delicious! I cut out 1/3 cup of the powdered sugar, and used 1/4 cup of heavy cream, and 1/4 cup of Kahlua for a thicker consistency, and richer, adult taste. I frosted "Too much chocolate cake" found on this website. Truly a winner!

I love this frosting! I halved the recipe to use it for 12 cupcakes and had a lot left over. I put in slightly less sugar because I don't like things super sweet and used unsalted butter. yum :)

This is a great frosting!I used Hershey's Dark Chocolate Cocoa to make it even richer. This goes well with David's Yellow Cake (also on allrecipes.com), but I have to tell you. The frosting makes the cake. You will be glad you tried it!!

Paired with the one bowl chocolate cake recipe also from this site.  It was heavenly.  I halved the recipe, it was perfect for the 9" 2layer cake.  I love that it is not too sweet.

By far and away this is the best recipe for frosting that I have ever had.  
I did sift the cocoa and sugar. By making for 12 it was more than enough for cupcakes.

Very good! I scaled down the  recipe for 16 servings which was plenty to frost a two layer 9" round cake. I also pre-sifted the confectioners sugar with the cocoa and used half evaporated milk, half water. Delish!

This was a fantastic recipe.  Any time I want a chocolate frosting for cupcakes or brownies, this is the recipe I use.  I sometimes add 1/2 tsp of coconut extract to make it extra special.

Umm...WOW.  Only need 1/2 recipe (16 servings) to generously frost a 2 layer round cake...although making the recipe in the indicated amounts would leave lots of frosting to eat!!! THIS IS CHOCOLATE FROSTING AS IT SHOULD BE!!!  You will never buy a can of frosting again...

I loved this recipe! This has an incredibly rich, chocolate taste an reminds me of a chocolate ganache. I used this on a rich chocolate cake (per my usband's birthday cake request) and it was a little too over the top. I would recommend using this on a simpler yellow cake to let the flavor of the frostig stand on its own.

My absolute standby chocolate frosting. I put it on everything, and watch people roll their eyes in pure, chocolate ecstasy. It can be a bit messy to make, but it's worth the clean-up. Try it with the 'One Bowl Chocolate Cake III', or any other homemade chocolate cake. This may sound a bit snobby, but I think that it's kinda wasted on a plain box chocolate cake mix. I tried it once, and found myself picking the frosting off and leaving the cake on the plate...

Really sweet - wanna try to let it sit in fridge overnight to see if it helps mellow the flavor at all; about 10 servings should be enough for a regular one-layer cake

Absolutely delicious.  I put this on a plain old fudge layer cake from a box and it was fantastic.  I didn't have buter on-hand so I used margarine and it was still great!

Absolutely one of the best chocolate frostings I've ever tried. The recipe as given makes A LOT of frosting and is difficult to work with in my opinion, due to the bulk of it. Other reviewers were correct - half this recipe if you just want to frost a normal size dessert. I only needed to frost two 9" layers and I had far too much left over.

This frosting has a good flavor but I didn't like the consistency. I was looking for a fudgy frosting and this one is more of a whipped frosting. I think I'll keep looking...

I've made this several times now, and every time I frost a cake with it people always say the frosting is so good  that they would eat it on its own. I think the key is using a good cocoa powder. I am an American in Denmark and its pretty easy to find good cocoa here. I also use salted butter. I think the small amount of salt helps to balance the sugar.

Wonderful frosting if you are a true chocolate lover and like the taste of cocoa (which I do).  I made half the recipe and it was more than enough for a 9 x 13 cake.

So simple to make, tastes delicious. If you scale this recipe down to 4 servings, it makes about a bowl full, or enough to frost a small square cake. Make sure to measure the vanilla extract exactly; too much or too little changes the taste of the frosting a lot.

Great frosting, the one alteration I've found that makes it incredible is to go find the best chocolate milk you can find and use it as the milk.

This is my go to recipe for chocolate frosting. I always cut the recipe in 1/2 just due to not needing that much frosting. I read a review that gave 4 stars just because they halved it. LOL!!  Are you kidding me? Another gave it 3 stars because their cocoa powder was gritty. Is that the recipes issue? Nope. Get better cocoa powder.

This is very good for spreading and okay for piping-a little too soft to really hold the piping design-but the flavor is great. My kids thought it was the best frosting for our dark chocolate cupcakes. I scaled it to half and it easily covered 24 cupcakes.

I used 7 C of confectioner's sugar. This made a good texture to the frosting, without making it sickly sweet. When I paired this frosting with the One Bowl Chocolate Cake, together the cake reminded me of a Wegman's chocolate cake. Definitely not it exactly, but reminiscent.

Even though I forgot to add the vanilla extract, this frosting was still delicious! I used it to frost a 2 layer 9 inch cake (Black Magic Cake, from this site) and a boxed yellow cake in a bundt pan; it came out fantastic. I used all of the milk and it was an easily spreadable consistency. I had no problems with a crust forming and followed the recipe. I made 3/4 of the recipe and had plenty remaining. Perfect excuse to make more baked goodies to use this wonderful frosting up! Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

Sooooooo wonderful.  So creamy.  So chocolatey.  This recipe makes a LOT.  You may want to scale it down depending what your plans are.  Use this to frost the recipe "Chocolate Lovers' Favorite Cake" which is also choco nirvana.  For variation, try almond extract in place of vanilla or add a bit of instant espresso.
Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

Awesome homemade frosting...I added an extra teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.  After reading the reviews on it being grainy, I beat it with an electric mixer for a couple minutes...it turned out totally smooth and creamy.  Definately a keeper!

SOOOOO yummy.  I make half a batch and it covers all of my three layer cake.  However, I usually make 3/4 of a recipe so that I can secretly have an extra container of it in my fridge to sneak spoonfuls of throughout the week. Teehee.  BEST CHOCOLATE FROSTING EVER - just make half a batch.

Great chocolate frosting with powdered sugar!  Substituted unsweetened chocolate for cocoa and melted with butter and it was fabulous!  Not always a fan of powdered sugar icings but this one will be used again!  Thanks!

really nice frosting. using a kitchen aid really made it a snap. I goofed and added cocoa that makes hot chocolate -- and since it was sweetened with white sugar it left a little grit. I made up for it by adding a little coffee to replace the milk, and that made it amazing. I think I could have used the hot cocoa chocolate if I would have heated it up to melt the sugar first and then cooled it to use in the frosting. Very tasty!

This recipe was excellent. We cut the recipe in half for 16 servings. We used un-sweetened cocoa, which left the frosting bitter, so we added a glaze of liquid sugar which made the frosting perfect. The glaze was made simply by mixing sugar and water in a sauce pan, then setting it aside for ten minutes to cool and thicken.

This frosting is delicious. I followed the recommendation of letting the frosting sit in the refrigerator for a few hours to reduce the cocoa flavor. It's not to sweet and has a smooth creamy texture.

I adjusted the serving size to 8 and still ended up with way too much for my 9 inch round cake. I had only about 5 tbs of cocoa powder left, but even so it was still very chocolatey and delicious!!

Not quite as good as store bought, but definitely a good substitute!  Next time my 3-year old wants to make cupcakes out of the blue... I will use a little less cocoa because the said amount is a little much.

Wonderful frosting.  At first I thought it had too much cocoa, but then the more I tasted it I couldn't stop eating it.  Only made half the recipe and it generously iced a 9x13 cake.

I was pretty disappointed in this recipe.  It just didn't have much flavor.  I made it exactly as directed, and then finding it disappointing, I added about a teaspoon of salt (this sounds like a lot, but this recipe makes a HUGE amount of frosting, enough to frost at least two layer cakes), two ounces of melted baking chocolate, 1/4 cup cream, and about 2/3 cup additional powdered sugar.  This made it better, but still nothing to go crazy for.

Very yummy!!  Only made half the recipe and turned out great.  Very yummy.  Only advice add some milk with icing sugar and cocoa, the icing sugar stuck to the sides and had to scrap it off. It was too dry without adding milk in between.

I ate almost all of the frosting before I started frosting anything (scaled to 4 servings... but still!!). Epic. Chocolate. Goodness. Here's what I changed: Scaled to 4 servings (so these changes apply to the scaled proportions), only 1 cup of powdered sugar, subbed 2 ounces of Lindt Excellence 85% cocoa chocolate for the baking cocoa, upped the vanilla to 1/2 a teaspoon. If I could hook myself up to a chocolate i.v. drip I would, it's THAT kind of delicious. WOW.

This is fantastic frosting! I needed something easy to pair with a Cupcake for Two recipe, and scaled the 32 servings down to 2 - it worked perfectly. Really tasty frosting, just the right amount of chocolate/sweet.

Fantastic! Best frosting recipe I've tried, even came out better than my mothers. I made this the day before and it only improved in flavor over the next couple of days. I halved the recipe and still had extra that we dipped strawberries in the next day. Went great on a chocolate cake with a strawberry filling.

This is a very good basic recipe that you can tweak to fit your tastes. I didn't want a super-sweet frosting, so I cut back on the sugar and added a tinsy bit more cocoa. I didn't have any milk, so I substituted sour cream and it was DELICIOUS. Very creamy, fluffy, and smooth. I only made 1/4 of the recipe after reading the reviews, and it was enough for a layered 9-inch cake. Yum!

yummy! I also made a half batch, and it was enough for about 24 cupcakes. Only warning - when I was adding milk it quickly turned from the rich chocolate-y goodness to milk chocolate. I needed the full amount of milk to get the proper consistency for my cupcakes. Next time, I will up the cocoa.

I like this recipe.  The first time I made it I used Ghirardelli cocoa powder and it was really good.  The second time I used Hershey's and it had a more buttercream taste like some others have mentioned.  I think I'll try the Hershey's Special Dark dutched cocoa next time.  I originally rated this 5 stars but I'm changing my rating only because of the serving size mentioned in this recipe.  It's ridiculous.  It yields double what it says.  I wish I had paid more attention to the other reviews.

I'd like to say I made this exactly as the recipe states, but I forgot to add the vanilla.  Also, I threw it all in the bowl and mixed all at once. Hands down the best chocolate frosting I've ever had.

best. frosting. ever. My only regret is that I didn't sift the sugar and cocoa powder before adding it. I ended up with a few lumps, other than that, it was a fantastic spreadable texture, and simply delicious. Why have I ever bought frosting when this is SO much better??? P.S. as other reviews suggested, I halved the recipe and it was the perfect amount.

This is so delicious! My kids are frosting the cupcakes right now and I couldn't wait to put in a review. We didn't have butter, so we used 70% Vegetable Oil Spread. To make sure there were no clumps, we sifted the powdered sugar and cocoa. The texture is perfect ~ so easy for the kids to spread. We also halved the recipe and I'm sure there's going to be a ton left over. Mmmmm.

i LOVE this frosting. it was easy to make and turned out perfectly. I also like how it stays creamy. I've made frostings in the past that tend to get a bit crusty feeling on the outside (which i can't stand) but with this recipe, the frosting stayed perfect the entire time the cake was in tact....which wasnt that long might I add, because everyone gobbled the cake up really fast! :) but GREAT recipe...this is going to be my only chocolate frosting recipe from now one. :)

Fantastically Rich Frosting!!  This recipe is VERY sweet and rich!! I used Ghiradelli Cocoa and Half and Half instead of milk.  I like a "whipped" frosting, so I whipped this really good and added extra half and half at the end to soften the frosting.  I cut this recipe in half and frosted 24 cupcakes with some frosting left over.

I used whipping cream instead of milk...it makes it thicker..so that's just a tip if you want a heavier frosting!

Excellent frosting.  Sure beats the store ought ones.  Has just the right sweetness.  If you reduce the recipe in half (16 servings) it gives you plenty to frost a two layer cake with frosting in the middle.  I quartered the recipe (8 servings) and spread cherry pie filling between lays to cut back on the sweetness.

I took this down to one bag of powdered sugar (~7.5c) and it was absolutely amazing.  It's easy to spread and then put in the refrigerator and sets up really nicely on the cake.  I added a splash of almond extract.  Definitely a keeper!!  Very chocolatey without being bitter...

Fantastic. My only issue was a slight graininess to the texture (does anyone know how to fix this?); otherwise this was creamy and rich, with GREAT chocolate flavor! Tasted wonderful on the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III from this site.

This frosting was very easy to make, and easily spreadable (I let it sit for about 10 min before frosting), the cake frosting was a quick breeze.  But I thought the taste was way to cocoa-ish (I made the recipe exact).  I put it on a chocolate cake I have made famous, that I usually put buttercream frosting on, and I thought this frosting brought the cake down.  I think I will look for a recipe with real chocolate, not cocoa next time.

This recipe came to my rescue when i threw out a way too sweet store bought frosting.This is the absolute best chocolate frosting ever.I didn't have butter so i used margarine. I decreased the amount of sugar and cocoa powder slighty and i used heavy cream instead of milk. this was sinfully delicious and so creamy and fluffy. I made enough for 8 servings and still had some left over after i frosted my cake. I am ashamed to say that i couldn't stop eating the frosting! Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe

If cakes could dream, they would dream of being slathered in this buttery, chocolaty goodness.  Perfect for from-scratch cakes as this requires very little fuss or extra time in the kitchen.  Also leaves room for variations, as other reviewers have noted.  Thanks to Amy Via for the recipe!

Awesome, tripled the amount of vanilla.  Half batch not enough to icing 8 inch layer cake as per other reviews I read.  Better off making full batch and freezing the rest for future use like cupcakes or smaller cake.

Originally, this was to be used to cover my 3 layer round cake. I was going to use something else as the filling, and thought this would be great for all over. Long story short, the fillling I was going to use for in between my layers didn't work out. I am so glad I made a full (and didn't half the recipe) batch of this frosting, because it saved my cake! I had enough frosting for my 3 layer, 9 inch round cake! I am soooo glad I found this recipe! I followed everything exactly, accept, it tasted soooo great without the cocoa I didn't even put it in the frosting. Do not add any of the milk until the end, that way you can determine how thick you like it! I will use this recipe for all of my cakes! Like I said you can keep it plain or add the cocoa, it still will taste amazing!

Greeaaatttt chocolate frosting.  Rich and creamy.  I used this to frost peanut butter cupcakes, but it was a little too sweet for that.  Will definitely make this again, but use on white or devils food cake. YUM

I was looking for a creamy chocolate frosting & this is it! I had to scale it down to 8 servings, just enough to frost a 9x13 sheet cake. It is just perfectly chocolatey & sweet. It'll be the one i use from now on.

This chocolate frosting recipe is absolutely fabulous.  I made it for a cake to take to work for a co-worker's birthday and everyone loved it.   It definitely makes A LOT though.  I had to half the recipe and it was still almost too much for a three layer cake.  The taste and consistency is perfect though! Thanks.

This frosting is delicious! I halved the recipe, except for the vanilla extract and milk (used the full tsp of vanilla and almost a whole cup of milk with the other ingredients halved).  I sifted the sugar and cocoa together as another reviewer suggested.  I used this to frost a regular-sized single layer yellow cake (9x13) and I still had some left over.   I may use boxed cake mixes at times, but I refuse to use the canned frosting. To me that stuff is just nasty.  But this frosting recipe is a keeper that helps makes any cake taste like "from scratch"!  Thanks Amy!  And btw, don't rate a recipe based on "a bit too much butter I thought", especially when you agree that it's tasty. You saw the amount of butter the recipe calls for BEFORE you made it. If it bothered you then you shouldn't have made it to begin with. :)

I had to add in some more butter because the frosting was looking kind of dry. Also cut out a bit of confectioners' sugar. I beat it for a very long time so it got nice and fluffy. A nice, bittersweet frosting!

I made 1/4 batch of this recipe, smothered it on top of 24 cupcakes (1 box mix), and had frosting left over.  I would definitely consider how much frosting you need before making an entire batch.  I would also recommend using the heaviest milk you can.  The frosting was definitely tasty, but not quite good enough for a full 5 stars :)

One of the best chocolate frosting recipes I have ever tried. It came out perfect. Not too much chocolate, not too much butter. And it didn't take very long at all. Awesome. I did half the recipe and was able to frost 1 cake and had enough to do another half a cake or some cupcakes or even a tray of brownies. Yum. Thanks for a great recipe!

Really great and very simple recipe for frosting.  Perfect light texture (almost like a whipped frosting) and wonderful flavor.  I made 12 servings instead of 32 and it was enough to cover an 8x8 pan of brownies with about a cup leftover.

This frosting is delicious!!  It has become our family favorite.  I use Hershey's Dark Chocolate Cocoa Cocoa.  So easy too!!  It's hard not to just sit and eat it out of the bowl.  Goes great on Dark Chocolate Cake II by: Kellygurll on the allrecipes website.  Thanks for a great recipe, Amy!!

I halved the recipe and it made way too much to frost a 9 inch layer cake. I had about 2 c. leftover after frosting. It was a very thick frosting, definitely needed more than the 1/2 c. milk as listed in the 1/2 recipe. While it tasted good, it was very rich and turned off my husband from eating more than one bite! I didn't like that it was a dull chocolate color. I expected some sheen to it with all that butter! I don't think I will be making this recipe again for my chocolate cakes. Too much butter and too much cocoa I think.

Oh..my..god this is so good.  I was extremely skeptical considering it had so little liquid but it worked beautifully! I was so proud of myself for making a good batch of frosting for the first time.  I paired this with Dark Chocolate Cake I from this site and it was fantastic.  I let the frosting sit out while I baked the cake and it took a lot of hand slaps to get my husband from eating up the frosting before making it onto the cake!  We were both seriously impressed, 5 stars for every angle: can follow the steps to the T, great taste, great spreading, you name it and I love that I don't have to buy chocolate for this because I always have cocoa in the cupbard. Thanks so much for the upload!  I will make this over and over.

I just really did not like this recipe. I don't know what it is and I followed the recipe exactly. It came out just like it was supposed to but the texture was 'mousse-like' and by that I mean it was almost like eating a malt. I also did not like the chocolate taste. Maybe I will try again but that might be a lot of ingredients to waste. More power to the people who enjoy this one.

Excellent rich chocolate frosting.  I only made half of a batch as the other reviewers suggested and there was more than enough for a 2 layer round cake, and I do like a lot of frosting on my cake.

This frosting is amazing.  The best chocolate frosting I have ever tasted.  It is so easy to make too.  This makes a TON of frosting though.  Split the recipe in half for  2 - 8" round cakes stacked with frosting in the middle.  It's very creamy and has the perfect balance of chocolatey richness and smooth creaminess, not overly sugary like a lot of buttercreams are.

Hail to the frosting gods. I am subject to your every whim! Absolutely marvelous, There is nothing wrong wtih this recipe what so ever! So I strongly recommend not touching it at all, just prepare it the way it says it should be prepared and you are golden!!! I cannot stop myself from dragging my finger through the dark mound of frosty goodness and scooping out a heaping morsel so that I may savor every second of its whipped goodness!!! Thanks for such a great recipe, this will be my staple. :o)

HEAVENLY i used it on a chocolate yule log. i didnt add much extra milk--just 2 tablespoons (i like my icing stiff). When you refridgerate this on your cake, the icing is stiff and soooo yummy. AMAZING. i cut it down to 8 servings (which uses 1/2 cup of butter) and it was a little more than a tub of small betty crocker icing. AMAZING!

I made a mini cupcake wedding cake for my brother's wedding and everyone loved the frosting.  My friends and I even had a frosting "break" while we were making preparations for the wedding.  This is also easy to work with and it stayed put perfectly.  I used butter flavor crisco instead of butter and it was still really good.

This recipe is aptly named because it is very rich and chocolatey.  I think this is much better than the recipe on the back of the Hershey's can of baking cocoa.

It was great the first day, but the true flavor took about 3 days to come in. It tastes just like FUDGE on day 3! I will use this over and over, but I will make sure I prepare it a couple days early!

Most awesome fudgy frosting I have ever made! I used it to frost the outside of a 14 layer cake I made.  I had a bunch left over, and used it as an inside filling for fudge truffles (dipped in almond bark coating)  Just used a small scoop, froze em, dipped 'em and done! Very good and very pretty!

YUM YUM YUM.  I halved the recipe and even had some left over after frosting a 2 layer, 9" cake.  I paired this with the "Black Magic Cake" also available on this site.    I will make this again.......so good.

This frosting was a wonderful compliment to the "One Bowl Chocolate Cake" recipe from this site.  It is smooth, creamy and has a wonderful deep chocolate flavor.  The only change I made was to use whipping cream instead of the milk.  It made the frosting just a little fluffier and not so dense.  Also, if you refrigerate the cake, make sure to bring it to room temperature before serving because the icing gets a little hard. This is a keeper though for sure.

Fantastic recipe. I used Green & Blacks organic cocoa and played with the measurements a bit. Truly wonderful and definitely a keeper. Thanks

This icing is perfect for decorating. It is very fluffy, but it holds it's shape well. I halved the recipe, but I didn't really care for the flavor, so I gave it 4 stars. I added more butter and a bit more vanilla, and I liked it after that. I'm just not much for the cocoa-y flavor at all. This is a great recipe, just not my personal taste. I will definitely use it again with my tweeks.

This frosting is pretty good. It was easier to work with than i thought. The only thing that bothers me is the cocoa powder taste, but that was probably my fault.

This frosting is superb! I have made it several times now. It has replaced my original chocolate frosting recipe. It's so good that when my father tried it, he declared it his new favorite frosting (his prior favorite was the buttercream recipe on the Domino confectioners sugar box).

This is so easy and fast to make and everyone loves it.  Very adaptable for any minor changes you want to make.  Today, instead of the vanilla, I substituted 2 tbsp of amaretto and made only half the recipe for a special birthday cake and it is so delicious.

I love this frosting and wouldn't change a thing about it. This is very simple to make, and has a really nice consitancy for piping. It's just the right balance of flavor: sweet, but not too sweet; chocolatey, but not too chocolatey. This will be the chocolate frosting I use on my cakes from here on out.

Put this on brownies.  So good.  Helped my brownies out- as I tend to overcook them.  I use 1 1/2 cups chocolate instead of the 2 1/2.  Perfect.  Thanks

I didn't follow it exactly, but since I used it as a starting point, I'll still give it 5 stars. First, I followed another user's recommendation of halving the recipe (I made a 6 inch, two layer cake). I had everything but my sugar pre measured. I used 2 sticks of butter, added 1/4 cup of cocoa (I had 1 1/4 pre measured), 1/2 tsp vanilla, a little over 1/3 cup milk, and then poured the sugar in a little at a time as it was mixing. I'd say, overall, I used MAYBE 2 cups of powdered sugar. I tasted as I mixed, and it tasted wonderful already, so I stopped. Perhaps if I had used all of the ingredients, it only would have made more, but I didn't want to mess up something that was already so perfect! It's not super sweet, just the perfect creamy chocolaty frosting! So, if you follow it exactly and don't think it's perfect, don't be afraid to try again and stop when YOU think it is perfect.

This is very good.  I cut the recipe in half.  I ran out of confectioner's sugar at 4 cups instead of 4 1/2 cups, so mine may have been a bit more chocolaty.  It is so creamy and my husband really liked it (I put it on his birthday cake).  My kids really love it, too.  But what we REALLY love about it is dipping bananas in the leftover frosting.  THAT is delicious!!

So easy to make. I didn't have cocoa powder and was looking for a recipe that used unsweetened chocolate. This was great. I doubled it to frost a 2 layer cake.

This is my first review EVER!  Had to sign up to say  how GREAT this recipe was!  I am not a baker at all, and found it tiring to make, but not at all hard.  But WELL worth it!!  It is so neat to have made my own frosting and it is sooo delicious.  I used it to top a black magic cake that I made also from this website for my husband's birthday and it's been a HUGE hit!!  Thanks for making family memories fun!!

The absolute BEST frosting ever!  I followed the recipe exactly but I also sifted all my dry ingredients to make sure it was very smooth and creamy.  Mine didnt crust like other reviewers but thats probably because I added the full amount of milk.  This is my new go to choc frosting!!!  It tasted even better the day after I made it.  Mmmmm good!

This is so good. Nice and fluffy. When I first tasted it I thought it was a little too chocolaty but after I put it on the brownies it was GREAT! I halved the recipe and there was plenty of frosting for a 9X13 pan.

This frosting has a very rich cocoa taste. By far the best icing I have used. I cut the recipe in half with enough to frost 2-9 inch cakes. I did not need the whole amount of milk, so add until the desired consistency is achieved. Enjoy!!

I made this recipe to frost a 9 inch double layer cake. I cut it in half and still had more than I needed. It is a very creamy frosting, but I found that the cocoa taste was too present and when I make it again, I will use only 1 cup of cocoa (and still half the recipe).

This frosting was like chocolate mousse - light and fluffy, easy to spread with a little extra milk added.  I halved the recipe to cover two 13x9 pans. I creamed the butter, then added 1/2 cup of p.sugar and alternated with cocoa until incorporated, then added poured milk/vanilla in very slowly. Mixed for a while and added a little more milk - little at a time (maybe 2 tbs extra). Not super "chocolatey" but very nice on a marble or chocolate cake.

It was okay. I am surprised that it got such good reviews. It tastes like eating cocoa. Will keep looking for a good chocolate frosting recipe.

It just didn't live up to the reviews for me.  I mean, all chocolate frosting is good and this one is no exception, but it wasn't that special for me.

Delicious.  The recipe said no substitutes, but I wanted it non-dairy, so I used margarine and soy milk instead of butter and milk.  It is still creamy and light and chocolate-y and delicious.  Thank you! :)

PHENOMENAL! I made a cake and used the filling recipe from "chocolate mousse cake" on this site. It was awful..so I made this and used it as the frosting. It saved the cake!!

The best chocolate frosting I have ever had!!  You will see the cake I made in my photos.  I needed a chocolate color for a teddy bear cake I made for my son's first birthday.  It is the perfect consistency for piping and decorating, but even better...It is so GOOD!

excellent!  i took one reviewer's suggestion and added a 2-3 extra tbsp of milk to make it easier to spread.  i halved the recipe and had enough frosting to ice the sides of a 2 layer cake and 12 cupcakes and have a ton leftover.

I love to pipe this on chocolate cupcakes. It is so very fudgy and chocolate-y, hard to believe that it's cocoa powder and not real melted chocolate. Delish!

I needed a frosting that would hold up in 80 degree temps and this did so beautifully! It was delecious and very chocolatey.  I made it the night before and put it in the fridge overnight.  When I went to use it, it needed to be beat again.  It piped beautifully and was very good!

I made this last night and it was delicious on cupcakes!  The frosting was rich, chocolaty, and creamy.  Just perfect.  I cut all the ingredients in half and it was still WAY too much for 24 cupcakes.  Next time I make 24 cupcakes I will make 1/4 of the amount.  Thanks for this recipe!

I felt like this took forever to make (it was my first time making my own frosting, so I was comparing it to opening a can of fake stuff), and I had to add the milk earlier than the recipe called for because my mixer was practically crying, but man, did I love this frosting.  I would seriously eat it plain if I didn't feel like it would make me a worse human being.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is the first time I made chocolate frosting and so I have nothing to compare it to, BUT I think it's great!! I will be using this until I find something better(if I do). I used this over chocolate cake for my hubby who wanted chocolate cake so much. 
Update: This is delicious! I have yet to find a better recipe!

I'm not a huge man of frosting and neither is my husband so going through and finding one that worked was a little bit hard. I changed mine a little bit, cut it in half to start and added more chocolate. I will have to say this is the best frosting recipe I have fond thus far and will be sticking to this one for more than a little while. Works well everyday or on days where we have people coming over... like today... thanks!

OMG, rich, thick, delicious.  This is how frosting should taste.  I used Dagoba organic cocoa and it is rubber scraper lickin good!!!!  I added more milk (oat milk) since it was pretty thick.  I also listened to the other reviews and addded a 1/4 cup more cocoa and 1/4 cup less sugar, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

I love this recipe! I found it to be fluffy and very spreadable. My family liked it so much, it has become a favorite. I didn't have any problems with the cocoa flavoring. I just beat it for an extra few minutes and it blended in beautifully.

Very good chocolate frosting recipe. The balance of butter and chocolate flavor is perfect. I halved the recipe and it was still plentiful to fill and frost a 2-layered 9-in. cake! Thanks for the recipe, it was easy and delicious.

Very, very good.  I made a chocolate cake and made a filling with melted chocolate poured into whipped cream.  Then added seedless raspberry preserves.  Used this frosting.  I garnished with fresh raspberries.  I've heard People that were at the party are still talking about the cake... the party was a week ago!

Sadly, there is no rating above a "5," for if a frosting recipe ever deserved such, it is this one. With all the possible variants, there is no need to look elsewhere for a chocolate frosting. I made my own birthday cake (chocolate, of course) with my mother's "go-to" recipe and this frosting. My tastebuds thought they had gone to Heaven. I cannot imagine how any recipe could be better!

Delicious! Very strong chocolate taste, a little too strong for some in my family. So, I cut the recipe in half and added one 8 oz. pkg of cream cheese, and it was AMAZING!

Very good, thanks. Reminds me of frosting my grandma used on her cakes.   I halved the recipe and still had plenty for a 9x13 pan of brownies.

I halved the recipe to frost and fill a 9 inch cake.  This was too rich for me and needed more sugar for my taste, but that may be due to the fact that I used high quality/intense cocoa.

Oh my goodness!!! The best. My husband ate a whole cake because he couldn't get enough of the frosting. I cut the recipe in half and I still had frosting leftover.

I halved this recipe and used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder.  I also used heavy whipping cream because I had some left, in addition to a little milk to get the consistency I wanted.  It fluffed up a bit.  I liked it just as well.  It was a  beautiful, dark color.  And so creamy and deliscious!  I finally found a chocolate frosting I like, and I have been looking awhile.

I made this recipe and the "Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting" recipe from this site at the same time. I couldn't decide so I made them both. This one did not trip my trigger. I can't describe the taste, but it didn't make me want to eat the whole bowl. I ended up using the fudge buttercream as a filling between two round layers and mixed the left overs with this recipe. I did halve this recipe as well, and there was more than enough for a 2 layer round cake. Probably wouldn't make again if I didn't mix the other frosting in it.

This was good, but I was surpised that it wasn't smoother. Even with the powdered sugar it seemed a little grainy to me. Of course that didn't stop me from eating way too much! Taking the advice of other reviewers I thinned it using milk, a tablespoon at a time and ended up making it too thin for piping, but perfect for spreading. I always find a way to mess up the cake decorating process. I halved the recipe and it was plenty to fill and frost a 9-inch double layer cake, complete with piped decor and a lot of bowl-licking!

This frosting would have been good if it wasn't so buttery tasting. It leaves a funny aftertaste because of the butter. I made the recipe for 16 servings and it called for 2 sticks of butter, it would have been much better with only 1.

Turns out perfectly!  I had to cut down the recipe quite a bit because it makes a ton!  That was expected based on the amount of sugar involved though.  I particularly liked this when I used it to frost some brownies topped with peanut butter then this frosting.  Delicious!

This is pretty tasty. I halved the recipe, and as other reviewers said, that was MORE than enough for a 9' two layer cake. I divided the recipe - adding chocolate to part (about 2/3) and leaving the rest white for piping. I found that I needed to add more vanilla extract to the whole recipe for flavor, and even using less sugar than called for, it was too sweet for me. I added a touch of almond extract to the chocolate mix, which added a nice touch (some sort of liquor would also be nice -but I didn't have on hand.) But this is a tasty icing. I put it on the Too Much Chocolate Cake - and we'll see tomorrow if everyone dies of sugar overload. :)

This turned out a little runny, I scaled this down to 8 servings, which made more than enough for a 9 by 13. I did 2 cups of powdered sugar instead of 2.5 cups, but the taste was outstanding! So, I didn't want to add the rest of the sugar. I will try whole milk next time, or something other than skim, and see if that makes a difference. This really is a great frosting though!

I'm not a huge fan of chocolate anything or frosting for that matter BUT this is Very Very Very good, glossy and rich.  I used half and half because we had no milk.  I'm sure that added even more richness. 12 servings was more than enough for 2 8inch round. Highly recommended.

Yum!  Scaled this down to 12 servings to frost two 8in. round cakes.  My son and I baked just store bought cake mix after he got out of school early and was bored :-) but we had no can frosting since I'm a frosting hater i only buy it when I really need it!  So I looked up this recipe and had the few ingredients it needed and we proceeded to make it using dark Hershey's cocoa powder.  Now this is some frosting I even liked!  It's sweet and actually very pearlescent it's really beautiful.  We frosted pretty thickly and I still had a small amount left over so maybe 10 servings would have been just right.  Easy enough to use everytime we make cake/cupcakes!  So much better than store bought and made our cake taste like from scratch!

This is sinfully delicious.  It was very labor intensive...I used a handmixer, I don't have a Kitchenaide yet!  I kept thinking my mixer was going to burn out.  I added milk as I went.  Topped a boxed cake mix and added raspberries. So good.  Thanks

Great recipe as-is; also easy to make substitutions or changes.  Use cream instead of milk, or add more confectioner's sugar, or more or less cocoa.  Adjust other ingredients as it becomes necessary.

Mmmmm...yum yum! I cut the sugar back by just over 1/2, and otherwise leave it the same. The only "problem" with this frosting is that I want to eat it by the spoonful!

Definitely YUM!  I made only 1/2 of the recipes and still ended up with WAY MORE than needed to frost 2 8x8 cakes (including one with filling).  The birthday girl ran around with a beater for 1/2 an hour or so because she loved the flavor so much!

The name says it all!  This is a delicious, rich chocolate frosting that's easy to make and tastes wonderful.  My only recommendation is to make sure to sift the sugar and cocoa first so you don't have any lumps.  It's so good you just want to forget the cake and eat the frosting!

Very tasty - reminds me of the frosting my mom used to make when we were kids!  I like keeping the frosted cake in the fridge - the frosting stays more firm that way!

This was tasty business!!  The flavor is fantastic!  I think it is very important to sift the flour and the cocoa (mine was a little clumpy - but sifting would eliminate that) - overall the taste is a great balance of sweet and chocolate!

Fabulous! Cut the recipe in half and had PLENTY for a 9 x 9 two layer round cake. Kids love it, I love it. WAY better than the stuff you get at the grocery store (minus all the funky stuff you'd get in the store brand stuff!) HIGHLY recommend.

Delicious and chocolatey! Made with butter so t needs to be refirgerated to keep the frosting from melting too much. Made it for Tyler's birthday. Went over really well.

WOW. This frosting with the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III from this site made a chocolate cake to die for! The frosting was rich, creamy, easy, and you will pretty much just want to eat it right from the bowl. Thanks for the recipe, I will never buy frosting in a jar again!

A wonderfully chocolate flavor!  I did lower the sugar as several people suggested and also only made 1/2 of the recipe.  Finally, a frosting that tastes more like chocolate than sugar!  I will make this again and try lowering the sugar even a bit more.

This frosting is GREAT! It's nice to have a chocolate frosting with just cocoa powder (no melting chocolate, etc) that's not too sweet, & it's so creamy & fluffy! I found that 1/4 the recipe was a good amount for a 9x13 cake.

This will definitely be my chocolate frosting of choice from now on. I agree with the other reviewers - to frost a soft, moist cake you will probably need more than the called-for amount of milk. I had a LOT of frosting left over, after icing a double layer 9-inch round cake with HALF this original recipe.

Delicious, and super-creamy. I used only 1/3 of the recipe for a standard 9x13 sheet cake, and it made the perfect amount. This will become my standard chocolate frosting!

Excellent!!!  I used this on "Sandy's Chocolate Cake" from this website and it was pure heaven.  I reduced the recipe by 1/4 and it was enough to frost a 9X13 cake.

Mmmm. I rarely write reviews, but this recipe deserves one. I can understand why someone would request a bowl of this for a birthday!

I made a quarter of the recipe and frosted an 9X13 cake (still in the pan). It made plenty for that. I also added almond extract since it was a chocolate cherry cake. TO be honest, the frosting was WAY better than the cake!

Thanks for a perfect frosting recipe!

Delicious!!!  I halved the recipe and it made enough to frost 24 cupcakes.  I only used 2 cups of confectioner's sugar (even though half the recipe would call for 4 1/2 cups) and it was plenty sweet.  I think the full amount would have been way too much.  I also substituted 1/2 of the milk with strong brewed coffee to enhance the chocolate flavor.

Don't use all the milk if you plan to stack for wedding cake. Consistency should be slightly heavier. Everything else is perfecto to finish. I took the risk to do this first time and at 1.5 batch.. end results? EXCELLENT! Thanks Amy

Yummy, rich chocolate taste.  I halved recipe and used only 4 c. confectioners sugar (intstead of 4 1/2).  It was plenty sweet and frosted a 2 layer cake (One Bowl Chocolate Cake III-also yummy) with lots left over.  Will definitely make again.

Amazing! I halved the recipe like others and it was great.
I made a second half-batch with 3 1/2 cups powdered sugar and 1 cup granulated sugar for texture and it came out amazing!

Mmmm.  I've recently started cooking for our family and now all of the desserts for our extended family gatherings.  I got so many compliments on my cake with this frosting this time. 
I too "halved" the recipe and was still able to cover 2 - 2 layer cakes with it.  Oh and most definitely make this the day before and let it sit in the frig. overnight.  Absolutely takes on a fuller 
flavor.  Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm

I used this recipe for the "one bowl chocolate cake III" on here.  It was really delicious.  It tasted so much better than the store bought frosting and was super easy to make!  I will definately use this recipe again.

5 Stars tatse better than the store bought icing which over here in Australia costs almost $4 not cheap like in USA. I also halved the recipe which was more than enough and made it with the Sandys Chocolate cake recipe everyone in the family loved it husband said best ever tasted.

DELICIOUS!! i followed the tip of halving the recipe for the cake i was making, & i still have a container left. better than being short!it really reminds me of the Betty Krocker jars u find in the baking section of the store! the taste, the look, & the feeling really remind me of the Betty Krocker brand. im very impressed!!! ive never made a frosting like this before. theyre usually all runny, & not so fun to work w/. this was alot of fun, & def. something a choco. luver would look forward to! VERY rich! i will def. make this again!! ..... now if theres any way i could make it whatever flavour i want instead of choco., itd be great for other things besides choco. (like instead of cocoa, using a diff. ingredient in place)

Very, very good.  It tasted great and spread very well.  I made this in my kitchenaid and had to beat for several minutes to get a smooth mix.  Because of a dairy allergy I used butter flavored Crisco and vanilla soy milk and it was still wonderful.  I made 1/2 of this recipe, which was plenty for a 2 layer, 9" round cake.  I took this to a party and it got many compliments.  I used the chocolate oil cake recipe.

This is a great basic recipe for chocolate frosting. The taste is initially somewhat chalky, but this disappears as the frosting sets and develops a rich brown color. I cut the recipe down to serve 8, which was plenty for 20 cupcakes.

This was delicious!  Like many people, I cut the recipe in half for a layer cake.  I didn't add quite as much sugar as the recipe stated (4 cups instead of 4 1/2) so as to give it a nice dark chocolate flavor, and so I didn't add quite as much milk.  It does make a lot, but that ended up being good for me.  I added too much liquid to my cake recipe, and it fell apart as I was taking it out of the pans (4-5 pieces per layer; a disaster).  This was enough frosting for me to patch the cake (no small task) and still make it look presentable.  This will probably be my new chocolate frosting recipe.

I am very very picky about my chocolate frosting.  This is really the best I have had!  There is a great grocery store near us and we usually get their chocolate cake (which has won awards).  It taste just like it.  It is as dense or as light as you would like to make it.  Just adjust the milk.  I put in 3/4 cup instead of the full cup.  I like my frosting thicker.  OUTSTANDING.

An extremely good chocolate frosting - it's not too sweet, and it's quite easy to make. I did halve the recipe, which gave me more than enough frosting for a 9-inch two-layer cake. In the process of halving it, I only used 4 cups of confectioners sugar instead of 4 and a half, though. It is very chocolatey and rich, but that wasn't a problem for my family and I. I will most definitely be keeping this around for when I need a chocolate frosting.

A very delicious, easy, and creamy frosting!.  I made one fourth the batch, and had leftovers for other baking projects.  I'm very happy to find a nice recipe with cocoa powder, as I do not like the flavor of baking chocolate.
