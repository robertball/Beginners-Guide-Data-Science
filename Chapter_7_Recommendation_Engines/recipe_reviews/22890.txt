Outstanding! I did make some modifications based on what seemed right to me. Beef instead of chicken broth because I think it goes better with mushrooms. Shiitakes were $9 a pound at the market while portobelllos were half that, so I used all portobello! And finally, cinnamon sounded completely bizarre, but a grating of nutmeg sounded like just the ticket. Chop the mushrooms and shallots fine and you'll have no need to puree any of the soup. Saute them until well caramelized for best flavor and be generous with the peppermill and you'll have a fantastic rich soup. However, the shallot flavor was a bit strong, so I'll use half the quantity next time. I am going to serve with a salad and garlic bread.

Loved it.  Used only portabello mushrooms, about 3 cups diced.  Used an immersion blender to   chop up the majority of the mushrooms prior to serving.  Added 2 large cloves of finely minced garlic, too.  Passed on the cream, made a little roux and added 1% milk instead.  Still was very creamy.  A dash or two of liquid smoke near the end of the cooking.  Those reviewers who said this looked like sink water are sadly  lacking a real appreciation of what a good cream of mushroom soup should look like.  This is not the popular, sanitized for public consumption, canned soup... this recipe is the real thing...   A good chunk of crusty bread is required for dunking.  Yum Delicious!!!!

This is a perfect mushroom soup! I added a bunch of chopped white mushrooms only to make it heartier and garnished with a hint of rosemary. I also only pureed half the mushroom mixture and left the other half chunky. 

Wonderful! It's just what mushroom soup is supposed to be, creamy and comforting!

The cook: 33 year-old, cooking-challenged bachelor.  The victims: 5 family members over for Thanksgiving.  The verdict: a great soup!  Easy and quick to make, a hearty, rich soup that tastes wonderful.  Not for the lactose-intolerant, though.

This was so delicious! I have been looking for a mushroom soup for a long time! unfortunately I didn't have any shiitake mushrooms or shallots so I used regular button along with the portobello, I didn't have half and half cream so I used heavy whipping cream! I also used the other idea of others and used nutmeg instead of cinnamon and I also used garlic salt instead of regular! I love veggies so I shredded up some carrots and cut up some red potatoes which complimented the earthiness of the mushrooms!   I will defiantly be making this again and again!

I served this at a formal dinner party and the guests raved! I tried a whole selection of mushrooms also. I just don't think you can mess this recipe up - it's so easy and so good! I saved some of the mushrooms to garnish on top too. Great presentation!

Why use half-and-half when you can use heavy cream. Very good. Better double it.

This was fantastic!!  I used an entire package of shiitake mushrooms (came out to 1 1/2 cups) and entire package of portobello mushrooms (came out to 2 cups), and it wasn't too much at all!  I made mine soup lowfat by using only 1 Tbl. butter and fat-free half-and-half.  I also added 3/4 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper.  Perfect amounts!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

MY HUSBAND AND I BELONG TO A CHURCH BASED ON POLISH HERITAGE.  EACH CHRISTMAS WE HAVE A CHRISTMAS DINNER AT CHURCH (CALLED WIGILIA) AND IT BEGINS WITH A MOST DELICIOUS MUSHROOM SOUP.  I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR ANYTHING THAT RESEMBLES THIS SOUP.  THIS RECIPE IS ABOUT THE CLOSEST I'VE FOUND.  IT IS S-O-O-O-O-O EASY TO MAKE AND IS ESPECIALLY DELICIOUS.

I wanted to rate this recipe based on how I altered it (only to make is healthier) because I know I technically should be rating the recipe based on how it was written. However, here goes... this is a wonderful and easy cream of mushroom soup! It was so easy, my boyfriend did the work while I read the instructions (I was preparing other meals to go along). We followed the methodology of the recipe and substituted many ingredients. I only had crimini mushrooms so I used those instead and sauted them with about a 1/4C of diced red onion. I added 2 tbsp of whole wheat flour (fibre people!) and instead of chicken/vegetable stock (didn't want extra sodium), I used water. I know it may seem like I am not adding flavour, I did but adding salt, pepper, paprika, fresh dill, onion powder and a pinch of cinnamon. I added skim milk instead of the half and half and at first my boyfriend was skeptical, thinking I needed to add cream to make this tolerable. After his nagging, I thought I would appease him without compromising fat by adding a few spoons of 0% fat Greek yogurt. I added 7 sliced baby yukon gold potatoes (to make it heartier) and the soup thickened on it's own. It was so creamy and delicious even with all the shortcuts. This recipe is great because you can alter it to suit your needs without compromising taste or quality. Plus is was so very easy. It was honestly better than restaurant quality. My boyfriend loved it and we finished the pot for supper. Thanks for sharing!

Truly Amazing.....

the one thing to add is 1/2 cup of white wine before the flour. Let the alcohol burn off for 2-3 mins.  Soooo good.....thanks for the recipe (ps....i put the cream in but this recipe definitely does NOT need it...the colour and taste is so good before too)

This soup is divine, even on a low-carb diet! I used white button mushrooms (all I had on hand), and heavy cream instead of the 1/2 and 1/2 (since I didn't use the flour for thickening), and added a teaspoon of minced garlic, a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce, a teaspoon of tarragon, AND cubed cooked chicken to make it more satiating. I topped it off with a sprinkling of nutmeg, instead of cinnamon. Rich and satisfying!

This was a great soup. I did however change it up a bit. I almost doubled the amt of mushrooms and only used portobellos. Didn't have shallots so I used finely chopped onion instead. I sauteed the onion and mushroom with garlic and thyme. Followed all of the steps (except I used heavy cream), I blended half of the mixture. The last step was most important. This and adding garlic really brought out the flavor. I would definitely make this again. Next time, I use a higher quality broth.

The best ever!  Just as easy as opening a can but 1 million times better.  I didn't add the cinnamon but sprinkled in a little thyme since I love that flavor with mushrooms. Oh and make sure you brown the mushrooms to concentrate their yummy flavors!

Taste good but yes, looks like dirty dish water.  What in the world.  Looked even worse after I ran it through the blender. Next time I will not run it through the blender and make a the basic cream sauce separate then add the mushrooms.

By far the best mushroom soup I've ever tasted.  I used 3 cups of portabellas and omitted the cinnamon...I'll try that next time. In my opinion, most any mushroom would probably do.  And to the person who thought the soup looked like dirty dishwater, you might try removing the gills from the portabellas.  I don't believe it changes the flavor, but certainly the appearance.

Loved it.  I made mine with two boxes of portobello mushrooms and 2 onions sliced.  I also used beef broth instead of chicken broth (sounded better to me too) and heavy cream.  I added lots of garlic powder, salt, and pepper and cooked like directions but also pureed it in the blender and then heated it up again to eating temperature.  Loved it!

Mmmm Good!   and simple!   I made a few changes, I added onion and some roasted garlic to the mushrooms as them sauteed, I also added some Chardonnay when adding the broth, as I did not have enough broth.  I used skim milk and some Greek yogurt for the cream/half and half.  I added a bit of thyme, and a rough chopped tomato ~

I followed the recipe to a "T" (will experiment later as I like to add my own flare/flavour after trying the posted recipe). Didn't have access to some of the kinds of mushrooms listed so, simply used white mushrooms diced up fine (not pureed). What a fabulous flavour. Was easy to make (my 3-yr old daughter was able to help). Recommend this recipe to anyone that wants something easy to make and tastes great. Will definitely be a family favourite. Wife isn't a fan of mushroom soup and now she can't get enough. Thank You!

Oh I am in love with this recipe. On the night I prepared it, there was this huge storm rolling in, which killed the power as I was cutting the mushrooms. But instead of placing this on the back burner to save for a later date, I followed through it with estimated measurements and the backlight of my cellphone to guide me. Originally I wanted the soup to be creamier, but without power, blenders and mixers were out of the question (there wasn't sufficient lighting to cut the mushrooms and I for one love my fingers). Even through it all, this soup came out as a smash hit. There weren't any major changes added here except chicken broth being replaced with beef, and both white and portabella mushrooms being used in the place of shiitake. A few more spices were added, but that's neither here nor there. A friend of mine tried this soup reheated yesterday (she's my food guinea pig ---always up to taste my concoctions). Not only did she fall in love with this, but she has even asked that I make a larger batch this weekend. Definitely a keeper!

If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!!! This was a great soup! Used 1/2 the butter and used a little olive oil.

Delicious with a couple of slight changes - I added thyme and some rosemary.  I also sauteed some garlic in with the shallots, it seems to make it much richer. Delicious though!

This is a delicious and easy recipe for anyone! I also substituted cinnamon with nutmeg to get that nice kick. Since I did not have cream, used 1 1/2 cup 2% milk instead (it's also a lighter option). Another ingredient substituted was shallot, instead used 1 1/2 tbsp of dried chopped onion (from Costco). Even with a few substitutions, the soup was delicious and will definitely make again! We put the soup over baked chicken cutlet and dinner was taken care of :)

Quick and easy to prepare. Extremely rich mushroom taste. Remarkably smooth and creamy texture. Has an appetising aroma. Very filling and addictive. My favourite soup recipe of all time!

The only change I made was to increase the mushrooms to approx. 3 cups, as mushrooms tend to cook down quite a bit. Served it with garlic crusty bread and enjoyed!

Delicous! I made quite a few changes, but tried to stay true to the idea of the recipe. Used an onion instead of shallots, used all button mushrooms, used evaporated milk instead of half-n-half, and nutmeg instead of cinnamon. I used what I had onhand, but look forward to trying the real recipe sometime soon!

This has to be one of the most delicious soups I've ever tasted or made. This was super simple and nice and creamy. I did not add cinnamon and added the Thyme which was suggested by someone. Definately a keeper!!

I just made this exactly the way she describes it - and it was EXCELLENT!!!! I LOVE Sweet Tomatoes mushroom soup and this was as close as I'm ever going to get to it. AMAZING!!!  Now, changes I would make:  1 small shallot, not two.  Double the amount of mushrooms. ( prefer button with some shiitakes) Cinnamon is a MUST - BUT do less than a pinch. It's amazing how little you add, and what it adds taste-wise.   Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipes. I am making again this week! And doubling the recipe since it only made enough for 4 small bowls.

This was sooooo good!  Very rich!  I read that someone used heavy cream instead of half and half but I think that would have been over kill!  I did it just like the recipe and it was wonderful!  The only thing was I had to add some more flour and water to thicken it some more because it did't get as thick as I liked before adding the half and half.  I served it with sourdough rolls.  My family loved it and I will be making this again!

I made this soup to start this year's Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a hit. I would definitely recommend adding the cinnamon, I sampled the soup before and after adding it and it added a subtle and delicious flavour. I loved this soup!

This soup was wonderful! I used it to get through my post-wisdom-tooth removal, and boy am I glad I did. 

I tripled all of the ingredients except for the half half and half. I had heavy cream on hand instead, so I used 1 cup of heavy cream with the rest of the tripled ingredients. The balance was perfect, and I thought that adding any more dairy would have made the soup too rich. 

I also added some dried marjoram and dried thyme (about 1 tsp marjoram and 1 tbsp thyme), which added a lovely, woodsy depth of flavor to the soup. Fresh herbs would probably be better, but I didn't have any on hand.

I had to puree the soup because of my teeth, but I'm pretty sure that I would always puree it regardless. It gave the soup the perfect velvety texture, and would probably deal with some of the "dishwater appearance" complaints that some other reviewers had. It may be nice to reserve some of the mushroom mixture before pureeing, and then adding them back in to add some chunkiness to the texture.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because it was an overall nice, pleasant soup that we enjoyed. But I can't really give it 5 stars because the broth tasted too much like chicken broth with cream, and that's with added onion and garlic and more mushrooms than called for. Even though I enjoyed the chunks of mushrooms I may try blending next time to make it more complex. Or try a different recipe. But this one is worth a shot, too - really not bad, just not perfect.

I'm not usually a big fan of mushroom soup because all I've ever had was the icky stuff in a can.  This recipe was Delicious ! ! !   I added the garlic and used my emersion blender to smooth out some of it.  I also added some cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.  I’m definitely going to make this again

Even though I had to substitute white button mushrooms, and use evaporated milk, this was awesome.  I am quite sure it would be even better using the other mushrooms and half and half. I didn't have those in my pantry.  I had a pound of button mushrooms that needed used up, so on a whim I made this soup. Super easy and my husband raved about it. I had supper made in less than 30 minutes.

I just finished making this for my husband who was craving his favourite variety of Cream of Mushroom Soup.  I had a lb. of fresh button mushrooms and followed this recipe to the T.  It turned out beautifully warm and creamy.  Absolutely delicious.  I have a feeling I won't be buying that popular brand anymore:)!

I did not have shiitake mushrooms and portobello mushrooms with me when I made it, so I substitute with 2 cup of white button mushrooms - still very delicious, my family like this one better than the Campbell soup!  Thanks Kari for sharing this easy and great receipe.

This was so much better than the stuff you get out of cans! I added a little dried thyme and added a little olive oil to the butter at the beginning, and it was marvelous. Garlic might have been a good addition as well. Too bad I'm the only one I know who likes mushrooms. Oh, well, more for me!

Like another reviewer, I put half of the finished soup in the blender to make this more of a "creamy" soup.  The flavor is a little bland - I added some garlic, but it needs something else too, not sure what.  Put some grated parmesan cheese on top before serving!

This recipe when followed as written was perfect.  Slowly adding the liquid and stirring as you’re adding it allowed it to thicken just right. It totally brought be back to when I was a kid and my dad would make a soup similar to this.  So fast and easy.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

Very good! I made this yesterday, knowing it would be even better today!  I scaled this down to 4 servings and used a 10 oz pkg of white mushrooms. I did not have half &half on hand so I used 2% milk. That could be why it was on the thin side, not creamy. Maybe a little cornstarch would have helped that. (Heavy cream would work here, I'll bet.)  I also did not have shallots available, so I sauteed 1/4 chopped onion along with the white mushrooms. I used beef broth instead of chicken and also added a little white wine, thyme and did do the cinnamon. Delicious soup and comes together very quickly!

I modified it a little bit, to make do with what I had in the kitchen and it came out great.
I added  broccoli and chicken (cooked leftovers) to the mix, using water and a bouillon cube instead of stock and half whole milk and half canned milk instead of Half and Half. Garnished with green onion and finely chopped hot pepper

Great soup! Few things that I think make it even better - Start with some fine chopped carrots. Cook until golden-brown (1 to 3 min) and than add the mushrooms. Based on my experience the best herb for mushrooms is fresh DILL. I combine it with nutmeg (not cinnamon). Also instead of half-and-half I use 2% organic milk.  You can also make some garlic bread - super combination!

Made this using twice the mushrooms (4 cups) and 1 1/2 times everything else.  Also added about three cups of cubed roast beef leftovers during the last 5 minutes or so of cooking. It was a meal in itself for two people.  Oh, and I used the mushrooms I had available instead of those specified. Half were wild-harvested Chanterelles; the other half were store-bought white mushrooms.

Used white mushrooms since they looked the freshest at the market.  Blended it well...served with a drizzle of thinned sour cream and a sprig of parsley.  Crackers and cheese along side...delightful!  Thank-you!

Made this soup last night with following changes...first I doubled the recipe then used 1 box portobello and 1 box white button mushrooms. Instead of using 1/2 and 1/2 used a little extra flour and 1/2 tsp hot curry powder and 1 tsp regular curry powder and let it cook for a few minutes to let the curry "bloom". Then added 1 % milk.
I blended all of it but it would have been equally good with only half
of soup blended, so there was a little more texture. I didn't use the cinnamon.

Had a soup similar to this out in California and thought their curry
add an interesting flavor. Even better the next day.

This soup was excellent!  I used all shitake mushrooms and opted not to add the cinnamon.  I did add four slices of cut-up, cooked bacon and about 1/2 c. of grated mild cheddar cheese at the end.  I cooked it just till the cheese melted.  It was so yummy.  My husband is a very picky eater and liked it, too.

I added 1/4 cup sherry just because I know it adds so much to mushroom soup but I also added barley for a heartier soup. This is a great recipe also because it doesn't make a ton.

Husband and I both loved it!  Used beef broth rather than chicken, and all portabellos because they were marked down at the store.  Doubled the recipe - and was glad I did!  Both husband and I took leftovers for lunch today!

Another snowy day here so I thought this would be the perfect soup for dinner.  I used 1 8oz pkg of Baby Bella mushrooms, 1  8 oz. pkg. white button mushrooms and 1  3.5 oz. Shiitake  mushrooms which made a total of 6 cups of mushrooms.  I would add even more next time and be sure to just slice some and not chop them. I doubled the rest of the ingredients. The taste was good.  I saw that others had added some garlic cloves but I followed the recipe for this first time.  When I tasted the soup at the end, I decided to add some garlic powder.  A very simple soup to make and I will make it again!

Loved it!  It was very easy to make and delicious.  I did make some changes.  I added potato and carrots to make it heartier.  Used potato flour instead of all purpose flour and coconut milk instead of milk.  Didn't add cinnamon.  Potato flour always gets very lumpy so I used a blender to puree the potato flour and some of the soup and then added it to the rest of the soup.  This was delicious and healthy!  Will make it again and again.

Sorry that I cannot agree with other reviewers but I found this soup lacking in taste. It tasted more like a gravy to me. I tried adding thyme, garlic and a little sherry for flavor but that did not seem to help improve the flavor. I would use this recipe as a sauce for round steak but not as a soup.

Very good taste but I would have liked a more chunky soup.  The mushrooms reduce a lot so it turned out to be a lot of liquid and a few muschrooms here and there.  If I make this again I will quadruple the mushrooms.

We loved this.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for using vegetable broth instead of chicken (we are vegetarian).  I was hesitant with the cinnamon, but it really made it.  I would suggest trying a small amount on the side before turning a nose up to it.  Absolutely delicious, a new family favorite.

Excellent!  I have made it according to the recipe and also with only portobellos, and it's been great both times.  The dash of cinnamon really makes it, do not skip this!  I also substitute corn starch for flour to make it gluten-free.

The flavor of this soup is excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly except one minor change, which was only to use the entire package of both the shitakes and the portabellos.  I chopped one cup of each, then pureed the rest in a food processor.

This was a really easy and tasty!  The store didn't have any shitake mushrooms, so I ended up using the same quantity of button mushrooms instead.  I did find that 2 tablespoons of flour wasn't nearly enough to thicken the soup though..  I added around a half a cup and it came out creamy and delicious!  I also omitted the cinnamon and added a few shakes of grill seasoning for a nice savory flavor.  I sauteed 4 more shallots in about a half a cup of butter, spread the mix on thick pieces of sourdough bread and put them in a 400 degree oven to make crunchy croutons to dip in the soup :)  Awesome!

Really excellent soup.  I used all 2 cups portobellos and added about another 3/4 cup of buttons.  Added 2 cloves of garlic and a tsp and a half of thyme.  Might reduce it to one tsp next time.  Also added a full 2 c of broth.  Pureed most of the mushroom mixture as per a reviewer suggestion after it was done cooking; I prefer it with less whole chunks of mushroom.  Omitted cinnamon topping.  Great stuff!

Really good soup.  I tweeked it a bit with spices, but I do that.  I also used it for a green bean casserole that turned out great and was a big hit at Christmas. I topped it with dehydrated fresh onions tat I did myself and it was wonderful.

What a great soup.  I also took the others advice and added garlic and a little worchestorshire sauce to give it a little more flavor also used 2% milk and it was still very creamy.  I used dry mushrooms and at the end put the soup in the blender to make a nice bisque. GREAT GREAT WONDERFUL!!

This is the first time I made soup like this from scratch so I was a bit worried how it will turned out. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to use milk instead of the cream. The amount of mushroom makes the soup very thick so I double the amount of broth and put in 1.5 times more milk. They turned out great! Love it! Thanks!

This was awesome and so easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly as is, but I did add extra mushrooms because I love mushrooms. I used both bably bellas and white mushrooms and the pinch of cinnamon was a nice addition as it was optional.  Every now and then I'd taste a hint of cinnamon in my spoonful and it tasted good!  Husband loved it too, will definitely be making again.  Thanks for the recipe!

this is like the best mushroom soup recipe i ever tried! rich, creamy and full of flavour. mushrooms can easily be substituted with brown or white button mushrooms, if portobello are too expensive, or not available. 

i prefer to puree the soup after it's done to give it a smoother finish.

this was pretty simple to make and it tastes better than campbell soup. :) i used 1.5 tbsp of butter and enough whole milk to equal one cup to sub half and half. found that the all purpose flour didnt really work well to thicken the mixture so i added corn flour instead after cooking everything. (1.5 tbsp mixed with a little water) i added coarse black pepper and it turned out pretty flavourful. cinnamon adds a refreshing taste.

Not bad... very easy to make, the only reason I gave it four stars is because it not thick enough, next time I will add another tablespoon of flour and see if that works.

This was good-I love mushrooms so I used a cup of shitakes and two cups of white mushrooms.
Basic recipe is a little bland, but that's easy to correct with seasoning.

This soup has a delicous flavour but the butter could be cut back considerably.  I pureèd about 2/3 of the soup once it was cooked to make it a "creamed" soup - something I would recommend be added to the recipe's original directions.

Wonderful soup! I added a carrot, garlic and a chopped potato, and used some yellow onion and beef broth because that's what i had. I doubled the recipe. No cinnamon. My man can't get enough!
This will be requested often now...!

I sautéed the mushrooms, onions and garlic in the butter, then continued to follow the recipe. I wished in the flour at the end and added additional pepper and wine. Delicious. Great recipe to work with.

I don't understand what all the fuss is about this recipe! This didn't even have a mushroom taste to it! Why would you want a mushroom soup without a mushroom taste? Neither myself nor my husband liked this and I ended up draining the liquid and saving the mushrooms to use in another dish tomorrow. Utterly unimpressed!

I had an abundance of dried shiitake mushrooms from a Japanese dish I made, and they were perfect for this soup. I also used low sodium chicken broth. Turned out great!!

We had a huge package of white mushrooms and needed to use them asap so I was looking for something. This recipe popped up so we tried it. The only thing I changed in the recipe was we had some left over chicken breast so we shredded it and added it. Sooo delicious! Not sure we will ever eat canned mushroom soup again lol

Delicious!  Changed two things: did not puree at all , I wanted the `chunks`  and used beef broth instead of chicken.  Next time I will use chicken stock just so I can compare.
Didn't use cinnamon,  it didn't  appeal to me

Mmm, delicious! I had to use what I had, which was button mushrooms, and ham stock (out of home made chicken stock). No shallots, used green onions. I also added some sherry. Turned out great!

Changes:
Added the flour to the chicken stock before adding to the mushrooms and shallots to keep it from being lumpy - found it hard to blend otherwise.
Added celery.
Added red chili flakes for a bit of heat

Delicious! Sooo much better than the canned stuff. I used button mushrooms because that's all I had on hand. Used an immersion blender to smooth out and chop mushrooms up a bit Finished with heavy cream instead of 1/2 and 1/2. Substituted fresh grated nutmeg instead on cinnamon. Added 1/8 cup of sherry at the end. Quick any easy recipe.

I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and a hand emulsifier to slightly beat down the size of the mushrooms. This flavor is phenomenal. I tasted before and after adding the cinnamon. Go ahead and add the cinnamon. It gives the soup a slightly nutty taste. 
I will make this again - probably monthly. It was super simple!

I upped the portions to 12 and used one kind of mushrooms - crimini.  Used regular onion instead of shallots.  It was wonderful.  Really hit the spot.  I used less half-n-half than the 12 portion ingredient list called for.  Yes, I would make it again.

I used chopped onions because that's all I had, I also blended it because my teen doesn't like mushrooms and he is easily fooled if you can't see the vegetable...It was quite good and a breeze to make.

Outstanding soup that Hs become. Thanksgiving tradition for my family! I blend shitake, portabella, and white mushrooms, which gives a nice depth of flavor and I use an immersion blender to keep a little texture.

I added fresh garlic in the sautee portion of it and I also used some paprika.  I used more mushrooms as well.  It definitely needed the extra seasoning and flavors.

This soup is quick and easy to make and very delicious. Typically, I love really thick roux based cream soups, but this one has a great flavorful blend of mushrooms that just sets it apart. I doubled the recipe but didn't have enough chicken broth, so I used half beef/half chicken and it was so good. I really think either broth would go well or a combo like I did out of necessity.

It is always a joy to find a basic recipe for something.  This is a keeper and will be the start of all my mushroom soups.  I used everything and tried a bit of cinnamon in one bowl.  It was ok but not to my particular taste.  I can see adding other veggies and am thinking about fried tofu croutons.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

I followed the steps accordingly except for a few. I doubled the amount of the mushrooms. I used shiitake mushrooms. Added garlic to bring out the flavour. Substituted half and half with cooking cream. The soup turned out to be so creamy and full of flavour. I’d have cut down the amount of shallots though. It tasted a wee bit too strong.

It was great and easy to make. I added a little bit of parsley to it. Next time, I'll use a bit more flour to thicken it up a bit more. I double the recipe for four servings.

Made a few adjustments. Mainly didn’t have many of the ingredients so I subbed half a red onion, half a yellow onion, and one large garlic for the shallots. I read a review that said to use beef stock, but didn’t have any on hand so I used one cup of chicken that I’d made the night before and one cup of water with a beef bouillon cube. Added parsley to the mix and used full fat milk with a little extra butter. No cinnamon but plenty of pepper for a nice kick. Delicious!

I loved this. I used hen of the woods mushrooms from my local farmers market, added a large cloves of garlic, and substituted canned goat’s milk for the half and half because I’m lactose intolerant. It turned out beautifully and tasted wonderful!

Loved it.  Needed a hot dinner quick for a hungry husband who likes mushroom soup.  We're adventurous diners, but the cinnamon felt like a risk.  Both of us loved it, even the cinnamon!  Hubs said "It's a keeper."  Decided not to puree the mushrooms per usual and liked the change.
Will be my main Mushroom Soup recipe from now on... so fast and delicious.  Served it with split bolios, buttered and topped with cheese.  2 minutes in the toaster oven at 400!

Umm, the whole dinner - comfort food taken up a notch and on the table in less than 30 minutes.  Thank you, Lori, for the recipe!

This was great and easy.  I used portabella and plain white mushrooms rather than shiitake.  It had great flavor and texture.  Absolutely loved it.  It really did take only 15 minutes or so to make.

I can't pass up 1/2 price mushrooms at our awesome Italian market. We toss them into spaghetti sauce, fajitas, chicken dishes and we always have a bowl of mushrooms & onions for gravys or omelettes but it hadn't occurred to me that a creamy mushroom soup was an easy fix. This was so easy, fast and, after 1 try is already on my go-to lunch list.
I omitted the optional cinnamon and used mushroom broth instead of chicken. I had planned on running it through the blender before serving but hubby loved the mix of rough chopped mushrooms. 

I should note that I'm a lazy cook who needs a huge payoff for very little effort (luckily, hubby is an amazing cook) and this recipe checked all my boxes.

This is a great recipe. Flavorful and easy to make -- economical. I doubled the recipe and was a little creative: more mushrooms, more flour for a more creamy consistence and I did use the cinnamon because my sis is partial to that spice and she was able to pick up its subtle flavor. 

I did not blend any of the mushrooms and she suggested next go round to do so. I'll blend the portobello but not the others.

Will definitely make this over and over.

This was really good. Make it with portabella and white cap because shiitake mushrooms were expensive. I did what others did and added rosemary and put a few mushrooms in food processors to for more texture. I doubled batch and 3 people at all of it no leftovers.

Tremendous flavor! Made a few changes, used all baby bella mushrooms and added garlic.  Also used beef stock, and even lamb stock once, and light cream and it was fabulous!

I followed the recipe to a T, but all I had on hand at the time was white mushrooms ( we're pretty rural). The soup turned out great anyway! Not a huge shitake fan, but I would use crimini or portabello next time for a stonger mushroomy flavor. I also used an immersion blender and overdid it, I would keep more just chopped next time. Great recipe!

Delicious.  Would definitely try this again. It almost tasted like canned mushroom soup that you buy, but chunkier because of all the chopped mushrooms.  I did have to use white mushrooms instead of the shiitake and also added a little bit of garlic powder as suggested by another poster.

I made a gluten free, lower fat version by subbing brown rice flour and opting for fat free evaporated milk. I also added two cloves of garlic and it turned out so rich and full of mushroom flavor! I might experiment with the leftovers and try blending a portion and mixing it back in to give a bit more body.  Very easy, straightforward and delicious soup, thanks for sharing!

This soup is very good. I prepared it as is and tasted great. Don't hesitate to add the cinnamon it will be fine. After tasting it, I decided to add a pinch of dried thyme and it just enhanced the earthy/nutty the flavor of the soup so much.  I will definitely make it again. As someone else suggested, have this soup with crusty bread. Delicious!

Super simple soup for a winter evening. It needed a little something to bring it up a notch. After adding a little slug of sherry and some thyme I was much happier. Also processed some in Vitamix to smooth it out. I'll make it again for sure.

Outstanding!!! I made it exactly as written, except I added nutmeg instead of cinnamon. It was flavor filled, creamy and the texture of the mushrooms and shallots perfect. I made it earlier in the day, let it cool down and let the flavors pull through andI will be making this often.

Really pleased with the simplicity of this soup, and amazed by the great flavor.  I did use a sprinkle of cinnamon and it's good. Also took the suggestion to add a tad of garlic.  Used the immersion blender to make creamier with some chunks left.  Yum!  I will keep and share this fantastic recipe!  Thank You!!

Didn't have half & half so I used whole milk. Followed the rest of the recipe, to the letter. Still pleasantly surprised - especially since I've never had mushroom soup before! This was definitely the best way to use up the last of the fresh mushrooms in my fridge. Definitely a hearty soup for super cheap. Yay!

I truly enjoyed this!  I stuck to the recipe the best I could.  I didn't have shallots, so I just used a sweet yellow onion. No Shiitake mushrooms, just 8 oz of baby bellas, so that is what I used.  I saw  in some of the comments some pureed it but, I didn't and I'm glad.  I like the texture differences that it had.  I was a little skeptical of the cinnamon but, I always like to stick to the recipe the first time, so in my first bowl I put a dash.  I liked the smell and comfort it gave but then on the 2nd bowl, I just ate plain and liked the true mushroom flavor coming through.    So, try it either way.  Make sure you do cook a couple of minutes after adding the flour just to cook off the flour taste, I always do.  Even though I thought it was great, I think next time, I might  just add a tad of Sherry or White wine, just to try with that extra layer of flavor.

This was absolutely delicious! I followed most of the recipe and used suggestions from other comments like beef broth instead and grated fresh nutmeg. I also added a little red wine at the beginning when cooking the mushrooms and shallots; wine that you can drink while making this great soup. I used my immersion blender and left some chunky pieces. I will never use mushroom soup from a can again, thank you thank you.

This soup was fantastic.  I am not a cook so I followed the recipe exactly-leaving out the pinch of cinnamon.  It had a really nice consistency- not too thick, which is often what I don't like about cream soups.   Loved it!

Loved this recipe as a base!
I subbed beef broth as I had it on hand and thought it went together nicely.  I also subbed white mushrooms for shiitake (economical reasoning) and added a yellow onion/garlic (diced and sautéed), ground coriander seed, white/black pepper, tons of thyme and parsley, and a hint of nutmeg.
If you're like me and like your food to be pretty, add the thyme and parsley.  It tastes great and dresses it up a bit - especially when you add a bit of the parsley to the top when serving.

This is really tasty and quick!
I just made it (onions instead of shallots, cream instead of half and half). 
It came out perfect and I am a lousy cook. (Like really really lousy)
Thanks so much!

Used only portobello mushrooms as well, sweet cream instead of half-and-half and added 2 potatoes and a carrot, no blending - tastes delicious!

Great base recipe. I had to do few modifications: i used only portobello mushrooms and satay them for about 20 min. I added flour to the warm broth- it mixes way easier then to mix flour with mushrooms. Added two potatoes cut in small cubes and boiled the soup for about 15 min (add 1-2 cups of water), then at the end add milk instead of half & half. Sprinkle with some fresh chopped parsley at the end. Served with foccacia bread. Delish!!

My first try at mushroom soup, and I'm glad I chose this recipe!  Only had portobello, so that's what I used.  I chopped the shrooms into small pieces. Used about 1/4 of an onion, chopped, in place of the shallots. Used skim milk instead of half and half. The mushroom flavor is so rich that I don't really think you need to use half and half.  Also, I omitted the cinammon. YummY!

I made this to replace the high sodium can soup used in everyday recipes. I modified it a bit, instead of chicken broth I used organic low sodium vegetable broth, replaced the half and half with non dairy creamer and left out the salt. I allowed it to cool and divided it into 3/4 cup containers to freeze for later use. It is very tasty but I think it could be puréed before I use it for my next recipe.

I adapted this recipe to reduce the carbs and also make it more suitable for the vegetarians in the family.  I purred the mixture and did not add flour.  I also substituted coconut milk for cream.  Delicious and much healthier.

The recipe is outstanding! I didn't know it was this easy. I used all baby portabello's, the shitakes were way too pricey in the stores near me. I reserved 1 c. of the chopped mushrooms... After sauteing I put it in the blender with 1/2 cup of the half and half.  put it all in the pot. The color, the texture and the flavor were delicious. Was a huge hit with my oldest son. Mushroom soup is a family favorite especially in cold weather. I'm about to make more but this time am using beef broth only because portabellos are a beefy flavored mushroom. Thank you for the recipe!

Very good and easy to make.  This was my first attempt at cream of mushroom soup.  I did add some very finely chopped celery to the recipe and I used baby bellas and white shrooms because I had them on hand.

Received great reviews after I served this. Flavor was perfect. I substituted vegetable broth due to serving to a friend that is vegetarian but that was the only change. Other than taking time to chop the mushrooms and shallots, quick, easy, and impressive.

I would probably make this again, but it was a little bland.  I added nutmeg and marjoram to the cinnamon. I also used red onion instead of shallots, and added a clove of garlic. I will decrease the butter next time.  I used regular white mushrooms and baby bellas.

This turned out really good! We like full flavor, so I used the recommended shallots. I also used mostly portabello mushrooms. I also added chicken to give it some protien and substance. I cut it into small cubes and cooked in a little butter with some of the shallots. I also doubled this recipe with the intention of feeding 4 people- but it will only be enough to feed 2 as a meal (my husband is a big eater). For feeding more, adding a salad and breadsticks helped stretch it. I also made it a little early and put it in the crockpot on warm. That way it is ready to go when everyone gets home, and you don't have to worry about scalding or boiling it.

Super easy soup! I tweaked it majorly, as I only had white mushrooms, ordinary cooking onions, and beef broth in the house. It turned out really well, but I would probably leave out the cinnamon next time. I also threw in some chopped garlic as I was sauteeing the onions and mushrooms.

delicious! I used 1/2 cup flour as suggested by another reviewer and it came out very thick and creamy. I think I will add somewhere between 1/2 cup and the 2 tbs the recipe calls for next time. It was very easy and oh so good!

This soup is amazing!!! SOOOO good! I wanted a nice creamy soup on a cold night and I literally licked the bowl!  Grocery store was out of shitake mushrooms, so I used a generous amount of portebello and baby bella mushrooms. Also substituted half and half for heavy cream which made it thick and lucious!! Will make many times again!

It's a very good recipe but I tweaked it a bit...I doubled it and used regular white mushrooms since they are cheaper and that's what I had on hand..I did use the portobello mushrooms..I added garlic to the shallots and mushrooms and added thyme,basil, and oregano to the soup as it was simmering ..then after I put the half and half in I added 6 blend italian cheese. I also omitted the cinnamon because it sounded weird.

Amazing recipe! I've made it multiple times, but make my own changes. I leave out the shallots, and saute minced garlic and a finely chopped white onion before I add the mushrooms. I also use beef broth rather than chicken, as per another reviewer. It is an amazing soup. The leftovers are even amazing! My father has put some of the leftovers on a hamburger, he said that was good, too. Won't ever try another recipe!

This one is definately a keeper. I cook for my family once a week, and since my brother is allergic to milk protein, I had to make quite a few changes that I was unsure about. I used half butter and half oil, and replaced the half-and-half with extra-concentrated soy milk. Also, I couldn't find any portobelloo mushrooms, so I used shiitake muchrooms and oyster mushrooms, both of which are readily available here(China). I didn't have and shallots, so I used yellow onions. Though I am sure it would've tasted even better with the original ingredients, I was very satisfied with this recipe, and will make it again soon :)

This recipe was quick, easy, and DELICIOUS! To make it vegetarian, I used vegetable broth. I also added some cilantro since I had it on hand, and that added a nice flavor. I wish it had turned out more creamy than brothy, maybe next time I'll add less broth or more flour?

So yummy! Loved this recipe as it was really easy with my immersion blender. Also used three types of fresh mushrooms, milk instead of cream, and beef stock. Tasted better than any other mushroom soup I have tasted before- I couldn't believe I made it myself!

Great flavor (I added some garlic powder), a little thin for me so I will thicken with a little more flour next time. I made a triple batch, reheats well. Also used all Portobellos because they were on sale. Super easy to make, going into the regular rotation.

This was yummy even though I used beef stock and evaporated milk because that was what I had on hand. I liked it so well I would probably just use the beef stock next time I make it. It was very rich, despite using the evaporated milk.

It's sad how few people like mushrooms. This soup was delicious and smelled soooo good! I didn't have shallots so I used onion. Also added garlic. No cream on hand so I used evaporated milk. For the people who said it looks like dishwater, was that before you added the cream/milk, because adding the cream changes the whole appearance.

I've been wanting a great mushroom soup recipe for a long time. I always open a can of campbells for my kids on a lazy sunday afternoon.I used a new chopper that I got from "chefables" that I am in love with and had this soup done in about the same amount of time it takes me to whisk milk into the snotty, coagulated condensed version!!I opted for no onion (love onion but didn't feel it was going to be the right flavour for my pallet) and was sooo thrilled with this soup. Cinnamon has got to be the most perfect flavour to finnish thing off, cudos to you!!

this was a great recipe! i used just sliced mushrooms and then before i added the cream (I used heavy cream vs. half and half) i threw it in the food processor for a few seconds to get everything good and equally blended. turned out great!

Awesome recipe. We made it as directed, but with 1 package of shitake, and one of portabella. GOOD soup! Served with french bread, and we are happy!!

This is a fantastic recipe, one of my husbands favorites.  I made this soup for my family (12 servings for only 5 people) and we ate it all.  The sad part was that it was only a side dish.  I did make a couple of modifications to the recipe.  First, I used a combination of button and portobella mushrooms.  Second, I used green onion finely chopped instead of shallots.  Lastly, I omitted the cinnamon.  The soup was wonderful.

I've made this several times and EVERYBODY Loves it.  I add a dash of McCormick’s ground Chipotle Chile Pepper to add a little smokiness.  Delicious.

Wonderful!!!  Absolutely loved it!  I used a variety of dried mushrooms I bought from Costco.  I even put in too much cinnamon by accident.  It will be added to my tried & trues!

Pretty good stuff and really easy. It is rich, though! I think next time I will try using a bit less butter and a mix of mix and 1/2 and 1/2. But overall we liked it.

May I add my "yums" to the other reviews? This is a very easy, tasty soup that can be altered by the cook. I used canned mushrooms and some Paula Deen seasoning plus some tarragon. Used my new stick blender to puree. I had used only 1 and 1/2 cups mushroom in the soup. I added the other 1/2 at the end, non-pureed. Terrific recipe.

I've been searching a long time for easy to make, yet delicious mushroom soup. And this is it! It doesn't take more than 30mins to cook and ingredients are easy to get. Made this at least 3 times. Boyfriend and family just can't get enough. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe! Will continue making this for a very long time.

Loved it - used all shiitake mushrooms, made for a very strong mushroom taste. Also used onion instead of shallots, blended all of it to make it smooth.  Even my mom (the pickiest eater in the world!) loved it!

I omitted the shallots as I ran out but substituted a large onion instead.  Omitted the cinnamon too, and blended it.  Returned to the pan to warm it up and just before serving added some cream and it was absolutely smashing.

Great Soup! Very flavorful. It is also very good with just white mushrooms. This is my 17 year old sons number 1 request for a meal. Thanks for the great recipe.

I've made this twice, and it's been a big hit.  I've varied the types of mushrooms, and the second time I also added some boiled potato for some bulk.  The cinnamon adds a very, very nice touch and compliments the flavor of the mushrooms.  I checked around the website and followed the advice of other recipes and added a 1/4 cup of sherry to the recipe as well.  This is definitely a recipe I will keep!

Wow, this is excellent! I made it with brown mushrooms instead and it's fantastic! I also added a little extra chicken base to juice up the flavour, but it would have been fine without it. Highly recommend this recipe!

Good basic soup, but like others have said, it is a little bland. Really easy to make, and it was fun to experiment with. I added some Marsala wine for flavor and beef boullion for color.
