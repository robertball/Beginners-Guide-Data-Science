Delectable with a very nice presentation.  My boyfriend called it "festive".  I wanted to try something different and this was it.  My son didn't like the nuts but loved the filling.  My boyfriend keeps eating it and requested it again for Christmas. We had some leftover in the fridge and I put it in the microwave to warm it and it was STILL excellent! I think even better than the first day!   Very easy to make!

this was the first pie i ever made and it was great! i made it for a family reunion pie contest. it was one of the first pies my family cut into (i think the cranberry color got their attention, much more interesting than the staple apple pie) and it was very much enjoyed. very easy to make and people were impressed that i made something with cheese cake on my first try and that it tasted so good. i didn't win the contest but i sure felt good about my effort! thanks for the recipe.

MMMMMMmmmmmm!!! What a delicious recipe.  I didn't have nuts so I substituted that with oatmeal (about 1/2 cup) and cut it in with the flour.  Oh yeah, I also didn't have corn starch so used 2 T. of flour for substitute.

This was very good & very easy to make!  I used a graham cracker ready crust so I skipped the first step.  Everybody loved it!

I made this in a graham cracker crust, and used pecans instead of walnuts.  It got rave reviews for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved the unique blend of cranberries, nuts, and cheesecake type filling.  Really easy, too.  Gave it 4 stars just because I didn't personally love it as much as everyone else did!

I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner & everyone enjoyed it.  Even the people that don't care for cranberries enjoyed it.  I also used a graham cracker crust to make it more like a cheesecake.

Our new favorite pie.  Very easy to make and very good.  The only thing I changed was I used pecans instead of walnuts.  We do not like walnuts.
