Perfect as written! Hubs doesn't love zucchini and only tolerates it gave this one two thumbs up. He thought the overall flavor profile worked perfectly together and I agree. I highly recommend this recipe.

I used chick peas instead of cannellini beans. I also squeezed some lemon juice into the noodles while cooking and added onion powder and seasoning salt. Will definitely make it again.
