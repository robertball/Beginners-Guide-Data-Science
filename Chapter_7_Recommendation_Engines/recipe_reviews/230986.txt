I have never seen blood oranges before. I called my local supermarket and had them special order them for me just to make this recipe :-) I thought it produced a very juicy tasting chicken. I was surprised that it did not have an overwhelming orange taste to it. The sauce is yummy, and I didn't have any white wine, but I did have red wine, so I used that in the sauce and it still tasted great. That is the only thing I did differently about this recipe, otherwise, I followed it exactly. I wouldn't change anything. Great dish!

Husband made a half batch of this recipe, and it was super delicious! Easy, and the instructions provided are excellent for the recipe. Will make again, and again... as long as we can find blood oranges for sale!

Around here, blood oranges  typically end up in a margarita or a martini so this entry is something completely new. I did made a few alterations, the first was using blood orange flavored olive oil that I already had in and second  I did not use two separate pans. Rather removed the chicken to rest then added the onions and garlic to the same pan. After softened, i added the wine, chicken stock and using a flat whisk scraped all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. before returning the chicken to the pan to finish cooking through. Then I added the honey and some Corn starch (mixed with cold water to make a paste) to thicken
 the sauce. This turned out great, and I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!!

Loved this!  I used the juice of 4 blood oranges in my sauce because I bought a bag of smaller sized ones, but it came together beautifully.  My husband came home from work and the first words out of his mouth were, "What smells SO GOOD?"  We loved the flavor, and will definitely make it again.

Pretty decent. Nice and mild, with that hint of orange. Near the end, I thickened the sauce with a tablespoon of cornstarch and water, but it was nothing out of this world. Not worth the excessive work.

It was amazing! I did add a little extra garlic and accidentally doubled the honey. I was worried that it would be too sweet, but it was still perfect. I will definitely make it again.

I modified this to substitute Elderflower syrup instead of the honey because I was excited to try it and thought it would be interesting with the orange juice, which it was! Very tasty!! Thank you!

Loved it. Made it a last month when blood orange was still in season. Will make again as soon as I can get my hands on some blood oranges

This was a decent meal. We liked it but we didn't love it.  The only thing I did differently was omit the honey because my husband hates sweet flavors with meat, and I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  We ate it on rice and it was pretty good.  I would probably make this again.

Meh.. Not very flavorful.  SAUCE WAS BETTER ON THE WHITE RICE THAN ON THE CHICKen.
