OH MY GOODNESS! I have NEVER had this pie before.  It was like a combination of butterscotch and vanilla and melt in your mouth GOOD!  The only thing I wasn't sure of was whether or not I should pre-bake the crust... I did not.. and it turned out SMASHING! Anytime I have leftover buttermilk from my famous pancakes, I am most certainly going to make this pie again and again! THANK YOU!

I reduced the sugar in this recipe to a cup and added 2/3 cup sweetened coconut flakes and 2/3 cup of chocolate chips and 4 eggs instead of 3. My family now loves this and I make it for all the potluck dinners I go to and get rave reviews and numerous requests for my recipe. I hope you enjoy!! Never be afraid to experiment!!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I followed the instructions exactly and the only change I made was a sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar on the top before baking.  If you like pecan pie but find it to be too rich then I encourage you to try this one.  It is very similar in flavor but not nearly as heavy and rich as pecan pie.  In fact,the next time I make it I'm going to try it as a base for a pecan pie.  It couldn't be easier to make and the ingredients are very inexpensive.  All I had to buy was the buttermilk.  And don't worry if you hate buttermilk (as I certainly do) you won't even taste it.  This is a very creamy, sweet, and highly addictive pie!

Although it was great overall, I think it would be better with a little less sugar. To me, it tasted like almost pure sugar.

I saw a show on TV about a resturant that served Buttermilk pie. I never heard of it and decided that I would look up a recipe. Not only is this recipe easy its wonderful. I took the advice on some reviews and reduced the amount of sugar. My crust didn't burn and I even left it in the oven 10 minutes longer to brown the top some more. The top is crunchy and mixes well with the gooey inside. This is so good! I really didn't know what to expect, but I am pleasantly surprised. It is really sweet and has a wonderful after taste. I can't wait to take this work, I am sure everyone will love it.

This pie was very good with a rich, tangy, buttery custard that melts in your mouth.  I took the recommendation of another reviewer and cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups, but I felt like it was still too sweet.  I like to taste the flavor of the dish, not just the sugar.  Next time, I'll cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cup.  Otherwise a very easy and very tasty pie.

This was the BEST pie!  I had never made it before...and my family just raved over it.  However, I did take the advice of one reviewer and instead of 2 cups of sugar I used 1 3/4, and I had forgotten to buy a deep dish so I divided the pies into two regular 9" shells and baked two pies.  It turned out great and I have already shared the recipe.

I followed the instruction to a "T" and product two delicous pies. It was a hit at work, both pies were gone before the ,iddle of my shift. Simple to make and tastes great!! Can't bet those qualities about it.

Very Good! This pie was so simple and delicious. I had never had buttermilk pie before, and this was a smash. I did add some tart apples to the recipe for just some added fruit, by barely getting them tender over low heat with some sugar and cinnamon. I added this before I poured the filling into the pie, some of the apples floated to the top, and baked up absolutely gorgeous and were very very tasty!

Excellent! I can't cook, but I love to eat...so I decided to try recipes from this site!  This pie is so wonderful, my family was thrilled that I could cook something.  My cousin said "although the pie is hot and it has burned my tongue, I can't stop eating it!"

My children and I have insatiable appetites for sweets.  We can eat pounds of candy, or brown sugar right out of the bag--if I were to allow it.  So when I read the warnings about this pie being too sweet, I thought, "There's no such thing as too sweet!"  Well, let me tell you, this is too sweet.  Way too sweet.  Even my children complained!  If I make this again I'll use only 1 1/2 cups sugar, or less.

This pie was so easy to put together!  I did not have buttermilk so I used 1 cup milk with 1 tablespoon lemon juice.  I did mess up with the oven temperature.  I reduced to 350 instead of 325, so this baby came out of the oven about 15 minutes sooner.  It came out beautiful with the top and crust nice and golden.  I will make this again.

Very sweet, yet very good.  I have used this recipe several times. It's very easy to make.   My 12 year old niece has asked me to make one for her birthday!  As one of the other reviewers mentioned, low fat buttermilk does not work, unless you add a teaspoon of cornstarch to the mixture to thicken it.

2 Cups of sugar!?!? Way too much. I used 1 1/4 cups as others have suggested and it came out just right. Buttermilk pie is a great pie classic.

Yummy! I've never had a buttermilk pie before and it sure was good! I made 2 standard 9in pies with some minor adjustments... I halved the sugar and right before I put it in the oven I sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg on top. This is my new recipe to use up leftover buttermilk!!

I loved buttermilk pie growing up, so I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner. When I went to get a piece of pie, it was gone! Everyone loved it. Since then, I've made this about 5 times. I think sprinkling cinnamon and sugar makes for a more appealing crust on top. I've also made a homemade crust and storebought. You cannot tell the difference, so I will use storebought! I dust the crust with flour before putting in pie plate as the box says to keep it from getting soggy.

I have made this recipe several times. I follow
this recipe to a tee. I found this here on All
recipes a couple years ago. You can not go wrong with this pie. It is delicious and SO easy. I have tried several things. Fat Free buttermilk is not good at all. For a richer creamer pie use Bavarian Buttermilk. Try this pie you'll fall in love with it. THANKS to the submitter it's a family favorite around the holidays.......

Delicious! I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and it was plenty sweet. I used twice a much vanilla because I love the flavor. The sugar carmelized and gave the pie a slight caramel flavor that I absolutely loved. I wouldn't make this pie with anything but whole buttermilk. Will gladly make this pie again.

I hate buttermilk pies, but it's my boyfriend's favorite because his mom used to make it for him.  This is the only recipe I have found that I love! Had to make changes though: there is too much filling for a deep dish, so I either do one deep dish and a small personal pie, or two regular pie shells. if you do 2 regular pies at same time- I put on a cookie sheet, cook at 375 for 15 min and 350 for 30.  They turn out perfect!

My boyfriend used this recipe and it was amazing.  We had way to much filling though it filled 2 9 in deep dish pie pans.  It was VERY good! We will make it again for sure!! He even liked it and he is very picky!

Super easy and absolutely wonderful! VERY sweet and great texture. You can also bake at 350 degrees for the whole hour if you prefer a completely creamy pie with no crispy top.

Yummy, it must be a forgiving recipe. I substituted coconut flavoring for the vanilla and used 2 regular pie crust instead of the deep dish, simply because that it what I had on hand. We really enjoyed it, thanks for the recipe.

Wow! I tell you what! This pie is the king of all buttermilk pies. After trying several store-bought pies and tasting them at pie auctions and bake offs (I love to taste) I finally decided to bake my own. This was the fist recipe I tried and the only recipe i will try, and I finally realize why buttermilk pies have transcended throughout the ages. My family worships this pie and are convinced I am the only one who knows how to make a pie (they call it my famous buttermilk pie...shhh)and now expect it at any gathering or event. Just three tweeks more butter, less sugar, and little to no lemon. It'll have 'em beggin' for more.

I used butter.  My family liked it therefore I will rate 4, but I think next time I will separate my eggs, beat the egg whites until fluffy and fold in gently as I wished it turned out lighter.

Yum, yum, yum, yum!  I cut the sugar back to 1 1/4 cups and it was the perfect amount for us.  Also used my own homemade pie crust.  Absolutely awesome!  Turned out fabulous!

I made this for my husband's Christmas party at work and everybody loved it.  I will be making one for Christmas lunch.  The only change I made was I used butter instead of margarine.

Great recipe.  I did cut the sugar to one cup and it proved to be plenty.  Might even reduce it a little more next time.  Sprinkled cinnamon on the top like another reviewer.  Very good!  Thanks!

I don't know what it is about this pie, but I loved it!  I had extra buttermilk & needed to use it up.  I found this recipie & what a keeper!  It baked up beautifully & smelled wonderful. The texture is like custard.  It was firm & nice to slice.  I reduced the sugar by 1/2 because that seemed to be the general recomendation amongst reviewers & it worked perfectly!  This is soooo easy to make!

My husband wouldn't try buttermilk pie b4 but this time he did and he loved it.  I used ready-made gramcracker crust and he said that did it for him.  It is too sweet for me so I will go to 1 1/2 cups sugar next time.  we still have buttermilk and my hubby already suggested I made another one.

Wow, this was sweet, even with the sugar cut down to 1 1/2 cups as other reviewers suggested.  The taste reminds me of tapioca pudding for some reason.  I put a tin foil cover over the pie for the last 15 minutes of baking because it was starting to brown too much.  Super super easy recipe!

This is, without a doubt, the best buttermilk pie recipe ever!! I had never before liked buttermilk pie, then I tried this recipe. Buttermilk pies have always been a favorite of my family's, and I did most of the baking last year for the holidays. I decided to try it, and I ended up eating way too much of it! :-) I did make the mistake of not getting the deep pie crust, I had gotten two packages of the regular crust, so I was able to make 4 pies... they did not make it to Thanksgiving(only 2 days away)! I was up late the night before baking them again, then hiding them so we could have them for the Thanksgiving. 

Thank you so much for this recipe, it is now one that we all look forward to making(due to the ease of it) and enjoying!

I made this for 5 of us and no one really liked it.  It was really sweet and didn't have a lot of flavor. A few people said it tasted like flan or Pecan Pie without the pecans.  We all agreed it would taste better with something tart like lemon in the batter or unsweetened raspberries or strawberries on top.  The top also burned which I noticed 5 minutes before the timer went off. Luckily, the burned layer peeled right off. I will not be making it again.

My family loved this one, however, I only gave this 4 stars because I used less sugar (I think 2 cups would have been overwhelmingly sweet) and I used butter instead of margarine.  Also, as an experiment, I made two pies; one with only 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons of sugar (just in case 1 cup wasn't enough since I was cutting way back from 2 cups) using the baking temperatures given in the recipe; and the next day, I made the other using only 1 cup of sugar and baking at 350 degrees for 1 hour as one reviewer recommended.  The  winner:  the "1 cup, 350 degree for 1 hour pie" hands down was the best because it really tasted like vanilla custard.  Also, it wasn't as dark on the top so being less carmelized (than the first pie), that cut down on the sweetness as well.  Next time, I may even bake it for an extra 3 to 5 minutes since there was a very thin layer on the bottom that was gelled but like pudding...but so good though!  In contrast to my first pie with the extra 2 tablespoons of sugar simply tasted sweet.  It was good but I see that the extra sugar didn't allow the vanilla flavor to come through.

I made this pie today and it was delicious!  I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups as suggested and I am glag I did because it definitely would have been too sweet.  I used a stick of butter instead of margerine and I reduced the temp to 350 for the first 15 the 325 for 1 hr.  It wasn't runny at all, it firmed up nicely.  Will definitely make it again!

My husband called from work and requested this pie.....my first time making one and it is delicious!! He says it tastes like the one his "old aunt" used to make when he was younger! I will surely be making this one again and again! I lessened the sugar by 1/2 cup....still sweet enough for us! THANK YOU!

This recipe is so easy to make. I have become addictive to this pie. I love it. I cook it for an half hour at 400 degrees and then for 45 minutes at 350. I have given this recipe to some of my friends and they love it.

4 star for potential.  I should've read some of the reviews first.  I thought 2 cups of sugar was too much but went for it anyway. DEFINITELY way too much.  I baked as directed and the insides are still a little wet.  I cut a piece out already to taste, going to put it back in the oven and hopefully it'll be able to bake up some more.  Will probably make this again, but cutting out some of the sugar and maybe do as others, cut down the temperature of the oven and bake a little bit longer.

Very good.  I used butter instead of margarine and more vanilla.  It was very sweet, but that is what a Buttermilk Pie is! :)  Top browned a little too dark, probably a problem with my oven.  I tried to cover with non-stick sprayed foil and accidentally took off part of that... ended up looking GREAT anyway!  Watch the actual time in oven at the end.  Mine could have taken another 2-3 minutes in order to set really well.

Excellent!  Based on other reviews,  I used less sugar (1 1/2 CUPS), and I added 1 T. vanilla.  Before I started mixing anything, I brought every ingredient to room temp.  This was for my mom's b'day and it was a huge success.  Thx for the recipe!

Easy to make, impossible to ruin (if you keep to the recipe), and without a doubt, a 'melt in your mouth' pie.

Yes, a bit sugary but still an excellent pie.  I will make this again but reduce the sugar as well.  Very easy to prepare.

Delicious. I decreased the amount of sugar by 1/2 cup and I have to agree with some of the other reviews that it was still pretty sweet. Next time I'll try it with only 1 c. sugar. A great recipe though and chances are I will make it again.

Excellent!  I sprinkled sugar and some cinnamon on top which created a caramelized layer on the top - very good!  Better than the other ones I have tried.

I made this pie for Christmas and the filling didnt set for some reason. I took it out because it was starting to burn. But I know if the filling did set it would have been a good pie. Im going try another recipe.

This Buttermilk Pie was delicious. I didn't feel that is had too much sugar. I followed the recipe exactly. I may use two regular pie crust next time and decrease the cooking time when using two crust. Thanks for a new family favorite.

This pie filling was very good but I did cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups, the 1/2 cup butter was too much and my pie crust was oozing butter.  The filling was awesome but it was too much to eat the crust and the filling together--I would make again with less sugar and less butter.

If you want a great buttermilk pie, by golly this is it!  I made a Father's Day spread and had buttermilk left over from other recipes that I made.  My father loves buttermilk pie, and last minute (who knows why), I thought I would look up a recipe and throw it together.  Well, it was a rare good last minute idea and it was completely devoured.  I got one small piece, there were no leftovers.  In fact, my father told everyone that since it was father's day, that the pie should belong solely to him. He only got one piece too.  Poor guy!  But no worries b/c I still have some buttermilk left and as easy as this was, I will be surprising him with his very own tonight!  I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and it was perfect.  I love any and all things sweet, so I probably would have loved it w/2 cups.  But I didn't want to make it too sweet for my guest. 5 stars for sure!!

I have made this twice now. The first time I took it out 5 minutes early because the top was getting so dark. That was a mistake as it was too runny. The second time, I covered it with foil towards the end and left it in for an extra five minutes. It was still a bit runny, but not so bad. It thickened up after I put it in the fridge. Will I make this again? Maybe if I have the ingredients already, but only then. Tasted pretty good.

It's taken me a long time to get around to reviewing this. I've been using this recipe for years.  The only change I've ever made was to substitute real butter for margarine.  This is so delicious and it's the first dessert that's gone on Thanksgiving and Christmas.

This pie has a wonderful taste, but toooooo much sugar and butter.. I only ate 1 slice and trashed the rest.. I'll make this pie again for sure, but only use one cup of sugar and half stick of butter... Overall good pie!!

I tried buttermilk pie several years ago and fell in love.  I have tried this recipe twice and it is delicious.  The problem I am having is getting the filling to set up properly.  I am following the directions to a tee but have had this problem both times.  The second time, I baked the pie for 15 min longer than instructed hoping that would help but it was still kinda runny even after being refrigerated for several hours.  Maybe next time I will try to use two regular pie shells instead of the deep dish.  I haven't given up on it...yet.  Taste is still delicious.

I have always wanted to try this kind of pie but I was very disappointed with this particular recipe.......the pie filling leaked all over the oven and made a huge smoky mess in my house and even after following the recipe exactly and for how long it said to cook them, my pie was still runny...I even cooked it longer and it still didn't turn out!!!! Very disappointed!

Oh My Stars!!!  This was AMAZING!  For such simple ingredients, the results were FAB-U-LOUS!!   I did put foil around the edges and probably should have also covered the whole pie at the start and taken off the middle half way through.  I used 1 3/4 sugar as suggested and since this is basically a vanilla pie, I used about a tablespoon of real/LOW Alcohol Vanilla and was glad I did.  I would probably take the advice of others and add one more tablespoon of flour next time to help absorb the butter. It was so good hot and it was so good cold - either way was just perfect!  I can't wait to share the goodness with my kin-family, work family and my Whole Backstage Theater family at the next pitch-in!

I needed items to sell at a youth bake sale and had buttermilk on hand. Since disposable pie tins are rather small, I chose 12 servings and it filled those smaller crusts perfectly. Topped one with coconut, one with cinnamon and another with nutmeg. Did use one stick of butter and 1/2 stick margarine, 2 cups sugar, five eggs, and the rest as portioned by the recipe for 12 servings. Now it is hard to take all three to the sale - smell divine.

Pretty good. But this recipe wasn't as good as another I have tried on this site, which I can't find, but continuing my search.

This was always my brothers favorite pie and nobody but my mother used to make it. So I used this recipe and made him one as a gift on Christmas eve... he ate half sitting right in front of me and finished the other half maybe an hour later! I had to make 6 of them within 1 weeks time! HUGE hit and will now be tradition every year! Thanks so much for sharing!

Buttermilk pie was something I grew up eating in the south. I recently turned my husband onto eating it (he's from Michigan). He begged me to make one for Christmas. I found this recipe and it seemed very similar to what I've been eating for years. It was very easy to make and came out wonderful. One of the elders in the family said they had been eating buttermilk pie for years and never had one this good. That was a big deal for me. So needless to say this is a pie I'm sure I'll be making time and time again. I'm sure they'll be no complaints either. Especially since I was asked when I'd be making another :)

There is way too much sugar in this. I cut it back to 1 1/2 per other reviews. It was still good but I prefer the Buttermilk Pie on this site.

Who would have known that buttermilk pie could be so good? Reminded me of a hot cream cheese flan. I did alter the recipe and only used 1 cup of sugar. Next time, I would like to try the recipe as is to compare the 2 results. Used "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust." This flaky crust was perfect with this pie.

Buttermilk pie is a tradition at our house and I lost the recipe.  Decided to try this one.  Hubby is the Bmilk pie freak and he said it was the best one I had ever made.  I reduced the sugar to a little shy of 2 cups but other than that followed the recipe to a T, which is suprising because the other recipe called for three cups sugar which I always reduced.  Anyway, thanks so much for the recipe.  I'm making it again today cause I bought too much buttermilk!

Wow, this is very good.  I used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup Splenda and it's very very sweet.  I may cut back the margarine next time to about 1/2 a stick instead of a full stick and I did use fat-free buttermilk.  The pie is very rich and yummy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I really enjoyed this flavor of pie! Smooth, vanilla and buttery taste...delicious. I sprinkled cinnamon on top. Forgot to add salt. I'm guessing that would cut some of the sugar. I'm making this every Thanksgiving now.

As written, I think this is a little too sweet.  I took another user's suggestion and used 1 1/4 c sugar, 4 eggs, and added some shredded coconut and this made a great coconut custard pie.

I'd never had buttermilk pie before making this.  I had a pre-baked pie crust to use up and some buttermilk, so I tried it.  It was very nice, everything we like about pumpkin pie, but without the pumpkin flavor, so there's no one who won't like it.  Thanks for posting!

I love this receipe.  The only modification that I make is to reduce the sugar by half and it's then sweet enough.

Baked this pie weekend before last and it was great.  Added cream cheese which was good but lumpy my fault.    Baked it again this weekend for our family reunion on Labor Day followed the recipe and other reviews about the sugar and they loved it.

I made this pie last night but forgot to follow some of the other reviewers suggestions about reducing the sugar. If I can get past the sugary sweetness I'm sure I'll enjoy this pie. My husband liked it, although he agreed that it was a bit sweet. I'll make it again but will reduce the sugar to 1-1/2 cups. I also added a bit of cinnamon.

FANTASTIC!  Normally, I always follow ingredients exactly the FIRST time I make it, however, I thought butter would be better than margarine.  Other than that, I followed the directions & ingredients exactly.  I would recommend watching your cooking time carefully & removing the pie while it still has a "jiggle" to the dead center.  If you don't like rich & sweet pie, this is NOT your recipe.  My family thought the flavor was slightly reminiscent of creme brulee'.  I served this warm with a dollop of not-too-sweet homemade whipped cream.  It was HEAVENLY!  This did not have an "eggy" flavor like some of the other buttermilk pie recipes I had tried.  Absolutely scrumptious!

Very very good! After trying this several times I have made a few changes. I use Brown sugar instead of white, but reduced the amount to 1 cup. For us this is just right! Not to sweet! I also increased the flower to 4 Tbls. I also reduced the salt to just under 1/4 teaspoon. This recipe is better than money!! Thank you Carla!

Should be called Sugar Buttermilk Pie! It looked great out of the oven, made an interesting crispy crust on the top, but seemed like too much sugar. I haven't tried making this before, only had someone else's who refuses to part with her recipe, so I will keep trying!

I'm giving this a four star rating, and the only reason that it doesn't get a five is, I guess, a difference of taste. The recipe works well as written; you get a lovely buttermilk pie--although even with careful checking of my oven temp with a thermometer, I had to shorten the baking time a little. However, it is, to my palate, at least, incredibly sweet--too much so, I think. On my first try, I made it according to the reduced-sugar suggestion, and even that was too much. I think a version of this could be made with as little as 1 cup of sugar, actually. As the original recipe goes, however, the pie is really pretty, a very nice presentation.

Mine got very brown on the top as some other readers posted, but I covered it with foil, but it still took much longer to cook than directed....so maybe my oven is different, I don't know.  Other than that it was yummy, very sweet, reminds me of chess pie.

Oh, my gosh, this is good! I agree that the 1-3/4 c of sugar is way plenty, but this goes in my "good stuff" recipe box for frequent use. It's best served slightly warm.

This was okay.  It was really sweet even for me and I love sweets.  It was bland too so I don't think cutting down on sugar would be worth it.  I won't make it again.

This was great.  I did reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I also put tin foil over the pie for the last 8 minutes or so. I also added a touch of nutmeg.  I made this for a family dinner and got rave reviews.

I am mainly giving this one star for looks. I followed recipe 15 min at 400 and then 325 for 45 min and the pie is sooo brown!! I thought it was going to burn. The crust is really dark. It is for a friend so I didnot eat any but am wondering whether I should give to her or just throw away and go for another recipe. I was making for her because she loves buttermilk pie. Is this the way they are suppose to look??

This is the first time I've tasted buttermilk pie and it turned out great. I was concerned about it browning too fast, but after adding a few aditional minutes for the center to set, everything was perfect. Very sweet even after using 1 1/2 cups of sugar.

A sweet and delicate pie. Taking care of other reviewers' opinion, I decreased sugar to 1 1/2 cup, but I think it might have been as good as it was with 2 cups. I unfortunately did the mistake to chill the pie, which "killed" a little bit its delicate taste, but otherwise it was a success. I served it with warm molasses, and it was a top.

I had never heard of this pie before and initially I was skeptical - sounded boring.  BOY, WAS I WRONG!  It was DELICIOUS!!  I even tried to convince my 13-year old that he wouldn't like it and that he should give his piece to me.  He took one bite and said "No way"!  Thanks for a keeper!

I’ve been making this recipe every thanksgiving for quite a while. It is soo delicious! I’ve made it exactly as called for originally but I prefer the crust to be a bit more “baked” so now I par bake the crust a bit before I fill it, usually about 5 mins. Then I bake it for 325 for a hour. Turns out perfect.

I looked at the reviews and cut the sugar to 1 cup, increased vanilla and used 3 farm fresh small eggs. I did not have buttermilk to substitute sour cream thinned with whole milk. I also added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. I only had a graham cracker crust on hand so used it. Baked up nice at 350 for 45 minutes. There was a slight bitter taste but otherwise was good. I think using a pastry crust would have been preferable.

Flavors were outstanding! Added a tsp of cinnamon and I was glad I did. When mixing the ingredients the filling does curdle, but do not worry! It bakes perfectly. Also, I preheated a cookie sheet to place the pie on and that helps to prevent the bottom from becoming soggy.

It was alright...I think I'd rename this Sugar Pie. Yes, I cut the sugar down to 1.25 cup. I don't know WHY I was imagining a custard-like concoction here. The result was fine but I was kind of disappointed, which is why I'm awarding this three stars. The kids love it, and it's for sure edible...I was just looking for a creamy, oh my goodness consistency, which is not what this is. Probably wouldn't bother again. I gotta go make some custard now.

We really liked this pie. I did use what I had on hand. Butter in place of margarine and I made my buttermilk. I also reduced the sugar by a 1/2 cup. Try it, you might be pleasantly surprised. Will make again and think it would be a good pie for special occasions.

Last year for Christmas, my fiancee had asked me to make him a buttermilk pie (being from Illinois, I'd never heard of them or had one).  We tried a recipe from this site last year, but have since misplaced it.  He thought it was this one, but after making it last night, we now know it is not.  This is a decent recipe, but it is very very sweet!  Next time, we'll reduce the sugar in this recipe.  Additionally, if you want your pie to have the crunchy caramel layer on top, cook it closer to the top of your oven; if you want more of a fluffy quiche-like pie, cook it on the bottom of your oven (we cooked two and this is how it happened).  If you're worried about it being too runny, let your pie sit in the fridge overnight and it will congeal and not be like pudding.  Another thing that we had a problem with was that this pie had butter sitting between the filling and the bottom crust.  So we'll either reduce the butter or add a little more flour to help with that.  Overall, a decent pie, but very sweet; adjust sugar to your own taste.

My family doesn't like pie crust, so for the first time ever, I made a pie without a crust using this recipe. I read the reviews for tips, so I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, then added coconut flakes and chocolate chips, as well as sprinkled cinnamon on top.  Took an additional 10 minutes in my oven, but came out perfect!  The taste and texture were divine. I grew up in Illinois and often had this for big family get-togethers.  Will be making again!

My family had never heard of this, but I made it exactly as the recipe describes and it came out great. Only thing I did different was just a little sprinkle of cinnamon on the top.  My Dad ate all of the leftovers.  I used a ready made pie crust and put it in the plate uncooked and then added the batter and baked.

I had no problems with the pie over flowing or cooking time. The only problem I had was the sugar wouldn't cream for me...I have no idea why this happened. The end product was very sweet but good. I used sugar free cool whip on it and that toned down the sugar a little. Also; this pie tasted better, the longer it sat. My son will love this pie because it tastes like pecan pie without the nuts and that right up his alley.

It was AWESOME! I followed others recommendations and one put 1 1/4c sugar. Also, I had to cover loosely with foil to keep from burning and removed it the last 15 minuets. I didn't know where to place it in the oven so I chose the center rack. I doubled the recipe and it worked wonderfully! Thank you for this recipe my Mom has made it for years and I lost the recipe, but this is so close maybe better!

This pie was good, but as many people have said, it was extremely sweet.  I had already cut the sugar by about a 1/3 of a cup, but next time I would definitely use 1.5 cups.  Also, I baked this in a stoneware that I have only used a few times before, and by the time the top was finished, the bottom was still slightly underdone, so if you're using stoneware I would suggest leaving it in for a bit longer.  Still a really tasty pie, and I will definitely make it again with the altered sugar measurement. :)

This was my first buttermilk pie.  I used a frozen crust from the supermarket.  Kept all ingredients the same.  I did dd some cinnamon into the mix and also sprinkled some on top during baking.  I baked it at the temperature and time stated on the recipe.  Overall, it's a delicious pie.  Tasted even better the next day.  When I make it next time, I may bake the pie shell a bit before pouring in the mixture.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars but only because of the amount of sugar this recipe requires.  I don't like "sugary-sweet" so I cut down the amount of sugar in this pie to 1 cup and next time I make this, I may cut it down to a little more than 3/4 cup.  Overall the recipe is very good, especially served warm.

I made this pie for the first time today and it is GREAT! Very easy to follow directions and not to sweet just right. I did add coconut for texture, but didn't change anything else. This is going to be a well used recipe. Thank you so much Carla for sharing this,

I made the recipe as stated with only one exception, I added nutmeg and cinnamon.  I took it to a church potluck and it was a hit.  I will certainly make it again.

Wanted to make something sweet with limited ingredients. This hit the spot. Reminds me of a chess pie but tangier because of the buttermilk.

I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups the second time i made this recipe, it tasted too sweet with 2 cups of sugar, i also added 1 cup of blueberries which made it taste like  a blueberry custard in a pie crust. If you are going to add fruit add an extrat tblsp or two of flour to take the liquid out of the fruit.

This pie was good. I have had better buttermilk pie and I have had worse. I had a problem with butter "pooling" on top of my pie while it was baking. I have never had this happen before. This made me have to bake the pie longer. Don't get me wrong I ate the whole pie (over a few days) but I feel like there are better recipes for this pie. Make sure you cream the butter with the sugar. That is the most important part! If I am in need of a quick dessert I might come back to this.

This was pretty dang good.  I had never had it before, and it tastes of a combination of caramel and toffee with a texture between cheesecake and pudding - it is firm, but creamy.  If you have ever cooked butter on the stove and tasted the change, it is similar.  I used a store-bought crust - be sure to use deep dish, or else you'll have leftover filling.  Everyone at work, to my surprise, raved over this.  And it is VERY easy.  I will definitely have to make it again.

Outstanding....I had made this pie years ago when I was first married and lost the recipe in all our moves, but coming across this was a godsend.  Tasted exactly how I remember.  Sweet and delicious.  Very easy to make and good warm or cold.  Thanks so much Carla

YUM!!!!!  Turned out wonderfully. I followed the directions exactly, well except for the Margarine. I used butter.   This is the first time I've made it and I was worried because.. 1.  I NEVER bake with Margarine, so I used butter.  Wasn't sure if it would make a difference. If it did, I didn't notice. ;) 2.  When I baked for the full time specified, it still didn't seem "set" but I took it out anyway and as it cooled, it became the perfect consistency.  Our favorite part is the top of the pie.  Delish!  The whole family raved about it.  The sweetness is just perfect.

Wow, this was very yummy and very simple!  I did pre-bake the crust about 5 min.  I dont know if it was necessary, but the crust came out perfect.

This was a very good pie. I did think that it was way too sweet, and I only used 1 3/4 c of sugar...I would suggest using less. Also, the crust starting getting a little too brown, so I covered it with foil. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe just didn't cut it for me. I love buttermilk pie and have made others before from another recipe. Make sure you do cook longer than recipe calls for. Mine was runny towards the bottom. Will try Buttermilk Pie III next time.

This recipe was RIGHT ON! I did not know it was this easy to make buttermilk pie! My family loves Buttermilk pie but no one would make it. We would always have Sweet Potato and Pecan but never Buttermilk until this christmas thanks to this recipe and allrecipes.com. This website is going to help me cook more often!

This was pretty good, but too sweet for me.  I plan on making it again, but will decrease the amount of sugar I use next time!

Really easy. I used a bit less sugar. It was gone in minutes. Everyone liked it and several -Northerners ;)had never heard of buttermilk pie and loved it!
