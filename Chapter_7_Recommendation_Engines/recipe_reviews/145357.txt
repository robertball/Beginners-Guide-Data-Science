This is probably an acquired taste. It tasted sort of like a peanut butter and jelly fruit salad, which is probably exactly what it's supposed to taste like. Kids will probably like it better than adults. I think I can eat it, but ....I wish I'd left out the peanut butter!

I must admit I did not follow the recipe. I left out the peanut butter and used the fruit that my 3 boys like. They rated it 5 stars! What a cool little treat for breakfast.
