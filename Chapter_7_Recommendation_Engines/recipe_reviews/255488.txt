A delicious, smooth and spicy soup. I left out the cream, as written in the notes. After tasting it, I realized it needed the cream. It was good without. It was even better with the cream. Thank you for the recipe.

It was a very cold fall day, so I was in the mood for a great hot soup.  I made this to the T, but I found it lacking in flavor.  It was hot and filling, but not a repeat for us.

this is the BEST potato soup EVER!!! the leeks & chipotle combination is just WONDERFUL!!! I did add more potato's as we like creamy thick texture and the recipe is thinner, but the taste is over the top good! I did add extra chipotles - I mean we're in Texas y'all!!
