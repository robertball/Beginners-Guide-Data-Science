This was only the 2nd thing that I've tried cooking in a slow cooker and it came out so delicious!  I did add about 1/4 cup of water to the bottom to avoid burning and I added onion slices on top of each pork chop as I was layering.  The result was incredible, no knife required, and the slightly thinned onion loaded sauce was good on my potatoes.  I'm going to try the leftovers over rice.

This is a good basic recipe.  My family really enjoyed the Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken BBQ recipe by Zanne Peters from this website which had these additional ingredients:  1/2 cup of italian dressing, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 2 tbsp. of worcestershire sauce.    If you want to add a little kick to  this recipe, I would suggest adding these along with the BBQ sauce of your choice.   It gives it a great taste whether you're using chicken or pork!!  Thanks!

DELICOUS! The meat just fell off the bone. I let it cook on high for about 3.5 hours, then I turned it to low and cooked for another hour or so. I also had some leftover homecooked barbeque sauce that I spread on each chop, then topped each with the bottled sauce. I then poured the remaining over the whole top. I served them with mashed potatoes and green beans. My family loved them. I will definitely make these again.

I picked this recipe because it seemed so easy. I bought a good bottle of BBQ sauce. I added 1/2 c of chopped onion and I added 1/2 c of water. I cooked it like suggested, but the last 30 mins turn it down too low. My husband and girls liked it a lot. However my husband said the sauce was to thin. I told him I had read everyone on the site, said add some water to help it not burn. He said I didn't need too. Next time we make it we will not add the water and see if it is better. It was easy and tasty. thank you for sharing your idea.

This recipe will definitely be one of our favs.  I sprinkled the chops with Garlic Powder and Onion Powder before cooking and added 1/2 cup water to the sauce in the bottom of the pan and mixed it well.  I cooked them on high for 2 1/2 hrs and low for 30 minutes.  They were so tender the meat fell off the bone.  Everyone loved them !  I wish everything was this easy.

This was a good recipe and I'll use it again. I used boneless pork chops and found that after 3 hours on high, the meat was a little dry. The next time I make this recipe, I'll only cook the pork chops for 2.5 hours. I added some water, yellow onions, brown sugar and worcerstershire (sp) sauce as per other posters' suggestions.

VERY EASY!  I used enough BBQ sauce to COVER THE PORK CHOPS.  I used boneless, and they turned out great!  So tender, this is the way they should be.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours per the directions and had no problems.  Again, I did add extra BBQ sauce, so maybe that's the difference.

This recipe was wonderful! But I did 1 thing different, I rubbed the pork with some smoked paprika, garlic, pepper, and a wee bit of oregano. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce with a little bit of Bullseye. Was very good!

I use a variation on this recipe all the time, and I have a few tips. I would never bother to use my crock pot if I'm going to use it on high, I like to throw things in it for 8-10 hours and you never, ever get a dry result. I also wait until the last couple of hours to add a sauce, as the flavor is diluted by the cooking process. Any kind of sauce will work with this, including a cream of mushroom soup gravy. Experiment and you'll find a variation that you love. Make sure not to add too much water, or you end up with mush as well.

Super easy & tender!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's & boneless pork chops.  I put 1/2c. water in the bottom & 1/2c. water on top, as it's a thick bbq sauce.  Seven hours on low = perfection!

Very easy to make in the crock pot.  I also added some sliced onions and a cup of water. Made for some yummy sandwiches!  And I also had it over white rice.

We loved this.  It was easy and tasted good.  The meat was so tender.  I used JD BBQ sauce and added 10oz of Coca Cola for the last hour of cooking.

These came out pretty great, something was missing but not sure what. The hubby loved them and wants it added to the repeat list :) we both loved how tender they came out. :) we used JD BBQ sauce + garlic powder

I poked holes (using a fork) in the chops, seasoned w/some garlic powder, put a thin layer of sauce (like it says), put in a layer of chops (4 total), then covered with the remaining sauce. i found it wasn't enough to completely cover so i opened a second bottle and added that. then cooked on low all day. i wasn't sure when exactly they would be done since it didn't list a set number of hours for the low setting but we knew by the suddenly mouth watering smell, hubby checked and yup it was dinner time. perfect timing. :) 10am-6pm :)

This was exactly what it sounds like.  It was good but can be a bit dry even with the BBQ sauce. I would recc using a 'fatty' pork chop not a center cut, lean one.  In addition, use a BBQ sauce that you REALLY like because the cooking method only intensifies the flavor.

You have to use thick chops and good barbecue sauce.  You season the meat and do that and you can't go wrong with this.

My husband made this with scalloped potatoes....this tells you how easy this recipe is because he can't cook anything, LOL....Seriously though, if you like barbecue, you will like this.  He actually used two bottle of barbecue sauce instead of one, and cooked it on low for eight hours, so had no problem with burning...pork fell apart, and lots of sauce to dip the meat in!!! :)

Can't be any easier!  Adding water is NOT necessary.  I did not measure the barbecue sauce - just put a layer of sauce on the bottom, added the chops, put another layer on top of chops.  Cooked on low for about 8 hours.  OMG!  Great!  I definitely will make this again!

I just made this recipe today for dinner. I cooked 2 pork chops over high heat for 3 1/2 hours and the pork just crumbled into pieces, and was very dry.  I will never try this again!

The whole family liked these. My son said it was almost as good as dad's porkchops on the grill, which is a huge compliment! Used two bottles of sauce and no water, came out great after 3 hours on high.

I used thick cut pork loin chops!  and added on top some huge skinless chicken breast.  They were so good and I carried the leftovers in my lunch a couple days.  I used a low setting all day from 9am to 5pm.

I never would've thought about using a commercial bbq sauce until I saw this recipe and tried it out. Why waste all that time making your own sauce when you can just use a bottle of your favorite sauce? The porkchops just fell off the bone, and my dad said "my" sauce was better than my mom's! (I used Kraft's Chicken 'n Rib BBQ sauce;) I added some chopped onion & whole baby carrots to the pot and served it along with basmatti rice.. a real hit!

Don't judge my 5 star rating just yet.  I read what everyone else was doing with the recipe, saw they were adding water, so I added WINE (just a splash of a couple jigs or so) AND the onions, and have it ready to slow cook while Im at work tomorrow.  Got my fingers crossed.  OH, and I used country style pork rib fingers instead of chops.  How could you go wrong on this??????  I'll let you know how it turned out but I'm totally confident.

Originally, I was going to BBQ the pork chops until I found this recipe. So easy and the results were out of this world. I used President's Choice Maple, Apple and Beer Sauce, along with some onions under the chops and on top before pouring the sauce over. The meat was so tender it fell off the bone. Definitely 5 stars!

SIMPLY DELICIOUS!   This was so simple to make and delicious as can be!  I sprinkled the chops with garlic powder and covered with thin sliced onions as another reviewer suggested.  I absolutely loved the way it flavored the whole dish.  I served with sweet potato fries and brussel sprouts.   Thank you Kathryn for sharing such a SIMPLE DELICIOUS recipe!

Great recipe. If you like chewy this is not it because the meat falls off the bones. YUMMY! I use only 1/2 bottle of BBQ sauce on chops, throw on some sliced onions  and baste with my own sauce so they dont stick. My basting sauce is  Mixture of 1/2 BBQ sauce, 1/2  water, seasoning salt, onion/garlic powder, hot sauce. These chops make great sandwiches the next day as well. They heat well with a little basting sauce added for moisture.

Excellent taste and extremely easy preparation. Thanks! Added 1 cup Diet Rite Zero cola instead of 1-cup water (as suggested in other reviews), which gave another dimension of flavor with no extra calories or sodium. Also, I cooked for 11 hours after adding the pork chops frozen and cooked on "low" setting. Chops fell off the bone and were perfect. Will definitely make again soon!

Good. I used some BBQ, with about a cup of water, a splash of soy sauce, some garlic powder and salt / pepper on each. I added a bit of chili powder on each chop and dumped it all in. Cooked on high, about 10 boneless chops, for about 3 hours. Was a lot better after about 3.5, because the boys were so anxious to eat it. Added extra bbq sauce on the chops, as the sauce was a little thin. Still, delicious, and very easy. hah, what I like best. xD

This was Awesome. I went by the suggestions of putting water at the bottom, but I don't think it needed it. Marinated my chops with a little of this and that, and I used Cattleman's BBQ which had a wonderful flavor, and was a perfect sauce for my chops. I cannot wait to make these again. Thank you.

I put onion slices in the bottom of the crockpot and basted each side of the chop with home-made BBQ sauce.  A few onion slices on top and the remaining BBQ sauce. I only used a cup of sauce and the onions added the rest of the moisture as they cooked.  I cooked on low for 8 hours.  The chops were so tender and falling apart I needed a spoon to get them out.  Husband loved them.

I used "Bulls Eye" BBQ Sauce and they were so yummy!! But I think the key is to always sear your meat before you put it in the slow cooker.. no matter what it is, which this recipe doesn't say. but it holds in the taste and juices so much more!!

These were sooooo good!!  I put them in the slow cooker on about 225 degrees for nearly 8 hours, and they were absolutely the best ever!!  So tender and moist!! We dont really care for store-bought BBQ sauce so I made my own (Ketchup, mustard, worcestershire sauce, brown sugar) I also added parsley, basil, garlic powder and ground black pepper to the chops before adding the sauce!!  Also, one more note ... I put the chops in the crock-pot frozen!!  Very easy and very DELICIOUS!!!

This was fine tasting...but the note at the end that says you can leave it in all day...well dont believe it! It gets dry and hard when overcooked. 4 hours would be plenty long enough.

Our Pork Chops were SUPERB!! Everyone LOVED these! This is the most flavorful way to cook Pork Chops and we will never again bake or grill PC's. The key to attaining fabulously moist Pork Chops is to be generous with ones choice of sauce. I used about 70% of the bottle for 7 bone-in PC's in a 3 qt CP, top chop was dry. Chops must soak in sauce. Add onions if you love them! Mmmmmm.

This might be quite good if you have really thick chops on hand, but I wasted 8 lovely thin cut chops on this.  Shortened the cooking time to 2 hours on HIGH instead of the 3-4, and the pork still came out like shoe leather.  So disappointed.  Recipe authors should indicate the recommended thickness/size of the cuts.  Sorry to be critical - I wanted to love it!

These were really good! 
I cooked 4 pork chops in an 18 oz bottle of sauce (Head Country, try it!). There was barely enough. If you are cooking more than that, then I *highly* suggest using a bigger bottle. I cooked these on low for about 4 hours. I rotated them once or twice during that time as well as spooning the sauce from the bottom on top of the chops, just to make sure the stayed covered. I didn't want to chance them drying out. I also put about 1/2 of an onion on the bottom of the crock pot to give the pork chops something to sit on. I'm always afraid of scorching. 

I will be making these again. They were very tender, the bones even fell off when I took them out of the pot. 
Give this recipe a try, and make sure you have extra sauce just in case.

Simple. Delicious. Choose your sauce wisely. I have made this with Sweet Baby Ray, original and with Robert Rothschild Farm Anna Mae's Smoky Sweet Sauce.  Both were wonderful!
I used 5.5# pork loin, boneless cut at the butcher counter into 1/2" slices, then I halved those at home to feed more people. Both times have turned out tender and delicious. *tip: you can get the full pork loin cheaper than pre-cut/packaged, then have it cut for free at the counter.  Save at least .50/#

I used the thick, boneless pork chops from Costco and a really yummy hawaiian bbq sauce.

I thought the other reviews saying the meat was tender but dry sounded funny, because doesn't that sound contradicting?

But strangely, mine came out just like that! The meat was tender, easily shredded with a fork but dry. Hmmmm...

My hungry marine loved it, I made pull porked sandwiches and he went back for seconds and thirds.  I didn't care for it too much.

This recipe was very bland, very simple, it needed alot of perking up,  so I added water, onions, and barbeque before if put in the chops. put the pork in, then added garlic and the rest of the bbq sauce , but I only used 1/2 a bottle for the whole recipe. when chops are fully cooked, add steak seasoning, salt, pepper, and chives to the them, cook until blended in, nice served over rice, and use the leftover sauce for the pot as gravy on top of the dish. I woud give it a 5 syar after adding these ingredients.

These are the easiest & tastiest pork chops I have ever had. I did add little bit of water in the bottom of the crock pot & then put my pork chops in and covered them with seasoninings & bbq sauce. I used boneless chops, excellent meal!! Thanks!

This wasn't as good as it sounded.  My husband loved it but it was to greasy for me.  alot of the fat from the pork chops was just kinda floating on top of the sauce.Don't think I will try this one again.

This recipe was so simple and easy and only two ingredients.  I also like it because you can change it up by using any flavor BBQ sauce that you like.  My family loved it!

Made this over the weekend... super easy to make and great flavor! I added in some minced garlic and onions just for some extra seasoning. Will definitely be making again.

I have been making this recipe for a long time with one change --- I spread a thin layer of vegetable oil (I use EVOO) on the bottom dice up a large or extra large sweet onion and put it in first and use the barbq sauce sparingly then everything else is the same. I've always cooked it all day on low because in the past I've had some disasters with crockpots on high. I've made it with good pork chops as well as the cheap budget packs of pork chops and really have not noticed a substantial difference.

Easy and good. I used Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce. I also put grill seasoning on the chops before I put them in the crock pot. 4 hours on high and we had dinner!

This was so good.  I did not put in slow cooker. I very lightly browned chops in skillet and poured barbeque sauce over chops and simmered on low for almost 2 hours.  They were very tender and delicious.  I used Sweet Baby Ray barbeque sauce.  Will be adding this recipe to my regular rotation. Thanks

this is AMAZING. we've had this a few times now and the few changes i make still make it great. i cover the top of the pork chops with just enough bbq sauce so they are fully covered, add 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup italian dressing, 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, 4 cloves garlic and 1/2 large white onion. i cook for 2.5 hours alternating between high and low and they turn out perfect!! served with brown rice and asparagus..mhhmmmm! enjoy!!

I couldn't believe how incredible these pork chops turned out!!!

I had begun only 4 chops for my family and around 5 pm my husband called and asked if we could have guests---so I got out my salad master pot and did the same inside it as the slow cooker with two more chops--put it on low and varied it from medium to low---it was really good, too---they were good that way ---but they were incredible in the slow cooker!!

This was awesome. I used sweet baby rays BBQ sauce as others suggested, I added a bag of frozen chopped onions, and I used a little more meat so I cooked it on high for about an hour longer and used 2 bottles of sauce and added about a cup of water to the sauce cuz sauce was thick.  It was delicious, had a ton of leftover sauce when I was done that I poured back in the bottles it had chunks of meat in it too which was used up in the next 2 or 3 days because I have BBQ sauce living teenagers that puts that sauce on everything! Meat was so tender it fell right off the bone on the pork chops that were bone in.  The few that wasn't was also so easy to cut you could have done it with a butter knife! We used the leftovers to make BBQ sandwiches by shredding the pork. Yum! Two meals for a family of 4 easily!!! I used 10 pork chops of medium thickness to thick 8 was bone in and 2 were center cut.

Followed the recipe exactly and the porkchops came out dry and not very tasty. Will only make this again if I vary the recipe and play with the ingredients for a while.....but that more than likely wont happen.

Easy to make, I am positive that the flavor will be all about the BBQ sauce you use.  That will make or break how they turn out.

This was fair. I know it depends alot of your sauce however I dont think the most flavorful sauce would make this excellent. I might make again bec of how easy it is but add onions, garlic and maybe peppers.

Delicious and easy.  I made this for the kids and using Bobs BBQ Sauce recipe. This was my first slowcooked meal. I cooked for 4 hours on high and thought the chops were too dry and that I had overcooked.   However, after leaving on low for another 2 hours, they became extremely tender.

3 stars.  This is AWESOME as BBQ for sandwiches, but lousy for chops.  They were WAY too tender and fell off of the bone making it bbq.  So for taste I say 5 stars but for holding up not so much.

These were good, but I gave them a "4" rating because they are really no different then when I make them in the oven. I used boneless pork chops and added some minced garlic and chopped onion. Cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours, probably were done in 2 though.

Very good!! The only change I made was to toss in the beans and spices along with the chicken broth to simmer together rather than waiting. I served this with the "Slow Cooked Pork Barbeque" a perfect match.

After reading the reviews I was worried that this wouldn't come out right, but I still wanted to try it out since I had never cooked pork chops this way before.  I didn't want the BBQ to burn so in a bowl I mixed the BBQ sauce with some water and threw in some seasonings. I also seasoned the chops with garlic, seasoning salt, a grind og fresh crushed red peppers.    Put the  layer of bbq sauce, then chops, then a couple slices of onion,  topped with bbg and layered again until everything was used up.  Cooked on HI for 2 hours, and then  added carrots and cooked for another 2 hours. It was Just ok, I think I could have acheived the same flavor baking it or even putting it in a skillet. Won't waste my time making it again.

This is a very simple and quick recipe. I am always experimenting on things that my husband will eat since he is such a picky eater. He had four pork chops for himself. I used very thin chops (1/4 inch) and they turned out fine. I did not add water like others recommended and I did not experience any problems with the BBQ sauce wanting to burn on the bottom of the crock pot. Thank you for this very simple but tasty recipe.

This was so easy and delicious!  The meat just fell off the bone!  I think I will experiment with different sauces next time for more flavor.  I'd also like to note that I had no problems with burning so I don't think the water is necessary.

This was a very good recipe for moist and flavorful pork chops. After reading other reviews, I added water and onions, and I agree that picking an excellent sauce makes all the difference in the world. I used a homemade spicy sauce then served it with the succulent pork chops over rice with peas.

This recipe was sooo easy and delicious. I left pork chops on high for 3 hours and 1 hour on "keep warm" which over cooked. I recommend leaving for 3 hours on high and then serve or take out. Practice makes perfect! I also added half a cup of water on bottom and I added some seasoning. I will definetly be using this recipe again!

We enjoyed these low maintanence pork chops! It is great to have a recipe this easy and so good. We used a honey roasted garlic bbq sauce this time. It was okay, but I think a BBQ sauce without honey would probably taste better with the pork. The chops were moist & tender. They needed a little bit more of a zing to them, so we ate them with the small amount of BBQ sauce I left in the bottle. We only cooked 3 boneless chops and used a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature. They might have over-cooked a bit. After slow cooking for 3 hours they were under-temperature; 15 minutes later, they were way over the "done" temperature. The timing was a fairly delicate matter. But they still turned out very tasty.

These porkkchops were the most tender ones I have ever had.  I added just a little spice of garlic, salt and pepper and it was a hit.

My husband usually doesn't like pork chops at all, but he loved these. It couldn't have been easier & the meat was very tender. I think next time I will decease the cooking time just a little. The BBQ sauce started to burn a little.

I used this idea to cook chicken breasts with my favorite BBQ sauce, and I cooked them all day on Low.  When I got home the house smelled terrible (still does), and the meat tasted burned.  I think the BBQ sauce scorched after cooking for so long.  Should definitely either cook for a shorter time at higher temp, or wait til near the end to put in the sauce!

I tweaked this recipe to give it a taste of Jamaica and Japan.  I made 1 pork chop bone in just over 1lb and I cooked it on low for about 4 hours. It had an nice gravy.  
Season the chop with granulated onion and garlic powder, black pepper.  
Rub a pinch of oil on the chop.  Place it in the slow cooker. 
Mix  2 tsps of Walkers Wood Jerk Sauce with 2TBS low sodium Tamari (or soy) sauce and 2 tsp  mirin,  and juice of half a small lime.   
Add 1 thumb size of ginger smashed. Stir well.  
Slice half small onion and one stalk of green onion.  
Pour the sauce mix on top of the chop and flip it once to coat both sides. Add the onion and scallion/green onion.  

Serve with steaming hot rice.

I agree with the poster who said she never does anything high in a slow cooker--it kinda defeats the purpose to me.  I'm guessing that most of the people who posted about this being dry probably cooked on high. The key to any good pork is cook it low and for a good amount of time.  You can't rush it!  You don't need the water either.  If you feel like you need to add liquid, you can cover it in beer or root beer, let it cook and then cover it with your sauce--I do that with a full pork roast for  pulled pork sandwiches.  But, for this recipe, just do what it says and cook on low and you'll finish with tender chops that are delicious.  Sweet Baby Ray's is definitely the way to go, in my opinion.

This was a really good recipe!! My 4 year old and I really liked it. I made it with center-cut boneless pork chops and was very generous with Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ sauce. I cooked this on low for 6 hours. It did not burn, and the chops were very tender. I served it with broccoli, potatoes and cheese. It's definitely a recipe I will make again!

Excellent recipe and very easy.  I added 1/2 cup of italian dressing, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 2 tbsp. of worcestershire sauce like suggested by another review and it really came out good!  It is now one of my husband's favorite recipes I can make.  Definetely worth a try!

This was a great recipe but mine came out more for a party appetizer rather than a meal. I was going to a party that night anyway so I took it and people said how delicious it was with crackers. It was just too heavy for a meal for my family, but certainly a great appetizer! Changes that I made that might have effected the results are: I added 1/4 cup of italian dressing and 2 tsp brown sugar, and only had 6 pork chops.

This would have been really good if the chops weren't so overcooked.  I put them on low for 7 hours and came home to find them black!  Luckily, they weren't so burnt on the inside, and my husband still managed to scarf them down.  Can't wait to try this one again, but cook them for much less time.

I cooked boneless pork chops on low for about 8 hours.  I should have read the reviews for this recipe and I would have used bone-inc hops, more water, and a lot less time.  Mine turned out like burnt pork bricks!  Blah!

This recipe was great, but don't cook it as long as it says!  I tossed in a chopped onion, which didn't make a bit of difference, so don't bother.  I cooked it on low for 7 hours, and the pork chops were VERY dry!  Only cook for a few hours, even on low!  They were tasty other than the dryness, and very easy to prepare!

It really doesn't get any easier than this. Smelled good too, my husband kept asking when it was time to eat. The family liked these but I thought it was missing just a little something- maybe next time I will try a spicier sauce like someone else mentioned.

My family LOVED these chops.  I added the onion and a little water and cooked them on High for 3 hours.  My 5 yr old and 3 yr old each ate a whole chop each!  Will make this for many years to come.

What could be easier? This is great for busy Mom's! I think that the cooking time might be a little long, mine turned out a bit overcooked and falling apart. (not necessarily a bad thing) I love to serve corn, slaw and baked beans with this.

very good and easy.  I added just a little bit of water to the bottom of the dish to keep from burning.  I cooked on low for about 6 hours and they were so tender and yummy.

I love this recipe.  It came out great.  The pork chops where tasty and tender.  I thought at first this repice is to simple but the is the beauty of it.  I have a family of 5 and newborn so, not much time.  Only use a good BBQ sauce.

This was easy, quick & oh so delicious!  I followed the recipe but added purple onion and NO WATER!  I used an entire bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and a large onion.  I cooked it in my crockpot on low all day.  It was nice coming home to the main dish DONE!  This is definitely a KEEPER!!! ??

It was tasty with a mild candied coating but the sauce candied to the bottom of the slow cooker.  Next time I will melt 2 Tsp of butter in the cooker before adding sauce.

Who would have thought a simple recipe like this would be so good!  I put in about 1/2 cup beef broth on the bottom just so the crock pot wouldn't dry out. I "doctored" up my BBQ sauce added that, then I added some garlic and sliced onions on top of the pork. It cooked 3 hours on high.  Fantastic!  My hubby loved it too and is looking forward to the next time I make it.

Great simple recipe. I add sliced onions, because I love bbq onions!! 
Used some chops, a roast, it all came out delicious! Plenty of leftovers for the week! Thanks for posting a great recipe!

Made this for dinner this evening. Turned out great! I cooked them on low for 4 hrs and that was plenty long. They didn't dry out like they have in the past!!! I also cut up a medium onion and tossed them on top while cooking :) Great, easy recipe!!!

I made this last night,but ofcourse put my own spin on it,lol.I used boneless pork chops first of all.I also put water in it to keep it from burning as easy .I then added onion,along with seasonings that I like,and a tad of musterd.After reading the other reviews I browned my chops before putting them in.They came out tender and tasty with the help of the seasoning.I do feel they could have cooked less than four hours,but I only had four chops.Good meal!

I used boneless pork chops, coated them in flour, browned them in olive oil and sprinkled garlic powder and pepper on them.  I added 1/2 c of water to the bottom of the crock pot then placed my pork chops inside.  I drizzled olive oil vinegairette dressing over them along with bbq sauce, then added a layer of purple onion.  I added more dressing and bbq sauce then cooked them on high for 4 hours.  They did come out slightly dry.  Next time I will cook them on high for 2.5  hrs as suggested earlier and finish cooking them on low for another 2.5 hrs.

The chop right out of the pot was very tender, but a little dry.  Spooning some of the cooking juices over it helped.  Some more BBQ sauce would have helped too but I used it all in prep.  I have two chops left that I am going to use the meat in a rice dish.

This was edible, probably because the BBQ sauce was good, but it was rather bland. I added onions as well, and it still just was not very good. Also, the meat was pretty dry and I added in way more sauce than suggested with less chops.

This turned out amazing.  i also added salt, pepper, garlic powder and dried minced onions to each side of each chop. cooked for 2 hours high and 3 hours on low.  i did add a little water, probably less 1/4 cup. I saved the left over sauce and put it over leftover meat loaf which my husband raved about.  Great dish, that i plan to make again!

First time using a slow cooker and these turned out really good. boyfriend said they weren't as juicy as he was hoping for, but reheating the leftovers the next day he said were better. Think I'll try on low for more time instead of high and less time.

These were great and most of the family enjoyed them. It did use more BBQ sauce then I expected (even though I read the amount in the recipe) but turned out very well. I used fast frying pork without the bones and they were quite soft and good. Will definately make again.

I just thought this sounded way too easy but this turns out so good. I bought a cheaper cut of port chops than what I normally do and these turned out delicious and the meat fell off the bone. My company was impressed.

I seasoned pork with Season Salt and quickly browned them before adding to crock pot and placed onion slices on top of chops. I meant to add brown sugar to b'bque sauce but forgot so sprinkled some on top. Cooked on low 4 hours.  A little over done but was still yummy!

This was very good.  The only down fall is that cleaning my slow cooker after was difficult.  The barbecue sauce was like glue on the sides.  I wouldn't make this that often but all in all not bad.

for the most part i liked the pork chops but they were alittle to salty. but it might have been the type of bbq sauce i used. but the meat fell right off the bone. i did add water and quarter of an onion. i will try this again but maybe i will stick to regular bbq sauce

This was easy and tasted good.  Not earth-moving or anything, but a dish we'll make again.  I used KC Masterpiece Original and added about 1/3 cup water and 1/2 cup finely chopped onion.

Good basic recepie. I sprinkled the chops with garlic  and onion powder first before cooking. I added about 1/2 cup of beer in the bottom of the slow cooker along with barbecue sauce on the bottom. Layering the chops adding more BBQ sauce as I went. Finally pour the rest of the bottle before  adding the lid. I cooked on low for about 6 1/2  hours. Might be more so check as you try this. Served with French fries and a green salad you will have a deliciousl meal.

A very simple recipe ! I added half cup of white onion and a bottle of gluten free, no high fructose BBQ sauce. The result was a well received meal.

Pork chops are always hit or miss with my husband but these were definitely a hit. I changed the recipe a bit, but did not add water like most had suggested. I coated the bottom of my slow cooker with a little EVOO and seasoned the pork chops with kosher salt, pepper, smoked paprika and garlic powder. I thinly sliced some yellow onion and put them at the bottom of the slow cooker, and around the meat. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and added some garlic salt and about 1-2 TBSP of mesquite liquid smoke. I cooked them 2 hours on low and then 2 hours on high. I kept checking on the meat to make sure it was not too dry but that it fell apart easily. They came out very good. I paired it with some baked mac & cheese. Easy weeknight meal that I will definitely make again.

The pork chops were delicious!  They were very tender and flavorful.  This recipe is budget-friendly and easy to make.  I suggest lightly spraying your crockpot/slow cooker with non-stick cooking spray and adding a large onion, cut up, to your other ingredients.  Layer your onion slices along with each pork chop and barbecue sauce.  This recipe is a keeper!

Made these tonight for dinner.  They were delicious. I used 12 chops instead of 8 & cooked on high for 4 hours. They were good except I feel the cooking time would be best at 3 hours because they were a little over cooked but I will definitely make them again with adjusted cooking time. I also used a liner in the pot for super easy cleanup.

You can try a couple of variations:
- add a can of condensed mushroom soup 
or
-a can of condensed tomato soup
Either of these will produce a great gravy that will go well with a side dish of mashed potatoes or white rice.

Made this for my husband and brothers and it was gone same day. I added two flavors of bbq sauce (brown sugar and sweet n spicy) and added some seasonings (cumin, paprika, oregano, salt and pepper). It came out great and my picky brother even had two servings. definitely recommend this recipe. Put in slow cooker on low for 8 hours (we were gone all day) and it cooked all the way through and had no issues.

For those using a less fatty pork chop... try sprinkling with your fave seasoning. . Then quick sear in a lil olive oil just to form a slight crust. This jeeps juices in and makes for a perfect fork tender chop.

Made this last night. Came out really really good. Like all the other reviews mentioned, the meat did just fall off the bone. To the point where i pulled it out in pieces rather than a whole park chop LOL. Will definitely do it again, next time I will probably season the meat a little before putting it in and cook it in 3 hours rather than 4 so i can serve it a little more whole this time. Excellent dish. Thanks for sharing.

This was good.  I layered 3 double cut PC's with BBQ sauce and onions.  No additional water needed.  4hrs on low temp did the trick.  Leftovers the next day were even better.

I just thought it was alright.  Tasted like meat with bbq sauce...  The pork chops were a little dry in spots...  I might do this again if I'm in the pinch for a crock pot recipe that doesn't take a lot of time to prepare...  I'll definitely give it that; it was EASY.

I burn everything I cook - but that's pretty hard to do in a crock pot!  My family absolutely loved these and they were sooo easy to make!

I tried this with about a one pound hunk of pork tenderloin. The edges got pretty dry and so much of the bbq sauce got burnt, the burnt flavor went through the whole dish. The pork was great after I shredded it and got rid of the dry pieces and I put some new sauce on it to get rid of the burnt taste.  I can't imagine how dry a porkchop would get.

It was a very simple recipe. For the sauce, I used Irene's barbeque sauce. Pretty tasty. Loved how tender they were.

This was soooo yummy!  My husband is one of the pickiest eaters I know of and absolutely loved them.  He immediately called his dad and told him about them.  They were very tender and flavorful.  My husband and I both prefer these over grilling them!  YUM!

Awesome! I added 1/2 jar of water to the sauce to prevent burning while it cooked all afternoon and served it over rice, adding the extra sauce as gravy, and with fresh green beans. Wonderful and easy!

I added onion to the bottom of the pot, and used Korean BBQ sauce (which was a mistake because it made it too spicy for my kids) but I loved it. Pork chops were so tender, they just fell apart while I was trying to serve them.

This was a great, simple slow cooker recipe. I will try another BBQ sauce instead of what I had on hands. I will also try putting a layer of onions between the chops as another review suggested.

I used two-inch chops. Four would only fit my slow cooker. After four hours on high, they came out perfect! They were fork tender-did not have to use a knife.

If you can afford a thicker chop-get it! You may not find a really thick pork chop in the meat case, you'll have to ask the butcher to cut them for you custom like I did.

I will try an inch and a half pork chop next time, but I'm not going any thinner than that. If you put a thin pork chop in a slow cooker, two things are going to happen. They are going to turn to mush or be very tough.

One more thing-DO NOT add water. I read that some people had sticking issues with their crock pots. I was a little unsure myself, so I added a little more BBQ sauce and made sure there was enough on the bottom of my slow cooker before I stacked my chops.

I will definitely do this again. A crazy easy recipe that worked for me.

This is my 2nd time making these. I used Bulls Eye BBQ sauce and topped each pork chop with onions. Since they weren't frozen, I cooked them on low heat for about 2 and 1/2 hours and they turned out perfect! Also I added 1/4 cup of water to bottom of slow cooker before placing pork chops in so they wouldn't burn or stick at all.

The pork was hard.  I chose a serving of 2, but the cook time didn't change. Also, because I'm an idiot. If you choose less than the stated portions, make sure you adjust the cook time accordingly.

I had tweeked the basic recipe with recommendations from other input.  I added 1/4 cup water and onion salt.  Sauce was too thin and I did not add enough salt.  For a first attempt it was o.k.  I will continue to make with changes to get it perfect

These pork chops burned to a crisp on my low setting slow cooker.  I checked on the dish after 6 hours and the chops looked, and smelled like charcoal and the sauce was permanently adhered to the pot.  We had to throw them out.
Be careful if you use a brown sugar based barbeque sauce!

Good idea; but I feel it called for too much barbecue sauce...and was way too much of a good thing-- in my opinion.  I added sliced onions which were good.  So it was good, but overkill on barbecue sauce, which took away from the pork chop's appeal overall. 

The recipe made me get out my slow cooker, though and that was a good idea.  I also liked the mashed potatoes with it; that was a very good idea.

I cooked them on low with Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet n' Spicy sauce, which gave the pork chops a nice flavor.  I added onions and worcestershire sauce, but no water.  The meat was very tender.   I would definitely use this recipe again.   I think the leftovers were even more flavorful the next day.  Very easy!  Very tasty!

I made this recipe using a few little changes or additions. I used M Hughes Sugarfree BBQ Sauce and in between each layer of chops I sliced onions. Amazing flavor and ohhhh so tender! I loved this simple easy recipe! Thanks!

I bought a brand new slow cooker. This was the first recipe I tried with it. Ideal according to the recipe but I put about one fourth cup of water in it before cooking it. After about 3 hours in the cooking it in the Crock-Pot it start producing a lot of  liquid. When I got through cooking it it had about a quarter's worth of liquid still in it but it was done all the way and it was moist and tender in and I picked up one piece and it was falling off the bone so it's a good recipe but I don't like all that water you know but it tasted good you know.
So I don't think you really need to put water in it even though people was saying on in other reviews that you need to to put some water in it so it wouldn't burn. I let it cook the pork chops in the Crock-Pot for 4 hours and it was still had liquid in it but it still tasted good This is the first time I ever cook with a crock pot and I was surprised that you can really cook meat in a crock pot and get it done all the way like that.

I used boneless loin chops.  Big Mistake!  Chops come out dry.  Also I used up a whole bottle of Rufus Tiegue sauce.  Next time I will use the BBQ Ribs recipe and sirloin chops with bones..  And add the BBQ sauce to the ribs in the oven for 15 minutes.

I followed as directed but added water to the bottom and also mixed in a 1/2 cup of brown sugar + about 1 cup of apple cider vinegar. Super yummy

These came out well. I'm sure I'll make them again. No need to add water as some reviews state--it's not needed. I sprayed my crock pot with cooking oil and then layered the pork chops with some chopped onion and homemade bbq sauce. I didn't have any problems with burning. These cooked for 4 hours and were just a bit dry--I will take out at 3-3 1/2 hr next time.

I did some big, fatty country style pork ribs this way.  I can't leave well enough alone, so added an onion chopped, half a cup of soy sauce and garlic.  I would check this after 5 or 6 hours.  Drain sauce from crock pot and reduce in a pan on the stove.  Adjust seasoning.  Really good.  You could do pork ribs this way and then char on the grill.

This recipe was so very easy & was not only delicious but very tender and moist. It was so good, in fact, I made it two days later with cut-up chicken. And that was so tender, it pulled apart with with a fork.

I had to cook it for 10 hours and it dried out a bit, it probably would have been better at 4 hours. But still good, tasted like good pulled pork BBQ.

Really depends on the sauce you use. Needs the other ingredients to breakup the overwhelming bbq sauce. Added water just enough to sit the chops on. Next time will use less bbq sauce and another ingredients. May take a few times to perfect. Also didn't need that much ch time to cook but my crockpot is really big and cooks quite hot

Loved it, just like another reviewer I chopped up one onion and layered it in between the chops and BBQ sauce. In 1 hour on high (since the chops I used were thin) they were done. I put the chops on brown rice and had a veg medley on the side. 

It was tasty, may end up putting chunks of pineapple in it next time to see how it dose. Its a good base to work off of. =D

I changed the servings to make it enough for just my SO and I by cutting it down to just 3 chops. I first marinated the pork chops overnight in a marinade that consisted of olive oil, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, steakhouse pepper, Lawry's seasoning salt, fresh minced garlic and 1/3 cup of Strongbow hard cider. The next day when I was ready to cook my chops I first pan-seared them on all sides (for about 3-4 minutes on each side) in some olive oil, and for the last 3 minutes I added in some unsalted butter for the last bit of browning. I then added in a thin layer of water to the bottom of my crockpot before adding in my chops. I covered the chops with my favorite BBQ sauce (Stubb's Sweet Heat) and then added in some slices of onion on top. The last thing I did was smash a clove of garlic and toss it in before covering and setting on low and cooking for 8 hours.

Easy and good. I mixed some water with the barbecue sauce and a layer of sliced onions in the top. Before serving I put some parsley on top. Everyone liked it.

My wife saw the picture with the onions on topso we decided to try them.  We caramelized one red and one yellow onion and put them on top of the meat about 1 hour before they were done (8 hours on low).  We used thick cut pork chops and the result was no knife needed - incredibly tender and tasty!  SUPER!  Next time we will probably do two bottles of BBQ sauce for more sauce after cooking.  Tender and tasty is a great description.

I followed the directions and added a sliced onion. I used good rib chops with some fat that were pretty thick. It did fall off the ribs when I removed from slow cooker but I was disappointed in the tenderness. The meat was stringy--kind of like a roast. I think if I do it again I'll use a pork roast.
