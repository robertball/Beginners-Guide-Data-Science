My DH's aunt makes this same recipe and I absolutely love it! She was nice enough to share her recipe with me last summer when I was having a party and my guests couldn't get enough of it this dip. I served it with sliced baguette. It really is awesome... and everyone was asking me for the recipe afterwards. This dip (or spread) can be made ahead and then heated in an oven proof dish for about 25-30 minutes before serving.

Just a tip you might want to try...

I bought some sourdough bread, cut a hole in the top, and kept this dip warm in the oven.  Also, before I added the dip to the bread bowl, I threw in some shredded cheddar/mozza, mixed it through, and also sprinkled some on top to melt while it was in the oven.  Served with sliced baguette - YUMMY
My guests had RAVE reviews, this is a terrific recipe.

I've made this three times for parties.  I always get asked for the recipe.  The last timde I didn't have any bacon so I used three tablespoons of butter instead (can't gowrong with butter). 

I did find that the tastes really blend together if I make it ahead of time and refrigerate for a few hours then warm back up.  I used french bread and also white corn tortilla chips.  Both went well with the dip.

This was wonderful. I used 5 strips of bacon and used alot more mushrooms.  I used more like 20 oz pack from Costco.  It is not the prettiest looking, but it was great on bread.  I think with only 8 oz of mushrooms, the cream cheese and sour cream overpowered.  Use more mushrooms.

Rich and delicious.  I served this at an all womens gathering and they loved it.  I had to make a couple of changes.  First I chopped the mushrooms instead of slicing and after I added all the ingredients I had to deglaze the pan with about 1/3 cup of white wine.  I then placed it in an 8X8 pan and added some dried parsley to garnish and re-heated in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes.

Excellent dip!  I left out the salsa and mushrooms (don't care much for either).  Probably due to the absence of salsa, it was thicker than I expected for a cheese dip.  But it tasted GREAT!  We only had chips, but I would like to try with bread or bagel chips.  Thanks for a great party recipe.

This dip didn't have very much flavor.  It was very bland.  If you added more garlic and bacon it may be better.  The consistency was good, but like I said...no flavor.  I wouldn't make this again.

Very good, but very rich.  Probably  should have used half the cream cheese and twice the sour cream and it would have suited our tastes better.  I served it with crusty bread slices and soup for lunch.

This is the first time I made this dip. I will omit the flour next time as I found it too thick. I substituted yogurt for the sour cream and used Greek yogurt cream cheese. I found there was not much liquid in the sautéed mushrooms. All in all a delicious hot dip.

This was easy to make and a really good appetizer for a cold day.  Put it in a little dip warmer and it seemed to get better with time. I think next time I may add a little Chipotle Red Devil for a little zing.

Our taste testers rated this as a 4 star Dip. We used 8 strips of bacon since we could. Turns out, folks like bacon enough to try this dip even thought they aren't keen on Mushrooms. It was tasy warm and cold.

I made this recipe for a Christmas Party and it turned out so good! I added cheddar cheese and baked it in a sourdough bread round. It was delicious. I have had a similar hot mushroom dip made with mayo, and this one is much better!
