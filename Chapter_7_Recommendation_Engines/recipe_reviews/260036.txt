This dish was delicious and a nice change up from making Mexican Rice. The only real change I made was instead of bouillon, I used unsalted chicken stock as that's what I had on hand. If you do this, you might want to add a little salt as bouillon usually contains sodium, but I forgot and the recipe still came out great following the directions as written! Also, the recipe doesn't specify what kind of rice to use, but I went with medium grain.  We really enjoyed this recipe and look forward to making it again. Thanks for the recipe!
