I must preface this by saying that oatmeal cookies definitely aren't my favorite, I'm more of a chocolate chip fan.  I have to say, though, that I think that this is my all-time favorite cookie.  These are just incredible - soft, chewy, sweet, with bursts of cinnamony goodness.  Yummmmm.....

These are THE BEST COOKIES!!!! I am not a large "sweets" fan so I am always on the lookout for a cookie that doesn't require chocolate chips and one that I can call my own.  THESE ARE IT!! SOOOO GOOD!! I had to hold back from eating the dough.  I didn't change a thing and highly recommend. Thank you Hershey's for posting this wonderful recipe!!!!  I will these make over and over AND OVER again!!!

Fabulous recipe - this was the first time I made them and I know they could have been better but only because of my errors - in mixing it seemed a bit dry and didn't want to stick together, so I added a little bit more beaten egg.. then when baking, the first dozen came out looking beautiful but a little too doughy when I bit into one (but still absolutely yummy).. then I think I overcompensated by baking the rest a little bit too long.. Even so these were my contribution to the Super Bowl snacks, and everyone, kids and grown ups, loved them.  I will make these again and do it right the next time!

I sliced the apples on a grater.  Had to cook for 15 minutes. This was such a great recipe---I always enjoy finding good cookie recipes that are different---had to go to three stores before I found the cinnamon chips....was well worth the effort.  My sons were a bit leary of trying them. They asked, "What's in it?"  I said, "Just EAT it." Result? I'm off to Shop Rite to buy more cinnamon chips. hmm-hmm-good!

Oh my GOODNESS these are FANTASTIC!!!!  My honey is deployed in the US Navy, I send cookies to him every week.  He shares them with his crew, these were a hit with ALL the guys, he said they didn't last an hour!!! I used an extra half cup or so of apples, the chunks made a great cookie even better!!  I'll definately be making these again!!!

Voted "both hands up" in my son's second grade class!!  Easy to make and disappeared quickly.  I used a teaspoon baller/scoop and baked them on parchment paper using my stoneware.  Will make again and again for the family.

Awesome, awesome cookies!  I've made them twice now, once with chopped apples, and once with shredded ones.  I have to say that I like the shredded a bit more.  Some other additions I liked were the additon of toffee chips into the dough (mixed them in with the cinnamon ones), and caramel (which I made from this site).  First I tried to wrap a piece inside a cookie (BIG bust! lol).  but then I had success when I added a piece immediately after they came out of the oven, pushing it into the top of the cookie.  HUGE hit with everyone who tried them!  Thanks, Hershey Kitchens, for once again giving me a good excuse to cheat on my diet!

Oh my goodness!  Hershey needs to give whoever developed this recipe a big fat raise.  Made these in the cafe today and our customers loved them.  (Like a really, really tasty oatmeal cookie.)  Used granny smith apples and followed directions precisely except left skin on the apples.  Also, used the food processor for chopping the apples and it worked out fine.

This is a great soft apple cookie.  The blend of flavors are great.  I may add some chopped walnuts just because we like nuts, but the flavor is great the way it is.  If you use a "juicy" variety apple, you may need to use a little (2 or 3 TBSP.) more flour.  I found it helpful to leave the cookies on the cookie sheet for 2 to 3 mintues (recipe suggests 1 minute) to avoid cookies falling apart.  The cookie dough is very moist as the other reviews indicate, but it does produce a very tasty soft delicious cookie!

The dough was very wet and the first batch spread too much.  I added a 1/4 cup oats and 1/8 cup of white sugar.  I also added 1 TBS cinnamon powder for extra cinnamon taste.  However, overall it was a great, moist cookie.

These were really great. I bought the chips in the US and brought them home because I've been wanting to make these cookies. I took them to a gathering and everyone was asking for more. They were very moist, even several days later. I just wish I could buy cinnamon chips in NZ!

Our family thought these cookies were great!  We added "Hershey's Milk Chocolate Chips" instead of the raisins. This combination of cinnamon chips, milk chocolate chips and fresh apple made this cookie recipe a winner!

These were very yummy cookies.  My daughter had to bring something made with apples to her preschool and I made these cookies for her to share.  One other mommy commented a few days later that her son said that Abby's mommy brought cookies to school and they were better than the his mommy's cookies!   I grated the apples and personally think the amount of apples could be increased to get a more "apple-y" flavor, but all in all this is a delicious recipe and a nice change from regular oatmeal cookies.

I used cinnamon-spice instant oatmeal and about 2 cups of apples, and also apple cider (didn't have any apple juice).  The cookies are quite yummy.

[Edit - September 2010] I have now made these cookies many times, and my only real complaint with them has been that they're so fragile that you can't pick one up without it falling apart. So today, I tried two small modifications: I substituted shortening for half the butter, and I added an extra half-cup of flour. The cookies came out much less fragile this time, with no loss of flavor. I will be making them this way from now on.

I have made these cookies many times and each time they get rave reviews and are gone before everyone can get one!  They are very moist, so make sure the pan is only LIGHTLY greased and chill the dough for a few minutes before baking to prevent them from spreading too thin.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I didn't think they were much different than your ordinary Oatmeal Cookies though...BUT that could have been because I didn't have apple juice so I used cranberry juice in it's place.  I love baking with apples so I think next time I will also add another 1/4 of a cup of apples.  Also, I made these to give out at Christmas and my SIL's boyfriend couldn't get enough of them!!  My MIL even called and asked us for the recipe!

Loved it...I had to bake them longer than 10 minutes they looked done but still too "gooey" inside. Also I used coconut instead of raisins and chunky applesauce instead of apples. I increased the oats to 2 cups. They turned out great ...gone in a instant..this ones a keeper!

The cookies were very moist, I think because
of the apple. I divided the batter in half,
left one as wrote and added 1/2 cup of
Hershey's minature chocolate chips to the other.
Two different cookies from one batter! I think
I might try them without the apple next time
and see how it turns out. By the way the cinnamon
chips were great to eat on their own.

Loved this cookie!  Taste was great, but needed a little flash to take to church, so I made a glaze of apple juice & powdered sugar to drizzle on top and everyone raved over them.

These were decent. I should have chopped the apples finer (instead I used big cubes). I liked sampling the batter better than the final product...they just don't beat regular oatmeal cookies.

I was really disappointed in these cookies. I subbed apple juice concentrate for the apple juice and grated the apple to get more of the apple dispersed through the cookie, but there was essentially no apple flavor. They're a soft, very cakey cookie that is expected any time you use fruit in a cookie, but I was going to put up with the cakey texture to get the apple flavor...and then there was no apple flavor!! They will be eaten, but won't be made again.

These remained REALLY soft--as in way too soft. Probably b/c I subbed more apples for the raisins. silly me. Just not blown away by this, but use my review for a cautionary note of what NOT to do and perhaps it will be better for you.

These cookies are ABSOLUTELY DIVINE.  They are nothing short of heavenly.  They're delicious and easy to make, and I just love the cinnamon chips.  They're hard to find where I live (Canada), so every time I go to the States I pick up a few bags and bake off these cookies.  They always disappear fast.

We liked these cookies, they just weren't, "WOW!", good.  I like them with coffee.  I'm not sure if I would make these again for my family.

These cookies really are very good and original.  They're wonderfully moist, chewy, sweet, and cinnamon-y!  I really love these, one of my favorites!  The BEST way to use cinnamon chips!

The only thing I did differently was added a bit more apple (probably another 1/2 cup) and used pear juice instead of apple juice, because it's what I had on hand.  Some of the best cookies I've ever had!!!  Yum!!!

We did not add the raisins.

OH MY GOSH!!! The best cookie I have ever eaten.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was that I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  Some people said that they should shred the apples to give it more apple flavor. But I think that keeping them in chunks are best so when you bite into one you get a full apple flavor.

Very good cookie, very soft and chewy...makes exactly 4dz.  cooked 12 minutes and also let cool at least 2 minutes before moving to wire rack to cool.  NOt very appley think next time I will do 1 1/2-3/4 cups of "grated" not chopped apple.

Yummy!  I couldn't find cinnamon chips so I made my own by melting white chocolate chips and adding cinnamon to taste.  Turned out great although hard to keep together.  I will definately make these again but try to chop the apples a little smaller next time.

Very tasty, but tended to fall apart.  I loved them because they were so unique and friends gobbled them up.

Very yummy. My DH loved them and he does not like oatmeal! I thought they were a bit sweet, overall very good.

Big hit with both my husband and toddler!  Both had two before I could stop them!  We try a new cookie recipe almost every week, and this one is one of my new favorites.   I omitted the raisins for personal preference, and I took the advice of another reviewer to shred the apple with a grater instead of chopping.  It worked really well- instead of the occasional bite of apple, you could taste it in every bite. Can't wait to have one with a big mug of hot coffee!

These are awesome!  They are very chewy and moist.  Even more so the next day (if they last that long).  Next time I think I will try chopping my apple in smaller pieces so they will be more evenly distributed throughout the cookie.  Definitely will be making these again....very soon!

They were good, but I am not a big fan of oatmeal cookies.  If you are more of a chocolate chip lover, you might want to pass on these.

This is a 'GREAT' cooky!!  I baked three batches in one week....  Other than substituting chopped walnuts for the raisins, I followed the recipe.   These are very soft from the oven. I baked them on parchment paper and let them cool for a few minutes. Than I slid the paper off and let them cool for about 15 minutes.

Great, moist, flavorful cookie.  I didn't have any apple juice so used applesauce, and I added
a few shakes of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.
Also made half with walnuts and really prefer them that way.  Next time, I will chop the apples
finely, as the chunks of apples, raisins, walnuts, and chips are a lot for the dough to hold together.

This recipes was very easy. I tend to like lots of spice and bold flavor, so for me it was kind of bland. Next time I'll just add more to it...and there will certainly BE a next time. My husband took these to work and said they were gone in minutes!

These cookies were SO good! I couldn't find the cinnamon chips at my local grocery store, so I omitted them. I used Paulared apples in these cookies and apple juice concentrate. I will definetly make them again.
