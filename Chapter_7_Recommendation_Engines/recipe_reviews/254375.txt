These did not come out like pancakes. They were as thin or thinner than a crepes. So I took the remaining batter), added 1/2 tsp baking powder and poured them into greased ramekins.  I had enough batter for 2 ramekins and I baked them at 350 degrees for 18 minutes. They were a lot better than the pancake.

This is way too sweet for me, a 1/2 cup of sugar is all it needs. A decent recipe though.

these are great! I use only 1/2 cup of sugar as per other recommendations. they work great as a bun or bread pieces for pulled pork!

This is so goooood!!! I halved the recipe and substituted cows milk with plain almond milk, still delicious! It was thinner than I thought it should be but I was using a 6 in skillet so it worked out perfect!!

These were yummy, sweet corn bread pancakes. We served with chicken wings which seems like a strange choice, but was pretty good. Used just half of the recipe, but followed exactly...oh but halved the amount of sugar.
