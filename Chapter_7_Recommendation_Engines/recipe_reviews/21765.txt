I made this and my other half thought it was fantastic.   The only suggestion I might make is that if you cook this in the microwave too long the mushroom soup gets quite dry.   You may need to add a little water.   Other than that - great recipe.

This was a really great recipe.  Easy to follow directions and very good to eat. Glad to find another way to cook gizzards than just boiling them.  My children and I loved them, so did my Mom.

Excellent recipe and a great way to make gizzards a bit more falvourful. The only thing I did differently was to add a bit of minced garlic to the mixture. Well done!

This turned out really, really well!  I have made these twice now and the first time I had to add a little bit more water part way through cooking, but the second time (I doubled the batch) it didn't need the extra water.  My brother, who is very critical of everything, loved these and even took home leftovers!

I made this dish and made quite a few changes. I used both cream of chk. and mushroom garlic. I seasoned the gizzards before coating them w/ flour. For that I used Cajun seasoning. I also added chk. livers to the recipe. Additional seasonings I used in the recipe are garlic & onion powder, red pepper and parsley. I also sauteed some diced celery, onions, and bell pepper in bacon fat before adding the soup. I thinned mine with both milk and water and used more than the recipe called for. The last thing I did that was different was take the browned bits of flour after pan frying the gizzards and livers and making a gravy which I added to the soup mixture. I let it simmer for a very long time then served over rice. At some point it actually reminded me a bit of giblet gravy although I never added sage...

My husbands Polish Grandma used to make this for him all the time.....so I decided to give it a stab....and he loved it!!  I did add some fresh chopped mushrooms to the concoction, as well as some additional spice to the flour.  I also served atop rotini noodles....Thanks Barbara, for pleasing my DH!!
