Has a really intense chocolate/orange flavor.  I whipped up a pint of cram with a little sugar and added it to the fruit dip to lighten it up a little.  Goes great with fresh strawberries!

EVERYONE and I do mean everyone loved this when I tried it at a bridal shower for 39 women. I made it to take to a teacher's luncheon several days later with strawberries, melon, and pineapple, and it was gone before all the teachers could sample it. Lots of people pulled out their notebooks and took down the ingredients-(teachers always have paper and pen handy!!)and one person told me they had already made it and 4 people asked for the recipe.  Thanks to Ruthie for sharing such an easy and fabulous tasting summer recipe.

Recipe was a good fruit dip alternative to those with cream cheese AND marshmallow spread.  I used 1% milk instead of skim and a dash of orange juice rather than the orange liquer - it tasted fine.  All in all, a pretty good chocolate dip.
