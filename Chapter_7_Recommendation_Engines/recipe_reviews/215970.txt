I used jumbo shells instead of manicotti shells.  It was incredible and tasted better than it tastes at a restaurant!  Great recipe.

Made this for dinner tonight.  Very filling!  Cheese filling will fill approximately 12 manicotti shells for us Canadians that purchase it in a box of grams not ounces.  Only thing I would change is not adding the additional parmesan cheese on top at the last 10 minutes, unless you really like it extra cheesy, without it would be perfect.

This was awesome! My picky husband loved it! I did have a hard time finding ricotta cheese at the grocery store, because had I never cooked with it before. I found it by the sour cream and cottage cheese. :) I used a little garlic powder instead of the real thing and it was still great!

This is sooo good!  I scoop the cheese mixture into large shells instead.  They are much easier to scoop and the kids love it!

This makes A LOT!  I added a half cup of shredded zucchini (because I had some to use up) and a couple of chopped up sausages (for my meat loving husband).  It was pretty easy and good.

This was pretty yummy.  I docked it a star because it had way too much sauce.  Probably one jar would have been sufficient; maybe one and a half at most (not 6.5 cups!!)  Very cheesy, so you could cut back a little on the cheese topping and still have plenty of cheese.  Overall, good, though!

So, it definitely wasn't Three Cheese Manicotti after I added the ground Italian sausage, but it was still delicious! I also used homemade tomato basil sauce because I prefer it to the store bought.
