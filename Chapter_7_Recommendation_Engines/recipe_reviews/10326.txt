I'd never made anything quite like this, and I thought it turned out pretty nicely. I did find that the bars held together well. It wasn't a very picture-perfect presentation, but the taste was very good.
I made this recipe almost to spec, with a couple of minor notes: I used *seedless* red raspberry jam, and while making the recipe I thought that a jam with seeds might have been better, with more texture and mouthfeel (I like jam like that), but with the final result, it didn't really matter to me after all. Second, I used extra large eggs, so my batch was a little bit eggier than normal. Lastly, I used "fancy flake sweetened coconut", and I would've preferred to have had unsweetened shredded coconut on hand.
That said, this was a tasty dish, which took me a week to consume. I didn't think I'd like the raspberry/coconut combination that much, but it was better than I expected. One last thing: A previous reviewer thought there was "too little dough". I might agree that it would be better to have a little more dough in this recipe.

It was pretty good.  It only needs a quarter cup of butter in the bottom layer, I poured butter off of it when I took it out of the oven.  I also used apricot jam instead of raspberry

I was quite disappointed by this recipe. The dough should have less butter and more sugar or other flavoring. I agree with the other reviewers who said that the end result did not look very good, and that the cut bars did not retain their shape well.

This is an easy recipe to make, but I found it to be much more like a raspberry bread.  I would add a cup of sugar to the dough to make it sweeter.

i think this recipe calls for too little dough and too much fruit. i would add more flour and cut down on the butter in the dough. but the topping was perfect! the bars themselves still came out tasty... just messy and they could not hold together.

I decided to try this recipe during an ice storm, as I had all of the ingredients needed on hand.  This was easy and good.  I thought the presentation was nice; the bars retain their shape well.  It also made the house smell heavenly.  Remember to use an 8x8" pan; there is just the right amount of crust when you do that.  I needed to bake it for an additional five minutes to get the top all brown and bubbly.  This is perfect for tea time, as the crust is very scone-like because of the baking powder.  It loses a star for me because I enjoy a more lemon bar-like crust.  Serve with whipped cream and good black tea.

used fresh raspberries - I think I'll put some icing sugar in the crust mixture next time
