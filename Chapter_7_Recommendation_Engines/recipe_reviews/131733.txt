Wow! Made these shrimps for our annual 4th of July Beach Side BBQ. Wish you all could have been there to hear the rants and raves. Everyone there wanted to know how I prepared the shrimps. The shrimps were certainly the hit of the party trumping out all the other dishes. The wives (me being a male) all wanted the recipe. I only use Best Foods Mayonaise and for me the Best oyster Sauce is Lee Kum Kee brand. Thank you iluvpickles for a winner! I guess I will have to make this again next year. The only thing that topped it last evening were the fireworks! All the Best to you!

This is some of the best marinade I have ever tasted for shrimp. Instead of grilling, I baked in the marinade for about 15  min. at 350. We put the shrimp in a taco with avocado ranch dressing. Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe but I made a few modifications to make it a little more Hawiian.  Skip the 2 TBS of lemon pepper and instead add 1 TBS  of fresh cracked black pepper and the juice from one fresh lemon.  then take the 1 cup of mayo down to 1/2 cup and add 1 cup of pinapple juice and 1 TBS of fresh minced ginger.  If you want to spice it up, add a tsp of Tabasco. Use all the other ingredients per the original recipe.  Either way, these shrimp come out great!

For someone who doesn't like spicy food, this is a good recipe. My parents really enjoyed it on Mother's Day on the grill with some steak.

Absolutely loved these moist and flavorful shrimp!  The marinade was a snap to throw together.  I marinated overnight, and my hubby grilled them perfectly.  Only thing, a tad on the salty side.  MY fault, I looked at my lemon pepper bottle, first ingredient listed, SALT!  I'll make these again with a no salt added blend next time.  This will be perfect for summer entertaining, I will use this recipe many more times.  Thank you for sharing, iluvpickles. UPDATE 4.20.12:  Made this with Penzey's "Sunny Spain: seasoning, their no-salt lemon pepper blend, and added no salt, perfect!

I wasn't a big fan of this recipe.   I think that the lemon pepper really overwhelmed the rest of the flavors.

We got a new bbq and hubby wanted to grill some scrimp.  I went looking for a marinade.  I thought this sounded interesting so we gave it a try. Pleasantly surprised!  This was really good and we will make it again.

Sort of greasy.  I mostly tasted the mayo and sugar and I'm not a fan at all of mayo so it ruined the shrimp for me!  I thought some of the other flavors would come out.  Basically it was sweet greasy shrimp!  My husband and the neighbors liked it but I don't know if they were just saying it to be nice because I definitely couldn't eat more than one.
