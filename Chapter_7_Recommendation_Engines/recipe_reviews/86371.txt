This is a good recipe, but its flexibility makes it even better.  It was hard for me to keep from giving the recipe four stars, but the taste isn't quite to four star level.  The taste is a little better than average and because the recipe works and offers flexibility, it something I will consider making again.  Not wishing to run to the store, I substituted with what I had on hand:  1) ziti for rigatoni, 2) mayo for sour cream (this works great, I've done it many times, especially in casseroles, and 3) dried parmesan cheese for fresh.  I also added two small cans of mushrooms and a small amount of leftover frozen white corn.  With the extra dry ingredients, I also threw in a can of cream of chicken soup to cover the dry ingredients.  Because my casserole dish was larger than what was called for in the recipe, it accommodated the extra ingredients perfectly.  Bravo!

This recipe is a good base to add on to.  I used almost 24 ounces of pasta, two cans of condensed soup (one chicken and one mushroom), 1 cup of low-fat sour cream, and a variety of frozen mixed vegetables, and it was wonderful!  With the two soups and extra sour cream it was creamy and not dry at all.  I also used one large boiled chicken breast which I thought was just enough.  This is something I will make again and again.  Also very good as leftovers!

My picky family LOVES this recipe!  Because I never know what will be in my pantry at the time, I have tried this recipe with both fresh and canned chicken, frozen and canned peas, and extra soup OR extra sour cream.  It's always delicious!  Thanks so much for a recipe that's become a staple for this hard-to-please bunch!

I had to make these changes because of what I had on hand. I used a pint size jar of home canned chicken chunks for the chicken. I had no onion powder so I used some chopped frozen onions I had in the freezer. I also had no frozen peas so I used frozen mixed veggies. I don't think the changes I had to make would have made a huge difference in the taste.

I thought it was a little strong on the garlic and very dry. It needed more sauce. No one really liked it because it was dry. I'll try it again but add another can of mushroom soup and some more sour cream to it.

It was easy to make and on a busy day that was a plus!

Loved this! I used some cubed chicken that I had marinated in a mixture made from the liquid from a jar of marinaded artichokes & then sauteed, decreased the sour cream to half a cup, added 1/2 cup each of heavy cream & white wine, I added a rib of chopped celery, 3 chopped shallots & 3 cloves minced garlic (I gave them a quick saute to soften them first), I decreased the parmesan to about a cup & used about 10 oz. of egg noodles instead of rigatoni. I know right about now you're thinking, "Is there anything she didn't change in this recipe?" LOL Sorry! This was a wonderful use for leftover chicken...it's some good comfort food!

A good recipe to start with and modify to your liking. I used fresh peas and fresh carrots, which I pre-boiled. I also used 2 chicken breasts that I baked myself. Everything else I did the same. I found it to be very tasty, but a little too dry. Next time I'll double the soup/sour cream, and keep the spices the same.

This recipe was wonderful.  My husband and I both liked it.  The flavors were terrific.  The only thing I would change next time is I would only use a cup of parmasean cheese.  (I didn't use the canned chicken, I used fresh and it was great!)

Not a lot of flavor, but it was an easy recipe to make with ingredients I had on hand (used a chicken breast instead of canned chicken).

the taste was great!!  I cut back on the pepper because I don't like too much, and couldn't include the peas (none in the freezer), but aside from that I didn't change too much.  I can't wait to try it with the peas!!

I agree with most - this this is a good base recipe. I used too many peas and think it needed more seasoning. Definitely worth another try with a few adjustments. Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  I didn't have canned chicken so I cut up some frozen chicken and cooked it in oil with some garlic.  I was out of frozen peas so I used canned and I had shell pasta that I used in place of the rigatoni.  This is my new go to recipe when I need a quick recipe with simple ingredients.

It was pretty good, although not as flavorful as I hoped it would turn out.  I used bow tie pasta instead, so maybe that changed a little bit of the flavor, but i'm not sure if it did anything. I would make it again in a pinch, but not to impress anyone.

JUST OKAY BUT I USED A BOX OF STUFFING INSTEAD OF PASTA..MAYBE THAT MADE ALOT OF DIFFERENCE.

I made this casserole for my husband and I to take for lunches during the week.  It warms well with the cheese melting.  My husband doesn't even like peas but he loves this casserole.  I added a little more sour cream because it seemed too dry when I was mixing.  Other than that, its great!

Really easy to make and tastes great.  I have a habit of making dry casseroles but this one was moist and delicious.  I have 5 boys so I doubled the recipe with no problems at all.  Thanks.

This has a really good flavor and is a really great recipe.  I used 16 oz. spaghetti and it turned out dry.  I would reduce the amount of spaghetti or add milk to the mix.  I would definitely try this again, with the correct ingredients!

East to follow directions and very tasty.  Our entire family really enjoyed the recipe.  One suggestion would be to add more chicken and maybe some carrots.

Really good and simple recipe. I added another can of the chicken and I used a rotini pasta, that is what was in the cabinet, and it was great. Though after refrigerating and heating up the next day, it was dry. I would add another can of cream of mushroom and some more sour cream for left overs. It was yummy!

We make this recipe frequently in our house.  My husband loves it.  Its one of the few recipes that I make with no changes.  The parmesan can be overwhelming for some people, if you want a milder flavor I would use a different white cheese.  I've made this with both canned chicken and fresh shredded chicken and its good both ways.

Very easy to make and I like that the ingredients are for the most part non-perishable/frozen. But the flavor was lacking, so I'll be looking at ways to give it more oomph next time. Maybe a little paprika?

Sinple recipe and it turned out great. The only thing I changed was that I didn't have peas so I substituted green beans instead. I made it for our weekly community group dinner and got lots of compliments.

This recipe is only okay.  It has a lot of onion and garlic powder, so would recommend cutting back on that to make it a bit better.  Will make again with those changes.

Good recipe. It is indeed a very adaptable recipe. I left the recipe alone for the most part except that I substituted the pasta for an extra can of chicken, a cup of frozen broccoli/cauliflower and mixed some cheese into the sauce. Turned out very tasty, and is a quick and easy rush night dinner.

I also doubled the sauce, and i'm glad I did. For a quick weeknight meal, this is great. I did also throw in more peas because i want more veggies in my meals. Great add to the meal rotation!

Substituted fresh shredded chicken breast and added some breadcrumbs on top with the cheese but the end result was delicious!

I was looking for an easy recipe to use up some canned chicken I had in the pantry. I did make some changes to the original recipe. I did double the amount of chicken, used two cups of sour cream, only one cup of parmesan cheese for the topping and only one teaspoon each of both the onion powder and garlic powder. I also added one teaspoon of dried Herbs de Provence for additional flavoring. It was very good. Whenever I try a new recipe I always ask my husband if it's a repeat. He said yes. It was a hit with him.

Chicken & Pea Casserole  Haiku: "Too much Parmesan. Small swap - used penne pasta. Did the rest the same." This was alright - we were a table divided w/ the husband and the baby enjoying it, and me and the 8 yo not liking it. I didn't change anything other than using penne instead of rigatoni, which doesn't really alter the integrity of the recipe at all. I liked the ease of not having to cook anything at all (other than the pasta) as we enjoy using Costco's canned chicken in plenty of casserole recipes. Perhaps reducing the Parm, and adding some sauteed onions or garlic instead of the powders would improve this for me.

This is the first thing I have ever made on here that I couldn't eat. My family ate it, so I guess there's that.

I changed it up. I sauteed chicken breast and onions. Used fresh garlic and egg noodles. Turned out fantastic!

I made this tonight, followed recipe exactly except I added a small jar of pimentos (for a bit of color) and some milk so it wouldn't be so dry.  It was good, but for my taste buds a bit bland.  Next time I will use the cream of mushroom soup with garlic and perhaps mix some parmesan cheese in with the casserole to add to the flavor.  Overall, an excellent, quick and good recipe that we can adapt to our individual taste.

This was just so, so. This is not a 4 star dish.
