Would not make this again. There was not enough flavour for the time and mess. The pan was very difficult to clean and the oven now needs cleaning as well.

This sauce was actually pretty good, but too sweet for my taste, so I removed a star.  Next time I will reduce the maple syrup to a teaspoon or so.  Remember that the seasoned rice vinegar is also sweet.  Instead of following these complicated instructions, I just poured the sauce over the fish, no marinating, & baked it in the toaste oven for 14 min or so.  Maybe it didn't have the glazed effect but it didn't mess up my kitchen and it was easy.

This was very delicious. I will make it again. I used king salmon, and will try it with sockeye next. I did use a cast iron pan and had it heated with the oil (instead of a cold pan) because we eat a lot of salmon, and I know how fun it is to clean the skin off the pan. It worked great and the skin came off both the pan and the salmon, but wasn't overcooked.

Easy and delicious. Had a salmon fillet without skin and baked in 400F oven for 15 minutes (1inch thickness) and broiled for 2-3minutes.

Made it as is, except did it on the BBQ grill. Cooked one side then turned and basted done side. Turned and basted other side when almost cooked, a few minutes on each side to grill the sauce and it's done. Served with Authentic German Potato Salad (on AllRecipes) over crisp salad greens dressed with olive oil and Parmesan. Excellent combo. Paired with a crisp Viognier for a perfect match.

Loved this!  I used a Korean seasoned miso because that's what I had and cooked the fish under the broiler for about 5 mins, then brushed with glaze and cooked 2 more mins, brushed with the last of the glaze and broiled 1 min longer.  Sweet and spicy just the way I like it.

I used pure maple syrup but the miso overpowered my fish. I did not use the chili sauce because the kids don't like spice but maybe I'll try it with the Sriracha next time.

Absolutely loved this recipe. The second time I made it I added 2 teaspoons wasabi powder to the sauce and followed the rest of the recipe as is. SO good. The wasabi cut down a bit of the sweetness.

I omitted the chili sauce for the sake of the kids, and they loved it. I cooked in on the grill on tinfoil and it came out fine. Miso is an underrated seasoning. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Love this.  So simple.  I used the unseasoned rice wine vinegar it is much better.  I also baked it on parchment in a cookie sheet so much easier to clean and then all you do is toss the parchment.  

If you want it to be esthetically pleasing you can just put under the broiler to give it a bit of crust but not really necessary.   Served this with saut√©ed Swiss chard which was nice and bitter and balanced the salmon really nicely

Excellent and easy to make, the sauce is enough for 4 fillets. The last 2 minutes I lowered the heat as the first time I made it the top of the fish burned a little bit.

I really liked it! not sure what people are doing to not get good flavour. It wasn't too sweet but remember that miso is naturally salty, so don't add any extra.

Wow, great recipe, great way to prepare salmon. The miso works really well with the maple syrup and vinegar to contrast and enhance the salmon's flavor. I used white miso so I'm curious how it tastes with yellow miso. I'll definitely rotate this recipe into the mix for preparing salmon.

My whole family really enjoyed this recipe.  I marinated the salmon for about 30 minutes, because I didn't have much time to prepare. I omitted the hot sauce, since I have one child who hates spicy foods and one who loves it.  I left the hot sauce on the table for those who wanted it.  I don't think it needed it; I liked the flavor of miso + rice vinegar + maple syrup on its own. Oh, I did make one substitution and used red miso paste, since that was all I had on hand.  And I've broiled this and baked it at 400 degrees.  Broiling is definitely better.

Replaced rice vinegar with cider vinegar.
Cooked on a Barbeque Grill.

For any lover of Miso, this was absolutely fantastic  !!!!

Double recipe. Had white miso and only a little seasoned rice vinegar (not mirin, which is sweet) so used some seasoned apple cider vinegar too.  Cast iron pan. Delicious and moist. Easy and quick. A keeper.

Hubby dislikes salmon. Hubby loved this salmon! He calls it, "real salmon." LOL! Will make again & again for sure. 

I've made the glaze as is and with substitutions: shaoxing wine in place of rice vinegar & brown sugar in place of maple syrup... Very flavorful no matter the combination! 

I make this on "quick and easy" dinner nights so I've devised a way for effortless clean-up. I line a skillet with foil, oil the foil & begin cooking the salmon. Once the bottom has a good start, I then transfer the foil and salmon to a baking sheet to go under the broiler. The only dirtied items are now foil, which I toss, and the mixing equipment!

I tasted the sauce before using it and added a little bit more maple syrup and a tiny bit of soy sauce and sesame oil. I didn't have rice wine vinegar so I used white wine vinegar (possibly why I felt it needed more maple syrup and soy sauce). I also baked it like another reviewer did because I only had frozen salmon. It was good but nothing very special in my opinion

Nice change for boring old salmon.

The recipe requires a bit of finesse after following the recipe initially. It started off too runny leaving a bunch on the foil to burn under the broiler. Following times were eyeballed and the mix stayed on the fish the following times. I skipped the spice since my man and i are wimps and it was requested a few times that next week. its now on my permanent repertoire.

This is the miso glaze I've been s looking for. Well balanced. Used a14" skillet which I think helped with the splatter under the broiler.

Tweaked the recipe a little since I like to use stuff I already have on hand. Used agave syrup instead of maple and used korean kimchi hot sauce instead of hot chilli sauce. The recipe is on point. The miso glaze was sweet (not too sweet -just right in my opinion) with a hint of spice (I used 1 1/2 tbsp of spice). Will be making this again.

The  glaze is excellent! I applied it a bit too enthusiastically for my husband's taste, so next time I will curb my enthusiasm and apply  the glaze moderately. I, however could eat it with a spoon. That's how good it was.

Nice flavor.  I used apple cider vinegar, since I didn't have rice vinegar on hand.  Sprinkled sesame seeds on top.  Cooked in foil over a fire.  The quality of salmon was not tops, which may be influencing my review.
