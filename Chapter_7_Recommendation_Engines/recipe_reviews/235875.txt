I make this but I never have buttermilk. So for the half cup of milk I add one tsp. white vinegar and let it rest five minutes. Or double the recipe if needed. Also for extra crunch if I have them I shred radishes into the slaw. Great recipe as is I really hate to tweet someone's recipe. One more thing, I don't use a box shredder. Use a knife and slice and chop as thin as possible. The slaw won't get as soggy, and will last another day without being to wet.

Gotta say, this is pretty darn close.  My cole slaw typically has a thicker dressing, but the restaurant slaw doesn't, so this one is spot on.  Followed the recipe to the letter, and this is a good copycat recipe.

Delicious! I've never had Chik-Fil-A's slaw, but we loved this one. It is more on the sweeter side and has a thinner dressing as lutzflcat mentioned. This actually sort of reminded me of KFC's slaw. I will def be making this one again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great cole slaw dressing recipe! This now replaces the dressing that I had always made.  For extra color and crunch I add some finely diced green pepper (or red) and a tad of finely diced onion as well.
Thanks for sharing!

This was very good, and is pretty close to the slaw from Chick-Fil-A®. If you like their slaw, you'll like this!

Classic coleslaw! Save yourself a lot of hassle and buy a bag of slaw mix. I was looking for slaw that would taste like your run-of-the-mill, creamy, tangy, crispy slaw to use to top pulled pork sliders and this was perfect! My guests all raved about how good it tasted. Hardly any leftovers and it was absolutely simple to make.

We do like Chick-fil-A® slaw, and this is close.  We found the dressing to be a little thinner than the original. If you like a creamy base slaw, this is a good recipe, and one I will be using again.  I shredded the cabbage and carrot in a food processor to get the fine texture.  This is a great recipe to top pulled pork with.  Thanks Tisha, for sharing your copycat recipe.

great base recipe - I did put a little less than the 1/3 cup and it was sweet enough. I used apple cider vinegar because I was out of regular vinegar and it worked out!

Are usually avoid sweet dressing recipes, but this has a nice balance. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used half-and-half Greek yogurt and milk. I'll make this one again.

I would make it again bit with half of the sugar. This is a very sweet version...maybe because we don't eat a lot of sweets.

This is excellent. I didn't have buttermilk so I used milk and  1 1/2 teaspoons cider vinegar and reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons.

This was excellent! Just like I had hoped! Everyone at Thanksgiving raved and two people who don’t like cole slaw said it was great. Great compliment! And it was so easy. I couldn’t find buttermilk so I used vinegar mixed with milk. Perfect! Oh, and it tasted just like my mom’s slaw, I was in heaven!

This was okay. I made it according to the recipe with tricolor cabbage with carrots. It seemed bland. I may try it again with angel hair coleslaw. Hubby wasn’t impressed and likely I may end up eating this all by myself - or tossing it. I likely will. E looking for another coleslaw recipe. This is close - but still a ways to go.

Really close to Chil-Fil-A and a really good slaw to use next to pulled pork. As Southern clasic.

Very, very good. I used savoy cabbage but think green cabbage would've been crunchier. I used some tips from the AR article,  including the suggestion of tossing the cabbage with salt to remove some moisture. We did enjoy it and it did reminded me of the restaurant version. Thank you for the recipe.

since Chick-fil-a stopped serving their coleslaw this is a welcome replacement. Wish they had kept in the menu I really liked it, but this is just as good.

I've only eaten at Chik-Fil-A a couple times, enjoying the coleslaw each time.  Don't remember how close this is to the original but who cares, this recipe has become my new favorite coleslaw recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Good but not special. Love Chick Filet's cole slaw so was excited to see this recipe. It "kinda" tastes like the Chick's but not quite.

Would not make again.  Too thin and watery.  Made exactly as per recipe but not enough flavor for us.  Sorry.

Loved it but I had to change it up a bit as I didn't have all the ingredients.  I didn't have any sugar so used organic honey and I rarely have buttermilk on hand so I used organic milk 1 cup with 1 Tbs of lemon juice and just let it set until everything else was ready. I added 1 @  Tbsps of lemon juice and white vinegar. Also about 1 1/2  to 2 tsps celery seeds; I increased the mayo to 1 + about 1/4 cup. I ended up with about 6 1/2 -7 cups of slaw and it has passed my taste test!!!  Yummo!!!
