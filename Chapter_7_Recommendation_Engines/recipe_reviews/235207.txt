Took it to a friends house to grill and had to give her the recipe, now it's her go to burger recipe too! I made them once as the recipe stated and they were very good. For Even better tasting tasting burgers, I used onion mushroom soup mix and a packet of ranch, along with a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce and a couple dashes of franks red hot. The flavor was intensified without any added heat. Got compliments from even my mother in law, who pretty much hates all my food, so that's saying something! I dont ever add the water it calls for.

Delicious! These were soft when I first formed them, but I did that earlier in the day and put them into the fridge until I was ready to cook them, which allowed them to firm up a bit and allowed the flavors to blend. These came out, very moist and juicy with great flavor. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Easy peasy and my guests LOVED this! Normally, I'm not a big fan of shortcutting recipes by using powder mixes and such, but I happily make an exception for this one because the flavor is so amazing. You can't even tell that mixes were involved!  I've served this at 3 barbecue dinner gatherings and people always ask, "What's in this burger? The flavor is so good." When I tell them it's just water, soup mix, and dressing mix, they are shocked. It's moist, flavorful, and when you add a slice of cheese and some crisp bacon on top, it's absolutely decadent. Follow the recipe exactly for best results!

This is awesome. Best burgers I've tasted. I only had 1 lb. beef so I just cut recipe in half. That worked well. This is quick and simple. No modification needed.

We've been grilling burgers forever but I'm always looking for something different.  This is now my go to recipe!  As recommended by others I added Worcestershire and a touch of hot sauce and reduced water to 1/4cup.  I've made them three times this way and have received rave reviews each time!

Followed the recipe and these were delicious. I was in a rush, so the burgers had almost no time to let the flavors blend, but they were still amazing. This is now my go to burger recipe, thank you for sharing it!

Im skeptical about adding water although no one else has commented on it. It just seems a bit odd to me. Has anyone tried it with milk or some kind of broth instead? I do want to try the recipe!

Wow! These were SOOOOOO good! I used ground turkey bc we don't eat red meat and everyone raved about how delicious they were. Only used 1/3 cup of water and added about 1 tsp of worcestershire sauce. I will never make burgers differently again.

Thanks for the recipe .I definitely will be using it agian

I liked these, but felt that the water gave the burgers a slightly weird texture.  Next time I think I would either reduce or eliminate the water altogether.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, tjrker07!

I must not have added enough Ranch mix, it got lost in the the onion soup.  Very moist burger though.
