The first time I made this I used lite coconut milk and it was a disaster. Went out on a limb to try it again with regular coconut milk and it was so delicious looking and tasting that I had to post a photo. One of my favorite soups! I added a little wild rice, since I had some on hand.

DH absolutely loves this...made it for supper tonight.  He is still oohing and aahing over it.  The lime juice, cilantro and just a hint of salt at the end completed this dish.  You definitely have to like thai dishes/seasonings.  We will be repeating this over and over.  Used rotisserie chicken, so was super easy/quick to make.

like other recipes i knew i was going to have to doctor this up based on other reviews.. i also had a very limited fridge as we need to do our weekly shopping.. that being said i sauteed two garlic cloves in a splash of House of Tsang's Stir-Fry Oil.. chopped up and threw in 1 tomato, 2 carrots, 1/2 a zucchini, and about 1/2 a cup's worth of celery.. added the canned coconut milk (full fat) and 2 cups of my own ginger infused bone broth.. i had to sub 1/4 cup bottled lemon for the 2 T lime (but know the fresh lime would have been killer).. and added three slices of ginger bc i wanted this to be super flavorful.. also added 2 T of soy sauce (would've done fish sauce if i had it on hand).. brought it all to a boil.. then simmered on very low heat for 45 minutes.. added about a cup of and a half of leftover chopped up rotisserie and some cilantro.. and sprinkled some chicken bouillon over it.. after thinking about it i could have just added more soy sauce.. oh well there's always next time! this turned out to be one of my best asian soups.. ty for the beginning of a great meal

I loved it just like the recipe says to make it & loved it even more with a few modifications.  I added rice noodles, sugar snow peas, water chest nuts and chives. Alot more filling for sure. My kids and boyfriend loved it. I'll be making it again soon.

Made this tonight and it was awesome! When I tasted it straight out of the pot it seemed to need something, once I spooned it into my bowl I topped it off with the lime & cilantro & that did the trick!

It was good but the flavoring was a bit strong for us.  I added extra plain  chicken broth and liked it better.

My husband loves coconut soup from Thailand. I wanted to surprise him and he loved it. I followed the directions, some what. He loved it and thatâ€™s all that is important. Thanks for posting the recipe.

I made this soup exactly as in the recipe, and it was extremely bland. I added salt, more ginger, sriracha sauce, some red wine vinegar and brown sugar to get that hot and sour flavor.

This soup is easy to make and has nice flavor but definitely needs some red pepper flakes and other seasonings  (like ginger and garlic) to bring out its best.

Really a great soup.  I didn't have chicken, so I made it with shrimp and tofu; otherwise followed the recipe.   I really liked the flavor of this soup.  Highly recommend.

I made this with shrimp instead of chicken. Has kind of a hot and sour vibe to it. My husband really liked it. I thought it was just ok. It was alright, but probably not something I'd make again.

Different and yummy. Used Trader Joe's broth of the same type, and lite coconut milk, although I am sure full fat would have been even better. I did not care for the red pepper, thought it was a little too strong, so next time won't add that, might add half an onion or scallions instead. This recipe is very friendly to adding additional veggies, I threw in some left over frozen vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower and carrots) and I am sure it would be great with peas, snow peas, even green beans. Used a dash of cayenne for just a touch of heat. Great for lower carb diets, but would also be yummy with some rice or noodles added. Will be eating this for lunch all week!

So easy and so good.   The broth provides and excellent base to whatever you want to add for your soup. I used left over turkey from a breast I made in the crockpot the day before (Slow cooker turkey breast recipe on this site), added frozen baby corn, and ramen noodles (the square kind from the store) without the seasoning packet and cooked until the noodles were done. The coconut milk make it so creamy and delish. I like things with kick so also ended up adding chili oil at the end. If you like the taste of Thai buy this broth and you can't go wrong.

This recipe is AMAZING!  If you like thai food particularly thai tom kha soup, then you are going to love this.  I only make half the recipe, but it turns out great, which equates to about two large bowls of soup.  I also add Videla onion to the recipe, & I omit the chicken.  And if you don't have fresh cilantro, dried cilantro will work - but definitely try to use fresh cilantro because it gives a more flavorful taste.  Additionally, I typically have lemon juice but no lime juice, so I substitute a few squirts of lemon juice in place of the lime juice, which works just fine.  This is definitely a recipe you should try if you like thai food!

Tried this tonight and it was delicious. We have a restaurant in B'ham called Surin and they make an amazing coconut soup. This recipe tastes exactly like it. So happy to have found it. Light and filling. I used spring onion instead of mushrooms and nixed the red pepper not a fan of either. Instead I used spring onion and carrots. Give it a try! You won't regret it :)

Loved it! Served this for dinner tonight along with sliced Fuji's and carrot sticks.  Recipe made 2 big bowls.  Our grocer didn't have the Swanson Thai broth so I substituted 1 packet from A Taste of Thai "Coconut Ginger Soup Base".  Used extra cilantro.  Tried it with and without lime juice.  I think I liked without the lime juice better.  I will be making this soup again

This was great!  I made it without the chicken (had none on hand) and added a bit of cayenne pepper but otherwise followed the directions exactly as written.  Easy, quick, delicious lunch!
