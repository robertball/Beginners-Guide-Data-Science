I realize that I'm rating and reviewing this recipe with changes I made; however, without these changes, I wouldn't have been able to eat the dish, and it's just intriguing enough that I had to take the chance of being fussed at. I added 1 small can of chopped green chilies to compensate for not being able to eat a full-flavored picante sauce, and I added 4 thinly sliced green onions for the same reason. We chose to use the brown rice, cooked in the microwave, and placed into the freezer for about 15 - 20 minutes to cool down rather quickly. The entire dish was room temp, and was very good.
I think I'll have planned leftover chicken at least once every week to 10 days just for this dish. It's fantastic!. Thanks to the recipe writer, and please keep up the good work. I'm a for-sure fan!

Easy recipe to make with usual stuff on hand.  I didn't have brown rice so used Jasmine rice and thought was a good substitute.  I also do not prefer cilantro, so didn't add.  I used Newmans Own Chunky medium salsa and thought it added just the right tastes.
