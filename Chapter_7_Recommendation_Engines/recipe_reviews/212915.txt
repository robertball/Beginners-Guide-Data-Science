Great marinade, pork was juicy and flavorful.  I didn't make the kabobs, but grilled a whole pork tender loin, cut into about four pieces.  Took about twice as long to cook.

Made this in an oven since we don't have a grill but still came out well! Smelled SO good in the oven.  Sweet and savory flavor :)

This is FANTASTIC.  My husband says it's the best pork he's ever had, and I'm inclined to agree.  Subbed brown sugar Splenda for the sugar.  I used boneless country style pork ribs and trimmed the fat off of them before marinating because that's what I had on hand.  Will absolutely be making this one again and again!

This was incredible! It made enough to share with a neighbor and her family too and we both agreed that the flavor was strong throughout, even after only a 4-hour marinade.

Followed directions - wouldn't change a thing other than marinating overnight.  1.5 hrs was all the time I had & they were DELICIOUS. Even my 9-yr old non-meat-a-souris loved them and ate 2 whole kabobs. Didn't bother taking meat off the skewers!  This is a keeper!

7.2.18  These kebabs were simply delicious.  Only change I made was cutting back the amount of sugar and sub’ing Truvia® (personal taste preference here).  I used pork tenderloin and marinated for about 8 hours.  I often find that marinades with soy sauce end up with the meat tasting just like soy sauce, but that wasn’t the case here.  I used pork tenderloin, and the pork flavor was the star.  My pork cubes were about 1-1/2” to 2”, they were grilled for a total of 6 minutes, and they ended up slightly overdone.  In the future, I’m thinking probably 4-5 minutes max to get that nice pink color and tender pork.  Regardless, they still were devoured!

This was a deliciously easy recipe!  Made a couple changes to make it a little healthier.  Used the juice from a can of pineapple slices, reduced sugar to 1/3 cup & used low sodium soy sauce.  Made separate skewers with the pineapple, onions, bell pepper & cherry tomatoes and dipped each in the marinade before cooking.  Turned out fab!

Easy. Of course, I double the garlic. Can't be helped.
Forgot about meat marinading. Two and a half days later it was still delicious.

Easy to make & very tasty.  My Filipina wife loved them as it was a taste of baboy BBQ just like the street vendors back home sell.

These turned out as well as all the other reviewers have said. I made the recipe as written with one adjustment; I reduced the sugar to 2/3 of a cup. I marinated them for 2 hours, and cooked over a charcoal grill. They were delicious -- the flavor of the marinade combined with the smoky grill taste was superb. I served it with grilled acorn squash slices and baked potatoes. Great autumn dinner.

This was a hit, everyone was mmmmmmmm as they ate, added extra garlic as always. To speed up the marinade time, sliced the pork thin like carne asada , which helped also to lessen cook time. A +   You could add sesame oil to marinade so pork would not stick to grill.

I would make it again. I did not have time to let soak for 2 hours so left some aside to baste as cooking. They turned out GREAT! I would recommend people try this. I will add a touch of heat next time to the mix though.

Delicious. I made this a few weeks ago for a group of 20 and it was a huge success.
I did add a tap of smoked paprika (just because) to the marinade and started the skewers off on the smoker for a couple of hours as we were in no hurry and then finished them off on the bbq until the inside temperature of the meat was at 145deg and then let them rest for 5 mins before serving.
It was so good I am making it again today.

Made this last night and my husband and I absolutely loved it. Had a busy day so only marinated for about 3 hours but the pork was still really full of flavor.  Will definitely make this again.  The only change I made was using half regular soy sauce and half low sodium soy sauce.

Needed more salt; flavor mild after 1.5 hours. Mild flavor that would go with a variety of sides.

These kebabs were very good.  I  added pineapple chunks between the pork when I put them on the skewers.  I did these in oven at 375 for 15 minutes per side and they came out perfect. Very tasty.

Wow, the flavor that comes through in this marinade is amazing!  I used coconut sugar in place of regular sugar and marinated for about 2 1/2 hours.  Served with corn and potatoes, delicious!

Came out nice. I would use beef instead of pork next time. Not sure why my pork came out a little dry, but great flavors. I will add sweet chili next time and see how that come out.

We loved it!! I did tweak it a little.  I added 2 TB of oil to marinade as well as some Thai Chili Seasoning about 2 tsp.  After skewering I sprinkled kosher salt lightly on both sides.  We do not use traditional soy sauce we use Organic Tamari Gluten Free Soy Sauce so we needed a little salt kick.  We are going to try the marinade for other pork dishes and perhaps even beef and chicken.

Wonderful recipe!  Of all the times I've made kabobs, I've never tried them with pork.  We've been missin' out!  I marinated overnight, using the recipe with 3/4 c. sugar rather than a full cup.  We used metal skewers rather than bamboo.  The flavor was great, and it paired really nicely with 'Brazilian Grilled Pineapple', 'Trees, Seeds and Beans' from AR and grilled green beans.  Definitely a recipe worth repeating.

Loved the marinade. I used pork tenderloin and wrapped each piece in 1/2 piece of bacon before putting it on skewer. Yum!
