Easy Healthy Zucchini Salad Haiku: "I did 'zoodles' too. This was very colorful, flavor not so great." So other than zoodling my zucchini and using red onion for additional color, I didn't make any changes. We weren't terribly fond of it, and the only culprit we came up w/ was the Worcestershire sauce, which we seem to think didn't jive well w/ the freshness of the veggies and herbs, and that a splash of balsamic or red wine vinegar and a good olive oil would've been much better. Even as the leftovers marinated in the fridge, the flavor didn't improve. I will say that it was pretty, and as the recipe author mentions in the notes, there are countless ways to customized it w/ diff. veggies. I just think the lube part of it needs to change.

A flavorful and highly versatile salad as noted in the footnotes. I spiralized the zucchini into zoodles. This needs to marinate for an hour.
