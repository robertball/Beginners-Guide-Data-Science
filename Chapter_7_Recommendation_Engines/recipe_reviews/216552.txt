Wow, what an easy and delicious dish to prepare! I worried there might not be enough seasonings but this dish was flavourful and refreshing.

Excellent .....and I love quinoa so this is just another delicious way to enjoy it....my only mini change was to cook my quinoa in chicken broth instead of water. Loved this healthy and light dinner. Thanks Gitano!

delicious!  I added in chopped parley and chick peas and omitted the spinach, onion & cukes (only because I didn't have any on hand) - and it was still great.  Husband loved it.  I used lemon instead of lime and added a little EVOO to make a dressing.

As is, the recipe doesn't have enough of a dressing to serve it over the spinach leaves. The rating is for the recipe without the spinach and also with a tablespoon of olive oil added to pull the flavors together a bit more.

This is good but I thought it needed some garlic powder, a splash of Louisiana hot sauce and a seeded, devained and diced fresh jalapeno.  I used my microwave rice cooker and followed the instructions on the side of the quinoa box.

Used regular quinoa and LOVED this - also cooked quinoa in chicken stock rather than water.  Next time may add a kick of cilantro.  Great recipe and a crowd pleaser!

This was a good base. As others said, there isn't really enough dressing, and I felt like it needed a little more kick. I mixed up an olive oil and balsamic dressing with a bit more cumin to pour over the spinach leaves and a bit more on the salad. I like the idea of using these flavors on the quinoa.

Yum - loved this recipe! My husband and boys (5 and 2) had never had quinoa before, and it was met with mixed reactions. My husband and I love it, my oldest thought it was okay, and my two year old barely touched it. I doubled the recipe so I would have extra to take to work this week for lunches, which I am really looking forward to. I really like the nuttier flavor of the red quinoa, and thought all of the veggies were a good combination for the dish. Some people said the lime juice and cumin didn't make enough of a dressing, but I thought it was perfect. This definitely isn't a recipe that you would want drenched in a dressing because it would cover up all the wonderfulness that these ingredients have on their own. Thank you for sharing the recipe, Gitano!

I don't know why, but I thought this was going to be a hot dish.  Obviously I didn't read the instructions all the way through.  I thought the flavor was very good - the lime and cumin.  I didn't have red quinoa, so I used regular quinoa, and I could have used more of it.  Also, the avocado I had wasn't quite ripe.  All in all, I don't think there's anything wrong with the recipe, I think my dissatisfaction had to do with me wanting a hot dish and using an unripe avocado.   I'll try it out again...

Fantastic! Made it as is, and it was very good - 4.5 stars as written. But I made a couple of slight tweaks to really add that little extra:

- Extra 1T lime juice
- Extra 1/8t of cumin
- Add 1/8t garlic powder

To me, that added the extra "dressing" and tiny extra punch that made this out of this world! On a side portion, I also mixed in a bit of oil/balsamic as other suggested, but I thought that confused the taste of the lime/cumin. It was still good, but a bit off.

Will add this to my staples, SOOOO easy to make especially with cooked quinoa at the ready!

Unique flavor (must be the cumin) in a healthy summer salad.  Just came back from Peru with some red quinoa - first time I tried it.  Wonderful.  Wouldn't change a thing except to add some browned chicken strips (coated in cumin, red pepper and salt) for protein.

Good idea for a fresh healthy recipe...but ditch the spinach and serve beside fish in place of couscous or in place of a pasta salad at a summer cookout.

This is a great salad but will make a couple changes next time: less red onion or use green onion (red onion was too strong), and more avocado as I love it in salad! Other than that, it was simple, easy, healthy and delicious! What more can you ask for?

Didn't use Avacado, added 1 cup canned chickpeas instead.
Used cayenne pepper as I didn't have cumin seeds.
So good.

I made small adjustments..I used regular quinoa, onions  instead of red onions and lettuce - basic what I had in my fridge. It was really good! Next time, I'll follow the recipe to compare with my version of it!

This is delicious,  and atkins friendly I believe. I didn't use as much onion and tomato and that cuts the carbs down.  Also on the atkins 40 you can have quinoa. I love having something yummy and healthy

Made this as directed and it is delicious.  The lime juice and cumin do not overpower the nutty taste of the quinoa plus the cool cucumber and tomatoes, crunchy red onion and creamy avocado all combine beautifully.  Other recipes that I have made using quinoa have heavy dressings that make it soggy but that is not the case here.  Quinoa stays light and fluffy.

This is an easy, delicious, and very refreshing salad. I added half of a minced jalapeño to the dressing, which worked well. The recipe says it makes two servings, but it's more like one serving if you're eating it as an entree. You can probably reduce the amount of avocado, too. This would be a spectacular lunch or dinner for those summer days when it's too hot to think.

Love this salad. It's quick and easy to make. I also like to add feta cheese and crushed walnuts for a crunch. So yummy.

Like some of the other posters, I added a few things, but only because I had them. I thought the salad was exceptionally good. I added carrots, radishes and when I served it, I crumbled a little bacon on top, which I had on hand. Hubby loved it.

The recipe intrigued me since I love all of the ingredients. Together it was still missing something - my husband poured dressing on it to liven it up. The dish was blah - I could have easily skipped the spinach.

I want to comment on the cook's notes that say red and white quinoa taste the same--I disagree.  Red quinoa has a nuttier, deeper flavor which is absolutely delicious.  It's also quite a bit more expensive.  I do think this recipe would work with either, but if the cost is not prohibitive, use the red quinoa for the flavor and color.

Eliminated the onion and spinach to make it more kid-friendly, and my daughter who swore she doesn't like quinoa actually licked her plate clean. I did think there was a bit too much lime juice in the dressing. I will add some olive oil next time to tone it down. A delicious and easy recipe.

I couldn't find red quinoa but i found organic Andes quinoa and used that instead.  We went to Peru a few years ago and that was the first time I was introduced to this ingredient.  This recipe was very good and tasty, and it was even better the next day after it had chilled.  Will be making this again for sure!!
