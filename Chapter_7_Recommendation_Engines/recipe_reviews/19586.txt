I thought this was totally yummy. I put in two cloves of garlic, too. Also I was confused about the amounts (19 oz cans?) - I used the 15oz cans for the beans. For the lentils I used a small can of condensed lentil soup. That pretty much took care of the spices, and both the salt and the oregano werent neccessary. It was thicker than I wanted and still tasted mostly like the canned tomatoes, so I added chicken broth until I liked the consistency and the taste. Then I added a couple spoonfuls of tomato paste just because it seemed like a good idea. Made a giant pot and is seriously really tasty. Cant wait to try it again after a day.

Delicious and very easy! Makes a big pot, which I meant to freeze for later but I ended up eating it all within a couple of days. Will definitely make this one again.

Well - I did make changes to it - like I drained the beans and rinsed them - and then I added about a liter of vegetable broth to make it more soupy less stew-ish... it was a very nice flavor - just giving it a 3 star b/c it's not like the best I've ever had. But it's decent enough and I may make it again b/c it uses up some of my canned/dried food storage. Thanks.

This is good, but not great.  As others have said, it's not all that flavorful but what flavor it does have is pleasant.  I've never heard of canned lentils, so I put in a cup of dried lentils.  That meant that the soup needed to be cooked a little longer and I had to add a lot of extra water as it was cooking.  I recommend putting the cheese on top of each bowl instead of mixing it  into the soup.

This recipe was really good.  Loved the fact that it's packed with fibre and low in calories.  The only thing I changed was using 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1.  Thanks for posting!

I thought it was ok. I just realized that I completely forgot about putting the cheese in. I don't think it would have made much of a difference though.

Better than I thought it would be. Quite tasty. I added a bit of whole wheat pasta as well as shredded cabbage because there only seemed to be beans without addition of some sort of vegetable (besides the onion).

This was really good. The only change I made was to add a can of chicken broth to thin it down alittle. It was alittle bland before I added the mozzarella cheese. We thought the addition of the cheese was great and made the soup taste like pizza. I will be making this again. Thanks!

I read the reviews, and many said this was bland, so I made adjustments accordingly.  I added a chopped jalapeno to the onions and garlic, and then added some chopped ham which I had in the fridge.  There were no canned lentils in my supermarket, so I substituted a can of black beans.  Since the recipe stated to add the beans undrained, which means extra sodium, I omitted the salt.  It already was very thick, so I cut back on the tomato paste, and added some chicken broth to reach the consistency I was looking for. I realized after I took the photo that I'd forgotten to add the mozzarella, and I have to say that I really didn't like what the cheese did to the appearance.  In the future, I think I'll omit the mozzarella, and just put some shredded parmesan on the table to sprinkle on as a topping.  I almost look at this recipe as a base, so just taste as you go and adjust the seasonings to suit your taste.  I know, I know, I made a number of changes to this recipe, but the final outcome was very satisfying, and man, is this easy to make!!

I've made this without the onions (never really liked onions, even cooked), tomato paste, and the cheese and it's just as yummy. I just need to make smaller portions since I live alone. I love it!

Very boring and bland. I'm sure that if I were cooking for a family (instead of just myself), they would complain and ask me not to make this again. The recipe isn't terrible but you have to add more spices. Plus I had to simmer it for about an hour to cook the beans and get a nice consistency for the sauce (I didn't add the liquid from the beans. I added less than 2c of water to make a stew not soup).

Made this yesterday.  Very easy and fast to put together.  I added 4 cloves of garlic and upped the salt and pepper as I found it bland with the amounts given in the recipe.  Did not add the tomato paste.  As it got pretty thick the next day, I will either delete one of the cans of beans or add vegetable broth when I make it again.  It was pretty good, nothing spectacular.  May or may not make it again.  However, the family really liked it.f

Made it again with only a can of  kidney beans and a can of lentils.  No tomato paste.  Added more garlic and 1-1/4 tsp salt.....Delish!!

I followed the recipe exactly
**This includes NOT draining the cans and adding the canned fluid to the soup** 

It's alright. If you want something quick, easy, will warm and fill you up; you'll love this.

This recipe is good.  I did make quite a few changes to it to suite my taste and to modify it with ingredients I had and it turned out GREAT.  Here are the changes I made.  I used canned rinsed black beans instead of lentils because that is what I had in my pantry,  I used stewed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes to give it more flavor.  I omitted the salt because I did not taste that it needed anything and coming from a salt-a-holic like myself that is saying a lot .   I did not measure the tomato paste I just squeezed some in.  I added more garlic and orgaeno because I like those spices.  It was more of a stew than a soup so I added a can of chicken broth.  I tasted it before putting it in my crock pot (because I won't be home for dinner and my kid needs to eat) and the taste was better than I thought it would be,  Overall, this recipe is easy, fast to prepare and had I been making it for a NOW meal cooking it on  top of the stove would have been just as easy.  I am paring this up with some home made corn bread and wala there is my dinner.  It does make a lot and I am looking forward to some left overs.  Thanks for the recipe and I look forward to trying more from you!

What I like about this recipe is that it's super easy, makes a lot, and the type/quantity of beans can easily be altered. I forgot about the oregano, but it still came out good. The mozzarella cheese made a big difference.
