I did not like zucchini until I grilled it like this.  So delicious!  I don't cut the zucchini into rounds, but instead cut it lengthwise into quarters and score the flesh every inch or so to really get the marinade in there.  I also don't use a full bottle of dressing, just however much it takes to coat the zucchini.  I'm so glad to have something to do with my zucchini besides bake it into bread!

Very easy for sure.  I usually add other vegetables too - mushrooms, bell peppers etc.  You really don't need an entire bottle of dressing.  Just enough to coat the vegetables.

I made two servings of this, just eyeballing the Italian salad dressing and using way less than the recipe indicates.  This was good.  I think the grilling time for this recipe is way too long.  Hubs grilled my 1/2" rounds for 4 minutes on the first side and 3 minutes on the second.  I might even have him cut that back to a total of 6 minutes next time.

I use sliced zucchini, red onion slices and small yellow, orange and red peppers sliced.  I marinate with the Italian dressing for several hours. Drain before grilling.  I use the frying pan with the little holes on the bottom and have my husband add to the grill  for about 12-15 min.  Delicious and easy.
