Well, the syrup is pretty good and the cooking time was right on the mark..it thickened nicely after just a few mins..but it would be better with about 1/4 tsp cinnamon and maybe 1/4 tsp salt.  The topping just doesn't work - no flavor whatsoever.   We peeled the bread topping off and just ate the apples and syrup mixture with a little vanilla ice cream.   This dessert is bland, sorry.
