Not bad, just not my cup of tea.  Didn't do too well at our party.

These were excellent! Only change I made is that I made the polenta myself because I don't like the tube stuff. great taste and will make again!

An easy appetizer and different from the usual. The flavors went nicely with some Prosecco. Thank you for the recipe.

Simple and delicious with a great blend of flavors! Of course, the grocery store did not have any rolled polenta, so I just made my own, which was probably better anyways. :) I wasn't sure how hubby was gonna like these, but he really enjoyed them too. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is such a wonderful mix of flavors.  I can't wait to serve this at my next get together.  I agree making the prosciutto crispy would set this over the edge, I would also cut back on the amount of pest on each bite for personal preference.

Quick...easy...and a simple appetizer especially during the holidays. I loved the fresh pesto with the prosciutto. Next time I will crisp up the prosciutto under the broiler before layering it on top. Delicious!
