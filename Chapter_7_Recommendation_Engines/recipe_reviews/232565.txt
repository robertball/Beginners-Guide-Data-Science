Delicious!  I did use more avocado than called for but that is just because I love them!  My granddaughter said to serve this on a ham sandwich and you'd have Green Eggs and Ham!

Fabulous idea for a healthier "mayonaise".  I thought that 1/2 an avocado was just right for this recipe, I'm thinking of using avocado in my tuna next time too!   Thanks for a great recipe idea!

I haven't had egg salad in years.  I've been wanting to make some since I now have my own chickens.  This recipe was so good.  Definitely a keeper!  I did use more avocado and in place of the salt & pepper, I used a squeeze of fresh lemon juice & a dash of tabasco.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, K-Dub!

I have made hundreds of recipes on this sight and not reviewed them, but this one I HAD to.  I just made it for lunch and I will never make egg salad the old way again!  Thank you!

I added a whole avocado to four boiled eggs and it was enough for I & my husband for a sandwich each. Egg salad is generally very heavy and leaves you very full afterwards and this was no exception.
I also poured in about a tablespoon of lemon juice for some zest and used Dijon mustard instead of yellow. I realized too late that I didn't have any paprika in my pantry :( 
I slapped it on some soft fluffy bread and it made a great filling lunch and fed my avocado addiction.
*For those who say it's bland I would say that the seasoning you add or don't add makes the sandwich. You can't blame the recipe if you don't properly add salt & pepper to your liking. The fun thing about recipes is you can add or take away whatever makes you happy. Taste test everything and season until your taste buds dance ;)

I thought this was a great healthy option, but I did find it a bit bland.  I tried it first as written, then added some capers for some extra flavor.  I do love this idea and will continue to tweak it.  I think I'll try it next time with Dijon.  Thank you for the healthy idea.

What a great addition to egg salad - avocado.  I was very excited to try this recipe, and I was not disappointed.  I was leery that it would bind together without any mayonnaise, but it worked great.  I've made this several times to pack in my lunch.  All the gals I eat lunch with asked for this recipe.  Now they make their egg salad this way.  The avocado adds so much flavor and depth to the salad, it just is an odd color.  Thanks K-Dub for sharing your recipe.  I've shared it many times!

Very flavorful and so easy to make. I did use more avocado and used Dijon mustard as that is our preference. Absolutely delicious! Thanks K-Dub for sharing!

So simple yet so good!  This is one of those recipes where you think "Now why didn't I think of that?".  I love avocado's and have come across a breed here in Florida called Slimcado's, not quite as flavorful as the varieties I had on the West Coast but still delicious.  Because of this, I did add a tiny bit of pickle relish, just for some zing!  I think this would be amazing incorporated into a non-mayo potato salad:)

I was so hungry for an egg sandwich, so when I saw this one, I HAD to have it!  I used a little more avocado than called for, and I made two substitutions:  Dijon instead of the yellow mustard and Tajin (chili powder with dehydrated lime) for the paprika.  I ate this open faced and loved it!  I think my son would like this without the bread because he is on the paleo diet, and this would work.  This is delicious!

Love, love, love.  I am doing Weight Watchers and I had decided that egg salad was out of the picture for me because I CANNOT abide fat free mayo.  Yech! The avocado is a perfect substitute.  Adds a nice "legal" fattiness.  I used spicy brown mustard, extra avocado and added finely chopped celery for a little texture and volume.

Great idea and execution with your own spin is a must. I do think the previous reviews are correct about avocado to egg mixture being subjective. I did three eggs to one full avocado which was perfect for me as well as adding cumin.

Delicious!! It's a great change to regular egg salad. The first thing, though, is 15 minutes is too long to let the eggs sit in hot water. 12-13 minutes cooks it properly. Second, I used a whole avocado because we LOVE them. Served it on toasted bread. Yum!  Our 18 month old was even a huge fan!

Other than using a whole avocado, I made the recipe as directed.  It seemed to be missing something.  It was kind of bland.

Delicious and knowing that it is "lite" made it all the better. I used Honey-Mustard Dijon and added more just to give it a bit more moisture. Tastes good in a tortilla too!

This was a fun twist for egg salad.  It was way dry for our liking with just the half-avocado, so we ended up using a little mayo also, just to get that creamier consistency.  Next time, I will try it with more avo.  Thanks!!

I loved this!  I used 4 eggs, one whole avocado, dijon mustard, onion powder, salt, pepper, paprika.  OH and I added a Tablespoon of lemon juice to keep the avocado from turning brown.  

Definitely a KEEPER for sure!!  Next time I'll use a tiny bit of chopped onion.

I always add minced celery and peppers to my egg salad, so I added them to this one too.  The only slight issue was the color...fixed that with some turmeric.  Wonderful egg salad, I just need to go kick my avocado tree to let it know I need more...LOTS more.

After reading the reviews, I used 1 whole avocado and 6 hard-boiled eggs.  1/2 teaspoon of mustard tasted too bland even with generous sprinkle of salt, pepper and lemon juice, so I used about 2 tablespoons. I kept it in the fridge for an hour after making.
The sandwich tasted dreamy! This is the creamiest, tastiest, healthiest egg sandwich I've ever eaten.
Will make again and again! :D :D Thank you!

Awesome pregnancy snack! Made it for about 20 people in our birthing class. I doubled the avocado and I would do the same with the mustard next time since it was slightly on the dry side. Tasted great though!

This was really good. Avocados are one of my favorite foods and I am always looking for different things to do with them.  This was really easy and tasty. I recommend adding a healthy dash of lemon juice to keep your avocado from turning brown. It also adds more flavor.

I put in a whole avocado n added just a touch of mayo for sweetness, a tablespoon. I might try smoked paprika next time for a little more flavor. Very quick n easy, very good :)

Had this for lunch today with whole wheat bread. I used more avocado, just cause I like it. Good by itself without the bread also, makes a nice light snack. Thank you K-Dub for sharing.

Great concept, not a good execution.  I like to have more goo and this recipe just comes out dry.  So I used 6 eggs, a whole avocado (plus a little lime juice to keep the avo green longer), 2T of spiced mustard, slightly more than the recommended green onions, and I still felt like I had to add 1/4 C of mayo,  ... Probably could have added a little less mayo, but I still liked it. Plus I added 2 diced clausen pickles(because I love them), and 1.5 T of cilantro ... because why not with the avocado and lime(?), and it only enhanced the egg salad flavor, no Mexican flavor like I anticipated.  It made enough for  4 open faced sandwiches, and 2.5 regular sandwiches (I use less in a regular sandwich to avoid too much spilling out the edges).

I used more avocado, but don't think it was enough. The green onions were not optional in my opinion. I ended up adding small dives of extra sharp cheddar to add some flavor.

Very good.  Mustard and paprika are my least favorite ingredients so I took advice from other poster to use lemon juice instead. Perfect!  Lots of salt & pepper a must. For a little bit more kick try a few shakes of Lawry's seasoning salt. Thanks for giving us a mayo-free egg salad recipe

I love egg salad and I love avocados, so I was happy to find this recipe and excited to try it. It was bland and dry. I would not recommend this to anyone, and I'm not sure how the recipe could fixed to make it better.

Brilliant! I didn't have the mustard or the onions and this still turned out amazing.  What a simple idea and so delicious.  I used a whole small avocado and one clove of garlic just for a little extra kick.  I will definitely be making this again, thanks.

This was really good. I removed the yolk from half the eggs to keep things lighter. I didn't have green onions, so I used red onion. I also added lime juice and cilantro.

This was such a good alternative to mayo!!! Only thing I changed was I used brown mustard for a little spice and mixed in with it just a dash of natural honey. Unbelievable egg salad!

Good alternative to mayo base. A bit under seasoned for my taste and I will add some red onion and a dash of Tabasco next time. Remember this won't keep on account of the avocado turning brown so plan to eat it all the same day.

I was very excited when I found this recipe. Two of my favorite things, eggs and avocado. However was let down cause the avocado turned brown, which wasn't very appealing. Needless to say its off my favorite list.

I love this recipe. it's a great healthy change to an age-old classic that I avoided for many years BC of all the Mayo. I did the version with a whole avocado, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, tobacco sauce and onion powder.  Also, I found that raisons are a wonderful addition... may sound odd but it adds something really special.

Awesome lunch sandwich! I made it using pre-boiled eggs just to make prep easier and used a whole avocado and more mustard to make the consistency better and add some flavor. Didn't have the paprika or salt/pepper, but it still tasted good - just like a normal egg salad, but less calories. I will definitely make again!

OMG, I couldn't believe how good and easy this was - I don't think I will ever make egg salad the old fashioned way again.  I made a single serving version of this recipe and started by boiling 2 eggs the night before and refrigerate them overnight, so I wouldn't have to waste time with this the next day.  Along with my 2 eggs, I used a little more than half of a medium sized avocado, some stone ground Dijon mustard and because I like a little kick I substituted Cayenne for the Paprika.  This made a lot of food and kept me full for quite some time.  A definite keeper I will come back to many times for sure.

I love egg salad, but was looking for  a bit of a lighter way to make it w/out mayo.  This avocado egg salad was delicious! I may try adding some celery to it next time for a little crunch, but the recipe on it's own was great.  I thought may be 1/2 and avocado may not be enough, but after making it, I found it to be just right.

I don't eat egg salad but my husband does and liked it.  I left out the optional onion and used a whole avocado.  I covered the leftovers with plastic wrap and the avocado did turn brown the next day from air exposure but he said it still tasted fine.

This is really good! I doubled the avocado as others suggested and doubled the mustard for a bit more flavor, and it was perfect for me. It's great for a packed lunch, it shouldn't brown in that short amount of time. I served this in pita halves with chopped tomatoes. Yum!

Haven't been a huge fan of avocados. Came across this while looking for other recipes and decided to try it for my wife ( she loooves avocados). Used four eggs and a wholly avocado mini tub. I actually liked it.

I used a whole avocado and it was still no where creamy enough.  Still had to use a BUNCH of mayo and the avocado turned an unappealing shade of black/green as it oxidized in the salad.

i had to make a few alterations due to lack of supply. I used 6 eggs and a whole avocado. It was enough for about 5 sandwiches. My only issue with this recipe is that its bland. I had to add salt and pepper but in the end it turned out fine!

Great recipe, if eaten immediately.  I like egg salad the second day and the avocados of course turned brown.  Still tastes delicious on a sandwich though!

Love this.  Added a dash of lemon juice (I was afraid the avacado would darken.  Also I was out of pepper so added a little montreal steak seasoning.  Still was excellant.  Will try the salt and pepper next time.  I agree with on of the other reviewers.  i am going to try this with tuna.

I used Dijon mustard and added capers and a little fresh lime juice.  Loved it! If I were serving it to guests, I'd add some parsley, just for appearance enhancement.

We are not egg salad fans, but I was hopeful when I saw all the positive reviews.  I made this exactly as directed, and included the optional green onions.  I don't know what's wrong with our tastebuds, but we found this to be quite bland.  Many of the reviewers raved about the great flavor of avocados:  I used Hass avocados, and non of us thought they had much flavor.  I do like the idea of subbing avocado for mayo though, so I may try again with some additional spices or other stuff added.

I made this for dinner last night and it was very good and didn't take a lot of time to make.  Chilled it for about 30 minutes which made it better.

Seriously amazing! I did 5 eggs and one whole avocado. There was enough for 4 big sandwiches but my bf and I ate it up in one sitting. Probably makes it less healthy when you eat two servings in one sitting but oh well. :-) I will definitely make this again!

What a great idea!  I liked this better than egg salad with mayo.  Each time I make it I use what I have on hand. What a tasty, versatile recipe this is! Thanks so much for sharing it, K-Dub!

I never in a million years would have thought to do this with avocado. We love avocados here, so when I saw this, I had to try it. I only used six large eggs and it was perfect. Also, I used a spicy brown mustard instead of yellow. The kids and I absolutely LOVED this!! I'll probably never use mayo in egg salad ever again now.

This recipe makes a fabulous egg salad.  I love that it has no mayonnaise, so it’s healthier and perfect for taking to the beach.  I used extra avocado, only because I love it, and followed the rest of the recipe as stated.  This is a keeper.
