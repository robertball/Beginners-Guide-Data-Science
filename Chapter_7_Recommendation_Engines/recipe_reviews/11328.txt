Great treat as is but to make them into super energy healthy balls, you can add things like sesame seeds, poppy seeds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, wheat germ, raisins, unsweetened coconut etc. directly to the mix (just add more peanut butter if it is too dry). I prefer roasting my coconut first (place coconut in oven on cookie sheet on broil until golden, give it a stir and broil a tad longer, but watch it closely), it just makes it that much better! You can also replace powdered milk with protein powder. I love rolling them in icing sugar.

Very tasty and quick to make!  I use my little 'scoop' from Pampered Chef to make the balls.  They are flat on one side and sit nicely in a container.  We actually store ours in the freezer.  Awesome little protein treat for the summertime!

These yummy little balls will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth! I added 3/4 C coconut to the mixture before rolling them into balls. Mmmmm.

Ok so I used this as a concept because I needed something to make to use to dip into chocolate fondue and didn't have time to go to the store. Instead of dry milk powder I used 1 packet swiss miss hot cocoa and 1/2 cup graham crackers and omitted the honey. I froze the balls and then took them out right before we dipped them. Yum!

I thought the cocoa powder ones were a little bitter.  I sprinkled them with sugar too. I also tried crushed heath bars, which were good.  Very easy, but remember to have your stuff out to roll before you make the balls.

Finally a recipe with the name peanut butter balls thats the real thing. I lost my recipe box at Christmas a couple years ago and needed to check the proportions on this recipe before I made them again. Wheat germ and coconut are definitely the things we rolled them in back in the 80's when I was a kid. They are great frozen as well.  If freezing make them a bit bigger and server before solid throughout. Chunky peanut butter adds texture as well. Love them.

my daughter and I made these treats, and we rolled them in wheat germ, coconut, and mini m&ms.  They were alot of fun, a little messy, but fun and they tasted good too.

Excellent. Went right down into my belly and stayed there for several weeks. The same fine dining experience I remember from childhood. Did recipe as shown, and with 1/2 cup of graham cracker crumbs. Both are excellent, but I think it's even better with the graham crackers mixed in.

I haven't tried this version.  The one I came across was 1 cup peanut butter, 1 cup honey, & 2 cups powdered milk.  I found that they form & keep better using 2 1/2 cups powdered milk with the 1 cup honey & the 1 cup of peanut butter.  I used a leveled measuring tablespoon spoonful to form uniform balls.  Makes 35 balls.  My growing boys love 'em.  They are nutritious enuf the way they are.  
Some users added wheat germ... wheat germ packs in a LOT of extra calories... google wheat germ... if your child doesn't need a big calorie boost, leave it out... PB&J sammies with a glass of milk are nutrious enuf the way they are... I grew up eating PB&J sammies without adding anything else... tho, we did eat them on whole wheat bread... honey, peanut butter, & milk are good for children once in a while.  If it's a snack, it doesn't have to have as many or more calories than a lunch or a meal...
*I store them at room temp in a covered container with aluminum foil (or could use wax paper) between the layers of balls.  They'll keep well for a couple weeks so you can make a double batch at once, if desired.

Our whole family really likes these.  We like them as is, without rolling them in anything, but sometimes I'll mix in chocolate chips.  Also, I don't use as much honey as it calls for, I just add it until it's just sweet enough.  An easy and yummy treat.

Maybe it's because I wasn't raised on these like some reviewers said, but the gritty texture was hard for me to get past.  I definitely had to roll them in something to eat one.  I think they would be better if you actually mixed in coconut or cereal instead of just rolling them in it.  I couldn't eat the rest of mine as they were, so I let the balls soften and put one between two Ritz crackers.  They were okay as a filling.  My nephew is 5, and he liked them.

These are the first peanut butter balls I've ever made. Very easy to make. I didn't have milk powder so I used 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 1/2 whey protein powder. Definitely a keeper!

I remember making these when I was in elementary school.  (a recipe my mom would let me do myself)  They are amazingly tasty for so few ingredients and such simplicity.  When I was young, we didn't roll them in anything (or just in more milk powder if they were too sticky).  I'm excited to try them with different coatings.

Super easy! Made a double batch for a bake sale and they were a big hit.   Not very sweet, truly have a peanut butter taste to them. I followed the recipe and rolled them in powdered sugar. Delightful!

I love this recipe.  I ended up substituting the dry milk powder with protein powder for a protein kick.  These are awesome out of the freezer, too!!  Watch out...they're addictive!

Yum! the only change I made was to use 1/2 cup dry milk and 1/2 cup wheat germ. It mixed together easily. I rolled half in coconut flakes and half in crushed graham crackers. (just wet my hands with water first) My kids liked them for their afternoon snack - thanks!

Mmm,yum! I needed something sweet and fast. I used chocolate protein powder in place of the milk powder. Then rolled in nuts and chocolate chips.

EXACTLY like I used to make with my mom when I was a little girl...LOVE the fact you can basically roll them in anything yummy! Such an easy recipe...can't wait to share this non-baking activity with my kids. I took slivered almonds and ground them in my coffee grinder to make an almond powder and rolled them in that...what a great way to sneak in a little more protein...my kiddos who seem to love carbs carbs and more carbs! ;)

I couldn't resist this recipe--only 3 ingredients?! No cooking? These are great little treats, and mostly healthy. They get five stars for ease and texture. I rolled them in Nesquik, and I thought it complimented them nicely--cocoa would probably be too rich. If you are working in a hot kitchen, you might want to chill the mixture before rolling it. These would be fun to serve at a party.

These are the bomb! SO easy and they taste crazy good. I melted some milk chocolate bars in a double broiler and stuck two toothpicks each into the balls and coated them with the chocolate. Then I put them on a parchment covered cookie sheet and refridgerated. Perfect little snack that appease the sweet tooth without overdoing it. I love these!

Just made these for my husband who thinks peanut butter is a food group. 30 minutes from start to finish. Added wheat germ as suggested. Rolled marble size balls in equal parts cocoa and powdered sugar. Super yum and super easy! Thanks for sharing Marbalet.

Wonderful!! My kids ate them all gone and I didn't have to feel guilty about too much sugar. They love the crunchy texture that melts in your mouth. Next time I will dip them in chocolate and try it that way.

I was looking for something quick to make and these fit the bill!  They were delicious!!  Thank you to the reviewer who mentioned using Nesquick powder instead of dry milk. I will be substituting every time I make these.  So for me they are chocolate peanut butter balls. Yum!!

These were weird. I did 1/4 of the recipe to try it out and got 22 marble sized peanut butter balls, as suggested. The powdered milk, I had, has a slight crumbly texture which made the texture of these not as smooth as a typical peanut butter ball. I thought these would be an interesting take on a peanut butter ball with the powdered milk and honey, instead of graham crackers and powdered sugar, but it just didn't work for me. Something about one of the flavors also left an odd taste in my mouth.

Talk about addicting!! I have no kids - I made this for my husband and me! So fast to make and cutting the recipe down in half or more is so big deal. Perfect for a quick sweet tooth fix. We stirred in some chocolate chips and it was perfect! Heck, the second batch I didn't even bother to roll or put in the fridge - i ate it right out the bowl!

This is a great recipe to make with kids.  Not only can they help add and mix in the ingredients but it's especially fun having them form the balls and roll them into other ingredients.  We add rice krispies to the mixture (adds a nice crunch) and roll the balls in oats.  YUM.

Awesome find! I have been craving these for over 15 years now and finally had the presence of mind to look up the recipe. After reviewing all the other "so-called" peanut butter ball recipies this is by far the best and original!

We love these.  I used to make them with my grandmother, who mixed in raisins, rolled it all into a log, chilled it, and then sliced it.  I make them with my children now, and we add 1/2 cup Uncle Sam cereal (rolled wheat flakes and flax seeds).  These can also be patted out between two sheets of parchment and cut with cookie cutters into fun shapes.

Perfect, I did have to put the mixture in the fridge for 20 mins as I had warmed up my honey a tad. After that it rolled perfectly and were a hit in the house! (we liked them plain the best)

Totally delicious!  My 13 year old who has shunned PB balls in the past said: For some reason, these taste really good!  I used raw local honey, organic PB w/ no sugar in it and organic non-fat dried milk.  If you really want to put this recipe over the top, add chocolate chips :)

I've been making these rolled in graham crackers crumbs and sometimes rice crispies.  The best thing is that even thought they are a sweet treat you are still getting lots of protien and calcium.

Wonderful taste & very quick to make.  I used crunchy peanut butter, and I think that just made them that much better.  Although the mixture did seem sticky when I mixed it together, I dropped the peanut butter mixture by spoonfuls (one at a time) into a coating of graham cracker crumbs, and a bit of cocoa powder and powdered sugar.  Not only were they easier to roll into balls using this method, but they tasted great!
