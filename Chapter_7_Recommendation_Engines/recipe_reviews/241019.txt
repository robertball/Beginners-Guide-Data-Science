I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk in place of the soy milk, but cut it down to 2/3 cup. I also froze the banana before using. I added a half scoop of vanilla protein powder as well as a couple tablespoons of almond butter. This is probably the tastiest smoothie I have ever had; I could not even taste the spinach. Thanks for a fantastic base recipe that can easily be modified according to your tastes!

This is very tasty and a good base recipe.  I had vanilla almond milk with a touch of honey so I used that.  I also had a golden delicious apple to use up and used just a tsp of natural peanut butter.  My banana was still a tiny bit green so the banana flavor isn't very strong.  I taste NO spinach whatsoever!  Every other flavor is represented subtly and it's a wonderful flavor!  
I was alittle worried because I just have a regular $10 blender that it wouldn't get the pieces small enough to drink but it worked fine.  I can't afford a magic bullet or vitamix so I'm glad to know I can still enjoy a smoothie without it!

Perfect smoothie to get my morning going. I did as the reviewer suggested and subbed almond milk. I always have bananas in my freezer, so I used a frozen one which made the smoothie icy cold. I'm totally off sugar, so the banana made this smoothie plenty sweet for me.

Strong banana flavour and quite sweet. I prefer Breakfast Banana Green Smoothie. 
Others have suggested to use blueberries or canned pineapple for a different flavour.

I used milk.

It comes out great every time. Thanks for sharing! The first time I used unsweetened almond milk, perfect. The second time I didn't have soy milk on hand so I used two percent. You just can't go wrong with this one!

Wow—this was amazing and uses ingredients I almost always have on hand. What a great way to get extra veggies in. I now make this several times a week so keep frozen strawberries and blueberries on hand...plus old bananas and bags of fresh spinach in the freezer to make the smoothies cold without adding ice. I only use 1/4-1/5 banana to add a touch of sweetness without lots of carbs. And I add 1 TB of a healthy seed mix (chia/flax/hemp) to make it extra filling and add protein, fiber and iron. I use soy milk and two big handfuls of spinach. Thanks for the basic recipe—it’s a winner!

This was a very simple smoothie to make and probably good for a newbie in the smoothie department. This was my very first smoothie and I liked it. I would probably add sugar next time (optional suggestion)

Refreshing and delicious. I thought I might had to add some honey or some kind of sugar but it wasn't needed the banana is sweet enough. I used coconut milk just because I like the flavor and added some cubes of ice. I enjoyed this drink a lot.

I did not need additional sweetener in this smoothie since I wait until my bananas are very ripe before freezing them.  The end results were good, sweet, creamy and if I had not made it I would have thought it was just a banana smoothie.

It was a great way to get spinach into my diet. Even gave my banana loving 10 year old nephew a test he really enjoyed it! Banana was ripe frozen for about 1 hour before making. I did add about 1 tsp of honey. Super quick, easy, fresh and healthy all winners! Will try with other fruit combinations!

This base recipe is very good by itself, but it can be modified in many nutritious ways. I add a serving of chocolate whey isolate protein powder to keep from getting hungry before lunch and a mix of chia, hemp and flax seeds for fiber and additional nutrition (Omega 3s, etc.). It is a great way to start the morning!

Yum! The porportions are perfect. I swapped soy for almond milk and added a little honey since the bananas were not as ripe/sweet.

Super delicious, and a lot better tasting than I thought it would. I added 2 scoops of whey chocolate protein to it with the frozen banana, spinach, and a substitute of almond milk. Definitely sticking to this formula from now on, great way to meet my protein and fiber goal for the day!

It was okay, but there wasn't really much flavor to it. Probably won't make it again since there are other spinach and banana recipes out there.

Very good.  I made this when trying to figure out what to eat for breakfast.  I did use 2% milk and added about 1 TBS of peanut butter and some Chi Seeds.  Since I work from home this is a very easy and fast breakfast to make.  Will for sure make on a regular basis.

It was amazing. I finished it in around 4 minutes, and I couldn't even taste the spinach. It tastes WONDERFUL. I am definitely making this again.

I tried the peanut butter addition mentioned in the reviews too. Also good.

I slice a banana and put it in the freezer.  Once frozen, add 2 hands full  of spinach and a cup of vanilla soy milk.  Yummy and cold for a summer treat.

Very tasty as is. Very strong banana flavour, which is great if you like bananas. For a slight flavour twist I added a few slices of canned pineapple. I love that this can be easily modified to suit your own taste.
