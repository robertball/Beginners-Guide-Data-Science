The dressing is marvelous, and easy. The salad is also easy, and together with the dressing adds a zesty touch of class to any meal.

I made this for a family dinner and it went over great. The dressing was a bit sweet for a one person (that would be my husband), but everyone else gave it rave reviews. I used a Granny Smith apple (coated in lemon juice so it wouldn't brown), green leaf lettuce, and shredded cheese instead of cubed. Very easy...I'll certainly make this again.

Awesome!  The dressing is the best part.  I made the dressing the night before and it did not even separate.  I will definitely make it again.

This salad is great, but the best part is the dressing.  I substituted almonds and colby-jack cheese, which went great with the apple.  The dressing was so good that every single friend asked for the recipe.  I made the dressing in my blender, and the second time I wasn't as patient and put the oil in too fast.  Unfortunately, it kept separating and was un-servable.  So make sure you go slow to let it blend completely. My husband doesn't like the flavor of celery so I left the celery seed out for him, but I think it tastes better with the exact recipe.  This dressing always gets eaten first while my Newman's Own just sits on its sad little shelf.

Delicious! I love sweeter salads and found this one on par with my taste preferences. I followed a suggestion to add the oil slowly and the dressing combined nicely. Thanks--great alternative to craisens/white cheese/walnuts/green apple salad.

I'm not to sure about this salad. I think I like it but I'm not quight sure. I will need to make this recipe again. One thing to remember - PUT THE DRESSING ON THE SIDE. The dressing made the salad very soggy very quickly.

I love this salad.  The dressing is just perfect with the ingredients.  To make this salad a complete meal I add diced chicken (nuggets if you're strapped for time) and it is very satisfying.  My husband says he could eat this over and over!

Thought this was wonderful tasting, hearty, and beautiful.  The dressing is wonderful also, though I thought it could have used slightly more tang. I will make this again, definitely.

I served this last night and every single one of my guests went nuts over it. I barely got a serving myself, lol! I didn't use all the dressing, just tossed enough in till it looked right for my taste. I ended up sending the rest of the dressing home with one my friends who reacted as though I just gave her a Christmas gift.

Who doesn't love apple, cheese, and honey? This is a great salad, and as others have said the dressing is the best part.  I love that it doesn't separate.  I'm going to try using the dressing on some other recipies and see how they turn out!

Three out of the four people at dinner liked the dressing (including my toddler), everyone liked the salad. It's a nice, easy way to dress up a salad. I used shredded chedder since that was what I had on hand, and omitted the onion from the dressing.

We both really liked this one.  I cut back on the honey as I didn't think my husband would like it if it was too sweet.  For myself, the full amount would probably be fine.

I found that this dressing tasted too much like oil and wasn't as flavourful as other reviewers commented.  I did enjoy the apple, cheddar and honey mixture

A beautiful alchemy of a salad. I suggest high quality sharp cheddar cubed small and Gala organic apples.

This was really good. Somehow my dressing was too thick and sweet, but I added more vinegar - it turned out great and also didn't separate before serving. Some sliced radishes on the top of the salad added a bit of color.

Made recipe without any changes twice now. Once for my family(had to test before serving at a party lol) and second for a party. Everyone raved about it and several people requested the recipe. I loved it. Awesome recipe.

This salad was very tasty.  I substituted pecans for the walnuts and it turned out great.  When I make it again, I will use less celery seed (the flavor was somewhat overpowering) and I will serve the dressing on the side.

This was so tasty! My husband liked it better than most of the other "fruity" salads I've made. (The exception being "Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad" from this site--that one has even converted my 70 year old father into requesting cranberries anytime a salad is served!) I used pecans in place of walnuts, was out of walnuts. I like them both equally so I'm sure it didn't affect things one way or the other. I didn't have celery seed, but only celery salt, so I used that and omitted the table salt listing. I shredded my cheese too, and would only ever do that--high-quality Cheddar has too much bite to go eating it chunk-style in a salad, (especially if you aren't expecting it!) Thanks for the recipe, we'll have this one again :)

My extended fam asks for this salad every holiday.  It's all I ever get to make for family gatherings anymore.  :(  The trick to the dressing is a food processor:  combine everything, scrape down the bowl, let rest and process again.  Repeat a few times to ensure that dressing will not separate as it sits.

This was a nice, simple salad, but the dressing as written would have been waaaay too sweet for my taste--and too much. I used half the dressing (with olive oil), which was just right, and less than half the honey, and I still thought it was too sweet. It blended fine with the salad (to which I added salt and more cheese to balance the sweetness), but the dressing by itself just tasted like honey to me--pretty bland for all the ingredients that went into it. Next time, I'll double the spices, vinegar, and lemon.

I LOVE this base salad.  I will admit that I haven't made the dressing yet because I don't have any cider vinegar on hand, but I wanted to post a review anyways.  I added avocado and used a red wine spritzer (1 calorie per spray) by Wishbone.  This was a perfect and filling lunch.  Will make the recipe as described next time.

Hubby doesn't like salads so I always look for ways to dress it up.  He liked this one.  Only thing did differently was didn't add onions to dressing - hubby doesn't like them.  Kept dressing on the side.  Very good - will make again.

This was really yummy. Made it for my book club and someone even requested the recipe. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the dressing is really, really, REALLY thick! I added a fair amount more of the vinegar to both thin it and give it the kick I felt it needed. I would, however, recommend making it as is to see how you like it before you modify it. It does have a lovely, subtle flavor as is.

My sister and her family are vegetarians and I made this for a family function. They loved it and my sister asked for the recipe. My niece even commented on how pretty it looked. I will be making this a lot. It's a huge change from just the ordinary tossed salad.

The salad part was very good, but my husband and I agreed that the dressing was too thick and overpowering.  I even made it twice, thinking I had done something wrong.  Unfortunately, I didn't think it did anything to enhance the ingrediants in the salad itself.

This was very good. I was a little leery because the ingredients sound a little unorthodox, but everyone loved it!  It will definitely go in my "keeper" binder!

The dressing was the best.  I made it the night before I served it and it turned out great.

Phenomenal.  Didn't change a thing.  Delicious with chicken or turkey tossed in.

I enjoyed the combination of lettuce, apples, cheese and walnuts; it was a nice change.  However,I didn't care for the dressing at all and ended up using a botted dressing from Trader Joes that I felt was a nice compliment.  Will definitely not make the dressing again.

This is a great salad. Try it and add Jicama and a white cheddar. Gives it even more appeal.

I was just not impressed with this salad.  I wonder if I would have liked the dressing better if I would have used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also didn't find the cheddar cheese to add much flavor to the salad.  Maybe next time I will try feta.  My all time favorite salad on this site is Strawberry Spinach Salad I, so I think I am holding everything else up to these high standards.

This was a wonderfully easy salad with a great flavor combination.  I made a smaller salad, so we'll get to enjoy the dressing once again!
