I was optimistic but alas, I, as well, have two flat pancakes. Made this recipe exactly as instructed.

This was good and easy. I used a blender to mix all things even the dry ingredients. Maybe thats why it was a bit too dense. I may be wrong though.

I'm going to have to give this one another try.  I gave it four stars simply because I did find it a bit dry.  However, I will admit that I used a larger pan.  I did adjust cooking time to accommodate for this, but still was a bit dry.  I do feel though that this is a recipe worth another try

Ours fell. No idea why, really, but my wife says that she has NEVER had a cake fall since she started making them at age 5.
It tasted good, though, and I whipped the cream the British way without extra sugar or vanilla.

It’s not as thick as i expected. But then it only uses 1 1/4 C flour, so it’s more suited to tea.  I substitute almond flavoring ( homemade,) for vanilla in the cake. Used vanilla (also homemade,) in the buttercream. I usually use sweetened whipped cream and raspberry preserves for the filling. The buttercream is nice, too.

I ended up with two flat discs despite following the recipe exactly.  we put glaze on them and called them delicious cookies, but this is not sponge cake.

Delicious! Very easy to make and super tasty. I did not have 8 inch pans, so I had to use 9 inch, so mine wasn't as high as it should've been (I also had to reduce the cooking time a bit). I did double the buttercream b/c we love it.  Really great cake that I will def be making again~YUM! thanks for sharing. :)
