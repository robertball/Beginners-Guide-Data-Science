I made this for my husband and I prepared it the night before. I used the butter generously, minced garlic, and lemon slices. I put in a dish with instructions to cook on 450 for 10-20 minutes. He loved it! this was a great quick recipe that I will keep.

Oh man, okay I won't press done expecting it to make a space. I used olive oil instead of butter, and added dried dill seasoning which added a mild but tasty flavor. Served on a cold mixed green salad with purple olives, cherry tomatoes, grilled red beets, hearts of Palm, artichoke, shredded carrots, kidney beans and white quinoa. We also used a miso-ginger vinaigrette. Such a delicious salad will definitely be making this with the salmon for years to come!

At this temperature, the butter and water will spatter and pop ALL over the inside of your oven.  At the 8 minute mark it was popping butter into the roof of my oven causing it to start smoking.  I had to rush to get it out of the oven as the smoke started pouring out into the kitchen and set off my smoke alarm and terrified my dogs.  My Pyrex dish was on the bottom oven rack and I have a huge cleanup job to do.   I was able to salvage the almot by pan frying to finish it.   DO NOT follow the baking instructions as is.  WARNING.

Basically this is a poached salmon---yummy as a main dish, but I bet it's even better cooled on a salad.  I used all the ingredients but in smaller proportions.  I skinned the bottom of my salmon so that the butter/garlic on the bottom of the dish could seep into the salmon from that side.  I thought that the amount of water/lemon juice may have been a little too much because I didn't even use all of that.  I will try it again without even using the water but just the butter, garlic, and lemon juice.  I was afraid of the high heat with my dish, so I did only cook it at 425 but a little longer.  I kept thinking of capers with this, but then that's a whole different dish!  This was very good, so thanks, Jim M!

Best home salmon recipe I have used.  The cooking time is great, the salmon is moist.  The seasoning causes great mixture of taste and excellent to put on the rice.
I shall do this again.

this is a great base recipe! however it called for way too much butter. instead I just used a smear of butter for under the fish, added the garlic as it listed, and only used 1/4 cup of butter for the mixture over the top. then added some broccoli to the side and it's great!

Hubby finished the salmon and came over to me and said "That was really really good salmon- didnt even eat it with any tarter sauce"
For him that was HUGE! The man normally eats 5 parts tarter to 1 part fish. He loves fish, he just loves tarter sauce more. 
So for him to love the salmon and not eat it with tarter sauce is proof positive its the best salmon he's had!

Great flavor. I followed instructions and it turned out delicious. I served it with wild rice, green beans and avocado slices on the side. Definitely a keeper.

Turned out delicious! I had to modify it a little. First, I subbed some rose wine I had on hand for the water (great addition- would definitely recommend subbing white or rose wine ). Second, I used an oven-safe stovetop pan instead of a baking dish, but I wasn’t sure if it could tolerate temperatures as high as 450 degrees. I cooked it at 400. After 10 minutes, I added the other half of the butter-garlic mixture and the other half of the wine-lemon mixture. Then cooked it for another 15 minutes. That seemed to work well.  Served with rice and broccoli and it was great!

It's a 10! The one thing I did differently after reading the reviews was to make aluminum foil packets. Cover your baking pan with foil first, then make a long foil page of foil - both north & south AND east & west  pieces - you'll be glad. I put some melted butter on the foil, then the fish. I wouldn't use the water next time, or just a little...but I am a lemon girl so I'd use more. Plus some dried dill. It was divine! I had mine with salad on the same plate and it made a great togetherness. Yum~
