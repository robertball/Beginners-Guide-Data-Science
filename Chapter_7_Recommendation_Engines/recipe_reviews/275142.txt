This risotto is amazing!! And so super easy. Unlike traditional risottos that need constant babysitting, this one allows you to walk away. It's delicious. Def making this one again & again! Think I may add fresh asparagus along w/the corn next time!

This recipe was very delicious and makes a lot for a side dish! I made the recipe exactly as written and the texture of the risotto is perfect. It is such a time saver to make using the Instant Pot. My ears of corn were on the small side and I probably should have used at least an extra ear or two (maybe 2-3 cups fresh corn kernels total), but the end result was still amazing! So good that my husband declared he would gladly take extra to work for lunch today. My only reason for rating 4 stars is that it seemed like I had a little too much liquid even after stirring everything together. I just let it sit a bit on keep warm and stirred every so often and the rice seemed to absorb the liquid. Next time, I will reduce the amount of broth to use by 1/2 - 1 cup (3 - 3.5 cups broth total perhaps). Thanks for the recipe! I can't wait to make risotto again in the Instant Pot!
