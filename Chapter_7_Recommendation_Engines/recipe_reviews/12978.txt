Call me crazy but collard greens work better than spinach with this recipe.  This was GREAT.  My husband's parents are from Liberia and they are big fans.

It's a very nice soup if you're entertaining a number of people.  It's unique, filled with all kinds of good stuff and very, very, very rich.  It almost has a "bisque" quality to it, but "nutty" as well.

I used fresh crab, which made it tiring to make -- and as careful as we were in taking the meat out of the shell, we still found shell bits in our soup.

My mistake was trying to eat the entire recipe over the course of a number of consecutive days.  It's way too rich to try to eat it that way.  Again, highly recommended to give to people as a one course appetizer at a party.

The recipe itself was good.  HOWEVER, it's not authentic.  My husband is from Cameroon, Africa...so I wanted to make this one night as a surprise for him...and he didn't even recognize what it was.  I asked my sister-in-law over the following weekend to show me how to make real egusi soup...and it's NOTHING like this recipe.

The spinach can be replaced by any type of green leafy vegetable, we especially liked this soup using shredded cabbage.

The use of pumkin seeds can be a useful substitute if Melon Seeds are not available, enabling an approximation of the flavour of this dish.

Delicious.  I cut the on-line recipe in half and it worked just as well.  I also used chicken stock in lieu of water.

I think this was a great basic recipe but I had to make a few changes.  First, I cut the tomato sauce completely because I didn't want such a strong tomato taste.  It's very important to grind the pumpkin seeds down VERY VERY fine, or else it will have a weird grainy texture.  I added a beef bouillon cube to the pot, along with dried shrimp (If I had dried fish, I would have added that too).  I also added a little bit of garlic salt, onion powder, and Italian seasoning.  I also let the soup cook down for about 40 mins, and then I added more peanut oil to dry up the water.  When it was finished I served over white rice. All and all I'd have to say that this recipe did the trick.

Egusi Soup is the bomb; I make it without seafood and add fresh ginger in the blender with the habanero peppers and garlic; I tenderize my onion and add my sauce, then simmer my sauce until thick, then add my precook meat, ginger and garlic to sauce and serve with FuFu or rice and my friends beg for more; it is truly a great dish

Good recipe. I am vegetarian so I used morningstar crumbles instead of meat and seafood. Cooking time is drastically reduced. If you use this method, you will want to put the crumbles in after the sauce and heat no more than 10 minutes.  Also, I chopped the spinach in a food processor and I used olive oil instead of peanut oil.     Yummy

This is an interesting recipe. When I made it, it tasted noting like what my mom makes. The pumpkin seeds taste completely different from the actual egusi seed. I used palm oil instead of peanut oil and chicken instead of shrimp.

But as always, the plantain puts a perfect touch =)

I loved this dish. I made it as written and made no changes. I was able to find the Equsi seeds at my local Africian store. My 9 year old enjoyed it also she ate 2 bowls served over rice. This is a keeper.

I did not like whole pumkin seeds in the soup when I made it the first time. I made changes to this recipe when I made it the second time by grinding the pumpkin seeds in a blender by itself with a little bit of water and one egg.  I cooked the seeds separatly and then added it to the soup as the last step after the spinach cooked down.  Speaking of spinach I found that the raw spinach is headache and time consuming. I used frozen chopped spinach and it was a great turn out.

Very good!  I lightened the soup up a little (less oil and meat) and it made for a great, spicy soup.  Would definitely make it again!

Absolutely fantastic.  I used mixed shellfish (prawns, scallops, mussels) and it was great.  The pumpkin seed really adds something different to the texture.

I really enjoyed this soup. My friend is from Nigeria and suggested I add ground crayfish. It was so delicious. My daughter made foo foo to go with it but I opted for a tossed salad as this soup is so filling.. So easy and not too many ingredients. Will definitely make it again.

I have a Nigerian friend who wanted me to make this for him.  Needless to say, I was nervous, because he had the REAL THING!  Not to worry, though... he said it was awesome!  I put tripe in it instead of beef - slow-cooked the tripe for four hours on high.  I put a little sriracha sauce in it to add a little kick...

I made this for a soup dinner for a group of 14 people. I served 4 different types of soup and guests were invited to try all 4. This was extremely popular and left over soup went home in containers with several guests.

I alter mine a little bit as I am allergic to peanuts.  I mainly use chicken when I make egusi and even my stepkids love it.   This dish is a great introduction to Nigerain food.

I found this recipe through Allrecipe's Kwanzaa recommendations, and it was superb. My family had our "Karamu" early, and out of the 6 courses, this soup really stood out. I made a half recipe, and it easily served 6 people. I honestly wouldn't change a thing, delicious!
