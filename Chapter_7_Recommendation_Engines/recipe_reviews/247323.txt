I used a dried stalk of lemongrass instead of fresh as that is what I had on hand.  I also omitted the pepper.  I left it marinating for a few hours before grilling.  This didn't do it for us, though I enjoyed the method.  Slice your chicken a bit thicker instead of thinner - it'll stay on the skewer better.
