They tasted really good, and I hate beets. My husband almost threw up though, but he detests beets... I made him try it to set a good example for our 3 year old. Our 1 year old LOVES them!!! The longer you simmer them, the better they taste. I made them an hour ahead of time, and just warmed them up, and they were better than when I first cooked them. Nice recipe!

If you MUST eat beets,  this is the way to go.  It seems I went temporarily insane while at the grocery and picked up a can of beets.  But,  after desperately searching for a recipe that would make beets NOT taste like beets,  I found it! I went a little heavy on the apple. :) hehe

I loved this recipe. The color of the dish is so beautiful to compliment a holiday meal. The sauce thickens up nicely and the flavors are wonderful.

I enjoy beets but have never cooked them myself. I made this recipe and it turned out delicious. I threw in a handful of chopped walnuts and pecans at the end just to add some crunch and it tastes pretty great. I will definitely make this again.

This was a fun recipe to start with, I challenged myself to run w/ fresh beets but kept the concept beyond that all Michele's - very innovative and fresh -  I'd have never experimented w/ Beets and Apples had it not been for this post - Thanks Michele - you created a challenge for me w/o knowing it!!!     ~Jeff

This is great!  The beets I used were only in water and salt, so I added some extra cornstarch and sugar.  I also added a couple of dashes of red wine garlic vinegar.  It was great!

This was a tasty and innovative way to cook beets. I'm not generally a beet person, but I'm glad I tried this recipe.

I followed the recipe except I used fresh roasted beets. It was ok, but it mostly tasted like beets, not apple.

This recipe didn't have as much flavor as i thought it would. However, I did like the combo of apples and beets.

This was really good. It wasn't something that you could eat the whole thing, but it was a really interesting side dish to the ham. Relatively easy to make. I thought maybe it didn't present itself as well as I would have hoped - it turned out looking like a bunch of stewed beets (guess that's what it is, ut I was hoping for maybe more color).

Too much effort for too little taste.  It's a little sweeter than normal beets, but not the best thing I've ever had.

Needing to use up 3 large fresh beets, I tried this recipe and found it to be OK. I did change it up by boiling the beets first till almost soft then slicing them. I put them in a baking dish with one sliced granny smith apple, lemon juice and some brown sugar with a little salt. I covered the dish with tin foil and baked at 350 for about 40 minutes. The apple slices were disintegrated so baked too long, tho the beets were not overdone. The apple does compliment the beets very well and I liked how it came out. Next time I will add more apple and saute rather than bake.

This recipe was really good. We are not normally beet eaters, but for some reason today at the store my boyfriend picked up fresh beets, and tasked me with finding something to do with them... I was clueless. I boiled three fresh beets for about 45min. Instead of the juice from the can, I used the water I boiled them in. And I doubled everything in the recipe. And I may have also added even more brown sugar. But it was very good, even the 15yo liked it!!!

I'm not too much into lemon with my vegetables so I omitted it, but followed the recipe otherwise.  'Didn't taste too much different than straight from the can.  1t cornstarch wasn't enough to thicken.  Now that I'm thinking, it should be 1T since 2T thickens a cup.

Beets and apples go perfectly together.  This was good, but nothing to crow about.  Predictable and fine for everyday fare.

I used fresh beets because that's what I was looking to find a recipe for. I pre-cooked the beets. The cooking water is not very nice so I used vegetable stock which I had on hand instead of the beet liquid from the can. My husband doesn't really like beets, but he said that he likes them cooked like this.

I used fresh beets that I had steamed in an Instant Pot and the resulting juice, intead of canned beets. I used a Chelan apple because that is what I had. Not as sweet as Granny Smith but it still worked quite well. I loved this recipe and will make it again.

I really like this recipe!.. I used the beets from my garden not the canned beets the recipe recommended. I just cooked the cooked the beets about 30 minutes. I added all ingredients to the cooking beets about 20 minutes. The apples add a very good favorite!

Great way to add color to a meal and use up those cans of beets you bought for some reason. I followed the recipe and it turned out well, but next time might add other fruits/veggies, eg. carrots, pears, raisins, sweet onion.

I LOVED these! My hubby enjoyed and the kids actually ate them too.  I used 2 Tbsp of brown sugar since it was the kids first time having beets, and I didn't have a tart apple but used a Jonagold with great success.  Delicious!

Love this recipe, but I cooked fresh beets and cut them in cubes.  I made the sauce using the liquid from the cooked beets.  I added the beets at the end, so that I did not over cook them.
