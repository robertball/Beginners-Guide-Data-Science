I just cut the grapefruit in half and put the toppings on (that is what the original recipe calls for) because I find it easier to scoop out the flesh when it is warm and softer.

Simple and delicious! I usually just eat these things cold with a bit of Splenda, but this was really nice change. I just cut the grapefruit in half, cut it into sections and loosed it - didn't bother with anything else. I used Land O Lakes light butter and added a little nutmeg along with the cinnamon. Very easy and very good!

Again, my laziness prevails and I just loosen the sections with a knife but don't bother to remove the sections and all that.  I also skipped the butter - although Smart Balance or other non-hydrogenated spreads will work.  I just didn't feel that butter and grapefruit belonged together.  I used brown sugar and a little cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, and that made these smell and taste wonderful!  Reminded me of something served at a nice bed & breakfast in Maine.

A friend gifted us with a box of Texas grapefruit, and I needed to find a way to get my family to eat them all, so searched under "ingredients" for grapefruit.  (There's not much!)  I sectioned the grapefruit and left them in the skins.  3 minutes under the broiler was not enough to heat the grapefruit through, so the top was warm and the bottom was cold.  I would leave in the broiler a little longer next time.  Got rid of some grapefruit, though!

I just brought back 5 lbs. of fresh pink grapefruit from my parents tree in Florida and decided to try this recipe.  I keep my grapefruits at room temperature on my counter. After cutting out the grapefruit I cut another one and removed the fruit and placed in a bowl (1 1/2 grapefruits).  Next I took another small bowl and mixed the cinnamon and sugar together then drained the grapefruit (to drink) and ladled into ONE shell.  I was intrigued by the addition of the butter so I decided to try adding it.  The most time consuming part was tearing out the inside of the fruit so I used kitchen shears to make it easier and faster. If I were to make it again I would cut down on the cinnamon.  Frankly, it's just easier (and less time consuming) to cut and half sprinkle with sugar or slenda and cut the sections and eat!

I enjoyed this at work today.  I used a combination of 2tsp brown surgar and 1/2tsp white surgar and sprinkled with cinnamon and dotted with butter per half of grapefruit.

Had this for New Years morning, with a sweet bread from our favorite bakery and a slice of egg casserole.  So pretty!  I used honey instead of white sugar, and totally forgot the butter - didn't miss it.

I did what I always do to 'prepare' grapefruit - slice the sections and around the edge, without actually removing the fruit. I also used Smart Balance and Splenda, as my diet has been horrible this week. This was very light and refreshing. Thanks!

This is delicious.  I've never had a warm grapefruit before nor have I thought to put cinnamon on.  Usually I just cut it in half and sprinle a little sugar on and that's it.  Warming it makes it so much more juicy.  I don't think you need to scoop everything out unless serving to a child that may not be a able to get all the little segments out with a spoon.  I just cut around the segments and left it at that.  I will certainly make this again.  I really enjoyed the cinnamon on this.  Thanks

The kids rated this one since I can't stand grapefruit. I didn't cut up the grapefruit due to time. Did this before breakfast before school and work. But they loved it. It was very juicy. Next time I'll prep it the night before so all of the grapefruit can be covered in the sugar and cinnamon and have time to suck up the sweetness. And maybe then I'll like it.

Really yummy way to eat grapefruit!

I would say it's definitely easier to section the grapefruit beforehand (especially if you're making this for company), but taking the sections out and replacing them seems like a lot of unnecessary extra work!

I have a grapefruit tree and never seemed to finish off the fruit. I'm sure this won't be a problem anymore. I will definitely be adding this recipe to my breakfast food :) I did omit the butter as it wasn't really necessary. Grapefruit is good without it.

Very good and well worth the trouble!  I had had this once before at a brunch and was pleasantly surprised to see it here.  I omitted the butter and cooked them a bit longer per another review adn they were perfect!  Will definitely make this again.

I made this with honey and brown sugar. I baked it at 200c for 20 mins and then put it under the grill for 4 mins. It was very tasty! I love grapefruit and I love baked fruit but I had never thought of baking grapefruit- thanks for the inspiration. A fantastic way of using up grapefruit that has passed its best.

This was interesting to try but I didn't like the addition of the butter at all. Also mine was only warm on top. I think I like the old cold with sugar sprinkled on top better. Thanks!

I've never put butter on mine but I have been eating broiled grapefruit for years. This is my favorite way to make it. I just sprinkle it with the sugar cinnamon mix and put it under the broiler. This is the only way my granddaughters will eat it. Now that I take a Statin drug,it is a real treat for me because I only allow myself one a year.

ok seriously? I don't know if because I'm a sugar addict or this hcg /candida diet has me all in sugar withdrawal, but I tried this with liquid stevia both a few drops of plain and vanilla cream, added a drop of butter flavoring and lots of cinnamon. and oh my God, I was in heaven! You shoulda seen me licking the pan and sipping up the juice! wow- I will never look at grapefruit the same again! So yummy!

Boy this recipe takes me back - my mom would spoon apple juice concentrate over the grapefruit and broil it!  That was a delicious way to enjoy grapefruit.  I look forward to trying a new recipe to enjoy a fruit I love!

Thank you so much for sharing this!  Just for calories' sake, I used Splenda, and to keep my fat intake down, changed to just a little olive oil.  This was wonderful, so I can only imagine how good the butter and sugar would be.  I never would have thought of using cinnamon with grapefruit, either.

There's nothing better than a grapefruit. I love them!!!!!!! Broiling them is a great idea and it was really good, although I didn't go to all this trouble. I just cut in half and knived thru the skins. I didn't put the butter on it as I don't need the extra calories. Great idea! Thanks.

I used brown sugar instead of white, for a deeper sweetness. I liked this. Nice way to dress up your grapefruit into something different.

Yum, this is a great winter breakfast.  I wasn't sure I'd like the grapefruit with sugar & cinnamon, but it tastes great.  I did leave off the butter, though. Also, I just cut around the slices and left them in the shell.  Lastly, I cooked it a little longer so it's warm all the way through.  Healthy, a little sweet, warm & comforting.  Thanks!

Was not a big fan of this one. A lot of work for not much results. You are better off to cut the grapefruit and sprinkle sugar on top and eat. This recipe was too much of a hassle, sorry.

If you don't like grapefruit, you won't like this. I thought it might be enough to get my kids to have a few bites, but no. They didn't like it. The butter/grapefruit combo didn't do it for me either. 

A suggestion though. I'd skip the taking the grapefruit out of the rind part (just to put it back in again) and just cut in half, top with the ingredients. I still had to spend time getting the meat out with a spoon anyway.

Pretty good and extra simple ! Made a light and hot winter dessert of it rather than a breakfast thing. I used brown sugar. Next time I'll skip the butter or use far less.

It tasted great, but if I had used the recipe's method of slicing, removing, and replacing the flesh of the grapefruits, I would still be making it. 

Also, the halves overflowed onto the baking sheet and I had to remove them prematurely because I was wary of starting a fire.

This couldn't have been more simple! I didn't pre-cut and it turned out fine.  The house smells divine too! Good all year round and it makes for a very healthy snack.

My mother used to make this as a first course for a dinner.  She would add a cherry to the center.  Didn't bother to scoop out the rind though and no butter - just sugar & cinnamon.  Yummy.

Have been broiling grapefruit for years and love it.  This sounds like a better way than how I did it.  I always just used serated knife to section, sprinkled a little sugar and lots of cinnamon and broiled for a couple minutes.  Will do it this way in future and try adding a dab of butter.  Broiled graperuit is truly wonderful!

i use a similar recipe. i cut the grapefruit in half, cut the segments, spread a little honey on it followed by a sprinkle of cinnamon and broil. The honey is healthier than sugar and the flavour is wonderful. I first had this as a dessert in a authentic mexican restaurant. It was great after a spicy, heavy meal. It is also warming on a cold morning or as a bedtime snack.

I am 24 years old and have never eaten a grapefruit until the morning. I've been thinking about trying it for a while now and I found this recipe and decided it was time. I was always really afraid of the bitterness, but this was awesome. I did not pull everything out as this recipe indicated. I just cut around the sections and tried my best to push the sugar and cinnimon down into the cuts. I did not use butter and I broiled it a bit on the long side, the edges started to burn a bit. It was just fabulous. This may be a morning staple for me. I did not find that it took me any longer than toasting a bagel.

Nice rich flavor. This really mellowed the bite of the grapefruit. Not sure I liked it as well as plain grapefruit with just sugar, it was different eating warm grapefruit, but good. I might do this again for a nice change of pace. Definitely section them as directed before baking. Thanks for sharing, it was nice to have something different to change up my same ol breakfast!

When i prepared this recipe, i was sure it would be gross. I made it and amazing! Its along the lines of a baked apple. However, i recomend not using too much butter. I did use too much butter the second time i made it... It was terrible and it tasted like veggies! Besides that this recipe is GREAT!

This was a nice change of pace as a one-time novelty kind of side dish, but it's too time consuming to make again.  It has an interesting taste, reminiscent of spiced baked apples and was a nice change from the normal fare.

Great idea!
I love getting all the bitter pulp out of there!  BUT the grapefruit I used must have been a bit older . I didn't really like how buttery and sugary it is, either.  Grapefruit is supposed to be the healthy meal, maybe next time I'll just use a tiny bit of sugar and omit the butter altogether.

This recipe is easy and prep was about 5 minutes. I washed my grapefruit first and dried it well. Mighty yummy on a cold winter day. Since my grapefruit were at room temp originally, they heated through nicely. Will try this again without butter...and it probably won't taste as good.

I agree with others that removing the grapefruit wedges is unnecessary.  Just prepare the 1/2 grapefruit as you would normally then top with the butter, sugar, and spices. I added fresh nutmeg along with the cinnamon — very delicious.

I'm used to eating my grapefruit plain (room temp/no sugar) so using this recipe was an exercise in faith. Result is I quite enjoyed it but would use less cinnamon next time and I LOVE cinnamon.  I'd keep the other ingredients the same.  I don't think this will be something I prepare often - kind of a once-in-a-while thing.  I placed the grapefruit on a shelf below the normal broiler level, which  I think helped give a more even temperature throughout.  Using a grapefruit knife made separating the sections a breeze.

Great idea, but we're not rating ideas, right? As other reviewers have suggested, just section the grapefruit, top it with brown sugar and cinnamon, and then broil it for three to five minutes. Why add butter or go to the trouble and mess of scooping? Keep it simple, keep it fresh, and don't add extra steps.

We really enjoyed this!  Next time I will mix the sugar and cinnamon together before I put it on the grapefruit and I will leave it under the broiler long enough to make sure it's heated through. Delicious!

Tasted very good! Was very nice to eat warm grapefruit on a cold winter morning. My only problem was I cooked it in a new oven and the broiler is closer than my old oven. So I heard sizzling and looked and a grapefruit was stuck to the broiler! My cookie sheet had bent in the oven! I almost burned the house down!

Broiled Grapefruit Haiku: "Always eat mine cold, but this was a nice, new change. I'd do it again!" My MiL sends me boxes of Texas ruby-reds and I usually obliterate them just sliced around the perimeter and thru the segments w/ a sprinkle a Splenda. I just had so many this time around that I wanted a more dessert-ey feel - enter this recipe! I didn't spoon sections out into a bowl, only to put back in the rind - just loosened around the edges and wedges and topped (swapping white for brown sugar Splenda) and 5 min. was just perfect for a nice gooey brown top to emerge.

This wasn't bad ... I guess I'm just a lover of grapefruit in their natural (grin) state.  Most of the grapefruit you find nowadays is so sweet you really don't have to put sugar on top ... so I found this a tad too sicky=sweet for my liking.  Having said that, if it were a frigid snowy day (and not 102 degrees with 88% humidity), this would be a nice way to warm up your belly. -
