This was wonderful.I used a mixture of shredded cheese and then mixed the sauce up with my immersion blender. No need to heat it up as the heat from the cauliflower melted the shredded cheese. I used whole grain macaroni and popped this under the broiler to get top browned. I'll make this again

I made this as written, but without the nutritional yeast because I did not have any on hand.  I liked it, but my kids wouldn't touch it (not sure why, they had no idea it was cauliflower!) and my husband said it was just ok.  The flavor and texture are light, although not quite mac & cheese-like.  I don't think it was the recipe writer's intention to "hide" the vegetables, and if that is what you are looking for, I don't think this recipe will help you do that.  The flavor and texture of the sauce is not close enough.  However, if you like cauliflower and are looking for a lighter and healthier version of the classic recipe, this is a good one to try!

I was a little skeptical about this dish, especially since it was the first time using nutritional yeast.  It was amazingly delicious and is now permanently in my routine recipe stash.  I used a large clove of garlic, rather than the powder and italian bread crumbs since that's all I had.  Switched out the reduced-fat for some sharp cheddar and asiago, plus added a yellow onion.  Thanks for yummy gift!

Delicious! Did without mustard and made with gluten free pasta. Boyfriend who hates veggies had no idea there was cauliflower in it!

I followed the recipe almost  exactly, I just added a little sprinkle of extra cheese, and had high hopes. It was bland and I did not care for the yogurt. Removing it from my recipe box.

I love this idea.  While I did make changes (added salsa, reduced pasta and cheese, used sour cream instead of yogurt, used water instead of chicken broth, left out the nutmeg, bread crumbs, oil and yeast flakes) due to my own personal tastes, the recipe is great as written as well.

I followed the recipe as written, but found I needed a whole 16 oz box of pasta, instead of the 8 oz.  It has become a regular in my kitchen. Kids prefer it to the traditional mac n cheese.

I was skeptical when I had to blend the cauliflower, but it turned out perfectly proportioned and delicious. I also added chicken to the sauce for protein.

Delicious.  I prefer this to regular mac and cheese which seems bland in comparison to this.   I  mashed only half of the cauliflower and left the rest in small florets.  First time using the nutritional yeast, it was a good discovery.  Used regular cheddar, not reduced fat.  Have tried both and the reduced fat does not melt as well. Served with sweet hot mustard chicken thighs.   A good pairing.  Will try it with meat loaf.

This was great and no one could tell that there was cauliflower in it. Used some Mexican cheese and no yeast.

This is my go-to Mac and cheese recipe. Even guest/kids/relatives who are veggie averse have liked this recipe without knowing it’s full of good ingredients. I just toss everything except the pasta in the food processor with the steamed cauliflower and that melts and combines everything well. I leave out the chicken broth and olive oils bc I don’t think the added liquid is needed. Probably double the cheese and increase the spices by about half. It’s still comfort food but with a bit of added nutrition

I really liked this recipe.  I tweaked it to work with my dietary needs. But the flavor was good. I used whole wheat pasta and whole wheat bread crumbs. I used real cheddar instead of the lower fat version. Delicious. I will make this again for sure.

I think this was a good effort at a healthy mac n' cheese but the taste is VERY different from the traditional dish.  It has a distinct tang from the greek yogurt that was not popular with my family.

I am trying to find recipes that incorporate more veggies, but we didn't care for the at all.  It was very bland (and I even ended up doubling the cheese!)  Weird texture and taste.

Made it with half the cauliflower and no cayenne as I was hoping to ease my picky 5-year-old into eating it. He said he liked it, but didn't eat as much as he would of boxed mac & cheese. The yogurt sort of curdled, so it wasn't creamy at all, but I thought it was delicious.

If I make it again I will try:
- Not cooking the cauliflower in advance. Baking should be enough.
- Slightly less yeast. (Although I love nutritional yeast, the flavor was more upfront than I want.)
- Add cayenne, black pepper, or maybe even hot sauce during the prep. 
- More garlic and maybe onion flakes, too. 
- Some egg whites to help it congeal and add more protein.
- Cottage cheese instead of yogurt.
- Top with a layer of cheese and less breadcrumbs.

I would have rated it a 4, because once I added some garlic salt, it was great, but my wife would have rated it a 1 or 2, because she said she could taste the cauliflower, and hated it.  So...I rated it in the middle :)  I didn't put the yeast flakes, but left everything else as is.

I made some minor changes; light sour cream instead of Greek yogurt, no yeast flakes and no nutmeg. This recipe was easy and delish!  I don't even like cauliflower and my daughter knew what was in it and ate it all up. Beats the heaviness of my tasty but cheese heavy Mac and cheese. Will definitely make it again and again!
