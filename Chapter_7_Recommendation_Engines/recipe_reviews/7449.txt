This recipe is divine.  I did not have any chocolate squares so I used 1/2 cup cocoa mixed with a little hot water.  It turned out fantastic.  :)

This is the best Frosting recipe I have ever tasted.  At first I thought it was to thick to spread, but it's not.  It is very creamy, and tastes just like the butter cream frosting from good bakeries.  My husband gives it 5 stars!

In a pinch, I thought this was a great recipe.  While I did use dry milk powder, I think you could've used milk and added until you got a smooth consistency you like.  I used softened butter and not "shortening."  Needed a white icing, so I skipped the chocolate - very tasty, great consistency, easy to make.  Note, I would only add 1/4 confectioner's sugar at a time to mix and add the portions of milk or dry poweder milk+water as needed to keep the dust down and keep a creamy consistency.

I have to agree that this frosting was on the gritty side and fell short on flavor. I was going to throw it out but decided to try adding some softened butter and mix the heck out of it. It did help the texture and added a little flavor. I don't think I'll make this again. I have to admit this was fluffy, but I didn't care for the taste that much. I will keep searching for a fluffy chocolate frosting. Sorry!

I made this recipe and it is true that it is fluffy and creamy.  However,I did not like the flavor of the unsweetened chocolate.

This was a big hit! One batch made more than enough for a 9-inch double layer chocolate cake, and my husband, mother, and kids (and me too!) enjoyed spooning up the rest before we even ate the cake. This is the first recipe I've found for home made frosting that I will use again. It spreads so easily and tastes rich and chocolatey. I will never buy store-bought frosting again!

Until I added the egg white I really couldn't see how this was creamy at all, but persevere, it does work out. I'm not sure if I used the right ingredient for "shortening", but purchased "Trex" which is a vegetable fat found in the butter section of the supermarket. I must admit, the texture is a little grainy like others have advised, but it still tastes great. It's smooth and soft, but wasn't what I'd describe as "fluffy".
It doesn't initially seem too sweet. However, the more you eat, the richer it gets!

I used this frosting on the Hazelnut Chocolate Cake also on this site and it came out terrific!  The frosting is very spreadable, holds up well, and is not overly sweet or sugary.  VERY creamy!

Perfect! I am going to try no egg and more milk next time. NOTE: I didn't have any powdered milk so I just nixed that and the water and added 3 tbsp of milk.

I have made this frosting several times as I do love it and it lives up to it's name.  My tips are use everything as stated however margarine works best instead of butter or some type of shortening and the chocolate is best as 60% cacao baking chocolate.

This recipe was gross.  I followed the directions ecxactly and it turned out horrible.  It was gritty and way to sugary.  It ruined the cake I put it on.

Great frosting; loved the taste and texture; also how it spread. I'm one to be exact so hope this helps: I wasn't exactly sure what type of powdered milk to use so I used what I had  on hand-Cremora and   it turned out fine. I also used a jumbo egg for the egg white and that worked well. I questioned the consistency when mixing the first part powdered sugar and shortening(I used butter flavor) because it wasn't  creaming; sort of crumbly but its ok. I also made sure the chocolate was pretty cool before I  added it. I had enough frosting for a bundt cake and filling in center and a few cupcakes!

I was out of squares so I used the replacement for cocoa powder and shortening. My husband and kids liked it, I thought the flavor was off, can't put my finger on what it was however it didn't taste right to me.

I loved this . Made it exactly like recipe said . Mine was a bit lighter in color and didn't look quite as creamy as in the picture. Perhaps I whipped it too long.

Forget this one! I am not a fan of shortening based frosting. I was hoping this would be an exception. I was looking for a light chocolate frosting. This frosting had not much chocolate flavor, even as I added, and extra ounce of chocolate.  Frosting was light, and as shortening frosting will do it gets a crusty texture, even when cake is stored in a cake container.  I will stick to buttercream frosting.  Karo syrup works well to get that fluffy and light texture w/o the crusty, shortening flavor.

*Amazing" chocolate flavor.  It is indeed fluffy and creamy, and mine was not gritty at all.  Be sure to beat it on your mixer's highest setting and be patient.  Eventually you'll have whipped enough air into it that it will be light and delicious.  Be forewarned that while it's not especially sweet it is *very* rich.

Beautiful frosting, perfect consistency, perfectly scrumptious!  This is a keeper.
