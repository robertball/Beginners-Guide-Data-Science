Phenomenal.  Made my own tamarind paste since I had the fruit on hand.  Wasn't difficult at all.  Didn't have an orange, so I used about 1/4 more of OJ than called for, plus the OJ was 50% reduced sugar .  Didn't miss the zest, and used about 10 packs of Splenda in place of sugar.  The glaze reduced nicely, and the entire family loved it!  I think this is one of the best chicken recipes we have had.

Yum! This was very tasty and also worth noting it looks great. Definitely worth serving to guests. I had bought Tamarind puree to use in a Pad Thai recipe and wanted another recipe to utilise it more often. I wasn't sure what herbs de provence was, I guess we don't have that round here so I looked up what herbs are normally in that mix and saw it included basil and thyme which I did have. I used a tablespoon each and found the thyme a bit strong so I'll adjust the herbs next time. We served with salad but might try on kebabs also. A really great recipe I'm pleased to have!

OMG! We made this for our guests over the weekend and they referred to it as "divine". I have to agree. We make a lot of chicken recipes and this has to be our absolute favorite. If you live in an area where you can't find tamarind glaze...you can obtain it on Amazon, which is what WE did.

Definitely one I will make again. I try to follow a recipe exactly the first time, but I couldn't find tamarind paste. I substituted tamarind chutney. I did not have a fresh orange, so used good-quality Orange juice and omitted the zest. I also did not have the optional chili garlic sauce. 

This sauce would also be great on pork. I pounded the chicken breast to 3/4" thickness, then scored both sides and marinated for 45 minutes. After grilling, we let the meat rest for about five minutes, and then sliced to  1/4" thickness and topped with part of the sauce, serving the remainder of the sauce at the table. Definitely nice enough for guests.I served it with broccoli and white rice, and a cucumber tomato onion salad.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was great. It was raining so cooked the chicken under the broiler. It did take me about 50 minutes to reduce the glaze but I live at high altitude. My husband, daughter and her boyfriend all loved it. My daughter said it had an unusual taste but in a good way because she's never had anything like it. I served it with a kale salad and long grain and wild rice. I will definitely make this again. Next time I might do kabobs like another reviewer suggested. Thanks for the recipe, it's definitely going into my rotation. Also, I made exactly as written.

This recipe is so tasty! Both my husband and I loved it. I served the chicken (which I marinated for 2 hours) over basmati rice and poured a little of the reserved marinade over the whole thing. Wonderful recipe.

Not sure about this one....I love natural tamarind, tamarind candies and drinks, so excited to try it. first time I made it, I felt the ginger taste was too strong...my 15 year old however LOVED it. I made it again and my daughter thought it was ok, but I decided its not good enough for our taste buds to keep making. thanks for posting though.

This was very flavorful and delicious!  We love big flavors so I actually added MORE of the herbs de' provence (even though other reviews said to cut it back, we loved it with more) and I used tangelos instead of oranges since they are in season and so yummy!  don't be shy with the sriracha, the glaze was still a bit on the sweet side even with 4 big squirts of it....... we had it over couscous with a salad and it was phe-nom-nom!  will def make again....... :)

This may just be my favorite chicken recipe on this site. It is just so good. Had a hard time finding tamarind paste in a grocery store so ended up in an Asian market in my city. Well worth it. This will be my go to recipe when having company over to do some grilling. The sauce can be made ahead and reheated. This recipe is a must try.

Not bad.  I used half the herbs de provence because the full amount was way too much.  I may even reduce more next time.  I couldn't find oranges big enough to juice either so I just used OJ.  The recipe doesn't speficy if you skewer or cut the breasts at all so I just made the whole breasts.  I think it might be better to cut and thread the chicken onto skewers.  Oh and I cooked mine in the oven.  Definitely missed the smoky flavour a bbq would give.  I think this is one grill recipe that can't be done in an oven.

Good tasting but entirely too much trouble for end result.   I followed recipe to the letter as I had all ingredients.  Started to panic after 30 min b/c sauce wasn't reducing to glaze consistency.  It was closer to an hour when it looked like it should.  I said it tasted good, but the chicken was too sweet for my taste.  For those who do like sweet poultry, it would be nice if you could make a  bigger batch of glaze and save it for  2-3 grills.   Perhaps then, the recipe might be worth the work.

I was not able to use either a charcoal or gas grill, so I had to use another person's electric stove. I over cooked the meat, but it still met with the approval of my wife and the person whom I take care of who is a gourmet cook until she lost most of her vision to a brain tumor. Not bad for probably one of the worst cooks in America!!

This was great and different than I am used to cooking.  I thought it would be too strong a flavor because of the strong smell the tamarind sauce gave off while being cooked down, but it was delicious.  I had to cook my chicken much longer than the recommended 4 minutes per side but I cooked it to 160 and it was moist and flavorful.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for a fun and delicious recipe.

Very tasty with one complaint. I made this exactly as directed, using tamarind paste, not concentrate. It took an extremely long time to attempt to cook the tamarind down (it remained in lumps even after an hour of vigorous boiling and even hitting it w/ a stick blender). The end result of the glaze was tasty but too sour for me, so I ended up doubling or tripling the sugar. It was still plenty sour then. I loved the chicken overall, but next time I will either use whole tamarind or find the concentrate liquid to ease preparation of the glaze. I will absolutely make this again. (Oh, and I did have to bake and then broil rather than use the grill. 425 for 15-20 mins and finish under broiler w/ glaze... was perfect).

Very, very good. I usually make the recipes exactly as posted the first time, but I only had 1 tbsp herbes de Provence but marinated it for 6 hours. It still turned out very tasty. Will definetly make it again!

Made this recipe for gets last weekend.  Had a hard time finding the tamarind but finally found some pulp and it worked out quite well.  Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again.

I thought this was a great dish. Very tasty.  I'll definitely make it again.  I wiped off most of the marinade before grilling.  Also, only made 2 chicken breasts, so I'll use the extra sauce on some grilled or poached fish sometime soon.

I usually only try recipes that mostly have four and five stars. I could not wait to try this one. I am another one that did not like the marinade.The Tamarind orange glaze was OK. I probably try it again with another marinade for the chicken. it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.    Mamarey

Was not happy with the marinade though the Tamarind orange glaze I thought was very good. Just a personal thing. Will definitely make again without the first step of marinade and cut the tamarind paste amount to 1 tablespoon from 2. I'm sure there are those who like the recipe as is but if like me try without the marinade.

Someone better change this recipe - nowhere is it mentioned to put the chicken breasts into pieces for skewers.The title of this recipe conflicts with the actual preparation . Lets get it right so that people dont have to guess.

This was so good. I took one reviewer's advice and pounded the breasts to about 1 inch thickness before marinading.  I also used tamarind chutney instead of tamarind paste. My entire family have already put in requests for me to make this again.

Made this exactly as directed (well, I used five chicken breasts) and I found 2 tablespoons of herbes de Provence overpowering. (I thought it looked like a lot as I was adding it into the marinade and thought maybe it was a typo and was supposed to be two teaspoons?)  I  love bold flavors but it was too much and I felt it overwhelmed the dish, even with the orange zest and ginger in there. If I make this again it will only be because I have so much tamarind left and yes, I'll cut the herbes in half.
