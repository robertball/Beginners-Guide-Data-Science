This was really good for roast beef sandwiches.   I cut the recipe in half and it still made a lot.  This will make enough for a lot more than 8 sandwiches.  (Maybe 12 - 16)  Next time I will cream the cream cheese really well in my kitchen aide mixer and then scrape down and  add the rest of the ingredients.

Delicious! I also cut the recipe in 1/2 and it made a lot, so keep that in mind. I was using granulated garlic and onion powders (which are more potent), so I did cut back on those. Made this to accompany 'Catfish Po Boys' on this site. Great flavor...will be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is so tasty! I made it to go on some fancy ham roll-ups (Lol, is there such a thing?) and its really good!
I used homemade cream cheese, and I didnt have horseradish. Still yummy though!

This is EXCELLENT!!!  We used it on our crabs cakes and were blown away with it!!  We have a bunch leftover and were thinking it'd be great on something with ham or even a pork roast!  Can't wait to use it!
