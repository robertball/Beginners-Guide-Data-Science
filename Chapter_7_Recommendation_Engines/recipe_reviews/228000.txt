I used two packets Splenda instead of one Sweet-n-Low. I only had Smirnoff Whipped Vodka on hand so I used that. The Whipped Vodka made it into a creamy lemon drop, kind of like a creamsicle only with lemon. LOVED it.

Not a huge fan of the Sweet'N low in the lemon drop.  Sorry (Splenda is my personal favorite).  Also, for a Lemon "twist" try using half whpped cream or vanilla vodka.

This was very sour. If you like sour you should love this drink. But it was a little too sour for me. I may try again but add more sweet'n low.

I liked it!   But I like my drinks a little on the tart side.  I used regular Grey Goose and a Stevia packet so my only lemon flavor came from the juice, which was just fine.   Itâ€™ll be a great drink for the summer.
