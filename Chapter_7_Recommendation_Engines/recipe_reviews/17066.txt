With minor variations this is the recipe I've been making for 40 years. It originally came from a home ec teacher and it is beyond awesome.  The differences are, first, that I cream the softened butter with the sugar (not melted). I add 1 tsp. lemon juice with the vanilla, and use 1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder, and 1-3/4 c. flour. Finally, regardless of how many bananas are used it should equal 1 cup. You will never find a better banana bread, and over the course of 40 years, I've never heard differently. Edited 8/17/09: My original 4/14/08 review should have indicated that I mash the bananas, not slice them.

As other reviewers mentioned, it was very moist and the flavor was good.  My only issue was the sight & feel of the bananas in the bread.  Slicing them up, instead of mashing or pureeing them, causes them to be quite mushy and purple.  I felt like I was biting into a bruise each time I ate a slice.  I ended up digging them out before eating in order to salvage the bread.  Sorry, but I think I'll stick to mashing or pureeing...but I'll use the rest of this recipe.

This is Martha Stewart's recipe... only Martha's says to use room temp. butter.. and suggests using a mixer for the butter and sugar to make it light and fluffy before adding flour and other ingredients, and a full cup of mashed bananas instead of chopped up like Janet says.. more bananas and mashing them is what many of you said you did to tweak this recipe, and it is better that way.  It is a great recipe.

This is quite simply the best banana bread I've ever had. I followed the recipe as stated, with a few additions, to enhance the overall flavor of the bread. 

I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp ground cloves to the batter and 1/2- 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips in addition to the walnuts. Almost all the reviewers agree that the bananas should be mashed, so I mashed them. This distributed the banana flavor evenly throughout the dough. 

I also advise against using a mixer for the batter. This would whip too much air into the cake and take away from its dense quality. I baked the bread at 325 and it was perfectly done in an hour and 15 minutes. It cuts easily, thinly and has a great crust. Thank you for a great recipe!

Just want to chime in here and say that this bread is delicious.  It came out soft and moist (but not underdone) on the inside with a slightly crunchy exterior.  I also left out the nuts with no negative side effects.
....................................
The second time I made it (after writing the review), I didn't have any sour cream, and so I substituted strawberry yogurt.  Just thought I'd mention that it is quite tasty that way, too.  :o)

This is a wonderful recipe! We are under contract for baking and use it frequently. A couple suggestions...when your bananas are ripening on the counter, throw them into the freezer - skin on! The day you plan to bake, pull them out and allow to partially thaw. All you need to do is cut the top off and squeeze the banana "pulp" into your mixing bowl. Sweet and delicious! We also use mini cupcake pans, mini loaf pans, and the new square "muffin" pans with this recipe. Adjust your bake time accordingly - approx 15 for mini cakes, and 20 for mini loaves and squares. Perfect with a cold glass of milk or hot coffee or tea! Freeze well!

This is the best banana bread ever, and i have tried many looking for the best. Two suggestions 1) be sure to let your bananas become fully ripe with lotsa brown on the peel and a little on the fruit  2) i use three bananas for more moist loaf and more robust banana flavor

With a few slight changes, this was the best banana bread I have ever tasted! First of all, do use room temp real butter and cream it with the sugar. Also, make sure your eggs are room temp. Sift the dry ingredients together and add 1tsp. cinnamon and 1/2tsp. nutmeg. Also make sure you use a full cup of MASHED bananas. With these modifications, you will have the best banana bread on the planet :)

Excellent recipe and I'm a novice to cooking.  I did substitute the sour cream for lowfat banana yogurt and added a pinch of cinnamon.

ADDED:  I noticed I have had this recipe in my allrecipe.com recipe box for almost 10 years.  Still good after all these years.

Please excuse my language but this was the BEST EFFIN THING I'VE EVER EATEN! I had a bunch of over ripe bananas that I needed to use and so I decided to make this. After reading just a few reviews I went with it and made the following changes: 1 3/4 c flour, 1tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, added 1tsp lemon juice, 1/8t ground nutmeg, 3/4tsp ground cinnamon and used 1 1/2 c mashed bananas.  I have currently made 2 loaves and will definitely be needing to buy more bananas ASAP! I also omitted the nuts as we don't care for them. :D wish I could give it like a billion stars!

Yhis bread was good right after I baked it.  The banana pieces turned brown and were gooey the next day.  I think the mashed bananas make a better bread.

Thanks for the great idea of slicing the bananas!  That's what makes this recipe different from the rest.  I used half brown sugar, whole wheat pastry flour, and plain yogurt for the sour cream.  Really banana-y and moist. This might be the banana bread recipe I've been looking for.  Slice the bananas thinly and you won't find hunks - just intense, moist banana flavor.

I DID make a few changes (sorry I HATE when people do this!) Instead of the butter I used 1/4c. applesauce (for health) and 1/4 c. veggie oil.
Also, Instead of the sour cream (didn't have any on hand) I used 1/4 vanilla yogurt and 1/4 greek yogurt. All in all this bread was absolutely INCREDIBLE and was gone in about a day! 
THanks for the recipe!

This is my preferred banana bread recipe.  I make the following changes: 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour, 2 large bananas mashed, and a large handful each of walnuts and chocolate chips...Also I mixed the flour/salt/baking soda seperately first, aswell as beat the eggs and vanilla together before adding to the butter and sugar...I put it in a square cake pan and it's done in less than an hour...The smell is amazing!

Great recipe as is. Modify to suit your own taste buds without fear, but always use sour cream (or yogurt or similar ingredient). Think it gives a moister flavor.

I made the following changes the second time around:
1) Used room temp butter and creamed it with sugar.  2) Whipped egg slightly first for about 30-60sec. Didn't want it too fluffy, but didn't want it too dense. Mix well with the rest of wet ingred. except sour cream.  3) Used 1/2 teaspoon each baking soda and powder as suggested by others.  4) Added pinch (1/4-1/2 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg to taste.   5) Used 1 cup of freshly toasted pecans, almonds, walnuts (or any other favorite combinations). Fold the nuts into the batter with the sour cream step. Using freshly toasted nuts gives the bread a fuller flavour IMHO. Toast on skillet or toaster oven. Let cool. Then crush. Also added craisins.  6) Used 1 cup mashed bananas as suggested by others. I would reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup if the banana is really ripe and sweet, but that's personal preference.

I find that baking this recipe using glass baking pan gives it a crunchier crust. Reduce temp by 25degF if using glass instead of aluminum. 

To the poster that complained it was too salty, always use sea salt (medium coarseness) instead of ionized table salt for baking and cooking. 1/2 tsp is a LOT of salt if using regular table salt, but is about right when using coarse sea salt. And if you're using salted butter, then adjust salt accordingly or eliminate.

FINALLY - I found a banana bread recipe that equals my sister's.  Been trying since 1985!  She won't share her recipe so I've been on a quest to find the best.  I like my BB cakey, not wet and heavy, so this definitely fit the bill.  I used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream, added a dash of cinnamon and more nuts than called for.  It was delicious!  I am making this BB, taking it over to my sister's house and telling her "nanny nanny boo boo!"  Thanks for the recipe, I love it!

I am rating this 4 stars because of the necessary tweaks.  With the tweaks it was a 5 star recipe, but I hate to rate something 5 stars when tweaks were necessary (as per the suggestion of so many reviewers).  I mashed 3 bananas, added 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/4 t nugmeg, 1/8 t cloves, and replaced the 1c of sugar with 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/3 c granulated sugar. For those who don't want to use a lot of sugar, I think it could still be reduced some more. (I'll probably try 1/3 cup brown and 1/4 cup of granulated next time...especially if I use 3 bananas again.)  I have young children without many teeth, so I didn't use nuts.  I put in some chocolate chips, but they ended up sinking to the bottom. Probably won't do that again. When I tried to remove the bread from the pan, the chocolate was still soft and, since most of it was at the bottom, the bottom of the bread broke off. I placed the bread upside down on a rack to cool and I reattached the bottom. Once the choc. chips were cool, they kind of served as glue to bond the bread back together. I wrapped it in saran wrap after it was cool.  This morning, when I sliced the bread, the bottom didn't fall off. I could barely tell there had been a problem.

As always, the reviews here were very helpful, but I was confused about cooking temps and times because glass pans and metal pans are different.  I used a 9"x4" metal pan (old bread pan that was my mom's) and baked at 325 for 1 hr 10 min.  It was cooked perfectly.  Moist, but not over-

Perfect recipe. I did some research before I chose this and it looks like the best on the internet. ONE note though. For those of you who haven't read into the chemistry of baking soda, when you mix it with the cream it will start to react IMMEDIATELY. When it reacts it releases Carbon dioxide (which causes the bread to rise). The only problem with this is if you wait to put it in the oven it will release too much CO2 and cause your bread to fall flat. 

So for a future reference, mix in your baking soda last and have your oven ready for you to toss it in. 

Oh and just a note, I also beat the whites in my eggs separately (like you do when your making cake) in order to oxidize them. It made the cake even fluffier. I love this recipe!

I followed the recipe closely only making a couple small changes: 
---All brown sugar instead of white
---No salt since my butter was salted
---Mashed bananas instead of sliced (even with this next time I'll mash them even finer)
---Double Vanilla extract
---Roasted the walnuts before chopping them

I also altered the mixing instructions. I mixed everything as directed til where it said to mix in flour then fold the bananas, walnuts, and sour cream. I mixed those in and then gently stirredi n the flour mixture. I have found that doing this results in a more tender bread and also makes everything stir together more quickly. 

I thought that the batter was a little runny but I left it alone and I am VERY glad I did. It came out perfectly 57 minutes into the baking time. I didn't add any spices or anything (a new tactic for banana bread and me) and I'm glad I didn't. The banana really shined and it didn't taste too much like something you'd more predominantly have in autumn or winter.

I've made the banana banana bread recipe several times and I'm going to have to try baking them side by side to do a taste test. They're both absolutely delicious though!!

awesome.. I've tried at least 10 different recipes for banana bread but this one was mine and my husbands favourite.  My picky 4 year old even ate it.  I omitted the walnuts and put chocolate chips instead.  Worked perfectly.

Excellent!  I did make some changes, so I could enjoy a slice (or two) along with my family.  I used Best Life for baking instead of butter, 1/2 cup splenda blend, nonfat sugar-free vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream and used all whole wheat flour.  Following the review by Naples, I added a tsp. each of lemon juice & baking powder.  Finally, I had three bananas "ready" so I used all three and I did mash them rather than slice.  My favorite part of this recipe was even though I used all whole wheat flour, this was the most moist banana bread......ever!  DELISH!  Thank you for sharing your recipe that made my adjustments turn out so well!

This is a great recipe! I made 2 smaller loaves instead. I gave them as gifts & got rave reviews. I dumped my bananas in the blender with the sour cream & pulsed them, leaving some small chunks. I also dusted my loaf pans with cinnamon & sugar after greasing them. It makes for a wonderful 'crust' on the bread.

Read many reviews and decided I was definitely mashing the bananas. Followed naples34102 review and creamed soft butter and sugar with my hand mixer. Used 1 3/4cups white whole wheat flour and added 1 tsp. lemon juice with the vanilla extract. Also added 1 tsp. baking powder, along with the other ingredients. 1 heaping cup of mashed bananas is perfect. The sour cream makes a really moist bread. Omitted the nuts. Will be replacing our family banana bread recipe(been around for at least 70 years) with this one.

Finally, the recipe I've been looking for! Perfect with the following suggested changes: creaming the butter and sugar, adding cinnamon and nutmeg. Split into 2 loaf pans, this cooked up perfectly in 50 minutes @ 325F.

I made this bread into muffins by using greased muffin tins. I tried three varieties: plain, with walnuts, and with dark chocolate chips. The dark chocolate chip ones were a real hit! I used nonfat plain yogurt in place of the sour cream, which may have given the muffins a fluffier texture. Also, I used one cup of mashed banana. Cooking time was shorter-25 minutes-since I opted for muffin tins.

I really liked the bread part of this receipe but just slicing the banana's ruined it for me. The banana's turn out soggy and brown. I prefer mashing the banana's.

made this with out the sour cream (didn't have it, will try next time)  and it still turned out so delicious and moist.  The kids and my husband loved it.  It's sadly already gone.  Great recipe!

1-23-12 Made this again with the sour cream.  Easy enough for my littles to make while I 'supervised'.  We doubled the recipe this time, both loaves turned out great.  A very moist, flavorful bread.  Have already passed this along to a few friends wanting a good banana bread recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe overflowed our loaf pan, so I would make it in a larger pan next time. We sprinkled dry oats on top for a country look, and added pecans instead of walnuts. It is delicious, very moist and sturdy. Thanks!

Awesome recipe! Never thought banana bread was so easy to make! For my taste, I will cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup next time. I mashed 4 very ripe bananas and the bread was very tender and full of banana flavor. Also, instead of chopped walnuts, I added 1/3 cup of ground almonds which maintained the smooth texture but added a nice almond undertone. I meant to add cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom but forgot, but will next time. With my variations, my bread took an extra 5 minutes in the oven, but I will definitely refer back to this recipe in the future!

I have made this many times over the past 3 years.
I however, mix in the bananas into the batter at the end and I always use 4 large bananas.
I do not put in the nuts but I do put in a cup of chocolate chips, nice change. This is the best banana bread.

I have made this recipe three times now (once as bread and twice as muffins) and we love it!  I do have to say that 1/2 cup of sour cream is a bit too  noticeable in the taste and that bothered my husband.  Now, instead of using 2 bananas, i use 3 (MASHED for sure), and only use 1/4 cup sour cream.  Perfect.  Hubby didn't even know I still used sour cream in the recipe.

I also make this recipe as muffins, using a muffin tin and paper liners, which makes about 12 muffins and i only bake for about 25 min.  Easier/more fun to eat and still more moist than most of the banana nut muffin recipes on here!

I was really disappointed with this recipe the way it is.  I've never attempted banana bread before and I was excited to find a recipe that had 5 stars thinking there is no way I could go wrong.  I followed the recipe to the letter and the bread came out with sticky purple sliced up bananas throughout the bread.  It was really disgusting.  My husband and I could not even eat it, it was so disgusting to look at and really just awful.  I've had much better banana bread from my mother than this one.  Won't bake this one again.

Out. of. this. world. Wow. Rich, yet delicate...a wonderful bread. After reading reviews, I (like I tend to do) followed the advice of Naples34102: soft butter (not melted), tsp of lemon juice. I really think this will solve the issues of the banana browning that some have experienced. I will admit, my bread has only been out of the oven for 30 minutes... I couldn't wait any longer to test it. WOW. It is so good! I can see why people eat the whole loaf right away! I sprinkled just half the loaf with chopped nuts for coworkers who do not care for nuts. I am sure this will be a HUGE hit!!  **used light sour cream.

Everyone has already said it all!  This is THE banana bread recipe!!  I used 1 cup of bananas, and added 1 teaspoon of baking powder as many others did.  Also a 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and a teaspoon of lemon juice.  I didn't have enough sour cream, so I used about 1/4 Greek yogurt and 1/4 cup sour cream, and it was perfect!  After creaming the sugar, butter and eggs, I mixed in the dry ingredients and folded in the rest by hand - it does make a difference.  The best banana bread I've ever made.

Ok made this and the slicing vs the mashing of the bananas...MASH your banannas! That is my only complaint. It looks like meat in the bread. Which looks very unappatitsing plus the texture did not help any.

Great recipe for a large banana bread. I made two changes to this recipe (sorry).  I don't normally use sour cream so I used a vanilla yogurt, similar in texture to sour cream instead.
And I too, mashed the bananas before adding them to the mixture.

N.B.: To Sandy who's banana bread wasn't baked on the inside -- two possible problems to your dilemma - #1 - bake the loaf on a lower rack rather than in the middle or #2 - your oven might need to be checked - the thermostat may not be working properly.  Hope you resolve the oven issues and try this recipe again.  IT'S THAT GOOD!

Excellent! I took the advice of several reviewers and mashed the bananas, which distributes the fruit more uniformly. Very moist with loads of banana flavor. The few changes I made were to mash up 3 bananas, as they were not large, and pour in half the batter, top that with a mixture of 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon, then top with the rest of the batter. Also, I did not melt the butter, but creamed it with the sugar. I found, however, that it could have used another few minutes of baking time, as the top sank some in the middle. Attractively browned top and sides, just like the picture. Absolutely brilliant.

Undoubtedly the BEST banana bread recipe I have tried (sorry grandma). I think the sliced bananas add more moisture to the bread, and the butter content gives the bread a great crust (don't wrap it in saran to maintain it though). To note, I used what I had available. I used 1 container of nonfat vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream, I also used 3 bananas and added 1/4 c. cooked rasins to the recipe.

The flavor of this bread is fantastic, however the sliced bananas made the bread fall apart. They don't look too appetizing either! You eat with your eyes first...so, I would have given this a five. I will make this again, but with mashed bananas instead.

This recipe is wicked!  The inside was perfectly moist with the outer edge slightly crunchy and slightly sweet.  

I mashed the bananas, did not slice them.  And I did not use a mixer (in case anyone is wondering whether or not to use one); I mixed the butter (semi-melted) and the sugar with a wooden spoon and then used a wisk.

Oh - and on the suggestion of another reviewer, I doubled the recipe (I had four good sized bananas I wanted to use) and baked it in a bundt pan and it turned out perfect.  And I have lots o' banana bread! :)

WOW! These are really moist, flavorful muffins!  Being a professional pastry chef, I thought I've already tried the best banana bread/muffins but these definitely take the cake.  I substituted 1/2 cup egg substitute for the 2 eggs and used fat free sour cream.  I made them into 24 mini-muffins and 6 regular size.  Awesome!  Thanks

This turned out beautifully and I didn't even have all of the ingredients.  I only used 1/3 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup maple syrup + 2 TBSP honey instead of the sugar, and omitted the vanilla (I ran out!).  I also added a little extra banana.  The bread was great warm with a little butter.  Also, I reduced the cooking time because my oven runs hotter.  Overall, this is a keeper!

very disppointed in this recipe!  I picked it because it had 5 stars and was quick and easy.  I was looking for a quick recipe as it was my first attempt at banana bread...very disappointing.  I tried to make it twice.  The first time it bubbled over, fell flat and was not all that great....so I made a second batch (thinking I missed something the first time). NOPE!  the banana's fell to the bottom making it flat and too moist at the bottom.  I would mash -- as everyone else suggested....I wish I would have listenend.

This is the absolute BEST banana bread I have ever made or eaten!! I used softened butter & 3 bananas(mine were small). There's no need to try any others, this is PERFECTION!

I've used this recipe for years, substituting here and there if I didn't have all the ingredients. Chocolate chips go well instead of nuts too.

I picked this recipes because I only had two bananas at the time. As always I followed the recipe exact so my review is based on the original recipe and not a recommendation or suggestion. The first time around it was good but I would only give it 3 stars because it is missing additional flavors and the sliced bananas don't bake as good as mashed. To make it a 4.5 star rating the second time I mashed the bananas, poured the mixture into 6 large muffin tins and made a crumb topping (4tbs butter, 4tbs brown sugar, 2tbs flour, 3tsp cinnamon and 1/8tsp nutmeg) and baked for at 350 for 45mins.

This Bread was AWESOME!! I took the advice of some of the other posters and creamed the butter and sugar, instead of melting the butter, as well as mashed the bananas. I also used pecans in place of the walnuts (we didn't have any walnuts) and it was SOOO good! Everyone was crazy for it!! Another thing I did? I let the eggs, butter and sour cream reach close to room temperature before putting it in. I read somewhere that in baked goods, (unless its pie) room temperature ingredients make a more moist product, and this was so moist, I believe there may be something to it?

I did not care for this recipe. Completely gooey inside. The outside was pretty brown and I think when I tested it it was "crunchy" on the outside it wiped the toothpick clean. But the bread wasn't done at all.

My first attempt at this recipe and I am thrilled! I am eating a piece right now, still warm from the oven. I only reduced the sugar a bit, I like it less sweet. This way my son can also enjoy a piece, he is quite young and I don't give him too many sweets. And the bananas are always mashed when I make a banana nut bread, so I did this here as well. It is a light and moist BNB, simply perfect. It's much lighter in color than the other recipe I use, I have no clue why that is. If you want a "no fail recipe" try this...you won't regret it.

This is simply divine!  I doubled the recipe only to discover that I didn't have enough eggs, so I added 1/2 cup applesauce and 2 tblsp vegetable oil to add moisture.  It still turned out great.  This is the best banana bread I have ever had!

DELICIOUS!  I love that the bananas are sliced not mashed.  It sets it apart from other banana bread recipes.  The bread is so moist and the edges are crunchy.  I had to skip the walnuts for health reasons.  Next time I may add fresh cranberries and make it into muffins.  Thank you vjonsson for sharing!

Mmmmmm our family loves banana bread and this recipe delivered!  I used all brown sugar instead of white.  I also had lots of little mini bananas I got from the dollar store; I doubled the recipe so I put in aprox 2+ cups of mashed banana.  Sprinkled nuts on top of one loaf and sugar in the raw on the other.  *** If making gifts of the bread:  The one with the sugar on top wasn't as pretty of a color/appearance wasn't shiny/smooth.  The sugar left a bubbly look to the surface but it tasted sweet and chewy. :)

I have baked this cake often and it's definitely a best seller. Slicing the bananas really enhances flavor.   I grease my bundt pan then coat it with sugar and cinnamon before pouring the batter in.

It's a cake for beginners and pros and definitely a cake to bake when you have over ripe bananas. (you can freeze the 2 peeled bananas each plastic container to thaw and slice when you need them).

This was absolutely the best banana nut bread I've ever made!  I did tweek it by adding a little cinnamon, ginger and brown sugar.  I sliced instead of mashed the bananas and did get a little purple color but the taste was not affected at all.  The baking time should be longer.  My bread took about 1 hour & 20 minutes.  I foil tented during the last 30 minutes so it wouldnt brown too much and the color is perfect!.  Good consistency, good outter crust, GREAT flavor!  Yum!

Very good recipe, however I made the following changs:  I clarified the butter, used 1/4 cup light brown sugar and a generous 1/2 cup white sugar, used whole wheat flour, added 2 tsps. cinnamon to flour mixture, replaced sour cream with non-fat Greek plain yogurt, used 3 large perfectly riped bananas, mashed with potato masher leaving the bananas with some chunks, and added 1/4 cup raisins.  I baked it for 40 minutes, removed from oven and covered edges with foil to prevent over-browning.  Placed back in oven and continued baking for an additional 20 minutes. It was cooked perfectly and was very delicious and moist.  Next time, I will spinkle top with a mixture of cinnamon and white sugar before placing it in the oven.  I think that will make a nice addition.

Great recipe for those over ripe bananas.  I've made this recipe at least a dozen times.  It's a family favorite.  I don't melt the butter.  Instead, I let the butter reach room temperature and then cut into small pieces and smoosh into the sugar.  I also don't add walnuts.

Delicious recipe with just a couple of changes.  I did not melt the butter, I softened it and creamed it with the sugar. Also, I mashed the bananas and added a tsp of cinnamon. I frosted half of the loaf with a cream cheese frosting and left the other half without.

I have made this recipe numerous times for over a year now and it comes out perfect every time and gets rave reviews. It's seriously the perfect banana bread recipe. Here are my variations:

1) Cream the butter and sugar instead of melting the butter.
2) Use 3/4 sugar (health-wise decision).
3) Sometimes I add 1/2 cup fresh blueberries instead of nuts for variety.
4) I use low-fat sour cream and it tastes the same. 
5) I've substituted plain yogurt in a pinch when I have no sour cream.

Best Banana bread I have ever baked!!!

The baking time said 60 minutes, but at that time it was still uncooked and liquid in the middle. Ended up cooking until a toothpick test came out clean, which was 20-25 minutes longer.  

For the bananas, I sliced them and then chopped them up but I did not mash them. Also for the nuts I used pecans instead of walnuts and I added 1 tsp cinnamon.

I try a million recipes on this site. Most will alot of success. I however very rarely rate recipes or write a comment. I HAD TO write a review for this recipe. I have made many banana bread recipes and never have I had such success. This was the best banana bread I have ever tasted. I made the recipe exactly as it stated. Baked it for exactly the same amount of time. It smelled like it was starting to burn because my whole house had the wonderful aroma of banana bread. I thought, oh no, I ruined it! NOPE, I checked on it and it was fine. After baking for 60 minutes, I let it cool and it sliced up really nice. It wasn't crumby or gummy. Perfect slices of perfect bread! Thanks for the amazing recipe. I will use it for the rest of my life!

Good base for banana bread but I mashed the banana no offense but to slice them as the recipe called for they would be brown blobs of banana in just a few hours.  Don't really want to bite into brown  banana mush.

The batter was light and fluffy but the bread was a bit denser than I would have preferred. There were no leftovers so the family must have enjoyed it!

Yep, doing it Martha Stewart's way makes this five star bread.  I did not care for the slices of banana.  Otherwise, this is the best banana bread recipe around!

EXCELLENT recipe! Like other reviewers I smashed up the banana's because I didn't want banana chunks. I also used pecans instead of walnuts (personal preference) and just added a dash of cinnamon. My husband and I can't get enough and it's SO easy to make! Thanks for sharing!

So delish that I could not stop eating it!!!  I used brown sugar instead, and I used a round 8 inch pan and reduced the time by about 5 or 10 mins.  SOOOO good!  I will never ever mash bananas in my bread again.

This is the first banana bread I ever made and my finished product looked like it had purple worms in it...why did the bananas turn purple? and I also didn't like the sliced bananas. I guess they need to be mushed. your picture is nothing like what I got.

This is the BEST recipe ever. I have tried so many recipes and I could never find one that was moist enough. I love how it says to slice the bananas instead of mashing them. My family loves it when I make this bread. My daughter brings it to school as part of her lunch. I highly recommend this recipe.

YUMMO I followed others advice and mashed the banana's, plus I used 4 smaller banana's and only 1/2 the nut amount. My husband doesn't like nuts. Very Very good! Will definately make again!

Absolutely delicious and moist as promised. I thought the sour cream would be more noticeable but it wasn't (maybe because I used lite sour cream?). With very ripe bananas, only half a cup of sugar was more than enough. I forgot to spray the pan but the bread came right off the parchment paper without any issues.  Even the husband liked it a lot and he doesn't like baked goods!

BEST. BANANA. BREAD. EVER!!!

The only changes I made were to add an extra banana for more banana-y flavour, and sub chocolate chips for the walnuts. I also mashed the bananas.

This is the the first banana bread I have ever made. It was excellent!  The sour cream made the bread moist. The only thing I did differently was mash the bananas because I didn't think I'd like the chunks. A keeper and can't wait for my current bunch of bananas to get "too old" to eat!!

I bake quite a bit on a weekly basis.  I stumbled across this recipe and chose it based on that it listed sour cream.  
I'm sorry to say that I am not a fan of this recipe.  The finished product is very "doughy" and as a recent reviewer stated, the cake almost melted while cooling and that was even cooled in loaf pan for 10 minutes prior to moving to cooling rack.
I'll stick to my regular version of banana bread and scrap this banana dough recipe.

I haven't been making banana bread very often since I have a banana cake recipe I like to use my over ripe bananas in when I have them.  However, this one sounded good, and it's great!   I did not realize I had run out of sour cream, so I subbed plain yogurt and I chose to mash bananas rather than slice, but still used 2 medium bananas.  I will definitely use this recipe in the future!

3 stars as written. 5 with changes.(based on my personal preference, everyone is different though) this is a very good starter recipe and has simple ingredients. it is extremely moist! i mashed my bananas because to me the reason banana bread is so good is because the mashed bananas are mixed in with the bread which gives it a very strong banana taste and if you just add slices of banana it would be 'bread with bananas' not 'banana bread'. also after a couple hours the sliced bananas would just be brown mushy pieces. i didn't melt the butter, i used cold. i added about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. and i used 4 bananas instead of 2. i think 2 wouldn't have been enough for a strong banana flavor, 4 was perfect for my taste. thank you for this recipe! :]

The sliced bananas fell to the bottom of the bread.  They were gooey and brown.  Everyone was bothered by the look of the bread.  I would mash the bananas next time if I made it again.  I wasn't a big fan of this bread.  I would rather make the crumb topped banana muffins instead.

This was delicious. I used 4 very ripe bananas and it turned out great. 60 minutes was a little too long for my oven, I almost burned it. Will set the timer for 50 minutes next time and watch it from there.

I took this to a women's breakfast and got a ton of compliments from a group who usually don't say much about the food, so I guess they liked it. I thought it was very good as well. I made only one change, which was to substitute flavored yogurt for the sour cream since I didn't have any sour cream.

Best banana bread ever-hands down!!!
Used slightly less sugar than called for, still very sweet. Instead of sour cream, substitute plain yogurt and no one will ever know and its "lighter." 
"I want the last piece!!!"

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. This is the most delicious moist banana bread I've ever had, and I'm not a banana bread fan. Those of you who are not following the recipe by mashing the bananas instead of slicing them are getting a different tasting bread than what this recipe tastes like with sliced bananas. The one change I did make was to dust the bottom of the pan with cinnamon sugar. It makes the bottom of the bread taste delicious.

This was the best I've made. It was right on, no changes. It wasn't super sweet, leaving room for the awesome banana flavor. I typically add mayo to my baked goods, and I think the sour cream was the same concept.

I substituted 1/2 cup plain low-fat yogurt for the sour cream (it is what I had on hand), and it worked wonderfully. Everyone commented on how moist it was. And I loved that I only had to slice the bananas rather than mash.

I made this for a family gathering and everyone was wanting to know the recipe. It is rich, moist, and filling. I added mini chocolate chips for a little bit more sweetness. But it is also perfect without. Depends on what you like. I love that this is such a simple recipe but it tastes like you spent hours baking in the kitchen :)

After reading others' reviews, I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them.  I didn't have walnuts, so I threw in some sliced almonds instead, which seem to work out just fine.  

Also, I ended up baking my bread at 350F for 75 minutes because the insides were still gooey when I checked it at 60.

Wow! Fantastic! I've been battling to find a great banana bread recipe. Most are too heavy, or too cakey. This was perfect - great texture, very moist - and fast to make! I usually don't give a recipe 5* if i have to change anything - but the only change I made was to add some cinnamon and mixed spice. But the first time I made it I didn't change a thing and it was awesome too.Thanks for posting it!

The family loved it.  I have a small family of 3 so I made mini-loaves that I store in the freezer.  I just take one out in the morning to make a great addition so a simple meal without having to bake each time.

This is so good that I made 8 loaves already this season for my neighbors and mail carrier. The 350 oven it calls for seems to be too high for my oven but 340 works great. I'm wondering about the suggested 10 min prep time though. Did Speedy Gonzales come up with that? Maybe I'm just slow, but even using the food processor, it takes me twice that long. Very tasty recipe though and I'm sure I'll make it many more times.

This makes very good, moist banana bread. I used 3 bananas and smashed them instead of cutting them.

This banana bread is delicious! I'm making all new recipes this month so when my bananas took a turn for the worse I knew I had to look up a new recipe. I didn't have any sour cream on hand so I used vanilla yogurt (and then halved the vanilla). Yum!

This bread turned out very very yummy. The only thing I changed was to mash the banana as I didn't want chunks of it in the bread. Thx for the tasty recipe.

Delicious banana bread! I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.  I left out the walnuts for my husband, but next time I'm putting them in for me! I think this would even be good substituting chocolate chips for the walnuts. Great recipe!

This banana bread turned out great for me!  I doubled the recipe using 5 bananas because I wanted a little stronger banana flavor (however, 2 bananas = exactly 1 Cup), I also added some cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg, allspice and ground cloves.  I also added an equal amount of lemon juice (extract) to the amount of vanilla extract.  I used mostly whole wheat flour.  I pureed the bananas instead of just slicing them and I creamed the butter together with the sugar (instead of melting the butter.)

Pretty good, and though I prefer dense banana bread, this isn't bad either. I wish it were more banana-y though.

This recipe ROCKS. I can't even tell you how much we love it at our house. The sour cream is definitely the trick. I add about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to mine sometimes as well. Yummy yummy!

This may be the best banana bread I've ever tasted. I know it's the best banana bread I've ever made. I substituted one six-ounce container of light vanilla yogurt for the sour cream, because that's what I had on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. Thanks, Virginia--and Janet!

This is by far the best banana bread receipe that you could make for you and your loved ones.  I took some of the advice of other reviewers such as using half wheat flour and half regular flour, adding chocolate chips, 1/2 tsp cinn, dash nutmeg, half white sugar, half brown sugar, and mashing 3 bananas instead of slicing 2 bananas.  My family cannot get enough of this receipe.  I make a loaf at least once a week sometimes twice a week.

I was leary about trying a new banana bread recipe (my fave is cathy's banana bread) but, this one was fantastic! Very moist, flavorful & very easy to make- I took the advice of others and thinly sliced the banana's and it's true that is was makes this recipe unique rather than mashing them. The presentation was wonderful it didn't sink in the middle like my other loafs. I only baked it for 45 min and it was perfect. This recipe is a definte keeper. Thanks!

There are hundreds of recipes on this site, but I chose this one because it consistently has 5 stars on its reviews. So I baked it, adding at total of 3 partially mashed and partially chopped bananas. Since I'm a big fan of cinnamon, I added a tsp of that and a little nutmeg. Bingo! I found the perfect banana bread recipe! Thanks for all the positive reviews to encourage me to choose this AWESOME recipe!

This banana bread is absolutely WONDERFUL!  I have made this several times and it always turns out great.  In fact, I am baking some now and wanted to come back here and comment.  The last time I made this, I made two loaves.  I was going to take one to work to share -- but you should have seen my husband's face when I suggested that!  He did not want to share!! :) Of note - now whenever he goes to the grocery store, he always comes back with a bunch of bananas.  Thank you for the best banana recipie ever!!!

Quick and easy to put together. Very tasty. I used a half cup of strawberry yogurt to replace the sour cream that I didn't have. It didn't take away from the taste at all.

I followed the recommendations to add a full cup of mashed banana's, used 1 tsp or baking powder and soda and used warm temperature butter instead of melted.  I didn't have an appropriate bunt pan so I made this recipe in muffin form.  That's all I did differently and it worked out perfectly.  I mean absolutely PERFECTLY!  They're so soft and moist, they're such goodness, even at muffin form!  Great banana taste especially.  Be careful not to overcook them.  Most banana bread I've tried usually has a dark brown crust, mine did not, if anything I would say it was a golden brown crust like many of the photos.  I would just be careful not to burn them!

My final tip - be warned!  If you make them in muffins you won't be eating just one.  If you're watching your weight I would advise you to skip this recipe or don't even eat any if you make it (good luck with the later)  This banana bread is over-the-top good, fantastic, oh-so-good-I-can't-stop-eating them awesome.  Bake them if you dare!

This was great!!! Very moist and rich in flavor.  My changes: substituted sour cream w non fat French vanilla yogurt, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg, used 3 medium mashed bananas, left out the walnuts.  It was even better after refrigerating overnight and the bread holds its moisture really well.  Very easy, mixed all by hand, and will definitely make again.  Saves me $3.50 at Starbucks!

This recipe was good, I have a recipe that I normally use but this was just faster with fewer ingredients. I of course had a couple minor changes, I had no sour cream but I've tried that greek yogurt and thats what it tastes like (yuck) so I used it. I ran out of sugar so I substitued for a little bit of brown sugar and I also had to add cinnamon, whats banana bread without cinnamon??? And I don't ever slice bananas for my bread, always mashed, (it's fun to squish!) This will be a recipe that I probably use more often than not, it was moist, it was delicious and it was super easy!

I’ve made this a few times before, but apparently forgot to review it.  I made a number of changes based on tips from other reviewers.  I creamed my butter and sugar (used half brown and half white sugar), used 1 3/4 cup flour, and added one teaspoon of baking powder, along with the baking soda and salt.  I also mashed my bananas instead of slicing them and used 1 cup.  This is great banana bread!  My only problem, and it’s minor, was I had trouble getting it to test done.  I had to bake mine for at least an hour and ten minutes and I still didn’t think it was quite done.  I did bake this in an 8x4” loaf pan because I wanted a nice high loaf, so maybe that was part of the problem.  UPDATE 7/20/13 - I made this as before but baked it in two smaller pans approximately 7"x3 1/2" for 40 minutes.  I also increased the walnuts to 3/4 cup this time.

Loved this recipe!  I used half whole wheat flour, replaced unsweetened apple sauce for the half of the butter.  No nuts...personal preference.  Still came out moist and rich.

I have never added a review about anything before and actually joined this site just to review this recipe. It is the best banana bread I have ever had. The sliced bananas adds a lot more banana flavor. I only had 1/4 cup of sour cream so I added 1/4 cup greek yogurt to it as well. The bread is so moist but not gooey. I also omitted the walnuts because my husband hates them in his banana bread but I am sure it would be delicious with them as well! The bananas did turn a little purple because they were sliced but that did not affect the taste at all. I recommend this recipe for everyone! :)

Excellent except for the sliced bananas.  They do turn purple and look a bit gross.  Tastewise, I would give it 5 stars but visually, it gets 4.

The first time I made this recipe, it was delicious.  I mashed the bananas and baked it for an hour.  The second time I made it I made a few changes.  1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, 3 bananas, 3/4c whole wheat flour and 3/4c white flour, 2 tsp vanilla.  I gotta say it was delish too!

This recipe is fantastic! I only made VERY slight modifications. I pureed the bananas since my bananas were VERY ripe, I replaced the sour cream with Greek yogurt, I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and used room temp butter to cream with the sugars. I also used my kitchen aid mixer on low speed the whole time, and it's delicious. This is the only recipe I'll be using from now on!

This was SO GOOD!  I made a healthier version, and it was so good I can't even imagine the original recipe is better!  I didn't have butter, so I used butter flavored crisco instead (a few more cals, but half the saturated fat and no cholesterol).  I used about 1/4 cup splenda, 1/4 white sugar, and 1/4 cup splenda blend brown sugar instead of the cup of white sugar.  I added a teaspoon of baking soda, a half teaspoon lemon juice (as suggested in other reviews), and pumpkin pie spice.  I used 3 egg whites instead of 2 eggs.  I used light sour cream instead of regular.  I skipped the nuts.  And then I baked it at 335 and took it out when it was just baked through but still very moist in the center.  YUM!!!  And I would guess this recipe saves about 600 calories overall, so 40 cals per serving :)  Enjoy!

This is the best banana bread I've ever had. I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them because I was looking for a smoother texture. I also didn't use any nuts and I added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and used 3 bananas instead of two. Topped it with cream cheese frosting. Delicious!

This bread turned out moist and delicious, but I did make a couple of changes.  I used softened butter (not melted), mashed the bananas (instead of slicing) used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, added a little cinnamon, and omitted the walnuts.  Yum!  It's a keeper!  Note that my loaf was done in 50 minutes, so make sure to check yours early!

YUM. This is so good! I used all whole wheat pastry flour from Whole Foods, half brown sugar, Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and I subbed chocolate chips for the walnuts. I also had three bananas so I used three instead of two :). Made them into 24 muffins, which makes them a nice little snack!

This bread is very moist and has wonderful flavorful. I noticed on some reviews that the bananas had turned brown...I tend to think they cut the bananas in chuncks. I cut mine like I were mincing, therefore they were much like mashed bananas. I simply cut them very small and this was still easier than mashing. I also used Kind Arthurs, wheat flour instead of white flour. Then I added a few more nuts. Cutting my bananas very small left no browning at all. In fact my bread looked like the picture and just simply looked good and tasted good as well. I will def. make again but when I do I may add just a bit less sugar. Thank you!

My heavens! This bread is soooo moist. I made 2 loaves,one with walnuts and one without. I found the loaf WITHOUT the nuts was the moistest. I was not real crazy using sliced bananas, as I always make banana bread with mashed bananas. So...I mashed half of the bananas and sliced the other half,made it a bit more moist. This recipe definitely is a keeper!

Hands down, the best banana bread I've ever made/had! I love the whole slices of banana instead of mashed. This recipe is also incredibly easy, fast, and made from ingredients that you always have on hand. Loved it!! Thanks for this one!

This recipe was great! Definitely the most moist banana bread I have ever had. I substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. Also, I didn't have any sour cream on hand, but used greek style vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream. I also read the other reviews and did add 1 tsp baking powder. The bread turned out beautifully - great texture and wonderful flavour. The kids loved it and I will definitely be making this recipe again. Thanks!

I made this bread a couple times this holiday season and it came out perfect each time. It's the moistest bread I've ever eaten. I think the trick is the sour cream, which you can't even taste. However, I did lower the baking time to 45-50 mins. I like the middle to be a little gooey and I have a very hot oven so usually I have to bring down baking/cooking times anyway. Add chocolate chips for a nice change. DELICIOUS!!

This is the BEST Banana Bread I have ever eaten! So moist and delicious. The first time I followed the directions exactly. Perfect! The second time I used pecan & added about a dozen chopped dates. Perfect! I am baking it again today and plan on adding mini chocolate chips. Why Not? Thanks Janet!

This bread was a winner with all at my house.  I didnt have any sour cream so I used low-fat vanilla yogurt which turned out well.  I also used others recommendations and mushed the bananas instead of slicing them.  We will definately make this bread again, it was super simple and delicious!*****UPDATE****** We didnt have any sourcream or vanilla yogurt so I had to use strawberry today and it still came out yummy :)

There is no better banana bread. This is IT! Outstanding. I used 4 very ripe bananas that I had in the freezer, mashed up. I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. I added a handful of coconut and 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice - also added a tsp of baking powder in addition to the baking soda. Made them into muffins, baked for 28 mins. THE BEST. SO GOOD!

Delicious!  The sour cream really makes it a light-textured bread.  I used 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar.  Mashed 3 large very ripe bananas.  Omitted nuts b/c of kids...but walnuts would be fantastic.  Next time I will try with nuts.  Will make again.

I did not have baking soda or sour cream so instead I used baking powder and milk.. I also have a huge pecan tree so I never run out.. instead of using walnuts I used pecans and I mashed the bananas.. next time I'll try sliced.. but it was really good.. i love banana bread =)

This was fantastic!  I gave the bananas a quick mash so they were lumpy, other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully. This is now my go to recipe for banana bread.

This bread was really moist!  The only thing I will try differently is reducing the amount of sour cream--it was a little too much for my taste (not much but I did notice).  I'll try 1/4 C next time.  I also mashed the bananas like all of the other reviewers said.  I am excited to try this again with the small change!

Fantastic!  I ran our of white flour, so used1 cup of whole wheat to replace it.  I had no sour cream, but after reading another review, substituted an equal amount of plain fat free yogurt (what I had on hand).  I put the batter into muffin tins, for easy, on the go breakfasts.  It made 12 very big muffins that took between 20 and 25 minutes to cook.  Next time I'll make 14 muffins so I don't have as much overflow.  These are amazing!  Lovely banana flavor and just the right amount of sweetness!

At the risk of being repetitive...great recipe, very easy and straightforward, makes yummy banana bread. Add a couple more bananas for more banana flavor and mash, don't slice.

Really good! I did use all the suggestions though (ie. 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, sprinkle of cinnamon, extra vanilla and bananas (and mash them)). Oh and I needed to increase the cooking time by 15 minutes.

Quick and easy, yet you don't have to sacrifice quality. I made the recipe as written with the bananas sliced. I'm only giving this 4 stars because I agree with the other reviews that you should mash the bananas and also add an extra banana. I made a half recipe and it made 2 mini loaves perfectly (baked for 30 min). This is the quickest banana bread recipe I have ever made and I will definitely be making this whenever I want a quick banana bread fix.

Very good banana bread but VERY sweet for my taste.  I made it the first time and followed the recipe exactly and it turned out lovely but very very very sweet.  Second time I only added 1/2 cup of sugar and it was perfect.  I find the bananas bring a lot of sweetness to the bread and the sugar should just to compliment it.  I also brushed the top (before baking) with 1 TBSP of water and 3 TBSP of brown sugar (mixed together) which gives it an extra crispy sweet top (like a very thin crispy glaze).  I added 3 large very ripe bananas MASHED (don't like the sliced idea) so I think I added 1/2 cup more than asked for; but I love a true tasting banana bread so I like the strong banana flavor.  I think next time I will follow the suggestion of adding 1/4 cup more flour to see what happens.  Thanks for the recipe!

Best Banana bread ive ever had!! I did do a couple adjustments. I wanted to double the recipe so did everything the same other than i only did 3 eggs instead of 4 and only 1/2 cup sour cream and prob about 1/8 cup heavy whipping cream. Then i added a dash of nutmeg, ginger and quite a few dashes of cinnamon then omitted the nuts and substituted chocolate chips.. yumm the moistest bananay things ive ever eaten with gooey chocolate chips oozing straight from the oven

Amazing!  I added chocolate chips too...yum.  I think I used too much pam on the pan because the sides and bottom of the bread was pretty greasy.  So, I'll go easy on the pam next time.

In order to make this recipe as healthy as possible I substituted the butter for 2/3 cup apple sauce, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar (next time I will use less sugar or unsweetened apple sauce) I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour. I added about 1 tbsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of baking powder. I substituted the sour cream for fat free plain yogurt and omitted the walnuts and added 1/2 cup of both raisins and cranberries. I mashed the 2 bananas and cooked it as suggested for an hour at 350 F= amazing and guilt free! =)

I made this tonight and it turned out DELICIOUS. I made a few modifications as I had to use what ingredients I had on hand. I used low fat vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream, brown sugar instead of white, half butter / half applesauce, and I used 3 bananas. Oh yeah I added dark chocolate chips. Eating right now as I type - SO GOOD!!

It was deliciouuuuus! I used yogurt instead of sour cream and used 1 cup of mashed bananas and wheat flour instead of all purpose, and I used 1/2 cup white sugar along with 1/2 cup brown sugar, and it turned out amazingly! Very moist but in a good way and sweet but not too sweet.

Fantastic bread....have made it three times- used 3 averaged-sized bananas (mashed).  Makes a very nice batter for a 9" loaf pan (2/3rds full).  Make sure you have greased your pan well or it tends to stick.  You can tweek this recipe all you want but it's pretty darn good originally written.  This recipe is about as good as you're EVER going to get, so don't look any further!

Just wonderful!  I cut the calories by using 1/2 Splenda and lite sour cream (I doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves), and it still turned out delicious.

LOVE this recipe!! Every time I make this it turns out great! I use unbleached flour, add ground flax seeds, and instead of using sour cream I add plain non-fat yogurt to make it healthier! Tastes yummy! I am definitely going to use this recipe to experiment with other fruits as well.

When I have some bananas ready this is the recipe I go to.  I cannot tell you how many times my coworkers ask if I have any bananas to make this.  They are hooked on how moist it is.  I even had one tell his wife that her bread was ok, but she needed to try this one.  Luckily he did not have to sleep on the couch that night and she asked me for the recipe.  I have added chocolate chips, dried cherries and pineapple before to make a Banana Split bread.  Yum!

This banana bread was delicious but I made a few changes to make it slightly healthier. 
1) replace 1/4 C. butter with 1/4 C. applesauce or other pureed fruit 
2) replace 1 C. of the flour with whole-wheat flour 3) replace 1/2 C. of sour cream with plain lowfat yogurt

I also mashed the bananas and added 1 tsp of banana extract for a more even and noticeable flavor throughout. 

Wait a day before eating and it's even moister!!!

Just fabulous.  I made it for my kids and they were literally scrapping their plates.  Because it's so moist, be careful not to over-cook it.  My first try was a hair darker than I would have liked but still tasted great.  The only thing that I added was a handful of chocolate chips and they added to the flavor in my opinion but certainly were not necessary.

This is an awesome, moist banana bread recipe. I often don't have sour cream so I use plain yogurt (fat free). And I use whole wheat flour as well. YUM!

Delish! Mashed the bananas and increased the amount used. Did not melt butter but softened to room temp. Use mixer to cream butter and sugar together. Also added bananas to the mixer to get them mashed and incorporated well. Everyone loved it!

Really good! I didn't have a 9 by 5 loaf pan so I cooked in a 7 by 4 and just had to cut off the edges because they got a little too crispy. i also used vanilla organic yogurt instead of sour cream and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top. I also mashed up the bananas and it was perfect.

I just made this recipe and my whole house still smells of sweet banana goodness. I doubled the recipe and my only change was using 1 c white sugar and 1 c brown sugar. I couldn't find 9x5 loaf pans so I got the disposable 8x4 aluminum pans. By doubling the recipe it yielded 3 8x4 pans filled all the way to about 1 inch from the top. I baked all 3 of them at the same time in the oven. This might have been a mistake because by the end of the hour they looked done on the outside but still very raw in the middle! Have no fear, I lowered the temp to 300 and baked them for about 30 more minutes. The tops got pretty dark brown but not burnt. I didn't have aluminum foil in the house, if I did I would have covered the tops to prevent further darkening. If you are making multiple loaves at the same time I would suggest extending the time and lowering the temperature for a more even bake. This recipe produces such a wonderfully delicious moist banana bread. I will definitely be keeping this recipe and will use it again and again.

Absolutely delicious! I mashed the bananas rather than slicing since I don't care for gooey chunks of banana in baked goods (used 2 lg bananas).  Used closer to 3/4c chopped walnuts since we love them.

After tasting batter, I added a couple sprinkles each of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves...just enough for a very subtle hint of flavor.  In my oven, it took exactly 55 mins, so may want to check your bread a few mins before the 1 hr bake time is done.

This will be the only banana bread recipe I use from now on.  Thanks for sharing!

I think that this will be the only recipe that I use for banana bread from now on.  I looked at the reviews and didn't melt the butter but added more banana as suggested.  Next time though I would add only another half a banana instead of a whole one.  It took much longer to cook but having said that it was still very moist and absolutely delicious.  Everyone loved it.

I made this using 3 mashed very ripe bananas and light sour cream, because that's what I had on hand.  The flavor was outstanding but it was a tad too moist (it crumbled at spots) ... I'm not sure if, because I added another banana, I should  bake it more (I did just one hour), or maybe that had something to do with the light sour cream.  I will definitely make again because it was the most moist banana bread I ever had ... I don't like dry banana bread at all.

Absolutely divine recipe.  I made it both with and without walnuts and they were both amazing.  The bread was super moist with a great banana flavor. Like others, the only change to this recipe was to mash the bananas instead of slicing them & sprinkled the baking pan with cinnamon sugar.  This was also quite easy to make and filled my home with the most beautiful aroma.  Thanks for the recipe; will definitely use this one many, many, many more times in the future.

Wow very tasty and very moist! This rating is from my 8yr old. **She had semi-mashed the bananas and to me, I think it made a mushy texture to it but she didn't seem to mind. So next time Im going to mash the bananas really good. Also, i had beaten the sugar with soften butter not melted. Update: Oh whoa, even better the next day!

Really nice banana bread! I found I didn't have any sour cream but did have fat free Greek yogurt (which in flavor and thickness is very similar to sour cream). I also mashed 3 overripe bananas rather than leaving them sliced. So easy to throw together and makes a really moist, flavorful bread. I usually add cinnamon and allspice to banana bread, and will probably do that next time for more flavor.

This bread was okay. Definitely moist, but pretty salty and not very banana-y...I would recommend trying unsalted butter. I used three over-ripe bananas, so I expected a great banana taste, but it just didn't deliver.

I just made this Banana Bread and came out great!  I decided to work off of a few suggestions listed below, which was: I creamed the butter and sugar together.  I added one egg at a time and mix before adding the next.  Make sure butter and eggs are room temp. before mix up.  Then I used 1 3/4 flour, 1 tsp. Baking Soda and 1 tsp. Baking Powder.  I mashed up the bananas before mixing into the main mix.  I baked in a 9x9 pan for 40 mins.  Turned out great!

My 3 kids and I thought this was the tastiest banana bread ever! Nice and moist, and absolutely delicious. Only small changes we made were room temp butter instead of melted, and plain yogurt instead of sour cream, which is what we had on hand. Yummers!

*Updated rating 11/28*
Made this recipe again but this time I stuck more to the original recipe as it is presented here. Changes I made - I mashed up three medium sized bananas and used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of the 1 cup of white,  and did not add the walnuts. This version was more true to the posted recipe and still turned out very good. I love how moist this bread is and everyone who tries it absolutely loves it. If you are looking for an easy recipe this one is it. 



Original Rating:
Followed recipe with the exception of mashing my bananas (used 4),, and added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg. It turned out super moist and yummy. This recipe is a keeper!

This just became my new standby banana bread recipe! So moist with great banana flavor. I could see how it would be on the sweet side for some and perhaps all the sugar explains why it browns so quickly and dark on the top. I tented mine with foil with about 10 minutes to go and will do it sooner next time. I also will cut back the bake time because I like my bread just a little underdone and sticky inside. I used three bananas instead of two and I didn't add the walnuts.

I really like to bake with honey whenever I can. So, I subbed 1 cup of honey for the sugar and used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil for the melted butter. I left out the sour cream. Well, between the honey and the oil, it was so moist and it had a great honey flavor too!~ The only thing I will do differently next time is grease AND flour pan, because it was a bit tricky unloafing and it broke a little. Good just the same though. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

YUM! The best banana bread I've ever made! My husband was impressed with the moist bread. I made two batches. One for my son's school - mini-muffins it made 60 mini muffins. I cooked them at 350 for 12 min. After we sampled a few I knew I needed to make more for the house. So I made 6 large rose cakes with another batch.   I did make some alterations per other reviewers. I did not melt the butter. I used room temperature butter and creamed it with the sugar. Then I added 1 tsp of lemon juice with the vanilla. I'm not sure that I noticed the flavor, so maybe I'll add a bit more next time. Finally I added 1 3/4 cups of flour. It really was perfect. This will be my go to recipe!

I have been making this recipe for a long time now. This time I changed it up some more by adding juice of 1/2 a lemon, exchanging the butter with equal amounts of applesauce and 1 and 3/4 C whole wheat flour (always use whole wheat).

This is by far the best banana bread ever.  I only added (changed) 3 things.  Per the suggestion of others, I added one more banana and mashed the banana's.  I also caramelize my walnuts by lightly heating them with 1 tbsp of salted butter and 1 tbsp sugar.  This is something my grandmother always did with any banana nut recipe.  The banana bread came out tender, moist and absolutely delicious.

I love this recipe!  I made it the other morning for my coworkers and it turned out to be the best ever!  I did some adjustments, however... I mashed the bananas (used three very ripe ones) and a little extra vanilla.  Once I poured the batter into the pan, I added a streusel topping made with brown sugar, flour, oats, cinnamon and butter.  This gave it a crunch topping and the oats added some very yummy flavors.  The girls at work said this was the best banana bread they had ever eaten!  Even my macaw (who is a banana connoisseur!) loved it. I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

This was so delicious, moist and flavorful. Instead of slicing the bananas as others have mentioned I mashed about 4-5 bananas, and substituted walnuts (as I didn't have any on hand) for pecans...I brought this to a brunch and they were an instant hit. Also since there was an abundance as I doubled the recipe, I placed this in a bundt pan and sliced them once cooled to indivdiual servings.

I think of all the basic banana bread recipes we like this one the best.  I've made it several times, but for some reason I've never reviewed it before! I usually tweak its a little by adding about 2T ground flax, using 3-4 overripe bananas, 1t cinnamon, subbing 1/2c whole wheat flour for the all purpose, decrease sugar to 3/4c.  I usually bake it in either mini loaves or a muffin tin since the large pan usually ends up cooking unevenly. It always turns out moist and not too greasy with a great banana flavor.  We love this bread!

Finally one I can keep---however I still mashed my bananas...somehow leaving the bananas "whole" and having chunks of bananas in the bread didn't seem right...and I think I'm right.  Double this recipe with no problems...thanks for sharing.

This is one of the best banana bread recipes I've tried.  I made it exactly as written the first few times and it was fantastic.  I made it last night and experimented a little...I added another banana and about 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I replaced 1/4 c of the sugar with brown sugar and the remainder I left as white sugar. It was even better than the original!  It came out even more moist than before because of the added banana.  I bake mine in a bundt and it only takes about 40 minutes.

Changes: 1) Used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown; 
2) Added some pumpkin pie spice; 
3) Used 3 bananas, mashed; 
4) Made mini-loaves which took about 45 minutes to cook. Not bad, but not a keeper.  I might try it one more time.

This recipe is awesome! I've never been able to make banana bread that turned out well enough to eat until this one. I will definately use this again. I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar as suggested in other reviews. Thanks for such a fantastic recipe!  I'm known as the banana bread queen now!

I was a liitle disappointed with the end result, but this recipe has potential with a few tweeks.  Several years ago in Maui, I had a slice of banana bread that had chunks of bananas in it.  I was hoping this recipe might duplicate the flavor and texture.  Close, but not quite.  I would like to mention that the bread came out very moist compared to other recipes that I have tried (probably due to the sour cream)  However, I think the oven temperature needs to be reduced.  Like another reviewer my bread also came out burnt on the sides and bottom.  I'm not sure if this was due to the fact that I used a glass loaf pan vs. a metal one.  I will probably try again at 325 degrees instead of 350.   I took the suggestion of several reviewers and mashed 2 bananas to stir into the batter.  I also thinly sliced one banana and folded into the batter before pouring into the loaf pan.   Will probably try this recipe again since hubby liked the flavor.

I have made this recipe several times and WE ALL LOVED IT!!! Soooo moist... I usually doubled it and used a 9x13 pan.  The only change I made was mashing the bananas instead of slicing and added chocolate chips to the batter.  YUMMY.  Thanks for the great recipe...

This is it! I finally found the perfect banana bread!  Not only is it delicious and moist, it is very easy to make. Bascially a "one" bowl recipe.  I wasn't too sure about adding "sliced" bananas vs. mashed bananas.  I thought there would be big chunks in the bread. I did use very very ripe (soft) bananas which I would do again.  You won't be sorry if you try this recipe.

Delicious, very moist, and tasty bread!  

I followed the suggestions of others- used half white & half brown sugar, used plain white yogurt instead of sour cream, mashed the bananas instead of slicing them, and added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.

Will definitely make again!

Veeery good. The sour cream gives this a great flavor and provides moisture to keep these from being dry. I made these into muffins and everyone loved 'em, however I do suggest skipping the slicing and just mash the bananas. The texture and appearance is much better that way.

Soooo moist and amazingly good!!  I puréed my bananas because I don't like chunks, the sour cream makes this bread so good. Be careful not to overbake it, it might look not done but that's just because it's so moist, it will cool ok. I'll make it again soon!!

I will admit upfront that I substituted many of the ingredients because I was attempting to make it lower in carbohydrates and less sugar as well.  Here are the subs:

-  1 cup Splenda (sugar sub) instead of white sugar
-  1 cup of whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup flour instead of all white flour
-  half a cup chopped pecans instead of walnuts
-  3 medium bananas, sliced instead of 2
- light sour cream instead of regular

It's in the oven as we speak, so I will give update when it's done.  It looks incredible!
Update:  It was okay but too dry and it fell apart!  I will follow more closely the recipe next time.  It had alot of potential had I left it alone.

This is the absolute BEST banana bread I have ever had.  It is very moist and delicious.  The banana slices appear as purplish-gray lumps, but they taste phenomenal.  I used fat-free sour cream and omitted the nuts in order to cut the fat.

This is a great recipe, my friends loved it and asked for the recipe. It's really good warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream - it tastes like dessert in a fine restaurant! Once I tried it with low-fat vanilla yogurt and it's even richer that way, though you may need to cook it longer.

Crazy good. Like others I modified it, but the basic recipe with few adjustments makes it your own. I have exchanged the walnuts for semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips and the sour cream for yogurt. Like others too, I've also increased the bananas to 3 (depending on size) and mashed them. I also soften the butter rather than melting it. If you keep extra butter quarters in the freezer, and move one from there to the countertop, softening happens rather quickly. I've also decreased the sugar a little, and I think if you're using sweetened vanilla yogurt and super ripe bananas, you'll get a good balance of sweetness.  I find this bread is more moist than other banana breads I've tried,  so if you're looking for a more breadlike texture with lower moisture, you won't find it here. This recipe is more akin to cake, but no less yummy.
Update - December 2017:

I've been looking for simple carrot cake recipe, but all the ones I've seen have been super complicated, but liking this recipe so much, I increased the flour a smidge, added baking powder, exchanged bananas for shredded carrots (2 cups), walnuts for pecans, and added spices (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg). It's delicious and it works! (although next time I might do 2 cups packed of carrots, for more intense flavor)  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe (more piquant).

WOW! FINALLY! A banana bread recipe that comes out as actual 'bread' and not a goopy mess! The trick to having a pretty banana bread is to soften the measured butter on the counter for an hour to two - DO NOT MELT IT - melted butter creates a dense baked good.... and I also use Country Crock instead of real butter only because we don't buy real butter and it's easier to work with. The softened butter trick is very common in baking, and makes a world of difference with a lot of baked goods, especially ones that need to be fluffy. I always measure & prep my ingredients before hand and never start mixing anything until I’m all set up because of how time sensitive combining some of these ingredients can be. Mix the softened butter & sugar with a blender for the fluff, and then mix in the eggs with the blender. Over mixing is not necessary, just until well blended. I would then mix the remaining ingredients by hand once you're ready to finish up. I also mix in the flour (sifted well) at the very end just before pouring into pans. I also keep my premeasured eggs & sour cream refrigerated until I'm ready to use them (except the butter). We mash our bananas and do not fold in banana slices as shown. This comes out VERY moist and forms a nice crust. Right before I put it in the oven, I make a light sugar & cinnamon mixture and shake that on the top and let it cook into the crust... yummy! I double the recipe and bake 2 at a time, and recommend adding about 10-15 minutes for 2 loaves.

Excellent recipe!  As one always should, read the reviews before attempting the firt time.  Mash the bananas, of course, and feel free to add an extra banana for extra flavor.  I added an extra banana and cut back the sour cream to 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup.  Also added 1/2 cup of ground flax seed, and a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Also, ditch the hand mixer and use a wooden spoon to mix the batter, you'll appreciate the hard work as soon as you take the first bite!

Made it exactly as instructed (except pecans instead of walnuts), and it was as close to a perfect loaf of banana bread as I've EVER had. I've tried several different recipes over the years, as it's my husband's favorite, but none come close to this one. Simple, but perfect.

I really loved this recipe. At first I was hesitant to use it though because I've never used sour cream in the making of banana bread. But boy am I glad I did! The bread turned out beautifully moist and was just absolutely perfect!  I decided to use 3 bananas instead of two though so that when I mashed them, it would measure to exactly 1 cup.

This has become my go to banana bread recipe.  It's easy, moist, and I enjoy the flavor.  The only change I make is to mash the bananas---it's more of a texture preference for me.  I use my mixer to mash the bananas, then I throw in the butter, sugar, and follow the rest of the recipe.  Great recipe, thank you for sharing! :)

I had high hopes for this recipe, especially after a top reviewer said this is Martha Stewarts recipe. The outside was getting dark, so I took it out of the oven. As it cooled the center collapsed. I turned it over to complete cooling, on a rack, and it near broke into 3 parts. I did use a non stick bread pan. The next day it was in even more pieces. It is a little sweet, too, honestly for my taste. Fortunately, I was not serving this to company, as it fell apart. I read reviews where others mention the browning on the outside before the inside. I have made a few banana breads from the site cake like ones and very moist ones, this in between that. However, they turned out taste and texture. So, not a repeat recipe. Wish this would have worked for me with all the good reviews! Even after I rated this numerous new reviews, a whole page worth, popped up from new members that joined the site just to review this particular recipe and rave it. I have not seen that many new reviews on a recipe of the day featured in an Allrecipes e-mail newsletter. Been interesting reading everyone's results.

This is the best banana bread recipe I've ever made! It is a moist bread which is what I wanted. Tasted even better the second day. Followed exactly other than the nuts. I wanted to make an extra loaf and the recipe doubled easily.
Thank you!

This recipe is fantastic! My first time ever making banana bread and this turned out to be delicious. I made one slight change to the recipe: I used less than 1/2 of the required sugar (so I used slightly less than 1/2 a cup). We're always trying to cut down on added sugar where we can! I also added one banana to the recipe, so 3 bananas in total. I must say, the reduction in sugar was not noticed or missed by anyone in our household. The bread turned out very moist with a rich banana flavor but not overly sugary- just the way we like it!

My husband loves my pumpkin bread, but now I think he is torn.  He loved this banana bread with his morning coffee.  I made it exactly as the recipe calls and it came out great.  It is as great as any bread I learned to make at Le Cordon Bleu.

Softened butter; mashed bananas, otherwise followed recipe to the letter......exquisitely moist. Mine was done in 50 minutes at 350. My daughter had 4 of her friends here and all raved about it.

This is delicious! I get asked for this recipe all the time. I add a little more banana than called for and sprinkle the top with sugar. I have made this with gluten free flour, as well, and it is still really great.

This is fantastic!! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I'm a firm believer that banana bread needs cinnamon!! Without it, it just seemed to be missing something. I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top and it was perfect :) I will definitely save this recipe, but next time I'll add the cinnamon in with the batter instead :) Thank you!!

Best Banana Bread - EVER!  I used naples34102's variations.  I finally found a 9x5 metal loaf pan, but needed to bake it longer than the 60 minutes in my oven (perfect at 30 min, turned pan half way, 20 more min, then lowered temp to 335 for 10 min - perfect).  Have Never had a better recipe.  Totally decadent when cream chest frosting is added!

I made this banana bread a couple days ago with a few changes and it was very good. I made it with room temperature butter instead of melted, three large bananas mashed rather than two sliced, 2/3 cup white sugar and 1/3  cup dark brown sugar rather than 1 cup white and 1 3/4 cup sifted flour rather than 1 1/2 cup flour. With the changes I made, I would rate the banana bread 5 stars. It was very good. I made some for my son's preschool teacher and she enjoyed it as well. I will definitely be baking this bread again, probably very soon.

Nice recipe.
I substituted the 1 cup sugar for 2-1/2 tablespoon of liquid stevia.  It's just as sweet without the calories.
I really like this recipe.

I used this recipe with some tweaks based on suggestions from other reviewers. I used 3/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar, mashed the bananas, and added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. I baked it at 325 for an hour, 20 mins. It was perfection! Moist on the inside with a little crunch in the outside.  I am notorious for attempting to bake for my fiancé and screwing up royally. This recipe was so quick, easy, and fool-proof. He absolutely loved it, and I shocked myself it was so good!

Janet - Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It is similar to may other breads, but I loved how moist the bread was.  Hubby even commented on it.  I didn't have sour cream ( I know - the key ingredient) but I subbed a mix of cream cheese and cream.  It was wonderful.  I will be getting some sour cream today and will bake another for friends.

This recipe is amazing. :D  I left out the walnuts, mashed the banana's into the mix, and added some: cinnamon, nutmeg, and a hint of clove.  It turned out incredibly good!!!  I highly recommend it.

The smell coming from my kitchen is so amazing right now! I must be in heaven! Will be eating the bread soon, it is still in the oven.
want to let you know that I went by the recipe completely, except that I added 1/8 cup of cocoa. Sorry, but it shouldn't change the flavor and texture too much!! I just really wanted chocolate. And I had self-rising flour, and natural cane sugar, but that won't matter, either. My bananas were so ripe they just squished out of the peel, so it's kind of in slimy chunks. It was a simple recipe, I like that, no fussy ingredients, just things I have in my fridge at all times. Will let you know soon how it turns out!!It's out of the oven.....waiting for it to cool.... Oh Wow!! It IS the moistest bread, thank you so much!! This recipe will become a go to from my kitchen!! I love the base ingredients, if I decided to use pumpkin, zucchini, apple, etc., it would work great with the proper spices, too. I can't wait for my husband and son to come home so they can enjoy this wonderful bread!! Love it!!

This bread was a hit with the family. I did not have walnuts so I used pecans instead. The bread came out moist a full of flavor. Great recipe and I will make it again. Thanks for sharing.

TOTALLY AWESOME RECIPE!!! Thanks for submitting it. This was by far the BEST and most Delicious Banana Bread I have EVER made...and I have made hundreds! It is so MOIST and freezes very well. Every one that tried a piece of this bread was like, " WOW, this is the BEST banana bread that you have ever made!" I do agree. The ONLY thing I would recommend is to mash the bananas instead of slicing them. Other than that, I would NOT change the ingredients one bit. I tried it with the sliced bananas and it had too many gooey pieces in it. You will not regret making this banana bread. Thanks again.

Fantastic recipe! Followed it to the letter except for using olive oil instead of melted butter and I also replaced 1/3 of the white flour with spelt flour.

After trying many recipes for banana bread that weren't so great. I am so happy to have found one that my whole family loves!! It is moist and delicious. I didn't feel the need to change the recipe at all although every once in a while I replace the nuts with chocolate chips for something a little bit different.

This banana bread is good anytime, morning, noon or night but I try to minimize my midnight snacks. Ive made a few B Breads but just seemed to be a little too dry after a day or two. This recipe gave me the recipe that solved the problem, Sour Cream. I also store my bread in an airtight container. Thanks Janet, where ever you are.

These were the best muffins ever. I would love to give it five stars but, I  changed some things in the recipe? I did half brown, half white sugar I used four bananas and the butter was room temp. I also added a streusel topping to finish. Also I baked them for 20 minutes at 325 degrees in a muffin pan. AWESOME!

I have made this at least 20 times.  I have done both the recipe as it is written, and made a few alterations -- they have all gotten rave reviewes.  It is the one thing my daughter asks me to make everytime I go to visit her, and when she was diagnosed with cancer, I altered the recipe to use stevia instead of sugar - I use yogart instead of sour cream and I use organic flour - again, still awesome.

this recipe is great .... my tweak was 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. sugar instead of 1 c. sugar; and I mashed 2 sm/med bananas and added that to the mixture; then cut up 1 banana to fold in before baking.  Best ever

I'm 13 and baked this bread and it was amazing! This was the second banana bread recipe I tried, the first one  just wasn't that moist and banana-y, so I looked for another one and found this one, and now I'll never look for another recipe for banana bread. I've only made this once and didn't follow the recipe perfectly or in other words I made some changes that other reviews have pointed out, ex. 1 3/4 flour, 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, mashed 3 bananas when the bananas were really over ripe, 1/2 cup of brown sugar 1/2 cup of white sugar, softened butter instead of melted, and I baked at 325. This was a super easy recipe and it was really moist and banana-y. Oh and a tip is if your bananas only have a few brown dots just put them in a paper bag with an apple and it'll ripen the banana, it only took my three bananas overnight to ripen, nd make sure to keep them together!

Followed another reviewers changes and made some of my own: Baked 45 minutes and it was done so check early!
Used 1 1/4 cup mashed bananas, 1/3/4 cups flour, one teaspoon baking powder in addition to the baking soda, used lite sour cream.  I didn't use nuts..didn't have them.  I didn't use an electric mixer at all.  I mixed the melted butter with the sugar in a large mixing bowl.  Then I mixed into that mixture the mashed bananas, sour cream, and last of all the eggs.  In a separate bowl I mixed the flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder.  I then dumped it into the wet ingredients all at once and mixed it just until everything was incorporated. No lumps!!! It worked!!!

I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them, put in chocolate chips instead of walnuts, and substituted the sour cream with yogurt. I also added some cinnamon (I put cinnamon in everything though), used baking powder, not baking soda and softened the butter instead of completely melting it for more fluffiness. I followed the rest of the recipe though and all the measurements. It was soooo good! Got eaten very quickly and I'm definitely making it again!

I gave 3 stars for just average.  Banana bread is a quick bread, not a cake.  I was disappointed with the very thing others seem to like about this recipe: it yields a bread with a find, tender crumb and not much flavor.  I like banana bread that has a robust, buttery crumb, a sweet crunchy crust and LOTS of banana flavor.  About 25 years ago, a co-worker named Mary Fisher gave me a recipe for banana bread that yielded just such a product.  I made it regularly for my family and others for years, long after Mary Fisher and her husband had moved away from our town to parts unknown.  I never shared that banana bread without receiving avid compliments and requests for the recipe.  Then one day when my daughter was making a batch of it, the recipe, still on the scrap of lined yellow paper that Mary Fisher had written it on, disappeared off the counter.  We looked and searched, to no avail.  I have spent the intervening years trying and discarding banana bread recipes (ok, not every minute of those years.  Just when we wanted some delicious, buttery, banana-sweet quick bread).  What I wouldn't give for another copy of that recipe.  Are you out there, Mary Fisher?

this is one of the best banana breads i have tasted- it absolutely was devoured by my hubby and all his friends who were visiting. i ended up having to make this three times in one week! however, i can only give it 4 stars because i don't like the idea of slicing the bananas. from my mother's teachings as i grew up and would help her bake, the bananas that were starting to go bad would be put in the freezer and taken out, thawed then mashed to make banana bread. i think mashing them turns out much better so you aren't biting into one chunk of banana and instead get the flavor in the whole loaf by mashing them and mixing them in. so that is my suggestion- mash instead of slice. the sour cream makes a HUGE difference in how soft & moist the bread turns out. i did not use walnuts because a friend has allergies, but did add some chocolate chips. top the baked bread with some cream cheese and this is a total treat!

Saw the last review was 3 years ago so thought Id update a new one! This is definately the best banana bread Ive ever made. Read reviews first so I mashed bananas instead of sliced and added cinnamon and nutmeg. Sprinkledd brown sugar on top which I had never done before but will be from now on! Added an extra sweetness and crunch to the top. Very moist, plenty of banana flavor and baked up beautiful. Awsome recipe!

Excellent! I mashed two very ripe bananas, used 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. brown sugar, doubled the walnuts, and added a big pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. Very flavorful, not too dense. Definitely a keeper.

This is an excellent banana bread recipe. It is not overly sweet. I followed the recipe closely but added one teaspoon of baking soda and about 3/4 cup of finely chopped pecans. With the addition of the sour cream, this batter is very soft and produces a delicate, soft banana bread. I also did cream the butter and sugar instead of melting the butter.

I have also made this recipe by melting the butter.  That method is easier, and quicker and produced gréât results. From now on, I'll just make this recipe as it is written........Delicious

This was amazing, but I also mashed the bananas because I dont like big pieces of banana. It turned out perfect!

This is a great recipe and easy to make.  I used splenda instead of sugar.  Also thought I had a loaf pan but did not.  Made mini muffins instead.  Baked at 350 for 15 minutes and they are perfect.

I have to agree with some of the other reviews.  The bread is light & fluffy, however I do not like the chunk of banana in the bread.  I'll stick  to my original recipe for banana bread which is a no fail recipe.  So I will not make this type banana bread again.

With the changes suggested by naples34102, this makes for a wonderful loaf of banana bread.  I've also had this turn out successfully after replacing the flour with white whole wheat flour and the sour cream with yogurt. 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg adds wonderful warm spice to the bread. Sometimes, the bananas are really sweet, so I can get away with using only 3/4 cup sugar. I have replaced as much as 1/4 cup white sugar with brown sugar at times. Love this recipe; it's a great way to use up brown bananas.

Really delicious and moist!  I tend to make changes to all recipes, but the changes to this weren't major.  I used oil instead of butter, and substituted 3/4 cup of a white sugar/brown sugar combination for the 1 cup of white sugar.  I also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  My oven is tiny and temperamental, so I cooked it for only 45-50 minutes at 350F.  Came out incredible!

I followed the directions perfectly.  The top of my bread is dry and the bottom (where all of the bananas SANK) is wet.   The taste is just ok.  I don't know why this recipe has five stars!

To anyone thinking about making it, I would try slicing the bananas in extremely tiny slices.

Great!  Here's what I did differently ... I added 4 frozen/thawed bananas so it's way more banana-y.  I didn't have baking soda so I used baking powder, it was white.  I added a teaspoon of lime juice but no walnuts just for taste preference and consistency.

I made this....IT WAS THE BEST! I did alter it a little by adding a teaspoon of cinnamon and added 2 extra tablespoons of sour cream to it. It was the best banana bread I've ever made! I will Continue to use this recipe from now on!

Oh so yummy! The only changes I made were adding 1 tsp of cinammon and a half tsp of nutmeg. Next time I will add more spice because I just love spice.

I made this exactly as directed except I used mini chocolate chips instead of nuts. I have to admit, I didn't care for the large chunks of bananas, if I made this again I would mash them. I checked on this after 50 minutes and it was already pretty dark on the outside but the inside was not done. It's almost burned on the outside, giving it a crunchy crust. I made two, one in a glass loaf pan and one in a metal pan and they both came out this way. The flavor is wonderful though and I hope that the family I baked the second loaf for doesn't mind having it a bit crispy on the outside and chunky on the inside.

Not impressed. I liked the sliced banana over  masehed, and I would do that with a different recipe. This was moist and I liked the texture, however it was lacking in flavor, and I added 4 instead of the 2 required bananas. It also had a weird after tasste. I will keep looking for the perfect banana bread recipe.

Tastes wonderful. However next time I will mash bananas rather than slice them. It looks unappetizing with grey pieces of banana in it.

Excellent recipe. You may want to consider a larger loaf pan, as it's quite a lot of batter and sometimes I have trouble with getting the loaf cooked uniformly all the way through. Sometimes I end up using foil over the loaf at the end of the baking time so the top doesn't burn.

Also...  I Always sub chocolate chips for the nuts. YUMMY!!

This is the only recipe for banana bread that I use now.  I do two things different, I use softened butter and mashed bananas.  The sour cream makes this bread so moist.  Because of this recipe I now add sour cream to every loaf I make.  Thank you, vjonsson!

This was a super easy recipe! I kept double checking to make sure I'd done everything! 
Changes I made:
Added a dash of cinnamon
Used 3 bananas (I love that flavor)
Mashed the bananas instead of sliced.

SO GOOD!!!!

This was easy to follow and it tasted great! I pureed my bananas like others suggested to do, the flavor was spread out evenly. It took a little longer to bake, about an hour & a half, but i think my oven runs cool.

I made these as mini muffins. Baked them at 350 for 15 minutes and they were perfection. I did add a little vanilla and cinnamon, but just about 1/4tsp of each. Easy and delicious, and I will make this again without doubt.

This came out quite good. I made the mistake of putting this into a 8x4 loaf pan and it spilled out all over the oven! Talk about a mess. Next time I'll be sure to use a bigger pan, or just split the batter into two 8x4 pans. Thanks for the tasty recipe!

This is the best banana bread I have ever made !!! So moist and delicious. This will be my all time favorite !!! I also mashed the bananas because I don't like chunks in my bread and I just put the walnuts lying on top. Its a "10" in my books !!!

This is the most moist banana bread I have had.  The only reason I give it four stars is that the sour cream appeared to subdue the banana flavor.  I used extremely ripe bananas and it didn't taste very banana-e.

Oh my lord this is a wonderfully dense, moist, rich banana bread. I made a few adjustments, though they are just preference. I added 1/2 cinnamon and a dash of ntmeg for extra flavour. I substituted the walnuts for milk chocolate chunks. I cannot get over how amazing this recipe was!!! Thank you!

I love this receipt just the way it is.  I didn't have the baking powder or the nuts but the bread turned out just fine. Can't wait to try it with the walnuts next time.

Just made this and it turned out great!  I used white whole wheat flour and 1/2c brown and 1/2c white sugar.  Also used some sunflower seeds because I didn't have enough walnuts.  Baked for about 52 minutes in my oven.  Moist and light - delish!

So good!  I mashed also...turned out perfect.  I made mini loafs and muffins as well, they all turned out great.  I sprinkled raw sugar on top for a pretty and fun crunchy topping.

Ahhh-mazing! My friends literally inhaled the loaf in 5 minutes. Crispy on outside and so moist on inside. I mashed the bananas and used reduced fat sour cream. I also had to bake it about 20 minutes longer than indicated. Will most def make this again, like tomorrow.

This is excellent.  Good banana flavor, not too sweet.  The sour cream does indeed make this rich and moist.  Be sure to check for doneness.  Mine needed additional baking time.

I'm not a banana bread fan, but the kids are!  I tend to judge it on appearance and texture.  This scored high on both and the kids finished it off, so I guess it tasted good, too!!

The best banana bread I have ever made.  Very moist and full of flavor.  I did mash the bananas because I have made it with sliced before and the texture wasn't right (I didn't like the clumps of gooey banana). I didn't have sour cream and used yogurt instead.  This recipe will be the only banana bread recipe I will use from now on.  Thank you for sharing it.

This banana bread recipe is devoured every time.  I mash the bananas though and usually add one more banana, but making it with two is awesome as well.  It's so nice and moist.

This is very similar to the recipe my grandmother and mother made for years.  The main difference is the addition of sour cream, which didn't make a huge difference, but certainly didn't hurt either.

I wanted to make it a bit healthier, so I substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour and used raw sugar.  I also added 2 tbsp of flax seeds.

I also followed another reviewer's suggestion to use 1 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder.

The bread came out moist and delicious.  It was a tad sweet for my taste, but that could also be because I used VERY ripe bananas.  Next time I will try it with a bit less sugar.  I also forgot the salt, but because the sour cream is salted, I found it didn't really need it.

I followed the recipe exactly except for a few minor adjustments.
1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour
added 1/2 tsp cinnamon
mashed the bananas
no walnuts since I didn't have any
substituted 3 tsp baking powder for baking soda since I didn't have have any soda

The bread was delicious! Very moist. Great banana flavor with a hint of cinnamon.

So good and moist! Rather than slicing the bananas, I pureed them in a food processor. Next time I will try adding another half of a banana. I will also keep a better eye on it while baking. I think 55 minutes might be better than 60 minutes.

Great tasting, but it's a good idea to let it cool a lot longer before transferring it to the wire rack. First attempt kind of melted through the wires. Wasn't pretty.

I replaced the regular flour with "white whole wheat" flour (100% whole wheat). I wanted to replace half the butter with applesauce but had none, so I put a peeled, sliced apple in the blender with some apple juice and tossed the bananas in as well. I was in a hurry so I made muffins, which baked in about half the time. Really good recipe.

I made mini muffins and adjusted the bake time -  15 mins at 325 seemed about right.  Left out the walnuts and topped each with a sliced banana dipped in brown sugar.  Kids loved 'em, construction workers loved 'em, nice texture and taste.  Thanks Janet!

This is a great recipe for banana bread, very moist.  I make it for dessert, potlucks, afterschool snack, and breakfast.  I used 4 bananas.  I added the sour cream with the other wet ingredients.  Add ins I like to use are almonds, chocolate or white  baking chips.  To make it special I bake it in a bunt pan and either dust the top with powdered sugar, or cream cheese frosting.

This bread is amazing! I followed the exact recipe, but I wrapped the loaf in tin foil and baked it at 325. It came out perfect!

This is the best banana bread I have ever tasted!  I read the reviews first as I always do and mashed my bananas but left some lumps and wouldn't you know??!!  Those lumps were PURPLE just like one of the other reviews I read.  Good humor!
But delicious bread!  I doubled the recipe and made it in a bundt pan.  Worked perfectly!!

I have never been a fan of banana bread, but, this recipe has changed that.  I had some very ripe bananas that had to be used or be thrown away so I searched this site for a banana bread recipe and made this.  Wow!  This is very moist and delicious.    Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was AMAZING!  Just the recipe I was hoping it would be!  I doubled it, used 6 frozen, ripe bananas (squeezed some of the excess liquid out), and added an extra 1/4 c. of flour.  I divided the batter between two loaf pans, one larger and one a bit smaller.  The smaller loaf came out perfect, but the larger loaf sank quite a bit in the middle.  I might try adding even more flour next time.  Can't wait to make it again!
*1/2012 - I added 3/4 c. of flour this time and both loaves came out perfect.  
*8/2012 - Added 1/2 c. flour... both loaves sank!

I made this yesterday and it was OUTSTANDING! I did not have yogurt so used about 3/8 cup whole milk instead and it was sooo moist. Used 4 large super-ripe bananas. Bake time was right at 60 minutes and my oven temp was at 340F. This is a keeper. I already have bananas getting over ripe as I write this, for the next batch.

OK... so this bread came out great, but I made the Martha Stewart modifications that were suggested in one of the other reviews: I made sure to cream the butter & sugar together WELL & then I mashed the bananas.  The sour cream really gives this bread a great flavor & texture.  I also added chocolate chips instead of walnuts to make it even more of a dessert.  My husband liked it because it was not too sweet (even with the chocolate) and the moist texture was perfect.  So, although I really suggest making the modifications others mentioned, the bread came out great!

What I liked about this was that it was not as sweet as most of the banana bread recipes I've tried.  I made it even healthier by using cinnamon applesauce in place of the butter.  I took another raters suggestion of using banana yogurt in place of the sour cream and added the lemon juice suggested.

THE PERFECT BANANA BREAD!  Stop searching, and use this one.  So easy and delicious.  I use a slightly thinner and longer bread pan (not your standard loaf pan) and the 60 minute bake time is perfect.  If you choose to use a standard loaf pan, you may have to adjust the time and/or temperature to cook the bread sufficiently--without over-browning or drying out.  With that being said, this banana bread stays moist for days.  Great with my morning coffee!  No need to adjust the ingrediants, flavorful as is.  PS, the sour cream is the secret.

WOW!! This is the best banana bread I've ever had. I added one more banana just for extra flavor, but didn't alter the rest of it at all. It was SUPER moist and my husband said it's the best banana bread he's ever tasted (even better than his mom's) I was very impressed and think that I will make this my #1 banana bread recipe.

Exceptional. This turned out perfects. I didn't mix nuts in it; I crushed a few glazed ones and added the crumbles to the top of the dough before popping it in the oven. Turned out nicely.

Easy and Delish!!  Mash the bananas, though!  The author commented later that she meant to say mash instead of slice.  Thankfully, I saw her comment before I started.  Otherwise it was perfect!!  Truly the best banana bread our family has ever had!

This is my go to banana bread recipe and I have been asked for the recipe numerous times. It really is delicious and moist. My only change has to do with the actual baking. I find the top gets too dark before the middle gets cooked at 350, so I knock the temp back to 325. Thought it might have just been my oven, but we have recently moved and I am finding this to be true on this oven as well.

If I could, this rating would be 10 stars. This is the best banana bread ever! I did mash the bananas and used 4 but everything else was spot on. Warm or cold it was great. The loaf isn't even gone yet and my husband is wondering how soon I will be making more! I think he is going to hide the rest of the loaf for himself!

LOVE this recipe! this was my first time making banana bread. I had a lot of bananas at home that I knew were going to go bad soon so I decided on this. I didn't have the right pan so  Instead I baked them in a cupcake pan. It worked great the only change was the bake time to 20 min since they cook a lot faster in the cup cake pans. thanks for the recipe!

This shi* is bananas - b-a-n-a-n-a-s! I mean that in a good way, of course. This banana bread is ridiculous(ly) good. I was a little nervous about the addition of sour cream, I've never made banana bread with that ingredient. However, it was perfect! The loaf was sweet, moist, and fluffy. I added an extra banana which, wasn't my brightest idea. My loaf almost fell apart when I took it out of the pan since there was too much banana to hold it together. However, what it lacked in aesthetics, this loaf made up for in taste! More, please!

I love this recipe! The bread is so moist and tastes delish! I follow it exactly with the exception of this weekend. I only had one banana and made it with that banana mashed up and added a small container (one of the lunch box size) of apple sauce, mixed it with the super mashed bananas and added that to the mix. Came out excellent! So even if you just have one banana it can work!

This is how Banana Bread should be.  The only changes I made were that I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar and mashed the bananas.

I followed the recipe with the exception of mashing the bananas. I made it twice and both times it fell and sank in the middle. What am I doing wrong?

I can't give this receipe 5 stars because I goofed and added 1 cup of sour cream,  I also smashed my bananas (3) and left out the nuts.  My goof was a big hit.  I'm off to try it with substituting 1 cup of yogurt for the sour cream :)

THE BEST BANANA BREAD RECIPE I'VE EVER TRIED!  This is now the only recipe I use for Banana Bread. I loved it so much that I gave the recipe to my Mother (who has made banana bread all my life) so that she could start using this recipe instead of the one she has been using.  I don't know how it happens but the top of the bread gets a little crispy crunch topping and the inside stays moist and flavorful.  YUMMO!!!

I was not a Banana Bread fan at all, but I am now!!! It was so moist and delicious!  I roasted my walnuts for extra flavor and mashed the bananas, turned out great.  For fun, I drizzled a little icing on it.

Easily the best banana bread I have ever made!  Followed the recipe exactly, except I used 3 bananas mashed instead of sliced.  60 mins was the perfect time.  Golden on top but moist inside.  Awesome!

A delicious & easy recipe! I doubled this recipe to make one for a friend & it turned out great!!! It was moist, cut nicely & held together.My friend raved about hers! Like many of the other reviewers, I changed a couple of things: I didn't have any sour cream in the house, but I did have a cup of banana yogurt. I used 4 bananas, mashing 3 & slicing 1.  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup for each loaf.I feel confident that had I followed the recipe exactly as given, the banana bread would have turned out just as great as the two I made. There is nothing remarkable or unique about the recipe.  It has no magic ingredient to make it stand out from any other recipe.The success or failure in a banana bread is usually the result of either the ratio of the fat, the flour, & the liquid AND the cooking time or all of these variables. When a recipe calls for an exact measured quantity of banana (1 1/2 cups), it can be more consistant than adding 2 or 3 large or medium bananas.  Cooking times really affect whether it is going to be perfectly moist, too dry, or mushy.I slightly increased my cooking time because I had 2 loaves baking at the same time.If the recipe calls for a loaf pan - use a loaf pan and not a cake pan. It's not that it won't work, but the time in the oven needs to be adjusted.If any one thing is changed, it may change everything else.  It sounds like a lot of reviewers are making smart substitutions with great success, while others are doing something wrong.It was so yummy!

I made this today while waiting for Hurricane Irene to arrive in NJ. I made exactly as written but added a third banana. It was very moist and I didnt think it was too sweet like others had said. Thanks!

Very good.  It will become my standard recipe.  Used 3 bananas and 1 3/4c. flour.  Daughter-in-law requested chocolate chips, and that was great, but next time I will use the nuts instead.

This recipe is so super simple!  If I'm out of sour cream, I add milk 2T at a time until I get the right consistency and it works out just as well.  Typically, I omit the nuts and add a bit of nutmeg.  It's so moist with a a crunchy outside - perfect, just the way banana bread should be.  :)

This is the best recipe I've found for banana bread. I usually make as is, but I do suggest light sour cream and, as others have written, it's best to blend the bananas rather than slice them so they aren't brown/gross. I usually add them after the eggs and have had no issues. For a slightly healthier recipe, this works with half wheat flour or even half oatmeal and you could probably substitute half applesauce for the butter. I've tried all oatmeal for a gluten free recipe, but it turns out too moist and is only good for a day or two in the refrigerator. This is also best if you use half brown sugar rather than all white sugar. Again, very good. Thanks Janet!

Fantastic!! The sour cream adds a richness to the banana bread.  I add a bit of chocolate chips for fun.  Really ripe almost black banana's make the bread taste better.  Thank-you!!

I’ve made this many times and it deserves all five stars (Maybe four if you slice the bananas because they are rather unattractive.) I have grown accustomed to mashing the bananas and adding half a teaspoon of cinnamon but that’s just my preference, also I bake it for 55 minutes instead of the full hour because I like it very moist, but if you follow it exactly as written you will be happy

The best banana bread ever, hands down. I double the bananas. It's also really good with bananas AND blueberries! There will never be another banana bread recipe in my house. This can't be improved upon!

So. Good.  I always add as much baking powder as soda so that it's nice and fluffy in addition to being moist.  I make large batches when I have extra ripe bananas and freeze it.  Thaw it the day of a big event, bake like normal and comes out great!

So yummy. I did have to bake it for about an hour and fifteen minutes, though. I'll definitely use this recipe from now on.
Also, with help from other comments, I added a tsp of baking powder, and used 1 3/4 c flour. The bananas (mashed) should be about a cup.

Didn't have enough sour cream and saw that someone had used strawberry yogurt so I ended up using the blueberry yogurt that I had. I also didn't use butter.. used applesauce instead and it was great. Oh.. also cheated by using self-rising flour and omitting salt and baking soda. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.

Janet's Rich Banana Bread Haiku: "So close to perfect. But bananas should be mashed. Otherwise, so good!" I gave up on reading through reviews b/c it was nearly unanimous - the mashing instead of slicing bananas - so I did just that, along w/ creaming room temp. butter w/ the sugar. I doubled the recipe for 2 loaves (1 for teacher appreciation day, the other for me to inhale) - and wow, did I toss back some banana bread! I think the sour cream is the magic element to making this so moist, so delicious, and so nearly perfect, if it wasn't for the recipe calling for the bananas to be sliced and not mashed.

This banana bread is phenomenal! No more store bought banana bread for me! If you have some ripe bananas this is an easy thing to whip right up. It's moist and soft. I can't find words to describe it except it satisfies my love for banana bread!

WOW...Wonderful Banana Bread,...Better than my mom's and her's is really good but this is EXCELLENT! Very moist. I followed recipe exactly except my bananas were really ripe and soft so I just mashed them up a bit instead of trying to slice them. I think the over ripe bananas gave it more of a rich banana flavor. I also added extra walnuts. YUM! Thanks for a great recipe.

I've been searching for YEARS for the perfect banana bread recipe, and this is it!!! I followed the recipe exactly, minus adding the walnuts - I like my banana bread either plain or with chocolate chips! This bread is amazing - totally moist without being too dense, perfect banana flavor without being overpowering, crisp but soft crust... just fantastic. Don't bother looking any further, this is the recipe you want!

Excellent! Very moist and no spices needed! I added chocolate chips and omitted the walnuts because of a nut allergy of a guest, but next time I would add both walnuts or pecans and chocolate chips.

This was really good, my husband pretty much ate the whole loaf within an hour of it being out of the oven. Next time I will have to double the recipe so that the rest of us get more than 1 slice. My husband said it is the best banana bread he has ever had. This recipe is a keeper!!

I divided the batter into 2 small square pans and baked in a convection oven. I could hardly wait for this bread to cool. My bread was ready in 12 minutes. I drizzled a RUM glaze over the slices as I served the bread. It was great without the rum glaze, but I want a glaze over the servings. Also I used 3 black bananas. I can not wait to make this bread again.  Excellent!!

This may be the best banana bread I have ever had.  I used three mashed bananas, and room temperature butter.  It is super moist and tender, with a nice crust on the outside.  This is a winning recipe, and I don't think I need to search for anything better.  The sour cream really makes it.  I normally don't post a review right after trying the recipe, but I ran to the computer for this one!

It is very moist just as most reviews said. I substitued greek yogurt for the sourcream. The only negative I have is that it seemed to burn slightly on the edges before the center was done.

This is so good and so easy.  Will definately make this again and again.  It makes a size that is perfect for the 9x5 loaf pan.

This was a very easy recipe but did not have as much banana flavour as I like.  Next time I will add some vanilla and use more banana.  Overall a good banana bread though!

I made this for my husband and he thought it was pretty good bread.  I left out the walnuts, added a healthy sprinkle of cinnamon and mashed three bananas.  I think I'll try a different recipe next time and see if he likes that recipe better.

Very moist and great flavor! I only had 1 egg, so I added a bit of baking powder, and a dab more of sour cream. And also didn't have walnuts, so I used chocolate chips instead. Very, very good. First time I've made banana bread. Will make again for sure! Thank you!

I chose this recipe because I had only 2 bananas to use up and some sour cream, so thought I'd give it a try. I used a stand mixer to make the bread and smashed up the bananas rather than using slices because I didn't want big chunks in my bread. It was a very moist and delicious. I wouldn't say it was the all-time best, but I'd use this recipe again if I had the correct ingredients.

Added 3 bananas versus 2 bananas.  It is very moist and delicious.  I cant wait to make it again as the sigle batch is not enough to share and enough left overs for me.

This banana bread is so moist and rich!  I make it exactly as directed and it's so yummy!  And it makes the house smell great while it's baking!  I keep making it for friends and they've all told me it's the best they've ever had.  It's the sour cream, but I haven't admitted that to anyone yet.

The husband is licking his fingers right now after eating three pieces of this warm bread.  I used hand mixer for butter and sugar, about 1 1/4 c. banana (mashed with a fork) and used A&E plain classic Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  Don't hesitate...make this bread.  Your house smells heavenly while it's cooking.  I'm making it again tomorrow.

Loved this! I only made minor changes: mashed instead of chopped the bananas and used mini-loaf pan with 8 small loaves instead. This shortened cooking time to about 25-30 minutes. Stayed moist and delicious! Friends at work are asking for more!

Great!  Came together incredibly quickly, with just ingredients I had lying around, and tasted fantastic.  I used three bananas and mashed them instead of slicing, but otherwise I used the recipe as-written.

AMAZING!!! This is my favorite banana bread recipe! The sour cream gives it an extemely moist, rich texture. I sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on top about 15 minutes before it was done to give it a crunchy crust. My family raves about this bread! :)

Great bread,  I put 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  I also didn't add the nuts since I didn't have any.  This is the Banana bread recipe I will be using from now on.

This reminded me of the banana bread you can only get a the church bazaar or at the market...I baked as per and it was perfect!  We had the worst snow storm in 25 years in our region the day before I bough the ingredients to make this.  So glad I did as it was a nice treat being we couldn't leave our drive way!

This is the best banana bread ever!! I did follow other reviewers and mashed the bananas, baked at 325 for an hour an 15 min, and added about a half a bag of milk choc chips and it was heaven!! OMG I will be sharing this with family over the holidays!

Four stars for perfect ingredient ratios, five if the method was slightly different. Like others, I cream the butter and sugar for a good 5 to 7 minutes rather than melting. I always mash up the bananas rather than slice them and mix them up really good with the sour cream. And like other recipes that include nuts, I toss them in the flour to coat so that they don't sink in too much.

There were 2 gorgeous loaves in my kitchen an hour ago and they are slowly dwindling away.....   This recipe is fantastic!  I was so please with it, I took a pic and posted it on Facebook as quite possibly the best banana bread I've ever made!  I followed the recipe but mashed the bananas instead of slicing them.  Also, there was a TON of batter, so I split it between two smaller loaf pans and baked it for 45 minutes instead of 60 and it turned out PERFECT.  Start baking- you won't be disappointed!

This recipe is DELICIOUS! I followed what one review said about adding 1 tsp of lemon juice with the vanilla and using 1 and 3/4 cups of flour plus adding 1 tsp of baking powder AND (my personal touch) I added 4 dashes of all spice - YUMMY! This is the best banana bread I've ever made and the one recipe I will always go back to. :)

My boyfriend and I both loved this banana bread. It stayed moist and had a nicely, distinct banana flavor. I also mashed the bananas per the suggestion of other reviewers.

I am one of those people who usually substitutes applesauce for part of the oil or butter, but this time I went all out with the fat and sugar to see what I might be missing.  This recipe is very sweet and rich with a cake-like texture. The banana flavor was more subtle (or covered up by butter and sugar?) than a regular banana bread recipe.  I guess I learned that I get more banana flavor by using less fat & sugar.  This recipe leans more in the direction of banana cake than a quick bread.

I have made this multiple times, and it always comes out perfect!  I usually add 1 cup of chopped walnuts instead of 1/2, and 3 bananas instead of 2, while keeping all the other ingredients the same.  So moist and delicious!

This was soooo good. My mom threatened me if I didn't leave her a copy of the recipe. I followed the recipe as written except used 3 bananas (they needed to be used!), mashed them and I added chocolate chips in place of the walnuts. Soooooo good and moist with a beautiful crust, just like the picture.

Delicious! Moist and melts in your mouth! Mashing the bananas and using room temp butter is definately the way to go.

The best I ever had and this is my first time making banana bread so didn't think I would do that great. Followed exactly as written but added Hershey's dark chocolate chips and a little less nuts....oh and 3 bananas instead of 2.

I doubled the recipe and decreased the sugar amount a bit. Added cinnamon and used room temperature butter instead of melted. I used half yogurt and half sour cream due to what I had on hand. I also used frozen bananas that I eyeballed, didnt measure. Instead of walnuts, I used peanut butter chips which made them so delectable!! It came out sooo moist and delicious, especially with the addition of the peanut butter chips!! yummmmm!

A really good, moist banana bread. I added 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and a 1/4 tsp of cloves. It was the best banana bread I've ever made.

This is a fantastic recipe! I did substitute plain non-fat greek yogurt for the sour cream, but I doubt that changed the flavor. It came out beautiful. My daughter says it is the best ever!

Very good, I also followed other recommendations and mashed the bananas.  Had to use pecans instead of walnuts and it was delicious!  Used half sugar half Splenda, egg whites and low fat sour cream.  Less calories and still super moist and yummy!

Very good recipe, I also mashed the bananas and used light sour cream.  I aslo reduce the oven temp in the last 15 minutes by 25 degrees as the top was cooking quickly. i added walnuts to top and only a few in the bread, as I am not a big fan of walnuts.

Best recipe I have found and I have made several. TIPS: Like many of you, I take over-ripe bananas and put them in the freezer.  Before starting the recipe, take them out and place them in a bowl of hot water.  By the time you are ready to add them, they don't need to be sliced or mashed because they are ready to go (Beware, they look pretty bad and gooey, but they taste and work perfectly.)  ALSO, I use a KitchenAid mixer to mix melted butter, white sugar, eggs, and vanillla extract.  Works perfectly and DOES NOT adversely affect the taste or texture in my opinion and when you are finally ready to add bananas, it does all the work for you.  FINALLY, I made this recipe in muffin tins.  It took 18 minutes to cook 15 muffins (which is what the recipe made) and they were perfect for the on the go snack, breakfast, dessert, whatever.  These tips are to aid in making the recipe itself.  The ingredients are flawless on their own.  I would not and will not change a thing!

This is my go-to recipe for banana bread. It comes out perfect every single time I make it. It's so moist and delicious without being overly heavy. It works well plain, with nuts, or with chocolate chips. Excellent recipe!

What a great recipe! A very dense moist bread with a nice brown crust.  I replaced the walnuts for choc chips, although both would've been good!  I didn't have quite enough sour cream, but I used an extra banana so that made up for it.  When I was mixing up the sour cream and banana in the last stage I kept thinking how gorgeous the batter was.  Very velvetty. Delicious, thank you! EDIT: I'm pretty sure you can't mess this recipe up! Last night I ran out of sugar so subbed 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar, no problem.  Great with/without walnuts & choc. chips.  Just a note mini chocolate chips worked better for me they didn't fall to the bottom. Update 10/19/10 Last night I made this as double-chocolate banana bread with 1/4 cup of cocoa subbed for the flour.  I also used 1/4 cup of applesauce as my bananas were a little small.  Added choc. chips and voila double chocolate banana bread!  I don't think you can mess this recipe up, I've sometimes had too little sour cream, no problem!

I made this bread on two occassions.  First, in order to be fair and honest with rating this recipe I followed it exactly as written.  So easy, moist and delicious.  This recipe is a keeper.  Now, my recommendations:  I mashed the bananas rather than slicing them.  I added one teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix.  I used pecans rather than walnuts.  Lastly, I sprayed a 9 x 5 loaf pan with canola oil and dusted it with cinnamon and sugar. OH SO GOOD!

This was so good!  I used 3 bananas instead of 2, and replaced half the sugar with splenda.  I'm pretty wary of cooking with sugar substitutes, but this worked perfectly and made it a little healthier.  My only caveat is not to leave it too close to the edge of the counter if you have dogs -- learned that the hard way!   
Edited 3/12/10: I made this again, this time using 1 cup wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour.  Worked well.
Edited 12/19/11: I have made this dozens of times now. Usually use real sugar, half brown sugar and half white sugar, half white flour and half wheat flour. Also, consider replacing the sour cream with plain, fat free greek yogurt. Just as moist and rich, with fewer calories and more nutritional value.

I can finally stop my hunt for the perfect banana bread, because here I have found it.  The only things I change is that I use softened butter (rather than melted) and I mash, rather than slice the bananas.  I usually double the recipe - and still wish that I had more.  I'm going to have to buy two more loaf pans so I can quadruple the recipe!

I've made this recipe twice so far and each time it turned out great! I always substitute Smart Balance Oil for the butter, increase bananas to 3, use 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2/3 cup white sugar add 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 cup pecans(sub for walnuts), and then top it with wheat germ and more pecans. Amazing!

OMG This is the best banana bread I have ever made I made a few changes I uaed four bananas instead of two and I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. I made this recipe for a bake sale at work and boy it was a big hit. Then I made it again a week later and my husband took the bread to work and once again it was a big hit. Everyone that has tried this bread wants the recipe, This recipe is a keeper thanks for posting.

After reading reviews, I made some changes before making this recipe. The changes I made are: I used softened butter instead of melted, 1/2 cup brown sugar to replace half of the regular sugar, added lemon juice, doubled the vanilla, used 3 eggs instead of 2, added a bit of spices, used 3 smaller bananas that I mashed up, and final change, I put an extra 1/2 cup walnuts in the blender and made some nut butter out of it and mixed it in. Just a few difference, I know! Lol. But it came out Wonderfully! I think I could have added more walnuts though, personally I like a bit more crunch and nutty flavor. Aside from that, Perfect!

Absolutely Awesome!  Did make the changes others recommended but also mash some of the bananas and chopped some.

Very Tasty bread. After reading over the other reviews I made the following revisions: room temp butter, 21/2 cups flour, bake at 325' for 75min. Instead of mashing bananas: freeze the bananas that are getting over ripe (in the peel). Then when you're ready to bake bread, simply defrost the bananas for approx 1 hour at room temp, snip off the end, and squeeze the pulp into the mixing bowl. I got this hint from a friend years ago, and it works great! The freezing process helps break down the banana and avoids needing to mash since once thawed again, it is mushy pulp.

I've been making various banan breads for years- and this is my new favorite! (with a few changes) softened butter instead of melted, mashed banana instead of slices.  a little extra vanilla, several sprinkles of cinnamin, and a tiny sprinkle of nutmeg.  I dusted the oiled pan with cin/sugar mixture to give the crust some sweetness.  the top does not go mushy when you store it.  will use again and again. thanks.

I made this recipe for my mother-in-law who always has some comment on how to make my food better, but this time she called and raved at how wonderful this bread is.  Even my 13 yr old daughter thought this was the best bread ever.  I guess we have a winner.  I did not slice the bananas since you want the flavor all through the bread I just put the whole bananas in with the butter sugar mixture and beat them in.  (Really not sure I want chunks of banana in it since they discolor if not eatten quickly.)  Other than that this recipe is Mother-in-law, teenager approved.

This is very good!  I liked it best after it had sat a day rather than warm out of the oven.  I thought the flavors really came together then!  Some changes I made after reading the reviews.  Use 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. 3 bananas instead of 2 and mush them. I cream the softened butter with the sugar (not melted). I add 1 tsp. lemon juice with the vanilla, and use 1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder, and 1-3/4 c. flour.

Moist and delicious!  There is no way to mess this one up.  I usually over bake my banana bread and it comes out dry but adding the sour cream to this practically guarantees it will be moist.  I tweaked the recipie ever so slightly.  Instead of melting the butter, I creamed it with the sugar.  I also mashed 3 small bananas, which measured out to 1 heaping cup.  I added a dash of cinnamon and a tiny pinch of ground cloves.  It is the best banana bread I ever made according to my 5 year old!  Thanks for the recipie.

WOW!!!  This is soooo good!!!  I just got done making this and it is fabulous--my husband even said it's better than his mom's.  The only change I made was mashing the bananas and adding some cinnamon, nutmeg, and ground cloves.  I also dusted the pan and top of the loaf with cinnamon and sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This bread is TOP NOTCH! I made it a bit healthier by using 1/2 whole wheat flour and half unbleached all purpose, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 of a cup (used half white sugar and half brown) and subbed half apple sauce/ half butter. I also used low fat sour cream. I added a bit of cinnamon too- just because i love cinnamon. Even with all these changes- this bread is great, moist, not too sweet, great flavor and i made it much healthier! Thanks for a great recipe...

One day I decided to conduct a taste test between 2 banana breads.  This one had a higher rating from this site, but less reviews than the other I tried.  Without a doubt, this recipe won, hands down.  I had four people try the two and they all agreed.  This is a great recipe!

this bread is amazing! i substituted with whole wheat flour, and it did not come out dense at all. i followed other reviewers suggestions and mashed the bananas. i also used the mixer for creaming the butter and sugar, then mixed the rest by hand. i baked for 1 hour and 15 minutes and it was perfect. i've already made it twice this week and plan on making more! wonderful recipe! UPDATE: I made this into mini muffins and regular sized muffins. The minis bake in 15 mins and the regular sized in 20 mins. So much faster! Plus each piece gets a bit of crispy crunch. I added pecans and chocolate chips (1/4 cup each). Still amazing.

Chopping the bananas into 1/2 inch dice helps eliminate the weird banana "pockets", but this is still too sweet, in my opinion.
Tasty for the kids,though.

I thought this bread was just above average. I agree with folks that it is VERY moist and heavy. If you follow the recipe exactly I think it is a little bland. I added 3/4 t cinnamon. Definately mash the bananas up. My husband and I weren't fans of them just being sliced and folded in. If you like fruit chunks in bread then it is ok to leaving them sliced. I'd make it again with some alterations

I've made this several times, so I thought I'd write a review.  Easy to make, simple ingredients, and the first time I made it was for breakfast (for just 2 of us), and 1/2 the loaf was gone by noon.  I did smash instead of slice the bananas because that just didn't seem right to me.  Yum.

This is really and truly a fabulous banana bread!  I've made it with sour cream (full fat) and with fat free Greek yogurt and both are delicious!  I have also made this recipe as muffins with the topping from To Die For Blueberry Muffins and what a smash hit!  Thank you for sharing!

I doubled this recipe to make a couple more loaves, as I had four bananas I needed to use up. This recipe was great because it used all four. It made two full-sized loaves and two mini-sized loaves. With the mini-loaves, I sprinkled
cinnamon-sugar on the top and swirled it with a knife. Other than that, I made no changes.
This bread turned out incredibly moist, rich and fluffy. Really, really fabulous. EDITED REVIEW: I now make this with half the sugar, whole wheat white flour, and half applesauce for part of the butter. Instead of walnuts, I use pecans. It makes GREAT muffins! Usually, I get 16 muffins out of one batch.

Only I could not spray a pan properly. Went to shake it out of the pan, it flopped out leaving the crust stuck to the pan! LMAO! Regardless, this is the best, very moist banana bread recipe I've made. It was so good we still picked away at it. Not a crumb wasted.  No need to keep looking for the perfect one any longer. Can't wait to make it again and eat slices! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was great! I left it in for 60 minutes because the middle seemed to be mushy, but then I ended up burning the outside (but I cut it off, no problem). I'm a beginner baker. :) I strongly encourage everyone to remember that when you use a non-stick pan to reduce the temperature by 25 degrees! But what a great recipe- I mashed the bananas as recommended instead of slicing them and I added a bit of cinnamon. Yum!!

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would!!! It's fabulous - I've made it twice in one week... my husband adores it, too! I gave the recipe to my mom and she raves about it to all her friends now... I mashed 2.5 bananas instead of slicing 2... other than that, it's exactly how it should be... 55 minutes later, you have perfect banana bread!

With the econ, I am trying to use everything in the fridge and waste nothing. So with sour cream, 3 bananas, and 2 eggs around, I gave this recipe a try. Perfectly moist! I made a few changes such using 3 bananas instead of 2, added cinnamon, and used 1c all-purpose flour & 1/2C whole wheat! I did not have walnuts so I can not wait to try this with nuts.

I am eating a slice of this as I type, it is so moist and delicious!  I also mashed the bananas instead of slicing them like others have suggested.  Be sure to bake completely or the middle will collapse and be mushy, even if the edges look really brown it will not be tough or overdone.

I know I've rated other banana breads on this web site with 4 or 5 stars.  But this one takes the top prize, the gold medal, the blue ribbon.  It's that good!  The key ingredient in this recipe that is missing from the others is the sour cream.  WOW, it was so moist and delicious.  I also used 3 very ripe bananas and wouldn't hesitate to throw in 4 bananas if I had them.  I also mashed my bananas instead of slicing them.  Absolutely fabulous banana bread!

This recipe was as good as the Marjorie Standish recipe I've been using for years, maybe better.  I did change a few things. I mashed the banana, used half brown sugar/half white sugar in place of all white sugar, added just a pinch of cinnamon and omitted the nuts completely.  This was a very smooth, dense bread.  I'll be using this recipe from now on.  Thumbs up~!

Absolutely delicious!!! I am super picky about my breads and this one does hit the spot. SUPER moist! I made a couple of changes though:

Instead of all white sugar, I did 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar (it was plenty sweet). Also used skim milk.

I did 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 lowfat vanilla yogurt to make it healthier (i had some sitting around in the fridge).

I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. cloves for a little bit of spice.  I was out of eggs so i used egg beaters for the first time in a bread and was not disappointed at all! it tastes wonderful, super healthy and perfect for breakfast with a cup of dark roasted coffee. thanks so much for sharing!

Quite good but much too salty -- I cut the salt in half the second time around. I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white instead of all white. Very moist!

This is the best banana bread! The sour cream adds the moisture that my previous recipe was lacking. I did take the suggestion of sprinkling cinnamon on top and it added a nice taste.  I will ALWAYS use this recipe from now on!  A++++

I love this recipe! The first time I made it exactly as stated, and it was pretty good. Then I read some reviews and made it a 2nd time, with 3 mashed bananas, 1/4 t. cinnamon, dash of nutmeg, and 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. It was MUCH better the 2nd time!! Absolutely loved it with the mashed bananas and extra spices. Next time will try with chocolate chips!

DELICIOUS!!!  I've never made banana bread before and as a "rookie" this recipe was super easy and it is delicious!!  I watched it closely because my oven has been wonky, but it still turned out great!  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon based on a previous review I read, and it is so tasty and moist!! :)  I also mashed the bananas instead of slicing because my husband doesn't like "chunky bread".  :) Two thumbs up!!

This was my first attempt at baking ANYTHING, and it came out perfectly.  I mostly followed the recipe, except that I don't care for walnuts, so I used chocolate chips instead.  And, as several other reviewers suggested, I used three mashed bananas instead of two sliced.  I brought the finished product to share at work today, and got rave reviews!  A definite keeper!

This recipe made the moisest banana bread I have ever had.
I had three very small and not very ripe bananas so to create a very banana-y flavor I added a packet of non-instant banana pudding mix and used banana yogurt instead of the sour cream.  I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of nutmeg.  I made them into muffins and cooked them for about 24 minutes.

They were AMAZING by the next morning.  I would highly reccomend letting them sit for a day as it allows the flavors to truly meld.  Rich and moist and delicious.

This recipe is really delicious!  I used light sour cream and left out the nuts--it was still good. The only thing I will do differently next time is mash the bananas instead of slice them.  My two youngest kids didn't like the hunks of banana in there.

I was not fond about the sliced bananas. They were gooey and brown. This bread was very moist though. I had to bake it an extra 15 mins and it was still a bit "wet" in the middle. Next time I will mash the bananas and add some cinnamon, nutmeg etc... and maybe bake it at 325 degrees for 20 mins. more.

Excellent recipe.  I used vanilla lowfat yogurt and accidentally halved the butter (intended to use part applesauce) - still came out yummy.  As always, used part whole wheat flour.  Easy recipe to make modifications to and still comes out great.

This was my first attempt at baking a banana nut bread, and it was so easy and delicious!  Because the bananas are sliced and not mushed into the batter, the bread comes out of the oven a golden brown on the outside and a beautiful shade of yellow on the inside!  It is so moist and delicious that my boyfriend wouldn't even let me have a bite of his piece!  I added an extra banana, and may even add a little more than that next time.  Absolutely delicious.  Can't wait to have another slice!

Wonderful flavor.  Made mine into muffins because I wanted to bake it quickly before bedtime!  Baked 12 large muffins for 24 minutes.  Also, mashed my bananas per advice of other reviewers.

This bread turned out wonderful, a definite keeper.  I was taking into work for a potluck brunch so I thought I would dress it up.  I added the Prauline Glaze from the Cantaloupe Bread recipe by Linda K.  (butter/br.sugar/chopped  pecans)on top.  It was a big hit.

Wow! Great banana bread. Has so much flavor and is very easy to make. For the other's who are leaving less then 5 stars and then they are changing the recipe, that's your fault! This recipe is wonderful and everytime I make it, I get compliments galore. The only thing I did differently was to mash my banana's. I cook mine in cast iron loaf pans which creates a perfectly brown and crunchy crust with a moist middle. This is by far my husband's favorite recipe.

I can't really rate this recipe because I didn't get it right. Although it looked great from the outside, it wasn't done in the middle (at all!). I used three bananas instead of 2, maybe that's the reason...

Fantastic banana bread.  I used part brown sugar, added cinnamon, and mashed the bananas rather than slicing them.  Very moist and flavorful.

The idea of slicing bananas instead of mashing is genious! Based on the previous reviews, I've added 3rd banana (mashed) and the texture and flavor were perfect. Also I reduced vanilla extract to 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp of ground cardamom (the idea I liked in another recipe), which turned out to be a great combination.

This was the best. My hubby helped me make them and was shocked to measure and add sour cream (so was I) so I told him that maybe that was the secret ingredient that earns its name "RICH" and it sure is. SUPER YUMMY! I made it just as it reads and it needs no tweeking. I will have to use this in place of mom's old recipe (sorry mom). Definitely "ONEderful"!

Moistest, tastiest recipe I've ever tried. I served war with caramelized bananas (bring butter, brown sugar and bourbon to simmer, then saute sliced bananas until coated and soft) and topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Received rave reviews.

This very simple recipe yielded deliciously moist yet super light and fluffy banana goodness!  I mashed the bananas roughly instead of slicing, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  I had some extra mixture as my tin was slightly smaller than the one specified in the recipe, so I baked off a few cupcakes for ~15 mins using the extra mixture and these also came out yummy.    A complete success! :)

This is a wonderful recipe. After reading reviews I doubled the recipe, mashed the bananas and added pecans and mini chocolate chips. The double batch yeilded 16 mini loaves and 6 regular size muffins. They are a big hit with the family.

I love the sliced bananas.  It gives the bread such a different, more intense flavor.  However, I used two LARGE bananas.  And, the sour cream makes for a very moist loaf.  Delicious :)

I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 c choc chips. I used 2/3 fat free crisco, 1/3 butter crisco and butter extract in place of the butter. I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 bread flour. Still is excellent!

OUT OF THIS WORLD! I mashed up 3 banana's and - I had some streusel topping(left over from an accidental mix up of a cinnamon roll filling)that I layered in - I put about 1/2 the batter - then 1/3 cup streusel, then 1/4 of the batter, then another 1/3 cup streusel, then the rest of the batter, then I drew an S shape with a knife to swirl it a bit. Visitors to the house that day were in awe. It was truly the best quick bread I've ever had. (The streusel was about 1/3 of the filling recipe from "Cinnamon Rolls III")

This was so moist and full of banana flavor.  We ate this whole loaf in one night!  I was hesitant when the recipe called for sour cream, but you couldn't taste it one bit.  I will definitely make this again.

After reading other reviews, I mashed the bananas too. I added chocolate chips (a necessary ingredient for my husband). I found that I had to bake the bread for 75 minutes to get it cooked through. Might be my oven (gas). The bread is delicious, moist and nice crisp on the outside. I also made them in a paper  lined muffin tin and baked for 25 minutes.  They were perfect!

Not sure if it was because of my pan, but I checked after 55 minutes and it was done. I would suggest checking it after 50 minutes. 
I will add a little extra banana next time, too.

I looked at other reviews; based upon them and my past trials of this recipe, I like these differences: Cream softened Butter w/Sugar (not melted).    Use 1 t Baking Soda and 1 t Baking Powder.  Bananas should be 1 c MASHED (if use frozen, just defrost a bit & squeeze out into mixture).  Can add 1 t Cinnamon and 1/2 t Nutmeg; or Pumpkin Pie Spice.  Can add a handful of choc chip is wanted.  If double recipe, makes 2 small pans and 1 large pan.

I have made this a few times now and I love it.  Most of it I mean most of it ends up getting baked meaning I don’t eat all the batter.  I always make extra to experiment with of course!  I love sharing this bread with customers, neighbors, friends,  family, coworkers and everyone loves it when I make it!!!!

This bread was AWESOME! I took other reviewers’ advice and mushed up the bananas rather than slice them. It burned the first time I made it because I used a metal baking dish. Second time around I used a glass dish. It came out darn near perfect! I don’t know who Janet is but I want to thank her for creating this recipe .

This is, by far the best banana bread recipe. The sour cream made it so moist. I added low sugar craisens to it which enhanced the flavor. My husband loved it so much I had to make a second one.

This was only my second recipe try at making banana bread. This recipe is a definite keeper. I didn't have enough white sugar so I put in 1/2 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar.   I also mashed the bananas. It took about 53 minutes to bake (in my oven) and it was very moist and delicious.

Very good as is, no need to make any changes. I find it hard to rate a recipe if you didn't make it exactly as the recipe calls for. Start with the original recipe, then go from there after you tried it.

One of the easiest recipes and a favorite of all who’ve tried. A few substitutes/variations takes the flavor and moisture to stratospheric levels:
1. Muscovado sugar instead of regular sugar. And 80% of the suggested recipe quantity.
2. Bourbon vanilla instead of regular vanilla
3. Mashed overripe bananas

Great recipe! I followed another reviewer's tip: add 1 tsp. lemon juice with the vanilla, and use 1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder, and 1-3/4 c. flour. Finally, regardless of how many bananas are used it should equal 1 cup of mashed bananas.

I added a walnut crumble of melted butter, brown sugar, a little bit of flour, and cinnamon and salt to the top. And a hint of almond extract to balance flavors to the whole batter.

This was beyond perfection! I took the advice of another and made sure the butter and eggs were very much room temperature. I beat the butter & sugar, added the vanilla and eggs. Separately mixed the flour, baking soda, salt, and added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Mixed that into my batter and folded in the sour cream, 3 bananas mashed & chopped walnuts. It has so much flavor & is incredibly moist. One of the best banana breads I have ever had! Thank you! This is a a recipe I will use forever!

I love this recipe, with minor variations. First of all, I only used about 1/2 cup white sugar, then little bit of brown sugar. I also added 2-3 tbsp of honey. yum yum! I also put in an extra banana, and I MASHED THEM. DO NOT SLICE THEM. it is delicious though. also make sure to add chocolate chips. yummmmm! :-)

This was the best banana bread I have ever made! I had to have oral surgery which required me to eat softer foods for awhile. I had some very ripe bananas so I thought this might make an easy to eat food. Oh my, this bread is delicious and was so easy to make. Because my bananas were so soft, I needed to mash them anyway as others suggested and it was better that way since I had sliced them when I made it before. I am about to make this bread again, but wanted to include my review. Great recipe!

My absolute go to recipe when I want to use up overripe bananas! Made several times, sometimes I mash, sometimes I slice the bananas. Either way, the bread comes out perfectly! The sour cream definitely makes a difference, but I will try the suggestion of banana yogurt :) Thanks for sharing!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I softened the butter instead of melting it, and mashed the bananas.  Also didn’t add nuts.  The bread is moist and delicious. Will definitely make again.

This is by far the moistest banana bread I have ever made or tasted.  The only change I made was to mash the bananas instead of slicing them.  That's the way I always do it especially because I have kiddos with texture issues.  As for the amounts and ingredients, I can't see any reason to change them.,

It rose nice and tall, which I thought was nice compared to the short loaves I’m used to, I’m sure because I used self-rising flour instead of AP flour (I was out!) Tasted just fine but was extremely crumbly for some reason and this made it a pain to eat. I used 3 mashed bananas.

This recipe can’t be beat.  It makes a rich, denser bread.  I’ve used the batter to make 4 giant muffins, baking for 40 minutes.  I also use, softened butter rather than melted, and added 3 bananas rather than 2. I also add 1tsp baking powder.  Try substituting the walnuts with dark chocolate chips!

I was asked to make something for a Teen Challenge get together.  I had plenty of bananas so I tried this recipe.  I wanted to make one to taste test before making any for the group. IT IS "THE BEST BANANA BREAD" I have ever made or tasted.  I had all ingredients out and ready but also had baking powder. I should have read the recipe more closely with glasses on. I mistakenly added it but it still turned out wonderful.  Thank you vjonsson for submitting this recipe.

I just finished baking! I would recommend cutting the cooking time by about 5 minutes, mine was burnt. Funny thing is that I cooked 2 loaves (together) - this original recipe burned and the one I altered didn't! I used 1/2c of vanilla yogurt instead of SC, I used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of white and 1/2c of chocolate chips instead of nuts. Not only delicious but so moist!! Love them both!!

I have made this a million times, its so good!! Very moist. I bake at 325 in a convection oven. Have also made into mini muffins (bake for 15-min). A little extra banana is OK (I used 5 banana for a double batch, which came out to 2.5 cups). Can also sub some yougurt if you don't have enough sour cream. Omit the salt. Good with or without nuts.

Perfection! I used softened butter as another reviewer mentioned and beat in other ingredients with a stand mixer. I also puréed the bananas in my magic bullet instead of using slices. I had to substitute plain Greek nonfat yogurt for the sour cream but only because it's what I had. I used a dark, nonstick 4-mini loaf pan and baked at 325 degrees for 30 minutes.

This banana nut bread was quick to make and tasted delicious.  A very nice option for breakfast. A word of caution: the instructions state to bake for 60 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.  Definitely monitor this.  I had the presence of mind to set my timer for 45 minutes (because baking can so easily go wrong) and my bread was done a couple of minutes before the timer went off.  All sides were a nice rich brown color (perfect crunchy crust!)  so it would've been black in another 10 minutes or so.

The only thing I had done different was to add an extra bananna to the mix which gave it much more flavor. I've this also with a creamcheese filling.

We thought this could have used more banana flavor and could have been more sweeter. I did use a full cup of mashed banana. It was moist though.

I'm 5th generation making a banana cake but this morning looked at 3 gorgeously ripe bananas and decided this recipe was a good one to try. It's very easy and I thank you for sharing. I added about a tsp cinnamon to the batter and sprinkled some on top. I also added walnuts to the top. I'm lucky to have a walnut connection. My Aunt sends me California Chandler Walnuts every year.  They are buttery and sweet, and they definitely added that little bit of extra flavor to this delicious bread.  Will make again.

Great recipe. I did make some changes after reading reviews. I mashed the bananas added a pinch of cinnamon and used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white. I also added mini chocolate chips for the kiddos instead of nuts. Mine took less than an hour in my oven so start checking for doneness around 45-50 minutes if you have a hot oven. The result was a hit!

Ana and I made this banana bread with a few changes to the recipe. We used applesauce instead of butter, We used nonfat plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream and Splenda instead of sugar. We didn't use nuts as I don't like them. We mashed the bananas instead of slicing them and it turned out great. So its 70 calories verses the 218 per serving. It is moist and dense. Perfect.

This is ten star delicious! To make it healthier, I replaced half the oil with applesauce, used half whole wheat flour, and cut the sugar to 3/4 of a cup (next time it will be 2/3). I also followed other reviewers' advice, and used an extra banana, as well as added 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. With those changes, this was one incredible, moist banana cake that I don't feel guilty eating for breakfast.

Variation...mashed bananas, added cinnamon, 1 tbs white vinegar to further sour milk in sour cream... Added a crumble topping and made the finest banana bread jumbo muffins you've ever tasted. Perfect base and yes... Moist! Better a day later but they never last that long. Smile.    One time I did not have vanilla and substituted real maple Syrup... The faint hint of maple was to die for.

I altered the  recipe  by mashing the banana,  I also didn't have bananas that were over ripe.  I like to use black skin bananas not just spotty,  and found a article that said put them in the oven for 20-25 min at 250* and this helped ripen my bananas.  I also didn't combined the ingredients in what I would call a proper order.  It was thrown together until it was mixed well.  Also I made two loafs at the same time and didn't have enough sour cream for two. So I put in 1/2 cup for two loafs. I used coconut oil for light grease on the pan.  The crust is nice and crunchy and the middle is soft and moist so I would say a success and I plan on making more.

"Oh man, hon, this is better than any banana bread we've ever bought. Ever." Said my husband after his first bite. Then he said, "Next time, add chocolate chips!" :-)

I did mash the bananas (didn't measure them but used 2), and added about 3/4 tsp extra vanilla. I used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.

We live at around 6000 ft altitude, so I was happy that this bread didn't turn out too dense or too airy - the consistency was perfect.

After making this (at times with sour cream, sometimes yoghurt) I've tossed my 45 year-old recipe -- this is the only banana bread I'll make from now on!  Family loves it, and we buy a few too many bananas specifically to let them get very ripe so we can make another loaf.  Like others, I cream the butter and sugar together, then proceed with the rest of the recipe.  Using a mixer, I just grind up the bananas into the batter (didn't care for them sliced), then add the nuts, unchopped.  The nuts slice very easily once baked, and it's kind of fun to get chunks instead of bits.  We've tried all sorts of nuts -- prefer pecans.
Thanks for a truly marvelous recipe.

The only change I made was mashing the banana anyway because I wanted even distribution.  I also added cinnamon because we love that in our banana bread.  This is a great easy recipe!

This is the best banana bread I have ever made. I did follow some suggestions. I let the butter and eggs come to room temperature and I use and electric mixer for the butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla. Use a spatula to mix in the dry ingredients and I mashed the bananas with the sour cream.  I use toasted pecans and added chocolate chips. Moist and delicious. Best  ever!!

I love this recipe because it is so moist and perfect texture. I did everything just like the recipe except added a half cup dried cranberries and it is just the best bread you will ever make and I have made a lot of banana bread in my life... You will never need any other recipe again.Try it and don't use a mixer but mix it by hand and you can make it for sure in 10 min.

This turned out incredibly moist and was even better the next morning with my coffee!

I used the recommendations from the reviews and added the lemon juice, mashed the bananas and used both baking powder and soda. 

For my own twist, however, I used vanilla flavored Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream since I didn't have it on hand. Turned out tasting amazing. I'll only say that next time, I'll be using half a cup more walnuts because I prefer a nuttier b-bread. 

Give it a try!

This was great banana bread! I made it for my family and they all loved it. But I made a few changes.
I didn't have much sour cream, so I used cream cheese instead.
To make it a bit more healthy, I used a cup of blended oat's and half a 
cup of flour. I also added a few spices, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger. If  you want a crumble, you just use half a cup of oats, 4 tablespoons of butter,
and it depends how much of a sweet tooth you have for the 
amount of sugar the you put. Also, the bananas I  used  were very ripe and I used about 4 of them.  
You could also sprinkle a few chopped up nuts on top.
Hope you enjoy!

I'm so glad I finally got around to trying this recipe.  It absolutely deserves its rock solid 5 star rating.  I used 2 medium to large size bananas - mashed not sliced (1 cup). Have to admit that I can't imagine how this would turn out with sliced fruit instead of mashed!   As I've never seen a recipe for banana bread (or muffin, cake, pancake....you get the idea) that requires anything but mashed fruit, I decided to do as most other reviewers and go with the traditional method.  Other than that my one minor change was the addition of about 1 tsp. of vanilla butter nut flavoring.  I love its taste in baked banana goods.

I made some modifications. I used half butter and half oil. Half white sugar and half brown sugar. 3 bananas mashed. I ditched the walnuts because I didn't have any and put almonds on top, it came out amazing and moist after 1 hour and 20 minutes at 350 degrees.

Excellent recipe!  Very moist, very banana-y tasting.  I wasn't crazy about the sliced banana texture so I think next time I'll try the same recipe with traditional "mashed" bananas.  I will make it again!  Review addendum:  I made this again, and mashed the bananas instead of slicing them.  PERFECT!!!!!!  

Additional comments:  I've made this bread MANY times.  I make it exactly per directions BUT I toast the walnuts (or pecans) before adding them.  This bread also freezes incredibly well.  I've made it, wrapped it in foil, tossed it in the freezer, and a month later removed it and let it thaw.  Perfect!

The only thing I changed in this recipe was that I pureed the bananas since I don't like any banana chunks. I also added a basic crumb topping with flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and butter. Yummy !!

I believe this just became my "go-to" recipe for banana bread! I mashed the bananas, used softened butter instead of melted, and used vanilla greek yogurt instead of sour cream...baked perfectly and has just the right amount of sweetness.

I have tried countless banana bread recipes but never found one that tasted like the bread my grandma made, until this one.  This recipe is the ONE.  It is so good I will give it 5 stars even though I don't like the un-mashed banana as called for in the recipe.  Mash the bananas and it's fantastic.   I have made this several times and I have changed a few things but not so much as to change the recipe too much.  I double the recipe and add 1 tsp. cinnamon.  I use light sour cream and instead of all butter I used 1/2 margarine and 1/2 canola oil.  To make it more like a bakery I  sprinkle on the large size sugar crystals before baking.  Everyone who has eaten this bread has raved about it!

We liked this a lot!  I used to make banana bread from an old Bisquick recipe tht was pretty good, but much drier than this!  This was excellent!  My sour cream was spoiled, so I had to use plain Greek yogurt, which was the only substitution I made.  Wish I had remembered to add some cinnamon for a little bit of spice, but all in all, it was a great recipe!  Oh, and I used some brown sugar instead of all white.  YUM!  Will be bringing the rest of the loaf to FL vacation in a few days for the family for breakfast!

This is a good recipe. I knew to slice them and mash. Did good in high-alt area (ABQ). Did not sub anything. Mixing certain ingredients together before combining all is really key for those who are not getting a good turn-out. See the AllRecipes video on banana bread to see how to combine ingredients.

I made this recipe twice, once as stated in the recipe and again with half the amount of banana.  Both times I baked them longer than stated and the center collapsed and was raw in the middle. I think I will give it one more try and decrease the sour cream also. Too much  moisture  made it heavy and soggy.

The first thing that caught my eye on this recipe was the word "rich" in the name :-).  The second thing that appealed to me was that the bananas are sliced--different, and no mashing. Like bookchiq, I love the unexpected crisp crust.
 I admit that I also made changes. I like bananas with a bit of caramel flavor, so I used 1/2 C lightly packed brown sugar and 1/2 C white sugar. I, like others, creamed softened butter with the sugars. It just felt odd to me not to. I never make banana bread without cinnamon, so I added 1 1/2 teaspoon. I was out of nuts, but had sunflower seeds, so I used them. I don't think they added or took away anything from Janet's recipe, though I will have to make with nuts to be sure. Three of us ate the whole loaf between dinner and breakfast the next morning, so I made it again the next day to share at work.  My son told me this is the best banana bread I have ever made. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Super moist and flavorful! I doubled the recipe and added 1 1/2 cups of white sugar instead of 2.  Added a teaspoon of cinnamon. Skipped the nuts, bur added 1/2 cup chocolate chips. My 14 year old daughter loved them, and she's very picky about banana bread.  She said it was the best I ever made.  Next time, I'll probably not add the chocolate chips.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks, Janet!

I made this banana bread recipe because I had some bananas that were over-ripe.  I changed it a bit, I used coconut sugar and coconut flour and added chia seeds and pecans. I didn't have sour cream so I used 1/2 cup of buttermilk. It was delicious.  My family loved it.  Will definitely make again.

This is a simple recipe that yields delicious results.  The only modification I made was substituting pecans for walnuts.  This bread is so moist, yet not too dense.  Definitely a keeper!

Ok after reading other recipes and reviews I am shocked to discover that other people actually prefer dense banana bread. I always thought I was doing it wrong when it came out like a brick. If that is what you are looking for, keep searching because this was the lightest, fluffiest banana bread I've ever had and I could have eaten the entire loaf the first night. It actually rose to the top of the loaf pan!  I can't wait to try this recipe as muffins next. I opted not to use the nuts, this bread melts in your mouth without them. Otherwise I made it exactly as stated. Tip: unpeel your overripened banana and freeze it until you have enough of them to make bread. I'm never afraid to buy too many bananas after discovering they can be frozen.

Excellent moist banana bread!  Yogurt may be subbed for the sour cream. Mash the bananas to avoid the brown pieces in your bread.

Exactly the recipe I was looking for, wonderfully moist and rich.  Based on other reviews and personal taste, I did rough mash the bananas and add a dash of cinnamon and cloves.  Amazing....my new go to banana bread recipe.

I made double the recipe and put half the amount of sugar required. I also mashed the bananas instead and used 2.5 bananas per loaf. Banana bread turned out great! Moist and soft; my family is asking for more loaves :D

This recipe is amazing!  Since I'm not a fan of chunky mashed bananas, I used a hand mixer to blend them in with the other ingredients.  I didn't measure out my bananas... I just used 2 medium sized, very black ones.  I didn't have sour cream so I used a homemade substitute with about 3/4 cup cottage cheese (should use a cup but it was all I had) blended with one tablespoon of lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of milk.  My husband, who typically makes banana bread and uses sour cream in his recipe, admitted today that this recipe is better than his!  Score!  This is our new forever banana bread recipe.

MUFFINS!!  Super easy and fun to make with my 12 year old son. Followed the recipe, but added a teaspoon of cinnamon, and no nuts. Decided to do muffins instead of a loaf. Bake time was 30 minutes.  Slightly crunchy top and moist throughout.

I love the flavor and for the most part, its quite moist. However, my issue is the crust of the bread cooks way too fast as compared to the middle making the bottom and sides very crunchy. Then when cutting into the bread the sides and bottom are noticeably darker than the center and top of the bread. I follow the direction exactly and have tried different bread pans with the same results. 
The flavor is amazing and everyone really likes it but I just can't get past the sides and bottom being so over done.

EDIT: After reducing the temp of the oven by 30°F and cooking 15 minutes longer, the "crust" issue is no longer an issue. Changing from 4 stars to 5 with this fix!!I should also add that I mash the bananas and mix them in rather than slicing them.

I loved this recipe.  I substituted a 1/2 cup of Skor pieces for the nuts due to a nut allergy, and went with 1/2 cup of greek yogurt instead of Sour cream. It was the first Banana bread recipe that I saw that used sliced banana instead of mashed, and have to say, it was the best Banana bread I have ever had. So easy and super delicious!

Baked according to directions with some additions such as adding a tsp each of ground clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon.  It was okay but I was not thrilled with the actual texture of the bread.  It was more rubbery than what a cake bread should be.  I mixed it by hand so it doesn't get too stiff but it didn't do the trick.  Second time I will use the mixer and see if this would change the texture.

My husband and I made this banana bread for Christmas and it was the best banana bread recipe we have come across!! It is moist and soft, the flavor is rich with a strong banana taste. We skipped the walnuts cause I'm not a fan of them, but this recipe turned out perfect. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.

This recipe is truly fantastic!  After reading a few other banana bread recipes, I decided to replace the sour cream with vanilla yogurt and add some extra bananas.  Took mini loafs to a brunch this morning and everyone loved them!

Well, to start with lovely textured cake....Definitely a keeper..Though, I would definitely reduce the sugar to 3/4th cup and the vanilla to 1/2 tsp...rest definitely a keeper...1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 oats flour...added 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda...

I exchanged the sour cream for half a cup of peanut butter, mixed bananas in at the beginning, and added a cup of mini Reese cups.  I also dusted the pan with sugar after spraying it.

I made this with adding the sugestions from Naples34102...I accidentally forgot the salt and did not notice it untill I was writing this recipie with her suggestions combined on a recipe card for my box. This does NOT need the salt...I'm omitting it from the recipe..also, I was stuck using margarine as I was out of butter with the after Christmas baking bonanaza....This is the most delicious banana bread recipe I have ever made....Next time I will use butter as its what I use in baking. I can only imagine it will make the bread taste slightly richer. Delicious!

I made this recipe after reading the reviews. All I did was make some slight moderations. I Used Pecan pieces instead of Walnuts, and slightly mashed the bananas instead of leaving them sliced. It was delicious! Thanks so much for sharing!

Wanted to use up some older Bananas so I tried out this recipe.  It was really good! The only thing I did differently than the recipe stated was, I creamed the softened butter and sugar together and I mashed the bananas.  Everything else I did exactly as stated. This recipe is a keeper!

This was so delicious & moist, we absolutely loved this recipe.  The only change I made was to mash the bananas instead of slice them.  I also added a few extra walnuts & softened the butter instead of melting.  Absolutely a keeper, thanks for sharing!

Followed the advice of Naples34102 and used 1.75c of flour, 1 tsp of baking soda, 1 tsp of baking powder and an add of lemon juice. Only thing different I did was omit the nuts due to an allergen in the house. Tastes delish with a morning cup of Joe. Thank you Janet for the share!

I make this all the time.  I usually substitute half whole wheat pastry flour and half white whole wheat flour and it turns out great.  I also add pecans.  Very good, moist recipe.  I don't melt the butter (I soften it) and I definitely mash the bananas up to make them sweeter rather than use cut banana chunks.  Great recipe b/c of the sour cream!

I did make some of the modifications as other reviewers suggested, so my rating is based on those changes being implemented. I creamed the butter and sugar, which if you are not that familiar with baking, is the standard method for making a fluffy batter. Make sure your butter is at room temperature, and that you cream the mixture for at least five minutes. One of the benefits of making banana bread is that you use up overly ripe bananas, so I used 1 cup of very dark bananas and made sure they were mashed well. I also used 1-3/4 cups flour and 1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder. The crumb of this bread is lighter than most other recipes, and the addition of a little cinnamon is a nice change if you want a little more depth of flavor. Excellent base recipe, but very glad I read some reviews before trying it. I will make this again!

I have tried every banana bread recipe known to mankind. This one (with just a few changes) was perfect. I mashed the bananas out of habit. It didn't seem like much banana, there wasn't quite a full cup so I added a bit of applesauce to make a full cup. I also added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the bananas before folding them in to the mixture. The bread turned out to be the best I have ever made. Usually banana bread is either dry or not cooked in the center. This was moist, had great flavor and even better the next day!

Tried this twice, once exactly as written, the second time with mashed bananas.  Would have given it 5 stars, except for the explicit directions to "slice" bananas.  Don't!  Very tasty, very moist, but sliced bananas give it slimy pockets.  The bananas I used were brown the second time around, and made it even sweeter and moister.  Don't throw them away but use them in this recipe instead!

This is my go-to banana bread-- I've made this more times than I can count and someone always asks for the recipe when I bring it somewhere. I've done it a lot of different ways, but I usually swap the sour cream for plain yogurt (whole, low-fat or even nonfat, but I usually like some fat), and 1/4c butter 1/4c oil instead of all butter. I also like to use white whole wheat flour and 3/4c sugar depending on my mood and how sweet I want it. It's still really moist with less sugar so don't be afraid to cut back! 1c sugar is also good and more desserty than bfastlike. I also love it without walnuts too, and sometimes with choco chips. This recipe has made me feel really loved at potlucks lol.

Delicious and moist.  So easy too, my husband and my toddler daughter made it together.  The large banana chunks were a different and nice touch.  Liked having the large banana pieces in there.

I never take the time to sign up and review things, but made this recipe twice and came out perfect and it's easy. I'm not a baker at all. The only thing I added is a little nutmeg and cinnamon and if the smashed bananas did equal a full cup I would fill the rest of the cup with applesauce(which I read from another comment)   thank you Janet.

I really thought the taste of this was great, I could see it becoming a favorite with a few adjustments, such as mashing the bananas instead of slicing them, and creaming the butter and sugar.........ok. I've made it with those changes now, including some baking powder. It was moist but not extremely dense. I think the baking powder and whipping process may have something to do with that. I measured out one cup of mashed bananas (three because they were very small) and wish it had just a little more banana flavor. Other than that- pretty good, but it won't stop my search for the perfect loaf.

A very delicious and moist bread! I did follow some of the suggestions of other reviewers which worked well. I did not melt the butter (just used softened). I did mash the banana, used 1 3/4 cup flour, 1 tsp each of baking powder and soda, added 1 tsp lemon juice, about 1/4 tsp cinnamon and pinch of cloves. After greasing the pan, I dusted lightly with a cinnamon/sugar mixture. I hate it when a bread seems overcooked (and it doesn't take long!) so I think I'll take it out at about 52 min next time, and there will be a next time! Thanks for a great recipe, vjonsson!

This is delicious. It's not even cooled off yet and it's almost gone. My only change was that I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. A keeper for sure.

we love this recipe, and make it weekly. a few changes based on reviews: soften butter, dont melt it. beat butter with sugar until creamy. i use 1/2 c white and 1/2 c brown sugar. 1 tsp lemon juice at the same time as the vanilla. add 1 tsp baking powder with the baking soda, and add 1 tsp cinnamon. mash the bananas, dont just slice them.

have substituted buttermilk and whipping cream for the sour cream, and both worked fine. yogurt would probably work as well. 

i usually double the batch and make half in a loaf pan and half into 24 muffins. (without liners.) i freeze the muffins, and reheat them as needed. they take about 17 minutes.

I don't live in the States and sour cream is not readily available. I substituted yogurt (although "sour cream" can be made with yogurt and white vinegar), and the end result was delicious. Just a thought if you are either in the same situation or simply forget the sour cream at the store.

Absolutely wonderful!  Only change was the addition of chocolate chips, my kids love to help mix them in to just about anything.  The banana bread was moist, not too sweet, and sooo tasty.  A winner, this is my go to recipe for banana bread!

This banana bread was fantastic. I did make a few adjustments. I mashed my banana, used 1/2 cup of Greek vanilla yogurt,added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and only used 2/3 cup of sugar. Very moist, tasty bread with good flavor. It cooked very evenly. I will make this again

Loved this recipe! The bread is super moist! I mixed 2 bananas in with sugar, butter,  eggs  & vanilla and cut another one into pieces that I folded in at the end. I also dust my pans with cinnamon & a sprinkle of sugar. It makes a delicious crust!!

I used this recipe as a base for a healthier version, and the muffins I made were delicious, moist, and light.  The changes I made were:
Oat flour in place of white
1/4 cup of coconut oil, 1/4 cup of non fat 
Greek yogurt in place of sour cream
1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup sugar free apple sauce (or pureed pear)
Added 1/4 cup of ground flax seed

Even with all these healthy changes, the muffins were incredible.  Thanks for sharing

I made this recipe twice and both times it turned out great but the first time it was to sweet so I reduced the sugar by a quarter cup. a little less sweet and glad to have less sugar. I might go with half the sugar next time. I use very ripe, organic bananas which seem to be generally much sweeter than non organic. :)

I love this recipe, but I make a few changes; add a pinch of cinnamon, top with course sugar (for example sugar in the raw), and I add a third banana in leu of the sour cream for a sweeter and stronger banana flavor, less fat is just an added bonus. I feel the sour cream actually dilutes the banana flavor and doesn't really add anything that a third banana can't.

made the changes, did not melt butter, used brown sugar , added 1 tsp of baking powder, used 1 ¾ cups of flour and mashed the bananas using 1 cup.  Made sure I only cooked until knife came out clean. It is by far, the best banana bread I have ever made and I  bake quite a bit.

This recipe is outstanding. By far the best banana recipe I have ever tried. I did make the same variations as "naples34102" and increased flour to 1 3/4 cups, used both baking soda and powder and used 1 cup of mashed. I will never look for another recipe again. So moist and full of flavour.

Really an awesome recipe !! I exchanged the white sugar for 3/4 c brown sugar, and I threw the bananas in the mixer, no slicing . Then I sprinkled on cinnamon and sugar before and after baking

The texture of the bread was ok, but didn't taste like banana bread due to the fact that the sliced bananas sank to the bottom of the pan, they turned purple and were very mushy. If you are going to try this recipe, mash the bananas, don't slice them.

This is the absolute best banana bread recipe out there! I went on a mission last year to find I've, tried 3 or 4 before finding this one and haven't looked back. I always mean to try tweaking it to be a little healthier but when I start making it, I just can't persuade myself to stray.

The one difference I do is as others have said, I mash the bananas instead of slice, I don't love the chunky banana texture of sliced.

The best banana bread I have ever eaten and my 16 year old son agreed. I used apple sauce in the recipe to reduce sugar and mashed the bananas since they were so ripe, and it was perfect.

I made this with only 2 bananas which wasn't 1 full cup and it is good but would prefer a little more banana flavor, next time I will use a cup of smashed banana's as others have suggested.  I made these as mini-muffins baking for only 15 minutes and they were perfect!

Excellent and tasty banana bread. I mashed the bananas before adding and used greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar. My hubby, who hates anything that could be considered healthy gave it a 2 thumbs up even with the greek yogurt.

Great recipe! My favorite banana bread recipe that I have found. I did take the advice of another and added extra flour (total 1 3/4 cups) as well as added a dash of lemon extract. I also use a mixture of cinnamon and sugar which I put on top of the bread. Delicious recipe! Thank you!

I used to have a recipe that I loved, until finding this one.  I agree the pureed bananas are a better option, never a problem, since I freeze the bananas left when the brown spots show up and no one will eat them here. I thaw them before making the batter, so they're pretty much mushy by then. I have done the chocolate chips in the past, and to that I would recommend using sliced maraschino cherries for a rich change of pace.  But for the best banana bread for breakfast and with coffee, this is awesome!!

This recipe is dangerously delicious! I have made this many many times following the original recipe pretty closely. The only change I make is to mash the bananas instead of putting them in sliced.

Today, I decided to experiment a bit and switch things up. I used 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. light brown sugar and whole wheat flour. I also used 4 mashed bananas, since I didn't want to have any brown ones left on my counter :/

This came out incredible! I was unsure about the whole wheat flour, but I will continue to make it this way. Thank you for a great recipe!

Thank you! Wonderful, super moist bread, I followed naples34102 tips. Was looking for a high fiber mini-muffin recipe for my daughter & a way to use very 5 over-ripe bananas. I doubled the recipe, which made 2 trays of mini muffins to freeze & a big loaf of bread. I added reconstituted raisins & shredded 1/2 a bag of baby carrots (tossed those & the walnuts w/ flour so they don't sink) & used white-whole-wheat flour from trader joe's. Also, I had no sour cream & needed to use some ricotta up; fortunately that worked really well! I just added a bit of milk to that & finally some apple sauce, as the mix was a tad think w/ all the crazy additions. VERY DELICIOUS.  thanks!

But make it with only 1/2 cup of sugar, and it will be perfect.  Start checking it at 50 minutes of baking.  Comes out moist and delicious.  I have made it with very thin slices of banana or mashed banana and like it either way.  Have also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and it comes out just as good. Be sure to use only 1/2 cup of sour cream or yogurt, as using the entire little container to avoid having a little left-over resulted in a loaf that was not fully baked.

Just made tonight. I mashed up the bananas and substituted strawberry yogurt because I didn't have sour cream as another reviewer suggested. Was amazing and there was NO hint of strawberry whatsoever.

I've done this one twice.  Both times I substituted chocolate chips for the walnuts and both times, I made mini loaves and muffins out of the batter instead of a whole loaf of banana bread.  They are the BEST I've ever had and I promptly threw out my old recipe.  This one is wonderful.  So moist and tender.  Even my mother, who doesn't like bananas much, loved them.  The mini loaves were a hit at our church bake sale, too.  Second time around, I dusted the chocolate chips with flour so they wouldn't sink to the bottom.

excellent recipe. I made this tonight only I replaced the walnuts with chocolate chips. next time around I would mash the bananas instead of slicing them. the inside was a great texture but there were some bigger lumps throughout. the outside had a nice little crunch. delicious!!

My favorite banana bread recipe! I typically make muffins with it, makes 12 and bake for 20 minutes. I use Greek Yogurt instead of sour cream, no walnuts and 3/4 cup sugar (instead of the full cup). I made this for my sons preschool class snack and doubled the recipe. Worked out perfect. I love you banana bread. mmm...

Just tried this recipe for the first time and I LOVE it! I did mash the bananas and added a bit of applesauce to make 1 C of fruit. Also I like a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg so I added 1/2 t of each. I did not have sour cream so I used plain yogurt instead. My butter was already soft so I whipped it with the sugar then added the eggs and whipped again. I used my mini loaf pan (makes 8) and baked 30 min. The loaves raised well, baked thoroughly and look beautiful. The texture is a nice soft, moist crumb and the exterior is perfect. This is definitely my new favorite banana bread recipe and one I am sure I will be making many times!!

My entire family loved this banana bread. I mashed the bananas instead of slicing.  This is the best recipe...I'll not be using any other. 

P.S.  Would have added a photo...bread disappeared before I has the chance!!!  :0)

I did as many others did which was to mash the bananas as well as I added a third one.  This is simply a delicious recipe.  Also - I was out of sour cream so I added Greek yogurt - worked just as well.

My first attempt at banana bread and it was so good and so moist!  Below is looks like a lot of changes, but just want to stress I loooved using this recipe as a base - the sour cream alone called me to it :) Changes: Used oil instead of butter (that's all I had - it was still amazing though, I promise!); Mashed the nanas (someone description of seeing "bruises" thru-out bread threw me off the slicing train); Had enough nanas for over a cup (so def more than 2 nanas per batch); Added about a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon per batch; Replaced half the sugar with brown sugar, and even decreased the sugar total by a 1/4 cup per batch; I mixed up 2 batches and split it into 3 8x4 loaf pans for approx 55 min.  Planning to make again next week!!!!

Moist and delicious recipe.  I used this as a foundation for some major modifications though, to be healthier for my diabetic wife.  1.  Replaced completely white flour with whole wheat (1C total)

2.  Instead of the white sugar I used the brown sugar suralose (splenda).  It does have some brown sugar blended in so it's not completely free of sugar. Based on supplier replacement recommendations I only use 1/2 cup of it.

3.  I mashed the bananas instead of slicing.
4.  I added 1/3 of a cup of unsweeted apple sauce (because I so many people say using all whole wheat flour results in a denser and more dry version).

Well this was moist and delicious.  My wife is a picky eater and raved about this and gave it 10/10.

I made a double batch (I had that many bananas!), so it was four loaves at once.  I followed the recipe exactly as written EXCEPT for the sliced bananas part.  My bananas could NOT be sliced as they were too ripe--black, really! So, mashed took the place of "sliced"! I tested the loaves at 50 minutes and they were done perfectly.  (That could be my oven, although the oven thermometer indicates my oven runs true to temp.).  Anyway, this is one great recipe.  The banana bread was excellent!  I'll be making this recipe again, often.

This is a great recipe.  I doubled the amounts and baked in my Wilton long Loaf Pan.  Minor adaptations- my butter was quite soft so I creamed it into the sugar, my bananas were also very ripe and soft and I creamed them into the sugar mixture,I used brown sugar for a deeper flavor, I swapped baking powder for the soda for more lift and lightness.  I used non dairy sour cream.  Fantastic recipe that handles small changes well.  I sliced the loaf into 1 inch thick slices and froze in ziplock bags for lunches.  Held up very well.

Made this with plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream because I had past ripe bananas & no sour cream. I've used Greek yogurt for sour cream before. According to my family this recipe with the changes deserves 10.5 stars! Moist, rich & nice banana flavor

I make this just about once a week. Love this recipe! I use a cup of bananas and I mash them. The first time I made it I forgot to get sour cream so I added white vinegar to 1/2 cup of milk and added 1/4 cup more flour to the recipe. It came out great so now I do that every time since I rarely have sour cream on hand. I also add a teaspoon of baking powder in addition to the teaspoon of baking soda. It is very easy and comes out delicious every time!

I LOVE banana bread and have tried MANY different recipes, and this one is by far the best!!  I follow the recipe exactly and it comes out great every time. Definitely recommend wrapping in wax paper and then aluminum foil, store in a large ziplock bag then wait until the next morning to cut it.  Keeps the tops from being hard or dry.  Super moist.

I just made this bread after checking out the reviews. The only changes I made were; I used oil instead of butter and used 3 bananas instead of 2 and mashed my bananas instead of leaving them in slices. It was excellent, and I am replacing my old banana bread recipe with this one.

Just made this recipe, I had enough to make 3 batches, so in my first batch I followed the exact recipe. It was amazing! moist and delicious.
In one of the other two batches I added cinnamon to it and it made it even better.
On my last batch I added coconut shred and that's the one my kids loved the most!
Thank you

The sour cream was what was missing from my banana bread recipe, makes it so moist. I used artificial sweetener instead of sugar and it actually came out like cake :P soo delicious and cut the calories! Didnt take 60 minutes to cook either, maybe 30. Love this!!

Made a few modifications because of what I had on hand.  Used greek yogurt instead of sour cream, I also substituted one cup of flour with coconut flour.  I baked them as muffins both regular sized and jumbo, both turned out WONDERFUL.

I found this recipe and have made it 3 times in the last 2 months. My family all agree this is the best banana bread I've made in many years. This is my "go-to" banana bread recipe from now on. I do mash the bananas before adding, as others have suggested. Love this recipe.

I have made this banana bread several times, it is excellent as written.  But here's what I have learned along the way...  Doesn't matter if you melt the butter or not, comes out the same, so I don't bother it saves time.  I have used sour cream and vanilla Greek yogurt, both work well.  Texture is the same, only difference is the bread is slightly less tangy when using the yogurt.  I think the tanginess is what I love that about this recipe so when I have the sour crème I use it, otherwise good to go with Greek yogurt.

I made this with a couple changes, I used pecans instead of walnuts and added a couple handfuls of chocolate chips.  I also put a little sugar (1 teaspoon) ontop right before putting in the oven.  Hubby loved it!!!

This recipe makes awesome muffins.  I use vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream and prefer the bananas totally mashed.  I have come to the conclusion that my family intentionally let the bananas go bad so that they get muffins!  (We add nuts, dried fruit or chips depending in mood and what is in the pantry!).  Bake at 425 degrees around 20-25 minutes.

I made many of them to my friends for a Christmas Treat and they loved it!
Super moist and delicious. Great simple way to bake a Banana Nut Bread with essential ingredients not going overboard and the results are awesome. Just added a bit of cinnamon. Thanks for your recipes...:-)

so, I have never ever made banana bread, or any other kind of bread for that matter.  So, some instruction regarding how much batter to put in the loaf pan would have been helpful.  I didn't have the recommended size of pan and the directions just say to "spread evenly"  so I filled my loaf pan.  It is currently running over the edge in my oven with 44 minutes left to cook(thank goodness I put it on a baking sheet).  It would just be nice to have little instructions like - fill pan 3/4 of the way - for those of us who are not bakers.  I'll add more to this review once the loaf is done baking and I can eat some of it.

Edit--- DELICIOUS!!!  I followed some tips from other reviews, added 1 tsp lemon juice, 1 & 3/4 cup flour, mashed the bananas and measured it to 1 cup before adding, used softened butter.  I also reduced the oven temp to 375 and baked for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Turned out great!  Also, I used high altitude flour since I live in Colorado.

I really enjoyed this loaf I made. I usually use bananas when they have  darkened. That's when they are the sweetest and easier to mash into a recipe. My kids know when bananas turn dark they get banana bread. Lol.. btw.this is a great base recipe. I skipped the bananas one time and added chocolate chips.  It was pretty good.

I live in Colorado Springs and prepared this exactly as written.  I did mash the bananas.  Baked 9x5 loaf for an additional 1/2 hour due to altitude. A first--Mylove requested that this be made on a weekly basis...even fussed about the fact that I ate the last slice since "you made the banana bread for me!" Absolutely delicious-moist AND flavorful. UPDATE:  This recipe has also become the most requested for family gatherings and food gifts during the holiday season.

I had been looking for some time for an easy banana bread recipe. Since I often have ripened bananas lying around, I wanted something I could throw together easily once a week or so to use up the old fruit. I think this bread taste-wise is quite good. It is also easy to make - basically everything in one bowl, not a lot of steps. The recipe calls for 2 bananas and I used 3 because that is what I had. It made the bread a tad mushier than I would like but I suspect that was my fault. I will make this again - in fact, I will probably throw the dry ingredients together and keep in a jar to make it even easier next time. Thank you Janet!

I have been trying banana bread recipes for the last two years, never completely happy with any of them.  Until now.  I can now throw away and empty my Allrecipe recipe box of all other banana bread recipes.  I come from a baking family and this is by far the BEST banana bread I've ever eaten!!

Yum. Sour cream made it uber moist! I added cinnamon (which is another secret ingredient for great banana bread) and used candied pecans from Trader Joe's. Mushing the bananas is a must. Best banana bread EVER!

I made this tonight and followed the recipe with one exception...I mashed my bananas and used 1 cup which turned out to be 4 small bananas. It was  delicious, moist, light, but could have more banana flavor.  I think next time I will use 1.5 cups of mashed bananas.

I also mashed the bananas.  I doubled the recipe, and used 5 bananas, which was perfect.  The only other change was that I had to use about 1/2 cup of brown super because I didn't have enough white sugar on hand.  I also baked about 10 minutes longer than the recipe stated.  Perfect!

Absolutely amazing! Best banana bread ever and will taste the just as good on the third day as it does the first(even though it never lasts that long in my house).I diced my bananas up so I wouldnt get big mushy pieces. It tastes great!

I made it and it turned out great! :) I used 1/2 a cup of applesauce instead of butter and used 1/2 cup of stevia and 1/2 cup of sugar. Cooked it about 65 minutes. Perfectly done and fluffy.

I love this recipe - very moist banana bread.  I use 3 mashed bananas and a pot of strawberry yoghurt instead of the sour cream. I don't melt the butter just soften for mixing.  I have made this a few times now and its always very yummy.

Added extra vanilla, mashed the bananas and used pecans.  Ovens are always different so baking time was 55 min.  
This is the best I have ever made and family loves it.

this recipe was so easy and delicious! i usually keep most of the ingredients on hand, so i can see this being made again and again.  the second time i didn't have sour cream, and it wasn't as moist, but still delicious. i did as advised, and mashed the bananas(about 3 large), and sprinkled cinnamon over the top before baking. also, i made without walnuts since they weren't on hand. still fantastic! and the smell of it baking is also a plus!  :)

50 plus times, that is how often I have made this recipe. As I avoid processed foods, I substituted all purpose flour for organic whole wheat flour and white sugar with organic evaporated cane sugar. I don't prefer vanilla, so I left that out. 
Also, as with most recipes, if you are using salted butter you may want to skip adding the salt. Even a pinch can become too salty.
I grease my pans with the paper towel/butter method. Works like a charm every time and is much healthier than cooking spray.
It is KEY to mix together wet ingredients in one bowl and the dry ones in another. Always put dry into wet when blending so you dont lose any of the butter or egg in the process. I have never "folded" things into recipes. I just break the bananas and blend them in well and blend in the sour cream.

I've made this several times now; the only thing I changed was to mash the bananas, as many other reviewers suggested. Such a great recipe, thanks!

I've been making banana bread for years using the same recipe.  It always tasted good but it had shortening in it and I was looking for a recipe that didn't include it.  I found this recipe and at first, I was skeptical about using sliced bananas rather than mashed, but I went ahead and followed the recipe and the bread turned out fantastic!  It was so good, I made a second loaf that same day. I liked using the sour cream, it makes it super moist and really adds to the overall flavor.  I left out the nuts and added sparkling white sugar to the top before baking.  It gave it a nice crunch to go with the soft moist inside.

This was super easy to do, didn't require a bunch of ingredients that I didn't have.  I experimented with cranberry raisins on half of the bread.  Turned out great!

I took the advice of other reviewers and mashed the bananas. I also added cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and clove because I love spiced banana bread. Instead of making a loaf I used a large muffin pan, so I had to adjust the baking time accordingly (mine baked about 35 min). The bread turned out moist and flavorful and I will be making the augmented recipe again.

BEST banana bread ever. I've made it a couple of times, and like most others have made my own MINOR changes: I use mashed bananas, rather than sliced, using a potato masher so there is some texture rather than a paste of banana. I use 1/4 c less sugar than the recipe calls for (a total of 1/2 less, since I double it) and use more ripe banana. Sometimes I add finely chopped milk chocolate instead of the walnuts (The Hubbs loves chocolate-chip banana bread). And, lastly, I use reduced-fat sour cream. I tend to bake this as a "banana bread cake" in a sprinform pan, since it's gobbled up so quickly. I have to say this is the most moist, flavorful and delicious banana bread I have EVER made. Thank you!

I "tweaked" this recipe and liked it very much.  I whipped the bananas and sour cream together until creamy, added the sugar and eggs, then the dry ingredients.  My husband thought this was the best.  Mine baked about 65 minutes at 350 and came out perfectly.  I will definitely make this one again.

I joined this site just so I could comment on this bread. This bread is THE best I have ever had. I have always liked banana bread but I've never been able to eat it without first applying a layer of butter. No More! Sometimes i just grab a spoon and take a chunk. :)

In the past 3 days I've made 14 loaves of this stuff. My wife brought some to work and now everyone is wanting to by a loaf for $7-10. I followed the recipe exactly except I mash the bananas with a hand masher (not too much, its still fairly coarse). I make 2 loaves at a time and just double the recipe. Perfect every time. Thank you so much! I will make banana bread using this recipe for the rest of my life. Next batch I'm going to add some chocolate chips! OMG.

These are delicious.  Very moist and yummy.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I turned my bread into muffins and added 1 more banana, just because I had 3 browning bananas on the counter that I didn't want to waste.  I also added a small handful of chocolate chips ;) For muffins, you just cut the cooking time in half or so.  I just checked them after 20 minutes until a toothpick came out clean.  It made 24 muffins. Yum!

I used light sour cream and added 1 tsp cinnamon.  I made this in my mixer (I read another review that said this would make it less dense: mine was a spongy moist cake).  I slice my ripe (but not brown inside) bananas as thin as I can, and enjoy the pieces in the bread/cake.    

I would like to make it with less sugar, as I find it too sweet.  Maybe 3/4 - 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup, and a mix of brown and white sugar.  Yogurt could easily sub for the sour cream.

I am not a fan of bananas, but I had some bananas that were ready to go bad so I found this recipe and gave it a try. I made 2 breads and in 2 days they were gone, no not by me, but I did taste a slice and was very moist. Followed the recipe with the exception of using half white sugar and half brown sugar and used 3 bananas in each batch.  They all said put this in the keeper file.

A few months ago, I started baking muffins for my extremely busy family so that we can eat breakfast every day.  This is their favorite recipe to date and I get ORDERS for it!  The only mods I've made (per the reviews) were 1)I use brown sugar usually and cut it back to about 3/4 cup.  The muffins come out browner and seem to hold up better.  2) Increase bananas to 3 and mash them for more consistency throughout the bread/muffin.  If making muffins, I can get about a dozen out of this recipe and they last for DAYS (we refrigerate after day 2 though).  Bake muffins for about 1/2 hour at 350 but check your oven after 25. Adding chocolate chips is a great idea too!

Definitely moist and it has good flavor.  Just isn't a winner for our family due to moistness, texture and visually. I even tried with mashed bananas and it was still voted not a keeper here.

We had a couple of bananas that were going south, and I picked this recipe because it has a five star rating. I followed the recipe exactly as given, and hubby says that it is the best banana bread he has ever eaten - moist and flavorful. I did suggest that next time I make a couple of adjustments to the recipe, but he has forbidden me from changing a thing. The five star rating is well-deserved!

I love this recipe, it's the (thinly sliced) bananas that make it different! Stick with the slices and use a spatula to mix the batter, and you won't find any weird purple chunks, just concentrated, intense banana flavor.  I will admit to one tweak:  I add 1/4 tsp freshly ground nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Perfect!

I think this is a great recipe.  I tried it with Hodgson Mill gluten free baking mix.  The center of the loaf was a little sunken in, but I didn't notice any effect on the taste.  The loaf was super moist with a nice chewy crust on the outside.  I am baking a second loaf with regular flour for my picky boyfriend.  

I made this exactly according to recipe.

I used whole wheat and bean four because that's what I had and it still turned out super yummy! My husband nor his brother had any idea I used bean four and they thought this bread recipe was the best I've made yet. I would definitely make it again. Oh and I cut back a bit on the sugar and used brown instead of white. Very moist

Pure amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them.  It was delicious!

I've tried this recipe several times now and it has come out great each time.  The only changes I made were 1)to use room temp margarine (because I'm lazy and cheap), 2)to mash the bananas, and 3) replace the flour with gluten free flour mix.  This recipe is a keeper for me. Thank you!

The key to this recipe is to MASH or PUREE the bananas.  It is equally important to add just a little less than 1/2 cup of sour cream, not a heaping 1/2 cup of sour cream.  If you add too much sour cream the bread will be spongy and wet.  Also added 1/2 teaspoon more of sugar and vanilla to sweeten it up a bit based on other reviewers suggestions.  I used whole wheat flour as a personal preference and with all of these modifications it turned out to be a 5 star banana bread.

This is such a great recipe. I use 4oz of Stonyfield any kind of yogurt on hand instead of the sour cream...usually, vanilla, or banana or pumpkin banana, my daughters favorite flavors. I use 2 tsp of baking powder only. I stir everything and use room temperture butter 6 hours plus....I also make sure I mash the bananas really good with a potato masher (like a puree)...this I believe helps it cook evenly and distribute flavor...this comes out AMAZING every time!!!

This is a fabulous recipe! The first time I made it, I made it for my husband but I ended up eating most of it! This is my go to recipe. Its really good. I usually don't add the walnuts bc my husband hates nuts but I will always add a bit of cinnamon to it and the last time I added an extra banana. Really good stuff!

I lost my banana bread that I had been using, so I found this one. I only changed a few things, but nothing that would affect the recipe as written. First of all, I mashed the bananas with a back of a fork due to my husband not liking hunks of bananas in his bread. I also used light sour cream, as that's all I buy and all I had on hand. I also just used softened butter, as that's what I always do with baking recipes.

The taste and the moistness were awesome! My only issue was that, even though I mashed the bananas, they still came out purple-looking. I think it's because I used 3 bananas that needed to be used, so perhaps there were too many bananas? Definitely will make this again. :D

This banana bread was very moist.  I did mash the bananas instead of slicing as I don't like chunks of banana.  Everyone that ate it loved it.  Thanks for sharing, this one is a keeper!

I have been making banana bread for 45 years and although good, was dense. I must say KUDOS for this recipe. There will never be another banana bread recipe in this house. It is so light and fluffy! Thank you for sharing! The ONLY change I made was I used room temperature butter and creamed it with the sugar. A+ TOP NOTCH RECIPE!

I will still use the yogurt next time I make this recipe.

I didn't change anything except that I substituted banana yogurt for sour cream and chocolate chips for the nuts.  It's delicious.  
Dense and moist.  The slices hold up pretty well too; not crumbly.

I very rarely change a recipe - especially when baking.  But, after reading reviews of many different recipes on this site, I did on this one.  I used cake flour; 1/2 brown sugar instead of all white; I only had 2 small bananas so I grated a granny smith apple along with the banana; and, I used mostly plain greek yogurt since I only had a couple spoonfuls of sour cream left.  It came out great - really moist and while it didn't have a really strong banana flavor it was still a very tasty banana bread.

I would have given it 5 stars, but with all the rave reviews I was expecting to have my socks knocked off.  However, it is still probably one of the best banana breads I have had.  I made a double batch as I had quite a few bananas; 3 frozen and 3 over ripe.  As others mentioned I did not slice them, but since the non-frozen ones were less "mushy" than the ones from the freezer I still ended up with some smaller chunks, which was nice.  I skipped the nuts since no one in the family cares for them.  Half the batch I made into mini muffins and the other half I made into a loaf.  I scooped out about 1/2 cup of batter and mixed some cocoa powder in it, then dropped about 1/4 tsp of the choco mix into each mini muffin and took a tooth pick and swirled it.  Turned out pretty good and a nice change.  In the loaf I added chocolate chips, because what's banana bread without chocolate chips?  My daughter told me the muffins were "AWESOME".  Very moist and lots of flavour.  I will make this one again.

I made this (as called for minus the walnuts) in a cast iron loaf pan (9x5) and it took 10 minutes longer than called for, but it still turned out really well.  It maybe could have used a little more time in the oven, but my skewer came out clean when I checked so I took it out anyway.  It was super good, and my kids wanted to eat the whole loaf in one sitting.  I said no.

This was Ah-mazing! I used brown sugar instead of white because it was all I had. I mashed the bananas to a pulp and used greek vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream. Also I used baking powder instead of baking soda. This was so so so good! As it baked the whole house smelt heavenly. You're suppose to let it cool down, but i had a nibble when it came right out of the oven, I couldn't resist! I would suggest baking it a little less than an hour, since as mine came out a little browned along the edges. Still, that only made for a more crisp outer layer leading to a delicate soft and moist center. I bake in the night, so I hope it's still here in the morning for everyone else to have try!

Absolutely the best Banana bread I've ever made and I've tried like 5 from this site alone.  I doubled the recipe but cut out a quarter of the sugar, replaced one third of the white flour for wholemeal and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  It was so soft and great for toasting as well.  Made two loaves.

Truly the best banana bread that I've had.  It is amazing as is, never had a problem just following the recipe directly as stated.  I tend to add 1 tsp. cinnamon and for special occasions, it is great with about 1 cup of chocolate chips and/or peanut butter chips.  Thank you for sharing this recipe - always a crowd pleaser!

Waka, waka ... is this bread fantastic!! This is definitely going to be my go-to recipe for banana bread from now on. I did tweak it according to one reviewer's suggestions:  used softened instead of melted butter; used 1-3/4 cups flour; added 1 tsp lemon juice; added 1 tsp baking powder; mashed bananas instead of sliced. I know this sounds like a lot of tweaking, but it's just basic stuff. I'm quite sure the recipe would be exceptional as-is (except I would definitely mash the bananas, not slice the buggers). Ooh, one note. When I baked it for the 1 hour, when I checked on it the bread seemed to be overbaked; it was quite brown and almost smelled burnt. However, once it cooled and it came time to eat it, I discovered that this is the perfect time to bake it, since it gave it a very nice crust. I know sometimes the top of banana bread can be almost mushy, but this one turned out perfect at the 1 hour baking time.

I loved how simple this recipe is but I the taste of the banana bread wasn't as good as I was expecting. While the cake was moist I found it extremely sweet despite halving the sugar. The next time I make it will likely use about 60-70g of brown sugar instead (I converted to metric). There wasn't enough of a banana taste either. I would strongly recommend adding 1 more banana. I would also increase the walnuts to about 100g, as I found 60g is too little for the amount of batter.

I made this but I made a few changes. First I added cinnamon, nutmeg, ad cloves to enhance the flavor. I put a little extra banana and used mashed bananas instead of sliced. I also added some chocolate chips. I added less sugar and used softened butter, not melted. I also added a teaspoon of baking powder. It turned out pretty good but I have a better recipe.

I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. This is a delicious recipe.

I followed the recipe except for the walnuts as there is an allergy to them.  It was good but I will add more bananas and will mash them next time. I don't like the looks and texture of the bread with large pieces of cooked bananas in it. There is not enough banana flavoring with just two bananas. I think adding 1 teas.cinnamon and 1/4 teas nutmeg and using half brown sugar and half white sugar are also good ideas.

Fantastic recipe.  I used 1 cup of mashed bananas and added the lemon juice to it. I did use 1 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. of baking soda; and used 1 3/4 cups of flour total.  I placed all dry ingredients together and mixed well. In another pan, I melted the butter and when lukewarm; added the 2 eggs and mixed well and added the sour cream and mixed well, then added to flour mixture, (folded in).  Placed in 9x5 pan sprayed with baking Pam spray.  I did have to leave in oven for an additional 15 minutes. Last 20 minutes covered loaf pan with a tented foil to prevent darker top of loaf.  After 10 minutes, placed on wire rack to cool.  Delicious recipe. Thanks for sharing recipe.  My go to recipe from now on.

This is the best recipe for banana bread that I have tried - very rich and so delicious. The sour cream makes this so moist and dense.  I did tweek, based on the other reviews - mashing bananas instead of sliced, and used an extra banana. I also needed to bake for 70 minutes, but that could just be my oven. This is my new go-to recipe for banana bread for sure!

Wow, thanks for a great recipe~ so many banana breads I've tried are too dry.  This one was seriously moist.  It was delicious--per another reviewer I did 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder.  I also added in cloves and cinnamon because I like it spicy.  But other than that, followed it to the "T" and am so glad I did!  Thanks again!

This is, the best from scratch recipe I have found.  I have tried many and they always disappointed me.  I did smash the bananas rather than slice, and I omit the nuts because I just don't like that.  Otherwise, it's terrific.  Give it a shot.

I've tried banana bread in the past and it never turns out right...but this!!!  Awesome!  I did make a few changes.  I up'd the bananas to 1 cup mashed and used margarine instead of butter.  I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.  The best I ever tasted.   Next time I will try it with real butter; I'm sure it will be to die for!

Delicious!  The only thing I did differently was mush up the bananas a bit more; the original recipe said to slice them.  It was moist and delicious!  I think that the sour cream really did the trick.

GREAT!  My husband just loves it.  I couldn't believe how much it weighed, but is it ever good.  As mentioned before the addition of a tsp of lemon juice gave it that something extra.  Will be making this again.

Fantastic! I mashed the bananas as other reviewers suggested, used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white, and threw in a handful of chocolate chips. This was gone in a matter of minutes, yum!

Wow! I love this recipe.  For my first time, I left out the walnuts and used semi-sweet chocolate chips. 
I doubled the recipe and made a loaf (65 minutes) and a dozen muffins (45 minutes.)  I now the walnuts will be great too, but honestly, this bread didn't need any stir-ins.

I've tried quite a few banana bread recipes over the years and NOTHING comes close to this one!  It is moist and has a wonderful flavor (it may be the sour cream combo, since I've never had a recipe use it)  I'll definitely be making this again soon!

Wonderful. I replaced the sour cream with some low-fat vanilla yogurt, and adjusted the sugar to 1/2 c no-cal sweetener, 1/4 c white sugar, 1/4 c brown sugar, and omitted the walnuts due to to a picky husband.

I loved this with the addition of cinnamon, fresh lemon juice and less sugar (I used 3/4 cup). I mashed the bananas as did others. It needs to sit overnight for best texture.

Ohh wooowwww, this bread is amazing! Tasted the left over batter and had to scrape the bowl clean. Shared the finished product with my pilots (I'm a flight attendant) and they couldn't get enough of it. Also helped, I'm sure that my bananas were practically black. The riper the better! Will be a regular every time I forget to eat my bananas!

My family loves this bread and my husband gets so excited when I make it! I do as others have stated and mash the banana and I also add 1tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp each of baking powder and baking soda. My family also loves it when I put a brown suger/ cinnamon crumble over the whole top, right before it goes in the oven! Makes a wonderfully crunchy top and just adds a little more flavor to this great recipe :)

The cake is very tasty but I also found that the sliced bananas became lumps of goo and dark in color.  I wish I had read the reviews before making this bread.

Only had 3/8 cup of butter (not 1/2 cup) and in an attempt to be healthy, I only used 3/4 cup sugar (not 1 cup). Used 3 medium sized old bananas, mashed up, and added ~1/4-1/3 cup of dried cherries. Next time, I'd use more cherries or dried cranberries.

I modified this recipe just a bit.  While mixing the first part ingredients I had 3 large bananas in a deep pan and added 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white rum and chopped walnuts.  I skipped the sour cram and added the 'banana foster' concoction.  The bread came out soooooo moist and delicious. Everyone in the house loved it!

This has been the best banana bread recipe I've found so far.  I didn't have any sour cream on hand so I substituted goat cheese mixed with a tad bit of half/half and it was even better than with the sour cream! This will be my go- to for banana bread from now on :)

I love it. It's that simple. I recommend taking some time off of the baking, though, because I managed to overcook it. However, even with it getting overdone, it STILL tastes great! It's not all dried up and yucky. I recommend keeping a close eye on it and adding the pecans. So good!

This was awesome. I didn't have any sour cream at home so I used yogurt plus I didn't have enough white sugar so I used half white & half brown sugar.

Not sure why there's such a pattern of reviewers on this site telling how they've changed a recipe on someone else's recipe. It's then a different recipe. Anyway, I made this one exactly as written, and it was absolutely perfect! I particularly like the sliced bananas. Nicely different. You get these little banana power bites. Thanks for sharing Janet's great recipe!

My oven cooks hot. When I pulled the loaf from the oven, i noticed it was only slightly darker than the picture that accompanied the recipe. I let it sit over night and brought it to work. My co-workers loved this! I was moist, had excellent texture and without a doubt, delicious! I will make this again... and again... and again! Much better than the Joy of Cooking recipe!

Made them into cupcakes. Forgot how long I made them for. Added about 1/2 cup of regular sized chocolate chips. Had great reviews! The cupcakes were moist and tasty.

This banana bread was so moist and delicious.  I used mashed bananas instead of sliced (approx. 1 cup mashed) and the loaf turned out great.  This recipe is definitely a keeper. Will be making this again.

I have found my go to banana bread recipe! I add about 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and mash the bananas. I also find that it is done about 10 minutes before the cooking time that is specified in the recipe. I don't add the nuts, because my daughter doesn't like them. I have made this twice so far, and it turns out brown, moist and delicious. The entire loaf gets eaten in a day, and my husband says that it is better than his mother's banana bread.

I have made this bread several times (sans walnuts and mashing the bananas instead of slicing) and it turns out great! Even subbed plain greek yogurt for the sour cream and it was good.  Not too sweet or heavy.  I have made it in mini-muffin pans and loaf pans. Very yummy!

This is a phenomenal recipe, not too much sweet or too much banana but a perfectly delicious blend of all the flavors you would desire in a loaf of banana bread. I bake this at least once every other week and my family just loves it! I would love to have more recipes by "Janet" for any baked goods.

I have tried several banana bread recipes over the years and this one is by far the best. It must be the sour cream that makes this bread so moist. I have made the recipe several times and I'm always asked to write it down. Absolutely yummy! Will never use another banana bread recipe.

great banana bread recipe. I work in food service and needed something quick and easy to make and this was it. I have gotten so many compliments on this. Says really moist. I double the batch and make a batch every day.  I do squish the bananas instead of slicing.

This is a fabulous recipe!!! I made 2 changes with the first being I added 12oz of blueberry yogurt (I didn't have any sour cream) & the second,  I mashed the bananas. OMG, amazing!!!!!! I will never use another recipe!!! This is the BEST!!!!! So very moist & IMO, the blueberry adds a great flavor!!!

By far the best banana bread I've ever had! I took another reviewers advice and added about a Tbl of fresh lemon juice, and also mashed the bananas as per suggestion. So glad I did! Yummy!

Super moist and yummy. I used very ripe bananas and mashed them into the batter and it was awesome.

I have made this banana bread over and over again. It is ALWAYS the hit of the party! It is so very moist and very rich. I do add a tbsp of almond extract and sometimes add a half a cup of blueberries. Never a crumb left over....Never! ( p.s. I always double the recipe and freeze a loaf...PERFECT even after being frozen 2 months!)

This recipe was AMAZING with the following revisions:
I didn't slice the bananas, I mashed them up. I really don't like the taste and texture of bananas by themselves, so slicing seemed unappealing. I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown. It turned out DELICIOUS.

I give this recipe five stars for deliciousness with some changes based on other's reviews.  I chose this recipe over the other banana bread recipes because others called for 3 cups of sugar and 4 1/2 cups of flour and I only wanted one loaf!!  So I made this recipe without adding any nuts and also added one extra banana (3 total). I mashed the bananas based on other's recommendations.  I also added a crumb topping before baking of 1/3 c packed brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 tablespoon butter. It took an extra 20 minutes to bake (maybe because I added an extra banana??) and I had to tent it with foil the last 1/2 hour because the topping was getting too dark. But it was worth the wait. Very yummy. Thank you.

Overall, this recipe produced a very moist bread. It was easy to prepare...instead of chopping, I opted to mash the bananas. Will be making this again this weekend.

This was delicious! I used King Arthur Gluten Free flour (trying to go gluten free) and it still came out beautifully--so moist!  I also used a scant cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I follow other reviews suggestions and mushed the bananas into small chunks instead of larger slices.  I also added 1/2tsp. cinnamon, 1/4tsp. allspice.  I only have mini loaf pans and it made two perfectly, so i put choco chips in one for my hubby and coconut in mine :)

Thank you Janet -  whoever you are. This is the best banana bread we've ever had! Moist beyond belief but with a nice sweet crust.
One early reviewer said she creamed soft butter & sugar together, rather than the melted butter called for.  I agree - creamed butter & sugar is best.  Aside from that, only change I made was to add 1TBS Meyer's Dark Rum (made another banana bread recipe that called for rum & liked it). This will be my go-to banana bread recipe and I might not even share it with my friends - just keep it as my little secret!

Delish as is and a great base as well.  I've added pecans, flax and chocolate chips and the bread has been awesome.  I've also done half whole wheat flour half all purpose as well as half brown sugar and half white.  It's also great with half butter half applesauce if you're looking to save a few calories.  Oatmeal sprinkled on top gives it a good crunch as well.

Smells so good in the kitchen now as I just finished baking it. Even the dog decided to stay in the kitchen now. 
I omitted salt (used salted butter instead) and toasted nuts instead of walnuts (they're very expensive here). I mashed one banana and sliced the other. 
Result: very moist bread. Unfortunately, I'm on my pre-easter fasting period, so my husband is my taste-tester. He couldn't stop munching it. Hope he'll leave some for me to taste once Easter is here.

Best Banana Bread ever.  So moist yet it cooks through just right.  Prior to this recipe I had the hardest time getting my banana bread to be  cooked in the middle without being too  dry on the ends.  The ONLY recipe I use now.

This recipe is rich and moist. However purée the bananas and add about 20 min baking time. I found 60 min was just not enough for a clean toothpick.

I have made this many times, exactly as written and it is so moist and delicious. Love it!

I usually add cinnamon to the mixture and then for a yummy topping, I add a cinnamon/ sugar mixture to the top which adds a bit of a crunchy texture to the muffins! Also, I use very ripe bananas. I have never had anyone that has eaten them say they didn't like them.

Great Recipe! Moist and Delicious! Left out the Nuts, due to i am not a fan of nuts in bread. I Used 3 Banana's Mashed, Also used a little less then 1/2 c Sour Cream (Was running low!) And recipe still turned out perfect! I baked at 325* i was using a dark loaf pan, and the loaf only took about 45 minutes baking time to be at perfection!

Fantastic banana bread! Made as written, but mashed the bananas, using more than called for b/c I had about 4 that needed used up and followed naples34102 and added in 1 tsp. lemon juice, 1 tsp. baking powder and and extra 1/4 cup of flour to compensate for the extra bananas that I used. Rich, moist and delicious...a definite keeper and a new favorite! Thanks for sharing. :)

YUMM!! I added an extra half cup of bananas, and 1/4 cup flour, and had to bake it an extra 15 minutes. But it is delicious!!!!!! best I've ever had. a little cinnamon might be a nice touch every once in a while.

Very good bread! Followed the recipe to a tee minus walnuts, our family does not care for nuts. I did mash the bananas instead of leaving them in slices. The banana flavor wasn't as strong as I like it, I will add an extra banana next time. Maybe two :)

I won't use this recipe again.  I am looking for a flavor from a Chiquita Banana recipe book done in the 40s or 50s.  My Mom made banana bread using this recipe.  This one just did not have enough banana flavor for me.  Sorry.

I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 cup splenda and 1/2 cup sugar to sweeten both loaves. It was plenty sweet. Used a blender to mix wet ingredients plus mash bananas.

As many have said, this is delicious! I made it as listed but added 1/2 cup coconut shavings and substituted 1/4 of the flour for coconut flour. I also used allspice, ground clove and cinnamon. Nutritionally I'd substitute lowfat yogurt in place of the sour cream (1/2 cup sour cream is 200+ calories, 1/2 cup lowfat yogurt is 50-60). Very tasty!

This bread is delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out moist and tasty.  I don't usually add nuts to recipes, but I did to this bread.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  The sliced bananas added wonderful banana flavor and made the recipe less work (than having to mash the bananas).  Thank you for a great recipe!

Stellar recipe.  As per other reviewers' suggestions, we used softened butter and creamed it with the white sugar to start, and we later mashed the bananas instead of slicing them.  We also threw in some chocolate chips.  It's a wonderful, dense bread.  We'll definitely make it again.

Fantastic!! Super moist. I LOVED the banana chunks. So glad I tried that instead of mashing like I normally would. I just thought there was a good reason the author of the recipe specified that detail. I even used whole wheat flour and my husband didn't know the difference.

Made this for my hubby for Valentine's Day.  Followed the recipe to a T.   When I opened the oven door, I discovered that my silicone loaf pan collasped, and about 1/3 of the bread was on the bottom of my oven - that has never happened before. I bake with pan all the time (baked something else in it last night and it was fine). The bread looked very moist and not entirely baked.  The taste was very different to the bread we are used to.  I will stick with the recipe my family loves from my Country Living Cookbook.  Sorry, can't recommend this one.

Truly amazing and so simple.  My family has requested that for events, I NOT bake.  That's how bad I am, but I pulled this off perfectly.  I even got gutsy and sprinkled a few chocolate chips in.  I followed the first "rater's" recipe to a tee, i.e. smashed bananas, baking powder and soda, 1-3/4 c, flour....  Just wonderful - thanks!

I took this to work and several banana bread lovers said this is the best they have ever tasted.  I crushed the bananas slightly and used twice as many called for.  Awesome.

This bread is a big hit with the whole family.  Instead of slicing the bananas, we used a hand mixer and blended them until smooth.  Go ahead and double this recipe.  Your family will thank you!

I really liked this recipe! It was SO easy which was my favourite part! 
I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream and after reading the reviews I mashed the bananas instead of slicing. Next time I have leftover bananas I will definitely use this recipe!

So moist and flavor is great.  I used 3 bananas, chopped.  My husband who is not big on banana bread ate half the loaf.

Very good.  I did make the changes suggested by naples34102 and added more walnuts and did 4 bananas.  Really moist and tasty!

If you're like me,you've tried MANY different banana bread recipes.Most come out,just okay.
  This is the only one I will use from now on.
  The only change,I substituted pecans for the walnuts.

Awesome.  Followed the recipe to a T (except for mashing the bananas instead of slicing) and it turned out moist and delicious! Thanks for the amazing recipe!

What more can I say than YUUUUUM!  I had been making another recipe from this site for a couple of years but decided it just wasn't perfect enough.  Found this one and think my search is finally over.  The sour cream gave it moistness and a delicious tang.  I mashed my bananas as others suggested.

This is sooo delicious. I prefer to try and make healthier food so i sub the butter for olive oil, use 1 c. white whole wheat flour 1/2 c. all purpose flour and use about 1/2 c. sugar plus some chocolate chips for the kids. These make great muffins, they cook in about 15-18 minutes at 350. Much faster than the one hour for a loaf.

This is by far my favorite recipe for banana bread. We didn't have sour cream on hand, so I substituted it with Chobani honey greek yogurt. Even my two boys ate it...which is saying something!

This is just an amazing recipe! It was so good that I made it twice in one week! I didn't have a loaf pan so I used an 8x8 cake pan and baked it at 350 for 35-40 minutes. It was PERFECT! I too mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. This could easily be spiced up with cinnamon, nutmeg an/or cloves. Enjoy!

I am on my third loaf using this recipe.  It is really simple and tastes great.  You can add more or less banana and it still turns out yummy.  I also used Splenda Blend baking sugar which cuts down on some of the calories.  I also mash the bananas instead of slicing them.

This is an awesome recipe!  I didn't have sour cream so I used mayonnaise instead. I used only 1/4 cup of mayonnaise.  When I make born bread I add some mayonnaise, it makes it moist so I figured it'll do the same for the banana nut bread. Yummy! Everyone loved the banana bread.  For the mini muffins it took about 30 minutes (I used a mini toaster oven).

Rav reviews from my husband and he doesn't even eat banana bread typically.  This was one of the best.  I initially did exactly as ingredients listed with exception of more bananas and mashed them instead of sliced.  Awesome!!!

This has made me a lover of banana bread. I use three bananas - it was moist and delicious! I've also made pumpkin bread using this base recipe, swapping canned pumpkin puree for the bananas, omitted nuts and added some spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.)

First time making banana bread and I must say it was a very simple receipe.  It was nice and dense, moist, and the top had a nice crunch...next time I'll make a crumble topping.  Few alterations: I added 1/2c plain low fat yogurt instead of sour cream, added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, and I also mashed the bananas.  My husband already sneaked 3 pieces and loves it.

This banana bread recipe was awesome!  It is a 5 as is, but some changes I have made to it are:  substitute buttermilk for the sour cream and sprinkle a handful of mini chocolate chips into the batter right before putting it into the oven...thanks for sharing, this recipe is certainly a keeper!  Every time I make it, I want to sign on and rate it with 5 stars!

Following the adjustments from Napples, this banana bread is perfect!

I live in Japan and the sour cream here is VERY thick, and very expensive, so I used a natural, plain, thick yogurt, and it worked like a charm.

Thank you Janet and Napples

I used a cup of mashed bananas rather than sliced bananas like other reviews suggested.  My son declared it the best banana bread I've made.

Delicious!  I, too, mashed the bananas and instead of walnuts, used 1/4c dried cranberries and 1/4c raisins.  Nice and crisp on the outside.  I used a stone loaf pan.  Beautiful brown.

Amazing! Mashed 3 bananas and used 1/4 sour cream and 1/4 yogurt because I didn't have enough sour cream. So good. Then made a cinnamon glaze to go over bread.

I have been making the EBNB recipe from this site for a couple of years but it is just so highly caloric I went searching for a replacement.  Ah, search no more!  This one is a keeper and tolerated a "reduced fat" sour cream very well. So moist, very good banana flavor.  I did mash the bananas after I read a previous reviewer thought the "sliced" bananas were like "biting into a bruise"!!!!!

I subbed 1/2 cup butter for 1/4 c. butter, 1/4 c. applesauce.  I also used 1/4 c. sugar in the raw and 1/4 c. white sugar.  Absolutely delicious.  This will be my new go-to banana bread recipe!

My husband and father love this recipe.  I think my husband tries to convince my daughter not to eat bananas in hopes they will get very ripe and I will be forced to make banana bread.  Wonderful recipe and very easy. I do follow the advice of using 1 cup of smashed bananas (which is 2-3 bananas).

i love this recipe....but i did make a couple changes.
1 i add more banana....i use about 4 or 5 medium bananas, to make sure it tastes extra bananay.  2 instead of walnuts (which i dont like) add almond slivers.  it gives it such a different taste than other banana breads and lastly dont skimp on the vanilla.  i use 1-1/2 to 2 tsp of vanilla.  i have made this bread about 5 times now, and its is amazingly moist and delicious!

Moist and delicious!  Great way to use up some over ripe bananas.  Took everyone's advice and mashed the bananas instead of slice.  Will definitely make again.

The only thing I did different was use 3 bananas and I mashed them instead of slicing them. It also took about an hour and 15 minutes for it to bed done. It is AWESOME!! I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I am on the hunt for the best banana bread recipe ever, and this is currently at the top of my list!  I make it almost exactly per the recipe, the only differences being that I mash the bananas and I usually add a couple of extra tablespoons of butter.  My favorite is when it's fresh out of the oven and just cooled enough to eat!  The crust is AMAZING!!!  Unfortunately the crunchy crust goes away the next day, but it's still absolutely delicious!  I always get asked for the recipe, and have even received a marriage proposal because of it.  Yes, it's that good!

This was one of the best banana bread recipes I have ever made and so simple. I sliced the bananas VERY thin and had no problems with the sliced vs mashed bananas that others had.  I did substitute whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the 1 1/2 cups of flour the recipe called for, but that was the only substitution I made.  DELICIOUS bread!

this recipe was the best, I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup, it was still great! very moist, great flavor. One thing though after a day or so the banana's inside turned black, so the next time i will blend the bananas.

This was my first time making banana bread and this recipe was so easy I thought I was doing it wrong.  After reading the other reviews, I decided to do half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white and added the extra banana (2 mashed, 1 sliced).  I also added some chocolate chips.  I thought for sure with my additions I would mess it up, but I was wrong - it came out perfect!  Thanks so much for this recipe.

I was a little nervous putting this in the oven, as the batter seemed really runny, but it turned out spectacular. The whole loaf was eaten before it had cooled completely! I guess my family liked it! The only change I made was I used fat free greek yogurt instead of sour cream - I just didn't have any. It was a great addition! I will use this recipe again!

Took others advice, changed the flour to 1 3/4 cups, added 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon baking powder and measured 1 cup of smashed bananas.
Made original & the changed recipe.  Both were good but I did like the changed one better.  I think the baking powder really helped.  Thanks for your recipe!
Hubby loved it!

Super moist. I agree with a previous reviewer that mashing the bananas is better...unless you don't mind biting into big chunks of slimy banana. (I just made this for my German guy...in Germany. It survived substituting baking powder for baking soda...by doubling the powder and omitting the salt. It also survived his picky German palate! His conclusion..."This is cake and...it is good!)

Cream softened butter with the sugar (not melted). I add 1 tsp. lemon juice with the vanilla, and use 1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder, and 1-3/4 c. flour, I didn't have sour cream so I used Vanilla yogurt and my family went crazy for it and beg me everyday to make more. Thanks for the recipe

Excellent moist banana bread as written.  I double this recipe today as I had 6 very ripe banana's I wanted to use up.  I made two loaves and 24 mini muffins.  The only thing I added was I dusted the bottoms and tops with a sugar cinnamon mix.

This was an amazing recipe! I used a ricer on my bananas because I dont like the texture of banana so I wanted no lumps or chunks anywhere.  Other than that I followed the recipe. I didnt have walnuts so I replaced them with chocolate chips and it was GREAT.

Great recipe! Only changes I made because of nut allergy, I substituted chocolate chips for the walnuts, and I used nonfat plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, I also added 3 Tbs ground flax seed. Everyone loved it. Only made the changes due to allergies and what I had on hand. Yummy!

Turned out great! I used 3 bananas to get 1 cup, and I had to use a small loaf pan (where each loaf is 2"x3") and cooked it for half the amount of time called for, and it turned out PERFECT! Will definitely be making this recipe again.

This recipe is very good.  It vanishes quickly.  I make it to pack for breakfast for my toddler who needs a lot of calories to maintain his weight.  I add chocolate chunks, always mash the bananas, and use vanilla or banana yogurt instead of sour cream.  I use a beater too.  I am sure others take more time and care in the preparation but this works just fine and really is a quick bread to make that the whole family loves.  Very moist with good crust and comes out of the pan easy.

Just as dense, moist, and delicious as promised.  My modifications based on reviews:
3 bananas.
Mushed them instead of slicing.
Added baking soda right before the oven so it wouldn't fall.
Fat free plain yogurt instead of sour cream.
Instead of sugar I used half splenda, half brown sugar and put in some cinnamon.  
Semi-sweet chocolate chips I had in the cabinet instead of nuts.
No salt.
Took out at 50 minutes.

I made this last night following the recipe and it is excellent. A very dense bread instead of being cake-like. I added 1/2 tsp cardamom which enhanced the flavor.

I made this today and it was amazing!!!  Unfortunately I didn't have sour cream so I replaced it with a half of a cup of no sugar added apple sauce and i didn't melt the butter but waited until it was room temperature.  I also mashed the bananas because my husband and I are not big fans of chunks of fruit in our bread.  I had to cook it for about 20 min longer because of the added moisture but it still tasted great.  This will be going into our make again recipe box!!

I tried this recipe for the first time the other day and have made it three times since! My husband and all 4 kids LOVE this bread.  The only changes I made were to add 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon. Perfect!

This is the best banana bread recipe ever. Nice and moist not too sweet but just sweet enough. I use 1/2 & 1/2 brown sugar and white sugar and add some extra spices but thats about all that I have changed I also mash up the bananas too and always double the recipie b/c one is never enough. Thank you :)

I made this recipe on a lark, having a few over-ripe bananas on hand. It was delicious-made two loaves and one was finished right away-huge hit!

Truly a KEEPER recipe! Delicious & Simple. Made it two days in a row! A few variations: used unbleached flour, 4 over-ripened Apple Bananas, 
2 tsp vanilla extract, ground alae red hawaiian sea salt & no nuts. My Family LOVES the sliced bananas because of the yummy warm banana chunks-not sure about "the day after" brown banana chunks comment made by another reviewer (this delicious banana bread didn't make it to day two in my house). Also, i like the 325 degrees for 1hr15min and add baking powder suggestions.

This is now my go to recipe for banana bread.  Anytime I deviate and try a different recipe I'm disappointed.  This recipe is easy, delicious, moist and turns out perfectly every time. It gets rave reviews from everyone who tries it.  Even the batter is yummy. I do mash the bananas.

I have made this recipe about dozen times in past 2 months and it came out great every time. Like other reviews I have used smashed vs sliced bananas. In addition I make mine with almonds since I don't like walnuts and it comes out very good.

Totally incredible!! Moist, not too dense, and absolutely delish! Instead of using the full 1/2 cup of butter, I substituted 1/4 cup of applesauce for 1/4 cup, but left the other 1/4 of melted butter in. I also used egg beaters and fat free sour cream, to lighten it.

i used the variations naples34102 seuggested except for the lemon juice. i also sed 1/2c white sugar with 1/2c brown sugar. gave it a deeper flavor and better texture/crust. all brown sugar would be good too. i also added cinnamon, about 1-2tsp would be good to give it a deeper flavor. mashes bananas are better becasue its easoer to mix in, 1cup of it. also sprinkle the top with sugar before baking, gives it a very sweet crispy crust. will be good seared in a frying pan as toast with butter. also chocolate chips are good in it to, about 1/2 cup. all in all this recipe was good, nothing completly outstading but it was tasty

Awesome! Very moist. My entire family loved it!  I don't like bananas but love banana bread. I put two bananas in and it wasn't over powering. You could certainly add another banana for more of banana flavor. Great receipe.

Best banana bread I've ever tasted - very moist!  I used 4 bananas (instead of 2) and softened the butter instead of melting it.

I loved this bread, it was very delicious with a full flavor!  I added cinnamon and a tiny bit of maple extract to it so that it would have a little more flavor and it worked well.  I also thinly sliced the bananas, then mashed them so that it was a banana mash with some pencil eraser-sized chunks, and it worked out perfectly!  Occasional tiny banana chunks in the bread, but still that overall delicious banana flavor in the dough.

Simply delicious :)

I thought I had a great banana bread recipe. doesnt everyone?  so I had 5 bananas, pretty black and decided to make this.  like others I had to make some changes to what I had.  I used some olive oil, apple sauce, yogurt and brown sugar like all of you!  and this was by far the best banana bread I have ever made.  stuck some choc chips in there and the bread is gone.  need to make more.

I made this with my 5-yr-old.  She doesn't like nuts so we didn't include them. Instead of 2 we made it with 3 bananas and added a bit of cinnamon. Delicious and easy to make! Thanks for sharing such a terrific recipe!

One word:  AMAZING.  I followed the recipe as listed, the only substitution being 2 cups of mashed up, overripe bananas, because we love banana-y bread.  Give this one a try - with or without healthy substitutions - I guarantee you will add it to your permanent rotation to use up those ripe bananas.

Wonderful banana bread. I usually always follow directions and ingredients on a recipe the first time, but when I went to the fridge and saw someone used my sour cream I had to use something else. I grabbed a pineapple/coconut yogurt. Tasted great to me! But I will give sour cream a try next time. I also mashed my bananas and put a few dashes of cinnanmon.
UPDATE: I now have made this with sour cream and it's even more wonderful.

I love this recipe! It's not too heavy, yet very moist. Most of all, it's easy to make and uses few ingredients. I did make three minor changes. I creamed the butter and sugar rather than melting it. I also mashed the bananas rather than slicing and left out the nuts because I had none. I will be making a second loaf tomorrow with nuts! This will definitely be my go to recipe for banana bread!

I'm rating it five stars because even though I messed up and used 1 tsp. baking powder instead of baking soda, it turned out delicious.  I omitted the nuts and used milk chocolate chips instead and mashed the bananas.  I'm also learning to use my convection oven and even though I'm not good at it yet, it turned out great!

This recipe is very easy and wow does it taste great!  It's moist and flavorful!  I did add a bit of cinnamon and cranberries and mashed the bananas but it would have been great just as it was written.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  I will be making again soon!

I just made this and it was the BEST banana bread we have ever eaten.  I didn't have any sour cream so used ricotta cheese instead and threw in a handful of chocolate chips and it was yummy.
It was gone instantly

VERY MOIST! I loved it, but I am a HUGE fan of bananas and even 3 mashed bananas wasn't enough for me. I suggest using 4 or 5 bananas. But again, amazing!

Delicious!  Made these for my boyfriend's family and they LOVED it!  Taking the advice from other reviews, I softened the butter and mashed the bananas. Somehow I ended up with too much batter and I was able to fill a loaf pan and a 4" spring form pan...which baked in 40 mins.

This was delicious!!  Made it this weekend!!  It definitely didn't feed 15 of our group...it was gone in no time!  Next time I make it, I'll probably use a touch less sour cream - it was almost "too moist"...if there is such a thing!  So tasty!!

Wonderful banana bread. Only thing I did different is mash the banana's and bake it in 4 mini bread pans. Better recipe than the top rated recipes on this site!

AWESOME! My husband knows a chef and gave him some of this bread. The Chef said that is was GREAT! The only thing that I changed was that I pureed the bananas instead of putting them in chunks.  This is my banana bread recipe for the future. Thanks

This is a lovely recipe and very good.I followed the advice of fellow cooks and whipped the margarine , didnt have butter and sugar together with an electric mixer and mashed bananas.I didnt use nuts cuz I didnt have any and used a full cup of margarine.Talk about moist, this was perfection!!!Kids and hubby loved it with vanilla icecream.

Delicious! I added 3/4 cups of chocolate chips, which made it more like chocolate bread with bananas in it, than banana bread with chocolate in it. Actually didn't mind the switch at all! Great recipe!

Ya know, sometimes you just want to get up early and throw together a nice banana bread with those blackening bananas on the counter without a lot of fuss. My old standby recipe required me to sift leavening together with the flour, soften the butter first (but not too soft!), and bring eggs to room temperature. This recipe is exactly what I was looking for...easy, fool-proof, perfectly moist, and totally fuss free! The flavor is divine. I mashed bananas leaving a few chunky pieces and added 1 tsp. cinnamon and a dash of cloves. Thank you, this recipe is being moved to the forefront of my quick bread recipes!

Wonderful recipe! I included the suggestions from naples34102, but didn't use the baking powder. In addition, I used cooking spray to coat the bottom of the pan, then coated with a cinnamon/sugar mixture. I will pass this recipe on to my kids!

The moistest banana bread ever! I've been for years trying to find the perfect banana bread. This is it! My family thought I bought this bread! The only thing I did differently is I mashed the bananas and added some cinnamon.

DELICIOUS. I used 3 bananas. As per other reviewers' suggestions, I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. The bread was perfectly moist and its flavour was superb! My whole family loved it. My Dad ate quite a lot of it and claimed it was great, and he has never been a big fan of banana bread. This recipe converted him!

I have been trying for many years to find a banana bread recipe that is moist and good without using buttermilk.  With sour cream (which I always have on hand) in this recipe...it is just as good or better than one with buttermilk.  I doubled the recipe.  It made one big loaf and 5 mini loaves.  So yummy!!!!

Very moist, great flavor, and it was actually cooked all the way through the center. I have a terrible time with all my banana breads being doughy in the center and sinking in even though the edges and top are always starting to get too dark brown, but this one turned out perfectly and golden brown on top too. I did put an aluminum foil tent over it the last 15 minutes of baking. I used self rising flour, left out the salt and baking powder, and 3 bananas since it's what I needed to use up and they were small-med sized. I did mash them instead of slices. Left the nuts out. Excellent recipe!

I have made this recipe several times and love it I do not usually bake lol but love to cook, but this recipe is so easy and quick.  Add nuts or leave out, add chocolate chips or leave out mash bananas leaving some chunks. I don't melt the butter just cream it with the sugar the easiest way and quicker.  Good recipe to get the grandkids to help with they love to mix the dough!

I don't change recipes, but I did mash the bananas instead of slicing.

This was very good and moist banana bread.  I did substitute plain, low-fat yogurt for the sour cream (it was what I had) and added 1 tsp. of baking powder.  Very good and not too sweet.  Just right.

Best banana bread ever!  Came easily out of the pan.  Needed to mash the bananas, though.  I think the author of the original reciepe meant to say "mashed" instead of "sliced".  I added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg.

Amazing bread! So moist and flavorful. Only changes were mashing the bananas (preference only), subbed half of the white sugar for brown, and half the butter for applesauce. You won't go wrong with this bread!

I used brown sugar instead of white. Like suggested I spread butter on top before baking to keep it moist. Other reviewers said to mash the bananas, otherwise the bread would be mushy. So I only chopped 1/2 of one banana and it was amazing! I don't like my banana bread to have a lot of banana taste, so this recipe was perfect for me. If you do, add more bananas. I didn't have sour cream so I added a little more butter and mild, it was still really good!

Definitely delicious and worthy of 5 stars! My picky 6 year old loved this recipe so that makes it a keeper even more. My husband doesn't like fruity tastes and loved this recipe as well. My daughter even shared it with her Girl Scout friend at a cookie booth. Oh, and I didn't change a single thing about the recipe!

Very good.  I added a bit of cinnamon to this but this recipe is very good by itself.  The loaf lasted a whole 45 minutes in my small office.  Big hit and will definitely make again.

Best banana bread recipe I've tried yet! It's so moist, I don't even need to spread butter on it. :)

LOVE this recipe! Everyone asks me to make it all the time. I used a few suggestions from others:  add 1 tsp. lemon juice with the vanilla, and use 1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder, and 1-3/4 c. flour instead of 1 1/2 cups. I also added a dash of cinnamon and cloves! So yummy, the sour cream makes it so moist.

Finally, a great banana bread recipe!. Like others, I added more banana (3 large overripe bananas) and I also used vanilla yogurt since that is what I had. I roasted my walnuts first and added cinnamon and a touch of clove. I would add more cinnamon next time (1 1/2 tsp) and maybe 1/4 c more flour as I live at altitude, but other than than, awesome!

Needs another banana to kick up the banana taste. I smashed mine up. Very moist. Added walnuts for extra pop. Very good!

My family loved it! It was very simple to make. I mashed the bananas instead of leaving them chunked. The sour cream made it much more moist then banana breads in the past!

This was my first attempt with makeing Banana Bread and it turn out perfect.  I have always been nervous about making banana bread because it seems like people either make it really well or really bad!  I did substitute brown sugar since I was out of white, and I think dont think the taste could be better.

Yummy! I just took this out of the oven and it tastes delicious! I didn't buy any baking soda so I substituted with 2 tsp. of baking powder. Worked great because I like a denser banana bread! Also, I ran out of sugar so I only put about 3/4 cups of sugar, it was still pretty sweet! I added walnuts and some chocolate chips in my bread and it was soo nice! However, I don't think the banana flavor was quite enough for my taste (I mashed 2 large bananas or about 1 cup) and so the next time I make this, I will use 1 1/2 to 2 cups of mashed bananas. Loved it!

this bread turned out pretty goodt. it was super moist which is a plus for banana bread...don't want it to be dry...yuck. i would have added maybe like half a banana more to mine because it was lacking a bit in flavor. overall good recipe.

Very delicious.  To make a healthier version, I used 1/2 cup canola oil instead of butter.  Also, I used brown sugar instead of white.  For additional flavor, I used almond extract instead of vanilla extract.  YUM!

The banana bread came out great! Better than I thought it would. Like some of the other reviews written I blended the bananas instead of slicing them. Plus I used vanilla in a powder form compared to liquid. Will make it again soon! Thanks!

Soooo good!  Super moist and yummy.  I added a few extra walnuts to the top of the batter prior to baking and it added nice visual appeal.  I will be using this recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent bread.  Very moist and tender.  It almost melts in my mouth.  I did substitute half the white sugar with brown sugar and added a third banana.  I will definately use this recipe again!

Awesome!!  Very easy and delicious!  The large chunks of banana are key, I was careful to gently fold them in to keep them as large as possible.  My "Joy of Cooking" banana bread is a thing of the past, I have a new "go-to" banana bread!

I have made this several times now, and it's amazing! I wasn't too sure about the sour cream at first, but it makes the bread very moist. You can't taste it at all. I like to add walnuts AND chocolate chips. My husband loves it.

I recommend mashing the bananas. The first time I made it I sliced them like the recipe called for I wasn't a big fan of the chunks of banana throughout the bread but other than that it was good. Thank you.

Absolutely the best version of BB that we have tried.  Just added that extra 1/2 banana and a large spoonful of Hazlenut spread swirled through at the end and the kids were like vultures!! No need to look for any more recipes now - this is it!

This bread is incredible! I added a teaspoon of cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers. I also had to omit the nuts as my boyfriend isn't a fan but it turned out really moist and delicious. My breads have to be moist or I don't like them and this recipe was perfect!

This recipe is fantastic!!  I'd been using a different recipe and just wasn't happy with the results.  This turns out very moist and evenly cooked!!  I think the sour cream makes the difference!!   I did however mash my banana's up rather than slice them.

I made this banana bread last night.  It is a great recipe but next time I would mash the bananas.  Also, every oven is different.  The cook time states 60 min.  This took 45 minutes in my oven.  I would definitely keep an eye on it after 35 minutes or so.

Would give a higher score if I could.  I did have some miss steps but with this recipe it was an easy overcome.  I only had one small ripe banana, my quick fix was, I went looking through my son's yogurt for whatever banana flavoring he had.  Banana creme pie is what I ended up using.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  And for anyone who has a love of baking knows creaming sugar and fat is better than melted fat. Over all super, super moist.

I'm sad to say I wasn't particularly impressed with this recipe. I've been using the same recipe out of my Betty Crocker cookbook for years and have always really loved it but thought I'd try something new. This one seemed to have the best reviews and I thought the idea of adding sour cream was great.  The batter was yummy but once the bread was done I just didnt think it was very banana tasting and I had included even more bananas then called for. Plus, I thought it, although fully cooked was a little too gummy.  I'm going to stick with my tried and true Betty Crocker recipe as it's the best I've ever tasted however, I may try adding a little sour cream to it next time just for kicks. :)

I agree with oither reviewers - the recipe should read "room temp butter" or "softened" not melted.  I also have a variation that adds 1/4 cup of apple sauce and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, which adds more moistness and a twist on the flavor.

I mash bananas instead of slicing. Other than that I follow the recipe. And the result is very tasty. Already made it three times and will definitely make again in the future

Moist, delicious and easy to make.  I had to mash the bananas because they were overly ripe, but I intend to bake another loaf following the recipe exactly.

Perfect recipe!!!  My whole family loved this!  I've never been a big fan of banana bread but I can't stop eating this!  I did mash my bananas and made muffins instead of a large loaf.  Love it!!

Ok, I couldn't even wait for it to get out of the oven it smelled so good.  I didn't have enough sour cream, but had an extra banana so I used a 4th banana.  I also decided to use a fluted pan, so it's more of a cake, so I added raw sugar and walnuts on top.   YUMMY!

I don't even usually like banana bread and I love this!  I made muffins for breakfast or snacks on the go.  Baked at 350 for 22 minutes.  I used a med cookies scoop.  They came out like 18 mini muffins, which I like.  I also used Splenda instead of sugar.  Super easy, super yummy, your going to love it!

I "veganized" this recipe with non-dairy substitutes.  Oh MY GOODNESS!!  So rich, moist, and DELICIOUS!  I took this bread to a meeting - it was inhaled quickly.  I cannot make a loaf without sharing it - because I will greedily eat the whole thing.  V Jonsson - thank you for sharing this winner!!

Probably the best banana bread I've ever made. I didn't have sour cream, so I used vanilla yogurt instead. I also followed the advice of some other reviewers and added three bananas. Amazing. Will be making this on a regular basis!

I've made this recipe a few times now and it has come out perfect each time. I've even had people put in "orderd" for their own loaf. The only thing i do differently is mash the bananas in a seperate bowl first and then add to the recipe when called for. Love making this recipe because my whole house smells like a bakery!

This is THEEE best banana bread! I'm a novice baker and this was delicious & easy! I took the advice of using 1 cup bananas & added a pinch cinnamon! I make this on a regular basis! My husband loves it he keeps asking for it! I took a loaf to work & they couldn't believe I had never made banana bread before. Def a favorite! Nothing like it!

This recipe was AWSOME!!! I added half a tsp of Nutmeg and left out the walnuts. I loved the bananas sliced and just mixed in because every now and than you would bite a piece that had a little more banana and it was a deliciouse suprise.

I've followed the recipe exactly.  Very good moist bread! Sweetness is just right.  I will consider making it with butter substitute and also try yogurt next time though to make it healthier.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I tried this recipe it was very good. I did changed it a bit by using four ripe mashed bananas and added 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice to it. I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and bake for 1 hour then covered it with aluminum and bake it for another 15 minutes.

it was difficult for me to decide whether to make this recipe (ranked #2) or the #1 recipe (banana sour cream bread) but in the end i decided on this one (the other seemed to have such high rankings after lots of tweaking).  the only changes i made were to use room temp butter (not melted) and to mash the bananas rather than slice them.  the batter was delicious so i'm assuming that the bread will be, too!  i will update after they're done.  P.S.  i forgot to mention that i doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves. :)

THE BEST banana bread ever. I added cinnamon and nutmeg. Used 3 bananas instead of 2 and it was extra yummy. Also made it once with chocolate chips-- semi sweet. Yum. A favorite and so easy to make!

This banana bread is sooooo good. The only thing I did differently, was to mash my bananas instead of slicing them. Otherwise, followed the recipe as written. FYI: after I greased my Pyrex loaf dish, I dusted it with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar,then poured the batter in. It cooked perfectly in 60 min. Yummmmy

Wow ! I have never used sour cream in a banana bread before and was a little hesitant about how it would taste and I have always used oil . I made this banana bread following the receipe as is but added 1 teaspoon of baking powder . It was one of the best banana breads I have ever tasted and it is very moist not soggy and not heavy .It rose to the top of the pan and browned nicely and evenly . I did turn the oven off after 45 minutes and let sit in the oven for the remaining 15 minutes so as not to burn the top . My family loved this receipe and it is now a favorite that I will make often . The loaf only lasted a day ! Very easy and simple to make ... Thank -You for sharing your wonderful recepie !                di

I creamed the butter together with the sugar (use all brown) and then I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. Also added milk chocolate chips - awesome recipe!

A 9x5 pan, REALLY?  I followed this recipe completely as written.  I already suspected a problem when I put the batter in the loaf pan and it was filled just about to the top.  But hey, 5 stars and listed as a dense bread, so maybe it's ok?  Nope.  This is a lovely recipe but don't make the mistake of using a 9x5 pan.  I will definitely make this recipe again in a larger pan!

This is the best banana bread ever.  My family devours it!!  I took it to work and everyone wanted the recipe.  Now, this is the recipe they all use.  I only made a few minor changes, by creaming the butter with the sugar, instead of melting it.  I mashed the bananas to incorporate them more into my bread.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is a very good recipe.  I mashed the bananas like some suggested and I also put it in a muffin tin instead of a loaf pan.  It took about 15 min. for the muffins to cook in my oven.

Made muffins in a Pampered Chef baking stone muffin pan.   1/2 had walnuts mixed in and 1/2 did not.  Used Blue Bonnet margarine and mashed bananas, otherwise made as directed. Oh, did I mention that this was FABULOUS? The baking stone muffins had just a little bit of crunchiness to the outer crust from the caramelized sugar. Will make again for sure. Thanks!

Excellent when served with fresh whipped cream, light and moist banana bread muffins with some fresh whipped cream on the side!  I mashed (very ripe) bananas, chopped pecans instead of walnuts, used only 3/4 cup sugar, added 1/4 cup wheat germ and 1/4 cup wheat bran, and subtracted 1/2 cup flour (due to the added wheat germ and bran).  This makes 12 muffins (bake for 25 minutes).

This bread to me has a bit of a bitter taste. Also did not like the sliced bananas. I would rather have it mixed in with the bread more. Sorry have tasted much better banana nut bread would not make this again.

VERY good. Will definitely make it again because it was delicious but I will continue to experiment with other recipes as well. I added some mashed up thawed frozen strawberries because I did not have enough banana (one was mushy beyond repair) - was fine, but could not taste the berries (as expected - banana is very flavourful).   
Also added some roasted pumpkin seeds instead of nuts and it was GREAT :)
Subbed sour cream for thick yoghurt
PS - I suspect I could replace butter with oil, probably reduce amount to 1/3 c...

The flavor of this banana bread deserves 5 stars. However I wasn't a fan of the banana chunks in it. It didn't make for a consisitant texture and seemed mushey where the banana chunks were. Next time I make this recipe I'll mash the bananas.

This was the best banana bread I have ever had!  So moist, but next time I think I'll use a little bit less sour cream because I can't hold a piece without it falling apart (maybe because it's still warm?).  I think I could eat this entire loaf by myself.

I wish I could give this recipe 50 stars!  I was a little worried at how basic the recipe is...but made it exactly how it's written and it is THE BEST!  I love the chunks of banana in the bread!  This is my new go to recipe for banana bread!  Thanks;)

I agree that this is a really great recipe, producing a nice, not-to-sweet, and very moist banana bread.  My kids demand at least two loaves of this a week.  I follow the recipe as written, with the exception of mashing the bananas in with the sugar and butter rather than slicing them.

This is a really great base recipe for banana bread. I made a few alterations, and it was amazing. I upped the flour to 2 cups and used a mixture of 1/3 ground almonds, 1/3 whole wheat flour and 1/3 all purpose flour. I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cups, half baker's sugar, half brown sugar. I mashed the bananas, but left some chunks, and I omitted the nuts and added dark chocolate chips (that's what I had on hand), and I also added a little over 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger to it. Had to bake it for about 75 minutes, and it turned out great - it was gone in a day!

Wonderful banana bread. Made as-is is really foolproof. However after a few tries, I switched to vanilla yogurt (because I the rest will not go to waste), and in doing so i cut down the sugar. to 1/4 cup white and 1/3 cup brown, and use a tiny bit less of the vanilla. And I always do the 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, and 2 mashed bananas. I cut it up and pack them individually so it's easy to grab and go.

The BEST Banana bread I have ever made! I followed the recipe pretty much as it was written. I used 3 large banana's sliced them and added them to the mixer after the dry ingredients. It came out awesome and there are small chunks of bananas which are heavenly!

I made this after dinner one night on a whim, I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and 3 bananas instead of 2, because that was what I had, and it was THE BEST banana bread I have ever eaten, . I will never use another recipe. My family loves it too!

Unbelievably good right out if the oven!!  I followed the advice of other reviews and added 1 t. Lemon juice 1/2 cup sour cream and I added 1/2 cup chopped almonds (I am allergic to walnuts).  I also made sure the amount of mashed banana was equal to 1 cup.  My entire family absolutely loved this bread!  Thanks for the recipe.  A keeper for sure!!

This is absolutely delicious.  I doubled the recipe and made two large loaves.  I keep them in the freezer and slice them as needed.  I will definitely make this again.  I am going to add raisins or pecans the next time.

This is a very moist and delicious banana bread, even after making a few changes to make it healthier. I replaced half the butter with applesauce, used whole wheat flour in place of the all purpose and used reduced fat sour cream. My bananas were pretty small, so I used 3 instead of 2. Mine was done after exactly 60 minutes.

My boyfriend and I were walking through the store one day, and I happened to notice banana bread in the bakery. I didn't get any, but after seeing it, I began craving some. So I decided to look up some recipes to make my own, and this is one that I chose. It's very sturdy and moist, but my boyfriend described it as being a bit bland, and I have to agree. It's good, but we couldn't taste a whole lot of banana flavor. I really recommend adding at least one additional banana, and as others have suggested, mashing them for a better texture. Overall, a great started recipe. Just build on it!

So yummy!  I used 1/2 c of white sugar and 1/2 c of brown sugar, and put finely chopped walnuts on top of the bread instead of in the batter.  Thanks for a great recipe that the whole family loves!

This is a great recipe with minor changes. First, I used 3 large very ripe bananas. Instead of slicing them, I mashed them with a fork. I prefer mashing to slicing so that the bananas don't get that weird color and texture when you bake them. I also used 1/2 c of brown sugar and 1/2 c of white sugar, just because I love the taste of brown sugar. Other than that, this recipe is perfect for standard banana bread.

I have tried many banana bread recipes and this is by far the best! I added a handful of chocolate chips instead of the chopped walnuts as my kids do not like walnuts and it was a huge hit with everyone. It was easy to prepare, and very moist! This is already book marked and will be made many times again in my house!!

This tops the banana bread recipes I've made.  It is really moist and has a great flavor.  I made a few alterations: used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the butter, used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, added in 1 tsp. cinnamon, and baked at 325 for 52 minutes.  It turned out perfect!  I will definitely be throwing out my other banana bread recipe and replacing it with this one.

Wonderful! I tried this recipe because I didn't have any milk on hand which is what my usual banana bread recipe calls for.  This is very soft, moist, and with a great crust! The kids liked it as much as I did.

best banana bread I've ever had!!! I love the edges so much - I'm not normally a crust-loving-person, but it's so good, I'm going to try them as cupcakes next time, to get more edge!

This is delicious! How sad that I shook the pan a little too vigorously (without scraping around the edges first) to get the bread out, and the whole thing fell apart. I guess I'll just have to make this again!

This is a delicious banana bread! I've been searching for awhile for a good recipe for banana bread and am so glad I found it. This is a keeper! Thank you for submitting it. I did increase the bananas to 4 and it was perfect.

I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and rest regular all purpose.  Did not have sour cream so use what I had which was strawberry yogurt.  No nuts.  Came out great!!.  My five year old helped to make and she loved it alos.

Delicious and very moist!  I added mini chocolate chips (tossed in flour to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the bread) and ended up with a dessert for breakfast!

My husband is constantly purchasing bananas and then doesn't finish all of them.  I've had lots of bad banana bread in my time and had all but given up the recipe search, but decided to give it one more try because I hate wasting money by throwing food in the trash.  I was initially attracted to this recipe because it makes one loaf with minimal work (there's only three in my family) I couldn't of been happier.  It's a fantastically easy recipe that doesn't require dirtying the KitchenAid mixer.  It has a delicious buttery taste and doesn't dry out easily.  I followed the recipe but made one addition.  I sprinkled a little cinnamon into the batter.  Having made this three times in as many weeks I feel confident in saying I've found banana bread recipe that will stay with me for life.  Thank you Janet for sharing.

I loved this bread! I let the butter get to room temp, used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar and whole wheat flour. I put 3 over-ripe bananas in a ziploc bag and mashed them up. I didn't have any vanilla extract, so I added 1/4 tsp banana flavoring and 1 tsp Frangelico hazelnut liqueur (because I had it on hand). I substituted vanilla yogurt for the sour cream and added white chocolate chips. Yum! Next time I will try using 1 cup of dark brown sugar, and try baking it at 325 degrees instead of 350 because the edges burned a little before the middle was completely done, but that is most likely due to my oven. =(

This was fool proof banana bread. I substituted the nuts for semi-sweet chips. I think I am going to try it again with nuts and chips. Sounds good to me. I loved it and will make this for friends and family.

The most moist and delicious banana bread I've ever made.  Turns out great with greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  And i do mash the bananas, don't slice them.  Topped the loaf with cinnamon sugar before baking.  Always a hit!

I made this last night. Oh my goodness. It is absolutely delicious, probably the best banana bread I've ever tasted. I omitted the walnuts, and I didn't  have sour cream, so I substituted it with sour milk I made with vinegar and milk and it still turned out wonderfully (and incredibly moist!) I will most definitely be making this again!

This recipe is great simple and easy as most banana bread recipes are but it was super moist because of the sour cream.  However, i did make 2 changes, i mashed my bananas as some of the other reviews had recommended and i left out the walnuts, just not a fan. I also added a 1/8 tsp cinnamon and nutmeg with just a dash of ginger.  a medley of spices i enjoy in almost anything I'm baking.  I definitely will be making this again my boyfriend and roommate couldn't get enough.

This is a wonderful banana bread! I was a bit worried, having never made a bread with sour cream and only 2 bananas (usually I use 2 cups). I thought it wouldn't have the right amount of banana taste...but on the contrary. It is so moist I preferred it without butter and it has an amazing banana taste.  I did make one alteration. Instead of slicing the bananas, I mashed 1 cup (per another rater's suggestion).   This is a must-try recipe. I'll be making this again.

So yummy with just a few changes... mashed the bananas, used 3 bananas instead of 2, used softened butter instead of melted, and added a streudel crumb topping.  Best banana bread I've ever had!!

ummmm.....  Just ate a second piece.  My picky three year old gobbled it up.  I sliced the banana and it practically melted right into the batter, but I used very ripe bananas, throw-in-the-trash bananas.  This "bread" seems more like a desert or a very unhealthy breakfast ( like doughnuts).  I added a third banana and a bit more flour to make up for the consitency ratio. I'm usually not crazy about banana bread because it's kind of boring, but this makes you want to pour a glass of milk and indulge.  Thinkin' to invite the madre over for some...

So delicious, so moist. Great recipe. My new favourite. You can actually taste bananas in this recipe, unlike many. I always dissolve the baking soda in the sour cream.

This is a great recipe.I've actually been wanting to make strawberry banana bread so I went ahead and added about a cup of chopped strawberries to this and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.I left the nuts out just for personal preference and instead of sour cream I used plain yogurt.I  chopped the bananas into small pieces instead of slicing them.I made mine in 3 mini loaf pans which I greased and floured first.I thought this was really delicious bread and it turned out so moist.I really loved the strawberries with the banana for something different.

Absolutely delicious, the best banana bread I have ever eaten.  The problem is, I can't stop eating it!  I made it with my Kitchenaid mixer and so the bananas ended up in small chunks even though I sliced them, but it turned out perfect to me this way.

I used bread flour instead of all-purpose. It turned out wonderful! I also double the batch for 2 loaves and used 3 large over-ripe bananas, mashed. I added chocolate chips to one and walnuts to the other. I sent some with my friend leaving for a long roadtrip. Perfect recipe!

this is good banana bread, but not the best I have tasted. The recipe is easy to make and it's a bonus that it calls for melted butter rather than softened if, like me, you forgot to take the butter out of the fridge. Thanks!

This banana bread is absolutely delicious! I cannot wait to make it again! I am firm believer that you always try a recipe at least once before you start adding/changing things; however, upon reading other people's reviews regarding the sliced bananas, I decided to chop them up nice and small instead of slicing them! I almost like them chopped up more than mashed! I think I found my new banana bread recipe!

Very good banana bread.  I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and it was still plenty sweet for me.  I made it into overflowing mini muffins, and it was done in only 15 minutes.  Perfect portion sizes without slicing!  Also, I substituted yogurt for the sour cream, applesauce for 1/2 the butter and pecans for the walnuts - just personal preferences.  Thanks!

This is a very good recipe. I substituted 1 cup white sugar with 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar. That made it even richer! I also used about 3/4 cup sour cream and that made it extra moist and delicious!

I made this recipe and took it in to work. EVERYONE loved it! I followed only one suggestion by others on here. DONT melt the butter. Cream it with the sugar using electric beaters (I used my kitchenaid mixer). I have to make this recipe again this week because the other dept heard about my banana bread and complained I didnt make any for them!

Delicious!!! This bread is very moist.  I used two large bananas and just mixed in with everything else.  I left the nuts out this time but will add them next time. I did add a little cinnamon. Im not really sure that it made any difference.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever used. It is classic moist, slightly dense, slightly sweet, easy and delicious!I did mash the bananas as I like it that way. Excellent, I highly recommend this recipe

We used whole wheat flour and an extra banana.  Mashing bananas almost to a paste consistency is definitely recommended.  Rich and practically healthy for you!

I'm not sure I get what the hype is about this one.  I will definitely be going back to my old recipe.   Like others my bread also came out burnt on the sides and bottom.  It is also much sweeter than I prefer, if I were to try it again, I think I would cut back the sugar and maybe do 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar.   But I will stick with my other one for now.

Absolutely delicious!  I brought this to a sit-and-knit and it was a huge hit!  It was the first thing gone.  There were about 7 kids there, ages 2-9, and they could barely stop eating it long enough to telling me how good it was.  The mother's were raving, too!  This was my first time making banana bread and this recipe was so simple.  I did take the advice of several reviewers and used three mashed bananas and added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Made the recipe exactly as written.  Loved the moist consistency.  I like the idea of other reviewers to add a bit of cinnamon and to dust the pan with the cinnamon and sugar prior to baking.

BEST!  I have a great banana bread recipe I've been using for years.  This one beats it hands down.  What I like best about it is the crispness of the crust.  The only things I changed were to mash the banana (used 1 cup) rather than slice it and I used 1/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of butter (melted) to help keep down the calories and fat content.  I thought I might want to add less sugar next time I make it but after tasting it 1 cup of sugar is perfect - at least for my taste.

I sort of have 2 reviews for this bread.  The first time I baked it I stuck to the recipe only mashing my bananas instead of slicing because I don't like larger sections of mushy banana in my bread.  It came out excellent, didn't even last a few hours at our house!  I modified it to fit my sons dietary needs (he is on a gluten and casien free diet.)  I straight substitued applesauce for the butter, gluten free flour mix for all purpose flour (adding 3/4 tsp xantham gum) and used Tofutti better than sour cream substitute for the sour cream.  I had to bake it an extra 10 minutes but it turned out wonderfully!  My other two kids didn't even realize it was gfcf.  It turned out moist and tasty and not gritty as some baked goods do.  Wonderful recipe modified or not!

Mashed the bananas and mixed them with the sour cream. Added some cinnamon. We made mini loaves to give away as gifts for Christmas. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes and they were perfect. UPDATE: Made them with oil instead of butter, and 1/2 teaspoon maple extract in addition to the vanilla. Delicious both ways.

I loved this bread! The moistness of it was really delicious. Mashing the bananas is really the way to go because you get all the banana flavor without the bruised chunks that some people are experiencing when slicing the bananas. I didn't chop my walnuts as small as I should have, but the rest of the family had no problems with it. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to give it more of a "grandma is baking in the fall" kind of taste. It had just the right amount of sweetness. Love it, love it, love it!

I substituted 2% greek yogurt for the sour cream and I added 1/2 c. mini chocolate chips.  I also used 3 bananas and mashed them, along w/ adding 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and nutmeg.  It cooked for 60 mins and it was DELICIOUS!!!

2nd time....
also added 1/8 tsp. cloves and used sour cream instead of the yogurt

I've tried so many banana bread recipes on this site, and by far, this is the best.  This is so unbelievably good - I'm just amazed!  Made few modifications 1/2 c splenda + 1/2 c sugar, 1/8 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 tsp cinn.  Excellent, excellent recipe.  Thank you!

This recipe is fantastic!  I creamed the butter/sugar/egg/vanilla then sliced the bananas into this, followed by the sour cream.  I sliced them fairly thin, I did not want large chunks in the bread.  The result was perfect, nice small pieces of banana throughout.  Also faster to just cream all the wet together in the beginning.  I also topped it with a crumb topping.  Absolutely delicious, this is my new favorite banana bread recipe.

This banana bread is perfect.  It is what banana bread should be like.  I have tried many banana bread recipes, and I think this one is my new favorite.  I did follow another's suggestion and beat the butter, sugar, egg mixture with a beater until it was fluffy before folding the flour mixture in.  Also, I did mash my bananas instead of chopping them and I used 3 instead of 2.  I also left the walnuts out, since we like ours without.

I made a few changes.  I used 3/4 butter softened not melted. 1/2 a cup of sugar instead of 1 cup, I do not like how over sweet so many american deserts are. 1/2 cup of the flour i used whole wheat. I didn't have enough sour cream so I used 1/4 cup greek yogurt. And no nuts. ..It is AMAZING. My boyfriend never knew that I used non fat greek yogurt or whole wheat, or half the sugar. SO GOOD! i cant imagin using 1 cup of sugar, yuck. that would be a banana cake not bread.

With the sour cream (or plain yogurt in a pinch) this bakes up evenly (center is done w/o the edges being over done) and is delicious. This is our favorite banana bread recipe! I do mash the bananas instead of slicing; mainly because I am often using overly ripe bananas from out of the freezer but Ido think it distributes the bananas throughout too.

Great banana bread, very versatile.  It tastes great plain or you can spice it up a bit with some cinnamon & nutmeg.  It's also great with nuts, dried cranberries and chocolate chips.

I make this all the time- I love it, and everyone else does too!  I use 1/2 a cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white, but that's just my personal taste preference.  And I mash the bananas.  Really, if you're looking for a banana bread recipe, this is it!

I FORGOT the sour cream!!!  Didn't realize it until it was baking and I couldn't believe it.  Know what?  That bread was AWESOME.  I saved a million calories and it was STILL awesome.  Some added additional cinnamon and nutmeg, but I'm a banana bread purist and I really don't like anything messing with the banana flavor, so only add it if that's important to you.  I did mash the bananas and made it to one cup  - used soft butter (melt?  what's THAT about?) and the flour mix was added last only because it's habit with me.  We loved this recipe!

Very good.  I rated four stars only because it needed some additions.  With the changes, it is perfect.  I made the same changes as many other reviewers (added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 50% baking soda/50% baking powder, 50% white sugar/50% brown sugar, mashed the bananas).  I also covered with foil for the last 20 min of baking.

This recipe was AWESOME, with a few minor changes.  Instead of using melted butter, I creamed softened butter with the sugar.  I used mashed bananas instead of sliced.  I also added about one tsp of cinnamon for a little extra flavor.  Will make this recipe over and over!

Instead of bananas I added half a cup of pumpkin puree along with a pinch of nutmeg, ginger, and a 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Came out delicious!

With some minor variations this is an amazing banana bread recipe.  Instead of chopping the bananas, I mash them to a pulp. And I use 3.   I also add equal quantities of baking soda and baking powder.  And I use 1 tablespoon vanilla instead of 1 teaspoon.  Since discovering this recipe a couple of months ago I've made it about half a dozen times, and each time it is wonderful. The only real variable is the bananas!

This bread has good taste and is very easy to make...but I think you need to use 2 - pans...mine overflowed and the top was burnt before I could get the inside to be cooked.  I think if you split into two pans the problem will be solved

I've used a dozen banana bread recipes, but no more. This is IT.  There are probably recipes out there with less fat, calories, sugar...but I'll take this one over them all.  I, too, mashed the bananas. This is worth baking loaves to eat now and some to freeze for later.

OMG! This is the BEST banana bread recipe. I've been searching for the last 15 years, tried many recipies and finally have found a recipe that I will make forever. This one is actually the best. I mashed the bananas instead of chopping them, but other than that I followed it to the letter. Can't be beat. End of story.

This is darn fine banana bread. I did mash the bananas and made sure I had a cup's worth, but I followed the recipe to the letter other than that - YUM! I will probably add about 1/4 cup more flour next time because I like a little more cake-like feel. But..the flavor is awesome as is. My husband wanted some, but he is doing the P-90X plan and I made him a loaf using whole wheat flour  (same amount, sifted), Splenda for baking, Egg Beaters, and I Can't Believe It's not Butter sticks. Tasted almost the same and same moisture, but oodles less fat and calories. Either way, this is awesome. Keeping this one!!

Very good banana bread- the only tweak I made was that like a lot of other reviewers, I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them- I personally don't like chunks of fruit in my bread. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was great!

This recipe is simple and it makes the best loaf of Bread I have ever had. Of coures I made a few slight changes: I mashed the bananas, added 2tsp Cinnamon, 1/2tsp nutmeg, and 1/2tsp ginger I like my banana bread with some spice in it and it turned out golden brown and just as moist as any other I ever had. Thanks for the great recipe!

When i first found this recipe months and months ago, i knew it was going to be moist because of the sour cream but this hits a new level! Stays moist all week and tastes amazing. I wait till the bananas i use are withered and black because it gives the bread a rich beautiful banana flavor without having to use like 8 bananas. I now make this bread weekly and its an absolute favorite of my dads. Thank you!

Every time I make this, people (including my husband and I) who have never liked banana bread start to go crazy because they can't get enough of this! This is the most delish breakfast bread, dessert, snack ever! I like to slice three bananas into the batter, omit the nuts, and generously sprinkle cinnamon and brown sugar on top before I put it into the oven. Amazing!

I made this for church on Sunday and it disappeared SO fast. I liked the sliced bananas and the walnuts in it. The sliced bananas are nice b/c the bananas don't have to be as overripe as with some mashed banana bread recipes. Great for baking for impatient kids!

I have just made this recipe for the first time and am eating my finished product now!  It is yummy!!!  I halved the recipe because I only had one banana.  I also used half whole wheat flour/half all purpose, and added about 3/4 tsp cinnamon and a sprinkle of nutmeg. I mashed the banana and used the mixer for everything. It is really delicious!  I baked it in a 9 x 5 at 325 for 30 minutes and it was perfect (although a short loaf) :).  Thanks for the recipe!!!!  btw:  In the middle of the pan, the bottom of the loaf stayed in the pan when I inverted to cool it :(. So it's not pretty. Can anyone tell me how to prevent that?

I love this recipe!  This is my new favorite and I make banana bread much more often now because of how GOOD this is.  When I made it spur of the moment last time I didn't have sour cream, so I used a container of low fat vanilla yogurt instead and it tasted great!

Excellent Recipe! I did a little tweaking like everyone else: did not melt the butter, just softened it.I dont know if that really makes a difference but some one else suggested it. Used half brown half white sugar. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2tsp nutmeg. Slightly mashed 4 bananas instead of 2, but left alot of chunks (I love banana flavor). Only used half as many nuts bcz thats all I had. Delicious! This is my new banana recipe

This is my 5th time coming back to this recipe; it's definitely a keeper! Hearty, moist banana bread with great flavor. The only alteration I made to the recipe, upon reading reviews, was I mashed the bananas rather than slicing.

This was my first experience w/ making banana bread.  It was "ok" but not as heavy/dense as I'm used to & didn't have as strong of a banana taste.  I'll keep looking but if all else failed I would use this one.

This was great. I added some cinnamon (about a tsp). I loved the way the banana's were chunky pieces in the bread. I've only ever mashed these before. Very nice change!

Very easy, very moist. I made muffins and baked for 15min. My daughter said I need to make these all of the time and she wants them for her birthday! My kids usually don't like banana nut bread.

This recipe was awesome. I am not a very experienced baker, and I used cream cheese instead of sour cream!, and it tasted wonderful, almost like cheesecake!  Everyone in my family loved it, including my sister who dosen't like bananas.

Good flavor, but a bit light and cakey. I prefer banana bread to be a little more dense and moist.

This is the BEST banana bread I have ever made (and I've been looking for a good recipe for years!).  This will be my recipe from now on.  I adjusted a few things to suit my family's taste.  I used 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup unsweetend applesauce, 1/2 tsp. baking soda, 1/2 tsp. baking powder, added 1/4 cup more flour, a dash of cinnamon, and 1 cup mashed bananas.  Result was a fluffy and moist banana bread!

Very yummy.  Added some spice like nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and a little ginger....just eyeballed it.  Added extra walnuts and sprinkled a cinnamon/white sugar/brown sugar combination on top before baking for a little bit of a sweet crunchy crust.

Moist and delicious!!  Based on other reviewer's suggestions, I made the following changes:  used room temperature butter, which I hand-mixed w/the sugars.  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar.  I added 3/4 teaspoon to the flour mixture, as well as a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I used mashed bananas (3) rather than chopped bananas.  I didn't have a loaf pan, so I ended up using 2 muffin tins.  Baked @ 350 degrees, for 20 mins.

I've made this recipe for 2 years now and it is the BEST banana bread ever!!! Super moist and not overly sweet. The only thing I do differently is I mash the bananas and not slice them. Enjoy....we certainly have.

I've made this recipe "as is" many times and love it.  However, I've been trying to eat healthier lately and have been juicing.  Today, instead of the bananas I added the pulp from my morning juice (apple, pear, cucumber and carrot).  Also, instead of the sour cream I used 1/2 c. of fat free plain yogurt.  The bread turned out fabulous!!

OMG!  So good!  I was looking for a recipe that was the same as a banana bread I had in Maui on the road to Hana, and this was it.  I did change a few things though.  I used 4 bananas and I did mash them.  I also made with brown sugar, to make it a little more rich.  WOW!  Try it this way and you will never use another recipe....... ever!  To switch it up, also try adding a cup of chocolate chips.  We made a few loafs this way too, and my son and hubby loved it.

Have used many variations to this. I added crushed pineapple. Loved it. Added golden raisins. Loved it. Added zucchini, pineapple, and golden raisins. Waiting for those to come out of the oven. Kids love them, I love them, and I am passing along 3 dozen for friends and family.

This was a delicious banana bread!  I mashed the bananas because we have young kids who wouldn't have liked the sliced bananas in the bread.  I found it browned very quickly about half-way through cooking time so I had to put aluminum foil on it so it wouldn't brown anymore.  I have made it twice and the second time I made sure to take it out of the pan after 10 minutes like the recipe says.  the first time I made it it was a little too brown on the edges.

Delicious.  I bake this bread at least once a week and it is so easy to make.  I do mash the bananas instead of slicing them and I use pecans instead of the walnuts. My daughters are always wanting me to make them a loaf but most of the time my little 87 year old Dad gets it.  Again, this recipe is perfect.

The only things I changed were using plain yogurt instead of sour cream (due to lack of availability in Egypt) and I mash up the bananas. I've made this many times and it's a hit!

I thought this bread was moist, but that it missed something.  It could use some dressing up with some cinnamon/nutmeg.  If I make this again, I would definitely mash the bananas...purple banana chunks are not visually appealing!  I just thought this was a 3 star recipe, but folks at a recent gathering raved, so I'll give it a 4.

To. die. for.  So moist. I only used 1/4 cup margerine, but added a little heavy cream just because I had some lying around. Also only used 2/3 cup sugar. Me and my husband ate the whole loaf in an hour. I think I am going to make it again tonight!

This was my first time making banana bread simply because I am tired of throwing away the "too ripe" bananas that end up sitting on the counter until I give in and toss them. Let me tell you..trash no more! I have a new found obsession with banana bread! This was so easy to make..and soooo good to eat! Thanks so much for this recipe!

For me, this bread was just OK.  The banana bread that I grew up with is much denser, this bread is really fluffy.  The fluffiness made it a bit difficult to cut, even after completely cooling.  I think I'll stick to Mom's recipe.  Thanks though!
*****EDIT:  a few years later and after trying lots of other recipes I came back to this one and I now LOVE it.  I usually cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup and use light sour cream but other than that it's great.  Let it cool completely (overnight if you have time) and I think the flavor and texture really develops. *******

Awesome bread, I used applesauce instead of butter, eggbeaters, reduced fat sour cream, and I mashed the bananas.  I received many compliments!

This bread is excellent if you mash the bananas.  I never tried it slicing them so not sure how that would turn out.  I've made SEVERAL loafs using this recipe and they turn out perfect every time. I bake it at 325 so the crust isn't as crisp and add a little cinnamon.

I added a coat of cinnamon/sugar mixture over the pan greasing, to give the crust an extra yum-yum. I also added a crumble to the top, with 1/3-cup brown sugar, 1-TBS flour, 1/8-tsp Cinnamon, cut with 1-TBS butter. I think I'll mash my bananas next time, as others suggested.

I make the Banana Oat Muffin recipe from this website about once a month and decided to try this one.  It was a very nice alternative - very cake-like and sweet.  I made them into muffins and they were a popular snack and breakfast item for my holiday crew.

This is a keeper. The best banana bread I have ever made. Moist, full of flavor, simply a banana bread to perfection. Was not sure of the bananas sliced, but thought I follow the instructions anyway. It turned out perfect, there is more banana flavor this way..Thank you for sharing this treasure.
Happy Holidays.

This is the best banana bread recipe, with a couple alterations.  3 bananas mashed, and 1/2-3/4 cup sugar (1 cup is too much).  This bread doesn't last longer than 1-2 days in my house!

I baked these in three mini loaf pans.  I mashed the bananas just because I don't like the look of chunky cooked bananas.  They didn't need to cook an entire hour.  The bread was moist and good.  I will continue to make this recipe.

Very, very, very good!!
This will become our favourite banana bread recipe. 
I did add mashed bananas instead of sliced, as the thought of biting into a mushy banana didn't appeal to me. 
Nice banana flavour!!

This recipe is fail-proof. I've made it twice within three days and it is gone in no time. I made a couple of changes. First, DEFINITELY mash the Bananas. Second, we live in Germany and have yet to find anywhere to get Vanilla Extract so I used vanilla sugar (at a 1/2 teaspoon = 3/4 Tablesoon ratio). Then I had a lack of sour cream and so I added just under 3 Tablespoons of milk to adjust the consistency to where I wanted and I also nixed the nuts (I've never been a fan of them in Banana Bread). I baked it for one hour and it turned out perfectly. It was very moist without being mushy. This would be a great recipe to add chocolate chips to!

My banana bread has always come out very dry. I decided to give this recipe a try and it came out fantastic. I added one more banana just because I had three that needed to be used and I substituted craisins for the nuts. It came out so moist and delicious.

Great loaf with only one suggestion. The banana's needs to be mashed. My 6 year old who loves banana bread did not appreciate the gooey chuncks that are left in the loaf when you slice the banana's. I tried the same recipe the next day but mashed them instead and wow great flavour and really moist. I look forward to making anouther loaf.

OMG this is the best banana bread i have ever had! It was so moist and flavorful, the banana taste just explodes in your mouth with the first bite... i did mash up my bananas as others suggested, rather than slicing them, and it only took about 45-50 minutes in the oven instead of the hour the recipe called for, thank goodness I checked it early because it was slightly darker than I would have liked. Other than those changes, this was an absolutely heavenly recipe, will definitely be making many times more!

This recipe has received so many rave reviews because it produces a wonderful loaf of banana bread. I made the recipe exactly as written and used a generously sized loaf pan. No need to change a thing. Easy to make, great texture and flavor. You will love it.

This was delicious and extremely moist. It was a bit greasy due to all the butter but I guess that's a necessary evil for the moistness.

This recipe produced a very moist bread, as indicated by previous reviews. However it was a little "greasy" for my taste. Next time I will cut back on the butter some and maybe try to substitute applesauce in place of the sour cream to maintain the pleasant, moist consistency. Great flavor though!

The flavor was good and the inside of the bread was moist, but the edges of it cooked a lot faster than the rest of it and so they came out a little dark.

I've been making this bread for quite a while and its awesome!  I mash the bananas because you get more of the banana flavor plus the sliced bananas don't look very attractive.  I've also added milk chocolate chips which was very good.  This time I add cinnamon and I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top...its in the oven right now.  I hardly ever throw away over ripe bananas now.

This was good. I did make some changes. I used light margarine instead of butter (I didn't melt it first, just mixed it in straight from the refrigerator), half white sugar and half brown sugar, only 1/4 tsp of salt, fat free sour cream, raisins instead of walnuts, and added a tablespoon of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, a 1/2 cup of coconut, and an extra banana (I mashed all the bananas). It has a good flavor, and is nice and moist. Next time I'd like to try fat free vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream, though, as I think we'd like the flavor better. I also couldn't find this size of pan, and could only find an 8 by almost 5 pan. So, I did two of those, which meant I didn't have the nice loaf I would have had if I could have found the right size. Next time I'll make them into muffins so I don't have that problem. I would love to know what this tastes like using splenda and brown sugar baking splenda for a low sugar version. If I try it, I'll edit my review. Otherwise, nice recipe, and I'll use it again.

This was the best banana bread that I have ever tasted. The sour cream added a  good balance and kept it from being too sweet while keeping it moist.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe!! Easy to make and so moist and flavorful. I used three mashed bananas instead of two sliced. I did adjust the cooking time to fit my oven - baked for 75 minutes at 300. It came out perfectly. Here's a tip for making this really over-the-top: after pouring the batter into the loaf pan but before baking, sprinkle the top with a crumb mixture made from 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 tbsp. flour, 1 tbsp soft butter, and a dash of cinnamon. This is going to be my staple banana bread recipe from now on!

This was very moist and just the right sweetness.  I used pecans instead of walnuts; personal preference.  Love this bread. Will make again.

This recipe worked out great and it was gone in a day!. According to other recommendations, I baked at 325 instead for an hour and 15 minutes and it turned out fully baked and moist. I substituted the melted butter for half melted margarine and half cinnamon apple sauce. I also added cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg and also mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. We thought that there wasn't a strong enough banana flavor, so maybe consider adding more banana to your recipe? Great recipe, thanks for the submission!

This bread turned out really tasty and rich!  I used Canola Oil instead of the melted butter to make it a little healthier, and it was still great.

This is the best banana bread I've made and I've tried a BUNCH of different recipes.  In the past my banana bread has always seemed to come out very dense.  This was light and airy and wonderful.  I just put the ingredients in order in my kitchenaid...including the bananas so they actually get mushed up.

This was my first time making banana bread.  It was very good.  Although it was very dark in color, may have overcooked it.  It was probably the pan I used.  The bread was very moist.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best banana bread that I have ever made.  I've made it twice now.  The first time, I used 3 bananas, the second time, I used 4 bananas.  Both times the bread turned out great.  I mashed the bananas instead of slicing and added one tsp of baking powder.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Will make again and again.  Very moist!

This is probably the prettiest banana bread I have ever made. It rose beautifully and the color was great! The taste was fantastic. I used 3 bananas instead of 2. I have never used sour cream in a banana bread recipe before, but I think this is my new favorite. My family loved it and it was very moist. Will most definately make again. Thanks!

This bread tasted really good. I liked it. I gave it only 4 though, because it tasted a little better with some tweaking of adding the brown sugar. With the brown sugar is was a 5 star recipe! very scrumptious :)

I followed the recipe to a "T" but it wasn't sweet enough for me.  It's more an opinion than anything... but I gave a 4 instead of 5 because of the banana pieces.  Through out the bread there was pieces of dark gooey banana that made me loose the desire to have more.  Looks beautiful and house smells great!!!

Mine came out perfect!  I followed the advice of others and used 1/2 brown sugar in the recipe.  I also sprinkled a little brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the loaves (I did mini loaves instead of a big one) and they only took 35 minutes in the oven.  This is my new favorite!!!

Nice consistency for baking.  Browned nicely and evenly.  I subsituted shredded coconut and mini chips for the walnuts, but wished I would have added twice as much.

I lost my grandmother's recipe for banana nut bread, and this one seemed very similar so I tried it. WOW! I doubled the recipe to make two loaves and I'm glad that I did. I did replace half of the white sugar with brown sugar, added an extra banana (which I mashed) and doubled the nuts. Excellent recipe, definitely a keeper!

This is a great banana bread recipe. Nice and moist, but still fluffy.  I actually made mini-muffins instead of a loaf (made 48, cooked for 15 minutes).  I did add some spices (cinn., nutmeg, allspice, cloves) and sprinkled some brown sugar on top.  Left out the walnuts due to families nut allergies.  My two yr. old can't stop eating them!  Will use this recipe again.

I just finished baking this and I chose this recipe because of it's simplicity since this was my first attempt to bake banana bread.  After reading reviews, I chose to use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and also mashed the bananas since I didn't think the kids would like a "chunky" banana bread.  At 1 hr the middle was not done.  At 1 hr and 20 minutes the bottom crust was getting burned but the inside bottom was not done.  I finally took it out, cut off the bottom, and served what was baked through and it was delicious.  I will try again and try to figure out how I can get it to come out evenly cooked.

I am full from dinner yet I'm on my second slice! This is excellent. Like some of the other reviewers, I added about a small handful of brown sugar and sprinkled some cinnamon over the top. It smelled great while baking and gave the crunchy top a nice flavor. I will most definitely make this again.

Got tons of compliments on this very moist, delicious cake.  Made it just as it is, just instead of slicing the bananas, I mashed 1 and then sliced the 2nd.   I baked it in a round pan and called it a "cake"!  Delicious.

This is a really great Banana Bread recipe...perfect texture...not too sweet...chunks of bananas are a nice touch.    Very moist on the inside and a bit crunchy on the outside.  Perfect...thank you!

Turned out so awesome! My boyfriend, who "doesn't like" banana bread ate 3 or 4 pieces immediately. 
I used non fat yogurt instead of sour cream, three bananas instead of two, and added dried cranberries as well as the walnuts. It's a gorgeous, moist, and a little different. I can't wait to have more ripe bananas!

I thought this was wonderful - very moist! I used light banana cream pie yogurt in place of the sour cream, a third banana chunked up, and added a little cinnamon.  Definately will make again.

I read the other ratings and decided to put the cake into two smaller pans hoping it will bake faster but it didnt really bake that well, I dont know if it was my oven or what but the inside wasnt even close to being ready when the outside was already burned. I made this for the Russian Christmas and everyone  loved it despite the fact that it looked burned !!! " O My gosh its so moist !!!" 

  Very delicious !!!!

Great recipe. Moist. Left out nuts and mashed 3 bananas, not sliced. I had to bake it about 15 minutes longer to be done. Crust was starting to burn in a heavy glass pan. Next time I will try reducing heat and baking longer.

Great recipe.  I added dried cranberries and walnuts.  Loved the idea of slicing the banana so that there are moist chunks in the bread.  Made one for home and one for the office.  Raves all around!

I made this bread yesterday and I LOVE it. It's the moistest banana bread I've ever had! My husband loved it too. The bad part is that I'm home all day with the kids and I can't stop eating it!! I didn't add walnuts because my husband hates nuts in his bread, I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar just like others advised. I'm sure I'll be making this again!

I just took this out of the oven 1/2 hour ago. This tastes great and has a nice texture with little bits of banana. I left out the walnuts at the request of my kids. It came out fine without the walnuts. I would rate this 5 stars plus some!

This is the recipe I use the most!

I make this recipe all the time whenever I have ripe bananas.  My coworkers love this bread/cake.  Mine turns out more like a moist cake.  I follow the recipe with these changes: I make it in a 9*13 pan, add 1/2 cup of brown sugar, add some chocolate chips, and a splash of milk....

It is super yum and super easy.  It really does stay moist for days. Love it!

Awesome.  The bread was very moist and flavorful.  I added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients before mixing into the wet.  The smell was so good, I couldn't wait to let it cool down, I ate it when it came out of the oven.  I will make this again.  Thanks.

This recipe was good. It was very moist and stayed moist for several days. I followed the recipe except using Splenda instead of sugar. Also, I mashed up two bananas and sliced one banana. I must add that the sliced banana does make the bread more difficult to cut and hold together, but adds a good flavor.

This recipe makes an excellent loaf of banana bread.  I have tried many recipes and this one is definately in my top 5.  The bread was very moist and so easy to make.  I loved the sliced bananas.  I also loved knowing the recipe was going to fit perfectly in one pan.  The only problem I have is I think there should be some cinammon or something.  It was flavorful and delicious; just lacking a little something else.

I make 12 muffins from this recipe.  They are so moist!  I mash the bananas and leave out the nuts.  I bake them for 25 minutes, and they are fabulous!

This is an incredible banana bread recipe.  I ended up with 4 small loafs.  I did bake an extra 10 minutes, because it was a little to moist in the middle for me.  Thank you for an incredible recipe.

Reduced sugar to 3/4, added chocolate chips and this came out great.  Only problem was the center did not cook all the way but I actually don't mind that at all.

Wonderfully delicious! Mashed two bananas, used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar.  Added 1/2 tsp of cinnamin, dash of nutmeg, and chocolate chips!  Very moist.  Will definetly make again, however will decrease the cooking time by 10 minutes or so.

This is a great recipe. I made it into muffins (batter made 15 muffins) and baked them for 24 min as others suggested. I also mashed the bananas (used 3, instead of 2) and added 1 t of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. The muffins are flavorful and light and fluffy--that surprised me most. When I think of banana bread, I think of dense, moist and heavy. If that's what you are looking for, this is not the recipe for you. If you want your muffins/bread delicious and fluffy, make this recipe.

This recipe makes a wonderful loaf. It is very moist and delicious. After cooling in the pan for 10 minutes and another 10 on a cooling rack I found it to be very soft. I think if you allowed it to cool longer it will set up enough for a clean cut. Love this recipe, thanks for sharing!

this is by far the best banana bread ever. i freeze my bananas when they become too ripe to eat, and bake when i'm ready, so i make a lot. everyone who has ever tried this has loved it. i add a little cinnamon and i coat the pan and top the bread w/ cinnamon surgar. i also mash my bananas:)

Absolutely THE BEST --and I've made alot of different kinds of banana bread, I like to use 2 bananas completely mashed in the batter and then add 1-2 only slightly broken up bananas added with the nuts.

Excellent recipe! Very moist. I added 3 mashed bananas like most people and I crushed the chopped walnuts even further because I dont like crunchy nuts in banana bread.  Came out great.  Will definetly make again.

Wow! Best banana bread recipe. Gone in a day. Only thing I did differently was to add an extra banana (since I happened to have one on hand) and substitute the sour cream for cottage cheese (which I blended and added a bit milk to thin it out). Worked great. Only thing is that with the extra banana maybe it was a bit sweet for a bread (though the kids thought it was just right!) and would decrease the sugar next time.

I just made this for breakfast today, and it is simply moist, lovely and delicious.

Everyone in the family loves it. I used 3 bananaas and coarsely mashed them. I also added finely chopped pecans, instead of walnuts. After an hour, the middle did not come out done, so I covered the top w/ foil at this point to avoid further browning on top, and put it back in for another ten minutes. Perfect!

Great with butter. Thanks for submitting.

VERY easy to make and SUPER moist!  I added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and cinnamon and also used 3 mashed bananas instead of chopped bananas. I added some chocolate chips as well.  It turned out so delicious and moist.  It's even good cold!  Everyone asks for seconds and the recipe!

SO easy :)  I used vegan margarine and vegan blueberry "yogurt" instead of the sour cream (didn't have any substitute at the time) and it turned out great.  I also added about a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the dry mix.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I bake banana bread often and I finally found a recipe that uses the exact same ingredients that I've been using for my banana bread. I have to give it a 5 star rating!! So yummy. I bake for usually 65-70 minutes and I usually use 3 or 4 mashed bananas.

This was one the best banana breads EVER! It stayed very moist and everyone loved it. The loaf did not last long. 
The only changes I made was using 1/2 spelt flour and margarine instead of butter. Super delicious!

This is a really great banana bread recipe!!  Next time I'll probably try blending in my mashed bananas instead of folding in sliced bananas.  This is just my preference.

Very moist and easy to make.  I used three bananas, mashing two and slicing one into l/2 slices. I omitted the nuts, but next time will be adding them since I feel they would add to the overall flavor of the bread.  I prefer a recipe with more banana flavor, but it is still a very good recipe. It is a nice alternative for when you only have two or three ripe banana's on hand. Recipe makes 3 mini size loafs, remember to decrease baking time if opting for the smaller pans.  Best served warm.

this is great but not for the diet.  I had 5 smaller really brown bananas so I doubled the recipe.  They had a wonderful banana flavor.  I chopped them up instead of slicing.(wasn't sure anyone would want a big chunk of overripe banana)and the bits of banana were great!  I won't mash my bananas from now on.  I thought I had sour cream but had picked up ricotta instead so I used 2 single serving containers of fat free yogurt.  I was weary that it would not turn out but it sure did!  The double batch made 1 8x5 loaf, 1 mini loaf tin, and 6 texas size muffins.  I filled the muffin cups up with heaping half cup each. Muffins baked for 30 minutes. The flavor is wonderful.  Except for the fat free yogurt, I didn't change a thing.  This is a great recipe if giving as a gift because of the wonderful butter flavor.  The consistency is light and airy and oh so moist, and nice carmel yellow in color. It is not heavy and dense but rich in flavor. Nice golden tops.  A really nice recipe.

This is quite possibly the best banana bread I've ever had, and I'm NOT JOKING about that! The sliced bananas, the sour cream, it all intermingles to make the most happiness-inducing banana bread imagineable. No complaints from the peanut gallery on this one. My boyfriend also loved it, and he's hard to please. :)

This is the best banana bread recipe I have tried.  It was very moist and was sweet - but not too sweet.  Like most, I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and mashed my bananas so were chunky instead of sliced.  This was fantastic.  It is my new banana bread recipe.

I have made this a half dozen times or more, and every single person who tries it falls in love with it!  I increase the recipe by 50% and bake it in a bundt pan.  I start checking it at 40 minutes and watch it until it is done.  I increase the nuts even more - to a full cup - and use pecans because they are sweeter.  Plus, I let my bananas get pretty dark and sugary before using them.  This is so easy to make and the flavor is terrific!

By far the moistest (and tastiest) banana bread recipe I've ever had!   By personal preference, I skipped the nuts (am I the only one that doesn't like nuts in my banana bread)?  I listened to the other reviewers and added 1tsp cinnamon and 1/2tsp of nutmeg.  Then, I mashed the bananas up with a fork and they ended up nice and lumpy.  Apparently my loaf pan is packed away (woops!) so I made 6 monster muffins.  Prior to baking, I dusted the tops with cinnamon sugar.   Fantastic!!!  I'll definately make them again, and again, and again.

Very good. I've made this a few times now. I've made it lower fat with fat free sour cream and applesauce for half the butter and it turned out good too. I like to add at least a teasp of cinnamon and 1/4 teasp nutmeg. Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good and moist bread. I added about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and also used brown sugar instead of white. I used pecans as that is what I had. I also used 2 mashed bananas and folded in 2 sliced bananas in the batter. Got lots of requests for recipe. Will use this all the time for my banana nut bread recipe. Thanks

Absolutely wonderful, better than my Nan's!  I substituted semisweet mini chocolate chips for the nuts and baked in a 9 inch round cake pan.  It baked in thirty-five minutes and looked beautiful on a pretty plate!  A great hospitality gift for friends, family, and neighbors!

I just made this bread last night.  It came out soooo good!  I only had small bananas so I used 2 cut up ones and then mashed 2.  I also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  I put chocolate chips in half the loaf (because my husband doesn't like them in bread) and I can't begin to tell you how good it is.  I love the chopped up banana bites.  I did set my oven on 325 and cooked it for just under and hour and it came out perfect.  Nice and brown outside and nice and moist inside.  I will definetly make this bread again!

This was a good basic recipe - the sour cream adds a nice tang, but I didn't like the sliced bananas. Next time I'll mash them as usual.

Super Yummy! - This banana bread has a great flavor that is not too sweet and is really moist. I sometimes use butter flavored shortening instead of butter and it still comes out great. I omitted the walnuts and added some mini chocolate chips instead and it disappears fast! I've tried quite a few banana bread recipes and I like this one the best.

Fabulous banana bread recipe!  My whole family loved it!  I followed the part mashed/part diced bananas hints of previous reviewers & was very pleased.  I do like the richer flavor of brown sugar, so I substituted brown for white.  Loaves freeze very well & recipe doubles with excellent results.  Thanks,Virginia (and Janet)!!

I made this bread just as the recipe directs. It was delicous & moist and gone in a day. Husband requested another loaf asap. My mom has never liked banana bread because it is too dry, but she loved this one and asked for the recipe.

Soooo good! I used low-fat sour cream and 3 bananas (1 mashed, 2 sliced) and added some golden raisins. I saved a few of the nuts and raisins for the top and it looked really pretty, too!

Good basic bana bread recipe not as much banana flavor as I expected and I used an extra banana too. I didn't slice the bananas though I just squished them with a fork really chunky.

This is delicious!  Although I used chocolate chips instead of walnuts and it was so good!  At first I thought that the sour cream was a weird ingredient and thought it would make it taste bad, but it didn't and I love it!  I also put it in a muffin shape baking thing and it's still so good!  Probably my favorite Banana Bread!  10/10 recommend!!!!!

This banana bread is so delicious! I substituted sour cream with greek yogurt and didn't add walnuts and it tasted great! Has anyone found a way to make it a little less sweet? Everyone loved it but I found it to be a little sweeter than the one my mom made growing up. I definitely recommend!

Stunning! Only change was that I don’t like walnuts so I add a couple of tablespoons of pecan meal (just ground pecans). Yummo!

Wonderful recipe! I have a couple of stand-by banana bread recipes that I've used for years (one uses mayo, the other, applesauce), but didn't have the main ingredients for them on hand so I thought I'd try this one, only to discover that my plain yogurt (which I use in place of sour cream for basically everything) was moldy! In place of the sour cream/yogurt, I used roughly a quarter cup of heavy whipping cream and a splash of lemon juice—turned out fantastic!! The outside has this wonderful light, slightly crispiness to it, the bread itself is so moist, tender and full of flavor! So happy to have another banana bread recipe to add to my growing collection! :)

I changed the white sugar to stevia. I used 1 tsp, but think it would be better 1 1/2 tsp. Everyone liked it! And instead of sour cream, I used the same amount of plain yogurt.

Best banana bread! I didn't have vanilla or walnuts on hand. Instead, I used 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1/2 tsp butter extract and pecans in place of walnuts. Those are the only extracts I had and I think a full teaspoon of almond extract would have been too overpowering. I mashed the bananas rather than sliced bc I misread the instructions. It turned out delicious!!

I decided to make muffins instead of a loaf and they turn out great! They are very moist and my grandchildren loved them!  One batch makes between 14 to 16 muffins depend on how much you fill them.  I filled them a little more then half way.  I baked them on 350 for 15 to 16 minutes. Yum

I switched the sour cream for vanilla yogurt (same amount) and used 3 mashed ripe bananas. It’s my favourite of all time. Never fails.

This was my first ever attempt at making banana bread and my son and myself were both very impressed! I used a pan to make eight small loaves from this recipe and they were perfect!So moist and flavorful I can't wait to make it again. The loaves didn't last long enough to take pictures of LOL!

My family and neighbor loved this bread!  I substituted chocolate chips for the nuts because I don’t care for nuts and that got rave reviews. I also used 3 bananas my first bake because that is the number I had and didn’t want one squishy brown banana left. I think using 3 and mashing instead of slicing them added to the flavor. It also added 15 minutes to the bake time.  Definitely a favorite.

This bread is very good and I would definitely make it again.  I tested it at 50 minutes and it wasn't done so I baked it the full 60 minutes as indicated in the recipe although I turned the heat down for the last 10 minutes because I felt it was getting too brown.  The only things I did differently - I added cinnamon (didn't measure, just sprinkled it in), mashed the bananas before adding them and only put the walnuts on top.  The walnuts were delicious however so next time I will mix them in.

I have made this three times now and absolutely love it. I made a few minor tweaks:

- Used softened butter
- Used 1 and a half cups of mashed banana
- Baked in a greased Bundt pan for less time for more even baking

Basic recipe is moist and dense and tender & nice texture and banana taste.
BUT YOU must add your own spices to your liking- note there are none listed in recipe.
 I used 1.5 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4tsp nutmeg and pinch cloves. Frosted with a cream cheese frosting.

I googled “moist banana bread” and this recipe popped up.  I couldn’t make it as is because I was missing two ingredients: white sugar and sour cream.  I substituted half a cup of brown sugar and added a whole 6 oz container of Yoplait strawberry yogurt.  I figured the sweet yogurt would cover half a cup of sugar.  The result was moist and yummy!  I also put it in two pans which made the loaves short and baked in half the time.  Definitely would make this recipe again!

Perfectly awesome!  I've made this recipe a dozen times and it's great!  I omit the walnuts because my son doesn't like them but no other changes!!!

It only lasts 2-3 days with the 3 of us!

Followed recipe exactly and it's good, but waaaay too sweet (especially if the bananas are super ripe/sweet).  For the second time, I changed it a little bit and it was even better!  
Replaced 1/2 cup of flour with almond flour, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (1/4 c  white sugar, 1/2 c coconut sugar) and added 3/4 tsp cinnamon.  I also mash the bananas rather than sliced.   Absolutely fantastic!  Moist and delicious.  It was still pretty sweet, so next time I'll reduce sugar by and additional 2 T.

I’m allergic to nuts, so I subbed chocolate chips and it was delicious. 
In the future, if the author wants to alert us to changes, why can’t they just edit the original recipe? We shouldn’t have to scan the reviews to see the adjustments. Sometimes it’s too late.

Best banana bread ever!  

A monster hit with everyone I have ever served it to.

Great for breakfast, dessert, and everything in between. Throw a little Chunky Monkey on the side if you really want to dress it up.

This is a great recipe. 
To make it healthier I use:
1/2 cup coconut oil (softened)
1 cup sugar (maybe coconut sugar)
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
3/4 cup white flour/ oat flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/2 cup walnuts
2 bananas (mashed)
For my high altitude it is easier to bake in 9" by 13" baking dish at 350 degrees for 50 minutes.

Followed recipe to the letter except I added 2 more bananas.
We like bananas. Excellent recipe definitely going into my recipe profile. I made it for my staff and it lasted about fifteen minutes.

This is the best banana bread I've ever made. I did add a little twist to the recipe. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of the mini semi sweet  Toll House  chocolate chips.

I  can't keep enough made for my family!  Delicious!!

I did not change a thing!!! I've never made banana bread where you slice the bananas, but  the pieces of banana tasted delicious after the bread was baked. Yum! I wouldn't change a thing on this recipe. Also, the sour cream was a nice touch for adding extra moisture and flavor to the bread. I am using less and less sugar in my baking these days, so I do cringe when I see a cup of sugar. But, again this is not a recipe that needs more or less of a single ingredient.

This banana bread recipe turned out delicious! I did make a couple of changes, but nothing too drastic. I used (4) mashed bananas (mine were small).  I substituted a 1/4 cup pecans and 1/4 cup almond meal for the walnuts, and used  1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, and only used 1/4 cup of sour cream. My bake time was only 50 minutes and I let it cool in pan out of the oven for 5 minutes,  before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely. I'm excited to try this recipe with pumpkin, sweet potato, or apples in the Fall :)

GREAT! I doubled the recipe and used a total of about 1 1/4 cup sour cream and added the same amount of baking powder (same amount as baking soda) and had so many compliments. I've tried many recipes but this will be the one I always come back to.

Also just made a double recipe using 1/2 sugar, 1/2 stevia and with the changes above. It didn't rise quite as high but the taste is even better than with all sugar!

Best banana bread I’ve made. I Made a few changes to this recipe. I have Celiac Disease so  I used gluten free flour instead of regular so that it’s safe for me to eat and I also added in semi sweet chocolate chips, mashed the bananas and cooked it 10-15 minutes longer as the middle was uncooked at 60. I would make this again as it tasted delicious.

By far the best banana bread recipe I've tried.  The only change I made was increasing the sugar by 1/4 cup when I use green bananas.

As usual, some ingredients were not available.   I used Splenda instead of sugar.  Used Buck-ees Sugar Coated Cashews instead of walnuts.  I think the small amount of sugar helped the browning of the loaf overall.   These had a vanilla flavoring helping the fact that I could not find my vanilla.  It came out great, even with these changes. 

 Note that one of the problems with Splenda's browning capabilities: 
sugar caramelizes, Splenda does not.

Baked in a buttered muffin tin. Used light brown sugar instead of white, used organic bread flour instead of all purpose so I added a tsp of baking powder.I added coconut, a fat tsp of cinnamon, ½ tsp nutmeg and a 1/2 tsp of organic dehydrated ginger. I didn’t have any nuts so left them out. Even with all these changes, these were so moist and flavorful and came out easily without muffin tin papers or liners. These will go fast!

My go to recipe. The best banana bread ever. I only make slight modifications. Sometimes I mash the bananas but today I just sliced and out in the mixer bowl at the end. Also use pecans instead of walnuts. Just my personal preference. Thank you Janet!

Moist, flavorful and delicious. Followed recommendations from others and creamed the butter and sugar, added cinnamon, used both brown and white sugars, and mashed 3 bananas.

This has been my go to banana bread for a few years now! Just forgot to write a review before now. The only thing I do differently is because I freeze my bananas that I want to eventually make into banana bread, I mash them thoroughly and then fold them in to the batter. ?Everyone always loves it, especially when I add chocolate chips or walnuts or such there is never any left over!

The second time I made this I discovered this recipe tastes better if you mash the bananas. I also had to leave out the walnuts as I'm allergic. I will make it again.

Delicious!! Like some others, I used 3 bananas, mashed up (one cup). I whisked together all the wet ingredients (including the sugar and bananas), then added the flour, salt and baking soda, and lastly stirred in the walnuts. I out them in a muffin tins and baked for 25 minutes. It made 16 muffins - I may fill them a little more next time so they fit in one muffin tins. My kids are going bonkers over these! Definitely making over and over again.

No changes.  Delicious.  Only concern is that I don't always have sour cream on-hand when I am trying to use over ripe bananas.  So may need to figure out a substitute for the sour cream

I just blend all the wet ingredients in together along with the bananas (I add an extra one too!). Comes out moist and delicious!! It's a favorite with my kids, usually they do not last long! Dress them up with chocolate chips or pecans. Yummy!!

I used 1/2 cup of sugar, ripe bananas and carob chocolate chips instead of walnuts. Delicious! 
I ended up having to bake loaf about 1 hour 20 mins 
Really great recipe Janet.

I have made this recipe MULTIPLE time! I love it every time. I look forward to my bananas getting over ripe so I can make it. The only two things I do to jazz it up are smash the bananas so there are no chunks (I just put chopped bananas in a bowl and smash them with a fork). And, I substitute the nuts for chocolate chips! Yummmmm!!!!!

Followed the recipe, and the recommendation to beat the eggs and sugar first before adding the remaining ingredients. I also cut the sugar a bit since my bananas were extra extra ripe. Came out great, held together when removing from pan.

The family devoured it! It was super delicious and moist. I used 1/2 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of baking powder and enough bananas too equal 1 cup. I also mashed the bananas in with the eggs. It took 1 hour and 15 minutes to bake and was cooked perfectly. We will definitely be using this recipe from now on!

These were the suggestions in the first review. *cream the softened butter with the sugar (not melted). I add 1 tsp. lemon juice with the vanilla, and use 1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder, and 1-3/4 c. flour. Finally, regardless of how many bananas are used it should equal 1 cup.* I followed these suggestions exactly and the rest of the recipe as written; it was superb! It was moist, just sweet enough w/o being overly sweet, and absolutely delicious. I mashed the bananas up with a wooden spoon in a 1-cup glass measuring cup until it was full. I made it one morning and it was gone by the next morning.

I’m with NAPLES 34102
I followed her adjustments except I used the juice of the whole lemon.  I make everything with spelt flour rather than wheat. 
I cook outdoors in a roaster (no glass cover) so you can imagine how tricky baking anything is. This had the most marvelous flavor. I especially liked having sliced bananas so I can actually get a contrasting texture with the banana versus the bread.
 I’ve been making banana bread for years and I don’t know why but the flavor of this was absolutely divine.  I used heavy cream and THIS is the recipe I will be using from here on out.
My remote thermometer is broken so I had to keep taking the cover off the roaster. Anticipating the center not cooking properly I split it into two loaf pans instead of one. When my thermometer arrives I’ll just put this in one loaf pan as usual. Still tasteS great!!  Highly recommend *****

I mashed the bananas, as several others said they did. I also added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon and substituted pecans for the walnuts. It was moist and had a rich flavor.

add 1/4 baking powder. decrease temp to 325 for the last 25 minutes because it was browning too quickly. My pan was slightly smaller (maybe 8in?) so I made one extra ramekin muffin worth of batter.  Make two extra muffins text time (this one overflowed).  Use chocolate chips instead of walnuts

One of my favorite recipes. Here’s how I adjust it for my own tastes. I cream the butter and sugar. I reduce to sour cream to 1/4 cup. And I use 3 ripened bananas that are mashed rather than sliced.

This is a great recipe.  I used it for muffins.  It made 18 muffins.  Baked at 350 for 30 minutes.    I made the following adjustments.   I used room temperature butter and 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla.  Before I baked them, I sprinkled a light amount of white sugar on top.

Yummy! Next time I'm going to try cooking at 325 instead of 350 and for 1 hr  15 min instead of 1 hour because it doesn't get done in the middle but gets super brown on outside (so after an hour I covered with foil, turned down to 325 and cooked 10 more minutes.) I mashed the bananas instead of slicing, and used pecans instead of walnuts. Delish! :)

Like many others, I made a few adjustments: creamed the butter and sugar together, and added butterscotch chips to the batter and as a topping. I used an 8x8in pan and it came out PERFECT! It took about 58 minutes. I thought it would end up dry, but after storing in an airtight container overnight, it somehow became more moist than it was shortly after baking and cooling. The sour cream really makes a difference and this is a recipe I'll use again and again!

So stinking good! This is my new go-to recipe. I did 1/2 cup white granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Also added pumpkin pie spice for luck. The mini loafs I made turned out delicious and not dry at all thanks to the sour cream.  Looking forward to more over-ripe bananas so I can make it again. Also, it was a huge hit with my 5 year-old. Yay!

I double the banana, add some cinnamon and nutmeg, add about 1/4 cup applesauce, and omit the nuts. Delicious. I even tried sneaking in 2 tbs. ground flax, and the kiddos couldn't tell! win win!

Best banana bread I’ve ever made and so simple to make. Although it probably wasn’t necessary added a pinch of cinnamon and clove. Covered the last 10 minutes to prevent over browning. Also sprinkled the top with a sugar and cinnamon mix. Only took 50 minutes to bake seeing as how my oven runs hot.

This is our go to banana bread recipe.  I’ve got some picky eaters in my house and I get all thumbs up for this one.  The kids love to eat it for breakfast in the morning.  I usually make 2 loaves, one with nuts and one without,  sometimes we add other mix-one just for fun, like chocolate chips, coconut flakes, etc.  Can’t go wrong.  thanks for posting this.

Love this recipe. I’ve been using it for years. I only use ½ the sugar and substitute a ½ cup of flour for flaxseed meal to make it a bit less of a dessert.

Made the exact recipe to the letter. Did not rise at all. Was done 10 minutes early but outside crust was very hard. All ingredients were fresh so would not make again. Flavor was only ok. Should there have been baking powder as well as soda? This was a fail.

This was a Christmas hit! Based on reviews, I made the following modifications - used softened butter, not melted and creamed butter and sugar using a hand mixer; used 1 cup mashed bananas vs 2 sliced (I bake my bananas in the skin, and walnuts in the shell, in the oven first for 25mins); added 1 tsp lemon juice to bananas; reduced sugar by 1/4 cup and used 1/2 cup brown and 1/4 cup white instead of all white; added 1 tsp baking powder along with the baking soda; doubled the vanilla; increased flour by 1/4 cup; added a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg, and decreased the sour cream by half. I also changed the order and added the bananas after the eggs and beat with hand mixer, then folded flour mixture in with a spatula and then folded in sour cream (and nuts if desired). Do not overbeat. It dries out the bread. Bread was so moist and delicious! Absolutely perfect. People were still looking for more after it was all gone! I managed to save a slice, and it was even more moist 2 days later.

NAPLES24102 has the best revision to this.  I have followed her version so many times and never disappointed.  I made the most recent for a choco-holic friend of mine for her birthday.  Chocolate chips, walnuts, drizzled chocolate and some Skor bits on top - not a dry seat in the house.

HEALTHY VERSION:  What a delicious banana bread. With a few substitutes I made a healthier version.  It turned out amazing!  I also doubled the recipe and froze 1 loaf.  I used low fat sour cream; half white sugar and half brown sugar/Splenda blend; 1/2 white flour and half whole grain buck wheat flour. As in other reviews I used 1 tsp. Lemon juice and 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda.  I mashed the bananas and cooked 40 minutes checking with a toothpick after 5 minute intervals. Total cook time was 55 minutes.

Entirely too "wet." Even at 60 minutes, the loaf did not cook all the way through. 

It tastes great though. Perhaps a slight reduction in moisture content?

This is my go to banana bread recipe! It truly is the best! I have also, like others have commented, used yogurt in replace of the sour cream if I had it on hand. Banana yogurt is a great option!

It’s my new go-to recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Best banana bread i’ve ever had in my life. Nice crunch on the outside and soft and moist on the inside! I added a couple shakes of nutmeg and cinnamon to mine and used pecans instead of walnuts and it is absolutely going to be my go-to recipe from now on!

Made it with the exact ingredients but mashed the bananas and it was delicious. I’ve sometimes used 3 ripe bananas with great results. This is my go-to banana bread recipe for the last 5 years. So good that I give it out as gifts during the holidays.

My family LOVES this banana bread.  It is very moist. But definitely mash the bananas. I use a potato masher and mash until the bananas are a liquid.

I'll make this again! Simple recipe. Loaf is moist inside and taste is great. Notes:
1. I sprinkled the walnuts on TOP before baking, rather than folding them in, looks nice, and kids can easily avoid them. 
2. Ran out of sour cream, used nonfat greek yogurt to fill the measuring cup up, no issue.
3. Baked in glass loaf pan on middle rack at 350 for 50 min. Next time I'd drop temp to 325, or take loaf out 5-10 min. earlier (edges are dry and bread is too dark on bottom).

I did not have time to make a loaf, so I made muffins instead, baking them at 350 for 17-18 minutes. They were tremendous. This is now my go-to banana bread recipe. There is no need to look any further.

Very moist and delicious. I mashed it as one reviewer suggested.. I would recommend slightly less time in the oven. I also added cinnamon for a little Christmas flair.

This is by far my favorite banana bread. I make it all the time.
I made two little changes, I only use half a cup of sugar and instead of sour cream, I use non-fat Greek yogurt. 
The best banana bread!.

As a baker, I have memorized and used this recipe so many times for many years. I volunteer a lot with my church and among my fancier desserts like tiramisu, cheesecake, and creme brulee, my banana bread is always the surprising request despite how easy it is. I have often multiplied this to feed hundreds in the snowy mountains for long workdays and am often asked to make this at retreat camps as well. I've done many variations and just know that as long as you MASH your bananas, and never forget to use EITHER sour cream or yogurt (honestly whatever you have on hand), you'll be fine. I have seen that it honestly doesn't matter if you "accidentally" throw an extra banana or use oil instead of butter, melted vs softened... none of that is going to fundamentally change this recipe - just don't omit the sour cream/yogurt. That's the game-changer. In the California mountains, I could only find those strawberry and peach flavored yogurt cups and it was still great (a lil extra sugar and fruit don't hurt). There's one man who literally yells "where's my banana bread?!" every time he sees me now since I made that in the mountains and it's become a running joke. People think I'm crazy for having memorized this but it's a simple recipe that honestly can't go wrong given how many times, for how many people, and in how many places I have made this recipe. After about 12 years of using this, I felt I should give the recipe its much-owed respect for the oddly undeserved fame it has won me.

I pretty much stuck to the recipe except for about 1/2 cup more bananas and I only had X large eggs. The last time I made it, someone indicated that they thought there were too many bananas in the recipe, but I thought it needed more and it did turn out more delicious with the added bananas. I accidentally baked it on 375 degrees so it was done after 45 minutes. It's wonderfully moist on the inside and just the right amount of sweetness. I would like to add nuts but my kids hate them. It's still good without them.

Excellent recipe and I’ve made it several times changing how I mash or slice bananas.  Other reviews seem to not like the texture of sliced bananas in the bread but I don’t find that to be a problem.

This banana bread is as good as my Grandma Minnie's (the best cook ever!) I think she put buttermilk in hers. I sent some to my sister's house (2 of her grandchildren and my Mother live there). The next day she brought me 4 over ripe bananas and requested a double batch! They all loved it so much! I made a double batch of this recipe yesterday. After an hour,  the top of both loaves were well browned but they didn't pass the toothpick test. I had to bake them for another 25 minutes. They turned out just right. I don't know what the difference was this time, but I'm glad that I checked them.

Excellent recipe.  Slicing the bananas make a moist bread with more banana flavor.

This was the first banana bread I have ever made. It came out so good and moist. The only thing that I changed was substituting  erythritol for sugar.

this is great - I did mash the bananas and used more -3-4 depending on size 
I creamed the butter with sugar. 
Also my workers like chocolate chips- so that is always added to the mix about 7oz
very moist!

I've made this twice now and both times it has turned out perfect. A nice crisp crust, dense and moist inside and so full of flavor. I took the advice of many other reviewers and used 3 bananas, mashed not sliced. I didn't have sour cream so I used vanilla yogurt (lowfat not nonfat) instead.

This is my absolute go to for banana bread! I've made it multiple times over the years and everyone always loves it! The only difference I think I do is I use frozen bananas which I heat in the microwave until they are pretty much liquid and add them in.  I also usually use vanilla flavored greek yogurt which adds to the taste!

Made as written with a few additions.  Added the 1 tsp of lemon juice/zest with the vanilla, 1 tsp of both baking powder and soda, however I did not increase the amount of flour used.  I also used 1 C of mashed bananas and creamed together sugar and butter.  Was excellent.

I mashed the bananas and added a teaspoon of cinnamon.  I also made it gluten free by using a mix of all purpose Trader Joe's gluten free flour and almond flour.  My husband isn't a big banana fan, but he really liked this.  I thought it was yummy!   A perfect Banana Bread recipe here!

Best recipe I have found for Banana Bread. I read many comments and didn't melt the butter, used half white and brown sugar, had eggs at room temp and whipped them a little, used half whole wheat and half white flour, used 1 t. lemon juice, made it with 1 t. baking soda -adding it LAST - and 1 t. baking powder, used less than 1/2 c. sour cream - 1/4 or so, used mashed bananas - from freezer - thawed, added 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/4 t. cloves, will add 1/4 t. nutmeg next time - was out.  Will used pecans next time, as I didn't want to use nuts until I found out if this worked. I LOVE THIS RECIPE - the rest of my recipes will be trashed! Thank you to all the people for all the suggestions. I used almost all of the ones I read!!! Love it! Put cinnamon and sugar on the bottom of the pan after I spayed. Put cinnamon and sugar on top of the loaf before baking.

This recipe was great. I followed the advice of naples34102 and added some flour and baking powder and baking soda. My grandchildren didn’t want nuts so I left them out this time. I will make this again and again. It isn’t a dark looking bread and I liked that. It’s also not as heavy as some banana breads. Surely this recipe has done a service for the banana industry. I’ll certainly be buying more.

This is the best banana bread I have had.  I made a few adjustments.  I mashed the bananas and left out the walnuts.  I added a cup of peanut butter and 1/8 tsp Nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of Cinnamon.  Also I baked it at 325 for 75 minutes and it came out perfect and so moist.  I love it.  Next time  I am going to make it exactly the same but I am going to add in chocolate chips.

Banana bread has been tricky for me because it’s always so hard to get the middle to cook through without burning the edges. This one turned out perfectly. It’s moist without being mushy. The taste is spot on. My kids couldn’t get enough! This will be my go to recipe from now on.

Absolutely amazing. Best banana bread I’ve ever had. I agree with everyone else. Definitely just mash the bananas, don’t slice them. I have made the bread both ways and it has come out the best when I just mashed them. Also, here’s a tip. Definitely add cinnamon, nutmeg &/or pumpkin pie spice. It really does make a difference?!!

I am not a big fan of banana nut bread, but when someone asks me to make it, I will.  This is a great recipe!!!  I was little scared of the sour cream in the recipe, but it works.

The banana flavor is amazing! I mashed the bananas rather than slicing them, added 1 t. lemon juice, 1 t. baking powder, 1 t cinnamon, 1/4 t nutmeg and a full cup of mashed bananas. Made six mini loaves but I should have made 5 since the pans weren't really full. Will do it again with less pans!

I blended the bananas with the sugar and eggs, rather than slicing them, and substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I was thrilled with how the bread turned out. I’m giving this recipe 4 stars because the sliced banana instructions would not yield as good results as mashing and blending them.

Excellent just as outlined.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  The nuts are a must in my opinion.  i used unsalted butter which seemed to work well.  I might try an extra banana next time.

I mash the bananas and sometimes throw an extra one in. Yum! This morning I was out of vanilla so I added rum flavoring instead. SO YUMMY! This is a staple recipe in our house.

After reading reviews I made the tweeks most people suggested and this is a delicious recipe. I creamed butter and sugar, added lemon juice and mashed the bananas. Throwing out the old recipe and keeping this one!

I made this today for the first time and I followed the original recipe except for using 3 bananas instead of 2 and mashed them. Turned out great. Will definitely make it again soon.

So moist & delicious, it doesn't even need butter - but everything is better with butter!
I have never made banana bread without mashing the bananas. Slicing them leaves bigger chunks throughout, so my daughter who doesn't like bananas enjoyed it, but requested I mash them next time.

Absolutely love it. I didn't have ripened bananas so I threw two of them into the oven at 350 for about 8-10 minutes till they looked appropriately ripe. The loaf has been a huge hit with friends and family.

This is my go too recipe.  Easy and delicious but I add the banana into the wet mix and whisk together before the dry ingredients.  I also add cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of cloves to make it a bit spiced.  It takes it up a notch.  I don’t use nuts due to allergies.  Family and friends ask for this regularly and I always am proud to make to bring to someone’s home

I just pulled this out of the oven about 45 minutes ago and can't keep my hands off of it! It's delicious! This will be my go-to recipe for banana bread, which I don't make very often but when I do I want it to be outstanding and this is!

Perfect!  So moist and delicious!  I’ve made this several times. I’ve made it in loaf form and in muffin/mini muffin form. Both work well. It’s also awesome with the addition of chocolate chips!!  I mashed the banana basset in others reviews. I think the sour cream adds a great little tang.

I have made his recipe three times now. Turns out wonderful every time. First time I creamed butter and sugar together and it was good! Second time I forgot and added the egg and vanilla after the flour and it was good. Third time I followed directions exactly and it was very good! So no matter what this recipe is fool proof!

I’ve made this banana bread several times and it’s a hit every time. The only change I made is to substitute plain non-fat Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream (more protein and less fat).

I must have made this bread at least 15 times in three years, I make sure to use carry gold butter the richer the butter the more tender the inside and I always add some kind of shaved chocolate something salted is really nice along with either pecans or walnuts. Also I undercook by 10 mins, because I like a pudding texture.  We’ve got renamed it the promise bread because people are always asking me to promise to make it. I don’t know who Janet is, but this is by far my favorite recipe I have found online that I keep re visiting.

I  mashed the bananas instead of slicing them, but I still left  few bigger chunks, and I think this gives a better texture. Other than that, my whole family loves this banana bread! It's our favorite recipe to use. I have also made it with plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and that works great. You could even spice it up with some chocolate chips in the bread!

As others mentioned, I mashed the bananas. Added cinnamon and divided into two loaf pans. Bake time was 10 minutes shorter and it tastes amazing. Best banana bread I’ve ever had!

I mashed the bananas as suggested by other reviewers. This was too moist for me. Maybe it was too well mixed because it didn't come out as good as I wanted. I like my banana bread more flour-y if that make any sense.

The best yet!
I had 3 dead bananas, so I used them all, and probably had a little more than 1/2 cup of sour cream. Took a lot longer than the recommended time. Checked it at 50min, still undone center. Ended up giving it another 20min!

I make this every weekend. I send my boyfriend to work with a slice every morning. He never gets tired of it. I like to add banana extract in addition to the vanilla. It's amazing.

Best banana bread ever! I I have made this bread multiple times and believe me  its the most moist  banana bread I ever had.  I personally use really really over ripe mushy runny  bananas , which may add to the moistness and extra banana flavor. I also was out of vanilla extract  last time I made it so I used almond extract instead, delish ! You can t go wrong with this recipe.

I made this recipe and it was the best banana nut bread ever. I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I added nutmeg and cinnamon. This was the best  I ever made.

Great recipe that you can tweak to make it your own.  Instead of using sour cream, I used vanilla yogurt.  I also put in candied pecans instead of walnuts..  Everyone loves it...

Made it with the suggested tweaks- mashed banana, used 1 tsp of baking powder and baking soda, added 1/4 cup more of flour, and added chocolate chips instead of nuts. Smell was amazing and taste was equally amazing. Will definitely make again ... maybe tomorrow.

I reduced the amount of sugar and increased the amount of bananas. Make sure you're using ripe bananas that are beginning to blacken. They are sweet and add flavor to the recipe.  Loved it.  It's a favorite recipe that I repeat often.

Love this recipe.  Makes a moist, not to sweet banana bread.  The only thing I differently was use 3 bananas.  Will make again for sure.

I've been baking this banana bread for at least 10 years, and I will never use a different recipe! This is by far the best way to use your overripe bananas. Moist on the inside, crisp on the outside, plus it makes your house smell heavenly!

I usually try to make recipes as they are written and I had every intention with this recipe until I realized I didn't have enough sour cream.  I subbed strawberry yogurt for the sour cream and instead of using walnuts, I added a half cup of chocolate chips instead.  It was very good.  The bread had a hint of strawberry and the banana wasn't overpowering so both flavors balanced each other.

Made this for a dinner party and substituted the Sour Cream with Crème Fraîche....wow! Came out super moist and the Crème Fraîche truly enhanced the flavor and the texture. Made two loaves and they were devoured within minutes.

I’ll DEFINITELY make this again and again!  Moist, bursting with flavor and not overly sweet.
I added dark Belgian chocolate chips, substituted the sour cream for fat free Greek yogurt, added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  
I used a bundt pan, so lowered the oven to 325 for 70 mins.  HEAVEN!

I made this as a thank you for a friend who let us borrow their neighborhood for trick or treating since we live in the sticks. Since I was buying ingredients, I got enough to make a loaf for my family as well. It was a big hit! I made it exactly as the recipe states, no deviation. Definitely adding it to the fall bread rotation.

I switched out the bananas for frozen blueberries, lemon zest and lemon juice. I four times the recipe and it made 7 mini loafs. I used the zest and juice from 6 small lemons. I placed a sheet of foil over the top of them at the 30 minute point, and bake them for another 30 minutes. The crust was hard but oh so good! Next time I make it, I will be cutting the sugar in half as it was too sweet for me, even though my friends didn't complain about the sweetness. I will also be reducing the amount of lemon juice I will add the next time around as well.

Actually...ive made this recipe twice and I love it ...first time turned out a tad dry, but that's because I didn't have enough sour cream I think  (And no time to get more)...this time around is perfect :)

Loved It! I didn’t have sour cream so I used 1/4 cup regular mayo(not salad dressing, full fat not low/fat free) I did add a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves not that it was needed, just because that’s how my mother and grandmother both did it. Quick and easy to put together, will be my go to recipe.

I followed the recipe and used the sour cream to make the bread rich and moist. Loved it. Though the banana wasn’t really ripened which gave a little off taste. Next time I will make with really ripened bananas and cream cheese instead of sour cream. Overall, I am very happy with this recipe. Thank you for sharing!

It was ok. I’ve made banana bread many times a d decided to try something new for a change. I made it exactly as the recipe states, and it was really just ok. It was moist, but not quite what I was looking for. It’s not a bad recipe, but not my favorite.

I don't give anything 5 stars if I make changes.  Softened butter, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp baking powder, mashed bananas, 1 tsp. cinnamon & 1/2 tsp Allspice.  I used pecans because my daughter is allergic to walnuts.  Excellent moist bread!!!!

Made it second time. First with original recipe and second one with reviewer suggestions, lemon juice, baking soda, baking powder. Second one is the winner!

This is so good! I did like some others mentioned and creamed the sugar and butter at room temperature instead of melted butter. I also let the eggs get to room temp and mashed the bananas. I didn't have walnuts so I used chopped pecans instead, which I like better anyway. So moist and delicious!

I did make a few subs, 
1 cup of allpurpose + 1/2 cup of whole wheat - which made it quite thick
so doubled the  sour  cream quantity and added both baking soda and baking powder to make it not so dense. Loved the result.

Everytime I make this I get compliments.  Great recipe.  I have changed a few things .  I add 1/2 cup white sugar and and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar.  I melt butter first and use a basting brush to coat bread pan with some of the butter.  Then I take the white sugar pour it in the bread pan and coat the sides and then pour the sugar that doesn't stick to the pan in the bowl to mix with the rest of the ingredients.  That makes a nice sugary coating on the sides of the bread without adding more sugar.  Depending on the softness of the bananas sometimes I slice them and sometimes I just mush them in.  Last I reserve a little of the brown sugar and sprinkle that on top with a little cinnamon before baking.

Been making this for a long time-laminated the recipe and will keep it forever! I mash the bananas and sometimes I do a crumb topping on them to mix it up a bit.  
1/4 cup flour
1/4 cup butter melted
1 cup pecans
1 cup sugar
Mix together and top before baking

I followed the recipe exactly and this turned out very flavorful and moist.  Like some of the other bakers, I think I’d prefer mashed vs sliced bananas so I’ll try that next time.  The outside edges were crisp (not burnt) so I might shave a couple minutes off of the baking time.  This is a keeper!

Great! I used 4 bananas and replaced the sour cream with a container of plain greek yogurt. Followed previous reviewers suggestion of 1 3/4 cup flour and added a tsp of baking soda. Added 1tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. nutmeg. Came out GREAT!

Following others’ suggestions, I used mashed bananas, softened butter, Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and added cinnamon and nutmeg. I probably should have taken it out of the oven before 60 minutes, because the edges were a bit dark. With these changes, it turned out pretty good.

This was by FAR the best banana bread I have ever made. And... I’ve made so many loafs of this kind before. I did make a wee adjustment, however. I thought there was a bit too much white sugar while I was first looking at the recipe, so I took out 1/2 a cup of sugar and added more banana instead. I’m the type to have a bunch of frozen bananas on hand, so I could spare an extra. Boy this sure was tasty, I kept on pounding back the slices- something I don’t always do! I highly recommend this recipe.

I’ve made this recipe a few times now and I’ve finally perfected it to my liking. I did add 1/2tsp. Baking powder. I used three very ripe bananas instead of two. I brushed the top with butter when it came out of the oven and I also placed this in a glass covered cake dish once it was done to trap the steam and make all those outer crusts super moist like the bread itself. I’m not a fan of crispier crusts. I also added 1/4tsp. Of cinnamon to the batter. This recipe is very flexible and good as written but I feel these changes make for the banana bread my grandma used to make.

This bread is excellent! So many banana bread recipes are dry ... not this one - moist AND great tasting. The sour cream not only helps keep it moist, it balances well with the bananas - very tasty! This will be my "go to" banana bread recipe going forward. I've been searching for one for quit a while. 

note: I did not add the nuts, but only because I didn't have any.

This is a wonderful banana bread. I did change the method of mixing, as others have mentioned. I mashed the bananas,  creamed soft butter and the sugar together, then added the vanilla and eggs. Then flour mixture, followed by the rest of the ingredients. Also, toast those nuts! It only takes a couple of extra minutes, and it makes so, so much better. Great depth of flavor.

Amazing. Hubs and I both loved it. I scarfed down 3 slices in a row! :O 

CHANGES MADE: mashed the bananas instead of slicing and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg (which I couldn't taste at all, next time I'll add 1/2 tsp). 

Will absolutely make again!

Excellent Recipe and Delicious

I substituted pecans for the walnuts an used 4 very ripe small bananas. No need to mash bananas beforehand, just add them into the mixture as described....I had no lumps or clumps of bananas in the bread.  The spices, instant vanilla pudding an the butter crisco is what makes this recipe so deliciously  ‘moist’.  I definitely will make this again!

I make this recipe all the time for my husband's office manager.  She's diabetic, so I sub 1/2 c of Stevia for 1 cup of white sugar and she says she can't tell the difference.  She agrees it's one of the moistest banana breads she's had and bugs me often to make it for her. Thank you for posting this!

I used full fat mayonnaise in place of sour cream (improvised, I didn't have any) and added a 1/2 cup of mini dark chocolate chips. I also cooked it in a bundt pan and it was done in 30 minutes. Sent it to my husbands work and they LOVED IT!!

Amazing! I only had about 1/2 cup of regular flour left, so I used bread flour for the rest and it turned out fantastic! Best banana bread recipe I’ve ever tried.

If I could give 6 stars, I would. This is hands down the best banana bread recipe I’ve EVER made. Most banana bread recipes end up being dry and overcooked, or completely underdone. I followed this recipe almost as is, just used an extra 1/4 cup of sour cream (I put a good amount of sour cream in almost everything I bake to ensure it gets cooked all the way, but stays moist), replaced walnuts with chocolate chips, and of course I mashed the bananas rather than sliced them. This is a recipe I will be using for the rest of my life! Thank you!

I was out of sour cream and decided to use applesauce instead. I was worried if it would still be delicious and… I am so very happy with it!! This is my new #1 go to recipe for banana bread.

My 9 yr. old daughter and I make this bread once a month and it turns out great every time. We like to experiment with extra ingredients, this last time was strawberries. It was delicious. I have to substitute the egg with applesauce due to an allergy, it just makes it a little denser.

I dont like the texture of bananas (but of course I love banana bread!) So I kept to the more common mashing of the banana instead of slicing. 
The Sour cream really does keep the banana bread moist! 
Depending the season, I will add clove, allspice and/or cinnamon to it as well! just a tsp.

I’ve made this bread several times, but today brought it to my new job of 3.5 months. One coworker told me it was the best banana bread she’s ever had! The only thing different I did was use ripe bananas and mashed them and used one cup of pecans (because I love nuts!).

Very delicious the only change I made was I used 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon. It was yummy. Will make again!

I tested this recipe along with 2 others on this site and 3 others from other sites and this was by far the best one.  The only change I’ve made (after trying it as written) is using 3 bananas and mashing them.  Super moist and wonderful flavour.  For an extra little bit of decadence, try mixing a crumb topping (brown sugar, butter and flour) and sprinkling it on top before baking.

I made it as written just to see how it turns out. It take longer to cook in my oven than the stated 60 minutes. I had to add about 25 minutes before it came out clean. Right now it's cooling, so I can not judge the taste at the moment. Very easy to throw together. I will edit this when I am able to cut it and taste it. So right now its a 5 star for ease.

Edited to add, this recipe was a hit with all. I made it as written except I didn't have chopped walnuts so I used chopped pecans. So it gets 5 stars for ease and flavor.

Very Moist! I make this daily for my family and friends. They always love it and it never turns out dry. I've made many loaves of banana bread and this is my go-to recipe. I've also used this recipe to make muffins which turned out great!

It is really moist...perhaps a little too much.

I added some cinnamon and mashed the bananas.  I would add another 1/4 cup of flour next time.  Otherwise this is a bloody good recipe!

This truly is the most moist banana nut bread I've ever made! I made a few small modifications:  added a few dark chocolate chips and used two smaller loaf pans. 
The best part is eating a slice with a little butter while its still warm. I really loved the perfect crunch that developed on the crust. Overall, tastes great!!

My husband has congestive heart failure so I try to takes much sodium and fat out as possible. I used no-sodium baking powder and added no salt. I also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. It is magnificent. Moist. Dense and full of grea banana flavor. I would have given it a high rating if I could.

Comes out great every time! With 3 to 4 bananas I did find that lowering my temp to 335 for 90 minutes works better. It was a bit too dark for my liking when cooked at 350.

I follow the recipe exactly except cutting back slightly on sugar and mashing bananas. I find the 60 minutes results in dry bread, mine is perfect at around 53 minutes.

This is very, very good. It is very rich and very moist.   I left the nuts out, used 3 bananas and did have to bake an extra 10 minutes. Rave reviews at work. Only comment I got for a change was I could back off on the butter a little. This was said as my coworker was reaching for a second piece so he thought it was great. Lol. Only 1 person thought it was a little too mushy from sliced bananas. She likes a more dense bread. I liked the consistency.

I had some frozen, very ripe bananas in freezer.  Probably four.  Thawed them in a bowl.  Lots of sweet juice.  Decreased the sugar and added the juice with the dough.  This was very easy to make.  The bread had a nice crust too.  Maybe I'll add nutmeg next time.

I've made this a few times using sour cream, but haven't used it lately because  my husband and I have cut out dairy and high fat  foods so never buy sour cream; I recently discovered Oikos non fat banana flavoured Greek yogurt and it works amazingly well in this recipe!

FABULOUS!!  Rich and full of flavor. The sour cream adds to the moistness. When I butter the pans I do a cinnamon/sugar coating of the pan, and then  pour in the batter, adds a perfect little extra to this already amazing recipe. One more thing, I MASH the bananas...??

This was a hit with my family. They prefer some chunks of banana so I’ll do both smashed and chucks of banana minus the walnuts. I’ve made it several times now.  It’s an easy recipe to follow and my kiddo loves to help.

This is SUCH a good banana bread.  Made it as per recipe the first time and it was great.  Experimented the second time with this:  used Vietnamese cinnamon. It has a much higher cinnamon oil content and makes a world of difference.  If you can't find it you can order it from King Arthur's flour.  Next, I used more banana, and finally, I grated FRESH nutmeg and made it into over the top banana bread.  I had to go to a "health" food store to find a nutmeg.  If you go to a regular grocery store they are SO expensive but if you go to the health food store you can buy ONE.  I think mine cost 50 cents.

This is a great basic BNB recipe. And I say that because it was pretty good, but wasn't great... And I followed the recipe almost to a T, except that I thought 2 bananas was too few, so I added half a banana more.

So, yes, very moist, and light, crisp crust when fresh out of the oven. But, I probably should have read the reviews before making it, as more bakers said that they added more bananas, and also a lot of them added more spices. And, when I tasted it, it definitely could have benefitted from those additions. I needed more banana flavor. And, I also believe the mashing vs slicing could have helped the flavor distribute better. Next time!

Rarely write reviews but this recipe deserves my two cents.  In my 68 yrs I have made hundreds of loaves of banana bread from many recipes (and eaten many made by others) but I will never use another recipe.  Made this yesterday and am ashamed to say how many slices I have eaten but this is the best banana bread I have ever eaten. It is so moist, makes a large loaf and flavor is intense and so flavorful. Followed recipe to the letter with one exception...had 3 ripe bananas on hand so used all 3. Don't know if that made a difference, doubt it, but will stick with 3 in the future as it was perfect for me.  This bread is perfection and can't wait to make for family and friends.

To me, this is classic banana bread that you would find in a bakery: it's on the sweeter side and it's high enough in fat that it leaves a little grease on your fingers after you've had a slice. What I love the most is the crust: it has a crunch to it but is also almost fudgey due to the sugar content. I did use 3 bananas because I had 3 I needed to use up, and I mashed them of course. I love this recipe because it's perfect if I am having a sweet tooth week, and I can cut back down on the sugar and fat when I am craving a healthier bread. And I always add 1 cup chocolate chips. Other than that, I do melt the butter as stated. I feel banana bread should be quick to make and I can't be bothered with any creaming. I plop the batter into parchment paper I press down into a mold which is always a little scrunched up in the corners. Wet and dry ingredients are mixed in the same bowl.

I’ve made this several times. I follow the recipe almost to the T. My only change is to fully mash the bananas rather than just slice them. It’s fabulous!!

This is hands down, the best recipe for banana bread. I began using this recipe years ago and haven't strayed since. Instead of slicing the bananas, I use 1 cup mashed bananas.

I actually love this recipe!  I almost made this recipe exactly as is until I realized the sour cream container in my fridge was EMPTY (thanks to my daughter who puts it on almost everything).  So, instead of sour cream I used almond milk.  It was very moist and flavorful.  I took it to a cookout and the crowd loved it!  This recipe is definitely a winner in my book.  Next time, I'll make sure sour cream is on hand.

I finally did it… I crossed the line! After mashing the bananas, I mixed in 1/4 cup of Knob Creek Smoked Maple bourbon whiskey!  It’s a winner!  Subtle on flavor but it worked! Also, every time I make this fabulous recipe I mix in 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.

Great recipe! Very moist and nice that it has minimal ingredients. The only reason I didn’t go five stars is because they call for fresh sliced bananas. I could only imagine what that texture would be like, and the next day having black mushy bananas in your bread is not good. So I subbed and used old bananas that I keep in the freezer when they start going bad sitting around on the counter. Just thawed 3 of those and then mashed up before adding to batter as recipe called for at end (which is the only way I make banana bread, never use fresh). Good recipe, will use again for sure.

GREAT banana bread! I substituted walnuts for chocolate chips and it was delectable! Also, I found out it is better to mash the bananas than to slice them! I think you would like it much better that way!

I make this all the time, i usually end up subbing yogurt for the sourcream as thats not something I normally have on hand. I swear my mom buys bananas just to let them go "bad" so I can make her this bread.

I made this in my Breadman Plus on the “Batter” cycle. This was my 1st time using that  cycle. I made a few changes as recommended by others:1 3/4 c flour, 1 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder. I mashed 2 large bananas which equaled 1.25 cups. I substituted 1/4 c of honey for 1/4 c sugar. I also added 3 tbsp of chia seeds hydrated very briefly in 1/2 c water. (Trying to be healthy!) Outcome was super moist and VERY tasty! This recipe is in my forever favorite recipes!

I tried many, many recipes and landed on this one. My family loves it. I’ve given it away at Christmas time as gifts for friends and family. Today, our exchange student and I made it and this time we had a chocolate chips. My family will not let me make it any other way now.

I have made this over 20 times and it comes out perfect every time. The only thing I substitute is greek yogurt for sour cream. It comes out so moist.

Made this last night. The only thing I changed was the type of nut. I used pecans instead of walnuts, and it was delicious!! This loaf was super moist and so so good. My husband said it was one of the best things I've ever baked for him!!! Thank you so much for sharing!!! Will definitely make again.

I’ve  used this recipe several times and everyone that tastes it LOVES IT!!
It’s really good as is, but occasionally I add an extra small banana. My oven usually takes a little longer than 60 minutes. 
This is my favorite banana bread recipe that I have tried!!!

This is the best banana bread that I have ever tasted.  Don’t know what it was, but I followed the recipe as written, but did add a teaspoon of cinnamon.  It’s an ingredient I always use in my banana bread.  It was GREAT!!!

I’ve been making this now for a couple years. It’s a terrific recipe. I switch out the nuts for raisins and also use 1/2 of sour cream with applesauce. Yum! Moist and yummy!

Soooo good!  This recipe is very easy to make and comes out super moist and delicious.  The only things I changed were, first, I substituted the flour for a gluten free flour blend (Namaste brand Organic Perfect Flour Blend) and, second, I used a plain Greek yogurt with a Tbsp of fresh lemon juice as a replacement for sour cream.  I also had to cook it an additional 5 minutes and it still came out insanely moist!   I should've cooked it another 5 additional minutes.  Overall, this recipe is easy, yummy, and most.

So moist! I made some minor modifications based on what I had in my kitchen, but feel overall I followed the recipe. Will definitely be my go-to banana bread recipe from now on. I mashed the bananas because that's what I'm used to with banana bread. I also used 3 bananas because that's how many overly ripe ones I had. I used 1/3 cup of plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream. (I decreased the greek yogurt measurement slightly because of the extra moisture from bananas - I have no idea if that was actually necessary.)  I also added 1/4 tsp cloves, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I wouldn't recommend the cloves though. I'd like more banana flavor and less spice, my bad. I'll make again without adding spices to see how it goes.

I only cooked it for 50 minutes and it was perfect.  I added a few things to make it that much healthier.  1/2 cup unsweetened coconut, 2 Tbls cocoa, 2 tsp cinnamon and pecans vs. walnuts.   Added a few pecans on the top.  Good Flavor and Very moist.

With a few variations, this is now my favorite recipe for banana bread. First thing, I used room temperature butter and creamed it with the sugar. Like others have mentioned, I mashed the bananas, and I used 3 very ripe bananas. I didn’t have walnuts on hand so instead I put in my food processor about 1/4 cup whole almonds, 1/8 cup old fashioned rolled oats, and 2 tbsp brown sugar. Pulsed that to crumb consistency and this was the topping of my banana bread. I covered the entire top of the batter with it so none was showing through. Baked mine for about 1 hour and 10 minutes. I think this is now the perfect recipe for banana bread and I’ll never use a different one!

Substituted white sugar for coconut sugar with the same ratio.  Threw in few Hershey cinnamon chips on the top just before putting it in the oven. The recipe is great!

truly a bop! only changes I made were mashing the bananas, omitting the nuts and vanilla(was out of both), and adding 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 t of ginger.

everyone who has tried it has raved about it!

it did turn out pretty light, but was delicious, so who cares! just make sure not to overcook the edges from trying to brown it up.

My Home Ec class picked 5 recipes for banana bread.  All recipes were strictly followed.  This was the winner!  since then, nuts added, substituted, chocolate chips added, substituted... This is a great basic recipe that can easily be played with.  We also played with putting in more banana.  Great choice!

I’ve received soo many compliments on this banana bread. I’ve used this recipe over 10 times now and I find mashing the bananas instead of slicing, leaving out the sour cream and reducing the flour by a little less than a cup gives it a moister consistency. I’ve tried many recipes and this has been the best so far I’ve found.

It’s a little sweeter than other versions of banana bread that I’ve made, but really flavorful and delicious!  I brought it to a brunch and was asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

I made this recipe several times with my 12 y.o. daughter.  It's very easy and flavorful.  I saw another reviewer say that she used cream cheese instead of sour cream.  We did that one time as well.  There was no perceivable difference in flavor. 

We skipped the nuts but added choc chips in one loaf.   If you do that, choose the mini morsels.  Otherwise they sink to the bottom of the batter while it is cooking.  Also, milk choc tasted better than dark choc.  

Love the versatility with this recipe!

As others have said - the flavor is good and the bread is nice and moist, but the sliced bananas are just not good! I think next time I’ll stick to the more traditional mashed banana form, as well as using creamed softened butter with sugar instead of melted, I think the bread turned out a little on the wet side because of this.

I used softened butter, and added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg as suggested by others. Use MASHED BANANAS! I do not recommend adding the walnuts, they were not loved. Most of my friends said they were "unnecessary".

Because I didn't have enough walnuts I used some chopped pecans as well, and some dark chocolate chunks. I diced my bananas rather than sliced them and made sure to use full fat sour cream. Might be too runny if I used a lower fat version. I had to leave it in my oven for 70 minutes but then it was perfect. I'm very happy with the results.

Fantastic and easy recipe! Turned out better than I expected! I used homemade apple butter because I was out of eggs. Still turned out great! It is very moist... but tasted amazing!

I love this recipe. I have made it as is and it's very good. This time I made a few changes because I didn't have sour cream and to adjust to my liking. I used 1.75c of flour, 1tsp baking soda, 1tsp baking powder, 1TB cinnamon and 1/2c Greek vanilla yogurt.  I added the baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon to the flour and used the yogurt in place of sour cream. I also added a pinch of vanilla bean paste to the vanilla and 1tsp of lemon juice. Baked at 325 for 1.15 hours. I think I'm sticking with these changes! My SO ate an entire loaf right out of the oven!!

1/4 c of oil and 1/4 cup of butter , half  up the sugar with white and brown.  pinch of cinnamon eggs and butter at room temp.
Puree 3 bananas with hand mixer, came out perfect with no horrible banana squiggly lines in bread.

The BEST!!!  Didn’t change anything but the type of nut that I had on hand (pecans).  Probably one of the best moist banana nut bread I’ve ever made.  Liked the Idea of banana slices.  Didn’t bake it as long as suggested - 10/15 minutes shorter.  A Keeper!!!

This is the best banana bread I have had.  I normally don't care for it because of the banana aftertaste.  This bread is light and has just enough banana flavor, and no aftertaste.  My neighbor who makes banana bread regularly also said it was excellent, so a double five star rating.

I just made this tonight, and it is the best banana bread I’ve ever had. I followed the recipe with a few exceptions, based on some other reviews. I added 1 tsp lemon juice with the vanilla. I used 1 3/4 cups flour, and used 1 tsp each of baking powder and baking soda. Instead of sour cream, I used 1/2 cup of honey flavored Greek yogurt. I also used 1 cup of mashed banana. The bread turned out dense and moist on the inside and had a wonderful crunchy crust on the outside. Love it!!

Made NO changes to this recipe and it turned out fantastic. I had four bananas, so I was able to double the recipe without it coming out any different than if I had made it with just two bananas. It is moist and flavorful. My sister and I have been having it for breakfast all week. Would highly recommend this recipe. It will be my "go to" recipe for banana bread from now on!

This is very good. i will change a few things next time though. I think I sliced my bananas too thick. i will probably chunky dice them next time for more even disbursement. I might tweak further if the next loaf is as dense as this one was.

Like the other reviews mentioned, I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them and it turned out great. As well I added 3 bananas instead of 2. It gave it more banana flavour. Lastly for a nut free option, exchange the nuts for chocolate chips,All these tweaks made this recipe amazing!!!

I used gluten-free flour that measures 'cup for cup', so it was a simple substitution. And I also let my 3 year old grandson help with sifting dry ingredients, peeling 3 bananas and prepping the baking dish. He was excited and in trying to keep everything on track with his help, I completely forgot to add the sour cream! I deliberately left out the nuts because of family preference. Between yesterday  evening and breakfast this morning, my  family devoured it! All declared it was the best banana bread ever. I plan to make it again with sour cream and next time get a photo before it's sliced.

This was the best banana bread I ever made.  I did make a couple of changes.  I have a gluten allergy so I made this with King arthur's cup for cup gluten free flour.  I was out of sour cream so I used yogurt.  My husband loved it.

I Loved this recipe! It will be the only one I use from now on. I followed the recipe as it’s written but used pecans & opted to make jumbo muffins instead of a loaf. They turned out great! I did spray the muffin liners with cooking spray & then sprinkled cinnamon & sugar in them before filling them about 2/3 full. Baked them at 350 they were done in about 23 minutes. Made 11.  Thanks to whoever suggested to sprinkle the pan with cinnamon & sugar It’s a great tip!

My changes: mashed the bananas and used 4 very ripe ones. Instead of sour cream, I used greek yogurt, added some almond extract drops and as I poured some chocolate chips and raisins, only used 3/4 cup of sugar. It was the fluffiest banana bread I ever made.

This is the best! I used two cups of ww flour plus one cup of bread flour and used raisins and chocolate chips. I also used less sugar because the chips and raisins were enough sweeteners.

I made no changes, but I did use Stevia and egg substitute. It turned out moist on the inside with a slight crunch on the outside. Use ripened bananas though. It’s a keeper.

Wonderfully moist! The only thing I will do next time (and YES there will be a next time) is the mash the bananas just a little bit after slicing them. There were really big bites of bananas and some without any at all. I prefer a more even flavor and texture. Otherwise, yummy as can be!

THIS BANANA BREAD IS A HIT! I have made this Bbread 2 times and moth have turned out amazing! I am not a fan of walnuts and I had peanuts laying around the first time I made this, so I swapped walnuts for peanuts and it was great! the second time I made this I added no nuts but, instead, added dark chocolate chips. this made it more of a dessert but such a good turn out!! will be using this recipe every time I make banana bread

This banana bread comes out AMAZING!
Immediately after my banana bread cooled I ate a piece and it was a bit too moist. However, the next day, it was PERFECT! I left the bread covered with foil on top of my stove and it somewhat dried out the moistness making it the BEST banana bread recipe. I will indeed be making this banana bread, again and again, to share with friends and family.

The best ever. I beat the bananas in with the batter. I did not have sour cream so I used Greek yogurt. I have made many really good recipes over the years but this is the best.

A very moist banana bread. I baked in a convection oven at 350 for 1 hour. It was still undone inside so I baked it for another 12 minutes with foil loosely covering the outside of the banana bread so it wouldn't burn. It came out perfect.
I also doubled the amount of pecans, (allergic to walnuts). It was just the right amount. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the advice of others and added 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp lemon juice.  I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar), and I mashed the bananas.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious and very moist.  The challenge is to not eat  too much!

Normally we have some about 20 minutes after it comes out of the oven, but this bread fell completely apart.  Was so moist we had to use a fork.  Once it was completely cool it was better but didn't hold together very well.  Have never used melted butter, so will go back to softened butter.

I'd like to thank Janet, for this amazingly delicious and flexible recipe! I've made this multiple times, used yogurt instead of sour cream,  added chia seeds, normally use 3 bananas. Whatever I do with this recipe, I can't screw it up, it's that easy and good! Thank you Janet!

I made a double batch using 2 cups of very ripe bananas. Once they were cooled, (about 2pm) the first loaf was half gone before dinner.
I did add about 2 tbsp of cinnamon and it added just the right spice note.

This was wonderful! I made a double batch so I ended up with 4 smaller loaves and about 14 muffins. I was afraid I overlooked the loaves but they are still extremely moist. I will forever use this recipe.

By far my favorite banana bread recipe, I did follow the instructions in the first comment made-and occasionally add hazelnuts or almonds and chocolate chips. Kids love it!

Best recipe ever !! and lives up to being  “moist” through and through. Made minor changes used half bread flour and half self raising flour , but otherwise followed exactly as recommended. Complimented by colleagues and neighbors, definitely a keeper .

I made a few changes. I used 2% fat plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream, added cinnamon and allspice and mashed the bananas. I also added a 2 scoops of protein powder. Had to use an extra banana for additional liquid for the protein powder. I baked mini muffins and 6 regular muffins instead of a loaf. They were done in about 20 - 25 minutes!

I made this banana bread recipe with a few tweaks and additions. This is a great recipe just the way it is but I love to put my own spin on things! For my first loaf I added a pint of blueberries. I tossed the blueberries lightly in flour before folding them into the mix. Turned out amazingly with the pop of blueberry. For the second loaf I added a half cup of unsweetened coconut flakes and it added a wonderful texture and light coconut taste. I had an extra overripe banana to use up so I added that to my second loaf as well.

Best banana bread I've ever made.  Mashed the bananas rather than slicing them.  Added 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce  to the mix.  Used chopped pecans instead of the walnuts.

Thank you for sharing your recipe. 
This has become my go to recipe for banana bread. 
I make it into small loves to give away as Christmas share gifts. 
It is so good and easy to make. Great way to use up those frozen bananas you have in the freezer. Going to make some today!

I wanted to try this recipe but I didn’t have the sour cream.  I did have a small container of ricotta cheese that I wanted to use up.  I also added some raisins.  It turned out great and got rave reviews from my coworkers.

Great tasting.  Would mash half the bananas since just folding  in the slices made the texture  weak in spots that had to much moisture.

I made the banana bread as is and it came out a little dry for my liking, it probably should have been cooked for 10 minutes less. My 2nd attempt I doctored it up a bit and it was a total slam dunk! First of all I substituted half of the white sugar for brown sugar, then I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them, and added the bananas and sour cream to the wet mixture instead of after adding the dry ingredients. Then I added some chocolate chips and boom, best moist banana bread I've ever had!

This was delicious and will now be my go to reciepe.  A friend of mine talked about using sour cream and it made it so moist!  I was running low on white sugar so I used half brown sugar and it was still fantastic.

I love this recipe for Banana Bread! I have been making it quite a bit lately by request from my granddaughter. She doesn’t like nuts so I omit those and I add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. My husband loves it that she loves banana bread too. Preparing it is very simple and I make sure I have the ingredients on hand.

This came out really good! 

Modifications:
1. I did not have sour cream, so substituted it with yogurt.
2. I keep my extremely ripe bananas in the freezer, so they were too mushy when thawed to slice.

Love this recipe.  It also makes amazing French toast. Add a little rum sauce instead of syrup and yummy.

Absolutely delicious! I didn’t have enough white sugar, so I used 1/2 white and the other half brown sugar. It tasted great and my kids and neighbors loved it.

I skip the sour cream every time I make it and it turns out wonderfully delicious.  Also tried it with Gluten Free Flour and it's just as delicious.  There is no difference in taste between regular and GF with the loaf.

I've made it twice and it's fabulous banana bread! I followed the recipe exactly--slicing the bananas instead of mashing them, which seemed odd to me. Oh, and as with all banana bread recipes, it took a lot longer to bake. I had to do the test with a toothpick 4 times before it was all done--but it wasn't overcooked at all!

I have always bought the box of  "Chiquita" banana bread mix  to make banana bread. I am not a fan of bananas themselves, but my husband is, but I like the bread.   I finally decided to get real and  try a "from scratch" recipe.  Wow!  What a difference.  I  mashed the bananas instead of slicing like another reviewer said, and my cook time was closer to 45 minutes.   Delish!!!

Making this for my second time tonight! I'm not usually a fan of banana bread but this was incredibly delicious and won over this non-banana person!  Tonight I added a cup of blueberries,  we will see how it is.

This banana bread has good flavor and is very moist. I make exactly as the recipe calls except I leave out the nuts. I normally tweak most recipes to my liking but this one is perfect, in my opinion. It never lasts long in my house and is usually eaten within 24 - 36 hours.

THE BEST!!! I followed the oft-repeated suggestion of mashing the bananas (1-1/2 cups), and baked at 325 for 1 hour 10 min, since I used a Pyrex loaf pan. But otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. I am NOT a baker, but I felt like an accomplished one after tasting this :-)))

I used plain Greek yogurt with 7% fat instead of sour cream.  I used approximately 3 bananas = 1 cup of mashed banana.  Creamed the butter with the sugar until light and fluffy instead of melting the butter.

I used 6 med-small overripe bananas that had been frozen. Thawed them and mashed them into the mix. Also, I split this into 2 loaf pans (maybe didn't need to) but with about 20 or so minutes left I reduced temp to 325. I really wanted to keep it moist and not overcooked. Came out great.

I’ve made this a couple of times now and this is my new go to banana bread recipe. I’ve added extra bananas just because I had them lying around and needed to use them up and it didn’t seem to alter the final results.

Loved it, but cut down the sugar by half and followed another reviewer's suggestion to add one teaspoon of baking powder. I split this into 2 loaf tins and they were done in 40 minutes.

This was so good!! I made a few small changes. I added a little bit of cinnamon and omitted the nuts for personal preference. I realized I didn’t have sour cream so I used mayo instead. I like smooth banana bread so I did mash the bananas rather than slice. When it was almost done baking I added a little brown sugar on top. Not convinced that that did anything special but it was worth a try :p It was so delicious!

I have made banana bread, using this recipe, a couple of times.  We love it! I even made it without the nuts once, because I didn't have any.  But, it turned out just as good!  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing!  Excellent recipe!

I made it, but hour was too long, and pulled it out 10 minutes early, it was still overdone.  Sour cream wasn't totally folded in, and showed up as white spots in the bread. Flavor even overdone still is good. Added touch of nutmeg, touch of fresh ground cinnamon.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! The banana bread always comes out moist and SUPER delicious! The only thing I change is to mash the bananas instead of slicing them! Give this recipe a try because you WILL NOT be disappointed!!!

I made this today as a Mother's Day gift for my mom and it was amazing! I used half white sugar and half brown sugar and added some strawberries to the banana mix. It was epic! I will make this bread every time I've got bananas and/or strawberries around!

WOW! I was in so much a hurry to make banana bread I didn't read reviews. This was so good as is! I didn't have to get the mixer out or make a mess and it was fantastic! I did smash the bananas, because like in banana pudding the sliced bananas just get funky, mushy and nasty,  and I didn't want that in my bread. I know you can add cinnamon, cloves, allspice...which I normally do, but just went for it today! I LOVE it so much I have to get it out of the house! Thank you!!!!

I left out the nuts. Next time I will mash the bananas to integrate it better but other than that it's a good recipe that produces a sweet bread that goes well with coffee. I will also try making icing for it to see how that tastes.

I made it exactly as per the recipe, but found that I had to bake it for an hour and twenty minutes before it was done, not just the hour that the recipe stated. The bread itself was outstanding! Not just the best I've ever made, (and I've made a lot of banana bread over the years) but the best I've ever tasted! This got rave reviews at my house!!

If you follow the recipe exactly as written, the sliced bananas are a very odd texture. It's almost more like a banana coffee cake. The flavor wasn't bad, but the recipe as written is just ok.

I made this for the first time today and it was fabulous.  I did have to make a few modifications for what I had on hand (plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream and chocolate chips in place of nuts) and I also took some of the other reviewers' advice and creamed the butter and sugar (used half white, half brown sugar), added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and mashed the bananas (I used 3 medium sized).  I also coated the pan with cinnamon and sugar before I put the batter in.  Popped it in the oven in a glass dish for an hour at 350 per the directions and it is AHHHHmazing.  I might have to make more with the bananas I have frozen in my freezer because I don't think this loaf is going to last the day!

It really is as good as the other reviewers say. I make it just as directed but sometimes I might as a little extra banana, or a little extra vanilla.

this has to be the best ever Banana Bread. I did not read recipe correctly and mashed the banana's  instead of slices. Turned out great! Grandkids ate half the loaf in about 20 minutes. Will make it again. Very moist and flavorful!

This easy recipe produces a delicious loaf of banana bread. I did use 3 very ripe mashed bananas; and left everything else as written. My hubby and I could not wait until it was completely cool to start cutting off pieces to eat.  It’s delightfully crusty on the outside and dense and decadent on the inside. I’ll be making this again soon!

I've made this recipe a lot of times. It is good as written with the addition of mashing the bananas.  We put ours in a big ziploc bag and the kids squish them, then I can easily squeeze it  out like toothpaste.  

Due to different times of being out of this or that ingredient, here are the changes we like the best.  Substituting half the regular sugar for brown sugar and using chocolate chips(mini work best) or a mix of chocolate and peanut butter chips instead of the nuts.   

We've also replaced the sour cream with banana flavored yogurt sometimes or even an egg with some mayo if we were short eggs. Everything has worked out well. It all depends on what we have in our cupboard.

I had MANY MANY bad bananas, so I ended up tripling this recipe. I used the suggestion that someone else provided (the 1 tsp of lemon juice per  tbsp of vanilla) and I added a healthy splash of cinnamon into the batter (I also didn't slice the bananas, I mashed them, and it turned more battery in consistency)
I also greased the pans with a cinnamon/sugar/butter mix which gave them a neat crunch and folded in some chocolate chips.

Followed recipe exactly as posted (except I mashed the bananas instead of just slicing them) and it turned out perfect!!! My whole family loved it and it was easy to make. I’ll definitely be making this at least once a month.

Followed the recipe except that I cut the salt in half. I also added all of the wet ingredients together first and then added the flour mixture instead of folding it in. Best banana bread ever!

I follow the recipe exactly. I leave out walnuts because of an allergy but I replace with chocolate chips and it’s outstanding! I always get compliments on this bread. Mine usually cooks about 63 minutes for full done-ness.

I made sure to add a bit more banana and I mashed them instead of slicing.  I like for the flavor to be spread throughout the bread.  Family loved it for breakfast!

I made this as written and it was a solid 5+ stars, but I read many reviews and decided with a little tweaking it could be 10 stars.  
The changes I made were to mash the bananas to make 1 cup, and I used 1/2 white and 1/2 light brown sugar.  I added 1tsp lemon juice and also added 1tsp of baking powder and upped the flour to 1  3/4c.   I love the walnuts in it but my Mom has a hard time chewing them so sometimes when I make it I grind the nuts up fine.  That way you get the walnut flavor without the chunks.  I prefer it with chunks but it tastes great either way.  Whichever way you decide to make it, this is THE best banana bread you will ever make.  I cook more than I bake but this is one recipe I make consistently.

Love this recipe!   I have made several times (in the last month!).    I've since added chia seeds, flax seeds (1T of each) to add some nutrition and less guilt!  Also about 1/4 cup of mini choc chips, 1/4 cup of applesauce and about a tablespoon of coconut!    My husband is hiding the bananas, instead of eating them!

I love banana nut bread and thought I'd try my hand with  making it.  I made two loafs I used a slightly  smaller container the trick is to not fill it all the way, half way works best..  and plus u can make two and keep one all to your self..  ?? I brought it to work and the baking ladies loved it and you know you did great when a fellow Baker compliments you..  needless to say first time maker and it turned out great!!!!!

The batter is the best banana batter I have ever tasted!!  
I followed it to the "T" and it's good, but not the best.   I would make it again.  The batter was really good.  Super moist, I added extra walnuts and next time I will add a couple of ingredients for more flavor.  Overall, it is a good recipe and I  will keep this recipe.

This is hands down my favorite banana bread recipe. It comes out moist, but not too dense, every single time. My kids love it most with some dark chocolate chips added to the batter.

So moist and tender! Better than Bob Evans. I mixed the wet ingredients - including smushing the bananas, then added the dry ones, tossed it in the bread machine and went on my way. Came back to an amazing loaf of sweet bread!

Nice easy recipe.  Made as written.  Turned out well but I do highly recommend mashing the bananas instead of using slices.
I will be making again with above change.

I pretty much followed the recipe but tweaked slight based on reviews - I smashed the bananas, used greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and used extra crushed walnuts.  Also, I only baked for 50 minutes and am glad I did as it was perfectly cooked and any longer would have been dry.

This was my first time making banana bread and it came out great! I had 3 over-ripe bananas (the skins were practically all black)  and didn't want them to go to waste. My husband can't eat nuts so I omitted them and used an extra banana. I mashed the bananas before I folded them into the mixture and the bread came out super moist. I would definitely make this again! (Next time I'm going to try putting in a little cinnamon)

Yummy! 4 stars because I think slicing the bananas is wrong. I only had 2 overripe bananas, and it was still good (would have been even better with a couple more). I added 1 tsp of lemon juice (per another review), 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, about a 1/4 cup of sour cream, a little more flour, and also did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugars. Did not melt butter (just creamed with sugar) and mashed those bananas! Great base recipe.

Mashed the bananas, added cinnamon, and substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream.  It was delish and everyone at work liked it! Not too sweet, just right.

I doubled the recipe to fit in a bundt pan. Substituted a 1/2 c brown sugar for just a half a cup of the 2 c regular sugar (1/2 c brown + 1 1/2 Sugar) , 2 teaspoons of baking power instead of baking soda, 1 stick of butter & 1/2 c Vegetable oil for the shortening. Mixed by hand until combined not to overdo like electric beaters can. Baked for about an hour at 350. Let cool 15-20 minutes. Omitted the nuts and added a cream cheese glaze to the finished bundt! Came out fantastic!

I have made this recipe several times.  I have never used sliced bananas.  I would never dream of not mashing.  I love the sour cream.  I probably never make it exactly the same way.  I do use cinnamon and sugar in the bread  and on top.  Too much on the sides and bottom make it too sticky.  My family enjoys chocolate chips so add them to half of the loaves I make.  I think butter almost melted but not completely works best.

This recipe is so easy - one bowl and stir ingredients in  order listed. After adding the mix to loaf pan I added a sliced banana to the top of the batter and sprinkled cinnamon sugar liberally over it. I did mash, not slice, the two bananas in the batter.  
This bread is so moist and tender. What a treat for so little effort.

Instead of slicing the bananas I mashed them, and added 1/2 of chocolate chips with the walnuts. It also came out mushy so I baked for an extra 10 minutes. Came out perfect after. Otherwise great recipe.

Well, I can see why its a 5 star recipe after over 5,000 reviews!  After seeing it in the latest Allrecipes magazine, I was anxious to try it...and...guess what?!?  I just happened to have exactly 3 ripe bananas!  It turned out delicious!!!!  I couldn't restrain myself, as soon as the 10 minute cooling period was up I just had to cut off a slice.  Of course a slathering of butter and a cup of coffee to go with it.  Just a little bit of heaven!!!!!!!  Used the mashed bananas instead of sliced, but put sliced on top just as the picture showed.  Also thanks to Summer Lindsay who suggested dusting cinnamon and sugar to the pan after greasing them....will do this from now on.  Other than that...to recipe!  Special thanks to vjonsson for a winning recipe!!!!

I love this recipe.  I had made two loaves so far and making a third one all within a week time.  I made one for us, one for my sister-in-law whom craved how wonderful it was! She and her family loved it!; and I am making another one for a friend of ours.  This recipe is very easy to follow and easy to make.  I just watch the video and follow the instructions.  I use a Copper Chef loaf pan ( in which I do not have to spray or flour) and I have to bake it an extra 10 minutes. The house smells wonderful when baking.  The bread comes out excellent. I let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes and then take it out and cool it on a cooling rack for another 30-45 minutes.  My wife and I absolutely love it and we have a slice (or two) in the morning along with our freshly ground whole bean Don Francisco's French Roast/Dark Roast coffee.  It is just mmm, mmm good. 
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe on here. I give it a five out of five.

Added an extra banana and 1 tsp cinnamon, had to use plain fat free greek yogurt instead of sour cream, had to use chopped pecans instead of walnuts, and brown sugar instead of white.  Guess I should have checked my pantry before I started making this recipe!!  I usually never make this many substitutions and then write a review.  Absolutely delicious!  Moist and dense, just as it should be.

I'd bake it for 40 min and recheck it. I was dumb and used a pan about 3" x 7.5" instead of the size the recipe called for. I use 1/2 a cup less sugar (this is sickeningly sweet if full strength 1.5 cups of sugar). I use chocolate chips instead of walnuts.

Stellar, but need to follow recommendations of other reviewers to make it so.
1. Creamed softened butter and sugar (used only 125g sugar, compared to 200g in recipe as did not want overly sweet) with hand mixer for 1-2 minutes 
2. Beat wet ingredients (sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla) 1 minutes with whisk (could use mixer for 15-30 seconds) 
3. Added 1 tsp (5g) baking powder
4. Folded in chopped semi-sweet chocolate, approx. 1/4 cup
5. Pureed bananas for 1 cup total 

Cupcakes came out light but rich. Cake a bit dense, because I cooked for only 50 minutes. Definitely needs full 60 minutes. I used dark pans.

Great recipe, didn't have sour cream but substituting the same a mount of plain Greek yogurt with half a teaspoon of lemon juice did the trick. Adding a small layer of melted dark chocolate on top adds a lil extra to it too

I’ve used several recipes for banana bread but this is by far our favorite! It was moist and made a good sized loaf. Cut it in half and froze the other half.

I made some adjustments that I read in a previous comment and used 1 3/4 c of flour, 1 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of baking soda, 1 tsp of lemon juice, 2 tsp of vanilla, and used 1 cup of mashed bananas which were 3 bananas used by me...followed the recipe for all the rest. Ohhh I used soft butter not melted...

This got a low rating only because of my personal preference.  It is very moist.  It is very flavorful.  It is very easy to make.  The problem that I have with it is that it's more like banana cake than it is banana bread.  I like my banana bread to be a little denser.  If you like light and fluffy bread, then this is definitely the recipe for you.

This was "meh" for my family. We made it as muffins, and they were not dense like I expect banana bread to be. Might have been my issue as I used a mixer to cream softened butter and sugar? Also smashed our bananas instead of slicing. It was fine, but lacked an intense banana or any other flavor - just a bit sweet, a bit banana-y, but nothing special.

I have made this recipe many times. It always turns out so GREAT! It is very moist. I do not put walnuts because the kids don't like them and I lightly mash the bananas with a fork instead of slicing them. Today, I added fresh blueberries. That loaf is still in the oven but I know it will be delicious. This is the BEST banana bread recipe I've ever had!

Just made the banana bread and had some right out of the oven with butter.  It was ok, a tad bland even though I added cinnamon.  Will wait to see if has more flavor after it cools. Probably will not use this recipe again.

This recipe did not work for me.  I followed the recipe.  I see the video makes a change from the printed recipe.  The printed recipe calls for "sliced" bananas but the video mashes them.  It probably would improve the recipe if they were mashed.  In my case,  the loaf would not come out of the pan and the sliced bananas gave it a slimy kind of texture and it did not age well.  I may try it again mashing the bananas as I love sour cream coffee cake but will not slice the bananas and will also flour the pan.

My very first time making banana bread. I just added a bit of lemon juice (about a teaspoon). Everyone at work went crazy over it. Very moist and great banana flavor. I used really ripe bananas (2 of them) which equaled to the 1 cup. I’m definitely making this from now on. Also I baked it for the 60 minutes.

I make this all the time.  It has never failed me. Only variations...I use butter flavored Crisco instead of butter.  I make this in my stand mixer so I mash the bananas before adding them in. It’s definitely my “go to” recipe   I double it and can get three loaves. ( I use the disposable foil bread pans because of easy release from the pan).  You’re gonna love this stuff!!!

Came out moist and tasty. I mashed the banana and thought that I would try substituting a little brown sugar for some of the white sugar and also added a dash of cinnamon.  I'm sure this would be great without any modification.

This is hands down the BEST banana bread recipe I've found! Only change made was to cream the butter and sugar, instead of using melted butter. This recipe is on permanent rotation in our home from now on!  Firm, moist, and oh so flavorful! Added 1/2 cup chocolate chips instead of nuts, because that's what my family prefers. Thank you for this great recipe!

I've never had banana bread before but my family was begging me to make some (especially since they can't bake to save their lives) so I hunted for a recipe and came across this one. I'm not one for dry goodies and let me tell you, this is THE moistest, most delicious thing I've ever tried. This is my first banana bread, and will be the ONLY banana bread I eat. How can there be one even remotely as good as this one?

Awesomely moist Banana Bread! Added a strudel topping of brown sugar, melted butter and pecans. Suggest doubling the original recipe and freezing a loaf for unexpected company.

Made this recipe tonight. 3 bananas wouldn't be bad, if you - like me, would like more banana flavor. If you add an extra banana, I guess you might need less sour cream and oil.

Can anyone recommend a way to keep the edges of the bread from browning too fast? Mine got a little burnt - more than I would have liked - and yet, the center remained really raw. (Baked for a few more minutes and it was cooked through!)

Like others said, I recommend mashing the bananas as opposed to sliced. The more overripe they are, the easier they will blend in with your other wet ingredients. 

:)

Super delicious. I substituted nonfat Greek yogurt for the sour cream as that’s what I had in hand. Bread was moist and flavorful. Definitely adding this to the collection.

This recipe was awesome! Had to do minor revisions but otherwise I’m giving it a 2 thumbs up. My revisions include: not putting walnuts (hubby wants plain bread), adding a little bit of brown sugar to complete the 1cup of sugar. Then mashing up 2 1/2 medium bananas and adding a drizzle of honey while i mashed the bananas. Cooking time was only 50minutes otherwise it would have burned if I did the 60mins. Will definitely bake this again

Love this banana bread recipe!  Baked it almost as is, only mashed my really ripe bananas instead.  Used 2 bananas, about 240 grams.  I used muffin pans because I wanted to bake some with chocolate chips and some with toasted nuts.  Baked them at 350 for about 20-25 mins.  Yield 20 muffins.

I did make changes.  I didn't slice the bananas I mashed them instead and I only had pecans so I used those I also used banana extract instead of vanilla. My daughter loves it.

Super easy to make and so good. I used 3 bananas instead of 2 and did not use any nuts. I paired it with a maple butter recipe I got from a Bon Appetit.

This banana bread is AMAZING!! It’s the only one I will ever use. People are always begging me to make them some! The ONLY thing I do is mash the bananas instead of slice, but no big deal. It’s fantastic!

After awhile, you can read recipes and know how they'll turn out. So, I did agree with naples34102 and creamed the butter/sugar, and used 1 tsp of both baking soda and baking powder. I tried her suggestion of 1-3/4 c. of flour, but it was just a little too dry. Next time, I'm going to use 1-1/2 c. of flour as is in the original recipe. I omitted the lemon juice without any negative effect.

I also liked TraceAddict's suggestion of adding 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp of ground cloves. I didn't add chocolate chips as she also suggested as I've tried this in the past and it has never worked for me. Chocolate is wonderful, but shouldn't be used as a fix up: it diminishes both the chocolate and the primary recipe.

I happen to like pecans, so I used these instead of walnuts.

The sides were a bit too dry, so I'll next time use my favorite fix-up for this: take not-overripe banana slices lightly dredged in turbinado sugar and line the edges. It adds a tremendous up-kick to banana bread. Delicious.

Was an excellent recipe. Have made it several times and passed it out to friends who have just loved it.  It actually allowed me to use the sour cream in other recipes and more success.

I have made this many many times and always mix the bananas in with the sugar as others mentioned. Last time, I threw in some pecan pieces and heath chips that I had from my holiday baking and ooh yum! Great banana bread! You can change it up with additions, but it's  great without any changes. I've also frosted with cream cheese frosting...sinfully good...

I am typically not a fan of banana bread; ocassionally I'll have some that is very good. My boyfriend, however, loves it. I tried this recipe intending that he would eat most of it and then I actually ate more than he did! The only change I made was adding cinnamon into the batter and on top before baking it. The recipe did make for a pretty sweet bread but it was not overwhelming. I may adjust the sugar measurements in the future just to see how it tastes with less sweetener. But I will definitely be making this recipe again for us and for family

He needs the yogurt for his stomach but wont eat it so i sneaked it in and it worked!  Thanks for placing your recipe  it make him want to eat   thankyou thankyou    I'm making another loaf as we speak

This is my all time favorite  recipe . Sooooo easy. I like that you melt the butter instead of softening it. Only extras are sour cream and nuts. My husband eats almost the whole loaf himself.
Enjoy!

Great Amazing and very tasty! Sour Cream is making the bread so fluffy and tender! Cooking it now for the second time and looking for the next one. Thanks a lot for the recipe.
By the way. I use the fork for the bananas mashing them into the puree and also break walnuts into small and bigger chunks.

I saw this recipe right after the holidays and made it last month. I actually made it twice already. The first one was a little tough even after following the instructions to the tee. The second time, it was much better and received compliments. I decreased the temperature down to 345 degrees and baked it for 55 minutes. It seemed to work better and it came out better.  Thank you for sharing!!

Best banana bread ever! I feel kind of bad because I’ve use my mother-in-law‘s recipe for years. The only thing I would do to this recipe, is cream the sour cream in with the rest of the liquid ingredients. Also are used disposable aluminum pans.  8 1/2“ x 3 7/8” x 2 1/2”.. I got four loaves. Fantastic!

The only reason I didn't give this five stars was because it was impossible to slice into pieces without it falling apart. We couldn't even butter it. I had planned on taking some to work, but just trying to lift the slices was impossible without it falling apart. Any suggestions?

Wonderful recipe, I didn't change the ingredients though I did cream the butter and sugar and mashed overripe bananas instead of using sliced and it came out delicious! Thank you for this great recipe, will make it again for sure.

Made this once. It was very good. I’m going to try oats instead of flour next time and add a touch of cinnamon. I will also use margarine instead of butter. I’m dieting so I’m trying to reduce the points in the recipe. I used no fat plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream as well. Very pleased with how it turned out. It is moved to first place in the many banana bread recipes I have tried.

Great recipe. I used 3 bananas instead of 2, mashed them and added a dash of cinnamon. Used half wheat flour to make it a tad healthier. I baked the bread in the Pampered Chef brownie pan - took less time to cook and ensured crispy edges. Be careful-this recipe is addictive! Recommended!

I did not change anything.   The recipe was so easy and the results were wonderful.   No time to take a photo - it was gone before I knew it.   Will have to make more than one loaf next time.

This recipe is excellent and the bread does not last long before it is gobbled up by my house of my husband and 3 boys 6,4, and 2! I love eating this with yoghurt! I have not yet used the walnuts for it but I have done pecans and almonds as they were what I had on hand. Also, instead of sour cream I use yoghurt instead (doesn't matter what kind). Sometimes I may throw in a handful of chocolate chips too if I feel like it. Make sure to mash the bananas all up rather than just slicing them because that makes a huge difference. I will continue making this, thanks!

I doubled recipe the first time I made it and it is so delicious. I followed a hint that one of the reviewers provided, I added lemon juice with the vanilla and also added a teaspoon of baking powder. Next time I would add lemon or orange zest. I feel that almost any fruit could be added.

Loved how moist it came out. Really easy to make and fun.
It's best to use really ripe bananas.  Next time I'll use less sugar too.

An amazing recipe so easy to make! Even easier than any other cookies and no hard work without any mixer. 
Since my oven is electric and tends to be weeker than the other ovens, I added additional 15 minutes to the baking time and it came out perfect! 
So moist inside and crunchy hard on the outside.

I purposely buy too many bananas so i have to make this recipe.  Wait until the bananas start getting a little brown then mash 'em up good. Sprinkle a little more sugar on the top and this is heavenly!

Very Good! So moist and delicious.  I didn't have sour cream so I substituted with my left over Greek yogurt. I also added some nutmeg and ground cloves. The house smelled so good during baking. Thank you!

As suggested by other users, I didn't melt the butter. I creamed it with the sugar, and I smashed the bananas. Otherwise, this recipe is amazing as it is.

this is great!  second time i made it i did, used 3 eggs and less sugar;still great. third time i went too far..applesauce in lieu of 1/2 the butter, stevia in lieu of sugar, greek yogurt in lieu of sour cream... texture was STILL great but less flavor, a little bitter. I'm going back to Janet's original!

This makes a very moist and flavorful banana bread. I wasn't sure about the sour cream, but it's a great addition.  I will make again, but may add a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon--a tip I learned from similar recipe.

It was amazing. I followed a few other recommendations from some reviewers and it was perfect.  I mashed the bananas, creamed the soft butter with the sugar, added 1 tsp of lemon juice with the vanilla, used 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of baking soda, used 1 3/4 c flour and I used at least 1 cup of mashed bananas. Everyone loved it!

I made this yesterday and it is very moist and very good.  I would have liked it a little sweeter so I'd probably add another 1/4 cup sugar and even a bit of cinnamon.  I've made many banana breads through the years and this one is delicious.

Today,2/8/19, is my 3rd time baking this.  The only changes I make for absolute perfection 1 3/4 cup flour, 1 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup sour cream & 1/4 cup greek yogurt. Third time is the charm. Oh, and I mashed the bananas.

Wonderful, light banana bread recipe! Used room temperature eggs and butter, and took advice of others with squeeze of lemon juice, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 3/4 c flour, 1 c mashed bananas.  Makes 2 loafs, pans prepped w/salted butter and cinnamon sugar dusting. Subbed nuts w/ chocolate chips (dusted w flour so they don't sink). Have pans ready and put in oven right away, to keep batter light and fluffy!

My new “go to” banana bread recipe. After reading the reviews the only change I made was to mash the bananas and add exactly one cup. Perfect moist banana bread after 60 minutes in my oven.

I used softened butter as opposed to melted butter and used 1 cup of mashed banana's in this recipe.  The banana's I used were from the freezer, so I let them thaw and tore the ends off and squeezed the contents into a measuring container.  I then used a wafflehead masher to hold the softened banana's in the bottom of the measuring cup and turned it upside down to drain out the excess water from the softening banana's.  Cooked for 65min and turned out perfect! Best banana bread I ever ate.

We were snowed in so I had to make due with what we had...bread flour instead of all purpose flour and non-fat greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  Amazing!

I loved it.  I will make this as often as I can.  My bananas weren't quite ripe so I looked up how to ripen them quickly in the oven.  It worked but I think nicely ripened bananas would have made this taste even better than it already did.

Absolutely the Best ever Banana Bread!!! and required no mixer. Perfect like it is. I have made it many times and everyone wanted more!! The last few times I added a tablespoon on cocoa but its not necessary Then added some semi sweet chocolate chips but not too many.  Mine baked at 50 minutes at out higher altitude.  Best recipe ever!!

This is the perfect banana bread recipe.  However, I used 3 med/large VERY RIPE bananas and I coarsely mashed them instead of slicing.  I omitted nuts.  Was told by someone it was the best banana bread they'd ever tried. Thank you Janet, wherever you are!

We love this recipe.  I did add 1 teaspoon lemon juice in with the bananas.  Used three small bananas which added the perfect amount of banana flavor.  Wonderful flavor.  Family loved it so much that I made 2 batches every week for several weeks!

It was very simple, I used some left over Pecans I had instead of walnuts and I had an xtra banana. It is very moist and not really heavy on the sugar or Banana flavor. I love it and will make it again. I also shared some with my mother in law.

I made this as written except I mashed the bananas,( I have never seen a recipe for banana bread that calls for "sliced" bananas it doesnt even sound like it would turn out ) At anyrate this was delicious very moist. I will be making it again.

Excellent banana bread. Have made it dozens of times and it’s perfect each time. I follow the recipe, but I mash my bananas. I adjust the oven temperature to 325 becays3

Great recipe. I decided to take other reviewers advice and smash the bananas instead of leaving them in slices. I did use almost 2 cups of smashed bananas, and I didn’t have sour cream so I used cream cheese which worked out great. It took about 70 minutes to cook. I will be making this again.

I made this as directed, except I used softened butter and mashed bananas. It is delicious! The only problem I had was with the cook time. I usually have to bake things longer than recommended in my oven, but this was ready to come out when I checked it at 47 minutes.

LOVE this bread! I've made it several ways, but my favorite is to replace the sour cream with Greek yogurt, either vanilla or coconut.

The sour cream really makes this. My 92 year old mother said it was “the best thing I’ve ever eaten”. I didn’t have walnuts on hand but I had some simple toasted pecans. It was delicious but since I prefer walnuts in banana bread I’ll go buy some and make this again in a couple days because my mom seems to be eating all of this loaf. ??

This banana bread is delicious.  I did not have walnuts but used pecans instead.  I also added 1/4 cup of maple syrup and used 3/4 of sugar.  I'll be making it again.

Between the moisture from the bananas and the sour cream, it was REALLY wet at first. We let it sit on the cooling rack overnight and it's MUCH better. Might tweak the amount of sour cream next time but that's just me. I'm definitely using this recipe from now on!

I make this banana bread once a week, and the key ingredient is the addition of sour cream.  Stays moist for days!  I saw this recipe and just had to comment!  Besides, my Mother's name is Janet.  Happy baking!

Twas great just as it was. 2nd batch I modified exchanging 1 cup of sugar for brown.  And a half cup of applesauce for the same  amount of sour cream and added a bit more spice[s], cinnamon, ginger, mace and cardamom. Everyone that had some exclaimed over it. Will make it again.

This is a wonderfully moist and flavourful banana bread.  I doubled the recipe and used 5 lightly mashed bananas, leaving some nice chunks. (it made 2 cups of mashed bananas)  I omitted the nuts because I didn't have any.  Otherwise I made it exactly as written.  It's really good and I will definitely make it again.

family loved this recipe.  I creamed the butter with the sugar (instead of melting it), also sifted the flour, baking soda and salt together.  And I mashed 3 medium bananas into it instead of 2 sliced bananas.  Super good.

My first attempt at banana bread and it turned out great. Can’t believe how easy it is to make, I made a second one before I finished eating the first one lol...the only change I made was to use natural cane sugar instead of processed white sugar.

SO good. The sour cream makes it incredible. Like the other reviewers, i mashed the banana. I used room temperature butter (not melted) and eggs. I didnt have walnuts and i think they're gross anyway so i didnt use them. Halved the sugar and used raw instead of white. I also added a bunch of cinnamon, a bit of nutmeg, and a dash of cloves, because whats the point in conquering the world for the spice trade if we're not even going to season our food. 1hr cooking was too short, i pulled it out at 1hr10 and it was slightly underdone but ended up fine after resting. I eyeballed the ingredients and it still turned out perfect. Would be good with choc chips or raspberries/blueberries too.

This came out amazing! Absolutely delicious! I’m always looking for different banana bread variations and this was the first time I saw a recipe with sour cream. I’m so glad I tried it! I made muffins instead of a loaf and cooked it for 35-40 minutes. I also mashed the bananas :)

I changed to 1tsp baking powder and 1tsp baking soda. Coated the sides of pan with sugar, and added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips instead of walnuts. Most moist banana bread I ever had! So delicious!!

We love this recipe!  I did make a few changes; I mashed the bananas, added a smidge of cinnamon, and only used 2/3 - 3/4 cup sugar.  Tastes great!

It was a big hit! I had walnuts this time and loaded the batter generously with chopped walnuts. The loaf was consumed by the three of us ( plus last bites for Duffy) within 48 hours.

Followed this person's review and it was perfect : "With minor variations this is the recipe I've been making for 40 years. It originally came from a home ec teacher and it is beyond awesome. The differences are, first, that I cream the softened butter with the sugar (not melted). I add 1 tsp. lemon juice with the vanilla, and use 1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder, and 1-3/4 c. flour. Finally, regardless of how many bananas are used it should equal 1 cup. You will never find a better banana bread, and over the course of 40 years, I've never heard differently. Edited 8/17/09: My original 4/14/08 review should have indicated that I mash the bananas, not slice them."

This recipe does not work.  I have made it now  2 times and every time I get (see the picture attached).    I live in Denver, is there something in your recipe that should compensate for this/  I am an engineer and know how to follow directions and I keep getting this fallen mess.  Please advise or take it down.

Thank you

As the bananas become overripe I make banana bread. I use organic flowers & sugars mostly- depends on what is on hand but- sometimes I had taken my ear off the bell- adding the sour cream assures the bread is moist assuring that it remains rich and full of banana flavor. I had forgotten my great Aunts story of sour cream- living to over 100 is common in my family- or was- recipes connect me to a rich family heritage-pun intended.

Delicious banana bread, followed the other reviewers' adjustments, creaming softened butter and sugar together, I also left out the walnuts, and used yoghurt instead of sour cream (I didn't have any on hand), and it turned out perfectly. Nice and moist, with lots of banana flavour.

Went together very easy, Was done right at 60 minutes as recipe says. I added mini semi sweet chocolate chips as one reviewer said and lightly mashed the bananas as another reviewer suggested and it taste awesome. I was skeptical about the sour cream and pleasantly surprised

This is amazing! I mash the bananas before adding them into the mix. I've made this with muffins too, and bake for 14 minutes, they are just as delicious as the bread!! Thank you for such a great recipe.

We've been making this recipe for years and have gotten many compliments.  This recipe literally takes 7 minutes to prepare (I've timed it).  My wife mixes the dry ingredients and I do the wet.  I always thought Janet made a mistake about slicing the bananas, so we've always mashed them.  By the way, if we have medium size bananas, we always throw in three.  We divide the mixture into two medium sized bread pans and bake for 45 minutes at 350.  Turns out perfectly every time.  Fast, easy, and delicious.  Try it!  Better yet, send me your address and I'll send you some.  We keep several in the freezer to give away or for unexpected guests. ??  Every now and again add chocolate chips.  I still like it just the way it is.  Thanks Janet for the quick easy recipe.  We always give you credit, and have referred folks to this page many times.

Awesome recipe that I will definitely make again.  I LOVE nuts and next time may use more than this recipe calls for.  I used Pecans instead of Walnuts.

This is the best banana bread!  I’ve made it several times and it always comes out great.  I add a little cinnamon in mine just as another layer of flavor.

This was my first experience with baking banana bread and it turned out delicious! I doubled the recipe and added chocolate chips, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. It resulted in a moist, almost pudding-like consistency that is addictive. Having a hard time staying away from it!

Every single person that has tried this after I make it tells me it’s the best they’ve ever had! I mash my bananas, and use a mini loaf pan that I’ve coated with cinnamon and sugar. Makes for a nice, sweet, crunchy edge on the top of the personal-sized loaves.

This would have been a good recipe, but slicing the bananas makes horrible gross squishy spots. If you purée or mash the bananas it would probably be good, but I was turned off enough from the texture that I will not be making this again.

I skipped the sour cream, just mixed in a splash of almond milk. It came out very good! I don't usually break from recipes, I follow them to the t, but this time I had no sour cream so I went with what I had.

Delicious moist bread! I use pecans instead of walnuts and cover the baked, cooled bread with cinnamon and sugar, like what grandma sprinkled on your toast. I have a shaker with my mixed grannies sugar , just like she did. I have froze it to keep the extra loaves, it is still excellent.

I used fresh cream instead of sour cream and almonds instead of walnuts. Also added seeds into the batter and on top. Sliced the banana from top to bottom, and laid both slices on the cake on top.

Coming from Northeast Asia, I am used to dessert with less sugar. I followed this recipe except for reducing sugar by a third and it turned out great. I saw another recipe which called for adding oatmeal, and thought that it would be a good idea to incorporate it next time.

THE BEST EVER! I had Thanksgiving brunch at my place and this recipe was a hit! Instead of using a loaf pan, I made muffins. Everyone complimented how moist the muffins were.  I baked the night before because I had a lot of cooking to do Thanksgiving morning. A sure hit!

This is my family's favorite and I've made it for Thanksgiving and Christmas for 2 years now - will be 3 this week.  I did not change any ingredients.  Only variation is I creamed butter and sugar together, and I mashed the bananas like I have for any other bread.  This one is the best though!

Very good banana bread. My oven bakes hot, so I had to play with the temperature.  I didn’t have sour cream, so I substituted with 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt—vanilla.  I omitted the walnut, because my daughter doesn’t like nuts   I had 3 over ripe bananas, so all 3 were used. The bread is very dense and therefore very filling.

I love this banana bread it is so flavorful and moist.  Also, very easy to make.  It was really a quick decision because I wanted to use bananas that were getting over ripe, and I had all the ingredients in the house so why not. The only thing I would change is I will mash the bananas next time.  I didn’t care for the look of the bananas after they were baked sliced.   I’m so glad I made this recipe!  I’ll be making this again!  This will make the family cook book.

Really good.  Not super sweet, to me, so a nice bread because when I want banana bread I get disappointed when it tastes like cake.  I missed a bit of spice, however.  A little nutmeg or cinnamon would have taken it over the top for me.  I'll adjust next time.  Will definitely make again.

I followed a reviewer's advice and creamed the butter with the sugar first and mashed the bananas. I also, as suggested used 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of baking soda. It was moist and delicious!

This banana bread is absolutely perfect, no changes needed!  A couple of tips though, do not use a mixer and when you stir in the bananas, gently smash them into the mix.  Mmmmm! Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent recipe! I baked it in a dark coated pan and even though I lowered the temp. to 325 degrees, it came out a bit dark....no fault of the recipe....I just need to get some lighter colored aluminum pans for my next batch!

This has been my go to recipe for banana bread for at least three years now.  I don't alter the recipe in any way.  Always turns out really good. The sour cream makes it super moist. My husband and kids love it,  and I bring it to work,  and holiday parties often.

I made this twice in 2 weeks. I would give it 5 stars except that I modified it. I pureed the bananas in with the hand mixer and added 1 tsp cinnamon. Everything else the same and delicious!

I added 1ysp baking soda and 1/4tsp cinnamon but all else was as written. Came out dense and cake like. I also mashed the bananas and the bread has a nice banana flavor. Not over powering at all. Great banana bread!

OUTSTANDING!!!!! Quick & easy to make - stir by hand. Very moist & delicious. I ran out of sour cream so I used vanilla Light & Fit Greek yogurt & worked wonderfully. Def. Keeper. BTW, the bananas are mashed not sliced in the video, like usual.

Amazingly moist and the best banana bread I've ever made or eaten. The family loves it and we always have a loaf around now. I make double batches each time, resulting in two loafs and a dozen muffins, which if i'm lucky, they might last the week! We have passed this recipe on to several family members to enjoy as well. Wouldn't change a thing. We do use finely ground pecans, as we always have a few frozen bags of pecans around for a healthy snack. Our teenager doesn't like the larger chunks of nuts, but loves the finely ground pecans.  A perfect way to use up those brown bananas that no one will eat.

I did omit the nuts due to my daughters allergy to them but it  didn't take anything away from the rich, moist flavor.

Very good bread. Added touch of sour cream really makes it moist.  I grow my own bananas from my trees here in Florida.

I made this according to the recipe with one small change: I added a dash of cinnamon and about 1/8 tsp nutmeg. I had 3 small-ish bananas which, when mashed, equaled one cup. It turned out moist and delicious — will definitely make this again.

While this is very moist, I found it to have less banana flavor than I expected. Next time I make it I will use more bananas. I altered the recipe to add another 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/3 c mini chocolate chips and 1/3 c finely chopped macadamia nuts.  It took much longer to cook than the listed time, about 15 min. It was a hit at my house! I serve it with a spread that is 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 c softened butter, 1 pkg of cream cheese and 1/4 c honey (cream the cheese and then add butter to prevent it from being chunky).

First time making bread and it came out good. So far I’ve made it 4 times, and two times it came out perfectly and two times it was dry and horrible and I don’t know why, same ingredients and proportions.

I get requests all the time for this bread. The recipe is wonderful but I do add a few things. I love the taste of golden raisins and dried cherries so I put a handful in along with the walnuts.  This bread stands alone but the addition of dried fruits makes it so yummy and moist if those are flavors you like. It's" fruitcake like" and I give it out for Christmas.

The only change I made was baking in a sheet pan instead of a loaf pan and not using nuts (my family dislikes nuts in cake-can you believe it?).  This is a recipe I know I will use again, and will try it in a loaf pan, also.

I've made this MANY times and it is awesome.  I've made it with the butter melted and with the butter softened - half brown sugar/white sugar and also with all white sugar.  You can make your changes as you see fit but this recipe as written is awesome.

I love banana bread and have tried a ton of different recipes. When I made this one, my husband stated this was the best one ever and whatever recipe I used to not lose it. At that point he didn't even know I had tried something new, just loved it that much. I made no alterations to the recipe and it came out perfect!  This is my banana bread recipe from here on out!!!

I used this recipe along with NAPLES34102’s suggestions and it turned out amazing.  I’ve made it twice for my family so far, once adding a glaze on top.  This is definitely now my go to banana bread recipe!

The best banana bread I have ever eaten. I tricked the recipe a little. I also add one teaspoon baking powder and little more flour, around 1 and 3/4 cup. Three bananas are definitely enough, it is around 1 cup, and like most people I mashed bananas. My kids love it.

This is the best, easiest recipe for banana bread I’ve ever made. Even my teenage son, who hates bananas, ate half the loaf! I usually don’t make substitutions in recipes, but I never have sour cream in the fridge so I used vanilla yogurt instead. I also really like cinnamon so I added that to the flour mixture. After greasing the pan with butter flavored Crisco I sprinkled brown sugar in the bottom to give the loaf a sweet crunchy finish.

I made a double batch and with this batch used both white and brown sugar. Since my family has nut allergies I also did without the walnuts.

This is the best tasting banana bread I've made. The breadis moist and the crumb is just right. I am a novice baker, at best.  This bread is gread to serve for breakfast or a nice evening dessert. Just take one piece of advice from some of the reviewers.. half white sugar and half brown sugar. Your bread will turn out great!! Happy baking!!

Other reviews are correct about creaming the butter and sugar and mashing the bananas. Besides that, this is THE most moist and yummy banana bread I’ve ever had. I even froze a bunch of it and am thawing a little at a time. Tastes as good as the day I baked it. A real winner!

This banana bread was delicious!  As suggested in other reviews, I added a third banana. Plain Greek yogurt was substituted for sour cream and I added a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. The bread was moist and tasty. My family has already requested that I make it again.

The only change I made was to use defrost ripe bananas that had stored in my freezer.  No need to mash as the thawed bananas virtually pore out of the skins.  Mixed everything else as directed.  Came out great!!!  Gotta go for a walk to burn off the warm slice with butter that I just had.

My family loved it! Made it just as recipe calls for.  I didn't add nuts because of allergies and used banana extract because I had ran out of vanilla.  But otherwise followed the recipe.  It was good. Will save for another time.

After using a different recipe for quite some time, I decided to change things up and try and new one.  This recipe is now my new Go To for banana bread!  It's SUPER moist.  I made two changes suggested by others and more in line with what I have been doing:  I used butter softened at room temperature and I mashed the banana - using 1 Cup total .

I’ve made this recipe a dozen times and it’s turned out amazing every time!  The only thing I change is I mash the bananas instead of cutting them.  Perfect every time!

First time making banana bread and this came out so perfectly! I added a tiny bit of allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg and didnt have walnuts or chocolate chips. I wish i had riper bananas but this was so delicious. Definitely will make again!

This bread is pretty good, I forgot to make adjustments for high altitude so it would have been a little better if I had. It did rise well with all new ingredients.  It's a bit too sweet for my taste. If I make this again I will probably cut the sugar in half and mash up the bananas.

Used 2 1/2 ripe bananas to yield 1 cup; mashed, not sliced. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Turned out amazing. Moist,  great flavor, and easy to make.

I've been using this recipe for years and its amazing. The sour cream is what makes this recipe so special. Quite a few reviewers said they sliced the bananas and that's why they dont like it. I've always mashed them and added cinnamon and its came out perfectly.

Ive been using the same recipe for many years, and it was just not moist enough.  I made this last night, and it is PERFECT!   This will be replacing my current recipe as the standard.

I must give credit to my roommate who made this scrumptious banana bread! He doesn't have an account, so I'm saving this recipe in my favorites. Super moist and delicious, and holds together very well. Best banana bread ever!

I used half of the sugar since the bananas were super ripe.  I also smashed the bananas and used greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  I did have to cook it 6 min longer, but it could have been my oven or the yogurt.  Also added raisins.  It came outstanding!

This is the best bread!  The recipe is perfect the way it is. However, I have altered it just for my own preferences. 3 very ripe bananas and a little less sugar. I now can not go to a family function unless I bring a banana bread. :)

This is so good.  The only Banana Bread recipe I use now.  We have made it several times following exact recipe.  It is so moist and tasty.  I say we, it is a favorite for my 12 year old son to make.  So easy he can do it on his own turns out delicious

I loved it! I changed the amount of sour cream, because the dogs knocked the measured cup I had off the counter and ate it... I had just about 3/4 cup left in the container, and I used that. It still turned out moist and delicious, more so than the banana bread recipe I've been using for years..  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I loved this recipe but after reading the reviews I combined some of the reviews. I can see how this would be delicious like it is.  But this is over the top. I didn't want to use nuts because I was giving them to elderly friends. I mashed my bananas . I doubled the recipe and used 5 bananas. I added soda and baking powder. Also cinnamon and butterscotch chip. One cup for a doubled recipe. It was so rich and moist and the butterscotch was over the top yummy.

My hubby LOVED this banana bread. I omitted the nuts, and I substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream for a healthier alternative. When baking, I am always amazed at how much sugar goes into sweets! Will be making again.

I love this recipe.  I made a few minor substitutions.  I ended up using brown sugar, because I realized at the last minute, I was out of white sugar.  Still came out great.  Also I used pecans because I don't like walnuts, and I did mash the bananas instead of slicing them.  I just prefer the texture that a mashed banana gives.   My husband also gives this recipe a thumbs up!!!

I did a double batch with 6 ripe bananas.  I reduced the sugar a bit (to 3/4 c instead of a full cup) and added 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg b/c I like that.  I also eliminated the nuts since my son doesn't like nuts.  Overall, really excellent and very easy.  Next time I'm going to experiment with swapping out greek yogurt for the sour cream....

super easy to make and super moist and delicious. 
this will forever be my go to recipe for banana bread. 
I didn't have any vanilla in the cupboard so I left that ingredient out also
I added some chopped walnuts for some crunch. it turned out amazing.

I used 3 really ripe bananas and mashed them up good.  That's the only thing I did differently.   I take this into work and get constantly asked for my recipe.  It's a keeper!

Very good,  I followed some of the advice of others adding the lemon juice to the batter and also citric acid to the bananas.  (Banana bread doesn't usually stay good very long so I am experimenting.)  I also added more spices like cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.  I added pecans to one loaf and walnuts to the other.  I also cut the sugar to 3/4 cups.

What an awessome recipe. I've made this a few times now and it's become one of our family favorites. The only thing different I do is add in a cup of chocolate chips.

Basically followed the recipes although did mash the bananas and only softened the butter. It is very good and I will make it again. I did have to bake about 7 minutes longer.

My FAVE banana bread recipe.  It is delicious.  I have even used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream (once when I realized I didn't have any sour cream!), but otherwise I don't change a thing.  I often double the recipe and make it in a bundt pan though :)

If you watch the video, it says to mash the bananas, which makes a lot more sense. I think it must be a typo mistake in the recipe itself which says to simply slice the bananas.

Love this recipe.  The only things I have changed over the years is 1. Mixture of brown and white sugar 2. Sub or mix in with sour cream yogurt even banana flavored yogurt. 3. Make muffins, they freeze wonderful. 4. Mash bananas

I use this recipe for zuchinni bread too!  Use 2 cups shredded, unpeeled zuchinni.  Do not drain or dry the zuchinni.   Also, add a couple pinches of allspice.  Seriously, this recipe is better than the zuchinni bread recipes I've used!

I made this today while on vacation so did not have my regular tried and true recipe with me so used this one with a few changes. Used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar, used sprouted spelt flour (an ancient grain flour), and over ripe bananas (mashed the bananas before adding).              8/31/18 Ellie,Mesa,AZ

I've made this recipe a few times now, and it is consistently excellent. It's clearly best when fresh from the oven, but remains good for days afterward when wrapped in foil. I do recommend mashing the bananas, rather than slicing, as others have mentioned.

Delicious!  I made a few changes though.  I used half white sugar and half dark brown sugar. I added about a cup of strawberries (frozen strawberries, thawed and cut, added juice and all). Also added skipped the walnuts but added about a tablespoon of powdered hazelnut coffee creamer to get a little nutty taste without the actual nuts.  So moist and delicious!!!

I waited a week before reviewing to make sure my husband liked it.  He did.  I made it exactly as the recipe called and it was fantastic! I did add some chopped nuts and I mashed my bananas, but that was it.  Fabulous as it is.  My second making, I'm using light brown sugar...just to see.  But if you want a great and easy Banana Bread recipe...this is it!!!
UPDATE: Still making it and still one of the easiest things to bake! I don't fold anything in, I just put it in and let the mixer mix it.  Love love love this recipe!!!! (with brown sugar or regular)
**Can be made with 1:1 gluten free flour
**One batch makes 3-4 mini loaves (I made 40!!)
**moistest banana bread recipe -I've tried others since but this one is the BEST!! Don't change a thing!!

I made it exactly the way the recipe was written and it was the best banana bread I've ever had! My sister said it was the best she ever had as well and she's lived in Texas for the past 25 years where there are some amazing cooks! Thanks so much! I won't use another recipe for banana bread ever!

Thanks, best banana bread I’ve made. I think the sour cream was the secret ingredient that made the difference.

I didn’t have white sugar or sour cream and only left them in the oven 30 minutes since I used mini cupcake pans. I had leftover mixed sugar from monkey that I previously made so I used a cup of that and also substituted the sour cream with half a cup of regular milk and they came out really moist on the center.

This is the best banana bread I have ever made! I have been making it for about a year now. I do add dark chocolate chips.  I make it at least once a month for something to pack in my kids lunches and they love it!

This is such delicious and moist banana bread. I don’t like nuts in my bread, but always add a teaspoon of cinnamon  and some other fruit in addition to the bananas. I have made this bread with blueberries, diced apples, and even various Jams. Every variation has been spectacular!

Awesome Banana Bread!  The sour cream makes it super moist, a demand from my husband.  The only changes I made were using gluten free flour (don't tell my husband ;) ) and because I was using a dark bread pan, reduced the oven temp to 325 degrees and took it out at 55 minutes.  This definitely a keeper and I'll make again.

This was absolutely delicious!! I used very ripe bananas and praline pecans instead of walnuts (that’s what I had on hand).  Very easy recipe - can’t wait for my morning coffee and my 2nd price ??

10/13/19: still great! Used sour cream (and it was better than plain yogurt!). Toasted walnuts for 4 minutes, and also added 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Baked at 325 for ~60 mins and the sides weren’t so brown.

Great recipe! Subbed plain yogurt for sour cream because I had it around and worked well. Sides were a bit overbrowned because it was a dark metal pan, but may reduce to 325 or take it out earlier next time.

Made this by chance because I had 1 very overripe banana that I  wanted to use. I've tried 3 or 4 other banana bread recipes and wasn't expecting much because of past experience, but was completely floored by how amazing this was! I was dreaming about it at work the next day!
I halved the recipe and mashed the banana. Did not add nuts because my bf can't have them. Next time I will make muffins and add the nuts to half of them for myself!

Took longer to cook than instructed but it was very delicious.  I suspect it was because I used 3 bananas instead of 2.  I also mashed the bananas, that could have caused the longer cook time as well but it made the banana flavor more consistent throughout and there were no chunks that I dislike. I also used pecans instead of walnuts.

I love this! I added pumpkin spice flavoring around 2-3 teaspoons (I meant to add 2 teaspoons and poured more by accident), used 3 mashed bananas and reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup. A but crumbly but was super moist and smelled divine. It was a hit in the office and I will definitely make again.

I’d also agree with those who suggested mashed or puréed banana. I’d also suggest using an exact measure in the recipe, as opposed to “two medium bananas.” (The actual volume of two medium bananas on average is one cup if diced.) The real problem is that “medium” is subjective - and what makes a medium banana in some places might not be the same size banana as in other places.

I'm so happy with the outcome! This was my first time making banana bread and I loved it. It wasn't dry (which I liked) and it wasn't too moist either. I added an extra banana just because I had one more left and didn't include any nuts. It was done after baking for 50 min. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Such a great recipe and so versatile! After I made the first two loaves (gone in under 24-hours), I immediately went on a banana bread kick. I made three loaves the next day (one gone in less than an hour), six regular-sized loaves and 24 mini loaves the next week, and seven more loaves the day after that! 
The co-workers LOVED it, and comments from gifted loaves included 
" Deeeeeeeeeelicious!!!!!!!! ??" 
and 
"Very good banananananna bread!"

I found that I could add more vanilla (about 1/2 tsp more), cinnamon, semi-sweet chocolate chips, peanut butter, more banana, more sour cream, less sugar, more nuts... etc. and loaves still came out AMAZING!  Have fun with this recipe! Oh, and cream that butter and sugar well. I melted half and kept half at room temp. Seemed to work well.

Dee-lish!  After trying just one slice, my family each wanted their own bread to take home.  Like other reviewers, I mashed the bananas (my personal preference), but I’m sure it’s great either way!

The flavors/proportions work well - very similar to many others. Sour cream always makes sweet breads more moist. My complaint is: one of the reasons many of us make banana bread is because the fruit on hand is past the "I want to eat this raw" date. Having big chunks of the mushy discolored fruit is not very appetizing.

I used canna butter (marijuana butter) and 4 g of buds (pot) ground finely in a coffee grinder. I made 2 small loaves and froze one. I'll use this recipe, it is nice and easy. I hope the author isn't upset I deviated from the original. I also used sliced almonds. Frank

Delish! As others have mentioned, MASH the bananas. Banana chunks in a bread is not very pleasant. I also added a yummy crumble for the top: 2 tablespoons of flour, 1/3 cup packed brown sugar, some cinnamon, and a tablespoon and a half of butter. I added this mixture half way through baking as to not burn the brown sugar. SUPER YUMMY!!

This recipe is still moist and tasty when I make it with honey yogurt instead of sour cream and 1/2 of the flour is whole wheat.  I baked it in cast iron bread pans as well.  It gets so many raves from my kids!  

Thank you for the best recipe in the world for moist Banana bread!

Turned out really yummy, however I did tweak it. I smashed the bananas instead and added chocolate chips, didn’t go with the walnuts instead I topped it off with chopped almonds. I would add half a banana more.

I don’t like bananas or banana bread, however I had a guest who left several bananas; not wanting to throw them away, I decided to surprise my husband and bake some bread. This bread  is incredibly moist, light and delicious...and this is from a “non-lover”  of bananas! The only modification I made was to add some chocolate chips and some white sparkling sugar. Will make this again!

Best banana bread recipe hands down. I usually add a little cinnamon and sub yogurt if I don't have sour cream on hand. Mashing the bananas gives the best result IMHO.

Awesome and will be even better next time. I read reviews and made the following adjustments: full cup (plus a bit over) of mashed banana that was super ripe.  You can actually roast bananas in the skin to concentrate flavors even more.  I did 1 tsp. of both baking powder and baking soda. The most important thing I did, and that was after I made the first bread... I cut the sugar in half!  It was much much better with half the sugar. Honestly, why do recipes in the U.S. call for so much sugar that you can't taste the other flavors?!?! 

The first time I also added nuts and chocolate chips. My feeling is the chocolate chips overwhelm the recipe.  In addition to added even more sweetness you can't really taste the banana.  So I'm going to be a purist and make it plain!

So, as a lot of other folks stated in their reviews, I mashed my bananas instead of slicing because that's how you incorporate fruit into the bread. Anytime I use a new recipe I never alter it except for maybe the cooking time because I want to try  what the author has put out there. It's just how I do it; however, if I deem it necessary, the next time I make a recipe I will make adjustments. So this is the first time I've made this bread, and it  just came out of the oven. I followed the recipe exactly as the author intended except for mashing the bananas. The only issue I have with this recipe is in my oven (natural gas oven) I had to increase the cooking time by about 20 minutes as it was seriously gooey. I initially bake the bread for the full hour as the author indicated at 350 degrees. The bread was browning very quickly and rising as it should, as such I didn't want the bottom to burn, so I reduce the temperature to 325 degrees and cooked it for a long time additional 20 minutes. As far as I can tell, it did not burn, it looks beautiful, my house smells amazing and the bread appears to be a work of art. Now I haven't tasted yet since it's cooling,  but when I am preparing anything I'm constantly tasting and the batter itself was wonderful prior to going into the oven, so I'm sure it will be fantastic once sliced. I hope my review helps anyone that is having issues with cook times. Thanks to the author for great recipe, I'm sure my family will enjoy this!

I subbed coconut oil for butter, added cinnamon and nutmeg, brown sugar instead of white, mashed the bananas, and baked for 50 minutes. It’s perfect.

I didn't have walnuts so I'm sure it came out differently for that reason, but it is very good, I'd prefer the bananas mashed instead of sliced, there are some pieces of banana that are too  big for my preference. Very easy and good flavor! Will use this as my go to banana bread recipe.

Sadly the oldest easy recipe usually gets the best rating. Guys keep scrolling past this recipe, it's okay banana bread. The end result is not beautiful, amazing, or even superior. Wet, sticky shiny, not fluffy consistency.

My family are purists!  They love this recipe without adding the nuts and chocolate chips. I do mash the bananas, add lemon juice to them and soften the butter ahead of time. But otherwise this recipe is just perfect!!! I’ve been asked for this recipe countless times!

Many reviewers sliced the bananas as stated in the written recipe but I watched the video first.  The video does show to mash the bananas!  Please mash!  Maybe this was an oversight which needs correcting.  Either way, the bread is delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly and the results were disappointing. My expectations were high based on other reviews and the photos. I think because the bananas are sliced the flavor did not penetrate the full slices of bread. Also the total flavor was lacking, and the bread is too dry. It could have needed more sweetner too. Seriously I feel like I wasted my time and ingredients & wish I could start over with a better recipe.

This recipe is fantastic, I wouldn't change a thing!  I had been using a Betty Crocker recipe for many, many years and this one is ten times better!  We make it all the time, and my kids love to add chocolate chips sometimes.

As written this banana bread is good. I incorporated the suggestions of others, though: mashing the bananas instead of slicing them and adding 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp baking powder, and this recipe became a true keeper!

I made this and I accidentally used 1cup of butter instead of 1/2.  Baked it anyway thinking why not and omg it was insane delicious.   Add more butter for an extremely moist bread.

Delicious and moist.  Occasionally I'm out of sour cream and I substitute real mayonnaise and it's still delicious. Recently instead of a bread pan I bake it in a bundt pan. Depending on the humidity it bakes perfect in 50-60 minutes.  The reasoning behind the bundt pan is it keeps well on the table in the decorative covered glass cake dome.

The only changes I made were using 1/2 tsp baking soda & 1/2 tsp baking powder. I used 3 bananas, mashed. I also prepared the pan by buttering and then sprinkling all interior surfaces with cinnamon sugar. After baking, I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top while still hot from the oven. Absolutely delicious, moist & even the ends taste scrumptious!

Outstanding recipe! Nothing but compliments on how moist and rich this bread is!

I used 3 well-ripened bananas, added a 1 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder, a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon to the flour mixture, and used butter to grease the loaf pan rather than cooking spray. I also baked at 325F for 60 minutes, and it came out perfectly moist but cooked through.

I followed the recipe with the following exceptions— used half butter, half oil because I didn’t have enough butter, three mashed bananas for extra banana-ey flavor, lite sour cream because it’s what I had, no walnuts because I didn’t have them, added cinnamon, and baked in an 8x8 pan because I have NO IDEA where my loaf pans are. Tasty, tasty! Wasn’t super dense like most recipes (possibly the sour cream?), and had that yummy caramelized crust. Put some butter on it and ate three pieces before it cooled all the way. If I made it exactly as printed, I’m sure it’d be fan-effin-tastic!

I used cream cheese instead of sour cream, added 1 cup of blueberries, it is delicious.

Can anyone recommend a see through disposable bread container ? Because my bread is frosted I can't wrap it or put it in a bag without messing up the frosting. I've looked everywhere on line but can't find the right sized container. My pan is 9 x 5

I made this for my boyfriend, but I left out the nuts. He ate two big pieces, and mentioned a couple of times how it was so much better than store bought. I used very ripe bananas.

Turns out perfect every time! 
FOR VEGANS:
Substitute the butter one-for-one with canola oil and substitute the sour cream one-for-one with canned full-fat coconut milk. I only used the thick fatty part of the coconut milk that sits on top of the liquid.

This recipe is identical to 'Valerie's Sour Cream Banana Bread' as published in 1987 in 'The American Country Inn and Bed & Breakfast Cookbook' except that Valerie's recipe calls for 1 cup of mashed bananas (much more precise than 2 regular bananas, sliced) and creaming the butter and sugar. This has been my 'go to' banana bread recipe for nearly 20 years...it just works every single time and is the best banana bread recipe.  That being said, I have used one that called for 1/2 cup of oil but it always had a slightly greasy texture to it which might happen by melting the butter as Janet's Banana Bread calls for.

We used the recipe as written except we used a mid grade VSOP brandy instead of vanilla extract, that added both vanilla and a deeper richness from the brandy.   Best, moistest banana bread I've had.  My new go to b.b. recipe.

This is an excellent recipe for banana bread, but the sour cream was too much and created something so moist that it was almost a little soggy. Don't use so much sour cream and this is perfect.

Great recipe.  I substituted the sour cream for greek yogurt, and smashed 3 bananas instead of slicing 2.  Had to force myself to not eat the batter straight from the bowl lol

Great Recipe!!  Moist ( from the sour cream), but it never lasts more than one day....I wonder why?!?  Only difference is - I always mash the bananas.  Anybody with any baking sense knows what a chunk of banana looks like after being baked for an hour....

Don't make the same mistake I made!! I added 1 cup of butter, thinking 2 sticks of butter equivalent to 1/2 cup! Besides that, I enjoyed this recipe, it was tasty and moist. I also added cinnamon because it is one of my favorite spices and it was delightful! I would definitely recommend others to make this recipe.

Excellent muffins! I added almond extract and chocolate chips because I like them and substituted Greek yogurt because it’s what I had. The muffins were moist and had great flavor. I think this will be on my regular banana bread recipe.

This is my go-to banana bread recipe because it takes just 2 bananas and that's usually what I have. The ripe banana is sliced rather than mashed and I find it more flavorful.

The best banana bread indeed. The key is to whip the butter (not melted) with the sugar. That if you prefer the fluffy kind of bread like me.

Have used this recipe time and time again. My husband and son gobble this sucker down before it even cools. Lately I have been using silicone muffin pans to make it - takes about 30 - 36 minutes (less mess and half the time).

I just added 4-5 cloves and 1/4 tsp cinnamon powder. The banana , like other reviews said needed to be mashed instead of slicing. It is an amazing banana bread recipe. The  loaf is extremely soft and the sugar quantity is perfect.

Awesome! I had some very ripe plantains and used those instead with no additional sugar.  I used both baking soda with baking powder.  I also doubled up on the recipe and used a stand mixer to blend all ingredients.  Pleasantly surprised.

I used heavy whipping cream instead of sour cream, and I creamed the butter (softened butter) with sugar instead of melting the butter.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  Next time I would bake it for 50 - 55 min instead of 60.

I made it just like the top rated suggestion says.  1 tsp. of both baking powder and baking soda, shredded the butter and mashed it with the sugar (versus melted butter), and added 1 tsp of lemon juice.  Did not add walnuts, as I have a picky eater in the family.

I actually made this recipe twice, first melting the butter then combining it with the butter and slicing the bananas.    The bread was good, then tried the variations of room temperature butter and beating before combining the other ingredients.  I also added 1/4 cup dark brown sugar in addition to the white sugar.  Lastly mashing the bananas instead of slicing is a must!

This is now my go to recipe for banana bread, it's so moist and stays that way, not that it will last that long in my house.  I can't get bananas to get ripe enough fast enough for my brood!

Made it a few times now I add chopped up dates as we do not care for walnuts. Even made it for the grandkids and they loved it. I love the chunks of banana instead of puree.

Such a beautiful banana bread! I made a double batch, added a little extra banana (mashed not cut) as I LOVE the banana in it. Did half with walnuts and half without. It was so moist and delicious! It was gone in a few short days, my boys devoured it! Will definitely make again.

Great base recipe! Sometimes I am our of sour bream, so I have substituted heavy cream and buttermilk, both also work great! I also like my banana bread with some spices so I always add in cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves.

Delicious! Moist and versatile. Definitely mashed the bananas instead of sliced, and  I did add a few sprinkles of nutmeg and cinnamon, but I think the recipe would taste great as-is too. I also tried it for muffins (uising a cupcake size tin) And made half with walnuts and half without. They were ready in only 20 minutes!  I had some leftover mix, So I added mini chocolate chips and put it into a mini loaf pan and baked for 40 minutes. Needless to say, it was a hit! All versions turned out yummy!!!

I love this recipe!  Sometimes I'll add some cinnamon or allspice for variety, but it stands on its own.  I've  made several loaves now and usually have to leave them in the oven for an extra 10 to 15 minutes to cook them through.  A wonderful use for this banana bread is french toast.  ...it will change your world.

BEST BANANA BREAD I HAVE EVER MADE !!! 
This recipe makes delicious moist banana bread but I did make a few changes like I mashed the bananas and instead of white sugar I used light brown sugar, I also made them into muffins and they are perfect !

This banana bread recipe is one of the best I’ve ever had. Perfect color, smells amazing and tastes PHENOMENAL. I did add an extra half a banana with a few dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg for some extra “pop”. Just a helpful hint, even if you grease your pan, the sticky dough like to stay in it after it cooks, so let it cool IN the pan for a few prior to putting it on the cooling racks. One of mine somewhat “exploded” from the inside out when trying to remove it while still hot (see pic).

Have made this bread a few times now and have shared with friends. Everyone loves it!  My husband loves the ends of the load the best, so today I am experimenting and making it as banana bread muffins so there are more with crispy edges.

This bread is moist and very good.  The first time I made it for an office potluck and received numerous compliments.  I didn't tell anyone it was the first time  I had made it.

Good flavor, turned out well. I just really don't like the amount of sugar in it. I likely won't be using this recipe again b/c of that.

This is the second time I made this recipe. The first time I followed it, but my family did not like the chunkier pieces of banana. The 2nd time I made it I instead used the blender for blending together al the liquid ingredients before adding them to the dry ones. The result was very good and my family devoured all of it in one day. I also did not use vanilla because I did not have any, and used cinnamon instead.

This has been my go-to for a few years now. It’s so delicious. I usually cut the sugar (I use 1.5 cups) and substitute the sour cream for some vanilla Greek yogurt that I almost always have on hand. I also add a handful of chocolate chips instead of walnuts bc why not ;)

I followed this recipe exactly using all ingredients stated. The only thing I changed was that I mashed the bananas instead of sliced. Best banana bread recipe ever! Will keep this in my recipe box.

Excellent recipe!  I decided to mash the bananas very thoroughly and gently add & mix all ingredients!  The result was awesome!  A slight crispness on the outside and a rich looking consistency inside!

I love this recipe! I have been using it for years. I do however always add more banana then called for. whatever I have on hand, but Usually 4 to 6 instead of 2. I leave it chunky which creates nice pockets of soft banana within. I also add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to this (just a dash of each, maybe 1/4 ts) and I drizzle a little honey on top before baking

This is my favorite recipe so far! I make this bread for my boyfriend all the time and he loves it! The sour cream really makes a difference in adding moisture to the bread. I haven't changed a thing about the recipe. 
Although, I sometimes find myself having to add some baking time in the oven since this bread is so moist, just to make sure it bakes all the way through. Delicious!

This is a good recipe, and adaptable.  I've subbed yogurt for the sour cream if that's what I had, as well as apple sauce for the  eggs.  My son actually prefers it  made with applesauce instead of eggs, but I prefer the regular way.  Maybe sometime I'll try subbing strawberry yogurt for the sour cream to see how that looks and tastes.

Made this bread in January 2 times.  Excellent recipe.  Took it to a swim meet and it was a big hit.  It was requested again and also asked if one loaf could be made gluten free.  Followed recipe and will make often. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This is now my "go to" banana bread recipe.  I use Einkorn all purpose flour and 1/4 c. walnuts and 1/4c. chocolate chips.  This bread is moist and so flavorful.  It's also a hit at work pot lucks as well.

I mash up the bananas because the sliced bananas kinda gross me out.  Other than that change, stick to the recipe and it makes THE BEST BANANA BREAD EVER!!!  My 3 year old loves it!  She requests “bayaya bed” regularly.

Used the variations of Naples but instead of sour cream used non fat Greek yogurt. Best BB I’ve ever made! Will make again for gift baskets. Love, love, love this recipe!

This bread was delicious. My kids are asking for it for breakfast, snack and dessert. Next time I will make a few to keep on hand.

I mashed the bananas and creamed softened butter based on the reviews and my own previous experience.  My oven cooked it a little faster than an hour, but the crispy (not burnt at all) outside was really tasty.

Awesome recipe. I've made it as written and also substituting yogurt when I don't have sour cream on hand. Always delicious. I also like to add a tsp of cinnamon, but that's just my preference.

Great tasting Banana Bread.  Lightly toasted the walnuts which added a good flavor and mashed the bananas instead of slicing them.  This Bread is a winner and very moist.

My favorite recipe on AR, and I've made it dozens of times and it's always good.

For the record, today I made this into muffins instead of loaves, and large muffins took 25 minutes at 350.

My bananas were too brown to slice so I mashed them and followed the recipe otherwise. It is delish.

This bread is fabulous.  I have a very particular husband who absolutely dislikes bananas  and would never have touched this bread just because of the name.  It looked good to him on the counter after it was made so he picked a piece up and ate it.  I was shocked.  After he ate it and asked me to make it for a friends wedding I told him it was banana bread he was extremely amazed and has loved it ever since.  Thanks from a very desperate cook.

Best banana bread I've ever made! I doubled the recipe and used 6 very ripe bananas I didn't have walnuts and didn't miss them. They were so moist the kids devoured it before my husband came home! Thank you for the great recipe!

It turned out really well. I added a table spoon of coco powder to the mix and chopped up the banana to small pieces after reading some reviews. Very simple and easy to make. Will do it again for sure.

I added cinnamon and used 3 bananas. I used plain Greek yorgurt instead of sour cream cuz it's what I had. I also put cinnamon and sugar on bottom of pan before baking.  baked at 325 for 40min then covered with foil for 10 more minutes. I like it but don't want to make again cuz I ate the whole thing lol

I won’t use this recipe again. I know I’m in the minority in not giving it a high rating. I followed it to an absolute “T” except that I mashed the bananas. I baked it in a temperature-verified 350 degree gas oven in a Pampered Chef stoneware loaf pan. It took an hour and five minutes for the center to set up, and it got very dark brown in that amount of time. It’s super-sweet, too sweet, and something isn’t allowing the banana flavor to come out as much as it should. Disappointing. I’ll go back to my standby recipe in my old Betty Crocker cookbook, which has been perfect every time for over 40 years for me.

I’m making this again and will be adding 1 extra banana for more banana flavor. Thank you

I browned my bananas in a frying pan with butter, maple syrup, a little cinnamon, and vanilla extract  then I folded it into the batter before I baked it...I did this version several times, so it varies on color. I hope you'll try it and love it, the way my family does!

Excellent bread!  Added more bananas and nuts than the recipe called for, and it was perfect.  The heel had a nice crispy texture.  Will be at the top of my banana bread repertoire!

However, I creamed the butter together and mashed the bananas. Otherwise the proportions were left as is.

I have made this recipe countless times now. I've even had to substitute oils for butter, as I ran out of butter, and it was even more moist. I also use a vanilla 10% Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. The loaf doesn't long! It's my go to recipe.

I made this recipe exact the first time and it was fantastic. The second time I made it I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream (that's what I had on hand), swirled a half cup of blackberry preserves through the mix at the last minute and baked it in a decorative bunt pan. Then I poured an orange glaze over the warm cake and gave it a light dusting of powdered sugar. It was 
easy to make and a huge hit with family and friends.

Delicious! I halved the recipe (8 servings), making no adjustments, besides leaving the walnuts out. I omitted the salt as I was using salted butter. I ended up with 9 muffins (same temperature, cooking time reduced to 18-20 minutes). The batter I ended up with was thicker than a typical muffin batter. I added 1/4 mini chocolate chips. My bananas were a bit on the lighter side of ripe, but they stilled turned out good.

I've made this twice now. The first time I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts, which I prefer. I also left out the sour cream. It was really good but not that banana-y. The second time I added an extra 1/2 banana, and the next time I'll probably use 3 instead of 2. ALSO, a great touch to this is to add some honey. You can substitute some honey for some sugar, only using 1/2 cup or so of sugar. If you don't want to bake honey into it, drizzle it on top. So good.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever made. It is gone in an hour with my family of four. I substitute the sour cream with vanilla yogurt, strawberry yogurt once, and it is so moist and delicious. I must have made this bread at least 100 times now. Love it!!!

My wife and I really enjoyed this banana bread!  Like others said, we mashed the bananas instead of slicing.(We used overly ripe bananas) I also added some Craisins to the recipe. Came out Delicious!  Next time I will use 3 bananas instead of 2 just to get a stronger banana taste

Great recipe that required absolutely no altering in my opinion. I used bananas which I had previously tossed in the freezer as they were getting over-ripe and it turned out great.  Moist and rich.  

This last batch used small loaf pans because my previous attempt turned out slightly under-baked larger loafs.  It could have been my oven or the convection setting.  Regardless, smaller dark metal loaf pans worked great.  I also tested using both cooking spray against Crisco & flour.  Both resulted in non-stick loafs however the cooking spray was a bit more moist (damp).  If you have the time, grease & flour the pans.

I made the following substitutions for health: 1/2 cup applesauce for the butter, 3/4 cup Honey for the sugar, 1 cup whole wheat flour & only 1/2 cup white flour instead of 1 1/2 cup white flour, and 1/2 cup non-fat greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  I also sprinkled in some cinnamon.

Very moist.  I only used 2/3 cup of sugar and pretty much mashed the bananas by the time I was done chopping them.  I liked someone else’s idea of adding cinnamon and nutmeg, but didn’t read it till after it was I noticed the oven so I will try that next time

The banana bread I made based on this recipe was 5 stars easily, by doing what most reviewers suggested: adding more of and mashing the bananas, and creaming the softened butter and sugar. As the recipe as written would've not been as good, I cannot rate it any more than 3 stars, though I didn't actually ever make this as written. I have used both sour cream and yoghurt in this recipe and both work quite well.

The best banana bread I’d ever had!! I added raisins, and 2 tablespoons of sourdough starter instead of the baking soda.

Instead of 1 cup of sugar, I used 1/2 a cup. It turned perfectly sweet considering the bananas give enough sweetness to the bread. Also, I used sucanat (natural dried sugarcane juice) instead of the processed sugar.

This  is a good banana bread recipe.  I did mash the bananas instead of slicing them.  Next time I will use ripened bananas, I think it  will  give the bread  more flavor.  But overall it was good.  Will make again.

I still mashed the bananas and it was still excellent.  I also added about 1 TBSP of cinnamon to the batter and then sprinkled a little more on top.  
Next time I am going to pour 1/2 the batter in the pan and then add thinly sliced bananas on top of it and then pour the rest of the batter over top of them.

Loved it! I substituted 1/2 cup of wheat flour and used 1 cup of white flour. I also used pecans and then sprinkled pecans and brown sugar and a 1/4 Tbs of butter on the top before baking, so good.

This banana bread is just meh.   Very sugary (and I love sweets); not very much banana flavor.  I would not make it again.

I absolutely love this recipe, everyone who I’ve prepared this think it’s perfection. I do substitute the sour cream with 3/4 cup of Greek yogurt .. also definitely prefer the bananas mashed. Other than that no changes.

This is awesome! I’ve made it a few times now and most recently used gluten free flour and used the tweaks that one reviewer suggested: adding lemon juice and baking powder. And why this thing calls for slicing the bananas I have no idea - mashing is the only way to go. This is definitely a keeper!!!

The best banana bread recipe I’ve tried! Very moist and so tasty. I mashed my banana and did not add nuts- we only like nuts in our pecan pies.

This was my first time making any type of bread (I'm a pretty novice baker) and I followed the recipe exactly other than I did a rough chop on the bananas instead of slices - it is amazing. I don't even like banana bread (grandma requested I make it) and I can't stop eating it. Next time I think I'll add one more banana, a touch of cinnamon, and maybe some mini chocolate chips.

This was great!  A simple and scrumptious recipe for kids to do as my 12 year old stepson did it by himself.  He measured, mixed, and baked it from start to finish and decided to do muffins instead of a loaf to make it easier to eat.

Wow! This is the best banana bread I have ever made, I followed the recipe exactly and was a little hesitant about the sour cream, but it is perfect.... The recipe says it serves 15 but for my family of 4, it was more like 8 slices LOL

This recipe is amazing and so easy to make.  I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream since that's what I had on hand and it was delicious!  This will be my go-to recipe for banana bread!

28 Feb 2018–Very good, moist and good texture.  Doubled the recipe, used the hints another reviewer suggested:  added lemon juice, mashed 4 frozen bananas to make 2 cups, added 1 t each baking soda and powder.  Invited new neighbours over for snow day cuppa and served, plus sent some home with them!

I made a double batch (two loaves) and they turned out moist and delicious.  Like others, I mashed the bananas (not sliced). The only thing I added was a confectioners sugar and vanilla glaze, because I have a sweet tooth. Five Stars!

This was absolutely the best banana nut bread I’ve ever have made.  Even though I realized halfway through the baking time that I had forgotten to include eggs, this bread was the best.  
I can’t wait to make it again-correctly!

This was delicious!  The batter smelled so good it was hard to wait for it to be finished!  It took a little longer than an hour to bake in a stoneware bread pan.  Make sure to let it cool 10 minutes in the pan before removing it!  I overlooked that instruction and almost ruined it.  ?? Luckily when it started to fall apart, I was able to scoop it quickly back into the pan.  ?? It is very moist and flavorful.  I squashed the bananas instead of slicing them, but that was the only change.  Thank you for sharing!

Perfection. Followed recipe pretty much. Only added an extra banana and walnuts. And sprinkled a bit of raw sugar on top. Think it was my best ever banana bread. I made mini loaves.

I made this and used half the sugar and twice the bananas. I also used two cups chopped pecans instead of walnuts. The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly but found it to be too sweet for my liking.

The key to this bread is not overbaking it.  I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them, and I've also substituted plain, or vanilla yogurt when I didn't have sour cream with the same results.  Very good!

I changed the flour to Bob’s Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flour because of DS’ diet. I made muffins instead of a loaf, swapped sour cream with greek yogurt, upped the mashed bananas to 4 and reduced the sugar to 3/4. It’s still very sweet. Perhaps next time I will change to maple syrup as suggested by others. Oh and I baked it at 330F for 25 mins in a convection oven. Came out perfectly golden and fluffy.

Amazing!  Used pecans instead of walnuts.  Also made it into muffins and baked for 17 minutes.  Perfect!  Love the muffins because it’s easier to take them on the go.

OMG! This is the best banana bread that I have ever tasted. I made two small very minor changes. I ran out of walnuts, so I used a quarter cup of walnuts and a quarter cup of hazelnuts and crushed them together with my rolling pin inside of a baggy. I also mashed the potatoes. I am thrilled with this recipe and plan to make it frequently. Thanks a million for sharing.

I baked at 325 in a standard muffin tin and a mini muffin tin. They turned out awesome! Once I could touch the tops of the “muffins” and they bounced back, I took them out immediately. I let the standard muffins cool in the tin, but took the mini muffins and let them cool on a rack so they didn’t over bake. I substituted the sour cream for Greek Yogurt and let my mixer mash the bananas. Delicious!

I don't generally review because I end up modifying the recipes, but I've made this one several times - pretty much as written. I do add 3 mashed bananas (don't change any of the other ingredients measurements) and a little ground clove. Other than that, exactly as written. Also, make sure a toothpick comes out clean from the very center of the loaf. Otherwise it will be undercooked. I've never heard people rave so much and ask for the recipe when I share the bread I make. It's EXTREMELY moist and wonderful. The sour cream makes all the difference in the world!

I have tried a lot of banana bread recipes through my 45+ years of baking and this is by far the best. For me this is a classic. One of those recipes you pass on to the next generations, it's that good.  For starters it doesn't call for oil which I have never been a fan of oily bread.  The bread is very tender with excellent texture. I made one change, I mashed the bananas. I had made it previously adding sliced bananas as directed but I wasn't fond of mushy chunks in the bread.  Have also substituted mini chocolate chips for the nuts as the mood struck.

Enjoyed this recipe! Made small modifications- instead of sour cream, I used plain nonfat Greek yogurt, added cinnamon and used 3 bananas instead of 2. The bread was dense and moist. Very good!

I have several banana bread recipes that I choose from when my bananas invariably go from green to overripe. This one has become my new favorite!  It was perfect! I used about 3 bananas, cuz that’s how many I had. Everyone loved it! Thanks for sharing!

I baked it in a toaster oven made in Japan so it took only 30 minutes. I used half cup brown sugar and half cup white sugar. Mashed the bananas. Split into 3 small loaf pans.

It's sooo.... good and very moist!  I doubled the recipe ... I used 4 very ripened bananas - MASHING the bananas .... will distribute the banana flavours and texture through out the whole bread versus slicing. I did some adjustments  ... I softened the butter instead of melting it.   I seldom have sour cream on hand but always have yogurt of some kind in the fridge, so I decided on using strawberry yogurt.   I halved the amount of walnuts and added 1 cup of defrosted strawberries, making sure they were well drained and then sliced into quarters.  I made sure  the bananas were completely incorporated into the batter before I carefully folded in the strawberries.   By adding strawberries, I did have to make baking time adjustments  -  approx. 70-75 mins .   Will bake this again and again!
This section has been amended ... Just made this the 2nd time only I made it GF for my daughter.   I used a GF flour blend of rice flour and tapioca flour 1:1 ratio to what is called for in the recipe ... I made the same changes as above ... only cutting the baking by 5 mins.  It came out just as moist and great tasting as the regular flour!  ... would of never guested it was GF .

Super moist, great tasting.  Only , I added my own mixture of nuts.  (Sunflower seeds, almonds, pecans walnuts and whatever else kind I happen to have at that moment.  Crushed together .  Not to fine though)

A very favourite in our house. Usually substitute walnuts for chocolate chips, but sometimes none. And I do mash the bananas. As a substitute for sour cream, I have used Greek Yogurt, but have been told that it’s better with the sour cream. This bread doesn’t last long enough to get dry in our home. So moist and delicious!

Amazing bread. Very moist and not too heavy. I added an extra banana. Kids don’t like walnuts, so swapped for almonds.

I love this recipe and so does anyone else who tries it. It's simple and comes together nicely and quickly. I usually don't have sour cream in my home so I substitute yogurt, which works. Also, I mash the bananas so there are no unappetizing chunks of purple in the bread.

This was outstanding! Just because I like to tinker with recipes, I added in 1/2 tsp almond extract and about 1 tsp of cinnamon. Also, I made a glaze with a bit of banana liquor, whiskey, milk, and powdered sugar and poured it over the top of the cake while it was still warm.  It was gone within two hours of taking it to work the next morning. I will definitely be making it again!

I made this recipe and it was delicious. The only variation I made was that I mashed the bananas. It came out great. I’d definitely make it again. I also left out the nuts since I don’t like nuts in my desserts.

Excellent and no harm in adding an additional banana if that's your preference. The sour cream makes the bread incredibly moist and whether you SLICE or MASH is truly IRRELEVANT as long as the bananas are appropriately ripened.  Bananas that have matured in the refrigerator for several days to  the point of baby food consistence will render the best bread, and this holds true for any recipe.

I made this recipe but baked it in muffin tins for 30 minutes. They all got eaten rather quickly with plenty of rave reviews.  I gave two dozen to my niece for her birthday.  They were very moist, just the right amount of sweetness and I liked the banana slices as opposed to smashed.  It added texture and better banana flavor. Will definitely keep this as my “go to” banana bread recipe.

I didn’t have a loaf pan so I used a bundt cake pan and still turned out soft and moist.  My boys couldn’t wait to eat it all up.  Definitely will be making again.

I made this recipe today and it is very good.  Although the bananas were a bit mushy in the finished product.  Think I will stay with my recipe which I have been making for many many years. This recipe calls for “folding” the sour cream and bananas  in last.  My recipe calls for adding bananas to batter in the mixer and giving it a couple of turns which incorporates the banana more evenly throughout the batter, then fold in the dry ingredients.  I prefer this method—no mushy spots in bread.

I made this BB recipe and my man said it was the best BB he has ever had. He fancies himself an expert.   I mashed the bananas though.The second time I made it with chocolate chips and my neighbor stole the loaf.As we speak, I am making it a third time, adding some coconut. :)

This is the definitive banana bread recipe amongst my friends and family now that they've tasted it.
It even adapts well for those with gluten and dairy dietary restrictions by using a gluten free flour, substituting coconut oil for butter, and coconut milk for sour cream, each at 1:1.

This is by far the best banana bread i have ever tried. It is so moist and flavorful  the whole family loves it. I used strawberry yogurt instead of the sour cream  the first few times i made it. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I made this before reading any of the reviews. Followed the recipe except no nuts and mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. Turned out a little  dark and crispy on the edges, so since I used glass pans I will turn down the temp 25 degrees. Banana chunks turned purple in the bread, so I will  probably whirl in the processor and I might cut the sugar down and add spice like cinnamon and nutmeg  next time.

Followed the recipe pretty much spot on. Used a bit more flour, walnuts and bananas. About 1/4 cup more flour because i used more bananas. This was my first time baking banana nut bread and it is super delicious. I also had to adjust the bake time and temp to compensate for my electric oven. During the first 30 minutes, i could smell the bread was cooking fast. So i turned the oven down to 300 and cooked for about 45 more minutes. It turned out perfect for me. Nice and crisp on outside and moist and fluffy on the inside.

Great recipe.  I cut back the sugar to 3/4cup instead and still just as good.  I added some cranberries I had in the freezer too this time and it was yummy.  I think the sour cream in this recipe is the key.  will be my only go too for banana bread and will add different seasonal berries when I have them.

REALLY F'N GOOD! I modified the recipe by doubling it (had 4 bananas), and adding 4C of fresh blueberries, It turned out very  nicely! Next time I will add some cattail pollen and see how it goes.

NEEDS BAKING POWDER. 1 tsp. as top review says. REVISE THE RECIPE. One shouldn't need the reviews to get a *major* mistake. I am left with a delicious banana paver.

Followed directions to the letter, without a doubt this is the best Banana bread recipe. Made for Christmas breakfast and everyone raved, moist, just perfect. Froze the other loaf, and had it over New Years, still just as good.

Absolutely delicious, perfect! Followed the recipe just as is, except butter should only be soft room temp. not melted and made sure to measure 1 cup bananas and they must be mashed. Watch bake time towards end carefully. I won't be looking for another banana bread recipe, this is it!

This recipe is the best banana loaf recipe I've ever tried. It was moist & very tasty.  I love using the sliced bananas rather than mashing them. I left out the walnuts & my whole family loved this recipe.

BEST BANANA BREAD I’VE EVER HAD! This so delicious but I did make a few changes. 1. Instead of slicing the bananas, purée them in a blender. This gives banana flavor to every bite while slicing them gives flavor to only some bites. 2. It does make one loaf which isn’t a lot. Make a double batch! I do every time and am happy. Note: if you are not into sweet, moist breads than this is not for you. Very sweet and moist.

I’ve made this several times and it is always wonderful. I don’t regard myself as an amazing cook or baker, however it went without saying that the bananas should be mashed after slicing. I feel that was a mistaken omission on the part of the original poster and not a fault with her recipe.

I sliced the bananas into the stand mixer and let them blend into the mixture instead of leaving them sliced. I also used coarsely chopped pecans instead of walnuts.

It was the best. Everyone in the family loved it. It came out of the pan easily and with the silicon pan I didn’t need to grease. I recommend replacing the wall nuts with raisins. It was one of the easiest recipes on this website. I highly recommend it.

Made this banana bread, but omitted the walnuts as my hubby doesn't like nuts in banana bread. I also mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. It is by far the best banana bread I have EVER made! I think the sour cream is the secret ingredient. This will be my go to banana bread recipe forever and the one I will leave to my kids...

Really, really good banana bread.  I did mash my bananas (I used 3 of them because I had to use them up), mostly out of habit. I also creamed the butter and sugar.  But otherwise, made it with exact ingredients.  Will now be my only banana bread recipe.

I have been baking this banana bread for a couple of years and have made it my own. I make it for everyone because I take a lot of pride in it! Everyone who has tried it has honestly said it’s the best banana bread they’ve had, including people who don’t like banana bread (Even they wanted more!). How old do you recommend the bananas be?

Excellent. I made a couple of minor adjustments because, well, that's just what I do. I replaced the sour cream with 3/4 c heavy whipping cream, used a 1/2 c white and 1/2 c brown sugar, 3 bananas, and 2 c flour. I will stay with 1 1/2 c flour next time. All and all, it was great and I guarantee it would be, also, by following the recipe, explicitly.

Used cup for cup gluten free flour, Greek yogurt for sour cream (I did not have any sour cream).  I creamed the butter and sugar, and made mini loads and muffins.  These were the best!  No one would know that they were GF.  Thank you!!!

I cannot even tell you, how many times I've been told," this is the best banana bread I have ever had". So moist and delicious. Very easy recipe. Makes great use of bananas that are going bad. I throw them in the freezer, and when ready to use I thaw them. To add to recipe just snip the end and gently squeeze the end, the banana will slide right out of peel into batter.

Delicious! Only minor tweaks: I covered the loaf pan with aluminum foil to hold the moisture in. I also mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. Overall amazing!

I have made this several times and It's just THE BEST! I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream because that's what I have. Cream butter, sugar, one egg at a time, beat all the wet ingredients, stir in sifted flour, salt and powders (1 tsp each baking powder & soda per other reviewer's suggestion). I am so lucky to be the baker of the best banana bread around!

A keeper!  I followed the recipe pretty much as written...I did mash the bananas and also added 1/2 C of chopped dried sweet cranberries.  It made 4 moist and delicious mini loaves!

Very tasty but needs a little love. First, mash the bananas, sliced is silly, and it feels like you’re biting into a mushy mess. I’d also add a pinch of nutmeg or cinnamon it needed something. This is a very moist, lovely bread. Great recipe. Make it and see what you think.

So delicious. I will definitely make it again. I doubled the recipe (I had 4 almost bad bananas), made muffins instead of bread (don't own a loaf pan), & used pecans instead of walnuts (personal preference). I baked the muffins at 350 for 20 minutes. They were PERFECT. Made 3 dozen muffins.

I have made this recipe countless times. I modified it a tiny bit. 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 whole cup and an extra banana. And I mush the bananas instead of slicing. But it is the BEST recipe ever. I always, always get complimented on it, and I always send people to this website if they want to make it themselves. :)

Substituted 8.5 oz sourdough starter (1 cup) for the sour cream and 1 cup of the four. Substituted melted coconut oil for melted butterAdded cinnamon, ground ginger, and cloves to mixAdded toasted chopped walnuts to mixTopped with more chopped walnuts, some toasted almonds, and shredded coconut I wanted more of a bar so I used a shallow 7x11 inch pan lined with parchment. Came out great!

I substituted coconut flour and coconut sugar and it tasted excellent. A bit tricky getting the right amount of coconut flour to regular flour as it’s not 1:1 but that’s on me, not the recipe. It tasted excellent and I will definitely make this again.

Made a few changes... mixed 1 cup of all purpose flour with 1/2 cup wheat flour. I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a dash of cardamom. The bread was delicious.

Extremely moist and tasty.  I made the mistake of using 3 banannas instead of measuring and it was too gummy in spots.  I will make it again  using less bananna and add a little cinnamon.

This is the best banana bread I’ve ever made. I have made a lot in the last 45 years.  I had to stop myself from putting in cinnamon like I usually do. Good thing because this is just right. Very moist and I’ve made it several times. My husband loved it.

Most banana bread recipes I have tried ended up flat, but this one looks fantastic!! It rose nicely because of the sour cream, and the moisture if perfect. Keeping this recipe for sure!

Used four bananas and it was really yummy! A little softer because of that but it was excellent. I wish the bread had a more rounded top though. Mine went flat once it cooled down. Other than that, really good taste!

I love reading everyone’s variations on this site. Anyone who cooks regularly knows how to tweak it for various reasons. I myself being a seasoned cook appreciate the feedback. However for this recipe I kept to the way it’s written except for I mashed the bananas. Delicious what a hit!!!!

Excellent. Follow the recipe to the letter. It is absolutely perfect. Even the cooking time was spot-on. I made one loaf as-directed for freezing - came out perfect - and I made a second loaf, identical, but I baked it with a topping spread over the top of the batter before I put it in the oven, made out of melted butter, brown sugar, crushed walnuts, and cinnamon. OMG...no words, man. The topping is killer, but honestly this recipe is so good, it's perfect without it too.

Best banana bread I’ve ever made.  This is a definite keeper!  Just one thing, and I really dislike when reviewers rave about a recipe, then proceed to say they’ve changed something, but I did mash the bananas.  I automatically did this without reading that part of the directions.  I will probably continue to do so, but other than that, this will be made again in my house!

Turned out beautifully using a mix of the  recommended adjustments. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, put less sugar and did half brown and half white. Room temp eggs and softened the butter. I beat the butter/sugar, beat the egg in, sifted the dry ingredients and folded in the rest. Be warned, it takes a while to prep!

Cut the sugar by half and then added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  Perfect!

The only change I made was using about half a banana more that’s only because that’s what I had other than that turned out perfect

It truly was the moistest Banana bread out there. I’m so glad that this recipe was posted because all of them are so different and making a decision on which to make all really depended on my ingredients I had at home and this one was perfect for my circumstances. Although instead of just slicing the bananas I put them on my kitchen aid and I mashed them up because It brings a better texture to the bread

This is an excellent banana bread, my daughter and I both use this recipe. We follow the recipe except we mash the bananas. I don't want slices of banana in my banana bread. I double the recipe and it makes 2 big loaves. Moist, flavorful, delicious.

I have been making this every year for my family during the holidays. My only substitution is using Land O' Lakes cinnamon sugar butter spread. Also I think mashing the bananas helps distribute the flavor batter throughout the bread.

Definitely smash the bananas first then mix! I didn’t have sour cream the last time I made this and replaced it with 1/2c if yogurt and 1/2 tsp baking soda and it worked out fabulously!

Made 12 loaves for Thanksgiving! So easy to make. Ingredients were straightforward and not much arm power to mix! Got the 24 oz sour cream - was short for the last 2 loaves. Added 1/4 tsp cinnamon! Yummy to taste! And the house smells so comforting!

Great recipe, I've made this many time this original way. However my mother in-law cant have dairy, so I replaced the butter with vegetable oil and the sour cream with apple sauce. It came out wonderful!! Btw I also used pecans, delicious!

Didn’t add the nuts because I didn’t have any in the pantry. But the bread didn’t need them. So moist. Probably the best banana bread I’ve eaten.

So easy and delicious!!!  I will definitely make this again! Thank you for the recipe.....

I had to make only one modification. I had no walnuts on hand, so threw in about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips. 

My husband WON'T stop eating it.  I hope I get to try it too! LOL... Thank you again!

So happy to have found this recipe. It’s my to go to recipe for now on. Super moist and so delicious.  Went according to the recipe exactly, no need to alter the recipe. It’s so simple to make and  the last few steps is what makes it light and airy.   The sliced banana add a different texture, compared to mashing them. Tried both ways my husband likes the sliced bananas better.

I did not make any changes except one time I was out of sour cream so I used heavy cream and it was spectacular as always.  My wife and I make it every year and give it away to friend and family.

My favourite banana bread recipe! I didn’t have butter so replaced it with vegetable oil instead and still turned out perfect! Added 1tsp of cinnamon and doubled the vanilla. Came out so moist and full of flavour!

Really delicious. Ive made it 4 times now with the adjustments of creaming the butter and sugar rather than melting the butter and adding 1 whole cup of mashed bananas. It usually takes over an hour to bake for me and for some reason i still find its a little to dense and moist. I must be doing something wrong. Never the less its still delicious. I tried adding matcha powder, chai seeds and nuts and it was awesome.

This recipe worked beautifully! I really wanted some banana bread and didn't have all the ingredients so I made a few substitutions: I didn't want walnuts so I added 1/2 teaspoon of hazelnut extract, 1/4 cup of flaxseeds, and 1/4 cup of finely shredded coconut. I wanted to make it vegetarian so instead of sour cream I used 1/2 cup of coconut cream and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice. I also reduced the amount of sugar by half, using 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar and used an additional banana. With these changes I got a fluffy, ridiculously moist bread. This will definitely be my go-to recipe from now on.

I followed the recipe as written. It is perfectly balanced. Most, flavorful, and just the right amount of chopped nuts. I'm making this again. Not changing anything. Delicious.

Very good indeed.  I've made two small modifications to it (for my personal taste).  Instead of 350 degrees I cook it at 300 degrees (I don't like it when the crust is very dark).  Also, I added 3 bananas instead of 2.  But other than that I followed the recipe as is written.

The banana bread was good. Felt like it was too sugary, I would add a half cup of sugar instead of a full cup. Mashed up the bananas instead of slicing them and it made a difference

I've made this 3 times now.  The first 2 times I made it as the recipe states and it is delicious.  This time I changed it up a bit.  I had 3 over ripe bananas that I used.  I also melted my butter in a 2 qt sauce pan and when it was melted I took it off the fire and stirred in the sugars.  Then I dropped in the bananas whole and used my potato masher to get the consistency I wanted then added the eggs (because it had cooled off by then) and the vanilla.  I mixed in the flour mixture, stirring until it was integrated well and then the sour cream along with the walnuts and the extra addition of a couple tablespoons each of dried cranberries and sunflower meats.  It turned out perfectly delicious.  I would and still do trying the original recipe!

Recipe is excellent! Very moist cake. Increased the walnuts and added a cup of rum soaked raisins.

Best recipe for banana bread.  Even my critical grandmother marveled over how moist the bread was. You could burn the bread (which I did not do) and it would still come out moist. This is my go to recipe. Love it! I even added some shredded squash and it wasn’t even noticeable.

I added about 1/4c or less of extra walnuts and a third banana while substituting avocado oil for the butter as I was out of it.  The Most Delicious banana bread that I have ever had.  This is going into my permanent recipes.  Wow.  Thank you,  Janet!

It tastes okay but it's VERY heavy - unlike the recipe I usually use. My normal recipe disappears fast but this banana bread has been sitting on the counter for over 5 days now with more than half left to go. Probably won't make this again.

Only change I make is a bit more vanilla, and mash the bananas instead of slices.  This is a great recipe!

Tastes great, very easy to make, however...it would be nice to have the amount of banana in cups or ounces.  I used rather large, very ripe bananas and the bread had a sticky crust and a bit of a sunken center as if there was too much liquid and sugar.  I think maybe it was just too much banana.  Otherwise no complaints, thanks for sharing your recipe!

I did mash the bananas, added a little cinnamon to the batter, and the 1c  sugar I used 3/4 white and 1/4 brown.  My DIL loved it and said it was moister and fluffier than regular banana bread.  A winner for sure!  TY, Janet, for sharing.  I would not have thought of the sour cream on my own.

I have made this many times.  Only changes I make are to use Fage plain nonfat  yogurt instead of sour cream, replace the walnuts with 2/3 cup chocolate chips and add 3/4 tsp of cinnamon.  Oh, and I mash bananas too, like many others have noted.  Huge hit with my teenage daughters.

Not too sweet and very moist.  I followed the directions exactly, except I mashed the bananas until lumpy, but not creamy.  I’ve had dry banana bread and greasy bread, so this recipe is welcome.

I have no idea what i did. Im a beginner and when i took the bread out itt looked wonderful, i even sprinkled powdered sugar but i think it wasnt cooked because as soon as i took it out, the batter started pouring out from in between. It was chaos! It looked perfectly cooked from the outside brown n all but from the inside it was completely raw. Anyone who could maybe help me out?

I will make it again.  It was delicious.  I did cream the butter and sugar.  I mashed the bananas and used one cup.  I may use an extra banana next time.   I used 1 and 3/4 cups of flour.
I read a tip elsewhere on this site to bake banana bread one notch below the middle notch in the oven.  Also to put aluminum foil (shiny side down) over the top for the last twenty minutes of baking.  I did those two things.  It was very tasty.

I followed the advice from NAPLES34102, with a few deviations: I added a half cup of grated coconut and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, which I’ve found to be great compliments to this recipe in the past!

Excellent.  I made with dairy substitutes  and it turned out perfectly.  I only had 8x4 loaf pans, so made some “mini” muffins - the extra for two batches made 18 extra mini-muffins (made in a candy-making pan with 18 spaces) which cooked perfectly in 17 minutes.  Very tasty, and moist!

Omitted the sour cream and nuts and added cinnamon and freshly ground nutmeg instead. Came our a treat! Also, slapped on some vanilla iced topping. Even better!

It really is a 5 star recipe! The only things I did different were, I mashed the bananas, because I couldn't imagine biting into a piece of banana bread and feeling something wet and squishy in my mouth! Haha... And instead of butter, I used coconut oil, because I substitute all butter and shortening and oil products with coconut oil. Also, I didn't have sour cream, so I used blueberry greek yogurt! The bread was delish!!!

This bread is dangerous because it's so easy and so good. I took others advice and mashed the bananas. I didn't measure them out, just used 3 and it was fine. I didn't have walnuts so I used some pine nuts that we had around. No problem there :)  I'm really not supposed to have dairy (I can sneak a little in) and have big issues with butter so instead of butter I used one of those new Country Crock sticks and I couldn't tell the difference at all (yeah!). A family favorite!

I brought this to work my boss loved it so much he asked me to marry him,  we are now married and have been for 17 years (and he still loves it) LOL.  This is the only Banana Bread recipe I use.  I use old bananas put in the freezer (unthawed and mushy) I "mix" the sour cream in instead of fold just a little, I also use half & half instead of heavy cream turns out very moist and been a favorite for years and years in my house (and work and school and bake sales.....)

This is a great recipe, as it needed minor tweaking. I replaced the butter with canola oil. When I made it with butter it came out a bit on the dry side. With oil it was amazingly moist. I also added a teaspoon of lemon or orange  zest. And I heated 2 tablespoons water and added  1 tablespoons sugar until dissolved. Brush bread with this piping hot out of the oven every 5 mins or so until used up. It makes for a moist sweet beautiful top worthy of cook book page glossy.  This is a keeper with the minor tweaking.

I have made many Banana Bread recipes and this is now my favourite. The only change that I made is that because I use frozen bananas once they were defrosted they went into the recipe puréed. It’s been 2 days since we finished the loaf and already I have a request to bake another one!!

This is the only banana bread recipe I use. The only changes I make is I use 2.5 medium sized over-ripe bananas (or 2 large over-ripe bananas) and I don't slice them I mash them. This bread is so moist and delicious, my boys beg for it all the time!

I didn't have any sour cream, so I substituted yogurt.  It came out fantastic!  The bread as really moist.  I also substituted light brown sugar for the white sugar in the recipe to add a bit more richness to it.

Best banana bread I’ve ever made. I come back to this recipe every time, and it never disappoints. The only steps I change are to use room-temp butter instead of melted and mash the bananas instead of slicing. Perfection!

This is now my go-to recipe.  Here are the changes I made:  cream the butter and sugar together (do not melt the butter), used 3 medium sized bananas (mashed) plus 1/8 tsp of cinnamon.  It took 53 minutes to bake.

Nice recipe for a beginner like myself! Just changed a few things; used mashed bananas, more walnuts and added chocolate chips. I’ll be making this again, only to add an extra banana or two. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

As written, it's OK. With the variations outlined in the first couple of most helpful reviews (cream the softened butter & sugar, mash the bananas, etc.), it becomes a 5-star banana bread. I also use Greek yoghurt instead of the sour cream, but either works wonderfully.

I added 1/4 cup of chocolate chips and finely chopped walnuts instead and ot made it even better. I also made them into muffins (350 for 25 minutes for 6 muffins) so I could have them for breakfast. Made approximately 17 muffins. Best recipe and so simple and easy!

I wish I'd read the reviews first. The sliced bananas are awful and very noticeable as discolored mushy slices. I will try this recipe again but I'm definitely mashing the bananas. This loaf was a waste of time and ingredients and went into the garbage.

Possibly the best banana bread I've ever had.  I only made one change and that was subbing half of the butter for refined coconut oil (I didn't have enough butter on hand.)  Incredibly flavorful and moist.

Made two loaves of this bread and it is absolutely delicious and so moist. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon two both loaves. I used sour cream for the 1st loaf and it came our great. I used plain Greek yogurt for the 2nd loaf (ran out of sour cream) and it came out even more moist. I smashed the bananas instead of slicing them. I don't like sliced bananas in baked goods.

I am not a baker but have made this twice & it disappeared in couple of days. I made some minor adjustments based on reviews. 
Let butter soften at room temp ( do not melt)
Mash bananas - I don't measure them as I like lots of banana flavor here
3/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup yogurt (vs sour cream)
1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder
1-3/4 cup flour

I have made this recipe 3 or 4 times now and will make it again. Instead of walnuts I use chocolate chips and I mash the banana completely. I also add a little extra baking powder or soda like someone else recommended. I have made it in loaf tins and muffin tins and both worked well. People have liked it a lot.

The only thing I changed was mashing bananas not slicing and using 1 cup of them. Got alot of compliments.                                                                                         Thanks

Very tasty.  Besides smashing the nanners,  only change was to use butter/applesauce  1/2 each.  Add dried cranberries or chopped nuts or both. 
Mine was done in 40 min so be sure to check  early.  :-)

This banana bread is absolutely delicious!!  My family LOVES it.  It is perfect as written though my personal preference is to replace half of the butter called for with oil, I love the depth olive oil gives it.  And, as with most recipes, use half white sugar and 1/2 brown for more of a caramel-ly finish.  Amazing simplicity - thank you for sharing!!!

Thanks for the recipe. I unfortunately didn’t have vanilla or walnuts both of which make banana bread more tasty and I normally use those ingredients but forgot to check my stock.

This recipe is awesome and based on the other reviews it is very flexible. I followed many of the suggestions.  These were the adjustments I made.

Creamed the Butter
1 tsp of lemon juice
1 tsp of Baking soda & Baking powder
1/8 tsp of Nutmeg
1/4 tsp Cinnamon
I used heaping cups of the measurement listed for the flour
just  a little over 1 cup of mashed bananas.

Next time I will use the exact recipe to see if I notice any major difference. I immediately had 2 slices. My husband was upset I didn't want to share :)

On suggestion of my sister in law I changed it to 1 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup almond flour. Very moist and delicious. Be sure almond flour is finely ground and clump free. Sift all dry ingredients together

I made 2 changes...I subbed in brown sugar for white 
and I also added 1/2 cup of flaked sweetened coconut.  As reviews, I did "mash" my bananas. Very happy with the recipe...it is a keeper for my family.

Everyone who has tried it likes it. The only thing I do differently is completely mash the bananas instead of just slicing them. The bananas I use are also overly-ripe. Great recipe.

First time making banana bread and I used this recipe. It is incredibly moist and, besides the cooking time, is pretty quick and easy to make! I suggest using bananas that are overly-ripe

Turns out fantastically every single time!  My co-workers gobble it down very time I take it in.  The only regular substitution I make is to use vanilla Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream; sometimes I use walnuts and other times I will use pecans-it's amazing with either one.  LOVE this recipe; don't have a desire to use any other!

Like other reviewers have stated, I creamed the softened (not melted) butter and sugar, added vanilla and eggs (one at a time) before adding dry ingredients. Added 3 mashed bananas (not cut in chunks) instead of two. Best banana nut bread ever!!!

Yummy and moist. Made it several times. I use gluten free all-purpose flour, but only use a little more than 1 cup, otherwise it's too dense. Turns out perfect. It's hard to stop eating it

Great bread!  However I prefer my bananas smashed rather than sliced, and I use 3 very ripe bananas.  I’m told this bread tastes like my husband’s grandmother’s banana bread!  Thanks for sharing it!

This recipe is so moist and flavorful. My family absolutely loves it and says it's the best banana bread they have ever tasted.  I kept the recipe the same except I mashed up the bananas and added a 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon. This is definitely a keeper.

This was the best banana nut bread I've ever tasted. I used 2 cups of pecans and doubled the ingredients and cooked it in a bundt pan.  It was so moist, and, I loved the way the pecans  carmelized while cooking.  Absolutely delicious!!

This is the best banana bread recipe! I always get so many compliments when I make this for people. Sometimes I will use three or four bananas instead of two, and instead of sour cream I use non-fat greek yogurt. It is amazing! I also mash the bananas instead of slicing them.

LOVE this!!   Only change I made was using pecans instead of walnuts as its a personal preference.   People ask me to make it at every gathering!   occasionally as a treat for the kids I'll throw a cup of choc. chips in there just to push it over the top

I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe - it makes a delicious loaf every time!!!  The  addition of the sour cream makes it really moist, so good!

I followed Naples recipe to a tee!  1 3/4 cups flour, cream butter and sugar, 1 tsp each baking soda and powder.  I added a little vanilla and banana emultion, and alternated with dry and sour cream, delicious!

Substituted a container of  vanilla yogurt, added cinnamon, three very ripe smashed bananas from the freezer. Turned out awesome! Second time I made it only baked for 50 minutes since I was using a small loaf pan and large muffin tin. First time the tops were too dark and it wasn't as moist. With these changes this is my new go to for fast and easy banana bread! Thanks!

It looked promising, but the sliced bananas are the texture and appearance of raw oysters once cooked and the crust is too crunchy for my liking. Sadly may have to toss this one in the away.

Great recipe! Added chocolate chips (equal to walnuts), and instead of making a loaf, I made muffins - time adjusted slightly (use a toothpick - when it comes out of them clean, they are done!) they were devoured by my choco-fiends here at home!!

Ugh...why are people making so many changes to an already perfect recipe!? It baffles me.  Anyway, I made this AS DIRECTED and it's the best banana bread I ever made.  I used to make another one that's saved in my favorites from this site but that one was so heavy and dense.  I like this one better because it's much lighter and is still packed with flavor. I watched the video first and they mash the bananas in the video so I did that and I'm glad I did cuz I see from the reviews that if you don't do that, they get mushy.  I didn't know how it was going to turn out because of using melted butter, but it still turned out amazing.  This one's a keeper!

I made this recipe for the first time with some modifications and it was moist and delicious! I made the following substitutions: 1/2 cup extra light testing olive oil in place of the butter; 1/2 cup greek yogurt in place of the sour cream; 1/2 cup Splenda Blend for Baking in place of the sugar; and 1 1/8 cups Namaste gluten-free flour in place of the flour. I baked it in a convection oven @325 degrees for one hour and 10 minutes.  This will be my new recipe for banana bread!

I've made this recipes dozens of times and lost the copy of the recipe that I printed out. It's been a while since I've made it and wasn't sure about the proportions and went looking online.  I was so happy that it's still here! So delicious and moist!!

I have made this multiple times. I add more banana than suggested but that's just because we really enjoy the additional flavor and moisture. 

This is by far the BEST banana bread recipe I've ever come across. 

Yay,  Janet!!

I hate to review a recipe I altered, but this is a very good banana bread! As for altering it, I mashed the bananas rather than slicing them. I spit-balled the amount of butter as all I had was a block of butter. But I've baked enough to know what 1/2 cup looks like. I used half brown sugar/half white, totaling just under a full cup. I added some Kahlua because I add it to a lot of things I make - lol. And I didn't have any nuts so I added chocolate chips, because why not? I think the addition of the sour cream is what does the trick (or maybe it was the Kahlua?). In any case this will become my go-to banana bread, though next time I probably won't bake it on a whim so I'll have some walnuts at the ready. I'll still use brown sugar, chocolate chips, and Kahlua though.  :)

This bread wasn't very moist and had mild banana flavor. I would definetly mash the bananas instead of slicing them next time.

Yumm!! This is super moist banana bread that got devoured in a short amount of time. I doubled the recipe, didn't use walnuts (didn't have any) and I used a potato masher on the bananas as my bananas could have been a little more ripened. That's the only difference from the original recipe. I will make this again, and again.

His is probably the best banana bread I've made! I did tweak it a little. First of all, I had three bananas to use so I multiplied the recipe by 1.5. Also I didn't have my 9.5in loaf pan, so I used three mini loaf pans and baked at 350 for 45 min. I used plain nonfat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and then figured that the regular sour cream it called for had fat, so I added abt a tbsp of melted coconut oil. It was perfectly moist on the inside and the edges were sweet and just slightly crispy. My family couldn't stop eating it!

Best banana bread ever!  Doubled the recipe and I am glad I did.  Probably added more bananas and nuts than called for but it is delicious!  Slicing the bananas instead of mashing them is inspirational.  Will make this again (many times).  Thank you for the recipe!

A keeper. This banana bread is nice and moist and has great flavor.  Made with butter not vegetable oil which I think accounts for a better flavor.

This is a wonderfu recipe! The sour cream helps the bread stay deliciously moist for days...if it lasts that long ??! I have made this for my husband and myself and for others, it's sure to please any crowd. I did add a 1/2 cup of lightly packed brown sugar. I have made it in the called for loaf pan and in mini tin loaf pans. Both turned out great but I did keep a closer eye on the mini loafs just to insure they didn't get over baked. Give this recipe a try you won't be dissapointed.

I made this recipe and it was very much like my own except for the sour cream. After trying it with the sour cream,  I have decided that it really doesn't make the recipe "moister", just lighter and we prefer the denser version.

Amazing! 4 stars because I tweaked the recipe.  Had 4 bananas so that's what I used and I mashed them instead ofwhat the recipe suggested, also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  Also, the other reviewers suggested using room temp butter and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon .  It turned out so moist and wonderful!!

Made the following changes as one reviewer directed:
-softened butter with the sugar (not melted). 
-use 1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder
-1-3/4 c. flour
-bananas are used it should equal 1 cup
-mash the bananas, not slice them.

GLUTEN FREE FLOUR WORKED!  It was moist, flavorful and kept its moistness for about a week.  It was simple to make also.
I would recommend this recipe to anyone who needs to eat GF and also everyone else.  Delicious.

Absolutely scrumptious! Even the banana haters liked it. Not too sweet, very moist, I chopped my bananas instead of slicing them though.

I agree with everyone else.  Cream the butter softened with the sugar and must use 3 bananas or 1 cup "mashed" to get that fabulous moist banana flavor.    I actually made it with 2 bananas one time because that's what I had and my son wanted banana bread.  Instead it was quite drier like a loaf of bread and only had a mild banana taste.

I may change my rating after I taste it, I used frozen bananas and they mashed in the mixer, I added dried cherries and chocolate chips and it smelled amazing during the cooking ... I made it in a large 9x11 cake size pan as I doubled the recipe ... contemplating a cream cheese frosting ... the batter was yummy and that's always a good indication

Best banana bread I've ever tasted. I did what many others suggest. I purée my bananas with a mixer with the sour cream. I've also substituted sour cream for strawberry yogurt and it tastes just as good.

This was the best ever...I'm not a fan of banana bread but I will be making only this recipe.  Changes I made....1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup brown sugar. 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. I mashed my bananas and used 3 instead of 2 and added some cinnamon.  I also added chocolate chips and want to try the recipe again without since I ink it took away from the awesomeness of the bread. I baked for an hour and 10 minutes. My husband said it tasted like pudding it was so moist

I'll def make this again. I did change the recipe a bit to make it more healthy: I used Splenda instead of sugar, and I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour with 1/2 cup of white flour, instead of all white flour. I didn't have walnuts, but pecans were a very tasty alternative. I also added approximately 1/4 cup of wheat germ and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the mixture. Before baking, I topped with a sprinkle of cinnamon and sugar. My oven always bakes hot, so I only baked for 48 min. Perfection. Very moist. Thank you!

I made this recipe just as it was listed. I ended up putting in two large bananas, and 3/4 cup of walnuts which made one of the best banana bread recipes I have ever made. I also made 12 muffins and baked them for 12 minutes and they were perfect! (Muffins are a great idea if you don't want to bake it in the oven for 60 minutes!)

I used 3 bananas instead of 2, but otherwise I made it exactly as stated. It's extremely moist, but I feel like the banana flavor wasn't distributed as evenly as when the bananas are mashed. I'll definitely make this recipe again, but next time I'll use mashed bananas instead of sliced.

I used bread flour instead of all-purpose flour, which gave it a better texture. I used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream. I also added a layer of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the top of the batter (after being poured in the pan.) The chips slowly sank into the batter while baking, creating a rich, almost crisp and chewy chocolate "bonus" layer on top. So delicious!

The only thing that I didn't like was folding the cut banana's in at the end.  I rather have them creamed in with the wet ingredients because some of them ended up wet blobs on the bottom of the bread, other than that this is an amazing recipe!

This was terrific! Very moist and a wonderful banana taste. I did not change any of the ingredients but I did however change the way I assembled it. I didn't melt the butter but softened it to room temperature. I creamed the sugar with the butter then mixed in the eggs and vanilla.  Whisked all the dry ingredients together and beat into the wet ingredients until just combined. I mashed the bananas completely and folded them in along with the sour cream and nuts. It took one hour and ten minutes to bake.

The bread came out dry. I was hoping it would be really moist. I added few ingredients like milk to thin out and also added more bananas. Over all the recipe is good and easy to follow.

I have made this twice and each time I substituted olive oil for the butter and light mayonnaise for the sour cream to make it dairy free. I added some cinnamon and nutmeg for more spice and mashed the bananas. The whole family loves it. Very moist and flavorful.

I made it exactly as the directions specify, sliced instead of mashed bananas, and it was delicious, I may add some cinnamon next time, but this was a winner even though the video does not do the recipe correctly.

This came out amazing. I ended up making three loaves; one banana walnut, one banana pecan and one white chocolate banana bread. They won over my roommates and neighbors. I used browned/blackened bananas and made sure they were thoroughly mashed. If you substitute the butter for lard (was testing out what I could use the lard I found in my pantry with) it comes out drier. Will definitely continue using this recipe until I'm feeling adventurous.

I really liked it. Although, I did tweak it a little  and it came out great. First, I mashed the bananas. The thought of them sliced eating them cooked- doesn't sound to pleasant. I also added about half a tablespoon of cinnamon. It really makes a difference. Also, since my mom is allergic to walnuts I just did it without so she could eat it too. I also beat the mixture instead of stirring it so it'd become a little more fluffy while cooked. Overall, this was a great recipe and my parents loved it! I'll definitely be making it again!

This is the best banana bread recipe that I've found online to date. My whole family loves its rich yummy taste and how moist it is and we add a little nutella once it's done cooling. (I don't slice the bananas though, I purée it.) I stopped looking for new recipes and this is my go to! Thanks for sharing!

Love this banana bread! But you have to mash up the bananas and mix them with the liquids, not slice them. This recipe is a great base for making your own recipes. One of my favorite things to do with this banana bread is to use coconut oil instead of eggs, use pecans instead of walnuts and double the amount, add lots of cinnamon, and sweet flake coconut! About 2/3 cup of coconut and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. It's really good!

I keep pretty close to the recipe when I make this delicious banana bread.  Even though there has been an addendum to this recipe to mash the bananas and not melt the butter... I still do both... slice and melt.  I will also substitute plain greek yogurt if I need to use it up or don't have sour cream.  And I often add about 1tsp Penzeys' Baking Spice powder.   This flavorful bread gets better day after day..... if it lasts that long.

I wanted to make banana bread and my old recipe is so mediocre, so I googled, “best banana bread recipe ever” and this one came up. In prior years, I have had luck using the same search words for rolled sugar cookie dough...”best rolled sugar cookies ever”.. anyway, I got it then and I got it now when I wanted banana bread. This is so moist and luscious and super easy! I do add the chopped walnuts, they really make the bread, but I even went one step further and added 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. You can’t see them in the bread, but you say to yourself, “OMG! This is so frickin’ good!” Hubby doesn’t want any other cake now, just this! I also add dark chocolate chips and it’s great! So, you must make it, and others will want the recipe, too! Thank you JANET!

This is the best and most moist Banana Bread I have ever made. After reading all the reviews I did make some changes. I mashed my Banana instead of slicing it and I only softened the butter instead of totally melting it. I also added 1/2 c of semi sweet chocolate chips just for that extra touch of indulgence. Everyone loved it. This will be my new go to Banana Bread recipe.

I followed Naples review and added baking powder, lemon juice, used soft butter (not melted) and mashed the bananas.  This bread is by far the best banana bread I've ever made - and I've tried dozens of recipes!  My only complaint is that my loaves fell after removing from oven.  They tested as done and I even cooked them longer than called for.....will try again making smaller loaves.

Easy & delicious.  I couldn't slice the bananas, mine were beyond that so they were just mashed.  I will definitely make this again the next time I have leftover bananas.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever found.  It is dense and early on I had trouble with it being a bit gooey in the middle after an hour baking.  I have discovered that if I turn off the oven after an hour and just let it sit in the oven for 20-30 minutes, it is perfect.  The outside takes on a bit of crispness that makes the bread even better and no gooey center!

Delicious - very moist!  I had to bake it an extra 15 minutes.  I also put a baking sheet under it since the batter filled my loaf pan to the brim - it did not end up spilling over but I'm done with cleaning my oven! ;)

Loved it. Easy to make & was delicious. I did not put walnuts in because I don't like nuts in my food. I think the cream (which I couldn't taste) made such a difference. I didn't put walnuts in - that was the only modification. I think next time I'll use 3/4 c sugar instead of 1. Absolutely wonderful though!

Added a banana, mashing two bananas and slicing one. And only cooked it 17 minutes (I live in Idaho). Super  delicious banana bread!

GREAT recipe. My husband even said it was better than his grandmas recipe which is a huge feat. I took it to work and it was gone by the afternoon. Easy to make, delicious. Give it a try!

I've made a lot of banana bread recipes.  I alway loose the one I made and have to search for another :) BUT this recipe is in my favorites and I will not loose it!  It is the best banana bread I have ever made.  It is dense, moist and melts in your mouth.  It's so good that  you'll have a hard time sharing with friends, family or neighbors but if you do, they will love you for life after this wonderful bread.  Enjoy!

This was a big hit in my house, was eaten pretty fast. Like other reviewers mentioned I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them.

Absolutely the best banana bread recipe ever!!!
So moist.
I used 3 large mashed bananas and added cinnamon, nutmeg and a little ginger.
Used about 1 1/2 t vanilla flavoring.
Followed  reviewers  suggestions and  used 1 t baking soda and 1 t baking powder with 1 3/4 c flour.
Used pecans instead of walnuts and added 3/4 c semisweet chocolate morsels.
I'm always asked to make more!!
Yummy!!

Excellent banana bread. 
I mashed the bananas, added some cinnamon, nutmeg and a teaspoon of vanilla. to the batter. And sprinkled some cinnamon sugar over it before baking. 
It was very good!

Very good. Made four mini-loaves. My toddler loved this so much that she got excited and gave me a hug after her first bite.

I mashed the banana because it was a gift and I was worried about it looking funny. Next time, I'll slice them and compare.



Edit: yeah, mashing is better

Embrace the simplicity!  Easy & VERY tasty. Don't bother trying to change it - great flavor, nice & moist (even better the 2nd day - if it lasts that long).  Cooks BEAUTIFULLY inside without overcooking the outside (and that's a WIN in my book!).  My seasoned baker coworkers were impressed.

I've been making this for a few years now.   I do not put in the walnuts because I serve it at various functions and want to be mindful of those with allergies.  The only modifications I make are to use 3 bananas instead of 2,  I mash them instead of slicing, and I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup.   This always gets rave reviews and requests for the recipe.

This recipe was amazing!  My husband and all 5 kids absolutely loved it and my daughter asked for it to be her birthday cake (so I added cream cheese frosting).  I have an egg allergy baby so we have to do a lot of improvising and a lot of recipes don't work to substitute Flax seed for eggs but this one did beautifully.  I didn't change a thing except mash the bananas and swap out ground flax seeds and water for the egg.  Family Favorite

Made exactly per recipe, and every stinking slice of banana (after turning the batter around it purple) sank directly to the bottom of the pan, staying stubbornly in the bottom of the pan when turning out onto the wire rack. Taste is not bad; it certainly is moist, if a tiny bit fragile; but I do believe I will stick to mashed bananas in the future.

I've had this Allrecipes account for a few years and this is the first time I've decided to right a review. This was so awesome, I had to. Only thing I did different was to mash the bananas instead of just slicing them. I don't think that's really changing the recipe. I made jumbo muffins. Fluffiest muffins I've had. And the taste was superb!

I made this recipe as is and it was easy and  perfect. I did coat the pans with cinnamon sugar though before adding the mixture. Moistest Banana nut bread I've ever had. Definitely beats Panera's hands down. Made 2 loaves and my bf pretty much demolished 1 1/2 by himself.

I made this exactly as directed with the exception of using pecans instead of walnuts. It was fantastic!!! The only thing I would do differently would be to mash the bananas. When the bread was still warm, the banana bits were okay, but when it cooled, they were slimy. I wish I could give this 4½ stars. The crust was wonderfully crispy, the bread was beautifully smooth and moist. This will be my go to banana bread recipe.

Tastes great and very moist. I did not use walnuts but added chocolate chips. Next time I will cut sugar in half as the chocolate chips made it a bit too sweet.

I've made this a bunch of times...only change I make to the instructions is that I mash the bananas. Otherwise, I use this recipe as-is and it's always a crowd-pleaser.

Excellent!  Doubled the recipe and baked it in a coffee cake tube pan.  Baked 60 minutes at 335 degrees.  My oven seems to run hot.

I just tried this recipe three times. I didn't give it 5 stars because it needed the adjustments that naples34102 had posted in her review. THAT was the second time... the third I experimented by creating a strusle to bake on top with some butter, flour, cinnamon, sugar, and nutmeg... it sank into the dough before rising, so I ended up with a delicous core, but it threw off the baking time and I ended up with a dry over cooked outer edge. i suggest not doing that. lol

I love this recipe because there is room to add butterscotch chips/skor chips/Reese Peanut Butter chips/dark chocolate chips/blueberries/orange zest/strawberries etc. 
I opted to mash the bananas, it's my thing.
The loaf turns out perfectly moist. 
I even substituted the cup of sugar with 1/4 cup of Splenda in one loaf for a Diabetic family member.  
Thank you for sharing this recipe.
Look forward to the next time

Very moist and delicious! I too like to add a bit more flour, add baking powder with the baking soda and cinnamon. Those were my only changes and it was a hit at this year's mother's day celebration, Ty!

I mashed the bananas, used soft butte, added the suggested tsp of lemon juice and 1 tsp each of baking pwd and soda. Also used half white half brown sugar. Turned out delicious.

I made this exactly as called for, but was really disappointed.  It was actually too moist for me and as some other reviewers mentioned, the bananas were really gooey and clumpy because they weren't supposed to be blended and that ruined the whole thing for me. I like the taste of banana bread without feeling slimy bananas in it.  I tried the recipe as both a loaf and as muffins and I didn't like it either way.  I won't be using this recipe again.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe as I had 4 bananas on the brink of death.  Mashed them as other reviewers suggested, and to the batter added about a teaspoon of roasted cinnamon and half a teaspoon each of roasted ginger and cardamom.  Delicious!  Banana flavor is strong, bread is moist inside with a nice light crunch to the outside.  Will definitely make again!

It is easy to make and everyone loves it. Have an 82 yr old friend that told me it was the best and she is a true critic!! I have added an extra banana and more nuts but the original is great as is, really moist.

This was quick and easy. My desire to have an moist banana nut bread was happily met using this recipe.  Thank to Janet for sharing. My family and I loved it so much we ate all of the first batch Saturday and they asked me to make a second Sunday morning.

This recipe was decent. I made it with 3 bananas but think next time I'll make with 4.  (We really like a stronger banana flavor.) I also mashed our bananas instead of slicing them. (It's a texture thing with the hubby. )
I learned that with my oven, I'll have to cut 7-10 minutes off the cooking time. 
A very easy recipe to make!

Yummy, especially fresh out of the oven.  I reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and used light brown sugar.   and it was plenty sweet.  Other than that, followed the recipe

Made muffins: i used about half truvia blend, half brown sugar to make 3/4 cup total sugar. also used 1 cup all purpose and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  Used 1/2 cup homemade whole milk yogurt. And added walnuts.  And mashed the bananas out of habit.  My 10 yr old home sick today who refused to eat anything else is devouring these!

I followed the recipe except for two minor adjustments. I whipped the butter and sugar together and I didn't add any nuts. These were the most moist muffins I've ever had. I brought them to work and everyone complimented them!

Made it exactly as written except I mashed the bananas and added 1 C  of raisins.  I also double the recipie because everyone loves it and it literally disappears before I know it.  It's the most moist and flavorful  bandanna bread I've had.  Many thanks for a wonderful  recipie!

This was really good.  Had 3 very ripe bananas so I used them all.  I did mash them instead of slice. Omitted nuts due to personal taste.  Thanks for the recipe.   Will be sure to make again.

The banana bread is very yummy! Instead of slicing the bananas, I mashed mine, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Unfortunately, the batter started oozing and leaking/spilling over my bread pan and didn't stop until it had been in the oven for an hour. I ended up having to bake it about 1 hr 25 minutes total, and the top turned out more crunchy than I would have preferred, but lo and behold my boyfriend loved the crunch! He said it reminded him of a banana cookie. I think in the future I will split the batter between two bread pans, but I look forward to making this again.

MODIFIED:   I always use whole wheat white flour which I increased to 1 and 3/4 cups, and increased the baking powder by a quarter tsp, and I watch my sugar so I used a quarter cup of Splenda brown and a half cup of white sugar. I liked the idea of a tang of flavor from the lemon one person recommended, but I didn't have lemons so I added a bit of fresh squeezed mandarin orange juice and a bit of the zest finely grated as well. I always add chocolate chips to banana, pumpkin and zucchini bread, so I added 2/3 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. Also I baked them as muffins because I was hungry and wanted them faster. Also I forgot to add the eggs. I decided to mix all the wet stuff together and all the dry stuff together and then slowly add the dry into the wet with a whisk. It worked beautifully, I just forgot the eggs. Anyway, despite all these modifications the  final result was a tender, yummy and not too heavy banana chocolate chip muffin. (By the way, I added the chocolate chips into the dry mixture before adding it to the wet. The flour coating keeps them from sinking to the bottom.)

How sad was I when I got halfway through mixing this and discovered I had less than 2 T sour cream left. I swear, this never happens to me. ;)  Guess what? It turned out great anyway! In my house of 3 people, it was gone in 2 days. Let's not think about how much banana bread we each consumed. Nope. Not going there.

Like others, I softened the butter then creamed it with the sugar. Fluffy, fluffy batter.

Next batch I might try subbing the vanilla for caramel extract, and drizzling with caramel topping. 'Cause that's just the way I roll.

This is my go to recipe. The sour cream makes the bread very moist. I have tried very ripe bananas and fresh bananas. I personally like the ripe bananas. I like to mash one banana  and slice 2 bananas into the batter, it gives more flavor.

Wow! This is banana bread is amazing! I wanted to make it to bring it to the office but my husband and I can't stop eating it! So moist and delicious. You must try it! I followed the suggestions of one the the reviews below. I creamed the butter and soft (not melted sugar), and used one cup of mashed bananas (3-4 small bananas). I didn't have lemon juice and forgot to add the baking powder. Still was out of this world!

I mashed the bananas, as I was using some rather old ones, and replaced the nuts with chocolate chips. it is so moist and delicious. I will likely be making this every time I have some older bananas no one wants to eat.

This is the absolute best banana bread I've ever eaten.  I doubled the amount of bananas and mashed them instead of slicing them.  This is my only banana bread recipe from now on.

I used brown sugar instead of white and omitted the sour cream. I don't really like the sliced bananas so I'll probably mash them next time. Otherwise, it tasted good!

Very tasty! Just how banana bread should taste! The only alterations I made were to mash the bananas, cook for about 5 minutes longer and add a cinnamon and sugar mixture to the top. Solid recipe!

Change the sugar to 3/4 cup and it's perfect.  Bananas are already sweet so the 1 cup makes it too sweet.

I doubled the recipe because I had to make one bread without the walnuts for my 96 yr old mother who can't eat nuts.....both breads came out extremely moist, something I haven't accomplished with other banana bread recipes. I highly recommend this recipe!

This was my first time at making a dessert.  I had some ripe bananas and just thought about not wanting to throw them out.  This is an easy bake to make.  My only variations were:
I used three banana because they were small; I like many others mashed up the bananas; I only used 1/2 cup of sugar because of the sweet bananas; I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg; and I used sea salt rather than table salt; used 1/2 tsp of baking soda and 1/2 tsp of baking power.  My cooking time was 53 minutes at 350 degrees.  Bread was just right.  Be sure and wait until it is completely cooled to make cutting easy.  Love the taste.

What/What!!  This is one AWEsome banana nut bread!  I thought the use of buttermilk made my bread moist but his takes the cake or should I say the nut.  OH MY GOODNESS.  This is the best.  I followed the recipe exactly, maybe one extra banana, because it was ready for the baking.

Thanks for a quick and easy recipe.  No mixer needed.

This was absolutely perfect! I did take the advice of other reviwers and mashed my bananas and I didn't have sour cream so I used plain yogurt! Cooked for exactly one hour in a glass 9x5 pan. I also added cinnamon to the recipe. My husband doesn't really eat bread or sweets ( ughhh, I know lol) but he LOVED this bread- so I will definitely be making this over and over again!

This was a big hit with my sister! I did modify it b/c i had an extra banana on hand , I made it with 3 bananas. Also added chocolate chips per my sister's request. I do not have a loaf pan, so i poured it into a 9x13 inch cake pan and baked for 30 min. I also mashed the bananas.

It turned out beautifully. For those who have banana issues, here's a tip-freeze the bananas. When you are ready to make this, thaw them completely at room temp. They will be much sweeter and wonderfully mushy. They will incorporate into your batter like a dream.

I can stop looking for a better banana bread recipe now! I did make a few changes though. I reduced the sugar to half a cup (dietary restrictions) and added a eighth teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg and omitted the nuts. I made a mistake and added the sugar to the flour mixture instead of to the melted butter, but it didn't seem to affect the results. I also mashed the bananas. Will definitely  make this again.

Very yummy! My minor changes: mashed the bananas, added some cinnamon and nutmeg, and substituted pecans for walnut and it was delicious! In my oven (gas) it took 70min. My 4-year-old was a huge fan also. Will use this recipe again!

Bravo, Janet! This is my first time making any kind of bread and it was absolutely delicious. I followed instructions according to other reviewers and mashed the bananas. My sister wanted to add chocolate chips, so I used 1/4 cup walnuts and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. This recipe made more like 1 1/2 loaves of bread for me, just a heads up. Loved it!

One of the best banana bread recipes I've tried. Super moist and not too sweet. It's quick and simple. I followed the recipe for the ingredients and cook time, minus the walnuts. I did slice my bananas, but only to throw it into the mix and have my mixer blend/crush them into the batter (think it's the best way to get the most banana flavor out of it). Also, had to bake it an additional 20 minutes as the test poke didn't come out clean at the 1hr mark (could be my oven). Other than that, my family loves it. Will make again in the future. Great way to utilize over-riped bananas. Highly recommend this recipe.

The bread is moist and has a good flavor. Great with honey butter and morning coffee. I made this recipe as written.   I did not give it 5 stars, as another recipe that is favored by my family calls for more bananas (mashed).

A note on all the reviews submitted that mention tweaks, etc.  - those are different recipes and not a true critique of this recipe.   Akin to reviewing a tomato soup recipe, but the cook  tweaked it and used squash instead -  it's not the same tomato soup recipe.   

Let's keep it real.

I made this as muffins so I could freeze some for later. They turned out perfect following directions as written. Since I was cooking for an elderly lady, I left the nuts out. Made 18 muffins.

I left out the sour cream (didn't have any) and used three mashed bananas. A little dense but it was tasty and I would use this recipe again.

I have been making this exact recipe for about  3 years now, I love how moist it always comes out, I usually end up making double because  one loaf doesn't last one night!

I do make sure to mash the bananas  thoroughly, my kiddos don't like chunks!

This really is the best Recipe!    The only thing I did different was to add 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/8 tsp of cloves.    You can't taste it in there, but it gives it a really rich flavor!  Oh...and I mashed the bananas.

The best recipe I've found. I receive tons of compliments every time I make it. I follow the recipe as us with only two variations: 1. Use only 1/4 cup of sour cream, it comes out too moist with 1/2 and 2. Purée the bananas, sliced will only turn dark in the bread, not very appetizing.

Made this recipe twice...the first time I sliced the bananas and the second time mashed them. Both good but I prefer the flavor and texture of the mashed batch better. Thanks so much for sharing this delicious recipe!

This Recipe was Great, however I did make some adjustments as others have done.  replacing apple sauce for butter, half and half brown sugar/white sugar and even did 1/2 cup less of sugar(I tripled the batch), plain greek yogurt for sour cream, added cinnamon and nutmeg, and mashed the bananas.  I did a section with chocolate chips on side, one section with walnuts and one section plain.  Thank-you! It was a big hit! :)

This was fantastic with a couple modifications. Like other suggested, I creamed the sugar with the butter and added enough ripe bananas to fill a one cup measuring cup. I also added banana strawberry Chobani Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and used a white flour/wheat flour blend. You couldn't taste the strawberry at all and it was SO moist!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I made it exactly as written and it is delicious!  I am making a gluten free version this morning. The only substitution being made is (1+1/2 cups of Bob's Red Mill all-purpose gluten free flour with 2+1/4 tsp xanthan gum added) in place of the (1+1/2 cups regular all-purpose flour).  Making this minor substitution turns this recipe into the BEST gluten free banana bread I have ever eaten.  My gluten free friends love it!

I don't add salt, substitute vanilla yogurt for the sour cream, use 3-4 bananas and add a teaspoon of cinnamon... this one of my favorite recipes! Friends and family look forward to me making it. I get "gifted" bananas all the time so I make this on average twice a month.

Moist and delicious! I mash the bananas (adding a bit more than suggested because, hey why not). I also add the cinnamon and cloves that another person recommended. It's divine!

I did make the suggested changes. Creamed soft butter and sugar, added 1 teas. baking powder and mashed the bananas. The results had great flavor and was a moist tender loaf.

This was very delish. My only change would be to smash the bananas instead of just putting the slices in the batter.

Yummy recipe. I followed Naples34102 alternations. I think she should just post her own recipe. haha I made a few of my own alterations though. To cut the sugar in half I put half apple sauce and half sugar equaling the one cup. I also used wheat flour, because I had no white on hand. It still turned out fantastic. I put 1 1/2 cups of wheat instead like the recipe calls for instead of Naples34102 1 3/4 since wheat is thicker. Great! Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent and easy.  I did follow the advice of a couple reviewers and added 1 tsp of cinnamon  and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I also mashed the bananas as others suggested.  Baked for 1 hour at 350.  Delicious and will make it again starting with this weekend for a bake sale!

I checked out the reviews and decided to use 1/3 cup of coconut oil (My hubby's not big on a lot of butter) and Demerara sugar. Used 1 3/4 cup of flour, 1 tsp of baking powder and baking soda and plain yogurt. I also used one cup of mashed bananas. Great recipe! Baked in 50 minutes and evenly. Gonna keep the recipe!

It tasted good and was easy to make. Not the best banana bread I've ever had, but it was moist. I think it would have been better with mashed bananas instead of sliced and a little cinnamon.

I used kefir blueberry yogurt 1/2 cup and 1/2 tsp baking soda as a substitute for the sour cream. I also used 3 bananas and mashed them well. I left out the walnuts as the BF doesn't care for them! Great banana bread!!!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

This bread is delicious!  I can't get my husband to stop eating it.  He seldom reacts that way! 

I really appreciate a large recipe like this one.  Makes four loaves and that gives me one for us, and three to either freeze for later or to share with friends, family or neighbors.  Perfect.

I loved the preparation of the pans!  I've never done that before but what a wonderful treat to have the sides and bottom of the bread lightly coated with sugar and cinnamon!    Also liked the vanilla in the mix.  A very nice, moist and delicious bread!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I also made this recipe one day when I didn't have enough sour cream so I used what I had (about half of what the recipe calls for) and then added Applesauce which gave the bread the needed moisture and also a wonderful bit of extra flavor.

I actually found this to be too rich. A whole stick of butter made it feel very oily to me. I mushed the bananas. Otherwise, followed directions exactly.

I doubled the recipe, left out the walnuts and coarsely mashed previously frozen bananas. Mmm Mmm Good!  Moist and nice texture. Will certainly use this recipe again.

I made this bread yesterday and it was AMAZING!!!!! It is the first time I have ever made bread and I really thought it would take a couple times to master a good bread but I was wrong. First time was a charm and a hit for the whole family. I did read reviews and changed a couple of things. I creamed the r.t. butter with sugar rather than melted butter. I also used 1/2 cup low fat vanilla yogurt rather than sour cream, mashed the bananas, and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Lastly, I used my mixer for the entire batter. After making it this way there is NOTHING I would change for other batches. I still can't believe that I actually made this bread. WOW!!!! Thank you for the recipe and everyone who offered tweaking tips. AGAIN... WOW!!!!!

My family and I were going out of town, and I made this bread to take along with us! I didn't put the nuts because my children prefer most things without nuts. I think I used more bananas ( 3 smaller ones) and I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon! So delicious and so easy to make. Thank you for such a delightful recipe!

This was moist with great flavor. I gave it 4 stars based on how it is written. It's definitely a 5 star once you mash the bananas - and be sure they equal 1 cup, add less sugar (3/4 c) and add a whole cup of walnuts.

It was lovely. I accidentally used pecans instead of walnuts, but no major issue. I really enjoyed this!

I made this banana bread as written, except I had 4 ripe bananas so I put them all in! It was wonderful, very moist and didn't last long. Might be my new favorite recipe.

Was delicious.  Doubled the bananas (mashed), used unmelted butter and added 1tbsp cinnamon, 1tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and allspice for flavor and baked for 55  min. Definitely will make again.

I followed the recipe as written using Kerrygold for the melted butter.  I found the bread to be moist and flavorful.  I used overripe, not yet black, bananas, sliced, and found it less than visually pleasing that the fruit migrated to the bottom and turned a dark color.  A little off-putting in presentation.  I think in the future I will mash the banana and incorporate it in that way.

Really good banana bread. I was shocked when I saw that it takes an hour to cook. I thought that was too long, but no, it does take an hour.

I lost my old banana bread recipe, so I tried this one it seemed similar to my old recipe. I use ripe bananas the riper the better, I  also mashed the bananas with the sour cream to make it look one color then I added the baking soda so it is constant throughout. Then I added the rest of the wet ingredients, then I added a bowl of the rest of the mixed well dry ingredients, and I  didn't put walnuts in this recipe. It stayed ripe and delicious and fresh tasting even after I doubled, and froze a loaf.

I thought this banana bread was exceptional.  I only gave it 4 stars because I made some changes to it.  I read some of the other reviews and based on those, swapped out the sour cream for vanilla yogurt, mashed the bananas instead of slicing them and added a tsp of cinnamon and 1/8 tsp of nutmeg.  I cooked it for exactly an hour and it was perfect.  Delicious topped with a little more vanilla yogurt.

Must mash bananas!! My 1st time making and I wish I would had read the reviews 1st. I was really disappointed with this recipe . I followed the recipe to the letter and the bread came out with sticky purple sliced up bananas throughout the bread.

I mashed the bananas  and used peanut butter chips in place of walnuts. I had very very small places in bread that were still a bit uncooked. Next time will try slicing bananas as per instructions. Even so, bread was delicious.

I've been making banana bread for so many years, however since the kids are grown I don't make like I use to. And when I did start back making & using my old recipe  not everyone ate it, and it was soon thrown out. Boy when I gave this a try it was gone in 2-3 days. I did tweek a little like adding a couple dashes of cinnamon, about 2 Tab. oil. What caught my attention to this recipe was only 2 bananas which was how many I had. Since I've made banana bread so often I didn't even pay attention that the recipe said slice the bananas.(i was so use to mashing mine up & did) As some reviwers said they didn't like them sliced. If I use my  hand mixer I simply put my bananas in a small bowl and beat them with the mixer to get them mashed up. Overall this bread with the added sour cream was the best I had made in a long time. And was super, super moist!!!!! Just the right banana taste!!!!! Will be making again!!!!! (3-10-2017)

Made this last night and it was delish! My husband would've eaten the whole thing if I'd let him. His parents really enjoyed it too, the small slice that my hubby cut them lol.  I only made a few changes to make it slightly healthier and it worked out:). Would definitely make again!

These were very moist and delicious. I substituted coconut oil for butter, brown sugar for white sugar, and lime yogurt for sour cream. I also excluded the nuts, and mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. I added 1/4 t. cinnamon and 1/16 t. nutmeg. I baked them as little mini loaves, for about 25 mins at 350. Will try with some cocoa powder next time.

It turned out fabulous... I sliced my bananas as the recipe suggests and then cut them into quarters. I often add dark chocolate chips for the chocolate fiends in he house (including me).

Delicious! Moist, rich and tasty. I substituted brown sugar which gives it a little more complex and subtle flavor.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have come across so far.  It has a lot of flavor and is nice and moist.   I did tweak the recipe a bit, in that I didn't quite melt the butter, but instead softened it and mixed it with the sugar first.  Then added vanilla, eggs (mixed well), and even sour cream (but I actually subbed in plain greek yogurt because I was curious... it worked well!).  I then folded in dry ingredients and mashed banana (not sliced, I do not prefer large chunks).  I didn't have nuts so I subbed in semi-sweet chocolate chips.  YUM. OH, and I set it for 50 minutes at first because I always like to check in on my baked goods early.  Didnt take much longer than that to be done.   I am actually saving this recipe and will be my go-to for banana bread.  Thank you!

Such a simple and easy to follow recipe. I didn't change a thing.
Make sure you place the bread in a air tight container to ensure maximum moistness.

Made the recipe as called for with only two slight changes. used brown sugar instead of the white sugar, because I like the bit of flavor and moistness it adds.  I also halved the banana and halved again. This way it sliced into quarters and blended very nicely into the bread with nice bits of banana in it! Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I didn't have any baking soda so I used 3 teaspoons of baking powder. I didn't have sour cream so I used vanilla yogurt. This bread still came out awesome. I will be making this again. Maybe I'll try adding chocolate chips next time like another reviewer suggested.

My go to banana bread recipe!  I like to mash the bananas with a fork though, otherwise they are too chunky for my liking.  Otherwise don't change a thing!

Amazing bread!!! If you love sweet bananay bread this is the stuff. Just one recommendation: I put three (instead of 2) bananas in the blender. And it turned out wonderful! I would give this 10000000 stars if I could!!

This is one of the best banana breads that I have ever made. I doubled the recipe and then put it in five mini loaf pans. I have made it as the recipe stated but slightly mashed the bananas and have also eliminated the nuts and replaced them with chocolate chips. I will definitely be making this again.

I've made this banana nut bread several times, and it's wonderful. I did add a cinnamon streusel topping (about 2 tbs softened butter, 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tbsp flour) before baking. It was amazing, not dry like some banana bread, and my little boy loved it!

You can use greek yogurt or sour cream.  I cut the sugar to a  1/2  or 2/3 cup when using really sweet fruit. I also have swapped out the 2 bananas to either 1 banana and some blueberries, strawberries, peaches or even butternut squash so long as the total pureed fruit mixture measures between 1 to 1 1/2 cups.  In addition to the 1/2 C chopped nuts, one could substitute or add to a hand full of dried blueberries, cranberries or cherries. Make it with what you have and/have on hand. My 14 and 16 year olds love this recipe as muffins. Handy as a lunch box snack. Lastly, I add between 1/4 to 1/2  C  oatmeal for additional fiber.

Loved this recipe, and so did my kids.  The only things I did different - one, I mixed my bananas in with a hand mixer, didn't leave them sliced; two, I topped my banana bread with the walnuts instead of mixing them in. Since this was a winning recipe in my house, I will continue to make it.

I have made this bread numerous times now and we LOVE it as well as everyone I share it with. This is the very first recipe I found that mentioned sliced rather than smashed bananas in it and that was an amazing suggestion. Thank you for sharing this recipe.. PS for anyone that is Gluten Free just swap out the flours and it makes a delicious gluten free bread as well ... Tested and confirmed many times ?? ??

This is my go-to recipe! I usually add one banana. Sometimes I use fresh sometimes I use frozen. If I use frozen I usually drain about half of the liquid after they have thawed in a bag.  I've made it with and without nuts. Excellent either way. Thanks for the recipe Janet!

This is the best banana bread recipe that I have found. I mash my bananas and I substitute 1 cup of chocolate chips for the nuts (I can't eat nuts). I have made this recipe over 10 times and it always comes out great!

Excellent! I mashed the bananas per the video. Added chocolate chips instead of nuts. Otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Perfect!

I've made it many times with and without the modifications suggested by other reviewers. The recipe as originally posted gives out a delicious 5-star bread but, as pointed by others, it will be weird looking. Mash, not slice, the bananas. To get a fluffier bread, use 1 tsp each baking powder and baking soda. And soften and cream the butter rather than melt it. It will rise so much a 9x5 loaf pan will not contain it, I get a loaf and 4-5 muffins from the recipe as modified.

This is by far the best banana bread recipe I've tried. Wouldn't change a thing. Super moist, flavors great. I did add a little bit of nutmeg and ginger just for kicks. Yum!

Great recipe! i did substitute heavy whipping cream instead of the sour cream, it didnt seem to make much difference in taste or consistency since the last time i used this recipe.

I've made this twice, once as directed and second with variations. Both times I added an extra banana and mashed them, second time I froze and thawed them. (Btw, frozen bananas look disgusting, but make great flavor!) I replaced quarter of the white sugar with brown. I also replaced most of the sour cream with vanilla Greek yogurt, so I reduced the vanilla in half. Then I used a combo of walnuts and pecans. Cook times always depend on the pan size and oven so I go by smell and don't rely on the directed time. Turned out really good both times! Best banana bread I've ever had!

I agree with the other readers.  This recipe was very easy. The best most moist banana bread ever that I enjoy with my morning tea. I made two loaves, one with nuts and one without nuts for my grandson.

So very good!  I was out of sour cream and substituted vanilla Greek yogurt.  I am also too lazy to slice bananas,  I just tossed them in and let the kitchenaid mash them for me.  
Oh, also made them into muffins because we didn't want to wait an hour for bread.  Made 24 muffins, baked for 20 min.

This was a nice recipe.  I did add a tsp cinnamon and a tsp of lemon juice as other reviews suggested.  I don't think that changed the original recipe......overall a nice moist bread with wonderful banana flavor.  I ended up using 3 ripe bananas and baking it for exactly 65 minutes at 350 degrees.  Came out perfect and cooked evenly. I will definitely be making this again.

Takes longer than an hour in the oven. I've made it twice now and both times it's wet in the middle, but very dark on the outside. Next time I'll try lower temp longer time.

This banana bread was the best I have ever made, and I will continue to use this recipe. The only thing I wish I would have done is add a little bit more banana- about 1/2 of a banana- just to give it more flavor. Also I would recommend mashing the bananas instead of slicing. Otherwise this is an amazing recipe!!

This was definitely tasty and rich.  The only reason I didnt give it the 5th star is because it's texture was more cake-like than bread-like.  I would expect a bread to be more dense.

So easy that my 3 and 7 year old made this and it turned out perfectly.  Light, moist and not too sweet.  We mashed the bananas instead of slicing though, and threw in some white chocolate chips at the end.

This is a fantastic recipe! It is my go to when I am craving banana bread. It is simple to whip up and makes the house smell amazing. The only thing I omit is the walnuts as my kids don't like them but other then that I follow the recipe exactly and it comes out perfect every time.

I use this recipe using 2.5 bananas (mashed),  chocolate chips instead of walnuts, and make it in smaller bread pans, and it turns out amazing! I always get told it's the best banana bread people have ever had.

This review is actually my personal notes, so that I remember what I did to make this recipe perfect:

-  Use 1 cup of bananas and DON'T slice them. It's better if you mash them. 

- Don't "melt" your butter. Use @ room temperature.

-  Use a mixer to cream the butter and sugar first.

- slightly beat eggs before slowing adding them to the batter. 

-  Ad tsp of cinnamon and lemon juice.

- use 1/4 cup  more flour than the recipe calls for

- instead of 1 cup of just white sugar...use 3/4 white and 1/4 brown

This is one of the easiest recipe and one of the tastiest.  My son came home one evening and said he volunteered to bring in banana bread for an office party the following morning.  I didn't have any softened butter and since it was very late had no time to let it soften.  I found this recipe and put it together in no time. I have had several requests for it by my son's co-workers.

The only thing I've done different to this is added some frozen fruit before throwing it in the oven, as well as using 3 thawed ripe bananas. The second time I also  cooked it about 10-15 minutes longer than the original recipe (based on the toothpick test). I haven't met a single person who hasn't agreed that this is one of the best banana bread recipes they've tasted!

Great results. Like others, I creamed butter and sugar together.   Softened butter, not melted.  Mashed ripe bananas equal to one cup. Didn't slice.

I was a little short on bananas, but it was still super moist and yummy! I also softened the butter in the microwave, but didn't completely melt it.

This was amazing. I made a few changes based on comments and what I had on hand.

- mashed 3 bananas with a fork
- used margarine instead of butter and did not melt it.
- used 2% yogurt instead of sour cream
- added a tsp of lemon juice
- added a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and  1/8 tsp nutmeg

Mashed bananas worked great. Even added a third banana and some extra pecans (not walnuts). This type of baking ain't rocket science. It's a personal preference on texture, IMHO. :-)

Very good! I added a 1/2 tsp of Cinnamon and it was fantastic. I particularly loved that I didn't have to mash the bananas. I used fresh bananas not overly ripe ones and they worked great.

I have made this several times and I follow the recipe exactly. It turns out super moist and delicious every time! I only let it cool a few minutes before I wrap it in plastic wrap to let it sweat a little and hold all the gooey moisture in.

Made this for the first time and it's delicious. I have a son who can't eat gluten so I made it with a gluten free flour (and xanthum gum). It took a bit longer to cook but maybe it was due to me opening the oven to smell it so many times. Will be making this again.

This was probably the best banana bread I've ever made. HOWEVER, a couple differences. I mashed up the bananas, not 100% as there were some chunks of banana that were left. And I used about half of brown sugar as well as white. 60 mins at 350 was not nearly enough. I had it in the oven for almost a half hour extra and it was perfect. Not too dark on the outside and still light on the inside. I don't know if it's because I mashed up the bananas and used brown sugar that made it have to cook longer? Either way it turned out great.  Using this recipe from now on!

This Banana Bread was a hit! The first time I made this bread I needed to make two loaves for a church study group. My husband says it's the best banana bread ever! So today I'm making it again. It is really easy to put together. I use extra ripe bananas and I sliced them 1/4" thick and I used pecans instead of walnuts.  Did not have a problem with a mushy bread. I want to make extra loaves and freeze so we can have this year round with company.

This recipe is quick and delicious, just the way it is.  However, I only had one very ripe banana, which I mashed very easily.  I had some blueberries and raspberries to use up; so I  added about 1/4 cup sugar and cooked the berries on the stove top just to boiling.  Let this cool completely and added about 2/3 cup to the banana bread mixture.  Then, I reduced the 1 cup of sugar to 1/4 cup.   Also, I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  It was delicious and really filled my house with wonderful aromas.  TV Foster.

This is the best, most moist banana bread I have ever made! Unfortunately, I didn't have but a 1/4 cup sour cream, however, I did have plenty of Greek yogurt. So instead of making it all sour cream (of which I had light), I used half and half, and let me tell you how great it was! I have to make this normally to truly decide between, but I think it turned out beautifully. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

A no-fail banana bread recipe. I crush the bananas and blend them into the batter instead of the slices. It makes a really moist and tasty banana loaf.

Really moist and yummy banana bread recipe! I made exactly according to the directions except I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them and made sure it was a full cup worth of banana. I also left the walnuts out. Came out wonderfully!! Will make again.

A great base recipe. I mash the bananas instead of putting them in whole (personal preference) and I add cinnamon and nutmeg too. I use greek yogurt instead of sour cream (substituted 1:1) to make it a little healthier and it works great. Very moist. Cooking time for my oven is too long, I suggest cutting the time in half and checking as you go to be sure it isn't over cooked.

My banana bread came out just the way I hoped.  I made some change as suggested by others; added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the vanilla extract as well as crushing the bananas instead of slicing.  It's just the right density and sweetness.
Will be doing this again as soon as I have overripe bananas.

I had some problems making this, but it was my mistake. I had exactly two bananas, so I made the recipe and, whoops, I added twice as much sour cream. Shoot! So, I doubled the batter, divided it, added the bananas to one. And added chocolate chips to the other. They both taste wonderful, especially the crust, but only the banana bread rose and had a nice crown. I will definitely make this again and watch my measurements! Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe!

After reading some reviews, I decided to mash one banana and cut the second one into small pieces. I thought it worked really well. This is a really tasty recipe.

So very good.  I took the most positive reviewers suggestions and added 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp baking powder to mix and mashed the bananas to one cup.   I kept flour ratio the same...but reduced sugar to 3/4 cup.  I served it for breakfast for a girls weekend.  Everyone loved it.  Just finished making another just for me.  Thanks for this recipe.

This is the BEST banana bread I've ever made or had!

A few things were changed up a little.

1) I'm at altitude so I cut the butter by 1 tbsp, added 2 tbsp of water, and lowered the baking temp to 325. 

2) Didn't add walnuts.

3) Mashed two bananas, previously frozen. 

4) Sprinkled cinnamon in at the end. 

5) Used a 9-inch pie pan because I forgot I ditched old loaf pans and haven't replaced them!

The BEST!

Love this recipe! Made some changes, mostly due to a depleted pantry. Subbed vanilla bean Greek yogurt for the sour cream. And used 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. And like many others, I mashed the bananas and used three not two. I like the intense flavor and I needed to use them. At the suggestion of another reviewer I also added a tsp of baking powder. For my own taste, I added about 3 tsp cinnamon and 1 1/2 tsp cloves. This banana bread is so moist and full of flavor, it's perfect for breakfast or afternoon tea.

This recipe was fantastic! I didn't have sour cream, so I substituted plain Greek yogurt and I didn't have walnuts so I added apple, but other than that I went by the recipe and it turned out fantastic!

This recipe was so good! My husband hates banana bread and even he liked it. I skipped the walnuts because I'm not keen on them and added a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. Delicious!

I made it into muffins and mashed the bananas a bit more and cooked them for about 20-25 minutes. They are delicious, very moist, and have overall great flavor!

This was amazing!  Though I was a bit skeptical about slicing the bananas, leaving not enough banana flavor to permeate the bread.  I was wrong!  It turned out absolutely amazing!  Moist, very banana-y.  I am making it again today, but will smash the bananas, as I already had them in the freezer and too ripe to slice.

I want to keep this one.  I did a substitute though.  I put in 1 single serving size of unsweetened applesauce in place of 1/2 a stick of the butter (the recipe calls for a stick of butter which is 1/2 cup of butter, so I only used 1/4 cup of butter).  And it turned out awesome!  So moist and tasty.  I did add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  You need salt to enhance the sweet.  :-)

This is great. My family loved it. Next time I will have to double the recipe so it lasts longer then a couple of days. I did mash the bananas rather than slice them. This recipe will replace my old one.

Came out beautifully! Delicious. Tip : I took the bananas, fork mashed slightly and then added the wet ingredients together. Pressed dough cycle and let blend together nicely about minute. Then I stopped the machine, added vanilla extract and all the dry ingredients to basket. Started a new bake cycle.

I used plain 100% Fage Greek Yogurt in place of the Sour Cream, egg whites in place of the eggs,  pure cane sugar in place of white, and organic unbleached white flour. This banana bread was one of the best I've ever made, my family loved it!!  So moist and delicious! It's nice to know with a few healthy variations it still tastes amazing!!

We made cupcake muffins and instead of fresh bananas we used bananas that had been overripe and frozen.  We let them thaw and mushed into the recipe and it turned out perfectly.   Definitely a 'go-to' recipe for our overripe and frozen banana leftovers!

Used 3 bananas mashed, half white sugar half light brown sugar. I can't use any nuts because some family members have allergies. This recipe( with my minor modifications) is just the best, and I have tried many, many banana bread recipe's!

I tried this recipe the best banana bread. Very moist and light. I added Nutella chocolate spread by mixing 2Tbls of Nutella with some sour cream. Put half the batter in the loaf tin then added the Nutella and then added the rest of the batter. It came out beautiful. ??????????used a knife to cut through the batter before to put the batter into the oven. I used pecans instead of walnuts as walnuts were not available.

This is the best banana bread recipe I've ever tried. It's very moist, fluffy but dense, and extremely tasty. I mashed and pureed the bananas instead of cutting them just because they were too mushy to slice. I'm never using another banana bread recipe for as long as I live, though, I'll tell you that

Will definitely make this again. I mashed the bananas and  I suggest you make more than 1 if you have 10 grandchildren so that you can have a whole slice.

This is by far the best banana bread I've had in ages! I make it straight up, no modifications required (except to mash the bananas more when making for my daughter who doesn't like the chunks.....)  It's sheer perfection - thank you!

This is the best banana bread I've ever made. I first watched the video which had a couple of tips that I wouldn't have thought of. I mashed the banana instead of slicing it. I omitted the nuts and replaced them with a half bag of mini chocolate chips (folding hem in when the nuts would have been folded in). My hubby isn't a huge banana bread fan but has approved this as not just a breakfast item, but also as a desert!

I quadrupled the recipe. Additionally, I turned the first 2 loaves after 30 minutes, due to hot spots in the oven.  This left a split on the top center lengthwise.  The second two loaves were not moved and they turned out great, so don'move them once they are in the oven.  

It's great, though I think it needs more nuts!

I did alter just a bit.  I substituted vanilla non fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream an a tsp of almond extract.  The substitution of Greek yogurt adds a little protein for the grandkids.

This is the best recipe for banana bread! I've searched for banana bread recipes with all the same results- too dry! Not this recipe! The banana bread I made was to die for! It was moist, delicious, and the aroma of bananas was out of this world. (I used 3) Do not use a blender or mixer. Mix it by hand, melt the butter, mash the bananas and watch it closely while it is baking. I did not cover it with foil to prevent over browning. Also, use a regular aluminum pan. Do not use glass or a dark non-stick pan. All ovens are slightly different. I baked my loaf for 70 minutes@ 325 on convection bake (gas stove). Thanks for sharing this absolutely awesome recipe!

This was really good! I have a recipe I'd been using for years but it's really dense, so I wanted to try something new. This was much lighter in texture but had the same great flavors! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and mashed my bananas. I also toasted my walnuts first. DELICIOUS!

This is a moist loaf.  I've made this recipe several times and every time it has turned out well. The only thing that I consistently change in the recipe is mashing the banana instead of slicing it, and added chocolate chips instead of the walnuts (nut allergies). This time I substituted a quarter of the sugar and the half cup of sour cream with coconut flavoured yogurt.  it turned out well too!

The only thing I did differently was use whole milk plain yogurt because I did not have sour cream and did not use nuts due to allergies. The bread is moist and tasty. I did mash the bananas as they were too ripe for slicing,

The most delicious banana bread I have ever made.  I have made it several times now.  Added chocolate chips once to good effect.  I have never actually made it with walnuts, but I can't imagine it would be detrimental.  So delicious!  I do mash the bananas rather than slice them.

i've been looking for a good banana bread recipe and I think I found it. My husband loves banana bread but I've always had trouble getting it moist enough. This one with the sour cream really is the best. I used 2 bananas as suggested and I mashed them and I added a cup of walnuts as my husband loves nuts.

I made this for my mother's weekly coffee clutch gathering. Everyone raved about it and thought it was the best. I'm not a fan of bananas or banana bread but this was pretty good. If you are looking for a banana bread recipe I would suggest that you use this one. I did mash the bananas because I thought it distribute better in the bread. I also added a teaspoon of baking powder and baked at 325 for an hour and fifteen minutes and it came out perfect.

A consistent favorite in our family. If I don't have sour cream, I substitute yogurt (if the yogurt is already sweetened, I cut the amount of sugar in the recipe.)

I used squash instead of banana and I didn't have flour so I used cornstarch. It did not turn out. It was rubbery and nasty. It almost burnt my house down with it.

I loved this, though I did enhance it by a) adding a streusel filling in the middle,  b) adding a handful of coconut, and c) a handful of chocolate chips.  Had to bake for 1:05.

I made it just like the recipe here except I used 3 small very ripe bananas so I couldn't slice them so I mashed them in and it was the best banana nut bread I've ever tasted. I wasn't sure why it calls for sour cream but I think it makes the recipe very moist and it was absolutely delicious. Definitely making this again.

This was amazing! Not only was the banana bread perfect, this recipe can be used in so many ways. I substituted the walnuts with chocolate chips and it came out phenomenal. I'm planning to use this same recipe with lemon and poppyseed.

Terrific recipe.  Followed the recipe as posted (except for walnuts); didn't have them on hand.  I did mash the bananas (2 large), and it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe; it's a go to for banana bread.

In all the years I have been baking I never had banana bread that was this tasty  as well as moist.  It was the best banana bread I have ever had and I will continue to use this recipe.  I baked it at 350 for 40 minutes then dropped the temp to 325 for the last 20 minutes.  It was perfect in looks , texture and taste.  I didn't slice the bananas but chopped them into pieces about the size of malted milk balls..  Thank You for sharing the recipe!!  5* doesn't do it justice!!

Great recipe, always get compliments on this. I use chocolate chips and walnuts since I love those two in my banana bread, and it really adds a great flavor. Using reallly ripe bananas is key!

Awesome recipe! So moist and tasty! I followed the suggestions to mash bananas and substituted the sour cream with plain  Greek yogurt. I also added chocolate chips and left out the nuts. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is a wonderful recipe. I made a few tweeks, I did not have sour cream so I substituted plain yogurt, I also browned my butter. Another thing I like to add to banana bread is a zest of an orange. I add that in with the sugar and the butter.

This is a fantastic recipe and I use it as my only recipe.  However, can some one explain the "servings" issue?  I have seen many recipes with servings that are insane for what you are making.  A  single loaf of banana bread is not 15 servings.  Maybe if it was as long as a regular loaf of bread, but not in a loaf pan.  Be realistic!!!!!!

This is a good base recipe for banana bread.  I prefer banana bread to be a bit sweeter.  Next time, I will double sugar content . Other than sweetness, bread was great.

I've made this several times now and it has turned out pretty well every time.  I do make one substitution, because we always have it on hand and we rarely ever buy sour cream, and that is to use Lime Greek yogurt in its place. I usually find it takes around 80 minutes to get done rather than the recommended 60. In addition to the normal loaf,  I just made it into 48 mini-muffins and all I did was shorten the baking time and they turned out well. If you try this,  you can fill the muffin tins pretty full.

So good! I've made with sour cream and I've subbed greek yogurt for the sour cream. Great both ways. I agree to mash bananas instead of chopping them.

At first I was skeptical about slicing,and not mashing, the bananas. This recipe is perfect as written

This is my go to banana bread recipe. The only thing I did different is I use 3-4 very ripe bananas, mashed, and I add mini chocolate chips and walnuts. I make this at the fire station all the time and the guys go crazy over it. Highly recommended

I’ve been making a recipe like this for years. I use room temp butter. I switch the order up. Add bananas and sour cream before the flour. Then I don’t have to mash the bananas beforehand. Moist and tasty!

I have made this recipe several times and always get rave reviews. Sometimes I use 2 bananas, other times I use 3. I firmly believe the key to a nice, rich banana flavor is to use overly ripe bananas. I wait until the outer skin on the bananas is very spotted and the fruit very soft or squishy. My husband is sure they need to be thrown out at this point, but they are perfect for this recipe. I, like other reviewers, like to mash the bananas before adding to the other ingredients and add 1/4-1/2 tsp cinnamon. Delicious!

Excellent Banana Bread.  It was moist and not too sweet.  I received several requests for the recipe.  I didn't leave the bananas simply sliced.  I mashed them up because I don't like the site of mushy hunks of banana in my bread.

Excellent recipe! The only difference that I do is I blend the banana and sour cream together after I mash the banana with a fork. Then I take that mixture and add it in with everything else and have everything thoroughly blended as a whole.  I tried it as the recipe stated the first time and like others said the texture was a bit off and there were chunks of banana so the flavor wasn't consistent.   Mashing the banana and blending everything together with a mixer makes everything come together perfectly. I make this once or twice a month and it's a staple in our house.

I subbed in Greek yogurt for the sour cream and used coconut oil, added cinnamon, almond and vanilla extract. Kids at daycare loved it, grown ups at work loved it.

This has been a fav so far.  The batter was very thick following the directions exactly so I added one mashed banana (since I had an extra).  It turned out beautifully.  I love the sliced or chunks of banana in the finished bread.  Though practically unnoticeable visually, it's a nice, palatable surprise to have spots of added moistened flavor in a bite.  I do think the third mashed banana was essential for texture, moisture and flavor.  It baked up beautifully but did require an additional 10 minutes.  This is a keeper.

Followed the recommendations of another user and used softened butter, baking powder AND baking soda, lemon juice, and 1 cup of mashed bananas.  It was perfect!  My husband even said that this was a keeper.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have come across. It is incredibly moist inside and the texture is amazing. One thing I did change was mashing the bananas instead of slicing them. Other than that, I didn't change a thing and it turned out delicious!

So delicious!  I took the advice of other reviewers and did not melt the butter, but creamed room temp butter with the sugar.  I also mashed my bananas.  I was worried that you could taste the sour cream, but couldn't at all.  Very good.  Will definitely use this recipe in the future.  Thank

Fantastic recipe even after substituting applesauce for the butter. Super moist and still very rich tasting. Deviations: I added cinnamon to the batter and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking.

Perfect!  I didn't mash bananas at all.  Sliced thin and made exactly as listed and my wife says it's the best she's ever eaten.  I did cook 10 less, but you know how ovens are and mine is 46 years old and is never accurate.  Perfectly moist and delicious.

this recipe is fantastic. I make it over and over again. I usually substitute greek yogurt for the sour cream and it is always a fan favorite.!!

This is the most wonderful banana bread I've ever had! It's very moist, doesn't fall apart too badly, and tastes amazing! The only thing I changed was using coconut sugar instead of white sugar (to make it healthier.)

This is so great!! I used melted margarine and added a teaspoon of baking powder. I also pureed the bananas with a little half and half. I left out the sour cream and the walnuts because my family doesn't like walnuts in their banana bread unfortunately. hope yours comes out as good and mine.

My first try was a success. I did however made a few changes:
Make sure the banana is over-ripe and mashed, instead of sour cream I use banana yogurt and double the amount of walnut. It is incredible delicious...

I recommend flouring the pan as well as greasing it or it might stick. The first time I made it, I did not flour the pan, and the loaf came out in pieces. It still tasted good though.

Very moist and yummy. I didn't have sour cream so I substituted with vanilla yogurt (as is, not strained). I also added some cinnamon. It  turned out lovely. I will be making this banana bread again.

This was absolutely delicious, but mostly because I followed the advice of the reviewer that said mush the bananas, add both baking soda and baking powder, and do a full cup of banana.  Two bananas only yielded 3/4 a cup so I did three bananas to make the full cup. Also, 350° made the crust on my loaf like a rock so I turned it down to 325° and had to cook it a little longer to save the loaf. I cut away some of the nasty edges and the end result was delicious. Simply delicious. 4 stars because of all the necessary changes the original recipe needed. 5 stars for the helpful reviewer's version.

This recipe is delicious and my new favorite.  I followed the recipe as shown.  As I have made banana bread recipes for man years, this is the first recipe I've tried which includes sour cream.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Great recipe and everyone raved about it. I mashed the bananas, softened the butter but didn't melt it, and didn't add the walnuts. The bread is delicious toasted lightly with butter.

We love it! My son says this is his favorite among all the things I make, so now today I'm making this (but as  jumbo muffins instead of a loaf) so he can take some back to college. I follow the recipe as written, with the exception that I mash the bananas (and used three since they are on the smaller size). Today I also added some of the leftover topping from the Thanksgiving sweet potato casserole (recipe also on this website); topping was brown sugar, flour and nuts). Yummy!

This is the best banana bread recipe, it has amazing flavor and great light texture. Also very forgiving, I made some variations like I used coconut oil instead of butter, 2 teaspoons baking powder because I can't stand the taste of baking soda, all Demerara brown sugar, 1 teaspoon grounded cinnamon plus  1/8 tsp nutmeg .  I did mash the bananas together with the sugar,  cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg. Everyone wanted seconds, even the finicky grown ups. Thanks for posting :)

Love this recipe. Yogurt works fine instead of sour cream too, it's one of those recipes that you can play around with a bit and still comes out delicious. Adding chocolate chips is a big hit with the toddler too.

One of the best banana breads I've had. I mashed my thawed frozen bananas and added 1/2 tsp ground cardamom. I also substituted yogurt for the sour cream and 3 tsp baking powder for the 1 tsp baking soda. It was really good!

Used plain Greek yogurt because we had no sour cream- turned out WONDERFUL. Made the very slight tweaks as another reviewer mentioned and made sure we mashed the bananas to equal 1 cup. (Cream the room temp butter/sugar, 1 3/4 c flour, 1t each baking sofa/powder. ) This is now our go-to banana bread recipe.

This recipe is great, although I will admit to making a few adjustments... 
1. I mash the bananas as I, like may others, am not a fan of the strange texture the sliced bananas have in the finished product; 
2. I use 1 TBSP of vanilla rather than a tsp. It was a happy accident while baking one morning before my coffee had taken effect; 
3. I substitute the sour cream with a 1/2 C of banana yogurt. It keeps the banana bread nice and moist while adding a little more banana flavor.

This recipe most resembles  the killer banana bread my mom made when I was a kid. Just a couple of minor tweaks and BOOM...BANANA BREAD HEAVEN! I suggest mashing the bananas and also I creamed the sugar and butter together. I didn't' melt the butter room temp. is the way to go when creaming the sugar and butter together. All in all it's a wonderful recipe!

This is the most moist banana bread that I have ever had! I must add that I took the advice of naples34102 when making this. I mashed 1 cup of bananas, added 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, used 1 teaspoon of both baking soda and baking powder and increased the flour to 1  3/4 cup.  I will certainly add this recipe to my favorites!

It turned out great and was easy. I substituted Greek plain yogurt for the sour cream.  Of course I mashed the bananas even though it doesn't specify.  I used a glass loaf pan so reduced the time by 5 min.  It was nicely browned.  Delicious and I'll save as a favorite.

Delicious and very moist, but using sliced bananas instead of mashed was a Problem for one of the people I was feeding - she didn't appreciate the chunk of fruit in her breakfast. ??

The sour cream gives the banana bread a tangy taste and I decided I'm not a fan of it. This banana bread for me was more wet, not moist,  like it was under cooked but it was all really brown  and the toothpick came out clean.

Very tasty. I used it as a jumping off place. I used brown sugar and honey for the sweetness and I doubled the recipe. I did not bother with slicing the bananas. It seemed a bit flat, but I am unsure about my baking soda's freshness. The sour cream is a great addition.

Finally I have a banana bread recipe I can  be proud of.  I just made three loaves today (11-20-16) because I had a bunch of ripe bananas to use.  It's super easy to make, but mostly it really is moist and good.  I've never made very good banana  bread before, even using my Mom's recipe, I never got it quite right, but I hear my boyfriend in the kitchen right now cutting off another slice (he loves it), and this is going to be my banana bread recipe from now on.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  It's perfect just the way it was.

I didn't slice the bananas (I am always looking for a use for over ripe bananas), but mashed instead.  Otherwise, I didn't make any changes to the recipe and we loved it.  Moist and not too dense.  Good crust.

Addendum 3/18/17:  I am going to try the recommendation for 325 degree oven for 1 hr 15 min.  The last 2 times I've made it the very center/top was still wet.

Soft and tender, it didn't last long in our house. Just like the other reviewers, I mashed the banana instead of slicing it. I also creamed room temp butter with the sugar.  This is a keeper.

As recommended by other reviewers, I 1+ c. mashed  banana and, creamed the sugar and butter, used 1 3/4 c. flour, 1 t lemon (or more), 1 t. each baking soda AND powder, and substituted pecans for walnuts (don't like em).  It was absolutely the best banana bread I've had.... ever.

Made this following recipe word for word.  I was sceptical about slicing, not mashing the bananas and didn't read the other reviews.  You definitely need to mash the bananas.  I gave this recipe 5 stars because its moist, delicious and better than store bought banana bread - as per my picky teenager!

Great recipe! I opted to mash my bananas and use half brown sugar and half white.  Baked at 350 for 55 minutes...delish!

Only because I didn't have a bread loaf pan I opted to making them as muffins and reduced the time they cooked to 40 minutes watching closely. They turned out fabulous!! I also sliced the bananas thin and they turned out really good.

Best banana bread recipe ever. I don't like banana bread but this one is great. The sour cream adds a lot of richness and texture to it. I also added mint choc chips.

Banana bread was really good. Changed white sugar to brown sugar, white flour to whole wheat flour and used 3 bananas instead of 2. Making this next weekend again for sure.

This banana bread is very moist and tender but.....it needs more banana flavor.  Will add a teaspoon of banana flavoring next time.  Also, I mashed the instead of  slicing.

Wow this is wonderful!!  Used three mashed bananas and 1/2 cup Oikos Triple zero banana cream yogurt and I didn't add nuts. (personal choice)  I will never make banana bread any other way. My search is over!

Best banana bread I have ever made, hands down! And I have made a LOT of banana bread using different recipes. It is so moist and delicious! The color is beautiful when it comes out of the oven. I did change the process  of how I prepared the batter...I creamed SOFTENED butter with the sugar instead of adding melted butter. Also, I mashed the bananas rather than just slice them because I wanted to ensure the banana flavor was throughout the bread. I added a tsp of baking powder and a half tsp of cinnamon, too. Baked for exactly 60 minutes and it turned out perfectly. This is my go-to banana bread recipe from now on. Thank you!

This is the foundation of a great banana bread. In my opinion you can experiment with it if you want. I think the bananas should be mashed instead of sliced and that substituting some brown sugar for some of the white will give it a richer more complex flavor. Adding some cloves or allspice will also make the bread more unique. I have book marked this recipe and my second loaf is baking as I type this. How many times have you tasted a subpar and dry banana bread? You will not be that person if you use this recipe :)

I made it at least 20 times, I always triple the recipe and freeze most. Comes out perfect after freezing. Have also added semi sweet choc chips and/or M&M's for an extra treat. Also have used dried cranberry and Blue berry's just to mix things up a bit. Not all at the same time but in different batches. Never a complaint! I even did is once as a bunt!

The only thing changes I made was adding 1/3 cup of brown sugar and also mashing the bananas into the mixture as you would with a traditional recipe. It may have made no difference whatsoever but either way it turned out beautifully and I'm about to make a double batch due to the fact that between myself, husband and my son the first loaf barely lasted 24 hours before disappearing

This is the best banana bread I have ever made and I have tried several different recipes over the years. It was really moist. I made a few changes though. I added 1tsp of cinnamon, mashed the banana instead of slices, and used 1/2 cup sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar. The addition of sour cream makes all the difference.

This is my go-to recipe (with a few modifications).  I was advised by the best baker I know to always add an extra banana to any banana bread recipe I try, so I use 3 *mashed* bananas.  I only made it with *sliced* bananas once, and the texture was so mushy and odd that my kids (who love banana bread) wouldn't touch it.  I also bake it in 3 mini (5x2.5x2) loaf pans for exactly 45 minutes.

This cake is so easy to make and is so good. The sour cream was perfect to make the cake better. The only thing I changed is the sugar. I put brown sugar and not white.

I love this recipe! It's so forgiving. I've made it with so many substitutions, and every time, it comes out great. This last time, I subbed homemade applesauce instead of the butter, and plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I also halved the sugar (because of the applesauce), and it so so delicious!

I make this every couple of weeks.  It's really tasty and moist.  I sometimes add half a cup of dried cranberries or coconut and often substitute pecans for the walnuts.  All around easy and delicious.

Very simple to make! Done differently: mashed bananas not sliced, blended sugar with room temp butter instead of melted butter, added one extra banana and yum. It came out so moist and delicious!

I made the following changes as suggested by a previous reviewer. 1 & 3/4 c white flour, 1 tsp baking powder with 1 tsp baking soda, 1/8 tsp salt. I sifted the dry ingredients together. I creamed the butter with the sugar, then added the 2 large beaten eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp lemon juice and the sour cream folded into the wet ingredients. Then mixed, by hand, the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Oh I also added just a pinch of Indonesian cinnamon.  And 1/2 cup of rough chopped walnuts...my husband loves walnuts. Me too!

Best banana bread ever. So moist and delicious. Make sure you mash your bananas instead of cutting them and you should add lots of chocolate chips.

The only change I made was mashing the bananas.  Personal preference is not to have chunks of banana in my bread.  Other than mashing the bananas, I made no changes.  We LOVED it.  This will be the recipe I use when I make Banana Bread again.

Used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, 3 bananas instead of 2, and didn't use walnuts & added 1 cup of milk chocolate chips with a sprinkle of chocolate chips on top. My husband definitely loved it and thought this was the best recipe yet. I will make this again for sure! Thanks for the recipe.
PS the second time I made this I used 3 frozen bananas (that were frozen still in their skins) we had in our freezer. My husband freezes bananas that are getting too brown to use in his smoothies. I was a little worried. I had defrosted them overnight in the refrigerator and they will looking pretty goopy. It turned out beautifully! So amazing!

Made this today and this recipe is easy to follow and the banana bread turned out moist and delicious. The only thing I did change was I mashed the bananas instead of just slicing them. It turned out delicious though! I'm glad I made this, and my husband is too! :)

I took the suggestion of another, adding 1 tsp each of baking powder and baking soda, mashed the bananas(equalling 1 c.) and used 1 3/4 c. flour instead.  

Next time I will add a bit of cinnamon :)

I am a fan of banana bread and I really liked how the sour cream made this one moist and added a bit of a lighter note to the taste. I used as much sugar as the recipe called for, but made it half white sugar and half packed dark brown sugar. It makes the banana bread a little richer in flavor. Also, I lightly mashed the bananas, (so they were still a bit chunky), instead of slicing them because it didn't sound good to bite into a piece of very ripe banana.

I found the recipe easy to follow. I only gave the original recipe 4 stars because I did make some minor changes as I saw suggested by another lady. The changes are that I creamed the butter with the sugar rather than melting the butter, I added 1 tsp of lemon juice with the vanilla, used 1 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder, and 1 3/4 cups of flour. The last minor change was that I mashed my bananas instead of slicing them. The loaf turned out wonderfully moist and my whole family enjoyed it. I definitely have a new favourite banana bread recipe!??

Will add this to my rotation of baking favorites! It was full of moist, delicious banana flavor. Was gone in moments after coming out of the oven. Followed the recipe but my loaf pan was smaller so I added 10 minutes to the baking time. Have to watch it carefully or it will crust over too quickly. I may buy a bigger loaf pan just for this recipe!

Always reliable, always delicious. I added a little more than a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and made muffins with the batter by cooking them at the same temperature for about 22-25 minutes.

Based upon the numerous ratings I decided to make this recipe the way that the contributor meant it to be. It was the perfect choice. It is a delicious bread without changing anything. This will be my new "go to" banana bread recipe. Next time I will double it to have an extra loaf to freeze! Thank you for this yummy bread recipe.

Best banana bread I've ever had. I believe the sliced bananas make a big impact on the concentrated taste. I substituted coconut oil for the butter--a decision I rarely regret. Also prepared in a small casserole dish because I didn't have a loaf pan available. I would do it all exactly the same again. There is likely going to be more of this bread in my future  with each bunch of overripe bananas.

This was perfect. I got a killer deal on clearance bananas at Walmart ($1 for six bananas! Yeah, I know that sounds sketchy, but hey, you know clearance bananas are going to be totally ready for banana bread!), so I doubled the recipe and my son, daughter, and I thoroughly enjoyed every last crumb (my weirdo husband doesn't like banana bread).

ETA: I didn't slice the bananas. I had my son mash them and then tossed them in the mixer.

First time making a banana bread and it was very easy and very delicious. My mom used to make banana bread all the time when I was a little kid and I remember eating it all day everyday. Now I'm all grown up I've been wanting to give it a try to make it myself. So I followed this recipe and just changing only 4 things. First, I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. Second, I used 3 bananas instead of 2 thinking maybe it will give more banana flavor (I was just experimenting). Third, I smashed the bananas instead of slicing them (I followed the suggestion of the other reviewers). Maybe next time I'll try to slice them instead of smashing just to see the difference. Lastly, I baked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes. To be honest, first I set my timer to 50 minutes on 350 degrees just in case so I can check on it and it was pretty obvious that it wasn't ready yet. So I added another 10 minutes, which was on the recipe. After 10 minutes, I checked it again and it wasn't still ready so I added another 10 minutes. I believe it was okay at that moment but I wasn't satisfied so I added another 5 minutes and it was finally done. So the other reviewers were right about baking it for an hour and 15 minutes and then let it sit for about 10-20 minutes before slicing them. It was very delicious and super moist and my boyfriend loved it! It was our dessert. He couldn't resist and he had 2 slices because it was really good and he also had it for breakfast. *NOTE: I used toothpick to check it i

Need the help of one of the expert cooks out there.  Have made this many times and it always turns out great, except for today.  I always make a double recipe sometime with just bananas, sometimes also add other berries.  Today followed the recipe as always using the same two loaf pans and the batter was the usual consistency and filled the loaf pans to the same level. However after 20-30 minutes the batter was liquid and frothy and spilled out of both pans.  End result was bread that tasted OK but did not rise.  What could have gone wrong?  Only difference I can think of was the sour cream was past the expiration date but smelled and tasted fine, could this be it?  Help!

This was delicious. I tweaked it a little following some of the reviews. I softened the butter and creamed it with the sugar first. I also used three bananas and mashed them. Don't overstir! This made 22 muffins and I baked for 20 minutes at 350. Delicious and so good. Very fluffy.

This turned out great, very moist. The bananas I used were too ripe to slice so I mashed them and it was really good. I will try slicing next time with firmer bananas, kinda curious about that.

Janet's Rich Banana Bread Recipe was exceptionally tasty. I doubled the recipe, added 2 teaspoons of Vanilla Extract and mashed 3 bananas instead of slicing. 4. I also cut the sugar in half (wanted lightly sweetened bread, instead of cake) I felt that would be better. Melting the butter is an excellent idea. Those I shared my bread with said they could taste the butter while chewing. Each time I'd wake up during the night, I'd cut a small slither of it. It is irresistibly delicious... moist, tender, with just the right amount of banana flavor. Thank you Janet!

Sincerely Geri

Huge hit with the office. It was my first and only banana bread, and it will not be the last. Can't wait to make it again. Like many others, I encountered local difficulties/ conditions and had to adapt. I didn't have nuts, so that was missing. Threw in some chocolate chips, and cut back the sugar a bit. I did put in some baking powder per others' suggestion, and then threw in some cinnamon and cardamom for good measure. None of the changes harmed the outcome. Thank you so much for the recipe!

II followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing..  I think the difference had to do with the sliced bananas instead of mashed.  I sliced them in the egg slicer.
This is now my go to recipe.

This was my 1st time making it, following this recipe. It was the moistest banana bread I've ever had, my family loves it.  My husband  doesn't eat bananas but he devoured this bread. I will definitely make it again & will change a few things.

Really delicious!  I made both with and without chocolate chips, it was hard to say which we liked best.  I did add 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Can't imagine not adding those spices they just add so much flavor.  Will definitely make again and again!

Excellent three times!!!!  Took Naples suggestion and creamed the sugar and butter 'til light and fluffy;  makes a difference IMO.  Somehow I couldn't see sliced bananas so I mashed them and glad I did.  Again, excellent recipe.  Thanks!!!

I made some variations to this recipe to try to make it a bit healthier. I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce to lower the fat. I used a stevia/sugar blend instead of regular sugar. Trust me, the bananas themselves are plenty sweet already. I used greek yogurt to replace the sour cream. And because I couldn't help myself I added a handful of dark chocolate chips. The results turned out great! Now I can enjoy it without feeling too guilty for eating a second slice. :)

I love how moist this banana bread is! The sour cream really makes a difference. Only thing I changed was to mash the bananas up a bit before putting them in, rather than slicing them.

In the oven now, using Naples34102's recommendations, with two minor changes, I added 1 1/3 c mashed bananas and added about 1/3 c semi sweet chocolate chips. Can't wait to try it! Will update my rating once it's been tested ??

I made the doubled version provided for the original recipe, increasing the flour by 1/2 cup.  I roasted the walnuts before adding to the batter.  A lovely, moist loaf.  I will make again.

I stumbled on to this recipe a few years ago when I was looking for something to make with those last few "going bad" bananas.  This was so easy to put together and turned out extremely well. I think I have used this over 50 times since I found it!  My "tweaks" are that I added an extra banana and mashed them instead of slicing. I also have use Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream (when I realized mid-mixing that I didn't have any sour cream!) and it turned our wonderfully!  I have made it with and without the walnuts and both are delicious - A "must" recipe!!

This recipe turned out PERFECT for me! The banana bread turned out really moist. I did mash up the bananas just as others recommended (plus I've only made banana bread with mashed up bananas) and I added 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of walnuts! Definitely recommend this recipe to others! :)

This is an easy recipe as well as delicious.  I spaced out when making this today and did not adjust for my high altitude. Despite the fallen middle, the bread was delicious - a slight crunch on the outside and moist on the inside.  It generally turns out much better than today's but I didn't hear any complaint from dh!  I do mash the bananas first, and decrease baking soda (+ baking powder) to 1/2 teaspoon - well except for today lol. For others at higher altitude, increase the oven temp a bit, do not over mix the batter and put in a cup of water in a separate ovenproof dish and don't forget to decrease the leavening hahaha.

I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream since that is what I had on hand.  Took it to work and it was a hit.  Will make again.

Amazing treat!  I creamed the butter and sugar, and used the Brandied Candied walnut recipe on this site and just put them on top of the batter for those who don’t like them. So delicious. I think the sour cream is wonderful in it.

Best banana bread ever!  I added a bit extra sour cream, a third banana, and pecans instead of walnuts. It is moist and tasty--especially heated a little and with a light spear of butter.

This is my go to banana recipe. Ive made it about 5 times so far. I usually double it, and always smash the bananas. Today, I decided to get creative, and added 1 tablespoon coconut oil, 1 tsp nutmeg and cinnamon, and 1 tsp lemon juice. Its delicious!

Great recipe. I made it gluten-free by switching the all- purpose flour with 1 cup gluten-free flour mix and 1/2 cup coconut flour. I spiced it up with a heaping 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  I also mashed the bananas and folded them into the batter. I turned out delicious and moist.

This bread came out great! my family loved it but for me I would cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. the only only changes I made were greek yogurt instead of the sour cream and omitted the nuts. No other changes needed as far as we are concerned. Thanks for sharing Janet!!

Hands down the best banana bread recipe I've ever tasted.  There are so many great reviews that it's redundant at this point but I will never use another recipe. I was skeptical of using sour cream but it really makes the recipe.  I smashed my bananas up first and used a mixer.  Otherwise made exactly as written.

This recipe is simple and delicious.  :) Made a few minor alterations to the recipe: Added  3.9 oz of unsweetened, organic apple sauce (for moisture and added flavor), used 2 1/2 mashed browned bananas (for moisture and flavor) and 3/4 cup chocolate chips (Allergy to nuts).  In addition,  I  ended up having to make cooking time changes due to pan size. I used an 8X4, generic foil pan.  375F for 18 minutes, then 350F for 28 minutes = 46 minutes cooking time*. * If you find yourself in the same situation with pan size, cooking time may still vary depending on the pans material (glass vs metal), thickness and oven temperature settings.

Our favorite banana bread recipe.  The only thing I do differently is I mash the bananas instead of slicing them.  Perfect.

Live overseas--can't get sour cream.  However, unsweetened Greek yogurt is an excellent substitute (and makes me feel a bit more virtuous when I eat a second piece)!!  I use half pecans and half chocolate-chips to make it "fancy" when I want to send it in to the kids' school.  It is also a great way to use the one "bad" banana that always seems to go very brown before anyone will eat it!!  Just store them in your freezer.  When you are ready to make the bread, thaw them, cut off the tops and squeeze them out like toothpaste!

Can’t make a true review of the actual recipe except I have used an exact recipe of it with the exception of butter vs. veg oil.  I think the butter gave it a nicer flavor. I made this recipe with the suggestions of reviewer “Naples34102" where she added 1tsp lemon, 1tsp baking powder and an additional 1/4 c. flour.  The additional 1/4 c. flour is definitely NOT needed and caused it to be a bit dry.  The flavor was okay.  Will try again as originally posted especially minus the additional flour.

This was the best Banana Bread I have ever eaten! Seriously!  My husband tried it even though he is not a banana bread fan and even he couldn't quit eating it..I finished it off today (HaHa) and tonight he was looking for it and was disappointed it was gone, which is why I am up any 1:30 am making another batch for a surprise breakfast treat for him.  :). PS. I'm very picky and a very good cook,  takes a lot to impress me.  I'm IMPRESSED

It was the most perfect banana bread ever. I made it as a cake and it turned out well. I used softened butter instead of molten butter but followed everything else exactly. Will try again for sure.

So I did not have any sour cream!  What to do?!? I substituted a half cup of whipped cream cheese (mixed with a tablespoon or so of milk) for the sour cream and wow!  Tastes soooooo good!  Also added some chocolate chips.  YUMMY!

I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 3 mashed bananas (I froze them and thawed them), no salt because I melted salted butter, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I only used 1 tsp of baking powder. I did the rest of the instructions. After I mixed in 2 eggs and vanilla, I did add the sour cream, bananas, then walnuts, then I mixed in the flour with baking powder. I cooked the batter as muffins in the oven on the bottom rack for 25 minutes on 325.  It turned out really dense, not spongy. It is slightly more chewy than spongy, I think because eggs make it dense and maybe the sour cream. They are gray cupcakes and I had 12 of them. They still had banana squiggles in them, I wonder how those show up? Some weren't topped off though. I added a bit of milk to a low cupcake batter and it flattened out the top from being expanded and round. I still want more banana flavor in banana bread.

I have been using this recipe for several years to make banana muffins.  Muffins always turn out moist.  I do mash the bananas and add a tsp of lemon juice though.

When slicing doesn't sound like the right thing to do, you go ahead and mash the bananas! Ideally, they're so ripe you can't get slices.   
I have this in the oven right now. The modifications I made are: •room temperature butter • 1C light brown sugar • Greek yogurt stands in for sour cream • no nuts (picky 6yr old) •added a splash of vanilla extract  and a generous dash of cinnamon • 5 small over-ripe bananas which I beat into the the butter/sugar/eggs. 
•gray sea-salt (it's the salt I have) - everything else is as directed. 
The batter is delicious.
I'm enjoying a hot slice. Not bad at all.

This was one of the best recipes. The bread was so moist! I'm not a baker and was afraid that it would not turn out right. I followed the recipe and it turned out great! This will definitely be a favorite!

Love this banana bread, did some minor changes to baking, upped the oven to 375°f and put the batter in muffin tins instead for 18 minutes rotating the pan half way through cooking. Also added some mini chocolate chips. Makes about 24 muffins. Probably the the most moist banana bread I've ever made.

Definitely the moistest banana bread I've ever had. I waited until the bananas (2 large) were at the peak of sweetness and sliced them paper thin because I didn't think I'd like the texture of chunks of banana in the finished product.  Came out perfectly.

This was an excellent recipe...moist and delicious. I've tried a few of the different banana bread recipes but this one is the best.  I didn't melt the butter or slice the bananas though.  I creamed the butter with the sugar and I mashed the bananas.

This is a very moist banana bread recipe!  Instead of a loaf I made muffins making it easier to pack in my husband's lunch box.  I, of course, altered the baking time.   I will definitely make this again!!

This was an easy recipe to follow.  Turned out great. Only change was to use brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Next time will add more bananas. An preferred to mash bananas instead of slicing them.

It was delicious! I did make a few changes though: I didn't have any sour cream so I used butter milk instead. I also mashed the bananas and added cinnamon and blueberries. Next time, I'll try adding some chocolate chips instead of blueberries.

I'm definitely sticking to this recipe from now on.

Amazing recipe. few changes that I need worked to my favour. instead of sour cream I used fresh cream. The  sugar may be reduced by 1/4th cup if you don't like it as sweet as m n m's. I used the 1/2 tsp lemon juice as mentioned in a review, 1leveled tsp of baking powder and an equal amount of baking soda. the cake was moist from within and soft, light and fluffy on the outside. Bon appetit!

I am Not a baker but this recipe was so easy and the end result was out of this world.  The only thing I did differently was I used very black peeled bananas that I had in my freezer. I heard that u should let them come to room temperature.  Drained off the liquid and added to the mixture.  I made a loaf the first time and now I have muffins baking in the oven.  Thanks Janet for this wonderful recipe

I have made this twice now and made some minor variations to the recipe. I took the advice of other reviews and added 1tsp lemon juice, used 1tsp baking soda AND 1tsp baking powder. I reduced the flour to 1 3/4 cup, and mashed the bananas instead of slicing. I used three medium sized bananas that I quick ripened (placed 3 bananas on a cookie sheet and baked until blackened about 30 minutes at 300 degrees). After they are ripened they slide out of the peels easily and mash easily. DO NOT SLICE the bananas.

This recipe was very moist and good flavor but I recommend mashing up the bananas instead of cutting them up. Also I cooked the bread the length of time the recipe said but the inside was not done while the outside was burned.

Great recipe!  I doubled the recipe and used two ripe bananas and two frozen bananas (thawed).  I added the bananas before the flour mixture then folded in the sour cream and nuts.  Made one 9X5 pan and two 8X4 pans.  Rotated pans half way through baking.

This is always my go-to recipe for banana nut bread.  I just made it today and instead of a loaf, I made muffins (fill them all the way to the top) and sprinkled with turbinado sugar.  They were sooo good!

I doubled the recipe and added 6 bananas and I used coconut extract because I was out of vanilla, over all the banana bread is sweet enough and very moist. I will be using the recipe going forward.

Excellent... We had company that wanted sour cream in their potato, and hubby and I don't like it as a condiment... Had to use it up along with some bananas from our veggie co-op. Followed other reviews and mashed my bananas, used 3 instead of two. Added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. Oh yeah! I make my own vanilla, so it isn't as strong as the store stuff, so I used 1 tablespoon. I used large muffin cups. Baked for 45 min. Perfect!

This recipe was fantastic..I've made many banana bread loaves in my time but often they don't cook thoroughly in the middle.  This one turned out great.. I did make a couple changes/additions.  I didn't have any sour cream, so I replaced with strawberry yogurt.  I also added some peanut butter chips in addition to pecans in lieu of walnuts because that's what I had on hand.  Yummy.  I often use chocolate chips and/or cherries in my banana bread but really enjoyed the peanut-butter chips this time around. Will use this recipe again in the future!  Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious. I doubled the recipe and added chocolate chips and deleted the nuts. (My grandkids don't like nuts.) I left the bananas in chucks and the bread turned out really moist. Will make it again!

This is the BEST!! Rave reviews every time I make it (which is pretty regularly).  I use very ripe bananas, usually 3-4, and mash them.  I also add cinnamon, which is a personal preference.

I made this banana bread  exactly as the recipe, except that because my bananas were already so soft I mashed them instead of slicing them. Absolutely the best banana bread I have ever made!

I made this but modified it quite a bit and it was very delicious, moist and flavorful. I opted to use ricotta because that is what I had on hand. I used brown sugar because I prefer its flavor over white sugar, put double the amount of vanilla, used coconut oil instead of butter and added some cinnamon. I put all the wet ingredients in a blender and blended on high, before adding the dry ingredients. I did substitute baking powder 1 teaspoon and added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. This made the crumb light and fluffy rather than a dense heavy bread. I also find the trick to really good banana bread to use bananas you honestly think should go in the garbage. The more overly ripe they are, the better flavor the bread will have. I will make this as a family staple in our home :)

I personally like brown sugar in banana bread so I used half brown and half white. Also added some chocolate and peanut butter chips for my man's sweet tooth instead of the nuts. And def gotta mash bananas. No other changes to the recipe and it is fantastic. Gotta take it to work so we don't eat the whole thing!

I make this pretty often, always doubling the bananas and mashing them rather than slicing them. The recipe's flexible enough to add all sorts of things, but my standard addition is a combo of chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. I've also tried adding mangoes I needed to use up, flaked coconut, pecans rather than walnuts...it always comes out good. Definitely worth trying.

Carmsolo: By far the best and moist banana bread I have ever tasted! It's super easy to make and the secret ingredient is the sour cream...who knew! I don't melt the butter though, I just stir in room temperature. Thank you for this amazing recipe!:) I just don't use walnuts.

I make several different kinds of sweet breads throughout the year. This recipe is absolutely the best I've ever used for Banana Bread. It beats the one I have loved for 40 years. I used 5 good sized bananas for a double recipe and otherwise made it as written. It turned out so moist and flavorful. A double recipe makes 7 foil mini loaves.

Love this! Haven't made Banana bread in years! I did change it slightly, I know that's annoying. I creamed the butter and sugar. I used three bananas... Two of them I mixed up with the other moist ingredients and the third I cut in small pieces and added towards the end with the walnuts. I also only had reduced fat sour cream so I used some of that and the remainder I used Noosa coconut yogurt. I also used a little vanilla bean paste and the little almond extract. I put the batter into three small mini loaf pans. I cut the bake time down but checked it every so often. I wish I had kept better track of the time... The taste is fantastic!

Followed receipe exactly but I did add slivered almond and chopped dates, plus I added yogurt instead of sour cream.  I also poured a light glaze on top.  Very yummy.

I made this this morning and my husband and I both loved it. The addition of the sour cream kept it very moist, and adding the bananas sliced instead of mashed gave it a much stronger banana flavor. Definitely a recipe I will keep using.

This banana bread recipe is very delicious and fun to make! It was very moist delicious. I would mash up the banana's instead of slicing them because they turned mushy and purple and not very appetizing. I would make this again!

This banana bread is amazing! The best I've ever had. I always mash the bananas and this time I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and it was even better. Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly. One of my favorite things EVER!

So, I've made this bread several times now, with a couple of variations each time. Each time, I've mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. The first time I didn't have enough sour cream and just replaced it with a mix of sour cream and cream cheese. Then the next time I made it I replaced the walnuts with an equivalent amount of shelled chopped pistachios, and added 1/4 cup of dried coconut, and 1/4 cup of dried chopped pineapple. This time I'm adding a little more volume of the add ins, and an extra egg to hold it all together, and we're going to warm each slice up and toss a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some caramel drizzle over it. Every time I've used this recipe, it has completely disappeared the first day out of the oven. It's a huge hit with my family and super easy to make.

Delicious, easy recipe. I thought my Mom made good banana bread but this was even better. I had five rather small bananas so I used all of them. The bread was very moist. I had too much batter for one loaf pan, so I made a mini loaf too. Will make again!

I have been making banana bread for years using my mom's recipe. I decided to give a new recipe a try and WOW! It is amazing as it is. It is so moist and delicious, my family can't get enough of it! I made it twice in one week! Definitely a keeper.

This is my new go-to banana bread recipe.  Super easy, moist -- follow the instructions.  I know it seems weird, but you really do add the sour cream after everything else.  It will work!

Instead of butter, I used safflower oil and, instead of sour cream, I used vanilla Greek yogurt. I omitted the walnuts. Came out pretty moist and delish. Even my 4yo godson (who won't eat anything other than chicken nuggets and french fries) said it was better than hot dogs!

There was a couple things wrong with this, 1st I needed to bake it for 1h25min and I added 1 cup and half of sugar and honestly it still was not sweet enough.  I will make it again next time I will add 2 cups of sugar, I'll see how it is the second time around.

I have made this banana bread 5 times now and am making it again this morning (07/21/16). My family loves it!! I have even given a loaf to my good friends and neighbors and they raved about it!!  Never going back to the box mix again!
10/23/16
I have made this recipe quite a few times since my last review. It's a family and friends favorite!! This time I'm adding 1/2 cup cranberries to the recipe. I'll let you know how it turns out.

Wow. definitely on my top 3 list for banana bread! super light and fluffy! mild banana flavor.
I took some of the suggestions. almost whipping the room temp butter (not melted) and sugar. then adding in the eggs. then adding in the yogurt-plain whole milk- (I subbed for sour cream). made this nice and fluffy before adding the flour, salt and baking soda. then the bananas (mashed not sliced).
I made muffins so adjustment cook time to 33 min for normal muffins and 36 min for ones with blueberries added.

I'm not a banana bread fan but this was really good. I mashed the bananas and used about 5 (because I had that many) and everyone loved it. Definitely a keeper. Very moist and tasty.

I've made this twice and tweaked a few ingredients the 2nd time. I used self rising flour and cut out the baking soda. I also trimmed down the sour cream to 1/4 cup and substituted 1/4 cup of softened cream cheese and went with 1 1/2 cups of pureed bananas rather than slices. This abridged version was a recipe from my great gramma and one of my comfort foods as a child. Love it

Skipped the walnuts because I made it for a Sunday church social, and some can't have the nuts. Was still delicious! I've added it to my few near and dear banana bread/muffin recipes.

My new favorite banana bread recipe. I used to use Emeril's but it's complicated. Everyone who's tried this loves it. I've given the recipe to 3 people. I use a cup of mashed bananas. I follow the rest of the recipe exactly.

I only use 1/8 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla. Also, I have to mash the bananas into a pulp because I can not stand the texture of banana in my mouth, but the recipe makes delicious banana bread!  Thank you for sharing!

Definitely the moistest banana bread I've ever made!  Only changes I made were using more banana and less sour cream--approx 3 bananas and i halved the sour cream...I also omitted the walnuts only because my kids don't like them (personally I love them but....sigh...)  Would highly recommend this recipe!  It was a pleaser!!

Super moist!  I did mash the bananas, since I always let them get black before I use them in baked goods. That really maximizes the banana flavor.

I never have good luck with Banana Bread (or Zucchini Bread).  Usually too dry or has metallic taste.  This Banana Bread is sooooo easy!  Plus, it had perfect taste and moisture.  Slicing the bananas is a great way to do it.
I added cinnamon to the recipe and a topped with a little sugar.  I also made them in mini loaf pans - made 5 loaves.
My husband said, "Yum!  Good job honey!"

Mash your bananas, I add cinnamon bc I add it everything. This is my go to recipe bc the crumb is perfect. Cream your butter and sugar. I will also make a crumb from flour, Brown sugar, cinnamon and butter and heap it on top for a crispy touch. We like to make it into 12 beautiful muffins topped with the crumb for a quick grab before work and school.

Awesome! Only tweak I made was using plain no fat yogurt for sour cream, and disaronno liquor for lemon juice as I had none. Followed suggestions of 1 tsp BS and BP. Lovely bread, my new favourite!

I played with the recipe a bit.  I made one loaf with applesauce instead of butter.  Use half brown sugar and half cane sugar.  Put in 1 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder.  Also used 1 3/4 cup of flour.

This is the best banana bread I've ever made! It came out perfectly! I did as some of the others suggested and let the butter sit out at room temp (not melted) and mashed the (very ripe) bananas, rather than slice them. I also used a mixer to blend the ingredients. I don't think it affected the overall product. Instead of greasing the baking dish with shortening or oil, I dabbed a paper towel in my softened butter and used that.

I took the advice of the others and mashed the bananas. I used 2 cups since I doubled the recipe. And I also just creamed the butter and sugar together . Otherwise I made the recipe just like it is and my husband loved it. I thought it was pretty darn good too.    Banana Bread usually isn't my favorite because it's not moist but this definitely is and I'll be making it again soon.

This was awesome! Best banana bread I've made, but I changed a few slight things.  I used salted real cream butter(publix brand),  I used vanilla bean paste instead of extract, only about 1/4 to 1/3 c of sour cream(I eyed it) and I used 3 very ripe medium-ish bananas(about 6-7 inches in length, not very thick) I also mixed all wet ingredients together first (butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla, sour cream and bananas) after creaming that together I mixed in the flour mixture of flour, baking soda and salt, slowly (like you would when making cookies) Divided between two 9x5 loaf pans baked at 350 for 30 minutes and beautiful!! Best bread I've ever made. Oh and no nuts. :)

I only made a couple of changes. I used salted butter and mashed the bananas. I doubled the recipe for 2 loaves. The bread was very moist and delicious! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

AMAZING!! I bake it in a springform pan for 30 mins and it turns out so moist and delicious! I like it better cooked in this type of pan. But the recipe is spot on! I make it every weekend.

Best banana bread EVER!  So moist and delish.  I make it exactly as written.  Sometimes I add a half a cup of dark chocolate chips, blueberries, or cranberries.  Possibilities are endless.   LOVE IT!

Love Love Love this recipe.  The taste is delish!  Just like some of the other reviews, I prefer to puree my bananas (about a cup once done) and use choc chips rather than walnuts,  but those are the only differences.  Also tastes just as good when you double the recipe.  
Thumbs up!

Love this banana bread. Moist  and easy to make.  My husband doesn't like walnuts so I pour  the bread into the pan before adding the nuts and then lightly mix nuts into half the loaf batter.  Works well for me since I love walnuts.

It was good.  I ended up not liking the sliced bananas as much as if I had mashed them.  I also reduced the cooking time by 5 minutes.

Love this recipe!!! I split the sugar and did 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown. Everything else was left as is .. Oh a splash of orange juice. Not sure why I add the orange juice but I was taught to do that as a child when baking bananas. I made mine into banana bites that my kids devoured!!!

Altered this recipe to be more like what I usually make, b/c I was without my recipe. Used 1/4 c (1/2 stick) butter, added 1 cup vegetable oil and 1 tsp baking powder, removed the nuts and sour cream, and mashed the bananas. I doubled this recipe and baked in 8x11 dish. Turned out great, very moist, and I'll absolutely make it again.

Definitely a recipe to keep! I mashed the bananas rather than chopping them, and added three instead of two. I also added half a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of cloves, and a handful of chocolate chips in addition to the walnuts. I used brown sugar instead of white and cut it down to 3/4 cup. I thought it turned out super moist and yummy! Would make again for sure!

I followed the recipe exactly, which I usually do the first time trying a recipe.  Banana bread isn't my favorite, but I didn't want to throw away aging bananas.   So glad I tried this recipe as it was perfect.  I think for those who really love banana flavor, you might try three bananas.  For my tastes, two was perfect.  I even made a second batch to give to my sister and her family.  PS, I mashed my bananas as I knew I wouldn't like seeing large pieces.

Like others, I mashed the bananas instead of slicing, and didn't have sour cream so I substituted plain Greek yogurt. Also added a little cinnamon. Would definitely make again.

I didn't follow the recipe to a T and did per Naples34102 comments. Instead of sour cream, since I didn't have any on hand, I used strawberry yogurt. I've been making banana bread for a really long time and this is my favorite!

Absolutely love this recipe. I've made it more than a dozen times and my kids request it every time they see ripe bananas.  I usually use vanilla yogurt in place of the sour cream, but today I only had strawberry and the recipe was still amazing! I bake in muffin tins for 18-20 minutes and sprinkle a bit of brown sugar on top. I also smash the bananas instead of slice them like others have suggested.

The only thing I changed was mashing the bananas instead of slicing and it turned out perfect.

This was very moist and tasty.  I substituted applesauce for half the sour cream (I doubled the recipe) and then added mini chocolate chips.  Everyone loved it!

This is the best banana bread recipe I've found! I mash up the bananas instead of slicing them and I add nutmeg and cinnamon. I don't include any nuts because I never have them on hand but I have added chocolate chips and they're delicious. Greek yogurt works just as well as sour cream too! I made muffins with this recipe, 20 minutes at 350 degrees - absolutely perfect!

The best recipe I've made! Follow the review that changes it to one cup of mashed bananas and a combination of baking soda and baking powder.  I also creamed the butter and sugar with a mixer and then hand mixed the remaining ingredients in without altering the moist, dense texture.

Absolutely delicious and moist. I did add 1 tbs lemon juice and 1 tsp baking powder as another reviewer suggested. I also mashed the banana. I add lemon to a lot of baked goods, like muffins, pie and even pancakes...

EASY recipe! And the bread is just delicious!  As I was assembling ingredients, I realized I did not have sour cream, so I used plain yogurt instead and I used pecans (after all I AM from Texas) instead of walnuts! Still came out rich, moist, and yummy!

This recipe is great! I have used it several times. I use a pastry blender to mash the bananas really fine. I also don't incorporate the nuts and everything still turns out fine. For really moist banana bread don't cook the full time otherwise it may be too dry.

Very moist recipe. To enhance the banana flavour, save the bananas until they're almost black and then freeze them. Thaw before use. They'll be gooey and watery so you might want to add an extra tablespoon of flour.

COOKING IN CHINA.
Would make it again.  I thought I had a microwave that was also an oven.  Perhaps because I can't read the Chinese instructions couldn't figure it out. However, microwaved it for 12 minutes and came out perfect.  Cooked it in a sort of tall bowl.

Worked!

Had to use yogurt as they don't have sour cream here. 

Tastes wonderful.  Will definitely make it again.  Will pretend it has sour cream!

This was the first time I've made banana bread myself and I was impressed with this recipe. The bread is moist and flavorful, and using sour cream instead of vegetable oil really allows the banana flavor to come out. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and like other reviewers I mashed the bananas rather than slicing them. This will be a go-to from now on!

Great.   Firm but not too dense. Very moist. Excellent flavor.  This Time I didn't have sour cream so I used a couple of Tbls of cottage cheese and a ripe peach, mashed.  Yep.  You read it right! Amazing! My ONLY banana bread recipe.  Thank you!

This was fantastic!  I changed a few things - added about a teaspoon of cinnamon, and about 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Also sprinkled a little cinnamon/sugar mixture in the pans before adding the batter.    I doubled the recipe, but forgot to double the eggs, and it STILL turned out moist and delicious!  Doubled, recipe make one big loaf and three tiny loaves.  Big loaf about 1 hour 10 minutes, little loaves, about 40minutes.  Love it, thanks.

I have been searching for a better banana bread recipe and this is it.  So moist and good.  I didn't  have trouble getting it to cook at the way through as in prior recipes.  The very top was always gooey.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I made it with yogurt instead of sour cream and it was perfect.  I just didn't have sour cream on hand.

I made this gluten free by replacing the flour with 3/4 c almond meal/flour and 3/4 c coconut flour. I also added a 3rd banana and 1/2 tsp baking powder. They're fluffy, moist, and DELICIOUS!!

Loved it! It was so moist.  The only change to the instructions, would be mashing the bananas, instead of slicing.  It just helps to distribute the bananas more evenly.  Otherwise, I made it as is. Delish!

I had already planned my variations, I just needed a base recipe to get me started.  This one is great!  My changes:  I used 4 mashed up bananas just to get rid of them.  I did not have walnuts, but I added a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips.  My bread came out extremely rich and dense, but so good!

I will definitely use this recipe every time! The only suggestion I have would be to add a little bit of cinnamon, leave out the salt, and most importantly use softened butter instead of melted butter... Delicious! :-)

Delish! I used 3 bananas mashed, and no sour cream, also added a handful of chocolate chips just because I had them in the pantry.It turned out soooo good! Baked for 60mins then turned oven off and left it inside to cool, as I wasn't getting a fully clean knife yet. It's moist

It was great! I only made a few changes 
I didn't have sour cream so I used 1/2 cup buttermilk instead. The other thing is I added one more cup flour (only because I used buttermilk) and I substituted the nuts for chocolate chips and added 2 teaspoons baking powder.  One big thing I did is add 3 bananas instead of 2. That made a big difference. I also made muffins  instead of a loaf, and only baked for 30 minutes. 
I will definitely be making this again!

Delish! I added a bit of cinnamon and used mashed bananas. Also a little bit of semi-sweet chocolate... probably won't do that again, too sweet for me, but still, almost ate the whole pan myself :)

Used three very squishy, refrigerated, brown bananas. 1 3/4 c. flour, 1tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger (because we love it), 1tsp each baking powder and soda. The rest of the ingredients remained the same. The bananas literally slid out of the peels and needed almost no mashing.

Great recipe. For me, I substitute 1/2 cup sour cream with 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce. (Seriously try this at least once) I use very ripe bananas and yes like others, I mash them down with a fork then add them in.  I have made this with and without walnuts. Absolutely delicious! So easy and most of the time I have the ingredients that I need already around.

I made this exactly as stated except I used pecans instead of walnuts since that is what I had on hand.  I noticed after making it that most reviewers added spices to the recipe.  If I make again, I will do that too.  It seems very bland to me.  I used nice, ripe bananas, but I hardly tasted the banana flavor at all.

This was delicious! I have used this recipe many times and every time I make it to share it gets rave reviews. The only things I change is that I freeze my old bananas and take them out as needed for this recipe so I mash them instead of slicing. Freezing them breaks down the cells of the bananas and give it a really smooth consistency. I always double the recipe plus 1 extra banana and lastly, I add an extra 1/2 cup of walnuts because we love nuts.

Absolutely loved it! My 12 year old son baked it himself. We upped banana to 3 and decreased sugar to 2/3 cups. I loved that recipe calls for sliced, not mushed bananas. You get that amazing banana taste, it is more intense this way.

Perfect banana bread. Because of the sour cream, I added 1 tsp of baking powder,  and replaced the vanilla with maple extract (I often use maple rather than vanilla as it adds a "deeper" flavor with some recipes.) I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. Like a previous reviewer noted, one cup of mashed bananas is the right amount for one loaf. No need to search for a better recipe. 
 
Also, I have made this using olive oil in place of butter and the results are identical. Perfection.

Years.  That's how long it's been in searching for the perfect banana bread.  So, I didn't expect this recipe to be good but I tried it anyway.  One word:  PERFECT!  The only change is that I did mash the bananas.  My whole family  loved it.  It's my only banana bread recipe from now on.  Super moist and flavorful.  I like cinnamon in mine so I did add a little cinnamon.

I have made this recipe at least half a dozen times and it is my go to recipe for banana bread. Some revisions I make to suit my tastes: 2 large bananas or 3 medium, 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup,  2 tsp of cinnamon,  1 1/2 tsp of ground ginger, 1/2 tsp of cloves, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I would recommend using softened butter and creaming it with the sugar instead of melted butter which I find doesn't give me as great of a result. Definitely mash the bananas into a pace instead of slicing them which gives the bread a bizarre squishy texture. I don't often have sour cream on hand when I have ripe bananas to make this recipe, vanilla yogurt can be subbed with a very similar effect just make sure to scale back on the sugar if the yogurt is indeed sweetened. This recipe can be easily adapted to be baked in muffin tins,: fill muffin cavities almost completely (it won't rise a ton) and bake for about 21 minutes. I would suggest checking with a skewer at the 19 minute mark though. A simple streusel topping made with a small amount of butter, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and flour can be mixed up and put on after filling the muffin cavities as a nice variation of taste and texture.

I totally agree about this being the most moist and delicious banana bread recipe I've EVER made, hands down! People always tell me what a good cook/baker I am and I have tried a variety of banana bread recipes over  the 50+ yrs. I've been baking, but this is the absolute winner!  I will never use any other!  I believe part of the secret is slicing the bananas instead of mashing as most other recipes call for.  I've made it exactly as written, but for just a tiny bit tastier option I used vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream.  Plain yogurt I'm sure would be great also.

Thank you for the awsome recipie. Being first time maker of Banana bread it came out very well. I used 2% butter milk instead of sour cream and 3/4 tsp of baking bowder. Also I smashed banana. Rest the same recipie and use brown sugar in place of white sugar. Really great receipe.

I have made dozens of different banana bread recipes and this is the one I always go back to. The sour cream and melted butter make it super rich and moist. I do mash my bananas as I don't like chunks but that is the only change I make to the recipe. The only suggestion I have is watch it closely as oven times vary. This is probably the best variation out there though.

This was delicious! Followed another reviewer's recommendations and increased flour to 1 3/4 cup, also used 1tsp each  baking powder and baking soda. Mashed the bananas. Will definitely make again. My family loved it, it was nice and moist, appropriately dense. This is my go to recipe now, although next time I may try cutting back on the sugar a little bit, there's so much natural sweetness from the bananas I think I could cut back some on the sugar and not be too big s deal.
**update June 2018- made this with 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar and was still plenty sweet. I may cut back to 1/2 cup total next time.

I added walnuts, chocolate and butterscotch chips as well as a little cinnamon. I mashed my bananas since they were on the side of being the best part of ripeness!  Going to try and use for french toast tomorrow for breakfast.

Took way longer than an hour to get the inside cooked. I baked it for an hour and the outside came out great but the inside was still raw. So I baked it for another hour and thirty minutes.

I swapped the sliced bananas for 1 cup mashed bananas. Also, I had no sour cream on hand so I swapped that for buttermilk. My family devoured it and is already begging me to make it again! Great base recipe ;)

I thought the flavor came out great, I used other reviewers' suggestions and mashed the bananas, I also did .75 sugar and .25 brown sugar , as well as creamed the butter, overall it turned out great with a few tweaks. Made it three times already for my husband using different forms.

I didn't have any walnuts and quite frankly I don't care for walnuts in general. I feel like they take the sweetness away from the bread so I substituted it with dried banana chips! And my goodness you guys it came out to be heavenly. The chips had softened up with hints of crunch and flavor. Perfect addition. "Double Banana Bread"

This recipe is perfect except, instead of slicing the bananas puree them with a fork before adding to the mixture. 
I put my batter in the fridge for an hour which gave it  amazing texture. Will definitely make again! My boyfriend and dad couldn't get enough of it :)

Incredibly moist. I followed the recipe except used yogurt instead if sour cream. Use parchment paper on the bottom for perfect browning with NO sticking.

I agree with the review that said slicing the bananas is less than ideal. It makes some parts of the bread too mushy. I think this recipe would work fine using mashed bananas instead.

It was ok... the inside was rather gooey even with the toothpick test that came out clean...so somewhat deceiving.  I used 4 larger bananas and mashed them.  Making banana bread for years, I knew the sliced would sink and cause a level of mushiness I just wouldn't care for.  Not sure what it was, but this was not overly bananany...hence the 3 stars.

This recipe was good but I did make substantial changes. I used 1/2 cup sugar, 3 bananas mashed, added 1 tbsp cinnamon, used yogurt instead of sour cream (out of necessity) and added craisins. The bread came out moist, sweet and very tasty. I'll use the recipe again as a good base - but with my alterations!

I took one of the commenters suggestions to add 1 3/4c. flour instead, a tsp of lemon juice, and equal amounts of baking powder to baking soda. Also mashing bananas! However I think the recipe comes out much more moist and sweeter if you take it out after 50min instead of a whole hour, which dried my bread out. Otherwise it's just as good as mom's!

SO moist!  SO tasty!  I've never added sour cream before but this was awesome - I will scrap my mom's recipe for this one (ssshhhhh!)
I did substitute apple sauce for the butter, however, and a dash of cinnamon.

This came out soo moist and delicious! The only thing I changed was I substituted the walnuts with mini chocolate chips for my friends who don't like nuts. I'm sure this banana bread is going to be a hit!

Quite tasty! I swapped out the sour cream for Plain Greek Yogurt, and used very ripe bananas that I had in the frezzer (thawed just before use)! No nuts. It's super moist and delicious! I will be making this one again!

WOW! This is the best banana bread I have ever made - so moist! I didn't have eggs, but I had a carton of egg whites, so I used 1/3 cup of that instead of 2 eggs. I also mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. I used 3 small-medium sized bananas instead of 2. I also sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon on top before baking. I had to bake for 70 minutes. I got so many compliments on this recipe!!

So good, as is, I'm leaving my first review. As with others reviewers, I do mash the bananas first. This is the only recipe I've made from allrecipes that I don't change-perfect as is.

Fantastic banana bread! Most tender and moist I have ever had! This is even with my changes. I used coconut oil instead of margarine, coconut sugar instead of white sugar, whole wheat flour instead of white flour, egg replacement instead of real egg, and no sour cream. I also added three bananas not 2.

I have never had a more moist banana bread. I can't wait to make it again. I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them; and I had everything on hand except for the walnuts, so I omitted those on this go round. I definitely could tell they were missing and I missed the extra flavor, but the bread was still yummy without them. My picky kids even asked for more!

I was tired of dealing with my fussy recipe that called for extracting and reducing banana juice, and wanted to try something easier and was hoping flavor wouldn't suffer. Surprise! This recipe was so much better (oh and yes, so simple). My new fave!

What I did was roughly mashed a total of 1 cup of banana (for me it was a little more than two bananas) instead of using slices. I then sprinkled another half cup of chopped walnuts (for a total of 1 cup) on the top of the whole thing before putting it in the oven.

Best banana bread i ever made!! I make mini muffins for my granddaughter and big muffins for the adults. If i'm taking it somewhere i use loaf pans. The only change i make is I use up to 2 cups of flour if i have an extra banana that needs to be used and half white and half brown sugar. I also prefer mashed bananas. I like to add crumble topping before baking. Everyone loves this recipe!

The only thing different about mine is that I omitted the nuts (didn't have any).  I  sliced the bananas and then used a hand mixer to blend in the batter as not to be chunky. I have to say that I thought this was the best banana bread I ever ate. Moist and such a nice texture and flavor. I will make this again and again.

Used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, added about a half  tsp of cinnamon and a dash of ground cloves, mashed the bananas (still left some chunks), and baked for 60 minutes at 325.  Delicious!
Also - didn't melt the butter first, and folded in about a half cup of chocolate chips (they sank, but it was still so good that I'd probably do it again).

This was one of the best banana bread recipes I've made. I didn't make many changes to it at all other than adding a bit of cinnamon,  which is a personal preference of mine. I also left out the nuts because I didn't have any on hand. It also took about an hour and a half to bake, but it was still moist and delicious. Will definitely be making this again!

This was the most delicious banana bread I have ever made (and I have made my share)! It was so moist and full of banana flavor. I used 3 bananas instead of 2 because I had 3 that were going bad, and I mashed them instead of slicing, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect!! Will definitely make again. Thumbs Up!!

I followed this recipe exactly. While it was very moist and tasted good, I wish I had put another banana in it. Not quite enough banana flavor for me. I will make it again but will use more bananas.

I really liked this recipe but I mashed the bananas, instead of slicing them. That seemed to give the bread a more overall banana flavor and made it look more like normal banana bread. I also used and extra 1/2 banana, 1/2 teaspoon & 1/4 nutmeg that made the flavor better as well.

This is a great recipe the only differences I also mashed bananas and used three bananas instead of two.

Very moist and delicious!! Instead of the sour cream, I used 2 more bananas. Definitely the best banana bread I've ever made.

Delicious & moist! This recipe is a keeper, although I did alter it slightly based on other reviews and my lack of sour cream.
I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar,  added  1 teaspoon of  baking powder,  used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and mashed my bananas instead of slicing them. 
After greasing the bread pans, I'd suggest that you lightly flour them for an easy release. 
This is a perfect recipe for the brown bananas I keep in my freezer!

I have never posted a review for a recipe but I had to for this one! I just started getting back into baking and decided to make this. It was the best banana/walnut bread I have ever tasted! Since I used two very ripe bananas I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. Also, I added the dry and wet ingredients separately and once the wet ingredients were mixed, I slowly added the dry ingredients. I feel it works best that way and won't make any lumps or clumps. Thanks for an amazing recipe!!

Best banana bread recipe! I've used this recipe several times and it never disappoints. I usually use 3 bananas if I have 3 and I'll usually sprinkle extra walnuts on the top before I bake it because I'm greedy :) Today I decided to sub 1/2 cup sour cream with 1/2 cup buttermilk and there was no notable difference. I like to do this sometimes to test the waters in case I'm ever out of an ingredient, it's nice to have a suitable sub ;)

Delicious! Very simple, and super-yummy :)

Made a double batch and used 2% Greek Yogurt instead of the sour cream, worked great. Made half the mix into choc-chip muffins (made 16 moderately sized ones) for lunch boxes, and added maybe 2/3 desiccated coconut to the other batch, and a teaspoon coconut essence, and baked as a loaf.

Haven't tried the loaf yet, but texture looks great, and it smells good. The muffins are really good - great texture and taste.

Made a couple of changes cooking - instead of folding,p in the bananas and yogurt, I just kept the mix in my KitchenAid and stirred them in very slowly and just a tiny bit (I was under significant pressure to go play Lego!) I also baked at 375 instead of 350, since my hubby had a wholemeal loaf and meatballs already in the oven!

Great recipe, and adaptable :)

I've been making my mom's banana bread recipe for years, which doesn't use sour cream, so I decided to try out this one. I did make some mods suggested by other reviewers, adding 1tsp baking powder and 1tsp lemon juice, and I used three medium mashed bananas (I don't want chunks of banana in my bread!)  I also subbed 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. The batter had a totally different look and texture than I'm used to. The bread rose flat-topped and didn't bake with cracks in the middle like I'm used to. And when the loaf came out of the pan it left the bottom crust stuck to the pan, which I hate!! But the flavor and texture of the bread itself is actually ok, it is really moist if that's what you want. Not as banana-y as my mom's recipe, so personally I still prefer what I grew up on!

Made as recipe called for.  Made three batches at once, would not recommend doing that it was very hard to mix even in a kitchen aid.  I put the nuts in a food processor first because I don't like the texture of the just crushed nuts in the bread.

Great recipe. I've made this so many times I've lost count.
I always mash my bananas with potato masher and add 2 teaspoon cinnamon powder.  I like to use use bananas that are ripe with spots.

Very Simple. Very Easy. Very Delicious.

I've made this a few times now with lots of compliments. I prefer to double the vanilla, skip the nuts, and use mashed instead of sliced bananas, but the original is also good. Even if you're not much of a cook or a baker, try this recipe. It uses simple ingredients and is really easy to make.

This has been my go to recipe for years. Super moist. I mash the bananas with a metal pastry blender so they're smoother rather then the slices. I've been out of sour cream before and substituted mayo. It came out great.

I followed this recipe ALMOST exactly. The only thing I did different was to: 1.) Use plain unflavored yogurt instead of sour cream because I was out, and 2. ) Used 4 ripe bananas because that's what I had and didn't want the other 2 bananas to get thrown out. I was worried the texture might turn out different because I doubled the banana but it was perfect and I think it had the right amount of banana flavor. I hate banana bread that just tastes like bread with a bite or two of banana flavor. It was PERFECT, my husband ate half the loaf once it cooled down....SAVE THIS RECIPE

I have never reviewed ANY recipe on here because I didn't have an account.  THIS recipe was so good I came back AND started an account just so I could review it!  I lost all  my recipes in a house fire including the banana bread recipe I used for years.  THIS is going to be my new one.  If you can't decide which one to make, TRY this one!  It's sweet and dark (make sure to use really ripe bananas, that's a secret to GREAT banana bread) and there's NO oil!  I know, I thought it might come out dry, but no.  It's fabulous!  I did a half white sugar and half brown sugar though, because I've always used brown sugar in mine, and I mashed the bananas.  GREAT recipe!  Thank you sooo much for sharing it!

I loved the idea of melted butter, so much easier to mix up, I mashed the banana's and used 3.  (Also, if your banana's aren't totally ripe....pop them in 350 oven for 20 minutes, they'll be black and perfectly soft.)  Also, my oven was 50 minutes, so watch how hot your oven heats.  Great recipe, my go to now.

This is the best banana bread that I have ever tasted, hands down. I love that the only flavoring is banana (with a little vanilla) and you don't mush the banana so you a lot of flavor with each bite. I am making this again as soon as my bananas are ripe enough.

Amazingly moist and flavorful. Like other reviewers, I mashed enough banana to make 1 cup, added a 1/2 tsp of baking  powder, 3/4 tsp of cinnamon, and 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. Made it for a work dessert with rave reviews. Will make again for sure!

Very moist. Tastes even better when put in the fridge overnight as it becomes denser and more chewy.

I made the following changes (some of it based on what others have said):
1. Butter - at room temperature, not melted
2. Mash the bananas instead of slicing (1 cup)
3. Substituted Greek yoghurt for sour cream to be healthier (same amount).

I also used dark brown sugar instead of white so that it's a little less sweet plus has a smokier taste. But the bread will then turn out darker-looking. I'm wondering how it will taste with honey instead of sugar?

The next time round, I'm going to try and put in chocolate chips in the banana bread! I'm also wondering if this recipe can be varied for pumpkin bread instead...

***
I made it again using white sugar plus the changes above (points 1 - 3). This time round, it turned out lighter, moister, fluffier and way larger! Not sure if it was due to the sugar, the larger eggs that I used, or a different brand of Greek yoghurt, but this time round it tastes even better. It only required 50 minutes to cook on the bottom tray.

For those that are gluten free I made this awesome recipe with Pillsbury Gluten Free Flour 1:1 ratio.  It was delicious!  My friends could not tell the difference.

My "go to" banana bread recipe for a long time. However, we just moved up to 5000' elevation. The bread was very brown in a 350 degree oven at 50" but not done inside. I turned the oven down to 325 degrees for 10" and it appears to be done. Next time I'm going to set my oven at 325 for 60" to see if that helps. Any suggestions are welcome.

Delicious! Best Banana bread recipe I've come across by far. I added just over a cup of mashed bananas instead of sliced bananas, and a little cinnamon, but those were the only changes.

This is a really great recipe! It was so easy to make and it is absolutely delicious. Followed the recipe as is, except I substituted 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips for the walnuts.

Made this with sliced bananas, but put them in during the mixing process to mash them up a bit.  Yummy.  The secret is the Sour Cream.  Next time I will fiddle with the spices.  Cinnamon or nutmeg, 1/2 brown sugar to 1/2 white.  This time, we had ours with ice cream.

Yum. I love banana bread, and this recipe produced one that does not disappoint. I left out the nuts (I was out) so added in some cinnamon for flavour. The only thing I question is folding in the cream at the end with the banana. By this stage my batter was rather stiff, so to fold another wet ingredient in was difficult. It would be a lot easier if this was mixed through when the eggs are added.

This is the only banana bread I make now.  It even comes out great if you squish up frozen bananas.  My stepson cannot have gluten, so we use Hodgson Mill gluten free flour and a tsp of xantham gum,  and you can't even taste the difference.  Other than that, there is no need to change this recipe at all.

I made this as-is and the next time, I will lightly toast the walnuts prior to adding them to the batter. Outstanding bread and thanks for sharing.  :)  **April, 2018 JUST ONE BANANA?  I've made this many times but today, I made muffins, using qty. 8 as a guide (for whole egg, not a fraction and one banana.) Subbed mayo for not available sour cream. Works best with fully mashed banana. Made 8 in muffin paper cups, baked 20 mins. at 350. Slightly less sweet than the original quantity; might add 2 teaspoons more of sugar IF forced to use mayo again instead of sour cream. **Tried it again with the one banana, sour cream. Just like the bread. Nice "mistake" to make in case there's only the one banana left.

Always a winner, and so easy.  No mixer makes for easy cleanup and the batter is not overworked.  I add 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar to get a nice brown top.  I fork mash the bananas and mix in about 20 giardelli milk chocolate chips for a sweet surprise.    My husband loves it!

Delicious, moist bread! The directions were easy to follow. This was my first bread of any kind. Trying it out for a second time today. I ended leaving mine in the oven for an extra few minutes to cook it all the way through, but it's also possible that my oven runs a little cold. Fun to make, and delicious sweet/savory snack for the next week!

I was feeling a little under the weather today and didn't quite feel like baking, but I definitely needed something warm to eat - so I loosely measured the ingredients for this recipe and hoped for the best. I was surprised by how easy it was (for a beginner); I could've made it in one bowl if I so chose - and it was absolutely delicious! Hands down, the moistest banana bread I've ever made. 

I highly recommend adding the walnuts. They really do make a difference. I might try baking it again and substituting some low-fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream, just to keep things on the healthier side.

Happy baking :)

Loved it! Best banana bread ever. I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, doubled the vanilla, added 1 additional banana ( so 3 total all creamed) and 1/4c more flour. I also subed 1/2cup whole wheat flour for reg flour in the recipe.

Finally a banana bread recipe that worked for me!  Followed most of the directions - instead of melting the butter, I softened it/room temp'd it, and then creamed with the sugar.  Everyone in my office loved it!

Yeah so I made a couple of changes too, half brown and half white sugar, added chocolate chips instead of nuts cos I dont like nuts in sweet things. Beautifully moist and tasty.

I followed the recipe exactly with only one alteration.  I used two mashed over ripe bananas and added cinnamon and all spice (approx 1/8 tsp all spice and 1/4 cinnamon  X2 to double).  This recipe doubled well and had a very nice sugary crust.  I would give it 4.5? if I could.  Will hold on to this recipe and see how I can make it a perfect 5

I've made this recipe several times and I adore it! Two things I do differently is use very soften butter ( between room temperature and melted ) and double the nuts! In honor of my daughter who lives in Hawaii I will add coconut and pineapple , sounds amazing right? Happy baking??

This is a wonderful banana bread recipe!  Loads of banana flavor, wonderfully moist and with a lovely crumb.  Will be my absolute "go to" recipe for a banana quick bread!

I ended up doing everything as you have here except I mashed the bananas and used vanilla yoghurt instead of sour cream. I must say this is the best banana bread I have ever had. That is saying a lot as I'm not a huge fan of banana bread. I was making this for my son and boyfriend who love banana bread. I could eat this any day, it's absolutely delicious!

Great bread. I added 1 tablespoon of honey, 1 tablespoon of vanilla, and 1 tsp of cinnamon for extra flavor...it came out very tasty.

High altitude!....I softened  (not melted) the butter, then combined with the sugar.  Doubled the recipe and added 1/4 tsp baking soda and did 3.5 cups flour.  I baked at 375 for 60 mins. Made 2 loaf pans...one with walnuts, one without.

This was amazing!  I just tweaked it a little and added one more banana, another teaspoon of baking powder and a 1/4 cup more of sour cream.     Slightly melting the butter and mixing all the wet ingredients made the batter so fluffy.  Sooo Soooo good!

Only change I made... Instead of slicing, I mashed bananas, but not smoothly.

This was a very moist and flavorful recipe.  I didn't read the directions but did use the ingredients.   Came out great.  Next time I'll add either blueberries or chocolate chips instead of the nuts.  It's a keeper.

I have made this many times, always comes out perfectly. I soak the raisins in apple juice or rum overnight before making so they stay plump and juicy.  I also use 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour.

This is my go to banana bread recipe.  I add 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips.  Today my son wanted muffins so I used the recipe to make 18 muffins and I baked them at 350º for  20 min.  They were delicious!

I baked in muffin pan instead of loaf.  Cook time was approx 23 min. Also sprinkled walnuts on top instead of mixing in because I had to leave some nut-free. Super moist and love the individual portions..,good for freezing.

I've used this recipe a dozen times now and each time I take that first bite, I'm still incredibly impressed with how moist and flavorful it is. I always make muffins (bake for 15 min) and go heavy on the walnuts, but I am in love with this banana bread. I would marry it and have its banana babies if I could.

I love this banana bread! This is my go to recipe. I do follow other's suggestions to mash the bananas, and add a bit of cinnamon. I also omit the nuts because I don't like them mixed in things. My family loves it. Probably the best banana bread I have ever had!

EDIT TO ADD: I made this today with coconut oil instead of butter, and brown sugar instead of white, and it was excellent.

Made banana bread many different ways, but this one by far is the best. The slicing the bananas vs mashing the banana I think is what made it.

The batter overflowed my pan the first time so I used a bundt pan the second time for only 50 minutes and it came out perfect. I did not have any lemon juice and substituted yogurt for the sour cream. I also used the recipes suggestions by the author in the most helpful positive review. This is an awesome banana nut bread.

This recipe is delish!  Taking from some others, I used butter in place of the shortening, and it came out fine.  Also, I made the recipe into muffins for my little girls - regular size - and baked them approximately 16 minutes.  They came out beautifully!  So incredibly moist, but light.  Great recipe.  You won't be disappointed.

Followed the changes made by naples, as well as added 2 tbls of rum. Also I like it sweet, so I used honey flavored greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. It's delicious!

I omitted the walnuts since my children do not like them, and did not make any other variations. We really liked this one. It has a nice texture, good flavor, and excellent crust. I will make this again, and instead substitute walnuts with chocolate chips!

Very, very moist banana bread.  I took the advice of other reviewers to use softened butter and blend with sugar and also used 1 cup of mashed bananas. I added a little cinnamon but couldn't really taste it, might try for more next time.  I also added chocolate chips.  Very very good.

This is the best banana bread I've ever tasted. It's moist but has a slightly crunchy exterior. And it's not too sweet.

I used all of the ingredients listed.

I did mash the bananas rather than slice them and I creamed my butter and sugar before adding the other ingredients. 

All and all, it's a great banana bread base and will make it again.

****I gave my sister a loaf the first time I made it and she and her husband love this bread.

Love this recipe. I made it almost exactly as stated with just a couple of minor tweaks. Because my husband and I both find a lot of banana bread lacking in banana flavor, I chose to add an additional banana. The 3 bananas provided the perfect amount of banana flavor for us. Instead of slicing the bananas, I went back to kindergarten-like behavior and had some fun with smooshing them. I also very lightly whipped everything with a mixer on the lowest setting in order to get a fluffier resulting banana bread just because that's my preference. Worked like a charm. The bread is moist too. Perfect all around.

I just made this bread I have to say its the best I have ever had. I did use room temperature butter instead of melted butter. I also used 4 mashed bananas instead of 2 sliced. My family loved it!! I will definitely be making this again!! thanks for the great recipe!!

As other bakers suggested, I used mashed bananas and cold butter cut into very tiny pieces to create a cold batter that sort of explodes from the heat of the oven about 15 minutes into baking. I also are always add just a touch more baking soda them recipe called for it was delicious.

I like the versatility of this recipe. I can make it as is, for my family members. I can make it healthier for my crunchy friends. And I even made it with flax and Brewers yeast for breastfeeding milk supply.

I switched out the sour cream for plain greek yogurt and replaced the white sugar with brown sugar  - I think I'll add another half or full banana for more flavor but it was a no fuss banana bread recipe!

I did what other reviewers suggested and smooshed the bananas, but the middle never cooked! I ended up baking it for an additional 2 to 3 hours.

Next to the gluten free banana bread recipe I make this one is wonderful. Doesn't dry out, is so moist. We add mini chocolate chips. And I do mash the bananas. Just get a more even distribution of bananas. Everyone loves it!!!!

Made a few changes: swapped out the butter for virgin cold pressed coconut oil, used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. granulated sugar, and added an extra banana. The recipe made two smaller loaves, one of which was devoured almost immediately. I will definitely make this again. So good! Thank you for the fabulous recipe!

This was my first ever attempt at banana bread, although I do consider myself an intermediate and experienced baker. Turned out great! Coworkers were raving about it! And easy too! I did mash the bananas though (threw all ingredients into my kitchen aid mixer) and I added a bit of cinnamon.

I was slightly disappointed in this recipe.  I used frozen banana and added extra.  I cooked it for the one hour but found it over cooked. It didn't raise very much. It was quite moist, which was it's saving grace.  It tasted good as well.  Mostly it was the look of the finished product that disappointed me.

This is my 'go to' banana bread.  I love the richness and moisture brought by the sour cream.  Play with the sugar whether you like it sweeter or not.  I reduce it a little bit for my own palate .  Also I always mash the banana to be atleast a full cup.

I have altered this recipe through the years. First, I add an extra banana. Unlike some, I love to bite into that chunk of banana, not purée. I also add 1/2 a cup of dark chocolate chips. When I had my toddler and was concerned about choking on the walnuts, I substituted 1/2 a cup of peanut butter chips.

By far the best banana bread recipe I've found. Very moist with a great banana flavor.  After making this recipe per the instructions multiple times, I decided to try a few variations, and I find that I prefer to leave out the walnuts and add three bananas instead of two (and mashed, instead of sliced). After making these small changes, I have found the very best recipe for me! My husband and son always eat the whole loaf within two days and rave about it.

My whole family was raving, huge success!! A couple slight adjustments: I was short on sour cream so used half sour cream half yogurt, and eye-balled most of the rest based on the recipe. Also I probably used extra vanilla and baking soda as I didn't have a tsp measure. Revipe even worked great without walnuts for a couple loaves.

Love this recipe, it always turns out so moist and delicious. I usually mash my bananas instead of slicing them, but it tastes great either way. I have made this several times and have discovered that I like it better with half white sugar and half brown sugar. This recipe is a keeper.

I have four boys and they ALL love this banana bread! I do mash the bananas, chopping them doesn't blend them into the bread the way I like. This way it's distributes flavor more evenly. I always double the recipe. *A note to those of you who want to make cupcake style, it works great. Depending on your oven usually cook roughly 20 minutes for a batch of 12. Check the Center with a toothpick. I've also added chocolate chips which is a big hit with the boys!

I have made this many times, exact ingredients, but I do cream the butter and sugar and smash the bananas (personal preference).  It is one of my family's most requested dishes.  Thanks so much for posting it.

This is the only banana bread recipe I ever make anymore. Out of 10 desserts that were brought in to a Thanksgiving pot luck, this banana bread is disappearing fastest, while others have not even been touched.  It is wonderfully moist with great flavor.

I should note that I make this recipe exactly as written EXCEPT for the bananas.  I mash them instead of slicing because I don't think I'd enjoy chunks of banana in the bread.  I'm not sure how much this changes the recipe since I usually use bananas ripe enough that slicing is not much of an option anyway.

I had some bananas and wasn't sure what to do with it. I tried this recipe with just a few changes. I kept the original version, except I mashed the bananas, added almond extract and shredded sweetened coconut. It was amazing!!!!!!!

I have made this 4 times in 3 weeks. It is that good. It's so easy to make. I use 2 and 1/2 banana's and use both vanilla and cinnamon for flavor. I also mash my bananas to avoid biting into chunks of bananas like some reviewers stated. My family and coworkers now think I'm a banana bread guru. This is definitely one of my most favorite recipes of all times.

This is the best banana bread I've ever made, well actually this is the first time I've ever made banana bread. It turned out perfect. I followed the advice of several other reviewers by adding a 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips and a 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Plus I used three bananas which was equivalent of 1 cup of bananas, and I mashed them to smithereens. The bread is moist and flavorful.  (review #2) I tried adding some baking powder this time as someone else suggested, bad idea. This batch of banana bread was a bit dry.

Easy, tasty, and moist! Followed directions by only using a single pot to combine all ingredients before transferring batter to bread pan. Removed the melted butter and sugar from heat before adding eggs. Because I didn't have sour cream on hand, I substituted with Greek yogurt. Definitely making this my go-to banana bread recipe.

Delicious! I don't usually substitute, but I didn't have sour cream and I REALLY wanted to try this recipe as soon as I saw it. I did have cream cheese, so I mixed 6 tbsp of cream cheese with 1.5 tbsp of milk in my mini food processor. It worked out great! I made large muffins instead of a loaf because I can portion control a lot easier when they are in muffin form. So, I baked them in my muffin tin for 15 mins and they came out perfect! Next time I will use sour cream and see if it makes a difference, but I don't see how they can get much better than this. Highly recommend this recipe!

Made with an extra banana and 1/2 the recommended sour cream. I also add a pinch of pumpkin pie spice and my favourite - Skor bits. Adds some toffee flavour that's delicious.

Loved it! It was my first time making banana bread and this was such an easy recipe to follow and it was so good I made another batch the next day! I did mash my bananas instead of slicing them, I felt it incorporated them a bit better in the bread but I have no need to search another recipe!!

The banana bread was delicious but way too sweet. I made it just like the recipe but I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream because that's what I had on hand and mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. The next time I made this I reduced the sugar by half and it was perfect!!! I made them into 17 muffins. This is my new favourite recipe.

I sometimes use greek yogurt instead of the sour cream. It comes out wonderfully every single time! If you want some variations, you can use fruit yogurt instead of plain. My favorite combination is blueberry banana bread! Yum!

This is my Go-To recipe for banana bread!  It's so easy that the littles can easily help.  It always turns our tender and tasty.  It easily can be made into a large loaf, smaller loves or muffins by adjusting the bake time.  It never turns out rubbery or tough like so many banana breads people make.

First time making banana bread and this is by far the most tastiest banana bread I've ever had!    It's very easy to make and it comes out moist just the way I like it. Nice to have for breakfast with a nice cup of coffee. I would definitely make this again!

Delicious but I substituted chocolate chips for the nuts and mashed the bananas.  I also used yogurt instead of sour cream and creamed room temp butter with sugar  instead of melting the butter. I made it the original way first but preferred the texture and taste this way.

Banana bread is one of those elusive recipes that there is simply so many versions of, its hard to find the "perfect" one. When I made this, I was skeptical, I have made dozens of batches of banana bread just to fall off the wagon,  temporarily give up the search, and give the leftovers to the dog. But this particular recipe is on point! Its moist, not too dense and not at all mushy. Its sweet,  flavorful, with the perfect amount of banana flavor. I absolutely loved it. My stepdaughters, and my 2 year old loved it too! I did follow the recommendation of using 1 3/4 cups of flour, a tsp of baking powder in addition to the baking soda, and I of course mashed the bananas.  I immediately put this in my actual recipe box. Thank you, vjonsson!

Delicious! I did however mash the banana, doubled the vanilla and cut back on the sugar(used 3/4). Will make this again as its a nice change from my personal banana bread recipe, and it's a good way to use up any Sourcream you may have leftover. Next time iI may cut back the sugar even more will try 2/3 cup. Definitely a keeper though!
Update:) I've been enjoying this recipe, and have found that cutting back sugar to 1/2 is amazing. The Bananas already add sweetness. Made these into cupcake sized muffins (15).replacing all the sour cream with Greek yogurt is a healthy alternative, and you get that same tangy flavor and moisture.

I freeze bananas that have gone brown and when I thaw them out, they're usually a molten mess.  No need to slice the bananas as I only have to cut off one end of the peel and the banana slides out.

I made this just as the recipe indicated and it was heavenly.  I think I'll make another one tomorrow just to bring to work.  My in-laws are here and they're both loving this bread.  It's great when I can show mom-in-law what I can do in the kitchen. :)

I chose this recipe because my moms name is Janet and she likes stuff like this... Lol 
I mashed the bananas because I figured they would be too big and slicing would take up time... Also I didn't use nuts because I'm allergic... 
But overall I loved it...!!! Yes I will make this again...!!!

Went by the recipe but mashed bananas rather than slicing them and I used 3 bananas instead of two. Cooked for 45 minutes instead of one hour, which may be my oven. Turned out well, and I shared it with co-workers who quickly devoured it.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have come across period. The only change I made was from the advice of others, instead of 1 cup white sugar, use 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown and a teaspoon cinnamon to the flour mixture. This bread is to die for!!!!!!!!

I love this recipe! It's so easy to make. The first time I made it as is and it came out delicious! The second time I was out of butter and used 1/2 cup of olive oil instead. I have been making with olive oil ever since. I also use 4 bananas instead of two. A definite winner!

Used a blend of whole wheat and bread flour.  Bananas were at peak ripeness.  Baked for 70min. at 350.  This is superior to the other banana breads I have made.

My 5 year old grandson devours this bread.  It has to have nuts in it or he will not eat it.  My daughter will not eat with nuts, so I have to divide the batter into 2 loaf pans. They aren't as high as using just one, but delicious just the same.  The only difference is I use 1 cube of butter flavored Crisco, creamed with the sugar,  and get the same yummy results.  I also use 3  bananas, mashed well.  It is definitely a tried and true recipe.

I've made this recipe a few times now, with the exception of mashing and not slicing the bananas, and it consistently produces a bread that lives up to its title. It is quick and easy and you can customize it also by adding chocolate chips or spices (another reviewer suggested cinnamon and cloves which turned out great). It turns out fine with or without the nuts. I have also made it with coconut oil substituted 1:1 for the butter and it came out great as usual. Also works well for muffins! Thanks!

Very moist bread but the taste was lacking. Used 3 bananas and still lacked on the banana taste. Maybe it is the sour cream cancelling out the flavor? Search for a favorite banana bread is still on.

This was very good. I didn't have walnuts on hand, so I substituted pecans instead. I checked the bread at 50 minutes and it was slightly overdone. I will make this again but will reduce the oven temp to 325.

Amazing! Family had it gone in a day... I used very ripe frozen bananas, which had shrunk a little in the freezer, so I used 3. Otherwise followed exactly. Easy and delicious recipe. Very moist indeed.

This is a great recipe. Very moist. I had to use mayo because we had no sour cream and I put sunflower seeds in it because we had no nuts!  Very tasty. Be sure not to over bake it. I made it the second time and over baked it but it still tasted good, just a little dry.

Amazing recipe. My boys love it. I made this with my son and he made it 3 times for his friends. They love it too that they asked for more. I made some changes though. I incorporated it with my own recipe. I decreased the amount of sugar and used brown instead of white. Added some chocolate chips and ground cinnamon. I mashed the bananas as usual. YUMMY!!!

Awesome recipe.  I follow it pretty much exactly as written, and this bread is delicious.  I actually mash up the bananas instead of slicing, that's the only difference.  I tried adding chocolate chips a couple times, and they just sunk to the bottom of the pan - so just avoid adding things and all should be well.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good. It had a nice flavor. I mashed the bananas rather than chopped them. I think that having them sliced in the bread would give it a weird consistency. The bread was nice and moist and had a good flavor. However, it definitely needs a bit of spice to it, maybe a little bit of cinnamon or something like that. I would make it again.

Great recipe. I did follow the top adjusted recipe with 1 tsp of baking soda and powder, additional flour. I did change the sour cream and used Greek yogurt and I added 1 tsp of cinnamon.

I used greek yogurt (I was out of sour cream). Amazing!!!
55-60 minutes for soft loafs; 70 minutes for loafs that cut nice for toasting and are spreadable (I eat mine with honey and peanut butter)

This is the best recipe so far.  I was doubling the recipe but forgot to do so with the baking soda, vanilla and sour cream.  I always use half the amount of sugar so only used about 3/4 c for 2 loaves.  Turned out great!!

I've made this a couple time now and each is delicious. I add a sprinkle of each cinnamon, nutmeg & allspice to jazz it up. I also smash the bananas instead of slicing. My family loves it everytime.

Amazing! Made this as written and it came out moist and delicious with the perfect amount of banana flavor and sweetness. I then also made this with some alterations: Half sour cream half plain yogurt (b/c I ran out of sour cream), Half all purpose flour and half vanilla protein powder, mashed the bananas vs. sliced them and subbed chopped pecans for walnuts (it's what I had on hand).  And that came out AMAZING too!

I have been making this recipe for years. I have tried many good banana bread recipes, but this is my favorite so far because not only does it come out moist and tasty, but it is easy to make. The only thing I do differently is to mash the bananas.

Delicious! It is the most moist banana bread I have ever eaten. In addition to the vanilla extract, I also added 1 tsp.  almond extract. Since oven baking times vary,when cooking in a glass loaf pan, I have to bake it 73 minutes. When cooking in a metal pan, I have to bake it 70 minutes. Love,  love, love the recipe!

I've made several types of Banana Bread before, and this recipe went well with a pumpkin bread recipe. Both breads highlight the moist texture and the strong flavors from the banana and the pumpkin.

Great recipe! I also mushed bananas instead of slicing as suggested by many other reviewers. I also made it recently adding 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips, and it came out very good, the kids love it of course. Next time I would use the mini chips so they don't sink toward the bottom as much. This is my go-to banana bread recipe!

Great basic recipe.  I used 1 c. mashed bananas because I don't want to find slimy pcs of banana :)   I didn't melt the butter but let it soften.    Added 1 t. lemon juice and 1 t. baking powder.  Increased flour to 1-3/4c.   I also split the batter into 2 loaf pans because I like LOTS of crust.  Fabulous!

This banana bread is Delicious! I made it this morning , the only thing different is I put in 3 bananas, they were on the smaller size, and I had no stick butter so used Parkay and I used self rising flour instead. This bread baked for 73 minutes. After cooling it cut perfectly and was moist, not at all dry or heavy. I did not melt the Parkay just cut it into the sugar with a fork. This is a keeper!

This was the best Banana Bread I have ever tasted! I had a slice right out of the oven with a bit of butter and a cup of tea. Heavenly!!!  It is moist,  light and fluffy with the right amount of sweetness.

Very yummy! I gave it 4 stars only bc I made adjustments to it. First of all, I was doubling the recipe bc my family of 4 boys goes through a loaf in one sitting. Lol. I mashed the banana, did half white and half brown sugar bc I like the brown better. Then I substituted non-fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream as we do for several recipes around here. It is super moist and flavorful. Thank you for the tips!

I set the oven as directed and used all the same measurements but I made a few minor alterations to accommodate what I had at hand. 

I had already puréed a cup of banana (1 1/2 bananas) so I used that instead of two sliced bananas. I replaced the sour cream and vanilla extract with vanilla yogurt, and because I didn't have any walnuts laying around I just used white chocolate chips (I usually throw some sliced almonds in what I am making but I was out). I also used demerara instead of white sugar.

Instead of keeping the eggs separate from the other wet ingredients I mixed them all together before throwing them in with the dry ingredients and used a manual egg beater to mix it all together, then a fork to make sure it was completely blended.

It's still warm and over half the loaf is gone already! Thank you, Janet!

I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them.

One day I am hoping to have a bakery and if I ever wanted to make banana bread this is the recipe I would use. It's that good.

Love this recipe!!! It is the only one I use for making banana bread. I always double the ingredients to make two loaves as it is all eaten within the same day I make it.

I also mashed the bananas.  I mixed the sugar and softened butter by hand-mostly anyway, I was on the phone- and mixed everything else by hand too.  I use real butter, and to soften the butter I usually put it in the microwave for 20 seconds.  It makes a great crust.  The bread was not as good as I hoped.  It was good though,  with a good banana taste.  Might leave out nuts if I made it again.  It cooked in the time specified- I have the issue w many banana breads that they don't cook in the time they are supposed to.

My family loves these. We omit the nuts but only because my husband is allergic. But these are so light and fluffy it's difficult to stop eating them!

Love this recipe. This recipe also works great for banana bread muffins. If you make muffins though I would advise baking them for about 35 min then checking them about every five minutes until done. The first time I made these I ran out of white sugar and substituted with brown sugar. I now make them with 3/4 cups white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar. Amazing recipie

I make this at least once a month! It's the best banana bread I've had!  I normally only use 3/4 cup of sugar and it's perfect, 1 cup is too much sugar and it just kills the banana flavour.

As suggested by others, I creamed the butter with the sugar and mashed the bananas.  The bread was moist and easy to slice; not crumbly like other recipes I've followed. Will make this one again!

Made one loaf with hazelnuts instead of walnuts, and made one loaf with chocolate chips. Both came out beautifully and delicious.

Love this recipe- the sour cream really makes it! Slight variations: I creamed room temp butter with the sugar, then added the eggs one at a time, vanilla and finally beat in the dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, I combined the sour cream and bananas using a hand mixer, then stirred it into the larger mixture. Baked in two small loaf pans for about 45 minutes. Freezes beautifully, too.

Made as directed (except I had no nuts). I love how the sliced bananas make little yummy soft banana pockets in the bread. Definitely a yummy recipe!

Although, I mashed the bananas and skipped the walnuts.

The BEST banana bread in the world!  Instead of bread I make muffins.  The only problem with it is that after you have made them and shared with your neighbors (I live in Senior housing) everyone wants to know when you will make more.  They all agree that they are the best they have ever tasted.  One woman approached me and said she hates banana bread but decided to see what mine taste like and even she loved them.

Great recipe! The few changes I made include- creaming the softened butter with 1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I added a 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and used 1 1/2 cups mashed bananas.  This is a keeper and I will  definitely make it again!

I thought this banana bread was awesome. I made some changes to fit what I had in the house and for dietary restrictions. 1) I had no sour cream so I added 2-3 more bananas, smashed. All my bananas were smashed. 2) I used gluten free flour instead of normal flour. 3) I used Splenda instead of regular sugar. It still turned out out AWESOME !! Very moist and delicious. I made it a second time using sour cream, Splenda and gluten free flour. Turned out AWESOME as well. I needed to add some water (about 1/2 cup) to all the recipes I made due to the batter being too thick. But other than that, it was great!

This is my FAVORITE Banana Bread recipe. If you don't like nuts in bread, cakes or cookies though, just use nut flavoring. I used Black Walnut flavoring for this recipe, and you get the flavor of the nut without the actual nut. Also, i wait till my bananas are mostly black, the flavor level of bananas is highest then.

Excellent. Used 3 bananas instead of 2 and nixed the walnuts. Mashed the frozen and thawed bananas, not sliced.

It is great! I made it today and instead of slicing the bananas I mashed them and I replaced the nuts with chocolate chips and it was really good. The last couple times I've made this I've added some cinnamon in and omg it was so good. Thanks for the recipie??

I made muffins instead of a loaf and I got 16 out of the batch. (I baked them for about 20 minutes.)  I subbed chocolate chips for the walnuts.  I did mash the bananas before folding in as it didn't seem liked slicing them would allow for the best incorporation of ingredients.  The muffins were moist and delicious.  I'll absolutely make them again!

I liked it! It's easy to put together. I cooked it for a bit longer and covered it with foil at the end.

Followed the recipe almost exactly...didn't melt the butter just let it and all the ingredients come to room temperature...came out beautifully. Made 1 loaf and 24 muffins. Then experimented by adding chocolate chips to another batch...yummy! Decided to make some more muffins (I had too many bananas going bad) but since I didn't have anymore sour cream subbed an individual container of peach Greek yogurt. Once again delicious. Fabulous recipe and will now be my go to banana bread recipe.

So so moist and so delicious. The only thing I did differently then the recipe calls for is whipping together the butter, sugar and eggs until it was super fluffy!!!! My son and I cannot stop eating it. Soooo good!  I highly recommend this recipe!

I made this earlier this week to rave reviews. I did make a few changes, starting with leaving the nuts out. With so many people having allergies to nuts these days, I erred on the side of caution and left them out. I also opted to mash the bananas, rather than leave them sliced. And, in addition to the vanilla, I added a couple of teaspoons of banana flavoring. The resulting bread was very tasty, soft textured, and had an intense banana flavor. I'll be making this again this week.

This is my absolute favorite recipe for banana bread! I leave out the walnuts (not a big fan), and instead of slicing the bananas, I mash them up. This banana bread is so soft and delicious. Definitely a keeper! It's the only recipe I use

First time baking except the pre-done cookie dough father-daughter thing. It was quite tasty first time out, moist, delicious. Added a cup of raisins that I had soaking in port for a year and half to the next batch and family (minus the kids) and friends could not get enough. This recipe makes me feel like a god in the kitchen

I made them into muffins by simply cutting down the cooking time to 25 minutes, then allowing them to cool in the baking tin for another 10 minutes.  They were moist and delicious!  Thank you for the amazing recipe!

*Also, to save time and energy, I mixed all ingredients in an electric mixer including adding the bananas whole.  It still turned out wonderful! :)

Super Moist!

We also sometimes make it with these adjustments for sweeter, moist banana bread:
-1/4 cup semi-sweet mini chocolate chips
-Replace 1 Cup Sugar, with 1/2 Cup Brown Sugar, 1/2 Cup White Sugar
-Coconut oil instead of butter
-Bake at 325 for 90 minutes

This recipe is great! Though I always make them into muffins and sub the walnuts for chocolate chips... I also use a coconut milk yogurt that's dairy free rather than sour cream as we have an allergy to milk! They're lovely though! Thank you !

Hands down the best BNB I have ever made.  I followed another reviewer's advice and made sure to cream the butter/sugar (not melted) and use exactly one cup of mashed bananas.  I actually removed the other BNB recipe from my recipe box to make sure this was the only one I ever make again.

This is the best banana bread I've ever had, and everyone that tries it agrees. I follow the recipe exactly, except I mash the bananas instead of slicing them (though sliced tastes good too, the banana just looks purple when baked).

This is such a yummy banana bread recipe! Only thing I changed was instead of slicing bananas I mashed them. First time I made this I sliced the bananas and I didn't care for it. The purple slimy bananas were rather intimidating. But overall this recipe rocks!

Thanks for sharing this recipe Janet, I just loved it. It was such a simple recipe but the result was so moist and delish. I added sultanas & cranberries to mine and this is now my new go to recipe for Banana Bread. Thanks again.

This is a terrific recipe! I too added the 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/8 tsp of cloves as one of the other reviews noted and it made the bread even better tasting! I have tried softening and creaming the butter with the sugar and I have tried melting the butter as the recipe notes and no matter which way...it still tastes great!

I'm don't bake much but I can follow this recipe and the resulting banana bread is SOOO good. The bread is moist and tasty. I don't add nuts (because my child is allergic) but I'll often add chocolate chips.

Excellent recipe, not too sweet and moist. I did have to substitute, only out of necessity, I didn't have any sour cream, so I used plain Greek yogurt instead. I think it was the best banana bread I have made!

I was wondering what could replace the sour cream. I was also wondering if the bananna bread would taste the same without sour cream and nothing replacing the sour cream?????

I absolutely love this recipe and have made it many, many times.  Instead of slicing the bananas, I mash mine.  Hands-down the best banana bread recipe I've found (and I've tried several)!

I made it exactly as written but no nuts. I added the sour cream and banana after mixing in the flour. The recipe made four mini loaves.

I mashed the bananas rather than slicing them. I also cut back the white sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 cup brown sugar, and used chocolate chips in place of nuts.

This banana bread is amazing! It's really good with a glaze. I substituted coconut yogurt for the sour cream and coconut oil for the butter. I also used einkorn flour. Delicious!

Best Banana Bread EVER!  I did use room temperature butter and creamed it well.  I also used 1-3/4 cup flour and a teaspoon each of baking powder and soda.  As a personal preference I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  I also like my bananas mashed for a better flavor and I added 3 of them.  This will be my new Banana Bread recipe!  Thanks for sharing.  Yum!

The first time I made it, I didn't put in sour cream because I didn't have any on hand. It was really good. So I decided to make if again but this time with the sour cream and it was delicious! I will always use this recipe for now on!

I creamed the butter and sugar instead of melting the butter and mashed the bananas to make 1 cup as someone else said. I used maple flavoring instead of the vanilla extract and it was sooo good! I'm definitely making this again (and again and again)!

I just enjoyed my first slice, hot out of the oven. Delicious, sweet and moist. I doubled recipe to make two loaves, and left out nuts because I didn't have any on hand. Having sliced, rather than mashed, the bananas doesn't bother me a bit. If my family mentions it, I'll mash next time.

I made sure there was at least a full cup of banana (came to three bananas), added tsp of baking powder and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. Also used plain yogurt in place of sour cream and mashed the banana. Soooooo good. We ate it still steaming hot out of the oven with butter.

Every time I make this it comes out great.  I also mash the bananas and usually sub Greek yogurt for the sour cream because I always have it on hand.  I cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup but sprinkle some extra on top before baking.

I have made this a few times and it's delicious and very easy to make. I use a lactose free vanilla yogurt in place of sour cream. I also add 1 tsp of baking powder along with the baking soda, and 1 tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg for extra flavor. I also mash the bananas.

Love this! I've always hated the taste of synthetic banana, so it was great to find such an easy recipe. The only thing I didn't like was the pieces of banana in the bread, the banana taste would have been weaker, plus biting into a piece of browned banana wouldn't be pleasant, so I pureed them instead. I also cut down the sugar by half. I usually wait until I have very ripe bananas to make the bread. It gives it more flavor plus it helps sweeten it. Overall, very great and very tasty. If I could give it five more stars I would!

I changed it a little by using plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It doesn't change the taste but makes it a little healthier. JJ

Very moist and rich in flavor. I had extra bananas so I used those, in total it was 5 medium sized ones. I had pure vanilla and used 2 teaspoons of it. Make sure you do not over stir the batter.

Can't give all five stars because for me, the bananas should be mashed. Other than that this recipe is great and the only one I've kept coming back to again and again. Yum. 
Eta- I have played around using different flours and you can't seem to go wrong. Whole wheat, white, gluten free or a combo :)

I first found and made this recipe 3-1/2 years ago when there were only 1,456 reviews!!!  I just found this recipe again and about ready to start baking. This is a great recipe "as is" and just fine with all the variations, too. I am so glad I found my "printed" version with my own tweaks. I give credit where credit is due. Thank you, Janet, great recipe!!!

Mashed bananas instead of slicing. Also added a dash of cinnamon. Super moist and full of flavor.

This was a very good recipe, it was quick and easy. Definitely smash the bananas with a fork instead of cutting them. I also added 1/2 cup of peanut butter at the same time as the sour cream, it was great! Just a slight peanut taste added to the recipe. thank you! This is a good way too use up those extra bananas that never got used.

I made this bread last night for the kids (because a bunch of bananas went bad overnight) and it is excellent. I only tried a small piece but I wanted so much more. I did mash the bananas like many reviewers said, and my bananas were mushy ripe. I made a double batch so I could give some away, and had to make just one change based on what I had available. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup Brown. Also my husband and I couldn't decide if our bananas were medium or small so I used all 6 bananas and the banana flavor was perfect. The only real change I made was adding a teaspoon of cinnamon. After about 45 minutes in the oven the kitchen smelled delicious. I did cook for 60 minutes at 350 in a gas oven and that worked out well. I will definitely use this recipe again because these would make perfect small gifts for co-workers at Christmas time.

I made this recipe with a couple of variations, and it was wonderful.  I don't recommend slicing the bananas; mash them, of course.  Also, we aren't huge nut lovers at our house, so I replaced the nuts with cinnamon chips, and oh my, YUM!  Eat it with butter while it's hot; that's fruit and dairy.  What more could you ask for?  Give yourself a pat on the back for making a healthy choice ;-)

Good!  Would be 5 stars if the bananas were mashed.  I also creamed the sugar with softened butter, and not melted butter as written.

Excellent banana bread !  tip : I used the flour for cakes that already has salt and baking powder and omitted the baking soda. I used pecans instead of walnuts as I prefer them and added a 1/4 cup of dark chocolate chips .My daughter called me the Queen of Banana Bread and it's me first time baking ANYTHING!! will definitely be making it over and over again. I too mashed the bananas ...

I followed the tweaks that naples34102 suggested and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. We don't like our banana bread overly sweet. I creamed the banana and sour cream with the wet ingredients.   I also toasted the walnuts.  Bit hit, no leftovers at potluck.

It is 5-stars recipe in all aspects: taste, moisture, density. It is easy to make. Next day it tastes even better. 
As I try to watch calories and eat healthy, I made some changes: reduced amount of sugar to 3/4 cups (use organic brown sugar); substituted butter with coconut oil and sour cream with fat-free plain Greek yogurt. I did not have walnuts, so I replaced with almonds. 
The recipe is a keeper. I highly recommend to give it a try.

Absolutely LOVE this banana bread!! First time I made it my kids demolished half a loaf before I could stop them! I always make a double batch now, and it turns out perfect every time! We recently made some banana bread french toast with this as well, the kids and my husband loved it. I have to say in all honesty I'm not a banana bread fan, and as someone who generally doesn't like it, I think this turns out wonderful!

Far and away the best banana bread. Easy to mix up, no mixer needed. I bake for 65 min. I add a dash of cinnamon and I mash bananas, that's all I change. This is so delicious and moist. The butter adds so much flavor too.  Decadent treat but I always end up sharing it with many people. I bake in a glass 8x8" pan for 40 min.

Best banana bread recipe I've ever had, hands down. I love that I don't need rotten black bananas for this recipe - because they are sliced I can use just slightly over-ripe ones.  I've substituted yogurt for the sour cream sometimes and it's just as good.  I've also tried chocolate chunks instead of nuts last time and it was also fantastic.  
This is the only banana bread I will ever make again!

I have hunted, searched & tried many banana bread recipes looking for one that is rich in flavor and moist. I have finally found the one I want.   The only change I made was the one suggested by many people, I mash the bananas rather than slice, using a full cup. It's really a great recipe!

Grandma's banana bread always turned out incredibly heavy and dry. I love her but not her recipe. I have tried scores of different banana breads and finally I found the PERFECT recipe! So moist and light and a recipe I will be proud to pass along to my children and grandchildren.

Love this! It's a little too sweet for my taste so I cut the sugar way down to 1/3 cup. Super ripe bananas sweetens it perfectly. I substituted half of the butter with coconut oil. I added chocolate chips because you can never go wrong with chocolate + banana. Fun to make with my 5 year-old, I just prep the dry stuff ahead of time and let her handle the banana mashing. I doubled the batch to bring some to my sister-in-law who just had twins but after one bite I decided I didn't want to share and will just buy her something else. It's that delicious!

Best recipe I've found.  It's now my go to.  Made exactly as described but added a pinch  of cinnamon and did 2 large Bananas  instead of medium. And if you do that u will need to keep an eye in it and make sure it doesn't over flow.  I just tuck it in all around.  then instead of slicing   I just smashed them in the peel until they  squeezed out.  It's important to fold the sour cream and Bananas  .  I also rotate half way through and do not take it out of pan when done .  I use pam for greasing..

This is my go-to banana bread recipe! It comes out perfectly every time! We like to add chocolate chips & chopped pecans to ours. It is a family favorite!

Really moist and delicious.  The texture is different because the bananas are sliced instead of mashed.  I like change, though, and it's one of the best I've tasted for sure.

OH MY YUMMINESS!!! I followed this recipe exactly and used my Kitchen Aid to mix everything. The only thing I did was add frozen blueberries. Delish!!! Will definitely be using this recipe as my go-to banana bread recipe. 
I saw some of the comments saying they used flavored yogurt in place of sour cream. Can't wait to try that next!!

Like everyone else said- MASH THE BANANAS!!! Other than that, this worked out great. I used to make banana bread with yogurt instead of sour cream, but I didn't really taste the difference. For extra points, wait til the bananas get brown before trying this, and bake with a shallow pan of water in the oven, preferably on the rack directly below. I brought this to my class and everyone loved it- maybe the professor will give me extra points on the final exam?

Great reciepe.  I have sliced banana before yet I prefer mashed.  I added cinnamon and cloves to spice it up.  Another trick I like is to butter pan and sprinkle mixture of cinnomon and sugar.  It really dresses it up.  The first time I made it I tried sourcream next time I did not have enough sub with plain yogurt could not tell a difference.  So next time trying just yougurt  better for my waist.  Can't go wrong.  Another banana bread I like is Sourcream banana bread.

Great recipe. I made a few changes to the original recipe. I use 2 bananas per loaf and mash them up with a fork. If I am out of sour cream, I substitute non-fat greek yogurt and it works great. I add in chocolate chips as well. Whenever I bring a loaf of this banana bread with me, I get rave reviews.

This is the only recipe I've tried for banana bread and will never try another!  I mashed the bananas(because I don't like bananas and was afraid of chunks) and everyone loves it!  Have made it 5 times this month...

My ex has been baking banana bread for years and it was delicious. HOWEVER, my kids now think their dad makes the best banana bread in the world! Easy and delicious recipe! I double it and put one loaf in the freezer. Great addition to any meal.

I loved this recipe. The only thing I changed was I did half white sugar and half brown and threw in a pinch of cinnamon. Also, I prefer the bananas to be mashed instead of sliced so there aren't big bites of banana.

I mashed the bananas up after reading some other reviews. I also used light sour cream. My kids said it was as good as their grandma's! Which I consider a big compliment! I'd use the recipe again.

Dairy free!  I love this recipe.  I've been using another recipe with my dairy free substitutions, but something about the balance of ingredients in this recipe make the bread very moist.  I always use three mashed bananas and add cinnamon.  For my dairy free substituting I used coconut oil instead of butter, almond milk instead of sour cream.

I only had one banana that automatically mashed due to it being so over ripe, and I had to substitute the sour cream with plain Greek yogurt because that's what I had. I followed all other instructions and ingredients  from the original recipe exactly as written. THIS WAS AMAZING!!!  :) thanks for a perfect recipe!

I had two unused brown bunches of bananas. I made four loafs with this recipe using about 3.5 bananas per loaf. Due to limited sour cream, I only used 1/4 cup of sour cream and added 1 tsp cinnamon. This recipe was so fragrant that the neighbor's kids commented about how good it smelled. When I brought them a loaf, the kids were very happy and I got lots of gratitude and smiles. Very rich and much better than my old recipe.

I altered the recipe after reading the tips of several reviewers. Alterations: Used 3 bananas instead of 2, added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white as opposed to all white, added 2 handfuls of coconut flakes and several strawberries(both my idea). Used shortening instead of butter as I did not have much butter. Omitted walnuts. It turned out very good, but I still feel improvement could be made. Next time I make this I will try toasting the coconut for more flavor, and using butter or at least butter flavored shortening as well as including the walnuts. Also, it took 5-10 min longer to bake for me.

Went looking for a new banana bread recipe that would be moister than the one I have been using for years. (I believe I got mine from The Joy of Cooking). This recipe turned out just as I wanted. Only variation was I mashed the bananas  and made then as muffins. I also added chocolate chips to half the muffins and omitted the walnuts. Yummy!

This is a wonderful recipe. Very moist and as always, I mash my bananas to give an even taste to the bread.
I substitute sour cream with greek yogurt which gives it a very good texture and taste.  Don't forget to add a handful of chocolate chips for an even yummier banana bread.

REally good. Although I think that my oven was hotter than others. … after 60 minutes the bread turned out really moist in most spots and dry in others. I have no clue why that would happen. I'm def. going to try this again. Thanks!!

This recipe makes an excellent Banana Bread. I did make a change one time though. I didn't have any sour cream, so I substituted 1/2 cup Coconut Milk and 2 tblsp Lime Juice. This is my favourite recipe now, using either sour cream or coconut milk and lime juice.

I've made this several times now & my hubby always asks me when I'm making it again!  Only thing I changed is baking it in a square cake pan instead of a loaf pan. I found that in the cake pan it bakes more evenly in the time suggested. This has become my go to recipe & it's great served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert!

This is a magnificent recipe. I've made it about 6 times now, as written and tweaked. This is what I ended up with. I mash the bananas. I added the sour cream and vanilla to the butter mixture BEFORE I combined it with the dry ingredients. I also added one tsp of banana extract and 1/4 tsp of butter extract. Extracts can make the things your baking come out over-the-top fantastic. But ease into it. It's easy to use to much.

EXCELLENT !  I did follow the suggestions of naples43102 and added 1 tsp cinnamon which is my personal preference.  Added this one to my personal cook book--you know the one we always go to !!  I made muffins also with great success.

Thanks a true keeper

Phenomenal recipe!! I didn't have any sour cream so took others advice and used yogurt. I used half white/half brown sugar. I used softened (not melted) butter, and mashed bananas, not sliced. This was so moist that I thought it wasn't cooked all the way! It's delicious and I'd recommend it to anyone!

I've tried a few other recipe's and none of them take me back to my Grandmother's banana bread like this one. It was delicious! I did smash up the banana's though, sliced banana's don't hold their integrity long so smashed is best. Definitely going to stick with this recipe!!

Wonderful recipe. Absolutely love it...
**changes I made were I used strawberry yogurt instead of the sour cream and I used a cup of mashed bananas in place of sliced bananas like a lot of other reviewers suggested.
Thank you vjonsson for this recipe,  I'll definitely be making again

This is a great recipe. I add different things every time I make it and it always turns out great! Sometimes I add ground flax seed, cinnamon, almonds, nutmeg,or swap out the sour cream for yogurt. What ever I have that we need to use up. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Excellent recipe! Extremely moist! Made this recipe into muffins for the boys lunches. I did follow the advice of other bakers and added the bananas into the mixer...also I added 1 t of cinnamon.   Due to a kid with braces..i topped 1/2 with the, walnuts. It's a keeper! Thank you?

Such a great recipe! I did mash the bananas and added chocolate chips. The only problem I had was that the chips stuck to the bottom of the pan making it hard to get out, but I just put it back together. I baked it at 325 degrees for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Delicious!

I recently tried this recipe and loved it! I did not follow it exactly. The only thing I did different was use self-rising flour and omitted the baking soda & salt. Also, I had only Pecans on hand and used them.

I was so pleasantly surprised at how moist and delicious it turned out! I love it. I have shared it with family & they loved it. I even had to come back and find the exact recipe to send to my sister.

It tastes more like cake than bread to me. If you need a quick dessert that people will rave about, try this! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe, Janet!

I make this banana bread gluten free.  I follow the recipe almost exactly except I use Gluten Free Mama flour and I use chocolate chips instead of walnuts and extra banana's.  I make them into muffins and freeze them.  No one but me knows they are gluten free, I get asked to make them all the time.  Great recipe!

I loved this recipe.  It's the first time I've tried sliced bananas and thought it was great.  I used 1/4c walnuts and 1/4c chocolate chips. Surprisingly, there was some the next day but the texture and taste were still great.
Delicious and I will definitely try it again.

Great flavor but it's almost too moist. I had to bake for about 15 minutes more than stated.

Absolutely love this. So moist and full of flavour. I added one tspn cinnamon and removed the nuts (for school lunch). I've made it three times already and as soon as it's made, it's gone. Some excellent reviews got my attention and they were right.

This is a great banana bread! I substituted nonfat Greek yogurt as I usually do and it was really good. I will probably add more bananas next time as a personal preference. The consistency is like bread pudding. Oh. So. Good.

I make this recipe all the time now. I substitute sour cream with Greek yogurt, and I'm not into nuts in bread so I leave those out. I tried it with four bananas mashed one time, which made it chewy and extra flavorful. The recipe is very moist and delicious.

I followed the recipe except 1)mashed two large very ripe bananas 2) used 1/2 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder 3) used pecans b/c had no walnuts.   Turned out perfectly.   It really is the best recipe I've used and I've tried several different ones.   Highly recommended....

Perfect bread! The only thing I did was double the bananas and mash them.

I've also made this as a double recipe with only 1.5 cups sugar, mashed bananas, 2 cups AP flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, and 1 cup squeezed shredded zucchini. I start it at 375F then knock it down to 350 for about 1.5 hours.

I really liked this recipe! On thing I noticed is that it didn't have much banana flavor... So instead of adding another banana and making it more heavy I heated the banana in the microwave and added the juice and I also added 1 Tsp of cinnamon to give it some extra flavor. I also added tin foil to the outside of the loaf during the last ten minutes to prevent the outside from burning.

This is a fantastic recipe. When my bananas are too ripe for eating, this is always my go to recipe. It is so moist and delicious each time. The only little adjustment I make is using 3 bananas instead of 2. Yummy!!

VERY surprised how perfect it turned out… Ive tried many, many others and this one was the best. Even the  other family members said it was so moist and very delicious. They said this was the best one Ive made in a long time. Slicing the bananas sounded strange to me but I did it anyway. I sliced them rather thin, probably less than 1/4 inch, and it was incredible!!! Bread was perfect, nothing sticky or gooey.. Bananas cooked right into the bread.  I will for sure make this again!!!  I substituted nothing. Thanks!

This is my new favorite banana bread recipe!  I have tried a lot of them and this one cooked the way it was supposed to. I have toddler granddaughters so I omitted the walnuts (which I love), and it turned out great!

This recipe is great! It's easy to follow and makes some of the best batter I've ever had! I did add 4 bananas instead of the called-for 2, and that just made the banana flavor even better.

I  used the recommendations of Naples34102 review and went one step further and added fresh blueberries.  These were moist and popping with flavor. I found that in order to get 1 cup of mashed bananas it took about 3 medium bananas. I used the mini chopper for the walnuts. The sour cream and lemon juice  I used the 60 minute bake time for the larger loaf pan, the jumbo muffins and little loafs took about 35-40 minutes.

This is the best banana bread ever! I took some of the recommendations and did not melt the butter. I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I did add 1 tsp of apple pie spice which has nutmeg and cloves. And I added 1/2 cup of raisins because my boyfriend lives raisins. It turned out so moist and delicious. I double the recipe so it makes 2 loaves. You must try this recipe!

Best banana bread. U can see how moist it will be when you fold in banana and sour cream. I've made it many times. You can adjust with choco chips,  make muffins, use half almond flour, raisins... Whatever you like

Great recipe I've added a little more bananas and I haven't cooked it full term like the recipe says every time I've cook it,  I've only cooked it for 45 minutes. Leave it moist and good a must try.

Delicious! My only recommendation is add more banana (I used 4) and instead of sour cream I used vanilla yogurt.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This bread is very moist, with a nice crust. Delicious! The only thing is that i didnt fold the last step enough. So my bread had white spots due to the sour cream.  Next time ill mix the last 3 ingredients separately before adding them to the flour mixture.

I made two loaves. The first batter I made tasted so good I had to make another. The bread is very moist and really good. My first loaf was baked at 350 for 58 minutes, but it was a little dark (still delicious though!) the second loaf was baked at 345 for 55 minutes, and came out perfect.

Delicious every time I make it.  The only thing I do differently is to mash the bananas before I put them in...it's just a personal preference.

Did not care for the taste of this recipe.  Top of the bread the next day turned "mushy".  Will not be making this bread again.  More of a buttery taste than a banana-y taste.  Even added an extra very ripe banana to the recipe.  Disappointed.

I made this with these variations from naples34102 and it was delicious! "I cream the softened butter with the sugar (not melted). I add 1 tsp. lemon juice with the vanilla, and use 1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder, and 1-3/4 c. flour. Finally, regardless of how many bananas are used it should equal 1 cup." I smashed/creamed the bananas, though. This will be my go to banana bread recipe from now on!

More of a question than a review - first time using this recipe, and instead of rising in the center it sunk. It probably still tastes good, but it just doesn't look right. Any ideas as to why this happened? I should have known better than to try a new recipe for an important event without doing some research first .  Please let me know if you have any suggestions for me.

So moist and yummy!
I didn't have a 9×5 pan so I used 2 8×3 silicone molds and baked at the same temperature for 50 minutes.
Best eaten when it just cooled down, moist inside and a lil cruncy outside.
Next time, I'll add crunch topping to make it even better. ? thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly EXCEPT , I mashed the bananas. I baked the regular size loaves a bit longer and reduce the temperature 25 degrees for the smaller person size loaves....also I coverd them lightly with foil so they wouldn't burn once the top had set.  And I sprinkled little cinnamon and sugar mixture into the prepared pan.....just a little extra touch. :-)

Best banana nut bread EVER! I stored it in a large plastic bag and it stayed moist and fresh over the next four days or so that it took me and my husband to eat it. I'm never using any other banana nut bread recipe again.

Delicious!  I sprinkled the nuts on top (instead of incorporating throughout) so it would be easy to avoid them for my one daughter who is too young to eat nuts yet.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it came out great.  This is definitely going to become a regular in our house!

I usually make Banana bread using a recipe I got from my ex-sister-in-law years ago.  I modified that recipe to get it to the flavor and consistency I liked and so I thought I would try this recipe because of the ratings it got and see how it turned out.  I doubled the recipe as I wanted two loaves.  I did substitute half of the sugar with brown sugar and added cinnamon, nutmeg and a dash of clove. I also used half of the baking soda and then used baking powder for the other half. I used some plain Greek yogurt for part of the sour cream as I needed to use up the yogurt.  It turned out beautifully and came out of pan very nicely.  It was a little darker than I like but was completely done on the inside - knife came out clean. I might add one more banana in the future and maybe shorten the baking time to get a lighter crust but I do like the chunks of banana in the bread.  I did not slice the bananas but mashed them into small chunks and that was a nice change.  I did omit the walnuts as I am allergic but I would try pecans in the future.  My daughter said that she thought this bread was more "fluffy" than my usual. Thank you for this great recipe.  My family loved it!

This bread is AMAZING!!  I made a few minor additions- a teensy bit of nutmeg, and clove. A REAL TEENSY BIT.   Otherwise,  I didn't change a thing!   I highly recommend this recipe.

i absolutely loved this recipe but what i did differently was that i baked them in a Wilton mini cupcake mold for 14 minutes instead of 60 and they were cooked through and delicious with cold milk or just like that. what my sister has been doing is baking it in a loaf pan but in a slow cooker and drizzzles nutella on top which is really yummy too!

Used the Krusteaz Gluten Free flour from Sam's Club as a cup for cup replacement. Baked 20 min for muffins. Look great. 
Snuck a taste. Great! Even warm and I usually think banana bread tastes better the next day

I have a question.  My quick breads always split at the top.  While does nothing to affect the taste, slicing seems to be hindered.  Any suggestions on how to result in a smooth top?

I made this banana bread twice in 2 weeks. First time I had wayy to much banana, and it came out flat and solid, but good. Second time around, I followed recipe using organic ingredients but substituted nuts for instant Quaker oats (1cup+). it turned out perfectly and filling! Great recipe for sure!!!

I did not mash the bananas. Rather, I combined the sour cream with the bananas inside a blender, and blended them together.
Afterwards, I poured on to flour mixture and stirred. While stirring, I added the 1+cups of Quaker oats.

I love love this recipe. My first attempt at banana bread and it turned out great. My variations were: Whole milk instead of sour cream & peanuts instead of almonds. Oh and 3/4 castor sugar because I'm not much of a sweet tooth

Do not used sliced bananas!  The texture is unpleasant, very mushy when you bite it. Also, you don't get the banana flavor all the way through.  I made it again, and I used 4 bananas that I smashed up and it was perfect.  I also didn't have walnuts, so I used pecans.  Very good, tasty and delish.  Mine took an extra 7 minutes to be cooked through.

Perfect! I've never made banana bread before and this recipe was the way to start! 

The recipe says sliced bananas but the video shows them being mashed.  I mashed mine and this loaf turned out terrific. I will definitely be making this again.

After reading some of the reviews I did make a few adjustments.  I  added 1/2 C brown sugar and reduced white sugar to 1/2 C. I added 1 tsp of lemon juice, 1 tsp of baking powder, 1/4 C flour, and omitted the salt. I mashed the bananas measuring 1 C, took about 2 1/2 medium bananas.  since I did not have any walnuts I added pecans instead.  This bread came out moist and flavor was amazing.  It sliced up perfectly. My husband said it was best banana bread he ever tasted. Did not take long for this one to disappear. This one is a keeper....kdp1023

This was a hit in my house and neighborhood! I was short on time so I made muffins instead of a loaf.  Also, I used 3 smashed bananas instead of slicing 2.  This will definitely be my go to recipe for banana nut bread!

This turned out wonderful for me.  Light and flavorful.  I followed the recipe as written.  It took 70-75 minutes and I needed to turn the heat down for the last 15 since the edges were browning but the middle wasn't done.  This worked well.  It was a very yummy quick bread.

The best banana bread, ever!  I like the sliced bananas in it instead of the mashed. My two year old will not eat banana bread, but loves "candy bread." I learned over the years to add "candy" or "chips" to everything! It has worked with my four children!

This bread is the best.  I double the recipe.  I use 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown.  I also use 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 wheat flour. I have given many loaves away to friends and they all love it.  Thank  you for sharing.

This is the ONLY recipe I use to make this.  Everyone loves it when I make this and have not had any complaints ever. 
I leave out the nuts for the ones that are allergic and sometimes I add chocolate chips just for fun.

This bread was very good. I didn't add the nuts because I'm not fond of them in my bread. The only other things I changed was I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. And I mixed in the bananas so they were mixed in well. Very good, very, very good!!!

I'd never made banana bread before, but I had some really ripe bananas and I wanted to try since I really love banana bread. This recipe was really easy to follow. I did follow other reviewers though and mashed my bananas instead of slicing them. I skipped the walnuts because I didn't have any. I'd also never heard of using sour cream in bread before. Well, the result was amazing! My banana bread was moist and tastes great! It was a huge hit!

Makes the best banana bread!!! I roughly smash the bananas with a fork rather than slicing them and also add in some chocolate chips. However, the recipe is perfect as- is! I get a lot of compliments every time I make this.

Been craving banana nut bread and everything I've bought is so dry or super dense.  I used 3 super ripe bananas, a cup of walnuts and half cup of sugar (1/4 brown and 1/4 white sugar).  I whisked the eggs a little and mashed the bananas.  Also, didnt have a bread loaf pan so I used mini cupcake pans and baked at 350 for 25 minutes until they were golden brown.  They came out amazing!! Just the right amount of sweetness and so moist yummmmm.  Never made banana nut bread before and I'm not a baker at all but these were so good... Better than any I've ever had before.  Husband devoured at least a dozen minis

Worked great.  I used really ripe bananas and mashed them a bit.  I also added some dark chocolate chips to the batter which was great.

Delicious.  I get asked for the recipe every time.  I think the recipe is perfect as is. My rating is on the initial recipe.  The second time I made it though I creamed the butter sugar vanilla all together first then added cut up bananas and mashed them then whipped them in. Then I added dry ingredients then sour cream and nuts. I liked the consistency better.

This was so good, the butter makes a huge difference. I added a tsp of cinnamon and used buttermilk instead of sour cream and added mini chocolate chips.  This is so good, I have been making what I thought was good banana bread for years and years.  Agree with others, cream the butter and mash the bananas for sure.

I just made this for the first time and omg!!!! It's so good. My kids loved it. The only thing I changed is I didn't add the walnuts, and I used an electric mixer to mix everything . it came out super moist and smells amazing. My kids are really picky eaters but the practically devoured this. :)

I baked this bread and my family loved it!! I didn't melt the butter all the way through but just until it was soft and fell apart easily. Instead of using sliced bananas, I just mushed the whole bananas with the rest of the ingredients with my hands. Just like my god mother taught me when I was little.

With the size of lot pans I had (cheap foil kind) I had enough to make 1.5 loaves,

I've never made banana bread before and this recipe was super easy and delicious! I did mash the bananas rather than slice them and I added 3 instead of 2. It turned out extremely moist, just how I like it. (: Im definitely sticking to this recipe for a while.

it was wonderful. I am getting rave reviews. I added about 1/3 cup of mini choc chip morsels and cooked about 10 minutes longer. I also used demerara raw sugar which added a slight molasses touch.

I changed this recipe up a bit...I substituted the sour cream for vanilla yogurt (2 individual cups) and I added half a bag of butterscotch chips. I also added cinnamon just before adding to the pan. Also, I buttered my loaf pan very well and dusted it with cinnamon before adding the batter.
This recipe looked awesome to me, but I always try to make things my own, so we will see how it goes :)
I also used 3 bananas and added some extra flour (maybe a 1/4 cup).

This recipe is great! I didn't have baking soda, I used baking powder instead. Turned out like brownies due to missing baking soda. I added ground cinnamon and ginger. Will for sure use this recipe again.

Great recipe. However I made a couple of healthier substitutions- used coconut nut oil instead butter, plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and unbleached white whole wheat flour. I have made it both ways and prefer the healthier subs.

I have made this recipe more times than I can count! Every time we have un-eaten bananas, I make this banana bread for my husband to take to work! It is always an awesome treat! SO MOIST! The sour cream trick is what sets this recipe apart from others! I leave out the nuts since you never know what allergies people have and it is always a crowd pleaser!

O-MMMMM-G!!!!! SOOOO good! Not to mention addictive! I made enough for two loaves. I baked the first loaf for the full 60 minutes. It looked a little over cooked. I expected it to be dry. Despite the slightly crunchy crust (which I loved!)the bread was super moist and delicious! I baked the second loaf for 50 minutes and it came out perfect. Definitely keeping this one. One note: I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them... slicing them just sounded strange.

I just took this out of the oven and it looks and smells delicous!  I doubled the recipe and used 2 bunt pans.  It baked in 50 minutes.
I greased and floured the pans and the loaves didn't stick.  Baked at 325'.  New oven...350 tested ar 380.  I baked 6 very ripe bananas like cakin and bakin suggested.  I toasted a half a cup of chopped pecans at the same time for 10 mins.  I chopped the bananas after they cooled...added lemin juice as was suggested in a prev review.  Also added cinn...nutmeg...1/2 teasp. Banana flavoring and a half cup of shaved chocolate.  ( didnt have choc chips).   It has cooled a bit...it tastes awesome!  I used all the other ingred. In the recipe.  My new fav! ??

I've been using this recipe for several years and think everyone mashing their bananas is really missing the boat. The hot sweet pockets of molten banana when it's fresh out the oven are sensational but once it cools, the chunks of banana just make this banana bread out of this world sensational. I follow the recipe nearly exactly, except I rarely have nuts on hand due to cost, but do have overripe bananas to save from wasting often, so I generally do not use them. I think it would be better with them however. Otherwise, I am slightly more uptight about measurement so I measure 1 and a half cups banana chunks per loaf. This gives me a loaf that is incredibly decadent.  #BANANACHUNKSRULE

Absolutely delicious.  I did what others suggested, added a bit of cinnamon, and mashed the bananas.  I also sprinkled a few chopped walnuts on top before baking.  Moist, banana-y, delicious.

Absolutely delicious and very moist! I didn't have sour cream on hand so I substituted 3 ounces of vanilla yogurt and an extra banana. Instead of the loaf, I made about a dozen muffins out of this recipe and they turned out great!

This is best banana bread ever! It's moist and delicious. There is need to look any further. I didn't change the recipe at all. However, my family likes chocolate chips so I added 1/2 cup. You will not be disappointed!

Delicious! I only had pecans on hand, and I added another banana just because I needed to get rid of it (my toddler doesn't like all the spots on the bananas). I made it yesterday and there is only a good piece and a half left after my husband, son, and I devoured it for breakfast XD

This is my second time making this delicious banana bread. I stuck exactly to the recipe aside from substituting plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I slice the bananas as the recipe says, they seem to almost melt into the bread and I don't ever have taste or texture issues when slicing vs mashing.

Good recipe, surprisingly easy, very moist. I don't have a loaf pan so I used my stone bundt pan and it did very well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the fact that this was not the best I have ever had, But then again no one makes it like Mom. However being that this is my first ever banana nut bread I am very pleased.

I've made this twice now, and both times it just came out "too" moist. I made it exactly as written, but maybe it was too much banana? Still a great recipe, just not for me.

The best banana bread I've ever had, bar none!  I made 2 substitutions:  1/3 cup molasses and 2/3 cup brown sugar to replace the 1 cup white sugar (for more flavour), and 1/2 cup yogurt to replace 1/2 cup sour cream (because I didn't have any in the house).  I'm going to try this with pumpkin.

Perfect everytime!!! Only changes I made are that I mash my bananas to get a smooth consistency. Also I add an extra banana and nutmeg. I have made it without the changes before and it was still amazing. I just like extra banana flavor and nutmeg.

This is my favorite banana bread. I do cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup as I think the bananas make it sweet enough, but that's just personal preference. Next time I will cut the salt in half too since there's plenty in the butter. Good stuff!!

This is an excellent recipe. I've been making this exact recipe for over a year now, but the last two times added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, only because i love that added flavor and it is delicious. Thank you. Definitely 5 stars!!

Really Really Good Banana Bread Receipe  In fact I have yet to use sour cream as I have not had any for the times I made the bread. I have used mascarpone cheese one time and yogurt another to replace sour cream.

I trippled the recipe and added two extra bananas for extra moistness. I also lined the pans with parchment paper rather than greasing them.  Wanted to save the extra fat for the soft butter I ate the finished product with.   ;-)   Super yummy!!

I baked mine for an extra ten minutes because the middle resembled bread pudding.  I like this recipe and so do my children.  I used 3 small bananas that had been sitting around for nearly two weeks, so needless to say the flavor was awesome.  Thanks.

This is a wonderful, MOIST, and yummy banana bread recipe...one that is almost impossible to mess up on.  Because the top always seemed to brown before it is completely done, I usually will put foil around the top after 15 minutes to help it cook all the way through without burning.

Kids love this recipe also!

This is the BEST banana bread ever! My girls even fight over the last piece...which is why we've made it 4 times in the past 4 weeks! I do add chocolate chips to the recipe but otherwise make it as stated. The first time I didn't have sour cream but did have a Yoplait banana cream so I figured it would be fine & it was just as good as every other time I have made it!! :)

Best.  Banana.  Bread.  Ever!!!!!  Only thing I changed was lowered oven temp a bit and baked it a little longer...so it wouldn't burn.  But that might just be because my oven runs fairly hot and I have to do that with pretty much every recipe.  Thank you SO much for sharing this superb recipe!!

I've made this twice in one week and it's a no fail recipe. It's also very flexible. I use self rising flour (don't add baking powder or salt), half a cup of sugar with 12 sweet n low packets, 3 mashed bananas and chopped white chocolate chunks on top. It's VERY moist and delicious! Everyone's oven temps are different so check your bread at 50 minutes because my edges burn at 60 minutes.

My daughter came across this recipe and made it one day-it is by far the best banana bread we have ever had!  The only thing I do differently is mash the bananas and omit nuts because we don't like them.  It's fantastic!

This is so wonderful! Nothing like a great banana bread at the beginning of fall to get you in the mood for the upcoming chilly weather. The only thing I did different was mashed the bananas (a cup worth), Added a tsp of lemon juice, and a tsp of baking powder as naples34102 suggested. It was moist yummy perfection! Thanks so much =)

Loved this recipe! I only added a dash of cinnamon because I'm pregnant and was craving cinnamon. I've made it previously as-is, and it's wonderful.

vjonsson is right! The moistest banana bread ever. Moist, sweet, delicious & golden crispy edges. Sooo good. My 10 yr. old son would've eaten the whole loaf if I hadn't stopped him.
My only changes: used my homemade plain yogurt in place of sour cream, (healthier & all I had on hand) used 1 tsp. baking powder in addition to b. soda, mashed the bananas rather than sliced. (per suggestion of other reviewers)
I didn't have any walnuts so made it without. I've made a lot of banana bread over the yrs. & this was the best. It's lighter, not quite as heavy as a lot of loafs. (maybe the b. powder helped w/that) It will be my go-to recipe from now on. YUM (:

I just made this for the first time & it is delicious!!  Added about 3/4 tsp cinnamon, dash of nutmeg, and dash of pumpkin pie spice.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly as written.  Will definitely be making again.  Would make great gifts, in fact I'm taking some to my boyfriend's parents tonight.

UPDATE:  I’ve made this this quite a few times since with the spices above and it’s always been delicious. The last few times I’ve made it at altitude (Denver, 5280 ft elevation), the only change I needed to make with shortening the baking time to about 50 minutes.  Last night I tried substituting the bananas with 3/4 of a cup canned pumpkin, continued to use the spaces above, but I didn’t have any nuts this time. It still turned out fantastic! This is such a great recipe!

I added an extra banana and a streusel topping (4tbl butter, 2/3 cup dark brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 1 tsp cinnamon). Awesome and very moist!

Absolutely delicious! Perfectly moist. Definitely benefits from the addition of chocolate chips, but is fine without. The bread seems to be surviving well in my freezer and fridge to make it last longer.

I love this recipe! I only made a couple of adjustments. I creamed the butter and sugar together rather than using melted butter. I also puréed the bananas instead of slicing (1cup). I also used half sour cream and half cream cheese, but only bc I didn't have enough sour cream. I left out the walnuts bc my hubby doesn't like them (booooo), but it still turned out amazing and will do it this way again! I doubled the recipe and made 4 mini loaves and 20 mini muffins. The mini muffins cooked for 20 mins and the loaves for 50 mins.

I changed this up a bit.  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup white sugar, and added a heaping teaspoon of both nutmeg and cinnamon.  My bread only took 50 minutes at 350.  The kids loved it.

This is now my go-to banana bread recipe.  I have made it with bananas (I prefer them mushed) and also with persimmon puree.  With or without walnuts, this is a great recipe although I prefer with walnuts.  Once I was out of butter and substituted sunflower oil (because that's what I had on hand) and it turned out exactly the same.  I used yogurt in place of sour cream too.

Tried this recipe and thought it came out pretty darn good, though I have to admit that I've never baked banana bread before. I also didn't stick to the recipe exactly. I didn't have sour cream, so substituted Greek yogurt (all I had was strawberry), changed out 1/2 the amount of white sugar with brown sugar and added a pinch of cinnamon. Smelled awesome while baking and came out moist and yummy! I used a 10 x 10" glass dish and it was done in ~45 min. As some of the other reviews have indicated, next time I'd probably opt to mash at least some of the bananas and perhaps cube up the rest (vs. slice).

Best banana bread I ever tried! I follow the recipe step by step for the most part , but like some other reviewers mentioned, I smashed the bananas instead of cutting them, cream the butter at room temperature with the sugar and use low fat, plain yogurt instead of sour cream. The bread turned out yummy and with a wonderful moist consistency.

This bread is absolutely amazing!!  I did smash my bananas instead of slice them and I used 3 large bananas instead of 2. The texture,  flavor and look of the bread was perfect.  It wasn't too sweet or not sweet enough,  it was just right.  I never have to buy store brand banana nut bread  again.  Thanks for the recipe! !!!

Delish. Was a little concerned that it only takes 2 bananas, but it was still moist enough. I also substituted vanilla Greek yogurt for the sour cream. Worked great!

It came out very well!! This is a simple recipe and the great thing about it the only thing I didn't have on hand were the walnuts.  It didn't require a bunch of ingredients that you wouldn't  find in the kitchen at any given time, I love recipes that require very few trips to the market.

I have been following this recipe for over 3 years. My family asks for this bread at least once per month. The only way my son will eat bananas. The only thing I do different is I mash the bananas with a fork and sometimes add chocolate chips.

The overall taste, texture and moistness of this bread is very good, but I do agree with other reviewers suggestion to mash rather than slice the bananas. I did not like the purple color the slices turned in the baked bread.

I loved it, thought it was the perfect banana bread. Wish I'd thrown some chocolate chips in a loaf (I doubled it since I had 4 brown banana's) Amazing flavor and texture.

I have been making banana bread for year and really loved this one. I picked this particular recipe because I had sour cream that needed to be used and  I'm glad that I did. I followed the tips from the first review. This will be my go to recipe in the future. Thanks vjonsson !!!

This is an excellent recipe for banana bread. It turns out moist and sweet, as good as loaves in any bakery or diner. The first two times I made the recipe as a loaf, and the last time I made it into muffins. The changes I made were using two less tablespoons of butter; for flour, used one cup whole wheat and half cup white; for sugar, used half cup brown and half cup white; and for sour cream, I chose low fat. With these substitutions to make the mix a bit healthier, none of the sweetness was lost. As a loaf, it's dense and delicious, and as muffins, they are lighter to bite into, and equally as delicious. This is a household favorite!

I have tried this recipe several times and it always gets rave reviews!  Always come out moist never dry.  When I don't have sour cream on hand, I use plain yogurt and it's just as yummy.  Also, add mini-chocolate chips just on top with some cinnamon before placing in the oven.

I am not a banana bread fan at all, but we had some over ripe bananas to put to use. First time I made these, I followed the recipe and was pretty pleased, considering how much I don't like banana bread. The second time, I tweaked it and I just may be a banana bread girl, after all. This round, I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 cup of chocolate chips. Also, I swapped half of the white sugar for brown sugar. I used a muffin pan and baked for 22-25 minutes.

This is my favorite banana bread recipe to make.  It is so easy, and is nearly perfect everytime.  I would say perfect except when following the recipe as is, the extreme moist bread tends to fall apart in your hands, making it a very delicious but messy treat.  I have modified it to use wheat flour, and find that just that simple adjustment has created the perfect banana bread.  Other modifications that I have made (depending on my mood), I have made it without nuts, with chocolate chips, and also mini loaves.  Everytime it comes out great!  Love it!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this bread for the 2nd time today.  My now favorite banana bread recipe. I used mini chocolate chips this time instead of nuts and vanilla Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  The first time I made it as written.  It makes 4 mini loaves.

I made this following the recipe exactly as written the first time, just so I would know how it's supposed to turn out. It was so good! After reading the reviews, I also made it a few other ways with different things changed. They were all good! This recipe apparently can't be messed up. I did eventually decide I should health it up a little if I want to eat banana bread everyday, so I made a completely overhauled version using this as a base recipe. Even that version turned out good even though there's no sugar in it and I used ground oatmeal as flour. But nothing quite beats the original on a splurge day :)

The best!! Everyone loved this banana bread. I didn't have walnuts so I left those out and it was fine. I had 3 over-ripe bananas, so I used all of them- mashed.  I also didn't use sour cream, I used plain Greek yogurt. I will never use another banana bread recipe in my life!

Perfect! Didn't have baking soda, so added double the amount with baking powder and left out the salt (for rising purposes). Also added an extra half of a banana. In a 9 inch round pan I leave it in about 50 minutes or so, have to cover with foil so the top doesn't burn-- darn stove.

Hands down this is the best banana bread reciepe ever. The last time I made the bread I ran out of vanilla so I used maple syrup only 1 teaspoon also ran out of all-purpose flour then used 1cup of whole grain white flour mixed with the all-purpose, It was awesome even with all of the modifications.

Great banana bread recipe...  I did find a cool substitution if you find out (too late) that you're out of eggs.  I substituted 150 grams of a good Greek yogurt (Oikos, vanilla) for the two eggs and made the recipe like normal.  Brilliant!!!  I'm almost tempted to try different, complementary, flavors.  I also use VERY ripe (essentially black and starting to smell fermented) and cream them together with the sugar before adding the rest of the ingredients.

I just made my first batch of banana bread.  This recipe was easy to fix.  I didn't have sour cream, so I substituted 1 c. milk and 1 TBSP of vinegar (wait for five minutes to thicken). It was moist, great flavor.

This is a great recipe!   It is my first time making banana bread and the whole household loved it!   I didn't have sour cream on hand so used Yo Baby strawberry yogurt instead as another reviewer suggested.   I also added a half cup of chocolate chips!  ???  Very moist and yummy!

First I want to say I did mash my bananas and added chocolate chips.
Now with that said this is a very good banana bread. It does not have as much banana flavor as the box but so moist. I think next time I will allow the bananas to be just about to turn so they will be extra flavorful.

This recipe always turns out great and has been my go to recipe since the first time I made it more than two years ago.  I absolutely love this banana bread and usually spice it up by adding 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.

I took the advise of  Naples341302 and used a stand mixer and utilize room temp butter, creamed mixture with the added t. lemon.  I also added 1/4 t. cinnamon and 1/8 nutmeg to dry ingredients and increased the salt to 1 t.  I too mashed the bananas and it was amazing!

This banana bread is really moist and delicious.  I followed the recipe as given except that I mashed the bananas and used pecans instead of walnuts. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  Made French toast using this bread and it was very good.  I would suggest cutting the pieces a little less thick than commercial bread and soak thoroughly in egg mixture with a little cinnamon.  Serve with fresh blueberries on top and a side of bacon.  Yummy!

Ok, I made just about every substitution imaginable, to have fun w/ it and to make it healthier (and gluten-free).  I replaced the butter w/ organic coconut oil (yum), rice-flour w/ some flax seeds for the regular flour, chopped almonds instead of walnuts, and half plain organic yogurt (I didn't have enough sour cream).  I always use super ripe (the blacker the better) bananas and mash them.  I used 3.  It turned out amazing and guilt-free!  Give it a try...

Delicious, moist banana bread.  I baked it in 3 (6 x 3 1/2) mini pans rather than 1 big pan.  They were done in 35 minutes.

Great banana bread! I've made this several times and it never disappoints. I usually leave out the nuts as my daughter isn't a fan, but keep it as-is otherwise. I sometimes add in almond extract to get the nutty flavor if I remember. It always goes fast in my home.

I love this banana bread recipe! It's my go-to recipe when I want to whip up a quick loaf. I have used Greek yogurt or cottage cheese if I don't have sour cream on hand and it's still great!

"Gluten Free" twist I used! Came out great. Substitute flour for 1 3/4 cups of a Trader Joe's All Purpose Gluten Free Flour. I usually try dairy free as well, this time I kept the butter and only switched sour creme for a dairy free version sour creme (Tofutti). Added 1 tsp Lemon Juice and 3/4 tsp of Baking Powder.

I've tried many different recipes but this one by far is the best.  I tweak it slightly by completely blending the bananas and I made individual mini loaves too.  The bread comes out so moist and delicious every time. I want to try it as a muffin recipe hopefully it will turn out nicely.

Delicious recipe with very slight mods. I added 1 tsp of baking soda as another reviewer mentioned. Mashed the bananas and added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and a cinnamon crumb topping. Scrumptious! This one goes into the recipe box!

I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream, because it's a lot healthier, adding protein, and its awesome :) I also crushed the walnuts on top instead of mixing them in, more for aesthetic reasons than taste reasons, and I pushed some frozen strawberries into the top to add some tart sweetness to cut through the bread. I love classic banana bread, and I decided to experiment :) turned out really good!

Excellent! I would probably call this a banana cake, because it does require a lot of sugar, and this tastes really sweet. But still, my family ate the whole thing in one day, so this is definitely going in my recipe box! We replaced the all purpose flour with 1 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour, which made it still a wonderful recipe! Thank you for posting this!

I adapted it slightly - I had 3 large bananas which I mashed, and I probably used a little more sour cream because I didn't really measure.  And, I didn't have any walnuts so I had to skip that ingredient.  But it was delicious.

After reading the reviews, I decided to mash the bananas and add them to the liquid ingredients.  I also stirred in some leftover blueberries to use them up.  I couldn't find my bread pans so I used a muffin pan and baked for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  They were wonderful!  Moist and rich with a delicious flavor.  I'd make them a lot more often if my diet allowed it.

This is hands down the best banana bread recipe! Other than omitting the walnuts due to a nut sensitivity, I make it as is. I will never use any other recipe. It’s truly the best tasting, moistest banana bread.

If I could give it higher than five stars I would. I replaced a 30 year family secret recipe with this recipe. What I love most is it's moist with a wonderful banana flavor but it's not dense. This is the holy grail of banana bread recipes and will be used against all new recipes. The only substitutions I made were those recommended by Naples (I have found her advice spot on in other reviews.)  I added 1 tsp. of baking powder, and increased the flour to 1-3/4 cups. I also mashed the bananas I did not slice them. Thank you for an outstanding recipe.

Made this many many times.  Family and friends love it.  Creamed  room temperature butter, sugar and eggs in a mixer instead.  Did not melt butter.  Mashed bananas instead.  Added a handful of chocolate chips with walnuts at the end.   Very moist!

I've tried several banana bread recipes over the years. I came upon this recipe a few days ago and decided to try it.  It was excellent.  The bread was moist, soft and tasty.  Got rave reviews from my family members.  This recipe will be going into my Recipe Box to be the go to recipe whenever I find myself with extra bananas.  Thank you.

This is hands down, the BEST banana bread recipe I've ever had. Beautifully soft and moist and delicious. I omit the nuts so the kids can take it to school, and substituted the sour cream for greek yoghurt. I also found out that you can put this same mix into muffin pans and have little 'banana bread muffins' for snacks on the run. This also freezes beautifully. Thank you!

This is by far the best homemade bread ever! And so easy to make it's impossible not to add it to your recipe box as a must-have. I've added 1 teaspoon ground cinammon to enhance the flavor and it's simply gorgeous. Another tip is to use cashew nuts instead of walnuts. You won't want any other bread on your table!

I followed the recommendations of mashing the bananas instead of slicing. It turned out fantastic. Best banana bread I've made in years. Very happy. My family isn't a huge nut fan, so I left those out, but it was amazing.

This is AWESOME!!  Only changes I made was to use plain yogurt instead of sour cream (it's not easy to find in Spain) and I add 2 mashed bananas as well as the 2 sliced ones.

Turned out great. I softened the butter (not melted) and mashed the bananas (not sliced) per some other reviewers suggestions, but otherwise made the recipe exactly as written. Very moist and yummy.

I made this for the last big family picnic and made a double batch. The first batch I made exactly as the recipe called for, the only difference being that I mashed the bananas before using them as other reviewers had suggested, and also added a tablespoon of lemon extract for more flavor. The second one I sort of came up with on my own for additives. I wanted something more heavy and spicy so I had some leftover blueberries and I added 1 cup of them to the mix. I also added 1tsp of nutmeg, 1/2 tsp of allspice, and 1 tablespoon cinnamon. The crowd loved it, and both were eaten quickly! It was split down the middle as to which one was best. I was very pleased. Just wish I would have gotten to eat a little more for myself!

This is a hit every time, consistently moist and delicious with the perfect amount of sweetness.  My only change is to smash the bananas, instead of slicing, as other reviewers have recommended.

really liked this, though ended up adapting the recipe to suite what I had on hand. I use alot of " plain" recipes as a starting off place. The proportions here were right on. My changes were... I added Two Tbls lemon juice. 1/4 c. yellow cornmeal. and 1 cup blueberries. Another change I made was i smashed my bananas with a fork.  After my additions i gave it another star!!

Delicious. I did some of the same tweaks that others did: 1 3/4 cups of flour, 1 tsp. each of baking powder and baking soda, and I added one cup of mashed very ripe bananas- which actually came out to be 3 medium sized bananas. So moist and full of banana flavor!

This bread was amazing and  very easy to make. For high altitudes, I recommend using high altitude flour since it will get hard otherwise, as such with other baking recipes.

i accidentally put 1/2c cream cheese in mix instead of 1/2c sour cream. Turned out to be an awesome mistake and will keep it that way. This recipe is very easy. After spraying pan i dusted the pan with a sugar and cinnamon mix(1/4c sugar & 1tsp sugar). Turned out great.

No need to look any further this recipe by far is the BEST banana bread I have ever made and I have made many many different banana bread recipes.  I added three banana since that's what I had to use up and two dashes of love...my 4yr old niece contribution to the recipe. Awesome!

I’ve made so many banana bread recipes I am an expert in my mind. I gave this 5 stars for its base recipe texture perfection. The recipe is good as is EXCEPT mash the bananas. Because made this with 1/2 c FAGE brand Greek yogurt (I sub that brand only for all sour cream needs). Used 3 bananas which was 1 cup. Added 1 tsp baking powder AND 1 tsp soda. Added some cream of tartar. Next time will add lemon juice.

I doubled this recipe but only used 1/2 cup of butter by mistake and it still turned out delicious.  I also added cinnamon.  Loved it!!  Next time I will probable cut the banana's a little smaller.  The taste was great but a little unsightly.

This is probably the best banana bread recipe I've tried so far! I did add 3 bananas instead of 2, which I think it why my bread wasn't quite done at the 60 minute mark. So I just turned off my oven and let it sit for about an hour or so. Afterwards, it turned out beautifully! Thanks for the recipe!

This was great! I did tweak it a bit, but the texture on this is what's so good about it, and I'm sure it is that way without my tweaks.  I used whole wheat flour (1 3/4 cups) so I used 3 bananas to compensate for this.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, and used plain yogurt instead of sour cream because it's what I had on hand. I also used half brown sugar, half regular sugar (it just sounded like a good idea!).  I took the advice of others and put in 1 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder.  I put in chocolate chips in place of nuts because I can't make banana bread without chocolate chips :)  Baked for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

First time I made this I used glass loaf pans and the outside was a bit dark and the inside mushy. Second time I used metal and it turned out great. I had to increase the cook time to 65 minutes and they came out perfect. I was a bit short on the sour cream but it didn't seem to matter.

I would definitely mush the banana's. Just seemed to be missing something. I added chocolate chips, but the banana slices kept the bread a little mushy. I do not think that I would use a mixer I like the dense bread more.

I mashed the bananas instead of slicing. Cook time was closer to 1hr 10min. DELICIOUS! I removed all other banana bread recipes from my recipe box :)

This is a perfect recipe! Just mash those bananas, and all will be well. When my loaves are not eaten within a few days (which is seldom), they still are delicious! Enjoy !!

Pretty good recipe. It was a lot lighter than my usual dense banana bread recipe. Save mashing my bananas and splitting the sugar half white, half light brown, I didn't make too many changes. I initially tried to "cream" the butter and sugar like others suggested, but it wasn't coming together very well, so I had to semi-melt my butter and sugar post hoc--opened the oven door and sat the bowl on the door to gradually warm the butter/sugar. It was still creamy but with a little melt. It did get nice and fluffy after that. This did take a at least an hour in my oven (loaf pan), but the bananas seemed undercooked, if that's possible. Maybe that's due to my oven and bananas. But all in all, this was pretty good.

It was nice and moist. I also mashed the bananas instead of slicing.
Instead of walnuts, I added 2 spoonfuls of peanut butter.
Instead of the butter, I added about 1/3 cup of vegetable oil (given that the peanut butter is oily already)
I reduced sugar to about 1/2 cup. 
I baked it for about 50 min and then turned the oven off and let it sit for another 10 min inside the oven (I was afraid of drying it out).
It came out well!

I've made this bread several times now.  Its a good recipe by itself.  The bread was very moist but nothing spectacular.   After making it exactly by the recipe, I decided to try variations and I have found mashing 3 bananas  gives it a much fuller banana flavor.  I have substituted plain and banana flavored yogurt for the sour cream.  Both worked nicely.  My favorite bread is when I mashed 3 bananas, used banana flavored yogurt and added cinnamon.  Very tasty.

Mash your bananas. This recipe works well with frozen bananas. I used a hand-mixer to combine everything.

I use French vanilla yogurt in sub of the sour cream and add a pinch of cinnamon and cloves or nutmeg, whatever the mood takes me. It's always a hit!! I found 50- 55min is a perfect time for me, I'd start lower and check it.. anything more is too dry in my opinion.

I didn't have sour cream or yogurt, but I did have some light cream cheese. I mixed it with a little milk to get the sour cream consistency.  I added maple syrup and cut down on the sugar.  I also cut the butter in 1/2 and added apple sauce.  I wasn't sure if it would work or not, but it did!  It turned out GREAT!  Saving this recipe so that I can make it with the correct ingredients next time.

This is my favorite banana bread recipe.  Throw some chocolate chips in and it is even better! :)  I use bananas that were too brown to eat for my family so they got thrown in the freezer until I had enough to make this bread.  Microwave them to thaw and throw in the batter whole, the mixer will mash them up.

Doubled the recipe with 5 mashed bananas and omitted the sour cream.  I only give the directions four stars though because it seemed like it only needed 45-50 minutes in the oven; 60 minutes would have made them burn.  I took both loaves to a party and they were a huge hit.

I had a large ripe banana that I need to use so I decide to try this recipe because it had sour cream and I knew that it would make it moist.  It turned out great I even brought slices into work. It was easy and very good.

I love this recipe; it comes out perfect everytime. I have made it many times as a loaf and I have put the mixture in a cupcake pan too. I baked the mixture in the cupcake pan for about 15 to 20 minutes. It is great for banana bread on the go. Thank you vjonsson.

Made this bread for out of town guest last week.  It was gone in less than 24 hours.  Have a loaf in the oven now and like some other reviewers, added spices.  The house smells delicious.  Thanks for sharing a delicious recipe.

Fantastic! I just made two loaves and ate almost half of one of them myself! So good; I obviously couldn't stop eating it! I already gave some to the neighbors and they loved it, too. I did add a tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg (per loaf) plus I used almost three frozen bananas each that I thawed first. Oh, and I used half brown sugar and half white. This banana bread will be my go to for a long, long time. Thank you for sharing!

This is a delicious banana bread, probably the moistest loaf I have ever made.  It didn't even last a day at our house...my husband and kids couldn't get enough.  The only change I would make for next time would be to mash the bananas, but it turned out fantastic as is!

I found this a bit fluffier than many banana bread recipes, and therefore a lot better- perfect! I use my KitchenAid for al the stirring and folding, and maybe that's why it is lighter. I made it the original way, and then tried with with half butter and half unsweetened coconut yogurt- even better! Slicing the bananas preserves more of the flavor. I often slice them, freeze them and then thaw tem briefly before tossing them in- still perfect. We love this bread  with 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips folded in.

It was pretty moist but too sweet. Use softened butter not melted and mash the bananas. Overall it was good but I've made much better.

Had an amazing sweet crust that was crystallized sugar.  Awesome!  I mash the bananas for my kids.  They didn't like the pieces of banana:). I thought it was fine, but for kids, texture can make or break the recipe:)

Loved this recipe. Though 40mins was enough to cook in my oven, and i took the advice and mashed the Bananas instead of slicing them.

I just made this banana nut bread and it's delicious. Sour cream is the reason this comes out so moist. I think you could add sour cream to any banana nut bread recipe and it would improve the flavor and be moist. The few tweaks I made to the recipe is that I used one stick of butter, not two, used pecans instead of walnuts and mashed two bananas before adding them to the mix. I meant to add a touch of cinnamon and clove like others suggested but forgot...didn't matter as the flavor is great without added spices. Poured mix into one 9x5 pan, baked as recommended; put foil over top at about half way into cooking time.  Perfection, truly.

Everyone tells me this is the BEST banana bread they have ever tasted. I didn’t really make any changes except I use 1 full cup of very ripe bananas (after making this recipe multiple times over the years I have noticed this really does make it exceptional rather than just good). I often substitute plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream just because I usually have the yogurt on hand.

Moist, easy to make, great flavor, and even better next day when wrapped up tightly to let flavors blend; it also toasts well.  Only things I did differently were to mash 2/3 of the bananas and cut the other 1/3 of total into pieces and I used a sugar/cinnamon coating in pans after greasing. I used one regular loaf pan and one small loaf pan so I could freeze one for later. The worse (riper) my bananas look, the better it tastes. This is a really great recipe for the amount of work! Thank you

I need this banana bread last night for our breakfast this morning. It turned out awesome. The bread is light and fluffy and moist and the walnuts give it a really nice crunch. However, I did take one of your reviewers advice and I mashed bananas instead of just slicing them. And I'm glad I did. It turned out GREAT. I will definitely be making this recipe again

Excellent recipe, i used creme Fraiche as a substitute for the sour cream because it was in my fridge and worked perfectly. I would suggest though that anyone using a fan oven reduce the cooking time to 50 mins i found it didn't need any longer or it would have dried out. 50 mins and mine was perfectly cooked and moist.

Amazing!!  I thought this bread was so moist & delicious.  I skipped the walnuts since my family doesn't like them.  It says to add sliced bananas but mine were so brown & mushy I just threw them in there.  Yummy!!!

This basic recipe is awesome! I used the suggested changes to increase the flour to 1 3/4 cups and one tsp each of baking soda and baking powder. Also mashed the bananas (mine took 2 large bananas). I subbed pecans for the walnuts - just a personal preference for my family. Just for anyone else trying to stretch it for 2 - I split the recipe into 2 smaller loaf pans (the grocery store disposable appx 8 1/2 x 3 inch) so that I could take one loaf to a friend. I cooked them at 325 for 55 minutes and they came out perfectly. Thanks for a wonderful new recipe for my binder!

My family and friends absolutely love this recipe. I only made some small changes.  Instead of sour cream I use Greek vanilla yogurt and I mash up the bananas.  This gives the bread a nice consistency and you won't get brown clumps of banana in the loaf.

Great, easy recipe! My family loved this banana bread! I used 3 mashed bananas (equaled 1cup). Took closer to 75-80 min to bake in my oven, and the batter spilled out of the pan during baking (perhaps because I used a disposable aluminum bread pan). Overall, great result, and I will definitely make again!!

Really good and easy to make! the only thing I did different was mash the bananas and added chocolate chips because I didn't have nuts. I didn't have a mixer or loaf pan so I mixed by hand and made muffins instead....they are already gone. Its a keeper!!!

I tried this recipe last night and it was delicious. This is the 4th banana bread recipe from this site I have tried and this one is the best. Thank you Janet! I had to leave the nuts out because I have braces, still the tastiest I have eaten yet.

Very yummy banana bread. I doubled the recipe but used 3 1/2 white/whole wheat flour, 2 cups of mashed banana, 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white (instead of the full 2 cups doubling would call for). IMO, it tastes so much better with less sugar; the flavor of the bread really comes through instead of mainly sugar. Did not add nuts. Also added 1 tsp. baking powder along with the soda. I saw where someone had creamed the butter and sugar, but I'm a lazy baker so I just followed the recipe melting the butter, and it turned out great. So moist and delicious!

My 15yr old daughter LOVES it. I do mash the bananas with a fork instead of leaving it chunked. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is an amazing banana bread.  I would suggest mashing the bananas, not slicing them.  This recipe will make you a rock star!

I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream and didn't use vanilla (just because I didn't have any) and it's the best banana bread I've made, the texture is amazing.

After trying several recipes...I finally found the one!  This is by far the best banana bread...moist inside, crunchy crust..the only thing I did different was remove the nuts (I love them, but the family does not) and I sprinkled some brown auger on the top...delicious!

I love this recipe. The only issue I had was the bottom of my bread was burnt. I am wondering if I could bake at 325 degrees instead of 350? Maybe my oven isn't calibrated right? Anyway, I have baked this bread twice and we love it. Even if we had to cut the bottom off. :)

This is the best banana bread that I have ever made.  I made the mistake of taking one to work one day and now this is a weekly request. My family also love this and it has become a weekly staple in my house.

Made two loves last night and added chocolate chips to one and peanut butter chips to the other. Even without the addition; this is the best banana bread I have ever made. I think the sour cream helps in the moist factor. I didn't have soft butter and couldn't wait, so I did melt it and it worked out just fine.

I have tried several banana bread recipes off here and this is definitely the best one...    I reduced the sugar by a quarter cup and added an extra banana, it was moist and fluffy. It's not a sense bread if that's what you're looking for. Delicious!!!

I made a "healthier" version substituting brown sugar for white, wheat flour for white and used only 2/3 cup of Smart Balance instead of butter.  Also added 2 TBS flax seed and sliced banannas on the thin side.  Delicious!!!

My boyfriend absolutely loves this recipe. I made two loaves, one to keep at home an one to take to work, but he refused to share and ended up keeping both. We cut one in half and froze them and it seems to freeze pretty well. The only thing I changed was to substitute pecans for the walnuts. We both thought this was better because the pecans are sweeter and have less of a bitter flavor. A great way to use up old bananas!

Changed this a little to make it sugar free for me. Substituted Splenda brown sugar just 3/4 cup, 1 tsp cinnamon, and used fat free Greek unflavored yogurt. Makes more than one loaf and used the rest in muffin tin.

FINALLY!!! A banana recipe that turned out moist and delicious! For some reason, I have always had the worst luck with banana baked goods. My loaves never get baked in the middle and the muffins sink in from time-to-time. I tried this recipe, loaf form, and it's absolutely delicious! I didn't have sour cream so I used yogurt (luckily it was Light Banana flavored) and I mashed up bananas instead of slices, since other reviews recommended that. I love it!

Made this for my grandson today. Reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and increased the bananas to the 4 average-sized ones on hand. Didn't have any sour cream so used Greek vanilla yogurt. Also mashed the bananas. :). Yummy! Had to leave the nuts out, as he is allergic. Plus, I remember when I was a kid, I never wanted nuts in anything. :). I'm a purist, so no chocolate chips either. That's just wrong! Ha!

This is the exact recipe I use except that it is softened butter creamed with the sugar and the sour cream is added alternately with flour and the bananas are pureed.  I also add raisins to mixture. AWESOME

I am always trying to use healthier ingredients in recipes and substituted as follows. I used Cloud 9 - gluten free flour - cup for cup. Also used dairy free sour cream and coconut sugar instead of white sugar. I added one tsp of baking powder. It turned out great! Very nice flavour. I did mash the bananas.Used leftover batter in a muffin tin - great!

I really like it, few changes, I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, added some golden raisins along with the walnuts and about and extra tablespoon of the sour cream.  Really good bread, it's a keeper and will share.

This was a very good recipe... I doubled it and ended up with two 4x8 loaves and three 3x6 loaves... I added chopped pecans because I didn't have walnuts and mashed the bananas; otherwise made per recipe.

This is the recipe I always look for when I want to make banana bread. I actually prefer to make it in a 9 X 9 cake pan (to be sure it doesn't fall), and I prefer to mash the bananas and add a few chocolate chips. It is a very nice moist bread/cake.

I defrost frozen bananas in the oven as it warms up and add that mush to the batter instead of chopped up banana. I use vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream and add a cup of chocolate chips.

This was my 1st time making banana bread & it was really good with a few minor variations. First, I used room temperature butter rather than melting it. Second, I mashed the bananas rather than slicing them which, like other reviewers said, makes a difference with the texture. Then, in addition to the walnuts I also added about 1/2 cup of semisweet chocolate chips. So yummy!

We have made this recipe twice now.  We also mashed the bananas as other reviewers have suggested.  What we did do different is use a gluten free flour blend. You would not have guessed that it was gluten free.

Substitute kefir for sour cream, and coconut oil for butter to have a lactose free version.  We baked ours with gluten free flour as well, which made the cook time slightly different but it was delicious all the same!

Let me add my 5 star rating!  Wow, easy peasy banana bread and it tastes fantastic.  Followed the recipe exactly and it came out of the oven smelling so good.  I used a silicon loaf pan which came out perfect.  Great with some butter.  I'll definitely make this again when I have 2 overly ripe bananas.

I have made this before per he recipe and it was wonderful. Today, I didn't have all of the ingredients and changed a few things and I am now in love! I tripled the recipe to make three loaves this morning. I ended up not having three cups of sugar, so I used 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. We also had no nuts, so those we not used. After creaming sugar and ROOM TEMP butter together, we beat in the bananas. And the final alteration was beating in the sour cream last instead of folding it in. I am used to dense, moist banana bread, but this one actually turned out fluffy and moist.

This is the best banana bread that I have ever made, and I have tried a lot of them!  Made recipe as written with two small changes: one is that I mashed the bananas and the second is that I added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Made this into muffins and baked at 350 for about 18 minutes.  I also make a glaze to add to the top off all my banana bread recipes - 1 part water and 1 part sugar mixed together and dribbled on top before baking.  (Which I guess would be a third adaptation.)  Delicious!

Very good!  I substituted the sour cream for yoghurt, only because I have none at home.  I didn't change a thing, just tripled the recipe.  Great bread!  Thank you for sharing Janet!

This was a great recipe!  I cut the recipe in half and cooked it for 40 minutes; it worked perfectly. My husband has high cholesterol so I used egg whites instead of eggs. I also blended the banana instead of cutting it. My family thoroughly enjoyed it.

Great recipe, easy to follow as I am a novice cook.  I mashed the bananas like everyone suggested, substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream (personal preference) and added some cinnamon.  Very pleased at how well it turned out.

Absolutely moist...BUT, the sliced bananas are unpleasant both aesthetically and texturally.  Next time I will mash them up, which will better distribute the banana flavor as well.  Oh, I skipped the nuts and added chocolate chips ;) UPDATE: I made this again!  FIVE STARS with the banana mashed before being folded into the batter.  I made 3 mini loaves with the intent to give some away but we ate it all, it was sooo good! This will be my go-to banana bread recipe now!

Delicious and moist. I plan on adding more banana next time, just because I like extra banana flavor and I had left out the vanilla extract because I simply didn't have it at the house, so I'm sure it was less flavorful for that reason alone. Still give it 5 stars!

Family favorite- with two minor changes.  I mash the bananas, not slice, and I use vanilla yogurt in place of the sour cream.

I used 1/4 cup of melted butter and 1/4 cup applesauce. Reduced sugar to 3/4 cup, used buttermilk in place of sour cream(didn't have any). Mashed the bananas and added 1 tsp of cinnamon. Came out very moist and delicious.

Yes, this really is the best banana bread recipe going. Like others, I agree that the bananas should be coarsely mashed - and all bananas are not created equal - so I go with 1 1/2 cups of mashed to get a good banana flavor. Never have sour cream around, so I add yogurt instead of the sour cream. Mix in frozen cranberries or blueberries for a little tang. I always seem to have more volume than will fit in a loaf pan, so I use a bundt to avoid spillovers. It's a never fail recipe!

I use this recipe and sell the bread at my coffee shop cafe, the customers love it and the bread flies off the shelf! I even have some customers come in to buy several pieces because their coworkers travel from the other direction and ask them to pick it up in the mornings. It makes the shop smell amazing when baking also! The only thing I have changed is the omission of walnuts, as so many people are allergic to nuts.

I've been making banana bread for years and this recipe tops every recipe I have ever used. I do however, mash the banana's slightly before adding as I prefer it that way. Fantastic!

This has been my go to recipe for a few years now and it never disappoints. I just made 6 loaves for teacher holiday gifts and can't wait to see how they go over! The only thing I do different is leave the nuts out.

I was making a different banana bread recipe for YEARS and just thought I'd try something different.  THIS is my new go-to for banana bread! So so sooo good. Followed it pretty close but I didn't melt the butter, just softened it and used the mixer for that and the sugar, otherwise mixed everything else by hand. I also mashed the bananas and this worked out fabulous. Everyone is raving its so moist! Yummy!!!!

This is a good recipe but I adjusted it to what I had available. I didn't have sour cream so I soured half cup milk with half tablespoon vinegar. I used quarter cup butter and quarter cup applesauce. I halved the sugar and added quarter cup dark chocolate chips. I used 1 cup flour and half cup ground walnuts and added a tablespoon of chia seeds. It turned out very moist and delicious!

This recipe is a keeper. This bread had a beautiful dark brown color on the outside. Even though it had great banana flavor and was very moist, it wasn't super dense or heavy. I will be adding this to my recipe collection. I used 1 cup mashed banana and added a little cinnamon to my batter, as well as adding a teaspoon of lemon juice with the vanilla, as someone else suggested. I had several compliments, including one very picky eater who usually won't eat banana bread with nuts but he loved this. Fantastic!

This is my all time favorite banana bread recipe.  I find that it is a bit under baked at an hour, as suggested.  I usually bake for an extra 15 minutes.

The best banana bread, really easy to make. One thing I also do is make a quick icing of brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon to spread on the top. Oh and I mash and mix the bananas, waaaay better that way

Only minor alteration that I made was to add 1 tsp of baking powder and to mash the bananas (as suggested by other reviewers)  and add a tsp of cinnamon powder. I ended up with a loaf that was just perfectly moist and had the perfect taste - just the right sweetness. I'm definitely gonna make this more !

This is a yummy base recipe, but I tend to amp it up with more bananas, about 1.5 tsp cinnamon, a dash each of ginger, allspice, and ground cloves, and brown sugar instead of white. It makes for a richer flavor with more depth, in my opinion. I also mash the bananas (usually with my bare hands, ewww, or a potato masher).

I liked this recipe, although I did make a few heart healthy changes.  I used white flour and whole wheat flour.  I used fat free sour cream mixed with some regular sour cream, lite butter instead of regular and I used white sugar and brown sugar.  I did add a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and added a few chocolate chips instead of walnuts, since I'm allergic to nuts.  It was light and tasty.

It is fantastic.  My granddaughter demands it all the time.  It freezes well.  I add some chocolate chips because it just adds a lit more flavour.  it received the greatest compilement- my daughter who raves about her friend being such a great cook, this woman's son told his mom my banana bread was 100% better than hers.  Make it all the time and everyone loves it!!!!!!

I didn't read the instruction to slice the bananas - I smashed mine like I do for all other banana recipes.  Absolutely moist and delicious results.  Reading others that didn't like how they looked sliced after baking, I'll continue to make this by smashing my bananas.  :)  Will make this again and again - rave reviews from the folks that I've made this for that loved it!

Yuuuumy! Followed recipe as written with slight changes.  Bread came out moist and delicious. I did substitute pecans for walnuts because that's what I had in my pantry. Also, I used 2 1/2 bananas.

This is the best banana bread I think I've ever had! Moist and dense ... perfect. The first few times I made it, I followed a reviewer's suggestion to cream softened butter with the sugar, but last night I made it as directed with melted butter. I left out the nuts since my family doesn't like them, and I did mash the bananas rather than slice them. I just now had a piece this afternoon, and it was delicious.

It was good. The only thing why I marked off a star was because the bread was a little to soft in the middle.

Great recipe! I just have two suggestions: 1)mash the bananas instead of slicing them 2) make sure you heavily oil or butter your pan to avoid the bread from sticking. Other than that I love this recipe! Thank you for sharing.

Absolutely perfect with optional tweaks: 1 cup flour and 3/4 cup wheat flour; nonfat yogurt in place of sour cream; 1/2cup white and 1/2cup brown sugars; 1 tsp each powder and soda; mashed bananas w/lemon juice; 1 tsp cinnamon. Healthy and delicious.

I made this last night, and even my picky kids devoured their slices. I did mash the bananas into the batter and threw in some coconut flakes. It added a tropical flair. Delish.

Great recipe! I like mine to taste more banana-like so I use 3 half brown, half yellow bananas. Sometimes takes a little longer to bake but results are great every time. I also use macadamia nuts in lieu of walnuts. Today, I added about 1/2 cup of coconut. Still pretty good.

I've been searching for the best banana bread to be my go-to recipe,  and this is definitely it. I've tried many recipes,  from this site and others,  and this is the only one that turned out perfectly.  Super moist, fantastic banana flavor.  I used one cup of banana puree as suggested by other reviewers and it ended up being just shy of three bananas.  This is by far the best banana bread I've ever had.

I've made this bread time and again without a hitch. It's always perfect. This time, I added cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger (a pinch? maybe 1/2 tsp of each?) and used vanilla greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and turned this recipe into muffins/cupcakes with cream cheese frosting. Going of script, but I was SO pleased with the results.

Absolutely delicious! This was my first time making banana bread. I did mash the bananas with a fork instead of slicing though. The bread came out perfectly moist, and this recipe makes a beautiful crust. Very easy to make. Husband approved! Will be adding this to the recipe book :-)

It was Christmas time and I had some eggnog, so I switched the sour cream out for eggnog.  It was GREAT!  3/4 of my family loved the sliced bananas in it, but my son didn't.  So I think I will slice them smaller next time, or maybe just make it the way I like it and he will have to suffer ;)

I was disappointed that the bread didn't rise at all.  I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. This recipe is nothing out of the ordinary.  It tastes fine. I pureed the bananas instead of leaving them in slices.

Just made this and it came out beautiful and super yummy! my husband who is not a fan of banana bread loved it and had seconds:) I used plain Greek yogurt in lieu of sour cream, cous it's what I had. No walnuts, but did sprinkle halved almonds on top more for decoration than anything. I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar. came out moist and perfect sweet wise. Oh and inspired by one of the reviews, i too creamed the butter and sugar with a wooden spoon, rather than a mixer. Will be making this often, thanks so much for such a good recipe!

I don't have anything bad to say about this recipe. I followed it to a T, but I did add wheat germ for extra nuttiness and health. My favorite recipe for banana bread! I will add though, that during the last 10-20 minutes of baking, I had to tent it with aluminum foil to keep from browning too much. It took a little over 60 minutes, maybe about 65-70 minutes.

Yummmm! I mashed my bananas prior to adding to the batter rather than adding as sliced and this turned out fantastic. My entire family enjoyed this.

This recipe is not bad as is but definitly not my favorite of the many I have tried on this site, it's a bit bland and do not slice the bananas. My favorite remains the "Best Ever Banana Bread" recipe by Rose on this website it uses buttermilk. I think the recipe would be good but with lots of changes using mashed bananas, half brown sugar, oil or applesauce instead of butter adding vanilla and lemon juice etc. to add some flavor it is certainly not rich as the name leads you to believe but it is an ok recipe just not my favorite

I have been looking for a moist banana bread recipe and this is it! The only substitution I made was out of necessity as I did not have granulated sugar I used brown sugar. The bread was moist and had very good flavor. I think I will continue using brown sugar. I also mashed the bananas instead of slicing them.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  It is very moist and my kids loved it. I did make slight changes though.  I mashed the bananas and, instead of nuts, I added chocolate chips.

AMAZING!  This recipe for banana bread is absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly as is but added 1/2 cup of sweetened coconut flakes with the walnuts.  The family couldn't get enough of it...i had a few people complain about how it ruined their diet :P.

I made this bread at Christmas time.  It was wonderful!  Everyone raved about how moist and delicious it was.  I mashed the bananas and used 3 bananas for extra flavor.  It was so good I am making 2 more loaves today!

Absolutely delicious.  I was looking at several recipes on this site and decided on this one because of the amount of bananas and sour cream.  I followed Naples suggestions and I was NOT disappointed!  This bread is divine!  In fact, the family loved it so much I'm baking a second loaf this afternoon!

The best ever.  I bring this to work, events, parties - you name it - and it is always a huge hit.  So moist!  My only changes are mashing the bananas vs. slicing (I find it makes it even more moist), and using chocolate chips instead of walnuts.

I have tried many recipe off this site for banana bread and I have been sorely disappointed with the results. When I noticed that this bread had sour cream in the ingredients, I knew it would be moist.  I am in love with the recipe and it is the only recipe for banana bread that I will use.

This was the very first time that I attempted to make banana bread from scratch.  We had several overripe bananas and wanted to put them to good use.  
My niece and myself used this recipe exactly, except for the walnuts... It was super moist and delicious.  We will definitely be using this again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Everyone in my family and visitors agreed this was the best banana bread.  I used a little more banana and a little less sour cream; half sugar half Splenda; lightly mashed the bananas and it came out great.  Some of the base got suck in my bread pan, not sure if I should have let it cool a little longer.

I make this often, it is fantastic. I mash up the bananas because my kids don't like chunks, but other than that I follow the recipe exactly and it is a superb banana bread.

This recipe is pretty good. I've made some minor changes to make it better. I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It adds a moistness, yet remains a pretty solid slice of banana bread.

I followed the adjustments given by naples34102 and the results were amazing! I made twice the recipe on 2 slightly-smaller loaf pans (8 inches), filled it 7/8 full and baked the bread for 55 minutes. I had leftover batter and made a dozen cupcakes at 325 degrees F for 25 minutes and they turned out great as well! The loaves and cupcakes were moist and light with just the right amount of sweetness. I will definitely make this again.

Made this with a few of the previously suggested variations and it came out incredibly. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white, added 1 tsp nutmeg and a 1 tsp cinnamon. I also did as naples34102 suggested and did 1 tsp of each baking soda and powder. I used a total of three bananas which was more equal to a cup and is the amount many other reviews said you should use (and I needed to get rid of some ripe bananas!). I unfortunately did not have any sour cream or yogurt, so I had to do without but it was still moist and delicious. I substituted the walnuts with crushed pumpkin spice almonds, which planters brings out around the holidays. Finally, I used a metal cupcake tin and baked for about 20 min at 325.

Love this recipe! Bread is soft, very moist! When I made it I greased my pan and sprinkled a cinnamon and sugar mix in the grease, I didn't have walnuts so chopped up plain almonds. Shared it with my girls and their families loved it also. Definitely a five star recipe!!

Incredible recipe!!  I had a bunch of frozen bananas to use and I took a chance that this recipe would work. *Note frozen bananas are very slimy to peel but the texture was perfect for mashing. Be sure to drain any defrost moisture first.*

I ran out of sour cream so I used Greek yogurt instead. Took advice from one of the reviews and added a bit of allspice and baked at 325 degrees for 1 hour and 10 min.  Bread came out moist but firm. Perfect for slicing and nowhere near heavy or brick-like. Took it to a party and the guests LOVED it! My new go-to!!!

I added teff, flax seeds, poppy seeds, chia seeds (handful of each), reduced butter to 1/4c, added 1/2c applesauce, replaced walnuts with chopped almonds. Substituted 1/2 of white flour with whole wheat, unbleached flour. Delicious...my kids eat it up!

I mash the bananas so I can reduce the sugar by half. I also substitute the sour cream with 2% Greek-style plain yogurt. The texture is fantastic and it comes out very moist. As I was making the loaf around the Christmas holidays, I spooned some cranberry sauce (homemade) down the centre when the loaf was baked halfway.  This is the only banana bread recipe I use and it is a hit EVERY time!

We love this recipe in my house!  My kids can't get enough of it.  I follow it pretty much to a T except we mush the bananas.  My 3 year old loves helping to make nana bread :)  I've made it three times now and haven't been disappointed yet.  It's easy and delicious, what more can you ask for?

Replaced the sour cream by ONE CUP of non fat greek yogurt and used three very ripe bananas. It was extra moist and delicious! I made caramel sauce to serve it with. Yummy! Thanks!

I did what the "most helpful review" said, and it worked great.  Definitely mash the bananas and have a cup full of them.  1 tsp powder and 1 tsp soda was good as well.  This is our go-to bananna bread recipe now.

I've been using a pretty good banana bread recipe since I was a teenager. It had been awhile since I had made it and I didn't feel like looking for the recipe. This one was very similar so I picked it. Yum! This one is so much better than my old recipe! The texture was wonderful! The butter doesn't need to be melted, just softened. I also added about 1/3 cup brown sugar. (My old recipe used 1 1/2 cups sugar). It wasn't too sweet, just right! Mash the bananas with a fork.

So Yummy!  Best banana bread recipe I have ever tried.  The only thing I changed was to add a teaspoon of cinnamon, and if I'm feeling naughty I sub the nuts for semisweet chocolate chips!  This loaf never lasts more than an hour after I pull it out of the oven!

Mashed my bananas and used greek yogurt in place of sour cream because that was what I had.  I also added some cinnamon.  Hands down the best banana bread I've ever made.  Definitely putting this in my recipe box!

My family really enjoyed this.  I made if for thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I did not slice the bananas however as I always have them frozen and just cut off the top and squeeze them out of the skin.  Just a personal preference, I like brown bananas for bread.  
**Just an update, I've been making this recipe for a year now and I've tweaked it a bit, I always add about a tsp of cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp of cloves and nutmeg.  I really love the added spices with this already fantastic recipe!

I made this bread this morning for Thanksgiving dinner. I followed the recipe exactly as written except for slicing the bananas. I mashed them instead and it turned out perfectly. My husband gave me multiple high fives and the kids absolutely loved it! The turkey is still in the oven and the bread is almost half gone. This is my new recipe for banana bread!

Yum!  I followed the tips in another review and also used a teaspoon of baking powder and one full cup of bananas.  I might even like more of a banana flavor but it really is moist and delicious.

Very moist banana bread, simple, and delicious. It reminds of a banana bread that would've been baked in the 50's, just a simple, delicious banana bread that isn't complicated with other flavors. I used 3 bananas because I wanted to use them up and added extra walnuts, other than that I went by the original recipe. No reason to change, add, or complicate this amazing banana bread recipe.

I like to try a recipe as the chef has prepared, then after I decide It is delightful, or at least worthy to taste, I leave it alone or add my spin on it. This is soooooo good and perfect texture. I prefer my bananas mashed so I chose that route. I made this yesterday , and my kiddos begged me to make it again today. For fun I added vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream. Thanks so much!

Great recipe, but as other reviewers mentioned, it's much better to mash the bananas. I also use rock salt and throw in a pinch extra, as I like the crunch in my bread.

I used Napes34102's modifications and substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream. Also, I didn't have any eggs for I made two "flax seed eggs" which meant before everything else, I mixed together 2 tablespoons ground flax seed and 6 tablespoons of water and left them until they became gelatinous, stirring every now and then. Then when it came time for the eggs I just poured that in. This recipe worked great, even with the vegan adjustment!

I needed to recycle some raisins and almonds left over from making homemade glug and I thought banana bread would be good so I picked this recipe. WONDERFUL. The only changes I made were adding dashes of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to incorporate the flavors of the glug infused raisins and almonds a bit throughout the dough, and I used 3 mashed bananas instead of 2 sliced. The result was a very rich, very moist bread that melted in the mouth and filled the house with a divine aroma as it baked. Best of all, as the bread took over an hour to get done, most of the alcohol content from the raisins and almonds got baked out, so the result wasn't the least bit boozy.

This is a wonderfully simple and delicious recipe for banana bread. I  used 3 small bananas, mashing them, not slicing.  I will make this again.

Perfect! I made this many times and have stuck to the recipe or varied a bit...I love that it is easy and versatile and very forgiving: sub any kind of sugar, use less sugar, use other nuts or no nuts at all, add craisins, swap any kind of flour...I use wholewheat flour and less sugar and nobody notices!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner desert and everyone loved it!  I read the reviews first, and followed some of the advice.  I used three bananas and mashed them, used half brown and half white sugar, and used softened butter instead of melted. Everyone loved it! It was so moist and delish!

I've made two loaves in the last week and substituted 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce for the butter both times. 
I've kept all other ingredients other same. Best banana bread!  Have received many compliments on this bread.  It is perfectly moist. I've substituted applesauce for oil before, but never for butter.

I've made this recipe twice now and both times have come out great.  The bread comes out very moist and has delicious banana flavor.  In both cases I added 1t cinnamon and 1/2t all spice. When I made this recipe yesterday I didn't have any sour cream so I used 1/4c mascarpone and 1t lemon juice (I also used 3 medium bananas).  I was a little worried about the substitution but it worked and was boyfriend approved ;)

Best Banana Bread recipe I've ever made. Soft and moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. I prefer to thinly slice the bananas instead of mashing them. I used whole wheat flour.

Next time I make this (which might be as soon as tomorrow:), I will try to use 1/2 cup apple sauce instead of butter (as some have mentioned). This way I can chow on it without the guilt :D

I made this and it was delicious! I can't stop eating it! I made a few changes based on the reviews of others 1) used ripe bananas and mashed them 2) added cinnamon  3) used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. Next time I'll try with oat flour and or ground almond!

Giving this 4 stars instead of 5 just because it had to be tweaked a bit. I used 3 bananas, mashed them, and only added 2/3 cup sugar instead of a whole cup. Delicious!

I must have done something wrong, as mine wasn't what I expected. Perhaps I should not have used a mixer on the butter and sugar, though I mixed the rest by hand. I added spices and choc. chips as per TranceAddict. I made muffins which are too light, though tasty. Perhaps one of these days I'll stick to an original recipe. (ha!)

This is some amazingly good banana bread.  I have made this exactly as written and also with some changes, and got equally good results.  Here are the changes I made:  I subbed an equal amount of coconut oil in place of the butter (firm, refrigerate if liquid).  I also subbed plain nonfat yogurt for the sour cream.  I prefer the bananas mashed.

I think this is a good base recipe that with a few modifications comes out great!  I change the amount of bananas to 3 large ripe bananas coarsely mashed.  Also brown sugar instead of white really adds a nice touch.  I add a little nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice to the batter and then sprinkle them on top before putting it in the oven.  Finally nuts are optional, it comes out just as good without them!  Over all so yummy!

I absolutely LOVE this banana bread recipe! I haven't made any changes at all, and it definitely my favorite of all the recipes I've tried - even my mom's (shh!). I leave out the nuts because my kids don't like them, though I think it's sacrilege to do so lol.

Delicious!  I gave it 4 stars because I made a few changes.  I did not melt the butter(instead just softened), did not add nuts, mashed banana until I got 1 cup, and added about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  With these changes, I would give 5 stars.

I decided to try out this recipe, as it was the nearest to the recipe my mom always used. It was quite good, although it wasn't as moist as I remember hers.
I divided the batter into two loaf pans instead of one, which made the batter look like not enough. However, the bread rose as it baked. 
I cooked the two pans for 45 minutes instead of 60.

I love this recipe - but I add 3 very ripe bananas (instead of 2), 1/4 cup applesauce (or apple butter - what ever you have) and I use half white sugar and half raw sugar (for that extra molasses flavoring). I also take it out of the oven a little early so it's extra moist.

This bread was as delicious and moist as all of the other reviewers have said.  The only thing I did differently was mash the bananas first.  I have been making my mom's banana bread recipe for years, but  the bread was always a bit too dense for my liking.  I will be following this recipe from now on!

I made 12 muffins out of this recipe; I only had to bake them for about twenty minutes! They are great in moisture and flavor. Like most people, I didn't have any sour cream on hand, so I used about 1/3 cup of mayonnaise instead. I also used 3 bananas instead of 2, just because I had them. Best banana bread I have ever made and eaten (better than Starbuck's and Byerley's, too!) Highly recommended.

This recipe was so delicious. I mashed the bananas and omitted the nuts because my family doesn't like them. I made these into mini muffins. I used a 1oz cookie scoop in a greased mini muffin pan and baked at 350 degrees for 11-12 min. The edges browned slightly and the top stayed light. They were soft, sweet, moist and wonderful.

This recipe was excellent! Very moist and the flavor was wonderful. I used the blender to whip the butter and sugar and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture. I also mashed bananas instead of slicing them and found the texture perfect.

Great recipe! They only changed that I made was adding three bananas that I needed to use up so I had to bake it a bit longer. The bread turned out wonderful and reminds me of a Betty Crocker version that I used to make. I recommend this to everyone because it's so easy to make.

I'm giving three stars because I too made quite a few changes to get it taste 'rich': I mashed the bananas, added half teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of ginger (adding ginger was an accident actually), I used yogurt instead of sour cream, used a little baking powder as well as baking soda, and added 5-10grams less butter than the amount it says in the recipe. It might differ from oven to oven, but 60 minutes of baking time was about 10 minutes too much for me -- make sure you keep an eye in the oven. Me, my friend, and my mother agree that the result was delicious. Next time I won't add ginger because I'm not a fan of spice, but if you like spicy, you can try a tiny bit ginger like I accidentally did.

Great recipe...bread comes out moist with a tender crumb, not heavy and dense like most banana breads.  I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and mashed the bananas, adding them to the butter/sugar/egg mixture before adding the flour.  I didn't have any sour cream so I used fat free Greek yogurt instead.  At the last minute I decided to add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter...glad I did!  I'm generally not a big banana bread fan but I'll be keeping this recipe on hand for those times when I have over ripe bananas to use.

i tried this today, and OMG it was amazing.  even when i tried the batter i fell in love with it.  i tripled this recipe.  and realized i didnt have enough butter and we dont have a grocery store.  so i did two cups of oil and 1/2 cup of butter.  i like my banana bread light and fluffy so i did mix my wet ingredients in my mixer.  and i mashed my bananas

I had a few bananas that were going bad so I thought - why not try and make a banana bread. I made several tweaks to this recipe to suit my tastes - I used 3 bananas instead of 2 because that's just what I had, I also added 1/4th cup of brown sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the recipe. I used enriched bread flour and I didn't have sour cream so I just omitted it and it turned out moist without it. I'm definitely going to try this recipe again but I'm going to play with the amount of sugar it calls for - perhaps do 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4th cup brown just to see. I think that this is a fantastic recipe because it serves as a great template for the bread. Thanks!

Well, I've had better.  This recipe does taste more like a cake than bread.  It definitely needs more bananas for flavor and density.   It's just good, not great.

To make more the 'healthy' side.. I made two the first I substituted sugar for one cup splenda and almond mean for the flour.  Turned out well but a 'little' mushy on the bottom.  Second I used the 1 cup of splenda and mixed 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup almond meal.  I may try the greek yogurt as a substitute as well on my next try.  Great recipe. Thank you.

Favorite Banana Bread! I mash my bananas (usually use 3 instead of 2). If I'm making the bread for kids, I add chocolate chips. Yum!

Best banana bread I have ever made.  I omitted the walnuts and used butter flavored crisco instead of butter.  Turned out perfect!  (I also did not melt the crisco, but just creamed that together with the sugar and eggs.)

The best I have ever tasted WOW  The only change I made is  I blended the bananas into soften butter and i used  3 bananas.  We polished off a loaf yesterday and have a replacement in the oven.

I make banana bread often.  This time I had some sour cream to use up so I tried this recipe (my usual doesn't call for S. Cream).  I'm so glad I tried it.  This is the best banana bread I've ever made! So moist and buttery.  I did use an extra banana because I had it so why not and I mashed my bananas.  I will use this recipe from now on.

I really did enjoy this recipe - but like others have suggested I did make a few changes and it worked out very well. I also creamed my butter with half a cup of white sugar and half a cup with brown sugar, added one teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of nutmeg. I did mash the bananas primarily because I don't think my kids would eat it if there were slices and lastly I used the batter and made little muffins instead, easier for little hands to hold. The muffins cooked for 17 min in a 350 oven and they came out perfectly golden brown. Definitely a keeper.

I made this today exactly according to directions and video and it deserves 5 stars!  For forty years, I've used my mom's recipe and tossed it;  this was moist, had the right banana flavor and I'm going to send this to my dear sisters who have used mom's recipe also.

Great recipe!! followed the recipe for the most part but I substituted greek vanilla yogurt for the sour cream to make it a bit healthier. Also added chocolate chips instead of walnuts. I mashed up four bananas rather than two; also used room temp butter and beat the butter and sugar with a mixer as someone suggested. Turned out super yummy and very moist !! My roommates loved it

This is the best banana nut bread I've made and I only made ONE change: Instead of the sour cream I used greek vanilla yogurt. I'd cut the sugar a bit next time due to the yogurt's sweetness. GREAT recipe! Thanks!

The very best banana nut bread I've ever tasted.  It was very moist, I added chocolate and peanut butter chips to it.  I also made a mixture of cinnamon, brown sugar and walnuts, instead of the walnuts in the bread, and sprinkled it on top.  I also used a fat free sour cream,   Just delicious

OMG!!!  So amazing and moist!!  I made 2 loaves, and before I could share with anyone, I had eaten half a loaf!!  I did do a little tweak, I used 3 bananas per batch, instead of 2. I love this recipe, and my coworkers were making crazy yummy food noises!!!  I have 6 more super ripe bananas, so I am making 3 more loaves!!

I've been wanting to try out this recipe for quite some time now. I will admit after reading all the reviews I was somewhat disappointed with it. I mean it was good but it wasn't over the top spectacular. I don't know maybe I was expecting too much. I'll have to make it again sometime. It was flavorful and moist but there was just something missing it seemed. I followed some of the other reviewers tips and mashed the bananas for a full cup. Also added a cup of pecans to the recipe and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.

The best banana bread I've ever had! I cut the recipe in half, smashed, the bananas, and left the nuts out. (I'm not a huge fan of nuts in my bread). Then only needed to bake for 45-50mins at the temp it says. My husband even loved it and he doesn't like banana bread!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Awesome! I originally used it because "Mom's called for shortening, and I didn't have any...so I searched for an alternate recipe. Glad I did! Made it yesterday and it's so good that I'm making more today!

Really good, super moist and over all a great taste. I only had one egg, so I substituted the other egg with a little water and conola oil, and I substituted the sour cream with canola oil and milk. It didnt slice very well, and broke easily but maybe thats my fault for not using all the right ingredients. I chose this recipe because it was the only one I found that only required two bananas, which is all I had. I think it would have been even better if you bump up the bananas to three or four. I think its better if the bananas were mashed because I found a few big chunks in the bread, not that it was a big deal.

This will be my new banana bread recipe. Only changes are to cream the butter and sugar and mash the bananas, as others recommended, otherwise a perfect recipe!

This is an amazing bread. I made two changes... I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and then 1/4 cup of honey. Also I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour instead of white. It's the best banana bread I ever tasted. Will do it again. Many, many times!! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I'VE MADE THIS RECIPE AND IT WAS AWESOME. FEW CHANGES LIKE 3 EGGS INSTEAD OF 2, ADDED A CUP MORE FLOUR THAN THE RECIPE CALLED FOR AND 1        NOT 1/2 CUP OF SOUR CREAM. I ALSO DOUBLED ON THE BANANAS.THESE ADDITIONS GAVE ME A LOAF PAN AND A SMALL ROUND PAN WHICH WAS ENOUGH TO SHARE WITH MY FAMILY.TO PEP IT UP I USED A 1/2 TEASPOON EACH OF GROUND CLOVES AND GROUND CINNAMON WAS VERY MOIST AND DELICIOUS. WILL MAKE AGAIN MY FAMILY LOVED IT.

I really, really loved this recipe! Unfortunately, I didn't have any sour cream, so I used applesauce instead and it worked out perfectly well. Easy, moist, delicious, and eaten up within seconds - 5 stars!

Wonderful. I used lady finger banana's from our trees and mashed them up a little over a cup and went light on the sugar like a little more than 3/4 cup. No nuts as the kids hate nuts! This is a great recipe and it can be easily tweeked for all sorts of different variations. Forgot to add I made this into muffins and spray the cupcake liners with canola spray at 30 mins and 350 degrees. I also had more than 12 so i just put the rest into my mini cupcake tin at 20 mins 350 (also sprayed them with canola oil first) and those are good to put in a lunch box side dish for easy eating.

So easy to make- even for a novice like me. Will never throw away those past-prime bananas again. Very delicious & moist & I already had all the ingredients in the house so was quick & inexpensive treat. Fool-proof & so yummy .

Loved the taste/texture.  2 loaves evaporated in the office within 2 hours.  On a side note, greek yogurt worked well as a substitution since I was out of sour cream.  Try using 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips or pecans instead of the 1/2 cup walnuts.  I might go crazy and add more nuts since it seemed less nutty or chocolaty than I would have preferred.  BTW at the office the one with Chocolate chips went fastest.  Also as other people have said the bread should have mashed instead of sliced banana...the riper the more flavor.  1 cup is perfect so if you like to mash the bananas and freeze them like I do just measure out 1 cup portions for when you are in the mood for some fresh banana bread.  It is delish right out of the oven.  I had 6 bananas that worked out to 2 1/2 cups so best to mash and measure if you want consistent results.

I've made this recipe several times now, and it is always delicious and sweet, without being "too sweet." I wasn't crazy about the mushy, purply banana pieces that you get a day or so after baking this bread--so, I started chopping the bananas into smaller pieces, and it's been wonderful every time. I usually bake for only 57-58 minutes, at just a notch under 350 degrees. (My oven runs a little hot)

I substituted Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free flour mix for the wheat flour and also used half coconut oil instead of all butter.  Plus I made muffins instead of a loaf, baked for 20 minutes.  Came out great.  Also used this recipe to make blueberry muffins, left out the walnuts and instead of banana added in heaping cup of blueberries plus some cinnamon.  Also excellent as muffins.

A good standard (moist) banana bread, but nothing spectacular.  Will be making again.  I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream to make it slightly healthier.

I have tried a LOT of banana bread recipes and everyone has agreed this is the best. I mashed the bananas and I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I think it's the sour cream that really makes it so good.  I made muffins from this recipe, and made a little crumbly topping of brown sugar, flour, cinnamon and butter.  Baked for 30 minutes and they came out perfectly!

This has to be the best banana bread I've ever tasted!  I used 2 larger over ripe bananas and I did not have sour cream so I used vanilla greek yogurt.  I did mash the bananas as well.  Covered the bread after 30 min. of baking so it wouldn't brown too much on the top.  It was done after 50 min. of baking.  My husband told me I out did myself with this recipe :)

Great recipe!  Very moist.  I tweaked it by substituting 1/2 the flour for whole wheat flour, and used 3/4 cup demarra sugar instead of white sugar.  It took a little longer to beat it well enough so the sugar was properly blended.   I didn't have sour cream and used nonfat, plain Greek yogurt.  I used three very soft bananas mashed and  also added some semisweet chocolate chips.  I will use this recipe again for certain.

I tried this recipe for the first time today and ended up making two batches. I followed the recipe exactly first batch (and it turned out great), but the second batch I made a few adjustments. I first excluded the walnuts (so my grandmother could eat it) and added only a quarter cup of sour cream. Instead, I added another half banana, and I felt it gave me the same moisture as the first loaf. It also added more banana-flavor to it and reduced the calories by a bit. Overall, a fantastic recipe that left both moist and rich taste with a strong banana foundation. I served it with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and my guests loved it.

Came out moist and flavorful . I made a few changes. Replaced half the sugar with brown sugar, mashed the bananas and added a tbs of milk to the batter because it was too thick. Baked for an additional 10 mins. This will be my to go recipe. Was absolutely perfect.

Best recipe I've found for banana bread and I've tried quite a few. Followed reviewers suggestions to mash the bananas, and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Some reviewers warned of using a mixer with this but I never have a problem. In fact, I use the mixer to work the butter and sugar into a creamy consistency. Someone said it adds too much air, but that's not my experience at all whenever I make breads of any kind. Three bananas instead of two and this was a hit. I'm making my fourth loaf today because I bought a lot of extra bananas and plan on giving a few loaves for family birthdays. This also freezes quite well!

I thought the recipe was good, however, the bread did not cook evenly and I had to add extra cooking time. Also my bananas turned pink....I thought that was strange. I might add less sugar next time as well. I will try this again to see if it was just the bananas. It was definitely moist and tasty.

I love the cut up bananas instead of mashing them - makes for a wonderful bread!

I tried this recipe and it is absolutely awesome. Didn't have sourcream(besides we're lactose intolerant) so I used soymilk with some vinegar added to it. I should have made two batches, then we'd have more.

Truly, a great recipe. I added a couple of handfuls of fresh blueberries and then should have used two pans, as it overflowed a bit. But, my bad, and the loaf disappeared almost immediately. Thanks!

Great! Made a couple small changes and loved it. Used all whole wheat flour, about 6 T of butter (will play around with applesauce next time as some people have mentioned), only 1/2 cup sugar, light sour cream and added in some dark chocolate chips. Mixed as directed and poured into the sprayed pan and then sprinkled a fair amount cinnamon and nutmeg on top to cover. Baked as directed, 350 for 60 minutes and it was perfectly done. I use a full size loaf pan from Pampered Chef and it cooked great.  Will use this recipe again!

Best banana bread I've ever had.  Made several times and will not make another way again.  I have altered this one to add mini chocolate chips, mini Reese cups, and Nutella swirl.  All were fantastic.  If you do use chocolate chips, I prefer the minis so they don't sink to the bottom of the loaf.  Also, if you use the Reese, I suggest chopping them and not using whole for the same reason. Like other reviewers, I also mashed the bananas.

This is the best banana bread. I added 2 extra bananas. After I put it in the oven I realized that I  had forgotten the vanilla. I was a little worried, but it was super yummy. I greased my pan with butter and it gave it a great butter flavor with every bite.

Finally! I have been searching for the perfect banana bread recipe and this is it.  The family devoured it in minutes!  I didn't have sour cream so I used buttermilk and it turned out moist and delicious. Also substituted the nuts for chocolate chips and I agree that the bananas are better mashed.  Can't wait for my bananas to get old so I can make another one:)

This recipe was tasty, but too moist.  The bread was great right out of the oven, but the next day it felt slimy and the kids had lost interest in it.

This is very good bread. I chose to mash the bananas instead of slicing them and didn't have sour cream and substituted Ricotta cheese and it was wonderful. Great Recipe! Dee

I cheated a little and didn't follow the recipe. I used Philly's cream cheese instead of sour cream which is hard to get in Korea. And added only 1.5 banana instead of 2 bananas. It turned out great but I should have added 2 bananas like the recipe says. But, it stilled turned out great. Thank you!

I loved this recipe and so did my kids, and husband. My spouse was amazed when I said that I made it - he was sure I had bought it. I made the recommended changes re: butter, bananas, cinnamon, and nutmeg - and added a pinch of ground cardamom, and loosely covered top with foil halfway through to prevent a burnt top. I think I added too many bananas - probably closer to 1 cup and 1/2, as the mixture overflowed while baking. I also seemed to have the temp too low (at 325) and ended up baking it for 1 hour and 45 mins! It was perfect! I'll try baking at 350 and putting on lower rack next time. Thank you vjonsson for sharing this recipe with us!

This is a great recipe. Very moist. I only changed up the sugar using 1/2 cup of splenda and 1/2 cup of sugar. I also baked it in an 8x8 pan and it only took 45 minutes. I will definitely be using this again.  Thanks for this keeper

This resulted in one of the best banana breads I've ever made. I used mashed banana and not sliced, added an extra half banana and split the vanilla extract with a 1/2 tsp of banana extract. Secret: wrapping your banana break in foil for a few hours will lock in the moisture! Perfection!!

This banana bread is the bomb-diggity.

I made a couple of adjustments:
* Used plain non-fat greek yogurt instead of sour cream (NO difference to taste or texture, just less calories and higher protein).
* Smashed the bananas and incorporated them until they were unified completely with the rest of the batter.
* Made muffins instead of loaf, cooked for around 25 minutes.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I did take the advice of Naples 34102 (one of the first, most helpful/positive reviews) and followed her modifications when I made this.  (Mashed the banana instead of sliced it, used the extra flour, added some lemon juice, and used baking soda and powder).  I doubled the recipe with no problem.  Thanks for a tasty Banana Bread!

This banana-nut bread was soooooo good that I made twice in one week. My husband loved it and so did my co-workers.  They could not stop raving about it.  Followed the recipe as directed, just added nutmeg and cinnamon.  Oh and I mashed the bananas. This is delicious-- yum,  yum!

Followed user comments and altered ingredients - used softened butter, 1c mashed bananas, and added 1 tsp baking powder. Didn't have walnuts but did add chocolate chips (around 1/2 cup, coated in flour). Lowered cooking temp to 325 and at exactly 75 minutes it was aromatic perfection. Nice and dense and moist. Looking forward to the next batch for sure.

To be fair, I like to try recipes the first time as written. I did that with this recipe, with the exception of mashing the bananas (as so many others recommended). The texture is perfect! However, I thought it was slightly lacking in flavor...good, but not great. I think next time I will increase the sugar by about a half cup and add a few choice sweet spices (I like cinnamon and nutmeg in mine). Also chocolate chips for chocolate lovers! :)

This is a really delicious recipe. I mashed the bananas, added blueberries, and substituted honey greek yogurt for the sour cream. I also made mini-loaves and they only needed to bake for about 50 minutes. Moist and easy to make. A hit!

Good but I have made better.   A bit too sweet for me.  More bananas and less sugar perhaps?

The flavor of this bread was great. The texture was a little different than I am used to. I did cut the butter in half and added 1/4 cup apple sauce. I also cut down on the sugar.

The trick is to use super ripe bananas and to make thin slices. That way you don't get the weird purple-ish chunks if the banana slices are too large/intact. I save some of the slices to sprinkle on top of the loaf for better distribution too.

I usually cream the butter and sugar instead of using melted butter--just because I'm used to it that way for other recipes. I have done it with melted butter and it made no dramatic difference. 

Otherwise I followed everything the same. I normally check the loaf after 40 minutes of baking to see how it's doing, but I've found that 60 minutes is good for my oven.

I love this bread! I did mash the bananas though. I also added flax seed and a couple tbls of almond butter instead of walnuts just for a change.  My kiddos loved it!

DELICIOUS! Totally agree with other reviewers. I had to double this recipe because I knew that based on the reviews, it would be wonderful.  However, I did not have sour cream so I substituted 1 cup evaporated milk with 1 tablespoon white vinegar (for 2 loaves).  I also took another reviewer's suggestion to add another 1/4 cup of flour (1/2 cup for two loaves) but I only added a total of 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder to make my two loaves. I used 4 nice sized bananas, but could have easily added another one.  Overall, this is a GREAT recipe and I will be making it again.  So HAPPY I doubled the recipe! Thank you for a great recipe!

This made a tasty banana bread. I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them and I used whole wheat flour instead of white.

This is definitely staying taped to the inside of the kitchen cabinet for quick reference! I use a 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour mixture in my baking, and the bread still came out perfectly. I was nervous I'd have to alter something in the ingredient list or bake time or something, but all three batches I've made so far have been gobbled up happily with rave reviews about how moist, how flavorful, and how well-textured the bread was. Thanks so much for sharing!! (I was going to add a photo, but the bread was gone before I could find my camera! Maybe next time...)

So good. I made it just as the recipe said and came out fabulous. I did sprinkle a mix of 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon into the bottom of the greased pan prior to adding the batter. Super recipe!

This bread is very nice, not very sweet (it almost could use some additional sweetener].  We made 2 loafs.  One as written, one with splenda and another sugar free product.  They both raised very nicely. The sugar free was a little more rustic in appearance. Yes I would use this recipe again.

This is THE BEST banana bread I have ever tasted. The recipe as it is was fantastic! I like to play a little with different stuff when I bake so I have tried a couple adjustments just fun! Instead of 1 cup of white sugar I've used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 dark brown sugar and then added 1 tsp cinnamon. It's wonderful both ways!

I tried it once, following the recipe exactly and it was OK. Then I read the reviews and adjusted it for my second attempt.  I used margarine (room temp), yogurt instead of sour cream (because that's what I had), and 3 medium mashed bananas.  We are now in banana bread heaven!

I had a couple of very over-ripe bananas that wanted to put to use so gave this recipe a try.. amazing!! The only changes I made were adding 1 cup of chopped walnuts instead of only a half cup and adding about a teaspoon of cinnamon. Will definitely make it again!!

This banana bread came out very moist.  Overall, this banana bread tastes good, my whole family loved it.  The flavor just didn't knock my socks off which is why I didn't list it at 5 stars.  It's a keeper for my recipe box though and I will make this again.

Made two loaves and just tried it.  Like others, I mashed the bananas and used 2 and 1/2 bananas per loaf.  It is good - moist and dense - but I agree with others that for my taste it is a little bland.  Maybe adding cinnamon and brown sugar would help, or some kind of crumb topping.  Definitely mash those bananas!!

This was sooo good!  Everyone who ate it raved about it and asked if they could take some home!  Next time I am going to double the recipe.  The only changes I made was used strawberry banana yogurt instead of sour cream, and added 1 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  This was sooooo moist and full of flavor.  This will be my go-to banana bread from now on!

This was so good! Mad it for mothers day brunch and everyone loved it! I made a few changes though, I added about a tablespoon of vanilla instead of a teaspoon and added a sprinkle of ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. I also split it into two loaves and baked them for 40 minutes instead of 60. Easily the best banana bread i've ever made!

I reduced the sugar by 1/4c. but it was still sweet enough. Substituted yogurt for the sour cream with no discernible difference. Delicious!

Made a double recipe with great results.  I did mash the bananas instead of slice and used pecans instead of walnuts.  This is a very moist bread.

I followed the recipe exactly. The taste is fantastic, but next time I will mash the bananas instead of slice. The big, mushy purple chunks just aren't appealing. I also had to cook it about an hour and 20 minutes for it to be done.

Really the best I've had or made. I did you mexican cream instead of sour creme 'cause it's what we had but that's so minor. The bread was moist, rich, delicious and sweet. Really I'm stowing this one away to use over and over. I always end up with some spare bananas getting a bit old and this is a perfect recipe. Kudos.

LOVE IT! Out of all the banana bread recipes I've tried in my life, this one is the best.  I used real butter.  Not sure if that would make a difference.

This Banana Bread was a huge hit at home and at work.  I made one modification.  Instead of 2 tsps of vanilla I use one tsp vanilla and one tsp banana extract.  It was great!!!

Loved this recipe but made a few changes.  Instead of all the margarine, I replaced 1/2 cup of it with ground flax seed.  I also added less sugar (3/4 cup).  I also added 1-2 tsp of cinnamon and extra vanilla....It was delicious!

I use this recipe over and over and its a hit with my kids every time.  The sliced bananas make for great banana-y flavour.  Its a very flexible recipe even when Im out of some ingredients. I use lactose free greek yogurt if Im out of sour cream and apple sauce if Im missing an egg. Sometimes I add shelled flax. Always a hit, the kids' friends ask for it when they come over and even beg for some if I put it in my sons' lunches!!

Delicious, moist banana bread.  I substituted plain Greek yogurt for sour cream, as I often do in recipes.  I also creamed the butter and sugar and mashed the bananas as recommended by other reviewers. My 19 month old twins and husband all loved it!

This is the best banana bread recipe you will find! I took the advise of other reviews and added lemon juice, baking powder and mashed the bananas not sliced. With or without nuts this is a delicious bread...I have also substituted yogurt for the sour cream, and Splenda sugar blend for the white sugar and it comes out great. Super recipe.

Very moist!  Will make again.  Substituted real mayo for sour cream (since I was out of s.c.). Replaced walnuts with 1/4 c. chpd macadamia nuts. Added 2/3 c. semisweet mini choc chips. Dashed with cinnamon and raw sugar on top for crunchy sweet aromatic top crust. I doubled the batch which yielded: 1 bundt pan, 1 9x5 loaf pan, 6 regular sized muffins. The house smells GREAT!!!

Made this yesterday morning because I had three bananas that I needed to use..  I did put all three of them ( but I mashed them up ) and followed the recipe as it was.... It was delicious and moist. the only thing I will do different the next time is put it in two pans that are a smaller size.... Great recipe!!!!

Loved it. I made mini loafs and they were very moist. Used a cup of bananas instead of 2. Measurements is important when cooking. Two could mean so many different volumes. Mom thought I was weird adding sour cream but it worked. I also melted the butter against other suggestions and it made the process easier. I mashed the bananas instead of slicing. Added the baking soda and salt to the butter then the flour so I didn't have to do separate mixing bowls. I split the batter in half and added chocolate chips. I was making this for breakfast the next day and they didn't make it past dinner.

Yummy. Only had some sour cream so i used apple sauce for the rest.  Also didn't have walnuts so i used almonds and i added flax seeds. and i mashed the bananas because of the other reviews, i wasn't gonna eat the bread right away so i didn't want purpley bananas in it. next time i will use applesauce instead, whole wheat flower and different nuts if I have them.

I made several loaves and everyone raved about the flavor. I did make one adjustment, I used 11/2tsp of vanilla per loaf. It was lovely and moist and very flavorful!

Like others I mashed the banana's rather than sliced them.  It made a great tasting bread with the perfect denseness and moistness as one expects in a banana bread.  I will be making this again...a keeper of a recipe.  Thank you.

PERFECT!!! This is the best banana bread I have ever tried! I am so happy to have finally found the perfect recipe. I added chocolate chips to mine. I did not have any sour cream, so I used plain yogurt and it turned out fine. This was absolutely wonderful, I really liked the ease of slicing the banana. And they were not noticeable, as far as texture. Thank you so much!!! :)

Excellent basic recipe.
I double it to make 2 loaves. (1 for my sister and BIL). We prefer the bananas mashed, but it's good either way.
Changes I make; Add extra bananas, double the walnuts, double sour cream, and before it goes in the oven I lightly sprinkle a mixture of sugar and cinnamon on top. Makes a great crunchy sweet crust.

i love this recipe and followed it exactly with no changes.  Have been using an old family recipe for years and it was ok but was always a little dry.  This is the most moist, delicious banana bread ever; probably because of the edition of the sour cream.  Try it!

I finally found a banana bread recipe that came out moist! I wasn't fond of the idea of slicing bananas into the bread so I mashed them up. I also ended up using 4 bananas since my bananas were on the smaller scale. I omitted the walnuts because I don't like nuts and used half a cup of whole wheat flour instead since I was out of all purpose. The cooking time took a tad longer than 60 minutes and the top was browning a bit too much so I just covered it with tin foil and lowered the temperature to 325 for another 15 minutes. I brushed a simple sugar syrup onto the cake once it came out of the oven. I'll be coming back to this recipe for when my banana bread cravings kick in!

I don't like the banana slices.  I tried again and used mashed bananas, did half brown sugar/half white sugar, and it is now my favorite banana bread recipe!

The absolute BEST banana nut bread recipe! I did take the advice of some others and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and it is delicious! I doubled the recipe and it made to loaves plus 2 mini-loaves. My husband and three boys couldn't get enough! I'll be making this often.

The only reason I am not giving this recipe five stars is the sliced banana. I use my stand mixer for everything, including the banana's which I just throw into the batter last and mix until the batter is smooth. The recipe produces a moist amazing tasting banana bread. Serves up great warm with Nutella. Enjoy!!

I leave out the nuts and mash the bananas.  I use a full cup of mashed banana so that is sometimes more than two, more like 2.5 to 3.  It bakes beautifully and is so moist and delicious.

Wow!  This is delicious.  I did a few things differently though.  I omitted the walnuts since my 4-year old won't eat anything with "chunks" in it and I added about 1/4 cup of finely shredded unsweetened coconut.  I also used 1 cup regular flour and a 1/2 cup of whole wheat for a little extra health benefit, which I quickly undid by adding 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips.  It turned out perfect and well-loved by all my kids.

Great recipe! I mashed the bananas and creamed room temperature butter with the sugar, as suggested, and it turned out so moist! I have an oven that heats quick so I lowered the oven temperature to 325 halfway through and it finished perfect at the hour! I highly recommend this recipe!

Awesome, easy recipe.  Made this in 5 minutes + baking time.  Substituted buttermilk + 3 tbsp extra butter for the sour cream and it came out perfect.  Will definitely make again.

First off it must be said that I am not a cook/chef or domesticated kitchen goddess but this was simple to make and I did take the advice of others by substituting yogurt for sour cream, adding a dash of cinamon and mushing the bananas. My boyfriend was chomping at the bit for it to be ready as the smell throughout the house was amazing - mine looked exactly like the photo so I was pleased!

I just made these and my kids are saying they are the best muffins ever!  I used five frozen over ripe bananas and added a half teaspoon of baking powder.  It made the muffins fluffier and my oldest says that and the slight crunchiness around the edges makes them so good!

This is definitely one of the top banana breads I have had.  I made it exactly as written except I didn't have walnuts I had pecans so I used them instead.  This has an excellent banana flavor with no spices (like cinnamon or nutmeg) that sometimes make banana bread taste more like a spice cake.  It is very tender, it does cut well and you can easily spread room temperature butter on it but a slice won't stand up to any "manhandling".  I suspect this is due to the sour cream.  But I really like it that way.  This is going to be my new "go to" recipe when I want banana bread.  The only change I plan to make is to increase the walnuts (or pecans depending on what I have on hand) the next time, as I like lots of nuts in banana bread.

Love this banana bread. I didn't have nuts but added 1/2 cup of some of my homemade granola which had nuts in it. I also added 1 tsp of Penzeys pumpkin pie spice. Great flavor and texture. I also mashed the banana.

This review would probably best reflect naples34102's review!  Mashed bananas and that little bit of lemon juice were the tweaks I used.  I love that the edges of the bread are just a little crystallized with the sugar in them!  My granddaughters will decimate this bread easily!  Yum!

I loved this recipe. I have one that I use often and this texture was okay for me, I prefer mine better. But I do like the moistness of the cake and how easy it is to make. I will be making this recipe again and again when I am in a hurry.  I did add 1 C full of mashed bananas rather than sliced ones.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated, and it came out great- really moist in the middle, but a nice crisp crust on the top.  Will make again.

I didn't like the chunks of banana but the rest of the recipe was great.  When I made it again I used 1 cup mashed banana and it was fantastic.  Next time I might try using brown sugar instead or white, or maybe 1/2 and 1/2.

Wonderful recipe, I just made a few changes. I put halfway between 1/2 and 3/4 cup sugar, and I put 1/2 the butter plus a thing of unsweetened apple sauce. Good Recipe!

This recipe was good but it came out weirdly salty, I thought. Next time I'll either reduce the salt or use unsalted butter. Otherwise it was nice and moist and delicious!

Moist, delicious banana bread! The only thing I changed was mashing the banana instead of slicing as the recipe calls for. I just couldn't get past the idea of big slices of banana in the bread.

My mom and I have been using a different recipe for ages, but when I found this recipe yesterday, I made it right there and then (since the ingredients were convienently already in my pantry). Turns out... My family of 5 finished it off before the day ended! Definitely our new favorite recipe. 

So yeah, most of the ingredients I had, but we didn't have sour cream; too lazy to think of a subsitute, I just decided not to include it. I also took out the nuts because my siblings were allergic. And lastly, thankfully looking at the other reviews beforehand, I mashed the bananas instead of slicing it - thank God I did, there were a few little chunks that I found while eating it and totally saw how slicing would NOT have worked out. So thanks for those reviews! 

After all that, it turned out 100% amazing, like I said, we loved it!

This is best banana bread I have ever tasted and I have tried a lot of banana breads! My modifications for a healthier version, which still came out fantastic: only used 1/2 cup of sugar (granted my bananas were extremely ripe), substituted the sour cream with plain yogurt, added 1/4 cup flaxseed meal in addition to the 1.5 cup flour, and added a splash of lemon juice to the banana mixture. I followed the recipe for everything else. I baked it in 3 mini loaf pans at 350 degrees and kept an eye on them. The toothpick came out clean in about 50 minutes. Like the other reviewers mentioned, make sure your eggs and butter are room temp. I have already made this twice in the last 2 days! Thanks for a great recipe. :)

Excellent banana bread. I've made this several times and it's delicious every time. I usually double the recipe because my family eats the first loaf the first day, and the second loaf we have for breakfast the next morning.

Have made this several times, and each time has been great! Substitutes worth noting are half brown/half white sugar, plain greek yogurt in lieu of sour cream. Just in case you had to improvise, they do work well!

This recipe is really tasty and easy. I made a few changes - mashed the bananas instead of slicing them and substituted non-fat vanilla yogurt for the sour cream. Next time I think I might add more bananas or some cinnamon - it was just slightly bland for my liking. I might also re-try with some chocolate chips!

This turned out perfect, I usually bake banana cakes, but I prefer this instead, it comes out sooo moist and the taste is amazing!

I did lightly sprinkle the tin with cinnamon sugar and added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the mix and adds a really nice flavor to it!

We ate our first one in a day (yesterday) and I am back to make another! =-)

I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream (we were out of sour cream). Turned out great. There is no photo because we ate all of it.

I used a mixer and just tossed in the banana pieces while it was mixing. The mixer mashed them up before I baked it. I just assumed that was what you were supposed to do, but reading the other comments I see some people didn't do it that way.

As is, I'm sure this would have been fantastic, but I did follow the tweaks of some others (cream the butter, split the sugar into brown and white sugar, mashed instead of sliced bananas). I used 3 overripe bananas (it was a little much), and also had no sour cream, so I just went without it. I must say, this bread is simply AMAZING. Probably one of the best things I have ever made.

Next time I make it, I'll use one less banana and add the sour cream, as it did seem like it would get a little dry. Definitely a keeper.

I'm lactose intolerant so substituted vegan margarine for the butter and full fat coconut milk for the sour cream.  It turned out beautifully!  Needed 10 mins less baking time with the substitutions.

I've baked this numerous times for my partner, and more recently for my friends, and everyone raves about how amazing it tastes!  I think next time I'll experiment a little and use different nuts, or also add chocolate chips.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

Wow! This banana bread is REALLY good! It's just as good as my mom's recipe, which people have always asked me to share. I only decided to try another recipe because I didn't have the 6 bananas my mom's recipe called for. I will definitely use this recipe again if I only have 2 bananas left, it is moist, rich, and delicious. 5 stars!

The flavor of this recipe is wonderful! I used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour and only 1 banana because that's all I had on hand. I think it's the sour cream that gives it the great flavor. I like it much better than other recipes I've tried that use oil, yogurt or applesauce.

I am still going to give this bread a 5 star rating even though it wasn't my favorite. My husband loved it. It is moist and good. Doesn't have the strong banana flavor I like and I like it bit spicy. So I think I could spice it up a bit. Otherwise it was a good banana bread for sure! (I made it exactly as the recipe said but may spices next time!)

Love love this recipe!!!  I may try using plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream to reduce calories.  I always use it in it's place, will see.  But this is the best and easiest to make.  You don't have to cream the sugar and butter as previously noted, melted butter works great and is much quicker.  10 minutes prep!

Have made this lots of times.  Used sour cream, greek yogurt and even blended cottage cheese (with a touch of water).  Very very good.

I made this recipe exactly as is only substituting the walnuts with chocolate chips (kids request).  It turned out fabulous.  Really moist but not falling apart. I will probably never make a different banana bread recipe.

I also mashed my bananas (3 medium very ripe ones) as I didn't want to bite into a chunk of cooked banana.  I also used about a cup of unchopped walnuts.  The rest I did according to the recipe.  It was nice and moist but I'm thinking I would have liked a bit of banana extract to make the banana flavor more pronounced.  I'd make it again.

On a previous occasions, I have made this recipe the way it was written and it was moist and delicious, but was trying to be a little healthier this time and use other ingredients I had on hand.  I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour, I only used 1 1/4 c sugar for the double batch, instead of 2 full cups, but used about 8 extra ripe bananas which made up for the lack of the extra sugar and made it more moist, and to give it a little more of a healthy boost, I added some flax seed.  I also used half low fat sour cream and half regular fat (because I had some regular that needed to be used) I think the bread turned out just as good as the original recipe and a tiny bit healthier.

I have made this a couple of times. Very good, moist, and flavourful. It does need more time in my oven than suggested but everyone should be able to adjust to their appliance. Thanks - it's a keeper.

This is my second time making banana bread and I have to say this recipe was much more delicious than the one I used before. The only thing I'm not fond of are the banana chunks. Its nice to bite into them but I found that they all worked their way to the bottom of the pan. I will be lashing my bananas from here on out. I did add a bit of cinnamon to the recipe. Half the bread was gone before I began Sharing....hahaha. I couldn't get enough.

I swapped some of the ingredients for lower calorie alternitives such as margerine, sugar/stevia blend, fat free sour cream and skim milk. It was great and incredibly moist. I also mashed the bananas as advised with good results. My husband said, "It dosent taste diet".

This is the most awesome banana bread recipe. I have taken this several places and always get rave reviews on it. My fiancee just loves it! I had a wonderful recipe but tried this one and it is now my "go to" recipe for sure. Moist, flavorful, easy and delicious! What more could one ask for other than it freezes very well too! The only change I made was to mash and not slice the bananas. I also used overripe bananas.

I didn't have sour cream so used not fat Greek Yogurt instead. Also used dark sugar instead of white.
I chopped bananas instead of slicing them. It was really moist and good! I guess healthier, too!
I recommend this way, too, even though I haven't quite tried original way.

I had tried the "original" recipe when someone else made it and it was quite good. I toast it and have it with a bit of butter. 
I decided to try a few different things and it turned out well. Here's what I did: used half white sugar and half brown sugar, added a bit of cinnamom and nutmeg, and instead of regular salt, I added Chocolate Chipotle Sea Salt, since I had some (great in lots of baking!-sold at a local artisan market))I also added chocolate chips and used pecan crumbs as I didn't have walnuts.

OMG! Best banana bread ever!  My only problem was that mine came out a little too moist, but I wasn't sure what a medium banana looked like so mine were probably too big.  I wish the recipe had a more precise measurement for the bananas.  Otherwise this is my new go-to recipe and I'm making mini loaves of it with dried cranberries for Christmas presents.  Thank you soooo much for this recipe!!!

This is the best banana bread recipe I have tried! Since discovering it a week ago, I have made at least a dozen loaves to share with people. Everyone who tries it raves about how moist it is.  

Since I never have sour cream at home, I sour my own cream. When I preheat the oven, I throw some heavy whipping cream in a bowl with a splash of white rice vinegar. After everything is mixed I throw it in with the rest of the ingredients. I also really like this recipe with pecans instead of the walnuts. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, I mash the bananas in a bowl before adding them to the mixing bowl. I find that it mixes more with rest of the bread.

For those who can't handle gluten, I used the same recipe with gluten free flour. I had to use a bit more flour (i just added a little more flour at a time until it was at the desired consistency). It tasted just as delicious. My gluten free friends loved this recipe and I'll definitely be making it again for them.

Awesome recipe.  The bread turns out very moist, and I've used flavored yogurt in place of about half of the sour cream with it turning out as well.  I mash the bananas instead of slicing.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe actually. Seeing all the great reviews, I expected great things. I took the advice and common sense of others and mashed to banana so the bread the next day wouldn't have odd colored/too mushy chunks. Putting the sour cream in made me question what it would taste like, but I reluctantly followed the recipe. Once it was baked, it looked great, then we tried it... It wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't classify it as a bread. It has the consistency of a pound cake.
All in all, my husband didn't love it, and neither did I. We won't be making it again. It's too bad it doesn't have more average reviews (that's all it deserves).

I love this recipe! I did make one change only because I have a bit of a sweet tooth ;) I added Ghirardeli milk chocolate chips. OMG to die for. I only added about 1/2. very delish. Thank you so much for this recipe. I make it almost weekly. Or when ever my bananas are going bad.

This is my best banana bread so far; it's very moist and cake like.  I did throw in 1/2 cup raisins and only used 1/2 cup of sugar and still found it too sweet; next time I'll just use 1/4 cup of sugar instead, other than that it's very delicious.

Love love love this recipe. The only thing I do different is add 1tsp of cinnamon and 1tsp of baking powder and I mash the bananas.  In my oven I had to turn it down to 325• and bake for an hour and a half.

The dough tastes yummy.   I substituted Splenda (trademark) baking sweetener for sugar and used 2/3 cups of pecans instead of 1/2 cup of walnuts.

This recipe was so easy and very yummy.  The first time I made it as instructed.  Turned out great!  A lot of people complained about the slices of banana not cooking in well enough.  I used my KitchenAid mixer to mix the batter and it seemed to break the slices into small pieces that melted into the bread.  The next time I did mash the banana, and since it was right after Thanksgiving I used 1/2c of pumpkin puree in place of the other banana.  Also added a small handful (maybe 1/2c) of chocolate chips.  So good!  Thanks for this easy and versatile recipe!!

This is the best banana bread recipe i have ever made. I usually double the ingredients to make 2 pans. I have also substituted the sour cream with buttermilk, and it is delicious. Just a hint if you don't have ant buttermilk, add a tablespoon of lemon juice to a cup of milk for a buttermilk substitute, works great! Thanks for the recipe!

This banana bread is delicious and moist. The only thing I would change is the oven temperature (I will try 325 the next time) because I like my bread a little less brown. Also, no matter what recipe I use,I always crush bananas when doing banana bread. These things are just personal preferences!

Excellent and moist, loved by everyone who tries it. 

I add 3/4 cup sugar, double the vanilla and bake at 325 for 50minutes, covering with foil for the last 10 minutes. Sometimes I add in a handful of semi sweet mini chips if i want it a little sweeter.

Cream butter (always at room temp) and sugar together WELL, very well, should be a pale golden colour. Then add eggs (also room temp) and vanilla. Smash up the bananas and add the sour cream in a separate bowl, then fold into the batter. When adding the flour do it by hand (no mixer) and fold it in GENTLY, your batter should be light and airy. Makes a perfect loaf this way.

Enjoy.

Loved it!  I made one batch as muffins and baked for 25 minutes.  I made a separate batch and baked as a loaf of bread.  I do not know why, but the bread tasted so much better.  The muffins did not seem to have the same strong flavor, and 2 of the muffins overflowed a little so it was a little bit of a waste. 

This is a delicious, moist bread.  I followed the ingredients  to a "T" except for slicing the bananas.  I mashed the bananas instead.  I will definitely make this again.

Very moist and yummy! I didn't slice the bananas as my five year old was in charge of cutting them and ended up more like mushing them. So the bananas were chunky and I think she ate some of them. Still turned out good. Either my oven cooks too hot or the temp should be less because the outside seemed to cook too fast and the inside wasn't done yet. So I just turned the oven off and let them sit in there for another 15 min. worked out okay.

First watch the video, and fallow directions of smashing and not slicing (that was a typo for sure). Fallowed to the tee, just used 1 over ripe banana with 2 other bananas. After I tasted when done mixing all ingrediants, I knew a loaf wouldn't do it, so I just made 12 muffins and still had enough left over for a small persoanal loaf. As for bake time started with 35 minutes, but then when I could smell the banana nut bread then would test for doneness YUM!!!!

I tried this with some minor modifications, since I am pre diabetic I like to reduce the sugar and fat.  I reduced the butter to 1/3 cup, and used splenda for 1/2 the sugar.  I also replaced half the flour with whole wheat (soft white wheat works excellent for quick bread recipes.)
I cut the bananas in quarters, and then sliced them to make smaller pieces.  Cooked as indicated and this came out perfect.  One of the best banana breads I have ever tried.

I found this recipe a couple of years ago and made it blindly....now, I have a waterstained, wrinkled copy next to my stove that I use all the time.  I can never seem to use up Costco bananas fast enough, so this is a great solution to that problem.  I always substitute plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream and often use pecans instead of walnuts.  I have four loaves sitting in the freezer right now....waiting for the best time to chow down.  It's really delic!

I did not have baking soda so put 2 teaspoons of bakign powder instead and mashed the bananas. 

Would not change a single ingredient!!!

 Needed about 1 hour and 20 minutes in the oven.

I made this for the fire department that my husband is on as a treat after a long night of fire training in cold, rainy weather. They LOVED it! My one year old son would stand at the counter where I cut it and beg for more, and more, and more. What a wonderful recipe to keep handy for frequent use!

This was fantastic...the best banana bread I have ever eaten!  I would recommend mashing the bananas or cutting them very, very thin otherwise there might be lumps of banana mush.

Turned out amazing -- very moist and dense with an excellent banana flavor.  I will confess that I mashed my bananas instead of slicing, and I made a crumb topping with brown sugar, flour and butter for the top.  I will definitely adopt this as my banana bread recipe from now on.

Good and easy recipe, however I wanted to do it low-fat, so instead of using butter, I used 1/2 cup of apple sauce and  since I have 2 really ripe bananas, i reduce the sugar by half and use brown sugar instead, also a teaspoon of cinnamon gave it a fall flavor to it.

The only banana bread recipe I'll ever use.

Found this recipe about a year ago and finally getting around to reviewing it, though I've used it several times.  It's the BEST!!!  Nice and moist every time.  One thing I have enjoyed adding to the recipe is putting a layer of granola on the bottom of the baking dish, and sprinkling a bit more granola on top.  You can try all sorts of flavors.  (My boyfriend is not a fan of nuts, so this gives me a bit of crunch, while not "ruining" the banana bread for him)

I have to admit that I tried this recipe because it had my name on it. It turned out great just as the recipe is written. I added chocolate chips to it the second time I made it - I'm a bit of a chocoholic- and again it turned out great. this is a good way to use up those too ripe banana's at the end of the week.

Nice and moist banana bread.  I add 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the batter; and I slice and smash the bananas for a more even banana flavor throughout the batter.

I loved this recipe! It was so easy. I modified just a little: used margarine instead of butter and didn't melt it. Used 1/4 cup packed brown sugar and 3/4 cup granulated white sugar. Added cinnamon and ground cloves. Added 1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate morsels. It was moist through the middle and had a nice crust. WILL NOT bake in only 60 minutes. I think mine was in for around 80-90 minutes using metal 9x5 loaf pan.

The kids and I love this banana bread! They ask me to make it regularly and choose it for dessert and think they're getting away with something when I "let" them eat it before school. I threw out all the other banana bread recipes that I've tried before. The small changes I make...I don't melt the butter, I mush the bananas and I use chocolate chips instead of walnuts. I usually need to cook it for about 10min longer than suggested. Otherwise, it's banana perfection :)

This recipe is great.  I serve it as banana cake though, instead of banana bread. I mash the bananas.  I also cook this in a cake dish and serve it with icing, usually a cream cheese icing.  Always a big hit!

Wonderful, quick and easy.  I added chocolate chips, because chocolate makes everything even tastier and probably more walnuts than were called for (didn't measure), so I ended up needing a bigger pan to bake it in, but it was perfect. Everyone loved it!

I followed the exact recipe but reduced the sugar to just 1/2 cup because I don't really like it very sweet (after all, banana itself is sweet enough). It turned out wonderfully and fragrant. I will definitely make it again.

Best ever banana bread. I hate to alter things at all but we choose mini dark chocolate chips sometimes instead of the nuts (mostly to follow nut-free rules for school). I do use my bananas that I stock pile in the freezer so they are really soft and more like a puree of fresh bananas not slices. I have made mini muffins, regular muffins, bread...all shapes and sizes and all totally DELICIOUS!!! Thanks Janet for one of my go-to recipes for my family.

This is a great recipe, I made a few minor adjustments my bananas were already very ripe so I mashed them instead of slicing them.  I must admit when I read the sour cream part I was a bit hesitant but I saw how many 5 stars this had and decided to go with it, the banana bread was super moist, and only lasted about 1 hour in the house before every last crumb was gone, thank you Janet for such a great recipe

I LOVE this recipe and I follow it exactly except one thing: I always put three large bananas.  I figure banana bread should have a lot of banana!  I serve this to our tour clients and they always comment that it is the best banana bread ever... I like to believe them.

Great recipe! I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and 3/4 cup brown sugar, mashed 2.5 bananas and baked it in two slightly smaller loaf pans for just under 50 minutes. So freaking good!

No sour cream?  No problem. Sub 1/2 cup milk with 1/4 cup oil. I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts and mashed the bananas because the sliced ones settled at the bottom. Delish!

I read reviews and also mashed the bananas, it turned out wonderful! All the family just raved about it, it's been months since I've made any. I've always used my Grandmas' tried and true recipe, but was looking for something new and had sour cream to use up. Thanks for posting, it's my go to from now on!

This is a great recipe and I've added my own touches over the years.  Definitely mash the bananas instead of slicing.  If I don't have sour cream, my homemade yogurt works just as well.  Depending on how I feel, I'll also add nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves.  It's so moist and delish -- a family favourite!

It tastes amazing!!! My first banana bread from scratch...i used 3 very riped bananas and mashed with a potato masher. Thankfully had every ingredient in the fridge/cupboard so i tried to follow instructions to the T. possibly added a few table spoons of milk extra since it spilled...lol. but cooked at 350F degrees for exactly 60 minutes and it is perfect! crispy crunch on the outside and super moist on the inside! So flavorful. also, i used a 8x8 pan.

I was looking for a recipe to use some ingredients I had on hand to make banana nut bread and this was great!  I added chocolate chips and my family loved it.  I am getting rid of my old recipe and this will be a keeper. Moist, great flavor, and the sour cream I think is key.

I love this recipe!  I did add a bit more banana and as others suggested I mashed them rather than sliced.  I also added a pinch of cinnamon and used a mixture of walnuts and pecans.  The bread was moist and delicious!  Thanks!

I agree about mashing or pureing the bananas. Slicing them as you indicate in this recipe just gives an unsightly look to the loaf and the texture isn't the same. Plus I find that I'd bite pockets of banana flavor rather than the entire load having that banana taste.

This recipe is wonderful!  I don't understand the people who gave it low marks for the sight and feel of bananas.... uhmmm... why do you want banana bread if you don't like bananas?  This is the best banana bread I've ever had and the family and friends I've made it for agree.

This recipe was easy to make.  However, I would mash the bananas rather than slicing them, so you don't have large slimy, brown banana chunks.  It also stuck to the pan, even though it was greased :(

This banana bread is so good. Very moist and flavorful. It is easy to make and tastes so delicious. The only thing I did different was I used pecans instead if walnuts as I had no walnuts on hand. Actually, I prefer pecans and the flavor and crunch they lend. My husband really 
Iked it, too.

I have been using the same banana bread recipe for years and decided to try a different one. WOW. Just by adding the sour cream made it so moist and yummy. My grandkids couldn't get enough. I wll be using this recipe from now on.

I have been making banana nut bread since I could bake, and now I have a new recipe! This is SO moist and delicious! I also mash the bananas and add an extra one (I double the recipe to make two breads so a total of 5 bananas) and cut down the sour cream to about 2/3 cup since I thought it took away a little of the banana flavor. Thanks for this recipe!!

Like others did, I added 1 tsp. lemon juice with the vanilla, and use 1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder, and 1-3/4 c. flour. Delicious!
The best bread I ever baked.

This recipe is absolutely divine! I did make 2 easy changes. I mashed up the bananas, 2 like the recipe needed and I used 1 packed cup brown sugar instead of white. To me white sugar makes no sense in a bread. Best recipe I've tried! And I've made a lot! Try it..

I decided to make this yesterday even though i suck at baking :P The family said "I don't like Banana Bread", but mysteriously I found their mouths full of bread and crumbs. It turned out amazingly delicious. I did make 2 slight changes: (1) mashed the bananas & (2) added a small amount of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I had a slice for breakfast this morning and I didn't have my morning snack until 11:30--it's the perfect breakfast yum!

I used black walnuts instead and it turned out phenomenally! I also mashed the banana, but left some big chunks here and there because I was worried about the banana flavor spreading around. This is possibly the best bread I ever made, but as I am eating it right now still warm from the oven I might be a bit biased.

Best banana bread I've ever made (and I make it a lot)! Easy and so moist, beautiful color. This is now my go-to recipe for banana bread. I also was able to make it once in a Nuwave oven and it had even more flavor, as if that was possible. It's still good without the nuts, but I think it makes the flavor really stand out so I would definitely recommend putting the nuts in if you have them on hand.

Delicious. The only changes I made was: using 1 cup of mashed bananas instead of sliced, and I creamed softened butter with sugar instead of melted. Will be making again!

this was soo good! I half a nut-hater and a chocolate-hater in my house, so i did half the batch as directed and the other half i substituted the nuts for chocolate chips. Both sides are divine - so moist and tasty!

Absolutely delicious! Do smash the banana. I keep peeled bananas in the freezer now, so I can always make a loaf. Tonight I am out of nuts, so I'm trying raisins...

Rich, moist, delicious to say the least! My kids could not stop eating this. I've made a lot of banana bread over the years. This is the first time I added sour cream - it was fabulous!! Definitely will use this recipe again...thank you Janet!!  ~Kim

I love this banana bread, and so does my family!  I make no changes to the original posted recipe.  Some reviews state that they do not like the texture of the sliced bananas.  If you are using VERY ripe bananas, you will find that when you mix in the slices they really nearly blend in, and the texture is good.  If you use bananas that are only moderately black, to hardly black at all you will find that the slices stack in tact and do get somewhat gummy and discoloured.  Stick with really, really ripe bananas for this bread and it will not disappoint.

As some of the other reviews say, the bananas were a bit difficult to deal with. Mashing is a better option. However, this was amazing banana bread! I used 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips instead of the walnuts, and it was perfect. I will be making it again (and again).

This banana bread is absolutely wonderful! I do agree with other posters, though. I'm not a big fan of the chunks of bananas, so I just mash mine. Regardless, the recipe is perfect and the bread is always dense, moist, and delicious.

I've made this recipes now about 4 times and it is just amazing! 
One variation is to add 1/2 TBSP of cinnamon & a full TBSP of Vanilla.
Every one who has eaten my Banana muffins LOVES them. I can't keep them in the house. I had this recipe given to me from an ex's mother but lost it so it was a relief to find it again. Hand down the best banana bread (or muffins) ever!

This recipe is perfect!  I had 4 VERY ripe bananas so I had to use a little extra flour to balance out the extra liquid.  I used plain greek yogurt for the sour cream.  It turned out so moist!  My search for moist banana bread is over!  (Next time if my bananas are that ripe, I'll use less sugar)

Yummy! I did not have walnuts so I did not use them in this recipe and I doubled it and put it in three loaf pans using 5 bananas. I like the sliced bananas, it's kind of extra yummy to get that super banana bite every once in a while. The consistency was great, dense but not crazy dense. I did put a little brown sugar on top before baking. Very delicious

This is an amazing recipe... and so easy!!! I do agree with other bakers about the bananas being sliced and therefore a little mushy. My kids were even more freaked out by the mushy chunks. Next time, I will mash! Everything else was AMAZING!!

I love this recipe! I made it for my sister and my mother and they told me that it was one of the best banana breads they have had! The only thing that I did different to it was add glazed pecans (the kinds that you use for salads/snacks) into it. They were so good!

This was pretty good but not as good as I was expecting. My husband and I didn't care for the chunks of banana's so I would definitely mash them next time. It was very moist and had a good flavor. I didn't have vanilla so I used 1 tsp of apple juice. We didn't miss the vanilla at all.

Great recipe, however, I couldn't resist changing it up a bit. Instead of white sugar I threw in Splenda and added some spices. Banana bread to me needs spices. Also, just to slim it down just a bit I added Fage Greek Yogurt. So I can't wait for it to come out the oven. Already smells divine!

Very good and simple banana bread to make.  I have made it several times in the past month for my family of 5, and they keep asking for more. I followed the advice of others and mash the bananas which works great.

Okay, this was amazing, and SO EASY (well I took forever since im so OCD about measuring stuff out). But yeah, didn't have any walnuts or sour cream, so I just added a little mayo instead, had the same effect. I was a little nervous since I used the light olive-oil butter instead of normal butter, but it turned out just as great and alot more guilt free! Even though that's a little more expensive, the quality of the ingredients really does make a difference! Im trying so hard to keep my hands off of it!

Yummy. Best banana bread I've made. This is my husbands favorite dessert and he said hands down the best. I didn't slice my bananas but next time I will, I just used very over ripped ones that wudnt allow me to slice. I added a butter and brown sugar topping to mine as well.

Phenomenal banana bread. I've made it several times, and it is excellent every time. This is my only banana bread recipe now. I only bake for 50 minutes...that seems to be perfect for my oven. And one other change I make occasionally, if I have it on hand, is to reduce sugar to 1/2 cup and use 1/2 cup Stonyfield Banilla (banana-vanilla) yogurt in place of the sour cream. Ahhhhhmazing!

I managed to make a few changes to literally cut the calories and fat in half without sacrificing how tasty and moist the bread is! I used Land 'O' Lakes light butter, Truvia Baking Blend instead of sugar, and Plain Greek Yogurt in place of sour cream. DELICIOUS!

This was incredibly moist! I used room temp butter and I didn't slice the bananas but threw them into the bowl whole which is what I always do. I also lined the pans with cooking spray and cinnamon sugar which is amazing! And of course, I added chopped pecans!

This recipe is delicious. I smashed up 4 medium size bananas. I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Since I only had 1/4 cup of black walnuts that is the amount I used. The bread was done in 50 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe.

My family loved this! After reading the reviews, I decided to use a blender to beat the eggs, sugar, and butter 'til fluffy, then also used 1 tsp of both baking soda and baking powder.I didn't have sour cream but used plain yogurt. It was wonderful! My new favorite banana bread recipe.

This was really good, but tasted more like a cake than a quick bread. Still really tasty. I might try it with some cream cheese frosting next time.

I mashed my bananas and used half whole wheat flour.  I doubled the recipe (lots of bananas to use up!) and made a loaf plus chocolate chip muffins.  I have tried many banana bread recipes but this was by far the best.  Wonderful banana taste and rich texture.  So good the muffins didn't even need the chocolate chips.  This is my new go-to recipe.

I made this bread last night and i had doubled the recipe . I did not have a loaf pan so I used two square pans. This bread turned out so well. There is only a half a pan left, my husband, four kids and some of their friends ate almost all of it already. I did decide to mash the bananas like others suggested, and i added a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of nutmeg like others suggested. But this will definately be my go to recipe for banana bread from now on. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe.

This is the third time I've used this recipe and it's great.  So easy and I love the chunks of banana in it.  I'm happy to have a good recipe to use up bananas instead of trashing them when they go bad.

I don't like banana bread at all so I made this for my family.  They may never actually get a chance to taste it because I just may eat it all!  It's delicious!!  I threw in some semi-sweet chocolate chips cause that's how I roll.  I'd give it more stars if I could!!

I've tried several banana bread recipes over the years and this is my favorite.  It's moist and full of flavor.  
As a personal preference I use light sour cream and mashed the banana instead of slicing it.

had some bananas that were begging to be mashed and turned into some bread - so, in a half-hearted attempt to not waste produce - - i happened upon the best banana bread ever. literally, worth every bit of 5 stardom. i guess my bananas were a bit on the smaller side of medium so i used 2.5 - and mashed them up (best part!). i also used 1 jumbo, and 1 medium egg., and 3/4 cup chopped pecans instead of walnuts. the sour cream and butter really shine. super tender and sweet, almost like a coffee cake instead of a quick bread. i want to make this over and over again!

I have 3 Go To banana bread recipes & this is one of them.  I bake for 'kitchen challenged' friends & some prefer this recipe over the others.  I don't add nuts usually but it doesn't effect the end product at all.  Good texture, flavor & it just gets better after a few days...if it lasts that long.

Absolutely wonderful! I used fat free sour cream - couldn't tell a difference. Definitely will continue to make this.

Excellent, however, substituted splenda for sugar and Greek yogurt for sour cream.  Cook with what you have.  Everybody loved the bread and my diabetic relatives could have desert with the family.  Thank you for sharing.  Moose

This banana bread was super moist and very easy to make. The sides did not burn onto the pan and was very easy to take out when done. I did add come cinnamon to the mix as well as 2 1/2 tablespoons of extra butter.

This is my go-to banana bread recipe.  It comes out great every time and is so easy! The only changes I make are to add an extra banana and 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  So moist, flavorful and fabulous!

This banana bread recipe is so yummy!  I subsituted mini chocolate chips for walnuts and the kids couldn't get enough.  (I didn't want to stop eating it either.)  We loved it so much we made a 2nd batch to enjoy, as the first batch went quickly.  It's a keeper.

This is the best recipe ever, however I used softened butter, added 1 t. lemon juice, changed the flour to 1 3/4 c., and mashed the bananas to equal 1 cup, as on other reviewer suggested. It was moist and tasty!

This is the only banana bread I will use! Over the years I've fiddled with the recipe a couple times. I use 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup coconut oil and mash 2- 2 1/2 cups bananas. (We love bananas in this house) Finish with some sprinkled nutmeg on top. Yum! I've also tried including apple sauce and substituting butter entirely with coconut oil.

I just made this and it came out AMAZING!!! :D I definitely tweaked this a little and did some stuff from other reviews i read. Instead of melting the butter, I microwave it for about 15-20 sec and then i combined half cup of white sugar & other half cup of light brown sugar. And instead of using allpurpose flour i used bread flour, since i know the bread flour would give it a different texture, i used 2 large eggs and a wee bit more sour cream (probably 1/2 tbs extra). i also added about half tsp of baking powder. and i used 3 bananas but i literally measured it after smashing them and it was a cup. put it in the oven for an hour, i turned it off in the first 50 min and left it in there for the last 10 min then took it out.

I made four loaves today.  I followed the recipe exactly for the first two, but I ran short on sour cream for the last two, so I substituted half and half to make up the difference. All loaves were EXCELLENT, loved by all. (Note: When I checked with a toothpick at 60 minutes, they were still mushy. Cook time was about 70 minutes to perfection.)

I have made this banana bread at least 10 times in the last 2 months.  It's amazing!  I use walnuts like the recipe calls for , but have also substituted 1/2 cup of chocolate chips as well.  I think the secret is the sour cream.  A definite keeper!

Excellent recipe! Easy to make and delicious. I also added a few chocolate chips to make it even better. 
I didn't have sour cream, I will use next time because I will be making this banana bread many more times. It is so good!

I loved it!  The only thing I changed, was the bananas.  I mashed them instead of slicing.  It spreads more evenly throughout the bread, instead of there being chunks of cooked banana.  My family loved it, and it was so quick and easy!

This recipe is AWESOME!! I added cinnamon and didnt have sour cream on hand so used plain Greek yoghurt instead - just as good. I do prefer mashing the bananas instead of adding them sliced. This loaf also freezes beautifully, and tastes great toasted after it has defrosted. Thank you for the great recipe!

This has to be the best banana bread recipe out there! So moist and so delicious! I however, did mash my bananas (I love the banana flavour so I used 3 bananas instead of 2) and instead of sour cream, I used plain yogurt. I also added a dash of cardamon and cinnamon. I took a reviewer's advice and set it for 325 for one hour and 15 mins. Perfection!!

To substitute for sour cream, you can use 1/3 cup cream cheese, 1 tsp lemon juice or vinegar, and enough milk to fill the remaining 1/2 cup.  I also add about  2 more bananas, but I slightly mash them instead of slicing them.   This is the best banana recipe ever!   Thank you for sharing!.

Best Banana Bread I have ever had. My husband loves it. What a money saver making it yourself, its so quick and easy to make. The only thing I do different is I cut the banana into small pieces and I cook for 54 min to make it really moist.

This is the best recipe I've found!  It's easy, doesn't take much time, and it turned out moist and delicious.  I used frozen bananas that I thawed in the microwave, and chocolate chips instead of walnuts.  Delicious!

This recipe is great just the way it is. There were a lot  of reviews saying to cream the butter, use a mixer...add this and add that - maybe they should just use another recipe. This turned out moist with the perfect denseness.  I did mash the bananas though because I do not like chunks of banana in my bread.
This is my new go to banana bread recipe.

Best banana bread ever! I've been trying some other recipes but this is the one! Sour cream makes it moist and you can taste banana and walnuts on every bite. No need to look anyplace else.

I tried this recipe on a whim trying to use up some bananas that were turning brown. It was quick, easy and delicious!!!I mashed the bananas instead of sliced. Also was able to have my 2 yr old daughter help me which is a bonus for me with any baking recipe.

Most amazing banana bread I've ever made. I switched it up a bit, substituted half the butter for applesauce, mashed the bananas and used brown sugar but honestly the best I've had, family and friends who tried it agreed!

Great banana bread base.  Very moist and dense.  I did make some changes so that's why the 3 stars.  Used crisco + 1 tablespoon water, mashed the bananas, creamed the crisco (did not melt it) and sugar first with a mixer, added mini chocolate chips.  I'm not sure this is the best but it's a great start.  But to be fair I did change the recipe a bit.

This is the BEST banana bread I have ever made!! Followed the list of ingredients exactly except for using pecans instead of walnuts (because that is what I had on hand). Only change I made was to mix all of the wet ingredients together, including the bananas (mashed) & sour cream; then I added the dry ingredients followed by the nuts. This recipe is definitely a keeper!! Thanks for sharing!

This was by far the best banana bread I have ever made. We used pecans instead of walnuts, and used less of them (maybe a cup, chopped) but that was a matter of taste. It was so moist and baked up beautifully. Definitely a keeper!

Absolutely delightful! The texture is so light and fluffy and remains very moist through and through. I substituted regular, non-flavored yogurt (and a tsp of baking soda) for thee sour cream and it turned out perfectly fine. I also mashed most of the bananas, but I did leave some finely chopped

I made some adjustments to the recipes: 1) I used baking powder, not baking soda; 2) I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them; 3) I made muffins & 2 loaves.

I think that the bread turned out okay.  The only issue that I had with it is that it seemed a little gooey on the center of the bread, whether it was the muffin or loaf.  Besides that, it was a decent receipe.  I will try it again, but I'll make other adjustments.

The best recipe ever! I followed the recipe and sliced the bananas to silvers and chopped them. That gave the bread an intense flavor.
I didn't have baking soda so I substitute for baking powder and increased the baking time by 10 minutes. .

For those who need gluten free foods, I changed this recipe. I used gluten free all purpose flour, gluten free baking soda and when it came to the bananas, I mushed them, because if you can still slice the banana, it is not ripe enough to be cooked. The brown in the banana is the sugar coming to the surface, so the more brown and mushy the banana, the better the bread. This was truly a lovely Gluten free banana bread that made everybody's mouth water and ask for more. This recipe made it into my personal favs file. Awesome for sure.

I left out the walnuts (Bleh! Not my thing.), added a sprinkle of cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, and I pureed the bananas for a smoother consistency. It was absolutely yummy! I am so happy I can make this myself now and not have to buy it from a bakery. And everyone was so impressed. Thanks for the recipe.

Great bread!! I sliced the bananas but will probably mash next time, I also realized I was out of vanilla after I started so I added about a tablespoon of maple syrup instead, that was great! I also added half a cup of choc. chips, skipped the walnuts and sprinkled cinnamin on top, made for a delicous and easy bread!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing

It was good.  Perhaps my bananas weren't bananay enough cause I don't think it has a lot of flavor.  It's very moist but a bit on the bland side.

Delish!! Used my kitchenaid mixer to cream the butter and sugar and beat the eggs, then folded in the remainder of the ingredients with a spatula. Mashed the bananas instead of slicing and substituted 7oz Chobani Banana Honey yogurt for the sour cream since I didn't have any on hand. The moistest banana bread ever! Thanks so much for sharing.

Yummy! The sour cream gave this bread a really good flavor.. although I might decrease the amount of butter next time. Thanks for a good recipe!

This is by far the best banana bread recipe EVER!  I still mash the bananas up though, because I prefer to not have the chunks of banana, and my bananas are usually so ripe they just mash when I cut them anyway!

This was my first attempt at making banana bread. This recipe was easy and completely delicious.  The only changes I made, I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract and I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them.  My husband is a phenomenal chef and he loved it ... almost ate the whole loaf in one night!  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thank you.

Oh. My. Goodness. AMAZING. I've always stood by my mom's banana bread recipe but this one takes the cake (and tastes better than cake!) 
I added an extra banana because I had one more going. And I made 2 loaves so I had to bake it for an extra 20 mins and lowered to 325* (60 mins for 2 loaves it was still not cooked in the middle). 
Really wonderful recipe!

Very tasty, very moist, very addicting
but too moist- nearly soggy not necessarily doughy because it is cooked, its just like a play-do texture at the bottom. might be do to sour cream but I put in extra both times ive made it along with extra banana because i didnt have the nuts and the flour...well im not really sure if more or less makes it less or more doughy. i'll be making this forever though because of how great it tastes!

This recipe tried and true, is thee best banana bread I have ever made. The sour cream makes it so moist, not to mention the wonderful smell that fills your entire house while these are baking in the oven. These are a family favorite. The only thing I omit from the recipe is the chopped walnuts. I prefer pecan pieces sprinkled on top, I think they make a great addition!

Yum! I used egg whites, whole wheat flour, and plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I also mashed the bananas and added a cup of apple sauce. It came out perfectly tasty and moist.

This Banana bread was amazing!  Definately the best I have ever had!  I didn't change much except I did add an extra banana so the flavor was very robust and I also mashed instead of cut the bananas. Great recipe thanks for sharing!

This recipe was absolutely perfect as-is.  I had it in a smaller loaf pan, so it had to bake an extra 8 minutes, but still came out perfect!  It was gone before I could even put it in the kitchen at work!

So easy and wonderfully moist and tasty -- good thing, because my family is now on a banana strike so they will go soft and I can make this again. I didn't have walnuts, so I substituted dried cranberries... Mmm!

The sour cream made this version very moist, so moist that it was heavy.  I prefer to add an extra banana and a couple of tsp. of milk.

Great and simple banana bread recipe.  I made mini loaves and muffins.  Next time I think I will add some cinnamon, just to give it a bit more festive taste.

Great recipe!  We used a mixer to prepare it so there weren't any chunks of banana left once we baked it.  But it still turned out incredible.

This recipe was very good! I mashed my bananas which was so much better though and used bread flour. Will defintely keep this recipe on hand to use again. Easy to make. As recommended, I did turn my oven down to 325 degrees so it wouldn't turn too dark before the inside got done.

Bottom stuck badly, will flour pan next time. Made according to naples34102 modifications-creamed buttered with sugar tsp each of baking soda and powder. Added clove, allspice and cinnamon. Added a streusel topping of 3 TBS cold butter, heaping tablespoon of brown sugar, TBS white sugar and a TBS of flour and some cinnamon chopped until crumbly. VERY good flavor and moist! Did not rise in middle like so many recipes do. Looked just like picture. Trying next loaf now with half brown sugar, half white.

This recipe was deeeelicious!!  I made it exact then added chocolate shavings instead of the nuts as my choice...it is now my favorite go to for a banana bread recipe :) p.s. I baked it @ 325* because in past experience I found that a 350* temp has a tendency to make it turn out dry..the temp change didn't affect the cooking time and I have a much moister bread.  :)

So delicious and moist! I mashed my bananas instead of slicing them and didn’t have walnuts on hand but it was still the best banana bread I’ve ever had! My husband usually isn’t a big fan of banana bread but said it was phenomenal! I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe came out so moist! I used an electric mixer and mushed the bananas when mixing it in. Next time I am going to let it cool longer before I try and cut a slice. I just could not wait!

Holy yummy!  This was my first ever attempt at banana bread and it turned out perfect.  I think I would opt for mashing the bananas though as my kids might scoff at the grayish banana chunks in it.  Other than that though I couldn't have asked for a better result!

The best banana bread I have ever had! I have gotten the most compliments ever. My house is full of non-nut eaters (boo) so I used mini-semi sweet chocolate chips instead.

This is a great banana bread recipe.  The bread always turns out so moist. Since it is such a fantastic recipe,  I decided to it try and make muffins with a can of pumpkin and one banana.  I then added pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon.  I also made it a bit more healthy, so I used wheat flour, applesauce instead of butter and also used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  These were delicious. This will be my recipe if I want banana bread or if we are in the mood for pumpkin muffins.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Yum. This is a really good one! I happened to have sour cream on hand so I made it.  I have found my new banana bread recipe. I usually switch it up just because I always think I can find a better one, but this is the one! I doubled the recipe and used about 6 bananas instead of four.  I mashed them too rather than slice.  For one loaf, I added mini choco chips.  For the other, I added fresh blueberries and pecans.  Awesome recipe! So glad I happened upon it.

I followed  naples34102 version but changed butter to Imperial and used fat free sour cream. Omitted lemon cause I didnt have any. It was great! My kids and husband give it two thumbs up, as do I.

Very good! I didn't have sour cream so I used vanilla/banana yogurt instead, turned out awesome. I will say that I mashed the bananas more than just sliced them, and that helped the appearance. I will be making this often.

EXCELLENT!!!!  Best Banana Bread recipe ever!  I wait until the bananas are pretty ripe. Slicing them instead of mashing gives you a better banana flavor in every bite. The sour cream keeps the bread so moist even a few days after baking!! Sometimes I throw about a 1/2 cup of choc chips but not too much or the choc overpowers the banana taste. SO GOOD highly reccomend!! YUMMMM!

Great recipe! Tasty out of the oven but amazing the next day it's  moist and melt in your mouth goodness. Next time I think I will go lighter on the sugar it was a little to sweet for my taste buds. My family loved it, will make again!

I will forever be known as the banana bread girl in some circles because of this.

I had to take the recommendations from others and modify it a bit, though. I used 4 mashed, frozen bananas, and I don't think it would've been 'Banana Bread' without the addition.

I also excluded the walnuts, but that's more a personal preference.

A side note: I ended up doubling the recipe and baking in a bundt pan (don't have a 9x5). If you do this, just be prepared to cook it longer (I think it was 1 1/2 hrs...?)

This is the best and most moist banana bread I have made yet.  Like some others suggested I softened the butter and creamed it with 1/2 c white sugar 1/2 c brown sugar.  I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp fresh ground cloves.
I know my family is going to keep asking me to make this over and over again.  Really delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Hey, I love this recipe ! ! !

I doubled the quantity because I had 5 bananas going rotten.  They were small-med size and using 5 didn't fluke the recipe.  I mashed the bananas because that's what I grew up with.

I didn't fold any walnuts in (my co-worker hates nuts and I so wanted to share this bread with my co-workers w/o any arguments) and the taste was still delicious.

I also ran out of sugar and used light brown sugar.  I just eyed and tasted the batter until I found it "right".  Still no harm done to the banana bread.

I even used 2 smaller loaf pans on 350 degrees for 30 minutes and that came out nicely, too.  I think I'll use the small pans next time because they looked "cuter."

This recipe is flexible and versatile.  I can see adding spices or more nuts, even chocolate chips to the mix would still come out moist and perfect.

P.S:  Although she's really great @ what she does F*** the Martha Stewart way of doing things.

I have been using this site for over a couple of years now.  I have read many reviews but never written one before this.  I love, love this recipe.  I have made it 3 times now.  Everyone that has tasted it has also enjoyed it.  I like to read what others have written and the changes they have made.   I took advice from a couple of different readers by using 3 to 4 ripped banana mashed with a little cinnamon sugar, removed 2 tablespoon of sugar and replaced with cinnamon sugar to the butter and greased the pan with Pam buttery spray then coated spray with cinnamon sugar.  I thought it gave it a nice flavor and removed from pan easily.   This recipe is delicious.  Thank you for posting it.

PERFECT CUPCAKES! Yes cupcakes... Moist and light. I also took the advise of previous reviews & mashed the banana's. Then spooned 2 tbsp. into each cupcake liner in my cupcake tray. I then made my cream cheese whipped frosting (1 8oz package of cream cheese, 1/3 cup sugar, & 1 tsp. vanilla extract. Then fold in one small tube of cool whip). Ohh it was AMAZING!!!!  :P

I loved the recipe.  I accidentally added 3 eggs so I just added a some extra flour.  I also used my kitchen aid mixer and the banannas were soft so they really blended well into the mix.  A totally delicious recipe!! Thanks for sharing ! :)

A tasty banana bread with a good texture. Like other reviewers I mashed the bananas and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon for extra fragrance and flavour. Also works well with half the amount of sugar and no walnuts. As with most banana breads it tastes better after being cooled for a few hours. A really nice recipe!

Moistest delicious banana bread I have ever baked :)
It was soooo good
Its only been few hours and half the loaf is gone already!

I made few modifications to make it a little bit healthier
I used 1 cup of honey powder instead of white sugar
I used 1 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour
Used 1/2 cup of strawberry yogurt instead of sour cream

And I added a teaspoon of baking powder
2/3 cup of chopped walnuts
and 4 medium bananas mashed

I will definitely make it again!

I loved my bread moist
almost melting in mouth
But it does get your fingers sticky with banana bread goodness
I will try increasing the flour to 1 3/4 cup next time

Personally like my banana breads little bit firmed up, kept in fridge over night
Soooo good


Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I tried this recipe today. I followed the recipe, only I added cinnamon. It turned out great except it was a little too sweet for my taste. I definitely will make it again with less sugar maybe a half cup. The best banana bread I made so far.

My first attempt at making banana bread and it was wonderful!  The only change I made was to use 3 bananas because they were going bad.  It was perfect!  Thanks!

Best banana bread recipe ever. Added a pinch on cinnamon and baked in 2 load pans - I like my bread shorter. Baked at 325 for 40 minutes. So great! Thank you for sharing!

Very good, very dense.  Took advice and added the cinnamon and cloves with a little bit of chocolate chips!! yummy.  gone in 1 day.  I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream (it was what I had in fridge) and it worked out fine, and nobody knew!  will definitely make again.

I have made many banana bread loaves in my life and this is THE BEST, for sure! You gotta try this. I wrapped this while still warm in aluminum foil to retain the moistness.
Also, I added 2 TBL of vanilla, not 2 tsp. We love vanilla here!

I've made this twice now and it's perfect! I did make some changes though. First of all, I hate nuts so I left them out. I mashed the bananas ( like I do for banana chocolate chip muffins), I used 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, added a little extra vanilla, and added just enough cinnamon to give it a hint of cinnamon smell. I also used 3 banana, the first time it came out perfect, but the second time I think it was too much banana ( like it came out too moist, if that's even possible). So if you like bananas like I do, I'd suggest you use 2 1/2 bananas instead of 3.

This is great!!! very moist, it has replaced my origianl banana bread recipe.  I also agree mash the bananas.  Great with added extras, such as chocolate chips, nuts, craisins or just on it's own.  Always asked for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper!!!

I just took this out of the oven and have already had several "samples". This was my first attempt at banana nut bread and I am very impressed and pleased.  A few changes I made: used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, 2 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 cup pecans in lieu of the walnuts. I also mashed up the bananas and baked for 45 minutes. Per other reviews I had intended to add cinnamon but forgot so I just sprinkled some on top before I put it in the oven.  This is awesome and I'm sure the whole family will enjoy it.

This is a reallly good recipe and so easy.  I did not have the sour cream or walnuts but didn't miss them either.  I followed the recipe but next time would check the bread earlier as the 60mins seemed to cook it too long, it was a bit firm.  I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone.

I have tried other banana bread recipe, they turn out too dry. This one is just perfect! I reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup sugar, it has just enough sweetness for my family. I have already made 3 banana bread so far; every time it is gone the next day! Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

Great recipe! When I saw the bananas in the bread I thought it wasn't done. But I liked the bananas sliced. Made it more interesting and they tasted great sliced! This will be the banana bread recipe I always use.

This came out pretty good and I am giving it 4 stars because but I think it needs more than 2 bananas.  I am going to try it with 4 and see how it turns out.

What a good recipe, i made a few changes, instead of the butter I used organic apple sauce, instead of the 1cup of sugar I used 3/4 cup of agave (next time I will  try with 1/2 cup only as it is too sweet for my taste).  As per other reviewers i added 1 teaspoon each of vanilla and lemon juice.  I also added 2 tablespoons of Kefir and 2 tablespoons of flax seed meal (these 2 ingredients I add in all my baking).  Also for flower I used  organic spelt flour.  I did not add nuts, but i added chocolate chips for the mini muffins and dried cranberries  in the banana loaf.  Very  tasty

After reading several reviews about unpleasantly dark bananas that had been sliced, I mashed mine.  

My bananas were overripe(thus my search for a Banana Bread(BB) recipe) & I had 3 so I used them all.  Some pieces were a bit bigger, but have not changed color, yet(the bread is still hot, though with a couple of slices missing!)

I baked in a glass dish for about 75 minutes.  
No problem with overflow. 

To compensate for the extra banana, I added maybe a Tablespoon more of flour.  I also used more walnuts, and maybe 2 Tablespoons LESS sugar(to make up for the extra banana and the bananas being way ripe and super sweet) but I didn't change anything else.

It smelled amazing while baking.  I thought about tenting with foil the last 30 minutes, as mentioned by another reviewer, but there was no need--it came out just a touch darker only in the very corners, with the top being golden and perfectly cracked.

It was delicious, super moist.  Would be a little better if I hadn't used 3 bananas, but stuck with 2, like the recipe states, but still delicious!

The sour cream balances the sweetness and adds moisture.
I LOVED the vanilla in this recipe, as opposed to cinnamon like most BB recipes.  

This will be my BB recipe from now on!

***Update:  I made the bread a week ago & kept in tupperware on the counter for a couple of days, as we munched away.  After that, stuck it in fridge.  Just ate one of two remaining pieces(after a few minutes in toaster oven). Still delish & pretty!

This bread delivers, it was soo good! Just based on pantry limitations I only used 1/4 cup of butter, and 3/4 cup of sugar, and it's still very sweet and moist. I also added a dash of cinnamon as I was folding in the bananas, heavenly! This is my new BB Recipe.

This is a great recipe. I did not rate it 5 stars because of some changes I made to the original recipe. I used 1/2 cup nonfat plain greek yogurt instead of the sour cream, added 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips, sprinkled some sugar and cinnamon on the greased oaf pan, and mashed the bananas instead of slicing it. It needed an additional 10 minutes of baking time. Next time I will reduce the white sugar to 3/4 cup. My kids loved it. Very moist and delicious.

Fantastic. Best banana bread I've eaten. 
I cooked it for 55 minutes to prevent overcooking (high altitude - and the bread stuck to a toothpick a little at that time, but it finished cooking out of the oven). I did mash up the bananas rather than slicing (I actually thought that's what the recipe intended at first anyway). I also left out the chopped walnuts due to personal preference, but didn't change any of the other ingredients/measurements.

I originally rated this 4 stars but have upgraded to 5 stars. This recipe converted me into a banana bread fan. I used to make it for my husband just to get rid of overly ripe bananas. Now I actually look forward to having some myself as well as sharing with family and co-workers.

You haven't had banana bread until you've had this one! It's super moist and delicious! The only thing I did different was mash the bananas. It turned out perfect and I can't wait to make it again.

For 10+ years I've been baking banana bread.  Now I start a new tradition with a new recipe! This is excellent. Thank you!  I mashed my bananas and added mini choc chips.. Next time I'll try the grated carrots as another suggested!

I followed the recipe exactly except I mashed the bananas a bit with my hands before I threw them into the batter.  Tasty  bread but would add some cinnamon and nutmeg next time!

Great recipe, but if you use about 5 bananas and double the amount of sour cream it comes out so much better-much more moist!

WOW! I have made this 4 times in the last 1 1/2 weeks per the request of my family. I have substituted 1/2 cup grated carrots for the bananas and it also make a fantastic carrot/walnut bread. Awesome, never-fail recipe.

Phenomenal.  I followed the recipe, but mashed the bananas instead of slicing, as many reviewers called for.  I also think this recipe could stand a little cinnamon and spice, which I'll give a try next time.

This is it!  The banana bread recipe I've looked for my entire baking life!  This recipe produces a rich, moist and most flavorful banana bread.  As others have suggested I mashed the bananas before adding them to the mixture.  Definitely will use this recipe again and again.

Wow. Can I say delicious! I didn't have sour cream, so I used vanilla yogurt and whole milk and halved the vanilla extract instead. After much double checking, I put it into the oven, only to realize a half-hour later that I forgot the nuts! Oh well, it was still pretty good. I'm sure I'll be making this again.

Love this banana bread.  It is my new favourite to make.  Soon as I saw that it had sour cream, I knew it was the recipe to pick.  Sour cream in cakes and cookies make it so nice and moist!

I have tried two recipes of banana bread from this site and I have to say that this one is it!  This bread really is easy to make, and this coming from a guy who has never baked any cakes, bread, etc.  I followed the instructions for the most part, with the exception of using 3 bananas instead of 2, and I mashed them.  I also added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon as one person suggested.  The other recipe I had tried did not call for sour cream and I can see that adding sour cream makes a big difference in the texture of the bread - nice and moist.  Now I can't seem to stop making this. Thank you for sharing.

This is a delicious recipe and yields a very moist banana bread. Like others, I used mashed banana instead of sliced. I also used softened butter and my mixer to cream with the sugar instead of hand stirring it. Turned out great!

This was tasty!  I added 2 packets of chai tea latte mix, and mashed the potatoes.  It was sooo lovely, thanks for a great recipe!  I didn't give it 5 only because I didn't make it as-is :)

This is the best banana bread I've ever had! I made the recipe as written except I used 3 med banana's and 2 small mashed. (I love banana, so for me the more the better!) I split the batter between 4 mini loaves and baked for 35-40 minutes. Definatly a keeper recipe!

I agree with the all wonderful reviews this recipe has received. I did mash the bananas instead of slicing them. I also sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top before baking. I added pecans instead of walnuts - just because I prefer pecans in banana bread. The banana bread turned out very moist and tastes even better the second day. Thanks for sharing!

I was skeptical about the sour cream at first, I had never baked with sour cream. But I can tell you that this bread is fantastic!

This was the easiest bread that I have ever made - no need even to get out the mixer! I omitted the nuts and mashed the bananas but followed the recipe exactly apart from that, and it came out perfectly - moist and very popular in my house!  Will definitely make this again - in fact, I am now going to make this for my son's hospitality event at school!

If your store doesn't have really ripe bananas and you're in a hurry I've used strait banana baby food many times and it's wonderful for bread. I know sounds weird, but it's really great. I also toss in 1/2 tsp of banana flavoring to bump up the banana taste.

I couldn't find my regular recipe but tried this one b/c of the 5 star rating.  I omitted the nuts (allergy), and mashed the bananas and found the recipe tasty and moist.  I will make it again.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times.  The absolute ONLY thing I've changed is I mash my bananas, rather than slice them.  I have recieved many raving reviews with this recipe.  Make it exactly as it states, and you will not be disappointed!  Also, the timing (at least in my oven) is exactly 1 hour in stated pan.  This is a must try.    If you'd like to alternate in any way, add pecans instead of walnuts.  You can also add in chocolate chips.  Just delicious either way!

This banana bread is good. After it cooled, I spread it with cream cheese and some with butter.  The bread slices well and is moist but not too moist.

followed the tips from the first review, and everyone says it is the best banana bread they've ever tasted! Also I used half white, half brown sugar, and I greased then dusted the pan with cinnamon/sugar. Moist, but not wet and DELICIOUS!!!

Hands down the best banana bread I've had. This is the only recipe I will use. The first time I made it "as is" and decided that I prefer the bananas mashed. I usually omit the nuts only because my children don't care for them. This bread disappears FAST in this house!!

I mashed 3 bananas and added just a touch of cinnamon, but otherwise didn't change anything. This was the best banana bread. I made a couple of loaves, and even at almost a week old the second one was as moist and fresh as the first one was!

This was absolutely delicious. Followed the recipe (but mashed the bananas).  The sour cream makes it very moist; definitely my new go-to recipe!

I converted this to a GF (gluten free)  I am gluten intolerant.  The bread was one of the closest to "original" item that I have ever converted..and easily.  I had one banana getting too ripe and was looking for banana bread recipe I could adapt to one banana.  The sour cream was what drew me to it and it just happened to be a perfect one to half.  I used 2 mini loaf pans, baking for 40 minutes instead of 60 minutes.  Now for the gluten free flour blend.  I used 1/2 cup white rice flour, 1/4 cup potato starch and 3/4 teaspoon xanthum gum.  Full recipe measurements would be 1 cup white rice flour, 1/2 cup potato starch and 1 1/2 teaspoon xanthum gum.  I followed recipe exactly except  for the GF flour adaptation.  I used electric mixer for the whole process causing the sliced bananas to break into smaller segments which was perfect.  It was very thick dough; I had my doubts at first, but as I watched it rise and bake in oven, I knew it was a winner if the flavor was right.  My husband, who is not gluten intolerant, said it was best banana bread he had ever eaten.  Since there is just my husband and I, the 2 mini loaves worked great.  We had one to eat day of preparation and one to freeze for another time.  This is sure to become a regular taste treat in our home.  I can't rave enough about it.  Can't wait to share with my daughter whose husband has celiac disease and she and 2 of her 6 sons are gluten intolerant.  We are always on prowl for yummy GF foods.

Not only is this recipe extremely easy to prepare, but it's moist and delicious!  Here are my variations: 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt versus sour cream and I added a little cinnamon and ginger to the mix.  I also used chopped almonds instead of walnuts (I'm allergic), and used 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.  So tasty.

The BEST banana bread recipe ever.  I did use the variations from naples34102 which are very minor.  I only softened the butter, and then added a teaspoon each of baking soda and baking powder.  I also mixed together the bananas and sour cream before folding them into the batter.  I prefer to bake my banana bread in mini loaf pans and they took about 30 minutes to cook.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I used half brown sugar, half white and added a little cinnamon and a few chocolate chips.  Yum!
Each time I bake something I try to make it just a bit healthier and eventually find the balance where it is healthy and still tasty.  The second time I made this with 3/4 cup sugar (half brown, half white), used greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and substituted 1/2 cup of wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the white flour.  Again, I added a little cinnamon and dark chocolate chips.  It made 18 muffins baked for about 30 minutes.  Delicious!

Awesome bread! I was a little apprehensive since it didn't have any cinnamon or usual spices but this bread is so good we didn't even miss them! I followed the recipe as is except instead of 2 chopped bananas I added 3 mashed. I also doubled the recipe and baked in a tube pan at about 1 hour 20 min. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Just tasted my fresh loaf and it turned out great!  I did do some recommendations such as the smashing of the bananas, 1tsp of baking powder and 1tsp of lemon juice, used 1-3/4c of flour--of course in addition to the rest of the recipe.  I used "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter" and Splenda to make it a bit more healthy.  Although, I did use some chocolate  chips :/.  Easy recipe!

I just made this... and holy cow this is amazing.  I checked out other comments and did what a lot of people suggested, which was mash up the banana. So I did that rather than sliced.  The other change I made, is I used whole wheat flour rather than white flour.  It came out perfect. It is very dense, perfectly sweet bread. I think next time I might just try replacing white sugar with brown but that's it. Oh yeah, and I sprinkled even more walnuts on top of the bread right before baking... it looks nice that way and you can't get too many walnuts ^_^

A moist, flavorful banana bread.  I ran out of sour cream and compensated the remainder with Trader Joe's Vanilla Greek Yogurt.  I used about 2 cups of ripe bananas (mashed, not sliced as the recipe instructs), omitted the walnuts and added 1 tsp of baking powder.

This was great. I did cream the butter and sugar and used both baking soda and powder, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It froze well too.  I had baked it to serve a week later, so stuck in the freezer, but I can't wait to try it warm from the oven!

Great recipe! Mainly because my grandmother would make this same banana bread for us when we were little kids about 50 or so years ago. Grandmother would always have the butter at room temperature before she mixed it, and sometimes she would use chopped pecans instead of walnuts, and she would always mash the bananas first. This recipe was handed down though 3 generations of my mom's family, and  I've handed it down to my daughter and sons!

Very good. I did use 3 mashed bananas and 1/4 cup chocolate chips instead of the walnuts. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly and it turned out great.

I didn't have any walnuts on hand but it was delicious just the same! The sour cream made it so moist. I used 3 bananas instead of 2 only because I happened to have 3 over ripe bananas on hand and wanted to use them up. Next time I think I would still use 3 as I liked the real banana flavor I got from this loaf.

The absolute best banana bread I have EVER tasted. I'm no Martha Stewart, and just decided today that I wanted to bake banana bread as it is one of my favourite things to eat.. never, in a million years, did I expect it to be this good!  The crusts are perfectly sweet, crunchy and browned while the inside is moist, warm and delicious. An absolutely PERFECT recipe.

I followed the advise of the other reviewers and used 3 bananas pureed. Also took advise from Mom and floured the loaf pan after greasing it, the bread just falls out! Mom's been making banana bread for a long time and even she said it was delish.

This turned out excellent. I followed the recipe almost as written but left out the nuts. I cookied the bread longer about (10 more minutes) because I had to use smaller pans and was unsure how much I was supposed to put in per pan.

The best banana bread I have ever made!  It did take me an extra 10 minutes to bake.  I didn't bother leaving the bananas in pieces, I just threw it in the kitchen aid and mixed it up.  This is my new go-to recipe for banana bread.  Turns out very professional looking.

I thought this was good, but not that exciting.  It wasn't as moist as I had hoped either.  Maybe it's too dense for my taste?  I will keep trying other recipes.

This is excellent!  Everyone raved about it.  My husband took some to work and the guys said, the only problem with it was, I didn't make enough.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I've been looking for a good one for a long time.  I did take the advice of others and added more bananas and cinnamon.

Soooooooo good!  Used low fat sour cream, 1 cup mashed bananas, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp lemon juice.  Baked at 335 F for 55 min.  Best recipe I've found!

Awesome! If you like a moist and light bread, this is the recipe for you.  It is not dense like other breads I have made but oh so delicious.  I mashed the bananas instead of sliced per other recommendations.  This is a keeper!  I didn't change a thing.

Wonderful! Really nice and moist bread. I made a few changes just as Naples34102 suggested. I used 1 3/4 cup flour, 1 tsp of baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder and I used butter at room temperature (not melted). Thanks!

After making a few changes to suit personal taste this was an awesome recipe. I left out the walnuts and added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. pumpkin spice and a pinch of cloves. I also didn't have sour cream on hand so I added a 1/2 cup of FF yogurt instead. Following the advice of others I used 3 bananas instead of 2 and mashed them all. This was delicious, very simple to tweek to suite personal taste and super easy!

This banana bread was absolutely delicious!  I didn't melt the butter, just creamed it with sugar.  Mashed my bananas because they were very ripe.  My husband said it was GREAT....so moist unlike other banana breads.  You won't regret trying this recipe, that's for sure!!

My 10 year old daughter just made this and it turned out to be the most moist banana bread ever. I encouraged her to add an extra banana and that may have made a difference. Will use again!

If I could give this 10stars I would!! I used 1/2c of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of AP. I added 1/4tsp of cinnamon, decreased the salt to 1/4tsp to lower the sodium, and mashed the bananas. My husband said this was the best banana bread he has ever eaten. Amazing!

As everyone says, this is a great recipe. I also mash the bananas. I have made this a few times - this most recent time, I mashed ripe figs in with the bananas and then with 15 minutes left, i pressed some sliced figs into the top of the bread and drizzled with honey. It looks great!! I can't wait to eat it!

This is my new go-to recipe.  I don't melt the butter, just soften it and cream it with the sugar.  It comes out moist and flavorful every time.

Wow this was amazing!!!  I definitely left it in too long and the bottom burned, but it was still so good after I did some slicing. I will totally be giving this another try after some tweaking with the cook time.

I have tried a lot of recipes and I believe this one is he best.  If you make it with sliced bananas either slice it thin or half mash and half thinly slice them and you will get small nicely moist areas in your bread.  You can lessen fat content by substituting buttermilk or sour milk(1tsp vinegar + remaining 1/2 cup warmed milk) for sour cream and by using 1/4 cup applesauce + 1/4 cup butter instead of the full 1/2 cup butter.  This recipe has a great flavor and texture and with the given substitutions it doesn't taste like you are missing out on anything.

By far, the best banana bread recipe on this site! I also creamed the butter with the sugar, added 1 cup mashed bananas, touch of cinnamon and a touch of lemon juice. Certainly one of the most moist and flavourful banana breads I have ever made. As I have a convection oven, I adjusted the oven temp to 300 and baked for about an hour. Perfection!

Delicious! I added 4 mashed rotten bananas (I keep them frozen in my freezer for months after they turn black). To cut down on the calories I used 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar, used light sour cream, cut down the butter by 2 tablespoons and added 2 tablespoons of apple butter and 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. Overall, I got an incredibly tasty and moist banana bread recipe which I intend to use for ages! Yum.

Amazing! This was the best banana bread i have ever eaten. It did take a while to cook, but it was worth the wait. Instead of slicing the bananas, i mashed them. It made the loaf more flavorful! I added 1/8 of a teaspoon of cinnamon, and it really added to the taste. If you think you will try this recipe make sure you include the baking soda, salt, and all purpose flour. Self-rising flour just makes it heavy and flat. Trust me! Two thumbs up!

Very moist but held form nicely.  Has a nice brown crust.  I blended the bananas in with the wet ingredients before I added the flour.  No sticky banana chunks in my bread!  :)  This is one that will slice nicely for a brunch or buffet...

Best recipe for banana bread I have ever made! I modified some things as suggest by others.  Use smashed bananas. use at least 1 cp smashed ripe bananas. cream butter at room temp. with vanilla.  add 1 tsp lemmon juice in with vanilla. use 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder. use 1 3/4 cp flour.  Always keep checking with a tooth pick toward the end  and bake until it comes out clean in the middle.  Perfection!!!!

I make this anytime there are bananas around, my family love this bread.  I use plain lowfat greek yogurt in place of sour cream, and 1/2 cup sugar.

I use this recipe all the time for banana bread or muffins. I halve the butter and sugar, use FF sour cream, whole wheat flour instead of AP, add 1 tsp baking powder, reduce baking soda to 1/2 tsp, dash of cinnamon and use 3 bananas. I do mash the bananas as my son has texture issues and the slices weren't palatable for him. If I make a large loaf I reduce the baking temp to 325 so it doesn't brown so fast, usually takes 75 minutes for large loaf, 25 minutes for muffins and 18 minutes for mini muffins.
I also omit the nuts and substitute 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips.

Delicious! I used 3/4 c. white sugar, 1/4 c. brown, and used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. It turned out so moist!

This is such a good and moist recipe for banana bread.    I took out the nuts, no one in my family likes them, and we didn't miss it at all.  Thank you for providing this recipe.

Excellent!  I used the Pampered Chef mini pans and cooked at 325 for approximately 40-45 minutes.  I kept checking starting at 30 because I wasn't sure how long to cook.  I also mashed the bananas and used 4 which was about 1 1/2 cups.

This banana bread is so freaking delicious and moist!  I used very riped sliced banana (they distrubted nicely when mixed in kitchenaid mixer) for the recipes.  Great recipe! Will make again and again.

This bread turned out GREAT!  I made some changes.  I didn't add walnuts.  I added a third banana in place of the sour cream and it stayed nice and moist and rich.  I came up 1/4 cup short of all purpose flour so I added Quinoa flour (ground Quinoa grain).  The bread was SO yummy and the Quinoa flour made it higher in protein!

As promised this is a moist and delicious bread. I doubled the recipe, upped the banana to 6 medium, mashed them & decreased sugar to 1 1/2 cups total. I combined 1 T each sugar and cinnamon which I sprinkled in loaf pans after greasing, then tossed the remainder into the batter.  Very, very good! Thanks Vjonsson!

Delicious! I made it with mashed bananas based on reviews and had to replace the sour cream with fat free greek yogurt, but it was still very moist. I think it'd be great with blueberries or chocolate chips.

This Banana bread recipe is one of the best I have ever used.  I made several loves to give to fellow employees at work.  One person now keeps bringing me bananas to to make more.  I do like the idea that the liquid used is mostly Bananas.

This is my go-to banana bread recipe. I love it! I do mash my bananas thoroughly, though, and I also dust the pan and top of the batter with a mix of cinnamon and sugar to give it a tasty crust.

This is the best banana bread I have ever made. I made it early in the week because I had some overripe bananas I needed to use. I made the bread exactly as written with one exception, I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them (my personal preference), let it cool and then wrapped well and placed it in the freezer until the weekend. It is the most moist and flavorful banana bread I have ever eaten. The texture was wonderful and it froze very well. My new favorite banana bread recipe. Thank you!

LOVED this recipe!  I recently moved and so my tried-and-true recipes (you know, the one's you're famous for) were all in storage :(  I came to AR looking for a backup and was bummed about it.  But, I was NOT bummed with how this turned out!  I doubled the recipe and made 3 medium loafs.  They weren't super sweet (I don't like super sweet BNB) and were super moist!  My bananas were already way too brown and since they were a more liquidy, I did have to let these bake for an extra 15mins.  The first loaf was eaten at a dinner, the second went to a friend and the 3rd got devoured at work :)

I didn't read the other reviews before making this, but I did mash up very ripe bananas only because I thought that's how it's always done.  Fabulous bread it came fantastic.  Loved it.

This was a really good base ... I took the advice of some of the other reviewers ... I like my banana bread to have more of a banana-y taste and less dense.  Do I added an extra banana and more flour to balance it out ... however, with all of that added I think it needs more sweetness too.  Next time I'll still add the extra banana & flour but add more sugar and vanilla.  Still gave it 5 stars since I'm sure it was fine without the alterations since everything else was great.

Very good! I had neither sour cream nor yogurt, so I chose to use cottage cheese (I'm normally not this creative!) instead of the sour cream and it turned out WELL!  Thanks for sharing, Janet!

This is an awesome banana bread, my boyfriend says its as good as his grandmas! (probably better in my opinion but he can't say that)   The only problem is that it's made with so much butter! Not good for the health conscious. I substitute with apple sauce sometimes.

This is great banana bread. It's moist and has a great consistancy. I followed the recipe except for I mashed the bananas before I put them in. I also added a few shakes of cin. and made it with I cant beleive its not butter and low fat sour cream. Its a great use for older bananas!

I can't believe I hadn't tried a recipe with sour cream before, what a difference! Instead of slicing my bananas I sort of half mashed them so there were still some chunks, the flavor still came out great. I also had half a banana sitting in my fridge so I just added it to the 2 bananas to get rid of it. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T. Wonderfully delicious and lower in calories and fat than my other banana bread recipes!

Sooo delicious!  Note to self: run a knife along the outer edge before tipping over to release.  I only softened the butter, and I did use a mixer.

This is my new favorite banana bread recipe - very moist and flavorful. My roommate agrees :) Like most reviewers, I used 1 cup mashed bananas, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as given. I keep it in the refrigerator and eat it toasted with a little bit of butter for breakfast.

This is the best banana bread recipe that I have found... very moist and everybody in my family loves it !! My son loves banana bread so he had this in place of a birthday cake this year. 
 The only changes I make is to use softened butter instead of melted and I mash most of the bananas instead of slicing them.

I am a novice in the kitchen, but this bread was a first time hit!  I tried three others and this is the moistest.  I like that the bananas are sliced because you can really taste them in the bread.  Delicious and easy!!

This recipe is perfect the way it is.  The only thing I did was mash the bananas instead of slice them.  I doubled the recipe and ran out of loaf pans so I used an 8 inch cake pan, came out fine in that too.  Would make a great banana cake with some glaze!

I thought this was quite good, even with the substitutions I made to account for not having sour cream on hand (I used yogurt instead).  I tried the reviewers suggestions and mashed the bananas, added 1 tsp lemon juice to the vanilla extract, added 1 tsp baking powder to the baking soda, and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the salt.  It was quite tasty.

I followed directions exactly as written even though many said it needed more bananas. The texture was very moist but it was not sweet enough and did not have enough banana flavor. So three bananas may make it sweeter, or possibly more sugar as well. I found another recipe on here that called for 3 bananas and 3/4 sugar and will be trying that one.

I love the recipe. I changed it up a bit though. Instead of adding sour cream I used yogurt. I also didn't use bananas. I added some orange zest and a little extra vannila.

Oh my this was the best banana nut bread that I have ever tasted much less made. I did make a mistake and used 1 cup melted butter instead of 1/2 ( I miss read this :) )but it turned out perfect and very moist! I might just make that mistake again!

Good recipe. I only changed two things, first I mashed the bananas.  The other thing I did different was use cinnamon applesauce instead of sour cream.  I tried it with the sour cream for the first loaf and it was good, I only used the applesauce because I didn't have enough  for the second.  Both were moist.

Absolutely delicious!  I did mash the bananas and I used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream (was out of it).  My husband is so picky about banana bread and he tells me it was the best he's had.  Thanks for a keeper!

For a really moist bread I steamed this bread, like a pudding or Boston Brown bread. I placed the dough in two sauce pots and placed them in a water bath a simmered for two hours. Also made sure the slices of bananna were 1/8th thick. This turned out fabulous

truly, very moist.  However, the flavor was lacking.  I used splenda instead of sugar and low fat sour cream, which could have contributed to the taste change.  However, I usually change all of my baking to low fat and low sugar without any problems.  The banana flavor is ok.  I used 1 large and 2 medium mashed very ripe bananas.  I will still be on the lookout for another banana bread recipe.

amazing. I made it for my wife on V-Day, and she loves it! I changed a couple things as it is a little too rich as is. Added only 1/3 cup butter and topped to 1/2 with water, then added only 3/4 cup sugar. Then added 1/3 cup chocolate chips, 1/3 cup crushed Pecans, and 1.5 sliced bananas. It is one of the best cakes I have ever made.  thanks!

really moist.  i only had one banana and a couple tbsp chopped walnuts.  and it was still really good.  more of a sweet bread with a hint of banana.  loved it.  easy and delicious.  i also liked slicing the bananas, instead of mashing.  mmmmm.

so so good! i did make a couple changes though, i ran out of white flour, ended up using 1 cup white and 1/2 cup whole wheat. It tasted great and makes a little healthier so i'm going to make this change every time. I also used margarine (didn't have butter) and didn't melt it, just blended it with the sugar until it was fluffy. I just mashed the banana instead of slicing and it was great! I'll always make this recipe from now on!

This is a good recipe. I used yogurt instead of sour cream and added a tsp of cinnamon. I'm still looking for a really WOW banana bread though. I'll read through the reviews and see if other people felt blown away by this- and if they had to tweak anything to reach that state. But it was good. Thanks for the recipe!

i used the suggestions. so, really it's a different recipe: room temp butter, not melted. mashed bananas, not sliced. 1 tsp bkg pdr, 1 tsp bkg soda. 1 3/4 c flour. with these changes it's perfect.

This is good - definitely rich tasting.  But why not spices?  I think some cinnamon and nutmeg would really improve a good thing and make it 5 stars.

I made this today and it is absolutely wonderful.  The sour cream gives this loaf a nice depth of flavor and compliments the bananas very well.  It was so moist; I had some cream cheese out to spread on it but didn't even want it!  I ate the first piece - the end piece which I usually don't.  Even the sides and top were delicious.  The butter makes it crispy and crunchy without being dry.  Be sure not to use margarine, the crispy texture makes it even better.   Thanks Janet, this one is truely a keeper!

This ia a great recipie. Instead of slicing the bananas I heated them in the microwave for about 90 sec, smashed them until they were really mushy and then added them. It made the mixture alot easier to pour also. I made two loaves, one regular and one with 1/2c of mini choc chips! It was a hit!!!! Thank you

When I made this recipe I made a few modification. I used soften butter and added some spices and more vanilla and added baking powder. I don't know if the modification I made messed with the chemistry of it but I found that it fell in the middle of baking and it comes out with a moist center but very crusty on the outside. It is pretty good but there are other recipes for banana bread that I like better.

I thought this banana bread was great! Moist and delicious. However I could have used less salt. I made it a second time and reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp and I used half brown sugar and half white sugar. Even better! This is the recipe I will be using from now on!

I'm giving this 5 stars - the flavor is just wonderful.   I had a problem with the loaf sticking to the bottom of the pan, but I think that was my error.  Also the center of the bread wasn't cooked all the way - after my toothpick came out clean - but I think this too was my oven's fault, not the recipe.  I plan to make this again as my husband and son are enjoying eating even the once-stuck-on-the-bottom-pieces!

Recipe turned out great even after I had to substitue a few ingredients.  I didn't have sour cream so I added 1/4 of water before folding in the bananas.  I also didn't have enough butter so I added enough vegetable oil to make 1/2 cup.  I also used half brown sugar and half white then added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and baked in a muffin pan for about 20 mins.  Very moist!

Moist and tasty - I followed the recipe pretty much exactly except I mashed the bananas.  I feel that it could have used some cinnamon or other spices.

Follow the recipe exactly!  You can use light sour cream but don't try it with fat free.  You'll be guaranteed a moist, sweet bread if you follow instructions!

I've made this twice in two days and besides mashing the bananas instead of slicing I wouldn't change a thing!  It is one of the BEST banana bread recipes I've ever tried.  It's easy to mix up and nearly foolproof.  I baked mine for about an hour and 10 minutes at 350.  My daughter and her friends (13 year olds) raved over it.

I followed the recipe exactly and the bread did not come out good. About 40 minutes into baking I was worried because it looked done on the outside but the middle was still undone. I let it cook for the remaining 20 minutes and the middle was just finished cooking but the oustide was overcooked. It has a burnt taste and not the best banana bread  I have ever tasted. I don't think I did anything wrong but everyone seems to have great results so I may try it again.

i was a little weary about trying a banana bread with sour cream.. sounds like a really odd mix.. but aside from adding a teaspoon of baking powder i followed the recipe exatcly as written... it turned out VERY VERY moist and tasty. I have searched and tried many banana bread recipes  looking for the best and most moist bread and i feel that i have to look no further!! usually i have to let the breads rest for a day to get it nice and moist, but by the evening i baked it, it was MOIST and VERY tasty! i don't even need any butter (although im sure it would be good with some) and it doesnt taste sour creamy at all.. LOVE this recipe and defiantly adding it to the keepers log!

This is a great recipe – so moist and flavorful.  It had the right amount of sweetness, and the sour cream added a nice richness to the bread.  I doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves.  To my horror, I realized I had only 1 egg left in my fridge, so I reached for a carton of liquid egg whites and used  3/4 cup to replace the 3 extra  eggs I needed.  It worked out beautifully.   I mashed and used 5 large bananas.   My bread took a bit longer, about 70 minutes.  I will definitely make this again – I may substitute splenda for white sugar next time.

This was a good banana bread, but it wasn't the best I'd ever had. Slicing the banana's is a big no no. Make sure to smash them and smashed it should equal a cup. This also seemed better after a day or two. It seemed to get more moist. Overall it was good, but I would have rather it been a little sweeter and the banana's to be better distibuted throughout the bread (which would have happened had I mashed them). This is just my opinion. This might be the perfect bread for you just how it is. Don't be afraid to experiment!

Yummy recipe. Lovely and moist! I used french vanilla yoghurt instead of sour cream and added a good shake of pumpkin spice. I also used about 1/2 a banana extra... i smush them while they are in their skins and then then use a fork to smush them a bit more while taking them out of their skins to mix in batter. Will be making this again soon!!

This is awesome banana bread!! My husband loves it. He couldn't get enough. I did make a few minor changes. I used 3 bananas instead of 2 and also after 55 minutes in the oven I took out the loaf and spread butter all on the top and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on it. I then continued to cook for about 5-7 minutes. This added a little something extra. Very yummy:)

AMAZING!!!  Very delicious.  I did 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 plain yogurt and did up the bananas to 3.  I also added 1 t cinnamon.  I made a triple batch.  It gave me a 9x5, 2 of the ones slightly smaller (what are they--8-1/2 x 4-1/2?), and 2 miniloaves.      The kitchen smells great!

Amazing, Delicious, Awesome!!!  Those are the words I received as responses from my neighbors.  I baked loafs as christmas gifts to our neighbors from our family and received so much positive feedback.  I baked a few as muffins for my kids and they too enjoyed them.  I do have to confess that I did not fully melt the butter and used room temperature and put it in the microwave for about 30 seconds after I added the sugar and mixed it some more.  I also added cinnamon  and Nutmeg.  It was very delicious.    Thank you, I am adding this to my personal recipe book to pass down to my kids when they reach that point of their lives.  Thank you for Sharing!!!!

This is the most amazing banana bread I have ever tasted; I think it's the sour cream that makes it so moist & tasty.  However, I leave out the nuts and mash up the bananas.  Either way, it's amazing!

I substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of granulated white sugar for the full cup of white sugar (as I find this gives sweet breads more color and flavor) but in this recipe, I was surprised to find that it made the bread too dark and heavy. I would stick to the recipe as is. It yields a wonderfully rich and moist banana bread that is hands down the best I've ever made!

This was delicious.  I followed the recipe as given but made some minor changes.  1) I substitued the sour cream with strawberry/banana yogurt 2) I omitted the walnuts (I don't like walnuts) and 3) I baked it at 325 for about 50 mins.  The bread came out wonderful and the entire family scarfed it down.

This is a terrific recipe!  First time I made exactly as written and it was a huge hit with the family.  Second and subsequent times I added another half of a banana and substituted pecans for the walnuts and they went even MORE nuts for it :) Love it!

I recommend slicing the bananas instead of mashing, as said in previous comments… The sliced bananas gave an odd texture as expected…

Great!  Made exactly as called for.  I've not cooked with sour cream in baked goods so that was an interesting ingredient.  Moist and delicious.  Would definitely use this recipe again.

Yummi!!!! I've never made banana bread before, after this one I'll be making it over and over again. The changes i made were because I didn't wanted to go to the store and used what i had. I used baking powder instead of baking soda (double the amount), also used plain yogurth instead of sour cream and mashed the bananas. Awsome taste and very moist... Hubby said it deserved five stars.

Absolutely delicious!  This is my first attempt at banana bread and I am thankful to have found this one.  I used room temp margarine instead of melted butter and baked in a 9" square pan for 30 minutes.  TRY THIS RECIPE, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!

I made this recipe as written except that I mashed the bananas and used pecans instead of walnuts (a personal preference).  It is absolutely wonderful!  My whole family loved it.  It will be my go to banana bread recipe from now on.

This bread is indeed great.  I followed other suggestions and mashed the bananas.  The only changes I made were: 1/2 cup brown sugar and  1/2 white cup sugar, instead of 1 cup sugar.  Added 1/4 cup Heath toffee bits  which complemented the bananas, and increased the walnuts to one cup.  I will definately use this recipe again and again.

I substituted 3/4 cup honey for the sugar to make it healthier, increased flour by 1/2 cup due to added liquids, and used vanilla non fat yogurt. I mashed  3 bananas and left 5 minutes more in oven Result: I wouldn't recommend these alterations.  It was dry, crumbly and dark.  Little banana flavor detected.  I think the problem was the honey substitute.  I'm not an experienced baker.

DELICIOUS! I did a couple modifications - used margarine, and I had to melt it a little due to time constraints. I also added 1 tsp lemon juice to the vanilla (couldn't taste it though). I used peach yogurt instead of sour cream (it's what I had), used 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, and added 1 tsp baking powder, with no nuts - and mashed the bananas. Turned out GREAT!

This is by far the best banana bread i have both tasted and produced. All though I mashed the bananas as was suggested in a couple of reviews. This recipe deserves it's place in my best recipe book.

This is a great banana bread recipe. Delicious, moist and recipe was easy to follow. However, maybe it's my oven (7 yrs old) but when baked at 350, the bottom of bread was still not fully cooked, but deep brown on the outside. I may have to lower oven temp and bake for 60 minutes. Adding chopped bananas definitely helped the bread have a concentrated banana taste (just how I like it).

Love the simplicity of this recipe and the fact it is absolutely moist and delicious. Only changes I made was using 3 large bananas that I whipped with mixer and being a little more generous with the vanilla. Was great baked in muffin tins with choc. chips!  Will use recipe again and again.

VERY DELICIOUS! Nice and moist. Like others have said, I mashed my bananas. However, I think I will try slicing them next time because I'm never able to get that distinct banana taste. Will review again later.

I didn't have sour cream so I used half milk and half water. Still came out quite moist! I also added chocolate chips and they were delicious! I would recommend mashing the bananas. I didn't have walnuts so I chopped almonds with a knife and sprinkled them on top which worked well.

Yum!  I made 12 mini-muffins (for the toddler) and a loaf out of this recipe.  Very moist with a tad of crust on the outside.  I did mash/mix the bananas into the batter.  I also substituted one of the eggs for flaxseed.  Very pleased with the end result.  Thanks.

Made this with substitutions so it was a more healthful bread (egg sub, butter sub, fat free sour cream), but it was still delicious!  Sticky, sweet crust, moist on the inside.  Yum!

Amazing! Even my overly picky mother loved it, and that's saying a lot!  Mash the bananas forsure, I just threw them in the stand up mixer before adding the dry ingriedients.  Overmixing didn't seem to ruin this recipe like it does other banana bread recipes for some reason???  I baked mine in a silicone bundt pan for easier slicing and presentation.  YUMMMMMMMMM

This is my go-to Banana Bread.  I have never found a more moist bread, and it makes excellent muffins as well.  I do, like most others, mash my bananas instead of slicing them.

Have tried at least 6 other banana bread recipes in searching for the perfect one - and this is a keeper!   So moist and delicious.   Adding 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips was a nice touch.

I made this the first time and couldn't stop eating it.  It is so moist and delicious... seriously the best I have ever had. The second time I made it, I added a streusel topping before baking and it was even more delicious! This recipe will be in my recipe collection FOREVER!

Can you call bread beautiful?  This was amazing....  I think my family is going to boycott eating fresh bananas so that they will get overly ripe so that I will have to make this again.  I read the review and compromised on the mashed/chopped issue.  I mashed 2 bananas, and quartered(lenghtwise) and finely chopped the last banana.  I was out of sour cream, but somehow had cream, so I added vinegar to turn it into sour cream.  I had some problems getting it out of the pan--I greased with butter.

Dang it, that's good!  Sliced bananas as instructed, but folding them into the mixture squished them a bit.  Had a slice straight out of the pan with butter - yum, but this morning I had a toasted slice with honey nut cream cheese... Yummm!

THis was a great recipe and we truly enjoyed it. I made a few changes to suit our palette which was to add 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. cloves. We also mashed 3 bananas instead of the 2 since we do not like chunky bananas in our bread and prefer a stronger banana flavor. I think that if your bananas are smaller you could even do 4.  I think that next time we will add more nuts but other than that it was so yummy!!

This banana bread is super yummy! I've been trying different recipes and this one definitely beats them all!  I whipped the butter and sugar on high for 2minutes and added 1tsp of baking powder. It made the recipe turn out  moist, fluffy, and light. I also added enough bananas to equal one cup and mashed them and used pecans instead of walnuts simply because i like the taste of pecans better than walnuts.  This was super delicious.. everyone should have it at least once in their lifetime!

This really is an awesome recipe. I am no betty crocker and the bread turned out wonderful. I followed it for the most part but I used 4 or 5  bananas because I had several that were really ripe and I didn't want to throw them away. I had some left over batter because of the many bananas so the extra I put some semisweet chocolate chips and scooped into a muffin pan which I also baked at 350 but for only about 30 min and those turned out great too. Suprisingly, neither turned out too gooey. Both were perfect!

My roommate LOOOVES banana bread!  I tried to make it about a month ago for her birthday using another recipe, and it turned out like banan pudding with a crust - mainly my fault, though.  I found this one by looking at top rated banana bread recipes and thought the sour cream idea sounded pretty clever.  Tried it and OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS!  I baked it last night, and just tried my first piece this morning, after I noticed  half was already gone!  She LOVED it!  I LOVED it!  Absolutely Wonderful! I did use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour.  Can't tell at all and it doesn't feel as bad when I go back for seconds, and thirds. :]

DELICIOUS! this bread tastes fantastic, great texture, and very easy; made with ingredients readily on hand.    only changes: added a teaspoon of cinnamon, used whole wheat flour, and sprinkled oats on top for a bit of a crunch  thanks!

WOW!! So happy with the way this recipe came out! I made a banana bread for me and my boyfriend the other night that had me creaming the sugar and butter together and it turned out firm, nice flavor but not the greatest. I LOVED THIS PROCESS. I loved melting the butter and adding the sugar. the last step is what puts it over the top, the folding in of the sour cream, banana and pecans! (I subbed the walnuts for pecans). I mashed the bananas in the sour cream and added pecans and choc chips and folded that into the sugar egg and flour mixture.   I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS. Plus, it makes the house smell great.

Typically, banana bread is made with very ripe bananas, and mashed.  The rating for this bread is no exaggeration!  Its so moist and flavorful; something you would expect for desert at a high class restaurant.

Wow I have to say this banana break isn't the healthiest (a stick of butter?!?) but it is sooooooo delicious!!!!  The only changes I made based on recommendations was to cream the butter and sugar together instead of melt the butter.  I don't know if this actually makes any kind of difference, but per standard baking rules, it seemed appropriate.  I also mashed the banana and did use my mixer to blend everything instead of folding it in to help develop the gluten a tiny bit.  My family has eaten just about the entire thing in one day, and this includes a picky 3 year old!  Yummy!!!!

My new favorite recipe!  I didn't have a loaf pan, but a 8x8 worked just great.  I mashed the bananas first, though, rather than slicing.  Try adding a handful of chocolate chips to a recipe - decadent and delicious!

Delicious bread. My bread was done at 58 minutes. I used butterscotch in place of the nuts. I also mashed the bananas first because that's what we prefer.

Turned out perfectly.  I added cinnimon and a touch of nutmeg.  And I definately mashed the bananas instead of slicing them.  (I imagine that depends on the desired texture of those who will consume.)  There's no way my husband would eat this if there were "chunks" of banana in it.  It was very moist and was fabulous for 3 days.

Great results! Use full fat sour cream for a moist loaf. If you use a glass dish consider letting it sit for well over 10mins before removing from pan. Cinnamon is a great addition.

The most moist/best banana bread I've ever had. Threw away all other banana bread recipes. On a scale of 1-10 this is a 15. May add some tiny chocolate chips to the next one.

This was great!  I changed a bit by putting in Cream Cheese instead of sour cream beacause that is all I had. Also I added a Tea spoon of Banana flavoring.  This was so moist and hard not to eat a whole loaf by yourself.

This recipe made an excellent loaf of banana bread. I did make a few adjustments - added a bit of cinnamon and ginger and some lemon juice as well. Also mashed the bananas instead of slicing, which just sounds gross. Sprinkled the top with cinnamon mix from Pampered Chef. It did taste better after it had time to "rest." I couldn't resist trying a piece of it warm out of the oven, but it was better the next morning. I would have rated it 5 stars if I hadn't had to make all the adjustments to the original recipe. Overall, a keeper. Will definitely be making this one again.

I've made many banana bread recipes but this is my all-time favorite! I've probably made this recipe 10 times in the last 6 months.  I mash the bananas and will substitute the sour cream for yogurt or buttermilk (less) if I'm out.

This is the best banana recipe I've been looking for. The finished product was moist and a little crunchy because of the sliced banana. I used three ripe "saba" banana. I mashed the half and half was sliced in a small cube. I added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. I don't have sour cream, so instead I used fresh milk with 1 tbsp.of lime. It taste great! I will definitely bake it again.

Holy cow this was good!!!! I had 3 bananas that needed to be used, so I decided upon this recipe! I altered the recipe by using as stated above 3 bananas instead of two, I sifted the dry ingredients, added pecans and chocolate chips, then sprinkled a cinamon sugar mixture on the bread loaf pan, then sprinkled the same mixture on top after I put the batter in. Baked for one hour and AMAZING!!!

If you wanna cream the butter and sugar - cream them, if you like your bananas mashed vs. sliced - mash them. Either way this is an excellent recipe that you can adjust to your personal preferences - Martha, Janet, whoever - thanks for a great banana bread!!! My family LOVED this...

This is excellent!  The only change I made was to add some cinnamon suger to the top.  We gobbled this up in an afternoon and I making another batch as I type this review.  Very easy, quick and yummy!

This recipe won over my boyfriend's pre-teen daughter, who hadn't met me but decided she wouldn't like me. I left a batch of this and she asked her dad if she could text me to ask about the recipe -- and now we're kitchen buddies!

I used my kitchenaid mixer for the butter and sugar and mashed the bananas as others suggested. I added both cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and a cinnamon sugar mixture to the top before baking. Definitely yummy!

YUM!  I followed the recipe except for a couple minor things: I mashed the banana and used slightly more than one cup, I added a handful of chocolate chips because it's what my boyfriend likes, and I used fat free sour cream.  I baked for the hour at 350 just like the recipe calls for and it came out moist and delicious!  All I keep hearing from the kitchen is that "this bread is sooo good!"

This banana bread was delicious and moist!  I left out the nuts (or else my daughter wouldn't eat it) and mashed (not sliced) three bananas instead of two.  It was a hit with the whole family!  Can't wait to have overripe bananas to use up again!

This was a decent bread recipe, but nothing too special.  I wish it would have been a little more dense and had just a bit more banana flavor (I used 2 medium-large overripe bananas).  I made 2 loaves & topped the 2nd with the banana crumb muffin topping (found on this site)& it helped out the bread.  However, I think I will still stick with my mom's bread recipe.

This is by far the best banana nut bread I've ever had.  Really moist.  I also mashed the bananas instead of slicing them.  My family raved over this recipe.  I sprinkled cinnamon in the bottom of the loaf pan, as another reviewer suggested, and it made it perfect !

This banana bread is wonderfully moist. It is hands down the best banana bread I have ever eaten. I did follow a few reviewers suggestions by mashing up the bananas first and cutting the white sugar down by a handful and adding a handful of brown sugar. This is a must try!!!!!

This was a great recipe for banana bread! I didn't have walnuts or vanilla extract on hand, so I omitted the walnuts and added cinnamon in place of the vanilla extract. Good result - my loaf pan was a bit smaller than 9x5, so my banana bread ended up darker on the outside but so far, its a hit! We'll see how long it lasts once my roommates get home!

This recipe is just about perfect just the way it is presented. I added more walnuts than called for, almost a full cup, as that's my personal taste. I also like chocolate chips in my banana bread, but I couldn't talk my mother into it!

Great banana bread recipe!  Very easy to just be able to mix everything together.  I did mash the bananas instead of slicing and omitted the nuts as I don't like them.

Great banana bread, good texture and flavor. Have made several times. Made as written-softened butter and mashed 3 bananas. Used pecans in place if walnuts. 
Have also made as muffins with dark choc chips, were awesome. Made 12 good sized muffins (filled the cups almost full). Baked 20 min 335 convection.

I tried the slices, liked it ok, but the 2nd time I made it I mashed it and it was better texture wise. Also, I used fat free banana cream yogurt the first time, and sour cream the second time. I think that the yogurt gave a better taste/texture/moistness.

This is absolutely delicious and disappeared in less than 48 hours.  Everyone was upset when they realized it was all gone already!  The only comment I have is that I had to bake it for over 70 minutes and it still was not quite as done as it should have been.  My oven is usually pretty accurate, too.  Anyway, this is my new staple banana bread.  Thanks for sharing!

The sour cream puts this over the top! Delicious and moist. I followed the directions exactly, omitted the nuts, and baked on 325 for 1.5 hours. I can't get enough of it- in fact I'm eating some while I'm typing this review! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This was very good. I used a little smashed banana (don't like the solid or semi-solid consistency) I also did not use nuts.  I think having nuts would enhance.

This banana bread was good. It was moist and the sliced bananas added a "different" aspect, which my husband loved. This is his favorite because of the sliced bananas. Will be making again and again! GF of course!!

This banana bread is so delicious and moist.  However, I did mash the bananas rather than slice them.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg and I omitted the walnuts.  This will be my regular banana bread recipe from now on (but with mashed bananas, not sliced).

This is a very good banana bread...very moist. The only thing I did differently was mash the bananas rather than slicing them...I like the consistency better. Also, it only took me 45 mins. to bake until it was done! Wonderful!

This is the best Nana bread I have ever made.  Great recipe. I didn't add or subtract anything from the recipe.  I do agree that the sliced bananas turn purple, but they still taste good.  Next time I will try mashing them.  My grandkids love this bread any old way I make it.

Believe it or not, but have made this five times since Thursday and its only Sunday!!  First time, made as directed EXCEPT no chopping of bananas, mashed is our preference.. tried leaving a few large chunks but as someone mentioned they kind of turn a weird color and don't really make it better, just weirder.  The second time I made it I ran out of sour cream and used same amount *1/2 cup* of vanilla yogurt.  My husband went crazy over the first one, but he went ape poop over the rest of them.  He's had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner AND dessert.  Not too sweet, very moist and GREAT flavor.  Haven't tried more bananas yet, don't want to mess with perfection!
Thanks!

Absolutely yummy. I made it twice, first time it almost burned in the loaf pan but the middle was runny. The second time I used a smaller loaf pan and it ran all over the oven, but the stuff still in the loaf pan was delicious. I'm going to buy a different loaf pan. Took it to work and someone begged for it to take home. Wonderful...thank you.

Excellent recipe.  I liked it very much.  My friend thought it had too much baking soda.  To make it less guilty, I used whole wheat flour, splenda instead of sugar and like a few of the other reviewers, I too used banana yogurt instead of the sour cream. 
Thanks for this recipe; will use again

Great recipe! I use it every time I have some old bananas. Sometimes I substitute the sour cream with banana yogurt. I'll add chocolate chips, peanut butter and even crushed banana nut Cherrios! It always turns out great!

I would reduce the sugar a little and not add the salt.  Also, my bread burned on the outside but I had to keep it in for a little longer because the middle was not done.  The taste was good though.

I'd give this 5 stars for ease in making but 3 for texture (as compared to my previous banana bread experiences).  I had all of the ingredients on hand and used pecans instead of walnuts and applesauce instead of butter.  I found the texture to be kind of spongy, not as soft as I would have liked; the flavor is very good though.  I made 3 wee loaves and they took 35 minutes in the oven and 10 on the baking sheet.  thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except I mashed the bananas as others had. Love the crust outside and moistness inside. Great banana bread. My bread was perfectly baked in 45 minutes @ 350 degrees. Highly recommend this recipe.

Absolutely the best!  My mom and I substituted pecans (this was the only nut in the cupboard that day) and it was excellent, that was the only change.  Since we didn't modify it at all, and it was sooo good we gave it the 5 star rating.  Bake on!

The only thing I would have done differently is mash the bananas. The sliced pieces turned purple and gooey, which didn't look very appetizing.
Other then that, it was delicious!
Update 8/20/08- mashed the bananas and it was a lot better.

Best Banana Bread!!! So good that we had to improvise! We started making Janet's Rich Banana Muffins...It was easier to "grab and go"! What a hit! Use a cookie/batter scoop, spray Jumbo baking cups and fill them about two-thirds full. *Keep banana slices chunky and mix up the nuts with 1/2 pecans and 1/2 walnuts.*
Last but not least...cut 1 tbsp butter
with 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2 tbsps flour and 1/8th tsp cinnamon. Sprinkle over muffins before baking. Only needs 25 minutes to bake at 375 degrees.

Have made this several different ways (including exactly as written) all delish!  My kids love them best as mini muffins with a few chocolate chips thrown in - probably because they cook in about 12 minutes. I substitute half the flour with whole wheat flour to off-set the chocolate guilt. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This is the best banana bread recipe I have tried!  I initially followed the recipe exactly and sliced the bananas  but didn't like biting into a "gooey" brown banana piece.  Now I simply mash up the bananas and the bread comes out perfect everytime!  I recently tried another banana bread recipe on this site because I was out of sour cream.  My kids knew the difference right away.  This recipe will be the only one I use from now on.

After reading the other reviews, I was very tempted to tweak the recipe, but I resisted (except I did mash the bananas instead of slicing them.  That was the ONLY thing I did differently).  The bread was moist and delicious and got rave reviews from all those who tried it.

This was the best banana bread, very moist and flavorful. I used 3 bananas in this recipe. A hit with the family!

FINALLY, I found a perfect banana bread!
It's slightly crunchy on the crust and wonderfully moist on the inside!

This banana bread is super!! It was incredibly easy to mix up, and turned out fabulous. I did add a little cinnamon/nutmeg, and substituted chocolate chips instead of wal-nuts. I doubled the recipe easily as well. My husband took it to work and it disappeared quickly! This is a winner!

I have already had to make this recipe 6 times! It is a HUGE hit and I've been told several times it's the best banana bread they've ever had. I didn't change a thing! Thanks so much for the recipe. My husband adds his sincere thanks as well!

Excellent! First time making banana bread and it came out YUMMY! I did think it was weird to use sour cream, but after reading I discovered it was for moisture. I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup white sugar only because I hardly eat white sugar. I also added some cinnamon and mashed my bananas. I will definitely make this again!

I made this yesterday. I followed the directions exactly pretty much, except I used 1/2c white sugar and 1/2c brownsugar,I also only cooked the banana bread for 50 min.instead of an hour.I also suggest when making this its better the next day.Very good and easy to make.My family gobbled it right up only a little bit left....THANKS FOR THE RECEPIE!

This is the easiest bread I have ever made and must have been really good because I only got one small piece before it was devoured! The only change I made was to use pecans instead of walnuts, personal preference. I also think that if you have more time to devote to it, the other banana sour cream bread on this site is a little better.

It was my first time to make a banana bread, and it tasted very good. I followed the recipe quiet well, though I mashed bananas instead of slicing them. It was not easy to mix sour cream in the butter, since my sour cream was hard. Next time I make this bread I try to mix bananas and sour cream first, then mix the sour cream mixture with the butter.

I made this bread over the weekend, it was very delicious and moist, even though the top and bottom were completely brown, almost burnt. It took about and hour and 15 min to bake fully.I just cut off the top and bottom, still a great and easy recipe!

Very good recipe.  Changes I made, I added 3 VERY ripe banana's in hopes to keep the bread moist since I like to freeze it for snacks for the kids.  I also added a little bit of cloves and some cinnamon.  Also only added the chocolate chips no walnuts.  And used 1/2 cup Vanilla Yogurt instead of sour cream.  I also divided the mixture and made two small loafs.  End result...is it normal to almost eat the whole bread yourself?  WAY TO GOOD!  A little on the sweet side, probably could use less sugar if you're added just the chips and using yogurt, but still it is awesome, hoping NOT to eat the whole cake myself before the kids get home!

Pretty good.  Nice & moist.  But the flavor wasn't as strong as I wanted, so maybe I'll add more banana next time.  Or maybe the ones I used weren't ripe enough?  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is quite good.  Some pointers, though -- I would mash the bananas and use 3 instead of 2.  Adding a little ground cinnamon to the batter helps with the flavor.  Also, I noticed that this bread is much, much tastier after sitting for a day on the counter or in the fridge.  Fresh out of the oven it is not nearly as good as it is later on.

This is HANDS DOWN the best banana bread I've ever made! It is incredibly moist and flavorful.  The only thing I changed was I sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing and my family loved this banana bread.  This will be our family recipe from now on!

Without fail, my banana bread always turns out flat and underdone....until now!!!!  This banana bread was perfect!  I also did 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white, mashed my bananas, and left out the nuts.  I even forgot about it and when my husband found it still in the oven even after the timer had long since gone off, it was a little darker, but still perfect.  Fluffy on the inside, and a little crispy on the outside.  Thank you for a "long time needed" recipe!

This was the first time I have every made banana bread.  This was the perfect recipe for a beginner.  I did take advise from another review and added cinnamon to the mixture.

I will definately do this again.

A+++!!  This is the PERFECT banana bread.  I made some for my parents to bring to bible study and they loved it.  Then I made some for us, we all LOVED it.  This is the first time I've ever made banana bread, and will continue making this recipe. It's super moist.  I used 3 bananas and mashed them. Thanks so much for posting this!

Great!  This is the first recipe for Banana Bread that I've used (& I've tried many) that resulted in the perfect consistancy bread.  Usually banana bread is too mushy in the middle & too brown at the edge.  I did add 1/2 cup more flour because I had 4 really ripe bananas to use up, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  I made it in a bundt pan and there were only crumbs left by bedtime...everyone loved it.

AMAZING! Very moist and flavorful. i made mine into muffins by using a muffin pan instead of a loaf pan. These rock! thanks for the recipe!... Update 09/26/2011: I just made this deliciousness again. This time I used 1 jumbo egg, 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white, 1/2 white a.p. flour and 1/2 whole wheat and 3 smaller smashed bananas, which equaled 3/4 cup  (probably should have used 4 for a full cup). Came out perfectly!

Yum!  This was an excellent recipe and turned out perfectly.  I followed the listed instructions to a "T" and this was very good.  I can see how previous recommendations of 3 mashed bananas and a few spices could add to an already great recipe.  Next time I'll have to try a few of those suggestions and see what happens. A definite keeper!

The best banana bread ever...moist and perfectly raised.  Pecans in place of the walnuts were good too. Be sure it is done - pulling away from pan edges and brown. Mine took the full hour for smaller loaves.

Best I've ever had!!!  I took some other reviewers suggestions and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Also I smashed 2 bananas and sliced 1 banana into half slices.  The chunks of bananas gave some bites an added kick of sweetness and cutting in half slices didn't give it a gooey texture.  
My only suggestion is to make double or triple the recipe...because 1 loaf is gone the same day you make it!!!

Very good and very moist, even after using 1/3 oat flour, 1/3 quinoa flour and 1/3 brn rice flour.  I used mashed bananas and chopped up one banana.  Delious!

I made this recipe with splenda and fat free sour cream.  I sent it to work with my boyfriend.  The next day he called and asked me to make another couple of loaves.  That is when I told him it was sugar free and fat free.  He almost had a heart attack although he still wanted another couple of loaves.  This is the MOISTEST banana bread I have ever made.  It is delicious!

This recipes happened to be my first try at banana bread, and I was pleasently surprised with how yummy the result turned out to be! I've done this recipe a number of ways now and it has turned out wonderfully with the adding of chocolate chips and the omission of nuts, if desired. Most times I've made it I have mashed two bananas and added a third banana which I chop--the banana chunks in the bread always turn out great! Five stars all around!

Wonderful & simple. i used half whole wheat flour, splenda, margarine, and light sour cream. Also made the banana slices very thin. It came out very moist with a nice crust on top.

Amazing! I love this recipe -- it is moist and sweet and delicious. I use half whole wheat flour, and I do mash the bananas just a little bit once they are in the batter. Can be made into muffins, which bake about 16 minutes or so.

This Brad is Awesome. Very Moist. I changed some things to make it have less calories, since I am dieting. I used splenda and egg whites and Yogurt and wheat flour. I narrowed it down to about 100 calories a slice. It was so good I am going to make more. Excellent Recipe. Thanks

This bread is wonderfully moist!  I mashed 2 bananas and roughly mashed 1 banana (so it was still chunky).  I agree, the chunks of banana don't look so appetizing later on, but it's still delicious.  I also cut the sugar down, added some additional spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also sprinkled the top with oatmeal before baking, which added some nice texture to the bread b/c I omitted the nuts for preference.

This is without a doubt the best banana bread that I have ever had! I didn't change a thing! I really enjoyed the larger pieces of banana instead of the mashed, and the sour cream adds a divine richness to the bread. I will make this banana bread on a regular basis. It's even better with a little cream cheese spread on top!

This is a delicious recipe! I just made a few changes because I did not have everything necessary and it still came out great. I did not have sour creme, so I substituted it with an individual size vanilla yogurt and about 1/3 cup of evaporated milk. I exchanged the nuts for chocolate chips, added 3/4 cup extra flour and 1 more banana. I also made them into muffins instead of a loaf. The kids love them and can take them to school because they are nut-free.

I was able to make 14 muffins out of this recipe that were perfect!  I baked them for 24 minutes like an early reviewer mentioned.  I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of the muffins.  Delicious!

I have made this recipe many times now, and I LOVE IT!  I make muffins instead, checking at 20 min. for doneness.  They usually are done around 30-40 minutes.  I also use whole wheat (pastry) flour instead of the all-purpose.  I can't tell the difference!  Delicious!

YUMMY!  I omitted the nuts, mashed the bananas, and used an extra banana and it came out great!

I mashed the bananas instead of chopping them and it is the BEST bread I've ever made.  Moist and yummy...my family begs me to make it all the time. My hubby even went to the store and bought over ripe bananas...think that was a hint????  THANKS JANET!!!!

This recipe was very moist, which is what I was looking for.  However I don't like the slicing banana thing.  I used three bananas, mashed two and sliced only one.   The one that I did slice turned kind of  slimy and weird in the bread, I am not sure why.  It still tasted god, just looked a little gross.

Excellent recipe!  I made it gluten free using rice flour and tapioca starch and a little xanthan gum and it came out fabulous.  I love the light creamy color instead of the dark brown stringy color you get from some recipes.  Yummy!

This banana bread was asolutely delicious. I doubled the recipe and put in in two loaf pans. My son likes chocolate so I folded in semi-sweet chocolate chips in it for him. Very moist and the texture was smooth. My husband said it was the best banana bread he's ever tasted.
Thanks!
Julie

I saw a recipe for "the best banana bread" but they must have gotten it mixed up with this one because this is the BEST banana bread.... I've made many banana breads over the years, used different recipes but this IS IT!!! My final banana bread recipe for the next 100 years :). The only thing I do differently is smash the bananas instead of slicing.

This was a really good recipe.  I used 3 bananas instead of 2 and mashed them as so many reviewers recommended. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I think it is really good banana bread - it just lacks that WOW-factor which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

I followed the recipe exactly and wasn't disappointed.  The banana bread is really moist.  This is going to be my favorite banana bread recipe to share.  My family and friends loved it.

This is the first time I have ever made banana bread and it was great, and so easy! I brought it to work and everyone raved about it...I think the sour cream is key to making it really moist and delicious. I did mash the bananas instead of slicing them, but otherwise followed it exactly as written. Five stars!

This was perfect.  I did go ahead and blend the bananas in, rather than folding them in. Also used pecans because that is what I had on hand.  This is the only recipe for banana bread I will ever use from now on.

Delicious! My husband is short on compliments and he loved this! Asked me to please bake another loaf.  The only thing I changed was to use margarine instead of butter (didn't have butter)but it was great anyway!

This was moist and good.  However, mine did not rise as much as others.  I dod used Fat Free sour cream and margarine versus butter (bad, but that is all I had).  I mashed the bananas, too.  Very tasty though.

Very good.  You do not need to put margarine on this (good thing too, not exactly healthy in the first place!).  I, too, mashed the bananas.  Added bit of nutmeg with the flour - maybe 1/2 tsp? - since I noticed there were no spices.  It was mostly eaten by the time I got home from work.  A winner!

This was moist and delicious. I wasn't crazy about the appearance though. (My purplish sliced bananas sank to the bottom) Still it was very good.
