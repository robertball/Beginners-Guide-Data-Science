Halved the recipe and got exactly 10 cookies. They were impossible to roll even after I had sprayed my hands with non stick spray. I used a cookie scoop and tossed them in the sugar/cinnamon mixture. Once coated I was able to roll them into balls. Took exactly 11 minutes for the perfectly round cookies to bake. Extremely sweet, chewy, super soft and rather sticky. One of my grandsons tried them and he absolutely loved them! In his words 'These are the bomb'. I thought they were just ok. I rated them 3 stars and my grandson rated them 5 stars, hence the 4 Star rating.

These cookies have a delicate flavour and a soft texture.. I did find I had to add an additional half cup of flour more than the recipe called for.. To make the cookie dough balls.. I lightly floured my hands AND a sheet of waxed paper--made a long roll out of the dough and cut it into same sized pieces with a floured knife.. Again (with lightly floured hands) I rolled each piece into a ball....half the balls were rolled in the sugar cinnamon mixture.. and.. For a slightly different look and taste....the other half were rolled in what was left of the remaining sugar cinnamon mixture plus 1/4 cup of crushed honey roasted almonds.. Both are equally delicious.. Thx for sharing

The dough was so sticky I could not form it into balls. I added more flour...didn t work. I tried to refrigerate it...didn t work. I finally used a spoon to drop it a little at a time into the cinnamon/sugar in order to be able to roll it into the balls. The end result was an extremely sweet chewy candy-like cookie that looked NOTHING like the picture.

Gluten and dairy free variation: I made this recipe with amaranth flour and dairy free butter. Cookies came out perfect in colour- honey brown, texture-American soft cookie that melts rather than crumbles in the mouth.
Highly recommended also by a coeliac friend who couldn’t eat them fast enough!

I did add 1/2 cup extra flour but it was still too sticky to work with. I stole Donna's trick from the reviews and scraped on wax paper and rolled into a snake. Before I cut slices off to roll into balls I chilled the whole thing over night. Didn't need a floured knife I just had to hurry up and get balls made and rolled in the sugar before it warmed up. Worked great. Cookies were amazing according to the people at the Christmas party! I loved them as well.

First off when I searched for "Honey Cinnamon Cookies" to leave a review the search came up zero. I had to try "Honey Cinnamon" and then find the cookie. Oh well. These cookies were okay. They were very mild flavored. I like my cookies pretty crisp and probably should have baked them a couple of minutes longer. WORD OF WARNING: Refrigerate the dough for at least 30-45 minutes or it will be too sticky to work with. I made my dough in a metal bowl refrigerated it for 20 minutes and the only workable dough was that that touched the cold metal bowl. If you like very mild cookies you will like these. I was hoping for a stronger honey and/or cinnamon flavor; I did roll them in cinnamon sugar.

They came out more bland like a sugar cookie than tasting like honey and cinnamon sugar—which is a large part of the ingredients. So I added more honey on the tops of them. They absorbed the honey for the most amazing and part, which was kind cool.

I was really nervous about making these because of the majority of the reviews talking about how sticky they were. So I added an extra half cup of flour. I also put all the liquids - egg butter and honey in the bowl first. Then sifted flour salt baking soda and cinnamon directly into the bowl along with the brown sugar. Baking is a science and often the order of ingredients can make all the difference. I mixed all together and the consistency was PERFECT. No problems at all rolling them in balls. They came out a little thicker than I expected but that makes sense with the added flower. They are chewy and moist and delicious. My kids are thrilled.

Delicious flavor! I was out of ap flour so used sr and omitted the baking soda. Too sticky to roll into balls so dropped them by teaspoonfuls then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. Baked for 9 minutes since they were smaller.

I made exactly like the recipe.  It will not form a ball and family thought it was a little like a molasses cookie than a cinnamon sugar cookie.  Will not use this recipe again.
