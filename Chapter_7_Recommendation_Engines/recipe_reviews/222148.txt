This was an awesome recipe! I used skinless chicken breasts & made it in the oven in a Pyrex dish. I sprayed the dish with olive oil spray. I used BBQ sauce & added the mustard &a fresh lime wedge(instead of lemon) in the sauce....it was sooooo delicious!! The chicken was moist....I paired it with homemade mashed potatoes & fresh broccoli. Mmmmmmmm mmmmm mmmmmm Good!!!

I made this on Father's Day weekend.  It was very good.  I used organic bacon and I like to have things a little spicier so I cut back on the ketchup but added 1/2 a cup of Chilli sauce.  It turned out very good and did not drown out the maple syrup taste.  I also doubled the garlic.  Cooking the bacon first is a very good idea and I also seared the chicken breasts in a frying pan first.  I'll definitely be making this again.

It was pretty good overall, but a little too salty for my taste. Most of the family liked it but eventually peeled off the bacon due to the salt content. Next time I may buy a low sodium bacon.

I've made this a few times now, slightly different each time, but always amazing! Who'd have thought ketchup, garlic and syrup would taste good together?

The sweetness of the sauce + the bacon is delicious! Instead of grilling, I browned the bacon-wrapped chicken in a pan before baking it in the oven and it came out very well. Make sure to check with meat thermometer.

This recipe was so good! I imagine using the basting sauce for chicken without the bacon would be great and plan on trying sometime!

The only change was to use yellow mustard instead of dijon mustard for the BBQ sauce.

Delicious! I didn't salt/pepper the chicken prior to the grill as I decided to marinate the chicken for 15-ish minutes with the basting ingredients while I baked the bacon prior to wrapping the chicken with it. I didn't put lemon, or chives, on it afterwards. It turned out very tasty!

I loved this recipe. The only thing I did differently was that the bacon didn't quite get done enough on the grill, so I put them on a baking sheet and broiled them for just a few minutes on each side, for crispy bacon. Loved the flavor!! And my family loved it.

This recipe was awesome my family eats it up even my toddler. Best of all they hardly ever will eat leftovers but they always ask if there's more of this the next day!! So I make a bit extra and we have a great lunch the next day as well that they actually want!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!
