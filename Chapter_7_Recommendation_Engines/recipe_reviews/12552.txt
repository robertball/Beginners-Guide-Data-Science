I made this for a friend's birthday and it was wonderful!  Makes more filling than needed and I was able to make another small pie.  I also used crushed mint-filled oreo cookies for the crust.  I think I would mix the mint pieces into the filling next time.  They got too browned on the top for my taste.  Will definitely make again!!

I made this for my husband's birthday and everyone liked it. I wound up with enough filling for two pies, though and I put the mints in the filling instead of on top.

I thought I had graham crackers, but to my surprise my husband had eaten them all.  So I made the Chocolate Cookie Crumb recipe on this site and it worked out perfectly.  I think the chocolate crust is a better fit.  I used Andes chocolate mints and added half in the batter and half as a topping.  It was delish!

Delicious!  I put about half the mints in the filling and the rest on top like the recipe instructed.  It was a big hit with my husband and friends.
