Fabulous recipe and you can use whatever you have in the house! I added navy beans as I had no black eyed peas, green pepper and red onions. Next time I would cut the sugar in half as the dressing was very sweet. I served this with tortilla scoops.....nice Summer appetizer.

Awesome.  Full of unique flavor!  Love the black eyed peas in this!  I left out the celery and used a fresh jalapeno.  Delicious as a salad or with chips.

I made it to use as a corn salsa with a Chipotle-style dinner and my kids loved it! I added 3 Jalepeno slices and some cilantro - because everything is better with cilantro!

Quick and easy! I needed a last minute side dish for my tex-mex themed get-together and this was a nice touch.

Delucious, quick, and easy! Used tomato instead of pepper, and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Didnâ€™t have black eyed peas, so used two cans of black beans, also used fresh corn on the cob. Based on others reviews, I only used a quarter cup of sugar and it was perfect.

Have made this three times and it was a hit every time. The only change I made was I omitted the black eye peas and I used a half cups of sweet onion instead of green onions.

Very tasty. I did add extra vinegar because we like it more sour than sweet. Might be good with a bit of taco seasoning too.

Made this for a family cookout and all I heard all night was this is sooooo good!!  The family liked it in the chips but also were just eating it out of a bowl.  Definitely one to make again.

This recipe has found a permanent home in my recipe box. It is extremely versatile and can be adopted to supplies on hand. This dish is great alone, with chips, over leafy greens, and even warm over rice. It's always been a crowd-pleaser when brought to potlucks or parties.

Thank you for this recipe.  I Make it for beach entertaining.  If i may make 2 suggestions..use shopeg corn.  The corn is smaller and sweet, no chance for that starchy texture and dice all the veggies itty bitty like the size of corn kernels.  I use scoops tortillas if you want a big mouthful of this refreshingly deliciously addictive appetizer.
