12.27.16 I used Goya® Cilantro & Tomato Sazon for the the tomato-flavored bouillon, and it really kicked up the flavor.  Didn‘t have any salsa on hand (it was optional), but even without it, these beans were delicious, the perfect side kick to just about any Mexican meal.  Love this Instant Pot and loved these charro beans!  *****UPDATE 7.13.17*****  Mashed some of the beans today and layered into some beef enchiladas.  I find I'm making this recipe often, it's just so darn good!

This is a keeper!  One important note though - I did  not add the salsa at the beginning - tomato products added to dried bean can keep the beans from softening, once cooked and the beans are soft, it is fine to add the salsa or other tomatoes. 
The kids loved this, served with corn tortillas, lime wedges and some grated cheese it was a meal.

This made excellent beans! I have never been successful in the past making a pot of beans on stovetop or slowcooker. I did this in my instant pot. The only changes I made were to saute the onions and jalapeno in bacon grease (this is what my grandmother had always done) I also replaced the  tomato bouillon with chicken bouillon because that is what I had on hand. This tasted so good and were soft, but not already mushy. I  also soaked my beans the night before and into the next day (maybe for like 15 hours total). I have learned in the past that soaking the beans makes a big difference. However, I had never made them before in an instant pot. Next time I may just throw them in without soaking. There was a lot of liquid left, so if you do soak your beans you may not need so much water. This will be how I make a pot of mexican pinto beans from now on! Thank you!

I love the flavors of this recipe! After making these beans a couple of times I've found that cooking them for an hour on high pressure gives a more creamy bean texture and higher pronounced flavor. I do not soak the beans first. Will be making this again for years to come. Thanks for the great recipe!

My pressure cooker doesn't have a "Bean/Chili" function as called for in the recipe so I cooked the beans on the "Meat" function for 55 minutes. This is a delicious meatless meal that I'll make again soon.

This is amazing in my Instant Pot. Under an hour and no soaking and perfectly cooked beans. I did use salsa and I feel that this added a nice touch and lots of taste.

I love a bowl of pinto beans so I make them often. My number one suggestion for making beans is to clean and soak the beans overnight in salt water.  The next day clean the beans again (rinse them in water), then put them in the crock pot to cook and follow the recipe. This recipe is a good flavored recipe. I don't use the salsa, but I will sometimes add a can of petite diced tomato with green chili's. Oh, and add in either a ham hock or cut up ham steak with the fat.

I used my left over Thanksgiving ham and added it all to a slow cooker pot of beans.

I have made this dish so many times this year and last, that I know it by heart. Each time though I make it differently because of the ingredients I have in my free., or pantry. No matter which way it make it there is just no messing the dish up. It's an easy recipe and goes great for making other delicious dishes. for instance, Bean Burritos, tostadas, side dishes. It's a great and diverse recipe! I'd give it a 5++ rating!!

This was pretty good.  My FIRST meal in the Instant pot.  (I noted the person tried to make in crock pot- NOT the same thing).

Because I live in Texas and like things with a little more zing, I added a 1/4 cup of HOT salsa half of a chopped jalapeno (no seeds), along with a few other seasonings.  I used chicken bouillon as I didn't have tomato, but did have some sun-dried tomato paste, so used that.  Added some chopped carrots as well as some chopped up pork jowl for extra flavor.

As mentioned before, this was first meal in the Instant pot.  I can't believe how much more intense the flavors  and the HEAT was..  whoa doggies.  It was too hot for me.  

Need to learn how to adjust those seasonings!..  but happy with the result. Beans were just the right not quite firmness.

I soaked my beans overnight because I like them soft.  Wasn't sure how they would come out without soaking.  I used 4 teaspoons of Better Than Bouillon Vegetable Based Bouillon instead of tomato flavored (couldn't find it).  I also doubled the amount of spices.  Did not use salsa (because I actually forgot).  You may not need 4 cups of water in the IP if you don't soak the beans first.  There is lots of liquid.  These are delicious and I will make them again for sure!

I cooked these in my 6 qt. Power Cooker. The only changes I made was to replace the tomato and vegetable bullion with chicken bullion. It came out great! Love the flavor! 
I am new to pressure cooking. Some things I have tried didn't come out ( my fault I'm sure) as well as I would have liked but these charro beans were perfect! I will definitely cook them again.

I make these weekly and have changed the base recipe since my wife and I have found that we actually enjoy the charro beans as much as the refried beans and needed more liquid.  So here is the update you can try.
6 Cups of Water
1lb dry pinto beans
1tbsp low sodium vegtable base (in the jar)
1tbsp low sodium chicken base (in the jar)
increase all seasonings to 1 tsp instead of 1/2.
Added 1 tsp salt since i stoped using boullon
Rest of ingrediants stayed the same.  I do saute the onions in about a tbsp of oil for about 2 minutes in the instapot then add the garlic and jalapeno and saute them until fragrent then add the water to deglaze before adding rest of ingrediants.

We end up with more bean broth and have beans for dinner and then make refried beans in the morning for bean and cheese tacos :)

They were great. I do not have a InstantPot so I cooked on my stove top & they were perfect. Also I added some hatch chilies (medium heat).   My guests enjoyed the beans.   This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent recipe. I made a few changes, only because I had some ingredients, and didnt have others. I used 2 C. of Chicken Broth, + 2 C. water.  I also used 3/4 of a very large Mayan Onion which I chopped up and cooked with about 4 slices chopped bacon. I cooked it in cast iron skillet until crispy and onions were caramelized. Also, I omitted the salsa. I also did not use the tomato or vegetable bouillon cubes, instead I used 2 Chicken bouillon cubes. Everything else in recipe was used. Finally, my paprika is a smoked paprika. This was an excellent dish. Started in cast iron skillet (bacon and onions,) and finished in InstaPot for 1 hour. So so good. Thank you for recipe.

Made this tonight and I really liked it.  I didn't have any fresh cilantro so I used dried, I did use the salsa and I sauteed the onions and garlic only because I had a pan with beef drippings sitting there.  I actually doubled the chili powder and cumin.  When serving I stirred in a dollop of sour cream, delicious!  Thank you for a great recipe.

I followed the directions except for adding green chilies instead of jalapeno, because thats what I had on hand, and then I added the salsa after I cooked it because I forgot :)  The 45 minutes was not nearly enough time for the beans, and they were still rather firm, so I added more water and cooked it longer.  Not sure if it was due to high altitude or not (im at 7200 feet).  After a science lesson from my husband, he explained that I should add about 20% to my time due to altitude, so next time I will cook it for an hour instead of 45 minutes and see what happens.  :)

Sautéed bacon and chopped onion in the instant pot before adding the beans and other ingredients. The seasoning was a little heavy for my taste. Also next time I’d use chicken broth instead of the bullion + water combo. Ok overall

Really good flavor.  Took a little longer to cook in my instapot... Approx 70 minutes on the timer, plus natural release.  I will make it again.

These turned out perfect as written in my Instant Pot. I was leery about adding the salsa in the beginning but the beans softened up and turned out perfect. Not sure where the (Refried Beans) comes from but nonetheless they are good.

Fantastic refried beans.   Better than any canned that we've had and as good, if not better, than what we get in authentic Mexican restaurants.   I did not have vegetable or tomato bouillon, so I substituted three chicken bouillon cubes total for them.  I did not use the optional salsa and it was perhaps just a bit spicy.   When I make again, I will probably cut the jalapenos in half.

I will definitely make it again.  I didn't have a jalapeno,  so I substituted pickled chopped jalapeno slices.

These are good beans. I started by sauteeing bacon in my Instant Pot. I did substitute chicken stock because that's what I had on hand. I didn't soak my beans beforehand. Unfortunately, when the time was up, I had to add water and cook for another 15 minutes. So, next time, I'll add more water and add extra time. They do have a great flavor though!

We have made this twice (the second time is as I type this, lol.). And so far and it was really really good.  The beans weren’t as soft as I’d like, so this time I increased the cook time to 1:15.  I made the recipe almost exactly with the exception of using 2 blocks of vegetable broth instead of the tomato broth since that is what I had on hand.  These came out really really good.  Nice texture, firm but soft still.  The extra 1/2 hour cook time did make a difference.  The spices are on point.  Our attitude is 4700’.

The were fantastic! I used half the beans but kept everything else as the recipe called for. I did sauté the onions, jalapeno and garlic beforehand. I also added extra chicken broth for juicer beans, and followed suggestions of not adding the salsa till later. Tasting the beans after cooking, I didn't add it. Will do again!!

I made this twice in a week. First was made following directions as written. It was fabulous. My picky adult son dislikes beans but raved about hoping there were leftovers. Second time I made this I added a tablespoon of chili powder (our taste). Both times i made this is added pre-cooked potatoes at the end.  They were great and stretched the dish a little. This is a great basic recipe that could be easily modified to your personal preference.

I make these beans outside over a fire in a cast iron dutch oven
I did add a few items, Chorizo with the bacon. hot sauce, fire-roasted tomatoes, and a variety of beans, Pinto, kidney, black beans.  the perfect side for a 16lb smoked brisket!

this is my first time making beans in the instant pot and i'm beyond impressed. no need to soak saves SO much time.  i set the beans for an hour as suggested by other reviewers.  i live in los angeles so i don't think the elevation has anything to do with the time.  i'm used to mushy beans from the crock pot but these had texture.. good texture. i didn't add the salsa and added the bouillon at the end bc i've read salt at the beginning of the cook will keep the beans hard.  i prefer a little more seasoning but that can always be added on the finished product.  ty for the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I added 3 canned chipotle peppers in adobe sauce.  The flavors were tasted but beans were not anywhere done after 45 minutes. I put them on another 15 minutes and were ok but really should have cooked even longer.

Awesome!! I soaked my beans and cooked them according to the instant pot instructions for soaked beans of 7-9 mins. So flavorful, these beans were great for a lot of dishes throughout the week.

I prepared as directed, but the beans were not totally done even after 8 hours in the crockpot.  It really did not have a good flavor - needed more spices.
