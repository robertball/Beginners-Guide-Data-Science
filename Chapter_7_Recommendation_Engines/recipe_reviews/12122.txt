This was not only a super easy recipe, but the results were great! I made it exactly as stated, and I found the coffee was a nice compliment to the chocolate. You don't really taste that there's coffee in the pie, but rather a nice hint of mocha. If I didn't know it was in the pie, I never would have known. One thing to point out is that I had enough filling for 2 full 9" pie shells (not deep dish, purchased in the freezer section at my local grocery store)rather than just one. That was great since I was making the pie for a gift.....then we had another one to try ourselves! It was delicious, rich and a perfect pie you will be proud to serve! This has now become my husbands favorite pecan pie!

This pie is absolutely delicious!  My husband made this pie twice this week - the first one only lasted 24 hours!  And no, my husband is not a chef - this pie is just that simple!  We didn't put in the instant coffee - but followed the rest to the "t."  We used frozen pie crusts and they worked great - but i would recommend you put some foil under the pan, as it did spill out some as it was cooking (since frozen pie crusts are usually in more shallow pans). This is a fantastic recipe.  We are going to be making 2 more pies this week for Christmas dinner!  I can't wait!  Yum!

Very easy to make.  Rich, but good.  I did leave out the coffee, but there were no adverse effects.  Thanks for sharing!

The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because this pie was tasty but that was about it.  I had to bake my pie for 60 minutes and the center was still soft.  My pie came out runny.  Did not dare bake it any longer because my pie crust was very dark and I used a pie crust ring the entire baking time.  Was not what I was looking for. Sorry

great recipe, did not use the coffee either.  I would not recommend cooking longer than suggested time.  once top is just firm, it is done since pecan pies continue to cook after they come out of the oven.

This pie was absolutely amazing!   I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone that tried it said it was the best pecan pie they have ever had.  I mixed 3/4 cup Giradelli mini chocolate chips with the pecan filling before putting in the pie shell.  I also used 1 tsp instant expresso instead of coffee  powder (with no water).   I had to bake it an extra 10 minutes for it to set but it turned out perfect.  This is a keeper!

This was an amazing pie.  I used a 9.5 in pie pan and the amount was perfect.  I didn't get any spill-over.  I had to increase the baking time by about 5 minutes.  I also covered it for the first 30 minutes of baking to keep the crust from getting too brown.  My family LOVED it and it's now my go to pie for family get togethers.

This pie is great, now my family's favorite! I was especially pleased at how well it set up, even at our altitude in Colorado where pecan pies are often runny!  It is difficult to find the recipe as it only comes up under an ingredient search, tho.

I've made many a pecan pie, and this was one of the best. The recipe is similar to all the others but something (maybe the coffee?) made it a cut above. Don't bother with the cream; that's really gilding the lily. Thanks Jeannette.

This was my first time making pecan pie and I loved it and so did the rest of my family. I did follow one users suggestion and covered the pie for the first half hour of baking which helped the crust stay a nice golden brown.

Absolutely perfect!  I ended up using 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips as that was what I had on hand and this pie was amazing! I only lasted a day and a half!

This is the second time I made this pie. It is good! I follow the recipe exactly all the ingredients were there. The only thing is that I took 10 minutes away from the baking time, because I live in Houston and things cook fast at sea level. It is my family's favorite pie.

Alright, so I made this the other day because I was really craving some pecan pie, and it was great. Now I'd never made a pecan pie before so this was a first. I didn't have any coffee powder so I omitted it and I added about half a cup of pecans. I also used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, and it turned out wonderfully. It was very chocolatey and had a rich flavor that was great with some ice cream. Awesome chocolate pecan pie recipe!

Made it as is except for the coffee powder.  It was excellent!  I only cooked it about 55 minutes, 60 minutes would have been over done.  I will be making it again (and again)!

I'm not a fan of pecans but people absolutely love this pie when I make it. I leave out the coffee because I don't have any. People say it's a sensational pie.
