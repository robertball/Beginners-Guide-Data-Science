OK. Confession. When I was younger and I'd make a cake, I'd always filch batter. By the spoonful. Couldn't help myself! As a result, my cakes were never very tall. Fast forward a few decades. I'm diabetic. No more tastes when baking for me! Even so, nothing prepared me for how much batter this recipe made. I got three very full 9" layers and 8 cupcakes. Couldn't believe how I just kept filling cupcake papers. How could anyone possibly fit this into "2- 9" pans"??? Anyway, I tasted one of the cupcakes, and was absolutely blown away by the texture - so moist with a fine, light crumb. It's everything you love about a mix cake, minus that obnoxious, artificial flavor. Those who say it was dense, there are a couple of possible causes. You could have beaten too much after the flour was added, encouraging formation of gluten, the protein in flour that gives structure to breads. Simply incorporate the flour gently and stop, which will obviate that problem. Or perhaps you opted for all purpose flour instead.  Big mistake. If you don't have cake flour, measure out 3-1/2 cups all purpose and add 1/2 cup cornstarch. Sift 3 times. If you used cake flour, did you sift? Sifting aerates your flour. If your product was dry, that indicates packing your flour when measuring (be sure to spoon the sifted flour lightly into your cup  and sweep the back of a knife to level,) overbaking, or a temp that was too high. Calibrate your oven using an oven thermometer every 3 months.

I'm a sucker for yellow cake. No frills, no fancy technique, just simple lovely cake. Very moist, very very delicious. Will be my go to yellow cake recipe (sorry grandma...) Also love that buttermilk was used. It makes this cake all the more rich and delightful

Overall this produced a good cake, but I have a few points for others. 1. This makes more batter than 2-9inch cake pans worth. More like 3-9inch cake pans. FYI. 2. This cake is a slow cooker - I made it in a 9x13 and it took over an hour to test done (it had browned a bit on top but that's normal in butter cakes, if that's going to bother you, find a shortening or oil cake recipe). This is because of the amount of batter -- reduce if you don't need 3 cakes or a 3-4 inch thick sheet cake. 3. I stored my cake in the fridge due to how I frosted it, so I can't speak to the moistness (the fridge sucks the moisture out of cakes and breads, so never bash a baked good that you stuck in the fridge without pre-tasting) but I can say that it came out with a much denser crumb than cakes made with all-purpose flour, however it was tender to the mouth and fork. This cake would hold up well for cutting into layers, etc., much like pound cake (but tasting different). Overall I was pleased with this recipe but as one of the early reviewers I wanted to go ahead and point out a few things about this cake before people make it expecting Betty Crocker boxed mix and then downrate it. Thank you Alicia, we enjoyed your recipe!

I am the poster of this recipe.  I shouldve noted that my pans are 2 inches deeper than regular pans you guys are probabaly using.  So I can see how it may be a bit much for the regular pans that you all are using.  Sorry guys ;-(

I thought I was making this recipe and had mistakenly taken another off of the site. BAD mistake. It came out like a dense rock... like the one Patrick lives under in Spongebob. Anyway, this one rocked and thanks for educating me about the essentialness of using cake flour vs all purpose!

This is the best yellow cake I've ever made. Really light, airy, perfect flavor. Almost like a mix cake but better. I cut the recipe in half and baked in a 13x9, came out perfect, 1-1/2 inches thick in the middle. baked for 33 minutes.

We made cupcakes out of this recipe. They were light,  moist, and fluffy. The perfect texture! The only change I made was to add extra vanilla. We'll be using this recipe again.

4.13.11 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/217088/yellow-clooney-cake/ ... I liked this cake.  Searching for the perfect yellow cake.  This isn't "it," but it is good.  Nice buttery flavor, very moist, medium texture, quite dense (almost like a quick bread dense)  - ahhh, butter.  :)  More buttery tasting than "Mary Oppenheimer's Butter Cake."  'Made just one layer.  I increased the sugar to a cup & a half.  It wasn't too much.  'Don't spank me, but I didn't use cake flour. Used a cup & two-thirds regular flour.  Maybe another egg would help with the denseness issue - to make it more cakelike.  Maybe.  :)  PS What's a "clooney"?!?

Made this exactly as written however would recommend 3 round pans instead of 2.  I really liked how tall the layers were however it was hard to slice and fell apart easily.  Will likely try it again using less batter per pan and reducing the baking time so the edges don't over bake.

very good - used regular all-purpose flour (didn't have any cake flour) and added 2 smashed bananas.  I made cupcakes.  Very good.

This was good,but I thought a bit dry. Not the yellow cake I was looking for. I did not edit the recipe at all.  I really expected a moist yellow cake.So, this for me is not a keeper.

Great moist cake although it is very sweet (luckily I do have a sweet tooth!!!).  Followed the recipe exactly, one batch make 12 cupcakes and a 10" Bundt cake.  Thank you so much for sharing.

Awesome cake! Super moist! I used it to build a tiramisu cake (I flavoured it with almond and coffee) so I didn't get to taste it 'au natural' but the texture was fantastic, I've finally found my yellow cake recipe! Thanks!!

Wonderful recipe!  I'm not generally a fan of yellow cakes but a friend of my has requested that type for her son's birthday and this recipe has made me a believer!  I made cupcakes to test it first and slightly overcooked them - all my fault - but even then, they're not dried out and still have wonderful flavor.  Can't wait to try it out again for the real deal!

Wow fantastic!  It made 3 dozen cupcakes, moist and delicious without being too sweet.  The buttermilk gives a great flavor.  My family started eating the warm cupcakes off the cooling rack...didnt' even wait for the frosting.

We made it with all purpose flour, 1/4 cup cream, 1 1/4 cups milk because we didn't have buttermilk ( cut the recipes down for nine people( love that you can do that automatically here)) and 2 tsps of vanilla and it was still amazing. For sure  making this  my go to yellow cake recipes. Thanks so much for sharing :)

I made this yesterday for my sons birthday and it tuned out GREAT! I was going back and forth between this recipe and one other on this site I ended up choosing this one because I thought the buttermilk would be good in it and the other recipe did not use buttermilk. After reading the reviews I knew I would have enough for a 3 layer cake and I did. I followed the directions to a T and it was the best yellow cake recipe I have ever made. My husband took some to a friends house they loved it! The wife said it was the best home made cake she had ever tasted. I made a salted caramel frosting and it was fantastic. This will definitely be made again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This cake recipe is fabulous.  I've tried other yellow cake recipes that turned out heavy, dry and crumbly.  It is a moist, light texture and large cake.  The first time I made it I used my regular nine inch round cake pans.  Big mistake.  It overflowed the pans. The next time I used my commercial nine inch cake pans and it turned out fabulous.  I have never had a cake this size turn out so nice and moist.  Wow.  I can't say enough about it. I have finally found a yellow cake recipe that I am proud to have in my recipe collection.

A friend of mine asked me to make a half sheet cake for her daughter's birthday, and being the fearless baker that I am, I decided to try a new recipe. I used this one and got rave reviews. I doubled the recipe and had enough for some cupcakes because it does make a lot of batter. It was yummy! I am used to making things from scratch and much prefer the taste of home made cakes to store bought, and apparently so did everyone at the party! I'm actually baking a 13x9 right now!

Moms BDay is tomorrow and she requested yellow cake with chocolate frosting, she's definitely going to love this recipes.

After two great cakes using this recipe I ventured onto a different cake recipe on this site.  Big mistake, the new recipe was a visual disaster but after a day in the fridge it tasted all right. 

The recipe contributor has stated that she uses 2 9 inch rounds but her rounds are two inches taller than the standard 9 inch round..  Makes tons of batter. Probably 2 or 3  double layer cake's worth.

I've made this as the recipe stands AND as a gluten-free version.  SPECTACULAR!

For the GF version, I used a blend: 1/2 rice flour, 1/4 sorghum flour, 1/4 potato starch plus 1 tbsp xanthan gum.  Instead of 4 whole eggs, I used 8 egg whites, whipped stiff, then folded into the rest of the cake batter to give it some air.  Worked beautifully!

I have made both versions several times, also turning them into rum cake.  This will be my go-to recipe for a yellow cake.

A bit dry. If I make again try to add more moisture. Very mild flavor that will be enhanced by a good frosting.

I followed the recipe exactly. The cake turned out delish! I made into three 8” round pans for a triple layer cake. I frosted with the Creamy Chocolate Buttercream frosting. Was yummy!!

My daughter made this cake for a friends’ birthday. She halved the recipe and it made a 6” round and 3 cupcakes. Great recipe!

this made way more than 2 nine inch pans of cake. I'm new to baking without a box so I had a slight disaster that my wife helped me fix. in the end I had 2 nine inch cakes and 12 cup cakes! it was a delicious disaster!

Very easy to follow, moist and flavorful. I doubled this recipe exactly and it still worked. Be careful not to over beat! Highly recommended.

Dry and tasteless!   There was no sweetness to this cake at all.  
I thought the baking powder and soda looked like too much. I was right.  The "two pans"  this recipe called for (the photo showed three. . . someone else's?) were not enough. It should have read three.  The cake mushroom up  and over the pan. Get a different recipe.

This is a delicious and moist cake.  I made a half recipe to try it out before my son's birthday and it made two substantial layers.  I will make the full recipe for his party.  It tastes great and has a great texture.  I use very deep cake pans so I didn't have a problem with the batter over flowing.

5/27/2018  I made this cake again.  It's wonderful and has the best flavor.  My favorite yellow cake recipe of all I've tried!!!!!!

I went searching for a yellow cake mix and came across this one several different times and finally decided to give it a try :) It is very moist! However I did not use cake flour or buttermilk. I substituted with just unbleached flour and vanilla almond milk. I am not a huge fan of this cake but my family loved it, which is what matters the most :) I also thought that the cake had a pancake aftertaste flavor.

I made 2 of these cakes today.1 for me and 1 for my cousin. The one I made for home was delicious. Moist easy to cut and mouth watering.  The one I made for her had chocolate chip morsels.

This had a good flavor and a nice crumb to it, butI wouldn't call it exceptionally moist. I made it into a 9x13 cake, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. I needed 40 mins for the cake to cook completely. I'll probably make it again and try adding more fat (butter) so it's more to my taste.

The cake was  very dry  Having read the reviews, I even brushed the layers with simple syrup.  It was so dry that it absorbed the buttercream and mango curd in between the layers. Knowing this, I'll tweak the recipe next time, using less baking powder and either baking at 325 degrees or using less baking time.  In spite of the dryness, my coworkers happily chowed down on...  After all, cake is cake!

Well, the flour is all wrong.  I knew 4 tbsp was wrong but 2 c was not right either. I have a wavy top cake and a hole in the bottom and my cake tester came out clean....guess I'll be making a different cake.

I thought this cake turned out very dry.  The recipe, as others have said, makes a lot of batter so I made a 3 layer cake.  It did not get good reviews at my house.  It's a shame after I spent the time to make it, my husband said he would have preferred I use a cake mix from a box!

I hate this recipe! The parchment paper burned and my house smelled like smoke for an hour! The batter was too sticky, and it took a long time to remove the batter from my bowl. I'm sorry to say, but even though I followed the recipe step by step, the cake turned out to be a disaster!
