Only used this as a guide line.  Used balsamic vinegar, splenda, sesame oil, sesame seeds and no salt.  Added to strawberry spinach salad.  It worked for a low calorie salad

News flash - since when is cornstarch and water healthier than lovely olive oil?  The answer is -- never! Somehow we got conned into thinking fats were bad for us. Not true.  Olive oil may have more calories, but it's also got Omega 3 fats.  Cornstarch adds useless, nutrition-free carbs. 

Just make this dressing using olive oil without the substitution and see how much more wonderful it is!

I liked this enough to try it again, only next time, I want to try regular vinegar instead of cider vinegar. The cider made it entirely too tart and tangy for me.

I thought this was delicious and I love that there is so little oil! After reading the reviews I added a generous drizzle of agave to balance the tartness. Otherwise, I made it exactly as written. This paired perfectly with the berry salad I made.

This is a nice poppy seed dressing, but just a little tangy for us, and we like the taste of vinegar.  I made it to use on 'Outrageously Good Holiday Salad' from AR.  I will use this recipe again as it is the perfect amount for 2 people, although I will use a different vinegar or just cut the cider vinegar down to 2 tablespoons.

I really liked this but hubs thought that it was just ok.  I made one change, I used apple cider vinegar as that's all that I had. This is best with lots of green onions, they really compliment the dressing.  I will probably make this again as I did enjoy it. Thanks for sharing.
