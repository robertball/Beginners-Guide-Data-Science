Very yummy.  I noticed a few people asking why reserve the green bean juice, saying they didn't see what to do with it.  The recipe states: "Boil the reserved cooking liquid in the skillet and stir the browned bits until dissolved".  I take "reserved cooking liquid" to mean the bean juice.  ;)

Very tasty.  This is a good way to use up the garden produce.  I added a Vidalia Onion to mine. I will go heavier on the cheese next time.

This was delicious!!!  The next time I make it I will only boil the green beans for about a minute, as they were over cooked!

I have the same question as another reviewer. Why save the bean juice? I used it to deglaze the pork chop skillet and poured in on the chops in the baking dish.Good. The recipe is a keeper.

I covered the 8x8 dish with foil before putting in the oven.  I used thick chops.  They were very juicy.

Made this tonight. It was pretty good. Added sautéed onions and garlic to the green beans and made it with white rice to soak up the extra juices. Next time, maybe I'll add in sautéed mushrooms with the onions. Very easy to prep and make  overall :)

Super easy and yummy. Didn't have sage so I used dried rosemary instead and it works. I also used a splash of cooking sherry to scrape up all the brown bits from the pork chops. But just a little water also works too! Just had it on hand so why not :-)

Beans could have been a little more flavorful, and perhaps a little less garlic on the chops (maybe mix garlic in with beans as well?)

I did not care for this recipe. The beans were overly salty and the pork chops were tough. If I ever were to make this again (and I might as I have all of the other ingredients in the garden this month), I would use far higher oven temperature and cook the dish for a much shorter time. That might work but I am not sure as the flavors then will have too little time to blend.

This was good...will make again. Why does the recipe say to reserve part of the bean juice - doesn't say what to do with it??? We didn't do anything with it and pork chops were good.
