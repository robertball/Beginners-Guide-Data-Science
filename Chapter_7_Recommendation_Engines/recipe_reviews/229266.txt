I do this but substitute jalapeño jelly and use balsamic vinegar instead of so much orange juice. It's a great base recipe with lots of room for personal taste tweeks. I also add carrots to the parsnips 'cause my hubby loves carrots

This was so delicious and simple and certainly company worthy! Sparky loved it too. I used sugar free marmalade and substituted orange muscat champagne vinegar for the orange juice. I didn't have parsnips so I used carrots.  Thanks for sharing Dartayun!

I'd really give this recipe 4.5 stars.  I made it for company and followed the recipe as written, but added some baby carrots to the pan veggies for a little color.  Delicious!  The pork was tasty, juicy and tender.  I just wish there had been more pan juices.  And next time, I'll be even more liberal with the salt and pepper.  Delicious recipe, Dartanyun.  Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe! I also add carrots for color. It is even better when the leftovers are turned into pork tacos the next day (use cabbage and 1 tsp cumin and some pineapple salsa as filling in the tacos - so yummy with some cilantro)

Wonderfully moist - I used carrots instead of parsnips - they were so sweet.

The only change I made was to include carrots in with the roast ( instead of onions?) This was delicious....slightly orange-y and very flavorful.

We made 2 roasts with this recipe for Christmas and it was a great success! We added carrots and used pearl onions instead of red, to the parsnips and the family loved the sweet and savory combination. It’s now a new favorite!

This was really good but I added red potatoes and carrots instead of parsnips. I also used dry rosemary because I didn’t have fresh. Everything should always have carrots! ??

I absolutely love this recipe!! it's one of my favorites. I've made it twice already. it's fantastic with chicken, also.
Had to snatch some rosemary from my neighbors garden (he said I can), lol. I'll have to buy some parsnips. I've never had a parsnip, but now I have a good reason to buy some. Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe.

My husband and I really liked this. It has a very nice orange flavor with just the right amount of sweetness, and the pork was cooked perfectly. I used dried rosemary in place of the fresh and substituted carrots and sweet potatoes for the parsnips. Next time I make it, I will substitute half of the orange juice for chicken stock; just to add a little more savory "meat" flavor.

Excellent. I used a 2.38 bone in pork loin center roast. The only change I made was using baby redskins in place of parsnips and dried instead of fresh rosemary.

 My pork roast was fresh and had no additive saline(salt)-which may be why some folks noted that theirs was a bit salty-most pork roasts are sold in a saline solution-if this is the case I would entirely omit the salt in the recipe.

 Also look for a pork roast with a nice layer 1/4 inch of fat on top-it really makes the difference-cook fat side on top.

 That said, this was easy, lovely, tender and moist-the fresh pork loin was on sale at the local butcher for 1.69 a lb which made it a tasty and inexpensive meal!
