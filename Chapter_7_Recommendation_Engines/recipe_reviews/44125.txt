This came out great, but I changed it up a bit.  I used 2 pound of lean stew meat, and I was in a hurry, so I half defrosted it, then I put it in a skillet with a cups of water and some garlic cloves, and let that defrost some more until the water evaporated and it slightly browned.  Then I put it in my crock pot with 2 cups of beef broth and the full amount of chili powder and more cumin than the recipe called for...about another half teaspoon more...and the red wine vinegar...left it on low for 8 hours.  When I came home, all I had to do was stir it and it all fell apart, and the juice was absorbed, but it was not dry at all, it was still very juicy.
I made chimichangas out of it, but it could totally be used for everything!  Burritos, tacos, taquitos...I'm going to try it next with chicken, but the beef came out awesome...and because it was already cut up, there was no fat to mess with.
My husband and I both really enjoyed it!
You could also make machaca out of leftovers, if you have any!  (Scrambled egg with beef)

Awesome!! I scaled it down for 2. I made this in the pressure cooker. I lightly browned the meat, then added all the rest of the ingredients, except the cheese, and pressure cooked for 15 min. I turned off the burner, but left the pot on it and let the pressure drop on its own, about 20 min. I removed the lid and transferred the meat to a dish with a slotted spoon and shredded it with two forks. I then returned it to the the pot added a small can of green chilies and cooked the juice down, but was careful not to dry the meat. I used large flour tortillas and even with scaling the recipe to 2 servings it still made 4 chimichangas. I put the cheese on top of the meat before folding. There was plenty of filling. I pan fried them in just enough oil to cover bottom of pan. I served them topped with mexican shredded cheese, salsa, and sour cream. I didn't have any guacamole or would have used that too. They tasted just like the ones I have eaten at Mexican restaurants. I Will definitely make these again.

Process is great, however the flavor needs improvement. Found via Food Network some additions that made the flavor jump into the meat: Remove cooled meat to separate bowl, saute 1/2 onion, chopped & 2 cloves garlic, minced in remaining meat juices and 1 T oil. When soft, return meat to pan. Add 2 chopped tomatoes (I used 1/2 can rotel) & 1/2 chopped bell pepper (I also added 2 jalapenos). Let simmer til meat is moist, not juicy. Remove from stove and assemble. I also added salt/pepper (since this recipe doesn't call for ANY). The meat is AWESOME. When assembling, I did add some shredded cheese, so we'll see how that comes out of the oven.

This is an absolutely fantastic recipe!!! I've made it twice and everyone loves it. The only suggestion my hubby had was putting the shredded cheese with the meat mixture. So the second time I doubled the amount of cheese and put a generous portion on the meat mixture, as well as on the top. It was a big hit !!!

We loved this - done in the crockpot!  I took the advice of others and added garlic and onion, then made a gravy from the drippings.  Fabulous recipe; thanks for sharing!

I can't say how good the meat portion of this recipe was:because I used leftover roast beef. But, I sure am glad someone recommended (on the Recipe Exchange), because I loved the mechanics of the recipe. I would have never thought of brushing tortillas w/ butter and cooking at a high temp to produce a crisp "wrapping"! I added Provolone to the inside and they turned out delicious.

My family liked this, but I think it could use a little more flavor.  I added some salt and cayanne to the beef while it was cooking, which helped.  Next time, I think I'll add a diced onion and some garlic when I add the beef broth.  And I'll de-fat the broth with a strainer before mixing the beef back into it, because it was a little on the greasy side.  Overall though, a great recipe!

These are very good.  I did use only 1 tablespoon of chili and added some garlic.  I used cubed leftover beef and pork and cooked it in chicken broth because I just prefer it instead of the beef.  I don't really care as much for these baked because the tortilla seems to be a bit dry.  I prefer to grill them on the griddle or in a frying pan lightly coated with oil.  They are also excellent deep-fried but grilling is the next best thing if you don’t want the added fat.  Somebody needs to come up with fat-free deep-frying oil!!!!

Oh my - true goodness.  The meat filling was great, but the true star of the show was something so simple as a tortilla buttered on both sides and baked at high heat.  I will definitely make this again, although I will double the tortillas and use the same amount of meat filling.  I used cheddar and melted it on top of the crispy shells for another minute or two in the oven.  Any cheese would be great and I could definitely adapt this to chicken or pork, and try pepper jack or the Monterey this recipe called for.  This recipe elicited as much pleasure as a really good steak!

The story here is the cooking method, not the ingredients. I put a 4-lb roast, one packet of taco seasoning, and the vinegar and beef broth in the slow cooker for 8 hours. I collected and shredded the meat and added another packet of taco seasoning. I put the juices in another container. Both went in the 'fridge overnight. I skimmed off the fat from the juice and added maybe a cup to the shredded meat. Then I made the chimis in the oven as the recipe directs. My picky daughter, 12, said it's the best thing I've ever made. My husband loved it, told me it's better than our favorite restaurant's chimis, and wants to take a pan of it to work. Fabulous, recipe! Thanks!

This was easy to make and was quite tasty! I ended up modifying the beef slightly. I sauteed some onion and garlic, and added a can of green chilies. Then I added the already cooked beef and mixed it all together to put into the tortillas. I think without the addition, I wouldn't have enjoyed them as much. I also took someone else's advice and put cheese in the tortillas. Yum. Thanks for the recipe!

These were good.  I did decide to deep fry rather than make in the oven.  They tasted very good.  I also made the White Cheese Sauce (from this site) to drizzle over them.  Thanks for posting.

These came out exactly as I had hoped. The water had evaporated in my Dutch oven after about twenty minutes, and I turned the heat down to low a few minutes after I added the beef stock mixture because it was boiling. It only took about ninety minutes for the meat to be ready to be shredded. I put some refried beans, rice and cheese inside before I baked them.

I typically don't dutch oven unless I'm camping, but instead we put the roast in a slow cooker, still following the recipe, for about 8 hours.  It is a fantastic base.  I also find I need a bit higher of a temperature on the baking to get the tortillas crispy enough to make a difference.  It's oddly a little different every time.  The two tweaks are the only reason I dropped this down because otherwise it's fantastic and we make these quite often.

This is definitely a staple in my recipe folder. Major substitution: I often use a turkey breast in place of the beef. It makes more than enough for 4 large chimichangas. Minor substitutions: I sometimes used chipotle chili powder instead of regular chili powder, and I use olive oil in place of melted butter (for baking). Alsooooo... this is GREAT in the crock pot! Brown your meat to seal it and throw everything in the crock pot on low for 2-3 hours (for turkey). Enjoy!

I would give this 10 stars if it was an option. This is a very good ,very tasty recipe and easy to make. I usually have leftovers so I use them to make quesadillas the next day! I get requsets for this recipe everytime I make it and best of all rav reviews! I do the whole recipe in my slow cooker and cook on high for a minimum of 5 hours, then shredd the meat and cook for another hour. I also finely chop an onion and 3 garlic cloves and add in at the beginning of cooking. Thnak you for sharing this, it has definately become one of my favorites!

I feel bad even reviewing this because I pretty much changed everything. BUT the idea of a non fried shredded beef chimi was great! I pressure cooked my meat with jalapenos, poblanos, onion, garlic, beef broth, a little canola oil and red wine. I also added very small diced potatos after the meat was cooked. Instead of baking these, I just pan fried them in a little butter like you would a quesidilla. Thanks for the inspiration, great recipe, will make again and again.

WOW! Flavor was great and the texture of a crispy tortilla was perfect. I made these with chicken and brushed tortillas on one side with melted butter, baked at 500 for 10 mins, simply awesome.

The meat came out really moist and was easy to shred. I added onion and 2 garlic cloves to the liquid  to kick up the flavor. My kids and husband loved it.  I will definitely make again. Served Spanish rice along side.

I cooked meat in the crock for 11 hours on low.  Left out the 1/4 c water, but it was still too liquid-y, even after the meat sat in the fridge overnight.  Put cheese in with meat in tortilla.  Edited:  Made again with just 1 cup beef broth.  Still liquid left, so I just pulled the roast out to shred it, then used the liquid to cook up some rice, then added sour cream, and had a Mexican side dish.  Meal is still very well loved by the family.

This was awesome.. I only gave 4 stars since I did change it a little since it needed more flavor. I browned the roast in a skillet. I cooked it in a slow cooker on High about 3 1/2 to 4 hrs. I followed the measurements exactly except I omitted the water.. it does not need it. Instead I pureed a can of Rotell & added it to the recipe. I also added a lil pinch of minced garlic & a 2 slices of minced onion. & 1 jalapeno pepper & (removed the seeds) I had to drain the meat it was a little watery... this was porbably from the Rotell so maybe next time i will drain it. The other change I did make was I added mexican blend cheese in the tortilla & added the meat rolled up like a chimichanga & stuck a tooth pick through them & used tongs to deep fry them. some Pepper Jack velveeta on top & poured enchilad sauce over & baked at 375 till melted! My hubby said it was the best thing he has ever tasted!

Like "somethingdifferentagain?!" noted in her review, I also used just the process of the melted butter on the flour tortillas and baking in the oven on high heat.  What a great idea! I used turkey, cilantro, both cheddar and Queso Fresco cheeses, and served these with fresh guacamole and Spanish rice. REALLY good, thanks. I'll be using this again for sure!

My family & I love the Mexican resturant, but it's 25 miles away. Chimichangas are my sons favorite. The ladies of my extended family spend a weekend each year together cooking and  crafting. This years theme night was a Mexican Fiesta. This recipe was a hit with my guys when I did a trial run and it was a hit with my ladies. I kinda missed the crispy edges you get when they are deep fried and if you like it a little spicy, try adding a can of chopped green chilies.  I used my slow cooker and the meat was tender and very flavorful. Even the older generation of ladies in my family that didn't know much about Mexican food enjoyed these smothered in cheese sauce, salsa and sour cream.

Excellent and YUM! I hate frying food. Not just 'cause it's bad for you, but mostly because I never learned how to use a fryer and am secretly ashamed to admit that. But, I love chimis an am happy to indulge if someone else is standing over the vat of scalding oil. That said, these are an excellent restaurant-ish recreation, minimal butter and super-high temps created a perfectly crispy shell and the meat tasted fabulous! I used all ingredients/measurements as written but threw it in the crockpot for 8 hours on low. Thank you!

It was good. Did it in a crock pot. The meat, I thought, was a little bland so I seasoned it before wrapping it. Glad I made guacamole because the sour cream and tomatoes didn't do it for me. The guacamole made it great!!

Family loved these! Of course I can't follow a recipe to the tee so I made a few changes...I cut up my roast into 2 in chunks and placed in crock pot with broth ( I added enough to cover meat), red wine vinegar, chili powder, cumin, onion and garlic, garlic salt and pepper and cooked on low for about 6 hrs. I shredded the meat & added a little of the pan juices & placed in tortilla with jack/cheddar cheese and I fried mine (my husband says everything is better fried!). I then took the leftover juices from the crockpot and cooked white rice in it...yummy! This recipe is definitely a keeper.. I will make a bigger batch next time!

Wow this is soooo delicious!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added garlic and onion to the meat.  I also cooked the meat in the slow cooker and added a bit of extra beef broth.  I shredded the beef after about 6 hours on low, put it back in the juice, and let it soak it up for another few hours.  I used 6 soft taco size shells and added cheese to the inside of each.  I took the advice of another reviewer and made her recipe for brown chipotle sauce which was the magic touch on this recipe!  Here it is:  2 T butter 2 T flour 1 c beef broth 1 c water 1 t cumin 3 cloves garlic -- minced 1 t oregano 3 canned chipotle chiles -- seeded and minced (3 to 4) (These are not all that hot) 2 T adobo sauce from can 2 T sour cream.

With a little more broth and cooked in a crock pot the broth made a great gravy to put over the shells.   I don't have to go to the restaurant any more

My Family really liked this dish, I only added about half the chili powder that the recipe called for. I also poured some of the juices over the chimi's, that seemed to make it a little more flavorful,and  added shredded lettuce. Very Tasty. Next time will try it with Chicken. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Loved this with the changes I got from other reviewers.  Browned the meat as directed, then placed in crock pot.  Deglazed the brown bits with a splash of beef broth, then cooked some diced onions and garlic in canola oil in that same pot.  Added a can of Rotel to this and heated, then added it all to the crock pot with the recommended broth mixture.  5 hours later, used a slotted spoon to remove the meat, tomatoes, onions, etc, allowed to cool, and shredded it all together.  So flavorful!  Didn't really need any pan juices to keep it moist.  I did add a little cheese to the filling before rolling up the chimichangas.  Loved how fluffy and crisp the tortillas got baking in the oven.  Served with Mexican Rice II.  Deelish.  Will definitely make again!

baking not frying is brilliant and produces a crisp tortilla to compliment the soft meat - I made two changes; I used pork roast instead of beef and I made congri (a type of black beans and rice) to go with the pork- topped with sour cream and salsa with a congri side made a great, hearty meal

Medium heat was way too hot.  All of the water burned off after 20 minutes, and after an hour, the rest of the seasonings and the meat were burned to a crisp. Disappointing, because it looked so tasty.  Might try using the slow cooker, if I ever decide to try this again.

This recipe was great. I added onions (1 meduim, chopped) and garlic (2 cloves, chopped). I also added salt to taste. I used the slow cooker and cooked it for about 3 hours on high and chopped my meat instead of shredding it. It really was delicious though. My husband and son loved it too. I will be making this again!

My family loved this recipe and it was super easy to prepare.  I made mine in my crock pot and didn't even bother with the oven.  Next time I will season the meat with salt and pepper before I cook it because it wasn't salty enough for us.  We also added hot sauce to taste and paired it with Mexican Rice.

The base of this was great but for my family I added a bit of flare! I dressed up the filling by adding refried beans, shredded roast, and black beans. I then rolled and placed in a 450 degree oven for 10 min. Just before I took them out I topped with cheese. I also made Cowboy Mexican Dip and used it as a Chimi Topping. My family went nuts! It was soo wonderful. Enjoy!

Fantastic! I put all the ingredients in the slow cooker and added a little garlic because I love that flavor and when the meat was done I put the chimichangas in the oven. They were great baked. In a few I put black beans & meat and they came out fantastic too.

okay, so I cheated, I used a different recipe for the beef, but still used the technique in this recipe and LOVED it!  I didn't even miss that it wasn't fried!  Can't wait to make this again!  :)

Wonderful!  I made these with leftover meat from a pork shoulder and added a can of green chilis.  I had no idea that they could be this crispy from the oven, but they turned out perfect!  Plus much less greasy than deep frying.

Very good! I made the meat in the slow cooker by putting the roast, broth, red wine vinegar, and spices (I added oregano and some ground ancho chilis) in all at once and then cooking for 8 hours on low. Skipped the first step of browning the meat. I did not brush the tortillas with melted butter to save on calories. Instead I assembled the chimichangas, then sprayed a little cooking spray on them. They crisped up beautifully. Thanks :)

Like some others, I only used your baking method for making the chimichangas as I already had Mexican shredded beef I had to use up, but we absolutely loved.  What a simple easy way to change-up an everyday burrito.  Thank you so much.  I simply used my Misto to spritz olive oil on the outside of the shell - it crisped up beautifully.

Made this today and it was wonderful!!!  Very easy to make. I will make a few changes, adding some queso blanco or monterrey jack cheese, some salsa and onions. I loved the taste of the baked tortilla! This will also be good making it with either chicken or pork.

I took other reviewers suggestions and added some sauteed onions, garlic and 1/2 a jalapeno to the cooked, shredded meat.  It was a little spicy, but pretty flavorful.  I also added some shredded cheese to the mixture before makeing the chimichanga.  It made 7 servings with approx. 3 oz. of meat for each.  However, if you are looking for something that is "weight watcher friendly", this is not your dish. With reduced fat sour cream, it is about 13-14 pts.

I found this recipe to be very tasty! I had never had chimichangas before, so I'm not sure how this compares to the restaurant version.
I followed what someone else said and added an onion and 3 garlic cloves to the seasoning, and I cooked it in the crock pot for about 5 hours, shredded it, then cooked it for another 45 minutes.
I also substituted chicken broth for the beef broth, since that's what I had, and I added more salt. 
Final verdict: I would make this again :)

This is sooooo good! I had 3lbs. of stew meat I needed to use so adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. We used the filling for burritos. Everyone loves this and I will be making again soon.

I have made this numerous times and is currently my favorite dish!  Being a busy working mom, I follow the recipe but cook the beef all day in the crock pot and the beef just falls apart, so shredding beef is a breeze.  We top the Chimichangas with green enchilada sauce and a dab of sour cream.  Absolutely fantastic.  These also reheat in the microwave fine for my taste so leftovers don't go to waste!!

The crust never really crisped up for me, but the meat filling was good. We did have enough for leftovers later in the week and just served in  soft flour tortillas and made it like a taco. I did it in the crock pot for convenience.

One of our favorites!  All of us go back for more!  I cook it differently, though... I put all ingredients (beef, water, broth, vinegar, chili powder, and cumin) in the croc pot in the morning and cook it on low for 8 hours so that it's ready by the end of the day.  The meat turns out tender, juicy, wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe... we us it all the time!

VeryTasty, I added onion & garlic pouder and some hickory smoked jalipeno peppers that I dried, I skiped the first part and just put it in a crock pot on high for about 3 hrs. then on low for another 3 hrs. till the meat shreaded with 2 forks... It takes some time but it was better than any Mexican joint that we have gone to... Take the time and be creative when wraping, place some cheese in the center of a 10in. wraper top with meat no more than what the wraper will cover when you bring 1 edge over to center, rotate a little and fold top edge to center, repeat until you have a 5 sided peace. I brushed mine with spiced oil (EVOO chili  garlic onion cumin pouders ect.) to taste and baked at 450 10-15 min. You can even finish on a grill insted of baking...

I had left over brisket that I needed to use, and this was a great way. I loved that brushing the tortillas with butter and baking them produced such a crispy shell, without all of the grease of frying. Didn't lessen the fat count, but it didn't taste greasy at all. Great recipe!

We tried this recipe with some taco seasoned ground beef only because we were short on time.  It was much quicker and very delicious!  (We look forward to trying the recipe as it reads another day because if our quick fix was good:  The shredded beef with only make it sooo much better!)

This was just ok; don't think I would make it again.  It is missing something but I'm not sure what.  I ended up adding 1/2 of a burrito seasoning packet before serving to add a little flavor.

This was a great starter for me.  I tweaked it for my own needs, and it works well for many different things!  I use the crock pot from start to finish on this one, love the smell throughout the day, and less work for me!

My family absolutely loves these.  I've made them several times.  I take a roast and cook it all day long with green peppers and the spices recommended.  I am so thrilled to have found this recipe and method.  It can be used for so many other types of meats and spices!  Thank you!

This was great after a few modifications...After reading other reviews, I added some garlic, Southwest Seasoning and Chipotle flavord Tabasco to the meat while cooking.  I just used about a pound of some cheap chuck steaks I found one sale.  I cooked it overnight, 12 hrs +.  It turned out GREAT!  While assembeling, I added finely diced onions, MORE SW seasoning, and MORE Chipotle Tabasco (it's AWESOME if you haven't tried it!) and added the cheese inside as well.  I cooked it til brown & crispy and then added some more shredded cheese (including Cheddar) to the top and let it melt.  I DRIZZLED some of the sauce from the meat over the top and served it atop a little salsa with the shredded lettuce and tomatoes on the top.  It looked so pretty!  Like restaurant food!  They seemed just a WEE bit dry, so I might add some sauce from the meat to the meat mixture inside.  I wasn't cooking them right away and was afraid they would become soggy if I did that initially.  I also served it with guacamole along with the Sour Cream.  They were great!!  Something a little different and will make again!!  Thank you :)

WOW! This was so good my family fought over who got to take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I took the easy road and dumped all of the ingredients into the crockpot, crocking it on low all day. I didn't melt the butter for the tortillas--instead I spread it on there and let it melt in the oven. I put cheese inside the chimichanga instead of the outside, and it worked out great.

I will be making this again soon!

Wow these were great! I used a leftover post roast and just shredded the meat and let it simmer in the sauce until most of the juice was absorbed. I then panfried in a little oil. Declicious! My one year old and husband both gobbled them down.

They turned out great and were delicious. I subbed red wine vinegar for just red cooking wine, as some people tend to find the vinegar version to make the meat a little bitter.

I made this according to the directions and it turned out great.  I strained the broth at the end, added the solids to the meat mixture.  To the strained broth I added sour cream and some cornstarch to thicken.  I added some of the thickened broth to the meat mixture before assembling the chimichangas.  After turning off the oven, I topped each with cheese, placed back in the oven to melt, then topped with the thickened sauce.   Perfect!

5 stars for method.  2 stars for flavor.  The beef really needs some help.  Next time I'll add onions, oregano, bay leaf and some diced green chiis.  DH loved it as is.  Served with sour cream, lettuce, salsa and guacamole.

I did change a few things because I always make-do with what is in the kitchen. I cooked a tough roast in the crockpot all day, then shredded it into a bowl. While it cooled, I sauteed a bunch of chopped kale, red onion, and garlic on the stove. When it was soft, I added the spices and the broth per the recipe. I added this mixture to the shredded beef and followed the recipe from there. My kids LOVED this, and said it is better than our favorite Mexican restaurant. It certainly is healthier!

I added salt, pepper, garlic, onion, & cayenne. I felt it was still missing something but not sure what. My whole family ate this up so I'll be making this again.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed these. Next time I make them I will add a little more spice to them and put some beans in with the beef. I also enjoyed the fact that they were not fried and fairly easy to make.

This recipe was pretty bland.  I added green chilies and 3 garlic gloves to the mixture while it cooked in the crock pot but it was still bland.  One night I tried them baked then a few nights later I fried them in oil with still disappointing results.

I made this two weeks ago... Mmm Mmm delicious!  I didn't have any chili powder, so I used a little bit of Cayenne pepper instead.  It still came out great!  I used a side of light sour cream and homemade salsa.  They were flaky and crispy, just the way I like them.

My husband raved about this one.  I did this in the crockpot and after adding some green chilies and shredded cheese to the filling, we  wrapped the tortillas up and pan fried in butter. For us, the frying in butter is what really topped it off!!!

Fantastic! great way to use left over roast and a great addition to taco night.  I love not frying but baking instead.  They came out crispy and flavorful.  Did not change a thing.

i changed it up a little.. first i took a 3 pound roast and cut it into slices, put it into a slow cooker/crockpot with 2 family size taco seasoning mixes and almost 2 cups water. cooked it on high for 5-6 hours till meat just fell apart. took out of crockpot, minus juice/sauce. shredded meat.  then went with prep of flour tortillas as in recipe. added shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese inside, then folded them.. tasted much better! i do the same thing if i make shredded bbq beef or pork sandwiches.. instead of the seasoning, i put meat in with water , salt and pepper. cook as above.. shred meat drain water, annd bbq sauce to meat and heat through!!.  taste just as good as the prepared bbq shredded beef or pork you buy in the store.

This was very good.  Changed things but only because I found this recipe after The roast was already cooked.  Used taco sesoning which is pretty much chili power and cumin anyway.The real treat was the cooking method for the shells.  Was like they just came out of the deep fryer.  Thanks for sharing this.  We will have it again.

Well, I had to make some modifications based on what ingredients I had on hand, but the end result was delicious.  Earlier this week, I made the shredded beef in my slow cooker by sprinkling a packet of dry beefy onion soup mix over the roast and pouring about 1/2c water and 2-3 tablespoons BBQ sauce in with it.  6 hours on low and it was delicious just as it was for sandwiches.  For the beans, I made my own refried beans by combining butter, salt, cumin, water, and black beans in a small saucepan and cooking till they turned into paste.  I also made a white cheese sauce to top the chimis, by making a basic bechamel sauce and adding white cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, and paprika.  These were FANTASTIC.  My husband, who is not a fan of Mexican food, loved these when prepared this way.  I love crispy chimichangas but usually when I get them in a restaurant, they are full of grease and I get a stomach ache after eating them.  These had the same crunch as restaurant style chimis, without the grease.  Excellent.  Will definitely make again.

Enjoyed these very much. I had leftover shredded beef from ropa vieja recipe so the hardest part was brushing the butter on both sides of the tortilla. Which of course was not hard at all. Baked in the oven and turned over when bottom side browned to evenly brown both sides. I also put a tbs. or two of refried blackbeans in with the beef. Thanks for the great recipe.

Very tasty.  I found that cooking them with a bit of butter left them a bit dry.  So, I put about a 1/4 inch of oil in the bottom of my baking pan, put that in the 450 degree oven to heat up.  Then I placed the Chimichangas in the oil to cook.  The result was much closer to a restaurant version of crispy deep fried chimis

Good recipe, makes a ton.  Don't make too much because if you premake the whole thing and don't eat it then the left overs are horrible.  No one ate the leftovers.  Fresh out of the oven is great.  Don't make what you can't eat that night.

This was so good and so much fun to make.  I had a cheap beef roast and just decided to try this recipe.  I added a little more chili powder (just to taste).  I figure everyone needs to adjust this to their tastes.  Also, I put shredded cheese inside before I rolled them up.  Served with some refried beans and cheese.  Wow!  Throw in some tortilla chips and salse and it makes for a wonderful movie night with the kids.  Thanks so much for submitting.

My husband and I were not fans of these shredded beef chimichangas.  He'll typically eat just about anything I make, and we both love tex-mex, but he specifically requested that this recipe get thrown out.  The flavor of the beef was decent, but the recipe is just missing something.  Baking the chimichangas left them tough and chewy, not crispy and crunchy.  Perhaps with some cheese melted in with the beef they could be better, but I don't see myself ever using this recipe again and finding out.

I really liked this recipe, the only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I will probably make some adjustments next time. When I made it this time I didn't add the vinegar at all. The next time I make this, I may be tempted to saute some green peppers and onions (from my garden) and throw that into the shredded beef. Also, next time I thought about adding the cheese to the shredded beef just before filling the burrito shell. I will probably use more cheese than I did this time. Other than that, it had an excellent flavor and my family devoured it. I will be making this again!

I made this with whole grain wheat tortillas, and yes, they were a little dry, but the beef in this was so tender and yummy! We all just loved it and my kids even gobbled it up. My hubby liked enjoying an 'authentic mexican dish' at home.

The flavor was great and I am thrilled that I did not have to fry these.  The only room for improvement would be in the tenderness of the meat.  I'm going to try to make these again with exactly the same ingredients, but cook the meat in a slow cooker for increased tenderness and moisture.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were so good, the meat was super tender and so easy to shred.  I made them for my friend when she came to visit and she was really impressed.  I added a few cloves of garlic and one onion to mine, it was great!

This was Terrific! Even better beef recipe than the restaurant I go to here in Palm Beach County, FL. I used the first six ingredients to make the beef of this, and combined it with Casey's (from 'Top Chef') Quesadilla recipe to make some sensational Burrito's! I put 3 type's of cheese on them and baked them a few min's at the last for it to melt. Her recipe has a tomatillo salsa that was out of this world, and with this beef, it was definitely 5 stars! Thanks!

My family and I absolutely loved this recipe!  Superb taste that even the kids loved.  I loved that I didn't have to deep fry them and they still tasted terrific.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, Helena.  I will be making this recipe again soon.  Definitely worth 5 stars!

This is a wonderful recipe, and it's so easy to make.

I did make a few modifications however.  I put the beef chuck and the wet ingredients (including spices) in a crock pot, so I wouldn't have to mess with it.  The meat came out so tender when cooked on low for about 8-9 hours.

I also used sharp cheese with Jalapenos in it. That really added to the flavor. Instead of putting the cheese on top, I put it inside, and it melted nicely.

Finally I chopped lettuce and tomatoes and spread them on top of the chimichangas.

Delicious!

We have left over meat, so I'm going to turn that into burritos for tomorrow's dinner.  This recipe makes HUGE portions.  Enjoy!

My husband liked this better than I did.  I thought it was ok, maybe I was looking for a different flavor.  However, this does have a lot of flavor.

Other than the time spent shredding the meat, this is an easy recipe that I make every month or so. My husband really likes this one, and it's one of a very few roast beef recipes I like also.

The beef for this was very good.  I cooked them as suggested in the oven, which was very good, but I think next time I will deep fry them, to give them a more authentic taste.  Thanks for the recipe

My husband made it and used LARGE tortillas.   He loved the seasoning of the meat. 

I personally would stick to the 8" and am going to try putting the cheese inside

We felt the meat needed more flavor. Next time will add onions, peppers and more spice while cooking it.  It was terrific not frying the burritos.

My family loved this recipe. I cooked it in cast iron, added chopped onion and garlic,  and only half of the chili powder.  It is super tender and great for street tacos and enchiladas as well. Definitely a keeper!

These turned out great!  I changed it up a bit.

Actually no I didn't, that's what other people do just so they can give their own Frankenstein version 5 stars, which I find obnoxious.  This 5 stars goes to the recipe poster.

I put half of onion quartered in my roast as it cooked. Also put 2 tablespoons of hot salsa in the shredded beef instead of chili powder.  It was amazing.  Will definitely  make again.

I made this according to the directions, and it turned out really good! The only item that I changed was I used butter flavored pan spray instead of melted butter on the tortillas, and it worked very well. I topped it with sour cream and sliced jalepeno's, I am in the process of making it again, but this time I have added fresh minced garlic and diced some jalepeno's to the pot while it was cooking.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used white wine vinegar and I didn't have monterey jack so I used some mozzarella and cheddar that I had on hand. Also I put that inside of the chimichanga as another reviewer suggested. Other than those steps I followed the recipe exactly rest of the steps exactly and it was amazing. I served it with refried beans, guacamole and white cheese dip from this site, which was also amazing.

I made this in the instant pot, and it was a huge hit with my family.  I seared the roast then poured the water/broth/vinegar and spices over.  Cooked on high pressure for 30 minutes (probably could have shortened this), natural release.  Removed meat and shredded, also removing excess fat before returning to pot.  Turned  saute on high to boil juices, added meat back in for several minutes, then turned to slow cook for a couple of hours.  The flavor was good, but dramatically improved by slow cooking until juices were almost gone and adding some salt.  I love the bake at high temperature option to make these a little healthier.

Although not traditionally Mexican food, we love chimis and crispitos ( cigar shaped chicken filled, flour tortilla, fried snacks).  I have my own recipe but I like to see what others are making.  I will add oregano to this and fried onions.  Looks delicious !

Had to simmer an extra hour to get the meat tender. Tasted after 3 hours, very bland. Added onion, garlic and a can of Rotel tomatoes. This helped the overall flavor. Made as noted tasted like an unseasoned roast. Would not make again.

The family loved the Beef Chimichangas.  I did as some garlic and onion to it which really brought out the flavor.  In stead of frying in it oil I used by air fryer and it really came out nice and crispy on the outside.  My son already ordered it again for his birthday.  Said it was the best he has ever had.

The meat definitely doesn't taste like it should go into a chimichanga or anything Mexican for that.  Wish I would have just used plain taco seasoning, this tastes more like a meat for a stew.

Everyone in my house loved it. This recipe is a keeper.  It was fantastic as written but next time I am going to add a bit more broth and vinegar and cook it an extra 30-60 minutes (hopefully the meat will get a bit more tender.) I was skeptical about baking these but they crisped up very nice!

This is a very tasty dish! I made it and got great oohs and Ahs at the table! I put butter and a bit Of olive oil in a skillet instead of brushing tortillas , both sides and onto baking sheet, less time consuming!

I've made this recipe several times with some Mexican rice on the side and it's always a hit! I make them rather large so we have leftovers for lunch the next day. This is one of my favorite recipes.

First attempt at shredded beef chimis & I really liked it! I agree the spices are very basic and allow room to doctor up a bit, which I did. Used my pressure cooker for the beef & froze the leftover meat and cheese to make quick meals later! My kid liked the beef in his cheese quesadillas. I will make this again and add extra seasoning/onions to the roast.

What this recipe needs is a bottle of green chili salsa, AND a can of chopped peppers.  You do not need that much cumin if you buy it from Penzey's in AZ.  That is so fresh, it makes a huge difference.  Love these in Utah

Taking the advice given in other reviews, I really tweaked the beef, adding onions and garlic and doubling the spices. 
Interesting technique for the tortillas, came out nicely crispy, but not too hard

Loved this!  I created my own filling with what I had on hand, so basically I just went by the cooking technique.  It came out crisp and not burnt.  A great new way to have a mexican meal on the quick.

Very good. We also added onions and 3 garlic cloves and used 8 8" flour tortillas instead of just 4.

DH really like this recipe, and that's saying a whole lot!  The only change in the beef was to add a chopped clove of garlic to the Dutch oven.  And I served it with Tomatillo Salsa Verde from this site.  Wonderful!

I made these tonight--WONDERFUL!!!  I did add a little bit of onion & garlic powder, salt & Emeril's Southwest Seasoning.  I browned it in the dutch oven then transferred it to the crockpot for about 4 hours on high.  I added the cheese to the shredded meat mixture and fried in Crisco.  Everyone loved it, my 5 & 9 year olds and my husband!  I sereved it with jalapeno cream cheese to dip it in!!!  YUM!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I'll give this my husband's rating, although mine probably would have been 3 stars. If I make this again I'll use a little less chili powder and a little more cumin powder. I did as another reviewer did, and cooked the meat in a pressure cooker - really saved time with this. I also added cheese inside the chimichangas as well as on the outside. Maybe a sauce on top (other than salsa) would have made it better.

My family really liked these.  They do need a green chili or something on them.  I did put the meat and the broth all in the crockpot in the morning and about 3 in the afternoon I transferred it all to the stovetop, and boiled it down until the meat was still juicy but the liquid was all gone.  The meat was tender but not dry.  VERY good flavor!

Very good!  I was nervous at first because I cooked my meat in the crock pot and it smelled awful for the whole 6 hours, but surprisingly, the end product was delicious!!  I added refried beans to the tortillas with the meat and they were very filling.  I don't think there's anything I can do about the smell, since I followed the ingredients to a T, but I will be making this again for sure!

We liked these! I had some left over beef roast that was way too salty, so I mixed in a can of beer, 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning, and some tomato sauce.  Spooned into whole wheat tortillas, sprinkled about 1 Tbsp cheese, and then folded into pockets. I placed mine seam down on a greased jelly roll pan. I spooned melted butter only over the tops of the tortillas. It worked great! They baked at 500 degrees for more like 13-14 minutes.

Very good. Added green chili's, garlic and onion for a little more flavor. Turned out nice and crunchy after baking, which is a better alternative to frying.

Easy and good.  I made just as stated, and it turned out just right on the spices. Update: I made this with a cheap bone-in pork roast and that was just as good as the beef with no changes to the spices.

These were really tasty, and I loved that they were lower fat than fried chimichangas!  They had plenty of crunch without being tough.  I used leftover beef, chopped and mixed with salsa for the filling, but other than that I followed the recipe.

My husband really liked this recipe, whereas I thought it was ok.  However, I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I had already cooked my roast in the crock pot and just put it on the stovetop with the seasonings and broth.  I didn't have cumin on hand, so I added some southwest seasoning.  I also added a little garlic and onion powder as I thought it needed something extra.  I put cheese in the beef mixture and put in a skillet on the stovetop to brown.  Then added cheese on top and put under the broiler for a few minutes.  
It was a nice change from italian beef or roast, but not sure I will do again as it wasn't a wow recipe to me.

I followed the recipe as stated. I believe that it should have you turn the heat lower after you add the beef broth and spices. I ended up having to add 2 cups more water to keep the meat from burning on Med. heat.
I did not feel that the flavor was very Mexican. I believe that it needed more spice such as Mexican Oregano, Cilantro and additional Cumin. 
I did like the oven chimichanga part and felt that it was easier and healthier than frying them.

My husband's actual quote was, "best new recipe of the year."

I cooked my meat in a crockpot on high for 7 hours and put cheese inside the chimis before I put in the oven.

Not too bad. The meat didn't have as much flavor as I had anticipated.  I used my pressure cooker to brown the meat and cooked it in the juices.  If I make this again after cooking in the pressure cooker & shredding the meat I'd put everything in a pan and boil down the juices for a more concentrated flavor.  I may use taco seasoning as some others had suggested along with mixing some of the cheese in with the meat before putting in the tortillas. Definately a work in process, but it does give you something to work with.

These are delicious, thanks!  I liked that they are baked instead of fried yet you still get that crunchy outer shell.  Used leftover shredded beef which added a great flavor.   Thanks!

Great! Everyone one loved this recipe. I did salt and pepper the roast as it cooked.  I also added garlic and extra chili powder and cumin to our taste.  I loved the crispness of these.

Everyone loved this one!  Probably a pressure cooker would make it quicker and juicier.  Going to try that next time.  I will make these frequently though.Wonderful!

A bit flavorless compared to restaurants. Will try again with chicken or shrimp.

I didn't give this a star rating, as I used a different filling recipe. I just wanted to say how much we loved the baked chimichanga tortillas. They turned out crispy and flakey. After they finished baking, I brushed some of the browned butter from the pan onto them. Yummy. I'm going to try this will an apple cinnamon filling, too. Thanks!

The filling is delicious, and it's nice to have a change from ground beef. They're especially good with homemade tortillas.  They're usually a little thicker and puff a little when you fry them, so it adds a little more body to the dish.   My husband is a picky eater, even at restaraunts, and usually doesn't like shredded meat, so this was a fantastic find for our limited menu.

Not good. Maybe more liquid is needed to cook the beef, but I won't be making this again.

This recipe is ok, but I probably won't make it again.  The meat filling was a little dry.

I have tried to get some "restaurant" tasting mexican recipes and this was fantastic!  I had even gone to a cooking class for chimichangas and they were no where near as tasty as this recipe.  I used chicken breast meat and chicken broth/boulion cube instead of the beef.  My family loved it, even my picky eaters.  We fried the chimichangas instead of baking, either way great flavor is great flavor any way you cook it!

I wouldn't had added that much chili powder if I knew the beef would have tasted like that.  Next time I will only add half of the chili powder it calls for.  Other than that, they were good.
