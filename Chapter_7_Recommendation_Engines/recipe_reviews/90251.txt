This is tasty.  The only thing I did differently was I used regular hamburger, I do not like pre-formed frozen patties.

I thought this was very tasty...I added bacon and ommited the mushrooms.  My boyfriend loved it.  He was full from just the burger.

Good recipe.  I used leftover hamburger patties that had been cooked on the grill and they were really good. Super quick and easy!  My husband even liked them. I recommend trying this recipe.

Good hamburger.  I used fresh patties and we grilled them rather than the skillet method.  Didn't use mushroooms, as we don't care for them, but used everything else.  This was a good burger and hit the spot on a dreary, overcast, chilly Sunday afternoon.  Thanks Jessica for your recipe.

This is basically a mushroom burger, but I would not have thought of the ingredients had I not looked this up--thank you! Very good!

This was really good!  I used elk burger and added mayo, italian breadcrumbs and a little onion soup mix in the burger.  Followed everything else just added some salt and pepper / olive oil to the veggies.  I toasted french sliced bread.   Really yummy, easy and quick!

I made this using toasted Texas toast, and added spinach leaves. It was delicious & a real treat with my husband.
