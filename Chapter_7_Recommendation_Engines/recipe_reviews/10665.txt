Ok, I am angry. I wanted desert. It was cold outside. I didn't want to go out so I made something. This. And it was good. Now I know that I can bake, I am going to get fat. Seriously - really good cookies and I don't even like peanut butter. It was just the only thing in the house that could be turned into a cookie (my husband likes it).  PS: I didn't roll them in sugar - I ran out, but I did sprinkle a little confectioner's sugar on top once they were done. Pretty.

this is THE pb cookie recipe for me ... i love it!  it tastes just the way a peanut butter cookie should :)  if you want them to stay soft, freeze or refrigerate your dough before baking (and i mean, once they're on the sheets, not before shaping them.  just pop them into the freezer for about 5 minutes and then into the oven to bake.)  they stay really soft that way (as long as you don't overbake!)  if you like 'em crispy (like i do!), don't do that step.  anyway, great cookies!  last time i put reese's pieces and it added a nice chocolate touch without being overpowering.  also, it makes like 28-30 normal sized cookies (48 would be little bite-sized guys!)  Enjoy!

I tend to micro-manage my baking, I follow recipes exactly, measure painstakingly, and never leave the kitchen when something is in the oven. I have to be there for my baking in case anything happens, like spontaneous oven fires (none so far, but I have set MYSELF on fire. But that's a whole other story).   I followed this recipe exactly, but threw in choc chips. Actually, I gave each cookie precisely three chips. I long to be the 'splash and dash' kind of cook, but... The cookies survived my heavy handed directorship, and turned out delicious!  After experimenting with baking time I found 8 min to be perfect, soft but done. I also reduced the oven temp by 10 degrees, but only because my oven is an over-achiever where heat is concerned.   The recipe is easy and fast enough to whip up for sudden sweet cravings. Usually when I bake the aftermath is visible for days after, but these are bake-one-day-gone-the-next, and part of me is left wondering if it ever really happened. Then I notice my belly straining my pants and I know it was real.

Very good peanut butter cookies.
Cooked in 8 minutes though, got tough at 10 and burnt by 12.

The peanut butter flavour is too weak but not bad. The texture however is not good at all. I would not make these again.

These are delicious and soft! I added a little extra sugar because I used all natural peanut butter (to avoid hydrogenated oil.) I will definitely make again.

Wow. Totally wow. I'm used to peanut butter cookies being big crumbly things, but if taken out before 10 minutes, these are delightfully light and soft. My oven might be too hot, as the perfect batch came out at 7 minutes- after that they get more crispy-crunchy.

We have unsweetened fresh-ground peanut butter, so we used a tablespoon or so extra sugar. We absolutely enjoyed it being dipped in sugar; it tastes quite like a sugar cookie. If that is too sweet for you, then I'd recommend that you take the advice of some and not dip them in sugar. Also, we just put all the ingredients in at once: lazy chef certified!

These are great hot out of the oven.  Perfect peanut butter flavor and texture.  Mine did harden after a day or so, (still tasted great) but I think I overcooked them.  Will make again and shorten cooking time.

This would probably be a five star if I were to follow the recipe to a tee without any tweaking. I personally like my cookies chewy so with the cookies already shaped, I put the cookies in the freezer for ten minutes before baking. The first sheet was cooked as directed - for ten minutes. They came out good but crispy. The second sheet (same batch), I put in for nine minutes and it was perfect. For those of you having problems with flat cookies, it is because you are using old baking soda. Fresh baking soda will make all the difference. You can tell if your baking soda is old by taking a little bit and adding it to water. If it fizzes right away and well, then it's good. If you don't get any fizz, then throw it out and get a fresh bottle.

This is a good recipe. I added an extra egg and used 1 1/2 cup flour because I added 1 cup of peanut butter. The baking soda I mixed with that salt and about 1/2 tsp of water enough to get it runny and foamy then I put into the mix. Added some semi sweet chocolate chips I had and dropped the dough unto the cookie sheet.
Soft cookies finally a recipe for soft pb cookies. Use parchment paper helps a lot. Cooked for 10 minutes exactly.

I almost gave up trying to make pb cookies because I can never find a good recipe for them. After reading the reviews I decided to try this one. I am so happy I did! The only changes I made was adding 3/4 a cup of pb because I like mine a little richer, and I only cooked them for 8 minutes. They were soft and fabulous! Thanks so much Linda for submitting this recipe.

I was just short of a half cup of butter, so I added applesauce to compensate.  These cookies came out amazing.  If you add applesauce, I would also use a bit more flour, since there was no rolling my dough into balls.  I scooped up some dough, placed into a bowl of sugar and cookies&cream sprinkles that I had on hand, rolled it around, then gently placed onto the cookie sheet.  I had a hard time not eating it all as I worked with it!  I will definitely be making these again!

Delicious and soft -- I made them with almond butter instead of peanut butter; good either way (my impression is that it's better)

These turned out well but really aren't quite there. If the peanut butter and vanilla were both doubled, it would be perfect. I might make these into "sandwich" cookies with a peanut butter frosting to really make more of a peanut-buttery taste. NOTE: A tip for those who want the best peanut butter cookie outcome, don't skimp out and use store brand or cheap peanut butter. Your cookie will end up greasy and just.....not good. Use name brand peanut butter. Trust me.

(reviewed by my 14 yr old son) Fantastic, I skipped the final coating of sugar and instead added chocolate chips. The cookies I made were big and they cooked perfectly at 11 minutes. This is an easy recipe that would be great on any cold winter day.

Ok , i'm really not sure how these would have been good without all the additions i made!

I DOUBLED (at least) the amount of peanut butter. I'd say I used at least a cup/ cup 1/4 of peanut butter, i also added an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar and an extra EGG ( to compensate for all the peanut butter)

they came out pretty good. I can actually taste the peanut flavor, and putting them in an airtight container helped keep them moist. I'd definately NOT go by the recipe to the T though, add things of your own.

Best peanut butter cookies I've ever made, and probably ever had before.  My husband likes them.  I didnt bother sprinkling sugar on top.  They were sweet without it.  I did put one Ghiraldi natural White chocolate chip on the top of each cookie after I forked them down.  375 seemed like it was a little too hot for my oven.  I took them out at 10 mins and they were well browned on the bottom, but soft on top.  A couple more minutes may have burned the bottoms.  Oh, yes and I used white whole wheat flour and Florida Crystals sugar instead of white sugar and an energy egg replacer instead of real egg.  I replace with those in all my baked goods.  Yum, Yum....

Excellent! The husband highly approves of this recipe. The only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because I didn't have any baking soda on hand so I used 2 1/4 teaspoons of baking powder, which probably changed the outcome. I also used 3/4 cup of peanut butter and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.

I made these tonight.  Can't give 5 stars b/c I don't know yet how they'll hold up thru tomorrow.  I also didn't put in the Vanilla.  I wasn't sure if I wanted that much, if any.  They are wonderful without the vanilla!!  Soft, moist.  I baked for 9 minutes :) They are super sweet, tho.    This was my first time to make PB cookies from scratch.  Will continue to use this recipe as long as they're still good tomorrow :)

Very good recipe. They got bigger than I expected it. 
Here in Argentina, PB is expensive so I bough 250 gr. of unsalted peanuts, 2 tablespoons of oil and a pinch of salt. Put all that in the food processor and use 1/2 a cup for the recipe. Tastes great!

These were AWESOME!  I added some dark chocolate Hershey's baking pieces in the mix, which made them Irresistible.  :)  Great recipe!

Followed recipe just as listed.  The best, easiest, yummiest peanut butter cookie ever.  I did bake longer as we like a crispy cookie!  Thanks for sharing

Delicious! I found a big difference when baking on two different baking sheets. My insulated "cookie" baking sheet resulted in soft, crisp cookies and my regular baking sheet produced crunchy, slightly darker cookies, even though I baked both for 10 minutes. I got 20 cookies out of the recipe because I like them a little larger. Also I didn't use all of the sugar for decoration. Less than 1/4 cup was enough for 20 cookies.

I made these and they were great!  10 minutes baking time made a crispy cookie.  I kind of like mine a bit more chewy, so next time I will cook for 8 minutes.  Thank you for a flawless recipe!!!

Tasty BUT my cookies turned out very thin and a previous viewer is right- very weak peanut buter flavour.  They were okay.  Not awesome. I won't make them again.  3/5

These are great!  I use the new Skippy Peanut Butter that just came out without hydrogenated oil.  It is just as good as the "bad" peanut butter!  Everyone raved over these and I have to keep making them.  Yummmmyyyy!!!

I've used this recipe several times now, and my boyfriend just loves them. I don't bother rolling them in sugar. I prefer to use natural peanut butter which can change the consistency of the dough a bit, making it more slack, but I simply chill the dough for an hour or so before forming the cookies. Problem solved. Good simple recipe here that has come out well for me every time!

This is a great base recipe to work with if you are trying baking cookies from scratch for the first time (like me). I read a few reviews and based in some of the feedback I made a few tweaks. I used 3/4 cup of chunky peanut butter, added an additional 1/4 cup of flour and 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon just for a little spice. See, I love a peanut butter cookie that is soft yet has a light crisp when you bite into it, thats what I got with these. I also made a little dent in the center of a batch and added a bit of strawberry jam like someone suggested and they turned out lovely. I am now officially addicted to baking. Thanks for the recipe and helpful feedback!

I made this recipe 4 times, and shared these delicious cookies with as many people as possible (who keep asking for more).  It is the best p.b. cookie recipe I have ever tried. On the fourth batch, I put a tablespoon of my favorite mixed berry jam in the center of the cookies, and carefully enveloped the jam with the dough. The result was magical. And dangerous. I even forgot to press the cookies with the fork tines a couple of times. Still amazing. One difference - I didn't sift the flour. No sifter.  Can't wait to make them again!

Delicious cookies! I usually change recipes a good deal, but these were delicious just following the recipe! I promised my boyfriend cookies yesterday, and I have a cold so I didn't feel like going to the store for ingredients, so these were the perfect cookies for me. I had all the ingredients on hand! He says they're the best peanut butter cookies he's ever had! (He's a bit of a sweets connoisseur and my recipe guinea pig) 
Anyways, don't change a thing. Make them exactly as written- they're soft, delicious, peanut buttery goodness!

Very easy and tasty recipe as is.  I followed it exactly but made a double batch.  Last minute I decided to add a cup of mini semi-sweet choc chips.  Turned out wonderful.  10 mins exactly in my oven was perfect.  They're not hard but not soft really either.  Slightly crumbly, but that's how we like 'em.  I thought they were flavorful with the suggested amt of peanut butter.  Not bland at all.  Will keep to make again.  And I took pictures!!  Will post later :)

I tried this recipe and was not very happy with what I got. The peanut flavor was bland and and the consitancy was not right at all. Part of it could have been that I used no calorie sweetner and unsweetened apple sauce instead of butter (I was trying to make them for a neighbor who requested them) but I have never had problems with other cookie recipes before. However the biggest part was the flavor which was very weak.

These were by far the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made. The only changes I made were adding 3/4 cup chocolate chips and then I rolled them in a ball and placed them on the cookie sheet without criss-crossing them with a fork. They were soft and moist and didn't spread out flat like some recipes do.

Very tasty cookie. I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter cookies but my boyfriend loves them, so I made them for him. They were nice and chewy and I actually think the rolling in sugar makes the cookie.

These are fantastic. I like them much better than other similar recipes on this site. I added a little more peanut butter (maybe 1/8th cup more, but I didn't measure), and I chilled the dough in the fridge before baking.

Rave reviews on these cookies from all over :) I doubled the recipe and sent cookies to my neighbors. Everybody loved them. I over-cooked a batch in the middle but scaled back my time to just over 10 minutes per batch and they were perfect. Thank you for sharing!

this was a very easy to sue recipe and the taste is excellent. THis is just as good as any peanut butter cookie i have had and i am not much of a fan but really like these. Recipe is kind of sticky and hard to roll so i used just a little extra flour but i dont think that effected taste at all.

They were sooo good. I mean were because once they semi-cooled down they were all gone. I was alittle hesitant about adding the egg, simply because I don't like that "eggie" taste, but let me tell you, there was no "eggie" taste.  They were soft and tasted just like a pb cookie should. This recipe made it look like I have been making pb cookies for years. Thanx for this recipe. p.s I did put the dough in the fridge for like 1-2 hours, I think it helped...

Awesome cookies, but I do agree with the others, 10 + minutes is too long.  I would go with 8-9 minutes

A great cookie!  The only changes/additions I would make is to try using chunky peanut butter instead and a bag of peanut butter chips (or a cup of the chips, depending).  Those additions amp up the peanut-butter taste.

Excellent tasting cookies. Mine was a little soft because I used low sugar peanut butter, but I added extra flour without losing any of the flavor.

My peanut butter loving husband gave these a two thumbs up!  The only thing I changed is I lowered the oven temp to 350 degrees, which is the temp all my other favorite cookie recipes call for and only baked for 8 min. If baked according to the recipe, they would surely be overdone if not burned. FYI

These turned out wonderfully chewy with lots of flavour.  The only change I made was adding 1/4 cup of cornstarch to the flour - I do this with shortbread and it helps to keep them moist and melt-in-your-mouth cookies.  My family loves them and I will definitely make them again :)

LOVED THESE COOKIES!  I made them with butter flavored crisco instead of butter because I didn't want to wait for it to come to room temp.  I also shortened the cooking time to 9 mins.  They stayed soft and were almost gone within 24 hrs!

This recipe is wonderful.  Use a high quality peanut butter, and you'll get a high quality cookie.  After 12 minutes in the oven, they'll appear soft/undercooked.  But take them out of the oven and remove them from the cookie sheet (I used a baking stone).  Then, after they set, they'll be perfect.

Loved this recipe. They looked and tasted great. Except for the first batch, which I cooked for 11 minutes and came out too crunchy and brown. I cooked the rest for only 9 minutes, though, and they came out perfect- crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.

These are the best peanut butter cookies my husband and I have ever had! I have never been a big fan of peanut butter cookies before but after trying this recipe, I can't keep my hands off of them.

They will cook fairly quickly so I started using those thin aluminum cookie sheets you can buy from the grocery store because they won't hold the heat quite so much. The cookies seem to cook a little more slowly yet thoroughly and turn out so much better!

I guess I wanted to give it a 3, but I didn't because everyone has different taste and I don't want to "dog" someones recipe unless it's just not good. These were good, just not my kind of peanut butter cookie. They turned out thin & crispy. I like mine soft, a litte thicker, and a little chewier. Not bad, just not my style.

I baked this recipe both with and without the baking soda, but I personally prefer it much better without.  The cookies hold their shape and have a firmer (yet still VERY soft) texture.    So easy and tasty, everyone asks for this recipe!  Thanks!!

I was skeptical at first because the ingredients and quantities are very similar to my Betty Crocker cookbook.  But there is enough difference between the two to make this one taste much better!

These were excellent cookies! I say 'were' because they did not last very long with all the hands coming back for more. I can't say if they were soft the next day, as they were all gobbled up within 2 hours!  I didn't roll the cookies in sugar for decoration and they came out just as delicious! This is a definite keeper!

Delicious cookies. The dough was a bit sticky for pressing with a fork and they spread a lot when cooking.  Perhaps they need a bit more flour, or it may be due to me baking at high altitude.

Yummy! I'm glad I read the reviews before baking....the freezer trick worked! I also used Reese's Pieces in mine and they turned out fantastic.

Very, very good! I stuck the cookies in the freezer for 5 minutes before cooking. My first batch came out pretty flat but I took them out when they still looked gooey and underdone in the middle and this gave them a delicious affect when they had cooled -- delicately crunchy on the outside, chewy inside. My second batch I burned on the bottom a little and accidentally cooked longer than my first batch, but they came out bigger and puffier and still has that great crunchy-chewy-soft thing going on. What a great recipe! I'm so happy to have found a recipe that doesn't produce crunchy, hard cookies!

WOW! Amazing. My whole family agrees that these were the best PB cookies they had ever had. I refrigerated the dough for an hour, then put them on cookie sheets and made the marks on them with a fork. Popped them in the freezer on their cookie sheet for 5 mins, baked for 8 mins and they were PERFECT. yum yum!

Fantastic!  I used half butter and half margarine, ommitted the baking soda, added some chocolate/peanut butter chips.  Do not overbake them!  8 minutes in the oven and a couple minutes on the pan to cool produced a cookie that I was so proud of!

The cookies had an incredible flavor.  I put the dough in the fridge for about 20 minutes to make sure the cookies didn't flatten out during baking, and they came out puffy and chewy and just perfect.  Thank you!

OK so I’ve made these so many times now that I’m actually craving them! They are so good! I add Reesie‘s peanut butter chips just to take them over the top. Several people suggested refrigerating the dough and that makes a big difference.?

I liked that they come out soft and chewy - I don't like dry, crumbly peanut butter cookies but the flavour wasn't that great, certainly weak in the PB department.

Just fabulous! I used all brown sugar once, then went back to 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar as the recipe calls for. Also, when I substituted margarine instead of using butter, I lowered the oven heat to 350 degrees. 14 minutes and also made bigger drop cookies.

LOVE this cookie! I made no substitutions, but I didn't roll them in sugar. I used my small cookie scoop and got 27 cookies (about 2-3/4" after baking.) I baked them at 350 degrees for 9 minutes. They were perfectly done with a slight crispness, and just the right amount of peanut butter taste.

Good cookie. I added a heaping tablespoon or so more of the peanut butter. I'm keeping this recipe. Cooked them for right at 10 minutes. Perfect.

This is a good, basic peanut butter cookie recipe.  I think it is very close to the one I followed for years in the Betty Crocker cookbook.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion by freezing the formed and flattened cookies before cooking to keep them from spreading too much.  My family was very happy with these.

These were wonderful.  Not very peanut buttery, kind of like a sugar cookie with peanut flavor.  My family ate ALL of them in one night!  I may add a little more peanut butter next time, but no changes other than that.  Also, someone else said they overcook easily...very true.  Second batch was perfect.

Quick, easy, and baked up beautifully at 8 minutes/batch (as per another reviewer's suggestion) in my gas oven.

I would like more peanut butter flavor though, so next time may replace some butter with peanut butter.

These cookies are great!  I added my own little spin on them.  Instead of rolling the dough balls in white sugar, I used turbinado sugar (raw sugar).  I brought them to work and they are a huge hit!  The raw sugar brings a more complex flavor and provides crunch but not too much, yet the cookies are still soft and chewy in the middle.

I followed the rec. exacctly but they did not turn out. They tasted okay but got very thin and crisp. I turned down the oven and put them in the freezer before baking to no avail. Sucks! My little boy helped me and he thought they were great.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out great. I did notice that as I continued baking batches, I needed shorter cooking times. I think this is a combination of my oven and also the dough sitting out waiting to be cooked!  These were not too over powering and rolling them in the sugar helped add a subtle sweetness that I loved!  The cookies didn't seem overly moist (which is a problem with some other PB cookies I have tried)  Overall, these were very quick, simple, and delish!

I don't normally use any other recipe for PB cookies except my family's recipe.  This is a great recipe though and delicious.  Only thing is they were ready in 5 minutes.  Took the recommendation of one other person and set them for 5 minutes and they burned.  I do live at a very high altitude though and this might have had something to do with that.  Great cookies!

We absolutely loved these cookies! In fact, we made them 3 nights in a row!  My daughter made them for us. The first two batches were made with Smart Balance Crunchy peanut butter and were an absolute hit. The last batch was made with Aldi's creamy peanut butter.  I would suggest the Smart Balance Crunchy myself as it tasted more peanut buttery.  Either way it was all good.

I HAVE USED THIS RECIPE ABOUT 8 TIMES NOW AND I LOVE IT!!!!  I USE IT TO MAKE MY PEANUT BUTTER REESE'S CUP COOKIES.  JUST ROLL THE DOUGH INTO BALLS DROP IN A PAMED MIMI TARLET PAN BAKE ABOUT 12 MIN. THEN PUSH A MINI REESE CUP DOWN IN THE COOKIE PUT IN FREEZER TO COOL ABOUT 5-10 MIN.  THE TEACHERS REQUEST THEM ON A BI-WEEKLY BASIS...FOR THEM SELVES....LOL

I just made these peanut butter cookies today, and they are the best i have had ever, I have made peanut butter cookies in the past but i never rolled them in sugar. I think that give them a nice touch. Can't until after dinner so i can some pb cookies and a tall glass of chocolate milk. Yummy!! I did one change i added a extra tablespoon of peanut butter.

My son is severely allergic to eggs and nuts, so I substituted the eggs with egg replacer, and the peanut butter with soy nut butter. I shortened the baking time (based on other reviews) to 9 minutes, and they turned out perfect! There were just delicious - a little soft and chewy, but not too much, just like I remember them from my childhood!
Now we have a safe alternative to PB cookies in our house, that tastes just like the "real thing"!

Excellent flavor.  Not overpowering, Not underwhelming.  A great cookie.  Like many others, my baking time was a bit different as well as I've found with a good majority of cookie recipes.

Delicious, easy, and quick. Leave them in the oven for more than 12 minutes, to make sure they were cooked. I used chunky peanut butter, and added white chocolate chips for extra flavor.

Perfect!  Slightly crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I always add more salt and vanilla in any cookie recipe, and under bake by a minute or so.  These are great at 9 1/2-10 minutes.  I am making them to give away, so I was relived that they turned out so good.  The hubby thinks they are 'no good and should stay home'.

Love this recipe! I used muffin tins as one reviewer suggested and baked 8 min. For silicone muffin tins, it required 1 extra min for the same consistency.

These cookies were great! I followed the recipe except I added dream whip and added an egg and a teaspoon of vanilla to the package instead of milk and the cookies were very fluffy soft with a little crunch I baked the cookies for 12 minutes at 350 ...yummy with glass of milk!!

I love these cookies, I normally am not big on peanut butter cookies but these are the best by far. I was craving something sweet and had all the tings to make them and Im glad I did! I also only cook mine for 8 mins. Also depending on my mood I make larger than 1 in balls, those are bite size and sometimes I want a BIG cookie but of course that will make less. We make these a lot.

Now, I enjoyed the texture.  And the dough (which is my favorite part) but after they were cooked, the peanut butter flavor did seem a bit weak.  And after they cooled down they were REALLY crispy.  All in all, the recipe is good.  But if you're like me and enjoy a chewier cookie without having to use a slice of bread, or if you prefer more of a peanut butter taste, either tweak or don't use this recipe.  I think I will tweak this one in the future.

Quick and easy recipe!  I added chocolate chips (per my hubby's request) and they turned out very good.  I kinda wish they had more of a peanut buttery flavor though.  I cooked at 350 for about 8 or so minutes.

5 stars as they were so easy to make, and quite tasty. From reading the list of ingredients to putting the first hot cookie in my mouth was a total of 30 minutes! Incredibly quick and easy to make, and liked the flavour- if you like a strong peanut butter taste I recommend adding extra. They are lovely and soft, and very more-ish. If you want a crispy cookie, this is probably not for you. I recommend not tasting the batter, as it becomes difficult to stop eating it. The cooking time was a mystery to me- most reviewers say 12 minutes is too long, but I left mine in for about 14 and they were perfect. Could be because I use a mini oven, though.

I really liked these.  Could use just a little bit more peanut butter flavor, but otherwise very good.  Mine were just a tad bit overcooked by 10 min, but 9 was a little underdone.  Will definitely make again!

I didn't have any vanilla so I used 1/2 tsp. Almond extract. It gave them a really light almond flavor which I though was good. Next time though I would like to try them with the vanilla! Overall a very good peanut butter cookie!

This is a really good, moist cookie recipe!  There is one minor adjustment that I made - I turned the oven down from 375 to 350.  At 10 minutes they will look slightly underdone.  Let them cool for 3-5 minutes on the cookie sheet, then remove them to a cooling rack for another 10 minutes.  Cookies always continue to bake after they're first pulled from the oven.  This prevents over baked cookies!  This is the rule I follow when making all cookies and it works every time.

The Best PC ever!! I froze mine like the other reviewer suggested and I could easily eat the whole batch.  I made these for my daughter who's sick with the flu and won't eat anything.  However, she ate the whole cookie and rubbed her tummy when she was done and said "yummy mommy"  Thank you Linda!!

These cookies are very good - they come out soft and chewy. I didn't roll them in sugar and liked them better this way. If you're looking for an extra crunch, use crunchy peanut butter. This is not the most peanut-buttery tasting cookie ever, almost comes out like more of a sugar cookie, but delish nonetheless!

Rich peanut buttery cookie. Very tasty. These melt in your mouth. They didn't roll well in the sugar though, it was easier to do them the traditional way of dipping the fork tines in the sugar. I got 34 cookies from this.

I like pb, but not pb cookies, but I absolutely loved these cookies!  They are light and buttery with a great pb taste. I cooked them for 9 minutes and they cam out perfect.  I'll have to take a picture next time I make them, these didn't last long enough!

Needed a recipe without baking powder, which is why I choose this one. Very sweet, but I love sweet so I found the cookies good. Definitely moist and soft. Would definitely make again!

I love this recipe for peanut butter cookies, so does my GreatGrandpa and my dad! I tried using margrine instead of butter and they were okay, butter is the best way to go though if you want to make mouths water for more!

These are by far my favorite Peanut Butter cookies.  I use a counter top mixer to combine ingredients until they are stiff and then use a large melon baller to scoop them out on cookie sheets.  This gives the cookies a crispy outside and soft gooey inside. I cook them for 8 minutes as well.

People think I'm a genius because of these cookies.  I use CRUNCHY natural peanut butter (Trader Joe's, but Vons is actually the best in this recipe.)  I use unsalted butter and increase the salt to 1 tsp - use kosher salt if you can, it really makes a big difference, like sparkles of salt.  Remember that salt enhances flavors (peanut butter flavor, in this case.)  And DO NOT roll them in sugar.  It does indeed make them way too sweet, and covers up the taste of the peanut butter.

These are ok, but they're extremely sweet. They don't taste or look like a traditional pb cookie (they're much thinner), which is what I wanted. I'll eat this batch, but I won't make them again. They were bland, too.

Unremarkable. We enjoyed them but they did not have much flavor and they definitely did not stay moist in the air tight container. I will keep looking for a better recipe.

I was very nervous after mixing the ingredients of this recipe. I don't know about you guys but my dough was not a dough at all, it had the texture of cake batter. But, once baked, they were the best peanut butter cookies i've ever had! Although mine craked quite a bit on top and looked nothing like the pictures, they tasted amazing! Cookies stayed soft and chewy for days.

These were very good. Just be sure not to overcook. I did that with the last ones in, but then stuck a piece of bread in the container and soon they softened right back again.

These turned out excellent and were extremely easy to make! I used other reviewers suggestions and after putting them on the cookie sheet and pressed with the fork I put it in the freezer for 5 minutes. They turned out beautiful! Mine were ready in 9 minutes top!

These were pretty good flavor-wise, but they spread a lot while baking and they didn't stay soft after they cooled.  I was hoping for a softer cookie - thanks for the recipe, though!

Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Very delicious without an overpowering peanut flavor.  They did turn out a little flat, but I didn't mind after I tasted them!  I baked them 10 minutes.

These cookies were so soft, some of them fell apart when I put them on the cooling rack. But that's ok because I love soft cookies!

However, I did not get 4 dozen cookies from this recipe. I didn't eat any of the dough and got 27 cookies that were not large.

These cookies were very easy to make, and the cleanup wasn't bad.  The flavor was good and the texture was okay.  They weren't hard, but they weren't as soft as I'd prefer.  Overall it was one of the better peanut butter cookie recipe's I've tried!

A very slight taste of peanut butter, but all in all it was very good. I did refrigerate the dough and baked the cookies the next day. It was easier to roll and flatten.

Delicious peanut butter cookies with a twist, I used sugar free ingredients. The first time I made it, it only made about 24 small cookies.  I made it again but the second time, I doubled the recipe & made it with sugar free ingredients. I added 3/4 cup of extra peanut butter. I used Splenda brown sugar & white sugar. I rolled the balls in regular sugar so it didn’t have the sugar free taste to it. My husband loved them!

This recipe is very very good as is. I would give a few recommendations: You can bake this even at 360F for exactly 8 minutes.  I think it has room for decreasing the sugar depending on the kind of peanut butter you use and if you roll them in sugar. In therms of the peanut butter, try using one without added sugar. I did. It will adapt greatly and the flavors will be just right and balanced for the amount of sugar the recipe calls for. Will make it again!

Turned out nice and soft and tasted good. The only downside is I wish it had more of a peanut butter taste. Overall very good though.

Followed the directions exactly except used organic peanut butter which was a bit more runny, should have added more flour. Mine wouldn’t roll so just dropped okay a cookie sheet and baked barely 8 minutes.

I used this recipe a couple of times and it has quickly become the favorite cookie in my family.  It  doesn't have a strong peanut butter flavor nor does it taste overly sweet, especially since I skip last sprinkle of sugar. Perfect for our taste buds.

I'm lazy and always make cookie bars. line the pan with parchment, spread the dough out on shallow baking pan. 350F for 12 min. let it cool down gradually in oven. cut into squares when cooled.

I’ve been looking for a better pb cookie for a while now. This one is light and chewy. I doubled the recipe and added an extra egg with a bit of cinnamon (I believe cinnamon enhances the flavors) along with a cup of chocolate chips. I also only cooked 8 min. If you like a crunchier cookie, do the full time as stated. These will be my go to pb cookies from now on!

Delicious! I'll cut back on the salt a smidge next time. Either that or I'll try unsalted or low salt peanut butter.

PERFECT, Light cookies!
I would add to chill the dough overnight.
It made somewhat a difference in scooping.
Also, USE PARCHMENT PAPER if you're using the "ecko" style nonstick pans. Since these are sugar-covered, STICKING became an issue the first day I tried baking them off without it.

I made 4x the recipe and got about 14 dozen. Flat scooped with a small cookie scoop.

Excellent cookie. They were hard to keep around as everyone wanted to eat them.  Will make again and again. The only thing I did differently was to use Peter Pan’s honey roasted peanut butter which made the cookies a little sweeter, they were really delicious

Didn’t turn out as I hoped. The recipe doesn’t tell you to put flour on your hands in order to roll the dough into a ball for us beginners. I found the flavour very bland. It may taste great for some but for me, it didn’t work

So easy to make and much appreciated when peanut butter was the only flavor left to work with on a sub zero winter day...dwindling groceries...no one wanting to leave house!!! These were delicious.  100% family approved! Will definately make again!

Incredibly simple & absolutely delicious! I rolled some in sugar, some in cocoa powder & sugar, and topped some with chocolate drops to make peanut butter kisses.

Christmas cookie season is in, so I am making a variety of cookies for the family and the kids teachers. This was my 2nd one of the day- and another quick, easy, delicious recipe! Mine came out crispy, i was half hoping for soft/chewy, but crispy are great, just make more crumbs. They are really delicious though, and another kid approved!

I've tried many PB cookie recipes, this one by far is the best. Bake a little longer for crispy cookies, I like mine soft and chewy. This will hit both kinds of cookie lovers.

I had to add a bit more flour, and shortened the baking time to 8 minutes because I use a convection oven. They are delicious and soft, just how a peanut butter cookie should be.

I lost my old time favorite recipe for peanut butter cookies, and this one tastes just like the one I remember! Cookies came out perfectly even though I haven’t baked in a long time. Great recipe!

The only change I made was to bake for 7-8 minutes for 1 inch balls.  I baked the first pan for 10 minutes - not bad, but crunchy.  Other than that, great recipe.  Rich, flavorful cookie!

My boyfriend is allergic to peanut butter and I tried this recipe substituting it with sun butter and it did not turn out well. It’s too oily  and I had to add LOTS of flour to help stiffen and it dimmed the flavor down a lot.

Wonderful simple and delicious recipe. I made some modifications as suggested. I added extra 1/2 cup of flour and peanut butter. About 4 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream and water mixed together. I place though in the freezer for 10 minutes. I made 1/2 of the batch with cocoa powder, and added confectioner sugar on top of cookies. Baked for 9 minutes.

The flavor was ok the third time out of the oven, I think the temp is set too high, or time factor too long I put in 375 oven for 10 min, then 9 min and 8 min the last was better but I was out of batter and the first ones burned and I was doing 2 sheets at a time, I had double recipe, has anyone got a suggestion?????? Thanks

I made it after craving peanut butter cookies and they came out delicious.  I went according to the recipe and made 2 1/2 dozen.  it was so warm and surprisingly not too sweet.  It was thinner than I expected, but it has a lot of flavor.

I made them, and the cookie dough was very thick. I first thought I missed an ingredient. But in the end, they were dry and slightly over cooked. I don’t think it was the recipe, probably just me. Overall I would not make these cookies again, but not really because of the recipe.

Fabulous pnutty cookie!!!  Of course, being the baker that I am, there were some changes made, but only for my preference...  First off, I did not roll in sugar... just not my thing.  Secondly, I added 1 cup of creamy pnutty, 3/4 brwn sgr, and 2 tsp nilla.   And finally, I played with baking times a bit...  8 min gave a super soft, little gewy center.  10 min on metal pan gave a perfect soft nutty cookie.  12 min on baking stone gave the same as the metal pan.  I used the pumpkin stencil of my cookie press, which produced fantastic holiday cookies!!  (the batter is PERFECT consistency for successful stencils)  Will absolutely be using this as my "go-to" pnutty cookie recipe!

I have made this recipe countless times.  Always comes out good.  I used my mini muffin tins, sprayed them with Joy baking spray, spooned cookie dough in to them and baked as directed in recipe.  When they come out of oven, I filled the depression that forms with jelly or preserves.  Just a twist on the classic peanut butter cookies.

These are just like the peanut butter cookies my dad always made! I did make a couple changes:
- I didn't roll them in sugar. They don't need the extra sweetness, in my opinion - but maybe that was because I used Skippy peanut butter, which has added sugar already.
- I only baked them for 8 minutes. Overbaked peanut butter cookies are the worst. Even then, they were close to being too dark on the bottoms. 

Also, be sure to space them apart on the baking sheet. These cookies spread out more than you think they will.

These cookies were perfect, my niece who is 9 years old; our up and coming Baker, made them last night. We followed the recipe exactly except adding the sugar for decoration. They taste just like the cookies my dad used to make. We looked and looked for a recipe that used vanilla and only baking soda, this was the only one I found. So glad I found it, the only thing I would change is doubling the recipe. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Doesn't taste too peanutbuttery enough.  Burnt after nine minutes on bottom.  Try cooking for 6 minutes and check every minute.

The taste is amazing, just the right amount of peanut butter to satisfy my sweet tooth. The first batch was in the oven for 11 minutes and had a crunch to them. My second batch was baking for 9 minutes and are soft and chewy. Will definitely make these again.

These were really easy to make. The batch made a few more because I made smaller cookies. I even added chocolate chips to the top of some while baking. Yummy! I think I'll use a little more peanut butter next time but overall great, easy recipe.

Made them and actually heated the peanut butter; not too sure if that's what the recipe called for, but my mixture turned too runny. ): I ended up adding another cup of flour to sustain its form.

Really nice and easy recipe. Cookies were soft, as a matter of fact, you HAVE to wait to try them or you'll be eating cookie dough. They firm up a bit after they are completely cooled.

Wonderful cookies! I added a few tablespoons of powdered peanut butter to the batter just to bump it up a bit. Also dusted the unbaked cookies with the powdered PB. Diane Stadler

My 10 year old daughter made these cookies entirely on her own.  I was in the room supervising but I did not interfere.  We had to do some fractions math work as well as discussing results of high altitude with baking (sugar).  I just told her that these are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had.  No changes made to the recipe at all.

Great recipe!   Just changed it slightly.   Used whole wheat flour and added an extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter.  My family ate 1 dozen in 5 minutes!   Now added to my favorites!

I made this recipe as written. I usually tweak recipes to my preferences but decided to try this one without any changes. Must admit they are some of the best peanut cookies I've eaten! My husband is picky and he loves them too! I liked this recipe because it used less butter and sugar than some of the other ones. Glad I tried it and I will definitely keep this one!

Made these cookies tonight and I must say they are so good! Even the dough was smoothe and creamy, easy to roll. I will make these again. Didn't change anything.

Great way to keep cookies soft is put a slice of bread In a sealed container with any cookies. If like harder straight out of oven let cool on brown paper bag

Simply perfect peanut butter cookies...  I've made many recipes and this is my favorite.  Crisp on the edges and soft in the middle... Can't stop eating them.

The only thing I changed was that I used 3/4 cup of peanut butter and I didn't use vanilla extract since I didn't have any. These came out delicious!!!! I baked for exactly 10 min and they came out soft but crunchy on the bottom.

These were very good, soft and well received by my brother who loves peanut butter cookies!  My only observation was the peanut butter flavor could be stronger.  My next time making these, I will add more peanut butter and adjust the other ingredients accordingly.

For someone who has never baked a thing from scratch before let alone cookies, this turned out to be a really great recipe. Since I do not have a mixer my wrist got quite the workout, but in the end I got to surprise my six and two year old kids with super moist delicious peanut butter cookies. Like another person on here I decided against the extra sugar and I'm pretty glad I did because man are these babies sweet! I used to be terrified of baking since I'm horrible at cooking, but this first attempt has inspired me to try more!

This is the very first time I've made homemade peanut butter cookies and I followed the instructions exactly and they turned out PERFECT! It said 10-12 min, I chose 10 min because my oven bakes true temp and I let them cool on a rack. Thank you for sharing!

I was looking for a great peanut butter cookie recipe to enhance with chopped Reeses peanut butter cups. I added about 8 full sized peanut butter cups ( chopped into small chunks) to the dough. These turned out so good!!!I think it may be the best peanut butter cookie I have ever had : )

Followed the recipe except that I did not sift the flour but instead spooned it into a cup.  This usually works best for me and these were the best PB cookies that I ever ate.

A quick and easy recipe... but it didn't have much peanut flavor.

Delicious! Wonderful flavor and texture, best homemade peanut butter cookies i've tasted.  Easy to make, still soft next day(in ziplock). Tip:sprinkle on a tiny bit chopped peanut just on top before scoring with fork, soooo good. I didn't roll in extra sugar FYI.

I found this to be a great, easy recipe.  I did, however, make a few modifications. I doubled the recipe, added another 2/3 of a cup of peanut butter to assure a strong peanut taste and also added another 1/2 cupof flour to compensate for the extra peanut butter.  they were fabulous.

I made these for my boyfriend and son. They loved them! Some of the reviews suggested adding more peanut butter. I made a double batch and used a small jar of peanut butter. That was the perfect amount. I normally don't like peanut butter cookies but these were delicious. I did watch how long they were in the oven and they took about 8 minutes. I also froze the dough like people suggested. The cookies didn't spread out too much. I also just dropped them on the cookie sheets and didn't flatten them or roll them in sugar. They were good just the way they came out. My son and boyfriend have asked that this be the only recipe I use for peanut butter cookies.

Fantastic. Made exactly to recipe and added chocolate chips. Very moist and stayed soft even though they were left out over night (because husbands can't follow directions). Only 4 stars thought because directions said 10 to 12 minutes and mine nearly burned at the 10 minute mark. Otherwise fantastic!

I'm not the biggest fan of peanut-butter cookies, but these were really good. I like my cookies to be soft, so I did freeze the rolled balls before baking them. The texture was perfect! I will be making these again.

This recipe was definitely fast and easy but my cookies came out thin and crisp. If you like your peanut butter cookies thick and moist look for a different recipe.

I gave this a shot, but found that the cookies were too sweet, and that was without the white sugar for decoration.  I did add flour to the recipe as well - some people suggested anywhere from 1/4c to 1/2c - I went with 1/4.  It made the mix somewhat easier to work with.

I think this recipe could work with more modification, IMO.

I'm not much of a baker, but I wanted something easy to do during the blizzard.  This was a very easy recipe, and the cookies taste exactly how I would expect PB cookies to taste.

I read through the comments and incorporated some of the suggestions.  Chilling the dough for 5-10 minutes before forming the cookies made the dough easy to handle and the cookies came out soft.  Also, in my oven 8 minutes is the longest time for baking....any longer and they would have been too brown.

Yum! There was no way, however, I could roll these cookies in my hands before putting them on the pan. The dough was oober sticky so I just used 2 spoons. I made a double batch, maybe that's why they were sticky. Regardless they were delicious!

My 2yo enjoyed making these with me today. Our only change was to use slightly over one cup of whole wheat flour in place of one and a quarter cups of regular flour. They turned out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. VERY yummy and definitely a recipe we will use again!!

I made this at the spur of the moment while on a short vacation with a friend and his little ones. Everyone loved it, and these little guys are picky eaters. Changes:  I combined natural peanut butter with regular chucky peanut butter' I added a 1/4 cup more white sugar; vanilla extract; and  2 teaspoons of milk.... Perfect, will definitely make again.  The cookies tasted even better the next day.

These were decent. I just had a problem when I was making them because the dough was so soft it kept sticking to the fork. So I got real frustrated maybe my butter was too soft but they were good other than that.

These were fantastic!  My daughter has made them 4 times now and they always turn out.  We double the recipe.  We have a convection oven so we reduce the temp to 360F and bake for only 10 min.  Crunchy on the outside, chewy in the middle.

Nice, basic, peanut butter cookies. They won't bring about world peace, but they also don't  take a long time to make nor require expensive ingredients.  Between 8 and 10 minutes was perfect time for baking in my oven, so watch the cookies closely!

This is exactly what a peanut butter cookie is meant to be. I skipped the rolling in sugar & baked 8 minutes. Easy & delicious!

These cookies were excellent.  I made them today with my kids and we all loved them.  I would also recommend only cooking for eight minutes.  I have dark pans so I cooked them at 350.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  We will be making these again, but next time we will double the recipe!

This recipe was very good.  I added a little more peanut butter, sugar and vanilla than the recipe had, and they turned out delicious.

I have just pulled these gorgeous cookies from the oven. I am about to try one and then give my review.........They are delicious! If you like a more powerful peanut butter taste....you may wanna add a dab more, but they are really great the way they are. Going to be part of my boyfriends valentines gift. =)

These are so easy to make and they are really good. I baked them for 15 minutes because I used an ice cream scoop (small one) instead of rolling them out into balls. I was a bit worried when I looked at the dough, it was very fluffy but it baked very nicely. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Next time, I might try doubling the peanut butter and omitting the butter altogether. I like my PB cookies super peanut buttery.

This recipe is identical as the one in the Better Homes and Gardens CKBK. A classic, no fail recipe. Pleasantly crispy on the edges and moist and chewy in the center.

These cookies are AWESOME! They were soooo easy to make. I made them last minute before heading out the door for Dads birthday. He loved them. I kept some for my family too. I left them on the counter for 4 days on a paper towel and when I grabbed one, to my absolute surprise, they were still soft! Will be making these again today and for baskets for Christmas. Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed the recipe except for the rolling in sugar. I rolled the dough into ball and baked the cookies in a small muffin pan which created a little concaved spot that was perfect for a teaspoon of grape or strawberry jelly. The people at work were overwhelmingly thrilled with them, Thanks!!

I made these at high altitude and had to use tub margarine instead of butter. After about 10 minutes they were thin (about 1/8 inch) and easy to roll/fold (they didn't harden as they cooled, so no fancy cookie making with the soft ones). A few minutes more and they were crispy, but not burned.

Awesome these were not too sweet just right.  I followed another cooks suggestion by puttting these in the freezer for a few minutes after I had them on the cookie sheet.  This kept them soft, I also double my recipe and added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.

Perfect cookie! Light PB Flavor... not too over powering. 

Dough softens fast, so keep cool in the ice box in between bathces or spoon drop (which I did for the last dozen of so)

I used all white sugar because I was out of brown... tasted great. 

I also baked less time. About 7-8 minutes.

I just made these and they turned out great!  I made a few alterations- I used about 2/3 cup peanut butter, added M&M's, baked them in a mini muffin pan, and put a dollop of chocolate frosting on each- too cute, and really tasty!

This is a really good recipe! I tried the first batch with the sugar on top & it was too sweet. The next batch I left off the sugar & they came out better. They were still slightly too sweet. In the future I will reduce the sugar a little more.  `

This is the second time I have made this recipe.  My husband loves it, says they are the best.  I made them exactly as the recipe is.  They have a rich, buttery flavor, so if you aren't a big fan of peanut butter, there is still a pretty good chance you will enjoy these with the rest of your family.

I followed this recipe exactly and also got a crumbly dough.  Into my Kitchenaid mixer bowl I added milk in a drizzle until dough formed a ball.  Then I rolled in raw sugar for the first tray.  They were good.  The following trays I did not roll in sugar and they were perfect!

Not too sweet and very peanut buttery.
I can't keep enough of these in the jar. I added a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon; a family favorite spice and they are perfect!

I decided to make these this weekend and had the intentions of taking them to work---however---they were sooooooo delicious they're not going to make it to the office. They turned out thin and slightly cruchy and thats just the way I love my peanut butter cookies. Thank you! I didn't do the sugar for decoration.

I didn't have any white sugar and ended up using all brown. I also added 3/4 C. semi sweet chocolate chips because my husband is a chocolate monster, these came out a tiny bit too sweet for me, but the hubby gladly hoarded them! Baked up soft in 10 minutes, guessing it was the brown sugar that shaved a minute or two off the bake time. Thanks for such quick and easy recipe!

Great recipe!  I absolutely hate peanuts and peanut butter, but I wanted to make these cookies for my boyfriend (his favorite).  I had one just now, fresh out of the oven - and WOW, they are delicious!!!  I needed a recipe that didn't require baking powder (as many on the site do) - just fabulous!

Wow, I had never seen a peanut butter cookie recipe like this before - hardly any flour in it!

It turned out well, with a very dense texture.  Not exactly the same effect as the traditional peanut butter cookie recipe, so if that's what you're going for this is not a good recipe.  But if you don't mind branching out a bit, it was tasty!

I had lost my recipe for these cookies. I think this is it because we loved them. They were soft and chewy.

I used natural pb (no sugar added) and it was still too sweet for me and not enough peanut butter taste.  I think next time I'd increase the pb and maybe use crunchy instead of smooth...

These were great. They had a slight crisp on the outside, but the inside was soft and chewy. I cooked mine for about 10 minutes, and they were perfect. I had to put bread in the container to keep them soft, but they weren't crunchy. They definitely don't have a strong peanut taste, which was what I was looking for, but if your looking for a stronger peanut flavor I would add a little more peanut butter.

My cookies were neither soft nor chewy (well, right out of the oven they were but as soon as they cooled down it was crunch-city).  I also stored them in an airtight container.  The flavor was standard - nothing amazing.  The finished cookie did taste better than the dough itself, however.

Very good! I baked them for 9 mins exactly.. I did make them bigger hoping they did not flatten out - but no such luck.. Instead - right when they came out of the oven i used two spatulas to square the cookies and sort of squish them so they'd be a bit thicker.. And they turned out like Cookies by George cookies!

Really yummy.  Crispy and soft at the same time.  I used a small melon baller to scoop the dough and it made 30 cookies for me.

Linda,  I made these last evening and got 3 dozen. They are fantastic.  I followed to the letter and just used a teaspoon to place dough on cookie sheet and used a fork dipped in sugar to mark the tops. A winner for sure.

The cookies were very moist, yet slightly crispy on the outside.  Very good.  I did not mash them as flat as the picture and they were nice and plump.  I added some cinnamon in my sugar on the last batch that went into the oven and it tasted very much like a snickerdoodle, quite good actually!  Will make again.

This recipe is both easy and delicious. My 4-year-old was able to help at every step and he loves the results. I'm not sure what's up with the measurements, but I used a one inch scooper and doubled the recipe. We only made 40 with a double recipe.

although they tasted okay, I did not like the fact that these flattened out and after making the crisscross, could barely see it when they were done, they were so flat.  Followed the recipe exactly w/no changes.  You really have to watch these...30 sec. makes a big difference in how they look.  I liked the way mine turned out on the airbake sheet as opposed to non-stick sheet.  Not worth trying again and leaving out the soda like another reviewer mentioned.  Was disappointed w/all the rave reviews.

Got softer after a day in an air-tight container.

Excellent cookies - great flavor.  I doubled the recipe, though, and only got 5 dozen, so I don't think one batch yields 48 cookies.

This recipe is the best peanutbutter ever! The cookies came out very soft, even when I accidently cooked them a little longer then nessasary.
