This was a simple recipe but it was a bit too sweet for our personal taste. If I make it again, I would skip the sweetened yogurt (and use plain) and I would eliminate the brown sugar entirely. I thought the idea of fully dusting the blueberries in cinnamon would work similar to dusting the berries with flour, but sadly the cinnamon trick still made the berries migrate to the bottom of the cake. Next time I would toss the berries with flour or some of the cake mix to correct that problem. Otherwise, a very good and simple coffee cake. Thanks for sharing.

I didn't have a box of cake mix, so I substituted 1-1/2 cups of flour, 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1-3/4 teas of baking powder. Plus I added half a box of vanilla pudding mix since the recipe called for a pudding cake mix. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. I followed other reviewers suggestions and tossed the blueberries in flour instead of the cinnamon. Plus I only folded in half of the blueberries, then stuffed the rest on top after I poured it into the pan. The finished product was a little moist around the blueberries, otherwise it turned out perfect! The taste was amazing! And the blueberries were fairly well dispursed. My husband who is an overly picky eater can't stop picking at it. That earns an instant 5 stars!

Made this, but next time will used lemon cake mix, omitted the brown sugar and use low fat lemon yogurt.  Very moist cake.

I actually had this somewhat odd combination of ingredients on hand and tried this to use up some blueberries.  I too had the problem of all the blueberries sinking to the bottom (the top when it is turned out of the pan), but that's my only quibble.  The flavor is sweet but great; my son said it's like blueberry pancakes and syrup in one cake!  Looks beautiful - wish I had taken a picture before we started devouring it.

Reading through the other reviews, it seems that almost no one made the recipe as written. I made this and did not change a thing. Like another reviewer said: this just wasn’t what I expected. The combination of ingredients is odd. Particularly, I don’t think that the blueberries complemented the cinnamon and maple very well. I personally would not make this again as written. I do think, however, that it’s a good base recipe for a moist blueberry coffee cake. If I made it again, I would omit the cinnamon and maple, and substitute almond extract, OR substitute-in lemon cake mix, lemon yogurt, and/or lemon extract, as others have mentioned.

used lemon cake mix and coated the blueberries (used from frozen) with a bit of the cake mix, worked well putting 1/2 the cake mix in the pan, blueberries and remaining cake mix over top. Skipped the maple and used vanilla extract since using the lemon cake mix. Was very moist, flavorful. Served with vanilla ice cream. Thank you for a great way to use up some yogurt.

3 22 18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/232251/blueberry-yogurt-pound-cake/ ... Truly, I don't mean to be a party pooper.  This just isn't what I expected, when I read "pound cake" is all.  In my book, this could be renamed:  Blueberry French Toast Cake.  It's kind of eggy.  Weird, I know, for a cake, but it is.  It's pretty heavy & too moist - probably contributes to the egginess (Am I making up words?).  I didn't use a pudding-added mix.  I didn't add additional sugar.  It's sweet enough even with using a lowsugar vanilla yogurt.  I used frozen berries.  Tossing in cinnamon, I didn't do.  That would be considerably more cinnamon, if the idea is to coat them.   'Think this would be better "accepted" baked in a loaf pan - actually two - & toasted with a little butter.  Okay, okay, toasted then a bit of butter on it.   Geez, so technical!  ;D

I followed the advice of other reviewers and omitted the brown sugar and we didn't miss it. I used a lemon cake mix with pudding and tossed the blueberries in about 1/8 cup of cake mix to dust them first.  Used lemon yogurt and completed the recipe as directed, stirred in the blueberries.  I poured about 2/3 of the batter into a loaf pan because I wanted a breakfast bread, baked it for 55 minutes.  Put the rest of the batter in a cupcake tin and baked for about twenty-five minutes.  The cake is moist, not as dense as some pound cakes.  We thought the lemon complimented the blueberries quite well.

I made this into muffins and a small loaf. My kids loved it! Just a couple of adjustments due to what I had on hand: I used two single-serve containers of nonfat blueberry Greek yogurt and one single-serve container of unsweetened applesauce. I'm going to freeze the small loaf for an easy breakfast! Side note: The maple extract had my kitchen smelling lovely!

This cake filled my house with a mouth watering aroma; my guest smelled it while walking up to my front door. I didn't have apple sauce, vanilla yogurt or maple flavoring, so I sustituded with 1 cup sour cream; and 1 teaspoon molasses and poured 1/2 of the cake mix into the bundt pan adding 1 teaspoon all the way around the pan of 3/4 th cup of brown sugar mixed with butter as desired;  and poured the rest of the cake mix into the bundt pan.

This was so moist!  My grocery store did not have any cake mix with pudding so I used  a box of vanilla pudding and doubled the oil to make up for the extra ingredient.
