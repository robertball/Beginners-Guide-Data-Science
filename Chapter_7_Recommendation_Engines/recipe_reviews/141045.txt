I liked the flavor of this a lot. It's much healthier and packs protein. The texture of the sauce wasn't as appealing. Next time I'll puree all of the beans, milk, sauteed garlic, spices/s/p, and maybe some silken tofu in a food processor before simmering it. I would like it to be thick and very creamy. The idea of using beans in a sauce is great, and I'll definitely try this again!

This is very good - my kids really like it. I made it twice so far, and the second time I pureed all of the beans (the kids didn't eat the whole beans the first time). Also I used regular 2 percent milk instead of soy and it tasted better to us. This is going into regular rotation!

My daughter is 14 and is experimenting with vegetarian meals.  The taste was good, but texture with shells of the Navy beans did not make it appealing.  Next time I will puree the sauce.

My husband likes this. This is a great, healthy alternative to Alfredo, and it's vegan if you use soy milk & vegan margarine (I use Blue Bonnet Light Spread). It does need a bit more seasoning though and less milk. I like to add lemon pepper, crushed red pepper and oregano. I also used zucchini & yellow squash instead of asparagus to cut down cost. Yummy!

Made this last night and my daughter and I liked it alot.  It is a little on the bland side so we were generous with the salt and peeper.  I also added some chopped fresh parsley.  We were out of soy milk, so I used reconstituted dry milk.  As some of the other reviewers said, it is a thin sauce, so I thickened it with a flour/water mixture for a truer "Alfredo" texture.  We served this with a side vegetable and a salad so we left out the asparagus, but it still tasted very good.  My daughter begged for the leftovers for lunch today and it tasted even better - definitely making this again.

I was a bit apprehensive about pasta with beans, but it turned out to be a pretty good, quick, and easy recipe with just a few modifications.   I used what I had on hand: fresh linguine, steamed broccoli, and a can of navy beans. To make the sauce, I gently sauteed the garlic in olive oil and then added the beans, which I did not drain all the way. The beans tasted nothing like alfredo and they were pretty bland, so I added a bit of curry and lemon juice to the beans as they warmed. I did not like the sound of adding milk, so I incorporated a bit of the pasta water instead.

This was so creamy and wonderful. I added some grated parmesan on top and some black pepper and red pepper flakes. Delicious and definitely a keeper! Made me feel not so guilty about making alfredo and could be a good way to sneak some beans into a kiddo's diet.

This recipe is really good, but the calories posted are WAY off.  I scaled the butter back by half and used fat free evaporated milk (comes in 12 oz cans, so it's perfect!) instead of the soy, but the calories I got in my calorie tracker (myfitnesspal.com, looooove it) said 427, only 14 calories different than the 441 listed.

For health reasons, I have been recently eating a mostly vegetarian diet and avoiding dairy.  I've been trying to find recipes that my family and I can both eat, without me having to make 2 separate meals.  This recipe was quite good.  I used Bestlife buttery spread instead of the butter, and Trader Joe's Orgnanic Whole Grain Drink instead of soy milk.  I didn't have a whole package of pasta, so I used one 15 oz can of navy beans and 1 cup of the grain drink.  I pureed them both together to make it all smooth, because I knew there was no way my kids would go for the beans. (I also left out the asparagus and served broccoli on the side.)  My 12 yr old son's favorite meal is shrimp alfredo linguine; I didn't use shrimp this time, but he liked the pasta!  He had no clue that the sauce was made of beans!  As far as that goes, my husband didn't suspect anything either.  Taste-wise, I personally would give this 3 or 3.5 stars, but if this can fool the pasta lover in my household, then it gets 4 stars from me!

Surprisingly delicious! I couldn't help but add a little parmesean cheese, and I was skeptical about a bean sauce. We loved it!

It was bad.  It was not like Alfredo at all.  We were able to eat it with a lot of salt but will not be making it again.

This tasted great! To me, almost exactly like alfredo, but much healthier. I substituted almond milk for the soy, and coconut oil for the butter and it came out delicious.  I blended the "alfredo" up with a hand blender... The consistency was perfect. This is an excellent recipe for anyone, but of special interest to those veg*ns who are looking for a good alfredo sauce.

I increased the amount of beans to 3 cups and used unsweetened almond milk, 2 cups. I still didn't have enough sauce for an entire pound of pasta. I also added quite a bit more garlic and a lot of salt and pepper. I enjoyed it a lot!

For those who don't care for the soy milk, rice or almond milk may be substituted.  Vegans can replace the butter with Earth Balance non-dairy spread, and use the many non-dairy "cheeses" available.

We love Alfredo, so I was excited to try this recipe. The first time around I didn't think too much of it, however I'm happy that I gave it a second try. I used evaporated low fat milk per one of the reviewers suggestions & (by accident) used two cans of cannellini beans which thickened the sauce nicely. I did blend the beans to a puree before adding to the garlic. It passed a picky 5 year old's test, so I'm keeping this one in rotation!

It was good for bean lovers.  It didn't turn our as creamy or buttery as I had hoped and I used my food processor to thoroughly puree my beans before I added them.  I would eat it again but wouldn't serve it to my boys as they are not bean fans and it didn't fool them one bit.

I'm rating it mainly to leave my own recipe variation, which probably makes it totally different.  Instead of using canned, I start with a half-cup dried, do a quick soak, drain and rinse, then cook.  Then, I puree in a food processor and drizzle in olive oil instead of butter (I don't have a set amount, just add until creamy, but you don't need 1/4cup.)  Instead of salt, I use fish sauce to also add loads of glutamate (salt and glutamate is what makes alfredo sooooo good.)

This really doesn't taste anything like alfredo but it has become one of my favorite recipes! I make it with regular milk instead of soy milk and green beans instead of asparagus. I just love the white bean sauce. And you get some protein too!

Taste good, consistancy thick and not smooth
