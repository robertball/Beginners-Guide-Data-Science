2.22.16  Nothing really bad about this, I simply didn't find it very satisfying.My biggest disappointment is the way this looks...brown from chia seeds. I'd recommend that you use a really good brand of coconut water to mimic  that pina colada  flavor.  I used IberiaÂ® Coconut Water with coconut pulp, blended with ice, and added some toasted coconut and chopped pineapple for the garnish.

Aside from the color this was rather yummy.  I use a vitamix so I did not have to wait 30 minutes for my beverage to thicken up.  It was thick after two minutes.

I made several changes based on the two previous reviews by lutzflcat and Jenny Aleman: I added the pineapple in with the other ingredients and blended it all together.  I also did not wait the 30 minutes for the chia seeds to thicken (can't they do that in my tummy?) and apparently turn browner.  And finally, even though the coconut water and pineapple had been in the frig, the drink was not cold enough for me, so I drank it over ice. Since I didn't let the chia seeds expand, this is like drinking a flavored, not very sweet water.

I liked the flavor of the drink but to be able to eat the pineapple I had to use a spoon to drag them from the bottom, the little pieces of pineapple sank. I would prefer to slightly blend them to get little pieces here and there. I added some ice to give more body to the drink but it didn't help much. The color is not the most appealing but the chia seeds are to blame for that and the texture. Would I make it again? Yes, making the changes I suggested.
