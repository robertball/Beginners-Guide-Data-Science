These were really easy to make and the dogs love them.  Instead of using cookie cutters, I rolled the dough out on a floured cutting board that is slightly smaller than my baking sheets and then used a pizza cutter to cut the dough.  It made it easy to invert the cutting board onto the cookie sheet and slightly separate each of the dough squares before baking.

This makes about 1.5 pounds of dog biscuits. All 3 of my dogs loved them. I did not use spelt flour just whole wheat and ground flax seeds. Cut them into dog shapes truly adorable!

Wheat is bad for dogs use oat or almond flour instead.  Wheat, corn and soy can cause skin problems.

My 3 pooches love these...of course, they eat pretty much anything...but I like to think that homemade treats are special for them. :-)  Didn't have any flax seed on hand, so I substituted a bit of cornmeal.  This does make A LOT of treats, so either be prepared to share with doggie friends, or cut the recipe half.  Thanks!! :-)

Be careful, these make WAY more than it says if you use a small cookie cutter.  I'm not positive if dogs like these or not, because I gave these to 3 different dogs and they all kind of choked on them at first.  Also, they are VERY hard to bite into (I tried them myself).  Maybe add more peanut butter and bake for less time.  I had to break it into little pieces for my puppy.  The only thing I changed was that I used wheat bran instead of flax seeds.  The only one who liked them was me!

my dog loves these biscuits.  His eyes get wider when he sees me with it in my hand, and he is kinda picky when it comes to food/treats.  They are easy to make and there's a lot of them.  It is also cheaper than buying the ones from the pet store that are gourmet made.

My dog and another dog I was babysitting gave this recipe two paws up.  I used whole wheat flour instead of spelt, but left everything the same otherwise.  One thing I really like about this recipe is that it doesn’t contain milk or cheese which can be difficult for dogs to digest.

Love this recipe and so do my dogs! But it makes a lot more than it says. I also bake a little bit longer because I roll them a little thicker.

As a few other reviewers mentioned, wheat flour is not great for dogs (although whole wheat is much better than all-purpose). I've made these a couple of times now, and I like to substitute the flours for ground oats and ground brown rice (equal parts). I just throw the rice and oats in my food processor and let it run for several minutes until they're fine and powdery. They absorb a little more water than the flours, so I also add an extra two tablespoons of peanut butter to help hold them together. These are a great accompaniment to the Christmas treat plates we give out to our pet-loving neighbors!

My dogs absolutely love these!  They are simple to make and as other review stated, make more than it says.  When I make these, my 2 dogs turn their noses up at the store bought peanut butter cookies they love.  These are definitely their favorite.

Definitely a keeper in the recipe box. My Sous Chefs love em.  This is a very flexible and forgiving recipe, just go by the texture of the dough.  I used regular oats and whole wheat for all the flour.  I didn't have any flax seeds, but the peanut butter I used had some flax in it.  I did have to add a bit more flour.  I halved the recipe and it rolled out to about a half sheet pan size.  I used a pizza cutter to make 1 inch squares

Very easy to make! Kita (Our 1 and a half year old Husky/Wolf) loved them! And so did all of her puppy friends. Makes ALOT, I got 72 small-medium sized cookies and 10 large cookies out of one batch! We topped off half of the cookies with a carob chip, which Kita liked even more. Next time, I will make puppy icing and put some on top for an extra treat!

This recipe is fantastic. I too didn;t have any spelt flour, so like other suggestions just used 4 cups of plain flour. Also, I split the dry ingredients into two batches. One batch I put in 1.25 cups of chicken broth, 1 clove of crushed garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon of parsley, half a cup of reduced fat, lactose free shredded cheese. I found the dough a bit too sticky so added an extra half cup of flour while kneading it.  The second batch I added 2 well heaped table spoons of reduced fat peanut butter, 1.25 cups of water, 1/2 cup of flour and half a cup of diced apple.  As the dough was still sticky I rolled it out between 2 sheets of cooking paper and lightly sprinkled more flour to make it workable then cut into shapes. Baked for approx 40 mins and let cool. I have a small oven though, so it took a few rounds to bake it all.  My dogs loved it. In fact one of my dogs saw me putting the last batch into the oven and has been sitting there waiting for them to come out with a puddle of drool emmerging on the floor below his mouth.   These are fantastic and I will definately be making them again.

This is an amazing recipe.  The only change I make is to increase the peanut butter to 1 1/2-cups to please my dogs.  I also put the water in a 4-cup microwave safe measuring cup.  Add the peanut butter to this container to make 4-cups.  Now, heat it in the microwave.  Then, stir the peanut butter into the water.  Now, add to the dry ingredients.  I also cut it into tiny squares and break it apart after being dried out in the oven.  

Thank you so much.  One of my dogs got epilepsy from eating food with preservatives.  This recipe is a huge part of her recovery.  No narcotics for my dog baby.  No more seizures!  You are an angel!

These are too good, my husband eats them.  I bake them in a perforated pizza pan.  To speed up production, I roll/press the dough out so it covers the round pan, then score it into squares with a ravioli cutter.  It bakes in a sheet that easily breaks into squares when done.

Best and easiest dog treat recipe i've found, I always make a new batch before I run out. My dog has colitis and these are great for him, don't bother his tummy at all, he loves them - he guards the oven while they're baking!

I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 2 cup oat meal with 1/4 cup milled flax seed with 1 1/2 cups chicken broth, kept the bp the same. Makes a smaller batch and my beagle loved them.

Thank you for this recipe. I made it with all whole wheat flour. The color and texture are beautiful, so these will make a lovely gift for my dog-owning friends. I baked a week's worth and rolled the rest up in parchment to freeze. I even used a hunk of raw dough to hide meds.

The pups loved these! I didn't have flax seeds, so I used a little flax seed oil.  Definitely required a lot of flour and I added a bit more oats as well. Like everyone said... it makes a huge batch, but I didn't mind because we had a lot of dogs to share with.   Oh and for some of them, I cut strips and then scored the dough so that they could be broken into smaller bits later if wanted.  Kind of a choose your size treat.

I used Oat flour and Brown Rice flour.  Left out the flax seed.  The dog LOVED these, and so did all his "friends"  Passed it along to others for their dogs.  Allergies is why I looked for a recipe.  Next time I am using People cutters!  HA HA

I made a few changes-used all whole wheat flour and left out the flax seeds since I didn't have any.  I also added about 1/4-1/2 tsp ground cinnamon.  I rolled them a bit thick and just sliced into 1/2-inch squares using a pizza cutter (to save time). I only spaced them about 1/4 inch apart on the cookie sheet and had no trouble with them baking, did cut the time to 30 minutes and left them in the oven an additional 30 minutes. My Jack Russels love this "cookie" (and one of them is EXTREMELY picky).  This will go into the permanent rotation for doggie goodies.  Although I cut the recipe in half I still had way too much dough (for 2 small dogs) so I froze half for later.  After thawing in the fridge for a day, the biscuits baked up perfectly. In the future I'll just mix a whole batch and freeze in quarters.  Thanks for a great treat-Juliet and Lily thank you too!

I did not use spelt or whole wheat...I used my ninja blender to make rice and oatmeal flour. I also added peas and carrots. In retrospect, I could have added a little more peanut butter....be careful not to leave these unattended in oven..I almost burnt mine...my "puppy" loved them!!

I had to change this up a little due to a dog with food allergies but they both LOVE it. I used all gluten free baking flour instead of the whole wheat and spelt. The dough came out gooey-er than expected so added a little more flour. I"m not much of a roll out and cookie cut person, so I just dropped dollops of dough onto the cookie sheet, like an old fashioned oatmeal cookie and flattened it out a bit. Yes, it is very sticky. Baked for only about 20 - 25 mintues so they remained just a little chewy. My dogs are crazy for these!!

I let my dog have some of the dough as I made these for him for his 1st birthday. He LOVED the dough and the biscuits. Will definitely make them again. I tried them myself and they taste pretty darn good. :)

We make these every Christmas for our German Shepherd. It doesn't have any dairy or sugar in it, so it's healthier for her. They come out good, but I usually let them set out on wire racks for a day or so to dry out really well. She enjoys them, and the kids like helping me make them!

Loved this simple, cost-effective recipe. Didn't have flax on hand, so subbed in wheatgerm and it worked just fine. Have to agree with other reviewers that 40 minutes would be too much baking time (at least in my oven!) Reduced to 20 minutes and it worked out great!. Next time will try using some stock with the water to make them meaty (for variety!), but the dogs loved them just as they were! Strangely enough, so did my husband....

I 1/2'd this recipe and added 1/4 cup of applesauce.  Made tiny and medium biscuits and it made 14 medium/70 tiny cookies.  VERY easy to make and the dogs love them!

This recipe is real simple to make, real easy.  Instead of spelt flour I subsituted whole wheat and instead of flax seeds I used 3 TBS of flax seed meal.  My 3 dogs really like these!

My dogs will no longer accept any treat but these!!  That says it all!!  I did slightly alter the ingredients, based on their preferences: 3c. wheat flour, 1c. cornmeal (makes for a crunchier biscuit - not just hard *careful, some dogs are sensitive to corn), and veggie broth instead of water.--I had to add to my previous review - I added about 1 1/2 c. water in addition to the broth -this made it thin enough for me to use my cookie press with the filling tip.  It sped up the process, lightened up the biscuits, and increased the yield.  it's a win/win/win!!

This was my first try at making dog cookies. My Yorkie loves them. I used whole wheat flour only, add 1/2 cup dark molasses, knocked the water down to 2 cups, but had to add a little more water just enough to work the dough. I tested them a few times today by holding one of his store bought cookies and these, he chose these every time. Thank You.

Not easy to work with
A big mess was had by all while making this
the golden lab we made them for spit them out so ya, not a very effective afternoon, but maybe one of our dogie friends might like these
Cook time was way too long, 20 minutes was long enough any longer and they would of been coal
We used a pizza cutter to cut into rectangles and it worked great, they did look great but so far no luck with the pooch
We even added honey to the last bit of the batch but ya she wont even try them anymore
On to the next one I guess

I baked these treats today and my four dogs really loved them. I didn't have wheat germ on hand, so I used 1/4 c. flax seed and 1/4 c. oats in place of it. I have a bone shaped baking tray and used it instead of rolling out the dough. It made 18 bone biscuits.

Well I haven't tried it but Mickey loves them.  He's my beautiful yellow lab that was diagnosed with cancer last year.  He's been receiving homeopathic cancer support and these wonderful treats with no preservatives.  He is now in remission!  That's his picture with the Christmas tree when he wasn't feeling too well.

The treats are easy to make however I find they take about 50 minutes of prep time after mixing, rolling and cutting them out.  The recipe makes about 4 1/2 dozen using the blue Wilton dog bone cutter.  Also I use the dark pans and reduce the oven heat to 325.

These are a HIT with our Goldens. They actually DEMAND for these buscuits! (Mental image to help explain this: You are getting ready to leave, keys in hand, in the bathroom, and your dog is BARKING at you for their PB buscuit before you leave) It's hilarious! But for those venturing into buscuit making, these are super easy to make, and our pups LOVE them.

Thumbs up on this.  Had to sub out a few things to what was on hand.  Used some wheat germ and flax meal.   Both dogs loved it. I would suggest freezing little baggies of them,  and use them as needed small bags at a time---for without preservatives they will most likely get stale or moldy I would imagine.

Molly, my Cavalier loved them! Actually, I played with the ingredients some: I used ground oats, wheat germ, a little ground corn, with peanut butter and pumpkin. I added either oats, wheat germ or corn until it was stiff enough. I rolled it out...easy as pie. I used the pizza cutter method someone had recommended to cut into rectangles....kind of like a long cracker. The nieghbors' dog loved them too! This made quite a few, but I'm sure I'll make them again.

Great recipe, would have gotten five stars if they substituted spelt flour for brown rice flour! Brown rice flour helps with dog digestion and as a previous reviewed mentioned, wheat flour can cause a lot of problems for dogs on the inside and out. Definitely recommended otherwise! :)

The dogs love these, they even wanted to eat the dough before it was cooked. Like several other commenters said, I will reduce the cooking time next time I make these, otherwise they were awesome.

My dog loves these but they gave him bad breath.  We give him teeth cleaning chews and put tartar-control liquid in his water.  We don’t notice odor to his breath

I have a mix  who is very picky he only eats homemade treats ( I've tried every brand and flavor with him he won't eat it) so I found a cheese treat that that he likes alot but I wanted to try other flavors I found this  recipe so I tried it  and he LOVED it !!  I was shocked because he does not really like peanut butter ( I know thats wired but he does not like it)  after the first treat he about bit my hand off for the next one! I don't have little cookie cutters so i free-cut but I did it in little shapes if you make them little they only need to cook for 15-20 mins  and it makes a TON of treats if you make them little also my sister  is here with her dog who also loves them I love that I know where the stuff in my dogs treats come from also there are alot of little kids in my family  so if they get a hold of them  I know its safe if they ate a few. I'm sorry for such a long review but it can't be helped.

These were easy and fun - my Chessie loves them! No need to grease the pan because the peanut butter is oily enough.  I used 100% oat flour instead of wheat - no gluten- and they rolled out great. Will make again!

The dogs loved them! They only have a few ingredients and were simple but somewhat time-consuming to make. It's nice to make treats so I know what is in them and they are also economical. This is the second time I made them and will be making them again.

have made these MANY times!  My granddog LOVES them and I made  a big  plastic jar that I had with a screw on lid, into his treat jar, drawing his name and some cute designs on the outside.  He knows to sit by that jar when I come over to get his treats. I just got a dog from the shelter and am now making them for him as well. MANY people have asked me for the recipe for their dogs. I DO change the recipe a little. I use ALL organic WHOLE WHEAT flour  (no spelt) , I add 1TBSP of  all Natural HONEY,  1 TBSP REAL VANILLA extract (NO imitation vanilla) , I add a little EXTRA  of the ALL Natural Peanut butter  THAT DOESN'T  have the Hydrogenated oils (the kind that make the PB hard and more solid to spread)  they are the same as trans fats and not good for anybody makto make it more peanutty and I use the red flax seeds. The dogs love them and they DO last  LONGER than they say  if you keep them in a cool, dark, dry place. I keep them in a screw top jar, but have kept them in the cupboard in ziplock large baggie for a little about 3 months just fine.

I used almond flour instead of spelt and ground up oats for the wheat flour. Other than that I followed the recipe and the dogs loved them. My sisters are asking for recipes because their pups are begging for them. (One has a sensitive stomach and it didn’t bother him. ??)

I halved the recipe because I just didnt feel like cutting out cookies forever, and they came out a little too dry. Cut the baking time if you cut the recipe down. My second batch I did 30 mins and they were much better.

Easy to make, and my dog (and his friends) love them! I roll the dough out and use a cookie cutter. I save old loose leaf tea tins to store them in.

Dog, loves these.  Pretty healthy compared to the store bought ones.
Simple to make, I cut recipe in half, sometimes  I add grated carrots or pumpkin puréed, if using any or all just adjust the water.

My big dog loves this recipe! The recipe doesn't  mention it but dissolve the peanut butter in the warm water and mixing/ kneading is a lot faster.

It made a lot of biscuits and was easy to do, although took a lot of extra flour when kneading as it was very sticky. I tasted these myself and frankly you'd not have a clue they had peanut butter in, I would recommend adding much more if you're going to attempt them. The ingredients are pricey though for a disappointing biscuit.

Great Recipe BUT I used special dog peanut butter.  Because Regular Peanut Butter is TOXIC for dogs.

We made these for our dogs. However, after eating the treats- all three became tired. Has anyone else had this happen? The dogs LOVED them. However, I am now concerned because they are all sleeping so well. Even my grumpy dog that growls at the slightest movement. And the hyper one that is always running and chasing his tail. They are up moving, but just extra tired... Maybe the extra full belly.

I made this exactly and my dogs seem to enjoy it. I think next time I will add more peanut butter and cook for less time. A little too crunchy but otherwise a winner.
