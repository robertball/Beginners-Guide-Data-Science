Who doesn't like three different meats strung up on a stick? These were great and a lot of fun. I did make one change and that is that I used lil smokies in place of the link sausage but I only did that because we do not care for breakfast sausage. It is common here in Arkansas to cook lil smokies in bbq sauce and grape jelly so it only made sense. I'm sure breakfast sausage would be great in this if you like it. The one change I will make when I fix these again is that I will pre-cook the bacon a little bit before assembling the skewers. I like my bacon crisp and I cooked it as long as I could without burning everything else and it still wasn't quite as crisp as I like but that is just a personal preference. These were fun and something I will definitely make again!

I made this and used some of the suggestions. I used thick bacon and cooked it only until white and still limber enough to bend but firm enough to handle better, it also cooked until crispy.  I used lil smokeys instead of breakfast sausage mostly because they were precooked.  I made the ham the exact size of the sausage when cut up. Everyone wanted the recipe so I will give it to them the next breakfast. Thanks to the one that put this on here and thanks to all the great suggestions too. Loved it.

Quick,  simple and delicious. I omitted the ham and sauce and jelly, and used Cherrywood smoked, thick cut bacon and Lil smokies; it was a hit!
