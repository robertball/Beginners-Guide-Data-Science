This was very easy and had wonderful flavor.  Because I used a quality sausage (Johnsonville) there was no need to drain and discard the grease as it was perfect for the amount of flour.  We enjoyed it.

Yummy!  We prefer a thicker gravy so the only change I made was to reduce the milk to 3 cups and the flour to 1/3 cup.  Tasted wonderful.

This was fantastic according to my family (I couldn't taste it b/c I made it for everyone when I had a cold). We normally use the packet stuff and I wanted to try to make it from scratch. I did add considerably more pepper (we like it very peppery), a couple shakes of garlic salt, and a smidge more Worcestershire. It thickened up perfectly and made quite a bit. I love that I can make it using ingredients that I usually have on hand. Definitely a keeper, I added it to my recipe box:)

I've made this many times now. My son teenage asked if it was from a packet, I said "no".  He said to "Be sure not to lose this recipe". No alterations needed. For a thicker gravy just simmer a little longer.

I gave it only 4 stars because it is too thin following the original recipe.  Instead of 4 cups of regular milk, I used 3 cups of 2% and 1 cup half & half.  This helped thicken the gravy and made it creamier.  Otherwise, the flavoring was very good and everyone enjoyed it.

Great recipe! First try at making it and it came out perfect. The only changes I made were I added more bullion (I used a paste called Better than Bullion) and more pepper and pinch of salt. Oh and I used less milk; 3 cups. It turned out great!

This was super easy to make. The flavor good. I like my gravy a little thicker next time I may add a little less milk and a splash of hot sauce. Great on biscuits.

Great recipe! I used 3 cups milk to have a thicker gravy and had bullion cubes so used 2 feeling like it was about a tablespoon. Another said the recipe was salty and knowing how salty the sausage was thought 2 bullion cubes would be salty enough. It did need more salt. I think 1 bullion cube per cup of milk will be perfect. Otherwise, great flavor! Thank you!

Really good, never thought to add boullion before and it made a nice addition and rounded out the flavor really well. I didn't need quite so much sauce so I only used 2 cups of milk and needed to adjust the worcestershire accordingly but we really enjoyed this and will definately make it again. Thank you for sharing the recipe with us Tami.

I make sausage gravy in my house fairly often. To make it a complete one pan meal, I add a bag of frozen mixed vegetables while it is simmering.

My husband and I love this gravy! I’ve made it several times exact to the recipe and it is super easy and most delicious!
