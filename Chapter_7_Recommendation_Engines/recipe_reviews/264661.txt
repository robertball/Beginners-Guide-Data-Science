I give it 3 stars because I think you could work with it. I just made the frosting and was very disappointed. I only made 1/2 a batch and double checked to make sure I read it right. For 1/2 a batch 1 c of butter made it more buttery than the standard buttercream frosting. I wanted a Swiss merguine for that light airy, not heavy sweet and butter. For that reason I would add 1Tsp at a time until you reach the desired flavor, I wish I would’ve done 1 Tblsp at a time so as not to hv wasted the effort that went into double boiler, seperating egg whites, waiting for sugar to dissolve only to end up with essentially silky buttercream frosting in the end.

These were pretty good. I just couldn't bring myself to use the full 1 1/2 cups of butter in the cupcakes though (it just seemed a bit much to me), so I only used 1 cup, and that worked just fine. They were still moist and tasty. I also used buttermilk in place of the regular milk, and really enjoyed that flavor as well. For the frosting, it just wasn't my favorite. I think that's just my own preference, though, because I prefer the taste and ease of American buttercream frostings. Overall, I like the cupcake recipe, with using just 1 cup butter and buttermilk in place of regular milk. I got 24 cupcakes out this, and they were perfectly done in 15 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time ever making cupcakes from scratch and tbh i was a little nervous about what it was going to turn out to be, but it turned out to be amazing.  The one thing I changed was I added 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla instead of 1. I definitely recommend this recipe.

Very buttery, which isn’t surprising with the amount that’s in there. Cake was very dense for me. Just okay. Did not try the icing as I made my own from another recipe.

I made a few changes in adding a little more milk and sifting the flour to make it moist and fluffy. Yes I will definitely bake this dish again for parts and other occasions

Very, very good cupcake. I cut the butter down to one cup and separated the eggs so I could fold in the whipped whites. These are delicious!

I had something else in mind for filling and topping so I didn't make the frosting.

I only made the cupcakes, the recipe was simple to follow but they are pretty dense. I used another recipe for the frosting and it was a lot to take in because of how dense they were.

I didn't reduce the butter and wish I had. The cupcake liners came out greasy.  But the batter was luscious and thick and delicious. The recipe made much more than 24 cupcakes for me.... 24 large cupcakes and 24 mini cupcakes.

I didn't really enjoy the buttercream because even though I followed all the instructions, it came out runny. But the cupcakes were the best I've ever had!!! Definitely going to make again :)

I didn’t actually put on the buttermilk frosting. Just because I did not have all of the ingredients.

Loved it because I added my own twist to it. I added more vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon and came out delicious! My family loves cupcakes. I'm 11 year old and I made these delicious cupcakes! :3
