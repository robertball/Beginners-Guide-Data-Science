More than 20 years ago, I made this cake for my brother when he was in the hospital, after clipping the recipe from the newspaper. I remember he thought it was a slice of heaven! I lost the recipe and have looked for it repeatedly over the years, only managing to find cake recipes that were "close," but not quite it. I was thrilled to find the recipe again! This is a great and easy cake, though my preference is without the cinnamon.

This cake is definitely decadent yet easy! You'd really never know it was a boxed cake - it's that good! It's very dense, moist, rich, and chocolately - what more could you ask for from such a simple recipe! You really don't even need frosting, just a dusting of confectioners' sugar which provided a nice contrast and didn't ruin the flavor. I did omit the cinnamon and swithed the amounts of water and coffee liqueur. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. This cake is perfect when you don't have time to make a scratch cake but want something that tastes like you did!

Best Chocolate Cake ever!!  I have been on a (very expensive, very messy) quest, making recipes from many sites, one of which is the acknowledged king of cooking sites--America's Test Kitchen,and I have just not been happy!  However,  I can tell you, for texture, moist and dense, chocolate flavor that is intense but not overwhelming, this is your cake! My search is over!!  PS:  You don't need frosting for this, but I would suggest a little confectioners sugar or cocoa powder dusted over the top and maybe a fresh fruit and mint garnish just for looks.  Many times when people see a cake in a bundt style they assume that it is dry and crumbly... This cake would be passed on by at the potlucks I go to--My husband calls it a "Sleeper" cake, you can put it out and be assured that there will be a piece left for you when you are ready for it--it won't get gobbled up unless someone knows your secret.  FYI: I made Bobby Flay's Dark Chocolate Mousse as an over the top combination...

I was still full from dinner, but I made the ultimate sacrifice and taste-tested a sliver of cake--now I am nearly in a chocolate-induced coma. It is so moist, with pockets of creamy chocolate, and very rich. I used fat-free, sugar-free pudding mix and light sour cream, thinking I would save a few calories; then (I'm embarrassed to admit this) I negated the calorie-save by drizzling on an entirely unnecessary chocolate glaze. For the liqueur, I used half butterscotch schnappes and half coffee liqueur. Wonderful recipe!

GREAT! My family just LOVED this cake! Very chocolate-y! I served with frosting on the side so everyone could frost as much or as little as they wanted.  Followed recipe on box of powdered sugar for buttercream frosting and added 1/3 cup of cocoa to make it chocolate. Excellent!  TIP: Use cocoa instead of flour when dusting the bundt pan - you won't see white flour all over your pretty chocolate cake!

This cake was easy to make and very moist. I only gave it 4 stars because my family found the coffee liqueur taste to be overpowering. I will try this again without the liquer. I used a Bundt Cake Glaze recipe from this site and it was very good on the cake.

I cut the calories a bit by using sugar-free fat-free pudding mix, and it tasted great! I also used mini chocolate chips, just 1 cup. I added 1/3 cup of white creme de menthe liqueur for a subtle mint taste. We liked it a lot; I might even try adding 1/2 cup next time.

It was plenty chocolaty, but um well....it just wasn't that  GOOD.  Though I followed the recipe exactly, mine was dry.  If you try it, up the oil or something.  As for me, I'm looking for another recipe, sorry to say.

This turned out pretty good. My cinnamon is really potent (Penzey's Chinese Cassia) so I reduced the measurement down to 1/2 teaspoon and I still think the cinnamon flavor was a little prominent for my taste. Didn't have any coffee liqueur, so I just used some cold coffee. Husband asked for seconds and my Mom was in the kitchen "cleaning up" the edges of the cake, so I guess they found it tasty. Served it with vanilla ice cream.

This cake is just awsome! It really is better made a day ahead, very moist. I made mine in an angel food cake pan following the exact directions. I frosted it with my favorite Fluffy Peanut Butter frosting from the site. My boyfriend's son asked for this for his birthday cake and I'm really glad I tried this cake! Liked by all!

Excellent recipe.  Simple to make.  Instead of coffee liquer, I used GODIVA LIQUER... a small sample bottle that was the exact measurement called for.  Very moist and the chocolate-ness made me swoon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Tonight I tried this recipe for the first time, in honor of my partner's birthday.  I was nervous about trying a bundt for the first time, but oh my goodness.  Everything you said was true - it didn't need icing, a chocolate lover's dream.  Even my dad, who has a low tolerance for chocolate, had three pieces before he could hit the hay.  I will definitely try this recipe again, it was a big hit, and I'll try my hardest not to pass it for my own!

about 20 minutes in the oven, I realized I had forgotten to put any oil in!  I also was only able to use half cup sour cream so substituted the other half cup with buttermilk.  I thought this recipe was doomed for failure.  I can attest to the fact that even without the oil, this was still moist enough to be saved from the garbage can.  I subbed out the water with cold coffee.  I am not sure I would add the cinnamon next time.  although not overpowering, I could still taste it and not sure I liked it all that much.  I'm sure with the oil, it would be very moist and decadent.  It really didn't taste like a cake mix.  Although I am mostly a 'from scratch' person, this was a good way to use up an on-sale mix.

This recipe is identical to the Too Much Chocolate recipe on this site with the exception of this one adds coffee liqueur.  I made for the parish priest and he said it needs to go on the bake sale.  Look no further.  This is the one.
