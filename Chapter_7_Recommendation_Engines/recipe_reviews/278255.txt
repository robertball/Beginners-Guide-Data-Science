This is a better recipe than the one I was using, cornbread was moist not crumbly and had a sweet peppery taste to it.  the cooking time was a little off, it took me 32 minutes in gas oven to get the center done but worth the wait.

I only gave it a 4 star rating only because I don't like sugar in my cornbread. In my opinion, that is unnecessary.
