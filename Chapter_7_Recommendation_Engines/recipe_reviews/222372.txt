First time trying salmon burgers using whole salmon vs canned. I chose to skin it and debone it, which was a little time consuming but no big deal. The mixture held together nicely and didn't crumble when I put it in the pan. The flavor was fantastic! My husband raved about them and definitely wants them again! They are very tasty and a nice change from salmon fillets.

My kids loved these burgers!  They didn't leave a crumb behind!  I wasn't exactly sure how many pounds of salmon I had, so I used 2 eggs to be safe and they stayed together perfectly.  We topped them with melted cheese and tomatoes on a whole wheat bun, fantastic meal and a nice change from the ordinary.

My husband and daughter both really liked these. They were easy to put together and to cook. I served them on thin whole wheat buns with lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise. Sides of coleslaw and red potato fries made a nice accompaniment. These  didn't need any egg to bind them, as salmonis pretty sticky. Thanks!

Thanks for posting a recipe with fresh salmon. My husband loves canned salmon and I've tried a similar recipe, but I loved this one. Used an onion, because I didn't have scallions and added some additional seasonings, plus a bunch of fresh herbs. Saut√©ed in some olive oil and I thought it was great. Hubby wants canned salmon, but I'll use this more often and buy the canned salmon for him. Great recipe. So easy and light.

I love, love, LOVE tuna burgers so I thought. .... why not! 
Preparing the fish was a little yucky; which is to be expected. ( It smelled great when it was cooking! ) I did set the patties in the fridge a few min. To firm up which helps a lot....anywho, once everything was all ready I took one bite and spit it out! It was awful. It tasted like fishy nasty in my mouth. If you're thinking I don't understand the "star system" you're wrong.  My family seriously like it. My 13 year old daughter even ate mine AFTER eating her own. They all just ate it up! So I would recommend it, maybe I am the only one that hates it!!

this came out really good with a few modifications based on what we had on hand and what we like/prefer.. our salmon was closer to 2 lbs, subbed cilantro for parsley, coconut flour for bread crumbs, and half/half of blacken seasoning and garlic salt for the seafood seasoning.. instead of the olive oil i used one egg.. we made these on our plancha (flat top) on our gas grill.. three minutes per side was our magic number.. ty for the recipe

I wouldn't make this recipe again. The burgers fell apart as I was cooking them (I should have used eggs instead of oil) and they tasted very acidic. The juice from one lemon is too much for this recipe and it needed more bread crumbs than what the recipe called for. Next time, I will stick to my salmon burger recipe but I will add a couple of teaspoons of lemon juice to spice it up.

Nice egg free version (no mayo) for making salmon burgers/patties and easy to convert to gluten free by using GF bread crumbs. I only had bottled lemon juice on hand and reduced to half as the mixture smelled a little too lemony at that point. They were perfect, but found we had to add more bread crumbs to try binding the mixture (used fresh salmon). Recipe needs some sort of binder to hold the patties together better. Ours fell apart a little in the pan, but not too bad. Used Jan's Old Bay Seasoning Substitute (from this website), which worked great flavor wise in this recipe. Topped the burgers with McDonald's Tartar Sauce Copycat, also from this website. Overall, a very tasty recipe and will make it again with some minor tweaks.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Neither my husband nor myself liked it. Using fresh salmon as opposed to canned made it "chewy".

I choose to serve these as patties, without a bun. I found them to be on the acidic side and very wet. My guess would be that my lemon, even though it was small, produced a larger amount of juice, about 6 tbs. The amount of juice can vary from lemon to lemon so I find it helpful if the amount is measured. I used three times the amount of  bread crumbs to make them come together, 6 tbs. If I make these again I would cut back on the lemon juice and add a tbs or finely chopped red pepper to balance the acid. I served these with oven sweet potato fries and a spinach salad.

These were surprisingly good. I guess I've had other bad salmon burgers, but I have literally nothing bad to say about these. And I'll definitely make them again! I used fresh salmon and followed the recipe exactly. We ate these plain (i.e., without a bun), but they'd be great on buns, too.

My family really enjoyed these salmon burgers! I never liked salmon patties or burgers until this recipe. I used fresh Coho salmon. I'm happy to report that my husband said he could eat them every night AND... that they were better than the ones his Mom used to make. SCORE! These will be a staple in my recipe box. Thank you!

I did this over the weekend and my husband loved it so much. They were very good and held up on the grill perfectly
