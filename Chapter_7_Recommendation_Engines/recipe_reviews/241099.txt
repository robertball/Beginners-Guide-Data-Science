We all enjoyed these fajitas, I did marinate my chicken overnight and my husband grilled the chicken, there really wasn't enough marinade to cook on the stove top to baste (believe me I tried), but the chicken was still tender and juicy. We did use some salt and ground pepper for more flavor when grilling.
I didn't have lettuce but cheese and green onions made a great substitute. I would suggest some garlic and pepper to flavor the vegetables while simmering. We've been getting some summer like weather and already feels too hot to cook in the kitchen, so this was a perfect easy meal for a night like that.

Our grill was broke so I cooked the chicken breast in the oven on broil for twenty minutes in a cast iron skillet, turning every 5 minutes and basting. Then I cooked the onions and peppers in the juices from the bottom of the pan. Delicious!

Loved this recipe! I tripled the marinade but didnâ€™t soak the breasts at all, just basted them while they were grilling. Seasoned the breasts with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. 

Added some pico de Gallo and sour cream and these were great!

Very Good!.  I didn't have any jalapeno peppers on hand, so I added Picante salsa to the marinade.  I also used smaller tortillas (fajita size).  This will become one of our regular dishes.
