WOW! This recipe was super easy. They took longer than 15 min to set up, but half of the cookies were gone before they were set. I used Devils Food Pudding Mix (Highly Recommended) and cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups. I used the stove top, and let the mixture boil for 2 min. then added the pudding and oats. PERFECT! A nice change from the regular no bake recipe.

Original recipe is confusing as far as evaporated milk goes. 1/2 can (12oz) means 6oz, so maybe that's why others had problems with the cookies setting.  I read it wrong the first time too and almost dumped in the whole can.  I used 6 oz and they were not too moist at all, actually almost too dry.  They didn't set on their own so I popped them in the oven at 400 for 7 min.  I had no parchment paper so I just sprayed the cookie sheet with PAM and it worked fine.  Any longer than 7 min though and they burned (oops).  I also used splenda, fat-free/sugar-free pudding, and fat-free evap. milk.  Will try to experiment with butter substitute next time.

Great Recipe!  Based on other reviews, I did lessen the amount of sugar and I cooked it on the stove rather than the microwave.  I also used Pistachio instant pudding and reduced the amount of oats and added 1 cup of coconut.  I brought them into work because my co-workers are my recipe guinea pigs...they loved them!  Thank you!!!

Good and easy cookies!  I made mine with chocolate instant pudding.  I only rated these four stars because I cut back the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and the butter to 1/2 cup, and cannot imagine 2 cups of sugar in these!  I love sweet treats and even with the sugar cut back these are just about as sweet as I could tolerate.  Mine set up perfectly.

A very good recipe considering it's so quick and easy. i halved the recipe and added unsweetened cocoa powder since other reviewers seemed to indicate that their cookies turned out very sweet and liked the cocoa version of this. My cookies seemed to set just fine, but I used as much oatmeal as seemed necessary in order to make the cookies form more solidly.  Towards the end I rolled up sunflower seeds in the cookies, and my roommate like the seeded ones even better.

edit: i decided i wanted the cookies to be less sticky, so I smushed the cookies into a cookie-like shape (flatter) and baked the no-bake cookies for about 15 min. at 400  deg. Crunchy outside - chewy inside. Even better!   Perhaps defeating the purpose, but tasty nonetheless.

This recipe is a new staple for us! I love it! I did adjust the portions based on a few reviews and wanted to cut down on fat - I used 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup), 2/3 cup of sugar.  They turned out so yummy, and not sure if the reduction in butter made them less gooey but mine sat fine. Not sure where they get 48 servings though, I made 24 rounded tablespoons and they turned out great! Thanks for sharing!

These aren't bad for as simple as they are.  However, I like the ones made with Hershey's Cocoa better.  These are very easy to make, and I had no problems with mine firming up, just a matter of preference here.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are super sweet.  Very easy, a good summer cookie because you only need the microwave.  My 6 year old daughter and I made them and she loved the fact that she could do pretty much everything herself.  We used chocolate fudge pudding and they are nearly as good as brownies!

this tasted GREAT!!! everyone that can over to my house loved them. But instead of making a bunch of cookies out of them i lined a 13'' by 9'' cake pan with wax paper and put the "batter" into that needless to say it didnt harden but they stayed moist and very gooey...and they still tased great!

I was looking for a way to use up a box of butterscotch pudding mix and came across this recipe.  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, butter to 1/2 cup, used 1/2 cup skim milk instead of evaporated (didn't have any), added 1/2 cup shredded coconut and 1/2 pkg butterscotch chips after everything else was mixed.  They were not runny or pasty and set up nicely.  I managed to get 24 good sized cookies and even though they are sweet they are good!

This was an easy recipe to make.  My cookies did "set" after awhile but it took longer than the time specified in the recipe.  We are able to pick them up but they are sticky.  I'm not sure if I boiled the liquid long enough.  Our microwave is smaller and it took longer to bring the liquid to a boil and then the door is frosted and it's hard to look w/o opening door to see if boiling or not.  Next time I may try making on stove top as others have done.  Used vanilla pudding mix and it had a good taste but very sweet!

This is a delicious cookie.  I used 1-1/2 cups sugar (instead of 2), I added a cup of chopped walnuts and drizzled it with almond bark.  My family and co-workers absolutely loved them!

It seems that most people who are successful with this recipe have changed it to some degree.  After following the recipe exactly I had an unacceptable result.  I am going to try it once more using some of the suggestions in the reviews.  Cut the butter and sugar, add more oats or other dry ingredients as needed to get the firm dough required for the cookies to set up.  If I get it to work, I'll add a custom version of the recipe.    If you followed these ingredients but changed it to low fat, sugar substitute, etc. then it would be nice to share exactly what you did for others to follow.  Because that changed everything about the recipe.  That change used the IDEA of it but not the details of it.  It;s really a new recipe at that point.

I made these with the chocolate fudge pudding.  They're WAY too sweet, and I love sweet treats!  I would cut the sugar down or just put in cocoa powder (unsweetened) other's have already recommended.  I skimmed the reviews and didn't catch that.  If I make them again I will cut down on the sugar and use unsweetened cocoa.

This recipe is gr8 big change from the basic "no bake cookie".  Although I had problems w/the cookies setting up..even added more oats and was still runny.  The 1st batch I cooked in the microwave..thought maybe I didnt cook it long enouph..2nd batch I cooked on the stove for a minute and a half..Both batches didnt set...Was wondering if anyone has any ideas how 2 make em work or what I did wrong.. These cookies have a gr8 taste and would love 2 try making them again w/out eating them off the wax paper.

I found these cookies tasted good but were very very messy.  I just could not get them to firm up. I put them in the frig for (2) days and they still would not firm up.  Not sure what was wrong, but I must admit making this recipe with unsweetened cocoa makes a much better cookie with no mess.

Very good cookies.  Took a bit longer to "set up" than I thought they would.  I made them chocolate because I didn't have butterscotch pudding.  Very good.

Easy to make, but were way to sweet and didn't set up very well. I had followed the instructions exactly, but the cookies were still sticky and hard to peel off the waxed paper.

I hate to ruin a good rating, but personally I thought these cookies were funny tasting.  My 4 year old loved them, but I think it's because he doesn't know any better.  The other ratings led me to believe these would taste a lot better.

I really liked the recipe and I added vanilla pudding instead of butterscotch and put in a little cocoa and cinnamon.  It was GREAT  and my 3 year old daughter helped me and it worked great.  Thank you very much for the recipe

I cut the sugar in half and the butter down to half a cup, I also used regular oats; i doubled the recipe though to usethe full can of evap. milk.  I boiled the sugar, butter, milk, and pudding mix on my stove as well. I'd planned to use these as lactation cookies, added 1/2 c. ground flaxseed meal and 1/2 c. brewer's yeast, but even with those added (plus 1/2 c. ground coconut), I find the cookies too sweet and quite soft - I prefer my no bake cookies firmly set up.  If I use this recipe again, I am decreasing the butter to 1/4 cup, and using a sugar-free pudding mix, plus adding peanut butter.  I am giving the recipe 3 stars because it was just ok, not great. But my kids will help me eat them.

I bake cookies and cakes every week.  When making these I wasn't too sure....  Long story short....  Every single time I make these they disappear unlike any other cookie!  My kids love these!  Thanks!!

I followed the recipe exactly, but I used sugar free pudding and evaporated skim milk. They never hardened. They taste and feel kind of like fudge or icing w/oatmeal! I'm sticking to the regular pudding oatmeal cookies that you bake.
