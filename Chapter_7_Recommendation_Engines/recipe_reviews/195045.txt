Just like mom made! Here were my adjustments: one pound of hamburger instead of two (plenty), no onions (preference), no Parmesan cheese (bummer) and I make my own spaghetti sauce so I think that's why my dish wasn't bland as some others were saying. (My suggestion would be to add Italian seasoning and some garlic powder/salt) Also I didn't bake it in the oven, I just poured it all into my pot and heated it up in there. That's not going to change the flavor I don't think, it's just one less dish to clean and because yes, that's how my mom did it ;)

My family loved this recipe.  It was even better the next day!  The only thing I changed is that I used 1 lb of hamburger and 1 lb of sweet Italian sausage.  I'll definitely make this again.

good. I made it with shredded chicken and added dry ranch dressing mix  to the sour cream before adding it to the other ingredients.  I also took the above advice and cut the recipe in half.  I would definitely make this again.  Nice to have a change from traditional Spaghetti and sauce.

It's easy, it makes a lot, and it freezes well.  I make the whole recipe and either divide it into 2 9x11 casseroles, or 4 8x8.  I then freeze some to give to friends or have on hand for later!

Hmmm...not a whole lot of flavor, but very easy.  I cut the recipe in half and still managed to fill a 9 x 13 pan, perhaps my pan isn't deep enough.  I added some oregano, basil, and chopped fresh tomato when cooking off the beef & onion, and used whole wheat spaghetti, but even that didn't add enough interest for us to the overall taste.  Don't know what else to add...maybe some garlic, different cheeses...?  It did hold together nicely when serving, and my two-year old wanted seconds, so this gets 3 stars instead of just 2.

It was so good! Altho, I halved the recipe in half, and only did 3/4 cup sour cream. It was really good, I served it with bread and butter.

This was good. My son said he liked it better than regular spaghetti. Its really rich. I cut the recipe in half (we are a family of 6) and still had leftovers. I would make again.

I wouldn't call this the Best casserole but I'll make it again simply because my 5 yr old, 4 yr old, and 22 month old all gobbled it up.  They really liked it.  It was okay in my opinion.  I did half the sauce like others suggested and I'm glad that I did because it fit perfectly in my 9 x 13 dish.  If you're looking for something a little different, give the recipe a try.

I added a couple cloves of minced garlic, used a whole onion and only needed one jar of spaghetti sauce. I added some basil and oregano and a glug of red wine to the sauce. We liked this, but we liked another baked spaghetti recipe that used cottage cheese a little better. This was a nice base recipe for a hearty dinner that fed my three men well, with two extra lunches during the week for my husband.

This was wonderful! I browned my ground beef, till it carmelized, then added an onion, a large bell pepper and mushrooms. I used Paul Newmans sauce...YUCK!! it was pretty bad...so off I went to the spice cabinet trying to doctor it up..italian seasoning,garlic powder and sugar..it was so bitter. I also added some roasted garlic that I did this morning and gave it a taste, pretty good. I cooked it on the stove top for several hours, it got nice and thick. Then I added the sour cream and proceded with the recipe. DELICIOUS!!!  I used my LARGE glass casserole dish,I don't think it would have fit in a 9x13.So we have supper for the next couple of nights. Thanks for sharing.

My family liked this.   I used only one can of sauce but I added a small can of tomato sauce and some seasonings.  And I think I cooked my noodles a little too long.  I will make this again.

Not what I expected. I guess I should've cut the liquids by half. I used extra garlic, and spices. But it had a bitter osur cream taste. I don't care for it. I should've just made regular spaghetti. It would've been faster,and tasted better.

Great recipe to take to a family after a bro, death, etc. However, I add extra spices when making for my family to jazz it up a bit.

This was very good! Some reviewers said it was too bland, so I added some garlic powder and oregano to the beef and onions while browning (but I do that for most italian dishes anyway). Other than that, I made the recipe as written. I split it into two 9x13 casserole dishes (gave one to a family friend) and just one of them was more than enough for my family of 4 with plenty of leftovers. My toddlers both loved it! I think this would be a great option for a big potluck or church function. You could probably fit it all into a big disposable foil lasagna pan (the 9x13 ones are deeper than your average 9x13 pyrex). We will definitely be making this recipe again.

The sour cream overwhelmed the flavor of the spaghetti sauce.  I added more spaghetti sauce to compensate resulting in a looser texture.  I also added oregano, salt and a bit of sugar.  My family liked it and cleaned their plates, but I didn't like it at all and won't be making it again.

My hubby and I liked this and my picky son absolutely loved it, came back for thirds when he never even does seconds!  My changes were minimal and based on what I had on hand, I topped it with fresh mozzarella (yumm) and halved the sour cream in which I had the full fat on hand.  I also layered it instead of mixing it all together (sauce, noodles, cheese, repeat, end with sauce, topped with mozz).  In the end it was too much to fit into my 9x13 so I mixed what was left and also made an 8x8.  Both were very good.

I really enjoyed this dish. Sour cream added a bit of tang. I added a little garlic salt,pepper and crushed red pepper. I also cut the recipe and half, enough for 2 people plus leftovers.

Made this recipe instead of regular spaghetti. It was a big hit. Easy and delicious.  I halved recipe and added a little more cheese. I didn't have sour cream so  I used a little cream cheese instead and it worked fine. My son ate the left overs.... which he normally won't touch.  Great recipe that may just replace spaghetti in this? house!  Fyi...when I served it next day I sprinkled a little fresh parmesan cheese over it and microwaved! Yum!

An easy dinner.  My husband loved it, my teenager said it was 'OK' which is high praise as he is a picky eater.  As suggested by other reviewers, I added Italian seasoning and used a higher end pasta sauce (Gina Rispoli, Vodka flavor).  I would make it again.

I was worried about adding sour cream but did it anyway.  It was delish!  (I did not use fat free sour cream either).  I also added 4 oz of cream cheese, 1/2 cup shredded parmesan, and 1/4 cup of cubed butter to the hot pasta before combining it with the meat mixture which was 50/50 ground beef and ground Italian sausage.

Total winner! Husband and toddler loved it. My modifications: made it with ground turkey instead of beef. And I seasoned the turkey with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper and garlic powder. Also, I used minced onions by McCormick. I drained the spaghetti and then put it back in its pot where I combined everything. This makes A LOT and it would have been too much to combine everything in the skillet I browned the meat in. I totally overlooked the bit about covering with foil to bake. But I'm glad I did because it allowed the top to crisp up a little, which we all really liked. This is going in the meal rotation!

This is bland - I was in a hurry and I would add more herbs, some cayenne, etc to it in the future. Heed those who point out the HUGE amount the recipe creates; I used what I would normally use to make spaghetti at home, and it would have filled a 9x13 and a 9x9. My son and my BF and his dad LOVED this. They ate huge amounts. So I will make it again, but for a 9x13, I'd make half the box of farfalle to mix with 1 lb ground beef (or Italian sausage), one jar Newman's Sock-A-Rooni, 8 oz sour cream, and about a cup of parmesan, 1-2 C mozzarella. I added herbs, but I'd add wine and cayenne and/or red pepper flakes next time.

Delicious! Seasoning the meat and using flavorful jarred pasta sauce made this have quite enough flavor. Love that it is a crowd pleaser and can be made easily to feed large groups as well!

This was a big hit tonight! I added some minced garlic, oregano, and chopped meatballs to the hamburg/onions and only used one jar of marinara sauce. It was delicious. I will definitely be making this again. This would be great to take to a potluck,sick neighbor, etc.

pretty good, but not any better than regular spagetti and not as easy to make. If I put in the extra effort I want it to taste better than the original

I followed the advice of others and divided in half (except for cheese and spaghetti).  I altered this recipe by whisking together two eggs and 1 cup of whole milk and stirring the mixture into the cooked spaghetti.  Then, I added the ground beef mixture from this recipe into the spaghetti mixture I concocted. I mixed eveything thoroughly, and poured into the prepared casserole dish. DELICIOUS!

I have made this numerous amount of times. However, I've  used cream of mushroom soup instead of sour cream. I do use Italian seasoning. My family loves it.

I added a mix of mozzarella and cheddar. I also added more vegetables (bell peppers and mushrooms) and chopped pecans on top for a little crunch. The only thing I will omit next time is the sour cream, it gave it more of a taco taste rather than spaghetti. It makes a lot!! So if you’re feeding less than 4 people, I would half the meat and sauce.

I used Italian seasoning and garlic powder, as well as extra onion when browning the beef, and I think the grease adds great flavor so I did not drain it.  I used full fat sour cream and organic marinara sauce.
I decided to bake it for the first 20 minutes covered in tin foil so the noodles don’t get so dry. I folded the tin foil into a tent shape so the cheese does not stick to it. I finished by baking for another 10 minutes uncovered (or until the cheese begins to brown.)

I didn't have all of the sour cream it called for, but put in what I had, and something else I used was not quite what it called for, but it was basically VERY good!! 
Yes, we will make it again with all the right ingredients in it, and split it into 4 small casseroles since there are only 2 of us and it made A LOT!  Yummy!!

Great recipe. I used 1 lb of beef and 1 lb of deer. Instead of sour cream I used ricotta. I also added extra sauce (marinara). Great basic recipe with room to tweak.

This was really good. I used a little more than two pounds of meat because we are meat eaters around here lol. I minced up about 5 pieces of garlic and added no Parmesan cheese because I have cooking way to much oven fried chicken which has Parmesan in it. Instead I used mozzarella and mild cheddar already shredded cause I’m lazy during the week. I did however simmer my sauce for about an hour before mixing everything and I layered it like you would with lasagna. Fantastic is all I will say!

Loved it - agree with another reviewer - 1 pound of meat is enough - added fresh garlic - used one jar puttanesca sauce (Black olives and capers) and one jar arabiatta (red pepper kick) - also used ground turkey which was fine - only had 12 ounces sour cream so substituted 4 ounces cream cheese - don't recommend - used Sargento aged and shaved parmesan - really good - used whole wheat pasta - was good

I usually make the other baked spaghetti recipe which everyone loves. I hadn't made it in a while handmade this recipe in error. I didn't tell anyone. They loved it, although they did say it tasted different. I told them about the mixup. Some liked this better some liked the other but they all loved either. Made exactly as written.

I halved the recipe as some others did. I also added chopped zuchini and some additional Italian seasoning to the sauce. Came out perfectly. I will definitely make this one again.

Great recipe, added a little more seasonings to it, everyone liked it. Nice to get ready early in day and pop in oven before dinner.

I am not a spaghetti fan at all. But my husband would eat spaghetti everyday without any arguement and this was a hit!! With me too!! If I could get away with it, this is the only way I'd ever make spaghetti. I did throw in some minced garlic and garlic salt just because I loooovvvveee me some  garlic any way I can get it!!!

I used 1 bottle of spicy Italian sauce and one 4 cheese flavored and only used 1 lb. of ground beef. It was delicious. It made enough for two casseroles, so I threw one in the freezer for a quick weeknight meal. It’s a keeper.

I thought this was okay.  If I were to make it again, I think I would use a different pasta....farfalle perhaps.  I would also add in some red pepper flakes to give it a kick.

I added Cajun & Italian seasoning to taste. We live in South Louisiana and like our food spicy! I don't measure so I can't tell you in measurement how much of each I added. Also, next time I'll probably cut the recipe in half or if I make the full recipe I'll bake it in a larger dish.

This is a good and easy recipe. I cut this recipe in half to make. I almost gave it 4 stars only because I did find it better to add one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce - otherwise, was a tad dry out of the oven. But, giving it a 5-star because to me the sour cream addition really gives it a great taste!  Would make this again!

This was so good.  I made it as directed except I dropped the only package of spaghetti I had on the floor and had to use Penne Rigate.  When I told my family about the spaghetti fiasco they both told me not to use spaghetti that they liked it exactly the way it was prepared.  I think this recipe would be good with any pasta.  Also, I made 2 small casseroles instead of one large and placed one in the freezer for another day.  Oh, I also had to bake it longer than 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes I took the foil off and it was not bubbly so I put it back in the oven without the foil for another 20 minutes.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I thought this was bland. I notice others recommend adding seasonings (Italian seasoning, garlic, & others) so will try that. I’ll also add more onion (1/4 cup/2 lbs. meat - why bother!). I like the idea of a spaghetti casserole for a pot luck (people recognize wht it is and most like spaghetti) and the servings are ample although a bit hard to dish out. I did make a mistake and got Cheddar instead of mozzarella. Instead of using the Cheddar I tried using the mozzarella snack sticks which, even though I “shredded” them did not work out at all.

AHHHHMAZZZING!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! Want to add though it states towards the top of the recipie where it has the prep and directions and instructions a Cook time of 55 Minutes! It's not 55 minutes. as you look down further in the directions towards the middle or bottom it says 30 minutes! O also put my own twist on it! rather than putting and making a spaghetti mixture. I put the sauce, meat, sour cream etc. into its own mixture. And then I did a sauce layer, noodles, cheese and layered it like lasagna. It turned out great!

This was a nice alternative to spaghetti and meatballs.  I used 1 lb chopped meat and one pound Italian sausage, sautéed them with onion and 2 cloves garlic and added them to my own sauce (2 lg cans crushed tomatoes, oregano, parsley, basil, salt, pepper and a small bit of sugar) and let it simmer for a couple of hours.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly and everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.  I'm only giving 4 stars since I made some alterations to make it more flavorful - but with changes, definite five. Thanks!

I'm not a fan of spaghetti in a casserole, so I substituted extra wide egg noodles for the spaghetti. I also used the garlic spaghetti sauce to add extra flavor, added an extra cup of mozzarella, and absolutely loved the result! Super easy to make, and leftovers taste great as well!

My whole family enjoyed this.  I used Italian sausage instead of hamburger (I always do) and it was delicious.  I would rather use one pound next time, not two.  Will definitely make again!!!

I used 1# of ground italian sausage, 8oz noodles, 23oz of jar sauce, 8oz of light sour cream and everything else the same. Still filled a 13×9" pan. Very creamy and deliscious.  Heated up great for leftovers.

I used chicken breasts and grilled them w/ Italian seasoning and garlic...  then chopped it up and added instead of beef.  Covered on 375 for about 20 mins then took off cover sprinkled some fresh basil on top and then cooked for about another 10 mins (uncovered) to make a crust on top.  Very tasty.  Great dish for week night cooking for the whole family to enjoy.

It is absolutely fantastic! Although it did not fit into the skillet I had to use a huge pot to mix it and the casserole pan was a tad small and the cheese didn't melt much so I took the foil off and left it in for another 5-8 minutes and it is wonderful!

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good either. I omitted the meat and loaded the top with veggies (mushrooms, tomatoes and green olives). The sauce is ok, but fairly bland. If you want something similar but far tastier, try spaghetti pizza I.

This dish literally made me lick my plate clean! I did tweak the recipe a bit, I used more mozzarella and Parmesan than it called for and added some mrs dash Italian seasoning, garlic salt, oregano and Italian sausage and instead of using spaghetti I decided on penne Zitoni. I will definitely be making this in the future!!

This was great to use up leftover noodles and sauce.  I used cheddar/jack shredded cheese and Italian seasoning as well as dehydrated onions.  I did not add meat since we had some meatballs in the sauce.  I also put in less cheese than called for and put pepperoni splices on top.  My whole family loved it!!!

Loved it! Will make it again.  I used a flavorful Classico spagetti sauce. Definitely could half the recipe. We ate off of it for two days and still had leftovers.

I made this but I'd recommend adding a little more spice and I replaced the ground beef with Italian spice sausage.I found it to be a little plain.I added breadcrumbs and mozerella/Cheddar on top to give it a more "casserole" look :)

Put lots of spices such as used in spaghetti. Recipe made entirely too much sauce so I reduced the meat to 1 lb. 
wasn't too impressed with this recipe since it was basically spaghetti.

Very good.  Threw in some raw spinach left over from a salad earlier in the week.  Simple to make, easy to serve and makes really good leftovers for lunch.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I added a few more seasonings to the ground beef (garlic powder, oregano, basil, and parsley).  I also also needed about half the sour cream noted in the recipe.  Overall very delicious!

Amazing, I have made this many times (the only change I made is more cheese). Family and friends can not wait for it to be made, I have to double the recipe so there is enough to go around to 4 different houses!

I substituted whole wheat macaroni elbows for the pasta because that is what I had and 1 pound of ground beef instead of 2. I will try it next time with the spaghetti but will continue to use only 1 pound of the beef. Worked out great! My family liked it.

Super easy!  Delicious!  I did swap the hamburger with turkey and used taco cheese instead of mozzarella only because I was out.  My noodles were whole grain.

Loved this recipe!!! Easy, delicious and inexpensive. I did spice up the meat with fresh garlic, dried basil, salt and pepper. I also used regular sour cream instead of light. Pairs well with a salad :)

This was easy and great tasting. I had to sub mayo for the sour cream (didn't have enough sour cream on hand and did not want to mix the two so I just used all mayo) no onion (taste), but everything else was added as directed. Will make this again and freeze half for later.

Just the wife and I at home now so I cut the recipe in half like some others suggested, and it still almost filled our cooking dish to the top. It really turned out awesome considering I am a total rookie in the kitchen. I used sweet Italian sausage(wife's favorite)in place of ground meat. My wife and I loved it. The only thing would do different next time is go with heavier portion of meat; otherwise the best spaghetti dish I have ever fixed.

I just finished making this, but I  sauteed one bell pepper, half onion  and added 1 pack of lipton onion soup mix along with garlic powder, shredded mild cheddar and my own seasonings. It was pretty good, still a little bland, but I'd make it again because my kiddo's loved it! So, thanks !

Awarded for 4 stars for inspiring my traditional spaghetti dish into a casserole of yum and then some!

I omitted sour cream. Added more seasonings and produce to impart more flavor. 

My additions included: crushed garlic, scallions, sliced green and red peepers, a single stabbed scotch bonnet pepper (in homemade spaghetti sauce), oregano, basil, etc.  I am big on flavor! Thanks for sharing.

This is really good and very easy. My go-to meal is usually spaghetti, and I was so happy to have found this recipe because its a great change of pace but still a home run. The only thing I changed was that I used shells instead of spaghetti noodles (it's all I had!) but I'm really glad I did, because scooping and serving was easy.
