10.21.18  Followed the recipe to the letter, and this turned out very well.  The sauce is delicious, and if you’re serving over rice or noodles, you may want to consider making more of it.  I like the idea of a chopped green onion garnish for some eye appeal, but I wouldn’t use the 1” green onion pieces next time, rather, I’d opt for sautéing slivers of a regular sweet onion (personal taste preference here).  I also could see substituting part of the olive oil with sesame oil, since I think the sesame flavor would be a good partner in the sauce.   Super simple to make, nice enough for company, but easy enough for a weeknight dinner.  Also, I think pork  tenderloin would be a good variation on this recipe and equally good.  Served with spicy sesame linguini and creamed succotash.
