I added a couple of things to the recipe and my family absolutely LOVED it.  I cut the milk back to 1/2C. Added a tsp of minced garlic. Mixed up a sauce packet of Alfredo sause to mix in, and added a little extra (about 1/2C of mozz. cheese & 1/4C of the parm cheese).  This was a great family meal.  Even my finicky toddler that is "never hungry" had seconds.  Plus we had plenty of left overs.

Did not like this recipe very much.  I think it used too much milk.  I also think it needed some spices, not a lot of flavor in it.  I added some mushrooms and diced ham to make it a complete meal but that didn't really add to the flavors at all.

I made this for dinner last night following the recipe exactly.  I served sauted chicken on the side and it made a great meal.  Everyone liked it.  The only change I would make is that it was a little dry for us, so next time I will add a cup of sour cream to make it more moist.  Otherwise excellent.

I rate this recipe 5 stars with the following substitutions/additions. It is a great base recipe! Just needed some tuning up :) I substituted cream of chicken instead of mushroom (just a preference for us) and only used 1/2 c. milk. I then added 2 tsp. minced onion and 1/2 tsp. minced garlic and 1/4 tsp pepper. I mixed all of this in a bowl instead of the pan (much easier that way) I also added shredded chicken to the pasta/broccoli mixture. Instead of mozzarella, I use Monterey jack & cheddar. Top top it off, I mixed seasoned wheat breadcrumbs with some melted butter and sprinkled it over the cheese. Soooo good! 2 kids and Hubby loved it!

I halved the recipe.  Due to what I had on hand & our taste preferences I subbed cream of chicken soup, med shell pasta, swiss cheese & reduced the amount of milk by at least 1/2.  I also only had about 1 cup of broccoli so I added some chopped cauliflower, chopped deli sliced turkey & a little chopped red onion.  Great way to use up ingredients in the fridge & pantry.  Could use a little more flavor - would probably add a little seasoning next time.
