yes!!! this is a wonderful frosting...soon to become one of my staples. When coloring, it comes out with a beautiful shine. For me, i had no cream of tartar so i used a pinch of salt in my egg whites and let it sit in them before i whipped them.  The salt or cream of tartar helps to denature the egg whites so you get a better, fluffier result! PERFECT!!!

This frosting tastes like marshmallows, has a beautiful shine, and holds its shape well.  I beat the egg whites in my kitchenaid until stiff before I began cooking the sugar and water.  I rewhipped for a few seconds before adding the sugar mixture, and whipped while pouring it in.  Don't stop whipping until the frosting becomes glossy/shiny.  The sugar/water mixture never became clear for me, but I poured it in anyway.  I added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the sugar water just to make sure it wouldn't crystallize.  It was delicious with Wacky Cake VIII, for a great layered birthday cake!!

This is a perfect frosting for cupcakes-you can color it any color, then just dip the cupcakes in the bowl to frost them (you don't even need a knife!) Since it contains egg whites, it will dry out and become meringue-like if left uncovered.  Keep the cake or cupcakes tightly covered and they should stay moist. Great recipe!

This review is for 'ALL' of the people who say that they can't get this recipe to work. I have been using a this recipe for over 40 years, and it is a beautiful frosting. It is great on all cakes, and it is soooooooo gooood!!!!!!!!!  The only way to make this fail is: not cooking your sugar mixture long enough. You need to cook it until it spins a 3 to 4 inch thread, and once it starts coiling, do not stir it, and when it has cooked long enough, pour it into the stiffly beaten egg whites (while you are beating them) in a thin steady stream, and then continue to beat the frosting on high until glossy.  TIP: For those who do not know about the 'spin a thread' test, just cook this for 7 minutes. That is the name of the recipe I have used forever...."Seven Minute Frosting", and it is exactly like this one.

Absolutely perfect! I had a craving for Wacky Cake and was tired of my usual powdered sugar icing so I tried this instead. I wasn't sure if the cream of tartar in my cupboard was still good but it worked. As other reviewers have said, this recipe makes plenty of light, fluffy, glossy, easy to spread frosting with a nice marshmallow flavor. With an egg white frosting, the key is to have a clean bowl and beaters without a speck of yolk. I don't yet own a stand mixer so I spent several minutes on it with my hand mixer but the results were worth it. My 8 year old daughter helped with it too. Why bother with store bought icing when you can make your own so easily? I can see lots of variations with this basic recipe too, as others have mentioned, with different extracts and using food color to tint. Fun!

I liked this recipe.  It turns out really pretty.  It's very white and smooth.  I liked the taste of it, it is not too sweet, but my kids didn't.  I had them try it before I put it on my son's birthday cake.  They didn't like it at all.  I used a tip from another review and added 1/4 tsp of almond extract.  They would eat it then.  I actually like it better with the almond extract too.  The 1/4 tsp adds just a hint of almond.  I would add more if you are a big almond fan.  I liked just the hint.

Yummy... just what I was looking for!  Took a little extra effort than other frostings, but mostly just time waiting to whip enough.  Not difficult... but just the fluffy, tasty frosting for my chocolate cake.  Be sure to be patient boiling the sugar though.  After a few minutes of boiling, little bubbles will appear on the surface.  Don't take it off too soon!

This was a successful recipe for me.  I made 2-9" rounds of the Black Chocolate Cake (available on this site) and needed something as a filling between the two layers.  I used half this recipe and the result looked like a big Oreo cookie-really cute!  The key to turning eggwhites into stiff peaks is an impeccably clean mixing bowl and beaters (no fat should remain) and a good electric mixer.  My KitchenAid stand mixer with the whisk produced the stiff peaks with no problems and the icing was nice and fluffy.

This frosting is just what i wanted.  It has the right sweetness and it looks shiny and fluffy.  I used this frosting with a piping bag to decorate 18 chocolate cupcakes.  This is truly a heavenly frosting.

This was really good!  I used it as frosting for ice cream cone cupcakes (cupcakes baked in actual ice cream cone cups).  It was very light and airy, shiny, and marshmallowy.  I followed the recipe exactly and made sure to whip it a lot!

I whipped this frosting for about 30 minutes, and still would not stand up when i piped it.  Tastes like marshmallows, not so much like icing. My cupcakes turned out alright, but I will probably use a different icing ext time around.  EDIT: The next morning the frosting turned into more of a froth...

I made this for a coconut chocolate cake and it was perfect. Nice and Fluffy with a marshmallow like flavor.  Years ago I use to buy a box mix for fluffy white icing and this tastes just the same.

This recipe was simple and delicious. I am on a quest to lose weight but still want to enjoy a treat once in a while and buttercream will kill me.  This was perfect on my chocolate zucchini cupcakes! Thanks for the recipe!! I've shared it with all my friends!

My mom used to make frosting like this.  It tastes a bit like marshmallows and yes, it is sweet because 1) it's frosting and 2) it has sugar in it.  But, it's not nearly as sweet as buttercream or frosting in a can.  I think the taste is great, but I suppose it's all about personal preference.

If yours came out runny, I would chalk it up to baker error.  Your bowl and beaters must be totally clean with absolutely no greasy residue.  Egg whites cannot have even a drop of yolk in them.  If they do, they will not form peaks.  

With sugar syrup, you can't cook it too long or else it will start forming a crust.  Pouring the syrup close to the side of the bowl helps incorporate the syrup gradually.

Delicious!!  I used a stand mixer and beat egg whites until VERY firm... I let the sugar mixture boil about 5-7 minutes AFTER it came to a boil.  I slowly poured in the sugar mixture in about .25 cup increments and when it was all in I mixed on high about 10 minutes.  I also added crushed candy canes to the mixture and a tiny bit of red food dye.  I put this on top of milk chocolate cupcakes with a milk choclolate candy center. They were AWESOME!!  I frosted a day in advance and experienced NO crystalization of the frosting nor did I get a crunchy top.  I was soft and marshmallowy....

Truly a light and fluffy recipe. If I could give two tips to help anyone else. First, it says to cook over medium high heat until bubbly. I really found that you almost need to go about thirty seconds past the bubbly. The sugar mixture turns clear and you should be able to see down to the bottom of your pot. Second, at the end it says to whip for 7-10 minutes. This is important and if you don't whip long enough you will not have a smooth frosting that holds up. You may even need to go a little longer than the ten minutes.  Overall, this is a fantastic, simple recipe that I will use over and over again. Thank you for sharing.

This isn't quite the recipe I have used previously, but I was silly and didn't save that one.  I used these quantities, but kept heating over a doub;e boiler like 7 minute frosting.  Worked brilliantly, just what I wanted, thanks.

Excellent recipe.  Amazing how similar it tastes to whipped marshmallows.  I followed the directions as written, except added a half teaspoon of almond extract and it turned out wonderful.  Very light and fluffy.  After frosting a cake I had a fair amount left over and put it in the fridge with plastic wrap over it.  Next day took it out and the quality had not diminished at all.  We dipped whole strawberries into that leftover frosting and OMG was that combo incredible.

This frosting ended up tasting like marshmallows but the consistency of whipped cream.  It was amazing.   I doubled the recipe to make sure I had enough and I had so much leftover that I kept making hot chocolate to put this on top of!

OMG! This is heavenly! Boiled the sugar-water-cream of tartar mixture for exactly 7 minutes as one reviewer suggested, mixed it in with the egg whites, let my KA do its magic for 7 more minutes and voila! Magical frosting that holds its shape perfectly and tastes like a piece of heaven. Thanks for the recipe! I will be using this over, and over, and over again!

It tasted great on my cake but the frosting itself I didn't like.
Just a quick note:  Don't make in in a metal bowl. It reacts chemically and changes the consistency and the taste.

Little better version:  Try 1c. sugar, 1/2 c. water, 1/2 tsp. white vinegar, dash salt. Stir till clear med/high heat, then boil without stirring till 242 degrees.  Add in thin stream to 2 beaten stiff egg whites. Then add 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Marshmallow type frosting-great for white cake with coconut on top. Holds shape very well and competes with Pepperidge Farm coconut cake any day.

I could NOT believe how easy this was to make.  I read the reviews and followed the general idea.  Make sure the whites are room temp and let the sugar mixture cool some before mixing.  Also, keep the beaters going and drizzle the hot liquid in.  This is the stuff!!!  Looks great on my dark chocolate cupcakes for Halloween!!!

So good!!  It totally reminds me of the marshmallow frosting we used to make in Home Ec. in high school.  I made the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III into cupcakes (but added slightly more cocoa per recommendations and then baked for 16 min), then I FILLED and TOPPED them with this frosting.  Oh ... my ... goodness!!  This is the best combination of frosting and cupcake I've ever (boy do I mean EVER) made.  Insanely delicious.

i didn't see any other reviews mentioning this, so i may be wrong, but i was unsure about using uncooked egg whites (i know the hot sugar syrup is mixed in, but i'm not sure if that would be enough to get rid of things like salmonella.) i used pasteurized egg whites to rid myself of this problem (the carton type, in white-only) and the frosting was amazing. it didn't get as stiff as it could have, probably because i didn't use real egg whites, but it was still a good consistency for frosting and i think a bit more cream of tartar will fix the thinness from carton whites. EDIT- research online led to me finding that the heat from the sugar mixture makes this safe for consumption without cooking.

for people that didn't get the right texture - if there is even a speck of yolk in your egg whites or a trace of fat in the bowl (oil etc), they won't whip right. also, try adding the cream of tartar to the whites instead of to the sugar mixture - it might help reach stiff peaks.

Hands down, this is one of my favorite white frostings. It's thick and creamy and has a very light vanilla taste. I've used this recipe on dozens of cakes. It works wonderfully for piping onto cupcakes (as shown in the picture). If you like light frostings or rich flavored cakes, this is the perfect icing to top them and also works great as a filling between cake layers. By far my most favorite thing, aside from licking the spatula, is the ease in flavoring it to go with whatever cake flavor you're making. I'd still recommend adding at least a 1/2 a tsp to 1 tsp of vanilla in addition to any extract you're using. One of my favs: orange or lemon flavor with white or vanilla cake. Sweet, dreamy heaven.

I found this to be delicious when it was fresh but it looked terrible the next day.  I frosted it the night before and the next day it looked dried up on the cake.  I would not recommend it to anyone.

This was a bit tricky for me at first.  I tried adding the sugar mixture AFTER beating the egg whites - it never set up right - was more like a sticky mayonaise.  Also, I think my bowl was too large.  I gave it another shot . . . I used a smaller bowl (medium, like the directions actually call for) and I started adding (very slowly) the sugar mixture to UNbeaten egg whites & started beating on high speed.  This worked PERFECTLY!  by 6 minutes of mixing, it was already the perfect consistency.  It was easy to color and I will definitely try it again with other flavorings.  It was very light & ultra fluffy with a glossy sheen to it.  It was pefect on a  chocolate princess castle bday cake for a 4 yr old girl.

I followed the directions to the letter, but my icing turned out terrible. I didn't even try to ice anything with it as the consistency was more liquid than frosting. I'll give it another try eventually!

Update, I made this again and topped mini cup cakes & I toasted them in the oven on broil for 60 seconds and they were awesome!!

This frosting was amazing! I used it for whoopee pie filling! I used my Kitchen aid mixer and room temp egg whites. I think most people are having problems with thier vanilla. It should be real vanilla, I used trader joes pure bourbon vanilla extract. I also streamed the hot sugar syrup in extremely slow while the kitchen aid was running on high. Turned out airy and beautiful! I think this is perfect for cupcakes or whopee pies. Not so much for cakes or layered cakes, unless you are not going for a smooth look. Perfect if you do chocolate cup cakes and sprinkle Graham crackers on top, like smores!

Was excited, but this fell flat for me.

- Light and foamy, almost reminiscent of something chemical.
- Yes, like marshmallow spread, no, not like frosting
- I added a touch of pure almond extract to give more flavor, and it was overpowering. Hard to find a happy medium
-Just not what a true frosting lover should go with.

Could be yummy for something else, like to dip fruit in. Not good for a cake, in my opinion. Thanks anyway!

This is YUMMY. Followed directions and turned out great. My first try would not fluff due to useing a stainless steel bowl that no matter how much you clean it must still have some residue. I switched to a glass bowl and then was successful. That would be my only advise-use a glass bowl.

This frosting came out light and fluffy, just like it said it would. It is a good idea to use pasteurized egg whites when making this to avoid the risk of salmonella. I believe the reasons that it come out too runny for some is that they either over beat their egg whites or they add the liquid mixture too quickly. That being said, I did not really like the flavour of the frosting. I normally LOVE meringue, but this frosting had a chalky after taste, possibly due to the cream of tartar. I would not make this again.

Perfection! This was an incredibly easy icing to make and pipes beautifully! MY TIP: boil sugar & water mixture to 230 degrees, then pour slowly into beaten egg whites. Beat for 7 minutes. I can't wait to try almond extract the next time I make it!I also didn't make it with cream of tartar, but added a dash of salt to the egg whites instead.

Good taste- like marshmallows. But, too runny, didn't stay on the cupcakes, and melted the sprinkles into an ugly mess.

I had some minor issues with this frosting.  I made this exactly as the recipe stated, and had great success with taste, texture, and appearance.  The issue I had was that the frosting deflated over a period of less than a day, and became weepy and froth-like.  I am not sure if this was due to not whipping it enough, or humidity.  I tried this recipe several times and whipped the frosting between 7 and 10 minutes and each time had the same result of deflation.  If served immediately, this frosting will do just fine.  For those wanting to prep cupcakes or cake ahead of time, this may not be the best recipe.

My niece and I made this frosting to go on the Rainbow Clown Cake cupcakes we made for her 7th birthday. She liked the frosting saying it tasted like marshmallows. I followed the recipe exactly. My cream of tartar was old so I didn’t know if it was doing what it was supposed to but the end result was a fluffy frosting as the recipe indicates. I ended up having to whip it for longer than the time indicated to get the fluff I was after. Since it was made with egg whites I made sure to refrigerate. The next day the cupcakes looked wet from where the frosting and the cake met. This frosting did not transport well for me. I sent a few cupcakes home with my niece and by the time we got them to her house which was 15 minutes away, the frosting had slid off the cupcakes. However, the end result was a light frosting that wasn’t too sweet, which is what I was looking for.

Turned out just like marshmallow cream. I beat the frosting for at least 15 min. and it never fluffed up. I'm guessing I didn't beat the egg whites long enough. I might try this one more time.

I loved this frosting. I thought the hot sugar water would deflate the whites but as long as you drizzle it in slowly while whipping the whites you'll be fine. Perfectly sweet and lacking the traditional fat and 4 or 5 cups of powdered sugar that normal frosting recipes call for, this will be sticking around for a while.

Well, it really DOES taste like marshmallows, that's for sure!
My first attempt was BAD - glossy and beautiful, but it never fluffed at all. I tried again because I was pretty darn sure it was because I did the eggs first and let them sit for a few minutes. Bad plan. Second attempt is much closer, but I wish I hadn't run out of clear baker's vanilla. The first one had a really super-white tint while this one is just really white. :) It's pretty darn fluffy - EXACTLY like marshmallow fluff in every aspect, in fact. I want to try again - this time I will whip the dickens out of those eggs, way past soft peaks. I want a frosting that will hold a shape sharply... the second one holds a shape, but in a cute and mooshy way. Still yummy, though!

This was the best!!! I used this recipe to make ice cream cone cupcakes and it couldn't have been any better! I was very concerned after reading the negative comments but there were so many more positive that I pushed thru the fear after reading the negative reviews and am SO GLAD I went forward with this recipe!! It is very reminiscent of marshmallow fluff but I added vanilla and almond extract in half and half portion and followed the directions to a Tee! Let me add though that I did use organic cane sugar not white bleached and it worked just as well an still was white even though the sugar wasn't. I added 1-1/2 drops of coloring and it came out the perfect shade of baby pink.  DO NOT let the negative reviews scare you, this will be my forever go to frosting!! It's awesome!

This frosting reminded me of marshmallow cream without the yummy marshmallow flavor. It was sickly sweet and waaaaay to sticky to even think about frosting a cake. If you piped it on with a tip and bag there may be a chance you won't get crumbs spread around but with a spatula? Forget it. I highly doubt I'll be making this again. I may as well use the marshmallow cream and have a better flavor.

I really liked this frosting. It's very pretty and shiny (from the cream of tarter).  I made a two layer cake and although beautiful it did slip quite a bit; we almost lost the top layer! I'm glad we didn't transport the cake. On cupcakes it's PERFECT! I will use this many times again. 
Things to remember: you need to make sure it beats in the stand mixer for 7-10 minutes!

WOW! Just WOW. Amazing! It is so tasty and shiny! I only had hand beaters so I just threw everything in the bowl on a double boiler and beat it on high for 7-10 minutes. I got this light, fluffy frosting that tastes like marshmallows! Amazing! 10 stars if I could!!

This frosting is perfect!  Not too sweet, so you can pile it high on cupcakes to make them look (and taste) so impressive!  Love the marshmallow taste.  Thank you for posting this awesome recipe!

this frosting is was indeed light and fluffy, it made my cupcakes look wonderful. But after a couple hours it turned into something more like marshmallows. Not to mention it tasted just like one too. Extremely sweet, and that's coming from someone with a bit of a sweet tooth. It was also a bit of a pain to whip...

but next time I would refrigerate it to cool it before putting it on the cake, we even decorated some cupcakes with the frosting the next day and it still looked great and held it's form.

I loved this frosting. I did make a couple of adjustments. First. I used 1 cup and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Second, I used almond extract instead of vanilla extract. I had no problem getting the mixture to stiffen up. Just turned up the hand mixer to almost full throttle. Yeah Hah.

Yuck!  This took a lot of effort to make, and then it ended up tasting just like powdered sugar.  I was extremely disappointed.  What a waste of time.

Made exactly to recipe and although it was tasty and smooth, it wasn't stiff enough for what I needed for my layered cake.  This would be a nice recipe for cupcakes or sheet cakes...IMO!  Loved the flavor and glad I tried this recipe.

Great recipe! I was making a huge batch of cupcakes for a fancy bridal shower, so I doubled the recipe and substituted half of the water for white wine. It gave the frosting a nice subtle, sophisticated flavor, and the cupcakes looked beautiful! I might try it out with red wine next time.

This was the BEST frosting I have ever had.  It was wonderful for decorating too.  It has a marshmallow like texture and taste.  My husband really hates marshmallow.  He loved this frosting on the cake.  I did take several reviews into consideration and added 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.

This frosting was delicious.  It tastes like it is made from marshmallows.  Everyone raved.  I whipped for less than the 7-10 minutes listed and the peaks were stiff but after I refrigerated the cupcakes the frosting seemed to soften a bit so next time I will whip for longer.  Other than that it was perfection.

Wow!  I was out of frosting from the store, so I was looking for a recipe for fluffy frosting online & came across this.  This is the BEST frosting I've ever had-- let alone made from scratch!  I will be using this recipe for the rest of my life!  Comes out sooo fluffy, pure white, easy to dye, looks great, and tastes like marshmallows!  Perfect.

Absolutely Perfect!!!  Fluffy, white, and delicious.  Looks like a marshmallow cloud but tastes even better!  I doubled this recipe to frost a 4 layer Lane cake.  I had plenty with some left over for piping.  The kids licked the beaters and the bowl clean.  The only changes I made were adding a bit of lemon juice to the sugar to keep it from crystallizing and a splash of corn syrup.

It's yummy, easy and makes a lot. I made this without an electric beater - it still works.  
Make sure you let the sugar bubble for 7 minutes.  
People who are giving negative reviews because it tastes like marshmallow/meringue - That is what it's supposed to be like.

I made this frosting today for my cupcakes (1 batch of devils food cake another of almond pound cake) and it was THE PERFECT topping!!  So light and so delicious and not too sweet.  I really don't like sweet pasty icings and this was not like that at all.  And, it was EASY -- I literally had 20 minutes before guests arrived and pulled it together.  I used a glass bowl for my egg whites and vanilla.  And when it was ready I piped it onto my cupcakes using my frosting bag with large tip.  Put a dollop right in the middle of center/top of the cupcake and it kept it's form.  Sprinkled the top with some blue sugar beads and they were beautiful!  Enjoy, you can't go wrong with this icing!  And the shine is stunning!

This frosting made my vanilla cupcakes taste like Twinkies! I made the frosting, divided it in half, added blue food coloring, and pink food coloring. These were so pretty for my Gender Reveal party! One cupcake had the magic color in the middle...blue! It's a boy! Yummy recipe!!

This frosting is amazing :)I did read  all the reviews and comments. I used half vanilla and half almond extract.The only thing I did differently it that I let sugar mixture cool down for about 5 min or so and let the eggs whites get to room temp before i started to beat them. This frosting is wonderful. I would give this frosting 10 stars if I could.Enjoy

The frosting held up and looked exactly as it does in the picture. I'm afraid I just don't like the final product of fluffy frosting though. It's a bit like eating sugary foam: a bunch of air and bubbles, which is great if you like that stuff. I gave it 3-stars because the result of using this recipe makes a frosting that looks good and holds it's shape nicely. But taste-wise, it's bleah.

Okay if this was on taste alone I would have given it 5 stars. Read the reviews and followed the directions. Used the whip on the kitchen aid. The frosting had that glimmer and spread well. It looked so nice I even used it to pipe on some decorations. It was about an hour later the icing began to fall off my cooled cake. If the cake was warm I could see it melting. But it was cool and in the fridge. Thinking back now this frosting is better suited for a 9x13 pan. There is no way all those egg whites were going to hold up.

I used it to frost some cupcakes and firstly, it was flat and didn't taste all that amazing...nevertheless i dunked my cupcakes (no way it would have squirted out like in the picture!) and we refrigerated them...well, when we had them for dinner the frosting had...curdled or something...anyway, it tasted like rotten bananas! no joke! so we scraped it off and ate the cupcakse :p 
Now, i know i'm a bad cook and it was probably just me, but my amazing cook of a brother was looking on and thought i was doing it well...So, needless to say, i won't be making this again.

Love this recipe.  It's easy to make, always comes out light & fluffy, not to sweet.  It taste like marshmellow fluff but lighter.  I will never buy frosting again.  My family likes this frosting much more than the store bought one. Some reviews I read it comes out watery, this is probably from not beating enough, I mix it using kitchen aid on high speed for about 8 minutes.  I would not recommend mixing by hand.

Great Recipe!  I Dipped my cupcakes in chocolate after using this frosting on them.  delicious!!  I was worried about putting my sugar mixture into the egg whites since it was still quite warm/hot - but I did it anyway and it was fine, just keep mixing!!!  I would probably use more flavor in this next time....maybe some almond extract like somone previously mentioned.

This frosting was very easy to make and came out great but.....I just didn't like it.  I prefer a buttercream frosting on cake and this was more like a marshmallow fluff.  I still gave it four stars cause it is a good recipe if you like this kind of frosting.

I just made this for the first time, as a test batch for my daughter's upcoming birthday party...I am testing out the cupcakes, frosting, and how well they hold up after sitting for a bit.  My daughter's party is at a museum, so I have to be able to make these ahead and transfer them without the frosting deflating.  I colored the frosting to a light lavender color using blueberries in the sugar mixture, then removing them before adding to egg white mixture...very pretty.  After frosting the cupcakes I placed them in the fridge to cool, and will leave a few in there overnight to see what they do.  As far as the taste, it's very yummy...I agree with another reviewer that it's kind of reminiscent of marshmallow.  I'll re-post regarding how well it holds its form, etc., but so far I'm really happy with it, and it was really quite simple to make :)  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried using Splenda Sugar Blend and I was surprised how well it turned out.  In step one, the sugar mixture turned clear after boiling.  Step 2, I didn't allow the egg whites to warm up to room temperature which is probably why I had a hard time with whipping to a stiff peak.  I thought I had achieved stiff peaks but after I piped it on the cupcakes it didn't hold its shape.  Also, suggest using larger sprinkle topping - I used the tiny candy balls and they didn't stick very well so those little sweeties rolled every which way around my kitchen.  Hubby loved this frosting so much he decided to save some calories, skipped the cupcuke and had a bowl of frosting - straight....he didn't notice the lack of stiff peaks.  A sure sign this is a keeper!

OMG! This is an incredible frosting!  So easy too. I bake A LOT and this was so fluffy, creamy, light, and dreamy.  I piped 24 cupcakes and sprinkled with tiny red and pink hearts for my daughter to take to high school for a friend's 16th birthday.  Can't thank you enough.  I'm sure I'll use this recipe again, and again, and again...

I had to add confectioner's sugar to create the stiff peaks.  We found it tastes a bit like fluff.

I've had an old, standby recipe that fit any occasion with flair, for a light, fluffy frosting . . . until I lost it.  :tears:  I'm still crying, but this time, they are happy :tears: because I FOUND IT here!  Thank you, Vickie!  This is it, the perfect frosting!  :)  A note:  let the egg whites come to room temperature before whisking them.  You'll be much happier with the peak.  :)

It had a nice consistency, but not much flavor.  I made the mistake of trying to help it by adding vanilla and powdered sugar.  It totally changed the texture and flavor...it was not good.  Better to add more granulated sugar with the water initially than to add powder sugar.

Very good and not too difficult. Would be a GREAT frosting for coconut cake. I made vanilla cupcakes and frosted them with this, and I was told they tasted just like Twinkies (a better, homemade version of course!).

Wow... after reading all of these amazing reviews, I must be culinarily challenged! ;)  I cook and bake a ton, but for some reason, this frosting was very very tricky.  I followed the instructions to a tee seeing as I've tried a recipe like this before and had to dump two tries!  But the first one of this one that I tried, I had to dump.  I increased the speed of the mixer the second time around and it came out fine, but not as "stiff" as I was hoping (like the picture shows).  And not sure if this was a given to everyone else, but I didn't refrigerate it overnight (but I covered it!) and it was soup the next morning.  Bummer.  But when it first came out, I was pleased.  But it certainly wasn't a "frosting," more of a marshmallow cream...which isn't a bad thing, just prepare yourself for that.  :)

I’ve making this recipe since I was a young girl.  Is my favorite type of frosting.  I never use the cream of tartar and it has never been an issue.  Like other reviewers, I always add ½ tsp. of almond extract. I also add a piece of lime peel (aprox ¼) to the sugar/water mix and retrieve it before adding it to the egg whites.  It helps to diminish the eggy taste.

The frosting was perfect for my Devil's Food Cake. And it was so much easier to make than my mom's recipe that requires standing over a double boiler with a hand mixer! I have made this several times now and each time it comes out pretty, shiney and delicious. I took the advice of other posters and added the sugar mixture at the beginning just as I started beating the egg whites and I haven't had any problems with it setting right.

This is definitely a fluffy white frosting - very marshmallow-y, NOT "frosting-like" if that makes sense.  That's not a BAD thing, but the texture was a surprise.  I'm using it on a cupcake recipe which is very dense and rich so the light fluffiness of the marshmallow is ok, but this could seriously use a renaming to Marshmallow Frosting.

I followed the recipe exact, and didn't end up with frosting at all. I ended up with a sugary watery mixture. I left it sit for a bit while I did a few other things around the house, and came back to a hard crust which had formed on top. I broke through it to find a still sugary soup. I will not be trying this again.

eh, so so.  Dried very quickly on the cupcakes, I guess we left them out to long?  They harded up and the frosting cracked all over and wasn't edible anymore.  Maybe my mistake.

This is very fluffy and yummy. I added a couple drops of coconut flavoring which everyone loved. Don't make it too far in advance though or the skin will get tough and sticky to cut. I liked how easy it was, but it looked difficult.

Just like I remember it being!  My mom used to make this all the time but she called it "Seven Minute Frosting" - I love it!  I used almond flavoring instead of vanilla.  I will keep this one around!

You'll surprised how much this recipe makes. Very light and pliable but rather tasteless. Essentially tastes like the merengue you'd put on a pie. I frosted a mini cake with it, covered it and put it in the fridge and though it mostly stayed ok the edges got a little liquidy.

I was searching for a recipe to replicate my mother's boiled frosting as we could not find her recipe until I found this one. 
My sisters loved it and it took us back to our childhood and all the cakes Mom made.One recipe ws more than enough for an angel food cake. I made two recipes to make sure I had enough but it was fun sharing the extras with the family before dinner.

I love this recipe!  I made this frosting to top dark chocolate cupcakes for my daughter's birthday and it was absolutely gorgeous!!  I substituted Meringue Powder for the egg whites since I made them for kids and it worked perfectly (just followed the substitution guidelines on the can of powder).  I've never experienced such pristine white, glossy frosting before without the use of white food coloring.  Definitely a keeper - the kids really liked that it tasted like marshmallow but wasn't sticky.

Great frosting! It's almost just what i was looking for. It tastes like a mix between whipped cream and marshmallow cream. I added some food color to use it for decoration. It's very easy to make and very yummy. ^^ 
i think i would add some other flavoring next time, like almond or chocolate. It's a wonderful basic recipe.

I have been using this frosting recipe for 20 years.  It has always been a favorite in my family.  Make sure to cook the syrup until the sugar is completely dissolved and clear.  I use this recipe on the Deep Dark Chocolate Cake recipe by Hershey that is posted on this site.

I've made this before, but there are some things you need to be aware of.

FIRST: This will not last. It will be great the first day, but will deflate and run by the second day. Only use if you plan to eat it within a few hours.

SECOND: You will be eating raw eggs. I suggest using pasteurized eggs.

THIRD: It is more like a meringue than a frosting.

FOURTH: Everything must be very clean! No oil or it won't whip. Use glass or metal (for some reason plastic messes with whipping egg whites). Also, make sure your eggs are room temperature-cold eggs do not whip as high.

FINALLY: My recipe was exactly like this, except it used only one egg white, a dash of salt, and only 1/4 tsp of vanilla. It was enough to frost a 2 layer cake. It was incredibly whipped and pretty and marshmallowy tasting, but kinda bland.  Maybe more vanilla or almond extract would have been better. I'll update if I try again, but since I don't like it on cakes or cupcakes, I haven't found a good thing to put it on yet....but it has promise!

This recipe has worked great for me on several occasions except for one. That one time I used egg whites from a carton and all I got was a runny mess. USE FRESH EGG WHITES at room temp for best results and make sure your mixing bowl is clean and dry. Any oils will prevent egg whites from fluffing up. Other tips that may help are making sure you don't add the syrup too quickly, a thin steady stream works well. It does taste like the old fashioned seven minute frosting. like a fluffy meringue/marshmallow taste, so that gives you an idea of it's taste. I like using it on dense bittersweet chocolate cake for a good contrast.  It takes color very well. This has become a family favorite.

This is a great recipe, but you must take great care that you do not get even a single drop of egg-yolk or water in the egg-whites. They're the most common reasons that the egg-white fluff won't form stiff peaks.

This recipe was perfect. It certainly is a workout to whip for 15-20 minutes total but WORTH IT! You just have to WHIP it not just plain mix it. So delicious, fluffy, shiny and white. At first it's off-white but it comes out pure in the end. It is very lightweight. It takes a bit like marshmallows. Maybe it needs more vanilla? Also it bulks up--your ingredients seem to triple in volume at least, so this recipe goes a long way. This is my first time making icing ever. Also it blends easily with food coloring and pipes easy onto cookies and cakes. I've made whole rainbows of artwork already and I have a ton of icing left so I'm about to bake a cake. =)

LOVE THIS!!!  I used this to make a friend's birthday cake and it was a HUGE success.  She loves oreos and it was the perfect compliment to the Oreo cookies that decorated the cake.  This is a keeper.
The only thing I wish was in the recipe was a note about, YES, you add the hot, bubbly sugar to the eggs.  I read multiple reviews to try and figure it out with no luck.  I just crossed my fingers and it worked.  And, yes, the sugar needs to boil for 7 minutes.

This recipe saved me when I discovered at the last minute that my mixer beaters hadn't survived a move.  Buttercream was therefore out, but hand-beaten egg whites were perfectly fine for this recipe.  It'll take longer, so make the sugar syrup after the whites are done - stir sugar and water together (per another review, I left out the cream of tartar and instead put a pinch of salt in the whites before beating), then heat without stirring until a candy thermometer reads around 235F.  Pour slowly (against the side of the bowl) into whites while stirring.  Continue to beat until desired consistency is obtained.  Marshmallowy, delicious, and still soft and good a couple days later!

A reviewer commented that this frosting tastes LIKE marshmallows. That's because, it's only one ingredient away from BEING marshmallows. To make marshmallows from this recipe, do this:

Place egg whites in mixer bowl and begin mixing on lowest speed. Sprinkle two packets (1/4 oz each) unflavored, unsweetened, plain gelatin into the egg whites, allow the egg whites and gelatin to continue mixing while you're cooking the syrup. Follow the remainder of the recipe as is. 

To make marshmallow creme, use 1 packet of gelatin instead of 2.

Frosting turned out great.  I think it will take some getting used to, though.  I'm so used to a buttercream frosting and this one is VERY different.  Overall good taste and good consistency.

Used this frosting to top a vanilla bean with lime curd layer cake.  Added a few teaspoons lime juice to the frosting.  It came out light, fluffy and shiny.

Very disappointed.  I only wish I would have read more of the negative reviews before I got excited for fluffy white frosting.  This recipe tasted yucky-- I love vanilla extract, but it was overpowering.  Plus, the frosting never formed stiff peaks, it was fluffy and runny.  I love the Betty Crocker fluffy white frosting mix, but this was nothing in comparison.  I'll have to keep searching for a recipe since they don't sell the mix at our local stores.

I couldn't get it fluffy like in the picture... I seriously beat the frosting for like 15 minutes, my & my boyfriend kept alternating with it. Maybe if we had an electric beater it would have worked. Still tasted good, just quite runny.

if you are using a plastic bowl, or just want to make sure your frosting doesnt go flat, wipe down all your materials with a mixture 3 parts lemon juice, 1 part water. or just straight lemon juice, if you're unsure. make sure to whip whip whip!

Fantastic, sticky and fun! Too sweet for me but my kids loved it. I will be making this again but this time I will put a thinner layer on my cupcakes, and as I did before I will drizzle chocolate over the top. Thank you this is a super frosting.

I just made this to top some fudgey brownie cupcakes and it turned out perfectly. My children were grabbing handsful of the leftover frosting from the bowl while my back was turned, they loved it and thought it tasted like marshmallows (a rare treat for them).  I will definitely come back to this recipe again, thanks!

Doubled the recipe, and had enough for almost 48 cupcakes.   Tastes like marshmallow creme! Had lots of people asking me which brand I used to frost and were surprised when I told them it was homemade    Would probably work best with chocolate, since it really does taste like marshmallow fluff.

This worked like a charm! Perfect frosting for those of us who don't like confectioners sugar. I like to actually taste the cake, not just an overpowering frosting. This was exactly like marshmallows. It complimented the white cake I made perfectly. I love this, and it's my new go-to white frosting.

I'm going to try this again tomorrow. I got in a hurry and did not read through all the reviews, which in return I think I maybe put a tiny bit of Yolk in mine, which it did not set and was very runny. However, it must work out if this many people give it 5 stars! I wish the recipe clarified exactly how long to cook the sugary mixture. Mine was bubbly...but how bubbly did it need to be? Anyways, I will try again and rereview!

PERFECT!!  I was making a German Chocolate cake - however my husband does not like the coconut frosting you're supposed to use so I was here looking for a different frosting to use, I tried this one and it came out perfect!  My husband was licking the remaining frosting from the bowl and was very impressed that it was home made.  It has a very nice flavor too!  Not too sweet, just right!  Thank you for sharing!

Great recipe! Didn't change a thing, and it came out perfect.... I used on top of homemade apple cupcakes- so to add some flavor I took two bags of Twinnings Spiced Apple Chai Tea and added to the hot water while dissolving the sugar. Worked great- frosted the cupcakes then popped in the oven for a few minutes unto the tops got a little got, DELICIOUS!

This recipe tasted like marshmallow cream. It was very light and fluffy. The only problem I had with it was that it wasn't as stiff as I wanted. I used it for cupcakes and it did not look like the picture at all. I'm thinking that maybe next time I use a little more cream of tartar. Overall, I will use this recipe again, maybe just to make and eat right out of the bowl:)

I really love this frosting, i wanted something different to the usual buttercream or cream cheese and this is definitely it!! My mum is very critical when it comes to any food and she absolutely loved it, 6/5 from me!!! btw i also tried it with 1 egg white and came out just as delicious and very glossy!

Reminds me so much of Marshmallow Fluff! Its very very good! 
I highly recommend using an electric mixer to whip at the end, because my arm almost fell of half way through the 7-10min!
Well worth the work!!!

I tried this recipe twice and it was runny both times. I even used 3 egg whites the second time around and whipped it for about 15 minutes. It came out shiny and runny, not like the photo I see. I don't know what I'm doing wrong?

WOW!  I can't believe I've been making this icing for years and never realized it.  I always went a step further and added the butter for an Italian Buttercream.  I love this recipe.  the only changes I made were more of an experiment to see if it would work.  Instead of water I substituted pineapple juice....It creates a wonderful, light, tropical flavor.  Perfect for my coconut cake.

Don't double this recipe!  I did and could not get the stiff peaks, my frosting came out too wet.  Tasty, but sloppy.  I just about burned out my hand mixer trying to get this to fluff, and had to keep adding cream of tartar to get it to stiffen.  Also, I think the sugar syrup needs to  cool a little before adding it.  I will try this again, but only a two-egg batch!

Beautiful looking icing!  Very strong ... holds up well when piped on top of the cupcakes!  The flavor is not my favorite ... like very sweet meringue ... leaves something to be desired.

Was so hoping this would work out b/c I need it for a baby shower.  It was very, very runny.  I followed the recipe, so I am not sure what I did wrong - maybe added the syrup to the egg whites too quickly?  I'm not used to a recipe not working, though, and I'm really disappointed that this one didn't.  
It was really good as a dip for my son's teddy grahams - but definitely would not work as a frosting/icing.

I don't really like the way it tastes. To be fair, I think I messed up the whipping because mine never got totally stiff. But even if it did, I think it tastes weird (and I happen to like marshmallow-y frostings and meringue...)

I have been struggling with icing/frosting for years, I just bought a Kitchen Aid mixer and this icing turned out fantastic!  My kids are thrilled- marshmallow tasting icing!

Great frosting. Tastes like a marshmallow. Very easy to whip up in a KA. I added a little strawberry extract and frosted strawberry cupcakes.

Suggest adding a little more vanilla but perfect frosting, not too sweet.

Turned out fantastic and was really easy using my Kitchenaid mixer.  After drizzling in the syrup, I just let it beat and then piped it on angel food cupcakes.  This frosting held its shape a lot better than I thought it would and my kids say it tastes like marshmallow cream.  Great recipe!

When I came across this frosting recipe I was excited. It looked very easy and had great reviews so I thought I would give it a go. My boyfriend and I were up 2 hours whipping this! And it still didn't work.... It didn't get fluffy, It stayed a liquid. We followed the directions very closely. We are very upset because we had already started the cupcakes thinking this frosting was going to work..

this is a simple and fantastic white frosting.  it is perfect for cupcakes and easy to tint using the colored gel.  it tastes like marshmallow fluff.... but not quite as sweet.  it has a beautiful sheen to it after it has been whipped and is very easy to work with.  if you don't want a crust to form, be sure you keep your cake/cupcakes covered until you are ready to serve.

Followed the recipe exactly. When adding the sugar mixture into the whipped eggs I added it as a fine steady stream into my kitchen aide. It fluffed up beautifully! I will definately make this again!

Mine didn't come out looking at all like the photo posted! I tried to pipe it out of an icing piper but it came out in blobs and not pretty at all. Perhaps I didn't whip long enough. It was far too sweet for my tastes.

Delicious! In case you wondered, you at the sugar syrup while it is still hot to the egg whites.  Mine didn't take 7 minutes to form stiff peaks either.  Make sure you make this right before serving or it will form a bit of a skin.

Love this recipe.  My kids like marshmellow-tasting frosting instead of a butter or cream cheese version so this is great.  It's also so cheap to make and frosts and entire two level cake easily.  Spreads easy too.

This did not work for me. It was not stiff enough. I whipped it for 10 minutes. Being in the refrigerator only made it worse. It is now dripping off the cupcakes. Definitely did not look like the photo! It was kind of pearlescent, which might be good for some recipes, but not for cupcakes.

This icing was so easy to put together!  My girls and I were looking for a simple icing that didn't have shortening in it and tried this one.  It was a little blah, so I added some juice out of a jar of maraschino cherries in the last minute of so of whipping.  Delish!!

Delicious! It is so light and fluffy, incredibly tasty! It is imperative that you beat this icing until it turns shiny which is about 7-9 minutes. It is almost like marshmallows or meringue. I put it on top of ice cream cone cupcakes and it was just perfect for the job. If you want a true white make sure to use clear vanilla.

While I would say that the name is misleading, and that this came out more like a very light fluffy marshmallow consistency than a frosting, this is a very good recipe. You have to be sure to work quickly with it before it sets, but it had just the shine I was looking for, and held it's shape exceptionally well. It also ages rather well, still had the shape I made it in and tasted great a few days later. One word of advice; leave it plain or eat it quickly if you add any decorations on the top, as while it does not crystallize on it's own, it did around the chocolate chips I used on it.

Made this yesterday for the 1st time--so easy--I did use a thermometer and stopped the sugar cooking when it hit 238 degrees---drizzled the sugar syrup slowly into the beated egg whites--it was wonderful--I frosted 28 cupcakes and had frosting left over.I put left over in fridge and used it tonight for Baked Alaska--thanks so much---I did not find it too sweet at all--I might add almond extract if I was doing white cupcakes and coconut--otherwise--just perfect! Thanks so very much!

I didn't care for the flavor, thought it tasted eggy, so I added just a pinch invisible strawberry-kiwi koolaid mix. I did follow all the advice, let the sugar mixure cook to "soft thread" stage and beat the egg white to firmer than soft peaks. I beat it with a hand mixer on high for at least 10 minutes, but it never quite set up. However, the glossy sheen worked on the racecar cake I decorated. Will try again.

Wonderful! This turned out so well and was so easy I had my kids make the second batch I made today. I placed the frosting in a gallon zip lock bag and snipped the corner to decorate our cupcakes. They turned out beautifully! The taste is light and just sweet enough (tastes a lot like marshmallow cream). I usually make frosting with loads of butter and confectioners sugar...not only is this better for the cholesterol it is better on your wallet!

This recipe is super easy to make,  I let the sugar water simmer on low for about 4 minutes to make sure the sugar had dissolved and then transferred the water to a glass measuring cup to make it easier to pour into the beaten egg whites.  You have to spread this on your cake promptly as it starts to set quickly and I think if you wait too long it will be difficult to work with. Fluffy, shiny, not too sweet and looks wonderful. I will make this again. I put it on a vanilla cake but think it would be better on a chocolate cake.

This frosting came out Perfect! I was so impressed! It's bright white, glossy, and holds its shape really well. I realized at the last minute I didn't have any cream of tartar so I followed the suggestion of another review and added a pinch of salt to the egg whites before whipping them. This actually tastes good, isn't too strong, too sweet or anything; it's nice and light!

This is more like whipped cream than frosting.  Very pretty when it turns out.  I had to whip mine for about 15 min before it was stiff enough.  Definitely  not for the impatient baker.  You also need a good heavy duty blender to do the work for you or you will end up giving up before its stiff enough.  Good tip, start whipping it when you start baking your cupcakes and don't sit and watch it.  Just let your mixer do the work

This recipe is the same my mother-in-law uses for her chocolate cake. Same ingredients, but she boils the water and sugar until it reaches soft ball on a candy thermometer. The cream of tartar is whipped with the egg whites. After the sugar and egg mixtures are whipped together, fold in the vanilla. Great frosting...a real classic! Don't give up, it can take a few trys to perfect it...at least it did for me!

This frosting was quick and easy - I only had to whip mine a couple of minutes to get stiff peaks.  It was just the right texture and sweetness, and I love the nutrition info! :-)

This was very good! If you had trouble making this recipe, I believe you didn't cook the sugar until it was completely dissolved. I found this recipe in the 'Better Home & Gardens New Cook Book' pg. 105. It tasted great on a chocolate lover's chocolate cake. YUM!

This icing was beautiful. Everybody loved it...it tastes like the inside of a Tunnocks Tea Cake or Snowball. I’ll definitely make this again.

Looks like I might need to practice a time or two.  I overcooked the sugar mix a tad, but it gave the frosting a toasted (not burnt) marshmallow look and flavor which is every bit as good as if I had done it right.  Sugar mix had just started to get a caramel look to it.

I might reduce the sugar as this is very sweet.  It was lovely over a white cake served with strawberries.

Love it!  Texture of whipped cream - not overly sweet. 
I added a little vanilla bean paste to the egg whites. The best part is that it was so easy! I'll make this again!

This is a great recipe but the downside is that the fluffy icing only lasts one day.  It loses its body and shine in the second day, so do NOT make it ahead of time.  If you have leftovers, it will not look very nice.

Very tasty and I like how glossy it is but it is not firm so is hard to shape (not a big deal for me).  My family loved it!  Used for my Valentine cupcakes (using my go to choc cake recipe from this site - Simple 'N' Delicious Chocolate Cake by J. Miller - YUM!).  I usually use chocolate frosting (from this site too) but wanted white so I can color it.   The recipe as is more than covers a 9x11 cake.  Very easy & it DOES taste like marshmallows!  :o]

Folks, I am not a baker and this frosting turned out perfectly! I followed recommendations to beat the eggs a little before you start your simple sugar and it was easy, peasy. The frosting is not very sweet so I would use it on a cake that was rich/sweet. My husband was so impressed and said it was the exact frosting he had as a child and had wanted for years! I was concerned the frosting wouldn't hold up the next day but it did super.

I have been searching for this recipe for quite some time. Its almost similar to the Seven Minute frosting. As a child, my Mom used to frost most of her cakes with this type of frosting and I often remember the marshmallow-like taste. Which really prefer than the usual buttercream. So for nostalgia's sake, I tried this recipe. It was exactly as I remembered it would taste. And best of all, the kids loved it! Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! I actually used only 1/2cup sugar bcs my chocolate cake is pretty sweet. And it turned out well. Only used half of the frosting for my 9x9inch chocolate cake and it's already looked full! What i did with the extra frosting is, scoop 1full tablespoon of the frosting on lined baking pan with baking paper and bake it on 100'c for about 1hour 20min. What do you get is meringue cookies! Mine is not that cruncy but i ate it anyway as it is soft-marshmallowy. Variation : you can fold in 1tablespoon sifted cocoa powder and have a chocolate meringue cookies! Overall im satisfied!

So impressed with this recipe! I will never buy a container of frosting again. Now that I've tried this, they all taste artificial and grainy. This recipe gave me plenty of perfectly sweet, marshmallow creme-like frosting. It was too much to cover a 9x13 cake - definitely better suited for a layer cake, so I'd recommend cutting it in half for the pan I used. It looked lovely on the cake - bright white, fluffy and glossy. I will be using this recipe in the future.

Unfortunately, I'm not able to hav any dairy in my diet since my breastfed son is sensitive to casein. I had been searching high & low for a good frosting that had no dairy (milk, butter etc). This frosting was PERFECT. I have NEVER loved a frosting like this 1!! So simple, so quick & the texture is devine. Can't wait to start adding extracts to it! I never have cream of tartar on hand so I do an equal substitute of lemon juice & its excellent.

Wonderful! LOVED this recipe! It is not for the novice, since it involves both beaten egg whites and making a hot sugar syrup, but it turns out beautifully! The trick: boil the sugar and water over a medium-low heat just until it clears. Stir well, and only drizzle in a little at a time while you are beating. This is harder than it looks! There were a few times where I poured in a fair bit at once (because my pan is heavy!) and I just beat it in really quickly and tried to mix it with the rest of the bowl. Don't overbeat the egg whites at the beginning. Soft peaks is fine. Then drizzle in the hot sugar syrup WHILE beating. And beat for a little while before adding more. It took me about 7 minutes in total. For people who said it never got stiff - you cannot leave out the cream of tartar! that's key here. Also, this is the kind of frosting you use within a few hours of making it. 

It's so fancy! and I love that there's no fat! we served with sliced strawberries and people loved dipping the strawberries into the icing! I used it for my husband's birthday on strawberry cupcakes and everyone loved it!

If you could give a 1/2 star, I would say 4.5.  Made exactly as printed.  Found the frosting to be a little "soft" - but to be completely fair, it was a rainy day - not the best weather to make this type of icing. Also found it slightly bland...so would either up the vanilla slightly, or do as another suggested and a touch of almond extract.  (Of course, this also means that it is a great base for any flavoring you may want to add!)

This is a pretty, absolutely stark white frosting.  It swirls and mounds beautifully, and if you like sprinkles, no worry about them staying put! I did not find it of a consistency to successfully pipe...and if you added the ingredients to do so, the flavor and texture would change, so be cautious.  It is not as sweet as most frostings, and has much less sugar and fat than buttercream.

 My husband loves it when I use it to frost cupcakes...and then let them sit out uncovered.  The frosting then turns into a hard shelled meringue!

This is not as easy to make as butter cream, but it is a great change, especially on a rich chocolate cake!  Just be patient, be sure to use a timer or thermometer for the sugar syrup, and that your bowls & beaters are truly grease free.  This is one of those recipes where attention to detail matters!

This was an amazing frosting! It was light and fluffy and tasted like marshmallows or divinity. I tried it the first time with powdered sugar and it never whipped, but once I used the correct sugar it came out perfect. It looks really nice when frosted because it is smooth and has a subtle shine. Over all I really, really liked this recipe and will definitively we using it again!

I had already used canned white frosting in between layers of a three layer 9 inch round cake and planned on using some canned strawberry frosting for a pink cake.  I changed my mind immediately after tasting it...yuck!!!  So, not enough butter for buttercream led me to this.  I followed this recipe with the addition of a bit of lemon to the sugar syrup.  Boiled for nearly 7 minutes.  Added a touch of almond and a few drops of coloring.  It did take a while to reform the stiff peaks after adding the syrup.  But they did peak in my stainless steel bowl and Kitchen Aid mixer...VERY well (probably after 7 minutes; but I went ahead and continued for 10 minutes).  The frosting was very stiff and so pretty.  Easy to spread, but I wouldn't wait long)  I am not a talented cake decorator, but I could make this frosting smooth on the top (well...smooth enough for my purposes...not wedding cake smooth) Made enough for the outside and would have probably been enough for in between the layers as well. Lovely little cake. Simple to make. Mine had a tiny bit of tartness (b/c of the lemon I suppose)and was light and not-so-sweet.  I covered and put it in the fridge for tomorrow.

This recipe is truly great.  It tastes kind of marshmallow-y, and is extremely light and fluffy.   I don't even make any changes to it, which is really rare for me!  The only drawback (to any fluffy white or 7-minute frosting) is that it does not last long- it loses its shape- in like a day or two.  So it's best for gatherings when you know it'll get eaten fast.  Beating it really good makes it hold shape a little longer.

Awesome Frosting!! It was so easy to make. I thought it would be a PITA, but it so wasn't.  I didn't have any issues. I added two dashes of salt and a bit of almond extract as well. I can't believe how these ingredients can make so much frosting. I frosted a 9x13 cake about 1/2 thick with frosting (or maybe more) and still had about two cups left over. I tried to make meringues like someone else did, but I've never made them before. The frosting wasn't too sweet, just perfect. Even the next day in a not air tight container, it was still light and fluffy.
I beat the heck out of the egg whites first with my kitchenaid mixer on high. then I beat the heck out of the frosting while adding the sugar mixture.  I am not experienced with whipping egg whites, never made this before. i think maybe the people who had problems didn't beat the egg whites long enough before adding the sugar/water mixture, and maybe they didn't boil the sugar/water long enough. Other similar recipes have indicated the sugar/water needs to be at soft ball stage. not sure what that means, but I let it boil for a while the egg whites were whipping. I didn't pour it very slow, nor very fast.

This frosting was pretty good. It tasted like marshmallows and was a big hit. It's a little sticky and wasn't as thick as I'd like but will make it again.

This frosting is good and would presumably be a fan favorite of anyone who prefers something which isn't too sweet or buttery. I'm one of the few who enjoys gritty, shortening-based frostings (call me crazy!), but I thought I'd try this for a change. The frosting is a brilliant pearlescent white. It is lacking flavor so I suggest doubling the vanilla or playing with other extracts. As many reviewers mentioned it tasting similar to a meringue or marshmallow, I don't quite agree. Yes, it smells like fluff, but the taste and texture are different. I definitely would consider using this in the future just because of how unique it is!

I thought this was delicious..  It had a glossy, fluffy looking finish, like marshmellow fluff, and tasted like marshmellow too.  I would recommend using a stand mixer, my arm got tired mixing for 10 minutes.  It was easy to spread, but I did have more of a difficult time decorating ontop of the frosting.  But it was a nice change from the usual thick icings used on decorating cakes.

It was tasty.. but not what I expected. It was pretty sweet for my taste, reminded me of marshmallow cream. And after being refrigerated it became somewhat hard and very sticky. Good for kids... since its sweet.

i made this such a long time ago i don't remember if this would work with the Viva method (using a viva paper towel to smooth the icing on a cake?  i am not a big "icing" fan, but need something that forms some what of a "crust" to be able to use this method.  PLEASE HELP!!

This is the best frosting ever!! Made it last week for my cupcakes and making it again later for my cake! I will admit, it does take much longer to get "peaks" than it says...... but, worth the tired arm!!  I especially like that it's not that sweet, just right.

I'd give this more of a 4.5 stars, actually. You see, although this frosting was fluffy, delicious, and easy to make, the egg whites started to separate after a while. Overall, very nice!

I liked the taste of this frosting. It WAS very light tasting. And VERY fluffy. (perfect title) I kept some white and colored some with food coloring. The only thing I had real difficulty with was getting it to the right consistancy. I was never able to get the stiff peaks. I stood over the bowl mixing for what seemed like forever and it just never turned out like I expected.

Not as good as I'd hoped.  I realize I may have been looking for more of a whipped cream type of frosting, though.  This, in my opinion, was a little too complicated for the end result, which was lacking flavor and a creamy texture.  Pretty, yes.  Delicious, not quite.

This was very quick and easy to make! It does taste just like Marshmallow. Very light and fluffy,not too sweet. I made adjustments for more frosting and it still came out perfect! I used it for a chocolate mocha cake. I was even able to decorate it using sprinkles and icing writing.

This is a great frosting, exactly what comes to mind when I think of a cake from my childhood  :)   It turned out to be pretty easy (using a stand mixer), and looked beautiful on chocolate cupcakes.  I added 1/4 tsp almond extract to the recipe; maybe next time I will substitute fresh (1) lemon juice for the vanilla extract -goes great with a white cake-, just like my mom used to, thanks!

taste is OK - whipped for about 20 minutes (hand mixer, don't own a stand) and only got soft peaks. Recipe could be a bit clearer - like do you cool the sugar mixture before adding to the egg whites? I used egg whites from the carton, not from an egg...don't know if this would affect the outcome. Probably won't make again due to the effort and so-so results.

alright... a little sweeter then I had anticipated. Makes a ton! Glad I listened to reviews and didn't double the recipe for my cake.

i did not pick a batter recipe that went well with marshmallow. next time i will know better but the recipe is great as is. only make what you need as it will not keep for more than a day or so in the fridge before it separates.

Great recipe!  I used this to frost my 10 year old brothers birthday cake today.  I used red food coloring and raspberry extract in it and it was delicious.  It made a lot of frosting, theres a whole bunch left over:)

This was just what I was looking for-- an easy, fluffy, not-too-sweet frosting for cupcakes. I did add a 1/2 tsp of almond extract after reading reviews. I brought it to my child's classroom and it was a hit.  My son said everyone thought it tasted like whip cream marshmallow.  It did get a little melty after being left at room temperature for a couple of hours, but nothing too bad.

This is seriously, the most delicious frosting. Not sure I would even call it frosting; it is more marshmallow-like in texture and heaven in taste. I was looking for something light for my lemon ricotta cake. I added a tsp. of lemon extract to the sugar mixture and a few drops of yellow food coloring ... beautiful and delicious!

I love this frosting!  I have been making Seven Minute Frosting for years, but this is much easier and just as good.  No more standing over boiling water with a hand mixer for 7 minutes!  I just heat the sugar mixture in a saucepan and slowly pour it in my KitchenAid with the whipped egg whites.  Simple and wonderful!

I just used this for my two year old's birthday party. It was the first time making frosting so I was a bit nervous. It came off without a hitch and it looked wonderful I loved the shine I also tinted it different colors and it was bright and cheery. Everyone liked the way it tasted and received multiple comments. Me on a personal note would like for it to have more of a flavor next time I think I will try some different extracts.

WOW!  This was wonderful!  I made it exactly as written, and it turned out fantastic.  It went perfectly with my lemon cake (which, I might add, wasn't anything special - just a mix).  It fluffed up so beautifully, and held it's shape without needing to be refrigerated.  Thank you for posting!

I just made this frosting..and..it doesn't taste very good. My 5 & 7 yr. olds would not even finish one bite. I loved making it, and it is so fluffy & white, but the taste is really disappointing. I think we are so used to canned frosting (very sugary), so this is tasteless compared to that. Darn. Be prepared, it makes a lot, but the taste may surprise you. Sorry.

I liked this recipe for its simplicity.  It used ingredients I had on hand and was easy to throw together.  Overall, it was ok, but it was more marshamallow-y, which wasn't what I was looking for this time.  I did use raspberry extract in place of the vanilla to complement the cupcakes I was frosting.

Super frosting!  After reading all of the reviews that said the frosting didn't fluff up, I actually think I may have overbeaten it a little bit.  However, it was still wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't encounter any problems at all.  Perfect compliment to a dark chocolate cake!

I made Valentine cupcakes and wanted a nice fluffy, white frosting that would hold its shape when piped.  This was awesome!!  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly!  Loved the marshmallowy taste.  I frosted 35 cupcakes with one batch of frosting.

A friend requested white cupcakes for a baby shower, and my usual cream cheese frosting seemed to be a poor match. So I tried three different recipes from this site. This one was the winner! Light, fluffy, and gorgeous when piped on. The only downside was that it was sticky, so after the cupcakes were frosted, even the slightest bump resulted in a blemish to the frosting. Still, the cupcakes were a smash hit. I will definitely use this recipe again!

Amazing frosting - you can't go wrong.  It comes out perfect everytime and it spreads so easily.  It is so fluffy and pretty.  I even froze left over frosting, and used it 4 months later.  It saved beautifully, it was as if I just made it.  A little goes a long ways too.  I frosted 16 cupcakes and a cake with just one batch.  I didn't skimp either.

I tried this recipe once, and my frosting simply refused to form stiff peaks. I beat it for over 40 minutes (using a hand mixer). This is probably my fault--I must have poured in the sugar mixture too quickly. This recipe is fairly delicate...it's pretty (even if it wasn't stiff, but I don't know if it is worth the effort! Also, a very sweet frosting. I'm going to give it a try again. Will update if my results work out any better! UPDATE: Yeah, still didn't work out for me. I made sure to add the sugar mixture very slowly, made sure it boiled and was fully dissolved, and still I get nothing. I did add a dash of salt to the mixture, just to balance all of that sugar.

I always rely on the ratings before making a recipie, but I don't understand the high marks for this one.  It was easy, fluffy and shiny but not tasty.  If you like uncooked merrange, this is the recipie for you.

This is the frosting I was looking for!  My son can't have dairy or soy, so I have been searching for a frosting for his birthday cake.  This recipe is easy to follow and comes out great.  It holds up for a few days if you keep the frosting covered but I would suggest serving it right away for best results.  It doesn't take long so I will be making this and decorating his cake right before it is served.  For the test I filled and frosted a two-layer chocolate cake and it was great.  This frosting tastes like marshmallows but is very light in texture.  I used the extra to dip Annie's Bunny Grahams in and think I will use it as a whoopie pie filling!  It is a great recipe that will be a dessert standard in my house.

Thank you so much for this recipe! It was fantastic.  I searched for this frosting in a box that my mom used to make and couldn't find it.  This recipe tasted exactly the same.  It brought back childhood memories and it was really a snap to make.  I haven't been this excited about frosting ever!!!

This icing is absolutely delicious!  Although I'm not sure if it will go very well with the white cake I made, it does taste good.

When this recipe works, it's lovely. When it doesn't, it's difficult & finicky. One key is to make sure that the milk mixture is completely cool, as in room temp or cooler. You also need to make sure that the milk/flour is completely lump free otherwise you'll have little lumps in the frosting. You might want to strain the milk/flour mixture as you're adding it to the butter/sugar. My first batch looked a little curdled, but I just whipped the heck out of it with my Kitchenaid & it did come together. I did not have any grainy-ness issues with the sugar. It was completely dissolved. GREAT flavor! I would also use clear vanilla for a super-white frosting as a previous reviewer mentioned.

I love this recipe. I've made it before, but when I made it today, I didn't whip it as much as I should have so it didn't come out as stiff as I usually like. Awesome recipe though! My kids LOVE it!!!

This icing was really good.  It seems like every white icing recipe on here calls for lbs of butter or shortening.  I added the almond extract and it did taste great with these chocolate cupcakes I made.  It makes way more than 12 servings.  I used less than half to frost 20 cupcakes.  In case anyone is wondering, adding the really hot syrup to the mixture cooks the egg whites (thus making them fluffier), so you're not at all eating raw eggs/whites.

Beautiful snow white frosting with great texture!  It has such a lovely sheen, it's almost pearlescent.  I used meringue powder (pasteurized, dried egg whites, found where the Wilton cake supplies are in the craft section of Wal-Mart), and it worked like MAGIC! (No worries about salmonella, which you might have if you used regular egg whites.) I added 4 T. of  water to 4 tsp. meringue powder, then beat it just like I would regular egg whites.  After adding the syrup, it took exactly 7 minutes of mixing to get it firm enough. I piped it onto my cupcakes using a #21 star tip. Be sure to clean the tip every so often to keep the lines looking sharp.  You wouldn't think just two little egg whites would make so much, but I iced (thickly) 52 cupcakes with a single batch and had a teeny bit left over.  The taste is similar to marshmallow creme, but less sweet.  Great recipe!

I tried this for my husband and I. I did not like the texture or the taste but my husband did. You have to like marshmallow texture w/ little or no sweet taste. Would not recommend for little ones.

Wonderful recipe! Light and fluffy! I used it for a snow themed cake for the preschool. I substituted with powdered egg white to be safe. It looked so beautiful on my cake and tasted very sweet but not overly sweet. I added almond extract, it gave it a very nice flavor. I also added a hint of orange extract to give it a little something extra. It is a very easy recipe. I had no problems with it. I imagine you could add any number of extracts for variations of flavor.

I am a bit domestically challenged and I don't do much baking, but this recipe was sooo easy and tastes so good. I went exactly by the recipe and used the heck out of my kitchenaid mixer and ended up with an awesome light and fluffy frosting that I will be using over and over again. I got so many compliments on it, my kids even liked it. They couldn't get enough. Thanks!

I followed the directions and mine didn't turn out very fluffy, I'm guessing I should have beaten it more or perhaps my beater was powerful enough.. oh well but it still tasted great!  Will try again soon!

Great light frosting. I added 1/4 tsp almond and 1/2 tsp butter flavoring.  It went great on my cupcakes.  Very fluffy, stiff consistency.  When frosting the cupcakes, I just dollopped it on and let it be...like a messy fluffy smooshy mess that I'm gonna love eating :)

This frosting was easy to make (sugar mixture did go clear! no grey frosting either)...up until the whipping to stiff peaks. I'm sure it would've been easier had I had the right tools though. I gave up too early because the frosting was still a little runny when I was frosting the cake. I'm thinking I still had "soft peaks" (newbie to cooking/baking here). I had a bit of frosting left over which I kept whipping just to see what would happen and it got a lot thicker. The cake still turned out quite nicely and I love how there's no fat and not too many calories, compared to those processed icing you get in stores. I like how light and fluffy it is and it's not too sweet either!

Love this recipe!  Awesome on chocolate cake. I used the same principles as when making meringue and I didn't have any problems with getting this to whip up. I really like that it's not as heavy and sugary as buttercream icing.  A nice change.  Thanks!

Light, sweet, frothy and near perfection!  I added one extra egg white because the eggs I was using were a little small and added slightly more vanilla than asked for.  I used this to frost a chocolate layer cake and it was so good!

Worked perfect. Nice alternative to the confectioner frosting. I will definitely use this frosting again but probably with chocolate cake or with raspberry or lemon flavor.
Thanks

This frosting was not too 'sugary'and extremely smooth. I had a number of people ask for the recipe, so you know it is good. I didnt' have the timing right, but would make sure to mix the eggs before doing the sugar mixture.

I believe I followed this recipe exact and the frosting never whipped up light. It was like marshmellow fluff and tasted like it to! I still used it to frost the cupcakes by dipping the cupcakes in it but couldn't have used it to frost a cake. Too runny. Don't know what I did wrong but it still tasted OK.

Just made this frosting. I love it.  I only have a hand mixer, so I was afraid my arm would fall off from mixing for 7 minutes.  But I held up. It was easy. I will definitely make this again.

The key here, to make a stable/thick frosting is to bring the sugar syrup to a high boil, and hold it there for two minutes. This frosting is a candy frosting that mimics the actual candy known as "Divinity" or "Sea Foam."

I didn’t make this recipe exactly, because I well am on the young side (13) and make a mug cookie and had whites left, I knew that you could make “frosting” so I whipped it (it’s 12:45 so I used my hands (a wisk)) up and didn’t know what to do after, looked it up, put sugar in a little bit of salt and vanilla and blue food dye (one drop) and it tastes so good, this is how I found out to use the sugar so thanks ????

This was my first time making a cooked frosting so I was really nervous. I skipped the cream of tartar because I didn’t have any. The recipe was easy and tasted like marshmallow fluff.

I made this exactly as written. It took forever to get thick, but after 35 minutes, it finally developed not-too stiff peaks. I wanted to use it for Whoopie Pies, but it was too thin. So I frosted a banana nut cake with it, and it was perfect. I don’t think it’s meant to be stiff. My mom used to make it all the time and it was like creamy marshmallow fluff! The flavor is fantastic. I thought it would be sickening sweet but it’s just right!

I make this all the time. It's a good, quick, light frosting for something you intend to serve right away. It doesn't stand or refrigerate very well.

Quick, easy, light, and fluffy. And most of all not overly sweet.

Made a birthday cake for Jesus for our family Christmas Supper and everyone loved it. One older gentleman who is a great family friend, took one bite and to hear him as he said he could tell it was homemade from the first bite and hadn't had homemade cake since he was "home" (a boy) had to be the highlight of my night! Such a sweet moment! Made with vanilla pudding between layers and this cake: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7703/heavenly-white-cake/?clickId=right%20rail0&internalSource=rr_feed_recipe_sb&referringId=15265%20referringContentType%3Drecipe

I remember this from my childhood.  My mother made a cooked frosting for cakes.  This tastes just like.  Not too sweet with an almost light marshmallow texture.  Much lighter than buttercream  You really need a stand mixer for this as it takes at least 10 minutes of beating to get it to a good frosting consistency.  Everyone loved this icing!  I will be making it for all may cakes.

I have made this frosting several times, turns out great every time.  forgot to mention that I do use some powdered sugar at the end to make it a little stiffer, ( just a little at a time to get the thickness that I want)




























It is very close to the old fashion frosting we use to make for angle food birthday cake. that you used a double boiler  to make.

This is so good! It is bland so I added mint extract, it was so much better. It is like a marshmallow creme, so it's a nice change from regular frosting. I would definitely make it again.

Reminiscent of marshmallow fluff! Quick and easy with a stand mixer,  and tasted great on chocolate cake. It does stay soft and fluffy and does not harden.

It does get fluffy but it needs something more. It isn't that sweet which is what I was hoping for. Would recommend for someone who is looking for a non sweet tasting frosting.

it was good but pretty much a meringue right? My youngest thought it was too marshmellowy lol but the rest of us liked it. It's a big batch too which was lucky for us cuz during cooking my bowl broke and 1/2 the mixture was lost, but i still whipped up the remainder, and had plenty for our cupcakes.

I made this to put on some Ding Dong cupcakes.  Didn't want anything too sweet, and this was perfect!  It reminds me of a cooked frosting my mom used to make when I was a kid that was for "company" cakes.  I followed the directions exactly.  I think the biggest thing is to make sure you pour the sugar syrup in slowly.  I stopped my mixer a couple of times to scrape down the sides where some of the sugar had splashed.  After the egg whites were at soft peak and I started adding the syrup, it took about ten minutes total to get a nice, fluffy frosting.  It turned out great!  I'd definitely going to use this recipe again as a not so sweet option on a rich cake.

This is my go-to recipe for all my cakes and cupcakes and even for a filling when I make my surprise cupcakes. If you don't have cream of tartar don't worry as it will still make. Also use just regular pancake syrup if you don't have the clear kind and it will work just as well. If this doesn't  whip up correctly your egg whites were too cold or you got some yolks in it.

It was a good recipe and fun to make, but it tasted kind of empty/airy, I'm pretty sure that was just a human error and I over whipped it though.  I'll have to try it again and see if it turns out better.

OMG!  I want to take a bath in this stuff.  I have always used canned frosting because I thought making it would be too hard, but I got it done while the cake was baking.  I realized I didn't have any vanilla frosting the night before my daughter's birthday & used this recipe.  From now on, this will be my go to for vanilla frosting.

This was a childhood favorite of mine and I'm SOOOO glad I found a recipe.  It tastes just like I remembered.  Be careful to follow directions exactly.  This one is a little time consuming, but totally worth it!  Best served on chocolate cake.

Despite the photo, it doesn't work very well with cupcakes.  I'd recommend a sheet cake, layerd or Bunny Cake at Easter.

I just got done making this.  I was scouring the Internet looking for a frosting that tasted like marshmallows,  was more on the whipped cream side because I'm not a fan of thick frosting,  and I needed it to pipe well.  I found it all in this recipe!  Love, love, love it! It's just sweet enough that you can taste it and still taste the cake. Added this to my favorites and will definitely use this as my "go-to"  frosting in the future.  Super yummy!

At last minute I decided to make icing for daughter's surprise 13 bday cupcakes, and actually started to get nervous after reading all the reviews.  And I'm confident in kitchen but all this about threads and how long to boil and room temp or not...yikes.  My icing came out fine...if anything maybe a little TOO stiff.  

Here's what I did:  grabbed cold eggs out of frig and beat just whites with vanilla extract, as directed.  Standup mixer got them to stiff peak stage in no time.  I had added a little bit of almond extract, which I think tastes good but might not have been necessary.  Turned off mixer and went to stove. Used smaller pot that had pour spout at lip.  Medium pot seemed to big for the quantities.  Got water, sugar, cream of tartar gently boiling while stirring often.  Once gently boiling, set timer for 7min.  Glanced at my egg whites and they had deflated and I panicked!  So when about 1min left for sugar syrup, I turned mixer back on low to remix.  Egg whites got to soft peak stage in that minute; left it running.  Was  nervous but I took small pot of hot sugar water mixture and slowly poured thin thread of hot mixture along edge of egg whites while mixer was going.  Probably took 2 minutes to pour all of it in slowly.  At that point reset timer for about 5-6min and let  it continue mixing.  Had to turn up speed as frosting thickened.  Was glossy, THICK, and spread nicely.  I could not just dip my cooled cupcakes into frosting, as others did.  Mine too thick.  A

Don't know what I did wrong, but it sure didn't turn out white. Used the ingredients as called for, but did not work. On second try, you have to make sure the sugar is like a thick syrup. That will do the trick. Don't just boil it and think its done, you have to really cook on med to med low for at least 10 minutes to make the sugar turn out right.  Also your egg/vanilla extract mixture must be really bubbly. And you really have to add the sugar mixture really slow blending it in over a minutes time.

Amazingly easy! I was hesitant to make this from the negative reviews. It turned out beautiful. And I did it with a broken mixer. I have never made a frosting before. And hate the store bought ones. I will never buy one again! This is my go to frosting recipe! The only difference I made was adding roughly 1/8 c of powered sugar. I'm not sure if it helped any. But it's definatly perfect. And son aproved (for his birthday cake today)!

The recipe works if you do it right!!!
Cream of Tartar goes into egg whites, NOT syrup.
Syrup of sugar and water boils to soft ball stage 242 degrees on thermometer.

It was EASY - the cream of TarTar helps so don't miss this ingredient!  I whipped the eggs to a soft peak FIRST and then added the mixture and then whipped to a firm peak - Reminds me of whipped cream frosting and actually frosted 24 cupcakes - I didn't have an icing piper, so I spooned it into a baggie and cut the corner from the bottom - Whalla!!! It was THAT easy! I added the sprinkles, and they look like I bought them from the store! LOL

I love frosting like this, and  have made it a couple times before. I just want to say that for first timers this recipe can be slightly misleading.
You have to cook the water mixture down for around 10 minutes and get it in a slightly syrupy state. If you don't, and you add it in too early, your eggs won't combine properly and will stay foamy instead of turning like marshmallow fluff.

Exactly what I wanted. White fluffy frosting that isn't super sweet/rich like buttercream. Holds up well at room temperature or in fridge. Loved it, an old school classic!

EASY PEASY! Turned out great! Lovely flavor, nice hold on piped cupcakes, and easy to make. It does taste a bit like marshmallow creme. It is a light frosting, not heavy like buttercream or cream cheese so it is a good compliment to a sweet or heavy cake.

This recipe is actually better than I thought it would be! I was kinda scared when I was whipping the sugar mixture and the egg mixture together. I wasn't sure that it would create any peaks. 
But patience is the key! While I was letting the Kitchenaid whip the frosting together, I started the cupcakes. This recipe went perfectly with the cupcakes, especially since they were chocolate very nice recipe

This was just what I wanted, used on a lemon cake filled with lemon curd. I whipped the whites while cooking the sugar then drizzled it in slooooowly. Set up perfectly and wasn't too much for the clean, bright lemon that a buttercream would have been. Simple and effective.

This took a little longer than the recipe, but I wanted a firmer frosting. I also used a pinch more cream of tartar (for texture) and vanilla (because we love vanilla). It holds up and looks beautiful. Thank you for sharing! SO MUCH EASIER THAN 7MIN FROSTING!

My first time making this was a disaster because I had little patience so I had to throw it all out, I was making a birthday cake and I wanted everything made from scratch, the second time I tried it, it came out perfect. I absolutely love this recipe and I already recommended it to some of my friends. My husband and his family loved it, I will definitely be using this again sometime.

Best frosting, hands down!  Everyone loves it, even those that normally hate the sweetness of frosting devour it!!  You must cover tightly though when storing or it does become meringue-like.

I tried this for whoopie cakes made with sugar cookies for my sons class at preschool. I wanted something sweet but mild flavored that the kids would like. I dont know if I did something wrong, but my icing ended up having this rancid lemon taste behind it. It was the consistency of whipped cream right after making it, and I was afraid it would be too light to hold up to the weight of being sandwiched to cookies. I could have let it chill overnight and see how it thickened up, but since it had the weird lemon flavor (btw that is the cream of tartar because i tasted that with my finger to see where i went wrong) I decided to whip in 1 cup of powdered sugar. That masked the lemon taste and made it significantly thicker, but the flavor just wasn't that good. It does taste pretty true to a "marshmallow icing" but I feel like it just has no real taste...maybe I could add more sugar? I just don't think I will make this again. It might be just preference, but either something was wrong with my cream of tartar or this recipe would have been inedible for me without the added powdered sugar.

This frosting is so good, soft, and fluffy! It tastes like marshmallows.

I wanted enough to frost 24 cupcakes. This recipe has 12 servings, so I wanted to at least double it. I ended up tripling it to make sure I had enough, and that was a big mistake! I had so much frosting, that it was at the top of my mixing bowl! I was taking some of it out to be able to whip the rest. It was a big mess. I'm assuming it was because I had such a full bowl that I couldn't get stiff peaks. I whipped and whipped that sucker, but I never got more than soft peaks. After about 20 minutes of beating, I worried the egg whites would separate, so I just called it good. The frosting was still delicious and held its shape somewhat.

Standard recipe for Italian meringue aka marshmallow frosting. The sugar-water mixture should be at soft ball stage or just below before you add it to the egg whites. You don't need cream of tartar unless you're planning to frost your creations days ahead of time (cream of tartar increases stability).

I absolutely love this recipe. I was looking for a quick and easy frosting recipe and I sure found it! It's the perfect consistency and you can color it any color you want with just a little food coloring. It had a wonderful flavor too!

I was in a hurry to find a simple icing recipe since someone ate all the icing I had purchased for my cake. This one was simple and I had all but the cream of tartar. I saw the review by Miss Niecy and used her salt method and it turned out perfect! Thanks!

The flavor is definitely more muted if you love love love the store bought ultra sweet. The word marshmallow definitely defines this taste and flavor. Like another user said not sure if the kids will love it (probably b/c they are used to store bought ultra sweet) but if I can ween them onto this flavor/recipe I would be happy. My rating is we'll see at lunch tomorrow! Very easy to make!

Light and fluffy!  Perfect for an angel food cake and now you have a delicious low fat dessert :). Be sure to use large bowl for mixing as it really fluffs up.

I was making a coconut cake for Easter and I went back and forth between a butter cream and a fluffy white.  I found several recipes for fluffy white and one actually called for 1 1/2 Cups of sugar!!!
This has 1 Cup and it was perfect.

I love this frosting and it's the only frosting my husband will eat. My tip to those having problems is to add the sugar syrup slowly and be sure you have a mixer that can do a good job whipping. I whip my syrup right into the unbeaten egg whites. Today for Easter I added blue and red food coloring gently swirling with a skewer leaving the colors swirled then frosted cupcakes. We called them tie-dyed cupcakes they were fun and beautiful.

I made this yesterday... it was FABULOUS!!! A majority of the 7 minute frosting recipes had you cook the eggs, causing the eggs to literally be FRIED! I wil make this a lot more!!I made a coconut cake and used this for the frosting.. everyone loved it. Will also be using this for my butter cakes, chocolate cakes, etc. Thanks a  bunch, Vickie!

love this frosting. Its not stiff, and is very marshmallowy. I would not put it on a cake that was not going to be eaten within a couple of days because it gets very sticky.  We made a five layer rainbow cake and it was just perfect. My three year old and my MIL both liked it equally well. Definitely a keeper. I I like it more than the powdered sugar butter alternatives but I would have a hard time decorating with it. Would be lovely for cupcakes.

Lovely taste and texture.  Not too sweet. I made this with a recipe on this site called Apple White Cake. The kids could taste the egg a little, but weren't too concerned about it, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

I made this recipe exactly as written. Like other reviewers have noted, it's not very sweet but does have just enough to know it's still frosting. It fluffs up into nice stiff peaks and looks beautiful. I left mine at room temperature for about an hour while waiting for the cake to cool completely & it still went on well.  It didn't work very well as a filler between the 2 layers of my round cake because it compressed a bit & oozed out the sides.  Overall it was a nice complement to my chocolate cake.

easy and delicious!!  Not overly sweet, so you can enjoy the cake flavor.  I used it with the cola cake recipe...which was also easy.  My 2.5 yr old helped me w/everything and has been trying to sneak the cupcakes and eat all the frosting.  Though..like other reviews I changed it up some.  I put 3 egg whites  and a bit more tartar and sugar.  I also used almond extract.  Great recipe everyone!!

This was exactly what I was looking for in a frosting. I'm glad I found this. It's easy to work with and has a beautiful shine to it. I made my son's 2 yr. birthday cake with it. It looks fabulous!!

Marshmallowy, fluffy goodness. Will add a bit more vanilla next time. I loved that it wasn't as sweet as a typical cake frosting.

OMG!  So good!  I frosted 24 cupcakes and still had some frosting left, but maybe I was just too stingy.  I almost made myself sick, eating that extra frosting.  This was wonderful, light and sweet!

VERY fluffy. I found that it called for way more sugar than was necessary--I would cut it down to at most 3/4 cup, maybe less. I used half vanilla and half almond extract, but I would have been happier with all vanilla plus 1/4 tsp lemon zest. Also, this frosting does not keep well. Use it all up at once!

This is a great recipe!  However, I live in France and it is almost impossible to find cream of tartar so I used a whipped cream fixative and the frosting turned out lovely.  Super yummy!  It has a marshmallow frosting taste.  I am so thankful to all recipes for this!

Quick and easy frosting that whips up in no time.  Tasty--not overly sweet--and versatile since you can change up the flavor with your choice of extracts.

This is a great frosting, but I only gave it three stars because I haven't decided if it is worth the work.  It takes a while to make.  I put in almond extract as someone suggested and it was good.  Be careful not to put to much. Just a little will do it. It really is a beautiful frosting though.

I have been using this recipe for years with great results. I actually did cakes to order at home and this was my go to frosting during those days. The only thing I did differently was to put the cream of tartar in the egg whites when beating and after mixing in the sugar syrup then added the vanilla essence.

This was great!  Easy and yummy all at the same time.  Takes a while to whip together but so worth it.  I used my stand mixer but I had to carefuly lift the bowl so that the wet mix whipped up as well.  After that I just let it go.  Best not to mix at the highest speed.  Mix on a medium high speed for best results.

This frosting is so beautiful!  It forms lovely soft peaks and has a lovely pearlescent finish.  I added a touch of almond extract and it was just to die for!  Perfect tackiness for decorating.  Thank you for this great addition to allrecipes.com!

This is a delicious fluffy icing recipe!  I have been searching for a recipe like this to pair with a simple white cupcake recipe I like to make - something not to sweet and dense and this is exactly what I have been looking for!  Overall very simple to make - have patience and whip for the full 10 minutes and you will have beautiful icing!

Outcome of this recipe is very pretty. A great resemblance of silk. Not too fond of the taste, since I'm not a "mashmallow lover". Whatever you yield the recipe to, you'll still have a lot of frosting left over, especially if you're making cupcakes.

This frosting reminds me of a kind my mom would make when I was a kid.  I thought I'd never find it again.  Thanks for the recipe!  Not only was it super easy to make, but it tastes great!  My kids loved it on cupcakes.

This was very easy to make. The frosting looks really pretty and was easy to use and color. I'm not crazy about the taste though. I guess I'm just a buttercream person. This frosting tastes a little sticky and is not very flavorful. It worked out well for the Valentine cupcakes I made for my son's class.

I have been looking for a new frosting recipe and this is it!!  It is wonderful.  Not too sweet.  Just right.  Didn't melt or get gooey when I left my cupcakes at room temperature.  I used 1 tsp of almond extract instead of vanilla.

This frosting is everything it claims to be.  I was surprised at how inexpensive and easy it was to make.  I used this on a layer cake, and it was thick enough to do the trick.  Lovely!

I'm embarrassed to say I did it wrong the first time. It came out something like a pinata glue. LOL-- I read the directions wrong and kept cooking it while beating --   I tried again and wholla it came out nice and white.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have been making this recipe for over 23 years..this is the frosting I have always used for my daughters birthday cake..it is a tradition.  My mother's favorite cake was always lemon cake with a white frosting and covered in coconut...this frosting works perfectly for it.  Kids like it because it's fluffy and tastes like marshmallow.  it can be flavored by exchanging the vanilla for any other extract, it colors well for different occasions, but looks beautiful in pure white.  Very elegant, or plain, this is the best.

I like to add grand marnier instaid of vanilla for an elegant and delicous twist.

The prettiest frosting I have ever made, this was pure white, shiny, and smooth.  I will definitely use it again but I plan to experiment with using coffee or brown sugar to give it a bit more flavor.

This recipe is so much easier to make than the meringue frosting over a double broiler.  I made this for cupcakes and received lots of positive comments. It was super easy and quick.  I highly recommend this recipe, esp. if you are looking for a buttercream alternative.

Used this to frost cupcakes for Easter dessert.  I added lemon extract instead of vanilla.  Almost had to make more as so much got eaten ahead of time!  I did have to  mix it a lot longer than stated. OMG - Unbelievable how good this is!!!  I will never use another.

Very easy to make! I didnt have cream of tarter so i used salt instead as suggested by another user. Tastes more like marshmallows and not as much like frosting like i'd hoped.

Delish!  "Oops, I got frosting on my finger" was definitely not a bad thing when I was decorating!!  I had no problems with consistency - when the chef says to beat for 7-10 minutes, she's not joking.  Topped ice cream cone cupcakes with the frosting and worked/looked/tasted great.  Thanks!

Very easy frosting, and very yummy. I actually used 1tsp orange extract and yellow food coloring, and it was perfect for my Marine Corps cake. I just hope tomorrow when I serve it, it looks just as pretty as it does today

This recipe rocked!  I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the egg whites and frosted red velvet cupcakes with it...amazingly good and easy!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
It's been 2 weeks since I left this and I made it again...this time with 1 T (in adddition to the vanilla) of Kahlua and lots of cinnamon.  Wonderful!  Make sure you whip it long enough...that's the key!

Amazingly light and smooth; very fluffy and marshmallow-y. Took longer than ten minutes to mix, and was extremely sticky. Was rather sickly sweet. Other than that, had an okay flavor, and took to color excellently.

This frosting is great with angel food cake.  I used to buy it from a box mix but have had trouble finding it in the stores.

I was quite disappointed with this recipe although, to be fair, it was due probably in large part to the enormous expectations I had of it after reading its reviews. 

However, if you can get past the light but distinct smell of egg on your cupcakes, go for it.

This frosting never stiffened up for us.  We whipped it for a long time and it stayed at the consistency of yogurt.  The flavor also wasn't pleasing to us.  I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

I'm only giving this 2 stars b/c it was nice and fluffy. Otherwise is was a bear to mess with, stuck to Everything and tasted like someone melted marshmallows and added some vanilla.

The flavor wasn't the greatest, but it did have the taste and consistency of marshmallow fluff. It was fluffy, held its shape well, glossy, white, and everyone liked it. I topped chocolate cake and then decorated with fresh berries. It was very pretty!

Was not really fluffy. Adding almond extract along with the vanilla helped the flavor. I probably wouldn't make it again.

Amazing... like eating a cloud. Pretty easy to make too, just be patient with the eggs. :)
 
made with Heavenly White Cake----- both very light and puffy, go extremely well together!

This is an easy, smooth and bright icing that I have gotten so many compliments on. Its not to sweet and remindes me of a whip cream marshmallow frosting. I love it!

Really good. It tastes a little unsweet and overly gooey at first but in a minute or two after it sets it's amazing! Great on sugar cookies!

I do not own a mixer, so I thought I would whip it by hand - BAD idea!  It did not turn out fluffy at all no matter how hard I whisked.  Next time I'll be sure to borrow a mixer before trying this!
P.s. I added orange zest to the sugar syrup, which gave it a nice zing.

This frosting is soooooo GOOD!
I  made cupcakes and used this frosting for my little girl's 4th birthday and brought them to school and they were a hit.  The frosting is so light and fluffy.  I will make it again for sure!!

Great recipe I loved how it just stayed fluffed up.  I thought it was going to harden after reading reviews, but it's still nice and fluffy it tastes really good not too sweet.
