No apple cider, so I used orange juice. I doubled the sauce(because once I made the first batch, it didn't seem like there was enough)and added two tbsp. of cornstarch to the orange juice before I added it to the sauce. I did add two tbsp. of spicy brown mustard to give it a little sweet and sour twang to it. I browned the chops in butter, layered them in a metal baking dish and spooned the sauce over the top. Not too sweet, plenty of flavor. There were NO leftovers and I used six large chops. There was just enough sauce for the chops and for my husband to spoon some on his rice. I served this with an oniony brown rice and steamed broccoli. Nice well-rounded dinner. I'd make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was very quick, easy and wonderfully different. Even my picky kids liked this!(For some reason, they don't usually care for the taste of pork chops & I've tried several recipes.)Definitely a keeper!

Very good and super quick, easy and inexpensive!  I did sprinkly the chops liberally with salt, pepper and onion powder before cooking, then followed the recipe as written.  The only thing I would suggest is letting them rest a few minutes before serving.  Will definitely make again!  Went GREAT with homemeade sausage, apple, golden raisin stuffing...  Nice alternative to the same old pork chops and applesauce!

Really good!  I baked them instead of pan cooking them, but I followed the recipe exactly. The hubster suggested adding a little more cranberry next time.

I also sustituted orange juice for the concentrate. In the end, I added about a teaspoon of cornstarch to the sauce for thickening. The house smelled wonderful and the chops did not disappoint!

Very good flavor!  Definitely double the sauce to adequately accompany the chops. I found it a bit too sweet, so next time I will reduce the honey.  Most cranberry sauces have added sugars so I don't think you need to add more.  The nutmeg and ginger could be increased for a more complex flavor.

Very very good, flavorful and does not come out too dry which is a common problem with pork chops. Made as is except for I used regular orange juice instead of concentrate because it was what I had on hand. Great new way to have pork instead of the usual apples, bbq sauce or teriyaki

This was a quick, easy and yummy recipe.  My husband and son (11) thought it tasted great.  My daughter who is 8, said it was a little spicy for her.  Next time I make it I will leave the pepper off of her pork chop.  Everyone agreed it is definitely a do over recipe.

This was surprisingly good. I omitted the cranberry, used fresh nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, 2 Cups of apple cider, a little OJ and a little sweet vermouth. I had some onions left over from another meal that were sauteed with cider vinegar so I added those as well. I browned the chops then poured the sauce in the pan and braised for 1-1/2 hours. Very tender with a light apple flavor. Served over rice.

Read the recipe carefully, as I didn't, so I went through more steps than necessary.  The pork chops were a little dry but we put the remaining cranberry sauce on top.

This came out really good!  So quick and easy to make. The pork chops were moist and really tasty, you could definitely  taste the individual flavors of the orange, cranberry and apple cider.  I had a very picky eater who tried pork chops for the first time and loved them!  I will definitely make these again!

I followed the directions and just doubled the sauces so that I could have some for gravy. It was just to sweet and tangy for me. My boyfriend enjoyed it.

It was really good. Although I used a whole can of cranberry sauce and added a little ground cinnamon, but left the other ingredients intact. Also used apple juice instead of apple cider. Turned out great, but it could use a little more kick. Next time I will add some red pepper flakes or something.

I'm not a big fan of meat/fruit combos, but I quite enjoyed this. Like others,  I used orange juice instead of concentrate. Chops came out tender and succulent. Nice change from the usual boring baked pork chops with mushrooms gravy. Two year old  daughter loved it too! Thanks!

I am not a pork chop fan, so I wanted to try something different and came across this recipe.  I had all the ingredients on hand except the frozen orange juice concentrate. So I substituted pineapple juice, which was ok, but I think using the orange juice concentrate would have been better.  My family all loved this, including myself.  The chops were not dry either.  It was even better the next day.  I did double the apple and pineapple juice, because I like extra sauce.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this for my family, and we all loved it! I changed the recipe a bit, adding some brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon, because we like sweet things. We also used bone-in pork chops, rather than boneless. It was the perfect amount of sauce, but I could easily double it for extra, which my mom asked me for. I served it with a side of mixed buttered squash and a carrot sweet potato casserole. All of the flavours blended wonderfully, and it really welcomed my favourite season. Everyone gave it a 5-star review, and I added a photo of it as well. Thank you SO much for this amazing recipe! It's a new favourite!

This meal was alright.  It was not fantastic by any means. The glaze was almost overpowering for this cut of meat.  Made exactly as the recipe described, the glaze is almost all you can taste.  Wasn't horrible, but probably won't make again.

Good recipe. Cooked pork chops in light olive oil to keep from sticking to pan with salt and pepper.   The cranberry sauce prepared differently. Combined 1 cup orange juice, 1 cup of cranberry juice 1/2 tsp nutmeg, -1/2 tsp ginger and two tbsp honey and mix well.   In a frying pan add 1 cup of dried cranberries over medium  heat, pour 1/2 of the orange and cranberry mixture over dried cranberries and cook down then pour remaining mixture over cranberries until it turn from liquidity to a sauce.   Serve over pork chops or on the side. Went great with hot edamame.

Sauce was wonderful! I doubled it like others suggested. Will make again. Used eight 1/2 inch thick bone-in pork chops seasoned with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder. Browned 2 mins on each side, covered with sauce and simmered covered till done. Plain orange juice works fine in place of the orange juice concentrate, as well as a substitute for the apple juice if you don't have any. A little pinch of cayenne pepper works fine too if you don't have ground ginger.  Gives it the same "warmth" that ground ginger would anyway.  I also added a big tbsp of dijon mustard like another reviewer.  Seemed like a perfect match with pork. I removed the chops and thickened the sauce at the end with a couple tbsp of cornstarch dissolved in another 1/4 cup of cold orange juice.  We loved it.

Decent pork chop recipe.  Like most others, I used orange juice (Simply Orange) instead of concentrate.  I also took another reader's suggestion and added 2 tsp dijon mustard.  My issue is I make my own cranberry sauce and find canned somewhat tasteless.  Being it's a week before Thanksgiving, I had 2 bags of fresh cranberries in the 'fridge.  Took out a large handful, covered with orange juice and put on medium heat until they popped.  Mashed into a puree and added a little honey.  When added to the already made sauce, it really brings out a depth of flavor and cuts the sweetness.  Recipe is good as written but if you happen to have fresh cranberries, it's worth a try.

I couldn,t stop eating it! I used really thick bone in chops and simmered about 15 minutes in the apple cider. I did sprinkle with salt, pepper, and onion powder before browning. My 3 yr old cleaned her plate as well!

These chops were delicious! I had to make a couple of sustitutions only ecause I didn't have the ingredients but still a keeper. Husband and daughter both asked for more. I didn't have craberry sauce, but I did have diet cranberry juice and craisins so I had to kind of make my own cranberry sauce and Ididn't have the orange juice o I just poured a little of the apple cider cooking juice back into the cranberry mixture. I served the chops with mac n cheese and green beans. I will be making this one again.
