I was so excited to make this soup! Our family loves Pho. After working hard for 2 hours and following the recipe exactly, I was SO disappointed. It was way too spicy for Pho, for anything really. We love spicy Mexican meals, but Pho should be much more mild. Our lips were burning so much, we had drain the broth, rinse the noodles and eat it that way. I wanted so much to love it, sorry.

Good,light and fragrant soup. I would only add a teaspoon of cayenne next time  A tablespoon is too much.

This broth was out of this world! I just followed the broth recipe and then threw in brown rice and lentils. I will use this broth base/spice combo repeatedly!

This was good. Instead of pho I spiralised zucchini and sweet potato for noodles, and used habanero instead of jalapeno.  I also reduced the amount of chicken and increased the amount of leek/onion. Very hearty and warming soup, thanks!

This is one of the yummiest soups we've ever had. We only added a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper as we don't like that much heat. It is at the top of my soup catalog now. You should try this recipe...

Delicious but 1tbsp of cayenne is too much. I didn’t add the jalapeño. Next time I will either leave out the cayenne or just do 1/8 tsp. Delicious!!!!!

It is incredible... However, 1 tablespoon of Cayenne pepper is WAY too much. Also, I made it twice. I had to throw out the first batch because no one in the house could eat it and we are hardcore spice/Indian/Thai/Mexican food lovers. I left the Jalapeno out as well and served it on the side ala traditional Pho. Second time was a charm! I also served lime slices and fresh basil on the side along with the Jalapeno. The fresh Ginger was amazing and would scare off any cold it encounters.

Good, but yes spicy. I put only 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Next time I’ll only put  half jalapeño. Smells delicious and clears the sinuses. Not sure I’ll make it again as it is time consuming.

Made it in my instant pot and used less cayenne pepper as suggested by other reviewers. Used a Thai style curry chicken broth. Added fresh cilantro and did not use jalapeños. So flavorful and good if you have a cold. Husband even loved it!

I love making Pho soups and anything with ginger root. I think the key to any Pho soup is the stock. I made my own chicken stock.

It was good, but really spicy even though I halved the recipe and used less than half the spices.  I used only about 1/2 of the called-for cayenne.

I wasn't getting there with the powdered curry even though I added way more than the recipe called for so I added a half a can of thai red curry paste. I had some chicken on hand so I threw that in there along with a stick of lemongrass finely chopped. I also added some portobello mushroom I had on hand. I think if I make it again, I will omit the sesame oil as it just made the soup have a greasy film.

Really good.  Hubby likes it too.
Only changes:   Didn't have any curry powder.  I used 1 tsp instead of 1 tbs of Cayenne and I didn't have any green onion, but I had fresh cilantro, so I sprinkled that on top when it was all done.   Yummy. !

I agree with the other reviewers. This soup is super spicy! Way to hot, it burns my lips and my tongue. It’s a lot of work and there  was no way my kids would go near it. My husband liked it but I’ll never make it again.

I made this soup minus the chicken, minus the jalapeño, and with lemon juice. It has a good flavor but I agreed with some of the other reviews: Too much cayenne. I’m glad I didn’t add the jalapeño.

I liked it a lot.. it has just a bit of a kick to it, but not too spicy. I had some problems with the app, though, for the shopping list, it told me to buy 6 red onions and ½ jalapeño instead of 6 limes and 1 jalapeño.

A little time consuming and I think the broth was worth it. It was delish. Very spicy but we can handle it.  In my opinion, there could have been more noodles.  I almost couldn't find the noodles in the supermarket, googled it and spaghetti or linguine would be a good sub. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing!

Overall, we enjoyed the pho - after I added more broth, ginger and curry to balance the heat. A Tbs of cayenne is too much if you don't enjoy really spicy food! Tonight I added some coconut milk to it ... hopefully that will help as well since it's still amazingly spicy. Also added mushrooms, beansprouts and beans ... :)

I really had fun making this soup. I was really worried about adding a tablespoon of cayenne, but I made the recipe as written, and in the end it was just perfectly spicy. Plenty of heat, but not so much that you couldn't taste everything else in the soup. I will definitely make this again, because it really was very good. I won't use lime juice next time, though. The lime got on top of some of the other flavors, and frankly I think it didn't add enough positive to the flavor profile to keep it. I'd much rather taste the delicious combo of spices and veggies.

I really liked it, nice on a cold day.I did not have the Jalapeño or a leak, no biggie the flavors were very nice. I am going to make it again with the missed items and I am sure it's going to be just as good.
