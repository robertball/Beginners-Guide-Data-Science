Ok...does anyone know what a mornay is? My family really liked this dish, and I liked that it was so easy to make. I did double the pasta and add some salt, pepper, garlic powder and red pepper. My four year old said it was "amazing" and already asked when I'm going to make it again. Oh, instead of breadcrumbs, I topped it with french fried onions. Yummy.

pretty standard recipe, but what is with the ridiculously small amount of pasta, which equates to serving less than one person. u would need at least 3 cups to serve 6 people!

I was looking for ideas to make something with what I had on hand.  This was a great fit, with some minor tweaking.. I used 1 3/4 cans of evaporated milk to make it creamier, added half of a brick of cream cheese (approx 4oz), salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper and garlic powder.  I didn't have rotini so I used a box of linguini (boiled just to underdone,so that it would not get overcooked in the oven)---peas, corn.  I toasted Panko breadcrumbs and topped it.  It turned out really tasty.  Pretty good for a 'nothing to make' kind of day.
Thanks for the idea.

I increased the pasta to around 2 cups, and added 1/3 c. minced onion, 1 c. frozen diced carrots, and 1 t. Old Bay seasoning to the recipe. Also used evaporated milk instead of whole milk & 10 oz. of sharp cheddar. Everybody loved it. It was the first casserole to run out at our church pot-luck supper.

A hit with everyone. I used about 2 cups of uncooked pasta, but didn't change anything else in the recipe.

I'm thinking that the pasta should be 1/2lb, as that is the amount of macaroni I used and it was just right.  Sauteed a small onion and clove of garlic in an additional tablespoon of butter, and added some thyme, rosemary, and black pepper to the sauce.  Used frozen mixed veggies in place of just peas and corn, and seasoned the breadcrumbs with some oregano and basil.  Delicious!

I'm not sure why the recipe only calls for 1/2 cup uncooked pasta. That wouldn't be enough to feed two people. I put in a box of rotini but kept everything else the same. I omitted the peas and corn since my son wouldn't eat it with them included. Everyone really liked this. It reminded me of Tuna Helper but better. I put crushed potato chips on top to add flavor. Very good. Had enough leftover for lunch the next day.

Mor·nay    (môr-n) KEY 
ADJECTIVE:
Being or served with a white sauce flavored with grated cheese and seasonings.

This is a great "in need of a grocery shop" meal! Had everything onhand and took the advice of those that've rated as far as the spices and amounts of pasta & cheese go. A bit of a change from the typical "tuna casserole".

I appreciated how similar this was to a classic tuna casserole, but without using canned cream soups.  As someone mentioned previously, I topped mine with french fried onions because I had some on hand.  For our taste, we needed a little bit of garlic salt sprinkled on each serving at the table.

I thought this recipe was good.  Did use 1/2 lb of pasta like someone recommended.  Used some half n half  to add more liquid to the mixture before baking so it wouldn't dry out.

This was absolutely delicious and I'm not even a fan of tuna out of the can. I did add more pasta than the recipe called for however- the servings went fast! Next time I'll make more! Fantastic recipe!

This was a great meatless recipe that was easy to make. I sauted onions and garlic prior to adding the flour to the saucepan. I also used about a half a box of bowtie pasta. Omitted the corn and added a can of peas. Tasted delicious

Good recipe.  I halved it for my husband and I.  Used more pasta as well. Can't fathom the amt in the recipe, how that would be enough!  Used a bit less bread crumbs and added a dash or two of curry powder.  This is similar to another recipe I make.

I made this with canned salmon (not a tuna fan) and I loved it.  My bf even said it was great, and he's a tuna, not a salmon fan.  Next time I make this, I may try changing the pasta to linguine, and double the sauce as per some suggestions, but I think this recipe is great the way it is too.

Definitely use more pasta, and I also used more milk/cheese.  Basically this is macaroni & cheese with tuna, but everyone liked it so I'll be making it again.  Fast & easy.

This recipe puts anything I've made from a box to shame! Everyone went gah-gah over the home made sauce and crispy topping.  Also great leftovers for lunch later in the week.

This was great.  I never liked tuna when I was a kid and then one day had a craving for it.  I did find though that it helped to double the amount of the sauce, and I only used half the peas.

I was looking for a quick and easy meal and had very little in my kitchen cupboards, so this fitted beautifully. I doubled the pasta and the sauce, added paprika, garlic powder and chopped fresh parsley. I think I should have tripled the sauce as I found it a bit dry. Hubby on the other hand loved it which is why it gets a 4. Thankyou.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  We put a lot of extra cheese in it and over it - but that was just personal preference.  Our 18 mth old hated it - we think it might be the texture which she hasn't had before - or it could just be typical toddler behaviour!!  5-star recipe, also easy to double or triple to make extra for freezing for those nights when you're too busy or too tired to cook. My husband says "It's Yum"

Had to double the amount of pasta. Found it lacked flavour. Suggest adding any spice to liven it up. Otherwise, it was an 'ok' meal for my son and I.

This is a very good recipe and I will most likely make it again! The reason that I have given it four stars is because the recipe calls for too much cheese. It was a little too cheesy. Next time I make it, I think I will put 1 cup of cheese instead of 2 cups, but if you're a cheese loving person, then by all means, put 2 cups or as much as you like. :) Other than that, this is a great recipe!

I made a non-baked version - heated up the rue, poured in the milk (plus a cup) and stirred till thick. I also substituted about half Velveeta and half cheddar, put this over rice once cooked and it was a family winner!

Easy, fast, and freezes well. I usually skip the breadcrumbs and add Herbs de Provence.

Better than using cream soups in my opinion, and not that much harder to make.  I googled mornay - it's a french culinary term meaning a cheese sauce made using a flour and butter base.

This is a good base recipe, but needs a little doctoring up.  Here is what I did - - Used double the flour, milk, and butter.  Used 3/4 box of elbow macaroni. Added 2 cups shredded chedder in sauce, and 2 tbsp of spicy queso cheese dip. Added 1 can of corn and 2 cans of tuna. Sprinkled in black pepper.  Used a 9 X 13 pan, topped with another cup of chedder cheese and topped with crumbled tortilla chips. Needed some salt and additional pepper, but with that addition, not too bad at all. Maybe add some garlic to it next time too.

Well, this wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't great. It is my understanding that a mornay is a creamy cheese sauce... and this was not creamy at all. My main complaint is that this was so dry! Next time I think I would skip the flour and maybe add a little more milk. With the cheese in there, I think it would be plenty creamy and not runny, even without the flour. It was quick and easy though, so thank you!

This is good, if not a true Mornay sauce. A Mornay sauce is a Béchamel sauce with shredded or grated cheese added. Usually, it is half Gruyère and half Parmesan, though some variations use different combinations of Gruyère, Emmental cheese, or white cheddar.  It is often served with seafood or vegetables.

Very good spin on the classic tuna casserole!  I hate peas and feel like I need to eat them every now and then - I followed the recipe exactly and couldn't taste them and everything was delicious.  Thanks!

ok, made this last night with mixed reviews.  and i did change it up a bit to make it a healthier meal. used chicken instead of tuna, also about 1/2 cup of diced ham from a left over ham steak, DH isn't a big tuna fan, used skim milk,[plus part of a can of ff evaporated i had in the fridge 1 large bag of ff shredded cheese plus 4 slices of reg full fat cheese, the shredded was mild cheddar the full fat was montery, skipped the butter part and just mixed flour w/ a bit of the milk to thicken the cheese sauce, skipped the corn, added portabello mushrooms i had sauteed in a bit of butter and garlic, diced onions and red pepper, (along with the peas) added salt, pepper, garlic poweder and still this recipe did not have alot of flavor.  oh increased the pasta to 8 oz vs half a cup. made enough to feed 6. i personally liked it, low fat comfort food but DH did not, he said not a whole lot of flavor which i had to agree with, i will make it again but i think the lack of umph if you will was the cheese i used, not that it was ff but it was mild cheddar and monteray jack, think the next time i will use a sharp ff cheddar and maybe some low fat swiss. any how i still gave it a 4 because i thought it was good even though it didn't pop my taste buds. oh also mine ended up being like 367 cal per serving and 8 grams of fat 4 of which were saturated.

Oh my gosh!  I threw the old Tuna noodle casserole recipe away.  We did not want to stop eating this!  It's amazing just like it is. I used one cup of heavy cream and 1/2 cup of milk and left out the veggies.  Loved it!

I make mine the same way but alway different because of what i have in the frig. allway a faverate

I have read the other review and question put forward.

Mornay is basicly a white sauce with cheese, i like to make mine with three different cheses.

In this recipe the tuna could be replaced with salmon or chicken(BBQ chicken is what i have used in the past add a little hole-grain and dejon mastard)

This recipe is flavorless.  I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain ones thinking it might give it some flavor and it didn't much at all.  This meal is edible, but very boring.  I won't make it again.

I made the recipe as is and thought it was a good basic start, but it did need some kick, so I added half a block of cream cheese and some Tony's creole seasoning.  that did it!  I will go back to this recipe to make again.
I did saute onions and celery with the butter at the start, but that was just an effort to cram as many veggies in as possible.

My husband and I enjoyed this casserole.  We used half a box of angel hair pasta instead of rotini.  Be sure to season the sauce with salt and pepper, it will need it!  I also used 2 TB of butter for the sauce.  The breadcrumbs also needed to be tossed with some melted butter.

Both my partner and I gave this 5 stars, even though we both are not big fans of tuna. This was super yummy! I did add 1 tsp thyme and 1/4 tsp black pepper as I was worried it was going to be bland, and I used fettucine noodles as that is what I had, but still used the tuna, cheese sauce, peas and corn, and it was so good. I will definately be making this again.

Some cooking sauce info: Roux is equal parts flour cooked in melted butter. Roux plus milk makes a Bachamel sauce. Add cheese to Bachamel and it becomes a Mornay sauce.  I added a little mustard powder, paprika and a hint of garlic to spice this up a bit.  I also used 2 cups of wide egg noodles for the pasta.  I also used frozen mixed veggies (you know, the carrots, corn, peas, and beans mix.) Was a nice and hearty meal that's pretty easy to make.
