I am going to give this a full 5 stars because I love the texture of this scone. It is light and moist for a scone. The taste is so nice but I did use fresh cooked pumpkin and added cinnamon,  ground ginger and a bit of pumpkin pie spice. I would  definitely make again!

This did not have the consistency of a scone. It was more like a regular, moist bread. Scones should be crumbly. I made it exactly as the recipe instructed, but I added spices. It would have been very bland without them. We will finish eating them with honey on them, but I will not make them again.

These are delicious, light layers within the crumb with just the right amount of sweetness.  I used pumpkin seeds (pepitas) instead of pine nuts.  I did not add any extra spices but that would be good as well.

I made these yesterday for a large gathering.  They were the first things gone.  I also added cinnamon & nutmeg to the batter and topped with a simple glaze of powdered sugar, cinnamon, milk and a splash of maple syrup.  Oh I left out the pinenuts simply because I didn't have any on hand.

This was a very good scone recipe and I will use it again in the future. I did add spices (cinnamon and nutmeg) and 1 tsp. of vanilla to the batter. I also eliminated the pine nuts and substituted them for chocolate chips. Yum! I'm not sure what the scones would taste like without the cinnamon and nutmeg. I frosted these with homemade cream cheese frosting and drizzled them with melted chocolate. My family loved them and they want me to make them again. For me, that means a recipe was a success :-)

I made this today for a work function.  They came out great and were eaten right up. I made a few minor changes. I used 1% milk instead of buttermilk, instead of 1/3 cup pine nuts I used aprox. 2 1/2 Tablespoons chopped walnuts and 2 1/2 Tablespoons chopped milk chocolate chips, I cut them into 24 smaller pieces, and I did not use the egg wash on top.

I've never made scones but this was clean out the cabinets week for me and I found a can of pumpkin I wanted to use up.I watched the video twice because I don't usually bake.I didn't have pine nuts so used walnuts and browned them just a tad to bring out flavor.I made it as written not trying to make it something it wasn't other then the nuts.I used the maple glaze.Surprisingly I made a delicious scone.I wish I had this for the Holidays but will be a keeper for next season.

I really liked the texture of this scone. I have to say that I added a little bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and would have added ginger if I had any. I also have to admit that I didn't read the directions all the way through and threw in the egg with the wet ingredients. That meant I added a little more flour when 'folding' it. This was the closest to a 'Stbx' scone that I have found! Maple glaze = YUM!

I love all of Chef John's recipes, I swear.
These are seriously yummy. Not too sweet, soft, moist, a little bit of crisp !!! So good.

I made these using roasted butternut squash, and instead of buttermilk I used 1/2 cream and 1/2 keffir.

I also changed the glaze because my icing sugar was off. I used a bit of cream, brown sugar, maple syrup, and pumpkin pie spice. I heated it in a saucepan just to let the sugar dissolve, and it tastes delicious on the scones.

Thank you for your recipe :-)

I used half AP flour and half whole wheat pastry flour; added pumpkin pie spice and a splash of vanilla. Didn't have pine nuts or pepitas (which I prefer over pine nuts), so added dried cranberries instead. I did use the egg wash and sprinkled the scones with turbinado sugar; after they were baked, I drizzled a tiny bit of maple syrup over them. Lovely! Will definitely make these again!

These were very moist, but the pine nuts ruined it for everyone in the family.  I will make these again, but use walnuts instead.  A more classic taste ...

As always, Chef John's recipes are delicious.  I've made these scones many ways, most recently with orange zest, nutmeg and pecans.  You can't go wrong with his recipes!

Delicious! I made them today! It was easy and I did with regular icing all over and then a drizzle of some icing mixed with cinnamon, to add some flavor! I also did it without any nuts! Well, everyone LOVED THEM!! Thanks! Here's my photo, the one with the purple border!

These were just OK for me.  I thought the pine nuts didn't really meld well with the pumpkin.  I did a heavy glaze because I thought they needed a little extra flavor, and I wasn't in awe of the texture.  Maybe had I baked them a little longer (I did 17 minutes) they would have had a crunchier bite to them.

this recipe is amazing. I used half wheat flour, half all purpose. I used vanilla greek yogurt instead of buttermilk. I added a dash of vanilla and some cinnamon.  I didn't use any nuts.
I was worried after reading the review about the consistency because I hate when scones turn out like muffin textured. I think the wheat flour helped that! Turned out PERFECT!

I have made these countless times. Due to allergies, at home I substitute almond milk and vinegar for the buttermilk and have substituted other oils for the butter with good results. Whether I make these as they are written or with substitutes, I have never had them last more than one day and have had request after request for the recipe!

Great recipe.  Very simple.  I changed a couple of things and wow.  I used what I had and used eggnog instead of milk and added almonds.  The smell of the dough was insane.   Very flaky and thick.   Again, Great recipe.

Rave reviews from the family. I didn't have pine nuts but used salted caramel chips instead. I also didn't do the egg wash with sugar. No complaints here and no one missed it.

I have made this recipe 3 times now and it's actually pretty brilliant. Even if you mess up the flaky scone part and let the butter melt, you still get a pretty yummy quick bread because of the buttermilk and the pumpkin. I've gotten the best results by freezing the butter ahead of time and grating it. I put it back in the freezer a couple times to keep the butter from melting. I also followed others on this site and added nutmeg, allspice, cloves, cinnamon to taste. I served these for Christmas with clotted cream and local apple butter and everyone went back for seconds AND thirds!

Absolutely awesome!  I too added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger.  Great texture and taste.  Baked a full 18 mn in convection oven.

I just made these but I did make the following changes:
- Used coconut oil instead of butter (4-5 tbsp)
- Added another 1\2 cup of pumpkin (I love pumpkin)
- Used heavy cream instead of buttermilk
- Used cranberries instead of nuts (great!)
- I didn't have confection sugar so I melted 80% cocoa bar for a drizzle 

These are full of flavor and i think texture is more like a scone because I used coconut oil and not as much as recipe called for.  
Note: I placed some on middle rack and some on top rack. The lower rack burned a bit on the bottom, but the top rack was perfect! I Suggest using a top rack.

I usually love Chef John's recipes and swear by his pavlova. For some reason, this was a failure. The scones were too soft and muffin-like and the flavor was bland. Even the vanilla glaze I added could not wake them up.

Followed to a T, not too familiar with scones but this was more of a biscuit type. The dough was really wet so I added maybe another 1/2 cup of flour just to be able to "fold" it. It does need cinn/nutmeg/ginger, etc; not much flavor. Will not make again :/

Excellent!  Followed base directions omitting pine nuts, instead added candied ginger & pumpkin pie spice.  Next day microwaved a few seconds and still delicious!

Followed this recipe and the “pat/fold 3X” technic shown on the video and these scones are the best!!  I forgot the nuts and they’re not missed!   My husband and I tested them straight from the oven and decided, why mess with the best by using maple glaze...so we’re eating them as is.
Thank you Chef John for a terrific fall treat!

Made this twice. First time I thought I misread the flour and shorted a 1/4 cup. Really wet. Almost unworkable. Finally got enough flower in to fold and cut. Second time I know I started with the amount recommended, but still really wet and added a lot of flour while working it just to be able to fold and cut. Next time I will start with 2 cups of flour just to save time. About the pine nuts....who keeps pine nut on hand? No one likes them anyway. Just skip them....or use whatever you have. The glaze taste good. Would recommend doubling the sugar to get a more substantial glaze. As directed it so thin as it soaks in to the biscuit...so not really a glaze...oh think i will just go with the whole stick of butter next time as well...yum!

Mine came out tough.  Maybe because I turned it too often?  I would try again but not turn it.  This recipe makes very small triangles ...I would not cut it into as many pieces so the portion size is like what you buy in cafes.

Pumpkin scones came out great and was not hard to make. I added pumpkin pie spice. Topped with lemon glaze instead of maple because that’s what I had. Delish and filled the house with warm pumpkin aroma. Will definitely make again soon.

This recipe definitely needs some type of help with either pumpkin spice or ? The texture was good but there was no flavor. I pretty much tasted flour. I will make these again and add some pumpkin spice so it will at least have more flavor. I followed the recipe exactly how it is written,

I was surprised that the recipe didn't as for any of the usual pumpkin recipe spices so I added Allspice (and chocolate chips) to the second batch and it turned out that these were pretty good additions.  The first batch was good but I think the add-in's gave it way more flavour and a bit of chocolate never hurts!

I made the recipe but forgot to add ginger, but I was thrilled with how moist and tasty these scones are! Thanks to Starbucks for not having their version available in several stores near me this week. I will never buy them from Sbux again! These were easy to make and SO good. I wouldn't change a thing. Some reviewers made 1/2 of the icing, but I really like the icing sweetness so I made the whole recipe and thought it was the perfect amount of icing.

A few things.... 1) don’t skip the egg wash. It adds great texture 2) I like my scones a little sweeter so next time I will either add sugar or make icing instead of just sprinkling sugar on top 3) they weren’t very “pumpkiny” despite me adding 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I’ll be adding more of that as well.

Very nice recipe. Scones are really easy to make and very light in texture, which I like a lot. Didn't use pine nuts and they are still delicious. Will be eating them with jam instead of glaze. Thank you for sharing.

I immediately made a second batch. Put the unbaked scones  in the freezer. Pull out the frozen scones the night before and bake in the morning for a quick treat. I added pumpkin spices into the glaze. Rather than the folding in step 4, I simply kneaded the dough in the bowl 3 or 4 times then pressed the dough on floured surface.

It was good. Super easy and had a great texture and consistency. I personally thought they were a little bland but I also didn’t add in any spices. Will make again but with some spices.

I was so excited to find this recipe and I had almost all of the ingredients on hand, except for buttermilk and pine nuts. So a quick substitution using sour cream and chocolate chips instead turned out a new favorite scone recipe.

I have made scones from other recipes, but I've always been rather disappointed. This recipe is amazing. I followed the recipe exactly with one exception: I did not have the pine nuts the recipe called for and I did not replace with any other type of nuts. The instructions were very clear and I followed them to the letter. Perfect pumpkin scones! We ate them with honey butter (made with honey from our own bees). Delicious! I have made them twice and will definitely make many more times.

Great recipe!  Typically I make the recipe as is the first time with no changes.  However, I was making this for a crowd of people that do not like pine nuts.  So I omitted nuts all together and I did add cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger.  It was delicious and I will make it again!

I loved the texture of these, very light  and fluffy and just the right amount of sugar. What I didn't like is that they taste nothing like pumpkin. They were supper easy to make. I'm going to add more pumpkin and some spices next time.

I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg, but in place of the pine nuts I added some sultanas andomitted the glaze. I feel that they would have been a little bland without the added spices and fruit. They turned out really nice, the family polished them off in quick time cutting in half and  spreading them with some butter. Being an "Ozzie" these are a good second to "Flo's Pumpkin Scones" being the wife (now deceased) of one of our Premiers  (also deceased now). Just being a little "patriotic".

This is a wonderful recipe for scones! Especially, if you're making it for the first time. I recommend doubling up the recipe of the maple sugar glaze for a sweeter taste.

With a few added spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, & vanilla) these taste great despite the non-scone texture. The batter was a bit sticky so I ended up making round scones with my second half of dough (sticky triangles with the first half). Bake time was 17 minutes for me.

The recipe was super easy to follow, and the scone looked beautiful!  However, it was bland.  Next time I will add pumpkin spice to give it flavor!  Also, I made a glaze to drizzle on the top and they turned out so pretty just not flavorful.

They were moist, a little to moist. I like some crumble to it. To me a scone has more of a biscuit texture but moist. So still looking for the right one for me.

Made these today for coffee break as we had friends visiting. We all loved them. I did add spices: cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger and I used pecans instead of pine nuts as that was all I had. I think they would have been very blah without the addition of the spices.

Solid recipe.  I omitted pine nuts, used 1.5x the pumpkin and added pumpkin spice & cinnamon as others did.  Texture was great - remember, for pastry you want to work it as little as possible to keep the texture light.  Work until it JUST sticks together as crumbs.

I didn't add spices in the scone so I put them in the glaze. Very good that way!!

I made this recipe and followed the lead of several of you out there. Added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Still too bland for my taste so maybe I'll try adding a dash of vanilla or some ginger next time.  Did not add the nuts as I am allergic to nuts. I wonder if I added more pumpkin if that would make it too moist? Texture was more like a moist biscuit, which I enjoyed.

Delish! Add spices, omit nuts. Cream cheese glaze set these off for me. A new fall fav :) Gotta say Chef John, you never disappoint!!

This is an amazing recipe! The kind you can't stop eating...I literally covered the top with cinnamon and sugar and put chopped dates and a handful of raisons in the scone. When I rolled it, I mixed sugar into the flour as I don't like flour coated scones. Definitely a remake in my house! Next time though, I'll top with cinnamon and course raw sugar

These were lovely! I left out the pine nuts, since well, they're expensive and I didn't have any anyways. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon but next time my husband said I should add a full tsp, along with some other traditional pumpkin spices. As it was, it was just as Chef John described: not too moist, not too dry. The glaze was a nice touch. And these were even better warmed up in the toaster oven. This will become a standard recipe for using up my garden sugar pie pumpkins!

These are some great scones! I recommend substituting mini chocolate chips if you don't like pine nuts.

I'd call this a biscuit, rather than a scone. If you like a scone moist, flaky, and bland you might like it, but I prefer a dry, loose crumb. The absence of egg and spices in the batter should have tipped me off, but I probably would have tried them anyway, just to see.
