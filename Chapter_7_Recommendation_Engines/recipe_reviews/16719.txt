My husband, who has very little cooking experience, wanted to make french toast for us and so I looked up this recipe for him. This turned out so well that it is now our very favorite recipe for french toast...and I have tried dozens of different recipes for french toast. :)

I loved this recipe.  I did modify it instead of milk I used heavy cream, and for the bread I used Pepperidge farms french vanilla bread! Yummy! Be sure not to let your bread too long, I usually just coat one side, then the other and onto the hot skillet! Yummy

I really enjoyed this French Toast. I was only making 2 slices for me, and when I reduced the servings to 2 it said to use 2/3 eggs, but I was having problems with that so I just used 1 egg. And because of several reviews I cut the nutmeg portion about in half. You could still taste it, but it tasted good. I dipped this in maple syrup and cinnamin. It was great.

I WAS NOT THRILLED WITH THIS AT ALL. SOAKING THE BREAD TILL IT WAS SATURATED MADE THE BREAD WAY TOO SOGGY. MY FIRST BATCH WAS RUINED. ON THE SECOND BATCH I QUICKLY DIPPED THE BREAD IN THE EGG MIXTURE AND THAT WORKED BETTER. IM ONLY GIVING THIS THREE STARS BECAUSE MY HUSBAND SAID IT WAS OKAY.

People like to complicate French Toast for some reason. They like to add extracts and peel and liqueurs, soak Brioche in the custard over night... and on and on and on. They fiddle and fuss and screw around and somehow- somehow- it's never as good as the stuff they get at that little place down the street. 

Well. Having worked for a succession of little places down the street? This is the sort of recipe they use. Simple, made fresh and a la moment. 

In fact, with the addition of a splash of orange extract and a coating of Panko crumbs before frying, this is so close to the recipe for which I used to get raves- and which travelled with me through three kitchens- as to be indistinquishable. Good stuff- brown and crunchy on the outside, rich and custardy inside.

I would suggest using French bread- supermarket variety is fine- and using any left overs to make a first class grilled ham and cheese for lunch.

Made this for oldest son this morning. This is the kid that inhales food like he has never eaten. He had about 4 bites total out of 2 slices and wouldn't eat any more :-(  He didn't like the nutmeg taste and thought it was too soggy. When his brother came down for breakfast and saw his brother's plate he refused to even try it. Thanks anyway.

Pretty good.  I sprinkled brown sugar on top because I didn't have any syrup.  It provided just the right amount of sweetness.

I cut the recipe to 8 servings; ignored the egg count, and used 4; and used only 4 slices of challah bread.  It was the perfect amount of egg mixture for the long, 1-inch thick slices of bread.  I was leery of the nutmeg (I don't even like egg nog), but used the full amount anyway and was not disappointed!  My husband and kids approve.

i was skeptical when i first pulled these out of the pan but actually very tasty.  my family loved them with some real maple syrup for father's day.  i liked the added sugar which just lightly sweetened the toast.  i left out the nutmeg because i thought it might be to much of a pungent flavor.

I made this all by myself. I put in a teaspoon of vanilla. The sugar burned it a little, but we LOVED it. It made 11 pieces for us.

This is a good basic French Toast recipe.  The nutmeg taste is strong, so if you don't like nutmeg I would suggest you try something else.  I followed the directions exactly and my french toast turned out perfectly.

I think you have to use thick sliced bread, as it didn't work well at all with regular bread.

I think this was a good, basic french toast recipe.   I only wanted to do 10 slices of bread, which was good because I had no mixture left at all after the 10th slice.  To combat the sogginess of the toast, I dried the bread out in the over on 200 degrees for about 10 or 15 minutes, flipping them periodically.  I could have left them out overnight to achieve the same results if I had planned ahead.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the mixture, and sprinkled the finished product with powered sugar and cinnamon.  I found I didn't need much maple syrup because the toast has good flavor all on its own.

Needed a quick and easy french toast recipe for Christmas brunch when I found out I was having more guests than expected.  This not only fit the bill, but it was so delicious - possibly the best french toast we have ever had.  My husband was raving about it.  I think the addition of the brown sugar is genius.  Thanks for our new staple french toast recipe!

This was great!!  I scaled it to three servings so I only used one egg, and the ingredients proportions were perfect.  I never used brown sugar and nutmeg in my french toast before, but this will now be a staple.  I do suggest mixing the brown sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon with the egg first so when the milk is added the cinnamon and nutmeg don't separate and float.

Next time try using 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1 Tbs of cinnamon. Not as much milk either. Will turn out better for you.

If you are having trouble getting your french toast to cook all the way through: If you are making a large batch turn your oven to 350 and put them on a foil lined baking sheet AFTER you have cooked them in the pan/griddle. By the time you are ready to start serving you will have fully cooked french toast. If you are making a small batch (i.e for one or two); you can always pop these into the toaster (after they have been cooked through in a pan/griddle) if you think they need to be cooked a little more. On a side note: these freeze and reheat well in the toaster and leave your kitchen smelling wonderful. Also if you know you don't like nutmeg, or you are cooking for a "picky eater" cut back on the nutmeg! .....I add vanilla to this recipe because well I put vanilla in just about everything. Overall a great recipe easy to customize after you make it the first time. (i've always mixed the cinnamon in with the egg even though it gets a little clumpy but if you mix well and swirl it before you dip the bread it makes a lovely dark swirl on the bread). -Happy baking!

very very good french toast, this was my first time ever making it too!!

a couple things i changed was i halfed the recipe since it was only my boyfriend and i eating it, so i used 2 eggs, 1/4 cup milk, 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar, no nutmeg, dash of cinnamon and splash of vanilla in the batter.

i turned the heat down to medium because they were burning before getting done on the inside...but they tasted wonderful, we gobbled them up in minutes!
thanks!!

Great recipe!  I was out of milk so I used half and half cream instead.  Also omitted the nutmeg.  Tasted delicious!

Perfect standard recipe.  I used cream because I had it on hand as well as butter in the pan.

The perfect ratio of ingredients!  Nothing is too overpowering (which is always my fear with nutmeg)

Probably very good if I had  regular milk but i didn't....I make french toast pretty often and thought adding brown sugar would be a good idea... I usually add a little regular milk, (but not too much, as my husband doesn't KNOW I do it... )Today, I didnt have any milk and used french vanilla coffee creamer and the brown sugar.. The cook time seemed longer, and I wasnt sure it was cooked through, and as i turned up the heat, the sugar caused my french toast to start to burn... Mind you, my husband likes his french toast JUST SO, so i was VERY light on the sugar!!! I cooked 8 pieces of french toast (needed 6 eggs for this) and while we both scarfed most of it down, I prefer the old way-- the brown sugar didnt add anything in my opinion, and if you are usually maple syrup anyhow, the flavor is in there, without having to burn it while cooking... We DID eat it, and coffeemate may have attributed to the burning, but I thought I would mention this anyway..

This is great! My kids love it. I cut it into sticks so they can dip them. I also don't soak them. I flip it a few times in the batter and that is it.   You can also cut these into sticks, put them on a baking sheet and put in the freezer for a few hours. Then put in zip lock baggies. Then you can have them ready to eat whenever! Great for kids breakfasts :)

This was my first time making french toast and it turned out great! I used texas toast and left out the nutmeg because we were out. I sprinkled powdered sugar on it and cut it into french toast sticks for my 2 year old. She loved dipping it in syrup. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

My partner and I both wanted to give this a three and a half star, but we couldn't bring it up to four. We made it exactly to recipe and felt it was a little bland. The nutmeg was lovely. We couldn't tell that it was made with brown sugar. We used a very dense home-made white loaf and it worked very well. With the denser bread the slices we soaked for longer were creamier and more flavourful. We fried some slices in butter and felt the added salt and richness made it tastier. If I made it again I would add butter and perhaps vanilla to the batter, and if it were still bland add syrup.

Today is my birthday and my husband went on this website (he knows I love it and get recipes almost daily off of it...) and desided to make this for me.  Breakfast in bed!  It was great :)  My daughter Skye also made me some cinnamon toast.  I am so spoiled!

If you aren't a nutmeg fan, this Recipe isn't for you.  I wanted to try something different than our usual Recipe when I tried this recipe.  By the time my family was done, they were asking me not to make it again.  The nutmeg flavor was strong and but I liked the brown sugar addition.  My biggest complaint was that it made the bread really soggy.  I even tried turning up/down the heat but I couldn't dry the pieces out.

Made this, for my husband, two sons and a friend. Came out to 9 slices of Texas Toast. Only thing I did different was add the cinnamon to the egg batter, cause I was lazy about sprinkling on finished toasts. The out come was delish!

Am going to use my recipe of French Toast. Same ingredients, but I like to dip each slice of bread in flour, shake extra flour off, then dip in egg mix. Toast comes out, not soggy at all!

This was quite tasty! I've used cinnamon with French Toast but never nutmeg. It gave it a nice extra dimension to the flavour. :) I did leave out the brown sugar as maple syrup makes things plenty sweet for me. One important thing: don't saturate these, that's asking for a soggy mess! Make these like you would any other French toast - quickly dip each side in the mix and cook.

I made this for breakfast this morning, and the family liked it a lot! we had one picky eater who didn't finish his, but overall it was a winner. I changed a couple of things to this recipe. First i used real french bread, and took many other reviewers advice and only dipped the bread slices in the batter instead of letting it soak. In the batter i added slightly more cinnamon and nutmeg than the recipe called for, and like some other reviewers, i added some vanilla. I also added some unsweetened shedded coconut. It was a nice, quick breakfast. It's super tasty served with freshly cut strawberries and bananas, and mapple syrup :)

This was the best French Toast i have made.  YOU MUST USE THICK STALE BREAD! That is the trick, as it's not too soggy and tastes perfect.  The bread will definitely make or break this french toast
Will definitely make again and again

Only made this for one so I changed the recipe yield to 3 so that I only used 1 egg. I didnt have brown sugar so I used regular sugar instead. Also couldn't find my nutmeg. I added a tad bit of vanilla and decided I wanted something extra and added just enough chocolate syrup to give it that light chocolate milk color. Had exactly enough for 2 slices of bread which was what I wanted to begin with. Turned out really well and the little bit of chocolate gave it the perfect taste. Looks like I need to hit the store for brown sugar and nutmeg though- can't live without my staples. Overall a great base recipe- I just don't follow recipes well.

Super good! I've had this same recipe but without the brown sugar, and the caramelized sugar really makes this one stand out. I cut the recipe in half for just me and my husband, though, and the liquid was gone before I could make 6 pieces of bread.

Very good and easy traditional french toast. It works excellent when using homemade sliced bread (even your quickbreads for a sweeter french toast). Excellent!

Turned out great. revision: do not soak the bread in the mixture. I just made sure both sides of the bread was covered then placed on the pan on medium heat.  Used wheat bread because that's what I had, & it was still very good! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe.  I had some left over white bread in the fridge that I wanted to use up, and my husband really liked it.  May try with a thicker bread next time.

I've never made french toast using brown sugar before, and boy have I been missing something.  This recipe was delicious.  I did substitute a tsp of vanilla for the nutmeg (not a big fan of nutmeg), but the brown sugar is definitely the deal maker.  Thanks!!!

this recipe is fabulous! the brown sugar and nutmeg add a special touch. I tend to use just egg whites instead of whole eggs and it is delicious!  Thanks for a wonderful post!

I eliminated the nutmeg all together and added about 1 1/4 tsp. vanilla. Best French toast ever!

I rather like this recipe and have made it several times. The only things keeping this from getting five stars are: (1) Perhaps I am soaking my bread too long, but there is no way I could get 12 pieces of bread dipped with the the amount of batter the recipe makes. I usually only get about 6 slices. (2) The recipe doesn't specify how long to cook other than until brown. It was a trial and error process the first time I made these to get toast that wasn't soggy. I have found medium-low heat for about 4 minutes on each side produces perfect toast.

WOW!  This was AMAZING!  (And no mushy middle as SublimeMind82 reported.)  Not only is this exceedingly easy to make, and LOOKS fantastic (thank you, nutmeg), but the aroma that fills the kitchen and the house is incredible.  I will never go back to generic French Toast...this is our new standard. :)

I made this recipe with a few modifications.  I only used 3 eggs (all I had), a big splash of milk, a large pinch of nutmeg, 3 large pinches of brown sugar, a pinch of ground cinnamon in the egg mixture and I added a pinch of dried ground lemon peel (McCormick's) and I fried the bread in peanut oil (peanut oil never burns) and butter.  I finished off the french toast with a drizzle of melted butter and powder sugar and it was really easy and delicious!  I will be making this again when I am short on time and I want a crowd pleaser.

Excellent French Toast!  One of the best I've ever had...good job!  I'd like to add that any leftover egg mixture also makes very light and fluffy scrambled eggs.

it was a very easy simple recipe.  We ended up not having enough nutmeg (we had maybe 1/2 tsp)......and my husband let one of the pieces soak for too long and it fell apart (rookie mistake!)  All in all, we will make it again...very good.

Simple and fast. A perfect week day treat.  I used left over day old French bread sliced quite thick. It was delicious! My 2 year old loved it cut into strips for dipping.

This is a pretty good recipe. Simple and basic.  I found this recipe when I realized I didn't have any breakfast food in the house. I cut the serving in half and it was more then enough for 2 adults.  I followed the instructions, but added a little bit of vanilla extract and just a shake of nutmeg since my feeling is that it can be too overpowering.  You could really spruce this recipe up with french bread or top with berries.  I'd definitely make again.

I thought this was a great and simple recipe. It took no time to make. Mine did not turn out soggy at all. I cut the yolk out of my egg (I only eat egg whites), used fat free milk, and whole wheat bread. Instead of using brown sugar in the recipe, I spinkled the tops of them with powdered sugar when they were done cooking. I cooked them at a med-high temp. on a skillet. They turned out great! Dont forget the syrup!

This is a great simple recipe.  It's exactly the kind of French Toast I was looking for.  We are not fans of the mushy baked french toast recipes, so this was perfect.  I used thick sliced white bread and was able to make 6 slices.  Would have been 7, but I accidentally left a slice in the mixture too long and when I picked it up, it broke all to pieces.

Excellent French Toast. Only had white bread on hand, but turned out great!! Would recommend turning down the burner to medium/low to allow it to cook through, then turn burner to medium/high to brown both sides. Thanks for a great breakfast!

This is a simple recipe.  No fuss, no muss.  I used to wing it every time I made French toast.  They were never a hit...too much cinnamon, not sweet enough. I would never put brown sugar in French toast.

This is just a simple recipe, and simple sometimes is best!
If your family is fussy, leave out the nutmeg. Here is a note...
....Nutmeg contains small amounts of a drug called myristicin, which is chemically similar to mescaline, the active compound in peyote, and may be converted in the body to one of the related amphetamine-like psychedelics.
Now back to the recipe....I let the slices of white bread "dry out" overnight so the bread is dry to the touch and it won't soak up as much egg mixture & get soggy or fall apart when picking it up out of the bowl. This also speeds up the cooking time since there is not as much egg to cook "in the bread"
(A additional hint is to just use Cinnamon/Sugar mixture instead of adding brown sugar) Also for Diabetics use Spenda/Cinnamon mixture you can make right at home.

This was actually pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised. I was afraid that the bread would get soggy, I only dipped hte bread in long enough to coat it, then cooked. That did the trick. The bread stayed more like bread on the inside. I even did one in a little more oil and they got slightly crunchy on the outside, my kids tore them up. Easy and simple lunch or breakfast.

I accidently doubled the brown sugar, and as I taste tested it before feeding the kids, found myself having a few too many pieces.  VERY RECOMMENDED!  And they loved it too!  Not topping needed, great finger food with protein!  I also used whole wheat bread and 2% milk and added the cinnamon to the eggs not to the top.

Very flavorful with the huge amounts of cinnamon and nutmeg called for.  I also added a splash of vanilla.  I've never put brown sugar in my egg mixture - added sweetness, but no outside carmelization (as I'd hoped).  'Saturated' to me meant a quick flip to coat, and that seemed to worked.  A decent start.

If you use a nice thick slice of bread (such a French bread)... it works great and it won't get soggy.

Decent for it's ease, but leaves your French toast a little soggy & it's seasonings don't really hold up once cooked. Great introduction dish for beginners but just a simple change up for well groomed cooks.

This was good.  I used a french baguette and halfed the nutmeg.  I also added a little cinnamon and vanilla right to the dipping mixture. Will definitely make again - but will probably use even less nutmeg next time.

We really liked the addition of brown sugar and the full tablespoon of cinnamon. My bread was REALLY stale so soaking a little longer worked well for me. The egg/milk ratio was perfect. With the addition of brown sugar, only a slight drizzle of homemade maple/vanilla syrup was needed. Great french toast recipe.

I had a craving for French Toast, but had no vanilla in the house. I think the nutmeg was what did me in. It was just ok and if you like nutmeg, maybe you will really like this one!

I just made this for breakfast!  Not only was it easy and quick to make, it is no where near expensive!  I didn't have any nutmeg, but Oh Goodness was it AMAZING!  Thank you Robert Jordan for a fantastic recipe!  Also, I topped ours (a family of 5) with some powdered sugar and syrup.  Sweet and delish!  Took less then 15 minutes to make and devour!

This was very good :). We used homemade french bread, maple syrup, and bananas! I also just dipped the pieces of bread instead of saturating them. Yum!

this was really good! however, i didn't "saturate" the bread, just quickly dipped it on both sides and put it on the frying pan. I didn't add nutmeg either, i added a little less than 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I'm sure it would've been better if i made it with white bread, all i had was double fiber bread. It was pretty good, especially if you put a lot of syrup, as mine was slightly dry

Awesome french toast! I used the cinnamon swirl bread from Trader Joes and sliced it myself to get nice thick slices. My family says this is the best french toast ever! Love it!

This is the BEST French Toast recipe i have ever found! I figured out that it tastes even better when you use cinnamon bread in place of white bread.

I thought this was a great recipe and it was fast! I didn't have nutmeg so I added vanilla in place of it and I added a tablespoon of melted butter because I didn't have milk and mixed all the stuff (minus the cinnamon of course)- be sure to really mix in the brown sugar- mine was a bit clumpy at first in the egg mixutre and I had to break up the little pieces.... I cooked the slices separately in my greenpan skillet (love that skillet!!) on medium-low for 30 seconds on each side 3 times  and then put each slice in the oven in a dish to keep the slices warm until I was ready to serve them. The cinnamon sprinkled on top was a REALLY nice addition! I would try it if you haven't before. We also added a sprinkle of powdered/confection sugar and maple syrup. Thanks so much for this recipe!! The flavors were really great!!!

I'll be honest, I didn't even READ the directions. I've made french toast before, so I just wanted to see what else besides egg and milk you could use. This was DELICIOUS!! Since I made it just for myself, I used 2 eggs, just under 1/4 cup milk, probably 1/2 tbl of brown sugar and two shakes of cinnamon (I didn't measure the milk, sugar, or cinnamon, just what seemed right). I didn't have any nutmeg, but it tasted great with a bit of maple sryup. Oh, I also cut two big slices of Chullah bread -mmMMMMmmm.... Will definitely be using these ingredients from now on.

I also cut out the nutmeg and added vanilla in place. I put the cinnamon in with the mixture instead of topping it off. Dont let the bread soak to long or the inside will get mushy.

The number of slices is too many for this recipe - it should be about 6. Type of brown sugar not specified (light/dark). Using regular granulated sugar would be better - less likely to burn. A tablespoon of cinnamon is too much. It just floated on top of the mixture and was soaked up by the first few slices.

I have to say this french toast is pretty good with syrup. Without the syrup, and even kind of with it, it doesnt offer a whole lot of flavor. Next time I might add a little more cinnamon to give it a little more flavor. Will make this again.

I've made this recipe like 4 times this month!  Each time I've sub'd eggnog for the milk ('tis the season) and the first 3 times I forgot the nutmeg, however, when I made it for Christmas breakfast, I used freshly grated nutmeg - magnifico!! I think I could have eaten this without the syrup and it would have been tasty.  This recipe definitely goes on the "hit" list.  Once the holidays are over I'll try the recipe exactly as written, with milk not eggnog.

This is a good tasting, straight forward, and easy way to make french toast.  Although, I like dusting with powdered sugar at the end to add some more sweetness.

I really liked this recipe.  I did add additional things to the recipe such as vanilla and allspice which gave the French toast more of a pumpkin pancake flavor to it. Since I had to use soy milk for the recipe, I didn't use all 4 eggs and it still came out great.  I also didn't let it get sopping wet with the mixture but that is mainly for preference as I don't like eggy French toast.  Thank you so much!

This was great. Very easy to make, little time and delicious. Instead of white bread, I used Apple Strudel bread (and omitted the nutmeg and cinn, the first time).  The second time I included the spices and it really didn't make a noticable difference.

These were very good. I did change the recipe a bit by using only half the required amount of nutmeg as I don't always like that flavor. We will probably use this recipe again!

Very yummy recipe! I used Saigon cinnamon instead of regular and sliced bolillo bread, fried it using butter, added some mixed berries on the side, added some Mrs. Butterworth, and it was delish! My sister, who usually shuns greasy or typical American breakfast food, took a small slice when my brother and I ate our portions. Afterwards, she proceeded to eat 2 more slices...a testiment to how good these were. Thanks for the recipe!

I hadn't made French toast in years & had forgotten how simple & delicious it was.  We had this for breakfast on our wedding anniversary & it was quick & easy, little clean up, easily adapted to make smaller quantities.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing it with us.

Delicious! This recipe was better than the other french toast recipes I have tried.  The brown sugar l made a difference.  I could not make the recipe without adding vanilla flavoring since every good french toast recipe has vanilla.  I added a whole cup of milk which didn't really affect the outcome.  Just coated, did not soak the bread.  All of my children had seconds.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great tasting recipe. We used italian bread. Leave the crust on. Let it soak for a few minutes,until it absorbs the batter. Then place in a 9x13 dish and bake in the oven. So easy to make. Thank you for sharing!

As my husband said, "that was yummy"!  All family members loved it.  I used the exact recipe plus a tsp. of vanilla. I also did not soak bread for too long. I have looked for an easy but delicious french toast for awhile. The aroma while cooking was so good.

Oh my gosh I can't say enough about this. I have always thought of french toast as something to cook when I didn't feel like cooking but this recipe is so much more than that. It is so full of flavor. I think the nutmeg is what really makes this recipe work.

Tasty french toast with a twist. The nutmeg added a different flavor and went well with the maple syrup. I didn't soak the bread slices, just dipped, flipped, and into the hot pan. The next time I would cut back on the milk as it was too wet and could have been more eggy. I'll add more sugar too and a little vanilla since that is my traditional touch. I will fix this again. Thanks for a nice meal!

Similar to my regular French toast method, but the nutmeg was a nice addition - used slightly less than called for. Made it with homemade French bread which I'd sliced a couple hours ahead to allow it to dry slightly. Added a dash of sea salt.

I have tried to make french toast before and failed miserably.  This is an easy recipe and very very good.  My 7 year old daughter enjoyed helping me make this, and we both agree it could use something extra.  Next time we make this, which we will make this again using this recipe, we are going to add a teaspoon of vanilla.  Very, very yummy.  The brown sugar is very ingenious!!

We thought this was delicious!  I used a day old loaf of French bread.  I also cut way back on the nutmeg, using just a very small pinch, and it was just enough to flavor the toast without overpowering it.  The cinnamon sprinkled on top after cooking was a great touch!  I think this will be my recipe for French toast from now on.

This was pretty good.  I thought it was much better than French Toast I.  I liked the addition of brown sugar, that was a new concept to me.  Also, it seemed to have a good balance of spices.  If you are using a good homemade bread and slicing it thick, you will need more egg mixture than the recipe calls for.

This recipe turned out to be a hit! It has the perfect amount of sweetness, and I topped it with carmalized apples. I took the advice of most reviews, and put less nutmeg, just a dash. I also did not "saturate" the bread in the liquid. I dunked it in a couple of times.
This recipe is exactly what I was looking for! Thanks!

This was a very easy recipe to follow and for someone who had never made french toast before I was surprised at how simple it was. I didn't have any nutmeg on hand but it was fine just with the cinnamon. We'll definately have it again.

Followed the recipe exactly, and turned out perfect.  My dad and sister didn't notice there was brown sugar or nutmeg in them, but I figured it was just because they'd already drowned them in syrup!!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This french toast is really good.  It's very nutmeggy before sprinkling the toast with the cinnamon.  The cinnamon tones down the nutmeggy flavor and adds it's own breakfast-flavor.  We enjoyed this breakfast and I plan to make it again.

The nutmeg was overpowering, and I couldn't even eat mine because it was so soggy. The flavors did not work well in french toast. Will not make again.

I made this recipe for myself and my two brothers. I changed the amount of servings from 12 to 6 and followed the revised recipe. However I did change the amount of nutmeg to 1/4 tsp, and I didn't soak the bread to prevent it from being too soggy. The french toast turned out too nutmeg-y and it was also too dry. None of us like it. Won't be making it again.

This was very good. I made it exactly as this recipe instructed. We do not eat white bread, but I forgot to make Challah the previous day...so I bought some basic white and dried it out on a plate for about 5 hours. The result reminded me of the simple french toast I grew up eating.

Better to dip both sides then to "soak" bread slices. And no french toast recipe is complete without vanilla. In mine, I use authentic Mexican vanilla. Otherwise, good basic recipe.

My first time making french toast (hey, I'm a college student) and it was pretty good.  I used Egg Beaters, skim milk, and whole wheat bread.  However, either "saturating" the slices or using medium-high heat caused it to cook on the outsides and stay soggy on the insides.  I'm not picky so it still tasted fine to me, but next time I'll just dip each side instead of soaking and use medium/medium-low heat.

I was reluctant to use that much nutmeg but I wanted to follow the directions exactly.  I did use sandwhich bread because that's all I had.  And no one in my family liked it.  Too much nutmeg, it was edible but that's about it.

Agree with some of the above, saturating the bread ruined them. Also, I think the portions are off as I was barely able to get 7 pieces of bread done, not 12.
I do NOT recommend this one. I would have thought something like this would be hard to get wrong. Not so with this recipie.

Shamefully I have to admit I had not made French Toast in at least 30 years, and suddenly got a hankering for it.  So I found this easy recipe on Allrecipes and decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  Quick and simple to prepare and cook up, and the taste was wonderful!!  Every bite was French Toast perfection!  I won't let another 30 years go by, I assure you.  Loved it!

Turned out pretty good.... I’d say tone down the nutmeg a little - maybe in half. A little over powering but I really enjoyed the recipe. Thanks!

French Toast its my favorite for breakfast. I am currently taking some gastronomy courses and found this receipt interesting with the nutmeg. In addition to the ingredients, I use a pinch of salt, a pinch of nutmeg instead, nd the vanilla extract. these three are the secret. In the final touch cinammon powder for presentation .

Perfect combination of flavors.  I used a day old loaf of Italian bread sliced a bit thicker than a standard slice of white bread.  I let it soak in the egg for a couple minutes and it was just right.  Thanks!

Yes this is good. However, it didn't seem like a unique special recipe to me. I did use a drop of vanilla but less nutmeg.

I am that guy, I changed the recipe.  But it was out of necessity. I switched the nutmeg to ginger because I did not have nutmeg. I actually made this recipe for a food demonstration at my local Health Department for WIC clients. It was very well received and quite frankly I was surprised how many people did not know how to make French toast.

Definitely worth trying! I find that by adding a teaspoon of vanilla and using half as much nutmeg makes a big difference in the flavor of the toast! Other than that, I will keep this on hand.

I used bakery bread, which I left set for several days sliced it fairly thick.  I had one slice soak too long, so the rest i pretty much dipped quickly. Added some vanilla to the batter and it was awesome !!!!!!!

The milk to egg ratio was good in this recipe. I don't like adding sugar to French toast since you're putting on syrup anyway, but I did add a sprinkle of brown sugar, and thought it was good. I thought the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg was too much, so I just sprinkled in both until it looked like enough.  I added the cinnamon to the egg batter.

I think it was delicious. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and used brioche. The sugar burned a little, so I cooked it longer over lower heat (a 4 on my gas stove) with a lid. I'm not sure if it burned because I used a non-stick pan. Maybe you'd get different results from a stainless steel or cast iron pan. I'd defer to an expert to know the difference. I'd make it again. Stir the batter between dipping the bread. The spices sink to the bottom.

Excellent as written. Even better with half and half or cream instead of milk. My favorite FT recipe thus far; thank you :)

Just made it using a slice of Angel food cake, used egg whipped with a little heavy cream and cooked in butter.   Will never use bread again.

I have never added nutmeg or brown sugar to the egg mixture until  now. I loved it. The nutmeg adds a little zing to it, not a lot, just the right amount. This is how I will make my French Toast from now on. Great easy recipe.

Split decision: my wife liked it, I found it bland. I suspect that the very different experiences with sogginess has to do with the type of bread used and the thickness of the slice. Mine came out a bit dry, to my taste. Next time, I'll up the quantity of spices and slice my bread thicker.

The rating should really be 3.5.

It was quite nice, especially with the cinnamon, however, the nutmeg seemed a bit unorthodox.  Not bad at all, just different. Totally recommend with some strawberry jam!

This was great! Instead of a teaspoon of nutmeg I used 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon. I didn't sprinkle cinnamon at the end or the flavor would be too overpowering.

Excellent recipe!  My new favorite French toast recipe.  I made a couple changes to the recipe based on previous reviews.  I used 3 eggs, 1/2 cup of milk, 1 TBSP of orange extract, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  I also excluded the brown sugar...which was a mistake, but it turned out phenominal with just the perfect amount of sweetness.  I greased the griddle with Crisco and fried the batter dipped, thick french bread slices until golden brown. After cooking,   I added a dollop of butter and sprinkled cinnamon and powdered sugar, maple syrup and a small bit of whip cream on the side like the picture above.  Perfection!!!

Thank you!  This will be in my permanent "wow" them file.

The cinnamon and nutmeg were way too overpowering. It tasted more like a strange cinnamon roll/pumpkin pie concoction. I would not make this again. I'll stick to my good old egg, milk, & vanilla extract recipe.

This recipe is amazing!! It was my first time making French toast. I replaced the nutmeg with cloves and cinnamon. Then I added sugar to the cinnamon sprinkle, and I garnished it with sliced kiwi! I'm definitely doing this again!

For one serving:  I didn't soak the bread until it was saturated because I don't like soggy french toast. I should have used more milk in the beginning because there wasn't enough to coat both sides of my third piece of bread.  The taste was pretty good, but I prefer sprinkling the cinnamon and nutmeg on the coated bread before cooking.

I don't often like French Toast, but I enjoyed this! 
I used a heavy, whole grain bread and found it was delicious.

Brilliant Recipe!! I used multigrain bread & cut big slices.. I modified the recipe a little & used half a tea spoon of Vanilla essence & added freshly & coarsely ground cinnamon to the batter & no nutmeg.. 
Also I added an extra teaspoon of sugar.. All this tasted so awesome that i needed No maple syrup or honey on top :)
My husband & i enjoyed it straight out of the pan.. Absolutely DELICIOUS!!
Thank you so much :)

Turned out pretty good! I did add a little bit of Vanilla Extract to the recipe. I also used Texas Toast instead of regular white/wheat bread. The bread was not get soggy and did not fall apart when I used Texas Toast.

It makes for a good amount to saturate the bread but it seemed like something was missing. I added an extra egg the second time and it was better.

Can home from a morning shopping excursion, hubby and I were hungry for something nurishing but light. I used 2 eggs, 1/3 cup milk, nutmeg and cinnamon, and 4 slices wholewheat bread.But the best part: I used my waffle maker to cook the toast.Easy, and yummy.

Loved the taste! Amazing flavour. I didn't have any nutmeg though. ALSO! I quartered the recipe but found 1 egg was not enough for 3 bread slices. It was barely enough for 2!

I doubled the recipe except the nutmeg and added 1 tsp pure vanilla.  I cooked it on a electric griddle at 350 degrees for 5 minutes per side. While it did turn out a bit soggy they tasted delicious!

Didn't change a thing. This reminded me of restaurant style French toast. I sprinkled powdered sugar on top and the whole family said they loved it, and when I was going to make it again.

Yum!  Great recipe.  Used Challah & it was divine.  Added some cardamom & vanilla too.  

French toast recipes aren't really difficult... it's eggs and milk.

Very good and simple. I used Texas toast. I scaled the recipe down to 6 but it only made 4.  Also added cinnamon and nutmeg.

I made this recipe for the first time today. My rookie mistake was letting the bread soak too much in the mix - but after the 3rd slice, things were looking (and tasting) fine!  My kids loved it!  I added the cinnamon to the mix and then added powdered sugar once it was complete. My kids loved it!

I am a huge nutmeg fan, so I knew that I was going to love it.  I also love the addition of the brown sugar.  It caramelized on the toast, giving it a lovely brown color and little crunch.  My kids kept going and going until this was gone.  Unfortunately, I only ended up getting one piece, but I am glad that everyone enjoyed it.

Taste was very good - used potato bread and low fat milk - that's all I had. Tried to soak one piece to see how it would do. Too soggy :) Will use this as a base "go to" recipe and for experimenting. Thanks!

Not to bad, looks burnt when it comes out of the pan but tastes good.  My little girl normally loves french toast, but we had to fight with her to eat.  Made two batches with texas toast and only left bread in mix for about a min on both sides.  The one we left in til saturated was so burnt outside and soggy inside we had to throw it out.

This is a great basic recipe. You can add ingredients or take out. It is true you have to dip the bread quickly but I have noticed that with all french toast recipes. Some people said it was too soggy but I've had this problem with other recipes to. When I take them out of the pan I just let them sit a couple minutes like scrambled eggs they tell you to not cook them all the way because when you take them off the pan the continue cooking.

This is ideal for a quick, but warm and filling breakfast! I was weary about the 1 tsp. of nutmeg (from reading the reviews on here), so I just LIGHTLY sprinkled the nutmeg (emphasizing on the LIGHTLY) to the rest of the ingredients. Also, I only had multi-grain bread on hand which worked out just fine. THANKS for the recipe :)

Was my first time having french toast. It was alright, don't know if it was something that I may have done wrong or if maybe I just don't think french toast is that great. But my mom and stepdad loved it.

Good basic recipe. I used rice milk rather than regular milk, and maple syrup rather than brown sugar. Made less than 12 slices, but using rice milk (which is thinner than regular milk) and sandwich bread may have something to do with that. Next time I'll try a bread with more character.

I changed the ingredients a bit to make it more healthier. I used whole wheat bread and in replace of sugar, I used honey. Still tastes great for being "healthy".

YUMM-O!  I made it without the nutmeg, but left everything else as it was.  Very tasty!  Exactly what I was looking for this morning--a quick, easy, tasty French Toast recipe, thanks!

Fabulous recipe!  I must admit, it is not fair of everyone who embellishes/changes the recipe before rating as is.  That said, the ingredients are spot on, in totality. LOVE the nutmeg instead of vanilla that just about every recipe I read has. I think I did goof by adding the cinnamon to the egg mixture, but oh how divine they turned out!  And they will NOT burn if you adjust your heat correctly.  This is my only go-to recipe now.  Fast, easy, delicious.  Thank you.

I think that this recipe shouln't have nutmeg in it. It gives it a wierd flavor and texture. Make sure that you don't let it soak otherwise it will become mushy. I've had better French Toast.

very good, didn't use any nutmeg because I didn't have any in the house.  I quickly dipped each side of my bread because they were very thinly sliced pieces.  Yummy!

While not bad, I have to say, the amount of nutmeg is a bit off the charts! 1/4 tsp would have been MORE than sufficient. And WHATEVER you do, DON'T soak regular white sandwich bread, you won't be able to transfer it from the bowl to the pan. A quick dip should do the trick nicely. I don't reccomend this recipe very highly, I'll stick to eggs, sugar, vanilla, and a lil sprinkle of cinnamon. Perfect mix. Oh, and BTW, in case anyone didn't know already, nutmeg is REALLY expensive, thats why a lil goes a long way.

i actually put 1/4 cup milk and 1/2 cup half n half - makes for a richer french toast.  also, i tried adding orange zest from a whole orange and it really kicked up the flavor and my husband loooooved it!  sometimes i add coconut extract too... but i always add vanilla extract to my french toast.  this recipe made over 12 slices and i used big slices of french bread - not sure why people are getting less than 8 slices?  leave out the nutmeg.

Just like my dad makes! I never make french toast because it never works for me.. but this recipe is great. Like many reviews say, don't soak the bread for long -- just dip it and move it to the pan. If you soak it for too long, it gets mushy. I also left out the nutmeg completely per a few reviews, and it tasted great without it.

I never use a recipe for french toast and that's probably why it never comes out very good :( I made this french toast this morning and I loved it. I used whole wheat french bread that I baked the night before and used a little less nutmeg than listed in the recipe (about 1/2 a teaspoon) and it turned out great. For my french bread sitting it in the bowl of egg mixture and letting it saturate worked well since the bread was quite dense. Thanks!

I followed recipe and this was not good at all. No one took more than one bite. I think the nutmeg flavor was way too strong so maybe if you cut way back on that it would be better but I don't think I will be making it again.

Having never made homemade french toast, I have to say this was excellent! My husband made it this morning and the whole family thought it was delicious.  We topped it with syrup, cinnamon & sugar and a little powdered sugar.  We look forward to making it again. Thanks Robert.

I just want to thank you for this awesome recipe. Had to make breakfast for work and this was a total success. Only thing I did slightly different was adding a bit of vanilla extract. Other than that it was AWESOME. THANK YOU.

This was very quick and easy. I admit that the bread did get soggy if you let it saturate but if you toast it in the toaster first then just dip it like twice into the mixture it comes out perfect. I know toasting it first sounds weird but it works...just put it on the lowest toaster setting so you don't actually cook it. lol. Other than that, we all loved the flavor, including my picky husband and 15 month old.

Best French Toast recipe that I have tried....and I have tried about 3 others!!!! I changed a few things for my family. I used a little extra brown sugar and cinnamon and just a few sprinkles of nutmeg. I also add some regular white sugar and used wheat bread!!! So good, my husband was looking for more!!!!!

Yum! I am allergic to milk, so I used Silk creamer instead--which mimics half and half in recipes. I used slightly stale french bread.

This was delicious. The spices suited us fine. However, I would like to point out something.  The recipe as is, is supposed to make 12 servings.  I believe it should say 6 servings - two slices per person.  I adjusted the recipe to serve my husband and myself for breakfast this morning.  The resulting egg mixture barely covered two slices of bread.  However, knowing that, I will make this again, we really did enjoy it.  Not soggy at all.

I followed the recipe exactly and turned up with nice smelling, soggy bread. The outside was able to brown nicely but from the first to the last piece, every single one was mushy in the middle and no one would eat it. I won't make this again.

This was a huge hit at our weekly breakfast gathering at my our house.  I switched gears one week and made this instead of biscuits or muffins.  Now I have to make them every weekend b/c everyone loves them.  One 3 y/o kid asked as he ate the last bite, "What's this stuff in my mouth?"  I told him and he said can I have more French Toast please??  I actually had to make more.

We made this recipe for breakfast this morning and I was very disappointed. The recipe tasted like it was missing something.  I feel it used too much nutmeg.  We will not be making this one again.

Easy to make and yummy french toast. My husband and kid liked it, I sure will save this one in my recipes box. Only remark I have: the eggs were just enough for 8 slices, but I guess that really depends on the toast you are using!

Very good- the added sweetness from the brown sugar was perfect for our family (we aren't really syrup fanatics, we just drizzle). My youngest loved it so much he dropped his fork and was eating it by hand. Thanks!  **I used artisan whole wheat bread that I sliced thickly - it made 6 thicke slices instead of 12 thinner slices. I shook powdered sugar on the tops instead of cinnamon.

this was really good. i added an extra egg, replaced the nutmeg with vanilla, and served with banana slices. its really important to make sure the slices soak in the egg mixture really well, otherwise they taste to much like toast rather than french toast. this was an extremely easy recipe, so i will be making it often.

Great recipe. Not soggy like some reviewers said. Just make sure you cook it long enough and it's perfect.

i scaled this back to make three servings (1 egg even). i didn't use the nutmeg and added a bit of vanilla as recommended by other reviewers. i would try using some nutmeg last time as the way i made it was a bit bland... but tasty and easy!

I made these for my boyfriend this morning and he liked them a lot. I only changed two things...I didn't have nutmeg so that was omitted and I added a 1/3 of a cup of white sugar. He likes his french toast sweet. I didn't have any so I can't say if it was yummy but it got his approval so I'm guessing it was. Very easy and quick to make, which I love!

This is going to be our main recipe for French Toast.  Great flavor but, need to double the ingredients.  I halved it and was only  able to get 4 slices of Texas Toast bread.  Easy fix next time.  Thanks for sharing.

This was great! I made this for my brother and me and I wasn't disappointed. The only bread I had on hand was wheat, but it was surprisingly good anyway. I sprinkled a little more cinnamon on the top and dusted powdered sugar over it when they were done. I served it with warm maple syrup and it was delicious! Perfect texture and good flavor.

My family loves french toast but we like it sweet, so I added alot more sugar, brown and white. I also added more cinnamon but the nutmeg was just right. Sorry I don't have the exact measurments.

Hmmm, I've had some great French toast so I wasn't too thrilled when I tasted this recipe. I agree with other reviews that the nutmeg is too overpowering. I even cut it down and it was still too much. Dont think I will be using this again.

YUM - added 1 tsp of vanilla, just because I'm inclined that way and used sourdough bread.  The sourdough makes it a little easier to work with because it doesn't fall apart as quickly and the sweet/ tang contrast was nice.

This is a good recipe.  However, I tried using the recommended amount of nutmeg and it was too much and imparted too strong of a taste.  Next time I'll cut the amount in half.  I'm not sure about saturating the bread in the wet mixture, either.  I scaled the recipe to four pieces, and when I saturated the first piece of bread in the mixture, I ended up not having enough left for the remaining three pieces.  A quick dip of both sides of bread may be enough.  Still, this was a good recipe!

I am not a cook, but these turned out great.  Lower heat is the key when you saturate the bread.  Everyone liked them!

This was my first time actually making french toast and it turned out great and very delicious! I like the flavor of nutmeg in this, however it was a little too strong for my tastes, so next time I will reduce the amount. I will stick to this recipe next time I make french toast! :)

caution! do not soak the bread.  Also I would not use Med- high head as the directions call for.  Perhaps just medium.

Quite good...the nutmeg was a bit strong so I would reduce that...Made the recipe for 6 servings and only used 4 bread slices which was the perfect amount.

I tried this recipe by replacing the milk with heavy cream (left over from another recipe) and added 1 additional tablespoon brown sugar.  The French Toast came out delicious!  Will use this recipe again.

This is the best French toast ever!!!! I cut the recipe in half, added cinnamon to the batter instead of sprinkling it on top, used leftover French bread, and cooked it on my griddle. Ate it with butter and syrup. The only thing missing was powdered sugar (didn't have any) YUMMY!!!!!

The taste was fine, but the scaling was a little off--scaled to 6 servings and there was only enough for 4 using plain white bread.  The taste was pretty good, though.

I did not care for this recipe.  That being said however, I never care for French Toast so keep that in mind.  To me, French Toast is nutritional supplement & nothing more.  My 2 sons however really liked it & one of them is a very picky eater.  I was surprised that he'd even try it.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Next time I'll leave the nutmeg out.  I added a little vanilla, which I really liked.  I just dipped it in the mixture and held the bread over the bowl to get the excess mixture off so it wasn't soggy.  Very good recipe!

Kids, hubby - everyone loved this one.  I dipped the bread quickly vs. soaking as I was using regular slice bread.  Next time I'll cut my own (thick) slices from a loaf and add a bit of vanilla.

This was delicious...I love the combination of the brown sugar and nutmeg in the egg/milk mix.  I served mine with cherry preserves, vanilla yogurt, and fresh mint.

This recipe tasted good but I thought it was too soggy. I saturated the bread, I think next time I will only dip it quickly in the mixture. Also, I left out the nutmeg because I did not have any here.

My new French Toast Recipe! I thought the brown sugar might be too sweet, however, I think it made it taste better.  The nutmeg smelled great as well while my slices were on the griddle.  Very easy and tasty.

Finally, I have found the french toast recipe I've been looking for! I used half of the nutmeg this recipe called for, used multigrain bread and dipped the bread in the egg mix fairly quickly, but I otherwise followed the directions. Hubby and 4-year-old made this french toast disappear with big smiles. Thanks so much for such a tasty breakfast!

I've made this twice now in the past month and my family of 4 just raves about it. I make it exactly as is and afterwards i top w/warm canned peach pie filling and whip topping. We love it and it will definitly be a 'special' breakfast as my kids call it.

Worked out great, made them for Mother's Day.  Following recipe for me, yielded 10 pieces instead of 12....  but I soaked them pretty well before putting them onthe skillet ;)  Did not have nutmeg, so i used just under a tablespoon of Vanilla Extract.  An 8 yr old, 10 year old, 12 yr old, and a mom loved them!

Made some french toast with probably twice the ingredients in it that came out pretty good. Tried this small recipe and was easly better than the other. The Brown Sugar sets it so far past the others I've had

I was looking for a simple french toast recipe that was a little different from my own. Now when I was mixing it at first I thought that it was calling for too much nutmeg but went with it anyways and it turns out that it was a lovely combination. I will use again when looking for a nice alternative to my homemade pancakes for my big weekend breakfasts that I do for my family. Not time consuming at all.

It was alright, i wasn't very pleased with this recipe, i found it really mushy, i would recomend putting it back in the oven after 45 minutes for about 5-10 min. or even better put it on broil for a nice and crispy top

This was EXCELLENT!  I did not have nutmeg, so I used Pumpkin Pie Spice.  I would highly recommend using a blender to combine the ingredients.  THESE WERE FLUFFY AND GOOD!

Really good, and really easy!  My 11 year old made this pretty much on her own!  This is a keeper!

This recipe is very good. I didn't following the recipe all the way! I made my own sauce that taste like bananas and apples( with other mixtures). I did put blueberries in the mixture. I put the pan in low heat so I wouldn't burn it( it may take a while). My mixture was not soggy like the others users. I didn't leave the bread for so long. Maybe try that!!!! GREAT RECIPE!!!

This was okay.  I followed the directions but it only made 6 pieces because it depends on how long you saturate the bread.  Also the nutmeg is overwhelming.  If I make this again then I will defintely use less nutmeg.

This was really good!  I did change it slightly.  I used half and half, and instead of nutmeg I used 1/2 teaspoon apple pie spice.  I also used cinnamon raisin bread.  This turned out great!  My kids want to have this every Saturday.  Thanks for sharing!

I got 15 peices of toast from this recipe...it was really good, too. I didn't add as much nutmeg as called for-instead added a bit more brown sugar. Turned out great. Definetly recommend this recipe.
