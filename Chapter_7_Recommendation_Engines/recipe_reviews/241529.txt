I was happy to find a recipe that didn't use whey protein powder, since I didn't feel like ordering a specialty ingredient.  I made a few substitutions because I didn't have some things on hand.  I used almonds instead of the hazelnuts.  I also did not have the wheat germ, so I substituted half oat bran and half ground flaxseed for that.  I am quite pleased with the result.

These are very tasty and easy to make.  I added m&m and used chunky peanut butter to add texture.

I couldnâ€™t bring myself to use all the nuts, peanut butter and honey, so I subbed 3/4 of unsweetened apple sauce, 1/4 cup of almond milk for the honey. I only used 1/2 cup of peanut butter. Also added 1 1/2 cups of chocolate whey protein isolate and 1/2 cup 70% dark chocolate chips.
