My husband and I loved this recipe!  This is the first time I make it and decided to read all reviews to decide what adjustments I would make.  It was a good idea, because my bread came out perfectly—rounded dome, thin crunchy browned crust and a wonderfully soft firm textured bread that was easy to slice (even very thin).  I mixed it up in my much loved Kitchen Aid mixer and baked it at 350 for 45min.  Here are the adjustments I made:
Proofed 1 pkg. active yeast in ½ cup warm water mixed with 1 tbl sugar.
Reduced buttermilk to 1 cup (actually, 1 tbl. Apple cider vinegar + milk to make 1 cup) let sit for at least 15 min. then added the baking soda.
Mixed flours with salt and took out 1 cup
Added buttermilk substitute and yeast mixture to dry ingredients in mixer and added the reserved 1 cup flour slowly.  Mixture was very sticky, so I added ½ cup white flour and even though it was still a bit sticky, left it like that.  Put dough in oiled bowl.  Turned on oven for 1 min—turned off and put bowl covered loosely with plastic wrap in for 1 hr.  Punched down and rolled into rectangle and rolled up tightly into log.  Placed into greased bread pan and let rise in oven again for 1hr.; baked for 45min. Perfection!!  Don’t be tempted to add more flour—will produce crumbly or dry bread.

Fantastic recipe.  I have made it twice within a week.  I am not the bread eater in the family, my wife is, and she doesn't want me to stop making it.  It raises nicely, is very moist, and isn't heavy and compact like most whole wheat breads.  I have done it both times completly in my bread maker which is one of the less expensive ones.  I did follow a couple of the other reviewers advise.  Use bread flour and not all purpose. Added almost another cup of whole wheat flour than the recipe calls for. I never have buttermilk so added 1 Tablespoon apple cider vinegar to regular milk and mixed the baking soda, oil, and honey with it.  Put that in the bread maker first.  I also mix the whole wheat flour, the bread flour, and salt in a bowl to combine well before dumping it in the bread maker on top of the liquid ingredients.  Put a pat of butter in each corner of the bread pan.  Set bread maker to basic/specialty setting with a crust color set for medium.  You couldn't ask for a nicer loaf of bread.  Will be making this often.

Great texture, great taste. I use an Oster bread machine; therefore, I did use white bread flour and added 1/3 cup more whole wheat flour than called for in recipe, cause I thought it was a bit too moist at kneading.
Used "White" and "Rapid" "Medium Crust" settings.  For those having problems I might suggest that you add the baking soda directly to the buttermilk as you measure it as opposed to adding it with the dry ingredients.

I make bread for the entire neighborhood and have been looking for a great whole wheat bread.  This is it!!  I agree that it makes an enormous loaf so I'd reduce the buttermilk to 1 c. and the soda as well.  For those who had failures, are you using bread flour?  It's critical to use bread flour with a high protein content to get a good rise in any bread.  Compare protein content between brands.  In the Midwest, Dakota Maid bread flour is the best.  Hope this helps.

Oh man, I was disappointed with this recipe!  After seeing the high ratings I was really excited to find a great whole wheat bread recipe, but I guess I should have READ the reviews, and taken the advice of adding more flour from the start!  My dough was more like batter, which made it really hard to get out of the breadmaker and into my loaf pan!  The flavor was okay, but "nothing to write home about" as my father would put it.  I expected a really rich wheaty, honey flavor.  I ended up throwing out the rest of the loaf after dinner.

I tried this twice: once exactly as the recipe specified, and once adding more flour. It cam eout extemely heavy both times- and this come from someone who is used to whole wheat breads.
I was rather disappointed, and couldn't understand how this rated so high with so many reviewers. It doesn't come close to melting in your mouth.

EXCELLENT!!! I make bread about 3-4 times a week and like to try new recipes. I'm so glad I found this one!! Soooo moist and tasty!! I never have buttermilk on hand so all my bread machine recipes that call for buttermilk I just use 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar in the milk and it works super!! Thanks for this recipe my picky kids even loved it!! Yum! A definite keeper!!!

Yum, soooooo good!!  I hardly ever have buttermilk around (what?!  and i call myself a baker...), so I used milk and mixed in two tbsp of yogurt for the tang.  It worked wonderfully, and the bread is lovely.  (It's good with sunflower seeds mixed in, too.)

Tt's easy to make this bread in my bread machine, but I often take it out for the second rising and bake it in a loaf pan.  My kids love it.

Thought it was okay but nothing special.  I did follow previous reviews and added another cup of flour.  Used breadmaker to knead and then divided into two loaves and baked in oven for exact baking time listed in recipe.

My husband just ate 4 pieces of this bread and I had two.  It was excellent, I must say.  I added a bit more honey and more WW flour.  I used the "hook" on my kitchen aide mixer to knead the dough, it was so easy.  The house smells DEEE-LI-CIOUS....hope you like it as much as we did.

Brilliantbrilliantbrilliant!!! Tastes specatular and it's easy as pie to make (well, EASIER, to be honest). Can't ask for more!! I don't buy bread at the store anymore!

I've never been able to get bread to bake properly in my bread machine - I think because it rises the yeast too long so the whole thing collapes. I was getting frustrated, and then I tried this recipe. Using the bread machine to mix and rise the dough is brilliant because it's the part I hate the most, and the most time consuming. I stick all the ingredients in the machine and ignore it for an hour and a half. The only work I have to do is to pull it out of the bread machine, put it in a pan, rise it again and then turn on the oven. I heat my oven for a second or two and then stick the loaf in there to rise. When it's double in size, I just turn on the oven. I can do all manner of other kitchen stuff while this is baking!

Thankyouthankyouthankyou! I love this recipe!!.

This is a very nice bread!  I read the reviews 1st and instead of adding flour, I reduced the buttermilk to 1 cup.  Perfect!!  Last time I made it I added 1/2 cup 7 grain cereal.  Lovely.

Excellent flavor and texture.  The top of my loaf sunk, so it didn't look too pretty.  Will try to figure out what went wrong and try again because the bread was delicious!

I'm not an expert bread maker, but have made plenty and this is the first I've had problems with. First there is too much buttermilk or too little flour. You'll have to add about an extra cup just to make a dough consistency, otherwise it's more like a muffin batter. Second, it did not rise very well the second time. Third, After baking for the full time and cooling on the rack it looked beautiful, but them the dome collapsed overnight. The bread had more of a soggy muffin type texture. Very strange. I think it need  more whole wheat flour for the gluten. Maybe someone could do 1/2 wheat and half all purpose to give it the spring it needs. As for me I will not be using this recipe again.

I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone but an experienced bread baker.  After reading the reviews and seeing so many comment on the ratio of liquid to dry ingredients being off, I decided to make this with my Kitchenaid mixer so that I could control this.  I ended up adding at least an additional 1/2 cup of flour till the dough seemed a good consistency.  It appeared all was well until after the 2nd rise when just before placing it in the oven, the dough collapsed.  I reshaped it and let it rise a 3rd time and it baked up fine.  There are so many other recipes out there the yield a better result that I wouldn't go with this one again.

My husband and my 4 year old liked this recipe better than other wheat breads I've tried, it has a lighter texture and the buttermilk and honey give great flavor.  A new favorite!
According to one of the notes, I made one and a half recipes for 2 loaves, and they were small enough that I will just double it next time.  I don't see any danger of overflowing the pan;  I used one packet of yeast, not the measured amount, and think this would be fine for 2 loaves.  Still raised fine.

An addendum to my previous five (5) star rating of this recipe. I forgot to mention that I cut the amount of yeast from 2-1/2 teaspoons to one (1). Big improvement! When I used two (2) teaspoons (never used the 2-1/2), the loaf kind of looked like a popover in the pan! In addition to the yeast and flour adjustments (1-1/2 cups all-purpose, 3/4 cup whole wheat, 3/4 cup spelt), I also changed the oil from vegetable to extra light-tasting olive oil, which is the ONLY baking/cooking oil I use anymore. LTB!! (LOVE THIS BREAD!!)

Thankfully I used the dough cycle on my machine, otherwise the ingredients would've have been wasted. I kneaded in at LEAST an extra cup of whole wheat flour after I saw that the dough was soupy. Tasted great though - after I improvised for the recipe's mistakes.

I don’t have a bread machine but made this recipe with the same ingredient amounts.  I proofed 1 pkg of yeast with warmed-up the buttermilk, which I made using 1 Tbsp of vinegar and the rest fat-free milk for 10 minutes. Next, I add all the wet ingredients to the milk mixture. Then, I mixed the dry mixtures into my mixer and poured the milk mixture and mixed using the paddle attachment. Next, I used the hook attachment and ‘kneed’ for 4 minutes.  Took out the dough and hand-kneed with a little flour and placed in an oiled bowl and let rise for 1 hour. Punch down and shaped into 12 balls. Placed the 12 pieces into a 13x9 glass pan and let rise for another hour. Baked at the recommended, 25 minutes at 350 degrees.

This bread was moist and tender. It tasted great with or without butter. The left-over bread was stored in the refrigerator, wrapped in aluminum foil and then in plastic wrap. The next day, it was still moist and tender and I didn’t even have to toast or heat it.  I will make again and again! DH couldn’t believe it was wheat bread!

Yummy bread! I did mix the yeast with sugar and warm water  15 minutes before putting the ingredients into my breadmaker. And I also did the whole thing in the breadmaker - I used the Wheat Bread setting with light crust (Oster breadmaker). The bread did collapse (which my 4-year-old thought was hysterical!) but it was still absolutely delicious! One of the best breads I've had and I'll definitely make it again. Next time I'll try baking it in the oven to see the difference.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent texture and flavor!  I used an additional cup of white bread flour, and for extra flavor added 1 tsp. butter flavoring.  Use the clear color - purchased in the cake decorating section of groceries or craft stores.  I processed it on the dough cycle of my bread machine, formed 2 smaller loaves and let rise in bread pans.

This bread had a great texture and a good taste, but with my machine, the loaf came out VERY dark.  I'll try the recipe again, but with a lighter setting.

Just had to throw in my two cents worth. I tried it with sour-milk (regular milk and lemon juice) and it turned out great! I WILL be making this again. I used a bread machine, and with the other reviews, I also added an extra 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour. Worked out great!

I loved this bread!  I has a great texture and flavor.  I am definitely making this again.  However, I thought the instructions were rather poor.  Technique seems to mean everything for bread.  I used the dough hook on my Kitchenaid and not a bread maker as the recipe seems to suggest to mix and knead the dough.  After all the ingredients were added, it was more the consistency of cake batter than bread dough.  So, I added nearly another full cup of whole wheat flour.  But it still turned out fabulous.  My husband loved it.  So much better than store bought and nearly as easy.

Great bread recipe...BUT, I use in our bread maker machine and using the amounts exactly as stated in the recipe...the bread rises up and out over the top and up to the canopy over the breadmaker!...I use one package of yeast  (which is 1/4 tsp less than the recipe calls for)...I question the 1/2 tsp of baking soda ingredient, since it rises so much anyway. By the way, this recipe also appears on other websites with the same ingredients, must be popular, huh?

So moist and wonderful!  Would be 5 stars with a little more explanation on adding flour to the correct consistency.  Keep in mind that with any bread recipe you have to add flour to correct bread dough consistency...that day it took probably about 3/4 cup more.

The only ingredient I changed was using bread flour in place of all purpose.  I mixed it in my Kitchenaid and did the last rise in my bread pan in the fridge overnight so I could bake it in the morning.  Perfect!

This is the recipe I've been looking for -- the crust is soft, the texture is hearty, the flavor is perfect. I don't keep buttermilk on hand so I substituted 1 1/2 Cups whole milk w/1 tbsp. apple cider vinegar. The aroma of this bread cooking is delicious! I love it right out of the oven with some butter slathered on! Makes great sandwiches, too. Awesome recipe!

What a wonderful bread recipe! After I started adding the ingredients to my bread machine I realized I was out of whole wheat flour and ended up using plain bread machine four. Also I came up a tiny bit short on the buttermilk and added 1 1/2 tablespoons water to equal the correct amount. Even with all that the bread came out perfect! It's great for sandwiches too! Picky husband said "wow, this is good bread!" Thanks so much for the recipe!

really like this recipe. have made several times-- works well every time. :) I do NOT use a bread machine, though... instead I only use 1 c milk, and use the other 1/2 cup liquid as water-- to mix with the yeast at the very beginning (put the vinegar and milk together in a separate bowl). I also use 2 c. all-purpose flour, and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour and 1/2 c. Ultragrain flour. too much wheat flour gives breads an almost bitter taste, in my opinion. Wonderful base recipe. Thanks!

Great bread ! Recipe can be used with honey or molasses and still turn out wonderful; Beware though I find this recipe requires 3/4 to 1 cup more flour than the original recipe suggests. A good stand by bread in our house. Best warm, with a cold glass of milk.

Delicious...does need more flour; I add 1/2 C more of wh. wheat. I also add 1 TBLS of vital wheat gluten. I have made it totally in the machine which was good. My preference is to use the dough cycle, put it in my bread pan, let it rise and then bake it in the oven for 25-30min. at 350 degrees.

Great little loaf!! I did not use a bread machine, just a kitchen aid.  I let it rise for 1 hour then shaped it.  Let it rise again 30 min. and baked 30 minutes at 350.  So good!!!

Wonderful bread recipe.  I bake for the public and this is the recipe I use perfect every time!  I of course multiply the recipe and never have had trouble with it.  I am an old fashioned type baker.. no bread machines here.  Is easy to work with by hand the old fashioned way.

This is a very nice loaf. The only change I make is to use melted butter (not margerine) in place of the oil. I use my bread machine set on basic/medium, and it comes out with a nice crust. For those who mentioned it as more batter like or too soft a dough, this is common in all bread making. Depending on the temperature, moisture in the air and moisture content of your flour, the dough will have a slightly different consistency each time you make it. For this reason, always check your dough after a couple of minutes of kneading in the bread machine, adding more flour if needed until the dough is soft but not too sticky and pulls away from the sides of the pan. Add just a small amount of flour at a time as this bread does well with a soft dough and too much flour will make it heavy.

This bread is awesome! I can change it around and use more whole wheat flour and it is still wonderful. I let it raise in my bread machine and then take it out and shape it in a round loaf on my pizza paddle and cover with a cloth. After it is risen I slash the top. While it is raising I preheat my oven with a pizza stone and then after my stone is good and hot I slide it onto my stone to cook and it always turns out well.

This bread is awesome!  My husband says it's the best bread I've made so far.  It has a nice taste, and is slightly moist but still holds up to being sliced.  I will make this again and again.  I did the whole thing in the bread machine.

I have been trying many bread recipes in search of something to replace my store bought bread...this is it! I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I used bread flour. I just let my bread machine do all the work including the mixing of the ingredients. I used the basic, large loaf, and light crust settings. My husband had to have a slice of it while it was cooling on a wire rack, and I forgot to cover it that night. The next morning the bread was still as soft as when it was done baking! It makes great sandwich bread and toast, definately my favorite recipe by far! I will never buy bread from the store again, thanks for this recipe!!!

Wow, this was good! Like another reviewer, I proofed the yeast first in 1/2C wm water and cut the buttermilk to 1C. I mixed in my KitchenAid and cooked it in the oven. My kids loved it, my roommate loved it, and so did I. I have a penchant for "birdseed bread" as my friends call it, so next time, I'm going to add sunflower seeds, poppy seeds and wheat berries and see what happens :)

The amount of flour is way off in this recipe and I had to add so much more that I ended up with two 1lb loaves.  But it tastes so good that I don't mind having the extra loaf at all.  The buttermilk really brings out the sweetness of honey.

Am I the only one who wasn't all that pleased? It worked out just fine, breadmaker first, then out into bread pan, rose for over an hour, and baked as directed.. no problem, BUT, I don't know, too sweet? different texture? Perhaps it's the individual taste buds, right? But thanks, might be good as stuffing mixed with cornbread and pumpernickel.. sweeten the flavour of the stuffed bird!

This is such a great bread.  Instead of buttermilk I used powered buttermilk and it worked great I could not tell the difference. I make this all the time at least 2 times a week.

If you think this bread is good after it cools, then try it straight out of the oven. It is absolutely DELICIOUS!!! My sister and I could of eaten the whole loaf right there. It was absolutely wonderful!!! I will DEFINITELY make it again --- but not too often, because I will eat it all!!!!!!!

Great tasting bread, very light and not heavy at all.  We used the dough setting on our bread machine and finished baking it in the oven. My 10 year old loved it and he "hates" wheat bread.  It didn't last one day in our house.  Will use this recipe again.

I loved this bread! I mixed it in my bread machine but baked it in a loaf pan as directed. I did find that it needed a bit more flour. It tasted delicious!

A great recipe.  Loved the flavor of this bread.  Had a terrible time with the dough though.  The bread was so sticky and it was like liquid than solid.  Even after the first proof it was so moist instead of forming it into a loaf, I had to actually pour it into the pan.  It resulted in a very moist loaf though with a consistency more like an english muffin bread.

great bread.  For those that don't have liquid buttermilk on hand, they now carry it in a dry form in canisters...usually found around the baking mixes.  Just mix it up with some water, and violla...buttermilk

Pretty looking, no. Really, really tasty? Heck yeah! I made this from beginning to end with my Kitchen Aid mixer. I warmed the buttermilk just enough with the honey mixed in so I could proof the yeast. After I got everything mixed in, this DID need more flour to get it to jump on the hook. I didn't measure exact, but I would say it was almost a cup. This dough was SUPER sticky so I took care to grease my bowl real well before setting it to rise on my stove, covered. This took some time to double, then double again after I formed it into a loaf. This was exact on baking time and temp. I swear, this is one of the best breads I've ever made. No leftovers! And I have to say that it has THE best crust I've ever tasted on homemade bread. This one's a keeper.

The only ingredient change that I made was to use 1/2 cup of water and reduce the buttermilk to 1 cup, just so I could proof the yeast. I made this by hand, so I proofed the yeast in 1/2 cup of warm water w/ 1 T. of sugar. I didn't really have trouble with the dough being too wet to handle, however, when it came out of the oven, it was slightly doughy in the center =( I'm willing to give this one another try because it tasted great without being too sweet, but I will make 2 loaves instead of one--hopefully they'll cook all the way through! Thanks.

I made eight large breadsticks out of this and they turned out perfectly.  I'm picky about my wheat bread as I grew up on grocery store white, but this was wonderful.  I could easily eat this everyday.  Oh, and I had to "make" buttermilk by adding 1 1/2 T vinegar to the milk, but everything else was to the letter.  Thank you!!

I am making this recipe for the first time, chiefly because I had some buttermilk that needed to be used up. I am an experienced baker from scratch, and I intended to bake it in the oven in a loaf pan. I am used to "tweaking" recipes, but I didn't add more flour to the mixture, even though it seemed very soupy. It has been sitting for the first rising for about 1 hour and 20 min. and it is rising a little, but I don't see how I can form it into a loaf. I have a bread machine, but I doubt very much if the results would be any different. I looked back to see if somebody had found out the original author had submitted the wrong amount of flour. I used good bread flour, not all-purpose, and good WW flour. I make two loaves of wheat sandwich every week (good for toast) and that uses 3 C. of WW flour and 3 1/3 C. of bread flour. This makes one loaf- shouldn't this call for about half that amount of flour in one loaf? I hate to think I wasted the ingredients, let alone the labor. I mixed it up in my Kitchen Aid too, as one of the other reviewers did. What is wrong here? If it doesn't do better in another half hour, I'll probably try a different recipe. You have a great site- but this recipe so far is a disappointment.

A good basic and moist wheat bread recipe. I followed another reviewer's directions and these are the changes I made:  let the yeast mix in 1/2 cup water (105 degrees) with 1 tbs sugar, reduced the buttermilk to 1 cup, added 1 tbs gluten (since I had it and it seems to make my wheat breads taste a bit better) and let it rise in the oven with the oven light on. I kneaded it in my kitchen aid with the dough hook for around 4 minutes before it overheated and gave off some wierd smell. But that aside, it was kneaded enough and then I let it rise.  It did rise slower then my other breads but it came out perfectly, dome shaped, and a nice brown crust.  I did bake it for 20 minutes at 350 degrees instead of 25 minutes.  It was very moist and tasty. Thanks to the OP.

Very good bread recipe!  Sliced very nice and had very good flavor, not sweet at all.  I made mine with 3 cups of whole wheat flour to make a "true" whole wheat bread.  Mine didn't collaspe, I used only 1 cup of buttermilk.  For my bread machine--for a 2 pound loaf you use 11/2 cups of liquid with 4 cups of flour and for a 11/2 pound loaf you use 1 cup of liquid and 3 cups of flour.  Next time will try and make with 2 cups of wheat and 1 cup of bread flour to see what I come up with and than try it with 1 cup of wheat and 2 cups of bread flour and see which way my family likes the best.  Good recipe to trinker with!  Thanks.

Y-U-M-M-Y!  This recipe came out just perfect.  I mixed the bread in the machine..Turned it out and kneaded about 5 times,  let it rise 40 mins(till double in size) and cooked  25 mins like the recipe stated and ohhhhhh was this good!  We ate our chicken salad on it for lunch.  No more store bought bread....Thanks for a sharing a great recipe :).

This is the best whole wheat bread I have ever made. I baked it in my Bread deMies pan, the one with the lid with holes, and it came out crustless and with the texture and shape of store bought bread, ready for sandwiches. The only variation is that I added 

1 Tablespoon of Gluten, 

to make it really spongy and fluffy.
Awesome bread!!!

Wonderful, delicious recipe! I didn't use a bread machine and proofed the yeast in 1/2 cup water + 1 tbl sugar. I also added 1 tsp sugar to the dry ingredients. The bread came out light, fluffy and fabulous.

I'd love to give this bread five stars, but I've tried it three times and each time it comes out with a cratered top.  I'm sure that is due to my lack of breadmaking experience; this recipe may not be written with the novice in mind.  Even though the loaves looked like a half-pipe, we ate them, and I liked the results enough to keep trying.  The texture and flavor were wonderful, and the bread sliced easily.  I will try the recipe a fourth time, decreasing the amount of buttermilk from 1 C by 2 T (I'm proofing the yeast in 1/2 C of water, so I decreased the buttermilk to begin with).  If this fixes the problem, I'll re-submit my review with detailed instructions, since I'm not the only person who has had trouble with the recipe as written.

I have never baked a loaf of bread in my life before this one.  I read the reviews and added some extra flour so it would not be sticky.  It turned out almost perfect and tastes great. I will make it again.

I read with interest the many posts on this recipe and decided to try it.  Delicious!  I did not find that I had to reduce the amount of buttermilk.  Perhaps because its winter and the flour is absorbing more liquid, or maybe its because I use King Arthur which is a high grade flour, but the little bit of flour I had left over after mixing, I used to work in while I hand kneeded the dough.  Love this recipe as does my whole family.  We will be making it alot!  Thank you

This is the first time I've ever made whole wheat bread and it is delicious! I don't have a ABM so I used my Cuisinart. First I mixed the dry ingredients together; then I combined the wet ingredients before slowly adding them to the machine.  I did have to add about 1/2 to 3/4 cup more white flour before the dough would release from the sides of the bowl.  Other than that I followed the recipe and obtained a perfect loaf of bread.  This recipe is a keeper.

Now THIS is a good bread recipe!!!!  I used the dough cycle in my bread machine and then set it in a loaf pan for a 2nd rise.  And then I forgot about it & when I remembered it, 3 hours had passed!  It had DEFINITELY doubled in size!  But then I baked it as instructed in my oven and it turned out SO YUMMY!!  I'll use this one again & again.

Not worth while to try. The bread didn't rise evenly. I followed the recipe as it is and baked in my breadmachine and turned out very disappointed.

I don't think you're actually *suppose* to bake this recipe in your bread machine.  Sure the machine would be good for kneading it but baking it does not turn it into a nice 'loaf' of bread.  Instead you'll get an uneven LUMP. It did taste ok so if you're going to go through the trouble to make it then I'd suggest oven baking it and hope for the best.  Most of the other reviews I've read here baked it in their ovens and seemed to enjoy it very much.

I need to know what size loaf this makes. 12 servings just doesn't tell me which size setting to use with my bread machine.

OUTSTANDING!!!! This recipe not only tastes great but could not be easier! I have made this both as directed and also just let it bake through in the breadmaker. Personally I prefer the breadmaker, probably because I have never been very good at breadmaking. I used bread flour for the all purpose. I did not have any trouble with wet dough, etc. This recipe produces a tasty loaf with a good texture. It slices well and doesn't tear. Thanks for sharing this recipe Tom, we love it. My only concern is going to be keeping myself from eating too much and not fitting in my clothes anymore!

This is a wonderful bread!!  It's only my husband and myself, but, since I first made it, I have to make a loaf every couple of days - my husband LOVES it for sandwiches.  I did have to add a bit more flour and was a little leery the first time because the dough was so wet, but the loaf turned out gorgeous with a fabulous crust!  I used 1 cup each; AP, WW and bread flours (just my personal preference). To all of you naysayers - Why do you cook? Personally, I cook for friends, family, myself and for the fun of it.  I love trying new recipes and ideas.  Some of you seem to feel that, if everything doesn't turn out perfectly according to the exact measurements and directions (no variations PLEASE!!), that the recipe is a flop and  you will never try it again.  I have one word of advice, people - Play With Your Food!!  I guarantee you will have a lot more fun in the kitchen.  Thanks for a great recipe, Tom!!

I made this with buttermilk powder and water in place of the buttermilk. I also used 2 rounded T of gluten. I found it to be too wet when I went to put it in a bread pan, so I added more flour. WOW, did it come out awesome. So, flavorful. My kids and my husband ate it up. We had it warm, but I just had a slice with butter the day after and it is still yummy. Great recipe.

This bread has a fine crumb, a soft crust, and a slight sweetness. I can taste a bit of tang from the buttermilk, but not much. It's very soft, and it has stayed soft for two days now. One problem--it didn't rise as high as I would have liked. All in all though, a very nice wheat bread. I think it would be possible to add more wheat flour and still get very good results.

This surely is a good bread... but it has nothing really special! I didn't taste neither buttermilk, nor honey there was in it... It misses that little extra that changes a breakfast into a gastronomical meal... Sorry

This was my second attempt at bread making and it came out wonderful. I didn't have a bread machine, so I mixed the ingredients myself and only had to add a small amount of flour which was picked up from my counter while kneading. However my dough was very, "thin" I guess you would say so I baked it in a 9x5" loaf pan at approximately 325 degrees for about 30 mins or until risen fully and lightly browned, then I turned up my heat to 350 to finish browning, and my fiance` and I ate the entire loaf with dinner. LOVED IT Thank you

I am extremely irritated and disappointed right now.  Has anyone managed to make this recipe work in a bread machine???  I just tried this recipe for the second time in the bread machine and it came out a disaster AGAIN.  
The bread collapsed in the machine the first time when I followed directions (what little of it for the bread machine) and put it on Basic cycle.  This second time I used bread flour instead of all purpose and chose Wheat cycle/Medium Crust.  Collapsed again.  
This recipe gets one * for easiness due to lack of specificity in the instructions for bread machine.  Will not make again... what a waste.

Texture and taste is very delicious.  I need to use more flour to knead it by hand.  Next time, I will use a little bit less buttermilk.

great recipe.  Instead of making loaves I used the dough to make rolls. I could not stop my son and husband  from eating the rolls as fast as I could take them out of the oven.  I froze what rolls I had left over.  I defrost them  in the microwave as I need them to go along with just about anything. Soup, salad, or any main dish.

Loved this bread! However I did not use all purpose flour, I used bread flour and it came out much more fluffy-ier, and had better taste. (Better compared to when I used the all purpose flour.) I also used Safflower oil instead of vegetable oil. Very delish! I make this bread once a week now!

The perfect bread for morning toast or sandwiches!  I make this bread twice a week.  Everyone in the family loves it.  The only changes I've made is I bake it on the rapid cycle in my machine which takes 2 hours instead of 4.  I also add and add'l 3/4 tsp of yeast and 40 mL of buttermilk per the manufacturer's instructions.  I set my crust to "dark" setting and size to XL.  OMG!  Baking it faster actually resulted in a more even loaf.  It rises perfectly everytime now as opposed to before when it was hit or miss.  And the crust it perfectly crispy even on the dark setting.  Thank you.

This bread is delicious ... but, based on the original recipe I can only justify 4 stars. The main reason is the amount of buttermilk to flour, and after reading several reviews, I decided to decrease from 1 1/2 cups to 1 cup of buttermilk. This worked out perfectly!! A nice even textured crumb with a slight taste of sweetness.

Awesome bread. I did proof the yeast with 1 tbs. Of sugar and 1/2 cup of warm water.  Let it sat for 15 min. Then added the baking soda as another reviewer reported. I then added the honey, oil, and 1 cup only of the butter milk. I added the liquid ingredients into the bread machine first, then added the mixed bread flour,wholewheatflour and salt on top of the liquid ingredients.  I used the dough cycle and then placed dough in bread pan. After rising. Then baked.  Really really good bread.  You can not purchase such a delicious bread!

Yes, this is a very sticky dough.  Make sure to lightly grease whatever pan you bake it in.  I don't have a bread machine, so my KA came to the rescue.  I was tempted to add more flour than what the recipe called for, but I didn't, and I'm glad I relied on my instinct.  The bread was soft, moist, and slightly sweet.  Just PHENOMENAL!!!  (Did I spell that right?!?)

This is a great recipe. I use it 2-3 times a week for kids' lunch sandwiches. I don't use a bread machine, just my Kitchen Aid mixer. I also use a buttermilk sub, 1 tbs lemon juice + milk to make 1 cup for each cup of buttermilk. I also reduce flour by 1/2 cup otherwise comes out just a bit too dry. I love the taste; other "honey" bread recipes still don't have that taste and are flat, but not this one. I should mention that I double the recipe to make two loaves; we never go through bread that fast with store-bought! :) And my kids don't waste sandwiches now...thanks for a great recipe!

i am new to bread baking but i am a very good baker so i decided to give this bread a go. i am very plesantly surprised. this bread is very light and tender and moist. i made the dough in my kitchenaid mixer and everything turned out perfect. the only thing i had to do was add about 1/2 cup flour because the dough was very wet. with that extra flour i still produced a very moist bread. it is perfect for toasting. as soon as it came out the oven my kids ate it with peanut butter and bananas on it. great way to incorporate whole grains into your kids diet.thanks for the easy no fail recipe.

Total newbie at this, so I follow recipes exactly. Had a problem with the top collapsing (too much yeast? should have used bread flour?), though taste/texture was great. Texture almost like a crumpet - quite chewy. I find all the advice, however good, to be confusing - so many options! Next time I'll go with one of the variations, if I find a few people agree with the changes. BTW - I used a machine, and just let it do its thing. Fun to learn, though, my previous cooking experience limited to PB&J sandwiches!!

I followed the suggestions by Pat V almost to a T except added 3 heaping Tbsps. of ground flax seed and only used 2 Tbsp. of honey. I was extremely skeptical at how sticky the dough was, but it turned out great! Don't be tempted to add any more than an extra 1/3 C. flour!!

I love this bread! I baked mine on the "normal 1 1/2 pound" setting on my machine. Used bread flour in place of all purpose and added about 1/4 cup more flour than the recipe called for. My only complaint is that the top of the loaf 'collapsed' on itself. I make bread in my bread machine about once a week and always have a nice round crown on top, but not with this recipe. Still though it tastest great, crunchy crust and chewy, dense interior makes for some good eating!

Very light for a wheat bread.  Normally my wheat breads come out very dense.  So this was a very pleasant change.  I did make some changes.  I sifted the flours together so that it wouldn't have that slightly gritty/grainy texture.  I used 1 tbl of melted butter and 1/2 tbl of vegetable oil.  And I added 1 tbl of gluten.  I'll definitely be trying this one again when I have leftover buttermilk.

I love this recipe, comes out great each time, though you do have to add a little extra flour because the dough is too sticky.  I have made it in loaves and as rolls, simply a great everyday bread.

This is THE BEST bread I have EVER made!  Super tender and a great balance of flavors too, with the regular flour, whole wheat flour, and a tad bit of honey.  Follow the recipe as written and it's great, but there is also so much you can do with it.  I shaped mine into a loaf, and after rising I slashed it three times accross.  Also, I brushed it with some milk to keep a soft crust, and it was great for sandwiches.  You could also  use water and get a similar result.  Immediently after baking, I brushed with melted butter (margarine actually) and it kept it soft, yet really shiny.  It looked like plastic bread, but I was amazed at how soft it was when I poked around at it!!!

Why does this recipe have baking soda?  I have never seen a yeast bread recipe with baking soda... so I completely omitted it. The bread came out wonderful.  I did end up adding about 1/4 cup flour to the recipe to get the dough to the consistancy that I'm used to.  I then just put it in my bread machine on the regular white setting, and the bread came out really well.  I made 2 loaves in my 2 bread machines.  I ran out of honey, so I used some Agave sweetener in place of the honey in one of the loaves.  The bread came out just as good with the Agave as with the honey.  I guess my suggestion is to add some flour and omit the unneeded baking soda.

My new favorite. My trusty, fall back, never fail bread recipe. I love trying new recipes, but this one has made it's mark. This is the one I use when company is coming, have to have bread and cannot afford to chance a new recipe not turning out. Everyone loves it.

Probably the best bread recipe I've tried so far (though I haven't tried that many). It was very good, especially when it was warm.   I brushed some melted butter and honey over the tops of the loaves (I made a bunch of tiny ones instead of one big one). I also don't have a bread machine so I just kneaded it by hand, plopped the loaves onto a greased cookie sheet, and baked them at 350 for about 25 minutes.   I made the mini-loaves as gifts for my friends but I'll definitely have to make some more for myself and my family very soon! This bread is delicious.

It was an okay bread.  Nothing special.  It is not worth five stars. A tip for others, follow the recipes EXACTLY!  DO NOT ADD MORE FLOUR!   I tried to do this, and ended up doubling the recipe because adding more flour made the dough too dry.

Very good, but the directions for baking are a bit off.  This bread is very crumbly.  I baked it for about 40-45 minutes in order to bake it completely.  I'm glad I made the dough in the breadmaker and then baked in the oven.  I have a good breadmaker, but I'm not sure how it would have done with this loaf.  I made my own buttermilk with lemon juice (1 tbsp per c of milk).  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a delicious bread. I never use a bread machine, just my two hands and my kitchenaid mixer, and this recipe was wonderful for both. Little sticky when you go to shape it, but don't be tempted to dry it out with too much flour...it cooks up nicely.

Really good.  I followed another reviewer's advice and proofed the yeast with a 1/2 cup of water and a little sugar.  I then reduced the buttermilk by 1/2 cup.  I did have to add a little bit more flour and it seemed really sticky but I let it rise, punched it down and baked it and it was great.  A few friends stopped over and they thought it was great.  I will definitely make this again.  This recipe is great alone or I bet it could be a really great base recipe too.  I bet you could add sunflower seeds, oatmeal, etc.

This is an excellent light wheat bread, I did have to down size the recipe to fit my 1 lb loaf bread machine, but it worked well and the taste was excellent.  My kids liked it and they usually only like white bread.  Make sure you check the dough ball during kneading, I had to add about 1/3 of a cup extra of flour to get to correct texture.  This will now be a Sunday regular menu items for our family.

First let me just say I have baked a lot of breads but for some reason I couldn't find a good wheat bread until now thanks so much for this recipe my bread is so soft and taste so so good I put some home made honey butter on my bread as soon as I took it out of the oven and talk about good and also I am so glade that I took a look at some of the other reviews because that also help me a lot thanks to you Pat V your were a big help to me. Can I also let some of you know it is so easy to make your own butter,butter milk by use heavy cream and your mixer if you get some heavy cream and put it in your mixer and let it do all the work your butter will be at the bottom of the mixer,your butter milk will be on top just put your butter milk in 1 jar and them put your butter in a blow with a top and your ready to go and the taste is so good. Give it a try I think you will love it. they have some butter recipe on this site that are real good. THANKS SO MUCH TERRY I WILL POST A PIC. OF MY BREAD PS. I DID ADD 2 TABLESPOONS MORE OF HONEY

This is excellent as is, but when I've made alterations it's wonderful too.  I make it in the bread machine, just reversing the order of ingredients from wet to dry and use the large loaf setting.
Very moist and delicious.  My family is spoiled now and only wants this recipe - thanks for sharing!

I must have done something wrong, because it was a soupy mess in my bread maker. I just did the dough part, with plans to put it in the bread pans and bake it in the oven (I don't like bread machine bread).  But when I went to get it out of the bread machine, I literally had to pour it out.  Very sticky. At the same time, I made the same recipe in a bowl by hand. That one turned out okay, so I'm not really sure why the one in the bread machine was so soupy. Maybe it just has to be made completely in the bread machine to do well.  I let it rise for over an hour in the pans and it didn't do real well there either, but maybe that's because I used cold buttermilk instead of at "room temp".  I've made easier recipes that turn out just as well, so I don't think I'll make this one again. It sounds like everyone else loves it, though, so it could have just been that I made a mistake somewhere along the line.

This bread was very tasty and the texture was perfect.  It didn't last in our household...I made it twice in a row.  So delicious.
Today I substituted 1 cup of oats for 1 cup of the all purpose flour and this bread still turned out perfectly soft and tasty.  This is my favourite bread recipe.

I was looking for a bread recipe using buttermilk and honey. I made this with my Kitchenaid, no bread machine, and had to add another cup of flour to keep it from being too sticky; so like some other reviewers, I would probably add only 1 cup buttermilk next time. This bread has a nice texture, and I think it will make great toast. I will make again but with other add-ins, such as sunflower seeds or flax seeds, and I might try molasses instead of honey.

Awesome!  I proofed the yeast in 1/2 cup water and only used 1 cup buttermilk.  I also put in 2 TBL ground flax seed and 1/2 cup seven-grain cereal (to still equal the same amount of total flour in recipe).  I made the dough under "dough" cycle in bread machine and then took it out and put in greased loaf pan and sprayed with olive oil and let rise in oven (warmed oven first, turned off heat then put the oven light on).  Once doubled, I sliced the top of the dough lengthwise and baked for about 30  minutes at 350 (until internal temp was about 200 degrees).  WOW - so fluffy and moist.  LOVED this recipe.  It is worth the extra effort of baking it in the oven - it didn't fall in the middle and the outside was nice and crispy.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I can't make bread. Really. My mother in law is Austrian and makes wonderful baked goods. I make stones. I was disappointed with this at first but when I let it sit for an hour, it turned out wonderful.

a delicious, lightly sweet bread. no problems in breadmaker, rose perfectly. proofed yeast in 1/2c water as others have. suggest using real mayo for sandwiches as a spread such as miracle whip is cloyingly sweet with this bread. will definitely use again.

We paid no attention to the reviews and just followed the recipe (but only because we didn't have time for some reason to read others' suggestions that night). I'm glad, too.  We've made two loaves following the original directions and they've been fantastic.  All we changed was to use bread machine yeast instead of active dry yeast.  Used real buttermilk.  Used whole wheat flour and all purpose flour.  May have technically used more than called for--we don't have measuring cups (at the moment) and so just used the tea cups for approximation.  Also, Roger insists that the yeast has to go first, and in the west "corner" of the pan.

Good taste, but it did collapse in the bread machine.  However, I would make again; really only the top caved in, so there was a gigantic air bubble that didn't LOOK pretty, but the bread TASTED great.  I used 2 tsp fast-rise yeast, which may have caused the problem.  Either that or this needs about 1/2 cup more flour than called for.  Worth trying, give it a go!  Oh, and to make fake buttermilk (which I used): Add 1 tbsp lemon juice or vinegar per 1 cup milk and let stand 10 minutes at room temperature.  And if your bread machine requires sizes as mine does, this makes a 1-1/2 lb loaf.  Used the 'sweet' setting.

I made this bread in my bread machine following the directions from my machine, and it turned out great!  I used low fat buttermilk and butter instead of oil, and white bread flour instead of the all purpose.  I used the light crust option, and it still got a little dark.  Other than that, fairly dense crumb, hearty texture, and I was able to slice it nice and thin.  I will definately be making this again.  I will try to go to half wheat flour next time.

This is one of the best bread recipes I have tried.  I added extra flour and got a very big loaf.  I baked it in my bread maker the first time, but am now trying it in the oven.  It did fall slightly, but was still a very tall loaf.  It was light and sliced well.

As usual, I added my own twist but this was great bread with great consistency. I make my bread by hand so the order of ingredients I had to change.  I added 1/8 cup water to mix with the yeast as my first step. I always substitute butter (real) in my bread recipes for the vegetable oil. I just added all the remaining ingredients and kneaded the bread as usual. I cooked it in two flour pots which is always a nice touch. It is also very good if herbs are added(ex. oregano, thyme, basil, parsley and fresh garlic.) I knead them in at the end.

This is the perfect wheat bread recipe I've been looking for. It's delicious, and it doesn't sit like a rock in my stomach. I was reluctant to use the bread machine my fiance gave me, but it really is a great time saver for my regular sandwich breads. This recipe is now at the top of the list; it even makes peanut butter and jelly seem gourmet. Thank you!

Followed the recipe as it was given originally.  Mixed in a bread machine and baked in an oven.  The dough had a nice consistency that was not to dry or to wet.  It started to stick a little to the bowl so I added a teaspoon of flour while mixing.  Let rise 2 hours then baked.  Bread had a nice hard crust, and was very tasty.  The wheat flour and honey were the dominant flavors.  The recipe as given made one average sized loaf.  Will make again.

This is a note to the person who wanted to know what size loaf this recipe makes- the loaf size is determined by the amount of flour used in the recipe.  That information should be listed in your manual.  To the person who complained that the loaf turned into nothing but a blob in her bread machine:  you need to check the dough in your machine.  You can add liquid or flour to achieve the correct consistency for your dough.

I made this bread exactly as given and it was very good except the crust was rather soft making it hard to slice.  Next, I customized the recipe for 36 servings (3 loaves) and substituted half the buttermilk with water for a firmer loaf with a crispier crust that held it's shape well and was very easy to cut.  I also used slightly smaller pans and made 4 loaves and baked in a hotter oven (375).

** Dough is SO runny if you make it as specified ** I would reduce buttermilk to 1 cup as previously suggested. I didn't realize that and had to add an additional 3/4 cup whole wheat flour. Turned out FAB!! Excellent chew and flavor. Will divide and make dinner rolls next time :)

I thought this was really a good whole wheat bread recipe, however I had to use much more flour than it calls for in order to get a decent dough.  Of course I wasn't using a bread machine though, so maybe that's why.  Overall, it is a reall tasty bread, my kids & husband love it!

This made a HUGE loaf of bread!  I used the dough feature on my bread machine and then finished in the oven. Did need to add a little extra flour to the knead cycle, it was a little to sticky. It was delicious right out of the oven!  This is now our favorite bread!

This is the best bread recipe I have ever worked with that contained WW flour!  I made it in my bread machine on the pound size loaf and it rose to a two pound size!  This wonderful bread has good texture and a nice crumb.  Super for sandwich making, toasted cheese.  Melts in your mouth.

My bread came out so light & fluffy!!  I was pleasantly surprised b/c I did mine in my bread machine & I was a little worried when it rose so high (touching the viewing window on the lid!).  I guess it was b/c of the baking soda, which I've never added before when baking in bread machine.  I did have to add more bread flour during the 1st kneading cycle b/c dough was very sticky.  Overall I am delighted so far!

I read other reviews and used only 1 cup buttermilk,  (not the 1.5 and the recipe calls for) and the bread came out perfect - great texture, crust, and taste.  The 4 stars is for the actual recipe.  Wish they'd change it to 1 cup buttermilk.

Made recipe as written in bread machine.  Used 1 c. whole wheat, 1 c. bread flour and 1 c. whole wheat pastry flour instead of 1c. whole wheat/2 c. all purpose flour. For bread machine, need to put in the liquids first, then the dry ingredients with yeast on top.  Came out perfect.  Sweet, nutty flavor.  Bread was light/soft/fluffy without a lot of holes. Filled up the bread machine to the top.  Will keep recipe and make again for sure!!!

Makes a beautiful, tall loaf in the bread machine.  Needs more flour to get it to form a ball.

YUMMY! I don't have a bread machine... I just mixed the dry and added the wet and used my kitchen aid mixer.  I was in a hurry so I microwaved the buttermilk to 120 degrees.  I used oat flour instead of whole wheat...I did have to add almost a cup of extra white flour but it was raining out so my air was extra moist.

Added 1/4 cup of wheat bran. Sprinkled the top with a little sea salt and brushed it with butter about 10 minutes before I took it out of the oven. Absolute perfection-the whole family loved it. The crust is not overly thick which is a big hit with my 6 year old.

I didn't have any problems yielding a fluffy bread.  I used bread flour and nonfat buttermilk.  I used my breadmaker, but I proofed the yeast in the buttermilk for 15 minutes while I prepped the other ingredients.  The little bit of honey offsets any tartness from the buttermilk but this is not a sweet bread.  My friends flipped for this bread.

End product was good but I was pretty worried during the process.  I used bread flour instead of AP, and I needed to add about another cup and it was still Sticky, almost like a batter.  The flavor was good so I let it rise for almost 2 hours before baking.  It never rose how I hoped, but the taste/texture were Great.  I'm wondering if my buttermilk was too cold?  I used my kitchen aid for the mixing.  Sliced it and served it with the ginger glazed mahi and greens as a sammich.  DH loved it.  UPDATE:  Made in bread maker like directions said, just added a TBSP of wheat gluten.  Perfection!  Sometimes I should just follow the recipe

AMAZING bread!  I have to admit I used a few hints from one of the other reviews, it turned out light and airy and full of flavor.  This may now be my bread of choice!  Thanks for sharing!!

This bread is delicious!  I added another 3/4 cup or so of flour (both wheat and white) because the dough was sticky.  I didn't use a bread machine, and just combined all ingredients and kneaded in a stand mixer for about 10 minutes. I let it rise for a little more than 1 hour, then baked for 25 mins.  It came out so moist, soft and sweet.  Just be sure to add a little extra flour.  Great recipe!!

Really good bread.  My daughter had it with a little butter for afternoon snack.  I would say next time I will cook on the light crust setting it was a little to brown.

The first time I made this, it was good, but not anything special. The second time, I cooked it just until it was starting to brown, and THEN it was really really good--especially with honey butter. Also, I made this without a bread machine, and it's important to not too much flour in. The first time I kept on adding until it was kneadable, but the second time I just added enough to work with it, but it was still sticky, and kind of a pain to try and knead, but it sure turned out good.

This is excellent & easy to make. I use the most helpful tip (in reviews) to create & bake accordingly. The only thing I changed was I used 2 cups of bread flour and 1 cup of all purpose. I've also used both buttermilk and it's substitute (milk with apple cider vinegar added) and both have turned out delicious. Thank you!

I used my bread machine to make this bread overnight.  Becaure of this I couldn't monitor the consistency of the dough.  The loaf came out really high (overflowing the pan) and very light/airy.  It does have a good flavor however so I am going to play around with it - less buttermilk maybe or more flour.  The taste is good enough it's worth the experimenting.  As written though I would only give it 2-3 stars.

I'm going to give this 4 stars even though my first attempt came out way too doughy.  I did use lowfat plain Kefir in place of the buttermilk, but I don't think that's why it was so doughy.  I used my bread machine to do the kneading and baked it in the oven.  The flavor was fantastic.  The next time I try this recipe (probably tomorrow becauase I HAVE to overcome failure) I will use less Kefir.

One of the best bread recipes.  If you like a sweeter bread, use dark honey; if not use a lighter honey.  I made 2 loaves and doubled everything except yeast, used 2 cups buttermilk and proofed the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water before adding the other ingrediants. I still added an extra cup white flour, but you could also add whole wheat.

I followed the recipe as far as the ingredients, but used the "manual" instructions listed by another reviewer, since I don't have a bread machine. This bread is wonderful!! I look forward to making this again, and hopefully will have a new mixer by that time, that will help with the dough!

Best wheat bread recipe I've had yet...
Used a bread machine...altered it to 1 c buttermilk the second time I made it and
didn't have to add extra flour because the dough was it was too sticky. Came out perfect the second time! I selected 1 1/2 lb on my bread machine.  I do wish the recipe stated the size loaf this should make...it would help the newcomers to the recipes.

this is a terrific loaf. very tender. I used my bread machine to knead and added wheat gluten to it.  I found the dough sticky but I just added more whole wheat flour .  I am new to making bread and this was my second recipe I tried.  I will make this again and again.

I'm just beginning to use my breadmaker and put this in just before church. I was a little concerned I would come home to a burnt mound but it came out beautifully. Everyone loved it! The buttermilk/honey/wheat combination was delicious! I will put this on my list of regulars!

This recipe kind of puzzled me.  I was expecting something fantastic based on the reviews, but I was a bit disappointed.  I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I used milk and lemon juice (adding 1 tbs of lemon juice to a cup of milk can be used as buttermilk substitution).  The bread fell in the middle, yet ran over the sides of the container and burned.  Once the bread was done and I cut away the burned part (why waste good bread?), it tasted ok.  But I couldn't taste the honey, and I had hoped it would have a touch of sweetness to it.  It just seemed like regular wheat bread.  It tasted fine, but seemed like a lot of extra ingredients for no result of extra flavor.  I would say I'll play around a bit with the honey and buttermilk, but because it fell in the middle I'm not really interested in trying again.

The bread came out from the oven looking and smelling like fresh bakery bread!  It has a sweet honey taste to it and my family loves it!  We had it with meatloaf and I thought it was too sweet to eat with something like that...but otherwise it's a winner!

In the end this is a great loaf of bread. After reading many other reviews, I decided to make a freeform/rustic loaf using the oven in an attempt to avoid the "cave in".  This is a VERY sticky dough and is difficult to work with. My first knead I used flour, but tried to add as little as I could get away with.  The next punchdown I used oil and the dough was still sticky.  I baked it on a stone in a preheated 400 degree oven for 30 minutes. When finished I had a very large loaf of soft moist bread. I will make this again.

This is the best of the four wheat bread recipes I've tried.  The buttermilk keeps the bread moist with a wonderful texture and the honey adds a touch of sweetness.  I followed the recipe exactly and made it in my machine on the wheat cycle.  This added another hour to the total bake time for a total of approximately 4 hrs. - 4 hrs. 15 mins.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Flavor was great!  I have made this recipe several times now and I always have to add more flour in or it is way too sticky.  I also usually get two small loaves out of it.  Only one time did it come out perfectly domed, it seems to just fall ever so slightly but it does not seem to affect the taste or texture.  I have also added in cracked wheat, and a 5 grain cereal to it for fun and it's been tasty!  Mine does seem to be a bit crumbly, not good for sandwhiches or slicing thin but eaten fresh, thick sliced, with butter and jam.

Delish!  Used all wheat flour and mixed with my Kitchenaid mixer.  I put 1/8 cup warm water with the yeast to proof first.  I ended up having to use more flour, but it came out wonderfully. :)

This bread was really easy to make and really tasty!!  My roommate and I both loved it!  I used bread flour instead of AP flour and it turned out great, although the top wasn't domed, it was sunk in a little bit.  This didn't affect the flavor though.

not wheaty enough for my husband's taste.  Since he eats the bread, I won't make this again.  On the plus side, it was easy to make(I made by hand).

Very easy to make and turns out great.  i don't have a bread machine so I mix every thing by hand.  Usually have to add extra flour so it is not sticky.

THis was very good, moist bread.  The flavor was excellent, but both loaves fell just a little in my bread machine. I love the subtle buttermilk taste.   I added a little more flour on the second loaf, about 1/8c.  Next time I'll try adding 1/4c or more.

Excellent. The texture was smooth and the flavor was delicious. My dough seemed really sticky for being bread dough, even with lots of kneading, but it turned out really really great. I suggest baking on a cooking stone or cookie sheet.

Not that great.  I did read the reviews and added an extra 1/2 c flour when the dough looked wet and wheat gluten because I don't keep bread flour in the house.  Bread rose well enough for me but was still kind of tough so will keep looking.

Moist,natural sweetness, even texture, and excellent flavor--a winner!  However, I did have to add 1/2 cup flour to ensure doughball shape in breadmaker set to dough setting.  Bread also oven-baked.

I tried this again and excellent. Still did dough in bread machine - punched down - let rest 10 mins in slightly oiled bowl - punched down again - shaped for a 9x5 pan and let rise for 1 hour. Misted top of dough with water and baked for 18 minutes on middle shelf, turned once. Perfect texture and flavour.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe! I I recomend adding 1/4 cup warm water to make the active dry yeast rise (the recipe donor may or may not have forgotten to add that). I added a tsp baking powder and a little extra sugar (to taste)... baked it in my oven for about 50 minutes and served hot and it was great!

i would definitely reduce the amount of buttermilk in this recipe, maybe by as much as 1/2 cup ... i had to add a lot more flour to get the dough to the right consistency. Although the flavor and texture of the bread was great right out of the oven, it didn't hold up the next day. toasting and buttering is definitely needed the morning after.

Very Yummy!  Exactly what I was looking for, a wheat bread that wasn't dense, but light and airy instead.  I am going to delete the other wheat bread recipes out of my box, so I don't get mixed up on the best one.  I used 1 cup of bread flour and 1 cup of all-purpose flour, in addition to the 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  I left mine in my bread machine, as done by another reviewer.  While everything came out good, it baked up and over the pan.  Next time, I will follow the directions more exact on the baking and such.  But still, a great tasting, light wheat bread and exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks Tom, for sharing your recipe.

I just got this bread out of the oven and it tastes wonderful.  It was a breeze to make too. I did it all by hand and due to suggestions that the buttermilk be reduced, I reduced mine to 1- 1/3C and the dough was just a mite dry. But it was really lovely to knead and due to the fact that I've always proofed my bread twice I did it with this one too, a first rise in a lightly oiled bowl and after punching down and shaping a second rise in the pan or free form as mine was. I also brushed it with an egg wash before baking. Nice and golden brown. Will be making this more often.

Tried this recipe this afternoon for tonights supper......excellent! After taking the pan out of the oven, I removed the loaf of bread from its pan and placed it on a cooling rack, where I then brushed melted butter over it. Waited for about 5 minutes, then had to have a slice of it! It cut great! Didn't tear at all. Will definately make again! Thanks for sharing!

As the reviews indicate it is quite a nice bread.  It also tolerates a fair degree of changes.  I cut down the buttermilk to 1 cup, and the oil to 1 tablespoon, but proofed my yeast in a half cup of warm water with a teaspoon of sugar.  It came out firm yet light with a nice crust.

This really is an excellent bread. Cut back some of the oil (which was minimal already, but oh well) and came out wonderfully. It's moist and crumbly..will make again. Repeatedly.

Mmmmm, Mmm!  I am a bread lover, but I'm picky.  This one was delicious!  The only problem was that it didn't bake long enough, and turned out a bit doughy in the middle.  Besides that, two thumbs up!

Bleah.  This recipe didn't work out.  Very disappointed.
