Made these cookies with my granddaughter after school today and we both loved them!  I didn't have cornflakes or raisins, so just omitted them.  We cut both the brown sugar and white sugar in half and the cookies were plenty sweet enough.

These were super easy and good.  I have never baked with coconut oil before--a not a big baker--and the taste was really nice.  They made the house smell divine.  The only thing I wasn't sure of was when I creamed the coconut oil and the sugar, some of the coconut oil was globby.  Just here and there; mixed it for a long time but finally just gave up with some globs here and there.  It didn't seem to affect the cookie. I also used an all purpose gluten free flour and with the strong sweet flavors of the cookie, the weird after taste in GF flour was completely gone.  Thanks for a nice easy recipe to satisfy my sweet craving.

I didn't have enough coconut oil, so added olive oil to finish out a cup.  Omitted the corn flakes,  as I didn't have any.  Instead of white sugar, I used Splenda, which I use instead of white sugar.  Used butterscotch and peanut butter chips, had no chocolate chips (bad, as I'm a chocolate fiend).  Found the the batter very thick, hard on beater, so tried by spatula, but scooped with cookie scoop.  They were too dry to stay together, but cooked anyway.  They were same colour, and tasty, but looked nasty, as they wouldn't stay together.  
If I makes these again, I am going to put them in mini cupcake pans.

Like other reviewers, we cut the sugar and were glad we did. We ended up putting 3/4 a cup of each instead. Otherwise it was awesome as written!

I used Craisins instead of raisins and added walnuts. Awesome chunky cookies.

These turned out amazing!!!  Only change I'd make next time is to decrease the sugar a bit - they are too sweet.  I didn't have cornflakes, and so just added another cup of oatmeal.  I also used part gluten-free flour.  They look and taste wonderful.  Will definitely be making these again.

I have never made cookies with coconut oil before, but these turned out well & are really good.  I did wind up rolling them into balls & flattening them a bit before I baked them because with all the add ins, they were a little hard to keep together just using a cookie scoop.  I also traded out the raisins for dried cranberries.  I will definitely be making these again.
