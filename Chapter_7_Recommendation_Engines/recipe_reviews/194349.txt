These are so GOOD!!!  My husband cant get enough of them.  He said they taste like Boston Creme pie only with a little more lemony flavor.  I will say making the daisy design on top of the cupcake is a total pain in the rear end so what I did was just melt some chocolate and take a fork, dip it in the chocolate and drizzle over the top.  Makes the cupcake look great and adds the chocolate flavor.  YUMMY!!

I would add just a touch of lemon zest to the icing/filling to give it just a little more lemony bite.
