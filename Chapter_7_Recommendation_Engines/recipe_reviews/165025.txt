Cook on low, not high.  I followed the recipe to the letter other than the slow cooker temperature setting and it came out wonderfully.  Four hours on low is plenty done.  I used a roux to make a sauce out of the mixture

I am soooo glad that so many of you you have enjoyed this recipe! It makes me laugh, though, every time someone "discovers" that it's better cooked on low--that's how I submitted the recipe :) I'm not sure what happened in translation. I just read a review where the cook used a pork shoulder roast--I'm gonna have to try that less-expensive version, 'cuz Lord knows I can't buy tenderloin all of the time! Thanks to you all for trying, saving & reviewing my recipe...I have enjoyed sharing your reviews with my husband, who always asks, "Why can't you just make plain 'ole meat?" Ha! Where's the fun in that???

SOOOO YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!

I don't brown for as long as they said too. ? I also heard from another reviewer that the juices didn't absorb as well...but then I break all the meat apart and make it like pulled pork.

I like a lot of sauce so I double or triple what's above because I like the sauce to be all around the meat while it's cooking. Or at least half way up the tenderloins. I do constantly spoon the liquid over, but you don't have too - esp if you make more liquid. I really go heavy on the teriyaki sauce! Basically, I used a large mixing bowl and filled it about half way full of stuff!

Cooking time - I was in a hurry the other day, so I cooked on high for three hours, maybe longer - just long enough to where when I took my fork I could tell the meat would shred easily. Then I removed about half of the liquid, and then shredded the meat. I did end up putting some of it back it, cuz like I said, I like sauce and I used enough to coat the meat + a little more. Then I cooked it on low for about an hour - but not too much longer as the meat is SOOO tender by this point. I have cooked it on low for the full 8 hours too, but still waiting to shred the meat until the last hour or so.

Ingredient alterations - the first time I used this, I used honey teriyaki, but just got regular stuff this time, and added 1/4 cup of honey. Also, I don't use fresh red chile pepper but will add touch of red pepper and some creole seasoning. The BEST is Tony Chacherie's original Creole Seasoning

This recipe is very good.  I made it a few times for office parties and other pot luck parties because I get requests to bring them.  What I love most about this dish is it is so easy to make.  I just put the entire recipe in the slow cooker, set the time and it's ready in a few hours.  I cook mine LOW for 8 hours just to make sure it's really soft and tender.  I brown the pork if I have time but there are a few times where I didn't brown the pork and can honestly say, I can't tell the difference.  Also, when I bring this dish to any gathering I buy a least expensive cut of pork or what is on sale and I cubed the pork, about 1/2 an inch or less, so I don't have to slice it and it's easier for people to eat.  ***And if I want to bring want to bring up the recipe to a notch, you can add 1 sprig of fresh oregano, 1 bay leaf, and 2 star anise.  ***And if I want to influence the dish with my Asian heritage, I add 1-1/2 tablespoon salted black beans (tausi).

Excellent!  I made a few minor chages. Instead of red chili pepers I used a couple of drops of Red Hot Sauce. I also cooked it on LOW for 4 hours instead of on high.  I thickened the sauce to serve with the meat. My family loved it!

My fiancee looooves anything smothered in teriyaki sauce and he loves pork tenderloin, so this was perfect!  I substituted ground red pepper for the red chile peppers (as I'm not wild about spicy food anyway) and the result was divine!  He loved the flavor and it was soooo juicy!  We'll definately do this again!  Maybe next time we'll throw some red potatoes and carrots in to cook with it.

This was delicious and very flavorful, but another reviewer said to cook it on low and I will try this next time because the meat fell apart when I tried to slice it.  The aroma while it cooked was fantastic and it was very tasty.  Either a cheaper cut of meat or cook on low next time, though.

Another fantastic slow cooker recipe for pork tenderloin.  Made as written with the exception of the red chile peppers. I didn't have any on hand so used approximately 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes. Added plenty of kick for our taste.  Next attempt, I will reduce the cooking time. Most of the tenderloin did not slice well and actually crumbled.  It was still lovely and moist, but not the presentation that I prefer. Thanks for the great recipe, StayHomeCook.

I followed the recipe pretty close with the exception of the chopped red chile pepper, which I did not have. I used a couple teaspoons of red chile paste and that added enough heat for us. This was tasty--paired well with my Cold Sesame Noodles. I wished the sauce was thicker, next time I'll add a little cornstarch into a bit of the chicken broth and stir that in before serving.

This was great!  Everyone (including kids) wanted seconds!  I ran out of teriyaki sauce and had to concoct my own with brown sugar, soy sauce and red wine vinegar. . .but it was still great! I didn't brown it first (didn't have time) I'm sure the color would have been much prettier if I had. I doubled the liquid part to give more juice for cooking and I used red pepper flakes (about 1/2 tsp). 4 hours on low was plenty of time for my whole pork loin (used loin cause it was cheaper than tenderloin). I added 3 cups of rice and some frozen broccoli to the slow cooker with 30 minutes left on the timer -- that was AWESOME! I'll definitely do that again.

This turned out great for me. I had to make my own Teriyaki sauce so it was gluten-free.  I also added quick rice at the end so it would soak up the juices. The pork came out very tender, and we like sweet teriyaki so we skipped the chilies and added honey instead. We will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe!  Very tender and tasty.  I served with rice and some steamed broccoli.  Trader Joe's didn't have any red chile peppers, so I didn't add any and it still tasted good.  I also put in less than half the amount of brown sugar, as I didn't want it too sweet (and teriyaki sauce is sweet as it is.)  It turned out great!   Next time I'll try to add some chiles or at least some red pepper flakes, as I like a little kick.

Really juicy and flavorful.  I cooked it for a good 5 hours in the crock pot and it was very tender without falling apart.  I thickened up some of the juice to use as a gravy. Yum!

Dry, dry, dry.  Maybe if the liquid completely covered the meat it wouldn't have been so dry.  Or if I cooked it on low for 6 hours instead of on high for 3.5 hours.  I put some of the liquid in a pot on the stove with some added sugar and cooked it down to make a sauce.  That part was good.

Rating is with these modifications:  Added 2 tsps jar ginger. Two Green Jalapeno instead of red peppers. Added 1/8 tsp Asian Sriracha Hui Chili Sauce (use sparingly if you don't like spicy food).  Doubled the teriyaki sauce in recipe. I used a smart Hamilton Beach slow cooker with probe set at 160 degrees on LOW [it turns itself to Warm setting when done]. Approx cook time was 2.5 hrs for slice-tender meat. Thickened sauce in pan w/flour on stove top. Served w/white rice w/almond slivers & parsley and steamed broccoli spears. Husband and I give it an A+.

This recipe turned out pretty good.I did not brown the tenderloins, I just put  them in slow cooker and covered them with the sauce. I didn't add the red chile pepper, since I didn't have any on hand. The sauce had a really nice flavour, but I added a little cornstarch at the end to thicken it up. The pork was a little bit dry. Next time I think I will cook it on low.

This recipe has a very good flavor. I love the convenience of the slow cooker, but I'm so close to giving up on using it anything but chili or stews because I don't like the texture of the meat when it's cooked this way. This recipe changed my mind for now.  But, if you want the meat to turn out more like it was roasted in the oven, you should take care NOT to over cook it. I used a two pound pork loin roast and it would have been perfect after just 4 hours on low (I cooked it for nearly 6 hours on low). Also, I use the "smart pot" which I think cooks hotter than other slow cookers. Hope this helps anyone, like me, who was ready to ditch the slow cooker.  Thanks for the tasty recipe.

great recipe. Reduced to 3 servings; omitted chile peppers, used Splenda brown sugar blend on hand, added 1T fresh minced ginger. Cooked on high for 3 hours. Added 2c fresh pineapple chunks and switched pot to low, cooked with the lid off for ~1/2 hr to thicken the sauce. Served over wild rice. I'll use this recipe again and hope to also rework it into a quick stove top recipe for leftover pork roast.

Really yummy, quick and easy prep. I used a tip suggested by another reviewer and substituted 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes for the chile pepper. It was just the right combination of sweet and spicy in my opinion.

I hate to be one of the lone dissenters here, but this recipe confirmed for me that the slow cooker is not the way to go with pork tenderloin. I prepare tenderloin often but this was only the second (and last) time I'll use the crock for it. All the flavor, juiciness and tenderness I usually get was gone. The meat was dry and very hard to slice. I ended up shredding the majority of it. I made a 'gravy' out of the sauce to top the meat and that helped. Sorry, just not for us I guess.

This is such a wonderful meal.....I'm making it for the second time as I speak. I find it's really easy to dry meat out in the crock pot so I highly suggest cooking on LOW NOT HIGH for the 4 hours. It just comes out perfect!  Thanks for a great dinner!!!!

I really enjoyed this very easy recipe. The terriyaki flavor is not overly strong. I was hoping that my husband, who is not a fan of terriyaki sauce, would like this but alas he didn't. He's been super picky lately so he doesn't get a vote. Ha-ha! I used 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes in place of the peppers as we don't care for things very spicy. My son who stopped by had to try it and he really liked it. He would have loved it with more pepper flakes or the peppers as he likes things spicy. I cooked it about 8 hours on low only because dinner was delayed but it probably would have been nicely done in 6. It was still wonderful at 8 hours however. I thickened the liquid in the slow-cooker with a cornstarch and cold water slurry and my son enjoyed it over the pork. I would definitely recommend this recipe. Wish I could make it again but I have to find things that Mr. Picky would like. Thanks for a great recipe StayHomeCook

I didn't have red chile pepper or the onion but I made it anyway. I cooked it on low for 6.5 hours and it turned out perfect and moist!  It smelled great after a long day of shopping.    I used a can of chicken broth, half a can of teriyaki sauce and a half a cup of brown sugar.  I then added some of the gravy to a sauce pan  and thickened it with cold water and cornstarch.  It was EASY and AWESOME :)

MY ENTIRE FAMILY LOVES THIS!  Here are some changes I made for the second time: more garlic, more pepper, cut the brown sugar in half, and added 1/2 tsp of salt.  This will give it a more tangy flavor.  If you prefer super sweet, stick with the original recipe.  SOOOO good!

I don't know what I could have done different as I followed the recipe to a 'T.' It was horrible. The sauce was runny and I even tried to thicken with cornstarch. It had no flavor at all. It was fork tender after cooking on high for 4 hours but what a waste on a nice pork tenderloin. Hubby ended up eating a frozen tv dinner and me and the kids had cereal :(

Great receipe as is, I added red peppers instead of chili peppers, and added 2 heaping tablespoons of our farm honey. I usually don't like to mess with people's receipies, however after reading a few other reviews I just asded honey and switched the peppers. Other then that, this was awesome and there were zero leftovers. House smelled awesome for hours while cooking this on a sub zero January day! Make it, you will love it!!!

We loved this pork recipe! Even my extremely picky 12 year old son could not get enough of the melt in your mouth pork:). I used the two 1 pound Teriyaki pork Tenderloins. I did not brown them before cooking. I used half of the chicken broth and almost 1/2 cup of Teriyaki sauce as my boyfriend bought the garlic one. I used 1/2 can of a Guinness Beer. Put small round potatoes and carrots in the bottom, then the 2 pork tenderloins. I mixed the onion, a med green, red and yellow pepper and 1/4 jalapeño pepper chopped fine in the sauce and poured over the pork, then 3 garlic cloves minced. I prepared it the night before, let it sit in the refrigerator overnight and turned it on in the morning on low for 6 hours and went to work. My crockpot turns to warm after the time is up. When I arrived home, it was perfectly cooked and delicious!! We will be having this again!!

I'm sorry, but I didn't care for this recipe.  I made it exactly as written and I agree with some of the other reviews that it made the tenderloin dry and it was lacking in flavor.  I won't be making this recipe again.

I threw it together before leaving the house so I'm not sure if my measurements were exact. Skipped the chili pepper entirely but followed the rest hurriedly. Wasn't expecting anything THIS good! Everyone loved it including my very picky kids! Just plain yummy and really easy.

I thought this recipe was the best.The only change I made was I used a pork loin roast instead of tenderloins and just added a few dashes of hot sauce instead of red chili peepers.As far as I am concerned this is a six star recipe.

Excellent and EASY!  I did 1.5 times the sauce for my recipe and increased the garlic.  I also used crushed red peppers vs fresh red chili peppers.  Served over jasmine rice.  Wonderful!  My pot cooks hot so I cooked this on high for 1 hour and low for 2 and it was fall apart moist.  Probably my favorite crockpot pork tenderloin recipe.

The flavor is out of this world! I too used red pepper flakes as it was what I had on hand. This is a definate keeper! OH, and I had the asian coconut rice from this site on the side and topped it with the "sauce" that the prok cooked in. Perfect meal!

I may have overcooked mine because it just fell apart as we pulled it out of the crockpot. More like pulled pork than anything else. I omitted the red chile pepper and used 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes instead. I cooked this on Low for about 6-7 hours, probably about an hour too long. Served with jasmine rice cooked in chicken broth and steamed broccoli. Family liked it.

This was very tasty and tender. I substituted red pepper flakes for the red chile peppers and doubled the sauce. I also thickened with cornstarch before serving. Served it with coconut basmati rice and fresh roasted broccoli. My whole family loved this recipe.

I'm not a big pork tenderloin lover, but this is was delicious. I made it exactly like the recipe called for but added mushrooms and onions. We made pork sandwiches with the leftovers. Yum Yum.

I'm afraid I didn't have much luck with this. It was very dry. Maybe I should have looked at reviews and cooked on low instead. My Plain Jane daughter thought it was not very flavorful   Oh well on to other things.

Great recipe!!! I also cooked mine on low instead of high.  Also I used 2 Tbs of red chili paste instead on the fresh chilies and it turned out great.  I did thicken the sauce with cornstarch and served over rice.  Will definitely be making this again!

This was delicious and so tender! I didn't have teriyaki sauce, so I used low sodium soy sauce in its place. After I mixed the sauce up, I poured it into the pan that I had browned the meat in, scraping the juicy bits of meat into the sauce for added flavor. I cooked it for about 3 hours on "simmer" (my cooker's setting). At the end, the sauce was thin since I hadn't used teriyaki, so I added a mixture of 1 T cornstarch and water to the sauce and brought it to a boil to thicken to a glaze. My family devoured both tenderloins, and there was still about a cup of sauce left, so I plan to use it later in the week on some baked chicken breasts. Yummy!

It was excellent. I would have given it 5 stars but the sauce was still so watery after being in the slow cooker for many hours. I had to add a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch (mixed with a little cold water first of course) and boil for another 30 minutes or so before it would thicken. Delicious taste!

My family and I enjoyed this okay although we didn't *love* it. I think a similar result could have been obtained with a less expensive cut of meat, and the tenderloins could've been saved for a nice BBQ or oven roast. As other reviewers suggested, I cooked it on "low" for 4 hours and made double the sauce so that the meat would be well covered in the slow cooker. I saved the sauce that was left over and used it as a marinade for some nice steaks a few days later, which turned out well.

I gave this five stars as it came out amazing! The pork was perfect and the sauce was so delicious. I did use some habanero peppers because we like it burn your face off spicy, other than that followed the recipe exactly and really enjoyed it. A keeper for sure!

This was unbeliveable!  I was lazy and didn't brown the meat in oil first - didn't miss a thing!  I left off the chile peppers (just a personal preference). I cooked it on Low for 4 hours - perfect!  After it finished cooking, I drained the juice into a saucepan, and added some cornstarch to it to thicken it.  Wonderful sauce!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is wonderful. I cooked it my dutch oven on the stove on med for 3.5ish hours. 1 tsp of chili paste and doubled the rest of the sauce. Served over jasmine rice with green onion on top. Peas and carrots as side.

Yuuuuuuuum.  This is going in my regular rotation.  Easy and delicious!  I served it over coconut rice and I strained the juices and thickened with cornstarch on the stove.  Sprinkled with peanuts.

I made this for a dinner party and it was such a hit that I had no left overs! The crock pot is great b/c it doesn't heat up the house, so it was a win/win. I too used about a tbs of red pepper flakes, and it gave it just the right amount of kick. I served it on a bed of white rice, and spooned the juices on top of it.

This was very tender and had a nice blend of flavors, although I would have liked a little more spice.  I put the tenderloin in the crock pot frozen and let it defrost/cook for several hours without any seasoning. I never browned it. Then I followed the recipe with the exception of using a gluten free teriyaki sauce, a few drops of tabasco sauce instead of the chile pepper, as others had suggested, and a few slices of sweet peppers.  I cut the tenderloin into chunks and finished it on low for about 3 hours (it may have been ready sooner, but I got busy).  It held its form and did not fall apart.  I think next time I'll add a few more drops of Tabasco.

Didn't brown the tenderloin, just put it in the slow cooker and poured the sauce over it. Didn't turn it during cooking as that slows down the cooking because you are lifting the lid. I used 1 T. Thai Red Chili Paste instead of the chile pepper, but next time will add more as I think it needed more heat. I mixed 1 T to 1/4 cup cold water and added it to the drippings and cooked on the stove top until thick and used it for gravy. It was wonderful!

This was very good. When I first tried it, it was really spicy so then I add a tad bit more brown sugar and the heat was gone and it ended being sweeter than I would have liked. I cooked on love for 8 hours (due to working) and when I tried to slice it, it fell apart and was pulled pork. (Which was fine by me). I think next time I will keep the heat, spice! I also thickened the sauce up which I would suggest all do, it was a lot better and really stayed on the meat.

Excellent recipe as is.  I used crushed red chili peppers (about 1/2  tsp.) in place of the red chili's.  Searing is a must, I even marinated it after searing for a couple of hours.  Came out great, able to slice it and also pull some.  Thanks, I will definitely be making this again.

My family loved this recipe....even my critical teenager. lol  I used a pork shoulder roast since that is what was in the freezer, skipped the oil and added a tsp of crushed red pepper flakes.   I used more of everything else to compensate for the size of the roast and slow cooked it on high.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome.  It was juicy and had a nice flavor.  Leftovers are not popular in our house, but this one made the cut.  Really good the next day as sandwiches. :)

Excellent! Next time would cook for 3 and a half hours on low, take out and slice, then put back in sauce for a bit. Used 1tsp of red pepper flakes instead of real chillies.

I just made this today and it was phenomenal! I made just 1lb of pork tenderloin, and I bought one that was already marinated in teriyaki sauce. I made the entire recipe for the sauce and substituted the red chiles for a sprinkling of red pepper flakes. I cooked it 4 hours on high and it was incredibly juicy and tender! I also added a bag of stir fry veggies at the end and served it with white rice. Loved it! Thanks!

I skipped the crockpot and did this in my dutch oven.  I used all the same ingredients. Browned the pork as directed then tossed in the onions, chili peppers and garlic. Saute for another minute or so then added the sauce.  Cover and baked in the oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  That might have been a bit too long as the pork was a tad bit dry.  But it tasted WONDERFUL and the sauce over rice was delicious.  Fabulous recipe that I will make again for sure.

This was pretty good.  I used a frozen tenderloin but let it thaw just enough to get it out of the packaging, then browned it on all sides (what a mess it made of my stove top).  I doubled the sauce and put the frozen tenderloin on Low for 6 hours and it was definitely done.  Couldn't slice it because it wanted to shred.  The sauce was good too.

This was good, but definitely needs to be cooked on LOW!  Meat fell apart.  Since my grocery didn't have a good selection of pork loins, I opted for a rib eye pork roast which was very good prepared this way.

Tried it for the first time tonight. I live in a small town in the sticks and couldn't find the fresh chili peppers anywhere, so I substituted with  a 7 0z. can of green chili peppers and half fresh diced jalapeno. I had a 6 hungry kids around so I shredded the 3 lbs of pork and put it back into the pot. Poured it all over white rice and it kicked a**. Next time I will add more jalapeno.

This is the best thing I have ever made! The pork was so tender it just fell apart. Easy recipe with great flavor, I did not use the chile pepper and would back off on the sugar next time and at least double the onions.  The onions turned out awesome, nice and caramelized. Every bit got ate in my household and that usually doesn't happen when I cook!  ***Do not cook on high, I cooked on low for 4-5 hours. And I only browned the pork for about 5 minutes.

An excellent recipe.  4 hrs. on low was ample time in the slow cooker. I doubled the liquid and substituted an Asian chili paste for chilis. Added carrots to the mix.  At the end, I strained the liquid and used it to create a thick mushroom gravy.  Made rice and broccoli and smothered the pork tenderloin, broccoli and rice in mushroom gravy!  The food was soooo good!

I substituted chili powder for red peppers and added a little juice from a jar of jalapenos. I laid a layer of carrots and celery under the unsliced pork loin and cooked on low for 8 hours, then pulled it apart with tongs. It was amazing, tender, juicy, and flavorful without being "spicy!"

Temp was way off. I cooked on low for 3 hrs 45 min and it was very dry. Too expensive a piece of meat to put in the crock pot, that was my fault. Gravy was good after making roux. Glad I didn't brown the pork or it would have been done in 2 hrs. My tenderloin was 1lbs 8.5 oz.

Hubbie and 5 year old both gave this a big thumbs up.  I used a pork sirloin roast and did not brown the meat prior to putting in the slow cooker.  I rubbed the meat with the minced garlic and black pepper.  Also used low sodium teriyaki at the suggestion of other reviewers and used 1 tbsp. of roasted red chili paste instead of the fresh chili peppers as I didn't have any.  Not spicy at all but great flavor.  Served with fried rice and Asian veggies.  This one is a keeper.

I thought this was delicious! I read the reviews and cooked it on low for about 9 hours. I did not brown the tenderloins. I actually put everything in the crock pot the night before and put it in the fridge to marinate. It fell apart when I stuck my knife in it. I would definitely make it again!

4 stars because the cooking temp is off... 4 hours on LOW is plenty, my tenderloins were actually done in about 3.5 hours. Also, they didn't take 10 minutes to brown, only 5 minutes at most. Very tasty and simple recipe that everyone enjoyed, and I'll make it again.  I love ginger, so added a few shakes to the teriyaki/broth mixture which worked well.  Spooned some juice from the crock pot over the sliced meat before serving... delicious!

I made this tonight. It was so full of flavor and very tender.  Made two by cutting pork loin in half.  Best to make on weekend when you have more time for prep work anf four hours to cook.

Take this up a notch and let the pork cook on low/slow for 5-6 hours shredding the pork around 5 hours and letting it cook the last hour in the sauce. OMG!! Over some white rice this was an awesome dish and the house smelled AMAZING!!

I've made this a few times now, even my three year old eats it. I don't bother with the onions and the garlic, and add a few squirts of Sriracha in place of the chiles. I only cook one 1 lb tenderloin on high for 2 hours. When the meat's finished I pour out the sauce into a pan, boil it, and whisk in some Wondra to create a nice thick teriyaki gravy. I usually serve cous cous and a green salad on the side. Thanks for this recipe!

This was absolutely incredible. By far the best recipe I've found here so far. The only thing I did differently was I seared the tenderloin over the searing burner on the gas grill. It made a perfect crust. My husband couldn't get enough. He did wish that I had made more sauce to go with it, so perhaps next time I'll double the sauce recipe and serve with white rice.

Easy to make, meat was super tender but the sauce, however lacked in flavor. If it wasn't for the chillies it wouldn't have had any at all, perhaps that's why everyone keeps saying their kids love this recipe....I doubt I'll make it again.

I thought this was O.K., not really great value for money if you are cooking on a budget, you won't have much by way of leftovers. My husband thought the teriyaki flavour was overpowering, but I kind of thought that's how it would taste. Too much for my kids though, they would not eat it :(

This recipe is very easy and turns out great. The meat tastes wonderful and is super tender. I seared it on the grill. Used chili sauce instead of the red chili pepper. The sauce is sweet with a bit of heat. Very nice.

So good. Loved it. Didn't pan fry the pork, so I didn't need olive oil. I doubled the teriyaki, added a whole onion and skipped the chiles. Extra sauce was wonderful. Pork was succulent!

This is a really good, however I doubled the sauce recipe and added stir fry vegetables and served with rice.  I didn't brown the meat before I put it in the crock pot.

This recipe is amazing.  It is my go-to anytime for anything.  I play with the pepper:brown sugar ratio depending on who is eating.  I throw it in on high for 5 hours or low for 8, and it always turns out well.  I add carrots, towards the end, and they really soak up the flavor.  Always a hit.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

This recipe was definitely easy, but the meat was dry and didn't absorb much of the flavor. The sauce was also very runny. If I make it again, I'll take the advice from other readers and thicken the sauce into a gravy.

Excellent only change made was use 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper instead of red pepper as recommended in recipe. Excellent meal served with 
Jasmine rice.

This was AWESOME!!!  I used twice the teriyaki (homemade) and added 4X the mount of broth...except used vegetable broth b/c I discovered I was out of chicken broth.  Left in the the crock pot on low all day (about 10 hours), shredded the pork, mixed it with rice and veggies, and basically made it a soup.

I thought this was rather good.  Like another reviewer mentioned, I cooked on low, rather than high, for about 4 hours and my tenderloin was plenty done.  The "sauce" was really just straight liquid and while I did pour it over the meat after I sliced it, in the future I'd probably opt to thicken it with a roux and give it more of a sauce consistency.  As it was, it was more like an au jus.  But still, flavor was good.

This was excellent!  I used a beef roast instead of pork loin because I already had it on hand.  A few minutes before serving, I added some fresh broccoli to the crockpot and let it steam.  We served it over brown rice and called it beef and broccoli.  Will definitely use this again, the sauce was very flavorful.

This was very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, except cooked it on low for about 8 hours. There was no way I could slice the meat since it was falling apart when I lifted it out of the slow cooker (which isn't a bad thing). It was just a little too spicy for my taste, so I'll probably use just one pepper the next time. I also thought the sauce would be thicker (mine was very runny) so I'll thicken it up with flour or cornstarch after I take the meat out the next time I make it.

It was wonderful!  The pork was so flavorful and the juice made a terrific gravy.  It did fall apart so it really ended up being like pulled pork, but that was just fine.  The 4 hours on low was the right amount of cooking time.  We will definitely make this again.

Very yummy! I added a whole sliced onion and a few dashes of cayenne pepper. I also added additional minced onion and garlic powder in addition to the fresh garlic for extra flavor. (I served it with steamed broccoli and egg noodles with butter, salt, pepper, fresh parsley, garlic powder and grated cheese.) I will make again!

I changed this recipe a bit. I used a 5lb prk tndrln and doubled the ingredients. I used more teriyaki than called for (LaChoy Teriyaki). Added ground ginger for more kick, left out the peppers and added 1 cup of OJ. Added the onions and baby carrots halfway through cooking. Took extra liquid in pot and made gravy with cornstarch. Cooked in crockpot for 5 hours. Served with steamed white rice and egg rolls. THIS TURNED OUT FANTASTIC!!!!

I made a homemade teriyaki sauce, and this turned out great.  I cooked it a little longer because I confess that it wasn't totally thawed.  And, I didn't brown it.

I added a can of pineapple chunks (or crushed pineapple)  and used whole mini sweet peppers (they’re red yellow and orange and come in a bag) I didn’t  add the spicy pepper but  used minced garlic. . Second time I’ve made it.  Serve it with rice.

I left it in a little too long, so it was a little dry, but otherwise very tasty.  Next time I will pull it after 4 hours on low.

I've made this recipe several times since finding it here on allrecipes.  It is very easy to make and flavorful and tasty. 
 I do add salt to it though to balance the sweetness.  Because the sauce is too runny for me after it's all cooked,  I make a gravy using the liquid from the cooked dish and then put it back in with the rest of the pork for a thicker sauce.  Yummy.

This was so easy and tasty! Will definitely be making this one again! I doubled the sauce ingredients, so the pork tenderloins were covered in the slow cooker, making it not necessary to have to turn the tenderloins to ensure even cooking. This sauce would also be great with other meats, I'm thinking chicken thighs or boneless chicken breasts, especially.

I cooked them on high for 2 1/2hours,  turning them half way through the cooking time.  I then shredded the pork and returned to the slow cooker on low (maybe 30 minutes or so). I made sandwiches with toasted buns and provolone cheese.

Tender  and tasty, but needs to be served with sauce. Mine turned out a bit dry if eaten by itself.

Delicious, excellent! My husband loved it (and he is not fan of pork) I followed the instructions to a T and as the recipe said, I used the low heat setting in my crockpot and cooked it for 4 hrs... The result was this amazing, juicy, tenderloin. Loved it!

It was very tasty.  I doubled the sauce, cut the pork tenderloin into four long pieces, and sliced it when done to put back into the sauce to simmer to avoid the dryness of the meat cut.  Served it with white rice and carrots and broccoli.  Delicious!

Absolutely delicious!! It reminds me of teriyaki chicken from a Japanese restaurant. Next time I’m going to try cut up breaded chicken and thicken the sauce with white rice??.

This pork tenderloin turned out delicious!  It wasn't dry at all.  I used about 3/8 of a teaspoon of red pepper flakes because I didn't have any red chili peppers and I used chopped onion instead of sliced because I already had chopped onion in the frig.  I cooked the tenderloin on low for about 4 hours turning it about every 30 minutes.  I made a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce a little while letting the tenderloin rest before slicing.  I served it with plain jasmine rice and stir-fry vegetables.  It was a big hit!  I will be making this again.

For personal preference, I used more teriyaki than recommended because I prefer to have meat very juicy and flavor absorbing. I cooked mine on low as well because high just seemed like a bit much. I didn't have peppers so i used a few drops of hot sauce, Also chopped up some red potatoes and added them in, made a great and flavorful meal.

I used pork cubes, rather than a whole pork loin and also added chopped red/green/yellow peppers and fresh pineapple chunks for extra color and flavor.  With the pork cubes, you can scoop right out of the pot and serve over rice.  It was great!!

This is so good, I am making it for the second time this week.  I did not have the peppers, so I added some Pineapple & Habenero  Relish, so good! Today, I am out of that, so trying it with a Red Pepper & Onion relish. Can't wait! 
The only thing different for me, is to double the onions. They are so yummy with the pork and the sauce.

All I can say is Wow!!! This was delicious and needed no changes whatsoever. The only thing I did differently was to cook it on low for 8 hrs since I was going to be out for the day. Thanks so much for sharing this easy and flavorful recipe. At our house we call this type of recipe "a keeper"

We loved this recipe!! After reading some suggestions, I eliminated the brown sugar and used pepper flakes instead of the fresh chili peppers. The first thing my husband asked when he got home from work was "What smells SO good?". I made twice the teriyaki sauce so I have plenty left over for tomorrow. Next time I'll thicken it slightly, but otherwise it is close to perfect. (And yes - use the LOW setting on the crockpot.)

I got a new slow cooker and was anxious to try it out so I went with this recipe first. Boyfriend is a huge fan of all things Teriyaki so there you go. I made this recipe to spec; I didn't change a thing. I was a bit disappointed to find that the meat, although very tender, was pretty dry. I'm not sure what I did wrong so I'll try this another time with some suggested changes in other reviews. Boyfriend liked it, though, and asked that I save the leftovers for him. Served with Jasmine rice and fresh broccoli. It was a great meal, shame about the dry-ish meat, though. Thank you for sharing.

Super easy! I didn't have any fresh garlic, onions, or red chili peppers, but I substituted them all with dry spices and it still turned out delicious. Plus, I didn't measure anything. I just guestimated. :)

Yummy, flavorful, and very easy to make!

Thought the teriyaki flavor might be too strong but everything mellowed out perfectly. I have a smaller, rectangular non-stick slow cooker so browned the meat in that on the stove top then transferred the pan to the slow cooker base. Cooked up quickly on #3 (3-4 hr), meat fell apart. I dumped 8 oz of sliced baby portabellas on top a half hour before serving just because I had them on hand. Saved me cooking them up separately. Served over jasmine rice. Nice!

It was an ok recipe though the leftovers didn't keep too well. I'd suggest making it when you have enough people to eat it all in one go.

I'm sooooo happy that it makes you laugh every time someone dries out an expensive piece of meat like pork tenderloin because they followed your recipe to the letter, as it written, in the directions. Pretty expensive "discovery". The mistake is yours or whoever edited the recipe. In either case you should have said " soooooo sorry" your pork was dry, I submitted 4 hours on low. Not put 'discovers' in quotation marks. It was offensive! 
I gave the recipe 5 stars because the flavor was good and because I cooked it on low heat so it was moist.

I didn't brown first. I doubled the juice and just poured over the tenderloin. I cooked on low for about 4 hours and it was perfect! I made a roulx and took almost all of the juice and made a nice sauce. I sautéed some broccoli and put the sauce over that too! I also took someone else's suggestion and used red pepper flakes instead of chiles. Super YUMMY!!!!

We loved this, though I did make some changes.  I had boneless pork sirloin chops for starters.  And I totally forgot to put it in the slow cooker before leaving for work.  So, when I got home, I quickly browned the chops while I whipped up the sauce.  I doubled the sauce, using 1 1/2 cups teriyaki sauce and 1 1/2 cups chicken broth.  I also had about 1/2 cup of pineapple juice to use up, so I added that too.  I used six garlic cloves.  I didn't have any red chiles so I used a good healthy squirt of sriracha sauce.  Poured that over the chops, brought it to a boil and turned it down to simmer, covered, for about an hour.  I did flip and rotate the meat several times.  After an hour, I took the chops out and then thickened the sauce with a cornstarch and water slurry.  Served with rice and a vegetable.  We loved it!

Love the flavor of the sauce! I didn't have fresh red chiles, so I used red chili flakes instead. I rubbed about 1 tablespoon of the flakes onto the pork before placing into the crockpot (no, I didn't braze the pork). I used the juices of the pork instead of chicken broth. I used a whole bottle of teriyaki sauce. I removed the pork after 4 hours, reduced the crockpot to "heat" and added carrots, onions, and green peppers to the juice. I let the veggies simmer for another hour before returning meat and simmering for another 10 minutes. I served the meat mixture over brown heirloom rice, and dinner turned out perfect!

This was awesome. Definitely cook on low. Perfect for an 8 hour work day! Added just a little soy sauce and 3/4 cup of table wine (red or white zinfendel this time)and there was plenty of sauce. Substituted crushed red pepper and some chili pepper sauce for the sliced chiles, because I couldn't find them anywhere.

This has become a staple in our house. I don't bother browning them, I just put them in the crockpot, mix up the other ingredients and pour it over them. First time I made it, I used a peppercorn tenderloin(the marinated ones are always on sale and add to the flavor) and it was yummy, but hot, a very sweet heat. So I started using other flavors like teriyaki and/or garlic herb, and cut the red pepper flakes in half- It's still sooo yummy. I make this at least 2x a month. Make with butter herb rice and then thicken some of the juice into a glaze, and YUM.

Great flavor. I cooked tenderloin on low for 4 hrs then shredded it and cooked one more hour on high. I did double the sauce as others suggested even with one tenderloin the sauce was just enough.

Made it without the onions cause I hate onions, used red pepper flakes instead of red chilies . Doubled recipe to cover pork and pork was so tender it melted in your mouth. Took sauce and put it on stove with some corn starch to thicken it up for gravy to use on pork. Was so awesome, everyone loved it. I did inject the pork tenderloins with apple juice to make tender. I thought it works for my pulled pork, why not. It sliced great and could cut it with a fork. Great recipe and ill be using it again. Thank you

BF LOVED this dish! Kept telling me this was the best tenderloin I had ever cooked! Followed master recipe except for the peppers, which I didn't have. Substituted dried peppers/pepper flakes because we like it spicy. Pork was cooked in 5 hours at LOW. Let meat rest and - per reviews - thickened sauce with a bit of cornstarch. Also added a can of baby corns and bamboo shoots to sauce at this point (water chestnuts would have worked as well). Steamed some broccoli and fresh green beans. Layered meat, broccoli, and beans over rice and spooned sauce over all. Yummy!

I was about to come on earlier while this was still cooking and review it (with a not so good review) I'm glad I waited. I ended up letting the tenderloin cook until I could make pulled pork out of it.I took the pork out and poured the contents of crock pot into a pan, made a slurry and made it into a gravy. I served this with broccoli on rice and then put the gravy over the top. It actually has quite a nice taste. The only thing I did different was used a little more broth and added about a cup of water later on. Also, didn't use the chilies, just some red pepper flakes.

Oh this was so yummy! I used a pork roast instead of tenderloin and cooked it for about 5 1/2 hours on low. I had to use green chilis instead of red and it turned out fine. Will definitely make this again!

I didn't read the reviews ahead of time like I usually do, so I followed the recipe to a T, and realized that the author had posted a correction that it should have been cooked on low instead of high.  Oops!  I cooked for about 3 hours on high, and then switched to low for the last hour when I noticed it.  It cooked nicely anyway, and sliced well.  It would shred well if you wanted to do that too, but I kept them in slices for the most part.  The sauce was quite tasty, but next time, I think I will add even more onions.  Thanks for the recipe. :)

I thought it cooked a little too long on high, so I cut down the time and temp.  It turned out well.  I left out the onions and peppers simply because I didn't have any on hand so I added some chili powder instead.

Oh my Gosh! GREAT pork roast, possibly the best I've ever made. I made the sauce the day before and refrigerated it, covered, without the meat in it. I substituted Ancho Chili Pepper powder (about 1 tsp) for the fresh red chilis, some dried red onion instead of a whole fresh onion (we're not much on onions in my family and they stink up the house) and I did not brown the roast first. Cooked it in the crock pot for about 9 hours on low, flipping it over the last hour or so. Let it sit on a plate in some of the juice for about 10 minutes before I sliced it with the electric knife (where has that wonderful thing been all my life?). Served with fresh French Bread, a nice salad and Garlic Rosemary Roasted potatoes. Normally my pork roasts are dry, but this one wasn't. And the sauce was super yummy with an Asian flair. Will make this one again, for sure!

Awesome and easy!  I make this all the time!  With some slight simplifications- it’s even easier!  Definitely cook on Low for 4 hours.  Instead of chicken broth, I add a can of gravy, right to The teriyaki sauce and sugar mix.  It makes the sauce thick and glazey  without any extra steps.  Sometimes I brown the meat, sometimes I don’t.  I honestly can’t tell the difference.  I serve over egg noodles or with rice.  The kids love it without the spices.. honestly it’s the sauce that makes it!  Thanks for such an awesome recipe!

Wonderful!  I made one package of tenderloins whick was just over 4 pounds.  So I doubled the sauce.  "I love that sauce", per husband.  Cooked 4 hours on low, and about 30-45 min on high at the end.  Mine sliced, but was so tender it cut like butter.  Fo the sauce, I used a few good shakes of red pepper flakes as I am a whimp about spiciness.  The teriyaki sauce I bought was our own store brand.  Turned out really good.  Served with mashed potatoes and spooned thickened sauce over them too.  Will make again for sure!

Awesome, easy recipe.  I did not brown it first and I eliminated the brown sugar and used 2/3 cup honey.  I also eliminated the chillis and used one packet of Domino's pizza crushed red pepper and added a bit more chicken stock.  After 7 hours on low in the CrockPot, my tenderloin fell apart - so tender!

Very moist and tender - easy and wonderful to serve on a cold winter day.  Followed directions and came out great.

Now three years later, I used my electric crock pot, cooked it for 24 minutes and it was incredible.  Made the gravy in the electric crock pot after removing the tenderloin and oh so good!  A regular on cooler days!

This pork was very good. I think I mat have cooked it a little too long in the crock pot tho. We also just ate this pork on Asiago Cheese bread with colby jack cheese as sandwiches. I did make one adjustment: I used jalapeno instead of red chile pepper. I only used one jalapeno but shouldve probably used two.

I skipped the skillet browning and just put my tenderloins straight into the crockpot.  Mixed up the sauce and cooked on high as recommended.  After about 4 hours, I removed the tenderloins and poured the sauce mixture into a pot to puree.  I simmered the sauce for an hour to reduce while the tenderloins kept warm in the crock pot.  My husband LOVED the tenderness of the pork, and I loved the sauce!  Served over rice.
Will definitely be making again :)

WOW this was fabulous!  Followed the recipe as is except didn't have the peppers... but would try it next time because we love spicy.  Also I cooked it on low all day and it was wonderfully moist... fell apart when you cut it.

Rave reviews from my adult daughter's birthday meeting.  I did not brown, rather in the morning laid the onions on the bottom of the slow cooker, added tenderloin which I did not brown, added the sauce and cooked on low all of day. My tenderloin was about 5 pounds and still had plenty sauce.  Even though I allowed the rest time before cutting, the meat crumpled.  My daughter described as sweet with a little tang - she asked for the recipe!

Perfect and my families favorite.  I have had to do variations, because of a shortage of ingredients,  but love the original.

I didn't have 4 hours time, so I cut my 2-lb tenderloin into bite-sized pieces and cooked on high for 90 minutes. Doubled all sauce ingredients, though I substituted red pepper flakes instead of chile peppers (per another reviewer's suggestion). Delicious!! Served over sticky white rice. Will definitely make again.

Easy to prepare, and I had all the ingredients except for fresh peppers, and I used hot pepper flakes.  The meat was very tender and the sauce delicious.

I read the reviews before I started so I didn't brown before and I tripled my sauce to cover my pork tenderloin which was huge, but this was AMAZING!  I love it!  I will definately make this again!

Used chops instead of tenderloin and it worked beautifully (about 2 lbs.)!  Doubled the sauce and thickened it in a saucepan after everything cooked together in the crockpot.  Followed the recipe otherwise and it was fantastic!  Nice kick of spice, but not overwhelming and well-balanced with the sweetness of the teriyaki sauce.  I even got my 3-year-old to eat the meat (without the sauce)!  The pork itself was very juicy and fell apart with a fork.  Considering using leftover meat in fried rice.  Will definitely use this recipe again!!!

Very Good!! Followed recipe. Doubled sauce and served over jasmine rice w/ steamed broc. on the side. Slow cooked about 4 hours on low. Removed pork loin and slighty thickened sauce with flour on stove (I have a ceramic pot). YUM!! AND SO EASY! Loved the spice the peppers added ( I used pepper flakes). Looks just like the picture. We will eat for 2-3 evenings for it is just for me and hubby:)

This was great!  Even my picky eater asked for seconds!  I did leave out the peppers since I'm the only one who likes anything remotely spicy.  I also  used homemade teriyaki sauce and then cooked on low for about 5 hours.

Absolutely loved this!  I followed the recipe pretty much except that I didnt have any brown sugar so I substituted for white and just used less of it.  I also added a packed of onion soup mix in the place of the onion.   Cooked beautfully!  Great flavour and even beter for sandwiched the next day!

Easy to make, awesome flavor.  My fiance loved this and requests it often.  It's very low calorie so it's great for my diet as well.  My only problem was (as always with the slow cooker) I couldn't get the sauce to thicken up.  However, I'll chalk that up to my own lack of expertise.  Great recipe.

This was incredible! My husband couldn't stop saying how he never knew I could cook like this. I tried telling him it was super easy, but I'll take the compliments! The pork was so moist and tender, and I made brown rice and broccoli on the side. I used the teriyaki sauce from the slow cooker to pour on top of the rice and broccoli. It was so delicious! My 3-year-old daughter told me, "Mama, you make the best dinner in the whole wide world!". This from a kid who would rather eat PB&J sandwiches most of the time!

My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe! the first time we made it we cooked it on low the whole time and it cut into great slices. The second time I had to cook it on high and it ended up just shredding and was not as soft. But both times it was fantastic!

Very Tasty.  I made some changes.  First of all I forgot to pick up the red chili peppers so I used some red bell peppers I had here.  Second, I added a can of pineapple to it when it was just about finished cooking.  This made it a little like sweet and sour pork tenderloin.  Came out delicious though. Next time I will probably reduce the cook time to under 3 hours.  It was a little over done .

Fantastice recipe!  BEWARE: Cook on low instead of high.  I cooked it on high and it was done in 2 hours and the meat did not absorb the flavor very well.  So we used the sauce as a dipping sauce and it was fine.  Also, I did not have fresh red chile pepper so I used 1/2 t of red pepper flakes.  It was more than enough and gave it a little heat.  Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked the pork on low and it was done a little after 2hr, this is not something I would do If I was going off to work.  I didn't want tenderloin that fell apart so when I put the thermometer in and it came to temp I just set the slow cooker to warm.  I will also try this with a pork loin.  The sauce is the star of the recipe!  I just used the liquid form in the slow cooker but next time I will try straining and thickening it.  It was a tasty dish, I find it difficult finding good slow cooker dishes that are not a muddle of flavors or grey in colour..lol.  I will make again.

First and foremost, i did exactly what user Jewelsmom did - added ginger, sriracha, jals, etc.  used a probe thermometer, cooked for about 1.5-2hrs and meat was juicy and tender and didnt fall apart.  I have the worlds pickiest kids (5, 3yrs, and 11 months) and they LOVED it! Family fav!

This was delicious. I substituted with a little ground red pepper and that was too spicy. Also I recommend using a teriyaki sauce that isn't too sweet.

This was good.  Juicy and tender.  The flavor didn't really penetrate the meat.  Next time I will marinate it in the sauce and cook it in the same sauce.  I didn't sear it and I used dehydrated minced onions.

I bought a smithfield teriyaki pork loing and followed most of  the directions to the letter. I didn't have the peppers and used red pepper flakes instead. It was tender and juicy. My husband loved it! Will definately make again.

Very good recipe - quick, easy and tasty.  I did not have fresh chile but used dried crushed peppers to add the heat.  I also added a sliced red bell pepper to give color to the dish.  Served with rice and wilted greens.

I agree with everyone so far. I loved it and I made the drippings into a gravy and my kids just kept pouring it on. I just put it in the crock pot before church and it was ready when we got home, no turning like the recipe suggests and it was still perfect. Will definitely make this one again.

This pork came out moist and flavorful.  I ended up leaving it in the slow cooker for a little longer than the recipe called for because we just got busy, so the meat literally fell apart as I was taking it out.  Even better - the kids didn't complain about having to cut it.  We drizzled some of the sauce over it, had the onions on the side.  Amazing delicious - will make many more times!

Kids liked it a lot - they like everything teriyaki. However, I didn't put in the chili pepper, I'm sure a main ingredient, because I didn't have it and then they wouldn't like it. We are more traditional teriyaki people.

This came nice and tender in the slow cooker. I could not find red chile peppers at the store, so I used a green serrano instead.  Very nice combination of savory and sweet.

My kids loved this.  I would say if you use 2 lbs of tenderloin, then it feeds at least 6 people.  The meat just fell apart and had the teriyaki taste throughout.  I substituted one TB of Kikkoman Thai Chili Sauce for the peppers.  I would recommend Kikkoman Teriyaki Baste and Glaze and use one whole onion.  After I removed the meat, I used a cornstarch mixture to thicken the sauce.

My family loved this just the way it was written. My oldest son said that it was the most tender meat he had ever eaten. I thickened the juice when it was finished and it made a wonderful thick and flavorful gravy to put over the oven roasted potatoes I had cooked

Better than awesome.  Picky husband, 5, 3 and 18 month old all loved it!  So easy, especially when served with rice.  Next time will add a few more veggies.

Yum! I've made this twice now, once following the recipe exactly (but I cooked on low for about 4 hours), the second time, I did not brown the tenderloin, and I doubled the sauce--our family loves sauce! It was outstanding. One additional note: while teriyaki sauce is a bit sweet, the brown sugar does not make this too sweet, it actually lends a very nice flavor.Thank you for sharing this recipe with our family "Stay Home Cook"!

This was excellent! I used 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil and 1/2 tbsp of chili oil when I browned the meat, added some of the Cabernet that I bought to go with the meal to the mixture, and I used the suggestion in another review to insert garlic spears into the meat prior to slow cooking, and it was phenomenal! This is now in my short list of favorites!

Didn't have the red chili pepper, so I added red chili paste which gave it a nice kick to it.  I also added more Teriyaki and chicken broth to it to make more sauce.  At the very end, I added a little flour to thicken up the sauce.

Loved it! At the end of the cooking time, I shredded the pork and threw that back in with the sauce which I thickened with a little cornstarch mixed with water. Fantastic served over brown rice.

This was absolutely scrumptious!!  Nice and sweet, everyone had seconds!  My husband added some spice to the tenderloin before searing it.  We let it slow cook about an hour longer than the recipe said to and shredded the pork in with the sauce.  Great over rice!

This recipe is amazing! I have made it several times. The only thing I change is the onion...I just use onion powder. And when it’s done cooking, I transfer the liquid to a sauce pan and cook it with some corn starch to thicken it up. I can’t even describe the taste...it’s a yummy! I serve it with rice.

Made as instructed except I didn't sear the pork and I used chops.  It tastes a lot like another recipe I have, but this cooks in the crockpot not the oven so the flavors cook in more.  It was good.

After reading all of the rave reviews, I had high hopes for this recipe.  Unfortunately, we were quite disappointed with the results.  While the meat was tender, it did not have much of a teriyaki flavor.  Perhaps the amount of chicken broth called for diluted it too much.  This dish was not a winner with my family.

I made a 3.5 lb roast so doubled the sauce and made gravy from it.  Didn't find the red peppers so used jalapenos instead.  Recipe is great!  Thank you.

I used a pork roast  and cut even, chunky style. Terrific !Served wish mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. Sauce is good even on mashed potatoes. However , it's not gravy...so a littles goes a long way. Also I doubled sauce. Everyone loved. Exactly 4 hours  on low in crockpot.

Easy, great flavor.  We love the onion so I use a whole one.  I leave out the chile pepper so it's too spicy for the kids.  And I never bother browning the tenderloins, just trim and stick in the crockpot.  Meat comes out tender (almost shreds) and moist.

The recipe CLEARLY says cook on low.  Wow, just Wow.  I followed this exactly using  one seeded Green Serrano Chili, as that is what I had in the crisper.  This was delicious. Served with Pan-seared carrot coins and drizzled the sauce over everything. Hubby wished I had served with potatoes, but I am diabetic and he can suffer w/o potatoes along with me.
OH. Next time will add a thinly sliced red or sweet onion to the crop pot.

This was pretty good, very easy, but not spectacular. There’s no way I would have eaten it “as us”, meaning the sauce looked awful. I put it in a saucepan and thickened it with a cornstarch/water roux. I think it tasted better that way, too. I served the meat sliced over brown rice with sugar snap peas. I cooked it on low for about 4 1/2 hours. I will keep this in my Favorites as a back up for the future, may tweak the sauce a bit next time.

I made no changes and it was delicious!  Very tender, falling apart with your fork and the teriyaki sauce is perfect.  Great leftovers for a sandwich the next day!

Wow!  Amazing flavor!  To get that thick sauce: after the roast is done, put the whole slow cooker dish in the fridge after it cools and eat the next day.  YUMMO!!

This was fabulous! Made garlic mashed potatoes to go with it. The 'juice' was super yummy drizzled over everything and the pork was super tender. Thanks!

Didn't have the fresh peppers so I added a bit of cayenne pepper to the mix.  The meat turned out so tender and delicious.  Served it over rice.  Will definitely make again.

It was OK, but not exceptionally good. My husband said I could make it again, so it wasn't terrible. I made my own teriyaki sauce, and had some leftover. I poured that over my meat, and that was what made it good. I did not add any red chile pepper flakes because I didn't have any on hand, and I think it was fine.

So dry.  I usually love recipes from this site, but not sure about this one.  So dry I couldn’t even serve it to the family.  I followed the recipe to the letter but it crumbled when slicing and was so dry.  Very disappointing

LOVED THIS!!! My husband came home and was literally jumping up and down like a little kid because of how amazing it smelled. He said it's in his top 4 favorite dishes he's ever had in his life! (We also paired this with garlic mashed potatoes, and that was a huge hit too!!)

Also - I made a few changes! I took out the hot/spicy stuff (we're not a fan of that kind of flavor), and I added an extra clove of garlic, and added more chicken broth and teriyaki to cover the pork in the slow cooker so it was mostly submerged.  Definitely going in my recipe book!! :-)

I loved it. The store didn’t have red Chile’s so I used hot green Chile’s. I wish I would have thickened the sauce like someone mentioned. This is definitely a keeper.

Decent, but if we make it again, will start checking the temp after 2.5 hours and turn it off at 165 degrees.  Tenderloin was dry at 180...

I made this recipe as it is with the exception of the cut of meat. I used a 4lb.  bone in pork butt, (cheaper). And I tripled the ingredients, as one reviewer stated it would have been better to have the meat more covered with the liquid. On low for six hours, turning it on the other side after three hours. It turned out great! Would make again! Yum!

Made this last night for dinner with the only change being that I made it in a pressure cooker for 7 minutes with a slow release after searing it in my cast iron skillet.  My son and I LOVED it...my husband not so much but with full disclosure, I have to say he doesn't like much of anything as he is a "simple" eater!  His "complaint was that he thought it was too sweet.  Anyway, the flavor was really tasty and the pork very tender.  Next time I make it, I think I will either cook for less than 7 minutes in the pressure cooker or do a quick release.  Other than that, I would for sure make this again!

Followed the recipe as described.  I had high expectations but was a little disappointed in that the flavor from the sauce was not infused in the meat as much as I would have expected it to be.  Meat was tender and moist contrary to what some of the negative reviews were stating .  Flavor profile was subtle and overall  the meat was good but not great.

So good. I added jerk sauce to it and cooked it for 7 hours on low and turned it a couple times. I have a pork loin rib roast. I'm going to shred it and make sandwiches with little potatoes on the side

It was good but thought it would have more flavor.  Did    thicken the juices to put on rice.    Leftovers tonight but will put meat back in crockpot to try to get kit more tender.

I did not have teriyaki sauce, so I used 1 cup Hoisin and 1/2 cup General  Tso like another reviewer I like a lot of sauce. I put 1 Tb spoon flour in a skillet with the sauce and let it cook down and thicken. Turned out delicious and loin was tender.

I used 1 jalapeño instead of fresh red chili’s because I couldn’t find them at my grocery store. After the pork tenderloin cooked in slow cooker for 4 hours I took 2 forks to it and shred and let cook in sauce for 1 more hour. I put the shredded pork on top of white rice and stir fry vegetables and used sauce from crock pot on top. Absolute great recipe. Will be making this again.

The flavor combinations are excellent and the pork turned out to be very moist! I didn't have red chilies so I substituted jalapenos (2 peppers) instead. I also cut back on the brown sugar (2 Tbsp) to make sure it wouldn't be too sweet for my taste. I will definitely make this again!

Won't make it again. Followed the ingredient list and recipe to a tee.....and all I got was watery "sauce" that was so hot w/the chili peppers but no flavor. The pork was dry and didn't slice just tore and not even nicely.

The wife and I tried this recipe, was excellent. very good leftover as well. The only thing we didn't have were the peppers, so we used a Peruvian aji mirasol pepper because my wife is Peruvian and that is all we had at the time. Turned out delicious. Im just wondering if this recipe would work substituting the pork tenderloin for a beef pot roast? Thanks !

I made this according to the directions with a few variations that I used from other reviewers. Some say they cooked it 8 hours, others 6 and some for 4. I split the difference and cooked on low for 6. I doubled the sauce as several recommended and had I not done that, it may have been completely inedible. I turned it a couple of times during cooking to expose all sides to the sauce. I thickened the sauce with a bit of corn starch after removing the meat to slice. Some of it sliced ok, but most of it shredded. It was beyond dry. Even putting sauce on top- the meat was dry. Not sure how sauce covered meat can be that dry but it was. Won't be going into my rotation.

This is one of our staples!  Sooo good and makes great shredded pork sandwiches on the rare occasions there are leftovers. I use two three pound tenderloins every time and serve with mashed potatoes for our family of seven. Yum!

GREAT Pretty straight forward. I cooked on low,,chili paste,,
Did not cook for as long  and did not dry out. A little corn starch helps.

Tasty. But PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do NOT use a TENDERLOIN! Substitute with pork LOIN. I cannot stress this enough. The tenderloin is the filet mignon of the pig. You do not stick filet mignon in a crock pot.

I divided the recipe in half for a single, 1 lb. tenderloin and made it exactly as instructed except I substituted about 3/4 tsp pepper flakes for the chopped pepper. I turned the tenderloin over after 2 hours. It was so tender that I ended up serving it pulled-pork style on top of a bowl of rice. Since the meat is lean you definitely have to spoon the sauce on top quite generously, or it will taste dry. I thought it turned out very flavorful and the pepper flakes added a nice kick.

I had a pork loin so I doubled the sauce ingredients and it turned out great!  I shredded it and let it soak in the juices for a bit.  Very flavorful!  I didn't have fresh red pepper so used flakes. This will definitely be a go to dish for me!

Made as written. Four hours on high was a bit much, so will try low next time. The flavor was wonderful, although the broth was very thin. Will add rice to the cooker during the last half hour next time as a reviewer mentioned. Thanks for the recipe.

the meat was a bit dry- might have been the cut I got - but I wasn't all that happy with the results- would not make it again.

I didn't have teriyaki sauce, so used a mixture of hoisin, oyster, and soya sauce - it was great! Also can't eat cooked peppers so just used onion.  Will make this again!

My 14 year daughter has always been a picky eater,  but this is her favorite meal.  Add mashed potatoes (the au jus is tasty) and fresh green beans and I have a family favorite meal.

This was good and I'd make it again, but probably omit the onions (and we love onions). I did not include the chili's. This comes out to be 5 Smart WW points.

Followed recipe to the T, except I added more brown sugar, and was glad I did.  Other than that, hubby and I thought it was pretty good.  Nice flavor.  Very garlicky, which is what we like.

My whole family loved this recipe! I followed the directions exactly except for using a whole onion instead of 1/2, and about 1 1/2 hrs before serving I added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit. Right before serving I sliced the pork into medallions and then added back to the slow cooker to coat the meat well, and it was delicious. My kids said this recipe is "a keeper".

Used this as a jumping off point, 3lbs pork tenderloin in large cooker, 1 can chicken broth, about 13ozs teriyaki sauce, 1 cup of honey, 3 tblsps Tony Chachere's seasoning, I think I cooked mine 1 hour too long, so go for 6 hrs on LOW. Turned off heat then pulled it apart in the pot so the rest could soak up the sauce, after about 30 minutes I used a glass measuring cup and drained the excess sauce into a container for use after. Really melt-in-your-mouth tender, sweet going down with spicy aftertaste. Served over white rice and broccoli.

This was very tasty. I didn't have any fresh red chiles so I used crushed red pepper instead, and I only used 2 Tbs of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of teriyaki sauce and added 1/4 cup of low sodium soy sauce because my husband doesn't like things too sweet. The meat was delicious with the onions and sauce.

I thought this was yummy!! I made a few changes in cook time and amount of ingredients but I stuck to the ingredient list. The only thing I did different was I doubled the sauce and lengthened the cook time. I cooked the tenderloin on low for 8-9  hours and served over white rice. It was sooooo tender!! The meat was falling apart! Yummy! I wasn't really that big of a fan of the sauce  (I drizzled it over my rice and meat before eating) because I think it needed something else like crushed pineapple or something but it wasn't bad. It  just wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.

This was very delicious and everyone loved it!  I made my own teriyaki sauce for the recipe and used a pork loin instead of a tenderloin.  Also I seasoned the pork with plenty of seasoning before browning.  Instead of slow cooking this, I pressure cooked it to speed up the time.  It was super moist, fall apart, and flavorful!  I did reduce the sauce afterwards to thicken slightly and may use some cornstarch next time to get it thicker to drizzle on each slice.  Overall it was a great recipe and I can't wait to make it again sometime.  I bet replacing the chicken broth with pineapple juice, would kick it up another notch!  Thank you for the recipe!

Perhaps it was the teriyaki sauce I used, but this turned out rather bland despite the heat from the peppers. I was so hopeful as I love using my crock pot! I may try again with a different brand of sauce and more/hotter peppers.

I didn't brown mine at all. Didn't have time. I put everything in the pot at once, cooked it on low for 6 hrs then it was on warm for another 3hrs and it was delicious. It turned out to be more of a shredded pork. I didn't even have to cut it. My kids loved it. Couldn't get enough of it. Had green beans with it.

I did not add brown sugar because I did not have any. Otherwise prepared according to directions. It was great and the  family loved it. Plenty of juice, very moist and tender. Served with collard greens and cauliflower.  I added green and red peppers as well to my crockpot. I agree with others and placed on low for about 8 hours.

It was really easy and great flavour profile. Men in my house really liked it too. Doubled the sauce. At end of cooking I removed sauce, strained and thickened with corn starch. Cooked on low for 6 hours.

There likely are some differences in heat between machines but my machine on low made it slightly drier than I had hoped for. Next time I will try it for 3.5 hours. 
Also wondered if reducing the juice left in the pot would have made for a nice glaze on the meat.
Flavor was great and despite being a bit dry, my guests raved about it.

I made this recipe but with a few tweaks, instead of tenderloin I used ribblets. cool on high for about 2.5 hours then turn it down to low for another 2. I also added a pinch or two of curry and cayenne to really make it pop! great dish!

Made this evening for the dinner meal with green beans, rice and bread. Times and quantities worked well for a small two person cooker with a slightly smaller pork loin. Meat was completely covered and was very tender without falling apart when removing from the cooker.

Was a bit on the sweet side though, nothing terrible, just a bit much for my personal liking. Reduce the brown sugar a bit maybe next time.

This was outstanding! I used reduced sodium chicken broth and used the whole 14.5oz can, more or less doubling the teriyaki sauce and black pepper to keep the ratios right. I did not modify the brown sugar - last time I made this it was too sweet. I substituted 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper for the fresh red pepper. Low on 5 hours was perfect. I'll double or triple the onions next time.

This was tasty, but my husband said he likes regular pulled pork over tenderloin in the slow cooker.  The sauce was a little bland for us.

INCREDIBLY EASY RECIPE (and DELICIOUS!)!
I substituted the juice from 2 mandarins and 1 can of unsweetened pineapple chunks (w/juice) for the brown sugar,  to help tenderize the pork roast I used.
ENJOY!

I really loved this recipe.  I must admit that I cooked it overnight for about 10 hours until it was falling apart. Then I took out the liquid put it into a sauce pan, added some flower and reduced it into a thick gravy.  This gravy was phenomenal and worked perfect on the rice I served it with.  Multiple layers of flavor.   Thanks for sharing this with me... I loved it!!

Good recipe.  I cooked it at a lower temperature for 6 hours and the meat came out very tender.  I would caution using 3 chili peppers.  I followed the recipe (with a 3 pound tenderloin) and it was so spicy it my lips were still burning hours after dinner.  I would suggest either a half of a chili pepper or maybe just a few red pepper flakes.

We really enjoyed the sauce served over rice with some sliced green onions as a garnish. I did not brown the tenderloin before placing in the slow cooker and cooked on Low for 4 hours was perfect.

This was a big let down for the family. The loin really lacked in flavor and turned out extremely dry. The recipe was easy to prepare and may me good for families that don't like a bolder spice. The recipe states high but low is definitely correct.

Just made it, made it a little hotter. Cook it in my pressure cooker for 55 minutes came out so moist and tasty and the sauce over the rice and meat oh so good with a side of vegetables. Will make aging.

Easy and delicious. I didn't bother  browning, to save a pot to clean, used  1/4 tsp red pepper flakes instead of chilies, added a little smoked paprika and about a 1/2 tsp grated ginger. thickened the liquid at the end with some tapioca starch. Smelled and tasted amazing. Had with rice and steamed broccoli. Might make it a little spicier next time.

3 1/2 to 4 hours on high produced a dry and overcooked pork tenderloin with a difficult texture. The flavors are fine with the sugar counteracting the heat of the peppers nicely so I imagine that cooked properly this would be a tasty dish.  I'm going to try to salvage this by pulling the pork and trying to create an Asian inspired bbq sauce.

I only made a couple of changes and it turned out really well. 
I partially thawed the pork and put it right into the slow cooker I substituted the minced garlic for Garlic powder, and used crushed red pepper instead of the fresh pepper. 
I poured the chicken broth over the (still mostly frozen) pork, then pour the mixture of the oil, teriyaki sauce, and seasonings (mixed well) then turned the cooker on High for 2 and 1/2 hours then turned it on low for 3 hours. I broke apart with a wooden spoon it was so tender with about 30 min left. It was really good! It has a bit of a kick.
 
Next time I would add some vegetables like carrots, or celery, or maybe some potatoes.

I didn't feel it had much of a Teriyaki taste. It tasted a lot like the pulled pork I already make. It didn't taste bad, just not special, not sure I would make it again.

This is a really good and easy recipe. As other reviewers have suggested, it's best to cook it on low. I've also substituted pork butt that was on sale and it was just as good and a lot cheaper. I serve it with rice and it's delicious!

I made this exactly as written except I added 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes as I had no fresh red chiles. My husband loved it and kept saying how good it was. 2 lbs of tenderloin will never feed 6 people if they are like my husband who went back again and again! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used green chiles instead of red and I don't think it affected the flavor at all.  I did cook it on low, not high, for about 5 1/2 hours which was plenty. It literally fell apart. We served with rice and a broccoli and carrot stir fry. It mixed very well.

I'm adding this one to our regular dish rotation. I'm not a big fan of grilled pork. So this recipe caught my eye. I didn't have the red pepper so I substituted red pepper flakes about 3 tablespoons. It came out great. We all love it. Including me, the finicky pork eater! We served with rice and sauted broccoli . Bon Appetite!

Wow!  This was really good.  I made as directed except I had to substitute poblano pepper for the red pepper because my supermarket was out of red chili peppers.  As others have noted, cook on low, not high.  Over cooking in a crock pot can dry out your meat.  I served this with Trader Joe's frozen brown rice and fresh green beans.  Yummm!

This is good stuff!  I cut back on the garlic a bit because we aren't fans of a lot of garlic.  I doubled the recipe and took half to a friend who had been in the hospital.  It was a hit.  I have made it twice since.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  It was very easy to make and it didn't require a lot of ingredients.  After 3 hours the meat just fell apart!  However, I did slow cook it for the full 4 hours.  The meat was very flavorful.  I will definitely make this again!

Was very good. I cooked mine for 25 minutes on medium heat in a pressure cooker instead of a slow cooker and it was very good and tender. I found that you needed to put the juices on your plate at the end otherwise it lacked a little flavor but all in all, very good recipe.

Would give 5 stars but changed a couple things using what was on hand. First I used boneless sirloin chops (4), 1 chopped canned chipotle pepper with a little of the sauce, 2 cups broth to cover chops and 1 tsp. cornstarch to thicken sauce as it cooked. Delicious!

Great recipe!  My pork was 2.75 pounds, so I made 1.5 times the sauce.  It was just right.  I did simmer the sauce after cooking in he slow cooker to thicken it a bit.  I served it with broccoli florets.  The flavor was excellent!  I froze some left overs and it tasted just as good when I thawed it out.

This was really good!!! I pretty much stuck to the recipe but added Hoisin Sauce 1tablespoon. I added cornstarch as well only because I like my sauce thick. If you like a lot of sauce you might want to add double the amount to the recipe of the sauce I cooked it on low for 6 hours...Other than that..it was perfect over some rice and vegies. I also substituted 3 tablespoons of srirachi chili sauce for the red peppers...I like it sweet and spicy!!! . Easy and tasty...

I didn't have any onion and I added 1/2 cup white wine to the liquid and it was amazing.  Cooked the pork on low for 8 hours, turning it twice and it was tender and flavorful and so good.

This recipe is delish.  I used boneless pork sirloin chops.  I would not cook it on high, but did mine on low.  I took the sauce out and reduced it and mixed with cornstarch then spooned it over the chops.  The sauce was a bit salty but still tasted really good.

Very good, I doubled this (2 tenderloins) and it was alot of sauce. I used 3 habaneros and it was very spicy, but we like spicy food so that was ok for my family.

Sauce was good but too thin. Served over rice and it was like a soup. Did cook on low rather then high and the meat was cooked fine. Probably will not make this again.

Easy to make and got a few " this is good" throughout the meal!  Comment also made that the sauce wasn't over powering, but tasty! Only variation--used dried Serrano peppers from our garden since no fresh peppers on hand and a little less brown sugar than suggested.  Also only cooked 4.5 hours on low in slow cooker, very tender and juicy.  Thickened sauce from slow cooker to serve on top of sliced/shredded pork also added sliced green onion.  Served with a mixture of two fried rice recipes from this site and Hot Sake :)

I made this today for the first time and it was a huge hit.  One of my sons, who routinely takes leftovers to work for lunch, said "next time, Mom, make more leftovers" :-) I served the tenderloins with mashed potatoes and baby carrots. I didn't thicken the sauce as some reviewers did, but will try that next time, as the sauce was great on the mashed potatoes and would be even better thickened like gravy.  Overall a great recipe;  will definitely make again.

Yum!! So tender and delicious!! My fiance said it was the best pork ever. I cooked it on low setting instead of high. Perfect!

I made this last night, and my hubby and I were going to originally give it 4 stars, but we had leftovers today and this is unbelievably delicious!  The reason for the 4 stars was the pork was a little tougher than we would have liked it. Some changes I had made: we used beef broth instead of chicken (since it was what we had), and we didn't precook it, and I did double the sauce.  It did stay in the crock pot for about 5 hours (so maybe that's why it was tough).  But the leftovers--holy cow, five stars!  The meat was so tender (literally falling apart), and it was so infused with the teriyaki, that I wish we had more!  We served it with Spanish rice.  Can't wait to make this one again for dinner with my family and in-laws!  Next time I may add some mushrooms, carrots, and green onions as well!

Easy and Delicious! Couldn't find fresh red chiles, used jalapenos instead. Added a bit of heat, but not too much; even my two-year-old twins liked it!

This was very good! The entire family ate it.  I made it more mild.  I left out the peppers. I also cooked it for four hours on low.  I added corn starch to thicken gravy.  I will make it again

Made this tonight and I thought it was good.  Did read the other reviews and the 4 hours on high for tenderloin did make me nervous.  I did 4 hours on low and it came out perfectly. Was moist and tender.
 Definitely brown the outside otherwise you will have grey meat; will taste fine, but not look appetizing.

This was really very tasty!! I had KC Masterpiece Honey Teriyaki marinade on hand, so I used that... it had sesame seeds in it which added great flavor as well!! I also used boneless pork sirlion chops instead, as well as garlic powder in place of garlic. And I just chopped up the onion.
So, I basically took the same flavors and concepts and adjusted to what I had, and it was beyond yummy!!! I also semi shredded the pork chops and added about 3 tsp. cornstarch just to thicken it up a teensy bit. Served with brown rice and steamed broccoli, my husband wouldnt stop eating it!!! :)

I took other reviewers advice and used a boneless, pork loin roast.  I cooked it on low for 6 hrs. and increased the sauce.  It turned out dry w/not a very good texture.  The sauce, however, tastes great.  I did have to add 4 tbs. of corn starch (mixed w/little water) to thicken it on the stove top.

Will not make again.

This is fantastic! I doubled the sauce, cooked on low for 6 hours and threw in sweet potatoes and baby carrots for the last 45 minutes.  The I served it over rice with steamed broccoli.  The extra sauce worked great on the rice. I will be making this one again and again :)

Easy recipe, the meat was moist and tender.  I only gave it 3 stars since we didn't feel that it was very tasty.  The teriyaki taste was very very mild.

This was fantastic, definately a keeper. I went as per recipe except I doubled every thing for left overs and NOT MUCH LEFT. Next time I'll thicken the sauce and use a sharp knife or it will crumble when you cut it, other than that perfect.

Really liked this. The sauce was great. I thickened it up on the stove top with a little cornstarch. I cooked the pork loin on low for about 3.5 hours when the temp reached 150. Then I let it rest for about 10 mins. Sliced beautifully moist and tender. I used 1/2 tsp of pepper flakes as suggested by another reviewer because I couldn't find the peppers in my local store.  Thanks for the yummy recipe.

This recipe was great. Family enjoyed it and we all agreed it was a keeper. I used pineapple teriyaki marinade and only 2 peppers seeded. Increased it to 2 onions and 1-1/2 cups of chicken stock. Instead of cutting I pulled it apart and put the onions and sauce on top. Slow cooked on low for 8 hours and it was so soft and tender. It was very tasty between the sweet and hot flavors. My daughter doesn't like the heat and still loved it.

Yummy.  I had an hour break from work to assemble everything, threw it in the slow cooker and let it go.  Also took some suggestions from other reviews: added baby carrots, used red pepper in place of the red chile pepper.  I also threw in a couple extra garlic cloves.  Cooked on low, not high for four hours.  The meat was tender, didn't fall apart.  The carrots soaked up a little of the Teriyaki mixture and also added flavor to the meat -- I'd recommend adding the carrots.  Over the years I've collected quite a database of recipes -- and I rate them:  Not Good, OK, Very Good and SCRUMPTIOUS.  This one falls in the SCRUMPTIOUS category.

I made this for dinner tonight, and followed the recipe exactly minus the chile pepper, and I doubled the teriyaki mixture. It was AWESOME!!!!!! My picky dad who is a pain when it comes to pork was stealing pieces off my sister's plate. After the 4 hours on high it was so tender it broke apart, but I was still able to cut it into slices. Spooned the juice on the sliced pork when I served it. Thanks for the recipe, a keeper!! Delicious!!!

Followed the recipe; but doubled the sauce and omitted the pepper (my wife doesn't like spicy at all). Came out very nice, a tad dry, but nothing a bit of the leftover sauce on top couldn't fix. Definitely making it again.

Delicious. Sadly, I didn't have enough teriyaki sauce but it worked out.  We had rice 2 days in a row so I served it over pasta and it was good! I also added a small amount of frozen peas ,,, just cause I had 'em.

This was great. I mixed all ingrediants together, put my Pork Loin in my PRESSURE COOKER, and poured mixture over top. I set my Pressure Cooker for 50 minutes, and it was soooo moist & tender. The flavor was wonderful! My whole family just loved this. I will definately make again!

too spicy for our taste, but for people who like a strong teriyaki taste, along with the hot, it is on target.  The loin itself came out fork tender.

This was very good, moist and tender. I did make much more of the sauce than it called for. I used a 1 pound tenderloin and still doubled the sauce. I also added a splash of orange juice into the sauce and it complimented the teriyaki very well. Husband who is picky about meat and a friend that does not really like pork both enjoyed and gave it 4 stars.

I was feeling lazy and wanted a recipe that could be prepared ahead so I chose this one.  It was probably done after 3 hours.  The flavor was good.    Thanks for the recipe.

This was a quick and easy recipe and my little ones loved it!  I did not have the chili pepper, but turned out great without it.  We will definitely be making this again.

This was fabulous.  We eat pork a lot and this has gone to the top of our list of favorites. I didn't have red peppers on hand so I used some red pepper flakes. They worked great. I also made gravy from the juices. Yum!  Thanks for such a simple delicious recipe!

This was very easy and was really good.  The only change I made was adding ground red pepper because I didn't have fresh chile pepper.  Next time I make it I am going to try to thicken the gravy.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent.  So tender! Followed exactly with the exception of temp.  I found 4 hours on low was perfect.  I also thickened the sauce for a gravy while letting the meat rest for 5-10 min.

I made this recipe with thick cut pork chops. I put them in frozen and covered with rest of the ingredients. Cooked on low in crockpot for 4 hours, put chops aside to rest and thickened sauce with a little corn starch. Easy and soooo yummy!

This was okay...but I felt the sauce did not penetrate into the meat enough to give it any flavor.  We ended up dipping each bite of meat into side dish bowl of the teriyaki mixture.  The meat was also dry.  Will not make again.  Perhaps the browning of outside prevented any soaking of teriyaki flavor??? not sure?
