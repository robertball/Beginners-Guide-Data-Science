This was a nice way to start the morning.  I used skim milk rather than soy as that is what I had on hand.  The banana and pineapple added a nice sweetness to the smoothie without the banana overpowering the flavor.

As the submitter suggested, I subbed a different liquid-almond milk, and this smoothie came out quite good. I even used frozen spinach and the smoothie turned out ice cold, which I like. I did add some Truvia to sweeten it just a bit. A very refreshing smoothie. Perfect for hot summer days!

It was quick and yummy and summery. The spinach made it refreshing. It's not heavy either. Liked it!

Smooth and refreshing, in addition I added the spices, some allspice, ginger, and nutmeg.
