This tastes amazing if you add a package of fat-free instant vanilla pudding with the dry ingredients. The pudding really brings out the banana flavour. I give it one star without the pudding, 5 stars with it!

They came out great! 

The only things I did different was to use half brown sugar half white instead of using the called for all white sugar and change the baking time to 10 mins. My cookies where burned at the bottom at 13 mins. My family ate them up!

i make these all of the time. i originally got the recipe from granmas secrets... i use white chocolate chips instead, and i use powdwered sugar instead of white sugar... they are very cake like and taste best warm. i also bake mine on wax paper the original recipe i had said to move the wax paper to the counter (from the pan) and allow them to cool for 2 minutes before removing them from the wax paper onto a wire rack. and i only cook mine 7-9 minutes so they dont dry out. i love them and they are a huge hit!! i am making them in a few minutes for a birthday party this afternoon

This recipe is great.  Why?  Because it gets rid of that 1 ripe banana.  Most banana bread and muffin recipes calls for 3 ripe ones, so this is perfect when you have just one and don't want to toss it away.  Made the recipe exactly as written; no changes.  The recipe is just what the title says.  They are a nice soft cake-like cookie.  Nice for a change of pace too.  Giving away to the neighbors for a nice sunday morning treat.  They are not overly sweet and would be a good 'breakfast' cookie.

Very delicious recipe!  Just like eating little mini-loaves of banana bread.  My husband simply loved them to take as a quick breakfast on the way to work.

Easy to make, but they taasted rather flat.  I doubled the recipe, perhaps that made a difference.

Very quick and easy, however, the cookies taste like something is missing and leave a flour taste in your mouth. They might taste better if you adjust the ingredients so they similar to the chocolate chip cookie recipe on the back of the chocolate chip bag.

I added an extra banana, pecans, and chocolate chips. The texture is strange but I liked it. :)

I thought maybe the first batch just didn't work out, so I tried making them twice and the second time I used the vanilla pudding idea. They turned out OK the 2nd time, but still not great. Very disappointing.

I enjoyed these immediately after they had cooled, but the consistency had completely changed by the next day.  They were soggy and gross.  Not a great cookie, but I was looking for a recipe with fewer calories.

I would probably change the name of this recipe to "chocolate biscuits" because the finished texture is very bready (not cookie-like), and the banana flavor doesn't come through very strong (I would probably add more next time.) At first bite, my husband and I weren't impressed, but they actually grew on us once we accepted them as "biscuits."

These were good but the butter was way too strong. Next time I will use less.

These went like mad at my house! I have a house full of picky eaters and everyone loved these. Even my mother who doesn't have a sweet tooth in her head liked them. They were a very soft cake-like cookie so don't expect something with the texture of a regular chocolate chip cookie. I didn't try them with vanilla pudding as other reviews have suggested but I certainly will now.  I didn't change anything to the recipe myself though other than to slightly shorten the baking time due to a personal preference of having a gooey cookie.

My first inclination after trying one of these warm was to give this recipe a 3. But then I tried one once completely cooled and found I liked it better. My girls liked them too but my daughter's boyfriend who usually hovers around the cookie tin said he didn't like the texture. So the majority vote was a 4. Thankyou.

these were super tasty!! i was looking for something to do with some bananas that i bought for smoothies, b/c they were getting old, and i found this recipe... instead of dropping them i just made a huge cookie mush on the baking sheet and half way thru tore it up to bake the middle... this is a really good recipe and im going to make these and give them away to say "look what i did" even tho i got the recipe here... sorry to steal ur glory!! ;}

I forgot the vanilla. I still liked them and thought hoe much better they'd be had i remembered lol!  I think adding other kinds of sweeteners in sub for the brown sugar may taste good as well. Also almond extract would be even better I bet. Going to try that next time. This is the perfect recipe for that last almost overly ripe banana.

my aunt gave me a very similar recipe but she added dried cranberrys and pumkin seeds along with the chocolate chips and banana. sometimes she mixed it up a bit and added white chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate. but it was a hit with my family!

I really like the recipe. The only thing that I did differently is I left out the chocolate chips. This simply made mini individual banana bread treats. My whole family enjoyed them. Next time I am going to try it with white chocolate chips.
Thanks

Very easy to make. Used leftover Mini peanut butter cups as the chips. They are best warm but the muffin like texture is nice. They don’t have a lot of sugar so I don’t feel bad giving them as a snack.

Very good, and not too sweet. I used just 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of walnuts. Also, really only needs to cook for 9 minutes.

Made these for a charity bake sale and they were a hit.  One suggestion, though.  The list of ingredients does not mention walnuts, but the instructions say to add them with the chocolate chips.  So, what quantity of nuts should be added?

It's small yield recipe. The cookies came out looking not appealing at all; but to my surprise, they weren't bad.They made a pretty good tasting cookie (a pale, tiny, cake-like,  but still decent tasting cookie).  The main picture of the recipe is an exactly accurate depiction of the final product, just as a final note.

Very delicious.I subbed bisquick for flour, margarine for butter, and dark chocolate chunks instead of chips.

I used two bananas and semi-sweet chocolate chips, and think these are delicious!  Not too sweet, but flavorful.
