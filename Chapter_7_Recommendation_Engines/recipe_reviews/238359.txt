The cinnamon to sugar ratio seemed off. Most cinnamon roll/toast style recipes use a much larger sugar to cinnamon amount. The reslting product here is simply cinnamon toast cubes and not at all a cinnamon roll type experience. I think making cinnamon toast is way more simple to make. Actually a toaster would be safer for kids to operate too. Thanks for sharing.
