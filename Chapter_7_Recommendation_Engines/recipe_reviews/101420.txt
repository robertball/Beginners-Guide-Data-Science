I thought the salsa was good, liked the mixture of sweet and spicy. I only used about 3/4 of one pepper and that was enough for my family. What I didn't like was the pork chop didn't have any flavor.

Wonderful!  I used 1 1/2 Serrano Peppers because I was worried about the heat, but it was not hot at all.  Go ahead and use 2.  
My only question was about the pineapple juice.  I used fresh pineapple for the salsa, but used the juice from canned pineapple for the brine. Not sure if this was correct, but it turned out GREAT!  The pork chop alone was wonderful after marinating in the brine, but the salsa made it fabulous!
