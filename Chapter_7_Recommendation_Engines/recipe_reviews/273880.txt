Too good!   I made just as the recipe called.  Refreshing, would be perfect to take to a ladies luncheon but mine would never have made it out of the house!

Dough was all but unworkable following the recipe, had to add more flour and refrigerate it to roll it out. Wasn't well thought out.

The are excellent, nice flavour, tender crumb, easy to work with dough. I made this using my kitchenaid and switched to a dough hook when adding the flour mixture. Thanks for the recipe!
