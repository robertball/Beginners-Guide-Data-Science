We've been making these for over a year now, and just got around to reviewing.  They are killer!  We make them at least once a month during grill season.  Don't change anything.  The longer you marinate, the spicier they get.  Overnight, and they are hot.  Don't serve to anybody scared of spicy food.  Who wants to hang out with them anyway?

If you like spicy, try this recipe! Made as written, I gave five stars. Hubby would have given three as he doesn't have as much appreciation for spicy foods.  Next time will tone down the cayenne just a hair and put in pitas with cucumber sauce- that'll shut him up...

I entered this in our newspaper's recipe contest. Out of over 400 entries, I was one of 27 finalists. I ended up getting 2nd in the appetizers division. I made short kabobs with only 5 cubes of beef on each, and then stuck them into a voodoo doll made from shaped and baked bread. It was fun. I reduced the cayenne by half and still thought they were plenty hot. One of my family's newest all-time favorites. Great for Halloween or football parties.

I didn't think these would be hot enough for my husband so I gave them a 6 hour marinate time. They were really HOT! Great with onions, mushroom, sourcream and tortillas. I would only suggest that you have to like food that makes you sweat!

I skewered on some green & red bell peppers intermittently along with the steak. I used Ribeye in place of the sirloin. Served with Jasmine Rice (from this site) & grilled pineapple & peaches.

I made this recipe for my husband and now he requests it at least once a week.  I also made it for a barbeque and now my best friend is in love with it!  I make a seperate version minus the cayenne for the kids.  The recipe "as is" is pretty hot--one of our favorites!

These were amazingly good. My huband and I LOVED them. They were pretty spicey, but we like spice. :) I didn't have time to marinate them more than about 40min, but they will still super flavorful. I alternated them with onions on the kebab sticks which was really yummy if you like onions, too. A+

I am wavering between 4 & 5 Stars on this one... so I am giving it 5 stars. Although the flavor was awesome- it wasn't very spicy after 2 hours, and it was very salty.  I just wanted to say that the spiciness and the saltiness will be greatly affected by the hotness of your cayenne (and marinading time) and the kind of beef bouillion you use.  The bouillion I used was a Mexican beef bouillion. When adding it, I held back a bit but I should have at least halved or quartered it so it wasn't so salty.  However, the meat was very tender and flavorful and we enjoyed it with a brown rice/lentil mix with fresh chopped tomatoes and cumin/garlic in it.  Thanks for the recipe I will continue to make it with modifications!

Very good beef kabobs.  I followed other review's advice and halfed the cayenne which was good, but we like mild spice not extreme spice.  They also turned out a tad dry.  Will add this one to my recipe book and adjust in the future to make a little more moist and tender.

Awesome flavor!!  A little too much heat.  1/2 the Cayenne and a 5 hr marinade worked for us -- Oh! And you really don't need to add the salt (plenty in the bouillon), or do the rolling in the oil step.  We added r/y/g bells, red onion and shrooms and did them w/rice....looking forward to leftovers of the whole 9 yards wrapped in a tortilla tomorrow!  MMMmmm!  Thanks Indy!  ***OMG!  Next day leftovers heated in the oven, thrown in a tortilla w/leftover pilaf and a shot of Emily's parmesan peppercorn dressing (also from this site) and -- I'm in HEAVEN!  thanks again!! Yum Yum!

I always make recipes to a tee first then adjust to my liking.  

These were good, but holy salt batman.  Why do you need any extra salt with 2T of beef bouillon?   Next time I'll only use 1t of bouillon to the mix to see how it does.

Yum! As other reviewers suggested, I did cut the cayenne in half as I let my sirloin marinate for ~10 hours. The only change I will make next time is to omit the salt as I felt the bouillon provided enough. Otherwise, excellent. Thanks!

Delish. I used 6 beef bouillon cubes, 4 tablespoons of water, 1 teaspoon of cayenne, and omitted the salt. It was almost spicy enough for me, and almost too spicy for my husband. So that was about right for us (one spice lover, and one not). It bordered on being too salty so definitely omit the extra salt and consider the extra water or less bouillon. I also grilled on med-high heat for about 4 minutes a side as we like it medium rare. We ate it with pita bread and the sauce "Yai Yai's Tzatziki sauce" from this site. I took my first bite and was in culinary heaven. Loved.

This had great flavor.  I changed some things because I did not have them.  Instead of the bouillon granules I used 14.5 oz of beef broth, and did not add the salt.  Instead of cubing my meat, I chose a sirloin roast and sliced it thin.  I combined all the ingredients and marinaded the meat about 2-3 hours.  I did not use the skewers but pan fried without the oil, until done.  These turned out to have a great taste as roast beef sandwiches.

So easy and inexplicably good!  I marinated the beef for at least 24 hours and so halved the cayenne to only 1 tsp.  Perfect!! Spicy but not too spicy.

Wow, this recipe is delicious!  Marinated the meat for about 5 hours... put a tiny bit less cayenne because wanted to please all the guests even though I'm a huge cayenne fan.  Also, did not add salt because the bouillon was ample!  The meat is soooooooooo tender and flavorful and this was so easy to make!  We also had chicken kabobs and mushrooms, red onions, cherry tomatoes and red, yellow and orange peppers on the skewers.

These were great! I reduced the cayenne to 1 1/4 tsp and marinated for 2 hours and they were deliciously spicey. Skewered them with mushrooms and onions. I will definitely make them again!

They were good. Not too spicy (I was hoping for more; I will double the spice next time), even my mom, not a spicy person, liked them! Grilled them up on the BBQ and the whole patio smelt delicious! Served with roasted potatoes and veggies (also done on the BBQ) and the dinner was a raving hit!

Followed the recipe to the T.  Skewered meat with onions and red pepper.  Excellent dish!  Might take th cayenne down to 1 1/2 tsp next time it was pretty spicy.  Served with corn and black bean salad from this site, grilled tortillas, sliced avocado and sour cream.  Thanks!

I am not sure how this gets 5 stars.  I made it as directed confidently for a group of people and it was way too salty.  I am sure the other spices may have been great had I been able to taste them through the salt.  Please heed the other reviewers, many of whom suggest it is too salty but still rated a perfect 5 stars: leave out the salt and go with a low sodium broth!

The flavors were excellent! The only change we will make next time is to use good meat like ribeye steak. I didn't think it was too spicy and ended up kicking it up a notch. Be sure to grill the kabobs as it adds to the great flavor. Thank you for sharing!!

I didn't find these to be very spicy. I thought I followed the recipe closely*, and even let them marinade overnight. However, the flavor I did get was still very tasty, but a little too salty. Thank you for this recipe, I will definitely try it again.  *I used two bouillon cubes, not granules, and dissolved them in 1/2 cup of water, so maybe this diluted it too much? I also broiled them since I don't have a grill.

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site... and that's saying a lot, because I have tried MANY. I made this healthier by omitting the oil completely. This was mainly just because I forgot, but the meat didn't stick at all. It wasn't missed, and still tasted great.

These were excellent.  I cheated and used already pre-cubed stew meat.  I also didn't add the extra salt and used about 3/4 the amount of cayenne pepper called for and it was plenty spicy!  It was raining, so we put the skewers on the Foreman Grill and cooked for between 4-6 minutes.  One thing to note is not to push the meat too close together if cooking on the Foreman.  Those that were too close together were still very rare.  Will definitely make again.

This was easy and delicious. I did add a bit more water to the marinade than called for simply because it didn't look like there was going to be enough juice as directed.  Other than that, this was perfect!

Hot hot hot. These were great, we wound up dipping them in some left over sour cream dip (sour cream mixed with paprika and taco seasoning) to help cool them down a bit. Thanks for the recipe:)

I cut the cayenne in half, ommited the salt and marinated overnight.  These were pretty good.  I actually made beef tacos out of these using guacamole, lettuce, cheese and tortillas.

This recipe packs some heat. I was quite surprised. I used filet mignon cubes so of course they were super tender, but I may tame it down to 1 or 1.5 teaspoons of the cayenne pepper. Everyone loved it though...except for my daughter who does not like spicy food.

I really like the flavor for the most part, but found it a bit too salty.  Next time I'd reduce the beef bullion and not add any additional salt.

Just made these for my wife and I as a test run for a camp trip and they were outstanding. I used top sirloin and marinated for about six hours. The spice is there but not at all overwhelming. Absolutely delicious and very easy to prep.

Sooo good! I used only 1 1/2 teaspoons of the cayenne because of the reviews saying it was too spicy. Next time I will use the full 2 teaspoons because it wasn't too spicy at all. We alternated the meat with mushrooms, peppers and onions and served it with tzatziki and pitas. It was devoured. Thanks for a great recipe.

Awesome!! I didn't put quite as much beef bouillon as it called for (about half) because I only the cubes, but I also added about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar to cut some of the heat, but otherwise SO good!!!

When the reviews say HOT, they mean it.  My husband loves heat but I can't handle too much so I only used a 1 tsp of Cayenne.  We barely got through it, my mouth was numb!  That being said that was the best numb mouth ever!  I added onions and red & green bell peppers between the beef pieces.  I also choose to use a bottom round roast.  It had sooo much flavor I couldn't not believe it.  We love kabobs so I'm always trying new recipes.  This is the best one to date!

Quick and easy to make with great flavor.  Super spicy even for my husband who is Haitian.  The first time I followed the recipe to a T.  The second time I used only 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper and 1 tsp. chili powder. Came out perfect.

I stumbled upon this recipe (IN my own recipe box, go figure) when trying to find something to do w/cuts of meat I'm unfamiliar with from our side of beef.  The reviews were fantastic, but I was a little hesitant because Mr. LTH is a big fat spice sissy.  I decided, based on reviews, to go for it and 1/2 the cayenne.  Due to poor planning, I had to use only 1/2tsp cayenne because I ran out.  I added 1/2 tsp chili powder to attempt to compensate.  I left out black pepper because I hate it and used beef broth (actually, the new Swanson beef broth enhancer stuff) instead of boullion.  These were GREAT both in tortillas w/raw onion and light sour cream and on their own.  They were not hot, AT ALL w/using 1/2 tsp cayenne.  Even w/sissy Mr. LTH, I think I'll bump it up to over 1 tsp next time (and there WILL be a next time).  THANKS, Eating Indy, for a great recipe!

These were great. I cut back on the pepper, but they were just the right about of spicy for me. Didn't change anything else. Served it with a cucumber salad from this site, it was a nice cool to go with the heat.

I Love this recipe and so does my husband. We actually have been making the marinade and using it for steaks. Just pan sear the steaks on each side for about 2 minutes in a grill pan and toss it in the oven preheated to 400 for about 8-12 minutes depending on the thickness of the steak. Spices in this recipe are delicious and you can adjust the cayenne to  the level of spiciness you want.

Excellent recipe!  I did add a little lemon juice to help tenderize the meat since I was using a cheaper cut of beef and only had time to marinate for about an hour and a half, but these were a hit.  I have already received a request to make them again.  Thanks for sharing!

Great!! Took advice of others and reduced the amount of pepper and did not add salt. They were great, espically with sour cream and pitas.

Oh my, oh my, oh my ... these are fabulous and the recipe is perfect as is! I made these a few times over the summer, for family and friends and always get rave reviews. Followed the recipe to the letter on the first go around, found they were tad salty for us, cutting the boullion in half did the trick, and you still get all the spice. EVERYONE I've made these for LOVES them. Definitely recommend serving with pita bread (allrecipes has some excellent and super easy tzatziki sauces to go with) to cool your face off though!

Used Venison steaks since that is what I had.  These are good and spicy.  Will probably make again.  Sprayed with olive oil instead of using veg oil.  Added red pepper and onion to the kabobs and highly recommend this addition

Excellent! Experimented with them at a BBQ yesterday and they were a BIG HIT with my guests. Didn't have cayenne - substituted chili powder. Will definitely make these again and next time try it with cayenne!

All I could taste was overpowering salt and MSG. I have made many kabobs in my time but these were definitely the worst.

OH My!!
After reading all of the reviews I decided to try this recipe and find out myself if it was really that spectacular. Yes, Yes, YES! What an AWESOME flavor this recipe has! I followed the recipe as written except cutting the cayene in half as suggested by some - one of my kids has a hard time with hot foods. The rest of us love it HOT and we thought it was perfect with half.
Thanks or the new addition to our family favs!

Even after reading all the reviews, I did not expect these to be so spicy!  I let them marinade for just a couple of hours and they had such a great bite!  I made tzatziki sauce to go with them, which was awesome.  Really can't wait to make them again!!

These were AMAZING!   We used the recipe as is and the spice was perfect for us.  We used red bell peppers and vidiala onions and grilled the kebabs.  We grilled corn on the cob too and they were done at the same time.  We chopped up the left overs this morning and made omlettes.  SO GOOD.

I have been using this site for a little over 2 years now and have never rated a recipe before today. All I can say about this recipe is AWSOME!  I added a little liquid smoke to my batch and they turned out so yummy.  Not even a week has gone by and my husband is asking for them again.  This is a MUST TRY.

I was just about to give it 4 stars but decided to go with 5 because they were delicious even though they were way too salty. I didn't add salt and used Herbox (the brand) boullion. As always I tasted the marinade after adding all the igredients and it did tase salty but I decided to leave it that way concidering I was going to marinate less than 2 hours. They still turned out salty. The flavor was outstanding and for my taste not too spicy. I will definitaly be making it again but next time I will try a different boullion or add less of this one but most importantly I will trust my taste buds before mixing the marinade with meat.

Went with beef stock instead of the bouillon/water mix and marinated overnight and PERFECT! They turned out nice and juicy with just the right amount of kick. Thanks Eating Indy!

This recipe is a keeper for sure, I didn't use the whole 2 tsp of cayanne, figured it might be too hot. I only added 1 1/2 tsp and it was perfect. Simple ingredients, but packs alot of flavor. Grilled slow and low over charcoal and used pita bread lettuce and sour cream like the reviews said and it made for an excellent dinner.

WOW! These were so good.  Definitely spicy, I cut it down to about 1 1/4 tsp. cayenne and I still felt the burn.  But I do highly recommend them!  I used mushrooms, yellow, red, and orange bell peppers, and I cooked them on high on the grill for 10 minutes, flipping intermittently.  They turned out perfect.  I will be making these many times in the future!

I brought these camping! I had marinated the meat overnight, and the morning before we left I added the veggies (yellow peppers, red spanish onion, mushrooms, ect.) on the skewer and drizzled the juices/sauce over each skewer and wrapped them in Reynolds heavy duty foil. put them in the cooler and got to our camping spot... by the time we set up camp, wandered around and lit the fire, we were STARVING. I put these on the fire over red hot coals and had my boyfriend flip them over every 2 or 3 min. while I made some rice in the pot (Sidekicks - chinese rice) .. I also brought along some garlic nan bread from my local bakery, and we threw a few slices of that over the grill on the fire as well... when it finally came time to eat  OooOmmmggggg was this goooood! my boyfriend and his brother inhaled them, and with the addition of rice and the nan bread, it was very delcious! I took all of my meat/veggies off of the skewer and mixed it in with my rice and jsut spooned it onto my bread and ate 'indian style'... the coronas helped wash it all down!

caution - this is SPICY. I like spice and this was even a *bit* much for me. next time I might only add 1 tsp of the cayenne, or some brown sugar to mellow out the cayenne...

I'll be making this again verys oon on the home bbq, thanks for the great recipe!

Super tasty, not as spicy as you might think. Did them in my Geo Forman grill. Put red bell peper, mushrooms and onion between meat cubes. 5 min on the grill and they were awesome. Thanks, Eating Indy,
for a simple and tasty recipie.

Awesome recipe! I cooked these for dinner tonight and my fiance was beside himself he enjoyed these so much. I followed the recipe exactly except I used tenderized round steak since we had a surplus of it. The meat soaked up the juice really quickly and the 5 hours of marinade time made these wonderfully, delightfully spicy

This was AWESOME! I used filet steaks that I got at a good price from Costco so I'd have a little margin for error in case I cooked them too long. We like the meat very pink and they were amazing after just a couple minutes on each side (small pieces, very hot grill). Due to rain, they ended up marinating for a whole day, and didn't come out too spicy at all. Definitely know your cayenne. I've tasted all different levels of spice, all under the same name. :) I served this with warmed up naan bread and plain yogurt. DELICIOUS! If you really like steak, this spicy recipe will serve two. :) Thank you for the wonderful recipe, I can't wait to make this again. **Update: 2 tbsp beef bouillon is equal to 6 cubes and that seemed a bit too salty this time. Next time I'll use 4 or 5 cubes instead for a little under 1.5 lbs.

Amazing!  If using boullion cubes, microwave with the water to help them dissolve.  No extra salt needed, as the boullion is plenty salty.  My new favourite marinade!

These are amazing!  We actually marinaded them for almost 24 hrs because it got too windy and rain was threatening the original night we were going to grill them.  We love spicy foods but really did not consider these super spicy.  It was more that they had GREAT flavor!  We interchanged the beef with onion, mushrooms and cherry tomatoes and otherwise, followed the recipe.  We will make these again, often!

Wow! These were such a hit at a recent party everyone wants the recipe. Warn those who don't like things too spicy, they are HOT, but great with the sour cream. So easy to make and fantastic! Rave reviews. I can't wait to make them again for other friends.

I wanted to like this but, it was simply way too hot. I only used 1/2 of the cayenne pepper. I like spicy food but after a few bites I was done. You would really need to like very hot/spicy food to enjoy this.

I made this for company and after reading some of the reviews I was afraid it was going to be too hot because I was marinating it overnight so I used about 1.5 tsp Cayenne and it was still very good but I wished I had used the full amount of cayenne. Everyone loved it but I'm sure we will like it better with the full 2 tsp.

We love, love, Love this recipe! First time I followed the recipe to the T; since then this is our go-to marinade! Today used it on chicken and used half ground red pepper half crushed red pepper and chicken bullion just as awesome! I always omit the salt plenty in the bullion, don't need it.

Very easy and very tasty.  I admit I only used half the cayenne pepper, because I don't like super spicy.  And these ended up with the right amount of heat.

These were awsome. whole family loved them. doubled the recipe because I had meat that needed to be cooked. I marinated them overnight, we like hot food. The only thing I did different was to add 1/4 cup of white vinegar since the meat I had was round steak and not tender like sirloin. I had about 3 1/2 lbs of meat and there was 4 of us. I figured I would have left overs, NOPE ate it all. It was just that good. The next day I went to the store and bought some sirloin. We are having them again next week.

We accidentally put the water and oil into the seasoning but it didn't seem to affect it. Otherwise we made it as is and it came it GREAT! It was a little too spicy for my wife, so next time I'm going to half the cayenne and pepper

Thought these were very good: i have made twice and the first time i made the recipe as it reads. They were pretty spicy, so the next time i halved the cayenne and they were still spicy so i thought they were more tolerable for friends and family. Other than that, i skewered them with peppers, mushrooms and some zucchini and thought it was excellent.

Loved these!  So spicy & flavorful, but not over the top.  We marinated the beef cubes for 2 days as I worried our cheaper London broil would be tough.  I did add some wine vinegar to the marinade to help break the meat down.  Really enjoyed the grilled veggies which we did on seperate kabobs so they wouldn't overcook.  Will use this marinade often-Thank you!!

We made this last night and everyone loved it!  We don't eat many carbs, so we didn't use pita bread.  We just had them with grilled veggies, sour cream a little grated cheddar and an avocado salsa.  Knowing we wouldn't have bread and having read prior reviews, I only used half of the cayenne pepper called for in the original recipe.  Good thing!  3 diners thought it was the perfect amount of spice, but 2 diners thought it was a little too spicy.  But, I can tell you that everyone cleaned their plates and I didn't have any leftovers!  Will definitely make this one again!

Great flavor! We cut the cayenne in half and may cut it back a little more next time.  Will cut back on the salt next time as well.  I soaked the veggies and beef in this for a couple of hours.

Excellent recipe.  I cut the cayenne in half as well and it was the perfect amount of spice for our family.  Instead of granules, I used 4 bouillon cubes.

these do have a good flavor and spice ratio however that is overshaddowed by the amount of salt.  I wasn't sure about the extra 1/2 tsp of salt but I like to follow a recipe the 1st time I make it especially when the reviews are generally good.  I should have followed my 1st mind and left the extra salt out.  Luckily I only cooked up about 5 of them for a quick snack and taste test, I will use the remainders in a soup or something where the salt can boil off.  I probably will make these again during the summer months to cook over the charcoal grill, but definitely minus extra salt.

I've been making these for about five years now.  My family loves them, and they're requested for extended family cookouts.  If I marinate the meat for too long, the kabobs are a little too hot for some...I usually let them go for about three hours.  They are hands down the best kabobs I've ever had.

OMG Fabulous recipe!This one is a keeper! Changed the quantities for 2 people and cut back on the Cayenne as we don't like Voodoo Hot! Used one cube McCormicks veggie beef stock cube, so no MSG and not too salty.  1 TBL water and just 1/tsp cayenne & a good grind of black pepper,(I try not to use salt in my cooking)... turned out perfect amount of spicy heat for us. Really tasty! Served with a skewer of peppers,red onions, tomatoes and mushrooms on a bed of basmati rice. Serve with a dollop of Yai Yai's Tzatziki (found on All Recipes site). Absolutely delicious. next time I will cook the rice in chicken stock to complement all the flavors going on here.The rice needs a little something to compete. This is going to become a staple in our household. It's a restaurant quality meal that would be great for a dinner party. DrK.

These are great!  They do get spicy though - so I normally end up leaving some without the pepper for my son (3 years old).  I load the grilled sirloin into fluffy flour tortillas and then slather it with Molly's tzatziki sauce (from this site).  Sometimes I get a craving that only this recipe can satisfy.  Also, rather than rolling the kabobs in the olive oil, I generally just put the meat and the olive oil in a bowl and mix it up right before I skewer them.

I love spice, so I really appreciate this easy tasty recipe.  Unfortunately, I am a city gal living in an apartment, so I had to George Forman grill these kebobs. I can just imagine how awesome these would taste if they were fresh off a charcoal grill.

VERY good! I like spicy flavor without burning off my mouth, so I used about 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper and it was on the top of my hot scale. Perfect wrapped in some grilled corn tortillas with a little bit of sour cream mixed with fresh garlic, cilantro and pinch of salt. It's a regular in my home now!

Made exactly as written.  Used sirloin for half and tofu for the non meat eaters.  OUTSTANDING.  Quite spicy.  Served with Tzatziki and grilled pita, potato salad and melon.  Tzatziki and melon balanced the spice very well.  Really good, will become a summer favorite.

Outstanding recipe!!! So simple yet so good! Thw seasoning really accentuates the flavor of the beef. I sometimes brown in a pan over medium high heat when the weather isn't grill friendly and the results are just as amazing.  I alsoo cut the cayenne in half, but there is still enough for a spicy kick. My husband requests this at LEAST once a week!  I cannot wait until football season....a great recipe for tailgating that pairs well with your favorite beer!

I added pineapple juice instead of the water as someone wisely suggested. I unfortunately cut back just a little on the cayenne. Bad choice for us as it was not very spicy, even after 5 hours of marinading. So we added sriracha while eating. Will make again. Thought I might add some garam masala spice next time for more depth of flavor.

If you follow the recipe exactly, these are way too hot for my liking.  A perfect way to ruin a good steak.  I guess I should have had a better clue when I saw 2 teaspoons of cayenne! I also didn't try sour cream like the author suggested so if I make them again I will try it like that.

Made these the other night and WOW they were amazing!!! I used half the cayenne suggested and did NOT add salt.  My husband over-salts everything (IMO) and he said they were very salty.  He took the left overs to work and shared with his co-workers and they all want more!  They were very spicy though and since having my gallbladder removed, I can't eat spicy foods but these were worth the trouble. Great Recipe, highly recommended!!!

Verrrry spicy. Next time I'd cut back on the cayenne and black pepper, but that's just personal taste. Served with sour cream to take a little of the heat off. Very easy recipe that I'll make again.

This is a great marinade for beef! We like to use a NY strip cut up and skewered along with some peppers and onions. We usually put the meat and veggies together in a pita with some sour cream to cool it down and it's delicious!

I made these last summer and I've been meaning to review them ever since! These kabobs were incredible. They flavor they produce is a 10/10. I used the wrong kind of beef (mistakenly picked up stewing beef) and they were very tough. It was my mistake and next time I will use a good sirloin. Other than that this is an amazing recipe and I look forward to making it again!!

My husband and I approve of this recipe!  Easy, Good flavor and spicy.  And just plain fun to eat a food name Haitian Voodoo sticks!  I forgot to coat the kabobs in oil and they cooked just fine without sticking on our BBQ.  Definitely will be cooking these again.

We loved this.  I only marinated for a few hours and it was way too spicy for some in our group, but those who like spice loved this.  Several people commented that it has a flavor reminiscent of beef jerky, which I would agree with.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was good.. everyone really liked it at our barbeque last night. However, I cut the amount of cayenne I used in half from the recipe and it was still on the verge of being too spicy for all of us. I got comments about people's mouths being "on fire" and runny noses.  Any more cayenne and it would have been so spicy you couldn't taste anything but raw heat. I also grilled some bell peppers and onions with it and used yogurt as a topping instead of sour cream and it was an essential balance to the fiery spice of the meat.

Outstanding.  I added a Jamaican hot sauce I bought from the grocery store and it provided more zing for the beef.  I also added a pinch of brown sugar.  Great meal, everyone enjoyed it.

Very good, easy recipe for kabobs..I omited the 1/2 teaspoon of salt because the bouillon granules are pretty salty. other than that followed recipe ingredients exacty.  Let marinade for 1 hour.  These can a great kick to them!!

I've made these for years.  I always add the oil right away to marinate overnight.  I add cherry tomatoes, onions and peppers about an hour  before cook time.   So yummy!

Outstanding kebabs. I've made this twice this summer to rave reviews. Serving this on pita or naan is the way to go. We used sour cream, but I think tzatziki would also be excellent with the spicy meat. Another great accompaniment to this dish is a mango salsa. I did decrease the amount of cayenne to 1 1/2 tsp; it still had plenty of heat. I also followed others and skipped the salt.

Use a lot less cayenne pepper, make the flavor much better.

I'm a kebab junkie, and this has become my go-to marinade.  To the point that when I use other recipes, I end up resenting my dinner for not being this recipe. Sad, really.

This marinade is brilliant in its simplicity and versatility. It's amazing on every meat and vegetable I've tried it on. Perfect. Amazing. Delicious. 

Full disclosure: I've never made this recipe without omitting the salt, and I can't see how adding it could possibly improve the taste. There's more than enough sodium from the bullion as it is. Beyond that, the recipe is wonderful. 

One final note...this recipe is hot enough that you should probably make sure everyone you're serving is on board with that. It's not "I dare you to eat this" hot. It's not even "I need a full glass of water" hot. But I'd classify it as potentially being too hot for many mainstream palates.

These are my favorite kabobs and I make them every summer. I always cut the cayenne in half because otherwise I can only eat one or two before my tongue hurts from the heat.

It's absolutely how ridiculous how easy and delicious this recipe is. I marinate the beef overnight in the fridge, and then toss on the grill. They're always a hit.

I've made this quite a few times over the years and it's got to be my favourite for beef skewers. Only modification is I make it a little less spicy.

Delicious. No alterations. Beware, this is not for the faint of heart. The Hubs and I  LOVE spicy and this is about the top of our tolerance, but the flavor is amazing.

I made these for a birthday party a few years ago and they were a hit.  The only thing I changed was I used the beef bouillon base instead of the packets.  I like the simple ingredients but you can always add

Made it as written except cut back the Cayenne to 1.5 tsp. due to tummy issues, but should've cut it back to 1!  Family loved it as is!  I'm a wimp.

Definitely a keeper. Changes: Used 1/4 cup water, only 1 cube bouillon, 1tsp cayenne and added the oil to the marinade. It was really really good and the meat was tender!!! Very happy. It wasn't as spicy as I like so next time I'll add the other 1 tsp of cayenne. I skewered with g/r/y bell peppers. Served with sour cream and fajita tortillas per other reviewers suggestions..... so good!! We call them Fajita Kabobs!!  My husband actually said "that was pretty good!!! You made this marinade?!" multiple times and he hardly ever comments on my cooking.

I've made this at least 4 x over the years and every time everyone loved it except for today.  Today I made it as written and everyone thought it was too hot, except my daughter.  Now the problem is, did I just marinade it longer than I had in the past (3.5 hrs) or had I reduced the amount of cayenne in the past.  Not sure, because when I read reviews of people saying it's too spicy I will usually tone it down a bit.  Also the 1st time I made this I served with pita and yogurt sauce.  This time just skewered with veggies.

Goos stuff, husband said these are good about 5 times then said, "I'm going to eat the rest of those if you're not." I used 1/2 the cayenne, substituted flat iron steak. Still pretty spicy!

Great marinade for the meat! One note when making your grocery list, the recipe doesn't call for any bell peppers, onions, or other "kebab" ingredients, so keep that in mind when meal planning.

Made 2 versions of this (hot, mild) for a BBQ this past weekend and people went nuts over it. The hot followed the recipe exactly and the mild had only 2 cloves garlic and 1/2 tablespoon of cayenne (still fairly spicy to those who don't have tolerance for spice). The only thing is that the kabobs came out really salty - will half the amount of beef bouillon next time. Used top sirlion that had been blade tenderized (from Costco) - worked perfectly. Served with roasted fingerling potatoes and a pasta salad.

This one is a winner! I've made it twice and love it! I do have to cut back on the cayenne because it is a little too spicy for my son. I also use olive oil instead of vegetable oil because of preference.

Appropriately named because these really were awesome.  I was a little concerned about the amount of cayenne, so I did cut that in half, but left the black pepper as written.  This turned out to be the perfect amount of heat for us.  Not sure why, but I haven't made beef kebabs for years, but they'll be making a repeat appearance often moving forward.  Thanks Eating Indy for a delicious recipe.

This is one of our favorite summer recipes. My hubby just dips his meat in a cucumber yogurt sauce we get at Target (Archer Farms), but I prefer it either in a pita with tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions and that sauce, or on a salad with cucumber dressing.

Good flavor but too spicy and that was after I reduced the cayenne. We like spicy but this made it hard to taste the rest of the meal. Will use 1/4 cayenne next time and make sure to serve it with a cool fruit such as pineapple or mandarin oranges and rice.  Very easy though so we will make again. Thanks!

Even better the next day! I used half the cayenne as recommended (and I love spice) and it was plenty.  Whipped up some low fat sour cream + garlic powder for dipping.  Veggies marinated in the same spicy marinade could have soaked for less time as they were also spicy.  Only left it in for two hours.

5 stars if you like heat, I doubled the recipe and followed exactly (without adding salt) and it was great! 6 people ate everything. I recommend serving this with a cooling cucumber sauce like raita to counter act the spice. will definitely make again!!

These were delish!! I cut back on cayenne to about 3/4 tsp, and I'm glad I did.

We used filet mignon for our kabobs and only 3/4 tsp of cayenne (we just aren't fans of really spicy food).  Other than that, I didn't change a thing...and it was FABULOUS.  Probably some of the best steak I've ever had.  The following day I chopped up the leftovers and made soft tacos with the meat...also AMAZING.  This recipe is a keeper.

Love these!  I cut back on the cayenne pepper as my family does not like things too spicy.  That was the only change I made and was pleased with this marinade.

I keep cubed meat frozen so night before I added ingredients and it defrosted/marinated. So good!

This is an excellent kabob recipe.  We cut the cayenne in half because of the kids, but it was still delicious.

Everyone enjoyed this recipe, I'll make it again for sure. Plus, it's a great way to stretch out the steak on a budget!

Whoa!!!  THis was GOOD!  I took the suggestion to cut the cayenne pepper in half, but ended up marinating the meat longer than called for (for about 4 hours).  The meat was very spicy, but absolutely delicious.  The sour cream and onion were perfect with it.  I served it on warmed Greek pita bread.  The next time I make it, I will use a lower sodium bouillon (because this was a bit on the salty side), use 1/4 of the cayenne pepper, but will marinate it for 4 hours.  The meat came out so tender!   I wish I had bought more steak, because I'd make it again tomorrow!!!

We made this for some friends and it was a hit with everyone!  I made half with less heat and it was still spicy.  I paired it with the Jasmine Rice recipe from this site as someone else suggested.  It was a fun meal.  We'll definitely do it again!

This is the first recipe I've made off this website and it was awesome! I took the others advice and used 1/2 the cayenne pepper. It was still very spicy. I liked it, my husband wants me to use a little less next time. We have to BBQ an item for a golf tournament coming up and I'm going to make this! I know everyone will love it

Too much cayenne pepper for me. I think it overwhelmed the flavors. I will definitely make again but use half of the cayenne pepper, maybe even less
