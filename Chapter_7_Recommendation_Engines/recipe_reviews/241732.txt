This was very tasty, and had that `hmm whats that i taste`` flavor to it! I loved the warming effect the nutmeg had on the sauce. I used about 1.5 pounds of ground beef, upped the cloves of garlic to 4, added salt and pepper to taste, used about 1 tablespoon of oregano, used 2 stalk of celery, and the mushrooms. I didn't bother with the sugar or baking soda (because i didn't feel the need to) My tomato can was only 796 ml so i added in 3 chopped fresh tomatoes as well. Also swapped monterey jack cheese for the Parmesan. I cooked my beef first and then drained the fat and set aside, while i cooked the vegetables. Also `waked up`the tomato paste a bit in the pan with the vegetables before adding the beef back in and the tomatoes. GREAT dish, thanks for sharing!!!

I always put baking soda in my sauce but I cook it with the tomato sauce and tomato paste first let cook for 20 minutes then ad all the other stuff. Works a hole lot better that way. Hope some one will give it a try.

Will definitely be making again. Only thing I didnt do was add parm as Iâ€™m not a big lover of the flavour. I served it with meatballs and some tiger bread. Amazing. My girlfriend loved it too!!

Substituted yellow bell pepper for celery. Added more garlic. Used 1/4 c red wine. Used pinch  of allspice instead of nutmeg.

i made this recipe and found it lacked flavor.  i used insalted diced tomatoes.  so i added hot sauce, wocestershire sauce, marjoram flakes, shredded asiago and chili powder.  turned out great.   guess i can't call it spaghetti sauce anymore lol
