This is one of our family favorites and one we make often.  One thing I have learned is to put all the dressing ingredients in the blender and puree' instead of trying to finely chop the onion and wisk everything together.  MUCH easier!  In the winter time when strawberries are out of season (or just for a change), I use a can or two of mandarin oranges instead of strawberries.  Crumbled feta cheese is also good on this salad if you like feta and crushed walnuts are a good (and cheaper) substitute for the almonds if you don't have almonds on hand.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was a big winner.  Small modifications to the original:

Cut the sugar down to ¼ cup.
Add a few turns of fresh ground pepper
Use balsamic vinegar.
Use red onion.
Add some fresh bacon bits
Add a mix of blue cheese and feta cheese.
Also, do not mix the dressing in with greens, as it will only wilt the salad.  Just apply as normal dressing.  Mixing in the dressing and letting it sit I think would make it too ‘limpy’.  

We put a few red onion slices on top with the cheese and bacon.  It was great.  The sweetness of the dressing would have been excessively much at ½ cup of sugar.  This we will make again and again and again.

This is great but substitue balsamic vinegar for white,  purple onions instead of white then add blueberries and bananas to the strawberries and it's to die for.

This salad is so tasty, specifically the dressing is out of this world delishhh.  It is important to chill the dressing for a bit after mixing the ingredients together so that they blend with eachother well and mix well right before pouring it on the salad.  My advice is not to skip the onion even if you don't like them because they play an important role in the taste of the dressing.  You can hardly taste them in the dressing as the onion taste is not the dominant taste but they play an important role in marrying the sugar and vinegar together to create the specific taste this dressing has.  For mine I halved the amount of sugar and it still came out super.  I love the strawberries in the salad, but if you don't have them they can also be substituted for other fruits such as pineapple, oranges, or apples.  A+  :)

I have prepared this two ways:  hot and cold.  Fried and crumbled bacon, then added all dressing ingredients till sugar dissolved.  Pour this hot dressing over spinach/strawberries:  outa this world!  Also delicious prepared cold.  Adding chicken chunks and kiwi is another wonderful variation for a complete, colorful meal in a bowl!

This is a unique and delicious salad. I brought this to a barbecue and everyone loved it. Sounded a bit odd to me at first - but it is wonderful. I omitted the poppy seeds, and toasted the sesame seeds to bring out their flavor. Also, I substituted chopped pecans for the almonds (just because I happened to have them in the cupboard) AND added a little crumbled BLUE CHEESE (approx. 1/4 cup). Delicious! Friends are still talking about it - and already asking me to make it again.

This is a great recipe. If strawberries are not in season, use mandarin orange segments or pineapple tidbits. It is also good with some grilled chicken added to the salad.

Excellent - not a drop was left in the bottom of the serving bowl.  Caution: don't pour the dressing on until serving time; the spinach will wilt after being in contact with the dressing for 20 minutes or so.

I cheated and used bottled fat free raspberry vinaigrette. I also replaced the almonds with candied pecans, and added 1/4 cup thinly sliced red onions and 3 tbsp cup crumbled blue cheese.  Coat the salad in dressing very sparingly or it becomes too wet and don't add dressing to the salad until just before serving or it will wilt into a mess.  My very picky teenagers loved this salad and demanded it make a regular appearance at the dinner table every week!

This was a delightful salad, but do NOT put the ingredients in a blender as 1 reviewer suggested or you will end up with a thick paste.  I forgot that too much mixing of oil will turn it to a solid and we literally had to spread the dressing on our salad servings because it was not pourable.

This salad has great contrasts between soft and crunchy and sweet and sour.  We made this for a family reunion.  My husband's cousin is very very picky and NEVER eats salad (not manly enough!).  He ate so much I had to make another batch!  His wife could not believe her eyes!  A way to get fresh vegies and fruit into her husband!  One suggestion, though, is to cut the sugar down by about half. The dressing is very sweet.  If you use good fresh strawberries you don't need so much sugar in the dressing.****UPDATE*****  Here it is 4  years later and I'm still making this salad for family reunions by special request!  One thing I have tweaked in the recipe, though, is lessening the sugar and serving both the nuts and the dressing on the side.  If you dress the salad and are lucky enough to have leftovers, it's inedible!

Unlike everyone else, I was not very impressed with this salad or dressing.  I used frozen strawberries and didn't chill-- maybe these are the reasons for my disappointment.

Added crumbled feta, candied walnuts (whip egg white with sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg then add nuts and bake until golden stirring once), and used rice wine vinegar in the dressing.  It was delicious, everyone at our party wanted the recipe.  We had enough spinach to make the salad again the next night, but used mandarin oranges instead of strawberries. . .I think I liked the oranges better!  Yum!!

Ashamed to admit I am finally reviewing this after making it so many times.  The recipe is wonderful, but I found the flavor is enhanced by using balsamic vinegar in place of the white vinegar and reducing the sugar to taste.  Helpful Hint:  Toasting the sesame seeds brings out their natural flavor significantly.  Have used mandarin oranges, raspberries, and green onions in this and each time it's wonderful.  Always a plus to have a recipe in your arsenal that allows for quick modifications to what's on hand.  Definitely a hit Tozenuf; thanks for sharing!

Tripled the recipe for a large Easter gathering with the following changes:  

1.  Substituted shelled sunflower seeds for the almonds (due to nut allergies).  2.  Toasted the sesame seeds.  3.  Used red onions.  4.  Used white wine vinegar 5.  Added mandarin oranges for color.  6.  Substituted "spring mix" for 1/2 the spinach.  And, based on other reviews.. 7.  Used a little more than 1/2 the amount of sugar.  8.  Made dressing ahead, but did not refrigerate.  9.  Used about 3/4 of the dressing (set the rest out, but nobody took any).  10.  Added dressing immediately prior to serving.  

It was a BIG hit!  Not only beautiful salad, but it tasted great.  In fact, one picky vegetarian asked to take the extra dressing home to use as a marinade on some veggies.

Dressing is sweet and delicious. Salad is a great mix. I added matchstick carrots and dried cranberries. WOW! It was sooo... good. Nice presentation with the red strawberries and green spinach leaves.  I will be making this dressing for other salads too.  Dyann

Abyway, this is a good combination of ingredients and flavors. Enjoy!!

Absolutely wonderful!  Great mix of flavors and textures!  Spinach is a pretty hearty leaf - you don't need to worry about it getting 'wilty' as others have said.

I have been making this for years but with slight changes. For the dressing I use cider vinegar instead of white and also a minced clove of garlic. Lightly toasted walnuts and shredded sharp cheddar cheese with the spinach make this WONDERFUL! I have also used a mixture of bllueberries and strawberries for color. Even kids gobble this up and I have never had any left after a potluck!

Not that this needs another review...but I need to say, I do not like salad, nor do I like spinach.  I ate two HUGE plates of this!!!!!!!  This is quite possibly the best thing I have ever put into my mouth!  Ha!  I added blue cheese and feta cheese crumbles, and fresh crunchy bacon on top of ours with some walnuts as well as some sliced red onion.  This is out of this world!

This is soooo good. I did not use sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or almonds. Boyfriend is allergic to everything. My mother came over the next day to ask me if I had any more salad. Make sure you use onion in the dressing. I make this kind of dressing all the time for other salads. I even add a couple tablespoons of Peanut Butter and a tablespoon of Soy Sauce for an oriental dressing. THIS IS GOOD!!!!!  Use apple cider vinegar, it's yummy. Thanks for the recipe.

This was so good everyone loved it!  I changed a couple of things in it due to some suggestions.  Used Balsamic Vinegar and cut the sugar to 1/8  cup. With the strawberries, I added oranges, pineapple and banana's. I also didn't put the dressing on the salad.  I let everyone put their own on.  Would make again!  As a side note, I had extra dressing and marinated some chicken in it and then grilled them...it was wonderful!!

This is my go-to salad for pot luck lunches/dinners in the summer. I must have made it about 10 times this summer. I follow the recipe exactly and I get raves about it. People are constantly asking for the recipe. Thanks!

Excellent recipe with one small exception; too much sugar. The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was o.k., but it was just WAY too sweet. The second time I put only half the amount of sugar called for and it was perfect. Also, I substituted balsamic vinegar for the distilled white vinegar and I used half olive oil and half canola oil (since olive oil is so expensive) and it turned out superb! With some minor tweaking, this recipe makes the perfect strawberry salad!

The salad is great as is, but I like to add about 1/2 cup of feta cheese to give it a little kick.

This is really good with a few minor adjustments. I used shallots instead of onion in the dressing, and only used 1/4 cup of sugar (which I think could be reduced even further, if you like less sweet dressings). The dressing had a really nice flavor. I added some sugared walnuts and craisins to the salad along with pan fried chicken slices and the sliced strawberries... all on top of baby spinach. Would have also been good with crumbled feta cheese. All in all, a very good, simple recipe.

Delicious!  I made a few changes to the dressing based on other reviews:  toasted the sesame seeds first to make them more flavorful; omitted the poppy seeds because I didn't have any on hand; used balsamic instead of white vinegar; reduced the sugar to about a tablespoon.  The strawberries are naturally sweet on their own, balsamic vinegar is sweeter than white vinegar, and I also added some pecans that I carmelized in a hot pan with a sprinkle of sugar, so with all that sweetness, I didn't want the dressing to be too sugary-sweet.  For the salad, I used baby spinach (I think it tastes better in salads than regular spinach leaves and it also looks prettier), sliced strawberries, blue cheese crumbles, and the pecans.  The dark green of the spinach and the bright red of the strawberries makes for such a nice presentation.  Brought it to a dinner party & it was a huge hit!

This is a definate keeper.  I make it for special occasions, a couple of times a year.  It is festive looking and delicious.  However, could NOT get my 8 and 6 year old sons to eat it.  Reduced the oil by just a little bit.  The seasame seeds, paprika and worstershire all add a nicely to the flavour of the dressing.  Didn't have poppy seeds on hand.

We love the sweetness of this salad - it's wonderful!  I brought it to a potluck dinner and was complimented several times.  I'd have to say it makes more than 4 servings... unless this is to be served as a main dish meal.

I think I must have done something wrong with the dressing.  The sugar never dissolved in the oil and my family and friends pretty much found the salad inedible because it was too sweet.  I fixed the dressing in the morning and whisked and whisked - the sugar didn't dissolve.  So, I let the dressing sit until lunch time - still didn't dissolve.  I figured it was supposed to be that way and served it.  Not a good choice!  Any suggestions?

This salad is delicious when made right -  But it makes more dressing than you need for the amount of greens and berries and calls for a LOT of sugar!! I used 1/4 c oil, 1Tablespoon of sugar, 2 Tb vinegar, 1 Tb. Worcestershire, pinch of paprika, 2 tsp poppy seeds, 1/2 tsp. salt and a sprinkle of onion powder. I use honey glazed sliced almonds for salads, you can find at the grocery store. I don't use sesame seeds.

This is my go-to item to bring to potlucks, showers, you name it, and I always get rave reviews.  I did take some reviews into account, and use red onion for the dressing and salad instead of white onion, adding a handful of blue cheese crumbles, and reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup.  My special touches include using candied pecans for the nuts and using 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar plus 2 tablespoons of RASPBERRY WINE VINEGAR instead of white vinegar.  The berry vinegar balances the balsamic, and complements the strawberries perfectly.  It's do-ahead-able, portable, healthy and delicious--a perfect recipe!

Best Salad I have had in a long while. I have a sweet tooth and cut the sugar by half and it was perfect. I also used half distilled white vinegar and half balsamic (I hate when people go to far off the recipe and completely make a new recipe but i love balsamic). A definite keeper!!

I made this for my husband and me for our little Easter dinner-for-two and we LOVED it.  Of course, it makes too much for one meal so I didn't dress it all at once, but kept the ingredients separate and chilled for another dinner! Yum!

Awesome! I only use 1/4 C sugar, it is plenty. Took to potluck and everyone wanted this recipe. The dressing as written handles 2 bags of spinach in my opinion, just make sure it is tossed and sets of the 15 minutes. A friend told me she uses no sugar, her family likes it better that way. Don't know if I'd go that far.....

This recipe is amazing!  I hardly ever take the time to review recipes here but I just had to get on and say something about this one.  I do a tablespoon of sugar instead of 1/2 cup because I don't like the dressing that sweet.  I also throw in some crumbled goat cheese and it's to die for!

OMG I'm not a salad eater but I'm really trying to eat healthy so I decided to make this last night.  WOW WOW WOW.  I love this salad.  The dressing was SOOOOO GOOD!!!  I did as other reviewers mentioned and subbed the white vinegar for balsamic vinegar.  I added just a 1/4 cup sugar and it was still nice and sweet. Not a sesame seed person so omitted it and the onion.  I added feta cheese and pecans and it is to die for.  I will be making this often.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

Like others, I suggest adding fresh pepper, feta, and/or candied almonds. I also agree that the dressing tastes better when the sugar is reduced by as much as a half.  More importantly, I advise you to cut the portions in half, or more.  The portions are absolutely huge, even for grown men.  Like most salads, this does not keep well, and it is such a shame to spend time and money on food that's thrown away...

I've made this salad several times and each time it's a hugh hit. I tried to double it once and it was way too much spinach and dressing. I think it would work better to use the same amount of dressing and just add another 1/2 bag of spinach for a 8-10 servings.

This recipe was great, but I think that next time I would cut down on the dressing or add more spinach.  I'm not use to that much dressing.  Otherwise very, very tasty   Thanks  Teresa

What a fantasic salad!  I made this for Easter a year or two ago and ever since, my family has begged me to bring it to all our family gatherings.  Really easy and tasty.  If you like more "stuff" in your salad I've added sliced onions and feta cheese successfully to this salad too - but it's great as is.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic Salad!! Hit at Mother's Day cookout. Beautiful and tasty!  Be sure to NOT put the dressing on too soon before serving. One of my all-time favorite salads!

I have no idea why this was so delicious, but it was!  I followed others' advice and used balsamic for the vinegar, reduced the sugar by almost half, used red onion, and added a clove of garlic.  I made the dressing the night before, and was glad that I did.  It tasted a lot better the second day.  Served with a sprinkle of blue cheese.  This would make an amazing entree salad with some grilled chicken.

I think this recipe is great.  I don't use quite as much sugar in the dressing and usually add some leftover grilled chicken.  What a tasty and simple salad.

This is a delicious recipe that my daughter made for us on her college break. She found it on your site while looking for a different salad to make. This was so good that when she came home recently my husband asked her to buy the ingredients again to make it for us. A real treat!

INCREDIBLE!!!  I was very skeptical of the strawberries in this recipe, maybe adding a little too much sweetness wit the sugar.  BOY WAS I WRONG!!  I cut the sugar in 1/2 and both my husband and I agree, it was sweet enough for us (our strawberries were very sweet!).  I'll definitely be making this again, soon with a grilled chicken breast split between the two salads to round-out a meal!

A bit sweet, but overall a good variant of a poppy seed dressing.  I used red onion and processed it in a blender with all but the seeds, then added them last.  The red onion made a pink sauce which darkened a bit with the other ingredients. It added a nice touch with the red strawberries.

Excellent, easy salad.  I halved the sugar as many reviewers recommended.  We served buffet-style, so I gave diners a choice of quartered strawberries, mandarin orange segments or both.  Was well-liked by all.

This has been a huge hit with everyone I have made it for. I use 1/4 cup of sugar, balsamic vinegar instead of white, and red onion. Add a little feta cheese on top - perfection.

This salad was delicious, but made way too much dressing!  Your salad will definitely be soggy the next day.  Next time I will serve the dressing on the side.  I also cut back to 1/4 c. sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Love the seeds in this... mmm...  EDIT:  Still making this salad and loving it!  I now add mandarin oranges and serve the dressing on the side.  Received many compliments from my friends!

Very good! Only complaint, I should have added a little more spinach, or a little less dressing. maybe that's because the spinach I used was short 1 oz.

great recipe, used it today (4th of July) and had the strawberries, feta cheese and blueberries-very festive and the taste was outstanding.  I did use balsimic vinegar instead of white vinegar.

My husband's comments:  "I don't usually like fruit in my salads but this is really good."  10 stars for that!!  lol  The dressing was simple, quick and easy.  It was a little on the sweet side so next time, I'll cut the sugar by half or just use splenda.  The hardest thing was mincing the onion so I cheated and used my grater.  I forgot almonds at the grocery so I toasted sesame seeds and put those on the salad too.  Yum, yum, yum.  Can't wait to take another reader's advice and try it with other berries.  My kids didn't care for it but to them, McD's is a gourmet meal.  :)

I took this to our potluck for church and people were talking and asking for the recipe! It went super fast.  The dressing is what makes this salad. The dressing seemed like such a weird combination on paper that I was skeptical. I cut out the almonds (personal preference) and didn't use the poppy seeds because I didn't have any on hand.  If there wasn't something missing, I couldn't tell. It was FABULOUS!  I brought the dressing in a separate container and poured over the salad right before the food was going to be served.  I would recommend others do the same or else it will be a soggy mess after a while. I will DEFINITELY be making this again.

I substituted Splenda for the sugar. This is an excellent dish that is quick to prepare. I brought the ingredients to work, with the dressing in a bottle. Assembled it for lunch and everyone loved it.

This was absolutely fabulous!  I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  My husband ate seconds and thirds and raved about it.  He has never done that with a salad before.  The dressing makes quite a bit and so I had to add extra spinach with it and next time I will probably add even more spinach or just not put in all of the dressing.  Overall it was a relatively easy salad to prepare.  I also made up the dressing the night before to save time before the party began.  Very good recipe!

I thought the dressing made the salad taste too sharp, the strawberries tasted really sweet though. I would use a different vinegar the next time, maybe balsamic in a smaller quantity.

DELICIOUS! This is my new favorite salad recipe! The combination of sweet strawberries, a tangy vinagrette, and crunchy almonds made this salad  wonderfully unique. If you enjoy this recipe you may also enjoy Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad also found on this website.

Very good. Made it with chicken and it was just the right side salad. I also decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup and used balsamic vinegar. Will definitely be making this again.

I thought the salad itself was good but the dressing was way, way too sweet.  Based on other reviews I only used half the sugar but it was still too sweet.  I had to add more oil and vinegar to mellow to sugar out.  If I were to make it again I would only use about a Tbs of sugar...after all, its salad not desert.  Also, I used Balsamic Vinegar the first go.  When I added more vinegar to mellow the sugar I used Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar.  (that stuff is great in salad dressing and goes really well with strawberries.)

Made this for my office picnic.  It was a big hit. Used half of the sugar as recommended by other reviewera.  I also added some dried cherries.  Will add some carrots next time just to add a little color.  I am sure this made the food request list for the office

A wonderful recipe to use when strawberries are in season.  I used green onion and 1/3 cup of sugar and instead of all spinach I used a variety of baby spinach, romaine and leaf lettuce.  The dressing was very tasty.

Great combo of flavors and textures.  Used balsamic instead of white vinegar.  Reduced olive oil to 1/4c. And only used 2 tblspns of a no sugar substitute such as Ideal.  Plenty sweet! Excellent salad. Thanks!

Delicious and healthy! I love the combination of crunchy nuts with fresh fruits and veggies. I used 1/4 c sugar and that was more than sweet enough for my tastes. I also used a can of mandarin slices as I was out of strawberries. I used cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. Nice!

I toasted the sesame seeds first.. not sure that it makes any difference in flavor.  Also will use baby spinach for company next time as it is more tender and less time-consuming pulling stems.  great flavor and beautiful spring salad.

Looks like such a simple salad, but the flavors pack a punch.  Used balsamic in place of white vinegar.  Halved the oil and used only 2 Tbsp sugar.  Made this for brunch and just made another batch for dinner because it was such a hit!

Even though I didn't follow this recipe word for word or step by step, it's ingredients really inspired me.  I rated this recipe with five stars for the inspiration it provided.  It was absolutely delish!  I tossed the spinach in one part balsamic vinaigrette to one part fresh squeezed orange juice.  I added the sliced strawberries also adding some orange bell pepper which this recipe didn't call for.  The bell pepper and strawberries together tasted amazing.  I had a friend say that it tasted like summertime.  I also put the sunflower seeds in and that added a nice crunch.

Salad was good, but it was very sweet.  Not a healthy salad at all.

I made this the other night for my hubby and his buddy and all 3 of us LOVED it!! The dressing is so delicious and the combination of the spinach and strawberries was amazing. I had walnuts and not almonds so thats the only thing I did different and it was still delectable!

This was a pretty good summer salad.  I did not have the seasame and poppy seeds so I did not put them in the salad.  It was still really good but next time I will try it with the seeds. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious.  Added sliced almonds for added taste and texture.  The dressing seemed like it was going to be too sweet, but tasted wonderful mixed with the spinach and strawberries.

This made an awesome salad!  It was SOOO good even my kids loved it!  I think it would of been even better with more strawberries/almonds though and maybe toss the dressing with the spinach then top with strawberries/almonds as these fell to the bottom when tossing the whole salad...

The dressing for this is fabulous. It made *way* too much for the amount of greens, though. I made as is and after it sat for about 15 minutes, it was too wet. *BUT* it's delicious and I'll definitely be making it again and again, just with a little less dressing! I'll also cut the sugar in half. Thanks for a great recipe.

A beautiful and delicious salad perfect for celebrating spring. I use baby spinach and balsamic vinegar, cut the sugar in half, and toasted the almonds. For an alternate when strawberries aren't in season, I substitute diced just-ripe pear and add crumbled gorgonzola. So refreshing! I get many requests for this recipe.

Husband and I are big salad eaters.  I was excited to try this recipe after seeing all the rave reviews.  I made the recipe as written (it's one of my pet peeves for reviewers to change the recipe and rate their  changes...grrr!).  I thought the salad was OK, but nothing spectacular.  Husband did not like it at all.  He didn't even try to finish it out of "politeness".   :(

My husband told me the salad was the best part of the meal & that's saying a lot coming from him. YUM!! I didn't want to deal with an fresh onion so I used onion powder. Next time I will probably try fresh onion & less sugar.

I learned if you want more flavour. 
Mix  together the ingredients for the dressing first and then put it in fridge for an hour. Cut up Strawberry and spinach. Then toast the almond sliver. After an hour put the dressing and the salad together and toss it and then put back in the fridge for over night so it can soak up the flavour. It is really good. I prefer to make it the night before for the sweetness to come out.

Delicious!  Make ahead tip - make dressing the day before.  Seems thick, but works out fine.  I substitued "balsamic vinegar" for the white vinegar.  Used "candied" pecans and added bits of bacon.  Very sweet so not a lot of dressing required.

Absolutely wonderful! I will make this many many more times. I did add a bit too much dressing so it was sweeter then I would have liked but still excellent. I will just be careful how much dressing I add next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

After reading the reviews, I decided to use honey instead of sugar to tone down the sweetness of the dressing.  I also used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar and added a little feta cheese.  I served the dressing on the side as my husband and I usually use very little dressing on our salads.  It made a perfect summer salad.  Everyone loved it.

Always a winner, topped with some chopped pecans and feta cheese. The dressing is best if you make it ahead a few hours to enable the flavors to blend. We just let each guest drizzle the dressing on their own salad instead of mixing it all in, that way any leftover salad can still be eaten later on.

Wow this was good! ~ LOVED THE DRESSING~  Not sure if I cut back on the sugar or not since I was just making this for myself and eyeballing the ingredients.  Thanks so much and can't wait to make for the family!

I just made the salad twice this week. Both times I got great compliments. Everyone loved the dressing - I took the suggestion of others and used balsamic vinegar and decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup. I also sugar coated my almonds.

This is an awesome salad, even for people who don't usually go for spinach. I make it exactly according to this recipe when strawberries are in season, and with pomegranate when they're not. It's also great with some grilled chicken added.

This one deserves 10 stars in my book. Everyone I know who cooks has tried different strawberry salad recipes, and nobody's found one that is this well balanced in flavor. The homemade vinaigrette is easy to make and really soaks the flavor of the strawberry fast. The almonds of course are a perfect compliment, but I find myself adding a few.  Anyway, I have yet to have tasted a strawberry salad this good!

Just made this for Friday night dinner and it turned out great! I was a little hesitant about the dressing because of the sesame and poppy seeds, but put them in anyway and it was fine. I did use only 1/3 cup of the olive oil and a few tablespoons of the sugar. Also, I didn't feel the need to add any extra fruit. The salad was great as is and very simple.

Another yum from me!  I have found you can play around a bit with the vinegars (I have used combinations of white, apple cider, and red wine vinegars) and have not found a "bad" combination yet.  I also cut down on the sugar to about half.  My husband and I love it!  Also a tip we do:  We keep this in a salad dressing container on the side and everyone adds the amount they prefer, no wilted greens this way.  If you can't then add the dressing right before serving.  I have also found this makes plenty of dressing, so keep that in mind as you may prefer less on your greens.

great salad and still deserves 5 stars, with some slight modifications i made.  first, 1/2 the amount of sugar is plenty.  also, i toasted the sesame seeds and slivered almonds beforehand for an added flavor which really brings out the nutty flavors and gives the dressing and the salad a little something different.  i would also recommend chilling the salad and the dressing separately and then tossing just before serving so that the strawberries and almonds still hold their crunch.

I started making this salad last summer and now **have** to bring it whenever there is a gathering with friends or family.  Everyone goes nuts for it!  Before trying it I had never eaten spinach in my life (SPINACH...NUH UH, NO WAY, YUCK!!).But this is hands down the best salad I've ever eaten. I've tweaked it a bit...I often use mandarin orange wedges instead of stawberries.  Also, I candy the almonds by carmelizing them with a bit of sugar. I then spread them out on a pc. of wax paper that has been sprayed with PAM.  Once they cool, you just crack 'em up and add to the salad.  This makes the salad even sweeter so I use a bit less sugar in the dressing as well. YUM!!

Although im not a chef I would offer these tips to those that have had a problem with desolving the sugar in the dressing. First use a good quality honey and second try desolving the sugar in the vinagar before adding the oil.

I brought this for a pot-luck lunch at work and received requests for the recipe from virtually everyone. It was so easy to make ahead of time, just needing to mix the dressing and salad mixin's at the last minute. I've since made it for family gatherings and even the people who don't think they like spinach salad love it!!!

This salad looks and tastes wonderful.  However, I will cut down on the dressing and be sure to use extra virgin olive oil next time I make it.

This is an awesome summer salad recipe that I'm sure I will make quite a few times while strawberries are sweet and abundant!  I did find, however, that it was not necessary to use the full amount of dressing.  I tossed the salad with approximately 3/4 of the prepared dressing and served the remainder at the table...but no one needed it.

First time I have made this and turned out great! It was for a birthday party and I placed it in a trifle bowl! Turned out so pretty! I added blueberries, feta cheese and crumbles of bacon! Everyone loved it! Will certainly make again!

I reviewed this recipe 6 years ago. I had made it for my twin daughters' baptism and adults and children both LOVED it.So easy to make and ecomonical too. Just made it again for their First Communion dinner and made at least 6 copies of the recipe to everyone who requested it. So yummy!! Only change I made was to use balsamic vinegar.

This is hands down the best salad I have ever eaten in my life.  Never before, have I been so "WOWED" by a salad.  I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time, I used minced onion seasoning rather than a real onion.  It was still delicious, but it was more flavorful when I used a real onion the second time.  I didn't have poppy seeds either time, so I'm not sure what I'm missing out on there.  The magic of the dressing really comes to life after letting it chill for a full hour.  All of the flavors fuse and combine to produce something totally different than what was place in fridge an hour earlier. I give this recipe an A+++!  

Question for the community, which is better for this recipe: olive oil or extra virgin olive oil?

Excellent recipe. For a more substantial variation add a piece of grilled salmon and some goat cheese-a great main dish salad. I often switch out the spinach for romaine and/or other greens. One of my favorite recipes from this site.

The best salad I ever had.  The dressing is amazing, I followed some suggestions and cut the sugar in half.  The second time i made it i forgot this step and was to sweet for my taste.  I also added feta cheese.

Oh bless you, Tozenuf!  It seems like we're barbequing every other nite now and I've been SO tired of the same old side dishes.  Made exactly as directed and ... sheer heaven!  Kind of a cross between a salad and dessert!  Light, refreshing - simply perfect!

I made this for a Mother's Day Salad luncheon at church, and it was one of the first salads to be demolished!  I had a lady come up to me days later and ask if that was my salad and when I said yes, she confessed she went back 3 times for more!

We used only 1/8 C sugar and it was still pretty sweet - no need for anymore than that! Stuck with the white vinegar and it tasted great. Definitely wait to put the dressing on the salad and definitely add some cheese (we went with feta). Also added some red onion and went with walnuts instead of almonds. Very versatile recipe.

Wanted a quick healthy summer lunch & this did the trick.  Also added some real bacon bits but had fresh blueberries & fresh mushrooms, so put them in too.  Didn't make the dressing-put in fresh lemon juice & a touch of my favorite low carb dressing.  Spinach with the fruit was very good.  Next time I'll add walnuts.  Very versatile-use your imagination!

I used 1/3 cup of sugar, omitted the sesame seeds, used balsamic vinegar, and used chopped walnuts because I like them better. With these slight modifications, it turned out awesome. Even my kids loved it! Will definitely be making this a lot this summer!

This recipe makes a huge salad.  More than 4 servings IMO.  For the dressing, I used half the sugar and subbed out the white vinegar for red wine vinegar.  The dressing also could use some salt.  I think if I made it as printed I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.

Absolutely delicious! Made this as a side with blue cheese burgers for Memorial Day cookout. WOW! We did not have poppy seeds so we omitted that part and we will reduce the sugar next time but this salad was wonderful! The dressing was what made this salad so great. Thanks for this recipe!!

This salad is very good. I have had spinach and strawberry salads before that I didn't enjoy--they were always served with a bottled dressing that was too sweet. The dressing for this recipe is just sweet enough. At first I thought the worcestershire sauce would taste weird with it, but it enhanced the flavor and added to the dish.

UPDATE: I made this recipe as written and prefer the dressing with distilled vinegar instead of balsamic. It was delicious! I will make it like this from now on. I toasted the almonds for extra flavour. OLD REVIEW: This is a lovely salad. We really liked the texture of the slivered almonds and the sesame seeds. As suggested by another reviewer, I added balsamic vinegar instead of distilled vinegar and added sugar to taste. I also didn't have any poppy seed but we didn't miss it at all. I will definitely make this salad again. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Tozenuf!

Just had this salad for Easter - BIG hit! Made it pretty much according to directions but did cut back a bit on the sugar to about 1/3 cup - though we probably would have been fine with the 1/2 cup. I didn't have minced onion so I diced up a couple slices of fresh very fine. Also added some dried pineapple and sharp cheddar cheese to the salad. Since we eat a lot of spinach/Romaine - this salad dressing will become a staple at our house!
THANK YOU!!

Huge hit with kids and adults. I toasted the almonds which added to the flavor and made them a little crispy to add texture.

Made dressing as recipe states, with the exception of using splenda instead of sugar.. Using the blender to mix, as 1 reviewer stated, made ease.. used toasted walnuts.. I used to make this years ago but instead of paprika it used dry mustard.. This was excellent though!!  My 12 year old went ga-ga over it and wants it for dinner again tonight!!I placed dressing in a storage jar and refrigerated so I can make individual salads when I need.. This is one of those recipes that you mix it all together you either eat-it-all or waste-it-all... No reason to when you do it the single salad way.. 4 large group I would def. go with mix all and serve..  With the exchange of splenda 4 sugar this becomes much healthier and a low carb recipe!! It was awesome with the splenda.. Try it.. Thanx

This is really good - the dressing is amazing!  Only changes I made was dropped it down to a 1/4 cup sugar and I added Feta Cheese.  Great hit - everyone loved it at our business lunch.

I'm not a big salad person. If I were to eat a salad, it would have to come from Panera Bread, Crispers or sometimes Wendy's. Making a salad at home was completely out of the question. One day I wanted a restaurant type of salad and stumbled upon this recipe. Let me just tell you, this was the best find that I have ever found. This recipe is just perfect! The salad dressing for it turned out amazing and I absolutely hate Worcestershire sauce (can't even taste it in this salad). I did use less sugar and more almonds but it was still plenty sweet. Definitely recommended!!!

We loved this recipe.  My step-daughter and I made this together.  She has come cooking experience and I wanted her to have a little more so I was her "sous chef"  We had guests, so we doubled the spinach (baby, because I am lazy), strawberries and almonds (used sliced) but only made 1.5 the dressing.  Had plenty left over.  We did not dress the salad until right before serving and topped with feta cheese as suggested.  Her grandparents, who are pretty traditional eaters, really liked it as well.  I look forward to making it again. p.s.  My daughter is rapidly becoming an All-recipes.com addict like me!

substituted balsamic for white vinegar, cut the sugar in half, and used a small shallot or 1/2 large shallot finely chopped instead of white onion (emulsifies beautifully in mini-chopper), and added crumbled goat cheese (the tangy taste and creamy texture compliment the sweetness of the strawberries perfectly). A truly delicious salad that everyone will love!

This recipe is awesome.  I took it to a "salad supper" and everyone raved.  I was also asked for the recipe. I made the dressing, refrigerated it.  Then I mixed the spinach with the strawberries and took both in a cooler to the party.  I added the dressing upon serving.  I even forgot to add the almonds--it was still delicious.

I love spinach salad and this one ranks at the top of the list.  I followed others advice and cut down on the sugar by more than 1/2.  I used balsamic vinegar, which goes so well with the strawberries and added goat cheese.  The sweetness from the balsamic made up for the decrease in sugar.  It was a big hit with friends and my kids.

I made this salad for a BBQ and it was a huge hit! I followed the recipe but substituted Splenda for the sugar and pine nuts for almonds. I changed the number of servings to 10 thinking that would be enough for 15 people but it was waayyy more than enough and people even went back for seconds. Next time I would make enough servings for half of the amount of people. I would also try the basalmic and add cheese which I had but forgot. Delish!

This salad is very good as written, but as others have noted it is way too sweet. I made it again and cut the sugar in half, added a cup of crumbled feta cheese, and it was to die for! Five stars and highly recommended, just watch the sugar.

Fabulous recipe! The first time I made this, I toasted the sesame seeds and poppy seeds to bring out their flavor (definitely a must), added blue cheese, used toasted walnuts instead of toasted almonds (was out of almonds), and used 1/3 a cup of sugar. The second time I made this salad, I followed the recipe to a T. I will say that I definitely liked the first one more. Why? Well, 1/2 a cup of sugar is wayyy too much. Even with 1/3 or 1/4 cup of sugar, the dressing is sweet! Second of all, you gotta have some kind of crumbly cheese - blue and feta would work well. Third of all, you cannot refrigerate the salad dressing. I believe someone recommended that step, and in my opinion, they deserve a medal for that. If you refrigerate the salad dressing, it becomes a sugary, sesame seedy paste that is very hard to distribute evenly among the spinach leaves. Even though I prefer the salad with my variations, I still gave this recipe five stars because the original version is very tasty!

I have made this several times and always was asked to make it again.  I have added blueberries and feta cheese at times, and all ways have been good.  It is a lot of dressing if you want to cut it down a bit it would be ok.  Great salad for those who don't even like spinach!

I wasn't amazed at the dressing on this...it just tasted sweet - it really had no flavor. The almonds are a must on this salad. I used red onion sliced thinly and thought that it gave it a great flavor. Next time I will skip the dressing, and just add a raspberry vinegarette. I did love the spinach and strawberry together though.

My new favorite salad - and the dressing is wonderful for other salads too!

I followed the ingredient list and amounts as written but put it together a bit differently.  I used my vita-mix (blender) and put the sugar, worchestershire (sp???), paprika, onion, and vinegar in the container - then slowly streamed in the oil (I used a canola blend cause it's all I had) with the blender on medium.  Then I transfered it to a small container and stirred in the poppy and sesame seeds.  This really incorporated the ingredients and the dressing takes days to separate (and even then it's only a little bit).

I also used a head of leaf (Romaine the second time I made it) lettuce with the spinach and used a whole container of strawberries and eyeballed the almonds (probably used way more than called for - but was yummy).  I did not tear/cut the spinach but left "as is" from the bag.

It was a hit at the picnic I took it to.  We had to travel several hours to get there so I kept the cleaned, dried, and torn lettuce in a zip top bag.  I cleaned and cut the strawberries and kept separate.  Then I was able to put everything in the cooler and assemble the salad just before serving.

The leftovers did not keep - got very wilty very fast!

This is, by far, the best salad recipe I've tried. I'm a vegetarian and I've just about tried them all! My boyfriend's mother made this for me and got me hooked! If making this for a vegetarian or vegan, make sure to use a vegetarian Worcestershire sauce (one that does not include anchovies). Serve as a side dish or as a main dish. The best time for this salad is during the summer when fresh strawberries are affordable. I originally found this recipe on another site where it is instructed to puree the dressing in a blender, which works perfectly! This is the first recipe I've had where I didn't have to make any modifications to the ingredients.

I made this for our Canada Day BBQ and it was a cinch to make.  I wouldn't change anything except double the recipe because everyone keeps coming back for more!

What a great salad!  I looked like a real chef!  I used a tasty seasoned boursin cheese and it was delish!

Absolutely love this salad - it is delicious.  Every time I make it, I get rave reviews.  I do decrease the sugar by half, it is still plenty sweet.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Finally made this for Mother's Day and it was a great salad with a few adjustments. First, like many other reviewers have noted, don't use all of the sugar! I cut it to about 2 tablespoons and it was plenty sweet! I used a mixture of white wine and apple cider vinegar and cut the olive oil back to a little less than a 1/3 of a cup. The dressing seemed a little thin and on the bland side when it was done, so I took a leap and added a tablespoon of dijon mustard...gave it a little kick that was *really* great with the rest of the flavors and it helped coat the spinach well! Also, toasted sesame seeds are a *must* in this dressing! They give a great nutty flavor that's subtle and goes great with the strawberries! I also added a full tub of crumbled gorgonzola as some suggested and it was the perfect touch. Finally, don't dump all of the dressing onto this salad at once. In my opinion, the recipe made way too much dressing, so you're better off drizzling it a little at a time and tossing as you go until it's all coated to your taste. My salad would have been drowning in the dressing had I added all of it! I will definitely make this again and again, particularly in the summer time as it's a great dish to bring to outdoor gatherings (no mayo, sour cream, etc. to spoil in the sun!), not to mention beautiful to look at! :-) Thanks so much for the recipe!

One word.... AWESOME!  This was a big hit both times I have made it.  Today I printed out the recipe to hand out to friends.  I did leave out the sesame seeds though - just don't care for them.  I also cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup and found it plenty sweet.  I also used red onion.  It was so good.  I'm actually craving it right now.

Great salad!  I loved the mixtures of texture and flavor: soft/crunchy, sweet/sour.  The sugar didn't dissolve at all after chilling it.  Next time, I'll heat up the dressing and add fresh bacon crumbles as some suggested.

Woah! Do not add 1/2 cup of sugar, I did it as an experiement and yikes. I had to add a whole bunch more olive oil and a bit more viniger so i didn't choke on the sweetness of it. But Beautiful salad! I never cook or make anything, and my boyfriend loved it and well was suprised i made something haha. But really unless you love sugar, and like basically drinking a glass of it with a bit of water in it (that's what it tasted like) than go ahead! I should have heeded the reviews and added way less sugar. But I will totally make it again. Also added a lot more strawberries

This salad is so quick and easy and very yummy.  The strawberries add such a fresh taste and the dressing is just sweet enough to complement the strawberries.  My husband was skeptical before he tried it, but he quickly had seconds.  I will be making this again and again.

Thought it was wonderful but that it had more sugar in the dressing than was necessary.  The second time I made it I used a sugar substitute and it came out just as good.

I made this without changes, apart from using sunflower seeds because I couldn't find sesame seeds. It was really good, especially the dressing. Next time I'll add feta cheese as per my husbands suggestions, not to change the recipe it's great the way it is but just to try something new :-)

Excellent salad. I make this a few times a year and I'm always asked to bring it to family gatherings.  I never add the dressing until it is time to serve and I double the spinach because it coats very well.

HUGE Success!!  I changed it up a bit.  I cut up strawberries and put them in a ziplock.  I added 1/3 of the dressing and then put in fridge overnight.  When I plated the salad, I put down the spinach, added the strawberry mixture, almonds, sunflower seeds, two kiwi cut into small bite size pieces, and then added poppy seeds to the top.  The dressing on the strawberries was PLENTY!!   I can't tell you how wonderful this salad is!  You will love it!!!

This was amazingly delicious. Spinach and strawberry are always a fail-proof combination, but this dressing is something else. Didn't add poppy seeds, used less sugar, walnuts instead of almonds, a bit of reduced-fat feta cheese and substituted half of the olive oil for cold-pressed coconut oil. Turned out amazing, the coconut oil gave it a very subtle coconut flavor. Didn't measure any ingredients, just eyeballed everything - so it's very forgiving. Will make again and again. (Will try to use tahini instead of oil and dates instead of sugar to make it even more healthy!)

This was very good. I mixed in red leaf lettuce with the spinach, and used glazed walnuts instead of the almonds. A big hit!

YUM! This was SUPER deeelish!!! My husband and I hosted his family for a pre-Mother's Day BBQ feast. He smoked a pork roast and I prepared the sides. I chose this salad because it was simple to prepare and seasonally appropriate. This is by FAR one of the BEST summer salads - EVER! :) Although nearly perfect as is, I do have a few suggestions to make this even BETTER! As many reviewers suggest, the dressing is quite sweet. My sugar would not completely dissolve because there was just too much of it. I will definitely cut back by at least a quarter if not in half next time. I would also serve the dressing tableside. The dressing over-saturates the delicate spinach leaves, making them wilt (which wasn't too appealing). Now, here's what I did do and would recommend always doing. I toasted my sesame seeds and almond slivers. I toasted the latter in a little melted butter and then drained on a paper towel-lined plate to soak up the excess grease. This added a LOT of flavor (and color) to my salad. I also added a package of crumbled feta and think this is what made this salad sing! Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, TOZENUF. This was absolutely fantastic and loved by everyone (fruit-hating husband aside lol). :-)

I used Splenda and could have used a little less. Yummy!!!  I agree to let the dressing chill.

Made this after a trip to the city market, fresh spinach and strawberries. Had company for dinner and all liked it. Very pretty in the bowl on the table. might try pecans in it next time instead of almonds.

WAY TOO SWEET!   I have quite a sweet tooth but way too much sugar!   Wish I would have listened to other reviews that said to cut sugar by half but wanted to make as written.  I did add feta cheese which did help to offset the sweetness.   PLEASE start with half the sugar and add more if you think it needs it.  This is the first review I have written and am hoping it will help someone else.

I tried this salad for the first time a few weeks ago.  It is the beginning of a long term love affair for my husband and this salad.   We have had it twice since and he is crazy about it.   So easy and super tasty.

I made this recipe exactly to the recipe, and it was fantastic.  I did toast the poppy seeds and sesame seeds.  I took the spinach leaves to a party separately from the strawberries (didn't want the strawberries to wilt the spinach) and made the salad in a flash at the party.  Didn't need all of the dressing, so brought it home for use on other salads.  Fantastic mix of flavor.  Will definitely make again!

Amazing salad! I served this for Easter dinner at moms and it was gone before I could get a second helping! I admit, I was a little skeptical with the dressing when I first started making it. I mean there was alot of sugar in there, but when everything came together and I tried it, I was very surprized on the flavor combination. I always like trying new things, because you never know if your going to end up loving it. The salad is absolutely perfect as is and I wouldn't change a thing! Thank you!

Great way to eat & truly enjoy spinach. I used granulated Splenda to cut calories/carbs.  I think the olive oil could be reduced and vinegar increased a bit without reducing the quality of taste/flavor.

Cannot believe I had this salad at a friend's house last night and here it was on Allrecipes today.  My hostess had a gourmet bottled dressing on the table.  It was a great salad although I would prefer blue cheese to feta.  The toasted almonds did make an ordinary salad terrific.

This was "good" but I expected much better, based on the reviews. It's not really worth it for all of the preparation involved, as well as the cost of all of the ingredients (wasn't things I normally keep on hand).

Very good. I love the crunchy texture. The dressing is nicely balanced, not too sweet. needed a little salt, I thought. It's a LOT of dressing though (granted, I only had 8-9oz of spinach, not the 10oz which the recipe calls for.) I had to go buy poppy seeds specifically, but it was worth it, they really do add to the flavor. If you like this, there's a similar recipe on this site - an almond, mint, cucumber, strawberry salad - that's equally good, served with spinach. This is a definite keeper.

I've made this many times.  I cut the sugar back in the dressing to 3 Tbsp's which gave it a wonderful contrast of sweet and sharp.  I also used blanched sliced almonds and candied them to add the sweetness missing in the dressing and a little chunch to the salad.  Put them all together just before serving.  I used just enough dressing to lightly coat the greens and berries.   Outstanding!  Rave reviews from co-workers and family.

The only change I made was using balsamic vinegar instead of white.  This recipe was a hit -many compliments and requests for the recipe.  It's definitely worth your time to give this one a try.

Loved this salad and so did everyone else! It went perfectly with Easter dinner. I made the recipe as written but I only used half of the dressing (used the second half for a second batch). Delicious!

I made this today for a dinner we were invited to tonight.  Everyone loved it.  I made the dressing in the morning so it had time for the flavors to develop.  I toasted the almonds.  Everyone had seconds and a picky 5 year old ate some and enjoyed it too.

Strawberries were on sale for 88 cents a quart and spinach was also on sale for 88 cents a bunch at my favorite store, so I just had to try this salad.  I had to use Splenda instead of sugar (those blood sugar issues again) and only used about 1/8 of a cup in the dressing.  I also used minced shallots instead of onion because I had some that needed to be used up.  While I was rummaging around in my cupboard looking for the vinegar, I found an unopened bottle of red wine raspberry vinegar I forgot I had so I used that.  I also added some chopped red onion to the salad as suggested by other reviewers. I managed to get DH to de-stem and wash the spinach while I messed with some quinoa I was having problems with.  My strawberries were sweet and ripe and just perfect.  We loved this salad.  Thanks so much for the post, TOZENUF!

Delicious with some modifications - way too much olive oil! I made the dressing and then wound up skimming about 1/2 of the oil off - a few tablespoons to bind the dressing to the spinach would suffice. Used balsamic vinegar instead of white. Left out the onion, sesame seeds and poppy seeds as I had none. Added LOTS of cracked pepper for zip. Very good!!

This is the best recipe for this type of dressing I've had. Most recipes call for balsamic vinegar which changes the flavor. This is sweet and yummy!  I dont prefer the strong taste of balsamic in general. Keeper!

I loved this salad. The dressing is what really sets it off. My husband ate 2 bowls of it! I added mandarin oranges for some added color and taste. The salad dressing was really easy to make. I didn't have any sesame seeds, so this time I left them out. Also I didn't put as much sugar as called for in the recipe. A+ Recipe!!

This salad is so good. It is light and a perfect blend of flavors. The salad dressing is yummy. The only thing I added was crumbled gorganzola. This recipe is definitely one I will make again...

This is absolutely the best salad I have ever had.  I need to eat more more greens and this is definitely one dish that tastes like a treat. I was hesitant to make it at first, but sooo glad I did. Now I'm hooked.  Didn't change a thing!

Used only 1/4 cup sugar and a combo of balsamic and red wine vinegers. This is THE BEST DRESSING I've ever had! I'd never found a favorite dressing until this. Had it every night this week. Five stars!!!

I substituted balsmaic vinegar for the white vinegar and pureered the dressing in a blender.  I also prefer to use baby spinach. If I dont have poppy seeds on hand, I use black sesame seeds. If using the regular sessame seeds, I like to toast them.

Oh... Yum! Seriously good!  We had some friends over for dinner last last and we wanted a more original side salad.  I told our friends they were our guinea pigs and told them what it was made of.  She is an amazing cook, but still looked skeptical.  He flat out raised an eyebrow and said "uh, okay...".  This had them at first bite.  We were all amazed at how good this is!  I made it just as written but with a very heaping 1/4 cup sugar instead of the whole half cup.  Excellent!  Next time I'll play with it a bit like some other reviews suggest, but that would be just for fun as this truly doesn't need changing.

My husband raved about this salad. I added mandarin oranges and candied pecan halves. I also sliced pecan crusted chicken breasts and placed on top of sald for a complete meal. I've also tried Garganzola cheese with this meal and it was very tasty.

I've been making this salad for years (usually at four times the quantity for big parties) and everyone raves. I can't count how many times I've given out the recipe. I grate the onion on a microplane to avoid chuncks and also get the onion "juice" and taste. Also, you do need to dress and toss the salad about 15 minutes before serving, as the sugar in the dressing macerates the strawberries, which is a major flavor component of the dressing. This salad (unfortunately) does not hold up well for leftovers - gets very soggy overnight.

Absolutely wonderful! As other reviewers suggested, I used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Other than that, I follwed the directions exactly.  Our dinner guest, who is a chef, also loved it!

I did what everybody else suggested and added some iceberg, part of a roasted Costco chicken that I cut into pieces, and didn't use all the dressing.  Plus, I added the Feta cheese like other people had suggested.  It's a Yummmmmmmmmmm recipe!

Made this for a picnic lunch on a date. I used half the olive oil, left out the sugar and substituted raspberry vinaigrette for the vinegar. The dressing recipe makes A LOT of dressing... I was eating it for days after!

Really good. I took the advice of a number of previous reviewers and cut the sugar in half. I'm glad I did, it's very sweet as is. We also found that the dressing is enough to do almost two salads.

Bottom line: I've made this for a lot of different people. They've all LOVED it.

The dressing goes a looooooong way, though. I find that each serving of salad only needs a tiny drizzle of it -- plus, you save big-time on calories.

Excellent idea.  I added some blueberries and feta cheese to make the perfect red/white/blue 4th of July salad.  I also toasted the almonds and used Balsalmic vinegar.  Everyone loved it!

I'm not much of a salad lover... until I tried this salad! What a wonderful and tasty treat! I cut back on the sugar and didn't have any poppy seeds, so I used sunflower seeds instead! A little sprinkle of feta cheese was the perfect touch! UPDATE: I cannot believe how much I love this salad! Feta is a must! The (expensive) poppy seeds added nothing, so leave them out! This salad is simply to die for!

This recipe is absolutely the best way to eat spinach!  I mix all the ingredients except the spinach in a bowl & keep it in the fridge.  Each day I put my spinach in a bowl, add the  strawberry dressing & make it fresh everyday! Keeps the spinach from wilting. YUM!

I make the following changes to up this to a 5-star recipe... Substitute light brown sugar for the white sugar & rice wine vinegar for the regular vinegar. Make it a full meal by adding jerk-spiced or blackened shrimp/chicken. Adds a good contrast of spicy & sweet.

Dee-licious! My sister made a similar recipe years ago but there were SO many ingredients to the dressing. This is much simpler and tastes just as great! I did reduce sugar to 1/4 C and used balsamic vinegar. Also baked a piece of Salmon to go on top = PERFECT combination of flavors. Said "mmmm..." with every bite :-)

As per other reviews, I also cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. Every time I've made this I've omitted the poppy seeds just because I never have any. 
Makes more dressing than you need. 
Add dressing just before serving.
Use balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.
Toasted almonds are good, as are walnuts and even pinenuts.
I've added some mandarin oranges before - that was good, too.

Yummy, this has to be one of my favourite salads. I made a few alerations to better suit my taste. I normally add a red onion to my dressing, but it completely slipped my mind this time... I actually enjoyed the dressing more without it! I also ended up reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup, and still found that it was very sweet. I used white cider vinegar, no olive oil, and 1/4 cup vegetable oil. Before I added the almonds, I candied them by combining them along with 1/2 cup water, 3/4 cup white sugar, and 2 tsps of cinnamon in a saucepan over medium heat. I stirred them until the liquid was all evaporated, leaving the almonds with a sticky coating. This really gave the salad an extra kick!

I will be making this salad again. Thanks for sharing!

This is one of my favorite salads to take to dinners and parties.  There is never a duplicate, and everyone asks for the recipe.  I use an egg slicer to slice the strawberries.  It is quick and they come out nice and even!

This is a 6 star recipe and it just doesn't get any better.  My better half, who is picky, told me, "This is the best salad I have ever eaten!"  The ultimate compliment....I followed the recipe exactly, too....I served this for a gathering of 12 on a warm day and it received rave reviews from some seasoned women who have spent quite a bit of time in the kitchen and know good food when they taste it.  This doesn't last long around our house.  The down side to this salad is that the lettuce leaves will wilt quickly and not last to the next day.  The upside, everybody cleans it out fast for you and you do need a rather large bowl to serve it in because people will come back for seconds.

My favorite salad now! Excellent flavor but it makes much more than 4 servings. I used basalmic vinegar, cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and added feta. It was the hit of the party! It's a keeper!

Unbelievably good!  I cut the sugar down to less than half.  I stared at about 1/8 cup sugar and just slowly added a little bit more until it was to my liking.  I also used just regular balsamic vinegar.  Delicous.  It turned out really good.
I used this for a wedding reception for a friend.  So many guests came back to the kitchen area to comment on how good it was and even ask for the recipe. I told them it was from here, and shared the recipe.  They were delighted.  Thank you for this recipe, it's awesome.

I know I am just another wow! this is good but had to write. I couldn't find a raspberry balsalmic vinegar which is more our liking but did find balsalmic glace raspberry by colavita. Toasting the almonds really bring out their flavor. I have given this recipe out to 3 people and only my son has not liked it. He's the picky eater. Cutting the sugar in half was perfect for us. I really appreciate all the suggestions from other cooks.

First let me begin by saying this dressing is VERY VERY sweet. I cut the sugar in half, as others suggested, but I think next time I'll only put a third of the sugar into the dressing. I did substitute balsamic vinegar for white, as others suggested. I also added 1 can of mandarine oranges. It was a good salad, but the "salad" part is not really any different than other spinach/romaine/ lettuce salads. The dressing is the main difference between this salad and other spinach salads on this site. It is a keeper though.

Made this last night and it is wonderful. A lady at my work brought it in for a potluck and I had to try it at home. I added cucumbers (diced with seeds removed) to give an added crunch. The poppy and seasame seeds really make the dressing tasty. I also used balsamic vinegar instead of the white vinegar and it tastes fruity, goes well with the strawberries. This is a simple but to die for recipe recipe. My mother ate almost all the salad I made left in the fridge while I was asleep, I guess she liked it. I will definetely be making this salad often.

Fantastic.  I did reduce the sugar (per other reviews) to 1/3, and used balsamic vinegar.  I did sprinkle feta on top before serving (YUM).  I also warmed the dressing for a minute in the microwave.
My dinner guests loved this salad (and the men were going back for thirds).

Excellent!  I wouldn't add sesame seeds next time - not really needed.  Also, I used 1/2 sugar-1/2 Splenda and 1/4 c oil-1/4c water to reduce fat and sugar content.  LOVED IT!

This is an incredible recipe! I did decrease the sugar as some people recommended and it was great.  We made a huge batch for the homeless shelter and everyone loved it1!

I've been testing strawberry-spinach salad recipes for a little while. With this recipe, I finally found the one I was looking for. 

Add crumbled blue cheese or stilton for a twist.

Yummy! Made for former co-workers (even one who doesn't eat salad!) and got RAVE reviews.  Did cut back a tad on the sugar and added marinated chicken breast.  Hubby polished off the leftovers and told me to make it again just for him!

Good as written, but also delicious when cutting the sugar down to 1/4 cup, oil down to 1/4 cup and using 1/2 cup of RICE wine vinegar!  Less sugar & fat, but just as yummy!  I also use the dressing sparingly...a little does a long ways!  Thanks so much!

This is an excellent salad and it received a very enthusiastic response at a recent dinner party. It was called "refreshing," and everyone at the table had seconds. I recommend adding sugar to taste, rather than immediately adding the full amount called for, as I found the dressing was just right with about half the sugar.

Fantastic salad!  I halved the sugar in the dressing and left out the Worcestershire sauce because I was making it for a vegetarian friend.  Followed the recipe exactly other than that.  We just put the dressing on each serving instead of over the whole thing and used about half the dressing.  There were strawberries and almonds left in the bottom of the bowl, so will add more spinach and have this great salad again tonight!

Excellent! Per suggestions, I used 1/4 cup sugar, 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil, and 2/3 cup vinegar--I had Trader Joe's Orange Muscat Vinegar on hand, which tasted lovely! Don't forget to add freshly ground pepper and course salt to taste. Would recommend 1/2 cup almonds for more crunch--1/4 cup was not enough for our tastes. P.S. I tried it with mandarin oranges the 2nd night--not nearly as good as with strawberries.

Not that this needs another rave review, but WOW!  This was great.  The dressing really brings the flavors together.  I'm going to try adding mandarin oranges, chicken, & maybe other seasonal berries.

I thought this salad was very good.  My husband, who doesn't like to try something new and different, loved it too.  When strawberries are out of season, I will use oranges or kiwis, and maybe add some red onion rings.

My two cents is that the recipes makes far more than 4 servings.  It's more like 6 to 8 servings.  So, for more people I just double the dressing ingredients and quadruple the spinach, strawberries, and almonds.  Love this salad ingredients and the taste is marvelous!

This salad always gets rave reviews by my guests and lots of recipe requests. Changes I made were to use mixed greens instead of spinach, cider vinegar instead of white, less sugar, and toasted pine nuts instead of almonds. This is so simple to make, and it tastes like you spent hours on it!

Yes have tried and really like it. But decided to tweak it a little bit added bacon and some candied walnuts, and then I blended five strawberries into the dressing was extremely delicious that way. Yummy   Monica

I made this for a pot luck for Easter. I didn't read the recipe well enough to notice that the dressing needed to be chilled for AN HOUR before serving. The sugar was very grainy and you could taste it in the dressing. We didn't have enough time to let it chill so we decided to try heating it in the microwave for about 45 seconds (in 15 second intervals). It worked amazing! The sugar texture was gone and the flavors worked great! Great salad! Thanks for sharing!

A little less sugar, half the recipe, and use one tablespoon or less of sugar. Salad greens ok too, instead of spinach. Pine nuts, or walnuts. Add hempseeds.  Use red onion minced, balsamic vinegar.

My Husband and I loved this recipe. What I added was a package of chicken breast tenders which I cut into smaller pieces and sautéed them in olive oil and added this to the salad right before serving.

DELICIOUS!!!!!!
This salad was sooooo yummy! The strawberries, spinach, and dressing go so good together!! I used 1/4 cup sugar, balsamic vinegar, and just under the 1/2 cup of olive oil with all the other called for ingredients (except for almonds).  I also kept the dressing seperate (put in fridge for about 40 mins) and skipped putting the salad in the fridge for 15 mins.  Can't wait to make this again!

The salad and the dressing are excellent. Any time my wife commandeers one of the many trial and error recipes  that I have tried in my quest to learn-- it represents the ultimate compliment that this recipe is a winner.

This was very refreshing.  The second time I made it, I put all the dressing ingredients in a blender, added six strawberries, and blended it.  It gave the dressing a slight strawberry flavor that tied the whole salad together.

I made the dressing in a food processor, much easier!! Put the onion in first and chop that.  Then add everything else but the oil and seeds and mix it.  Then add the oil and mix and then add the seeds and mix.  It was a great recipe!! I didn't change a thing, even my husband liked it and said "who would have ever thought to put strawberries in a salad?" :)

As other reviewers have mentioned, I decreased the sugar to about 1/4-1/3 c and used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar.  I didn't want any chunks of onion in the dressing, so I used a fine grater to grate the onion into a bowl and then measured a tablespoon of grated onion and onion juice.

I added feta cheese to the salad and toasted the almonds to bring out their flavor.  The salad would also be great with red onion and with chicken or steak for a main dish.

This was delicious! Too many seeds, though. I would take out at least half the seeds, and I added 2 Tbsp. mustard as an emulsifier.

Oh! This sale is amazing.  I have made this several times since finding it on here.  I always half the sugar.  It's plenty sweet.  People absolutely love this.  Do not make ahead of time as it really wilts.  It's still yummy, but does not look yummy then.

Delicious! Everybody loved it! Just wish it didn't have a half cup of sugar. Will try to cut down the amount of sugar or substitute something else that works just as well. Only gave it 4 stars because I don't think white vinegar is the best choice... too acidic and gave me a tummy ache.. I would substitute your favorite balsamic vinegar instead.

I made this for a potluck luncheon and followed several suggestions.  I used balsamic vinegar, half the sugar, blueberries, cutie tangerine slices, and bananaswith the strawberries.  I did not add the fresh pineapple as i felt the juices would clash with the dressing.This recipe feeds more than four ladies.  

After dressing the spinach wilts fairly fast; not usable after a couple hours.  So definitely dress only what is for immediate consumption.  Pretty in a glass trifle bowl.

I made this for Easter dinner and not one person didn't find it incredible.  I used red onions instead of minced onions.  And balsamic vinegar instead of white.  I blended the dressing in a blender to get rid of bigger chunks of onions.  And I added mandarin oranges.  It was so delicious.  You WON'T regret makig this at all.  And so easy.

I agree with others....best spinach/fruit salad I've found! 
I mixed greens, fruit, cheese(feta) and nuts together the night before and kept in the fridge. I poured the dressing on just before serving. The greens stayed crisp and there was plenty of flavor.

I made this salad for the first time yesterday and absolutely loved it so I prepared a double batch of dressing today, had another salad for lunch, and now have dressing made ahead for the next.  I cut the sugar in half, used Balsamic Vinegar and added Kiwi.  I think it would be great with almost any fruit and also experimenting various flavors of vinegars.  Can't wait to serve it to family and friends.  They are going to do flips over this tasty salad!

This recipe is terrific just as written. It has that perfect balance between tart and sweet, with many interesting layers of flavor. Take this to a picnic or pot luck and you will be a star.
Thank you for sharing!

Fantastic flavour!  I used 3/4 of the sugar called for in this recipe though, and I still found it a little too sweet.  However, I will for sure keep making this salad with less sugar in the dressing!

I love this salad! Always a winner! I also used half of the sugar and it is still wonderfully sweet. Even my husband, who hates spinach, likes this recipe.

Very yummy.  Next time i won't use all of the dressing though, it was a little to much for us.  Definitley let the dressing sit the reccommended amount of time as well as the salad once its all together.  A definte keeper, thanks!

I loved this. I did make some modifications...In addition to the strawberries, I also added a can of mandarine oranges. I did not have poppy seeds ot seaseme seeds, but it was yummy. I did hal the sugar. I thought it made a lot of dressing but I just saved the rest for the next night's dinner. Like others said, try not to dress the salad too early or it will become soggy. I dressed it and ate.

I have made this twice in the last 3 days. I am giving it 4 stars because I cut the sugar down by half and it was PLENTY sweet.  The first time I cut the sugar but used all of the oil it called for.  The second time, I cut the sugar and oil in half.  It was just as good the second time as it was the first time.  I didn't miss the oil.  There is absolutely NO need to use all of the sugar it calls for.  ...and I LOVE sweet!  My husband even mentioned that it was a little too sweet (not knowing that I even cut the sugar). Even using half of what the recipe calls for, it was thick and coated the spinach nicely. I didn't have poppy seeds.  They would have been a nice addition, but not missed.  I toasted the almonds slightly. This was a nice and simple salad.  Thanks for the recipe.  High in calories and fat, however.  You get your vitamins and antioxidents but the sugar isn't all that great.  Playing with aguave or honey wouldn't be a bad idea.

Very good recipe!  Nice and fresh, but a little too sweet for me.  Next time I make this (and there will definitely be a next time) I will cut the sugar by a third.  Otherwise, this is a perfect salad!

Great base for an amazing salad.  I add a lot more items (carrots, cucumber, raspberries, mandarin oranges, gorgonzola cheese, and chicken) but the dressing is very mild and good.  I usually add cracked black pepper to the top as well.

Excellent summer salad!  The only thing I was missing was the poppy seeds, but it still tasted great.  To my family and I, it tasted like there was a little too much olive oil, but that's an easy fix next time I make it.  This is now a staple in our salad rotation.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  I now make the dressing in tupperware and keep it in the fridge to use every day.   I substitute the olive oil for sesame oil.  I toast the sesame seeds.  These steps bring a great nutty flavor to the dressing that I love.  I use Splenda instead of sugar.  I have tried both minced onion and finely grated onion; it is good both ways.  I omit the poppy seeds because I don't see a need for them.   Please try it with sesame oil; you will like the results.

I made this salad last evening for my husband & neighbor.  We all thought it was fabulous.  I used half the sugar that was called for and found the dressing to be perfect - it brought out the flavor of the spinach & strawberries (rather than covered them up as many dressings do).  We're having a guest for dinner tomorrow evening and I plan on serving this again.  It's definitely a keeper.

My husband and I really enjoyed this salad. The kids didn't like the dressing, so next time I'll leave that off of theirs. This was a really nice change from our usual tossed salad with dinner. I took the advice of others and made the dressing in the blender.

Best salad ever! I left out the sesame seeds since I didn't have any, and replaced white vinegar with balsamic vinegar. I also toasted the almonds. Everyone went back for seconds!

Love this salad.  For years I have been taking "healthier" dishes to my inlaws and they never touch my food.  This salad is the first thing of mine they would even try, and they loved it.  They actually requested I bring it again.  I made the recipe as descriped.  Very nice and light.  The dressing makes a lot, I had enought for several salads.

AMAZING salad, and couldn't be simpler... dressing uses ingredients I always have on hand, so this is going to be made A LOT around here during strawberry season, which happens to be RIGHT NOW!!!  I did cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and added a good glob of yummy local honey, and still BF said "it's like a dessert salad" so would cut sugar even further back next time... I'll add feta next time too, and maybe avocado (which might balance out all the sweet some).  This is my go-to new spring salad!

Overall, very good. A little too much sugar in the dressing. I will try to reduce it in the future.

This is really good.  I followed the recipe almost exactly and used 1/4 cup of sugar as suggested by others.  I didn't have poppy seeds, so I left them out, but other than that it was exact and really easy to make.  I used the food processor to combine.  Will make again.

I have made a version of this salad for years. Dressing indgredients are the same and is awesome. I omit the almonds and add to the spinach and strawberries  - fresh bean sprouts, green grapes halved and Oscar Meyer bacon pieces. You will love this! I take home an empty bowl every time and the recipe is always requested.

I loved this salad!  It was super easy, had a nice variety of textures to munch on.  The dressing was sweet and very delicious.  If you're not a sweet dressing person, you may want to adjust the dressing using less sugar.  But, I loved it just the way it was posted.  I'd definately make this salad again.

My husband and I loved this salad, especially the dressing.  I have a hard time finding dressings that we both like, but this one worked for us both.  I used apple cider vinegar instead of white and chopped walnuts instead of almonds (only because that's what I had on hand).  Definitely agree with other reviewers that less sugar would be better.  This makes a lot of dressing, so am saving the remainder to use tomorrow!

Yum...this salad is fabulous!  I used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar.  I also used glazed (Pecan Pie) pecans instead of the almonds.

A really pretty salad and very flavorful. I doubled the recipe and only used 1/4 c. sugar after reading other reviews and added red onions and toasted the almonds. I made it for an Easter potluck and it was eaten in minutes.

I adapted according to several comments -- cut the sugar in half, used balsamic vinegar, added fresh bacon bits and blue cheese.  Took it to a ladies' luncheon and everyone loved it.  The dressing was amazing!  Thanks for sharing!

I absolutely love this salad.  I get a lot of compliments on it when I make it.  Everybody asks for the recipe.  I have substituted the strawberries with blueberries that we picked ourselves.  Just as good with the blueberries!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This salad was delicious. We loved the dressing.  However, I'm hoping the Total Fat column is very wrong. 35.3 g of FAT??  I cut the recipe for 2, so I'm assuming the fat will be lower.   Can you tell, I'm hoping it is wrong.. ha ha

Delicious.  I used pomegranate balsamic vinegar.  Was hard to detect the sesame seeds and poppy seeds - will try without next time.  Also added chopped walnuts and some crumbled feta cheese.  Lots of rave reviews.

Loved this salad so simple, but just right.  I would recommend leaving the dressing out once it has set.  The oil tends to seperate in the fridge after a few days.

I have tried most of the other dressings offered on this site for this salad and I have to say that there is a reason this one has #1 in it's title. It is the best tasting dressing by far. I make extra so that I can use it on other salads. Fantastic salad and dressing. Plus, love the calculator option.

This was very good for a sweet salad.  I definitely recommend cutting the sugar down to 1/4 cup as others suggest.  I also use blue cheese which is quite yummy.

EDIT:  Sticking to a more paleo diet which means eliminating refined sugar.  I now substitute honey for sugar and I love this recipe even more than before!

OH wow!! This salad is absolutely Delicious!! Its refreshing and tangy surprisingly sweet, Some changes I made to make it a healthier was instead of using 1/2 of sugar I was just a pinch of powderd sugar, instead of almonds Cascadian honey oats(gives it a wonderful crunch)added 1/4 a cup of sesame seed oil. To give it that extra kick and beautiful color I put a few leaves of red pepper! I recommended this salad to everyone who's tired of the same old thing. Thank you so much!!

WOW.. it is obvious why this recipe is ranked so well. I do agree though that cutting the sugar amount in half is a good idea.  I also found that I needed more spinach than the recipe called for so I used one of those bags of mixed greens and it worked very well.  I think that the best part of this recipe is its versatility. My sister has been making a similar type salad for years, and she uses grapes, mandarin oranges, sunflower seeds, cubed chicken breast etc. Today the addition was small cubed white sharp cheddar, and I think it would do well with most any white cheese. However you end up doing it though, it is a keeper!!

This salad is delicious...I get rave reviews whenever I serve it.  I do sometimes brown the pecans in melted butter and sugar and then drain them on paper towels before adding to the salad.

Delish!  I cut the sugar in half (plenty sweet with only 1/4 cup), used red onions, basalmic vinegar and added some blue cheese.

This dressing is so great with this salad that has very simple ingredients! My guests and I loved this as written but next time I will probably toast the almonds.  I made the dressing a day ahead of the party so come party day putting this together was a snap!  I have so much dressing left over, even after doubling the strawberry/spinach/almond mixture- but it will soon be gone as this is going to be one of my new staple salad dressings to keep around all the time!  This is nothing like a salad dressing that can be purchased at the store, the flavor is light and so tasty with high quality ingredients!  I wash store bought salad dressing jars to reuse for homemade dressing storage.  I have been experimenting with a poppy seed/onion dressing recipe that is similar but now my experiments have ended.  This one wins!  Thanks!!!

VERY refreshing and tasty.  It was the first thing to be done at a recent bbq for 30+ people.  I suggest adding salt/pepper and a little lemon juice.

Thanks so much for this recipe -- really enjoyed it!  Made it (for the first time out...) ALMOST as written. Based on other reviews, used only half the sugar (of that, actually 1/2 sugar, 1/2 a Splenda clone...), also used 1/2 white wine vinegar, 1/2 balsamic, and added a dash of salt.  Will definitely make again -- may play a bit next time.  Thinking that some feta, red onion and/or mandarin orange segments would be wonderful additions.  Chicken roasted with a balsamic glaze would also be excellent as a main-course salad... yum!!

Thought this was good, really sweet, so don't be shocked.  Took the advice from others and added feta cheese, was a nice addition, thought goat cheese would be good as well. I also added a little romaine, just to give it a little crunch

This one is a keeper!  I saw all of the reviews and had to give it a try.  I made this for my daughters 5th birthday party and we had 30 guests. I couldn't have imagined the results, as the huge salad bowl was emptied within just a few minutes!  People were coming back and loading their whole plate with the salad. Thank goodness I actually had enough ingredients to make a second batch.

I have made this salad several times over the past 5 years, and it is absolutely my favorite salad. 
Lately, Ive been trying to make healthier food choices, and I made the salad tonight substituting agave syrup for white sugar - I couldn't tell the difference, it was as fabulous as ever!

Now this is a salad.  I make the dressing the day before, and put in on right before I am about to serve it.  Great for banquets (or food competitions at work;  Believe me, you will win!)  Just follow the recipe exactly, or toast the almonds before tossing them in for added flavor.  Believe me, you will be asked for this recipe as soon as they take a bite!  5 stars.

This was a really easy recipe. The dressing was great (although a bit pricey with all the seeds). Strawberries were a really nice touch, as were the almonds. However this was ALOT of sugar, cutting down on that doesn't cut any of the taste.

Great recipe.  The salad was all gone!  My only suggestion is that it is too much dressing.  I wouldn't add all of the dressing next time.  Maybe half.

WOW, the strawberries (fresh of course) positively sing out loud in the background of the vinegar and sugar.  I added chopped bacon, then toasted pine nuts in the bacon fat (hey, I didn't ahve any almonds).  A clove of garlic, simply warmed in the fat rather than sauteed, iced the deal.  The best salad I have ever made.  Tops even the Caesar Salad made at the table.  Bravissimo!

Fantastic recipe!! I just made this last night, followed recipe exactly, except I used less sugar, toasted almonds  and added Fetta cheese. It was absolutely delicious!! What a great salad to compliment a "summer barbeque." This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

This salad is always a hit wherever I take it.  I usually "carmelize" the almonds with a little white sugar in a saute pan for 10-15 minutes, stirring constantly, and I always add feta cheese for a little extra zing and protein. Even non-vegetable-eating children have devoured it.

I've tried another spinach salad recipe on here that was very similar.
I just don't really like the salad that much. The dressing is so-so. This salad was good, but I really wouldn't make it again. It just wasnt to my taste.

Awesome salad.  Everyone enjoys it each time I make it. I actually cut the amount for the dressing in half, because I felt like the bottom of my salad was swimming when I used the entire amount.

OK, I read everything that I could about suggested changes to the salad and followed many of them. I used a blender for the dressing and it came out as a thick, muddy mess that looked HIGHLY unappetizing spooned onto the top of the salad. Luckily...it DID taste yummy, but some guests stayed away from it due to the appearance. I tried to used a little OJ to thin it out but it didn't help much. I may do this again, but do NOT recommend using the blender for the dressing!

I loved this, but I also cut down a bit on the sugar and added a tad more (balsamic) vinegar. I added goat cheese, toasted pecans, avocado and pear. It was fantastic!

This is a GREAT recipe!
I altered the sugar to the 1/4C instead of 1/2C. and use the red onion and balsmic vinegar, and blend all the ingredients for the dressing together. 
I use fresh strawberries,
pineapple & granny smith apples & Kiwi, then freeze for 45 min.  I would not use bananas again because they turned soggy. After preparing the dressing, I add grilled chicken or bacon to the spinach and fruit, then the dressing and top with grated parmesan cheese and roasted almonds.   I always go home with a empty bowl...Warning if you are making this for a crowd double the recipe & apply dressing right before eating.

Fantastic salad. I did cut the amount of sugar to about 2tbsp. and it was still pretty sweet. There's no way you need 1/2 cup!

I really love this salad and so does my friends and family.  I am not a fan of slivered almonds.  I like to use the thinly sliced and saute them in a little butter.  Excellent!

Loved this salad.  The dressing was a nice change from the Poppyseed that I usually have on Spinach Salad.  The kids LOVE the Strawberries.

I served this at a dinner party and it was great! I took the advice of some of the reviewers and made the dressing in advance so the flavours would mix but did not put it on until the absolute last minute so the spinach wouldn't wilt. I only ended up needing 1/2 the dressing but i am keeping the other 1/2 of the dressing for another salad some weeknight this week.
We all really liked it, i look forward to making this again with some of the variations suggested like oranges or berries instead of strawberries. And chicken or bacon to make it a full meal. mmmmmm

I rate this recipe a 5 and added a few extras to make a full meal for my family. They love a salad I fix very much like this one - they love shrimp and asked for a salad that included the shrimp and strawberries together, I took these and added the red onion in very thin thin slices, and also added manderan oranges and instead of the almond slices, I added honey roasted pecans. My family always cleans the bowl and I never have enough for lunch the next day, I also make this for parties and special occassions where I am asked to bring a dish.

This is a wonderful recipe, because kids actually eat it. I did change the dressing though. I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 balsamic vinegar ( if you use fresh strawberries they add enough sweetness). I also used toasted pecans and crumbled feta cheese, ( you can also use crumbled blue cheese). It was delish!

This is absolutely delicious! i have made this on several occasions and sometimes when i dont have time to make the dressing i would just throw on some blush wine vinagrette (brianna's) and the result is still crowd pleasing. I made this for my graduation party and one of my friends who hated salad said that it was the most amazing salad she's ever had!

Great summer salad!! Very colorful. It is really fruity with a little sweet yet tangy taste from the dressing. I followed one of the reviewer's advice and put all the ingredients for the dressing in the blender. It was very quick to make. The only thing I changed was that I added blueberries to the salad along with the strawberries. Yummy!!

I concur! As suggested, used half the sugar, balsamic vinegar, and less olive oil than it called for. Perfect! Serving it at a baby shower this weekend. I'm sure it will impress!

This was an awesome recipe! I did not want the dressing too sweet so I used raspberry balsamic vinegar as someone else had suggested and added just a drop of regular balsamic vinegar; I also only used 2 Tbsp. of sugar. I used the sesame seeds but not the poppy seeds. Also I toasted some slivered almonds and tossed those in. Dinner party was a huge success thanks to this salad!

I took this to a barbeque some friends were having and it got RAVE reviews. I did make some alterations, such as using half the sugar called for, and I also used chopped red onion for the minced. Almonds were omitted because I am not a real almond fan, but the rest worked great! I want to try it with the balsamic vinegar next time, but this is definitely a keeper!!!

It is strawberry season and this recipe is a perfect, sweet and savory combination of flavors.  This salad went from the field to my table in one day...talk about fresh (and nutritious!  I reduced the sugar by half and added a clove of fresh minced garlic to the dressing, since I don't seem to be able to prepare anything without garlic.  I also included some feta cheese in the salad.  We loved it!

This is such a wonderful salad, even my children like it. I lightly toast the poppy and sesame seeds with the almonds in my toaster oven. I also  use balsamic vinegar and red onion as some other reviewers mentioned.

I really expected more from this.  I have my own version of spinach salad that I like better.  This was good.  Recommend only using ripe strawberries or mandrian oranges.  Dressing was a bit sweet.  I have one that a make with bacon and green onions that I like better and will likely keep with that.

Deeeelish! I just made this today for Mother's Day. I had about 17 people and EVERYONE raved over the salad. I changed a couple of things: 1)I cut the sugar in half 2)used balsamic instead of white vinegar 3)used glazed walnuts instead of almonds 4)added raisins and craisins. It was really good! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I absolutely loved this and can't wait to eat the leftovers!!  I didn't toss the dressing on the salad before serving, just whisked up the dressing and served it on the side.  I added mandarin oranges which went nicely.

FABULOUS! I was a bit hesitant to make this at first cuz i didn't think the strawberries would go well with spinach, but decided to give it a shot (500+ ppl can't be wrong!) - try it, you'll fall in love!!!

All the five stars should say it all. If you have any doubts about this combination, throw them out the window. I was reluctant at first to make it, and now can't wait to do it again!

Phenominal!!! My husband made this recipe exactly as stated (minus paprika since we were out) and it was INCREDIBLE. I chose this recipe more for him, than me... but this salad was so good it tasted like dessert more than a side dish! The strawberries aren't quite in season where we live and were a bit bitter...until they married the dressing... it was happily ever after for everyone involved after that! I'm not one for "fancy cooking" or "gourmet" recipes... but I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this salad! Thanks!!

I made quite a few changes, as I was searching for something a little bit different then this.  I made the dressing as written except I omitted the paprika and sesame seeds.  I used red wine vinegar and added extra (maybe 1/3 Cup), then I put about 1/2 tsp salt, some fresh black pepper and maybe 1/2 tsp or so dried mustard.  For the salad, I mixed baby lettuce with baby spinach and chopped up a couple green onions.  Delicious :)  It makes a lot of dressing!

We served this recipe as part of our Easter meal.  It was delicious and the flavors of the salad dressing were interesting.  One note of caution... the dressing is VERY sweet.  Of course it needs a touch of this to balance the strawberries and spinach, but in my opinion it was overly sugary and masked some of the flavors of the salad.  If you don't like super sweet dressings, I would suggest cutting back on the sugar.  On the other hand, some people who normally would skip salads devoured this one.  Go figure!

1ST TIME A SALAD FOR A FAMILY GATHERING WAS ENTIRELY GONE! I took some tips from other reviews and combined them: I used apple cider and red wine vinegar, a light olive oil, omitted the onion you were suppose to put in the dressing though I added sliced red onion atop the salad along with gorgonzola cheese. It was a huge hit!

I used apple vinegar because I didn't have white vinegar-- and it tasted great. I was a little concerned about the amount of sugar in the recipe, so I used 2-3 tablespoons less, and it still tasted great! I also put a little more almonds.

WOW! I would give this 10 stars if I could. SO so so good. I made this last night, and I'm already getting asked to make it again. But I might reduce the amount of sugar next time. Still I loved this! I will make it again and again ..UPDATE: I just made this again for a large gathering and it was the talk of night! Everyone raved and asked for the recipe. A must try!

Very good!  Next time I will use a lighter olive oil, though.  I only had the "Rich Taste" olive oil and it was a little too heavy.  This is definitely a keeper.

This is a keeper.  I made this for our Christmas party, following the recipe to a T. It was a hit.  The best part is that it is light, healthy and refreshing.  I will definitely make this again but may cut down on the sugar as suggested by other members.  Thanks again!

This was kind of boring I thought.  If you look at the recipe there are only two ingredient on the spinach...almonds and strawberries - and I felt like it needed something.  It was ok...but not a keeper for me.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this recipe yet- it is my and my husband's favorite salad!  I leave the seeds out of the dressing because hubby doesn't care for them.  We always throw a couple chicken breasts in for some protein.  Love this salad!

This is honestly the first salad I've ever truly made. (I'm new at this cooking stuff!) My friends LOVED it. They forgot about the rest of the food I spent hours making and devoured the salad. I didn't add the poppy seeds nor the minced onion. And for the dressing, I mixed balsamic vinegar, olive oil, raspberry vinegar, sugar and sesame seeds. It was delicious!!! Yum I feel like having some now!

I made this for memorial day and this was a huge hit. My husband who doesn't eat his veggies even loved this. I did make a little change I added another 10 oz bag of spinach and added another 1/4 cup of almonds but keep the same ingredients on the dressing. This one is a keeper. Thanks

This is delicious, my man called me an evil genious b/c I've now gotten him to love salads and vegetables with recipes like this.  I toasted the sesame seeds and almonds and cut the sugar down by a quarter.

I made this for a church covered dish lunch, and the bowl was empty before I got through the line.  I then made it again for a house guest, and we all enjoyed the salad.  It makes spinach edible!  :)

I was a little skeptical about this recipe, but I gave it a shot.  I would have given it 4 stars because I thought the dressing was way too sweet, but everyone else LOVED it.  They all packed it up in their lunches the next day.  If you are not big on sweet stuff, like me, then cut the sugar in half, but if you like sweets, go for it!  Great recipe Andrea.

This is a great recipe.  I've made it for 2 parties and all my guests loved it!! Last time, I did not have the sesame or poppy seeds so I used sunflower and it was great.  I also omitted the almonds.

My tastebuds couldn't compute the combination of onion and strawberry.  The dressing is very good over the spinach, so I think I will try the dressing with a spinach and bacon salad next time.  I think my tastebuds would be able to make sense of that combination and I would really enjoy it.

This was a hit for Easter dinner. My mom took home the recipe. I toasted the poppy seeds, sesame seeds and almonds for more flavor. I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup, but next time I will only use 1/8 cup. I used balsamic vinegar for an added kick. My dad can't have the poppy seeds or sesame seeds so I made a batch of dressing without them. It was still great.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I have to admit that I was a little afraid when I saw paprika, strawberries, and spinach all together in the same recipe.. but I decided to trust the previous ratings and give it a try. Wow! I followed the recipe exactly and it was great! It looked beautiful and overall tasted like strawberry. My parents were really impressed and I know I'll be making this again.

Strawberries in a veggie salad? Never would have thought of adding them, BUT... they are a delicious variance to an otherwise rather plain looking green salad. The toasted almonds and seeds were also a nice touch for texture. Overall this is one of the most delicious, nutritious and colorful salads I've ever had. The dressing is the perfect finishing touch! It will be served often at our house while fresh strawberries are in season.  Judy

I thought this was way too sweet. My guests seemed to like it though. I would amend the dressing by cutting the sugar and adding more worcestire and onion, or just try another dressing altogether. Maybe cut the dressing in half and serve on the side. I love spinach too much to drown it in syrupy sweetness.

After reading the other reviews, I used 1/3 cup white balsamic vinegar, 1/3 olive oil and 1/3 cup vinegar in the dressing.  This make for a perfect combination, not too sweet and not too oily.  I also don't care for sesame seeds so I left those out and I used pecans since I am from the south and get them from our trees.  I served this salad at a luau party and for mother's day.  It was a hit both places.  Will definitely be making again.

The second time I made this, I cut way back on the sugar and also felt you really only need about 1/2 the amount of dressing.

This recipe was easy and fun.  I made it for company and everyone enjoyed it.  One flaw was that my poppy seeds were a little bitter and that affected the taste of the dressing (I did cut back on the amount of sugar)but by the time it was dispersed throughout the salad, the bitterness went unnoticed.

This is an excellent summer salad, however I did make a few minor changes. I used 1/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup olive oil, a combination of white vinegar and raspberry balsamic vinegar, a combination of spinach and romaine lettuce, reduced the strawberries to 2 cups and added mandarin oranges. The slivered almonds tended to sink to the bottom, so I used sliced almonds and also added La Choy rice noodles for a little extra crunch.  It may seem like I changed this recipe a lot, but I think the secret's in the sauce!  To DBUG dated 7-18-01 RE: olive oil dilemma....How long have you had your olive oil?  They can get old and turn rancid or develop an off-taste.  Try using Carapelli Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil (First Cold Pressed) or Davinci Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  Both are mild and should not give dressings a strong, unpleasant taste.  Hope this helps.

I will have to try this again as I loved the ingredients, but something was wrong with the dressing. I think it was the olive oil. Is there a specific kind to use for dressings? I thought the extra virgin that I use for cooking was so strong and had a nasty flavor. It overpowered the whole salad. Would regular vegetable oil work better? I will read more reviews and see if I can find some hints for the olive oil dilemma! Good salad though. Thanks.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I had given the recipe to my mom.  She used all the dressing and the spinach was just "swimming" in it.  I made the recipe and only used half the dressing and think letting it sit for 15 minutes is not a good idea either.  The spinach was soggy.  I think I would add a lot less dressing just before serving.  Has anyone else had this problem?

I went to a small dinner party where the hostess served a delicious salad with almonds, strawberries, salad greens and the most amazing dressing.  I'm not much of a lover of salads but after sampling this one I was hooked.  I spent weeks looking for the recipe and then I found this one.  I read all the great reviews and tried some of the suggestions.  I didn't like the balsamic vinegar.  I followed the recipe as it was but I only used half the olive oil and I used Equal instead of sugar.  I also glazed the strawberries and caramalized the almonds.  It was amazing.  Even my boyfriend, who is a meat and potatoes person, loves it.  I went from never eating salad to eating it at least once a week.

This salad is as pretty as it is tasty.  I made this salad for our department's Christmas spread, and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I used cranberries instead of strawberries and the dark green leaves with the red cranberries looked very festive. I also toasted the almonds and used less sugar than the recipe calls for (about half).  I plan to make it again on Christmas Day for my family.

I liked this recipe, although next time I will use less sugar - probably an 1/8 cup.  I taste my food throughout the process of making it, and this salad needs to be chilled for at least 15 minutes with the dressing.

Best salad I ever tasted.  Make dressing one day before serving so sugar has opportunity to completely dissolve.  I cut sugar to 1/3 cup or less.  Plan to try it with Equal next time.  Also good without the sesame seeds.  Toasted almonds even better than plain.

An excellent potluck salad!  My only complaint was that I should've added the dressing afterward to stop the leftovers from getting so soggy!  The almonds MUST be toasted - excellent!

A great and simple salad.  Balsamic vinegar seems to improve the taste of the dressing, as does slightly less olive oil.

This was not quite as good as I expected.  We should have put the dressing on sooner and allowed it to chill longer.

Wow.  This is great.  I fixed it for my 
uncle who I consider a chef and he 
asked for the recipe!  My husband who 
does not like spinach liked it too.

I served this salad at a meeting/potluck last week.  It was a complete success.  I personally, however, would cut back on the sugar a bit. I ran about 15 copies and left them on my desk for those who asked for the recipe.  When I returned to work this next week, they were all gone.  I'd say they liked it!

I found the original too sweet. I reduced the sugar too 1 TBS and traded out Balsamic for regular vinegar. I also increased the almonds to 1/2 cup and we have a winner!

Very tasty. Used white wine vinegar instead of distilled white and dried minced onion because I didn't have an onion on hand.. Be careful not to use too much or the onion is a little over powering. Next time I will toast the sesame seeds. The dressing tastes better after letting it sit in the fridge overnight

Made this for a change of pace at a bbq.  Everyone was totally surprised with the flavor.  It was the first item to be gone.  I think a little less sugar in the dressing would be better since the strawberries are so sweet.  Thanks for a good, quick, new hit.

Listened to review, added blueberries and feta cheese to the recipe and it was fantastic!  

Used the tips about food processed dressing, added black sesame seeds afterwards.  We didn't have poppy seeds.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, might try 1/2 the recipe amount, was a little sweet, still very good.  Keeper

This is delicious! ! The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I feel the amount of dressing is too much for 10oz of spinach and the strawberries. My salad turned into a soggy mess. So I would recommend drizzling however much on as you would like, adding more after a taste test. But the T As Te is definitely 5 stars.  Thanks for posting.

We fixed this! It was delish.  Didn't have fresh cilantro, so we used dried. Doubled the recipe. Will fix again!  Served it with grilled fresh pineapple along with strawberry & spinach salad.

Such a delicious salad! I always love fruit mixed in with salad and a tangy dressing to top it off, and that's just what this is! So easy to make and tastes like one from a nice restaurant. The chewy/crunch of the almonds top it off. I used a purple minced onion and balsamic vinegar in the dressing like one review suggested and it is bomb.com! I also topped with feta cheese, a must! This is our go to summer salad recipe, thanks for sharing!!!

My family, ages 100 to 2 thoroughly enjoyed it and want me to make it again for the 4th of July. I, however did not have sesame seeds,poppy seeds or slivered almonds, so I substituted what I had on hand....glazed pecans, salted sunflower seeds, and feta. It was a wonderful blend of flavors. Serve it and you, too, will be asked for the recipe. Kate

Made this salad for Father's Day and I improvised. No sesame seeds this time in the dressing but I used half the sugar, added salt, balsamic vinegar instead plus doubled Worcestershire. I also added fresh blueberries. Everyone loved it!!! Even my super picky son in law who NEVER eats spinach ate a whole bowl!!! I consider this a victory for me! It's the second time I made it and it got rave reviews first time also. Only one thing, only make enough for the meal, leftovers don't do well at all. Next time I will add some other add ins mentioned in the reviews. Thanks so much!!

Okay, I don't usually bother with rating, but I feel compelled to rate this. I took others advice and cut the sugar, used balsamic vinegar (white) and added fresh blueberries and feta cheese to the salad. Served the dressing on the side which was SO smart. It was part of a large BBQ menu that included salmon, steak, corn, asparagus and potatoes. My best BBQ ever, and thanks to how well this salad paired with everything. Today I enjoyed the leftovers (which is why dressing on the side is so smart) with the leftover salmon, and bought what a yummy dinner just that would make. Next time, for sure....maybe with mandarin oranges

I thought the salad dressing was way too sweet. The combination of spinach and strawberries along with almonds was great, but half the amount of sugar in the dressing, I think, would have made this a lot more palatable. Next time, I will cut the sugar.

I brought this to an Easter celebration yesterday and it was a huge hit!  Everyone loved the combination of fresh baby spinach, strawberries, and almonds.  I also added dried cranberries and crumbled feta cheese for added flavor.  The dressing was fabulous! I'm definitely making this again.

Very good.  I made 1/2 recipe and it was perfect as a side at an Easter meal for 5 to 6 adults.

This was SO GOOD!  I added crumbly blue cheese to the salad like other reviews mentioned. Made this for a big family dinner and was a hit!

This salad is delicious!!  I followed other reviews and used balsamic vinegar for the dressing instead of white.  I also added a little feta cheese to the mix. It complemented our early Easter dinner perfectly. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

This was fantastic! I didn't think the dressing was too sweet at all, but I used Splenda instead of sugar, and sometimes that doesn't end up quite as sweet as the real thing. I do think next time I will see if we can get by with a little less olive oil. Like others, we sprinkled some crumbled feta over our salads when served. So yummy! Thanks for sharing, TOZENUF! :)

I gave this 4 stars only because the recipe calls for  WAY too much sugar.  Use only 1/4 to (at the most) 1/3 cup of sugar.  Otherwise, this is an absolute delicious dish.  It is a keeper, will make over and over again.  My husband loved it and he usually isn't crazy about spinach or sweet dressings. I made the recipe exactly as written but removed some of the sugar.

I made this again.  I made the dressing as written.  I forgot about this having way too much sugar.  I had to throw the dressing out it was that horrible.  The sugar does not dissolve and it was so sweet.  Also too many sesame and poppy seeds.  I remade this doing the following.  I used 1/4 cup of honey to 1/2 cup of canola oil, 1 tsp. Dijon mustard, 1 tsp. sesame oil, 2 teaspoons sesame seeds, 1 teaspoon poppy seeds and 1/4 cup of white wine vinegar.  It was perfect in my opinion.  You can also use a good store bought Asian Sesame Dressing.  It goes very well with this amazing salad.  After tossing spinach and strawberries together with the dressing, add the sliced almonds, and more sesame seeds for presentation.  This is a very pretty dish.

This is my new favorite salad!  Like others, I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I used rice vinegar and I've made it with and without the sesame and poppy seeds..  I've made it with watermelon and feta cheese, strawberries and blueberries with blue cheese and walnuts and with peaches and blueberries with feta cheese and roasted pumpkin seeds.  The combinations are almost endless.  So easy and delicious and nutritious.  Thank you for sharing!

Made this as written, and we liked it a lot. The dressing was okay but would aim next time to make a healthier version by reducing the sugar and oil, or possibly using honey rather than sugar to sweeten. Some reviewers suggested subbing mandarin oranges for strawberries especially if fresh berries are not in season and toasting the almonds & sesame seeds, and both of those seem like good ideas. Glad that we made this.

We love this salad - didn't have any of the seeds for the dressing but used slivered almonds on the salad and red wine vinegar and less sugar.  Used fresh blueberries too.  It was great - one reviewer used frozen strawberries - don't do that!

I changed the white vinegar to Sigona's Dark Chocolate Balsamic (a gift), used red onion, and substituted honey for the sugar. On the advice of other reviewers I cut the amount of sugar - in my case honey -in half. The full recipe is about 1570 calories, if you're curious or watching your calorie intake.

I love this recipe and it is requested over and over and over again!  Some of the modifications I have made are:  blueberries instead of or in addition to strawberries, feta cheese, red onion, candied walnuts and/or pecans and honey instead of sugar.  The variations on this are endless and always a hit.

This recipes is amazing. Every time I make it for a crowd someone begs for the recipe. I follow the directions exactly as they are written. I usually cut up the strawberries ahead of time, and make the dressing in a separate container. I throw it all together right before serving so that the salad doesn't get soggy.

The dressing for this salad is SO good. I definitely agree that 1/4 sugar is sweet enough - in fact, I think I could go down to 1/3 cup! I also added feta cheese, which gave complemented it perfectly. I used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar, per other reviewers' recommendations.

This was more than enough dressing. I only added half - AND I had almost double the amount of spinach (I used about 6 cups). I also chopped up a tomato and threw it in, which I think helped offset some of the sweetness for me (in a good way!).

Next time:
- I'd double the amount of spinach
- I'd try lowering the sugar even further to 1/3 cup
- I might keep the dressing on the side instead of mixing it in
- I think I could add chicken to this and have it stand alone as a main dish!

Overall, super yummy dressing and great recipe! Other reviews mentioned you can easily substitute for other fruit (ie: apples or oranges) ... this was so good, I might just have to try it!

This is a great salad.  I generally add fresh sliced kiwi and a can of drained mandarin; also some feta cheese and I use the Briannas Home Style Poppy Seed Dressing.  Everyone usually has more than one serving.  Delicious!

Made this today and it was very good.  I used strawberry pancake syrup in the dressing instead of the sugar.

Just had to leave yet another rave review for this awesome salad. I've made this twice so far and it has been gobbled up both times. I did as other reviewers suggested and used balsamic vingegar instead of white, and halved the sugar to 1/4 cup. This makes a truly delicious dressing. I also toasted the almond slivers. It is such an easy salad to put together, and a sure crowd pleaser. Just made it for a neighborhood barbeque yesterday and everyone raved about it. Not even one bite was left. I'm surprised they didn't lick the bowl. lol.

absolutely wonderful. i used a mix of spinach and romaine instead of just spinach. The vinaigrette perfectly counteracted the tartness of the strawberries and added its own fabulous flavor addition. everyone loved it.

Great flavor. I only used 1/4  cup of sugar and glad I did because 1/2 cup would have been WAY too sweet. I added some other things to the salad (bacon, egg, mushrooms, walnuts), but it was a huge hit!

I have been making this salad for over 30 years. WE always served in on the gourmet canoe trip - tossed in a small garbage bag.  Chow Mein noodles add a nice crunch along with almonds.  I do put all the ingredients in a blender except for the poppy & sesame seeds.  Yummy & a favorite!

This was a big hit at a Teacher Appreciation Lunch the PTO served.  I used Balsamic vinegar instead of white and used 1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/2.  We also omitted the almonds because our school is a nut free school.  I also used about 1/2 as much dressing as was called for when I mixed the salad.  It was wonderful and many teachers asked me for the recipe.

Use half the amount of sugar and add a tsp of Mustard.  Wonderful.  If you don't have sugar you can use honey.  I did and it was awesome.  I also substitute balsamic for the vinegar sometimes and that is awesome too.

I made this tonight for a pot luck and it was AMAAAAAZING. The only thing was the sugar kept solidifying on the bottom of the container it was in. Next time I'm going to use balsamic vinegar and dissolve the sugar first before adding the other ingredients. Everyone raved about it. I also toasted my almond and had my dressing on the side...as well as some feta. YUM!

Delicious!! But way more than 4 servings unless this is all you're going to eat. As a pre-dinner salad I'd say this is more like 12 to 16 servings. But very yummy and I will be making it again.

Didn't love it like I thought I would.  Used balsamic like some suggested, I will try white next time.  Be sure to put in a container that can be shaken well after chilling.  I didn't and couldn't get the sugar to incorporate into the dressing.
**Made a 2nd time 7 years later without reading my own review.  Used a black cherry balsamic, sounded interesting but was not a good idea!  If I make again....USE THE WHITE VINEGAR!

This salad has been such a hit over and over.  I make the dressing with Splenda at times.  It is still really good.  A diabetic friend really appreciated that.

wonderful! I took the advice of the others reviews and cut the sugar in half. I mixed all the dressing ingredients with my hand blender which mixed the dressing up nicely (i was only able to let it sit in the fridge for 30 min prior to serving so i think blending the ingredients helped the flavors mix.) - I didn't have poppy seeds on hand so had to skip that. Also added fresh feta per one of the other reviews. Very nice mix of flavors and a very nice change!

I  changed it up a bit, and added some things. The dressings is great, but I do think a little less sugar would better. I added blue berries, and pecans that I blanched with a small amount of sugar. I omited the almonds in place of the pecans, and I also omited both seeds.

We loved it. The dressing at first seemed flavorless but just leave it in the fridge for a couple hours before using and the flavors intensify. So yummy!

I was scared when I saw the Worcestershire sauce in this recipe but decided 35,000 people can't be wrong.-This recipe is delicious and nutritious. I used a little over 1/4 cup of honey and sugared some sliced almonds. Next time I might add a little more red onion or have the dressing sit longer. I had red wine vinegar - maybe decrease the amount next time. Blue berries? Raspberries? Pecans? Oranges? I will have to try them all! How about mangoes?

Phenomenal.  I reduced sugar and oil to 1/4 c. and omitted onion.  Kept everything else the same and was truly blown away.

This was an excellent addition to my Father's Day menu.  Everyone was reluctant to try it, but once they did, they did not regret it!  It is very good but the dressing was kinda sweet.  Next time I will use just slivered almonds (using blanched is unneccessary), and less sugar, maybe upping the twang factor a bit.

this dressing is awesome! As a previous reviewer suggested, i cut the sugar to 1/4, and used balsamic vinegar and red onion. I also added a splash or two more of worcestershire and I thinned the dressing out with a little water. It was kinda thick. I didn't have poppy seeds and this was still delish. I added feta crumbles and chicken. I marinated chicken breasts in paprika & garlic salt for an hour, then sauted with red onions frying pan. My hubby and I loved it.

Very Tasty! I did not have white vinegar on hand, so I used balsmic, which was very tasty! I also did not have worcestire sauce on hand or sesame seeds and was still SUPER tasty!  Would make a lovely salad at a shower or luncheon.

I have made this salad for years and everyone loves it.  The only thing I do different is take slivered almonds and saute them in a little butter, sugar and red pepper to give them a sweet hot candied taste.

This is a good salad, easy to prepare. I completely agree with the suggestions to use half the sugar.  It was entirely too sweet.  I might cut back even more than half if using balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar.

Yummy.  I didn't add all the dressing though.  I drizzled a little on each salad.  My son still thought it was too sweet...  Also I didn't have any sesame seeds, so I added sunflower seeds.

I've been making a similar salad for over 30 years... I add drained mandarin oranges to mind and toasted the almonds for extra flavor.  And, I recently tried Trader Joe's Poppy Seed Dressing, and it's almost as good as mine!  So, if you don't have time to make the dressing this is a quick option...  Thanks for the recipe!

This will be a family favorite. I omitted the paprika because for some reason, I didn't have any. I did substituted the white vinegar with Balsamic.  Other than that I made it according to recipe and it was excellent! Thank you for this great recipe :)

A wonderful dish! Brough it to a party and everyone raved about it. You could probably add goat cheese or even brie somehow but it's great if you just follow the recipe.

Seriously one of the best salads I have had in a long time.  I used 1/4 c sugar, red onion and balsamic and someone had suggested.  1/2 cup of sugar would have made the dressing way to sweet.  I received this recipe from a friend and it was so good I passed it on to everyone I knew!

Made this several times last summer...my husband & I both loved it!  We've got spring fever and are craving fresh foods, so it's time to break out the salad recipes again.  I followed the suggestion from other reviews to cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup, and found this to suit our tastes perfectly.

First things first: It's delicious and all guests were pleased. But I made changes before serving. I thought the dressing's texture was too gritty because the huge amt. of sugar didn't melt. Also the poppy seeds don't add anything. I did first toast the almond slivers AND the sesame seeds, which did add to the flavor. I admit to heating the dressing first, to melt the sugar, which helped. I chilled the dressing before serving.  Also, if you're serving this as a first course among several, half the spinach and berries would do nicely. I served 11 people with only 15 ounces of spinach and 2/3 the amount of berries.

A favorite in our house.  I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and substituted balsamic for white vinegar. In the last 3 months I have made this about 5 times at my husband's request, and he is a picky eater.

The dressing can stand on its own merits...use it on any salad you make...we used it for a state-wide convention using canned mandarin oranges, instead of the strawberries, due to the time of year...could not keep up with the requests for seconds!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Cant wait to serve this to guests! I followed others suggestions about using balsalmic vinegar, but fearing it might overwhelm, used 1/2 and 1/2.  Light and delicious!

Wow! This is a fantastic summer salad. I served it with pork chops and I added some feta cheese crumble. Great flavor - not too sweet, yet delightfully tangy.

DEFINITELY cut the sugar down in this recipe!  It was definitely tasty, but more like a dessert than a salad.  I haven't made it again yet, but I think about half the sugar called for would work out well

I had this last year at my sister in laws and at first thought the combination of strawberrys and salad sounded disgusting but after a little taste test I gobbled a bowl and more down!!  I made it myself using a spring mix salad and left out the poppy seeds (as I didn't have any) and gosh was it SOOOOOOO YUMMY!!!  My ENTIRE family LOVES this recipe!!  Thanks so much!

Dressing is very good with 1/2 t. sea salt, but I suppose this addition is personal taste. I think I'll use a little less oil next time. Toasted almonds add a nice crunch.

my review is only for the dressing, as I had to substitute for what I had on hand for the actual salad.  the dressing is fabulous!  i used the amount of sugar it called for as I think it works well for these types of salads.  I think this works well substituting dates and apples for the strawberries as well!

My father has had a hate on for spinach since 1941 but he'll ask for seconds (and sometimes thirds) of this lovely salad.  Like many reviewers I made it exactly as directed the first time and it was wonderful.  These days I do tend to cut back heavily on the sugar, especially since I use a fairly sweet balsamic vinegar in place of the white vinegar.  One of the best things about this recipe is that despite being excellent as-is, it lends itself very well to experimentation.  Don't have strawberries?  Use raspberries instead.  Allergic to nuts?  Use water chestnuts for a little crunchy texture.  Whatever you decide to add into this salad, you're almost certain to like the results.

This recipe is awesome.  If you heat the dressing the sugar dissolves wonderfully.  I also added fresh blueberries and cucumbers with thin sliced red onion.  YUMMY.  I left the seeds out because I didn't have them...it is the best salad I have ever ate.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The only change we make to this recipe is to add a bit of crumbled feta cheese. Also, we usually cut the dressing recipe in half since we don't make nearly as much salad as the recipe is for. We will continue to make this recipe time and time again!! I wish I could give it 10 stars.

I can't believe how delicious this turned out. By far one of the best salads I've ever had in my life. I added blue cheese and avocados since they were on sale. THis will become a regular in our household!

This was amazing! We loved this salad! I added a diced mango as well. I loved the subtle crunch the sesame seeds gave to the salad as well! I made some modifications - I doubled the amount of spinach and used about 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of 1/2 a cup. I omitted the chopped onions and added 2 crushed cloves of garlic to the dressing and made the dressing about 2 hours before I served it and it thicken up nicely. I did not use  all of the dressing - otherwise it would have been swimming in dressing.I also added chopped red onions. I will come back to this recipe over and over again!

Amazing and new favorite salad!  The only change I did was use candied pecans and blue cheese instead of feta.  May try it with less sugar next time although the dressing did coat the strawberries (making them sweeter) and made the salad almost taste like a dessert.

Wow...that's all I can say.  I was a little concerned with the ingredients, but followed it through to the end.  The only thing I didn't add was poppy seeds, and I used white balsamic for the vinegar and it was the best salad I have ever tasted.  My husband agrees too!

My husband never thought he'd like this salad because he doesn't enjoy vinegarette dressings, but he loved it!  I tossed in some romaine lettuce and alfalfa sprouts and we were able to munch on it for the rest of the week (I made the dressing on the side of course).

Delicious!  A great salad, tasty enough for a special occasion but simple enough for a regular dinner at home.  I agree with the others in the addition of balsamic vinegar, it adds a sweet flavor. If you have it, try to add a bit of sesame oil to the dressing. I didn't have almonds so I substituted chopped pecans.  I added a special step...put the nuts in a hot pan and add about 1/8 cup of sugar, the sugar will melt and carmelize.  What a yummy sweet/salty addition!  Great recipe!

I made this for a friend's birthday party last summer and people are STILL talking to me about it! They've made me promise to make it again when strawberries are back in season. The key is in the sauce - it makes it unique and absolutely delicious!

Loved this!  It was a nice chance from my typical salad.  Next time, I will use 12oz of spinach, and decrease the sugar to 1/3 cup.   It was a bit too sweet, with a bit too much dressing for my taste.    Update:  I tried making this using Splenda instead of sugar.  It tasted just as good!

The only change I made was in cutting the olive oil in half and adding water and a little extra vinegar in it's place.

Excellent salad.

Again - use no more than half the sugar (I would use even less), and substitue the vinegar for balsamic. Turns out great (and the dressing tastes really nice even with just plain lettuce)

I loved this recipe!  In fact, it's one of my favorites on this site.  I cut down the sugar, used balsamic vinegar, red onion, and feta cheese just like recommended.  It was wonderful!  I also added in some blueberries and called the salad, "Life Longevity On a Plate."  Very healthful, and full of antioxidants!

this was really great.  i thought the salad could use some cheese, maybe feta or goat, and the dressing could use a bit less sugar.  Other than that, it was great and i am guessing that the dressing will be even better tomorrow.  thanks!

You can't beat the dressing on this salad, it is to die for.  Pair it with the peanutty pork kabobs from this site and you will have a gourmet meal that will please your guests!

OMG... this is soooo good!  The hubby was a little hesitant at first, but he absolutely loved it too!!  :)  I didn't chill the dressing first, and didn't have sesame seeds.   Otherwise, I followed recipe accordingly.  I served it with Stuffed Eggplant Parmesan and fresh Italian Bread.  A 5 star meal!  Will make again :)

A very refreshing salad on a hot day.  I recommend not to dump the dressing on the salad, rather keep it in the bowl and allow people to use the dressing at the disrection

This is almost like what my mom used to make so I was excited to try it.  I did not expect it to be the same, but was thinking it lacked a few things that made hers spectacular.  Next time, I will cut down on the seeds by 1/2 and the onion and add grapes to the strawberries.  I liked it, but it was too grainy, but probably very good for me!  Thanks- this gave me a great base to play with.

Oh WOW!  Great salad!  I haven't been very creative with salad before but this is so inspiring!  I made this with my own beef kabob recipe and WHAT A GREAT SUMMER MEAL!  Everyone loved it!  The only changes I made were out of necessity.  I didn't have any of the required seeds so I omited them completely.  Also, I didn't have any Worsh sauce so I used a dash of low sodium soy and a smidge of sodium free beef boullion.

Figured I would jump on board and rate this five stars along with everyone else.  It's so easy and delicious.  I didn't have poppy seeds, and can't imagine that it would make any difference, but I'll try next time.  I don't usually enjoy sweet salad dressings, but I'm happy I stepped out of my rut and gave it a try. Yum!

We loved this recipe.  I made it with only a few minor changes.  Based on other recommendations I used balsamic rather than white vinegar.  I did not have an onion so it was omitted.  I added an extra 1/4 cup of balsamic because, with the 1/2 cup of sugar, it was still to thick to pour well.  The dressing turned out delicious and the spinach with strawberries was a perfect match.  I topped it all with toasted slivered almonds and toasted pecan halves.

We liked it as is, but you could easily cut the sugar in half and still have a great recipe. Just be sure the rest of your dinner is not on the sweet side and you will be fine. Very summery.

Get your taste buds prepared for a sweet - not savory - salad.  It is a refreshing change from the norm.  I added 1/4 C. more Balsamic Vinegar, and double the onion.  I also added grilled chicken to make it a meal.   Just terrific!

This recipe is INSANELY good!!!  The only changes I made were using balsamic vinegar, toasting the almonds, and serving the dressing on the side.  This one will leave you wanting to lick your plate!  YUM!  As others suggested, I bet it would be good with mandarin oranges if you don't have strawberries.  The dressing makes it over the top delicious!

PERFECT summer salad!  Light and great.  I may cut the oil down in the dressing next time, as it was a little much for me.  Love that there are only 3 main ingredients in the salad.

Absolutely yummy!  I made it for Mother's Day 2008 for the first time, and all 15 family members at brunch that day raved about it.  My 14 year old son had three helpings for dinner that night and even my picky husband loved it! It's going to be my choice for the next potluck I attend.

Outstanding. I have looked over this recipe for so long because I don't really care for fruit in my salad, and I just didn't think I would like it. Whoa! Was I wrong! This is a fantastic salad and even my husband, who didn't quite know what to make of it when he saw it, was impressed. A five star as is, but next time I am thinking of adding warm bacon or feta. Then it will be off the charts! Thank you!

I have made this many times and it is always a crowd pleaser.  Everyone always wants the recipe and there is never any left.  The only change I make is I cut the sugar down to a little more than half of what the recipe calls for and I omit the sesame and poppy seeds.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have to admit, I was trying too many new recipes at once and goofed a little on this one. I picked apart a store bought rotisserie chic. and then marinated it in italian dressing. (Very good idea if you plan on adding it to a pasta salad, by the way:).)Made the dressing in this recipe with vanilla-fig balsamic and 1/4 cup sugar... everything else the same. I toasted the almonds which to me really brings out their flavor. So, in the end, I had the spinach, strawberries, toasted almonds, I added feta cheese and the dressing and then topped it with the marinated chicken. It was a complete meal and everyone loved it! What a yummy combo! Thanks for sharing such a great salad.

Delish!  My husband (who hates strawberries) inhaled it and has requested it several times since I first made this! Used 1/2 the amount of sugar and subbed balsamic vinegar (for the white)...dressing is good with or without poppy seeds.  Also, shallots or purple onions are our favorite!  Fabulous!

I made this for the first time for an Easter party. Many of my guests asked what was in the dressing and said they loved it; another guest said she normally doesn't like spinach and that this is how she'll eat it from now on. I made the dressing the night before and put it in the fridge and it was fine - I think the sugar kept the olive oil from solidifying like olive oil based dressing often does in the fridge, so I didn't have to "thaw" the dressing before use. I will definitely make this often in the future when strawberries are in season! In my boyfriend's words, "it was... really good."

Excellent salad!  However, I did make a few changes: 1) I used half of the amout of sugar called for in the dressing--it would have been far too sweet otherwise; 2) I used white wine vinegar instead of distilled vinegar for a little more flavor; 3) I omitted the sesame seeds out of personal preference; 4) I substituted toasted pecans for the almonds--although almonds would probably be good as well; and 5) I topped everything with crumbled bleu cheese.  With these minor changes/additions it was a hit at my Easter dinner table!

We have been making a variation of this salad for years. The only changes I would suggest are adding finely chopped red onion to the dressing and when making it, use balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar. you wont be disappointed!

Very good! I have made a few changes and this salad is one of my faves. strawberries, red onion, cherry tomatoes, PINE NUTS (they make the salad), baby spinach lettuce and a rasp vin.  Annie's naturals has a great rasp vin. enjoy!

Delicious!!  I have made this for many years.  Great with a bbq!
I like to use half spinach and half butter lettuce.  I prefer to keep the dressing to the side (in a bottle) so everyone can add as much or little as they desire.  Also it keeps everything nice and crisp!

Forgot to put in the sugar, used Raspberry balsamic vinegar and olive oil, and took others advice and crumbled a bit of blue cheese in. It was fantastic. A real keeper.

I made this with recommended amount of sugar and threw it out it was so sweet. Then remade it using 1/2 the sugar which was acceptable but still too much in my opinion. Finally made it a third time using 1/4 cup maple syrup and I have to say  the salad was loved by everyone at the dinner party. A great combination of taste colours and textures, just go easy on the sugar in this.

I have made this salad three times now...once for a potluck Christmas dinners full of wonderful cooks!
Everyone LOVED it... the dressing is perfect with the spinach and berries. I love the seeds!
The red of the strawberries looks beautiful against the deep green spinach.
Thank you!

I made this recipe for a company picnic this summer, and I've never handed out a recipe after the fact as often as I've handed this one out. The tang of the balsamic vinegar was a perfect offset to the sweetness of the strawberries... it was very good!

I made this salad last night along with casserole.  It was delicious although I did make a few changes.  First I had no poppy or sesame seeds so I left those out, second I used 1/4 c of sugar and I still thought it was too sweet- next time I will use 1/8, I added about a teaspoon of salt and since strawberrys are our of season I used some canned peaches.  I also added some goat cheese.  It was delicious!

I have been making this basic recipe for about a year, but instead of the minced onion use half a purple onion, thinly sliced and quartered. I love the difference between the onion and stawberries and dressing. I have not used any nuts in mine. I always get compliments when this is served and everyone asks for the recipe.

Awesome salad!  Added a touch more olive oil and a few splashes of balsamic vinegar to balance out the sweetness and give it a flavor burst.  Everyone loved it and I even forgot the almonds on accident.  I added gorgonzola cheese crumbles for added flavor.  It tasted like it was from a restaurant.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was very good, but I did make some adjustments. I added half the sugar that it was called for, and even then, I thought it was still a little too sweet; added only one tbsp of sesame seeds, and a little more vinager than what was called for (I also used half white distilled vinager and half raspberry balsamic vinager). I served this and was given many compliments.

I've made this twice now--a big hit!!  I substituted walnuts instead of almonds.  Also took some other advice and used 1/2 the amount of sugar--it's SO yummy!

Update (years later and still making this recipe!) for Whole 30!  The dressing is not W30 compliant, so I made the normal dressing recipe for my guests, but I tweaked mine and it turned out great!  W30:  I used 1/2 the amounts of seeds,  onion, olive oil and paprika, used 1/4 cup Apple Cider Vinegar instead of white vinegar, minced four strawberries (used this instead of sugar), left out all of the non-compliant ingredients (Worcestershire sauce, sugar).  Yum!!

I didn't like it.  First of all the sugar never dissolved... yuck!  Maybe my oil was bad or something, but the dressing just was not good to me.  Maybe if the salad had more ingredients like other fruits or chicken it would have helped.  Definitely not a keeper for me.

Light, refreshing, and perfect for summer. My family thought it was to sweet so I will be serving the dressing on the side from now on.

Wonderful flavors! Too much dressing in proportion to the greens, however. I cut the dressing recipe in half and had plenty. I also used a lot less sugar in the dressing, just a preference.

This salad was amazing. I went strawberry picking that afternoon then made the salad for dinner. what an amazing recipe to go with such yummy fresh strawberries. I did use balsamic vinegar instead of regular and kalamata olive oil. this is my new favorite salad.

I made this for a bunch of my family for Mother's Day, and I couldn't believe how much everyone loved this...even the really picky eaters who think that salad consists only of iceburg lettuce and cheese:)  It was a simple, delicious recipe, and I'll definitely be making it again.

My wife is 7 weeks pregnant and starting to get “fussy” about what she eats. Just the thought of some foods makes her feel queasy! Yesterday, when she told me she didn’t think she could eat ANYTHING I had to think fast. I looked around the site until I found this AMAZING salad recipe! Lots of strawberries for vitamin C, plus all that spinach! Woo-hoo! A combo she not only LOVED but ate a lot of! Both of us polished off a good 5oz. of spinach and a ½ quart of strawberries! The dressing is superb! This is now one of our favorites!

This seriously delicious and great as a meal with some bread.  Definitely make when the strawberries are in season.  When they're really juicy they make the whole dressing even sweeter.

We loved this recipe -  my husband really enjoyed it; I think it's because with all the berries, almonds, and sugar, it's almost more like a dessert than a salad. I think it would be great with grilled chicken breast on top. We will make this one over and over - great flavors and looks very sophisticated. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This so so delicious. I didn't have the sesame seeds and substituted cider vinegar for the white and brown sugar for white sugar (didn't have the white) but it was absolutely delicious. I also for the oil used half water and half oil to cut down on fat and calories. This will be something I make again and again. Thank you.

I never would have created a recipe like this on my own and had never tried anything like it -- it was an amazing hit with my family!  I served it with quiche and it was the perfect "sweet" complement to the savory quiche.  I will make this again!

I made this salad for Easter and everyone liked it.  It is to have a salad so different from anything I have had before.  I left out the sesame and poppy seeds, but did everything else just as the recipe stated and it was wonderful.

Excellent salad!  I was skeptical - only strawberries, almonds and spinach?!  But the dressing MADE it.  I accidentally used an extra tablespoon of poppyseeds and it made no difference.  It was fantastic.  My whole family raved.  Thanks!

Sooooo good! We ate the whole bowl the first day I made it. The only complain I have is that it is a little bit too sweet for us.  I am going to make it again tonight and us Equal and more vinager and less surgar.  Other than the sweetness it is really good.  Love it for summer!

This was easy and delicious.  Made it two nights in a row!  Edit:  Forget my saying I made it two nights in a row - we became addicted to this one - like another reviewer said - it is like a desert!  Everyone I've served this to loves it.  I actually make this when I want a snack at night when I am watch TV!!!  And I don't feel guilty snacking out since it is healthy!!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you submitter.

Really good salad. I didnt have any strawberries so I used fresh raspberries instead. My husband loved it. *update* I made this salad again for Easter using fresh strawberries. But I cut the sugar back to about 1/4 cup or so. It's way too sweet with a 1/2 cup. Also used dried minced onion since I was on a time restraint and didn't feel like cutting onions and replaced white vinegar with white Balsamic vinegar. Let the dressing sit for an hour in the fridge, as recipes indicates. It was DELICIOUS! Everyone raved about how tasty it was. This is the salad I WILL be taking to family functions from now on..per the overwhelming request from my family!

This is such a great treat! However, I substituted raspberry balsamic vinegar for the plain white.  It just added a little more flavor.  My boyfriend wanted to save it to END the meal! Can't wait to serve at a party!

Wonderful salad!  I put the salad plates in the freezer to chill. Have all ingrediants ready to go.  When it is time to serve the salad I take the plates out and arrange everything on the chilled plates.  Drizzle the dressing on and serve.  Very pretty presentation!  Guests love it!

Ok, if you are here reading these reviews HESITATE no more!! 500 people cant be wrong, and yes I was one of them who was thinking... "what will the company think?" The company thought it was fantastic. I didnt have the poppy seeds but used the rest of the recipe. Also added pine nuts and topped it with a balsamic glaze I bought at the store. It almost looked like chocolate stripes on top of that salad. Great recipe!

I have made this salad many times and it is always a hit.  Some alterations I have made are that I use 1 TB of seasame seeds (sometimes toasted), 1/2 TB poppy seeds, 1/4 cup sugar (or Splenda), 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup vinegar, 1/2 TB minced onion.  I also usually don't serve with the almonds (to save calories) but they are really good with it.

This is a perfect summer salad.  Instead of almonds I used pine nuts and it was so delicious.  I also couldn't find poppy seeds in the store, so I didn't use them and the salad still tasted wonderful.  I will be making this again for sure!  And it is also a good way to eat your spinach!!!

I made this for a girls' retreat weekend and while everyone raved about it, I found the dressing a bit bland for my taste. Next time I would add balsamic vinegar and feta as others suggested for a bit more kick.

This is a fantastic salad!  Refreshing for a hot summer day.  My spinach wilted, and I was a bit dissapointed with that, but it was still really good.  I added a bit of balsamic vinegar to the dressing and added feta cheese to the salad and it turned out really good.  I will definately make this one again!

This is a great salad recipe. I have made it for the last couple of years and its always met with rave reviews. I like adding crumbled goat cheese and chicken for a little extra tang and substance. That really makes it a meal. Usually I dont put the minced onion in the dressing either, but you dont miss it. This is a great summer salad.

This was delicious! I followed the other suggestions and used less sugar. I also omitted the sesame seeds,added Feta cheese, and used balsamic vinegar in place of white. Very easy to make and it got rave reviews! This is something I will make often.

I made this salad for my Salad day at work.  This was a HIT!!  When reading the comments they said to not put in the 1/2 cup sugar.  It was hard to do that since I scaled the servings to 12.  And that called for 1 ½ cups sugar and I only put a cup in.  When making this I also ran out of Olive Oil and I only put a cup of that in.  Oh, and I omitted the onions.  
I also made the dressing in plenty of time and it chilled for about 4 hours.  I will definitely make this again.  Very refreshing for a summer day!! Thank you!!

I was a little unsure on what to expect with the strawberries, but this salad was very refreshing, and the strawberries and almonds were absolutely deliciously with the salad dressing and spinach.  Everyone loved it.  I toasted the sesame seeds and the almonds which added a delicious flavor.  This sure is a wonderful change from the usual summer salads.  This recipe will be added to our family's favorites.  Thanks for sharing it!

We loved this salad!  I did use less sugar (1/4 C.) and olive oil (slightly less than 1/2 C.) as some others noted and it turned out fantastic! Thanks! This will become a favorite!

This salad was excellent! I would have given it 5 stars but DO NOT ADD a 1/2 cup of sugar!  Way way too much.  Based on other reviews I reduced it to 1/4 cup and that was still to much.  Next time I will add about 2 tbls.  I also used balsamic Vinegar and added some Feta cheese. This really was a great salad.

Served this salad with spaghetti dinner yesterday and it went over well. Used spring mix rather than spinach. Definitely add only 1/4 cup sugar (even a bit less), 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/2 cup olive oil (next time, I will add a bit less than 1/2 cup).  I did not add paprika or poppy seeds and the dressing was still awesome. And listen to the other reviewers- add the dressing at the table unless you want a wet and wilty salad.  
Perfect salad for summer!

A big hit at Easter dinner.  It disappeared quickly.  I substituted apple cider vinegar and veg. oil, and used shallots instead of onion since that is what I had on hand.

Delicious!  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 because I have sensitive teeth, and I reduced the oil to 1/4 to match the vinegar.  Loved the strawberries!  I used almost the exact recipe, but with cranberries, in the fall.

Very good.  I split the difference with the sugar so I used a total of 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons.  Just right.  I also added some crumbled Gorgonzola cheese and it was a good contrast with the sweet dressing but it is great without the cheese too.  Thanks for this recipe.

Yum. A hit at a recent lunch. When I make it again, I might decrease the oil just a bit and add a little crumbled goat cheese. Good as is, though ...

This is a fabulous salad. Reminds me of dessert! Flavorful way to eat your spinach greens. Note, the salad will get soggy if you let it sit. Only mix the dressing as you eat a serving.

This recipe was so good!  A few changes made.  I did not refridgerate the dressing before hand.  It makes it clump together.  I also left out the onions since the men wont eat them.  Any leftover will get VERY soggy, and it makes alot more dressing then needed. The bottom part if the salad was too drenched, and I didnt even add all of it to the mix!  Overall, wonderful flavor and I wll DEF make again!!!

Made this for my son's birthday party.  I used baby spinach, cut down on the sugar and substituted red wine vinegar for the white.  WELL.. the inlaws gobbled it up and I didn't get one bite. I had to make it again the next day so I could try myself.  Delicious!!  I'm sure they would rate it the same.  :o)

This is a delicious salad!  I cut the sugar in half (used Splenda), and it was more than sweet enough for me.  Instead of making this in a huge bowl for a party or picnic, I made up a small portion to take for lunch.  What a treat!  The dressing is yummy (but be sure to check your teeth for poppyseeds and sesame seeds)!  Once you've tried it, you can add other items that you personally enjoy, such as crumbled blue cheese.  Thanks for a great lunch today!

I've made this recipe several times over the past few months.  It's great for a barbeque or a large group and always gets rave reviews.  I've used pecans as well as coarsly chopped almonds.  I always toast the nuts for a few minutes in a heavy skillet on the stove.  This adds a lot of flavor to the salad.

I was very skeptical but once again, allrecipes has come through! The mix of strawberries, spinach and almonds is a winner! I cut the sugar down to 1/4 c, however the dressing was still a bit sweet for us. Next time I will reduce it further, and cut the amount of poppy seeds in half as well (they were a bit overpowering). Overall a really good salad.

I made this for a group of girlfriends for lunch, served with a quiche, and they loved it!  It is a great summer salad and easy to prepare.  I made the dressing that morning, so it sat alot longer than an hour.  I forgot to add the almonds, but it still was great!

I tried this, on my guest for Easter dinner, because of the high ratings it got.  I was not disapointed.  Everyone raved about this salad and helped themselves to more servings.  Thank You I'll use it again.   Oregon

My family gobbled this up and insisted I make it again the next day, and the next! I added some blue cheese crumbles and sliced onions to the salad, substituted dried cranberries for the strawberries and used balsamic vinegar in the dressing. Yum. I'm looking forward to trying a blueberry/walnut version.

Loved this, served it for Easter Brunch.  The dressing tastes way better after soaking over night, so make it the night before you want to use it.  I used a little less sugar than called for.  Used red wine vinegar, and toasted the almonds.  YUM!  This will be a staple in our fridge this summer!!  This is also good with store-bought raspberry vinagrette dressing, if you don't want to wait for the poppyseed dressing suggested in the recipe (much faster).

We really enjoyed this salad.  I didn't have sesame seeds or paprika, but the dressing still turned out well.  I didn't have the distilled white vinegar, but white wine vinegar worked fine.  Thanks, Andrea, for an unusual, colorful & refreshing salad recipe!

This salad really was delicious. I grated the onion so that it was almost undetectable, added 1/4 tsp of ground mustard, and don't forget to toast the almonds! I got raves from my whole family. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I've probably considered this recipe a thousand times but always found something different as I'm not a fan of strawberries. I was stumped for a side dish to go along with fiery Cajun shrimp.  One of the reviewers said that they served this with spicy shrimp and loved it.  So, I gave it a try and another and another and another.  It was wonderful!  My hubby loved it, too.  I used the balsamic and the full amount of sugar.  My husband doesn't do poppy seeds.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing.  Thank You!

I have been making this exact recipe for years, and I've got to be honest...this is better than any salad I have ever had in a restaraunt or elsewhere. It is the perfect blend of sweet and tangy, and so summery!! The only thing I struggle with is it gets quite soggy, so sometimes I give the dressing on the side so it doesn't complete saturate the spinach. The difference between the original recipe and this one that makes this one MORE delicious is....(drumroll) worcestire!! It sounds a little different, but makes it incredibly tasty, it makes a world of differnece!!

I made this for Mother's Day dinner and everyone loved it - not one bit left over.  I used 12 oz. spinach and thought the amount of dressing was just right.  Substituted balsamic vinegar for white vinegar, walnuts for almonds, and added about 1/3 cup blue cheese.  Delicious!

I had to try this after seeing all of the great reviews and I was not disapointed.  At the suggestion of others I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and it was still quite sweet; I think the full amount would have been TOO sweet for my taste.  The dressing almost tasted as if it had balsamic vinegar in it. I tossed the dressing in at the last minute, which kept the spinach crisp.  Delicious.

I guess I wasn't the only one to make this for Easter dinner! It was a delicious salad, but I agree that it makes a lot of dressing. I also served it with a dish of gorgonzola cheese on the side for those who wanted to sprinkle it on top. It was a great combination of sweet, spicy and salty.

I have to admit, we all were a little skeptical because we tasted the dressing right after we mixed it, but once we added it to the salad it was a totally different taste. Needless to say it ended up being a HUGE hit, everyone absolutely loved this – thank you for sharing!

I used 12 oz of spinach, and had exactly the right amount of dressing?!?   I also took the advice to use Balsamic and cut  down the sugar, which worked wonderfully.  I still only use this for special occasions, too much white sugar for me.  Lastly, I toasted the sesames and almonds (I used chopped instead of slivered, because that is what was in the house!)

I had many people ask me for the recipe when I made this for a party recently.  I used balsalmic vinegar and cut the sugar down to 3/8 of a cup.  I doubled the spinach & strawberries and kept the dressing the same, and it was still too much dressing. I would definitely make this again.

Unlike Popeye, I didn't think I liked spinach, but decided to prepare it after reading the great reviews. After a family cook-out, I had to print the recipe for everyone that attended, so they too could spread this delightful and healthy bowl of greens. Thanks Andrea

Great recipe.  Not often does my husband eat all of his salad.  I only made enough for 1/2 of the recipe, but did make a few alterations.  A touch too sweet, so I added a bit more vinegar, worcestershire, and paprika to taste.  I then added a few drops of some very strong sesame seed oil to enhance the seeds.  I tossed it in with feta cheese as another reviewer commented and left out the strawberries and nuts.  Guess it wasn't the exact same recipe, but gave it five stars because the base dressing was good to begin with.

I made this for some friends and they all loved it.  I only used half the sugar the recipe called for, and I used balsamic vinegar like some others suggested.  I didn't use nearly the amount of strawberries because they are so expensive this time of year.  It was still wonderful and crumbled blue cheese added a great flavor also.

OK, this one's a classic. I haven't found anyone who doesn't like it. What a painless way to eat spinach. If you bring it to a potluck, make sure and bring the recipe because everyone will want a copy. Toasting the almonds gives them a nice flavor, but not necessary if you don't want to go to the extra trouble.

TO DIE FOR!! This was such an easy and not to mention delicious salad!  You would never know how easy it was by the taste.  I only had roasted sesame seeds, and it added such a unique flavor to it!  I also sauteed pecans instead of almonds in some butter and sprinkled with sugar until they carmelized.  The combination of the different flavors was just excellent!  A definite keeper and my new "potluck" dish!

I read quite a few of the reviews of this salad before beginning its preparation, and I must agree that this is absolutely delicious "as is".  However, on my second prep I slightly reduced the amount of sugar, added some bleu cheese (as others had suggested) and used balasmic rather than regular vinegar.  Bellisimo!
I scaled this to serving ten and got nine "WOWs" from the diners (I was modest and just smiled!).  I'm not truly sure the paprika is all that useful in larger quantity.  I'd suggest you chill everything for about two hours before serving... really adds a nice element to the overall experience.

Wonderful salad !  I never would've tried it, but so many favorable reviews made me curious.  I took suggestion of substiuting honey for sugar.  So good that I made it twice in one week !

Had two couples coming to dinner, he & she of one couple are both chefs- no pressure there! This salad received wonderful compliments. Have made several times since. But when doubling, don't bother to double the dressing. It's way too much. Next time I'll 1/2 the sesame seeds, try pecans, maybe crumbled bacon.

I can't fault anything about this recipe.  It is number 1 on my husband's list now.(Replacing Orange Mandarin),,,,and I have prepared it for several dinner parties with all enjoying. It never fails you. The only  thing I did differently was to omit the seeds from the dressing since we don't care for them. Thanks Andrea....It is delicious..jchamp

This is a great recipe! I love homemade dressings, yet it's always difficult to find one that's just right. Well, you hit the mark with this one! I had all the ingredients on hand (which never happens) and have already made it for family and friends. It's always a hit. Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe; I also reduced the sugar, and increased the Worcestershire sauce to 1 tsp.  I would definitely make it again, and try it with whatever fruit is in season.

This is an excellent salad!  I also followed the advice of previous reviewers and decreased the sugar.  I also used raspberry vinegar.  I made the dressing the night before and toasted the almonds.  Be sure to dissolve the sugar in the vinegar first.  This is a first rate salad!

I needed a quick, easy and well liked recipe for a potluck dish.  Having a brand new baby in the house limits me from spending too much time in the kitchen preparing food of any kind.  This was a dish that went over very well, had people ask me for the recipe.  Give it a try, you'll be surprised how good it is.

I used half the amount of sesame seeds and of the poppy seeds.  I also substituted raspberry wine vinegar in place of the white vinegar.  Very nice tasting dressing.

This salad is beautiful and DELICIOUS!  The dressing is perfect if you cut the sugar to 1/3 cup as others have suggested.  I agree that the dressing is much more than needed-you could almost double the amount of spinach and the dressing would be plenty.  I am so happy to have this recipe...I have already shared it with several friends!

Andrea is a good friend of mine and when she told me about a Starwberry Spinach salad
I thought it would be gross.
I made it for the 4th of July and not only did everyone say it was great, my very picky husband 
even had seconds.  Thanks Andrea, he never ate Spinach before.  Great recipe!

Everyone loved this salad. I made a few variations. Because of allergy reasons I omitted the sesame seeds and onions. I also added mandarian oranges they really complimented the taste of the salad.

I have made this salad many times for parties, and it always been an incredible hit.  I reduced the sugar to 1/3 of a cup in response to prior reviews.  I have never had a problem with the sugar not dissolving.  Make sure you do chill the salad before serving it.  It really makes a difference.

I recently had this at a birthday party and absolutely loved it!  I can't remember how much I ate; but I couldn't get enough.  My husband loves spinach, so I'm certain this will be on the menu quite often this summer!  Thanks!

Reaaaally tasty! I'm always looking for new and special 'green' salad recipes, and this is the best I've found in a long time. I tried it with half and half spinach and romaine, and this was a lovely combination. Next time, though, I'll use fewer berries, as I found 4 cups was way too much, and I'll cut back on the amount of oil as I don't want to get all that fat from a salad.

Fabulous! Fabulous! I didn't have a covered jar, so I whisked the dressing in a bowl and that dissolved the sugar pretty well (although, I did use 1/3c. instead of 1/2c.)  This recipe is a must-try!!

This is also so spectacular with banana's sliced into it!  I got the same recipe (but lost it... so happy to find it here) from my sister in law.  The recipe she gave me included banana's.  Give it a try!

This is an outstanding recipe.  I had trouble getting the sugar to dissolve but had great success substituting seedless berry jelly for the sugar.  Unsweetened berry jelly also works extremely well for a diabetic option.  Honey also worked well but did not compliment the berries as well as using jelly.

This was wonderful!  I was skeptical at first, because I didn't think I would like the strawberry and spinach combination.  I figured all these rave reviews weren't for nothing.  This is definitely a keeper.  Now I wish you could get good strawberries all year long. Mmm!  Mmm!

Use the 1/2 cup of oil, but cut the amount of sugar to 1/8 cup

Instead of distilled vinegar,raspberry or balsamic vinegar may be used

Other fruit may be used as well, oranges and kiwi work well

I changed the recipe a little to suit my own tastes, but it turned out great! I added pecans instead of almonds and Basalmic vinegar instead of the wine vinegar. I was pleasently surprised with how it turned out.

I did what others suggested and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and used Balsamic Vinegar instead of white vinegar. I also finely chopped red onion instead of the minced onion, which I assume was dried?  I also used both strawberries and blueberries.  I used feta cheese (no blue cheese) and I topped it with some roasted almond slices.  Everyone at the party loved it!

This recipe now replaces a previous one I had. Made this for my daughter's baby shower and everyone asked for the recipe! I did lower the sugar amount by half, and replaced the almonds with caramelized walnuts. I chose to serve the walnuts on the side ( for those who may have a nut allergy) as well as the  yummy dressing . That way  the leftover salad stayed fresh and I enjoyed it again the next day. This is a definite winner!

Delish!!!  Added some feta cheese crumbles and blueberries.  Hubby (who is a major carnivore) said he would eat it once a week.  Backed off on the sugar by half based on the reviews.  Probably would have been fine to just leave the sugar as is since my strawberries weren't really sweet/ripe.  Candied some pecans instead of using the almonds.  Yum!!

I've made this recipe twice. Both were for pot luck gatherings. Gotten several requests for the recipe both times. I added 4 ounces of crumbled goat cheese the 2nd time. I think it made the salad even better.

Can I give it 6 stars?! I didn't have the white wine vinegar so I used some white wine instead! And I added pistachios because I had some crushed leftover from another meal. Wow! I didn't change anything else. Nice job! And yes! My 8 year old ate it and loved it!
I disagree with cutting back on the sugar. It's meant to be that sweet to perfectly marry the strawberries...especially if they are in season. The spinach won't wilt. I left it in the fridge with the dressing mixed in and I was surprised at how firm it stayed. Make sure you dry the spinach first though. That saves it from wilting. I think balsamic creates a different recipe all together. Use the white wine. You won't regret it. And put the onion in a food processor. It saves time and then you don't even see it in the salad for those finicky eaters.

OMG! This is wonderful. Followed recipe exactly except I used sugared pecans instead of almonds. Will make this again!

I brought this salad to a pot luck yesterday.  The ingredients are simple; it's the dressing that give it the punch. There wasn't a speck left.  Instead of distilled white vinegar, I used Jamie Oliver's Pinot White Wine Vinegar. I also, for fun, I sauteed the almonds in butter, white sugar and a bit of oil until they were just barely golden.

I use a purple onion and slice it thin and add to salad, then don't put onion in dressing.  It is more flavorful and pretty.  My family always loves it. - Margaret

Though we loved the flavor of the dressing, it was very thick when I pulled it out of the fridge.  I actually had to add a tiny bit of water to the dressing to thin it out enough to pour onto the salad.  That being said, we ate up the whole thing!

I made this recipe yesterday and it just may be one of my favorite salads/dressings of all time!  I made the dressing, just shy of 1/2 cup sugar, but didn't chill it as suggested by another member.  I let it sit on the counter in a mason jar until ready to serve.  Quick shake up was all it needed at the table.  I added blueberries and sliced honey roasted almonds to the salad and served it with the dressing on the side.  I added a sprinkle of feta over mine and it was by far the tastiest salad I've had in a long time!  (I'm already dreading the end of strawberry season.) Thanks for sharing!

Made for ladies tennis party. Everyone loved it and of course I had to email dressing out. I changed the dressing up the first time but the second time followed recipe exactly. I used spinach, strawberries, red onion, feta and caramelized sliced almonds. I suggest using blue cheese, cranberries, red onion, and candied pecans for another variation. Excellent summer dish!

Absolutely loved this salad and I made it as stated, no changes. The only tip I would add is to add the dressing just before serving as the spinach wilts quickly. Definitely will make again.

This salad is sooooo good! I also decreased the sugar and oil.  I used Balsamic vinegar and it was a huge hit.  A known salad snob even asked me for the recipe.  I like the versatility of the use of fruit and nuts.

I loved this! I didn't have almonds, but I had pecans on hand so I caramelized  the pecans in sugar in olive oil until golden tossed them in the salad.  Very elegant salad and I am sure the almonds would have been just as fabulous had I had them on hand.

I made this according to directions but admittedly forgot the almonds. The dressing was way too sweet for me. And I actually didn't care for the strawberries in it. But I will make again with almonds and adjust my review accordingly.
=====
Update: I did not even want to make the rest of this salad. just too sweet. Rating downgraded to 1 star.

Love this recipe! I did tweek it a little though. Like others, I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup. The white vinegar was too strong for me-left me "puckering" after eating the salad :)! - so I changed from white vinegar to WHITE WINE VINEGAR, and it was perfect! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This salad is AMAZING! Very fresh, light and tastes like summer! I made it for Mother's Day and my whole family ate a LARGE bowl of it. They kept asking if I was sure I didn't have anymore in the kitchen. The only addition I added was chopped raw yellow onion to the salad. There is something about strawberries and raw onions that I love.

Love this easy  nutritious,beautiful summer salad.  I only use One TBS of sugar, and added Feta cheese on top.  Other than that, followed simple directions for delicious salad.  Will be making this one a lot!  The entire family loved this one!

Excellent!  I followed the recipe except that I substituted roasted pecans for the almonds and added some sliced red onion and crumbled goat cheese.  The dressing came out very creamy; I followed another suggestion and made it in the blender and it was quick and easy.  I have enough left over for another salad!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a wonderful and easy recipe to prepare! I read MANY of the reviews before making it and since I can't say what it tastes like with the ingredients listed, I do know that using balsamic vinegar and red onion in my dressing was fantastic. I did reduce the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup. I had the dressing on the side so that my company could add as much or as little as they liked. This was a delicious addition to our menu and one that I will use again and again. I agree that adding chicken made for a wonderful meal. A little dressing does go a long way, so use sparingly.

SO good.  Made a lot of changes based on other reviews: used red onions and about tripled them, used half cup balsamic and quarter cup olive oil, decreased sugar to a quarter cup, skipped the poppy seeds and the worcestershire, used strawberries and mangoes, used candied pecans instead of almonds, added fat free feta and goat cheese.  So basically I made an entirely different recipe, but it was still amazing!!  Perfect for a hot day!!

THIS SALAD WAS SOOOO GOOD. I USED CRISPY BACON BROKEN UP AND BACON FAT INSTEAD OF OLIVE OIL USED A FEW GREEN ONIONS CHOPPED THIN AND SUN-FLOWER SEED FOR NUTS. ALSO SPRINKLED SHREDDED SHARP CHEDDAR. USED LESS SUGAR AND VINEGAR. THIS SALAD IS SO GOOD IT WOULD BE HARD TO MESS IT UP.

enough dressing for three times the amount of salad that this makes.  Tripled the almonds, though, cuz we like the crunch.  tried reducing the sugar to half, but ended up using the full amount.

Out of this world! We love this salad. Some great additions to the strawberries: mandarin oranges, red onion slices, and sunflower seeds (in place of the almonds). The dressing is best when it is chilled(much thicker), but it is still fabulous if you are in a time crunch.

Did not have Sesame seeds, did not use almonds, I put in Strawberries, blueberries and also added Blackberries right before serving. Also added dressing right before serving each individual salad, that way it did not get soggy. I think you should just improvise with this recipe, it will be great with raspberries also.My husband love it.

This is the perfect strawberry spinach salad! I loved it and so did the other 20 people at the family gathering I was attending. I doubled the recipe and the bowl was licked clean. I had plenty of leftover dressing though, which is great because I want to make more salad, it was so good! I decided to add green onions to the salad and not put any in the dressing just because that's what I had. I also sprinkled on some feta cheese because I enjoy the salty cheese with the sweet dressing and berries. I like the idea of adding bacon next time!

I made this salad last night for my bunko group (12 women) and everyone of them absolutely loved it and wanted the recipe.  I used baby spinach and it worked out great.  Can't wait to make it again.

People raved when I brought this to their house and requested the recipe be sent. The idea for the blender is good but I found that most of the seeds then get stuck to the side of the blender so I blend with all but the seeds and then add them in once blended.

This was delicious and everyone is asking for the recipe.  Perfect summer salad.  Light and healthy.  I did make changes based on the reviews.  I did the 1/4 cup of sugar which was plenty and used balsamic vinegar.  I added feta cheese which went quite well with it.  I was short on time and used the dehydrated onions from spice aisle and it still tasted delish.   I highly recommend this recipe.

Wonderful recipe that includes a dressing you could make yourself. It was very delicious and healthy. I didn't like salad that much, but I'm growing to like it more with the right dressing.

I made this for my sons graduation party.  It was so easy and quick to make.  I have 5 people ask me for the recipe before they left.  HUGE HIT and a nice change.

This recipe rocked!! I didn't have poppy seeds or sesame seeds so I just used 2 tbsp. of sunflower seeds. I also just used 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup. I made up some bacon and crumbled it and after draining the fat, added the dressing to the skillet. I topped with strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and almonds.
It was excellent, thanks for the recipe!

We love this salad. I followed the recipe exactly for the dressing in terms of quantity of sugar (1/2 c), but next time we have it we decided to cut back on the sugar and see how we like that.  My husband said he liked it but "you wouldn't want it any sweeter." I think, like so many other reviewers, that the quantity of sugar can be cut back.  I used balsamic vinegar as others suggested. I agree that the minced onion in the dressing adds a lot of flavor and you don't even realize it's there. I meant to use red onion but forgot; still delicious.  I toasted the sesame seeds and the almonds.  I did not blanch the almonds -- no need to, in my opinion. Love them toasted though and it's so easy to do.  Any fruit would be delicious. I followed others' suggestions and topped the salad with crumbled bleu cheese.  I don't even like it, but the tang of the cheese was a good counterbalance to the sweetness of the dressing.  We also added chicken as we had it as a main dish, not a side salad. Absolutely delicious.  One thing I love too is how absolutely beautiful it is -- as though you were in the finest restaurant. :)  Not too much preparation time and everything can be done ahead and assembled when you serve it.  I served the everything separately because it was only us two. If I was making for company I would assemble it but serve nuts and dressing on the side. Thanks for great recipe.

The dressing was a little too sweet- next time will cut down on the sugar a bit.

Overall, great recipe! Love the combination with goat cheese, yum!

I saw this recipe last night and just remembered a pack of strawberry was only $1 at Chinese market, so today I went there again and got strawberries, spinach, and other ingredients.
It was very easy to make,and tastes great! I will definitely make it many times during this season.

I took the chance and tried the recipe for an afternoon dinner. I added gorgonzola cheese and I can't even start to explain how good it was. Served the salad with slices of toasted loaf and beef turnovers. Perfect for a diner with the girls!!!

What can I say that someone hasn't said already, but I wanted to add my thumbs up on here and say that this salad was a hit at our Easter gathering this year.  Next time I make it however, I am going to try and use a little less sugar as for my own taste, it was a little sweet.  I substituted pine nuts for the almonds because I didn't have any in the house, but the pine nuts worked well, as I'm sure walnuts or pecans would have too.  But if you want to try something that's a little different and looks absolutely lovely on the plate, give this salad a try. Most folks will be back for seconds, I guarantee it.  And have the recipe handy to give out because you certainly will be asked for it! ;-)

This is my favorite summer salad. I usually leave out the paprika and is always tastes amazing! The salad is too soggy to eat for leftovers, but there are rarely any leftovers.

Wonderful and my guests couldn't stop talking about how good the dressing was.  I processed the onions with half the poppy and sesame seeds, Worcestershire, a TBSP or so of oil and vinegar (used balsamic). Added this to the rest of the ingredients.  And I only used half of the sugar.  So good. I also let the guests put the dressing on themselves.

This is great!  I knew I would like it, but I really loved it.  I took it to a potluck and just like everyone else here has experienced, everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  For myself, I think I will cut back on the sugar quite a bit next time, but it tastes amazing!

This was a really nice dressing! I made a small batch for 2 people and I used 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp oil, 1/2 tbsp vinegar, 1 tsp diced onion, and a dash of worcestershire and paprika. It tasted amazing with strawberries, almonds, and goat cheese on top of mixed greens.

My family loved this salad! This dressing was very sweet but it made the spinach nummy for my kids. My husband isn't too fond of spinach, but said it was pretty good with the sweet dressing. Will make again definitely. I toasted the almonds and it did make it a little too nutty tasting I thought.

Fabulous salad, I also cut the sugar by half. I added half the spinach and half the dressing and served it right away. The spinach stayed fresh through most of the meal. If I would have needed more salad I would have used the remaining spinach and dressing this way there wasn't any worry of having a wilted salad. I also toasted the almond slices and sesame seeds.

Awesome! I took this to a pool party. Added about 2tbs of lemon juice. Also, try to drain some of the dressing before serving. Would have preferred to use a white sugar alternative.

Deliciously awesome. I did not add onion as I did not have any. Next time I will half the sugar to 1/4 as my family do not eat a lot of sugar and it was a tad sweet for us. I will make this again for sure. thanks for the recipe!

This was such a great, delicious, light and fresh salad.  I substituted balsamic vinegar, for white vinegar; added feta cheese to the finished salad.  The feta cheese took this already great salad to a whole new level.  This will definitely be a staple.

It's very good.  Make sure you mix the dressing well before applying.  It's a great summer salad.  It is sweet so keep that in mind...

Wow, wow, and did I mention?  WOW.  This is a great little salad, easy to make and delicious and refreshing.  Even my 10 year old son ate it and asked for more.  No leftovers on this one!  One quick suggestion?  If you DO have leftovers, they'll keep much better if you do NOT dress the entire salad, but rather keep the dressing separate and let each person pour their own.

Delicious use of fresh strawberries. I roasted sunflowers seeds and sprinkled on top for some crunch.

I like this both with the listed amount of sugar and with half that sugar. It's a slightly different dressing if you halve the sugar but still good, especially if you add chicken (which I do). Thanks for sharing!

This salad was a big hit! I'll definitely make it again. I agree with some of the other comments about adding the dressing right before you serve it. I think it would get too soggy if the dressing was added too soon.

Made this salad for a potluck yesterday with no changes exept that I used rice wine vinegar and it was a hit.  Several people ask for the recipe.  Next time I will reduce the sugar a bit, but my strawberries were not the sweetest so the sweetness of the dressing was fine.

Wonderful salad.  I used balsamic instead of white vinegar.  I only had sesame seeds in an asian spice with ginger and it worked out beautifully.  I only used 1 tbn sugar and I added a 1/4 tsp. of cayenne for fun.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe, I and my husband loved it.

This is a fantastic salad!  I also used Balsamic vinegar and Splenda instead of sugar.  Honey glazed almonds go nicely with it, you can reduce the amount very easily, and I have used dehydrated onions in a pinch, which worked fine.

Trust all the hype, this salad is incredible! I was a little nervous to make this for Easter dinner w/o ever trying before but it was the hit of the dinner table. I did follow other reviewers suggestions and using balsamic vinegar and red onion,  I omitted poppyseeds(just didn't have any), and added blue cheese and some bacon bits. Still would have been great without I'm sure. But this combo got me raves! The dressing is to die for. This recipe is going in my box for life.

This was ok.  I was so excited to make this I went out and bought fresh strawberries and spinach.  Unfortunately I was a litle disappointed.  This salad isn't bad, I just don't see what the hype is.  I followed the recipe exactly too.  The dressing is tasty, but I don't think I'll be making this one again.

Really good.  Changes I made.. used splenda to cut down on sugar.  Added the splenda only after everything in the dressing was mixed together and added to taste.  Also used madarin oranges because strawberrys weren't in season.  Added a prepackaged salad topping mix with pumpkin seeds, nuts etc.  Really enjoyed!!

I forgot to ask those who used the poppy seeds ... did you think they added a lot to the salad?  I like poppy seeds but didn't want to spend $5.50 for a small jar, since the recipe only called for 1 tablespoon and I was pretty sure I wouldn't use the rest of the jar before the seeds went rancid.  If they really added something, though, I would try that next time.  :-)

I made this for church, and everyone loved it. I used balsamic vinegar as others suggested. I used both strawberries and mandarin oranges, which made it nice and colorful. I added feta cheese when it was time to serve it and this too, was great. The balsamic vinegar does give the dressing a funky color as compared to using white vinegar, but the taste is worth it, as there was not a drop left. This is a definite keeper.

This salad has good flavors, but it becomes soggy and wilted quickly after it is mixed with the dressing.  This salad needs to be dressed immediately before serving.

I was not much of a salad persone but I had to try this recipe and wow I loved it. I will for shure make this again. It is a good way to eat spanach. I added goat cheese and walnuts to the recipe and I strongly recommend it.

It's delicious. It could be lighter, I guess, but come on - its mostly raw spinach and berries and those more than make up for the oil and sugar.

Really simple and yummy. The dressing is sweet and a good fit with the strawberries WITHOUT using the entire amount.  I cut the measurement in half and it was perfect.

The taste of the dressing is PERFECTION.  Just be careful how much you use.  I tripled the Salad ingredients and only doubled the dressing ingredients but still had WAY too much dressing. The first time I made this I took it to our church picnic (that's how much I trust allrecipe's ratings!!).  When I retrieved my bowl to take it home, it was the only one completely empty!!

excellent! will cut the sugar in half next time though. I didn't have sesame seeds so omitted, but I think they woulld add to it. Update: I will never again make this with balsamic vinegar. I tried that and thought it way to overpowering. Use white vinegar and cut the sugar in half.

Made this using advice of other reviewers: cut the sugar in half and use balsalmic vinegar, also toasted the sesame and poppy seeds, then let the dressing sit overnight in the fridge. OMG what a wonderful flavor! Will definitely make this again.

FANTASTIC!  Even my picky husband and a guest who didn't care for spinach raved about it.  FYI, could use on a romaine salad.  However, the spinach did get soggy quickly...the only reason for 4 stars rather than 5.  May have sat too long before I served it.

Delicious salad!  I added some chopped green onions which really made the flavor pop.  I did not have poppy seeds on hand, so I skipped them - excellent without anyway!

I made this recipe for a very large luncheon, multiplying it for 16 servings, which produced two enormous bowls of salad (perfect for what I needed).  I made it as written, using fresh minced onion, not dried, and adding sliced hard boiled eggs (which turn a lovely light pink when the strawberries become wetted by the dressing).  Everything was perfect, and everyone LOVED the salad.  Next time I would cut the sugar in half, as the dressing is super sweet, and the sweet/tart mixture would stand out more with less.  Excellent recipe!  Will use again and again.

Other than reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup (personal preference), I didn't change the ingredients. I put the sugar, vinegar, oil, onion, paprika, and Worcestershire sauce in a food processor.

I love this salad.  I made it just as the recipe said and it is great i may try some of the suggestions made to vary it a little.  I had a BBQ and people could not get enough of it.  I would higly recommend this one!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my favorite salad.  I like it the way it is. I also like it with candied pecans and sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles. My kids even like it!  The dressing is good with green onions also.

I made this for a family reunion of 35 people!!  I debated if it was a good idea because of trying to mix the dressing with the salad and not get it too soggy, so I halved the recipe & just waited until the first bowl was gone & whipped another one right up.  They loved it so much that they requested it again for the next night!    I don't use all the dressing it calls for - I think it definitely would make it too soggy, so I just eyeball it (and keep the rest for leftovers)  Also, use glazed walnuts - they are delicious with this salad!!!

this is a great side for any heavy main dish. it is light and so full of flavor. personel preference is i toast the sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and sliced almonds. i also double up on the spinach and strawberries or cut the dressing in half if using the original recipe. too much dressing overwhelms the spinach. this will be a item for my kentucky derby party. others off this site are kentucky hot brown, kentucky derby pie know on here as run for the roses pie 3 and alcohol free mint juleps. you can add a jigger of bourbon if your guests want it in their glass.  i previewed and made small potions of these in advance and this is my menu on saturday may 2nd, 2009

This was an excellent salad. The dressing was sweet and tangy and very mild in flavor. I used rice wine vinegar and onion powder instead of fresh onion. I only added a little fresh ground black pepper on this at the table. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this salad for my family at Easter and it went over really well.  I cut the sugar back to about 1/3c and might try cutting it back a little more next time.  Not because it was too sweet, but because it tastes just as good with less as it would with more, and it's healthier that way!  I also used red onions.  Great recipe!

Oh my goodness! I am a salad fanatic and this was the BEST salad I have ever had! I used balsamic vinegar (my favorite) instead of the white vinegar and I just about died when I tried my first bite... AMAZING! The strawberries gave a wonderfully tart flavor to the sweetness of the dressing and the bitterness of the spinach. This is my ultimate favorite salad now! Thanks for introducing it to me! :)

I did as others suggested and used balsamic vinegar instead.  What made this salad outstanding was the ingredients I added which was blue cheese (A MUST), bacon bits and red onion.  The dressing was outstanding, but I used a little bit less sugar than called for.  Try adding the blue cheese, bacon bits and red onion to this salad. Everyone loved it!  I did not add the almonds due to nut allergy that I have, but it was still delicious.

I really loved this, and the dressing was terrific.  I may use a little less sugar next time though.

This recipe is phenomenal!  I make slight adjustments to mine by adding more or less of certain ingredients to suit my taste.  I also find using different types of nuts such as toasted walnuts also taste wonderful!

I added garlic to the dressing. Maybe that was the downfall to the dressing. There was too much od a "bite" in the dressing almost like a spicyness. I love spicy but not in my spinach salad with strawberries. My husband also noticed the "bite" maybe it was the red onion? Not sure I would make this again.

A great recipe - dressing is easy to make and great with the spinach, strawberries and almonds. I used only about 1/3 cup of sugar and it was great...may even try a little less next time. It was a hit at the dinner party!

The dressing was very thick, I added a little water to thin it out. I used balsamic vinegar, as I did not have regular vinegar on hand. I also cut back on the sugar a little bit. I had guests over for dinner and everyone asked for this recipe!

This is the ultimate salad! I've been making this year round for over a year and exactly as shown. However, I find the recipe makes WAY too much dressing so I usually half the dressing and double the spinach. Then it's perfect for us!

Great recipe - my husband asks for it again and again. must have made it at least 6 times in 2 weeks!  One note - doesn't need as much sugar. I cut it to 1/3 cup instead of 1/2. Add dressing lightly and let others add if they need more. I only use about 1/2 of what it makes. Have also added goat cheese after tossing.

I followed some of the suggestions from the other reviews and cut the sugar by half. Also, I toasted the poppy and sesame seeds which added a nice flavor to the dressing.

I thought this salad was absolutely incredible! Something different to say the least and I really enjoyed the sweet and tart flavors of the dressing, altho I did cut back a little on the sugar. I too added feta and used apple cider vinegar instead of the white. Fantastic recipe and thank you so much!!

Took this to a tail-gating party--was delicious.  Left out poppy seeds and sesame seeds and didn't miss them. Used feta cheese-was essential.  A few didn't try the salad, I guess because of the unlikely strawberry-spinach combination, so hubby and I had a little to finish after the game.  Wouldn't have been too good to keep till next day, anyway.  Will be one of our favorites now.

To die for!  WOW!  I actually did not use enough spinach, and more strawberries...  it was amazing.  I brought to a dinner of 15 and everyone LOVED it!  It was the only thing that was GONE and everyone was wanting more!

Wow, I love the melding of tastes in this salad.  My husband and children were not prepared for the sweet taste of it, but after the first taste shock they determined they liked it as well.  I didn't have any sesame seeds, so simply left them out.  We didn't miss them.  I will definitely make this salad again, perhaps for company next time.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful, even my 5 and 6 year old liked it.  It does make a little extra dressing, but it's still wonderful!

Delicious.  Added thinly sliced sweet onion and crumbled feta for color and a little more substance. Delicious with the almonds.

This salad was a big hit at my house.  Very unique. I didn't have poppy seeds so I left those out, subbed Balsamic Vinegar for white and only used about 1/3 cup of sugar--1/2 cup jut seemed like too much.  Blended everything together in the blender for about 15 seconds then chilled for about 30 minutes instead of an hour--no matter, the dressing was still amazing.  Tangy, with a bit of sweetness.  A very refreshing salad.  Oh, I also added crumbled bleu cheese--the perfect touch!  This one's a keeper.

Perfect. I had people licking their plates. I even took the little I had left over and added more lettuce and put in food processor and had a sweet salsa the next day


Made again this Christmas. People as always asked for it!

This salad is the perfect mix of textures and was amazingly sweet, tangy, and savory.  Changes I made to the original recipe included using balsamic vinegar instead of white, using red onion instead of white, and adding feta cheese crumbles.  Also, it only needed about 2/3 the amount of dressing that the recipe makes.  I will definitely be making this again for my husband!

I wish I could rate this higher..I love this salad! I read through many of the reviews, and here is how I proceeded. I used fresh strawberries, fresh blueberries, mandarin oranges and sliced almonds...fantasic!
For the dressing I used the balsamic vinegar and olive oil, paparika,worchestire sauce, 2 Tbs. of Splenda also used less onion (about 2 Tbs.), as suggested...
I will be making this again. Actually, I will having this for lunch toaday and may even add some roasted chicken. Thank you...love this recipe.

This was delicious and perfect for a summer picnic.  The only thing I changed was cutting the sugar in half.
Beware of serving size--this would actually feed at least 8 people.

This was very good.  I only gave 4 stars because I thought the dressing had a strong olive oil taste.  I will make again though and just reduce the amount of olive oil, or increase the amounts of the other ingredients in the dressing.

Excellent salad!  Huge hit with the family, including my sister who is picky. I was pleasantly surprised by the sweet dressing combined with the tart-sweet of the strawberries. The only change I made was to use balsamic vinegar because it complements strawberries so well.   Will definitely make it again but I think I may sprinkle some feta on top.

Excellent recipe.  Most important thing is to follow the advice posted here and add sugar to the dressing to your personal preference.  I ended up using only a couple Tablespoons.  Also (because they were in my fridge), I added some chopped up fresh mint to the salad, and some avocado.  Wow.  Great salad.

We all liked this.  I tried cutting the amount of sugar at first based on the comments, but it just wasn't right until I put the full amount of sugar in.  The almonds bring it all together and should definitely be toasted.

Wow! I saw this and thought, gross you dont put fruit in a salad, but because of all the rave reviews and I had a ton of strawberries I decided to make this for teacher appreciation lunch.  I tried some and it was awesome.  Did halve the sugar and added a couple of strawberries to the dressing(pureed), also used balsamic vinegar.  Wonderful!!

This is the best salad I have had ever.  I took the advice of a few of the reviews, I added bacon bits,change to balsomic vinegar, took the sugar to 1/4 cup and for the nuts I used praline pecans, oh my gosh how gooooooood!

I have madet this three times- I used the balsamic vinegar and cut the sugar down by more than 1/2.  I recently served it with spinach, almonds, goat cheese and cut, cooked chicken.  Very good!

This was the first spinach salad I have ever made and got rave reviews!  I think there was a little to much dressing for me so I may add a little at a time next time but I will definitely be making this again.

This salad was really good, except the dressing was a little sweet for our tastes. Next time I'll reduce the sugar a little. I also used walnuts instead of almonds (nobody in my family likes them). Thank you for the recipe!

Everybody raved about this salad when I brought it to a famiy party. I substituted the vinegar with Balsalmic vinegar which was a nice touch. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it failed to wow me, but it seemed to wow everybody else.

This salad is yummy! I omitted the worchestershire and only used 1/4 c. of sugar, but it was wonderful. The family wouldnt touch it, so more for me! One bit of advice I can offer is unless you are going to eat the salad right away, dont add the dressing. It wilts the salad.

This was better than I thought it would be, I wasn't expecting it to be a sweet salad even with the sugar.  I think the worchestershire sauce threw me off a bit.  Served it with Turkey Burgers.

The salad is fantastic!  The tastes are wonderfully refreshing, and it's nice to make with a meal for guests.  (I have to admit that I added blue cheese crumples, too!)

Thanks for the great recipe!

This salad was delicious!  The first time I added feta cheese, used 2 tablespoons of sugar and balsamic vinaigrette; it was great.  I also added blueberries, again great.  I didn't add the dressing to the salad right away and the dressing looked wierd the next day, so I added store-bought raspberry vinaigrette instead.  That was also tasty.  This salad is very versitile.  Many substitues will taste wonderful.  When I mixed all the salad ingredients together, the strawberries and almonds fell to the bottom.  Next time I will build the salad in my bowl.

This salad was WONDERFUL!!!! I followed directions exactly and my entire family LOVED it---including my 4 year old and my hubby who doesn't really like spinach. It is different yet familiar enough to enjoy. You dont need to put alot of dressing on it to get the flavor and feel you want in my opinion. just make sure every piece has a little on it.

Could this salad get any better?  Even the non-salad lovers loved this.  We paired it with the "Alice Chicken" recipe found here, and it was a huge hit.  I've had the dressing a few ways (with/without onion, etc...) and this is my favorite, although I used olive oil and red wine vineger because that's what I had on hand.  You've got to try this!

Amazing.. just made this for the family and they constantly raved about it the whole meal and told me I have to make it a lot from now on. I used balsamic vinegar because it compliments the strawberries exquisitely and didn't add sesame seeds or poppyseeds (didn't have any on hand) but I can't wait to try it with them. Definitely a keeper!!

I thought the olive oil was overpowering.  So, I made it again with veggie oil.  Not as healthy, but it tasted better.

Delicious...  I would like to lesson the olive oil.  But, I'm not sure what to substitute it with.  Add a little feta cheese and this salad would be perfect.

I love this recipe.  Everytime I make it someone wants the recipe and it is always requested at family events.  The only thing I do differently is omit the sesame seeds and I add a can of drained mandarin orange slices.

Really good.  Bought a bag of spinach and made the dressing up & cut up the onion and strawberries the night before and then assembled day needed.  Definitely not a salad you can make ahead or keep because the spinach wilts.  Would suggest only putting on dressing on what you think you'll need.
I think this would also be good with blueberries, feta & maybe some walnuts.  There are many variations you could do with just the spinach and the dressing.

This is an awesome summer salad to bring to a party!  Everyone LOVED it and I have been handing out the recipe ever since.  I would not change a thing.  I would however, make the dressing the day before so that it can marinate the flavors together!

I liked this salad but I found the dressing way too sweet.Next time I would cut back the sugar to half and probably add some feta cheese or bleu cheese.

Like the few before me I made this for Mother's Day.  It was a HUGE hit.  I made it exactly as stated and it was perfect.  I don't understand the people who say they made this recipe, but change so many things that it's definitely not the same recipe.  It is awesome just the way it is!

The idea is nice, but we found the dressing to be a bit overwhelming for the salad...and way too much of it.  If I make it again, I'll use about 1/2 the dressing.

This is an excellent salad, a nice change from your regular old salad.  I cut the sugar in half and toasted the sesame seeds and almonds before adding them.  Left out the poppy seeds since I didn't have any.  Turned out great.

This is a really good salad dressig for strawberry salads though a little too sweet for my taste.  I used 1/3 c organic sugar and it was still too sweet.  Next time I'll try 1/4 c. sugar.  I used romaine lettuce not spinach.

All of my dinner guests raved about this salad!  I even had enough ingredients leftover for the next day and made it again, but I don't recommend making enough for leftovers (the spinach and strawberries would be too soggy).  You don't have to use a blender to mix the dressing, a mixer can be used too.

This was excellent and very easy to prepare.  This would be a great salad to make for company.  The dressing was pretty sweet, just so you know.  A very nice combination of flavors.  I didn't have white vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar and this was fine.

I did'nt have any of the seeds on hand, but I made it anyway and it tasted wonderful and was beautiful on the table as well. It really made our dinner party seem more sophisticated and planned out, yet it's very simple and quick to prepare. The tangy dressing and the sweetness of the strawberries complement each other well.

This is an absolutely awesome salad!  Hubby wanted a light meal last night and I already had the salad ready to put together.  I added a cup of cubed ham and then garnished with shredded swiss cheese and two sliced hardboiled eggs. We both loved it.

Excellent, 4 stars only because there is way too much sugar. It never fully dissolved and became pasty at the bottom of the dressing dish. Others suggested using a blender which may help but 1/2 the sugar should do fine.

The only reason why I'm not giving this recipe 5 stars is because it's very sweet and if your trying to watch your sugar intake, watch out. Maybe cutting the sugar to 1/4 cup would be much better. Otherwise it was wonderful.

Delicious and different. Didn't hold up too well in the fridge after tossing though, so don't mix the dressing in too far in advance. I followed other reviewer's advice and used cider vinegar and only 1/4 C sugar. Might also be good with some crumbled bacon, blue cheese, or nuts.

This salad was OK.  I loved the strawberries and spinach, but the dressing left something to be desired.  I thought it had too much oil in it.  I think next time, I'll reduce the oil by alomst half and add a little more of the other ingredients to give it some more flavor.

Wow!  What a yummy salad!  I toasted the almonds in a dry skillet for a few minutes and used balsamic vineagar instead of white vinegar.  I couldn't stop eating this salad!  Love it and will definitely make it again!

I brought this to a family gathering and it got mixed reviews. People either loved it or they hated it. I do plan on making it again, but with only half the vinegar. I think it would go over a lot better.

The salad itself was great but the dressing leaves something to be desired.  I think the white vinegar was the wrong choice.  Maybe red wine or apple cider would be better and no worcestershire (at least for my taste).

This is terrific!  I just made it and cannot stop snacking on it.  I did mandarin oranges the sacond time of snacking and it was even more wonderful.  I don't like a whole lot of onion taste so I only used about 1/2 teaspoon of red onion.  It was Plenty.  I do think you cannot go wrong with putting your own variation on fruit in it.  Thanks!  Enjoy!

This salad was great! I could eat it everyday. I didn't have any sesame seeds or paprika so I left them out but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. This is going to become my family's new holiday salad. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a  hit - especially with my husband.  I made it for a church potluck and it was scarfed up but it tasted too oily for me with the regular vegetable oil.  I made it again for (per my hubby's request) and used a light olive oil instead and it was MUCH better - even one of my five year olds liked it (she was the only kid who would try it!)

Very, very good!  I found this recipe very easy to make and very tasty.  I only gave it 4 stars because, while it was excellent, it didn't make me want to go back and steal seconds, thirds or a middle of the night snack.

I served this to 11 people and everyone lOVED it! This is definitly a keeper and I will be serving it often. 
I used about 1/3 less sugar, and slightly less poppy seeds, and I used a very light Olive Oil, and a combination of Balsamic Vinegar and Wine Vinegar. It is a light and delicate dressing but full of flavor and one to be enjoyed. EXCELLENT!!!

I made this for pool party and it was great! I was very hesitant....I'm thinking strawberries with spinach...no way. I did cut back on the amount of sugar as others did and it was a hit. Will be making again. Thanks for the post.

Excellent salad.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.   I only used half the dressing and made the same salad the next night with the other half of the dressing.  I'll make this again.

I can't think of enough good things to say about this recipe.  I made it today for Easter dinner.  The only alteration I made to it was to use Balsamic vinegar (at the suggestion of previous reviewer) instead of white wine.  This was very good.  I will make it as often as I can get good strawberries.

WOW - what a fabulous salad this was!! when i make this again i will use a bit less sugar since the dressing was very sweet, it was like salad candy. also, i'll use more spinach because there was a lot of excess dressing. a definite keeper.

I was a little leary about the combination at first but great recipe.  I skipped the almonds and didn't have worcestershire sauce.  Still came out delicious. I will definately make this recipe again.

Very good.  I used red wine vinegar mixed with distilled white vinegar because those are what I had on hand.  I added strips of BBQ chicken breast for an excellent dinner salad.

Very delicious and easy to make.  It makes a very generous four servings, if you are serving it as a side salad.  I thought there was too much dressing, so I just didn't use it all.

Beautiful and delicious.  This salad was a wonderfully colorful addition to our 4th of July cookout.  My kids who normally really like fresh spinach, were a little turned off because of the dressing but they can just eat it plain, I wouldn't change the flavor at all!  Thank you for sharing!

I can't say enough about this amazing salad.  I've only ever made it with Splenda, instead of sugar.  Everyone who tastes it, loves it.

Great summer salad.  I had to proceed without a couple things - paprika, white vinegar OR poppy seeds (couldn't find them anywhere - next time I'll shop more than two days in advance).  I had serious reservations about the dressing but after taking it out of the fridge it was pretty good - in fact it was delicious!  I tossed the whole thing together (I used baby spinach and toasted the sesame seeds and almonds as others had suggested) and it was a hit!  Thank you Andrea!

This dressing is awesome!!  I used packets of sweetener instead of the sugar and it was very tasty!!  I was making it for a family gathering, so thought I'd need to double the recipe...not so...but hey, I had lots of left overs (didn't pour the dressing on til I was going to eat it).  LOVED IT!!

I omitted the sesame seeds and changed the white vinegar to cider vinegar.  I also used onion powder because I didn't have minced onion.  It was still delicious!

This was wonderful. I made it with sliced honey roasted almonds and blue cheese, and left out the strawberries (it just sounded too odd to me, perhaps I will try it one day) but the dressing was outstanding. Thanks for the recipe!

I was not crazy about the dressing for this dish.  The strawberries made the salad naturally sweet, so the dressing was overwhelmingly sweet for me.  If I make the dressing again (which I probably won't) I will use 1/2 the sugar.

Deelicious.  I cheated and used bottled dressing (it was easier and cheaper...), but wowee was it tasty.  I also used walnuts instead of almonds, and they were a perfect compliment!!

This has to be the perfect odd couple.  I would have never put this combo together but they totally work!!! I think this dressing would work well with any number of fresh veggies, broccoli, red onions, cauliflower, cabbage...  I can't wait to try other versions.   What a great way to trick those picky eaters into eating their veggies ;-)  Thanks Andrea.

Very tasty.  I did not add the worchestershire however I did not miss it.  I took this to my sons Blue and Gold Boy Scout Banquet and everyone who tried the strange strawberry spinach salad loved it.  One lady even went back for another serving instead of dessert.  I will keep making this salad over and over.

I love the idea of this salad... but it didn't deliver quite the punch I had hoped it would.  It was good, not great, a touch bland.  I don't know if it needs more vinegar or what.  I did add feta as suggested by many people, and used red wine vinegar, as suggested by many as well.  I would recommend not tossing the salad with the dressing unless you intend to NOT have leftovers.  I will continue playing with this recipe to try to tweak it for more flavor!

Excellent combination of flavors.  I served it at Easter and my neice and nephew who have never ate spinach even tried it and liked it.  The dressing is very unusual and I placed it in a glass container which showed the levels of ingredients before mixing.  This intriqued the kids as well. Thanks!

Yummy! Everyone loved this salad. Mine was really wet and I followed the recipe exactly. You can't eat this the next day because it's just a bowl of goo the next day, so eat it all up as soon as you make it!

Absolutely lovely salad!  I tried it last night for dinner for my daughter and myself and it was a big hit.  I accompanied it with a shrimp ring and seafood sauce.  The tang of the seafood sauce went well with the salad.  A definite summer treat and so quick and easy to make in little time. Thank you for sharing it!!!

This recipe was amazing. I made it for a potluck and it turned out beautifully. Instead of refridgerating the sauce for an hour, I did so for only 25 minutes (because I was short on time!), but it still tasted great and I got tons of compliments. This is prefect for anyone.

This has become an all-time favorite in my family!  Great for pot-lucks.  I tend to use less dressing.

An absolutely excellent salad! I took a chance on it and was not at all disappointed. 

One thing I find is that the dressing yields a little too much. It's not necessary to use all the dressing.

Andrea is right.  I made this for dinner last night and the male guest asked if I would give the recipe to his wife.  Before they left, the wife reminded me. This was a Great light salad which went along with my pork roast.  I'ts definitely a keeper.

This was a good salad.  The color is great, and the almonds add a nice crunch.  I would have given it five stars if it didn't have so much sugar.  It tastes great; I just feel a little guilty calling it a salad, and not a dessert!  Also, this made a HUGE salad, I think a lot more than four servings.

This was very unusual but VERY tasty.  I found a new "regular" for my recipes.  I think I needed more strawberries. I also didn't have almonds on hand so I used pine nuts.  I made it for my fiance and I and we didn't eat it all. Leftovers were not appealing so be sure to make enough for that day or don't put dressing on all of it. Good dish to pass.

Such a simple salad to make, but the taste is outstanding!  I made the recipe exactly as written, with the exception of adding crumbled blue cheese to the ingredients.  Men and women alike both loved the combinations of ingredients, and the sweetness of the dressing.  I will be making this again and again.

Very good!  Omitted the poppy seeds and decreased the oil to 1/3 cup.  Substituted 1/4 cup Splenda for the 1/2 cup sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Also only used about 2/3 of the dressing.  Instead of blanched almonds, used Sunkist roasted sliced salad almonds.

WONDERFUL!!! I make this all the time as my "trademark" salad.  I use 1/2 balsamic and 1/2 distilled vinegar for that extra zing.  I also leave out the sesame seeds.  Thanks for sharing!

Followed directions exactly - was EXCELLENT!  I also used the dressing for spinach salad containing bacon, red onion and gorganzola cheese - was fantastic on that, too!  The dressing goes far - use small amounts to begin with...add as you go.  Enjoy!

Some of these suggestions may have been made before (I didn't read over 200 reviews!) but here are a few suggestions: Raspberry wine vinegar is great, mandarin orange pieces are a great substitution for strawberries especially in the winter. Always toast the almonds and green onions instead of regular cooking onions are great.

This is really good.  Everytime I serve it someone asks for the recipe.  I usually add cashews or sunflower seeds and a few drops of sesame oil.

You know, I wasn't as blown away by this as everyone else.  I just didn't think the dressing had a lot of flavor and followed the recipe exactly as written.  I have some left over and I will try it again.  Maybe it will taste better once it has set over night.  If it does I will rate it again.

This salad was the hit of a dinner party.  Everyone loved it.  I took the advice of other reviews and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I also added bacon and feta cheese for even more yummy flavors.  Super salad!

I was a bit nervous putting all these ingredients together but it turned out really well. Unlike other people I did not think that the dressing was too sweet. I cut the recipe in half for the dressing and made one batch with splenda and one batch with sugar. I did not have any of the seeds so I made it without. I also toasted the almonds and those were wonderful. My inlaws thought it was really good. My husband even ate some and said it was good and he NEVER touches salad.

This salad is wonderful.  I Served it for Easter and the whole family loved it!  I was suprised at how little you noticed all the oil.  It's a really nice light salad.  The dressing is perfect for both the spinach and the strawberries!

This salad made my Easter dinner absolutely perfect! I chose to make it with apple cider vinegar and I'm so glad I did.  There were NO leftovers for the next day so I used the excess dressing on a new bowl of salad that I took to work and shared with my co-workers who all wanted the recipe.

this is sooo good and looks like you spent a long time making it, I can't wait for company to impress them, the sauce is the best part. I NEVER would have put strawberriew and spinach together.
This is perfect for the summer BBQ.

I just made this salad and it was spectacular!  The dressing was to die for.  The salad was the first dish to go.  All my guest had to leave with the recipe.  The salad dressing could be cut in half.  I had enough dressing left over to make another big serving. I also substited balsamic vinegar and it was delicious.

So GOOD!  It is such a tasty salad that even those I had over for dinner who are not fans of spinach didn't  even notice.  You can also substitute romaine if necessary.  I first tried this recipe  two years ago and have made sure to include it on the holidays...always requested on Easter and Thanksgigiving.  Lovely!

Great recipe.  I often use apple cider vinegar.  During the fall/winter when strawberries are scarce I use apples instead.  Still yummy. Also makes a great salad for the winter holidays with all the red and green......

I love this salad. I omit the onions and often substitute mandarin oranges for the strawberries. For sure, pour the dressing on right before serving.

This is a family and potluck favorite. Everyone is in awe over the wonderful flavors of this unlikely salad. I add jicama matchsticks and cilantro to kick up the flavor and texture! A definate Keeper! Thanks!

I had this at a picnic years ago and loved it!  Made it 3 times so far this summer and everyone has asked me for the recipe!  Very easy - but I prefer without the poppy seeds and substitute vegetable oil for a lighter taste.

Absolutely a wonderful salad!  If I could rate this higher than 5 stars, I would!  I did slice the strawberries the day before and wrapped in paper towel, then sealed in airtight freezer bag.  Hats off to Andrea!

This is a MUST-HAVE recipe -- you'll make it again and again.  It's too sweet for me as-is so I cut the sugar in half and use a mild Japanese rice vinegar.  Add room-temp dressing just before serving and DON'T add it all -- there's always way too much, unless you like a little salad with your dressing :-).  Also add plenty of blanched almonds -- I never measure them but I'm sure it's more than 1/4 C.

For those who like it, my family found this recipe to be equally good if not better with baby arugula than spinach. It's a nice contrast between peppery and sweet. A new spring staple here!

This was so delicious! My husband even liked it, but he gives it a 4 for being too sweet.  Maybe 1/2 T. sugar next time because the strawberries are sweet enough as well.  My 4 and 2 year old even ate it.  Thanks for helping us eat our greens:)

This is an excellent salad.  I made this for my family and then loved it.  My sister asks for it all the time, but strawberries aren't always in season.  It has a controlled sweet flavor and the dressing goes great with hard bread.

I LOVED IT!!!!  This tastes like something you would get at a tea room or trendy cafe.  I will be taking it to my inlaw's for Easter..it is the perfect spring salad.  The only minor thing I will change is to decrease the sugar a bit.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This salad was really good but just a little too sweet for my liking.  I would say it feeds closer to 8 people so cut the recipe in 1/2 for a smaller family since it doesn't hold up well.  I didn't have room to chill it in my refrigerator before serving so it was not as cold as it should have been.  Probably would have helped a lot.  A definite keeper, however.

Great recipe--especially the dressing.  I lightly toasted the almond slices and added the dressing at the last minute to keep the spinach leaves from starting to wilt.

Wow!  Like other reviewers, I could not believe that this combination would result in anything worth eating.  Boy was I wrong.  I have made this many times and my husband always wants to take the leftovers to work the next day.  Harumph!  I want to keep those leftovers for myself.  :)

Took this to my in-laws' a while back.   You know you have a winner when they finish eating the salad, look at the bowl, put down the fork and grab a spoon to get the last drops of dressing.  Five stars is NOT ENOUGH for this one.

This is just awesome!!.  I made this tonight and could have eaten just this, without anything else.  It is perfect for the season, with fresh strawberries and all.  It makes one want to freeze fresh strawberries, so we can have it in Feburary, or anytime of the seasons.  Thank you Andrea.

This was a lovely, cool and very pretty salad for a recent potluck we had.  It takes a while to tear spinach leaves, or else it would be a very quick recipe.  Kids also don't like spinach salads a lot, but the adults sure did!  I'd make it again, although it is a bit pricey!

Wow this recipe blew me away!  I usually don't like 'sweet/fruity' salads and prefer more of the usual staple/caesar but this is really tasty and different!  The flavors are what make it- they blend so well together and really complement the strawberries.  I used regular endive and romaine lettuce and i personally like it better than with the spinich!

I took this to a dinner party and it was very well recieved.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I do agree with other reviewers that you could use half the oil and it would still be delicious.

Andrea, this was a delicious salad.  I am so glad that I discovered it on this sight.  We made it at work, with each of us bringing in a different ingredient.  I had to make copies of the recipe because everyone loved it so much.

Good salad, but the dressing was heavy on the oil and sugar. I would add more vinegar and worcestershire sauce next time.

This was good, but don't plan on any leftovers. . . they get really soggy. . . it was even pretty soggy on day 1.  Overall, it was a good, creative salad & the strawberries make a great color addition!

A TRIUMPH!!! I have been trying to get my boyfriend to eat spinach since I met him, and this recipe did it. I took everyone's advise and halved the dressing, but it was plenty. I served it, and after he ate it I told him what was in it. He simply looked at the plate and said "Where was the spinach? That tasted too good to be spinach!" I'm sending this recipe to his mother! Thank you!!

I used the fresh spinach, strawberries, and toasted my slivered almonds. To make it fast I used Briannas strawberry vinaigrette and added orange juice to it---absolutely delicious.

Would make again, loved the dressing, very easy to make, used baby spinach as it was the only spinach available at the store, I made several slices through a handful of spinach to reduce the size of the leaves - because with the leaves and stems the size makes it difficult to get on a fork and in your mouth without getting the dressing on your lips, it also makes it easier to fold in the dressing.  I made more dressing than needed (only needed salad for 2), the remainder went into disposable condiment containers for salads for lunches.

Have been asked to bring this to three get togethers after first bringing it to a pot luck.  Like others, I just cut back on the sugar a bit and used balsamic vinegar.  Just amazing flavour.

I leave out the poppies and sesame seeds bc they get stuck in my teeth, less ingredients to buy and they don’t change the overall taste of the dressing. A very small amount of sesame oil would work too IMHO. I also used about 1/3 c sugar to see if it would make a big difference and it was still great. We didn’t have fresh strawberries so we used fresh tomatoes. My 10 yr old son gets sick of salads and he made 2 tonight! We added some chicken as well.

This salad was amazing. I could eat it every day! The dressing was perfect. I thought it sounded a little strange when I read the ingredients, but was very happily surprised. My husband who is not that big of a salad fan, also loved it. I can hardly wait to make it again!

Pretty  heavy on the sugar but delicious.  I cut the recipe in half because it was just for my husband and I.  I made the dressing in my Magic Bullet.  I used 1 Tbsp of sugar and popped in a few strawberries and it was plenty sweet.

This was delicious made as the recipe called for, however there was too much of it for the amount of greens I had, which was a store bought bag. Next time I would halve this recipe or just add half and leave the rest on the side if people want to add more, they can. Lots of compliments!

Made it exactly as described except used a Strawberry Balsamic vinegar that I had on hand.  Super salad - I added some diced chicken and it was great that way as well.  The dressing on this is amazing - chilling it per the recipe is key to mixing the flavors.  Husband loved it too and he's not a sweet salad guy.  Thanks for submitting!

This was very good.  I made it with baby spinach, and it got soggy quite quickly, even though I used a relatively scant amount of dressing.  Added bacon and feta, which definitely gave it more complexity.
I only used 1/4 cup of sugar in the dressing, and it was still too sweet for my taste, but it was very well received at the potluck I took it to.

This recipe is quick and easy to make and a hit with everyone. I added chicken that I cooked in 2 T. Balsamic vinegar and 2T. Olive oil, grated fresh ginger and a slight sprinkle of garlic salt. Definitely a recipe I’ve used often for luncheons.

This is my FAVORITE summertime recipe! To make it with a little more oompfh, I make homemade bacon bits, then I toast the almonds in a bit of the rendered bacon fat. Add a bit of feta and you have a nice filling meal....not necessarily super healthy anymore...but at least you are getting strawberries and spinach...

Tasty salad.  I used flaxseed instead of poppyseeds because this what I had in hand and it was great.  Can’t wait to make again with some other suggestions I’ve read.  Oh and don’t put dressing into salad it makes it too soft and witty.

Love it. Made it several time, just as written. We  have our own strawberries so it's a great way to use them up. Had it with grilled salmon. The dressing was great on the salmon too.

My family loved this salad.  The only change I made was to add blueberries to it.  I usually make a poppyseed dressing for my salads but I thought this one looked interesting with the Worcestershire sauce addition.  It was a hit!  Everyone there asked for the recipe.  Thank you for submitting it

Rave reviews!  I had a bounty of both spinach and strawberries. I followed other reviewers suggestions to substitute balsamic vinegar, and halved the sugar. And toasted the sesame seeds. Doubled the dressing recipe and was happy to have extra. Do not dress the salad beforehand.

Great summer salad -- actually anytime if the strawberries are good and sweet.  I make a large batch of the dressing and keep it in a labelled & dated jar in the fridge.  This way it makes for an easy salad the 2nd, 3rd or 4th time you want more.

I have made this recipe many times.  Have started adding feta cheese and diced chicken to make as a nice summer meal with deviled eggs on the side. 
My time saving way of making this is by warming vinegar in a jar to help dissolve the sugar.  Grate the onion with a cheese grater for less cleanup, mix dressing by shaking in the jar, and then can easily store leftover w/o dirtying another dish.
Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I used balsamic vinegar instead of white, and halved the sugar. I did not premix the dressing and spinach, but in the future I will to evenly coat. It was okay, but not amazing. Probably will not make again.

I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and it was still very sweet.  It was also dripping with dressing, so I will likely stick to the 1/4 cup and use less of the dressing on the salad next time.

I used balsamic vinegar and used red onions. I forgot about the poppy seeds as well. I don't usually care for these kind of salads, but this one was great! I made it for an early Easter dinner, and everyone raved about it! Will definitely make again.

This salad was a hit at the dinner party we went too. Me
Are the dressing as described, next time may cut the sesame seeds in half but otherwise was great. I also added blueberries and feta cheese. Will definitely make this again many more times.

Took this to a family reunion. My vegetarian cousins loved it. I had to make it in a motel room, and it was easy to prepare. I love the zing the balsamic vinegar gives (I buy flavored balsamic for an extra layer of flavor.) The almonds add a nice crunch. The strawberries add a sweetness. And the spinach gives a healthy chew. Such a well-rounded salad.

I didn't add worchestershire.  Too harsh for such a delicate salad.

The classic addition is feta or shaved parm.

Overall, my recipe is better than this.

This is an awesome salad.  I've made it before for a potluck with no changes to the recipe, with rave reviews. This time I made it just for my husband and I, and I substituted Splenda for the sugar as one of us is diabetic; it was still incredible.  I will definitely make this salad again.

I made this salad for my son's birthday party and it was a big hit!! I got so many compliments on this salad.
I used soy sauce instead of Worcestershire Sauce just because I had it.  I used half of sugar on this recipe. I used balsamic vinegar.  I added avocados. used candid pecan instead of almonds. Everyone at the party loved it!!

Great salad! The sesame and poppy seeds in the dressing are a really nice touch. It's great as a side as is but for a main I'd throw in some goat cheese or chicken or both.

Depending on how compulsive you want to be with breaking up the spinach into "bite sized pieces" or if you want to snap off ALL of the stems, this can be a pretty quick and VERY flavorful salad.  The fresher the strawberries the better.  Although I don't usually cook with poppy seeds (has nothing to do with drug testing) the combination of those with sesame seeds was great.  You can add some home made croutons or some shredded Parmesan cheese, finely sliced roasted chicken or julienne cut sun dried tomatoes but not something as heavy as andouille sausage or red meat.  This dish leans towards the mild, subtle side.  Enjoy!

Made it with half the sugar after reading the reviews.  I have made it two different times once with champage and balsamic, when I did the balsamic I only used about 1 tablespoon of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of honey, both times it was great.  You can also add blueberries and candied walnuts.  Awesome

Absolutely delicious and healthy  on a warm summer night. Since I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce on hand, it tasted fine without it. I would absolutely make it again and again with variables or not.

I will be making this regularly for lunch and adding some cooked chicken. It is very tasty and delivers the iron that I need with the Vitamin C that makes it highly bioavailable. Great Recipe.

Great summer salad. Used balsamic vinegar, cut the sugar to 1/4, added bacon. Will try it with Feta next time.

OMGOODNESS!  This salad is so YUMMY.  It’s a little too sweet for my husband, but it’s perfect for me.  Next time I’ll reduce the sugar a little bit to his taste.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This recipe MUST be tweaked! I was short on time and didn’t read other reviews before making it, big mistake on my part (just based it off of the rating), using 1/2 cup of sugar is WAY too much! It was not edible as the recipe is. I will use much less sugar, will probably use an 1/8-1/4 cup. Will also add sunflower seeds and some sort of goat/feta/blue cheese next time as well. The texture of the dressing was good though, I used my food processor to finely dice up the onion (I used a sweet onion so that could have contributed to the over sweetness that punched me in the face).

Really good with blueberries and strawberries to give it patriotic flair.  Along with the red onions and feta, you can add a little grilled chicken for a complete lunch.

I’ve been looking for a recipe to replicate one of my favorite restaurant salads - this is it!!  I didn’t have the poppy or sesame seeds on hand but the dressing was fantastic anyway!  The paprika and Worcestershire really enhance the dressing. We’ll be enjoying this salad all summer.

I would give this salad 5 stars if the dressing didn’t have so much sugar that it is like syrup! I doubled the white vinegar, that helped and everyone really liked it.  I’ll play with portions of sugar and vinegar when I make it again.

This salad was a delicious delight we made to accompany our Easter dinner! To make the dressing even more scrumptious (it’s already great) I added about 1/4 C of strawberry jam to enhance the strawberry flavor just a little. I didn’t want any olive oil flavor so I substituted canola oil. I blended it thoroughly with a blender so it would become emulsified.  We loved it!

This spinach salad was great, however,  next time I will change the dressing—-much too sweet with all the sugar! I would try honey just enough to add some sweetness.

Delicious!  The ONLY CHANGE I made was cutting down the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I took the suggestion from other reviewers and that is why I cut down the sugar.  The dressing was wonderful and the salad was too.  I toasted the sesame seeds and the almond slivers and glad I did!  The toasting added a really good nutty flavor.  I would highly recommend this recipe.  UPDATE:  The top part of the salad dressing, WILL SOLIDIFY, when left over night in the fridge.  Pop it in the microwave for about 20 seconds and stir well.

Very delicious. I ended up with more dressing than needed since we use dressing sparingly. i would cut back on the sugar by 1/3 also when i make again.

This is such an easy to make great tasting salad, I added fresh blueberries as well to mine when I made it. Definitely a hit with my family. The recipe makes a lot of dressing, before you just dump it all on the salad start with what looks like enough and add more to your liking. I used about half of the dressing and for my family it was the perfect amount.

Love, love, love this recipe and so does everyone else. I love to take to a potluck and watch as a monks the wide array of food choices, most people go back for seconds or at least try to as long as it lasts. I also love that you can change it up. I generally add blueberries and sometimes I add goat cheese.

Definitely cut back on the sugar, at least by half. I used balsamic white vinegar instead of distilled white. Also added a chopped apple.

This dressing was so good! It reminds us more of an Asian dressing.

 I had some strawberries and dressing left over after serving this salad and I chopped the remaining strawberries into very small chunks and added it to the remaining dressing.  The next day we had delicious strawberry dressing with our salad!

This salad was incredible! Made it to have for Christmas dinner and it was loved, and a very festive salad. I cut the sugar in half and used a pomegranate balsamic vinegar, per other reviewers. Try it, it doesn't disappoint!

This was a delicious salad dressing that would compliment almost any salad.  I made it as is, but I candied the slivered almonds and added them just as I served the salad so the almonds were nice and crunchy-sweet.  I use 3 teaspoons  of white sugar in a fry pan with 1/4 cup slivered almonds and stir fry until golden brown.

I loved this salad! A perfect side dish for any meal. Next time I make it, I will use less vinegar (or switch to red wine vinegar), basically for the tastebuds of my children who thought it was too sour.

its a regular at my place during strawberry season. there is just no going wrong with it. sometimes i'd add pine nuts, sometimes walnuts, and if available even pomegranates. I just use shredded spinach instead of baby spinach. I use no more than 2T of oil and half Cup vinegar. however you do it, this salad is a winner!

This is sure to become a favorite summer salad! Bright, fresh flavors combined with the crunch of the almonds. The dressing is delicious too! The only thing I suggest is using less sugar. In fact, I've started using granulated Swerve, a no-calorie natural sugar substitute. It does make more than enough dressing, so you'll probably have enough to use for a second salad. This would also be tasty with crumbled goat cheese or feta.

Delicious! We loved the flavor of the dressing and the crunch from the almonds added a nice texture. I may add some red onion next time just for a little something more. I will be making this again, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Even though there are only a few ingredients in the salad of this recipe, we love this salad! The crunchy almonds and sweet strawberries work perfectly with the spinach.   The only thing I would change is to reduce the amount of sugar used.  It was too sweet for our taste.

Simple, fresh, colorful, and flavorful!
I used 1/2 the sugar called for in the recipe and we all liked it!

Next time I'll try using Balsamic Vinegar and cutting the sugar in half. I accidentally added 2 T of Poppy Seeds and I'll never do that again, lol!  Used toasted walnuts and added Feta. Very Good!

This was a win! Was made for a family get together so everything was consumed. I normally make the dressing separate and use as needed when not for a large gathering and it works wonderful for work/school lunches

Home run for our Mother's Day Brunch. Following several other suggestions, I did the following tweaks: 1) Reduced sugar to equivalent of 1/4 cup and used a combination of splenda and stevia due to dietary concerns 2) Split  vinegar to 1/8 cup balsamic and 1/8 cup distilled white 3) Added crumbled Feta cheese.  It  was delicious and everyone wanted the recipe!

AMAZING! The only change I made was to use less sugar. I only needed half the salad dressing so I used the other half in a fresh salad (the same ingredients) the next day and it was even better! I'll let it sit overnight from now on! Company-worthy!!!

I printed at least 6 recipes for Spinach Salad with Strawberries.  I tried the dressing for 3 of them and this was by far the best.  I did add some cheese to the salad though; white cheddar goat cheese is my favorite, but feta cheese is good on this salad, too.

I didn't have slivered almonds, only sliced and you could barely tell they were there, so, I made sugared walnuts that was on one of the other salad recipes and it was the perfect touch (Microwave 2 tablespoons sugar & 1 1/2 tsp sugar for 30 seconds; Pour over nuts and bake 15 min at 350 F).

I didn't use all the dressing either.  I served the dressing on the side and only 1-2 tablespoons per serving was enough.

Bottom line: This salad was delicious and I will make it again & again.  Please note that it is just as good with well-drained mandarin oranges instead of strawberries too

I made this and had to substitute the worcestershire for soya sauce and white vinegar for balsamic, as that's what I had on hand. I also followed other reviewers suggestions and used 1/4 c of sugar and 1 Tbsp of honey. I did this in the blender and it does thicken the dressing, but I just added a bit of water and shook it in a jar. It turned out great! Thanks for the recipe.

Made it pretty much as directed, but as others suggested decreased the sugar. It was plenty sweet for me with about half the sugar. I added chicken I grilled in a sweet-spicy sauce and croutons for a dinner salad.

I make this for the annual Mother Daughter event about every other year.  It is always a hit.  Spinach holds up well too so it is forgiving if you have to purchase it a few days ahead.

Made this today for our Easter dinner. I simply put all the ingredients in a mason jar and mixed it right in the jar. I cut the sugar in half as others have recommended, which worked great. Next time I will cut the amount of seeds in half in not more.

Loved this salad! To increase protein content, I added 3 oz salmon. To decrease calories I used 1/4 sugar and 2 packets of truvia. Finally, as a bonus, I had strawberry balsamic vinegar which capped it off. My family loved it too!

I made it for a Valentine's Day party (I thought the strawberries fit in well with the theme). While I didn't get to try it myself, my guests reported that it was a winner. There were no leftovers so I will have to take them at their word, and I'll have to make another batch for me and hubby.

Used dried cranberries which I soaked in water, drained for 20 minutes before adding to salad.  Used about 1/4 c sugar and it was sweet enough.

My family loved this salad.  I made a few changes.  I cut back on the sugar a little, used balsamic vinegar, and then added a little lemon juice because it needed some acid.  I have made it twice in the last two weeks.

I made this salad for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit!  I used pre-washed baby spinach which cut down on prep time.  I only used 1/2 cup of olive oil because a full cup just sounded like a lot for this salad. Turned out great!  I plan on making this salad many more times.

My favorite version of a strawberry spinach salad. For the onions I have tried several ways (white onion, red onion, grated, dehydrated) and I have discovered it tastes best when I use the dehydrated dry minced onions (found in the spice aisle). Blueberries are a nice addition to this salad if you happen to have them

My 13 year old made this as  a side to her dish for a cooking class.  She added fresh blueberries and shelled pecan halves to the salad as well. There is enough dressing, IMO, to make two salads (that's the only reason I gave it four stars).  Also, when we made it a second time, we cut down on the amount of sugarr to a little more than half the amount in the recipe.  It was delicious!

I made this exactly as written. (As I do with all recipes.  If I knew how to cook, I wouldn't need a recipe!)  It would have been better if the dressing didn't have so much sugar in it.  Live and learn :)  I will be making this again with adjustments

This is oh so lovely! As is is great but adding in feta cheese takes it up to a whole NUTHA level. I don't like mixing in dressing until just before serving due to past wilting experiences.  But that's just a personal preference. Strawberries aren't in season apparently so I used raspberries and blackberries instead which I think I'd prefer, their sweetness is very light and delicate. Then there is the sweetness of the dressing and crisp of the spinach coupled with the salty yet creaminess of the feta cheese was simply exquisite in my mouth. On the menu for next week too. And I love everyone's variations so I'm definitely going to try them out when I do get tired of this combo. Perfect summer salad!

I have made this easy and delicious salad many times to share at pot lucks. It always get raves and is the first item to be gobbled up. Note - On a hot day, be sure and put the dressing on at the last minute so the spinach does not wilt.

I made this recipe for the first time 2 years ago for my daughter's wedding reception.  Many people asked me for the recipe and I had someone just last week ask for it who remembered it from the reception.  The only change I made was I used candied pecans instead of the slivered almonds but that was due to my daughter's request.  It's delicious as written.  Fresh, ripe strawberries are a must which makes me wish they were in season all year.  I realized I never rated it back then so came back to give it 5 stars.

Took this to a dinner for 4 ladies, and used less than the full amount of all ingredients, but they loved it.  It's easy to decrease or increase this recipe.  Now I have leftover ingredients to enjoy again!  It doesn't save real well after dressing is added so best not to mix more than you will use that day.  I did cut down the sugar a bit after reading other reviews - used a heavy 1/3 cup.

I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup and I added two packets of stevia instead. I also cut out the poppyseeds and added more sesame seeds. I through in two teapsooons of sesame oil and one tablespoon of soy sauce to finish it. I also used twice as much onion and made it a red one. Amazing results.

We loved, loved, loved this recipe!  Very fresh and perfect for summertime.  The only change I made was using scallions (green onions) which I chopped very fine.

This salad is fabulous.  I give it 5 stars mainly because of the dressing, which I use on most salads I make;everyone always comments on it.  I do leave out the minced onion, as I'm not a fan and use only 1/4 cup of sugar, as I think 1/2 is too much.  I like to vary the salad and often exchange fresh pineapple, apple, blueberries, oranges or peaches for the strawberries.  You can't go wrong with this salad, and it is a great way to work in spinach to the family's diet.  love!

My new favorite salad.  My last party everyone said it was their favorite!  I would say that I didn't toss all together.  I had the dressing on the side.  Some like just a little and some like a lot.  Was perfect!

We loved the salad and only made a few changes.  I left out the sesame seeds in the dressing since our family is not fond of them.  We also added chunks of goat cheese.  It was so tasty and I served it to company.  Everyone really enjoyed the salad and I will make it again.

This was delicious ! Only change I made was using white balsamic vinegar instead of plain white vinegar. This recipe does make a lot of dressing and we just spooned it over each serving.

I ran out of time, and didn't blanch the almonds.  This was my first time making it, and I don't think it altered the taste of the salad.  This is a refreshing & zingy salad that holds up well being transported briefly once made.

The base of this salad is good - spinach, strawberries, and almonds. But I don't care for the dressing. I prefer the mayonnaise/white wine vinegar dressing of Strawberry Romaine Salad on this site. I served this salad with a grilled chicken breast for a complete dinner.

I used balsamic because it is what I had in hand, but didn't change a thing. Everyone loves it. I probably will cut back on sugar next time to be a little healthier, but it is delicious as is.

This was perfect. I sliced the strawberries and sprinkled icing sugar over them. Stirred them & let them sit overnight. The next day I added a couple tablespoons to each bowl of this salad and everyone loved it.

Excellent salad. I swapped the distilled vinegar with a cranberry pear balsamic, and I added feta cheese to balance the sweetness. Be sure to whisk the dressing quite a bit to dissolve the sugar.

Strawberries not in season, so used dried cranberries, and cut sugar in half.  Everything else according to recipe.  This was delicious!  We plan to have this dressing a lot!!

I didn't  have sesame or poppy seeds. Took advice from another person and added feta. It's winter so I used cuties/mandarin oranges and some crasins, you can pretty much substitute any fruit. My partner told me it's  his new favorite salad. 
I do think it needs less sugar. I added a grind of black pepper and a splash or two of Cider vinegar bc of the sweetness.  Great salad! Definitely add the feta!

I have adorned a strawberry spinach salad for lunches, buffets and dinner's for ages.  Ask a true fan of any salad eater, show me one and  I will devour it.  Now, the strawberry spinach salad, it is by far, one of the most delicious scrumptious salads I know.

Wonderful recipe!! I made this with a few extra ingredients including feta cheese, almonds, and instead of strawberries I added raspberries. Our local market was out of strawberries.
I recommend this salad to anyone who is a salad lover!

I LOVE this recipe! I do a few things differently though. I skip the seaseme seeds, add feta or goat cheese and I use pecans (either regular or candied work well). I've gotten sooo many complements every time I make this :)

Delicious! The only change I made was swapping out the almonds for toasted walnuts. Pleasantly surprised the dressing wasn't too sweet - definitely a do-again - might add some soft feta crumbled in.

I made this salad for my Thanksgiving diner and it was a big hit. I would definitely cut back on the sugar and add a bit more vinegar. I tried the recipe exactly like this (without the poppey seeds though), but for next time I would use Balsamic Vinegar and perhaps cut the sugar to 1/4 a cup. Really amazing dressing though.

This salad was fantastic! We're used to the hearty ranch, and honey mustard type dressings on traditional iceburg lettuce so this was very exotic for us. I'd imagine it had no less calories than our store bought dressing but it's fun to try new things and make your own. I didn't have enough spinach so I stretched it with green leaf and a bit of pre-bagged iceburg salad mix, the flavor was still very much delightful but a little runny from the strawberry juices. I recommend blending the vinaigrette ingredients because whisking took too long to get the sugar to mix well. Also you probably could get by with half the dressing because after I was done serving we had quite a bit left over at the bottom of the salad bowl.

I have made this recipe a few times now and it is amazing!!! The first time I make a recipe I follow it exactly as written. But the next time I made it I decreased the poppy seeds down by half. I found the original recipe was just too much. Still deserves 5 stars though!! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is a great summer salad. I did make a few changes. Instead of white vinegar I used raspberry vinegar. I omitted the sugar and added raspberry crystal light (to taste)When I make dressings I do not measure I taste it until its what I am looking for. I also cut red onion very thin and added it to top of salad. Yum!

This was good, but I'll make some changes next time. I adjusted the ingredients for 8 servings, and the recipe called for 1 cup of sugar. I used 1/2 cup instead, and feel that's still too much. If I make the salad for 4, I'll use 1/4 cup. I also misread the amount and added too much sesame seed, so I'll make sure I do that correctly next time. I added bleu cheese crumbles, and next time will add crumbled bacon.

Made this for Fourth of July. Doubled the the recipe to serve 10 adults. Everyone enjoyed it. Perfect summer salad. Next time I make it (and I will make it again) I will use other reviewers suggestions and cut the sugar in half. The original amount of sugar makes it just a teensy bit sweet, definitely not over-powering but just a bit too much for my taste.

I made this for the first time last week.  I had friends over for lunch and wanted to find a use for the abundance of strawberries I had on hand.  It was delicious.  I dry toasted the almonds in a small saucepan.  That was the only change I made from the original recipe.  Everybody loved it.  I plan to make it again soon.

The salad is very good prepared as the recipe states, but to take it up to five stars toast the almonds in a dry skillet and cool before adding them to the salad. This gives more crunch and makes them much more flavorful. Also, be sure to chill the dressing for at least 30 minutes before pouring on. I usually make it ahead of time--sometimes the night before--  (with about HALF the sugar) then bring it to room temp and shake well before pouring onto salad. Every time I've brought it to a gathering I'm asked for the recipe and it always goes fast! YUM!!

I have been making this salad for 40 yrs with modifications. Instead of poppy and sesame seeds I use sunflower. And instead of strawberries I use bacon and hard boiled eggs. Add a 1/4 cup of ketchup to dressing ingredients and use blender to mix dressing.

I made the dressing by putting the ingredients (except the seeds) in a small food processor.  I used walnuts instead of almonds and added a sprinkle of feta cheese on top.  My husband ate his whole serving and he usually won't eat a spinach salad.  I think he was surprised at how good it was.  I also cut the recipe in half since I only needed salad for two people.

I used Apple cider vinegar because that's what I had on hand. I also didn't have poppy seeds, use of them I assume would add some textural appeal although I didn't feel like I was missing out without them. I used the dried minced onion (found with the spices in the grocery) instead of trying to finely chop a fresh onion. Very good!!! I Doubled the dressing and kept the leftover in the fridge for use on any salad.  I didn't tear the spinach. And put quite a bit of slivered almonds probably twice as much as the recipe calls for. I served it without chilling it for the 10-15 minutes and my guests and I thought it was still very very good! I will try chilling next time to see if this makes it even better- Great salad!

OMG!  I'm so glad I chose this recipe out of all the ones that popped up.  And I love the "change servings" option...so helpful for my family of three! I used toasted pecans because I had pecans on hand & I love toasted nuts, just brings out the flavor more.  But it's the dressing that makes this salad! YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!

I too like the balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup sugar and bacon and feta if desired. I like that it can be changed up and still so delicious, can make it more often that way!

I was hesitant to combine spinach and strawberries.  I just couldn't imagine it could be that good but it was!  The 5 stars made it give it a try.  The dressing and the nuts made this salad complete.
I'd definitely recommend this as a light, delicious, nutricious salad.

Terrific salad.  I left out the poppy and sesame seeds because they get stuck in your teeth.  I don't think you need them - this recipe is delicious and turned out perfectly.  Next time I might throw a little bacon in there for some salt to contrast the sweet dressing.  Perfect as-is though.

A little sweet but delicious.   I chose to use coconut  sugar, added walnuts and some dried cranberries for just the right taste for me.  I may add a little feta next time around.

I invited my friend over for lunch. I asked him if he could have anything for lunch; he replied; Spinach "Salad"...So I searched and found this recipe. I had strawberries that needed to be used. 
I am so glad I found this. My friend raved and raved about it. I enjoyed it as well. This salad is huge. and it so yummy. 

My husband who does not usually comment on my cooking efforts actually said how good it is. 

I followed the recipe as stated. Poppy and Sesame seed are items that I usually do not have on hand. The most expensive part of this salad are those things. However, I have more leftover, and plan on serving this to the food critic (my spouse) tomorrow evening.

Will start by saying that I was not a big spinach salad fan.  But I made this for a guest who loves raw spinach.  This salad tasted awesome!  I'm now a believer in spinach. :)  I didn't have Worcestershire Sauce so I used balsamic vinegar instead - it was delicious.

Great!  Definitely making it again!   I did not have almond slivers so I used sunflower seeds instead.  I would also cut the sugar to 1/4 cup or maybe even less...it was a bit on the sweet side.

This is the best salad I've ever tasted! Made it yesterday for Easter Sunday and it was the best dish of the entire meal! I followed every step of the recipe just as it says, and it turned out perfect. This will definitely be a staple in our house this spring/summer. This would also be great with cooked chicken tossed in it to make it a full meal. Will try that on a hot summer day. Loved!

I did use the balsamic vinegar, as other users have suggested, but this salad is AMAZING. The sugar adds a nice contrast to the vinegar, but I may add a little less next time, just for a healthier option. I think it's imperative to use fresh ingredients - definitely fresh spinach and strawberries. Not only is it delicious, but the overall look is beautiful. After placing the spinach, I drizzled fine lines of the dressing (you really don't need a lot), added sliced almonds, and topped with strawberries in the center... truly beautiful and delicious. I will absolutely make this again! Thank you so much for the recipe!

This salad was delicious!  I had fresh spinach and strawberries that were both picked the day I made this recipe.  We had three people that ate the entire salad, with lots of second and third helpings. The dressing was a bit sweet, so I would recommend cutting down the amount of sugar that you use.

Very good and well received, however, a bit too much dressing, and might decrease the sugar, when using fresh sweet strawberries. But will make this again, as the flavor differences between the spinach and berries were spot on.

I made this tonight with red onion and without the poppy and sesame seeds (I didnt have any), and the dinner group commented throughout the night about how good it was!  I used 1/4 cup sugar and added sliced red onion to the salad, and just used baby spinach so there was no need to cut it.  They asked me to bring this salad to every meal from now on, so I suppose it was  hit!

My baby spinach at Publix came in a 6 oz. bag. I was shocked at the amount of oil and sugar for a 10 oz bag so I started out with 2 Tbls of good quality olive oil and 1 T sugar BUT sprinkled a little sugar at a time into the oil and would up with 1 tsp. white sugar and cut the distilled vinegar to 1 Tblsp, a splash Worcestershire, and no seeeds or paprika, 1 Tblsp red onion. I used one half of a 6 oz. bag of baby spinach and 1/2 of the dressing. I added fresh strawberries, fresh blueberies, and crumbled Feta.  It was a perfectly dressed salad with 1/2 the dressing for a repeat tomorrow.  The dressing is WAY too much quantity and sugar and a waste of good quality olive oil. The concept is 5* but the dressing quantities are way off.

An instant favorite for me and my family.  We cut back on the amount of olive oil used.  We used fresh strawberries and substituted some clover honey in place of a 1/2 cup of white sugar.  Great salad for Easter dinner.

If you like strawberries this is the most delicious salad that you ever tasted. The dressing makes it worth while to make, I think it has become my families favorite whether it is made in summer or winter it is a real treat.

A great recipe so fresh and delicious I cut back on the sugar and only ended up using less than have the dressing... I also used role n lettuce because one of the people I was making city for couldn't have spinach.... And it turned out really good I could only imagine how great it would be with spinach...

Very tasty!  I substituted white balsamic for the regular vinegar, toasted the almonds, and added some feta cheese to offset the sweetness of the dressing.  I've done a variation using mandarin oranges in place of the strawberries - both ways are great.

This dressing tastes very similar to Marston's San Pasqual salad dressing (CA) and also to Babe's (chicken restaurant chain in TX.  I made it using 1/4 cup of sugar as others had mentioned but wasn't quite sweet enough and the flavor of the olive oil was too predominant.  Added the additional 1/4 cup of sugar and that did the trick.  Used freeze-dried red onions and omitted the poppy seeds and sesame seeds.  Also, used apple cider vinegar instead of white which gave it a bit more zing in the flavor area.  Next time will try a white balsamic vinegar (just to keep the color lighter).  Will use this instead of paying big bucks for same/similar dressing.  Thanks Tozenuf!

This is absolutely delicious!!!  I am always asked for this recipe.  I read a few reviews and followed some of the changes.  Used balsamic vinegar instead of the white distilled and I used red onion.   I also didn't have any poppy seeds or sesame seeds, therefore I didn't put any in and it was great!

Love this dressing.  I don't use the poppy or sesame seeds and it still tastes great.

Made this for my husband and we both LOVED it.  This is a great summer salad.  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, added feta cheese, cucumber, and walnuts.  I also used balsamic vinegar instead of white.  I will definitely make this salad again!

This is very nice.  I'm giving it 4 stars because for me it was a little too sweet, I would cut back on the sugar, but it is a lovely recipe and you should try it.  Almonds and strawberries are very nice.

Even though I did not have the sesame seeds, the salad tasted fantastic.  This salad is very fresh tasting.  The dressing is what makes the salad taste so great.  I plan to add this recipe to my regular rotation.

Awesome! I did not think I liked spinach until I ate it this way! This has got to be one of the best recipes I have found here. I used fresh baby spinach, only 1 Tbsp of the sesame seeds which seemed like enough and no almonds. You have got to try this, it's so good!

Excellent. I made this twice. once for dinner (used pecans) and the next day for my work picnic(blanched almonds). I used green onions and I prefered walnuts or pecans.  I think The blanched almonds were more for texture than taste.  It was delicious

WOW. And I'm not even a salad girl at heart. I used balsamic vinegar instead of white and omitted the poppy seeds because I didn't have any.  Was totally fine without.  Used less sugar than the 1/2 cup listed.  Chopped and toasted some almonds.  Put chopped red onion into my mini-processor to "mince" it properly so that it was more of a slushy consistency when added to the other dressing ingredients.  Added a few turns of black pepper as well as crumbled blue cheese.  Served with grilled Italian sausage and corn on the cob - delish.

This was wonderful- it's better when dressing can sit for several hours- gives sugar more time to mix!  Will definitely make again soon!!

Let me just start off by saying that this salad is the bomb!! I made it today for a potluck at work. The salad was already more than halfway gone by the time i got to the table...no fooling. And to top that off, they didn't even have the dressing on it yet. After they tried it with the dressing I had requests for the recipe and to bring another batch tomorrow. I decided not to use the sesame or poppy seeds. I used a spinach and other leafy green blend. I think it was baby leaf or something like that... I think any kind of lettuce or leafy green would work. Try this recipe you will not be diappointed.

I made this salad for a big dinner, and it was gone after a few minutes! I added mandarin oranges and red onion, and used pecans instead of almonds. I also didn't have any poppy seeds, so I left them out. The dressing was good, but I wasn't a big fan of all those sesame seeds, next time I'd leave them out.

Great recipe! To save a little money, skip the sesame seeds (and toast the almonds for a more nutty taste). YUM.

I am real impressed with this recipe! My family a salad to them must be a lettuce/chef type salad with ONLY the following dressings: Ranch, French, or Honey Mustard. I enjoy trying different salads and dressings, and when I seen this, I knew it would be great. Only alteration I did was cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup because my strawberries were quite sweet, and let each person add the chilled dressing to the chilled salad. The recipe says the dressing is for 4 servings, but a little of the dressing goes a long way. With strawberry/spinach season upon us, I know we will be fixing this again. *UPDATE* We made this again last night. I had a few overly riped strawberries, so I pureed them in the blender and added to the dressing. This was very good as well!

wow! This was an amazing salad.  The only change was I used splenda instead of sugar, you can't tell the difference and it keeps the salad healthy .  Next time I will only use 1/4 cup olive oil , I thought it was a little to heavy .  Thanks for the recipe!

This is fabulous -- even my very picky mother, who thinks I like "weird food" loves it and asks me to bring it to family events.  To "healthy up" this recipe, we cut the olive oil in half. We substituted 1/4 Splenda for the sugar. Still plenty sweet!

So delicious!  I made a few changes by adding bacon crumbles and Feta cheese.  Also I reduced the sugar a bit.  I doubled the spinach and strawberries because the dressing was enough for two salads.  It was absolutely fantastic.  I will make this again and again!

I always try to follow recipes close the first time so I can give a true rating. The only thing I changed was I added walnuts instead of almonds. This is soo yummy. The dressing really pulls this together yummy yum!

This was a great and easy dinner... My husband loved it.  I took everyones suggestions and altered the recipe and it turned out great.  I didn't add the sesame or poppy seeds, I used balsamic instead of white vinegar, reduced everything to 1/4 cup, use 2 scallions instead of onion, added bacon, crumbled goat cheese, and added strawberries, pears and chicken . I also blended the dressing and added a touch of water. The chicken was frozen grilled chicken from wholefoods that I heated in a frying pan with fresh lemon juice and a little lawry salt... easy and quick.

This salad is the only way I get my four children and picky husband to eat spinach! I make it exactly as written every time! When strawberries aren't in season I use dried cranberries. Note, I use dried minced onion and it works perfectly as long as you make it early enough for them to soften. I also serve this most holidays and get togethers because it's so pretty! Always a crowd pleaser for 8 years now I think. Love it!!

This is a delicious salad! I did make a couple changes. I only used 1/4 olive oil and I didn't add the minced onion. I cut the recipe down because I was only cooking for 2.

Great dressing! I would probably use honey next time instead of sugar. We added walnuts and feta, but it would probably be great with chicken on top. This one is a keeper.

def half the olive oil and use high quality olive oil.  added some water and def sub in balsamic vinegar for the reg distilled vinegar.  added blueberries and blackberries for a great, healthy salad.  took the suggestion of toasting the sesame and poppy seeds.  did the same for the almonds, rather than blanching them.

This was a pretty good salad. I used it for Thanksgiving and got good reviews. It's better to wait until just before serving to put the dressing though, or it will wilt big-time. Also, once the dressing is on, you may want to add a little more spinach as the dressing weighs it down. Other than that, the strawberries and slivered almonds were a hit! Thanks.

This is a very good salad, and a great quick fix to make for get togethers. If you don't let the dressing chill, the sugar won't dissolve and it won't taste as good. I make the recipe as written, and use Butter Toffee Almond accents instead of slivered almonds.

My family loves this salad.  I do make a few changes:  I leave out the sesame seeds in the dressing and instead of almonds I use glazed walnuts.  I add crumbled feta cheese or goat cheese.

This salad was AWESOME and easy to make! My picky in-laws and husband raved about it. The only thing I did differently was warming the dressing in the microwave a little (15 sec) to melt the sugar so the dressing was smooth. Once it cooled I poured it into my salad and topped it with honey roasted almonds. Everybody wanted thirds but I ran out of ingredients. Thanks Tozenuf for the great recipe.

This recipe was pretty good, but I think that the next time that I try this (which I probably will) I will reduce the amount of sugar, and slightly increase the amount of vinegar.  I took it in for a school pot luck, and people liked it, but most of them did say they would add more vinegar next time.  Very pretty though, and a fun new recipe.

The dressing is a little on the heavy side, but it pairs very well with the strawberries. I added blueberries and it'd work well with other fruit, too. Might make this one regularly for gatherings.

This is a delicious salad recipe -- but a bit too sweet for me (and for a true vinaigrette, I think). In the spirit of the wine vinegar, I added a few splashes of balsamic as well, to add a little more tang and cut the sweet in half. Additionally, for those health-conscious cooks, I substituted splenda for the sugar. It was a big hit at the dinner party.

Delicious!!  I made the dressing as written - I like a sweet dressing on spinach salad - but did substitue white wine vinegar for distilled white.  However, I doubled the quantities of spinach, strawberries, and almonds to make a party-size salad, and there was plenty of dressing for the larger salad.  If making the salad in the original size, I would strongly suggest halving the quantity of dressing.  Also, I did not refrigerate the dressing or the salad, and I had feta cheese available as an optional topping, which most, including myself, enjoyed.

This was WAY Yummy! I made is as stated, but slightly redused the sugar and oil and added a bit more vinegar (white balsalmic).  It was delicious!  Don't let it set with the dressing on it.  It makes the strawberries mushy.

I would give this recipe a 9/10.  It is tried and true when following the original recipe. Depending on the meal that it is being served with, I will sometimes add feta cheese to it when it is being tossed. I have also made it with balsamic vinegar instead of white and used green onions instead of a regular onion. I think it would be good with red onion as well.

Wow! my husband, who never eats fruit or vegetables, just ate half of this salad! I loved the textures, and it was very sweet, even though we followed other's suggestions as cut the sugar in half (and used baslamic vinegar and red onions as others suggested). I used cashews and toasted them, as they are the only nuts my hubby likes. We had this with "balsamic glazed salmon fillets" also found on this site (and a 5 star recipe too).

This recipe was delicious! Used half the sugar & blended the dressing as suggested by others. Great blend of flavors!  I chose to make a meal out of the salad by adding grilled chicken tenderloins, cherry tomatoes, avocado, & feta cheese. All the flavors worked so well together and the strawberries added a nice sweetness. Soooo good!

I'd really like to give this recipe 5 stars but it's just not spectacular as written. The only change I made was reducing the sugar to 1/4 c. Wished I had followed other reviewer's advice and subbed balsamic vinegar... If I do use this recipe again I will also try toasting the almonds.

I made this last night and it is very tasty! 1/2 a cup of sugar seems like a lot, for someone wathing their sugars, just wondering if others have used less and if it turned out okay.

Just add another positive review to the pile.

If I had anything negative to say, it would be about the high amount of sugar in the dressing. I might cut that down or sub it with some honey or something next time.

This was phenomenal-I did however make a couple of changes. I love balsamic vinegar so I substituted it for white wine vinegar. Also, I did not have sesame or poppy seeds on hand the first time out. Still great.

Second time around I had poppy seeds. Didn't take away from the recipe but nor did I think it added additional flavor.

My MIL said this was restaurant quality.
It was a side along with spaghetti for the Grilled Bruschetta Chicken recipe (equally phenomenal) that I also got from here. What a great meal.

Fabulous salad. I used 1/4 cup of Splenda in place of the white sugar. This recipe is basically the same as Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad with the exception of the oil and worcestershire sauce. (a five star rating on Jamie's salad as well.)

I love this salad.  It is so easy and versatile.  The flavor is slightly tangy, being a little more on the sweet side.  I have also substituted blackberries for the strawberries with great success.

Super yum!  The best part is the dressing and can modify from there.  I made spinach with dried cherries and candied pecans with this dressing.

This is wonderful!  I did make a few personal changes: Only 1 Tbsp of poppy seeds and 3/4 c. splenda for the dressing.  I also put less trawberries in and added raspberries, blueberries, blanched slivered almonds, feta cheese w/tomatoes & basil as well as blue chees crumbled.  Everyone loves this.

This recipe is so awesome.  My 13 year old daughter who won't eat anything green asks for this salad every time she see's strawberries.  A little on the sweet side but all of the suggestions helped to tone it down.

This is so delicious! I used balsamic vinegar and dried minced onion to the dressing and let it chill for several hours. I also toasted the seeds in Pam in a nonstick skillet. I also added iceburg lettuce to the spinach for variety and mandarin oranges and cracked black pepper to the top. I also added broken up ramen noodles at the last minute and served dressing on the side-oh yes and red onion rings! Delicious! Everybody raved at the progressive supper!

This recipe is fantastic!  I really do not cook often so my husband was thrilled when he came home to this wonderful salad...he was even more excited when it turned out to be delicious.

The best salad we have ever tasted.  We omitted the poppy seeds and the sesame seeds since we are trying to watch are fat intake.  Besides that I made it just as described.  My husband thought it was outstanding.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar just a tad and add some more strawberries.  I was extremely skeptical about this salads ingredients at first so I am presently surprised.  Thank you so much for the awesome recipe.

A little tart, but overall excellent.  I might try adding some kind of goat cheese next time I make it.

This salad has become one of my favorite foods! You've got to try it - it is perfect for company or for taking to a picnic. I toast the poppy seeds and the sesame seeds, and I also recommend cutting back on the sugar a little. Delicious!!

I took it to a brunch this morning and everyone loved it.  I substituted mixed organic greens for the spinach, and used red wine vinegar.  Next time, we'll dry "fry" the almonds a bit.

This salad was great!  Though a side dish to other very good entrees, it got its own share of attention.  I needed to make it for more people so I followed the recipe for 8 and ended up with lots of dressing I didn't need - which I happily used for a week after that meal!

I make this recipe already with canola oil (instead of olive) and baby spinach instead of regular spinach. I also omit the almonds and use apple cider vinegar instead of white.
Well worth a try! This recipe is delicious!

AWESOME salad! I have gotten nothing but compliments when I make this salad, everyone loves it. I do make a few substitutions: instead of olive oil, use vegetable and instead of distilled vinegar, use white wine vinegar. Also, I add feta cheese to the salad, and it really adds a great flavor. Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

I also made this for Easter dinner.  It was very easy to make and it had excellent flavor.  It is my new "company" salad.  I combined all the ingredients and mixed in the blender and then chilled for 2-3 hours.  Don't worry, it definetly makes more than enough dressing for 10 oz. spinach.

I LOVE this salad.  It's easy to make and tastes wonderful.  I orginally made it for a party, but my husband and I enjoyed the leftovers for many days after.  (I kept the dressing in a separate bowl so the salad wouldn't get soggy).  It was very refreshing and I'll definitely make it again.

I have made this several times now, mostly in the summer. I use raspberry vinegar and leave out the poppy seeds as I don't typically have have them on hand. I glaze pecans instead of using almonds and throw in some tomato-basil feta at the end. Very good.

This recipe is awesome!  Make sure you follow the directions and refrigerate the dressing ahead of time.  I usually just use the almond toppers instead of plain almonds.  I sprinkle ground flaxseed over my salad before putting the dressing on it - probably because I am a registered dietitian.  :)

This was a hit at a recent salad potluck! I didn't make any changes. When I made it again at home, I reserved some of the dressing for future use, it saves well for about 2 days.

This salad was wonderful!  I brought it to a potluck hosted by my Indonesian neighbor, and all her friends and family wanted seconds.  Then I made it the next night for my own family, and my son said it was now his favorite salad.  The dressing for this is very unique but has a wonderful flavor and goes very well with the spinach.  The strawberries add their own special something to the salad and add to the beautiful presentation as well.  I also liked the fact that it can be made in 1 hr.  Definitely a family favorite from now on.

This is SOOO good!!! My husband just raves about this salad.  Everytime I make a different salad he says "why didn't you make the strawberry one?  I like that one much better than this"  I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe; I do find that it is so easy to make the dressing in my Pampered Chef dressing container/mixer.  Make sure to wait til the last minute to pour the dressing!

Very good, I would definitely make this again.  As other reviewers have noted, it makes lots of dressing and I only used about half of it.  Perfect for a summer cookout.

This was an excellent salad.  I felt like I should be adding cheese and bacon but it needed nothing but what was in the recipe. Will miss this salad when strawberries aren't in season.

No lie -- this tastes so good, I challenge you to find someone who doesn't like it!  Okay, it helps if they like sweet things.  In fact I will cut the sugar in half next time I make it.  Following others suggestions, I substituted with balsamic vinegar and used half strawberries, half mandarin oranges.  And since we're on the South Beach diet, I used Splenda instead of sugar.  I'm sure I will make this many times and share the recipe with friends and family.

Excellent summer salad!  I added mandarin oranges because they're my favorite and I thought it would complement the flavors.  It was very good and had a nice presentation as well.

I made this recipe for a dinner party a couple of weeks ago. It was fabulous. I did make the dressing the night before so the flavors had a chance to combine, then added the spinach and strawberries an hour before serving. I did serve it with an additional homemade blue cheese dressing that complimented the slad very well. It was a big hit and a salad I will make again. Thanks!!

This salad is wonderful! It would be great for a bridal shower or ladies's luncheon. I used half spinach and half baby arugula blend and used toasted pecans instead of slivered almonds. I omitted the seasame seeds in the dressing and used red onions to make the dressing pink, but it didn't really change the color, but still looked prettier. My husband loved the dressing (there wasn't enough salad leftover from the brunch for him to try) and said it was even better than Italian. One thing I would suggest is to not use as much poppy seeds, maybe only 1-2 ts. All in all, I'll be making it again in a few days for a potluck!

This is a very tasty salad. However, I subsititued red onion for minced onion, only 1/4 cup sugar, and added blue cheese crumbles as others suggested. I loved it, but was still a little sweet for my friend.

wonderful.  The strawberries at the store looked aweful, so I used raspberries and black berries and it was still to die for.  It has become a frequent request of my little sisters boyfriend.  I gave her credit for the salad (and I gave her the recipe).  My hubby loves it too.

Absolutely a perfect salad - there wasn't a piece of it left in the bowl!  I had a party of 60 for my sons graduation and it was a hit with both the adults and kids.  I didn't change a thing other than the quantity that I made.

This is a great salad.  The sugar in the dressing didn't disolve well so I think that next time I will mix the vinegar with the sugar until it disolves and then add the other ingredients.  I will also add some gorgonzola or bleu cheese the next time I make this.

I made this for Easter and WOW What a hit!  Everyone there would not leave without the recipe, it's almost a month later and people are still talking about it.  This is even better than what I've had in restaurants.  I have been searching for a recipe like this for ages!  Thanks Andrea, I will enjoy this for a long time to come.

This is fantastic!  I was the only one with an empty bowl (and four requests for the recipe) at an office pitch-in.  Since then, I've practically drunk the dressing out of the bottle when I've run out of spinach.  So healthy and satisfying.  Very delicious salad, and one that will grace my summer table many, many times! (I use sugared pecans.)

This was a big hit at a family BBQ Saturday night. Everyone insisted I bring it to Easter Dinenr the next day.  As others suggested I did cut back on the sugar a bit and added some salt and pepper to taste. I also left out the sesame seeds as the poopy seeds seemed like enough seeds to me.  The second day I made it I added some diced red onion at the request of my sister and Mom and it was even better!  This easily makes enough dressing to cover twice as much spinach.  I will be making this often!

This is an excellent salad recipe. I made this for me and my fiance one night -- we both loved it. It is surprisingly sweet, yet has just the right amount of tanginess. The sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and almonds give it a great nuttiness. The first time I made it with frozen strawberries (defrosted of course). The second time I made it for a cookout and everybody ate it up. Good recipe, a definite keeper.

This was delicious.   We all liked it.  Although my 7 year old wasn't crazy about it, he did eat some which is a bonus.  I might cut down a tad on the sugar next time.  Also, it makes way to much dressing, will probably scale it down a bit too.   Very good.

This salad was great!  It was really sweet tasting.  My spinach leaves were a bit tough..but they were probably just not picked at the right time.  My husband liked it as well.  Would be great to take to a church dinner.

This is GREAT!!  Can't wait to make it again..  My Hubby and I ate the WHOLE 
thing and it was only our "salad."  I think I'll take it to our Mother's Day party.
Andrea, thanks for sharing!!

This salad can sound forboding but it is really very delightful.  The sesame and poppy seeds are great and kids dig the sweet strawberries and spinach.

Oh, this is so classy and elegant! A special salad that impresses and plaeses. I too cut down to 1/3 a cup of sugar. I had leftover dressing, but I just stuck it in a jar and will use it again next week. This salad went excellent with lemon roasted chicken, twice-baked dill potatoes, and steamed asparagas. Thank you so much for this beautiful recipe!

Excellent salad!  Made it for Easter dinner and it was a huge hit!  It makes a lot of dressing, however, so we only used half, and saved the rest for more salad the next day.

This is an awesome recipe.  I used leaf lettuce instead of spinach and used sliced almonds with a sugar coating for extra crunch.  Divine!  I might cut the sugar in the dressing a bit next time if I use the sugared almonds again.

I love this recipe.  I make it every year for Easter and my whole family loves it, even my picky grampa!  I also add crumbled goat cheese, it is delicious.

I love this salad!!! I did cut down the amount of sugar and you only need 1/2 the amount of dressing. I put only a little dressing in the salad and let others add it to their own if they wanted. We didn't like the almonds so next time I think I will use La Choy noodles for crunch and I will probably add mandarin oranges for a little extra sweetness. Overall - great salad!

Great salad! I had a couple of requests for it today after the potluck. One honest person said it needed more vinegar and I agreed!

This was totally excellent!  I did cut down on the sugar and will probably reduce the sugar even more the next time.
