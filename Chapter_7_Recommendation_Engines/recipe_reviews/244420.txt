This was delicious! It was super creamy, and that little bit of peanut butter goes a long way.  I had to add a little more milk than the recipe called for, but I attribute that to everyone's blender is a little different. I will definitely be making this recipe again. (And again, and again:).) Thanks for sharing!

I used plain yogurt instead of milk with a squeeze of lemon or kalamansi, 1 teaspoon of pure honey and took out the chocolate. Tastes like tart banana frozen yogurt.

Surprisingly creamy!  I added quite a bit more milk than the 2 tablespoons.  This did really well in my Ninja!  Definitely a keeper.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was creamy with a bit of texture from the peanuts and dark chocolate.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for such a yummy and much healthier ice cream option.
