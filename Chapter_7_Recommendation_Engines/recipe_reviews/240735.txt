I read many different recipes before trying my hand at making chocolate covered cherries. They're my Dad's -FAVORITE- and I decided to make them from scratch this year instead of buying them (which has been a Christmas tradition ever since I can remember). This recipe ROCKS. He absolutely loved them (and I can honestly tell you he is VERY picky about his chocolate covered cherries! -and would have been honest about what could have been done differently 'next time' to make them better). **My advice for making them (I read a VERY complex review before making them and thought it would take me a whole day just to put them together...) however, my success (which came without the ultra-complicated procedure) was guaranteed with this recipe (it's really, really easy-just a little time intensive when wrapping the cherries). Hints: *Do start with a pan that will fit in your freezer, lined with Parchment Paper* 1. Always use REAL butter (nothing is like REAL butter- nothing). 2. Don't let your cherries dry out like crazy dry before you wrap them. Make sure the outside is really dry so the 'dough' will wrap around it well, but the juice that's still inside the cherries lends to the 'liquification' process that happens in the next few days. 3. Don't use a huge amount of dough around each cherry. I found that using about 1/8 inch (and of course, I'm NOT measuring...just eyeball it & don't pack it on like a golfball :) this stuff is really rich -and delicious- but RICH...and yowehangoawjgo

Very indulgent! Nice Holiday drink. I used cherry flavored vodka this time.
