Other than sauteing an onion and a good amount of garlic in butter with the meat and adding a little liquid smoke, this is hands down the best sloppy joe filling I've ever had. I topped this with shredded sharp cheddar and toasted the buns a bit to make them hold up a little better. This is my new sloppy joe recipe. Even my husband who loves that nasty canned junk loved this. AWESOME. NOTE: If you don't like all that ketchup, think about cutting the ketchup in half and using either chili sauce or BBQ sauce.

Oh, wow!  Back in college, when I thought that Sloppy Joes grew in cans, the dish didn’t seem fit for human consumption. Now, I’m thinking that canned versions simply can’t compete with the real thing, plus … well, why waste money at the market when this dish is quick, easy & inexpensive? I recently made it for the 5th time and loved seeing my husband & guests return for more.  When salsa hasn’t been onhand, Pico De Gallo (for which there are several excellent recipes at this site) has worked great, and on one occasion I used Rotel tomatoes (the type with lime juice & cilantro)—also excellent. I guess there’s no way to ruin this recipe, for which I’m *very* grateful to LV & her mom-in-law.  (Thanks, as well, to photographer Avon Lady, whose shot portrays the dish 100% accurately—thick, non-greasy & delightful on big fluffy buns which, like another reviewer, I serve lightly toasted.)

Made these tonight on the advice of several on the RE and they didn't disappoint. I made a double batch and froze half for another time. I didn't measure the ketchup or salsa and think I might have used a bit less than the recipe states, but I definitely got all the flavor. I also used white wine vinegar instead of plain vinegar. I added some red pepper flakes to mine for a bit of added top heat. I wasn't looking for a Southwest flavor in these and fortunately, the salsa just adds the tomato and onion flavor. Thank you for a great recipe!

Really quick and delicious. This was perfect for a hot evening since it's one pan and cooks quickly. I don't really like dijon mustard but I wanted to be true to the recipe so I added it. You can't detect it specifically and it probably did add to the overall taste so I am glad I put it in. I did add onion powder and garlic powder but it probably didn't need it so don't sweat it if you don't have any. Make it as written and enjoy! UPDATE: I now have custody of my 6 and 7 year old granddaughters. I was afraid these might be too spicy or tangy for them. I don't find them too spicy or tangy but I fixed them without the hot pepper and held my breath and my girls LOVED them! Fix them, serve them, enjoy them. This recipe is a winner.

I really like the addition of chunky salsa in this recipe, instead of regular tomato sauce. I used thick and chunky hot salsa, it was great. I served it on homemade rolls, and with crisp potato wedges on the side. The entire family loved this one, even our picky 2 year old. Thanks!!

I truly enjoyed this recipe.  I was afraid the salsa might make it taste too "southwest" but it was just right... and I didn't have to add onions as I do on the recipe I usually use.  It's tangy and sweet as sloppy joes are supposed to be. This one is a keeper.

Wow.  Seriously.  This is THE only sloppy joe recipe I have ever liked.  EVER.  My picky husband even said they were REALLY REALLY good.  Amazing!  I did add some onion and hamburger seasoning to adjust for our tastes a bit, but it was only a bit!

For those who said it was too "ketchup-y"... did you let it simmer for the full 20-30 minutes? At first it does taste like ketchup, but after simmering for a while the flavors blend really well.  My kids loved this!

This stuff is fantastic!  I'll never get the canned mix again.  The salsa is a great addition and really lets you control the spiciness.  We love spicy, so hot salsa and a little extra hot sauce made this delicious for us.

These were the absolute best sloppy joes we have ever had! Most are too sweet for my husband's liking, but these were perfect.  What a great idea to add salsa! I didn't add hot sauce since my salsa was of medium heat. I used large hamburger buns, browned under broiler, and topped with shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Thanks so much for great recipe!

Excellent...the best sloppy joe recipe I have tried here yet. I did add some diced grreen pepper and onion. I also used spicy brown mustard cause my dijon went bad! Added a little liquid smoke and shredded cheddar on top as suggested by tat2whttrsh. Served on toasted rolls with homemade slaw and corn on the cob. Hubby loved these joes! Nice and saucy but not too saucy. Perfect balance of sweet and tangy. Will make again...and soooo easy! Thanks!

These sloppy joes were good, but EXTREMELY RICH TASTING!! That is why I'm giving this recipe only 4 stars. The amount of ketchup added was a bit much, and it overpowdered the taste of the sloppy joes, and I only added 1-1/4 cups of the ketchup. Also, a word of warning, if you don't like your sloppy joes too 
'hot' & spicy, I'd reduce the amount of the hot sauce,
as I thought the 1 teaspoon gave the sloppy joes alot of heat. The next time I decide to make these sloppy joes, I'm going to just use 1 cup of the ketchup, 1-1/4 cups of a mild salsa, and add 1/2 a teaspoon of the hot sauce. Also, I wanted to mention, I did simmer the sloppy joes for 25 minutes, to help reduce the liquid, and I did add some diced onion when cooking the meat. I can't imagine having bbq's or sloppy joes with out any onion.

I love this recipe! I wanted to make homemade sloppy joes and this was the first recipe I came to. I am glad I did. It is easy and taste great!  I added green peppers and onions to my meet as it was cooking but followed the recipe otherwise. I will never buy canned sloppy joe mix again!

Oh, this is so much better than anything you can dump out of a can.  It has just the right balance of flavors without being too tomato-y or too vinegary or too sweet.   I couldn't resist adding a spoonful of Memphis Magic Dust (look it up) but it didn't really need it.  Thanks, it's a keeper.

This is one of the better Sloppy Joe's recipes on AR. Nice appearance, texture and proportions. I can see I'm in the minority with my 3 *rating but the brown sugar made it overly sweet. There is quite a lot of sugar in Ketchup to begin with. I will try again, adjusting the sugar amount. Thanks for posting LV, it was a nice week day dinner idea.

I left out almost all of the ketchup, because it was looking too wet. I guess I put in maybe 1/4 c. only of the ketchup. It was pretty good, but if I'd put in the entire cup and a half, I don't think this recipe would have gotten 4 stars out of me. The fault probably lies with my salsa, it's a very juicy kind, so I'll just have to keep that in mind in the future!

Absolutely delicious made just as written.  I have adapted this same recipe using stew meat in the crock pot and then shredded the beef for sandwiches for my husband's lunch, thanks for sharing!  Will never go back to packaged Joes again!

My husband followed the recipe exact.  This was really good my first sandwich. The second one tasted a bit too sweet for my liking.  Not a bad recipe though.  My kids really liked it. Was glad it could be made with things we had on hand.  Thank you for sharing.

This is perfect as written. I did not add the hot sauce since I have a 2 yr old. I do think I grabbed hot salsa in the end though. I have finally found a sloppy joe recipe I love. Will definately make this again!! Everyone loved it. Oh, I did add onions and fresh garlic to the hamburger as it was browning.

Sooo tasty. A tiny bit on the sweet side for me so I might use less ketchup next time. I added French's fried onions on top and it was a big hit. YUM!

I just made this tonight (12/9/10) and it is absolutely amazing! I had to change the cup and a half of ketchup to 1 cup and then I did a 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce because I ran out of ketchup.  Other than that I prepared it exactly as specified.  It's a little sweet, has a very nice tang, and is the best joe's I've ever had!  Next time I will try it exactly as it says and I'm sure I won't be disappointed! =D

I've made this several times in the residential treatment facility I work in. Everybody really enjoys it and I usually double it. The first time I made it I thought the ketchup taste was to strong. When I made it again I decreased the ketchup and also the Dijon mustard. We were out of Worcestershire so I used some steak sauce. We really enjoyed it the second time. I'm sure I'll be using this recipe again!

This sloppy joe sauce tasted great!  I did modify a bit, only because I had to use what was in my pantry...we were a bit short on ketchup - used maybe 3/4C, substituted in balsamic for the white vinegar, and left out the hot sauce.  The sauce had a nice tangy flavor. Thanks for sharing!  My family enjoyed this a lot.

Excellent!!  I made this as written, except I added a little butter and garlic to the hamburger while it was browning, and just a splash of liquid smoke. It was very, very good. My husband loved this and thinks it would be the perfect football food. The best sloppy joes ever!

This is the first time I've made sloppy joes!!  Very impressed, and my kids even liked it.  I didn't use quite as much salsa, and no hot sauce.  Less brown sugar since I used less salsa and honey mustard instead of dijon; not the same I know, but it was what I had.  VERY GOOD!

I've been using this recipe as the starting point for (vegetarian) homemade sloppy joe's for years now. Making this recipe vegetarian is easy, cuts out most of the fat, and no one has ever been able to tell it's vegetarian until I tell them. Also, not having to brown the ground beef cuts out a step; I make this recipe in about 20 minutes including prep.

Changes I make: sauté 1/2 of a chopped onion (any kind will do) using non-stick spray, add 1 chopped bell pepper (any color will do), replace 1 pound ground beef with 1 package of meatless meat, skip the Worcestershire sauce (to keep it vegetarian), and use whatever type of vinegar I feel like using that day (usually cider or white balsamic). Everything else stays roughly the same. Roughly because I don't actually measure anything when making this. I eyeball the amounts listed, mix it all up, taste it, add more of whatever needs to be added. It's great on onion buns, Kaiser rolls, or whole wheat buns as well.

Overall, this was a good recipe as written.  However, the only thing I didn't like was there was too much dijon mustard, so next time I will half the mustard.

I made this for a gathering, and am making it again today for another! Everybody loves these. I don't prefer the taste of too much ketchup so I just add a little less, but I think the addition of salsa is what makes this recipe so outstanding.

Tried this recipe and all I could taste was the ketchup.
I wanted to try again, adding an onion and garlic and using more salsa as opposed to ketchup, but hubby said "no way". Thanks for sharing.

What a fun and delicious Friday night supper! Super easy to prepare and extremely tasty. The only thing I will change the next time I prepare this is to omit the hot sauce...it was just a bit too spicy for the kiddos. I also like the idea of using ground turkey or chicken and perhaps adding some chopped onion to the browning meat. This recipe is a definate make again!!

Oh WOW! Spicy hot tangy sweet rich tomatoey YUM. These are sooooo good. I used ranchero salsa and louisiana hot sauce. I added 1 more spoon of sugar to balance the heat. I did add a tsp of minced garlic to the meat as it cooked and about half tsp of chicken bouillion granules and 1/3 c water. I had to simmer this though for an hour to get it thickened. Edible but a bit on the hot side the way I made them maybe louisiana hot cayennepepper sauce isn't the type meant here? Either way, they are delicious!!!

This was delicious!  Easy and great tasting! Mind blowing on how quick this was.  I did follow advice and sautéed onions prior to beef, and added a bit less ketchup (1cup). The secret is the chunky salsa, we used mild. Thank you for sharing recipe.

It was good only thing I changed was the ketchup it was too much and cut the mustard down to a spoon and a half.. And I use Kings Hawaiian hamburger buns lightly toasted it was good.

I followed the recipe exactly. I have tried a lot of sloppy joes recipes and this is by far the best. It is also very easy to make and I always have all the ingredients on hand.

I'm surprised by all the 5 star reviews... I used 1/2 the amount of ketchup and vinegar and still found this way too acidic to eat.

Whenever I make a new recipe the family rates them as keepers or tosses. 4 out of 5 of them said good choice keep it. I did make a few small changes I added minced garlic and onion.  Used ground turkey and omitted the hot sauce I'm not fond of spicy food.  I also only used 1 cup of ketcup.  It was a little watery but I just kept cooking till it thickened and I enjoyed it. 
Most of all it was EASY.

The only helpful hint I could provide is use 2 lbs. of meat instead of one. There is too much sauce for the amount of meat suggested.

My family and I adored this. No more canned sauce for us! I did have to use about twice the amount of ground beef as the recipe seems to make quite a bit of sauce. I quickly discovered that I didn't have the white vinegar, dijon mustard or brown sugar so I used rice vinegar, spicy brown mustard, and plain white sugar. I did mix all of the ingredients for the sauce together beforehand, let them marry while I was browning the beef, then added it as directed. I sprinkled salt and chili powder onto the meat as it cooked, and added minced garlic and a few spices to balance the flavors to my family's taste. Love on a bun!

My husband loved this.  It's a little tangy and has a full rich taste.  I subbed barbecue sauce for half the ketchup and added a diced onion to the hamburger.

Oh this stuff kicks!  I haven't made sloppy joes in YEARS as I can't stand the packaged/canned stuff - but these rocked.  I did saute a bit of onion first and left out the brown sugar - other than that, followed recipe.  At firt I thought it would still be too sweet, but the addition of the hot sauce took care of that.  Thanks so much!

Made this for a crowd and everyone loved it! I'll never buy the can stuff or the season package again! I didn't add the hot sauce and it still had a tang to it, probably from the hot salsa I used. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!! I did use half ketchup and half BBQ sauce like other reviewers suggested as well as adding garlic!

Made this tonight, it's a keeper for sure! I didn't have the Worcestershire sauce, and I think it was great without it. I did use my homemade salsa though, so I don't know how that may have affected the outcome. But thank you for sharing this! Awesome!

Let's just say that after making this I will no longer buy any sloppy joe mix out of a can!  I took tat's suggestions of adding some garlic and a couple of dashes of liquid smoke.  I also toasted my kaiser rolls.  So so good.  like I said - no more canned joes for my crew!  I love how I'll be able to mess with this in the future by varying the kind of salsa I use.  This time I used a super chunky medium, which was great.  Next time my husband and I agreed to try a black bean and corn type for something a little different.  Can't wait - this was delish!

Good sloppy joes! Made these for my fiance and I tonight. Nothing beats good 'ol sloppy sandwiches for SuperBowl game watching!!! My fiance was on the fence about these, but mind you, he doesn't care for "sloppy" stuff (who knew?). I would have thought sloppy joes are the "ideal" man food, but I guess that's not the case for EVERY man lol.... Having said this, although I like LV's version, I prefer mine a little better.... My version calls for a lb. of ground beef, 1 1/3 c. chunky salsa, a can of condensed tomato soup and a T of brown sugar - that's all. It's pretty basic, and that's what I like about it. Both taste similar, but these are a tad tangier (which I don't like). I really don't see the point in adding vinegar, mustard or hot sauce since they barely added anything to the end product (again, these taste a lot like my basic recipe). Oh, and be sure to use chunky salsa, not the soupy cheap stuff. It really makes a difference (and will make your joes a lot sloppier if you don't). Serving these on toasted kaiser rolls (brush cut rolls with a mixture of melted butter / garlic powder and broil for a minute or two), took these to the next level, IMHO. With the addition of a side of seasoned waffle fries, I had dinner on the table in no time flat (and more time to watch the game!!!). Thanks for sharing! :-)

As far as Sloppy Joes goes, this was fantastic! I did use less ketchup and added a little chili sauce, and I also didn't have any hot sauce so I added a few dashes of red pepper flakes. Sweet, tangy, and a bit spicy-best Sloppy Joes I've ever had!

These were good- the salsa gave them a nice tang and made them a little different. Hubby loved them and thought they were the best I've made yet- I personally think I prefer the sloppy joes II from this site. However, I will likely make again. Thanks for sharing!

Very good stuff. I made these over the weekend and put them in the freezer to eat and it worked just great. I used a homemade salsa and toasted my buns so they wouldn't get so soggy. Looking forward to eating the leftovers at work tomorrow.

I loved these! I bought a Medium salsa that was actually rather hot so I should have left the hot sauce out. It was too hot for the kids. I left out the brown sugar because hubby is a diabetic. I only used 1 cup of ketchup. Good stuff!

This is def the best sloppy joe recipe I've tried from AR! The flavor was very different w/the addition of the salsa, however, still just a tad  too "ketchupy" & sweet for me. I wish you could give 1/2 stars, this deserves a 4.5!

This just took the place of another home made Sloppy Joe recipe I've had for many years. Very good. I added onions and green peppers and used less ketchup (I doubled the recipe and didn't have enough) but it worked out great.

This recipes is insanely good. This is a departure from the regular sweet Sloppy Joe mix. I think the most important ingredient is the salsa, so make sure you buy an extra chunky salsa with a flavor you love. Mine had roasted corn and black beans inside and it made our sandwiches delicious. Thank you so much for such a great recipe.

I made this last night and followed the recipe. I was dubious of the salsa but it was a very nice addition offering interest to the otherwise ordinary Sloppy Joe. It had a nice rich flavorful taste.

Followed the recipe. A little sweet for my taste. Maybe cut back on the ketchup next time.

I omitted the vinegar because my ketchup was already very tangy. I added a teaspoon of McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning to the hamburger while browning. I used just under 2 pounds of hamburger and it was still plenty saucy. I didn't have buns, so I served the meat mixture over oven-baked french fries and sprinkled with cheddar cheese. Delicious!

My fam thought it was too sweet, but my mom said she really liked it considering how much she doesn't like the canned kind. I used Pace hot chunky salsa, yellow mustard because I did not have dijon mustard, tapatio for the hot sauce, and I added onion to it. On my personal sand which I also added more fresh onion, pickled jalapenos, toasted Italian bread since we didn't have rolls or buns and sharp cheddar cheese.  I think I would add less ketchup and brown sugar, maybe half if I made it again. Especially since the salsa I used was more watery. I'd like to try with pico instead of salsa and garlic.

Nothing wrong with this recipe . I think this recipe is just what people are looking for when they want Sloppy Joe's.  I love the addition of salsa.  For me it was too sweet, too tart.  I added about 3cups of water and let it cook down to thicken.

As with many of the other reviews, the ketchup was too overpowering for the dish. However I decided to continue with the original recipe to form a complete opinion.  I agree on using the ketchup sparingly and add some tomato paste for the flavor. Add ketchup to taste.

Fabulous and easy. I added some extra onion, omitted tabasco because I used spicy salsa and cut back on ketchup, salsa & vinegar because I didn't want it quite so saucy. It was really, really good.

This was outstanding!!!   I did make some adjustments after reading several reviews, and I'm glad I did!!   So if anyone plans to make this for the very first time it is advised to read the reviews.  I used 2 lbs of ground beef instead of just one. I cut the ketchup way down to only a fourth of a cup as many reviewers thought that 1.5 cups made it too sweet.  I left the salsa at one cup,  I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar, (so a total of 3 tablespoons), I omitted the white vinegar, and I'm glad I did! Also after reading a few reviews I did add some diced onion and pressed garlic  when browning the ground beef.  It added a little extra flavor.  That being said, it was probably one of the best sloppy joes I've ever had!! Will never go back to the canned Manwich sauce again!!

Made these as a request from my 12 yo on his birthday-he ate 2! Served on poptato rolls with a slice of cheese. Just did a dash of vinegar and added half a large onion before adding the beef. Yummy treat!

This was a really tasty recipe.  It only got better the next few days when my husband and I enjoyed the leftovers.  The only change I made was using 1 cup of ketchup (all I had at the time) and 1/2 cup of Sweet Baby Ray’s barbecue sauce.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These turned out pretty good. I liked the flavor that the salsa gave to the sloppy joes, and the added onion and pepper without having to chop up all the vegetables. A simple dinner for a busy weeknight!

Decided to try these on a whim even though I normally don't consider myself much of a sloppy joe fan...and I may have to change that assessment, because these were seriously AMAZING! Used jalapeno ketchup as well which gave it a little extra kick I really liked, but made it a bit too spicy for my husband, so next time I'll stick to the regular stuff.

Tasted too much ketchup and I only used a cup instead of 1-1/2 c.  like the recipe says. Had I used all of it, I think it would have been like eating ketchup on a bun. Ended up throwing most of it away since my kids and I couldn’t stomach a full serving.

I followed the suggestions from others. I too, thought that was too much catsup, especially not being a fan of catsup, so I  did half chili sauce. I definitely upped the amount of meat to 2 LBS. Next time I will only add 1 TBL of brown sugar. I  like spice so I upped the hot sauce to 3 tsp. I love the flavor liquid smokes so I added 2 tsp. of it. (as suggested) Another suggestion was white wine vinegar, I already had some in my pantry so I used it instead of plain vinegar. (I wouldn't go out and buy it though, use what is on hand!) I wanted to keep the recipe simple so I did not sautee onions or peppers, I think there is enough in the chunky salsa. I appreciate the basic concept of Ruby's recipe and I am glad it was shared. I loved the idea of the potato rolls/buns. I had never tried them before and they are very good!!

I didn’t have the amount of ketchup so I put in barbecue sauce and no brown sugar and it actually worked pretty good! Also if you like it more spicy double the hot sauce. But the recipe by itself was really good!

I use to think that one cannot screw up sloppy joes, but this recipe proved me wrong.  My husband and I both thought it would be great if the salsa had not been added. It gave it a foreign taste and made it way too thin.

It was very good. Too saucy for my liking but I just boiled off the liquid. I reduced the vinegar and it was still to strong but that could be because I used Tabasco as hot sauce. Will make again

It has good flavor, but far too much sauce for the amount of hamburger. I'll make it again, but cut the sauce in half.

This turned out pretty well. Watch the spice though! I used hot salsa along with the hot sauce, and it turned out a little to spicy for some.

Way to salty between the ketchup, salsa, worcester sauce, and more.  My family did not like the strong flavor of the sauce.  Would prefer to add my own seasonings to tomato sauce.  Will not be making it again

I made this a couple of nights ago as written except used LESS ketchup (1 cup) and LESS brown sugar and it was still to sweet for hubs and I.  And I do like my food sweet but he does not. We each had 1 sloppy joe and the rest I had to toss. I think I would make it again and just not use ANY brown sugar as it gets plenty of sweetness from the ketchup alone.

Exceptional base recipe. My girl friend and I did doctor it a little with ghost pepper and my home made hot sauce for me, but kept a separate amount for the rest of the family and it went over big. Well worth doing.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  The flavor was really good but it was a bit too "saucy" for my taste.  I prefer my sloppy joe to be more thick.  I would make it again, but probably reduce the ketchup and salsa by about 25%.

We both liked this very much. I never had it as a kid - my OH had the kind that came from a mix. I cooked the ground beef (and some onions) at lunch time and put it and everything else in the crockpot, alternating between Low and Keep Warm. Because I was using the crockpot, I reduced the ketchup to 1 C (also 1.5 C of ketchup seemed like an awful lot.) Because I reduced the ketchup, I also reduced the vinegar to 1 T. (And used ACV because I prefer that for this sort of dish.) Will make again.

Again I leave out the sugar for the recipe. The salsa gives the sloppy Joes a bit of south of the border taste.

This was amazing! I have a 14 yr old who doesn’t like veggies! Soooo, I put salsa, ketchup, onion, bell pepper into my ninja! Added the remaining ingredients and he never knew it was packed full of delicious veggies! Lol so much better than the canned stuff! Definitely will make again, probably try ground turkey for healthy version...

I didn’t have any salsa, so I substituted a can of Rotel and it was delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this recipe for sloppy joes.  It has a lot of auger which is why it’s so good.  I cut back on the catsup and brown auger and it was still great!

Way too much vinegar.   Ketchup and mustard both have vinegar in them.  Adding additional vinegar to this recipe makes it ridiculously tangy.  My family didn’t care for this at all.

Very tasty! You MUST cook for the full 20 mins...I tried to taste test about 10 mins in and hated it lol, I let cook for the last 10-15 mins and it was delicious once all the flavors absorbed. Delicious!

This is our favorite sloppy Joe recipe. I used to get the spicy Manwich sauce but they don't make it anymore.  This is even better. We use medium Pace with it.  It's delicious!!

Followed the recipe just as it was listed. A little too sweet for our taste, so I believe next time we will cut the brown sugar by half. Very simple recipe. We will make it again.

I've made this dozens of time and it's great!  Beats the canned stuff by a mile, and it's easy to modify for a different flavor profile, or to double to feed a big crowd.  If you have leftovers it makes great spaghetti sauce too!

Instead of Dijon mustard I used regular mustard and as for the hot sauce I used buffalo wing sauce. I used what I had. We are a family of five, two teenagers and a 10yr old. My 10yr old loved it and rated it as high as a five. The rest of us thought it had too much ketchup. I served them on Kaiser rolls with a side of fries.

These were pretty good! Sweet and tangy. I used mild salsa, and I did take the advice of other reviewers and reduced the ketchup to one cup and halved the amount of vinegar. Also left out the hot sauce as I can't eat anything really spicy. Other than that, I left everything the same. Will definitely be making again. So much better than manwich (which I do like).

Great recipe.  Omitted the vinegar altogether, as the ketchup, salsa and mustard all have vinegar in them.  We used to use tomato soup, canned, but the salsa livens up the taste buds and cuts down on the salt.  Thanks, this is super!

I made these for some friends. They said they were the best they'd ever had, and asked for the recipe. 
I used balsamic vinegar and peach salsa, and omitted the hot sauce. I served this with deviled eggs.
It is imperative that you simmer this until it gets thick. This allows for the flavors to blend properly, as well as attain the appropriate texture.

I've now made this recipe several times and have found it to be very enjoyable. It is easy, can be prepared rapidly, and it tastes great. Those who are extremely sensitive to spice may find this to be a bit on the hot side, but I enjoy it.

They are even better served on toasted garlic bread.

Easy and tasty. a little saucy for my family, but otherwise perfect.

I used 1pound of cooked chopped turkey leftovers and simmered a little longer to try and reduce the sauce a bit.

My 13 year old son surprised me by making these for dinner!  They were delicious!  He used a little less mustard and a little extra hot sauce.  He also added some onion powder to the ground beef.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

I tried this recipe because I was out of the canned stuff and saw some good reviews.  WOW am I glad I was out of sauce.  This was perfect and easy!  I'm sure it was healthier too.  I agree with another reviewer who suggested cooking it at least 20 minutes...not too saucy or tomato tasting.  Good luck and enjoy :)

Way to much ketchup.  If you ever decide to make this I would highly encourage you to only used about half the ketchup the recipe calls for.

Loved this and so did my husband.  It is a new twist on Sloppy Joes.  the salsa gives it a little kick and adds flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

When I read this recipe I thought oh no too much ketchup.  But, I made it exactly as written, and I thought it was wonderful.  My husband was ecstatic; absolutely loved these.  Will be making them often throughout the fall and winter!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used slightly less ketchup and I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. This was one of the best sloppy joes I've ever had in my life. I'm pretty sure this is how I will be making them from now on.

This is hands down the best sloppy joe recipe around.  I will never make sloppy joe any other way.  The addition of salsa and ketchup makes it simple to throw together yet you would never guess they are in there.  Whenever I make this it is gone in no time with requests for more, more, more!

I have to give it 5 stars.  My husband thought it was a bit too spicy - but - that's a personal preference.   I will leave out the hot sauce the next time.    I used a mild salsa.   My suggestion would be that if you use hot salsa - leave out the hot sauce.     He ate all of it in two sittings.   I didn't get a chance to have any - frown.   But - next time I will.

Love, Love, Love this!!! I used Pace med. salsa and 1.25 lbs of ground turkey. Added just a tad more salsa and ketchup because of the increase of meat but other then that, I followed as listed and it turned out great. It had a very nice kick to it.

These were really good and easy to make. I used ground turkey instead of beef just to make it healthier. I also added garlic, onion, BBQ sauce and liquid smoke, as other reviewers suggested. It was great. My husband loved it. We will make these again.

FANTASTIC!!!  I used ground turkey and only 1 c ketchup because I ran out.  I'm glad I did though, another 1/2 cup would have been too much ketchup for our taste.  Thanks for sharing, this is my new go-to joe recipe.

I gave it four stars because it turned out VERY salty.  The ketchup, Worcestershire, and mustard contain a lot of salt.  I think the brands I used had extra.  Next time, I will use a canned tomato sauce instead of ketchup and pay close attention to the sodium content.  Otherwise, great flavor!  The hot sauce and salsa add a nice zing to it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! My 18-year-old son made these for dinner. I added this to our family favorites. Thanks for sharing! UPDATE: I sauteed onion and red pepper with the ground beef. Drained off grease before adding remaining ingredients. So yummy!

I tripled this recipe.  There was a lot of extra sauce so I added 1 chopped green pepper, 1 chopped yellow onion, and 1.5 pounds more meat.  Shredded cheddar was a lovely addition.  Toasting the rolls is a must!

Delicious! I added half a small onion and 2 cloves garlic, and used 2/3 cup ketchup and 1/3 cup BBQ sauce. Next time I'll do half ketchup and half chili sauce and maybe cut the brown sugar for something a little less sweet. I'm thinking about using the leftovers in the Barbecue Beef Biscuits from this site. Thanks for a great recipe!

This meal was great.  My husband isn't usually a fan of sloppy joe's but he said this was the best sloppy joe he had ever eaten!  It did seem like there was too much sauce so I only only used about 3/4 of it.  Overall great recipe!!

Had this for dinner tonight with my 5 and 6 year old boys. Very easy, FAST and we all loved it. I made the recipe as-is. I probably had more than a pound of GB since I had some in the fridge to use up, and it was plenty saucy. Note to parents with picky eaters: my 6 year old excavated his sandwich with a fork for the "chunky pieces", next time I think I'll pick picante sauce and use half as much ketchup! definitely toast the buns.

We thought this version of sloppy joes was good, but I found it to taste like the popular canned version.  I will stick with our favorite recipe on here for sloppy joes.

This recipe is delicious. I used turkey sausage links - removed the casings and ground up with onion & garlic.  I added all the ingredients in the amounts recommended except the ketchup which I just eyeballed.  Sweet & tangy with just a hint of heat from the hot sauce.  This will be a go-to recipe from now on.

Easy to make and my family liked them fairly well. My older daughter thought they were a little too sweet. I only used 1/2 a cup of ketchup and that was plenty. Thanks!
