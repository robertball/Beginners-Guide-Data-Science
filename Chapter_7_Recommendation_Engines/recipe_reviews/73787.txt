I whipped this up for lunch today and everyone loved it!  To make sure the bacon was cooked, I precooked it to the soft stage (it also cuts down on flareups from the grease).  Cajun seasoning can be incredibly salty so use the no salt or low-salt version instead if you can find it.  I will be making these again.  Next time, I'll serve them over rice or pasta.

I was so excited about this recipe!! Had 50 large prawns all done up properly with bacon just partially cooked (To cut down on flare-ups on BBQ and time ) and DARN it if I didn't have nothing but problems with the wrapping of the bacon.  It would not hold the jalapeno in at all, they fell out during BBq'ing.  I ended up with throwing out about 20 prawns, which is expensive for me.  Nobody wants to reheat them and have them overcooked!!  I probably did something wrong, it really annoys me because I hate to give bad reviews, but this just didn't do anything for our family!! Sorry.

I forgot to add the cheese to this dish I was so excited about the shrimp.  I made it with large prawns for a dinner with hubby....INCREDIBLE.  Then I made if for my sister's B-Day and she could not get enough.  I unfortunately made other food.  She could have dined on just the shrimp.  VERY GOOD.

I prepared these as though I would grill them (even placing them on skewers in individual foil), but instead I cooked them in the oven.  I also dropped honey teriyaki sauce in each one prior to placing in the oven and they tasted so good!  I did have to fry the bacon a bit prior to wrapping them to make it easier to wrap them, and after that it was easy as pie.  No longer will I have to purchase these in a restaurant @$35.00 for 6.

WOW,  What a great flavor!!  I did not have Jack cheese, so I just melted some cheddar on top.  These will be fabulous as appetizers if I can keep myself from eating them before serving them!!!!

Delicious!  I found that it was easier to wrap the shrimp using raw bacon.  To be sure the bacon cooked nicely I alternately raised and lowered the lid on my propane grill to maintain a small flame.  I used a small sliver of cheese inside, then topped the shrimp with a little more at the end.

I was very excited to try this recipe, but was quite disappointed with the way it turned out.  It was way too salty.  I may try it again without the cajun mix.

Delicious! I had a bit of a heavy hand with the seasoning so mine were really spicy, but they were still amazing. I used double skewers so I had to thread mine differently. I also used a half slice of bacon around each shrimp due to their size and the type of bacon I was using. I will make these again!

Great, but not very spicy and definitely not enough to be the main course.  Very tasty, though!

I love this appetizer! However, I make a ton of these as huge dinner portion for myself ;). This has tons of flavor, a bit spicy- which I like. I have made this many times, but found that baking the bacon a little bit before wrapping them around the shrimp works best for me. I've had times where I wrapped the bacon on the raw shrimp and the shrimp is overcooked due to me trying to cook the bacon thoroughly. Baking the bacon a little bit first allows the shrimp to be cooked perfectly and the bacon cooked through fully. I used to order this exact dish at a restaurant in Texas all, so I am glad I found this recipe to make at home now that I'm miles away!

I just made these and they taste pretty good but not good enough to warrant the problems I had making them! I followed the recipe and cut the bacon in thirds and they were just too short which caused real problems with the wrapping. The jalapeno didn't want to stay in either! Just too much hassle for this home cook!!!

I've made these a bunch of times because they're very popular at Tex-Mex restaurants and my husband loves them!  I use pepper jack cheese and the spices traditionally used in Texas are chili and paprika. They don't need any added salt because the bacon and cheese have plenty. They can be difficult to do, but once you've done it a few times it's pretty easy. I use toothpicks and cook them individually on the stovetop p instead of grilling.

We make this all the time as an appetizer and late night snack. Sometimes we use pepper jack cheese.

It's difficult to wrap the shrimp the first few you make, but the more you do, the better you get! Stick with it and you'll get an amazing dish that the 6 people we fed tonight were in love with!

I love this recipe, it is a grill favorite at our house. I only make two small changes - I grill the shrimp whole with the tails on and brush them with melted butter or ghee. Delicious! 5 stars and thank you for sharing!

I won't make this again, much too finicky for me to make and it was good but not enough to out-weigh the work.

Essentially using two ingredients I always keep on hand: Bacon and Shrimp, I call put together a filling meal without having to run to the store. Tasty for a treat but easy to make meal size.
