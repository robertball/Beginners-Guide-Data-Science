My family absolutely loved this BBQ sauce! It was so simple yet the flavors were quite complex. I did go easy on the cayenne and pepper since we are wimpy when it comes to spiciness, but otherwise I didn't change a thing because it's perfect.  Thank you Don for sharing your wonderful recipes!  Cheers!

I have been making this recipe for over a year and it has become our favorite. I normally say that I don't like much sweetness in my sauces so I was skeptical about the amount of sugar and honey. However, this just tasted great. Very flavorful and I would say complex, though I may be misusing the term. I used 2 small roasted serrano peppers the first time and that was a nice amount of heat without going too far over the edge. Since then I have made it with the red chile that I have available and it was hotter than the serranos. I'm not sure what kind they are, but it's now what I buy. We had a sauce "tasting" and this one was the winner. We had it on country style ribs and have enough left to try on some other things. Now we use it on everything, including bbq sandwiches. The heat builds quite a bit on a sandwich, but we like that. Thanks, Don!

This sauce made an excellent partner for the BBQ ribs we had.  I enjoyed following this recipe word for word with the exception of omitting the red chili pepper.  Next time I will make sure I have all the ingredients on hand.  Don knows what he's doing..this was delightful.  Look out shrimp…you're next!

Made this for recipe group.  This is a very very good BBQ sauce, and easy to make.  I loved the combination of flavors.  I had to make 2 substitutions based on what I had on hand.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and I'm sure if I'd had the proper ingredients I'd still have rated it 5 stars.  I used yellow/brown onion instead of red, and red pepper flakes instead of the chili pepper.  I used 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and it had a nice amount of heat without overwhelming the other flavors.  My family could have had it a lot hotter, but I wasn't looking for a fiery BBQ sauce this time.  I used it instead of Buffalo sauce on some baked wings.  We all liked it, and I'm sure I'll make it again.  It makes a nice thick sauce that would be good for dipping.

This is a creamy and flavourful sauce. I made a mini batch to use on baked chicken wings. The next day I used it on a bacon burger and it was even better. It's a perfect blend of spice and tang with a hint of sweet. Thanks Don for sharing this recipe!

This was a bright, light, delicious sauce.  I used on BBQ ribs and they were wonderful.  I didn't have fresh chili, so I used garlic chili sauce (Hoy Brand), and just cut down some of the added garlic in the recipe.  A winner and a do-over for sure.  I' thinking this will be great on grilled shrimp.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Don!

This is a delicious sauce. For the first time I added less sugar and honey than the recipe calls for because I am afraid of extra sweetness. But these ingredients work well and give a right sweetness for barbeque sauce. Although I used the sauce over pasta. Definitely will try this sauce exactly for barbeque someday.

This is an excellent and unique recipe as it is completely different from the barbecue sauce I normally prepare. The recipe utilizes ingredients which most households have on hand so there is no need to make a trip to the market. The recipe is written clearly and easy to follow. Congratulations, Don, you have an excellent, five star recipe and I thank you for sharing! This was the Buzz Recipe Group selection for the week of August 1, 2015.

Made this for Recipe Group...This is the BEST sauce that I have ever made or eaten! I made this the day before and stored it in the fridge until I was ready to use it. I did omit the red chili pepper because I didn't have one, but that was my only change. My mom tasted it and is going crazy...she said I'm in charge of making the barbecue sauce from now on, Thanks, Don, lol. Seriously, this sauce is fantastic and I can't wait to try it on...everything! This will be my go-to sauce from now on~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Recipe Group: Super yummy sauce! I subbed white wine vinegar for the red and jalapeño for the red chili. I do not have an immersion blender so left it as is; I like chunky sauce :) Poured this over some chicken tenderloins and convect baked until juicy and delicious! Don you have another winner here, thanks for sharing!

This is amazing! I finely grated the onion, garlic and pepper and it was perfect.
