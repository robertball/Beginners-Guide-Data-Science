When I made this chili I used 3 cans of beans,, 2cups of frozen corn & 2cups of chicken broth instead of the water.  The other thing different I did was let it cook in a crock pot on high for about 6 hrs.  There was not even a drop left that football Sunday!  Success!

I only used one green and one red pepper, black beans instead of kidney, and crushed tomatoes instead of diced due to FC (finicky child), and she still didn't like this soup.  My husband and I LOVED it; the FC knows nothing!  I also substituted chicken broth for the water and added extra corn, and will make it the same way next time.  Minced cilantro is a tasty garnish!

I used a combination of red, orange and yellow organic peppers and I threw in a bunch of fresh minced garlic and three coarsely chopped zucchini in with the chopped veggies/chicken. Instead of kidney beans, I used organic black beans because that's what I had on hand. I used organic chicken broth instead of water to add a little more flavor and after tasting it, I added in onion powder, ground coriander, oregano, paprika, and a little Splenda brown sugar blend and threw in a bit more cumin and chili powder. This soup is very tasty. I highly recommend using all organic ingredients if you can and really adding the extra spices.

This is a good recipe.  For a quick meal I used ground chicken and chicken broth instead of water. It is now on our list of regular meals, and it carries well for lunch the next day.

I followed other's suggestions by replacing the kidney beans with black beans (only 3 cans) and replacing water with chicken broth. I also added 50% extra chili powder, real minced (sauteed) garlic instead of garlic powder, and omitted the parsley.

It turned out great, but it gets better with age (a crock pot would probably yield the best results).

I scaled the recipe in half, and my husband and I still made 2 meals of it. I didn't modify anything else, and it was very delicious.

Quick to prepare and good tasting. My husband said it had the perfect blend of seasonings. I added seasoning salt, fresh ground black pepper and used frozen diced onions, green peppers and a Fiesta blend bag of veggies that included black beans. Left out the kidney beans. Topped with sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese and tortilla chips.

Flavorful chili with low fat!  Tasted great and wasn't too spicy.  I'll make it again.  Made with a side of cornbread for a hearty meal on a cold day.

I was not at all impressed with this chili.  To me it tasted like it was definitely missing something, and I could not figure out what it was.  This soup was watery and the chicken didn't soak up the flavor well at all.  It was extremely bland.  I eventually added some hot sauce, oregano, and cheese, which seemed to help some.  I won't be making this again.

In all honesty, I think the recipe could have been better or more seasoned in spite of the cumin and cayenne papper ( I was going to give it 4 stars), but my husband and older son had doubles so that is not an achievement- it's a MIRACLE! I used ground chicken, and used organic tomatoes instead of canned crushed tomatoes. Also added fresh cilantro. I added some salt and a whole packet of "Sazon Goya with cilantro and achiote/annato" (International spanish/hispanic section at the grocery store). I served it with white rice and plantains. It was very hearty, natural-tasting, delicious and healthy! Thanks for the recipe! Will definitely repeat.

Very good soup.  I used three cans of kidney beans, 2 cups of corn and I used rotel tomatoes in place of the diced tomatoes and three in a seeded, chopped jalapeno.  I like the calorie content as well

I used the extra corn, less water, and crushed tomatoes instead of diced. I also added extra herbs and spices, chilli flakes, cilantro, oregano and basil. My husband loved it served on rice.

I was a little surprised at how good this soup was!  A bit more red pepper taste than I expected, but it really worked wonderfully with the chicken.  My children loved it too!  I served with a little sour cream and some cheddar, while I ate it as is to save some calories.

I thought this recipe was great. I made just a few minor changes.  I used 2 pounds of diced chicken, a 10 ounce package of frozen corn, the diced tomatoes with garlic & onion, and 2 cups light chicken broth instead of water.  My family liked it so well that I doubled the recipe and took it to soup and salad day at my job.

I actually made this exactly as written with 2 substitutions- I used 1 can beef broth and 1 can of chicken broth instead of the water and I used 1 1/2 pounds very lean ground beef (93%) Delicious!!!

This is a great option for traditional ground beef or steak chili receipes. Very easy and since we are a family of three I cut the serving size in half. Still had a full second meal out of it from the freezer a month later. Great flavor and consistency. I did not use kidney beans...instead used one can chili beans, one can black beans and one can pinto beans and all other ingredients for 9 servings. YUMMY

Mine: Poached Chicken Breasts, Yellow onion, 3 jalapenos(seeded), yellow hominy, 1 red bell, 1 small can spicy V8 instead of tomatoes, kidney beans. 2 cans chkn broth (one used in poaching).  Served with blue corn tortilla chips and hunk of cheddar cheese. Great spicy soup!

Made this for a Seniors Luncheon at our church. I also switched out the water for chicken broth, added 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. black pepper and 1/2 tsp. oregano. I was afraid it would be a little too spicy for them, but everyone loved it and many asked for seconds. Will definitely save this recipe and make it again.

I've used this recipe so many times in the last 2 yrs and it always turns out great!  I like to add cilantro and sub one can of black beans for one kidney when I make it with chicken.  Otherwise I do a typical chili with ground beef.  I also don't add the red or green peppers because my hubby doesn't like them in his chili.  As for other comments on the lack of flavor, just add salt, pepper, and a little hot sauce if you like it hot.  The amt of other spices are perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was very tastey! I did change it quite a bit though.
I used chicken stock instead of water and added a tiny little splash of veggie stock. I didn't add any peppers or cummin because I didn't have any. I used a whole can of corn, crushed tomatoes, and added black pepper.
Very very yummy.

I loved how this turned out! I alterted it slightly based on things I had and such and from my experience with seasoning I added the cumin, ginger, chili powder etc... before adding the vegetables...seasoning the chicken and pepper and onions. Added a little seasoning once everything was mixed. Over all I loved how this came out. I also used ground chicken instead of actual chicken pieces. Loved it, can not say enough good things about this. It was perfect for a rainy cold sunday, very easy to prepare. Fabulous!

This chili was awesome! I added a little more of the spice blend and only 3 cans of beans but it turned out great! I let it simmer for 4-5 hours so everything would blend.

This was actually a little on the bland side for me. To be fair, I like my food very seasoned.  I kept adding chili powder but it just wasn't doing it, so I threw in a packet of taco season and it is delicious.

This was so good! I actually used "El Pato" Jalapeno flavored tomato sauce from the Hispanic section of the grocery store instead of diced tomatoes. I also used a bit more cumin in it. It was so delicious. Thanks!

We love this recipe, but make it with a lot of changes.  I cook my chicken on the foreman grill, then shred it and season it for tacos.  I then make the soup like the recipe states, except I use chili beans rather than kidney beans.  I add seasonings (cumin, chili powerd, cayenne, etc) until it has as much spice as we like.  We top ours with onions, diced dill pickles, shredded cheese and sour cream. YUMMY!!

This was pretty tasty although not spiced enough for us.  It did improve over a few days - i took some for lunch on day 3 and it was much improved.  YOu might want to eiher increase the chili spice again or I will try cooking my chicken in spices a la chicken tacos before I add it to the soup.

6/29/10 - update:  yep, we do soup in the summer too!  tweaking this with black beans instead of kidney and upped the corn. omg. my son is addicted!  this freezes nicely as well and goes nicely in the crockpot on low while i am at work.  again, great recipe - a keeper!

This recipe resulted in a delicious, flavorful soup.  I did made few changes to the recipe, though.  I used the produce on hand.  Rather than corn and bell peppers, I added two stalks of chopped celery and two chopped carrots.  I added two cans of beans, rather than four, without their juice.  I used two cans of tomato sauce in place of the bean juice and water.  The spice combination is perfect for our taste.

Very tasty.  I used chicken stock for the base (instead of water), white kidney beans (cannelini)instead of red, and also threw in a couple of fresh diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and added a 4 oz. can of diced green chilis.  Served it over crushed tortilla chips with a dollup of sour cream and a sprinkling of shredded cheddar over the top.  Delish!

This was great and made plenty for at least 2 more meals!  I modified it a bit--left out the peppers, added a can of rotel, and added the can of potatoes as suggested by a previous reviewer.  My kids loved it too!

Very tasty.  Depending on your tastes you might want to add more of each of the spices especially cumin.  Also I would add the spice after the chicken, peppers and onions are cooked.   Cook the spices until fragrant and then add liquid.

This was great, I didn't change a thing. I found this recipe in a hurry for a chili cook off we were having and I forgot about.  Took only about an hour and a half tops to make and I won third place with it!  I made again later on for my husband because he wasn't home the first time I made it and he loved it too.  Freezes well. My new favorite chili recipe:)

This is awesome! And Easy! The hardest thing about making this soup is chopping the peppers and onion. I use canned chicken breast. I think the secret is all the bell pepper and it's so colorful and appetizing!

I liked this, but my instinct told me to up the spices, so I did: I used 3t. chili powder, 2t. garlic powder, and 1t. cumin. Good decision! I also used what I had, including most of a rotisserie chicken; 2 cans of black beans & 2 cans of white kidney beans; and one can of Rotel for one of the cans of diced tomatoes (the other was "chili ready"). I don't care for green bells, so I omitted those. Also! The best substitution I made? Hominy instead of corn; in fact, I wish I had used *two* cans of hominy instead of one.

What a great way to use up leftover ckn. Just dice it up or shred and add at the end.  Also I didn't use tomato sauce or water. I used tomato soup,ckn broth & fire roasted tomatoes.  You could also use 1 can of tomatoes w/ chiles. I also used black beans, rinsed & drained.

I thought this was absolutely delicious!  Having fits because I can't decide if I want to serve with tortilla chips, flour tortillas, or cornbread (grin). I had to use what I had in fridge (clean out day), but the spices are dead on for a soup style dish (note to self: cut tomato sauce in half).  Thanks so much for recipe.  UPDATE: Hubby couldn't wait so we just ate with crackers, topped with raw onions, cheddar cheese, and sour cream.  Heaven - even in the middle of August.

I gave this 5 stars but made some modifications to make it even easier to make. I used canned chicken (rinsed to get rid of the sodium content). I also used 2 bags of frozen southwest corn. It has corn, green and red peppers, onions, and a great southwest seasoning, so I didn't have to add anything but garlic powder, parsley and a bit of pepper. I added all ingredients, then simmered for about 20 minutes. Served with tortilla chips. It was great!!

I halved this recipe (it makes a LOT)! I didn't use as much green & red pepper or chicken as called for (seemed like too much to me), and I added a full can of corn. I also threw in some brown rice I had cooked up. I think the seasoning blend was perfect for my tastes, I really enjoyed this! I threw everything in a crockpot on high for about 90 minutes before eating.

I made a few small modifications based on reviews and what I had on had, but WOW this chili was awesome! I used broth instead of water, crushed tomatoes instead of diced, and different beans (two cans of black beans, one can of kidney beans, one can of garbanzos). It was delicious, inexpensive, filling and easy. Has a really nice kick/spice to it. I'll be keeping this one. Thanks for sharing!

Thanks Carol-  Great recipe!  We had the soup the first night, and then rolled the left-overs in tortillas with cheese, lettuce, tomato and sour cream the following night.  We will make this again.

THE best chicken chili I've had.  I used 1 cup chicken broth, 1 cup water and 3 cans of kidney beans and 1 can of black beans.  Amazing!  My husband, who does not like chili, loved it.  Defnitely a thumbs up!

I loved this recipe- i substituted chicken broth for the water, and  varied up the beans a bit instead of using all the same- excelent!!! I slow cooked for about 2 hours as well.

VERY GOOD! I cut the recipe in half and it still made more than enough for 4 people and I made it in the crock pot. I added extra cayenne, chili and cumin. My family loved it and it was quick!

This recipe was incredible. I made it in the crock pot and used dried beans so it took me all day but it was delicious when it was finally done. I used half black and half red beans and added more corn. The spice combo in this recipe was perfect. This is my new favorite chili recipe.

Very good and very filling.  I love the corn!  This recipe could have used a lot more flavor.  Next time I would add some Texas Pete Hot Sauce.

I added a few different things to this recipe. I slow cooked this amazing soup for eight hours on low in a crock pot... It turned out so GOOD. If I would have eaten it in a hour it would have been to thin but this way it thickened up. It really made alot (caution). I added garlic,chicken bouillon cubes,olive oil, lawry's,basil, black beans.... 
TIP= I also shredded the chicken and  peppers small in chopper!  
I have had so many comments from friends saying this is the best soup they have had!!!

I made this last night with chicken that I smoked in my smoker and it turned out great. All the different vegetable colors make a very presentable soup.

This is very good.

1. Cook it a bit longer.
2. Use broth or add salt.
3. Use "chili ready" diced tomatoes if you can find them.

This is a wonderful recipe and I've made it many times! Since I don't like peppers, I leave them out but add chopped celery. I drain the beans and use 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 water for the water. I also leave out the garlic and I cook for at least an hour. Delicious and easy to make (although a little time-consuming). Really you can use whatever ingredients you like and not go wrong! Just use lots of chili powder and cumin. YUM! Thanks!

The recipe is just ok as written, but lacks in flavor.  I made a few changes, for flavor and because I wanted to make a smaller batch. I used two chicken breasts, one can of organic black beans, two 8oz cans of tomato sauce, about 1.5 cups of water & a small bag of frozen corn.  I also increased all of the spices and added salt and fresh cracked black pepper.  The lack of salt and pepper in this recipe is alarming, since they are the most basic spices to kick up flavor in any dish.  After these adjustments, it was great and just enough soup for a small family.  Will make again!

So the 5 star rating is for the version of it I made. These were the deviations from the recipe - 1) I didn’t add water , instead I added the same quantity of stock. I read a comment that said the original recipe was too bland and tasteless, and I believe this was probably the reason . 2) I added very finely diced potato , 3) I used lesser bell peppers than mentioned in the recipe. Overall, I and the fam were very happy.

I decided to go slo-cooker, 4 hrs high, 2 hrs low, and a half-recipe still filled a 4-qt crock-pot. I added chopped celery, frozen mixed vegetables, doubled the garlic powder (it's ok, I'm Italian) and used chicken broth instead of water and like another commenter had done, one can of black beans and one of kidney beans. It turned out pretty good, ok in itself, but felt it needed a little more something else. Sprinkled some grated Romano/Parmesan mixture over it and WOW!! I Will be making this again! I can see going whole-hog, adding some latent sea-shell pasta that would thicken it and calling it a really mean "pasta fazool".

A chicken chili I can like. I added extra beans and veggies and chicken. If you want a thicker chili, add a bit of tomato paste.

I had just a thigh of leftover chicken, a leftover container of kidney beans and onions, one roma tomato, and one each red and yellow bell peppers. I chopped the tomato and about a third each of the two peppers, simmered in a dash of olive oil, chopped the chicken and added it, then put in the kidney beans and onions. I swirled some sriracha hot chili sauce into the mix, added cumin seed and cayenne, and a handful of frozen corn kernels. Oh my goodness!

So, I didn't add the things I didn't have that are called for in the recipe, substituting the sriracha and the roma tomato for the cans of tomatoes, and made about a quarter of the recipe, all I need for days! Anyway, I think the recipe itself is a great base recipe to work from. It's all about freedom and making the best use of what you have on hand.

Fantastic! I couldn't believe how flavorful this was with a limited amount of spice.  I excluded the corn and used two cans of white beans, and two red.  I also added a lb of ground turkey and eliminated the water.  It was very good and received positive reviews from the family.

This was a great, light change from thick, heavy chili.  The only change I made was instead of 4 cans of kidney beans, I used 2 cans of kidney and 2 cans of black beans and then left out the cumin.  I also used Rotel tomatoes for the diced tomatoes to give it a kick.  Loved it!

Followed the recipe with cookin' mama's suggestions, and used two cloves minced garlic instead of garlic powder plus two teaspoons sugar to the soup mixture to enhance the tomato flavor.  Yum!

I made a few changes, substituted with only 3 cans of beans, and used chicken broth, instead of just water, used sweet peppers instead of peppers and added 1 pkg of sazon (only after tasting the original recipe, because it tasted to much like tomatoes for me). I will replace 1 can of tomato sauce with 1 can of spicy V8 on my next batch of chicken chili. I have done this in the past with recipes and it makes a nice difference. Thank you for the recipe!  I will serve with sour cream and shredded cheese.    :D

I used 3 different beans (medium chili, light red kidney & black) and boiled my chicken breasts and thighs in a chicken broth/water mix. Then strained the broth and used it in the chili instead of water. I did not have corn or red peppers on hand so did not use them. Loved it and would make again!!

This is so good. I used ground chicken and added hot chili powder and hot cayenne powder. It's very spicy and delicious

My friends were licking their fingers after this one.. simply amazing and perfect on a winter day! I found one green pepper and one red pepper was enough and I personally don't like corn so I didn't put it in. I added some red chilli powder and some indian spices to add a slightly different taste to it and it came out really good.

This was REALLY good!  I had leftover roasted chicken to use up that I shredded , so I found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I did make some tweaks - 1 each red & green pepper, chicken broth instead of water, 1 can of cannelini beans (instead of kidney), about 3/4 c frozen corn and 1 teaspoon of chili powder (instead of 2).  Fit nicely in 5 qt dutch oven. Let simmer for about 45 mins to thicken.  Made a nice dinner w/ some Italian bread.  Awesome!!  Will definitely make this again.

I have been looking for a good chicken chili, and this recipe is it!  My DH loved it and so did I.  A great flavor that marries perfectly with cheese.  YUM!!!  This is a keeper.

Instead of water, I used 2 ½ cups of chicken broth. I also used 2 cans of dark red kidney beans, a whole bag of frozen corn and about 1 teaspoon of salt. It turned out sooo good!

Super yummy!  Was looking for something non-dairy to use up my chicken from the night before.  I actually added in some left over pork tenderloin and left over rice and let simmer for a couple of hours.

This is an excellent chicken chili with just the right amount of spices.  I used canned corn as I did not have frozen corn.  Also for a little extra flavor, I used chicken broth instead of the water.  I think it would make a nice dinner meal served over white rice.

I reduced the corn to half, eliminated the water, didn't use the liquid with the kidney beans and used half the tomato sauce since I didn't want it to be soup but more like traditional chili. It was bland at first and made some adjustments in the seasonings which made it better. Would experiment some more and tweak the recipe.
