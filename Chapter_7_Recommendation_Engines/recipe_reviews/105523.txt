I also had a problem with the kofta being too soft.  I did not moisten the bread and I allowed the potatoes and vegetables to dry before mashing/chopping them.  When I went to fry the first batch, they disintegrated in the oil and were not salvagable.  I devised this fix: I added 1 beaten egg to the remaining mixture (I had enough remaing for about 2 dozen more balls) and baked the balls in a 400 degree oven on a well greased sheet pan with more oil lightly sprayed over the top of them.  They baked for about 30 minutes, and when cool, were just firm enough to stir into gravy.  The gravy, by the way, was outstanding on its own - would be great with paneer or chicken, too.  I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of paste.  Served with basmati rice and Naan(recipe from this website).

The recipe is a great base to start with.  I found that I had to increase the liquid for the "gravy" because the original recipe came out like a paste.  So, I added about 4 oz. of tomato sauce and increased the milk to 1 cup.  I also added some white raisins to the "gravy" which really made it taste spectacular!  As for the kofta balls, I first diced up 1 1/2 potatoes into small cubes and cooked them until soft in lot's of Indian spices (such as tumeric, masala...).  Once the mashed potato mixture cooled, I beat one egg and rolled the potato balls into the egg and then I fried them.  They didn't fall apart at all this way!  It was very tasty made this way...

I really liked this recipe, especially the  tomato sauce was delicious. However, the Koftas itself were a bit too soft for my taste. Next time I would probably use a type of potato with a higher starch content (I had used red potatoes.)

very tasty recipe.The koftas were a little too soft for me so I may not soak the bread next time and I will try it with fresh vegetables, Thank you.
Since that review I have made these several times but I now bake the koftas instead of frying them and they keep their shape much better.

This was a MAJOR disappointment.  I love this dish at restaurants and was really excited to try t at home.  I substituted sliced almonds for the cashews in the gravy and added raisins.  The gravy was really, really good, although it could have been a little spicier.  In fact, the gravy's the only reason I'm giving this more than 1 star.  The koftas, however, were terrible.  They fell completely apart in the fryer.

Great flavor. Next time, I will not soak the bread, and will use tomato sauce rather than tomato paste for the gravy. This will make it more like the restaurants serve.

The gravy is amazing, and definitely worth making again.

I had the same issue with the koftas as everyone else, and eventually gave up. This is my 2nd time making it, and maybe I'll try another recipe for those sometime in the future but I won't try the recipe for these koftas again. I'm saving the gravy for tomorrow to use with paneer and rice, and saving the gravy recipe for use in the future.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious!! I didn't stick to the recipe completely, I omitted Turmeric and did not use any bread in the koftas. They held up okay when I fried them, but maybe I'll add an egg next time. Also I used tomato sauce instead of puree and I decided to puree the sauce when it cooled. I will definitely make this again!!

These were a nightmare to make. They crumbled in the fryer. We were very disappointed. I followed the recipe to the letter. 

The crumbled bits that we scooped from the fryer were delicious, which made it even more disappointing that they did not hold together.
