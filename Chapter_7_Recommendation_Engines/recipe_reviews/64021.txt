This is a wonderful and easy recipe.  I made some small changes to it.  I started with 1.5 pounds of FRESH FRESH FRESH white fish, nothing canned and no dark oily fish like Salmon.  Use Haddok or Sole maybe Halibut if price permits.  Double the oyster sauce content, double the cilantro content to half cup.  Use a tablespoon of molasses instead of Brown Sugar, it will help in the end.  ANd lastly, if you can get your hands on a product called NAMPRIK PAO (Thai spelling) this will make the flavors explode.  It is a paste found in a jar at many import Thai or oriental stores.  A common brand name is MAERSI.  Put in about 3 tablespoons of this and a little less of the sweet chile sauce and you will love this.  Seems like a lot of changes but when I served this a close chef friend of mine from a noteworthy kitchen claimed these to be among the top 3 he had ever had.

Great recipe.  I love spicy food so I added 1 red chillie to the ingredient.  It gave it a little kick and still tasted fantastic.

This recipe was very bland. It tasted like nothing. We had to add sauces and other spices to make it taste like something!  Flip side, if you dont mind experimenting with sauces and spices, it is very easy and quick to make.  I do rec. lowering the heat though while frying or even.. bake it! (less oil and fat that way!)

These were good. I made no changes except I dipped the patties in Panko instead of dusting with flour before frying. I loved the addition of cilantro and sweet chili sauce.

Absolutely fantastic when made with dughr's suggestions!! In addition, I add a couple cloves of garlic and coat the cakes with italian bread crumbs, rather than flour.  I make a dipping sauce with mayonnaise, red pepper and a touch of lime juice.

This recipe was very tasty, even without the cilantro. I also added some sweet corn to the second half of the mix which added a nice dimension, though not very thai.

Great recipe. You can also use any kind of canned fish for this recipe such as salmon (my favorite) or tuna, and it's just a excellent, plus a little quicker and easier.

I didn't use the green onion or cilantro cause I didn't have any, but added garlic.  Was not "bland" but needed some aditional flavor or sauce.  Very good none the less, but could be improved with an extra spice or two

Instant family favourite!  We only blend 3/4 of the fish though, and chop the last 1/4 into chunks to add a bit of texture to the cakes.  We also cover in breadcrumbs (freshly made) because we like them crunchy!

These were ok, nice and quick as an appetizer for a party. I would put more fish or not pulverize the fish so much in the processor so you feel like you are eating and tasting fish.

I found these very bland, and because the fish was raw I didn't taste the seasoning before I made them.  I used a combination of fresh crab meat, shrimp and tilapia fillets.  I also added fresh lime juice and a bit of grated lemon grass.  If I were to make these again, I would puree less so there was more texture and add ginger, garlic, salt, lemon grass and more cilantro.

I made this recipe with Basa, which is a great fish that comes from Vietnam or Thailand. It's good eating and usually a bit cheaper. I used about 1.5 pounds because that's what I had. I upped some of the other ingredients as recommended by a previous review but I could have still jazzed it up even further. I might also add some salt to the mix but that's just me, I'm a salty guy. However, the fish cakes came out great. I added more flour to the mixture but as I think my fish was a tad "wet" I should have added more. They were a task to get into patties and I had to keep rolling them in flour to make them solid enough to form.  I guess you live and learn so when I make them again (which I will) I will know better.  When I did get them in the pan they totally behaved themselves and turn a lovely golden brown. I also mixed some of the oyster, fish, and sweet chili sauce for dipping and that worked out good as well.

Good, but the "dough" was sticky and required a lot of extra flour.

Loved it! I used leftover salmon; subbed quarter of a white onion (chopped) for the green onion. Needed a dipping sauce, so I made a lemon-paprika aioli: 2 T mayonnaise thinned with fresh lemon juice, one garlic clove minced, minced, 1 t tomato paste (for color), 1/2 teaspoons paprika and a dash of cayenne pepper.

I loved this recipe!  I did make a few changes to give it more flavor and spice.  I added 1/4 cup chopped red pepper, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and 1/4 teaspoon dried chiles.  It tasted wonderful and my picky husband loved it too.

I made this last night and both my husband and I thought it was delicious.  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was because I thought it could use some kind of sauce with it.  But I will definitely make it again.

pretty authentic. I added in one tablespoon fish sauce, one tablespoon lime juice, 2 tablespoons of red curry sauce, store bought, 2 tablespoon sweet red chili sauce, lots of diced green beans, had no rice flour so used regular flour and used one pound of fresh codfish which chunked down nicely in food processor, salt, one teaspoon at least, lots of cilantro, then fried it and pressed down to flatten them and used store bought sweet red Chile pepper sauce for dipping, delicious and even better with lime juice on. made a side of peanut butter noodles sauce with mixed veg.  for dessert I made fried banana fritters. powder sugar on top.delicious.

Very good. Substituted parsley for cilantro. Coated in panko. Whipped up a little tartar-like sauce with mayo, mustard and relish
Made again and it went horribly wrong for some reason. I think I must have used panko in the fish patty as well as on it last time. This time I sued flour as the recipe stated and it turned into a goopy mess. I ended up baking the mixture like a meatloaf

EXCELLENT! I took several recommendations from other reviewers. Used flounder and crab meat, dusted with Panko rather than flour, and added ginger, garlic, Thai chili paste, and hot chili pepper. Also made sauce of mayo, lime and lemon juices, cayenne, garlic and paprika. Will make again.

These were pretty good. I did cook a little "tester" cake to check seasoning. It did need salt, and I also added some fresh ginger and red pepper flakes.
