Goof grief!  My review keeps posting before I am finished!  Anyway, I made this last night exactly as written.  Very easy and very hardy.  I would make it again, but omit the green onion in the batter.  I served them with poached eggs on top to up the protein.  I also served them with sour cream and applesauce on the side.  I think that this has great potential for a quick filling dinner, I just need to figure out sides for it.   Hmmmm, maybe sausage gravy?
