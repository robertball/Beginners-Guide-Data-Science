So good!! Made it for thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Crust was a little thick in some parts, but I’ll know better for next time.

I made this exactly as recipe called for. My springform Pan was 9 1/2” and it still took a little longer to bake than the recipe stated, but not a problem. Couldn’t find “Butterscotch Flavored Liqueur” per se at my little local grocery, but used Butterscotch Schnapps Liqueur and it turned out just fine. This was a definite to-die-for cheesecake!

Great flavours!! I didn't follow the measurements exactly as I made a much smaller version. I also didn't have enough pretzels so I subbed in some crushed pecans... SO GOOD. The caramel then ganache topping made this decadent. I will definitely make this again! :)
