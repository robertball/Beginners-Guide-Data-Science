Where do I begin? First - this is a solid recipe and the flavors are all there but need to be intensified. I would suggest using Grape Seed oil that can withstand higher heat, has a neutral flavor and is healthy like OO. I mixed up the 'sauce' ingredients and decided to up the garlic and ginger - the orange was really subdued so I added orange zest (would use marmalade the OJ concentrate next time) Put some of the sauce on the chicken to marinate with the cornstarch instead of adding it later. I used Sambal chili paste instead of chili flakes. Additional vegetables like pepper and onions add a lot to this recipe. Thanks for an inspiring recipe - all the right flavors it just needs more of them.

I’m hit or miss when it comes to Thai food, but this was awesome!  I made a few changes, but mostly to the cooking process, not the ingredients.  I felt that adding the crushed red pepper flakes at the end of the cooking process would not give it the kind of spicy kick it deserves, so I started by sauteing the crushed red pepper along with the garlic in the olive oil for about 3 minutes before adding the carrots and ginger.  This infuses the oil with flavor and gives the dish an even and consistent spice.  It also brings out the heat in the red pepper.  After the carrots started to soften, I pushed them to the side and added the chicken, omitting the second dose of olive oil.  I’m not big on oily dishes and have found that I can cut it or even eliminate it most of the time.  As the chicken browned, I stirred it with the carrots and added the rest of the ingredients except the orange juice.  I used the orange juice to whisk the cornstarch in and added it last.  Serve over noodles and you will have a sweet orange dish that ends with a spicy kick.

Great dish with lots of flavor.  If you are someone reading this who does not like tweaks - STOP reading right now!  My DH and I loved this recipe.  It was every bit as good as take out.  As I stated above, I read the other reviews and made some changes.  I had 2 small chicken breast, so I added red, orange and green pepper and sliced a small onion to the mix.  This added a lot more bulk, but all with fresh veggies.  I did double the sauce as I was serving this over sushi rice and I wanted it saucy.  Rather than add water, I replaced it with more orange juice and mixed the cornstarch with it.  That worked great and thickened up the sauce nicely.  I also added a heaping tablespoon of orange marmalade, because I had an opened jar.  I added peanuts to mine after I dished it up as DH does not like nuts in his Asian food.  I also zested a fresh orange before serving.  I did use all the ingredients listed, just more of them and added a few extras.  Really very happy with how this dish turned out.  Definitely a keeper!!

I thank you for such a wonderful recipe, I will never again grab take out food. I used a fresh orange and the zest, doubled the ginger and garlic and added a yellow pepper. Zipped it up with szechuan chili sauce. Next time I am going to add snap peas. This is absolutely one of our new favorites! Thank you again! The whole family loved this dish!

We really enjoyed this.  As others have said, the orange flavor is quite subtle and if I had had some marmalade, I probably would have thrown a tablespoon or so in.  Nonetheless, it's fine as is.  My only changes were to sauté the red peppers with the garlic and ginger (as someone else suggested) and I did dust the chicken with cornstarch prior to frying.  Oh - and I only used 1T or cornstarch at end to thicken sauce.  Will definitely make again - thanks so much for the recipe!

HUGE hit here! My first time using peanuts in a chicken dish. Wow. Unbelievably good! It could use a bit more heat(did I just say that?!) but really a very good, kid friendly meal.

This was SO good. Nice thick sauce and very tasty. Could definitely kick it up a notch, but was very good like it was, following the recipe.

Based on some of the reviews, and my own personal experience, I made some slight modifications to this dish.  I replaced the 1/2 cup water with 1/2 cup OJ, that's in addition to the 1/3 of OJ already called for; I zested one whole navel orange and also squeezed the juice from the orange and added that to the OJ; I sliced half of a medium yellow onion into wedges, and sliced 1/2 a red bell pepper into thin strips and sautéed that with the carrots, garlic and ginger; instead of olive oil, I used canola oil and a couple of splashes of toasted sesame oil for more asian flavor; I coarse chopped the peanuts.  Served with jasmine rice and let me tell you, this was far superior to restaurant quality orange chicken!  It's a very adaptable recipe, you can leave the nuts out if you have allergy issues, you can sprinkle in some toasted sesame seeds, you could even turn this into orange beef and throw in some steamed broccoli.  This is a FAVE!

Loved this dish! Perfect crunch with the carrots and peanuts. Just the right amount of orange for us. I will try to cut down on the sugar next time, not so sure if we need it so sweet. Everyone at the table raved about it. Thanks COOKINGQUEEN!

Simply delicious! A change in plans brought me to this recipe and I am so glad it did. Easy to make and full of flavor. The aromas emanating from this recipe were a clear indication of how yummy this recipe was going to be. I was a little worried about whether it was going to be too sweet because of two things, that were totally on me. 1) I had to use squeezed tangerine juice, instead of orange juice. And 2) had to use honey roasted peanuts. Suffice it to say, this was a non issue. The only changes i made to the actual recipe was I only added a few pinches of the red pepper, to cut down on the heat. And I only needed 1 tbsp of cornstarch, which was enough to thicken the sauce to my liking. Great recipe that will definitely go into my dinner rotation.

I'm always looking for new recipes for chicken breasts.  This was delicious!  I will definitely cook it again.  Based on suggestions from other reviewers, I sauteed the red pepper with the carrots and substituted extra OJ for some of the water.  It was a perfect combination of spicy and sweet.

I have made this a few times and love it.  I use fresh squeezed OJ and add chopped orange bits.  One whole orange for the recipe. Really helps to bring out the flavors.  I also finish it off with fresh cilantro.  Yum!

This was  yummy!! I doubled the recipe. Added broccoli to the carrot mixture. I didn't have peanuts so I subbed 2 tbs of peanut butter. I did add significant salt and pepper. Very nice sauce.

I had to cut back the red pepper to cater to my husband’s tastes, and making twice as much sauce because I wanted plenty for the white rice I served it on, we thought it was very good.

The ingredients played well together to create a unique flavor as suggested by the recipe submitter. In spite of the recipe’s name, we knew from a quick glance at the ingredients that this was not going to have a flavor strongly associated with Asian (or Thai) cuisine. That didn’t matter as we thought this dish had plenty of flavor, and it pleased our taste buds. The recipe is incredibly easy to make with ingredients commonly available at home or a local grocer without having to make a special trip to an Asian market. The dish comes together quickly, especially if the carrots are already cut into matchsticks. I juiced a large naval orange which produced nearly 1/2 cup and subbed cashews for peanuts because of personal preference. This is an easily adaptable recipe that can range from tinkering with the quantity of each ingredient or adding new ingredients commonly found in traditional Thai dishes. See notes.

This was great! I didn't have peanuts or corn starch. So I left the nuts out & used flour instead. One of the reviewers suggested adding the pepper flakes to the oil & garlic in the begining and I tried that. It was spicy, but not too hot. I was concerned about it being too hot for my daughter, but she loved it and we will certainly add it to our line up of chicken recipes.

I incorporated some of the suggestions in other reviews:  less oil, no water (more juice).  Orange flavor was still very subtle, and I added zest.  My oranges were not very strongly flavored.  Even though I used low sodium soy sauce and unsalted peanuts, the dish was still very salty to us.  I guess I'd use less soy sauce next time.  Needed more heat for us, but that's personal taste too.  I think it would be interesting to throw some frozen peas in at the end.  I did add some sliced green onions.  More color with the peas would be nice.

Tasty. Only change I made was to add the cornstarch to 1\3 cup Orange juice at the end and eliminated the water and use 2 tbsp of peanut butter instead of the peanuts as another reviewer suggested as I have any peanuts. Thanks for sharing. Will definitely make again.

Recipe turned out very well. I lightly floured the chicken pieces and cooked them in the oil before mixing in with all other ingredients. I also added orange zest but  I though  it could have used more orange flavour. Next time I would cut out the water and use all orange juice. I was very happy how it did turn out!

I found the original recipe (to be blunt and rigorously honest) rather blah, I actually live in Thailand, no self respecting street food vendor would serve this. I do admit it is a nice "Euro-Chinese" style dish it is really easy to make especially in my wok. 
I made the following changes first used vegetable (or Soy oil) instead of expensive olive oil, (here a cup of olive oil goes for about $3.00 where Soy Oil is about $0.95 for a quart)  I eliminated the water & replaced it with more orange juice, I substituted 2 tbsp smooth peanut butter for the peanuts, added a little more crushed red peppers (but still not close to what Thai cooks would use) I added a chopped scallion and some tomato chunks I needed to get rid of. I also added some sliced water chestnuts in the last 5 minutes of cooking to give a little crunch. Another possible additive for the spicy palette could be some Panang curry paste/sauce, Available at your local (real) Asian market. one or two tablespoons will be plenty as you saute the chicken meat.  I can't wait to try some of this ladies other recipes, They look yummy. I would actually give this 3 1/2 stars.

Delicious! I had cooked shrimp on hand so I used that instead of chicken, I also added bell pepper and onions. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground and I cut down a little bit on the brown sugar. It turned out so good, I will make it again with other meats. Thank you for sharing.

I read the other reviews and I did sauté half of the red pepper in the initial oil. I chopped the peanuts fairly fine as well. When I made the sauce, I added 2 tbsp of Apricot preserves as well as the other ingredients. I served this over rice noodles and the whole family loved it.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe except for the following:  I sautéed
 some Thai peppers with the garlic and ginger, omitting the red pepper flakes. I left the veggies (added a green pepper) in the pan when browning the chicken, omitting the additional olive oil at the suggestion of another reviewer. Otherwise, everything else was exactly as written! Thank you for a great recipe! We will be eating this again!!!

I doubled the sauce except for the water and reduced sugar slightly. I also added extra orange and orange peel. I followed someone’s suggestion and added the red pepper flakes with the carrots.

I used 1/3 cup of orange juice concentrate.  I added a chopped onion with the carrot and added a diced, small zucchini a few minutes later.  I added 1 T flour to the soy sauce before putting it in the skillet .  I was out of corn starch.  My husband and cousin each had two large servings.

Added red bell peppers and snap peas, as well as orange marmalade. Left out the brown sugar and used sweet chili sauce instead of red pepper flakes. It was good. I would make it again, for sure!

Added a diced jalapeño to the initial carrot sauté and extra garlic. Used a mix of olive and sesame oil both times. Used chicken thigh chunks cleaned of fat and dredged in flour with salt and pepper instead of chicken breast’s. Substituted  chicken stock for water. Used fresh squeezed tangerines for the juice, added all the zest of same tangerines to the sauce, and skipped the corn starch (sauce plenty thick from flour dredged chicken). Garnished with fresh cilantro and green onion. Served with jasmine rice. YUM!!!!

This was a good recipe to start with.  I changed some things ... I omitted the peanuts  (my husband has an allergy) and added a teaspoon of sambal paste. I also added peppers and onions with the carrots.  I doubled the sauce per other reviewers' advice.  The end result was pretty darn good! I added some sriracha to jazz mine up. The starter recipe needed some help but ended up AWESOME.

Put the pepper flakes in with the oil and garlic-cooked, then added the onion, carrots, red peppers, (didn't have a green one, or would have added) and cooked again. Slid all over to the side of the pan and cooked the chicken with all the other ingredients added on top of it, then stirred. At the end, I stirred it all together, zested some Orange peel onto it. Added the sauce into a cup with cornstarch, then back into the pan and this recipe tasted awesome!

My 12 yo made this tonight and we loved it!  He doesn’t like peanuts in food so he left that out.  Everything else made as listed and it turned out delicious and it was easy to make.  We will be making this again with fried tofu next time and half the red pepper flakes to cut down some of the spice for my 9 yo.

My son and I made this we didn’t have fresh ginger so we used ground ginger. It was still delicious. Make sure to have your rice ready. We forgot that and had to wait. Otherwise we followed the recipe.

Loved the flavor, delicious. I’ll definitely make this again! I served it to 3 friends who also love it. I made a few changes: I marinated the chicken in the sauce for about 15 minutes before cooking but without the water.  It really added flavor. Instead of orange juice. I used frozen orange juice concentrate, undiluted which gave it more flavor. I didn’t have fresh ginger root so added 1/2 tsp ground ginger. I also didn’t have a garlic bulb so I used 1 tsp granulated garlic from Costco.

We substituted shrimp for the chicken and I didn't have fresh ginger, do I used powdered. Everyone liked it a lot overall- the only change I would make is to add orange zest and possibly some orange sections to the sauce. For a recipe named "orange chicken", the orange flavor was subtle at best. But good spiciness and good flavor in general. We will add it to the recipe rotation.

Four stars as  written.  Super easy to boost up to five stars.  For starters, fry the red pepper with the carrots.  Try juice from two valencia  oranges (and zest from one if you want a stronger orange flavor) and eliminate water.   We also cut soy sauce and sugar down to 3 tbs each.  We used chicken thighs so the chicken flavor wouldn't get lost to the sauce.  Added veggies and rice noodles are always nice

Really pleased with this dish!  The sauce is not as sugary as takeout versions, and has a nice bit of heat from the red pepper flakes.  I used honey instead of brown sugar.  Next time I'm going to add fresh cilantro for a more authentic Thai flavor.

WOW, this was so good!! I made a couple of changes because if some other reviews. I sauteed the red pepper flakes with the olive oil in the beginning, then I added a red & yellow pepper &  onions with the carrots for some extra veggies when I put the ginger and garlic in.  I put it over Thai noodles just because we had rice the night before. My husband said this is definitely a "keeper" recipe. It was delicious. :)

It was delicious! When I made it I used grape seed oil instead of canola oil. I didn't use any red pepper or peanuts and it still had great flavor. I also used a cheese grater to grate the carrots instead of cutting them. Definitely will be making this again.

Excellent! The only change I made was that I used only the first 2 Tbs olive oil. The chicken cooked just fine without adding more (I was using a non stick pan). This reduces the calories by about 60 calories per serving.  I served this over brown rice, with steamed broccoli on the side. We loved it! It was quite spicy, very sweet, and there was just a hint of orange flavor.  The sauce was very thick. Next time I may try cutting the sugar a bit, adding more orange juice, and adding some peppers and onions or other vegetables (it would be good with just about any veges) to make it healthier.  Pork or shrimp would also taste good cooked like this.

excellent recipe!!  Love it, but like a number of others it need a little something.  Instead of olive oil, I use coconut oil.  I also use a tablespoon of ginger and along with the orange juice, I use the zest of one orange.  I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and instead of the chili flakes, I finely chopped two red chili peppers.

Excellent dish. I added zucchini and cauliflower, and served over cauliflower rice. Next time I will add broccoli for more veggies. 

The only substitution I had was ginger root powder rather than fresh ginger (I didn't have it on hand). It was great regardless. I would add a bit more chili pepper flakes next time (for a bit more kick), and reduce the corn starch. It was great, and I will make again for sure!

I made it the other day, but added a few extra ingredients, such as a tablespoon of sriracha sauce, tablespoon of fish sauce and a small can of water chestnuts that I happened to have in my pantry.  It of course kicked up the heat tremendously, but I happen to love really hot stuff.  Of course, it would have been great as is via the recipe, because the sauce held a lot of flavor, but I just liked adjusting it to fit my heat level.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will definitely be making it again!

Delish!  I had legs and thighs on hand so I cooked the carrots(and red pepper) as directed, then browned the chicken on both sides(with salt, pepper and basil). While the chicken was waiting in a 13 by 9, I deglazed the pan with all the other ingredients(only half of the soy). When it had simmered a few minutes to thicken, I poured it over the chicken and baked it at 350 for 30 minutes. I added the carrots and peppers, gave it a stir and baked for 10 minutes more. Served it over rice and topped with green onion as pictured. My family devoured it!!!

Delicious! Only minor tweaks, used sesame seeds instead of peanuts and and added some hot peppers from my garden to kick it up. Also used a bit more OJ and reduced water to give it more of an orange flavor. Great recipe, thanks

This recipe  was great. I did add red and green bell pepper and green onion. I read some of the other reviews bd omitted the water using orange juice in its place. I also added peanuts on the individual plates as I have a child who is allergic to peanuts. My family really enjoyed it.

This was very, very good!  The only thing we noticed was that it was a bit too soy saucy for our tastes.  I made the recipe almost as is.  Only a couple of minor tweaks.  Rather than take sauce out of the pan, I used a 1:1 mixture of OJ and water for the cornstarch slurry to counter all the soy sauce. Even with that change it still tasted too soy saucy.   I ended up adding extra orange juice (maybe 1/4 cup?).  I think I will try reducing the soy sauce to 1/4 cup next time I make it and see if that helps.  The only other changes I made was to add broccoli and reduce the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp because we don't like things too spicy.  The peanuts were really good with it.   We sampled almonds and green onions on it too.  Both make good toppings.   We'll definitely be making this again.

It was delicious! I used a tiny bit less sugar than what it said on the recipe. :) I added a pepper as well (that I fried in olive oil for a little bit), and served with pasta.

My uncle is visiting from fort hood and randomly interjected that he wanted some orange chicken. I found this recipe and it was PERFECT! Everyone loved it. I followed it according to the recipe except I omitted the peanuts since my mom has an allergy. My husband is AMAZED at my skills but I want to thank the recipe provider! Super awesome

I made half of this recipe and I changed the process.  First I browned the chicken in a little oil and removed it from the pan.  I then sautéed some red and green peppers (instead of the carrots) and removed those as well.  I sautéed some green onions, along with the garlic, red pepper flakes and ginger for a couple of minutes and then added the orange juice (from a fresh orange), the soy sauce, brown sugar, and ketchup, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan.  I brought that to a boil and added a little cornstarch mixed with water until I reached the desired consistency.  At that point, I also added some orange zest to boost the orange flavor.  I allowed the sauce to cool somewhat, and then added back the chicken and peppers, turning to coat everything with the sauce.  I made this early in the afternoon, covered and refrigerated it until it was time for dinner.  Then I simply reheated it and served it over some jasmine rice, garnished with the peanuts and some green onion and served broccoli on the side.  Very good and it worked very well making it ahead of time.

This came out exactly as I expected and was a great combination of sweet, spice, and salt (soy). I agree with intensifying the flavors a bit and made some minor adjustments:  I added red pepper flakes to the oil at the start (and was heavy handed) to flavor the oil.  I also sautéed onion slices first in the oil.  Added the garlic (4 diced cloves) when the onions were 3/4 done to avoiding burning the garlic. Give the garlic 30-60 seconds before adding the carrots and covering to help steam them.  Remember the carrots don't need to be fully cooked as they will simmer as you let the sauce reduce.  I might reduce the sugar by half or more next time for a less-sweet version.  Just need to know what you want in the end!  Last night I wanted sweet!.

This is a very good base recipe.  I made a few changes - partially out of knowing our tastes and partially from not reading the recipe carefully enough!  Not reading carefully resulted in leaving out the ketchup and the peanuts - oops!  Knowing our tastes resulted in some deliberate changes in ingredients and technique.  I started by softening the carrots first in the olive oil (I actually had a blood orange infused olive oil in the cupboard which was serendipitous.)  I also did the same with a diced red pepper.  I then removed those from the heat and simply heated the garlic (more than the recipe calls for) along with the red pepper flakes (more than the recipe calls for) and the ginger in a small bit of oil, just long enough to bloom the flavors.  I removed that and then cooked the chicken (thighs for us) in a bit of the oil.  I put everything back in the skillet and then added the sauce (minus the ketchup and replacing the water with more oj).  I tossed in a couple of large spoonfuls of orange marmalade and some orange zest.  I simmered for a bit, removed some of the sauce and added cornstarch to thicken,  then added it back.  We served over noodles.  Thai? Maybe not.  Fabulous? Yes!

The only changes I made to the sauce was to zest an orange and a "cutie" then add the juice of the cutie. I could tell it would not be enough orange flavor.  I also added a bit of rice wine vinegar, skipped the peanuts and doubled the sauce.  I cooked it with cut up chicken thighs I first browned in a bit of vegetable oil. The sweet and heat were awesome and this is my new favorite orange chicken...of course it kicks take outs butt!

This was fabulous! I made exactly according to the directions, and it was a hit with my entire family right down to the six-year-old. The red pepper flakes added just a touch of heat, which we all liked, but you could omit for younger children or increase if you enjoy spicy foods. Served this over steamed rice with sauteed broccoli and homemade eggrolls, and my family is eager for me to cook it again. Thanks!

This was really step-intensive, but also really good.  I did a tablespoon of hoisin and a tablespoon of ketchup, rather than two of ketchup (I halved the recipe).  I wonder if water need be added?  Yum, this was good

I made this last night for dinner. Flavor was really good, only needs some minor tweaks. I used low sodium soy sauce to avoid the "too salty" problem. I think for my tastes (and my friend's) will have to add more chili flakes. The heat was there, but just barely. Also, mixed in some steamed peas and that was pretty good. Will try with either broccoli or green beans next time. Also, there wasn't a lot of orange flavor in the sauce, so next time will follow others' advise and add some orange zest. All in all though, a really good dish. Definitely a keeper.

Very good recipe. I didn't change the sauce like some other reviewers. I added broccoli and green onion. Will use a bit less red pepper next time since kids don't like a lot of heat.

This was DELICIOUS! Hub thought it would be good with diced celery next time.  Daughter asked for mandarin oranges to top it off.  Maybe add the mandarin oranges to it once it's cooked.  Either way, it's good alone. I added a big dollop (about 1/4 cup) of orange marmalade.   You could also add broccoli or diced green bell peppers. 
I doubled the recipe but didn't have enough of the cornstarch that was called for, so I used the cooking water from the rice that was cooking for extra starch to thicken it. Although it wasn't as thick as the sauce was supposed to be, it was still delicious.  I used low sodium soy sauce. I don't know why people use full sodium soy sauce and then complain about the salt intake.  It was not too salty at all.
Definitely a keeper.

That was awesome and so simple to make. I like my Thai a little more spicy so I added more red pepper flakes.  we had ours over white rice and I made Ramen noodles with soy sauce and sesame oil(lo mein) for the kids to eat with it.. it was a big hit.

This was the first time making it. Everyone in my family liked it. Next time I might add another veggie or two. I cut the red pepper flakes in half, but will add more the next time since I know everyone can handle the spice. Definitely saving this one and will make again.

Yummy. I made a few changes. I mixed the sauce together beforehand. Added orange rind to the chicken and used unsalted nuts. Also, added 1/2 tsp. of crushed red pepper to the carrot mixture. Definitely a keeper.

Extremely tasty. I made one change - I used fresh orange juice so, as long as I was doing that, I zested the orange I was juicing and added the zest along with the liquids, peanuts and ketchup.

First off I think it was too salty.  I ended up doubling the recipe but only added 1/2 cup soy sauce when it should have been 2/3 cup, but it was still too much! I used siracha sauce in place of the red pepper and it was a perfect amount of spice.  The flavors were ok, but I would have liked even more orange flavor. (I used orange juice concentrate instead of reg. juice.)It didn't feel like Thai too me at all except the peanuts.  Just weird Asian medley with peanuts.  I lived in Japan and love Japanese, Thai, Korean and Chinese food.  This was just a mush of Asian flavors. Not particularly Thai... I was disappointed.

Really good.  Used cashews instead of peanuts.  I liked spiciness, but family would prefer half the pepper.

Great recipe!  Very easy to make and my children who typically are very picky ate this and went for seconds!  I did not include the peanuts and instead of chicken breasts I opted to use chicken thighs which I find to be more tender.  Also I did not have ginger root on hand but ginger paste (found at my local asian supermarket).  The sauce was delicious...a nice hint of orange but not overwhelming.  Will definitely make this again! Might switch it up nect time and try beef!

This was a great recipe. I used a bit more garlic, ginger, and crushed red pepper. I also mixed the cornstarch with orange juice and added the zest of an orange at the end. All of these adjustments were trivial and I would recommend adjusting them to your personal taste as they are the "salt and pepper" of the dish. This was exactly what I anticipated it would be. My husband and children all loved it. The only reason I have leftovers is because I sneaked them into the fridge when no one was looking.

This was amazing!  I added matchstick red onions and green peppers, and omitted the red pepper flakes since I didn't want to make it too spicy for my kids.  I used sweet chili sauce instead.  The best part was both my 4 and 6 yr old picky eaters LOVED it!  My 6 yr old even asked for seconds-and that rarely happens!

This was just okay.  I used fresh oranges for the juice, but all the soy sauce and water really covered up the orange flavor.  The recipe just needs a little sprucing up...

This chicken is delicious!  And easy!  I took other reviewers' advice to use just OJ and omit the water, I used ginger powder as I don't usually buy fresh ginger, I added bell pepper and broccoli, and I served over angel hair pasta.  YUM!

I do know that I'm rating this recipe with my changes, but I did keep the integrity of the submitter's recipe!  I used twice the garlic and ginger, replaced the water with orange juice, replaced the orange juice with orange juice concentrate, and added a touch of sambal oelek.  I served this over calrose rice and had a green salad on the side.  Talk about delicious.  We are already talking about who should get the leftovers!  Thanks for this recipe, COOKINGQUEEN75!

My substitutions: Safflower oil for olive oil, Hoisin sauce for ketchup, and 1 tsp. Red curry for red pepper flakes. Added 1 tsp. Orange zest to sauce. And Garnished with sliced green onion.
I also recommend putting the corn starch into cold water, then add to the sauce.
EVERYONE LOVED IT!

Family loved it! I made a few slight changes, hence the 4 star instead of 5. I used sesame oil instead of olive. I thought it looked as if there wasn't enough of most flavors, and read the review that said the flavor wasn't intense enough. I used 1/4 c orange juice concentrate and added water to equal 1/3 c. I added orange zest, used powdered ginger instead, which is usually stronger. I omitted the peanuts. I was told to put this into the repertoire. Great recipe with a few tweaks!

Thanks, this is a great recipe.  I also don't like overly oily food.  I used two 1/2 tablespoons when cooking this recipe and it was plenty.  I used an 18.4 oz package of chicken.  A few more ounces would have beem better.

This was fantastic as is!  Thank you for such a great recipe.  This will be the second time I am making it and I am going to add peppers and ginger.  I also am going to use almonds instead of peanuts.  I liked the other comment to try orange concentrate to add more orange flavor too so may try that as well.  But like I said at the beginning I liked it as is I am just making a variation for fun :)
