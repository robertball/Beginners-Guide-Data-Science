Okay, so I cheated A LOT with this recipe, and only used it as an idea.  First, I didn't use instant potatoes, but freshed mashed my own.  Second, I didn't use bacon bits.  I used  about 1/2 C. real bacon, diced, fried crisp and drained well. (about 6-8 slices) Then along with all the other ingredients, added about 3 oz of cream cheese, 1/2 c sour cream, and a little over 1/4 diced velveeta cheese. Instead of onions, which my husband can't eat, I used about 1 1/2 Tablespoons of chopped chives.  I also used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain ones on top.  The leftover kept well in the refrig, and reheated like a dream.

Absolutly amazing!  This is totally worth the extra effort involved.  I made this with homemade mashed potatoes and real crumbled bacon.

These were good, but I changed up the recipe a bit.  I used real potatoes instead of the instant ones, used green onions, and added garlic butter (from this site) to add a little more flavor.  Good recipe....thanks for posting.

Pretty tasty.  I added some chopped green onions insted of reg onions. I agree with another reviewer who said that a full cup of bread crumbs may be too much...next time I'll reduce the crumb toppping mix by half.  It's good and I will make again, playing around with perhaps sprinkling some butter over the potatoes before the bread crumbs or perhaps some sour cream (?).  Sometimes things need practice before they're perfect.

If you have to eat instant mashed potatoes this is the way to do it.  I don't care for instant potatoes, but with all the cheese and extra flavoring you don't even realize they are instant.  I did use real bacon rather than bacon bits though.

It had a really good flavor, but too much topping.  Next time I will saute the onion, and only make half of the topping.

Very good. Next time I'd make and use only half of the crumb topping. It just seemed to make too much.

Excellent way to spice up instant mashed pototoes. I used what I had on hand which called for a little improvising. Used cheddar and colby-jack cheeses. Added a little extra onion for texture, a lot less bacon bits (cause I didnt have very many)And for the topping I didnt have bread crumbs so I used crushed baked potato chips with the parmesean and powder and butter. Lays I think they were, but YUMMY was that good! Spray the top with olive oil or whatever spray oil you like and it turns out beautifully! Also a yummy way to make the texture and flavor more interesting would be to dice up some green and other colored peppers and mix them in too. I'll try that the next time I make them when I don't have picky munchkin's to feed! Thanks for the ideas Melissa!

Terrible. I don't know why but all these flavor combos were so bad! I hated the onion especially! Will not make again. Thanks anyway.

This was just okay. Nothing I would write home about. Don't get me wrong, it was good but I almost would rather have plain mashed potatoes.

Awesome! Like many others, I tweaked a bit. I followed directions but substituted/omitted a few things--I used my homemade mashed potatoes, substituted Cheddar cheese for the American, used freshly grated Parmesan, real bacon, and almost one entire bunch of minced green onion. I only used 1/2 c bread crumbs but all the butter called for in recipe, and put the whole thing in a large shallow Pyrex pie pan (the big one with the scalloped edges) so there'd be a thin layer of bread crumbs over a large surface. Everyone raved about this dish---phenomenally good! A nice change from our usual cheesey scalloped potato dish!

I orginally made the Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes submitted by Barrett on this sight.  I had leftovers so decided to incorporate the leftover potatoes into this recipe.  I really enjoyed this recipe but changed it up a bit.  I omitted the American Cheese and doubled the cheese of a Mexican Blend grated cheese, omitted the bacon bits and used real fried bacon chopped up and I also omitted the parmesan cheese and topped it off instead with asiago cheese.  I will make this again.  Thanks

Very good. I used green onions (four) and used cheddar rather than American cheese.  My husband loved the bread crumb topping but I think that I will reduce the bread crumbs by half.  Thanks for the recipe.  And yes, it DOES go perfectly with ribs!

I used real potatoes, crumbled bacon, and garlic. I whipped the mashed potatoes and then gently whipped in all the other ingredients. I also place some green onion on top after it was prepared.  The crust was a little too much and would reduce it next time.  Very tasty!

I was having an anniversary dinner with relatives and to save on time; I prepared this the night.  When ready to serve the next day for dinner I took out an hour before to come to room temperature and then baked as directed.  It was absolutely wonderful.  It was an excellent accompaninment with the aussie chicken.  What an excellent dinner!!!

Very rich and tasty. Instant potatoes are not allowed on our table so I just used the same amount of home made mashed potatoes. I also used the equivalent amount of regular bacon crumbled. Reminds me of twice baked potatoes without the skins for containers.

These were OK, we weren't overly impressed, the bread crumbs really detracted from this dish.  Also, they became a solid lump of pasty potatoes after I removed them from the oven.  I don't think I'll make them again.

Good recipe using instant potatoes. Fairly quick and easy. I cut the topping in half and there was still plenty. Be sure to chop the onions very fine; I didn't, they didn't cook and made the dish seem lumpy. Reheats well too.

I have been making these for years since I found them on this site.  They are a huge hit at the holidays and one of the staples for us, everyone looks forward to them.  I use more bacon bits then it calls for and about ¼ - ½ of the topping.  I just use enough toping to cover it, the topping is a little dry and one year I am sure I will change it but if it aint broke why fix it!    Also I do not use fresh onions I use minced onions instead, the fresh onions can very easy overpower the dish.

Superb! Extremely cheesy which my wife loves!  It was super easy to make and came out wonderful.  We added more garlic because we are garlic fiends but everything else stayed the same.

I skipped the topping as suggested but followed the rest of the recipe as posted.  It was a bit heavy on the onion flavor but that can easily be remedied.  I will be making this one again.

Wow! An amazing recipe! I cooked this for my family last night and loved it... 
and I agree, there were too many bread crumbs, so I'll cut that down next time & adding the 1/2 cup of sour cream made them even better :)
Delish!

This was SO good!  I used real mashed potatoes and real bacon and didn't use breadcrumbs becuased my husband doesn't like breadcrumb toppings.  I mixed it all up the night before and refrigerated it, just kept it in the oven for a little longer.  This one's a keeper.

I would rate these wayyyyy higher than a 5 if it were possible.  They are so yummy,  the only way I altered the original recipe was to omit the bacon bits since I did not have any and used regular parmesan cheese (in a container)instead of fresh grated.  What a hit!!!!

These were really good for instanst mashed potatoes. I didn't think my family would like a crumb topping on it so I just sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on top and drizzled melted butter and they were great like that.

The potato part was good, but for some reason the topping was SALTY!!!! My family has asked me to try it again WITH OUT the topping.

OK, here's the deal.  These were good (instant potatoes and all) but quite a chore to make; not to mention kind of messy.  Also, it boggles my mind how anyone is able to mix ALL THAT CHEESE in this recipe.  I found myself using only 1-2 slices of American and 1/2 of the other cheeses; the recipe still turned out very good.  The onion adds a nice flavor also.

Great recipe, but like the other person I used real potatoes and bacon and chives instead of onions. Thanks for the recipe

Made this for a family get together, and have never received more compliments on a side dish before.  Everyone raved about it.  Excellent addition to any menu and extremely easy.

I was actually surprised by the taste of this dish. Quick and cheap way to spice up instant mash. I gave it 4 stars because the directions needed additional detail. I added milk b/c it seemed a little dry but none the less it was good.

Big hit at my house, but I would use half the amount of the topping.  Easy to make for such a great taste.

These potatoes were delicious and a big hit!! I didn't do the American cheese though and just added extra cheddar. I also used real bacon and nixed the onions (just b/c I'm not a fan of onion). But the topping was a HUGE hit.

Yum, yum, yum.  Used real mashed potatos instead and dried, minced onion.  No problems with the crust.

Very tasty!  I made this with leftover mashed potatoes (scaled down of course).  I also had to modify it a bit due to lack of ingredients - colby/jack cheese instead of the cheddar, real bacon instead of the bits, dried minced onion instead of fresh - but my husband and I both really liked it, and I will definately make it again.
