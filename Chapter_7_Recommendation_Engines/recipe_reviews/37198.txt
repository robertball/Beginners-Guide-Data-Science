Deeeelicious Ribs!!  Tender and flavorful.  I planned on saving half of the ribs for leftovers but I found I couldn't stop eating until they were all gone. Don't be intimated by the number of ingredients -- I found that I already had all of these ingredients (minus the pork ribs) in my pantry.

We just had these ribs for dinner and they are amazing! I can't wait for Superbowl! I made several changes to the sweet sauce in order to make it more spicy and with less tomato flavour. I omited the tomato sauce, added 1/2 cup of Rye (Canadian Wiskey), added 1 tbsp. of hot sauce and changed the ground red pepper to cayenne. Excellent, if I could rate it 10 stars I would.

The best Rib Barbarque I had.  Had 10 guys over the Football games, cook 12 lbs of baby back ribs and already been request for a repeat outing before the snow flys.  The prep work was well worth the results.  The mop sause is the best and if you have extra try it on Pork Chops, it's great.

All & all this was a great recipe. I had already bought small bone ribs. They turned out great. My family gave it a raves review. The trick was the dry rub & basting. Tender, tender!! The sweet sauce however needed a little work. I probably won't try the sweet sauce again. Everything else was GREAT!!

Great ribs!! I only had 2 lbs of ribs, but used all the rub, had LOTS of baste and sauce left over. I left out the can of tomato sauce, and added a can of diced tomatoes with sweet onion. Simmered it nearly all day tasting and adding spice. Will be making these again for sure.

WOW!!!--This recipe was AMAZING!!! Even though it takes a little work, it is ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!!! If you abandon this recipe because it looks like it might be "too much work," then you are truly missing out on some great ribs.

We really didn't like this recipe. It was a little too spicy and didn't have that great of a taste. Too much work for the way it came out.

I varied a little bit by adding a melted stick of butter to the spices and everyone absolutely loved them. I am a restaurant major and everyone thought i was a miracle worker fromm what i learned at school. My whole family now has this recipe thanks SLM

One of our very favorite things to do in the summer is to experiment with new rib recipes (almost every weekend!).   It seems like a lot of work, but it is worth it! I'd suggest cooking the ribs in the slow cooker or in the oven first-with a bit of the basting sauce poured on them while they cook and THEN cook them on the grill for the last 1/2 hour.  I think they're more moist that way.  Either way, these ribs have GREAT flavor- this is the best combination of spices and sauces we've used for ribs- EVER!!!!!!!!! Enjoy!

This is a bit time consuming, but so worth the effort. -- probably THE best rib recipe.  When you don't need to tweak the recipe at all, it's worth a 5 star rating.  Just watch your ribs so they don't dry out.

I made this over the weekend for a barbeque and it was superb!  In fact, it was so good, I am doing it again this weekend!
I marinated the ribs with the spice rub overnight, and roasted the ribs for 3 1/2 hours in the oven as we had bad weather.  I had to add water as the ribs roasted, but this caused them to turn out absolutley succulent.  I will definitely do it this way again in the future.
I also made up the sweet sauce a day ahead of time and left it in the fridge.  I found this made the flavour much richer.

This recipe was fun to make.  The basting sauce could easily have been cut in half.  My family didn't like this as the spices were too hot and you couldn't taste the rib meat due to the overpowering pepper spices.  But if you like things spicy you would love this.

This is the best.  Simplified the sweet sauce by using 1-1/2 c of the basting sauce in place of duplicates (vinegar, worcestershire & dry spices), add 1/2 c of tequila and no tomato sauce.  There are simply no better ribs anywhere.  I also use the dry rub on Chicken Wings - it's that good.

Wow, just wow.  I prepared all of the sauces and rub the night before.  Also, I used 4lbs. of pork lion boneless back ribs.  We put the rub on the pork and let it sit all night.  I got home from work and fired up thed grill.  and 2 1/2 hours later we where eating the best pork we ever had.  Man, I can't say enough good stuff about it.  I'm so glad we made so much so we can have it the next day.

This recipe was well worth the "prep time" involved. This recipe was so good that by the end of the meal, there were NONE left - I made 3 racks of ribs! Try this recipe.

I am not a rib fan, but made this last night because my husband is.  I scaled it down to a two person serving size, which scaled the sauces, but not the spice rub.  This was a good thing, as the rub is excellent.  I also omitted the sweet sauce, as many others did, and didn't miss it one bit.  So, for someone who likes spicy food, and who does not like ribs slathered in barbecue sauce, I thought that the ribs were excellent.  I will definitely be making this again.

The flavor was perfect for the adults and a little spicy for my kids that hate spice at all.  The sweet sauce was thin and vinegary. I let it simmer for 3-4 hours and added extra brown sugar and molasses which thickened it how I like my sauce.  Amazing flavor :)

I didn't have time to let it sit for 8 hours so I used the dry spices and put it on the ribs.  Then I made the dry spices and basting together and basted it like that.  The rest I followed exactly and WOW!  Great!

This was very nice with apple cider vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar...apples always go well with pork.  I eased up on the hot sauce and chili powder, I don't care for stuff too spicy.  Overall I thought this was a little time-consuming, but worth it.

These were really good.  I prefer a slower cooked rib like 200 degrees for 10 hours but the flavour was great with these ribs.  I loved the sweet sauce it is very overpowering and my husband didn't like it so I would reccomend not putting the sweet sauce on all the ribs.  Try this you won't be sorry.

I used the basting sauce portion of this recipe on baby back ribs and they turned out great.  But, I did substitute red wine vinegar with cider vinegar, and I added some honey.

Been waiting for months to try these.  They were definetly worth the wait.  Tender, meaty flavor all the way to the bone.  I always wanted to know the proper way to slow-grill ribs the proper way.  I have since used the dry spice rub on chicken several times and now keep a batch made up at all times.

Very good.  My husband said the work of making the dry spice & basting sauce were worth it & (he's the one who made it).  Next time we will cut the basting sauce in half.  We didn't use the sweet sauce.
