I'm a huge bourbon fan and even I had trouble with this one-- the cake was great, but the bourbon poured on after was overpowering--was like eating a shot of bourbon--very strong-- tasted better after sitting for a day-- may try again but pour less bourbon over top (maybe bake more within), decrease the pecans and maybe "candy" a portion of the pecans in the cake as the cake is not very sweet.  Would also be good with a powdered sugar glaze spiked with bourbon.  Good cake, just too strong.

This cake really needs a chance to mellow...at least overnight. It gets better with age, especially with extra splashes of bourbon every so often.

I had to put a one star for the kid friendly rating because this really is an "adults only" cake as the bourbon is added after the cooking which means none of the alcohol is cooked off.  The taste of this cake is fantastic and if you serve it to anyone who even remotely likes bourbon they will NOT be disappointed.  Great cake.  Thanks!

I made this cake before the Holidays and was very disappointed.  A fairly expensive cake to make and did not have much flavor to it at all.

A little dry.  I didn't pour the extra cup of bourbon over the top of the cake because I thought the flavor would be way too intense.  Even just baked in, there was a lot of bourbon flavor. I only baked it for an hour and 10 minutes at the set temperature.

Sounded great, but we didn't like it at all.  Too much nuts, the mix of flavors just didn't hit it off with our family.
