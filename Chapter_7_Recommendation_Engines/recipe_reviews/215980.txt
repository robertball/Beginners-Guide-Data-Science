Simple and delicious! I usually just eat these things cold with a bit of Splenda, but this was really nice change. I cut the grapefruit in half, cut it into sections and loosed it a bit. I added a bit of Land O Lakes light butter to the brown sugar along with some cinnamong and nutmeg. Very easy and very good!

I've made this since 7th grade. Our home economics teacher taught us, but it also had butter underneath the brown sugar.... Try that... it's even better!

This isn't going to be a helpful review at all.  maybe I didn't put enough sugar on it or should have tried it with butter. But I did not care for this recipe.

This tasted really good, but we found it very difficult and messy to eat. Any suggestions?

I love this simple recipe. I used brown sugar splenda and added a dash of pumpkin spice. If you don't have the pumpkin spice, add cinnamon or nutmeg. Yes, this recipe can be messy but very yummy!

This recipe seemed to make the grapefruit quite bitter; in my family of eight, there wasn't a single fan.

To Hilarybear - As a kid, my Mum made this for us. My Dad loved grapefruit. She used to slice the segments and then all around the outside first and then cook it. Made it easier to eat. They also make grapefruit spoons.

I wasn't sure I would like a grapefruit heated/broiled, but I did.  I just used one grapefruit and broiled it in the toaster oven for 8 minutes.  It adds a different dimension to the grapefruit and it is a method I will use again.

Sweet. Tart. Mmmmm Mmmmm that's delicious! This really mellowed out a tart grapefruit and while still having lots of eye opening flavor it was also sweet. I used a Texas red grapefruit and topped it with a maraschino cherry. Very good and very easy. Thanks!

With added butter, it would be an easy 5 stars!  You can also add butter and whatever spices you like to the  brown sugar and pop it in the microwave for a minute.  Quick and so good on a cold winter day.

I made this last night, but I was out of brown sugar so I used regular white sugar, which it didn't turn out like I thought it would. So I went to the store and bought more grapefruits and brown sugar. This time I put brown sugar, cinnamon and a tiny splash of vanilla. Turned out so much better! I think this recipe is super simple so we can add our own touches to it.

I did not care for the butter.  I left the grapefruit cut in half without removing the segments. I will make it again.

My whole family LOVED this. I normally eat my grapefruit without sugar,  but the rest of them like grapefruit with sugar. And we've never had hot grapefruit, but this recipe intrigued me. I wasn't sure if any of us would like this. But it was fantastic. We will definitely be having this again.  What a treat! 

I halved the grapefruit and loosened sections with a knife (cut around outside of fruit and cut into a few sections). I topped each room temperature, Pink Grapefruit with 1 T Brown Sugar and sprinkled with Cinnamon. Broiled for about 3-5 minutes (pulled them out when I smelled them burning) . Some sugar and fruit was a little black (burnt on the edges),  but it tasted delicious.

Great light dessert or snack. Segment the grapefruit before topping it with the sugar.

Simple and a nice change to try with grapefruit. I went ahead and cut around the pieces to loosen them before putting in the broiler. I think this made it easier to eat and let the brown sugar get into the grapefruit pieces. I had tried this years ago at a bed and breakfast; it was nice to be reminded of it.

My mom made this all the time when I was a kid. Delicious way to eat grapefruit. Excellent using ruby red grapefruit & a bit of butter in the brown sugar. Regular grapefruit can be so tart it hurts your teeth. I don't like really cold fruit, and this method makes grapefruit much easier to eat as well as really luscious.

I tried this recipe and it was divine.  I found it in the Jewish Sicilian Cookbook by Pamela Hensley Vincent.  Add 2 pats of butter and then sprinkle on the brown sugar! MMMMmmmmmm! My kids even went crazy for it.  It is a great breakfast or dessert treat!

Excellent.  I like small pats of butter before the brown sugar and cinnamon.  I also separate the segments with a grapefruit knife first.
