LOVED this recipe!! These muffins are awesome! I did change 2 things. I added some orange zest to the batter and used cinnamon instead of the allspice. I'm going to make this recipe into loaves and give them to my daughters teachers for Thanksgiving : )

I thought this recipe was really delicious.  It was moist and full of rich flavors.  I did not alter the recipe at all except that I made mini muffins instead of regular size and they baked for 17 minutes but I have an oven that runs very high.

I went a little crazy on the substitutions both because of what I had and to make it what I consider "breakfast worthy". This usually involves a bit more fiber and protein and less sugar.  I used pineapple juice instead of orange, because that's what I had, and a cup of whole wheat for one of the white flours. I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar to lighten the sweetness and also added a few table spoons of wheat germ and 2/3 cup of whole oats into the flour mixture. I added a cup of chopped pecans with only 2/3 cup of craisins and 1/3 cup minced white chocolate bar. I always set the timer for less time than advised so I can check it with a toothpick and not overcook. I recommend the cupcake papers for regular muffins and cooking spray for minies because it's a little stickier. I may try it again with even less sugar but it was deicious!

These muffins turned out great! I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 of the oil. I cut the sugar to 2 cups. They were still very moist and just the right amount of sweet. I followed other reviewers and used 2/3 cup white chocolate chips. Was out of craisins, so I used a mix of regular raisins and golden raisins. Also only had one cup of OJ, so melted a fruit popsicle and added enough water to equal 1 cup. Could not tell in the final result. Added one teaspoon of cinnamon in addition to the allspice, and it was barely enough spice for such a large recipe. It made 19 regular size muffins and 48 mini-muffins. 4 boys and one husband ate them right up!

The main thing I like about this recipe is the addition of the orange juice and suggest adding orange rind to taste.   I omit the white chocolate chips because they are sickenly sweet and as it is cut sugar to half.   Of course we do not like overly sweet muffins and otherwise it is a grand recipe for my files.

These were good although a little too sweet for me. My family loved them but the only thing is the white chocolate chips melted so you couldn't tell they were in there.

This recipe was a hit with my extended family and my husbands' co-workers around Thanksgiving this year.  I used the 3 dozen version to make 4 giant, 20 medium and 12 mini muffins with paper wrappers in the tins and they baked up beautifully.  I did add 1/3 cup of wheat germ
and 1/3 cup of bran buds.

Great recipe! This recipe has WAY to much sigh! I cut down to 1c plus 1/2c sugar to soak in cranberries. I made it gluten free because I am celiac. Great over all!

They fell apart, even when I used my silicon cupcake liners. I tried spraying the liners, it did nothing. If it wasn't for that,  it would have been perfect.

The combination of white chips with cranberry and pumpkin is right up my alley so I just had to try this recipe.  Followed the recipe as written, but unfortunately these muffins just didn't work out for me.  All the chips basically melted into the batter so the were crazy sweet and the plain brown sugar sunk into the top and the result was very wet and unappealing.     Tossed the whole batch out.

I had high hopes for this recipe.  I haven't tasted the actual muffin yet, but the batter was overwhelming with orange.  I only had an 11 oz. bottle of orange juice and used water for the other 5 oz.  If it had the full two cups, I cannot even imagine.  I substituted 1/2 c cinnamon applesauce for 1/2 c of oil.  Based on other reviews, I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the 1 tsp of allspice.  I didn't have a full cup of dried cranberries, so I added fresh cranberries, halved, to fill the cup.  I really wanted to use just fresh, but I wasn't sure how that would affect the outcome.  Once everything was blended in, I tasted the batter again.  I added a lot of pumpkin pie spice, not even sure how much but at least a tablespoon I would estimate.  Still, the orange was overpowering the pumpkin.  I did like the spice level better.  The only other change I made was to add some walnut pieces on top of the brown sugar.  The total production was 24 standard muffins, 3 large muffins and 6 giant muffins.  My brother is taking these to work tomorrow.  I will update with the reactions from there.

Did not add chips. Cut back on sugar and they were still way sweet. More of a cupcake than muffin.

Omg these are so good!  I scaled the recipe down by a third to make a trial batch before making them for a potluck. I followed the recipe except I used pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice and melted butter instead of oil. I think they're more of a dessert muffin than a breakfast muffin because they're a little on the sweet side but they're really good, the flavors compliment each other beautifully.

These muffins are so delicious!  They are very moist, and the flavors blend together amazingly.  Per other reviewers' suggestions, I did cut back the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and only added 2/3 cups white chocolate chips and craisins (each) and added 2/3 cup oatmeal.  I think adding pecans would make it so scrumptious - but I'm taking these to a church breakfast and other people might have nut allergies.  When I make some for home or family, I'll probably add pecans.  I also did not sprinkle brown sugar on top.  It's a muffin, not a cupcake, so I think a little less sweetness is o.k.

WOW! One of the tastiest muffins EVER! Added a bit of orange zest and used pumpkin pie spice instead of all spice. Yum!
