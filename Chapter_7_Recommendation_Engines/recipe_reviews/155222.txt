Turned out great! Little changes I made "Added 16 oz Sour Cream, 1/3 cup sugar, and tad bit more vanilla extract" also used oreos, and ginger snap cookies as a base instead of the graham (olive oil mixed in the crushed cookies) approx 40 cookies.

Followed recipe exactly except that I subbed crushed gluten free animal crackers for the crust.  It was easy and delicious.  Everyone who had some agreed it was delicious.  I am making it again for my daughter's birthday.  HalleluYAH  :)  Oh, and I used all organic ingredients.  Coconut sugar instead of white sugar.

actually 3.5 stars. Great basic cheesecake. Hearty! and yes my jiggled when i took it out, the next morning it was firm. and yes i had a brown top, maybe i should have covered mid way with tin foil? Anyway this makes a large cheese cake. i had to move to a bigger pan. halfway through cooking it had risen so much i thought it would overflow in oven, but it did not. it went down while cooling. needed more crust though. i'd make again, and add in some filling. i dont like super sweet, so this worked for me.

I made this recipe for a classic cheesecake and the only deviation was that I bought pre-made Graham cracker pie crusts for them. I had never tried to bake a real cheesecake before but have done a bunch of the no bake style cheesecakes thhat were great so I wanted to try to make a real one just like Mom used to make. My wife was a fantastic cook but I remember that she had troubles trying to make cheesecakes before, so I wanted to see how hard it really was, lol. 

I followed the recipe exactly in all aspects and they both turned out fantastic! I couldn't believe it! And how easy it really was to make.  I do not understand why my wife had trouble with cheesecakes, mine on my first try was like mom used to make. Better than store bought and has that mmm cheesecake flavor like it really is supposed to be.  This is a great recipe for a classic cheesecake and I will make them again now that I know how easy it is and how good they are!!!

You avoid the brownish top (and cracking!) in the cheesecake by reducing the cooking temperature, and extending the cooking time. ;)

I made this simple, basic cheesecake for dessert on Christmas Eve. Topped with cherry pie filling, this is always a special occasion dessert with the added bonus of being extremely easy to make and absolutely delicious. Itâ€™s always a hit.

Awesome recipe!!! This is my go to cheesecake recipe. I've made it with cherry, lemon, and blueberry topping and pumpkin swirl. I make the recipe as is, I only add the topping. Everyone always loves it. I just made a blueberry one for Christmas and received rave reviews. Also, so easy!

Have tried many recipes that require baking in a pan of  water (which means you have to wrap springform pan in foil), and this one tastes just as good--love this recipe! Only change I made was to skip the sugar in the crust and sprinkle some salt in, I like salty-sweet.

I used 2.5 TBS of lemon juice to give it a more lemony taste.  I love that there is no flour nor corn starch added.  Just pure cheese.

It was ok, but I think it needs more sugar and vanilla.  Just a little too cream cheese flavor and not as sweet as I'm used to.  Also, mine wasn't completely done in the middle even after an additional 5 minutes in the oven.  I took it out when it was jiggly only in the middle.  Should I have waited until it darkened on top?

So simple and so delicious!!  My staff and everyone who tasted it loved it.  Many thought it was store bought.  

I will make this time and time again!  

I did reduce the butter in the crust by 1 tablespoon and I cooked it 5 less minutes than instructed.

Delicious!  My only complaint (and it's entirely my fault) is that it cracked thru the middle.  I know why - I beat it too much and I did not put a pan of water in the oven with it while baking.  But - no worries - I topped it off with cherry pie filling and nobody knew the difference.

Super nice and easy cheesecake recipe, also easy to alter of you want to swap out little thing. I made it the classic way also used it for an oreo cheesecake and it turned out lovely.

Easy and loved it. I made it for a party and it was the first dessert to go!! Got so many complements on it. I have made it about 10 times and each and every time it was completely gone. I have made it for fun once and my brother just ate all of it. I LOVED it

I made this and and other deserts for dinners at work once a week and became known as the dessert king. I substituted Nilla Wafers (about  40) for the crust and it was fantastic!
