I first made Patty's BB soup about a year ago, but didn't think to post a review. However, I was preparing to e-mail this recipe to my daughter and was shocked to see it only had 2 reviews!  This soup was so much yummier than other Black Bean soups I tried out.  First of all, to those that feel it takes to long for the bean prepartion.....really, one can skip the overnight soak.  That mostly helps as far as keeping you quite so "windy" after eating.  The sherry is a most!  Do not skip it or any other sherry you may have on hand.  I slow cook mine for the better part of a day because we like our soup rather thick.  Oh, and one more thing!  I once tried dipping this soup over rice, ala`Red Beans & Rice.  Yeah!  Majorially yummy!  A side of corn bread muffins and it's all about heaven.  Thanks Patty's Mom!

Great soup, I changed the cooking method and used my slow cooker. I added the ham bone, soaked beans, cooked onions & celery along with rest of the ingriendents to the cooker. I also added cumin and cayenne to the soup. Cooked on low for 8 hours. Pureed the soup with an immersion blender, a lot easier! Topped soup with cheese and crumbled tortilla chips.

Excellent black bean soup.  I'll be using this recipe from now on. 

I was in a hurry, so I used three large cans of black beans, which I drained and rinsed.  Added a carton of chicken broth and tossed everything else into the mix.  Only other change I made was to add garlic and a teeny bit of cilantro.

Thanks, Patty's Mom!

This is a very good soup.  Yes, it takes a long time.  Why do beans take SO long to get done?  Man.  But the combination of flavors is excellent.  I have always enjoyed sherry as a finisher in soups and I wasn't disappointed this time around.  The only thing keeping this recipe from a five-star rating is the investment of time it takes to prepare ... soaking the beans overnight, waiting for the beans to soften, etc.  Other than that, it's a great recipe.  Do note, I had to at least double the amount of salt.  And don't forget to remove the bay leaves before you blend the mixture.

I've never tried making soup from dried beans or from using a leftover ham bone.  But this was a great soup to do both of those things with for the first time! My whole family loved it.  My kids' couldn't get enough of it and are already asking when we can have it again.  I followed the directions as written.  But at the end I made a few adjustments because it just tasted like it was missing a level of flavor somehow.  I would suggest using some chicken stock or chicken flavor boost packs instead of just adding more and more water.  I also added a little cumin, Old Bay seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder and lots more black pepper.  It really brought the flavor up to where I thought it should be.  I didn't blend any of the soup like it stated.  Instead I used the back of the spoon and kind of smashed the beans up against the side of the pot and that gave just enough mashed beans to give it that soup substance.  My husband discovered that once it was cooled that it made for a great dip for tortilla chips as well!  Can't wait to make this again, definitely a keeper.

I made this with a ham hock and pretty much as written.  Unfortunately, I just realized right now that I forgot the sherry!  I pureed about half of the beans, trying to thicken the soup without losing all the texture.  It was good, but I don't know if I'll try it again.  Needed more flavor, but I don't know how much I lost by forgetting the sherry...

This is such a simple and tasty recipe.  Blending the black beans makes it distinctive. Without that I think it would be just another black bean soup. I used a hand blender in the pot and was done in minutes.  I didn't have a hambone so I used beef stock concentrate and diced ham--was wonderful this way too.  An extremely easy and economical soup.  Will definitely make it again!

I personalized this one a bit.  Used black and white beans, 1 can of each, used 6 cups water, 2 cups chicken broth, no sherry, added cumin and chili powder and also added green peppers.  SOOOO yummy!  And easy!  I let it cook for about 3 hours, fished out the ham, pureed it in the pot with a hand mixer, ripped off the good pieces of ham and threw them back in and done!  A delicious soup!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was just wonderful!  Did everything just as written but only pureed half of the beans in the end to give it some texture.  Up'd the black pepper to 1 1/2 t. for our tastes.  Thanks for sharing!

this is a great soup and it makes a ton.  the only changes i made were to sub some of the water with some ham broth i had in the freezer from when i do a baked ham and i forgot the sherry. it was delic, husband loved it also. mine was pretty salty but i think that was my fault as the ham broth is salty, oh and i cooked it for quite a while so had to add extra chicken broth to keep it soupy. all in all i'll use this recipe again

We just finished having this for dinner.  It is excellent!  At the suggestion of some of the reviewers I made the following changes:  I added 2 tsp of ground cumin; 3 cloves garlic, chopped; and 1 tsp dried oregano.  In addition I substituted unsalted butter for margarine, 4 cups of packaged vegetable stock for half the water and I used two ham hocks instead of one.  I omitted the salt. I added cream sherry, not dry sherry, at the end, which really does make this tasty.  I garnished with a diced, fresh red pepper.  We ate it over rice.  The cook times are perfect here.  I set my beans soaking as soon as I got up this morning and they were ready to go by late afternoon  -Lynn

Awesome soup!  The sherry really adds flavor.  Like some of the reviewers I skipped soaking beans and added 3 cans of rinsed black beans instead.  I also substituted chicken stock for the water and added some chopped ham.  After blending the soup I added another can of black beans for texture.  Wonderful!

We had this for the second time last night and my husband and kids could not rant and rave enough.  My husband has been to culinary school and is hard to impress.  

I used stock and meat that I froze after our July 4th ham and canned beans.  It was still so tasty!

Out of three homemade soups I offered at our christmas open house this was the least favorite.  The soup was good, I like the sherry, but it couldn't compete with salmon chowder and tortilla soup.  Also the sherry flavor fades adn I kept adding more.

This soup is amazing IF it's served with a dollop of fresh home-made salsa on the top of it. The combination of the comforting gloopy warmth of the soup contrasting with the fresh crunchy zing of the salsa make it one of my favourite dishes ever!

Wonderful.  I only used half the amount of Sherry and ended it in a blender to make it creamy.  Very good.  Yes its time consuming to make but its worth it.  I even ate some for breakfast the next morning.  I fried a tortilla, poured some of the soup on top and then placed two fried eggs on top of that with some cheese, tomatos and red onion.  Awesome.

Very flavorful.  Couldn't find a ham bone but found two pieces of smoked ham with bone still in it and also used some fat back.  Very good and hammy.  I didn't chop the parsley, I just kind of placed it in the pot and then fished it out before pureeing the soup.  I also added one red pepper.  Would definitely make again.

I have a similar recipe, however, I substitute some of the water with beef broth or bouillon cubes for a tastier and stronger base.  I eliminate the sherry and still have excellent results. I also puree the beans, but leave some whole in the soup.  Good recipe.

I followed the recipe to the "T", with the exception of using smoked neck bones.  The soup smelled great, but I didn't taste the smoke, and the dry sherry I used overpowered the rest of it.  Hubby and I each managed to finish one bowl, and the rest went down the drain...something we never do!

Well, this was a mess for me but once I fixed it, it really was nice.  Please people make sure your dried beans aren't too old.  I guess mine were.  I soaked overnight and cooked the 3 hrs and they were still hard.  I had to gather them all out of my pot and then added canned beans then cooked another hour.  Other than that I would say do it, Nice.

I like to either use chicken stock or stock left over from cooking a pork butt because I add shredded pork instead of the ham. I do add cumin, diced jalapeno's and sometimes stew tomatoes. I like to top it with scallions, sour cream, and cheddar cheese.

This is the first time I have made a bean soup and mashed the beans. I used a potato masher. Used 2 onions instead of 3 and used about a cup more dry beans. Added a red bell pepper, half a jalapeno, and a couple tsp cumin as others said. Turned out great. I didn't have sherry on hand and it was good anyway. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my word, this was amazing. Couldn't believe how very tasty this is. I've made it twice now. First time, I used the bone from a bone-in ham; second time I used two smoked pork hocks and a chunk of the same ham I'd had frozen.

Made some of the additions and substitutions others have written up. I added half a chopped green pepper, 2 t. cumin,   1/2 t. garlic powder. Subbed chicken broth for half of the water and used 3 cans drained black beans for dried beans. I only used two onions, and left the sherry out and didn't feel like the soup was missing anything. I also blended half of the soup and left the other half unblended for texture. Oh, and I also think that long cooking is the key here. It gets tastier as it cooks and even better when it sits overnight. Thank you for a stellar recipe!

This was delicious. Everyone loved it. There were no leftovers due to everyone going back for seconds! I took some advice from the other reviews and added cumin. garlic and onion powder. I also used no extra salt, the smoked ham bone from butcher provided plenty of salty flavor. I also forgot the sherry...oops, making it again tonight with sherry hope it's just as scrumptious if not more so. Awesome share thank you!!

Too much onion and I cut back on it.  Too thin. Husband hated it and he usually likes any soup I make.  I will go back to my tried and true recipe

This is a great recipe. I did modify, as suggested by others, adding 1 chopped green pepper, 1 t oregano, and 2 t cumin. I put all ingredients together in crock pot ( didn't even soak the beans ) , substituting 4 cups chicken broth for half the water, and adding the onions, celery, and 3 garlic cloves minced after sautéing. I was in a hurry so I put crock pot on high for first 3 hours, then low. It was done in about 5 hours. Great recipe!  The ham was good on Easter, but cooked this way it was amazing!  And the meat just falls off the ham hock !

I like black beans in other recipes, but I did not like the flavor of this soup at all.  It simply tasted like regular bean soup.....which I do not like.  My husband said that it was just ok.  I think I will try to freeze the rest of the pot and take it to my Dad, who loves bean soup.
