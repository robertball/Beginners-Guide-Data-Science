I love this casserole. To make it a meal, I add cooked and diced chicken breasts.

This is an AWSOME recipe Absolutely delicious. I tried it about a year ago and ever seince I make it at least once a month. I try different kinds of cheese in it and lately I've been adding chicken and making it a main course. If it is too strong for you with monerey jack substitute it for one of your favorite cheeses. I like it with cheddar.

The concept is a good one - but WAY too much sour cream. I used way less, didn't measure, just a "glob" - and used 1 can green chiles and 1 can japs, cuz we like it SPICY. Used less cheese because.. well, cheese is expensive. Really good concept, with changes, a good recipe.

Sometimes listening to other's reviews helps, sometimes not. I halved the sour cream and felt it wasn't enough (see photo - it's a bit dry without the correct amount). I realized halfway through making this that I didn't have canned chiles so I added other hot spices to make up for it. The way I made this it was about a 3. I think if I had the correct ingredients and made it according to the recipe, it would have been a 4. Still, it's mainly just rice and sour cream, but it's got a lot of potential. You could easily add chicken or hamburg, tomatoes, etc. to this and make it what you want it to be. Think of it as an enchilada with rice instead of a tortilla and just have fun with it. I will make this again, but will follow the recipe, and maybe add a few other things in for fun.

I made this a little differently so it would be the main dish.  I cooked 2 cups rice in 4 cups chicken broth with green onion, pepper and garlic, then mixed in a large can of chili beans.  Combined the sour cream with the green chiles and a packet of taco seasoning, then layered the components like the recipe said and baked like the recipe said.  This made 8 large servings and leftovers were great in flour tortillas with lettuce, tomatoes and salsa.  Either in tortillas or plain, this turned out really well (my fiance loved it) and I'll make it again.  Also, KKH3 must have done something wrong with their rice.  There's no reason for rice to cook differently in broth than water, and the liquid to rice ratio described in the recipe should be just fine.

This was SO yummy.  I only had one can of green chiles so I used one can of Rotel, drained, instead, and followed the rest of the recipe.  Will definitely make this one again.

This is a very good base for a casserole.  I did change it to suit our tastes more, so I can only give it 3 stars, but if I could give it 3.5, it would be closer to that.  I found it definitely needed meat of some kind.  I've taken chicken or pork and sauteed in either fajita seasoning or adobe seasoning and layered it into the casserole.  I've also sprinkled extra seasoning onto the casserole to give it a touch more flavor.  After the second time making it exactly as specified, I tried adding more seasoning, and it definitely rounded out the creaminess of the sour cream/cheese.  I probably only use ~2 cups shredded cheese, and that is plenty.  My husband, LOVES, LOVES this casserole.  Definitely one of his favorites, I feel it needs a touch more "oomph" - obtained by extra seasonings.

I had to make major changes to this recipe.  There was WAY too much cheese and way too little rice (and I love cheese).  I ended up making a cup of rice and I reduced the cheese to half.  The rice did not cook well with the broth (there was too little broth) and I ended up having to add water to it.  It tasted well except for the crunchy rice that didn't get cooked enough.

I found this casserole to look very unappealing.  It tasted not too bad just a little strong. I won't be making it again that's forsure.

I got the recipe to use leftover chicken - only to realize the only chicken ingredient was chicken broth.   That didn't stop me.  I just layered the chicken over rice layer and then poured the sour cream layer over that.  I subbed out the rice for Cauliflower Rice.  I also added chopped fresh Kale to the sour cream mixture - it was fabulous.

Very good! I added 2 cans of chopped chicken and corn. Also, I did not have the rice the recipe called for so I sub it for a box of zatterans black beans and rice. It was excellent!
