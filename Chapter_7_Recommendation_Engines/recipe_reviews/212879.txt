i agree, the jaggery will bring out the date flavour! also a pinch of cummin and coriander powder each will make the chutney slightly aromatic yet give it a punch!

This was OK not great, but that's probably my fault because I couldn't find tamarind concentrate.  The closest thing I could find was Mexican tamarindo juice, so I used a half cup of it and cut the water.  It was tasty, just not awesome.  I'd try it again but with proper ingredients next time.
