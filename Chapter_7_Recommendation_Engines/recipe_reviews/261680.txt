I really liked the cookies, but when I took the dough out of the fridge, it was too hard to shape.  I did not make the frosting, because it looked to hard, but the cookies themselves were good.  The cookies looked a bit weird and were soft when they came out of the oven, but they hardened in five minutes time.
