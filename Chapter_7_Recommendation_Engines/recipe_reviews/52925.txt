The first time I made this I followed it exactly and it was very tasty.  Then the second time I made it, I added one large chopped onion, one chopped green pepper; sauted them first, then added the eggplant and I also added two minced garlic cloves towards the end of cooking.  I also doubled the sauce. I replaced most of the sugar with splenda (diabetic here!)and it turned out really yummy.  I will definitely be making this regularly.

I did mine a little differently.  I used regular eggplant and rice wine vinegar instead of red wine.  I didn't have a chile pepper so I used a 1/4 tsp. cayenne.  I didn't have chili oil so I used sesame.  I peeled and sliced the eggplant and brushed both sides with additional sesame oil.  I broiled them on both sides along with sliced slabs of red Bermuda onion rings also brushed with the sesame oil.  Meanwhile, I combined the sauce ingredients (I doubled the sauce)and microwaved for 2 minutes until thickened, stirring every 30 seconds.  When the eggplant was browned, I basted it and served it topped with toasted sesame seeds.  It was delicious.

Today, I found 8 chinese eggplant at my local farmers market for 99 cents. This recipe looked most appetizing so I tried it. I made 4 times the recipe, added 2 Tbs. of Cooking Sherry, 1 clove of garlic and omitted the salt. Also, I added a little chopped ginger, crushed red pepper flakes (instead of chilli oil) and a half of a red green peppper. This tastes just as good as our best local chinese restaurant and living so close to New York, I think I know good Chinese food. Thanks, Bonnie, now my family thinks I can really cook!

this recipe is REDICULOUSLY easy and SO good!!  changes i made were minor: doubled the sauce, used arrowroot instead of cornstarch, added fresh string beans and a green pepper (cooked for a few minutes with the eggplant, after it was browned, before sauce was added).  i garnished with sesame seeds and served it with steamed brown rice.  i can't even believe how good it is - it's going into the rotation, for sure!!  i'd imagine this simple sauce would be great with chicken or tofu as well.  total keeper - love it!

this recipe is great! i tweaked it a bit by using sesame oil instead of chili oil and added cayenne pepper to taste. i also tripled the sauce recipe (except the cornstarch and vinegar)because i added cut green bell peppers and ground chicken to it. my husband said it tasted like the kind he has eaten at restaurants. highly recommended if u like chinese food!

This was pretty good.   I used only 1 small eggplant and added 2 small zucchini, garlic and shallots to the eggplant and tossed everything in olive oil.  Also added 1/2 lb. of ground chicken that I cooked up separately with just some salt and pepper.  Doubled the sauce and used red pepper flakes because I had not chile oil or peppers on hand.  I will make this again, but I will try to make it a touch more sweet.  Thanks.

Delicious!  My six year old was begging for more!  You could easily double the sauce and add chicken or pork to the mix - serve over brown rice.

This was a great recipe, but I thought it was lacking in extra vegetables. So I added: mushrooms, green onions, and chinese pea pods.

very yummy. i used asian eggplant (used chinese once and japanese the other time. no real difference), added somegarlic, sweet onion and mushrooms. i doubled the sauce and used splenda. also used asian chili sauce, added fresh ginger, a little sesame oil (may not do that in the future, it's a little overboard) and added chinese 5 spice. the sauce is great. i also used the sauce in a beef and broccoli stir fry. it was awsome!

The sauce for this eggplant is divine! It is the perfect combination of soy, vinegar, sugar and chile peppers - who would have thought that these simple ingredients could form a perfect marriage of flavor?  I did not change the sauce recipe at all, except for ingredients I didn't have on hand. But I used equivalents. I did not have fresh chile pepper, so I diced up a pickled jalapeno (discarded the seeds). I used potato starch instead of cornstarch, and I did not have chile oil so I used Spiracha chile sauce.  I think this eggplant recipe stands on its own as a perfect vegetarian main or side dish. However, it would also pair up with either tofu, chicken, pork cubes, or ground pork, just as well.  Today I wanted to make a heartier lunch, so I cubed up about 4 oz. of leftover pork loin with a tiny bit of minced onion, fresh garlic, and a bit of grated fresh ginger. I browned the pork, onions and garlic and ginger well, and set it aside in a bowl.   I then proceeded to make the eggplant recipe as stated, and added the browned pork mixture at the end. It was mouth watering.  I give this five stars for great flavor, simplicity, and versatility.  What a great recipe!

Used a little more eggplant than called for so I upped some of the ingredients in the sauce to match but this came out really really good. Worth looking at just for the secret to the soak and dry hint that really helped my eggplant not get mushy like it normally does.

First off I made this recipe (as written) so many times last summer as a way to make use of our massive eggplant harvest. It is delicious and simple just the way it is. However, my husband and I live 40 minutes from town and sometimes I was out of one thing or another so I've made many substitutions that work just as well as the original. In place of the red wine vinegar I've had to use rice and white. Both tasted just as good as using the red. Apple cider vinegar didn't cut it though. It might be a food sin but in a pinch I've used bottled hot sauce for the fresh green chile pepper. I've left out the salt completely and mixed in just a drop of sesame oil for additional flavor. You can also halve the sugar. I've also added just a splash of water to thin the sauce itself and make it go farther. And heck over the winter with eggplant out of season, I've made the sauce and tossed it with cooked black soybeans to serve alongside fried rice (or even over spaghetti). The original recipe is AMAZING in addition to being adaptable and forgiving of tweaking. Sometimes I just make it as written.  The point is don't be afraid to play with it.

Tasty, but very very spicy. It tased more like an ingredient than a main or side dish in and of itself. Very intense, but it has potential.

Amazing.  My husband loves eggplant but complains that I never make it (because I didn't know how!)  I used this recipe and WOW we both loved it.  I added two cloves of garlic, an onion and some mushrooms. Instead of chili oil used red pepper flakes.  I tripled the sauce recipe because of the added vegetables... (but I put less sugar than the amount called for one serving of sauce). You don't have to measure exactly with this recipe...  this tasted so authentic I know I will be making it over and over again.

Great! I picked 3 Japanese eggplant and 2 jalepenos from our garden and went to town on this recipe! I would suggest doubling the sauce. (Not the sugar.) I used brown sugar because I like that with soy sauce.  I did saute 1/4 of an onion with the jalepeno.  This was really delicious.  My husband loved it. I think this would be wonderful with cut up chicken breast over brown rice as others have suggested.  Try this!

Excellent recipe, this sauce is the closest to the sweet and tangy brown sauce you'll get in many Chinese restaurants, and can be served with beef and broccoli, chicken and bell peppers, or pork and onions -- any combination you can think of. I made the following changes due to ingredients on-hand: rice wine vinegar instead of red, brown sugar instead of white, 2 cloves minced garlic instead of the green chile, and a generous squirt of sriracha instead of chili oil which mixed better into the sauce. I made this with a peeled medium-large eggplant, 1 medium-large zucchini and half an onion all cut into about 1" chunks. The eggplant *must* be salted and soaked for the 30 minutes to remove the bitterness and sort of "seal" the cut edges slightly for proper roasting texture. After soaking, rinse it thoroughly and pat it dry with dishtowels or paper towels. I roasted the pieces in a non-stick pan, otherwise they soak up a lot of oil due to the spongy consistency and increase the fat content of the dish. Did the eggplant in 2 batches, and the zucchini and onion by themselves with a bit of oil to prevent sticking. When added, the sauce thickened up immediately. Good thing I tripled this recipe as the family was licking out the empty bowl as we cleared the table. Next time, I'll make this with beef and broccoli or chicken and quadruple the recipe, as I expect it to be just as amazing and popular. A new classic in our house.

I loved this recipe! I added fried tofu, red peppers, onions, and minced garlic.  I used rice vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar, siracha sauce instead of a green chili, and sesame oil instead of chili oil.  I also tripled the sauce because I added more stuff.

Delicious :) I've made this twice in two days! I did end up adding red bell peppers, garlic and onion.. but even without those I'm sure it would have still be great! The sauce is perfect.

I lived in China for two years and this was my go-to dish anytime I ate out.  I think I had high hopes for this recipe that were not entirely met.  It's good, just not as good as the dishes I had in China (which, to be fair, is probably a reflection on my spoiled tasebuds and not the recipe).  I added a little oyster sauce and green onion (a la China style) and served it over white rice.  I think next time I will double the sauce as other reviewers did.

I really want to rate this recipe higher, but I just can't.  The sauce was very tasty and turned out alright the night I made it.  I had plenty of leftovers to have for lunch the next day, but when I reheated it the eggplant turned to a mushy, slimey mess!  I ended up throwing out half the recipe because it was too disgusting to eat.  I might consider using the sauce again without eggplant, or make a smaller version of the recipe to avoid any leftovers.  I just can't give it 5 stars if the leftovers don't reheat well, though.

Yum!  I used what I had:  unpeeled regular eggplant cut into 1/2 x 1 x 2-inch slabs; and hot sauce instead of chile pepper and chili oil.  it's a flexible recipe (some suggestions in other reviews look worth trying) that turned out great.

Super easy and pretty close to the authentic Chinese eggplant dish. (I'm Chinese, I should know). 
A few things I did differently... I was too hungry to soak the eggplants. 

I mixed the sauce (minus green chili pepper and chili oil, plus crushed chili sauce), added a tsp of oil, added the cut eggplant and cooked with lid covering a non-stick pan, stirring constantly. 

I added some red onion and green onions and a little water near the end of cooking when the sauce dried up. It turned out pretty good. Next time I'll wait to add the cornstarch until the end of cooking.

I tripled or more the sauce and added green peppers, onions and zucchini along with sauteed chicken. It was tasty but not hot and spicy. I'll need to increase the heat with red pepper flakes next time.

This was excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not have chile pepper or oil so I subbed 5 or so dashes of Goya hot sauce, and it was the perfect amount of heat.  I also added half an onion, chopped.  After pouring in the sauce, I reduced heat to low and let cook for at least 5 more minutes so the eggplant would absorb the flavor.  Delicious... and for the record, I have been to China!

This is a great quick and simple recipe that is packed with flavor!  I substituted a regular medium eggplant for the Chinese eggplant (because that's what I had laying around), and just cut it into thin strips.  Also, I didn't have a green chili pepper, so I just used chili flakes in sesame oil as well as a bit of cayenne in the sauce - we like it spicy in my house!  The one misstep I had was following other reviewer's advice to double the sauce; it's just a matter of personal taste, and I don't like my food swimming in sauce.  I had to scrape away half the sauce when I was eating it just so the eggplant wasn't overpowered - yikes! ...But like I said, personal preference...

I was looking for a different way to prepare eggplant and this was certainly easy to prepare.  I halved the oil for frying (just to cut back on fat) but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I did add some extra cayenne to turn up the heat but that's just personal taste.  Thanks for the recipe Bonnie, this one's a keeper.

This was so yummy!  I left out the chile pepper since I didn't have any & used regular eggplant.  Served it with rice and citrus glazed tilapia.  Very tasty.  Next time I will add more heat.

Great recipe and very quick. I added potatoes (yes, potatoes!) and they worked very well with the dish (they will have to be par-boiled first though). I also agree with others who added more chilies - this wasn't spicy enough as is.

This is fantastic... both times I've made it, I didn't have any fresh chiles on hand, so I substituted a healthy tablespoon of sambal and it came out PERFECTLY.  Highly recommended, will try again with a little ground chicken.

This was an excellent recipe!  To make the perfect, simple stir-fry, just add one onion and two bell peppers.  I used two good-sized globe eggplants.  Beware that my eggplant took way longer to cook the other ingredients, so I ended having to pick them out and cook them longer.  I also quadrupled the sauce and thought that was perfect.  It's a glaze more than a sauce.  Serve over rice.  Highly recommend.

This was great. I used splenda instead of sugar and I didn't have chili oil so I left it out. Instead I just added a dash of some gyoza dipping sauce I had around. Regardless, it was great. Added ground turkey to it and my bf and I loved it.

I agree with previous reviewers - excellent sauce! I did double it. I added green onions to it as well, and a little dark sesame oil because I like the flavor of that; it would have been fine without it though. Next time will plan to add a little onion and garlic as recommended in the past.

This was a good eggplant dish, although I found the vinegar flavor a bit overwhelming.  In doubling the sauce, as recommended by several reviewers, I had to dilute the vinegar with more soy sauce.  I used brown sugar instead of white, and since I was unable to find chili oil, used chili paste with a bit of red pepper flakes.  Not nearly as spicy as I'd hoped for, but I'll adjust it next time.  (We like spicy!)  But to compare this to P.F. Chang's eggplant dish, as some reviewers did--well, that's quite a stretch. Also, I didn't let the eggplant sit in water for 30 minutes.  I simply salted them and let them sit in a colander in the sink for that time, to remove excess water and bitterness.

Good sauce, not GREAT, but easy. I doubt it's very authentic...??? (Not exactly Asian ingreds.) Very salty. However, still relatively healthy and a quick/easy way to do up eggplant. We will use the sauce idea in other stirfries, probably.

Great - I double or triple the sauce depending on the number of eggplants I am using. 3 eggplant=3xsauce Used rice vinegar instead of wine and used Chili sauce (Vietnamese or Philippians brand with Rooster on it) instead of chili oil and chili pepper.  I am making it for the 2nd time this week!!!

I can't believe how good this is.  I changed the recipes a little bit. I dobble the sauce.   I broil eggplant cubes instead of fry them. I added a teaspoon of ketchup in the sauce.  Beside eggplants,  I added bell peppers,  pork.  Since the sauce a little too thick,  I added 2 Tablespoon of water.  It came out perfect.  This is a keeper!!! Thank you so much Bonnie,  God bless you!!!

This was ok the first time a made it but the recipe had potential so i made it again last night with a few changes. The soy sauce has a high enough salt content to make the additional salt in the recipe overkill so I left it out. I also tossed in an extra half tablespoon sugar and a clove of garlic. To make a complete meal I added in a green bell pepper, a white onion, and a diced chicken breast. Ta-da! in house take out.

This was really good and I don't even like eggplant!  The sauce is delicious and would be good with any number of vegetables or tofu.  I made a few slight changes.  I used one regular (large) eggplant, doubled the amount of saice for this (could have been tripled, I like sauciness!) and used vietnamese chli garlic sauce.  I will be making this agin soon.

considering it survived me accidentally dumping in a whole extra boatload of mirrin right at the end, i think it's pretty f'in good.

i also added red peppers and onions for a little variety.

The eggplant tasted great but when I put it over rice noodles, there wasn't enough sauce for the noodles.  Next time I will double the sauce but use the same amount of vegetables.

This "Hot and Sour Chinese Eggplant" is so delicious! (100 stars!!!) I can imagine so many different variations on the recipe using Asian ingredients (i.e. toasted sesame oil, chili pastes, sesame seeds, and ginger), but it is also so delicious as written.  Thank you Bonnie for sharing your recipe.

It was nice, although the taste was bit different than I used to have it in China. I diced 2 cloves of garlic in there and toasted it at the end of the eggplants. I suggest you to cut the eggplants in a small size. In this way the eggplants absorbs the sauce lot better, and juicy.

I thought this was overly salty and the flavor was lacking...something. I can't quite put my finger on what was missing, if it was just too salty and sour or if it was too sweet, or if there were other flavors I was wanting that weren't there.  It didnt seem very well balanced.  I'll play around with it again, because I love chinese eggplant and while this wasn't as good as my favorite Chinese restaurant's, it was also cheap and easy (and had a LOT less fat than the restaurant version. I made some extra sauce and added tofu to this recipe, browning it in the oil before beginning and then adding it back once the sauce had thickened up, for a complete meal.

This was an instant favorite. I read the reviews and also doubled the sauce and added half a coarsely chopped onion, a whole yellow pepper, one large carrot sliced lengthwise and, although out of season, some store bought asparagus. Additionally I replaced the chili oil, as I had none,  with olive oil mixed with Sriracha. THE WHOLE DISH WAS GREAT! I used a tablespoon of Splenda but next time will probably do a tablespoon and a half. It was very pretty and hearty. My husband and I loved it. For Non-Vegetarians the eggplant could easily be replaced with chicken.

I used Rice wine vinegar. Used Chile paste, Soy Sauce,and oyster sauce to make sauce, which was doubled. Also added Red pepper sliced, broccoli  florets, and served over rice.

Eggplant is by far my favorite vegetable, and this is my favorite way to prepare it. You will definitely want to at least double the sauce recipe -- I triple it because I like extra sauce to mix into steamed white rice. In a pinch you can use Italian eggplants which have been salted and rinsed, but Chinese eggplant is really crucial if you want super buttery texture.

I tripled the recipe. In the tripled recipe, I used one green Thai chile and then just added two dried chile peppers. I also used sesame oil in place of the chili oil. I didn't add any salt either. If using sesame oil in the future, I probably wouldn't use 1/2 tsp per serving. Other than that, delicious!

This is excellent and very versatile - thank you for sharing. I tossed the eggplant in the oil and half a tsp each of ginger and garlic and baked it at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes instead of pan frying since I was making a large quantity, made the sauce separately and then tossed it together. It tasted even better the next day!

I had to substitute the green chili pepper and chili oil for dried red chili peppers, but it was still great!  I love eggplant and this will be a great new way to cook it.  Will make again.  

My one complaint is that the recipe only made enough sauce to cover the eggplant, but not enough to mix in with my rice.  Next time I will have to remember to make more.

As a new cook, this was one of the more flavorful, intricate recipes I've ever prepared. In fact, I plan to use the sauce for chicken and other stir-fry veggies now that eggplant season is gone. Great recipe!

I highly recommend adding onion and green/red bell peppers for color and variety. Be careful not to overcook the eggplant.

my parent's own a Chinese restaurant and I always feel bad going there to eat all the time.  So, once in awhile, I'll try to make Chinese food at home on occasion.  This recipe is excellent and one I will keep on hand for a cold, snowy day to warm me up!  

The only change I made is that I added in a little diced green onions right at the start.

This was really easy and yummy! I served it has a side dish to some baked lemon chicken breast and it was fantastic. I added some green beans to mine as well and completely omitted the oil, opting instead to saute it in water.

This was absolutely delicious! My modifications were: I added stir fried tofu with soy sauce, an onion and 4 cloves of garlic. I also tripled the sauce. The dish was a huge hit! My fiance requested that I make it at least a twice a week : ) 

Two thumbs up. Great vegan-friendly meal.

Super yummy--I always double the sauce when I make it though.  My husband and I both eat this all up.  It is better with the thin japanese eggplants, rather than regular eggplant.  I've made it both ways and can attest to that.

Thank you for this quick and easy recipe! I submerged the eggplant in 2 cups of water, 3 tbs redwine, 3tbs sugar and 2ts of salt. For the sauce, since I don't have green chili or chili oil, I infused sesame oil with crushed red peppers and use it. It was really restaurant style!

delicious, but as written there wasn't enough food - perhaps my eggplant was smaller than the author intended.  Needed to double the sauce too.  But the flavor was delicious.  Will definatly make this again, just in larger quanities and may throw some other veggies in too.

I would actually like to give this one 4.5 stars.  
I made a couple of adjustments to make it perfect.  Doubled the sauce, used rice vinegar instead of red, and added a tbs of oyster sauce.  Also because there were no long peppers available, I used rooster sauce.
All these changes were to my and my families likings and I think enhanced the flavor.

I love this sauce! Instead of just using eggplant, I also added chicken, mushrooms, and bell peppers to have more of a balanced meal. It was a hit!

I have been trying to find this recipe for a long time with may failed attempts. I love the eggplant cooked at chinese restaurants but I could never get it right until I found this. I made a few additions to make it perfect but its also good as is. I added 2 cloves garlic, added an extra green chili, chopped up about a Tbs of fresh ginger and doubled the sauce. I think next time I will triple the sauce (I just really like it) and add some ground meat for extra flavor. Thank you for posting it. My search for this eggplant recipe is now over.

Yummy! It was a great base recipe. I doubled the amount of sauce, added some garlic and chopped spring onions. Next time (Oh yes, there will be many 'next times) I'm going to try adding some tofu

This was good, but I had to triple the sauce (maybe the eggplants I use are just too large). This time I added jalapenos and minced garlic to the recipe and it gave it a little more spice. I will keep making this and will continue to tweak it.

Nice variation using eggplant. The flavors really stand out. I did take the advice of others and used rice vinegar, garlic and Vietnamese chili sauce. Yum!

This is a really good quick way to prepare eggplant. I did leave out the vinegar and the salt and it was really delicious without it.I also added just a little garlic. I was trying to duplicate the stir fried eggplant i ate in China. I think I ate it there every day for two weeks! I will use this recipe again. P. S. I have used this recipe many, many, many times now. Sometimes I will make a whole batch of it just for myself! I love it...

Excellent dish! As other reviewers, I decided to use rice wine vinegar instead of the red wine. I cut back on the oil (1 Tbsp)- thank you, my teflon pan! I also added one clove of minced garlic to the sauce and some scallions at the end. Overall, delicious and it will definitely be a staple for me.

We doubled the sauce, used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, and used a small can of green chilies instead of fresh. We actually made this twice in a week's time, once with japanese eggplant and tofu and the next time with just tofu. It was so good!

LOVED IT!  Like others before me, I doubled the sauce, added garlic and onion to the eggplant.  I also added garlic and sesame seeds to the sauce mixture.  After sauteing the eggplant, I removed it and fried chicken dredged in flour with some Chinese Five Spice - then added the eggplant back to the pan with the sauce.  Complete meal in one pan!

This definately has a kick to it!  Really enjoyed this recipe and have made it a few times now. I doubled the sauce and made it into a chicken stir-fry over brown rice for guests.  They LOVED it !

I substituted a few things... regular eggplant, cornstarch, chili powder and red pepper flakes... and perhaps that's why it was only ok for me. Good, but not amazing.

I thought this was great!  I changed the recipe a bit -- I sauteed some onion, green pepper and garlic and then added the eggplant (I used baby eggplant that I got for a great price at the market) and also some cubed potato that I had cooked to soften a bit in some water in the microwave.  I doubled the sauce and used sesame oil instead of chili oil, as I didn't have any.  I then added a bit of crumbled cooked sausage that I had in the freezer.  It was a delicious one-dish meal!

Awesome recipe. I added sweet pea snaps, bell pepper, and onions to it. I also added sriracha sauce to the sauce to give it more spice, and cut out the chili oil because i didn't have any. It was pretty much more veggies than my pan could hold!

This recipe turned out pretty good. I added a bit of ginger garlic paste. I really dint expect much from this recipe, so i would say it came out beyond my expectation . I wil give it four stars.

Pretty good.  I used rice vinegar because I didn't have any red wine vinegar and added some oyster and plum sauce, garlic and fresh ginger to liven it up.  I did need to add some water during the pan frying because the eggplant was not softening up, but overall it was really tasty.  Next time I will definitely add some green onion and make more!  Thanks for the post.

This recipe is fantastic and tastes exactly like a dish I often ate while studying abroad in China! I did cut back a tad on the sugar and I also used twice the amount of chopped chili pepper called for. Thank you very much!

I thought this was very good and easy to make.  I used regular american eggplant and cubed it without peeling.  I soaked it in water and sprinkled salt on top like the directions say to do but only soaked maybe 15 mins and then poured the water out of bowl.  I doubled everything to make the sauce but used only 1 teaspoon regular sugar and one packet of splenda.  I also used 1 tsp apple cider vinegar and 1 tsp rice wine vinegar...I didn't have anything else.  I substituted the chili oil and vegetable oil for olive oil and used red pepper flakes and red chili powder to spice it up instead of the chile pepper.  I also added a zucchini which was really good.  I loved the taste of this sauce!  Thanks!

I've made this three or four times now and it's starting to become a favorite.  Tonight I had some extra ground pork so I browned that up, set it aside, and added it back in when the eggplant was cooked.  Then the sauce and then served it over white rice.  It was great.

First time I made this I thought it was fantastic. Made it just as the recipe said but I added some thai basil at the end. Second time I made it I thought it was just average. Maybe I forgot an ingredient. Anyway, I will keep it in my recipe box.

Fantastic recipe! I only had pickled jalepenos for the diced green pepper and it worked great. I served it with white rice and salmon. This tastes just like the eggplant you get at a Chinese restaurant. Well... a little better.

If you use Japanese/Chinese eggplant (the long skinny kind instead of the large round kind) for this dish, you can skip the first step.  Japanese eggplants cook really quickly and you don't have to sweat them or soak them before using.  Throw them in the pan/skill with the oil for about 5-10 minutes over high heat.  Add some water if the pan starts to dry to keep the cooking going.  

Also, red wine vinegar does NOT an authentic Chinese dish make.  Use rice cooking wine instead or if you can't find it, rice vinegar.  

I threw in some jumbo shrimp right before I added the sauce.  You can double the sauce or right after it hits the pan and starts to thicken, add a tbsp or so of water.  

Pretty tasty.

Great recipe! I put my own spin on this adding three cloves of minced garlic, substituted the sugar with raw honey and added red and green bell peppers. I also laid it over blanched purple cabbage instead of rice for a low calorie option. Very tasty!!!

Pitfalls - The eggplant takes longer to cook than described and I needed to add some more soy sauce and red wine vinegar to adequately cover one eggplant with peppers. Also, I did not use chili oil. Just minced one jalapeno.

Really delicious recipe! I also used red pepper flakes instead of the chili and chili oil.  However, next time I would not double the sauce ingredients, since this made the dish a bit too salty.  Very very good!

The eggplant was perfect.  The only method I changed was how I salted the eggplant.  Instead of soaking it in salty water, I put the eggplant cubes in a colander and sprinkled salt over it.  After half an hour, I rinsed the eggplant.

I wanted to like this, but didn't care much for the sauce. Hot yes, but it wasn't sour and was bland otherwise.

I had to add additional soy sauce and some rice vinegar to get the taste I wanted.  That said it's turned out yummy, especially over jasmine rice.

We really liked this a lot.  I added some extra veggies and upped the sauce, and it was still terrific. I did, however, leave out the extra salt, and that's why I gave this four stars: since you're salting your eggplant (and some stays behind), and since there's soy sauce, two teaspoons of salt is overkill. The soy sauce/vinegar/sugar combo is interesting and complex enough that that much salt really isn't needed. Try it without, or with less, salt. You can always add more, but you can't remove it!

Didn't have chili oil or a green chili pepper (not for lack of trying to find these things) and had some difficulty balancing out the flavors, so looked up how to make chili oil and found chili peppers (i've had in my spice cabinet and threw one in) cumin and pepper, as well as red chili flakes.  Also had a HUGE amount of eggplant and doubled the sauce twice (made it in two batches)  We added that mustard you get from the chinese restaurants and it was pretty good.  I really shouldn't be rating this recipe since I didn't follow it, so give it 5.

Very tasty and almost taste like restaurant eggplant dishes (but less greasy). Here are some tips I gathered from other reviews:
-Double the sauce
-Used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine
-Can substitute 2 tbsp of flour for 1 tbsp cornstarch
-Cut chile pepper in half, remove seeds, then slice
-Sauteed with 2 cloves of garlic and some onions
-Spray eggplant with oil

Living in Japan, eggplants are one of the most common and inexpensive vegetables around.  This is now one of our favorite recipes... sometimes make it with a little ground chicken or turkey and serve over rice as an entire meal.

This is absolutely delicious! I have made it twice, and used brown sugar both times instead of white and it was great! The first time I added shrimp and mushrooms, and the second time chicken, onion, and bell peppers.  I tripled the sauce both times as well as I like extra sauce and it was just the right amount.

A great start to a recipe!  I only used one (huge) eggplant, then added a green pepper and a giant carrot, thinly sliced.  For the doubled portion of sauce I used black vinegar, a splash of red wine, sriracha to taste instead of the pepper/chili oil, a tsp of chopped garlic, red pepper flakes and 1/3 cup of orange juice. It thickened up right away after pouring it over the sauteed veggies.  Add some frozen chicken tenders until cooked through and serve over rice! mmm.

Yummy, though like other users I added some chopped onion and doubled the sauce. I don't think there would have been enough sauce if I'd stuck with the recipe. And I used a squirt of sriracha instead of the chile pepper.

This is our new favorite way to eat eggplant. The only change I made was I omitted the chile pepper because I didn't have one on hand. My husband went out and bought chinese eggplant JUST so I would make this again. 
I've found that with the chinese eggplant I don't have to "sweat" it like regular eggplant, but it's easy to over cook.

Excellent, restaurant quality sauce! I always double or triple the sauce (sometimes use tofu or different veggies), omit the salt, and use rice wine vinegar and toasted sesame oil. My husband and I crave this sauce at least once a week!

TOTALLY Awesome recipe.  At the end, I added a couple of tablespoons of Sambal Oelek to give it more of a kick.  My sis and bil thought it was to die for....so did I.  If you love eggplant, you should love this one. Make sure the eggplant is nicely browned.

The sauce is very yummy!! I did it slightly differently.  I boiled the whole eggplants in water first to soften them.  Then cut to small chunks before I sauteed.  The sauce ingredients were very good, except that I added probably 2 more tablespoons of water for my three eggplants.  Great recipe.  Thank you.

OMG!!! This was my very first time to ever eat eggplant and I was not sure what to expect. But I must say this dish was absolutely amazing!!! I used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, I also used 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of chili pepper. I added sauted onions and bell peppers and I too like everyone else doubled the sauce. I will definetly make this dish again and as for the sauce it will be a staple of sauces to be used in my house. Thanks so much Bonnie for your recipe.

Oh this was my first time eating or cooking with eggplant. I wasn't sure what to expect and I don't think that I am an eggplant fan, sorry to all of you that are.... I realllly liked the sauce it was so good. I didn't have the chili oil or the fresh green chilis, I just used some chili garlic sauce that is so yummy. I will use this sauce again for stir fries or what not, but no with eggplant. LOL

This is my favorite eggplant recipe by far - and I eat a ton of it.  Instead of chili oil I add dried hot red chilis which adds a nice kick.

They're right. This is really easy and it's delicious. I didn't have any cornstarch so I used a little less flour and I added some raw cashews and fresh ginger.

I started just going & accidentally added the veg. oil into the sauce but it still turned out great. I added in a mixture of rice & red wine vinegars, I think, and a few drops of sesame oil. My shovel-anything-in-his-face fiance even stopped to declare it really good. :) I will up the spiciness for my taste next time. Tasted even better the next day, almost like pickled eggplant.

Altho this is a very good recipe with a remarkable sauce, I think it is too strong for the simple vegetable ingredients and overwhelms the eggplant. The sauce is very intense & flavorful; I think it would be good with stronger flavored ingredients -- maybe green beans and sliced beef or pork.  But with eggplant -- no, I don't think I'd make it again.

I found this a bit too salty. My Chinese boyfriend said it was OK, so I know it's at least on the right track! I'll try it again, but it needs to be tweaked to our tastes. 

Definitely double the sauce on this one!

EDIT: Just wanted to add that I also tried this sauce, doubling the sugar, with two chicken breasts, cut into strips. WOW! It was reaaaaally good. Give it a try!

Really delicious, with a few small changes. I used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine for a more subtle vinegar taste.  Like others, I used red pepper flakes instead of the fresh pepper and substituted toasted sesame oil for chili oil.  Loved the flavor the sesame oil added, but would have liked more heat, so next time I'll add a little of both oils.  I also doubled the sauce amount and used some on chicken for my husband (not an eggplant eater).  It was excellent!  I'll be making this again and will keep playing with the recipe to get it just a bit spicier.

It tasted just like the one from a Chinese restaurant. I used half amount of chili, since my family isn't a big fun of spicy food. Served with steamed rice and it was really delicious.

Great!  This honestly tastes like the eggplant from a good authentic Chinese restaurant (Maybe even better because I found it less salty).  I added a couple of cloves of garlic and some black bean sauce.  It was perfect!  While the ration of sauce to eggplant was perfect, I'd probably double it next time because I like it saucy an the sauce was amazing.
Thansk for the recipe!  I'm so glad I can make this one at home so easily!

Overall this was pretty good.  I used 2 regular eggplants and doubled the sauce.  I made a couple of minor changes to the sauce: used toasted sesame oil as I had no chili oil and used a couple of chopped up dried serrano peppers (seems like you could use many kinds of hot pepper as long as it's not marinated).  Came out good with the changes.  I've made similar dishes before without soaking the eggplant, next time I think that I will skip the soaking, only make 1 eggplant and add sliced carrots and pea pods.

I was really optimistic about this. I just bought a much of eggplant from the farmer's market and thought this sounded excellent. I followed the recipe as is except without the chili oil or chili pepper, but the sauce seemed too sweet to me. I'm assuming the heat from those would fix the sweetness. Next time I'll cut the sugar to a tsp. or use my stand-by sweet/sour sauce.

Loved this recipe because it reminds me of P.F. Chang's Eggplant and Chicken dish. In that spirit, I substituted a chicken breast for an eggplant,  doubled the chili oil, added a dash of paprika, and one minced clove of garlic. It was delicious and spicy!

Not impressed- didn't seem to have much flavor or become tender enough but that might be because I used non-Asian eggplants.

Delicious! I added green beans, and sliced mushrooms and yellow pepper for variety (will also add tofu next time), and about 1/4 of a cup of water to the sauce to add more volume.

I liked this a lot, quick and easy to make. Flavorwise it didn't blow me away, but it was still very good. I added sesame seeds and red bell pepper. I also cut back on the salt, 1 tsp is enough, but maybe that's just me.

This was one of three eggplant recipes I tried for my daughter, who was skeptical because she'd never tasted properly cooked eggplant.  It was the riskiest because sauteeing the eggplant this way either could have left it chewy on the inside or overcooked on the outside.  So I was delighted that the eggplant ended up having just the right texture/consistency.  I tinkered with the spices, based on availability, but what I used was reasonably close, and they enhanced rather than drowned the flavor.  We'll be eating this again!

I made this last night for the first time.  When I find a recipe I like to follow the directions for the first time and then tweak it after I see where the recipe was intended to go.
That being said, I followed the recipe exactly (well almost, had to substitute peanut oil for vegetable oil).  This was delicious and so very easy!  I will be using this sauce on WAY more than eggplant!

This is great flavors. But I hate to fry foods. What I do instead is make the sauce in a large salad bowl, cut up the eggplant (soak chunked eggplant in salted water for about 20 mins first and rinse, pat dry), and any other veggies I might want in my dish.  I put the chunked eggplant in the bowl and toss well to coat. then I bake in the oven, until lightly charred. Nicely cooked, slightly roasted and wonderfully flavored. All without the mess associated with frying.  Use any flavors you want to make your sauce that goes with your meal: Asian, Thai, Indian, Italian..they all work.

I took the easy way out. I made a small test portion using half of  one  large eggplant. After brining in salt water, I rinsed and cooked cubes in olive oil, garlic & smoked paprika.  I then tossed it in Mongolian BBQ sauce and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Loved it!

I would make it again with maybe a little less sugar.  I didn't have chili oil so I just used chili powder.

I also added some broccoli, and it was really delicious.

This was so delicious!  I got the Chinese eggplant from my neighbors garden and I didn't change a thing except for doubling the sauce as per the suggestions from other reviews.  I served it with fried brown rice.  My dinner guests loved it.  I will totally be making this again!

Excellent and easy.  Had no chili oil so used hot pepper and a bit of sesame oil. Added extra rice (didn't use red) wine vinegar for a sharper taste.

I add broccoli, green beans, red pepper which I cooked separately then added at end with the sauce. I quadrupled the sauce. I used 2 cloves of garlic and some fresh ginger which I sautéed for a minute before I added in the eggplant. It was fabulous. I will definitely make it again, but I would likely decrease the sugar by 25 - 50 %.

Very good, although me and my boyfriend thought it was more sweet and sour than spicy and sour. Will make this in regular rotation for asian meals. Make sure you use chinese eggplant, you can get them at any chinese market. They are very long and rather skinny compared to standard eggplant. I made no substitutions, except that I used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine as it's what I had on hand and is typically used in asian dishes. Perhaps that is why mine was more tangy/sour than spicy? Either way, GREAT side :)

It was very easy and delicious and will be making it again. However it tastes best fresh off the stove and not the nest day as leftovers.

This is good stuff!  Even my husband who is NOT a fan of vinegar said it "isn't too bad" and he ate it.  Recipes that include vinegar often don't make it past his nose, let alone past his teeth.  I liked it a lot.

I couldn't find Chinese eggplant at my local stores, so I used a globe eggplant with fewer of the seeds.  It as spicy, tender and awesome!  Had to fry eggplant closer to the 10 minutes.

Good recipe. I added fresh garlic and a little garlic powder to the mix. Also I used dried pepper flakes instead. This is a keeper.

It was ok, but pretty good for eggplant, and I hate eggplant.  I used rice powder (from the blender) as the thickener and that worked just fine.   And I made twice as much sauce.

Not too sweet and not too spicy.  Came out perfect.  Taste's just like my favorite thai restaurant.  Thanks will make this recipe every time!  I added Lemon Grass Paste and Ginger paste while sauteing the eggplant.

Since I only had half the amount of eggplant listed in the recipe, I added fresh tomatoes from my garden instead. I also added one tsp of garlic. The result was very good. I also reduced the amount of salt by half since I thought this dish had too much sodium in the original recipe. I highly recommend this dish for everyone to try! Serve it over rice is just perfect.

This is one of my favorite ways to eat Japanese eggplant. This first time I made it exactly according to the recipe. The next time I made it, I added some green bell pepper and yellow onion to the mix and doubled the sauce. Very tasty!

This turned out great! I tripled the sauce because I added a green bell pepper, an onion, a couple minced garlic cloves, and 4 chicken sausage links.  I used cayenne pepper (to taste) and coconut oil because I didn't have chili oil. I used a 4 oz can of diced green chilies in the sauce instead of fresh.

I really enjoyed this. I couldn't find Chinese eggplant so I used regular eggplant. I doubled the sauce but wish I had tripled- will do that next time. Thanks for the recipe.

Edit: I've made this a lot & I now added 1 lb of browned ground pork & triple the sauce. Makes for a very tasty meal over rice.

I made this tonight and it was delicious!  I used a cayenne pepper out of my garden and no chili oil or salt.  It gave it just the right bite. 

I used equal instead of sugar which was good but I didn't have the sweetness I thought I would get.  Maybe ordinary sugar would have been better.  

I also added garlic (gotta have garlic!) to the sauce.   I added stir fried pork that I stir fried in sesame oil with garlic and ginger.  Served on a small bed of quinoa.  Very nice.

The eggplant had a very pleasant taste with this sauce.  I hope that the leftovers are good.

After reading some of the reviews, I cooked an onion and some garlic in a wok first. Then I added a red pepper, mushrooms, broccoli, sirloin steak & ginger. Next time I will use shrimp or chicken breast.  I served it with rice.  We both loved it.

Delish!  I added onions chopped into rings, green bell peppers, 2 minced garlic, mushrooms and zucchini.  I used rice wine vinegar since I was out of red wine vinegar. I also used sesame oil instead of the chili oil since that's what I had on hand. Then I topped it all off with sesame seeds.

The sauce was very good and would work for any stir fry. My husband suggested adding orange zest and I will try that next time. I have two reasons for only giving this recipe 4 stars. 1 - the directions did not say to peel the eggplant and the skin was very tough and took away from the great taste of the eggplant. 2 - just using eggplant does not seem like enough of a main meal. I added chicken, red pepper, mushrooms, snow peas, and served over rice.

This was not as good as I thought it would be, but I think it's because it was a little sweet for my taste and it needed more vegetables.  The overall idea is good, but next time I'll work with the sauce and add some more veggies.

This was very good. It was a nice change to use eggplant with a recipe that was not paired with tomatoes. Great way to use up all the eggplant from my garden. I followed the recipe exactly except used chili/sesame oil.

Very good.  I added a purple bell pepper, some red onion and tempeh, all which I stir fried first before adding the eggplant.  I also doubled the sauce recipe like other reviewers said and think that is a must.  I didn't have chili oil so used slightly less sesame oil (as others suggested) and added cayene pepper.  My green chili was a very mild kind so the cayene really helped kick it up.  Will make again for sure.  I also always stir fry in peanut oil.

I must have done something wrong because I didn't like this recipe too much. It looked and smelled very similar to this eggplant dish that I used to get at my local Asian food market. They usually serve it buffet style there and is always good. 

I did use American eggplant rather than Chinese. The only difference is the skin,  size, and the fact that American version has more seeds (tends to be bitter). I cut mine to have very few seeds. 

When I was done cooking, the sauce came out to be a gooey texture. It didn't have much sauce at all except enough to stick onto the eggplant. Maybe I did something wrong, who knows but I didn't like this dish as much.

This was a fabulous recipe.  My husband, who is Chinese and is typically an extremely slow eater, consumed this in lightning speed which is quite a compliment.  I did make a few changes as recommended by others.  I used cayenne pepper instead of the chili pepper and I used sesame oil instead of the chili oil.  It tasted fabulous and was actually even better the second day for leftovers.  I served this over a bed of rice and also some egg drop soup on the side.

My husband made this and it was fantastic.  He added red bell peppers since we didn't have a chile (would have been good, though!) and it was just great. We will make this again.

I thought this was just okay.  My bf didn't like it at all.  He doesn't like sour stuff, though.  I don't like it enough to make it again.

I've been searching for an authentic recipe and this came really close but was disappointed in the aroma while preparing this.  Using red wine vinegar gave this dish a very strong vinegar smell and taste.  It's good but not something worth making again.  Sorry.

Pretty good. I served it on brown rice and doubled the sauce. It is even better with chili cooking sauce or dipping sauce on it. Yum!

I love eggplant cooked in this way.  I used globe eggplants instead and it took much longer to stir fry- at least 15 minutes- to get to that soft texture that you find in a restaurant.  It was way too spicy for my husband- he couldn't even eat it.  I like it a little spicy but it was just too much.  Next time I will leave out all chili and just add a little bit of crushed red pepper flakes.  I will also double the sauce.  With those changes, I see this becoming a regular dish in my house.

My eggplant was home grown and only 1/2 inch thick, but long.  I didn't peel it just made 3/4 inch thick slices.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used white wine vinegar and for chili oil I used oil that had chili's steeped in it.  Our hot pepper was also one from our garden.  We were pleased with the result, but I'll buy red wine vinegar and chili oil for next time and will try some of the suggested variations.

We found the eggplant itself to be bitter.  I’m not sure if it’s because we didn’t use the Chinese variety or if I prepared the eggplant incorrectly.  Like other reviews, we doubled the sauce minus the corn starch.  We also substituted Splenda for the sugar & 1/2tsp.garlic chili puree in place of the chili oil. The sauce itself was quite tasty which is the reason for the 4 stars.

This was okay.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, regular eggplant instead of Asian, and I didn't add as much cornstarch.  I added dried red chiles.  I liked it for a change but not enough to make it often.

This was pretty good but the eggplant was a bit hard, even after salting and leaving for almost an hour.  I added onion, garlic and green beans, and halved the sugar.  Great flavour.

This looked wonderful. I forgot to add the vinegar, but it still tasted great. Way too spicy for me though...If you can't stand any hot food like me then use green bell peppers rather than green chili.
