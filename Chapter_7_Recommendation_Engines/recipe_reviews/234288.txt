I am pleased to be the first "official" review. This is an awesome cookie recipe that is a must try for all cookie and healthy snack lovers. I had to hide half the batch because the first batch was gone within hours. Only change I made was to leave out the white sugar. We tend not to use it and didn't miss it at all. As I reported in my first review before this was published I was afraid there was not enough moisture in the wet ingredients to handle the dry but it was not a problem at all. They were very moist cookies. Wooden spoon was required! This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing WCM!

I reviewed this recipe, before it was kitchen approved. Here was my review: I thought these were a good hearty cookie. I liked how they stayed chewy after they cooled. I followed the recipe, except I used a mixed berry blend, I chopped some, and for the chocolate I used milk chocolate chips I had in the house. Only change I would make is cut the coconut in half or leave it out. However, that is mainly because, I am just not a fan of coconut personally. The base is really versatile though. I could even see adding the nuts, if allergies are not a concern. I am sure my husband will love these, when he tries them this evening. I got 3 dozen, with half the recipe. If you like a cookie with "everything," this recipe is for you.

Wonderful cookie recipe - so good that I had to hide them from myself. Only change I made was to use 1/2 cup of coconut oil and 1/2 cup butter. The directions on this recipe are excellent.  Even the baking time of 12 minutes is perfect.  Thank you for sharing your 5 star recipe westcoastmom! It is a definite keeper for me - give it a try - you won't be disappointed.

I cannot stop talking about this awesome cookie recipe, I think this should be in the top 10 cookie recipes on this site.
It is a very healthy cookie and you can make it healthier by cutting out the white sugar and just add 1 cup of brown as it is still lots sweet enough. Since I have made this recipe a couple of times now, I too the suggestion of the submitter and added 1/2 cup of Whole wheat flour in place of the entire 1 1/2 cups of white flour.
I cannot say enough how awesome this cookie is and now all my family and friends are enjoying it too. Thanks Westcoastmom for a truly great cookie recipe.

Here's another 5 star rating!  I followed the recipe exactly.  It doesn't need any changes, though you could add/subtract any ingredients you wanted to because of what you have on hand.  I did end up baking mine for 12 minutes and got 45 cookies from a slightly rounded 2-tablespoon cookie scoop.  Thanks for a great new recipe, westcoastmom!

Love these cookies. I left out the coconut because I was out of it and instead of a full cup of chocolate chips I added 1/2 cup chocolate and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. I had to use my KA Mixer instead of the wooden spoon to incorporate all the ingredients, which worked perfect, because the batter is very dense. I got 4 dozen cookies. Will definitely be making these again! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Delicious! :) After talking with westcoastmom, I changed this up slightly just by using pine nuts in place of the sunflower seeds and white chocolate chips in place of the milk/semi sweet. I used raw sugar instead of white and I didn't press them down, at all. Wonderful texture and flavor. :)

This is a great cookie and very versatile.  I had to make 3 changes based on what I had at home.  1) light brown sugar because my dark is hard as a rock 2) sunflower seeds rather than pumpkin and 3) because I made these during Lent and I gave up chocolate, I made the cookies with cinnamon chips.  We loved these cookies.  I made them to take on vacation and DH kept eating them and taking them to a friend at work.  I finally hid them in the freezer.  We really like the taste of the cinnamon chips in this cookie, and I would probably use them again.  Thanks, westcoastmom for sharing your fabulous recipe.  I know I will be making this one again!

This is a really great cookie. While I wouldn’t rank it as my favorite, it’s in the top 10. Perfect as written but easily adaptable for other dried fruit, seed, or nut preferences. This surprisingly turned out to be a big crowd pleaser at a party where a whole lot of other great homemade food was served. Maybe word just traveled faster among this group, but young women who are very health oriented, fitness minded seemed to crave this cookie. One said it was the best cookie she had ever tasted in her life . . . ummm, now that's serious kooky talk!!

Best cookies I have ever made!   Used oatmeal and raisins instead of flaxseed and choc chips as I didn't have them.  Easy to make and suburb results.

I love this recipe because it is very flexible with the ingredients. I replaced the 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips with 1 cup of yogurt covered raisins and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips (cause it was what I had in my cupboard) and they tasted great! I also took half of the recipe and portioned out the dough to freeze. I used wax paper to separate the raw cookies from smashing together. I did 5 raw cookies about an inch apart from each other and made 4 rows, then put another piece of wax paper on top and rolled  it into a log. I placed it into a zip lock freezer bag. When I want fresh cookies I just take out a few and bake them in my toaster oven. They still tasted as good as they did the day I mixed the dough! I love fresh out of the oven cookies! Thank you for posting & sharing  this recipe!

This has become my family's favourite cookie recipe.  I make it all the time and used to send it off with my daughters to their University residence where it was a big hit - everyone asks for these cookies.
My youngest daughter is gluten-free so I substituted the flour for gluten-free flour and substituted the whole wheat flour for more flax seed meal.  I also skip the white sugar as the cookies are sweet enough with the brown sugar.  They're so delicious!

Yummy cookie, a big hit, we will definitely be making these again! I used my #50 scoop and got 44 cookies that baked in 12 minutes on Silpat lined sheets. I rough chopped the rolled oats, cranberries, coconut and pumpkin seeds in my mini chopper just to have a finer texture. I used Robin Hood Omega 3 + Fiber flour for the whole wheat flour and flax seeds. 1/4 cup measure yielded 23 cookies baked in 15 minutes. We like sunflower seeds over the pumpkin seeds.
I had some coconut oil, which I used for half the butter, even better, it really bumps up the coconut taste, normally I am not a big fan of coconut but it really compliments the cookie.

Tasty, rustic, chewy cookie. I used pumpkin seeds with shells on, because I had them, and I liked the extra roughage.

I loved these cookies.  I rarely bake so when I do I want good results and this cookie delivered.  I wasn't crazy about the idea of coconut but a couple people on the Buzz encouraged me to use it saying that it contributes only to texture and they were right.  I couldn't taste it but I'm glad I used it.  I swapped out the pumpkin seeds for sliced almonds but this recipe would lend itself to any number of fruit/seed/nut combinations.  Great recipe, Westcoastmom! **Updated 3/6/14** I made these last night and substituted 1/2 the butter for coconut oil and they were fantastic!  I'll make them this way from now on for the health benefits of the coconut oil.

I hate to mess up a recipe, but when I began I realized the pumpkin seeds I had weren’t as fresh as I’d like so I substituted walnuts.  Also, I didn’t have as many dried cranberries as I thought so I added a few raisins to make up the difference.  So despite my fudging things in the beginning, these came out fabulous.  It was a big hit with the family.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Another stellar review for these cookies. I didn't have pumpkin seeds so I used sliced almonds I had on hand. I actually liked these better with time. Hubs liked them, too, so I will be making them again! Thanks, westcoastmom!

Very good, easy to make, bake up nice, perfect bake time in my convection oven.  I did make a few modifications, coconut butter for the fat, oat bran replaced flax meal and almond extract rather than vanilla.  They smell fantastic before the timer went off.  Will definitely make these again.

This is a really good cookie. If you aren't worried about keeping it nut free then add coarsely chopped cashews. Otherwise I follow the recipe exactly as written.

Really good, especially to send to school, as they're nut-free.  I used some of the cook's notes (left out the white sugar and used quick oats).  They turned out great and I will make again - love that this recipe makes a big batch - no need for me to double, and that there are so many substitutions you can make based on what's in your pantry.

Now this is a good cookie!!  The recipe is adaptable to individual tastes..I went with extra chocolate chips and dried cranberries and used Oat Bran in place of the flaxseed meal.  The author of this recipe thoughtfully included suggestions for substitutions and baking directions. Thank you Westcoastmom for a wonderful treat.

These are fantastic! I had a little apple sauce in the fridge so I added that, and did not add coconut. Otherwise I used the recipe as is and they are excellent!!

These cookies are SO good! I used 1 1/4 cups of  coconut sugar instead of any of the other sugar called for in the recipe and I added walnuts, sunflower seeds and omitted the craisins. I made them huge and thick. Delicious!!

Delicious cookie! I didn’t have flaxseed so I used wheat germ. I also used white chocolate chips. This recipe is a favourite in my house.

Very good cookie. I made a half recipe with slight changes and got 24 good-sized healthy tasting yet decadent cookies. My only substantive comments are that you might want to double the salt, and I think they’d be too sweet if you actually used the white sugar (I did not). I used sunflower seeds instead of pepitas and added 1/4 cup chopped almonds; the sunflower seeds were delicious but the nuts were unnecessary. The recipe also adapted fine to the basic high altitude changes I always have to make. I did make two minor changes to increase the “healthiness”: I used all white whole wheat flour, and I decreased the butter to 1/3 cup with a few tablespoons of yogurt making up the rest. Those changes were fine, but since the recipe made more cookies than expected I might increase the butter back to 1/2 cup.

Made some variations, I used cocoa nibs instead of chocolate chips, raisins instead of cranberries walnuts instead of pumpkin seeds and ground chia seed instead of flax meal ! Great cookies, chewy and versatile based on what you have on hand!

I omitted the white sugar and added a bit of molasses. Also added currants instead of cranberries and some sesame seeds. I think next time I would add some nuts as well. I was looking for a real hearty recipe similar to one I tasted 8 years ago. This was close but not quite. IT was a good cookie and I will make it again

Oops !  Forgot to add the chocolate chips, and they were still amazing !  Love it the way the recipe is, or it would be easy to tweak to personal tastes.  Could maybe use slightly less sugar.  Definitely a keeper .

Great wholesome cookie that is flexible with the ingredients, used sunflower seeds instead of  the pumpkin seeds as I only had those on hand. Cut the white sugar down to 1/4 cup and still delicious! Enjoy the recipe! It's a keeper!

This recipe is great! It gets lots of great comments when I bring them to work! In place of 2tsp vanilla, I used one of each: vanilla and coconut extract. Then I added coconut to the batter! Yummy

Solid recipe.  I replaced the Papitas with Sunflower seeds. Cut back on the sugar by about 1/8 cup and they were still plenty sweet. Also added some candied Ginger and roasted walnuts. Cut butter in half by substituting 1/2 cup coconut oil. Yum!

Really wholesome cookies! The only change I will make next time is to omit the white sugar. They are plenty sweet enough with the brown sugar and chocolate chips for my taste.

These are excellent and it's so easy to substitute with what you have on hand. I definitely recommend omitting the white sugar. They are plenty sweet enough with just the brown sugar. Based on what I hand in my pantry, I used dried cherries and sunflower seeds instead of cranberries and pumpkin seeds. I also used Egg Beaters instead of regular eggs. We are a nut-free family and I was very excited to find this recipe! These were perfectly baked at 12 minutes.

Very good - I could taste the coconut, but must not have been very strong as didn't seem to offend the coconut-hater of the household. Sugar can be reduced slightly, although doesn't absolutely need to be, in my opinion.

We really enjoyed making these cookies.The only changes we made are that we added walnuts and we did not have any coconut or pumpkin seeds put in so those were left out. The cookies were delicious! Thank you for posting this recipe.

Good recipe but too sweet for our taste.  Next time will cut sugar down drastically. Substituted Turbinado sugar for white sugar since we love the big crystals in cookies.  Also substituted 1/2 C coconut butter for regular butter. I toasted the pumpkin seeds - NOT a good idea.  They burn easily and do not need the extra roasting - they cook enough as the cookies bake.  I always add large crystal sea salt last as it gives little bursts of salt in the cookies which my husband discovered and we do with all cookie recipes.  It is definitely a wooden spoon recipe as the batter gets very stiff with the final additions.  Be sure to use a big bowl!

Great hardy cookie, good flavor. You could use any dried fruit or seeds.
