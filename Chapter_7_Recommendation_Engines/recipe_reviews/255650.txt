Excellent! I used Mrs. Dash because I didn't have Rosemary.  It was spicy. Next time, I would skip the pepper considering that Mrs. Dash has pepper in it.  Also, I used fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned sauce. Next time, I would add the tomatoes earlier with the onions to make the soup richer and thicker as the tomatoes would break down better. Overall,  very well received by everyone, even those who claim to dislike zucchini! :-)

Quick, easy, and tasty. I used spinach instead of zucchini, because that's what I had.

This was my first time making minestrone and I loved it! There were a few things that went wrong that were my fault, not the recipe's, but I'll share them anyways. I didn't have rosemary or parsley, so I just omitted them. instead of Contadina Tomato Sauce, I had to use a jar of mushroom-flavoured Ragu sauce that, honestly, just didn't taste very good. I also didn't have chicken broth, or any kind of broth (I really should've gone shopping beforehand) so I used water mixed with soya sauce, since I read online that that was a good substitute. Let me tell you, it's not, if you don't have broth you're probably just better off going to the store or making this another day. I played around with the spices a little bit until I got a flavour I liked. I used kidney beans instead of the kind the recipe recommended and this worked out very well. I also cut up half of a large zucchini since I didn't have celery, taste great. The last thing I'll say is that it might be a good idea to slightly pre-cook the pasta, since mine seemed to take a really long time to cook and eventually I just left it slightly undercooked because I didn't want to ruin the rest of it. All in all, loved this recipe and can't wait to make it again!

Even for someone like myself who is newly learning to cook, the recipe was fairly simple to follow. I added flat noodles instead of the smaller ones because that is what I had available. I omitted the carrots (don't like em') and may have been a bit heavy handed with the onions and garlic. I also added an allspice ball and used vegetable oil instead of olive (again, what I had available). I lost a lot of my water and broth to prepping vegetables (while cooking instead of before) and also because I decided to throw some dumplings in. I ended up with a delicious minestron(ish) medley. I was skeptical about the parmesan but that was also a nice addition taste wise. Thanks for the idea!

I omitted the rosemary.
