My whole family loved this recipe!  I substituted tortilla chips in place of the taco shells.  It turned out great!

This was really good, and so easy! I used the entire rotisserie chicken rather than just two cups worth. I also went ahead and used an entire jar of Goya salsa verde; it's just a bit more than 1.5 cups. Since I used a little more salsa I made sure to add a touch more sour cream too. Instead of taco shells I used ten La Banderita tostadas. Next time I think I'll try using some Queso Blanco instead of Monterey Jack.

We just liked this recipe. It is easy and ingredients are economical. It came out dry...I used regular old chicken I cooked and shredded myself at home. The deli rotisserie chicken might have made it less dry. If you can't get to the deli like me, maybe a can of cream 'o chicken soup would make it less dry! That's what I'm going to add to this next time I make it...which will probably be soon because I still have all the ingredients to do it again!
