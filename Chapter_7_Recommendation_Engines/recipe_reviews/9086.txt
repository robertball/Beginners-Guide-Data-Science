I have never cooked a squash in my life and halfway through trying to chop through the darned thing without losing a finger I decided that this was one recipe that I'd never make again.  Its just not worth losing a limb over, you know?  But after the dust had settled and I had my first bite of this amazing concoction, I had to change my mind.  THIS IS DEFINITELY WORTH LOSING A FINGER. Maybe even two.  This was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend following the recipe and using toasted pecans, fresh parsley, and butter - you won't regret it.  
Thank you, Christine L.!!!!

This was a great recipe.  I have only tasted "sweet" squash recipes before, and didn't really like them.  I cut the butternut in half and put a little butter, olive oil, and s&p on and baked at 400 for about 30 minutes.  This made it very easy to peel and cube.  Then added to the onions etc. and just sauteed til totally tender.  Delicious.

This recipe was very easy and amazing.  I added a little bit of ground ginger and ground coriander to the butter before cooking the onions.  Also, I recommend serving this with freshly grated cheese on top.  I used asiago and parmesan.

I made some health-conscious changes (margarine instead of butter, fewer nuts), added some dried cranberries for color and texture, coarsely chopped my onion, sprinkled on a light dusting of cinnamon, and used dried parsley (all I had).  The recipe turned out very good, and the presentation was very aesthetic.  The contrast of orange squash, deep red cranberries and a hint of green parsley is beautiful.

Delicious!  Peel with a vegetable peeler for ease, forget nuking in the micro, it makes the squash too smooshy.  Don't fiddle with the seasonings, it's perfect the way it is!!!

Am absolute hit for potlucks!
I made it twice, and have always gotten many compliments. 
My changes on the basic recipe: olive oil for butter -- as most people on those potlucks were vegan; I also followed a reviewer's advice and baked it for 30 minutes (makes it easier to peel and cut in cubes). It's worth paying close attention to the baking point and not using too much water on the bottom of the baking sheet (or none at all), as that could render too much water on the cooking pan later. 
I also made more than recipe calls. For a 22-serving dish the customized recipe calls for 6 1/4 lb squash. I instead used 11 lb, also put more pecans, and voila. What a success.

Excellently memorable. Hubs and I travel extensively which means we eat in many, many restaurants all over the country. I can say with experience that most restaurants don't take the extra steps as this recipe does with the "lowly" vegetable. Beautiful in its simplicity, this is fresh and flavorful, not loaded down with tons of spices, sugar or any of a myriad of other distracting additions.  The cooking method is different but easy - peeling the squash is no big deal with a simple vegetable peeler, no more difficult than peeling a potato. I added a bit of fresh sage and minced garlic but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written.  Beautiful with its brightly colored chunks of squash contrasted with the toasted nuts and flecks of green parsley. The "lowly" squash doesn't take a back seat with this recipe!

Using an acorn squash instead, I baked it so that the flesh was soft, and therefore, the dish was more of a squash mash. I added dried cranberries on someone else's recommendation, and I think it was this touch that put it up to a 4 star rating for me. The nuts are awesome, especially with the cranberries and parsley. Excellent!

This is such a wonderful, simple, different, and delicious recipe!  My husband swore that he hated squash and would not eat it no matter what.  This recipe changed everything for him, and he now loves all kinds of squash, new vegetables, etc.  It's easy to get stuck in a rut with squash and always do the same thing.  This is a refreshing change, yet it's still so simple and familiar.  Yum!!!

This was very tasty. I did change things a little bit. I used less butter than called for and curt back on the pecans as well. I added garlic and right at the end, a little dash of cayenne pepper. The spiciness with the nuts and the slightly sweet taste of the squash worked well. Thanks for the recipe. Next time i think I might go a bit heavier on the onion

Just a note: I think this same recipe is on the site twice by the same submitter. Anyway, I've served this dish every Thanksgiving since 2003 and it's always a hit. Make it as-written the first time and then adjust if you see fit. It's delcious as-is. Here are some simple things you can do to make this dish a success with less work: 1) Buy the pre-cut butternut squash--your pieces will be the same size and will be more likely to cook evenly. 2) You can't always substitute dried parsley for fresh and you shouldn't in this dish. It won't be as good, so don't blame the recipe and rate it lower if you do this and don't care for it. Use FRESH! 3) Microwaving the squash first to par cook it as another reviewer mentioned is an excellent idea. But, if you don't, no worries. Stir frequently and keep covered...lower your temperature if it starts to stick or cook too quickly. The recipe calls for low heat and that's important. Lower and slower works well for me. It's ok if some of the pieces cook more than others, it gives it a creaminess that my guests enjoy. 4) If you use a nonstick skillet, you can reduce the amount of butter, it's a very buttery dish.

Very good. Thank you for the recipe.
 May I add something for those of us who do the cooking.---For the squash--stick a sharp knife into it several places thru the skin & put it in the microwave for a few min. It will get a bit soft THEN  slice into 1" or so rounds  THEN peal. It will save a lot of time!!!

Great comfort food!  I kept the same ingredients, but just fried everything.  I left out the parsley.  Delicious!

I think this is about the most delicious way you could possibly cook squash. If I could, I'd give it a 4.5 star rating.  Through no fault of the recipe, it failed to catch on with my family.  I will probably still make it for myself because I really liked it.  My only complaint is that the toasted pecans are SOOOO good, but then they get soggy after a couple of hours if you sprinkle them on the dish.  I think they need to be kept seperate until the dish is served - even if you have leftovers. Warm up the leftovers, and THEN add the pecans so that hearty crunch is still present.  The texture contrast of the crispy pecans with the soft squash is wonderful.

I make a similar recipe.  Saute bacon pieces, remove bacon saving for garnish.  Saute onion and squash in bacon fat.  Use fresh sage over the parsley.

So delicious! I nuked the squash in the microwave for 10 minutes or so to soften it so it wasn't so hard to peel and chop. I also let the onions caramelize a bit. A real hit! I never know what to do besides mash w/butter and salt (I hate squash/sweet potato recipes with sweet ingredients) and now I have something new! Thanks!

I followed the recipe, just added some olive oil with the butter, and I cooked it for a half an hour instead of 15 minutes because I like the squash real soft, it was fabulous, the onions got carmelized and I  got rave reviews from visiting family members, it like melts in your mouth.

Outstanding way to prepare Butternut Squash.  If you are a Sam's Club or Costco shopper, they have 2lb trays of precubed squash this time of year. This makes preparation non-existent.  If you can, substitute a couple of good sized shallots for the onion.  Otherwise, don't change a thing. Great way to prepare squash.

I used sliced almonds instead of pecans and added some garlic to the mix... and microwaved the squash first to get it cooked ... added the squash to the onions and butter and almonds, which I toasted in the oven (yum) and mashed them together then baked in the oven till heated through - topped with more toasted almonds.

Everyone raved about this recipe and it will become a favorite to take to family gatherings!

I've made this dish several times now and my whole family loves it! The recipe is 5 stars as is, and the adjustments I've made are minor. I microwave the cubed butternut squash in a covered dish for a 3 minutes to speed up the cooking a bit. And I sometimes throw a handful of dried cranberries in, or used walnuts instead of pecans when that was all I had on hand.

This recipe is very good.  I ended up slowly sauteeing it for a long time, and it was tender and tasty.  It was easy to adapt to my tastes; I like some salt and pepper.  Next time I make it, I think I'll add some ginger, too.  To peel the squash, I cut it in half the long way (stem to blossom) and after cleaning out the seeds, I laid it down, cut side down and cut it into 1 to 2 inch wide slices.  I then was able to slip a paring knife under the skin and remove it quickly.  It only took a few minutes to peel it that way.  I'll definitely make it again.

Excellent! The sauteed onions and roasted pecans really make this dish.  Next time, I might try it with olive oil instead of butter (just to save on the saturated fat).

I just made this recipe using the squash I had originally bought for fall decorations! Wow, am I glad I didn't pitch these out for the woodland critters to eat up. This is delicious!! A wonderful, nutty flavor and just plain great! I followed the recipe exactly and loved it. I used a potato peeler to peel the skin,  cut it in half to remove the seeds, then cubed it for cooking, very easy and I still have all 10 fingers!

Had never tried Butternut Squash and this was the perfect recipe for first time.  Thanks for posting Christine. We can not eat pecans so after cooked added a little cinnamon - turned out great.  Used other posting suggestion to peel with veggie peeler before cutting and seeding and worked out great

Spectacular!  Made exactly as directed this recipe is perfect!  It is a unique way to cook butternut squash, and it was a wonderful complement to herbed pork roast from this site.  For those concerned about peeling a squash, I find that cutting a one inch piece from the top and bottom of the squash for stability makes it very easy to use a serrated vegetable peeler for the task.

This dish is really good and I would serve it for company.  The toasted pecans really make the dish.  Be sure not to skip the toasting step.  I'm not sure that I will put the parsley in next time.  It makes it pretty, but I don't think added to the taste.

I cooked this tonight as a side with chicken. I added an extra half onion, omitted the pecans (didn't have any on hand), and used Smart Choice at half the amount called for of butter. I did microwave my squash cubes twice for four minutes each time and with 1/4 cup water in the bottom of the bowl to soften them a bit before saute. Everyone complimented me on them except my five year old but he only eats PB&J so we won't count him  :)

This did not turn out well at all for me... The squash did not get tender, even when I pre-cooked it to aid in the peeling. Not much flavor either... The toasted pecans were the best part!

This was my first experience with butternut squash and I served it at a family buffet supper.  It was tasty, but I think a new flavor for most of my deep-south family and went over so-so.  Everyone thought it was sweet potatoes before they tasted it.

I substituted olive oil for the butter as it's healthier.  It was nice to find a recipe that didn't have brown sugar.

This was very tasty.  I am not very familiar with squash so I was thrilled to find such a tasty recipe.  I cut in half, seeded, rubbed with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Baked 400 for 30-35 min.  cut skin off and cubed, then tossed with the sauteed onions and butter.  At the end, added the pecans (loved the chopped kind - lots of little bits of goodies) - but didn't toast them.  i almost didn't add the pecans because I didn't want to waste them on something I wasn't sure I would like but they really brought it all together.  Salt a bit more at the end and YUM!

This had a wonderful aroma, but for me, the sweet squash with the onions wasnt somethng I wanted to eat too much of. It was a nice flavor, but after a few bites, was just too much.

Good easy recipe.  After I peeled my squash I baked it in the oven while I toasted the pecans.  Nice alternative from a sweeter squash dish.

Very good. Use a sturdy vegetable peeler then slice and cube. Is best w/ butter but I reduced by a TBSP. When cooking butternut squash, be generous w/ the salt and pepper. I added garlic and at others suggestions, coriander, ginger, & parmesan. Is beautiful served over rice & paired w/ a green veggie.

This is a great recipe.  The flavors all come out and blend together so nicely, and the toasted pecans also add crunch.  And it's so pretty!!  I used buttercup squash, and it turned out just fine.  I've never cut up squash before, so I didn't know what I was getting into.  Perhaps it could be softened in the oven first.  Wonderful for this time of year.

When I was making this recipe I thought it would be bland, oh! was I surprised.  I loved the simplicity of ingredients and they didn't overpower the squash.  I had about a quart left over since it's just my husband and I, so I decided to add blue cheese to it and make ravioli with a brown butter sauce.  Great  side dish, with enough left overs to make a second dinner.  Love this recipe.

Pecans are rare and expensive in Indonesia, so I replaced them with fried red-skin peanuts and added a dash of cinnamon.  The result was quite good and even my family, who had never tried squash of any kind before, liked the flavor.  We give it a thumbs up.

I think the taste of the squash would be better if this recipe was roasted in the oven. Did not care for taste of the pecan.

I believe I used to large of an onion and didn't chop it small enough ... but even without this mistake I don't understand why everyone loves this recipe. My boyfriend and I both felt it needed brown sugar and cinnamon, which would make it more like a sweet potatoe pie.

I thought this was really good and I liked not having to cook the squash for an hour.  I cut it up in small chunks like others advised and it worked out great!  Thanks for the recipe :)

We split on this one. 2 for 2 against. I felt the squash needed some sweetness added. The flavor was boring. Looked nice. Not giving up on butternut squash, but this recipe wasn't for me.

I loved it! I had to use dried parsley out of necessity. Be sure that you don't cut the squash pieces too large because it will increase the cooking time. Next time, I'll double the recipe and serve it with plain couscous. This is a nice meatless dish.

A lot of work for very little flavor. Not a hit, but just okay- won't make again.

I love squash and I am always looking for new ways to make it.  I loved this and the only thing I did differently was add some garlic and ceyenne pepper.  I am giving this a 4* rating because my husband didn't like it (he doesn't like winter squash that much, so only a feew recipes make the grade for him) but for me it was a 5.

Delicious! I didn't have as much butternut squash as called for, but I had some freshly cooked pumpkin in the fridge, and just made up the difference with that. I also used less onion for my personal taste.
