I prepared everything except the frosting the night before I went to a family breakfast. When I opened the carrier the next morning to put on the frosting, I swear, the smell was like a little bit of heaven. 

The fresh lemon in the recipe just kicks the taste of the cupcakes into overdrive. The combination of flavors mingles pleasantly and yes, it is reminiscent of raspberry iced tea. 

Everyone at the breakfast asked for the recipe so I'd say these are a huge hit all the way around!

I made these last year for a brunch for my mother and mother-in-law.  They were delicious and everyone couldn't stop raving about them.  Well worth all the time and effort.  I did use fresh raspberries instead of frozen because that is what I had on hand, and it still turned out fine.

This recipe is delicious! However, I had to tint my frosting to a pink because it was a weird reddish/brown and did not look pleasing. I ran out of time with the filling so i used it as a drizzle(big hit) and i substituted the creme de menthe with regular mint extract.

Recipe after recipe, I've failed at creating the perfect cake/cupcake. And seeing how this recipe only had 4 reviews, I was hesitant to try. But boy am I glad to have taken that leap of faith. They were a huge hit with the crowd when I brought them to a July 4th BBQ party. Granted, I didn't use the entire recipe and tweaked the cake part of the recipe based on what I had on hand. But the result was scrumptious.

SUBSTITUTIONS:
- Vanilla instant pudding mix
- orange juice instead of lemon (not as strong a flavor, but figured put it in there so the amount of liquid is consistent)
- frosting: strawberry frosting from All About Cupcakes
- 18 minutes in a convection oven

RESULTS:
- could be more moist
- a little bit on the sweet side, so next time I'll probably cut the sugar by some
- Overall: 5 stars :)

the cake turned out pretty good, I used one cup whole wheat flour and its pretty different but it was good. I made them the night before and made the filling and icing the next morning and neither of them turned out right. I think the filling was too close to the stove and got warm and flopped but that shouldn't affect the way it goes into the cake right? I tried inserting the tip of the icing bag and no filling went into the cake... so I left it out. and the icing never got stiff! was it because I left out the tea powder? other than that I followed the icing recipe to the dot, I don't know what happened?!

I made this cupcake for a client for her wedding and it was not very good.  The cake itself was delicous but the mint filling and the frosting was unappealing. This was just not what my client was looking for.

These were absolutely delicious! They got rave reviews from everyone who had one, and I've been inundated with demands for more ever since.

I couldn't find raspberry lemonade concentrate so I substituted strawberry lemonade and put a half strawberry on top instead of a raspberry. Regardless, this is a recipe I will make again and again.

I made these a couple years ago for a friend's baby shower & forgot to review.  They are amazing!  Absolutely delicious and I didn't change anything.

Delicious! They are more work than your average cupcake recipe, but the extra touches like the cream filling and interesting flavors make them perfect for a special occasion. I made these for my friend's bridal shower and copied the decorating from the picture posted by another reivewr and they turned out great. Everyone thought I had bought them from a fancy bakery.
