I've now made this a couple of times and recommend the following changes: Scale the recipe (if necessary), triple the sauce, double the garlic, add some italian seasoning, melt Mozarella on top instead of the Romano. Delicious! I look forward to making this many, many more times.

These stuffed meat shells are so good!  They are very creamy and full of flavor.
The only thing that I added was about 1/2 box of chopped spinach to the mixture.  (My husband isn't wild about cooked spinach, but what he doesn't know, won't hurt him  LOL)!  I have tried other stuffed meat shell recipes, and they just didn't taste right.  This one is a keeper!  I will definately make this again.  Thanks!

I only used 1 & 1/2 lbs of meat. I added some chopped onions (probably about 1/2 cup, maybe more) to the hamburger mixture, omitted the egg & garlic salt & increased the minced garlic. After hamburger was cooked, I deglazed the pan w/ about a 1/2 cup or so of pinot grigio (it's what I had open) & quickly reduced it down by half. This helped add flavor & moisture to the mix. I added about half a pkg. of chopped, frozen but thawed spinach, as well as some basil, oregano & parmesan cheese when I added the cream cheese ( I decreased the cheese some per other reviews) & pasta sauce. I had some mixture leftover so I stuffed some manicotti shells & froze them. I topped the shells w/ mozzarella before baking & a little romano & fresh chopped parsley after baking. These were delicious! I thought the wine added a nice dimension to the dish. I'm eager to try it w/ some italian sausage w/ the hamburger...thanks Cara!

Delicious! i used 1 lb ground turkey.  the original recipe calls for 3 lbs meat, i think thats why other reviews state its too dry and i think 1 box of shells would NEVER be enough for 3 lbs of meat. i also added 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper, 1 chopped onion and about 1TBS of italian seasoning while the meat was cooking. FYI~there is no need to cook the shells before stuffing.  cooked pasta is a bit hard (for me) to handle.  take the cooking time for the pasta (10 mins) and add it to the baking time (45 minutes total should do it)~cover with foil the first 30 minutes and top with cheese and bake uncovered 15 more and it is just GREAT!

I just made this last night for myself and my husband, following the recipe exactly. This produces an enormous amount of food! However, the shells freeze and re-heat easily. It was definitely a hit. However, I felt like I needed more pasta sauce - maybe 2 jars instead of 1. The shells were not completely covered. This tastes delicious and was really easy to make.

I only used about 3/4 lb ground meat and about 1/2 box stove top stuffing mixed into the cooked meat mixture.  That really put it over the edge and gave it great flavor!  Needs more sauce too.

This is a wonderful recipe! I added a few extra spices like sweet basil, oregano and a lot more garlic.  My family LOVED the finished product and has requested it again in the same weeek.  The cream cheese adds a creamy texture that makes it unique to most shell recipes.

Excellent! These shells were awesome, the cream cheese really gave them that extra little tang. The only thing I did was add a little oregano to the meat mixture. Delicious I can't wait to make these again!

This came out pretty good. Makes a lot. I split the recipe and froze half of it for later. I only used about 2 1/2 lbs of hamburger and it still made plenty. I added more garlic and fresh parsley. My husband and kids really liked it. I would use more sauce next time also and maybe used multiple cheese on top.

These were absolutely DELICIOUS! I did make a few changes, but nothing life-shattering, lol. I used 1-1/2 pounds lean ground beef that I browned with 1/2 pound italian sausage, some chopped onion, the garlic, garlic powder, parsley, salt and pepper (I did omit the oil). Once that was all cooked I drained it and allowed it to cool. Then I mixed it with the softened cream cheese (I used light), the sauce, 1 egg and some parmesan cheese. This mixture filled 32 shells for me, which was plenty (I froze some, uncooked, for other dinners). Instead of topping with the romano, I topped them with parmesan and mozzarella. I covered them and baked them @ 350 degrees for 30 minutes. I then uncovered them and baked about 15-20 minutes more...PERFECT, IMO. My family raved over these, they were SOOOOO GOOD (and easy)! I will be making these many, MANY more times! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very unimpressive. A glorified (and much more expensive) version of Italian Style Hamburger Helper. Essentially a good meal, but be prepared to seriously tweak ingredients and amounts (specifically increase cream cheese, decrease meat and be creative with seasonings; even a novice in the kitchen would be able to come up with 25 ways to improve upon beef seasonings).

THis is SO great and easy to make ahead. I used the NEW baking cream cheese that just came out and it was fantastic. Also used a combination of sweet Italian Sausage and ground veal instead of beef. I think this would work well with ANY Ground meat.  It's a great recipe....

My favorite recipe I've found on this website yet!  Very easy to make... I did take the advice of others and dropped the meat to 2 lbs instead of 3 lbs and I added a little more cream cheese and definitely more pasta sauce.  Great tasting too:)  Thanks for a great one!

I took the suggestion of others to add italian seasoning, I also put fresh basil leaves on top. I would recommend mixing ingredents together in bowl with meat before cooking.

These shells are a bit of work, but so worth it!  They were so delicious, my mother-in-law asked me for the recipe; she is a cook and I'm just a novice in the kitchen.  :)  I am hungry just thinking about making them again.

quick, easy but needs more moisture. I added garlic, italian spices, and some parm cheese to the filling. Next time will use more (double?) the amount of sauce for the top.

Wow!  These were really great!  A few minor additions - I also added healthy pinches of oregano & basil and only used 1 pound of ground beef.  We truly enjoyed these~thanks for sharing the recipe!

We loved this recipe! My husband hates Italian food but he went back for second and thirds for this one. I only used a pound of ground beef and still had more than enough.

Will definitely make again.  I used cream cheese straight out of the fridge and combined with drained beef.  Everything was creamy in just a few minutes.

My family really likes this dish, but with the following changes.  I use 1# of ground Italian sausage instead of the burger and I drain well before mixing the ingredients.  I also add 1 box of frozen spinach, with the water squeezed out well.  I use 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic and 2 jars of spaghetti sauce to get enough to go in the filling and over the shells.  I also add extra cheese to the top, after I put the sauce on.

Pretty good! While I don't think these are "the world's best shells," they will be a decent addition to my regular rotation nonetheless. The cream cheese adds just enough texture to make these unique. The garlic (doubling is a MUST) lends superb flavor. I bet these would freeze well, but because stuffed shells aren't my hubby's "thing" (he's out of town so at least he didn't have to "suffer" thru tonight's dinner lol!), I scaled back. Even so, I had MORE than enough to feed my parents and I. My only other changes were to use the full amount of garlic / garlic salt called for, substitute Italian blend cheese for fresh grated Romano (store was out of the latter) and use an entire 24 oz. jar of sauce - 1/4 c. mixed with my meat / cream cheese and the rest scantly spread on the bottom of my baking dish (to prevent sticking) and atop my shells. I also drained the grease from my beef BEFORE adding my cheese / sauce to it (commone sense, IMHO). To appease my dad (he's on a heart-restrictive diet), I substituted reduced-fat cream cheese, lean sirloin, Prego's heart request traditional pasta sauce, 1/2 garlic powder / 1/2 salt substitute (to make up for high-sodium garlic salt) and reduced-fat cheese. You couldn't even tell that I "lightened" this up! My only regret is using too much sauce and skipping the Romano, but that's just me. Served with garlic butter crescents, salad, homemade (low-fat) Ranch dressing and a vanilla chip dessert. Thanks for sharing, Cara! :-)

Rule #1 of cooking...make sure you have everything you need for the recipe! : )   I thought I had shells but I was mistaken, so I turned this into a very tasty lasagna!  Thank you for sharing!  I will try to make the correct recipe next time!

Great recipe!  30 minute prep time, and my whole family loved it...including a husband who hates cream cheese and a daughter who won't eat ground meat!  I added grated parmesan cheese, oregano, & basil to the filling for a little more flavor.  It is definitely a keeper.

Split decision over this - S.O. loved it, I didn't. Changed almost everything - amount of meat (too much), amount of sauce (not enough), omitted egg, increased spices, etc. Seemed like alot of work for something just OK.

I loved the end result (and so did my family). But I did make some changes-2lbs instead of 3, added more garlic to the beef, drained it of course, omitted the egg, and added more mozzarella inside and on top of the shells, and used fresh grated parm cheese on top as well.  With those changes, I would give it 5 stars.

OK it's not even done cooking and I'm already giving it five stars - of course I added some things to it to make it extra yummy but this would have been good as written.  I did omit the eggs because I didn't think they were needed and added a lot of extra calories.  I added some hot italian sausage to ground beef to make 1.5lbs, more than enough for a 12 oz box of pasta.  I also omitted the garlic salt and added a total of 5tsp garlic instead.  I also added three large handfuls of baby spinach torn up into pieces a little, and about 1/4c parmesan to the mix.  It was so yummy I'm lucky it made it to the shells at all!  Even my 3 yr old thought it was yummy as is.  I had enough for two batches so I put one in the freezer and it should be great there!  Thanks for a great jumping off point - it made a special meal I am looking forward to serving to guests!!

This turned out very good.  Changes I made were:
 
To the mixture:
I used an entire head of garlic
added some Italian seasoning
added some romano cheese (before baking)
increased the cream cheese by 50%
 
 
I drained the beef, which isn't in the recipe.  You'd be nuts not to.
 
I think I had to bake a bit more than 15 minutes, but that's typical in my oven.

I have to agree with the other users... 3 lbs. of meat was too much.  I cut that in half and used the same amout of the other ingredients.  I also only used half a box of pasta since there was considerably less.  I also followed the others and baked it with Mozarella cheese on top.  My husband loved these.  Will make them again!

These were delicious!  They were pretty easy to make with the assistance of my boyfriend.  We made some changes though:  added a half onion, a small zucchini chopped finely, 1lb ground beef, 1lb ground turkey, italian seasoning, no garlic salt but 4 cloves of garlic, and italian cheese blend instead of just Romano.  We will have a ton of leftovers!!!!
Buy of bottle of Shiraz-Cabernet for an excellent compliment to this fantastic dish!

These turned out great.  I used a little extra sauce to cover the shells before baking.  I made this for my boyfriend and some friends, we stuffed ourselves silly and when I took the leftovers to work they were gone in a hurry!

Excellent. Insanely good the next day.

I also tried the suggestion about not cooking the shells, but I found them too hard when served up, although they had softened considerably when re-heated the next day. Next time, I will cook them before stuffing.
I agree that there is way too much stuffing vs sauce ratio.  I took the advice, used 1 lb of beef, along with 3 hot italian sausages, and still had plenty left over after stuffing the shells.  Added the left over stuffing in with 4 cups of the sauce to cover the shells. Sprinkled mozza on top and baked. This will become a family favourite.

I thought this was a good change from lasagna or spaghetti. I added spinach for extra nutrients (get 'em where you can with a toddler), cut back the cream cheese a little per other reviews, and I only  used 1 lb. of ground beef and I had plenty of mix to stuff the shells with. Thanks for the recipe, we'll make it again!

These were great.  I halved the recipe, but they still made a lot for just my huband and I.  He couldn't get enough of them, we ate them every day for 4 days!  I also made some cheese shells with a ricotta, mozarella and parmesean blend.  Yum.

I'm new to cooking and this was my first trial meal for the summer. The family LOVED it. We like cream cheese with just about everything. My mom can't wait till I make it again. It took a lot of running around the kitchen to make, but the effort was definitely worth it.

Awesome dish!  I used half hamburger meat and half Italian sausage.  I also mixed in mozzarella with the meat...Very good and easy..  I topped with about 2 cups of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Very good..I had to stuff the shells by hand.  Oh yeah, do not cook your shells to much they will be to flimsy to stuff.. I did mine just undercooked and they finished cooking in the oven...

I made this for a dinner party and took some advice from the other reviewers.  I used manicotti instead of shells.  I browned 1 lb lean ground turkey and 1 package sweet italian sausage with onion, garlic and italian seasoning since I had no fresh herbs.  I also used only 1 egg and did 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 ricotta.  I also used 2 1/2 jars of sauce.  I made it in advance and set in refrigerator for about 2 hours then cooked at 400 for 30 minutes covered, 15 minutes uncovered with last 5 on broil for the cheese.

This was really good, I doubled the sauce (I used Newmans Own Sauce, and it is wonderful), I added chopped spinach, extra garlic, and used Parm, and Mozz Cheese. Turned out wonderful! I love this recipe, it's a keeper.

I just made this for dinner, and I love it! I cut recipe in 1/2 and used 1 lb of ground beef. I found myself eating the meat mixture straight out of the bowl while I was stuffing the shells. The more meat the better. Great recipe!!

I've never attempted stuffed shells (mainly because I don't like ricotta cheese--so this was a good fit for me since it has cream cheese instead!).  This was absolutely delicious!!!  I did add some Italian seasoning to the mix as well as some shredded Italian cheese blend before stuffing the shells.  It was so good that I couldn't help but eat some of the filling before I even got all of the shells stuffed!  (The stuffing part was a little messy, but well worth it!)  My mouth was watering by the time these babies come out of the oven.  Will definitely make again!

These were good, but not "to die for".  I probably won't make them again, mainly because my kids weren't all that impressed.  Like most of the others, I cut back on the beef (2# instead of 3) and browned and drained it before adding the other ingredients.  I also added more garlic and some oregano and basil.  I used a 25 oz. jar of sauce instead of the recommended 14 oz., and it still could have used more sauce to cover.

This is a very good recipe, but I made some changes.  I can't imagine not browning the meat first and draining all the fat before adding the other ingredients to it...and I didn't add the egg until the end when all items are mixed together.  Also added basil and oregano to the mixture.

This recipe is really easy to make!!  BUT...  it looks very fancy once served.  I am not a very experienced cook and I got the oohs and ahhs when I made this for a dinner party!!!  Excellent and easy!

We did not like this recipe at all. It was all meat and pasta, no real flavor. I would have to put much more cream cheese in to really taste it with all that meat. It made sooo much, I had several pans of it, which I tried to doctor up at future meals with mozarella, parmesan, extra sauce, ricotta - but it still wasn't very good. Sorry.

My family loved this recipe.  We halved it and still had leftovers (and they are still just as good the next day!).  The cream cheese made this very rich but gave them a different taste that we loved.

This is my go to stuffed shell recipe.  I've made it countless times over the past few years, and every time I make it, it's a huge hit.  Whoever I make it for always asks for the recipe.  

I do scale the recipe down to 1 pound of ground beef, 1 egg, and 1 jar of pasta sauce. I also use whatever cheese I have on hand.

I made this recipe basically the same way except i halved the recipe. I used 1 lb hamburger, 1 jar pasta sauce and about half a box of shells. I also added a chopped onion to the hamburger meat, italian seasoning, and i omitted the eggs. I topped it with italian cheese and cooked for 20 minutes.

This was absolutely delicious. Used 1b of ground chicken instead of beef. I toke other reviewer suggestions added sauteed onions to meat Omitted the eggs as this wasnt needed.  I also added spinach to cream cheese/meat mixture. added additional spices, Oregano, basil, ground peper  when cooking ground chicken and also extra sauce on the top and mozzarella cheese. Last 3mins put under the broiler

This was so good and so easy to make. Like other people who reviewed this I could not stop eating the filling while I was stuffing the shells. I did use way more sauce than the recipe called for even after I halved the recipe. Overall it was fantastic.

These are so amazing and my small children gobbled them up! One of the best recipes I have tried in awhile. I had to switch to Mozzarella instead of Romano because I was out out but it was still delicious and is going in my keeper box!
Eta - we had to switch to dairy and egg free and I've made this so many times, I've adjusted to suit us. I like it creamier so I use one lb ground beef with 8 oz vegan cream cheese, no egg. Increase the pasta sauce about 1 1/2-  2 cups (I dump and taste). No garlic salt but double garlic. Vegan almond cheese on top and a great meal! I have been asked for the recipe multiple times! You will use about 80% of the shells and more than enough for 6 servings!

Really very good! I used half ground beef and have italian sausage.  Not sure what the eggs add but i did use them.  I also added onions, dried oregano and basil to the meet mixture.  And i melted a mozzarella/parmasean mix on the top under the broiler...very delicious!

This was wonderful. Even my picky husband and daughter loved it. I made a couple changes: only used 2 lbs ground beef which was just enough for a 12 oz pk of shells and used 2 jars of sauce. Turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

My picky family absolutely LOVED these and my friends too. I made Texas garlic toast as a side item for it. The nice thing is if you half the recipe but use the same 12 oz amount of shells you have more than enough filling for the shells. I recommend buying a second jar of Spaghetti sauce though if your family likes things a little more saucy. Other than that KUDO's to the creator.

I did not like this recipe at all. I spent over $15 on the lean ground beef alone. I did add mozzarella cheese, but I love mozzarella and it works with almost all tomato pasta recipes. I think the cream cheese is what ruined it, it tasted very weird. It was an easy recipe, but was not worth the amount of cleaning required afterwards. Maybe it would be good if prepaired without the cream cheese. Anyway, I will not make this again.

This was SOOOO delicious! I used all of the cream cheese, and 1 lb of gr beef, and instead of parsley, I used Italian seasoning. I had plenty of filling, so I made extra shells and we have plenty of leftovers. Will definitely add this to my rotation of meals!!

These were delicious!  A nice twist on my mom's recipe that I've loved since childhood. I made a few changes though...I used about 1 pound of meat, I used 1/2 the cream cheese and added some ricotta cheese, I used mozz cheese instead of romano.  They were fantastic the next day, too!

Hello, My hubby & sons liked this recipe more than us girls did. Since i am rating it i will go with what I thought. 3lbs is to much meat i only used 1.5 lbs total. I used bulk & link sausage chopped in small pieces too. There also needed to be some cheese like ricotta, or shredded in with the meat to hold it together. I put foil over the 9X13 pan and baked in a 375 degree oven for 40 minutes, then removed the foil and heated 15 more minutes. I do want to try and make this again with more cheeses mixed into the meats. Have a great day!

These were tasty!  I cooked the shells for 5 minutes, not 10, which made them easy to stuff.  I covered with a jar and a half of sauce, and baked covered for 45 min.  I also used less ground beef- about a pound, pound and a half.  Wondering why to cook the egs with the beef tho....may mix them into the mixture after with the cream cheese.

My family gave this a 4.  The filling was yummy and pretty easy to make.  Like some of the others I put off making this because I thought it would be difficult to stuff the shells but it was surprisingly easy and quick.  I also took the advise of several others and left out the egg and increased the sauce and garlic.  I used a full 26 oz can of sauce - half in the filling and half on top and it turned out quite nice.  I also used mozzarella cheese because I didn't have any romano on hand.  I would probably make this again because it was easy to make and has simple ingredients, most of which I usually have on hand.

An extremely delicious recipe. I took advice from other reviewers and left out the egg, also adding chopped baby spinach on top of dish with a bit of grated cheese. Extra yummy!! Even great the next day. Everyone loves this one.

We loved this recipe. I used half Italian sausage and half hamburger I also added about 1/4 of the Ramono cheese to the filling. I also used extra sauce as other's recommended. We live in a rural area, and the grocery store ususally doesn't have "speciality" pasta so I used Manicotti instead.

Very impressive!  I reduced the portions and substituted seasoned salt for the garlic salt.  I also added some spinach and oregano.  Came out excellent and I still had enough to freeze for another meal!

This recipe was wonderful.  I scaled down the recipe for 4 people and it was a perfect amount for 2 people with a little left over.  Will make again!!

I used 1.5lbs instead of 3 and had PLENTY of meat in each shell. I omitted the eggs since they really are only used as a binding ingredient and unneccesary if you are using cream cheese versus ricotta. I also added a pkg of chopped spinach, drained. I think I could have gotten away with half a pkg of cream cheese as well. Overall, very tastey.

I made this the other night.  I also made a few alterations based on some of the other reviews.  But basically the same.  My family loved it!  My 10 year old son suggested putting the meat and cream cheese mixture over nachos.  We may try that soon!

This was pretty good, when my (Italian)Hubby found out I was putting cream cheese instead of Ricotta cheese in the shells he was a bit skeptical, I did add the spinach to the mix, my kids loved it. My hubby said it was 4 stars so I will make it again, It does make a lot for left overs. Thanks

This was delicious.  My husband loved it and brought it to share at work the next day, everyone raved.  I did add another 14oz can of sauce and some italian seasonings. I would omit the egg next time...don't see the necessity unless it was added raw to bind the meat but that isn't what the recipe calls for and the cream cheese binds just fine.  That cream cheese is really what makes the flavor exceptional.  I will definitely make it again, probably but not for quite a while as I was able to freeze plenty.  Think I'll add a little spinach and some italian sausage next time

The pasta was delicious!  I used an entire box of shells and one whole block of cream cheese.  The recipe made 1 1/2 dishes so I shared with a homebound friend.  Her family enjoyed it as well. I will be adding this recipe to my repetoire.

Delicious recipe; very filling.  Modified the recipe with more garlic, spicy Italian seasoning, and diced scallions.  Added more sauce on top (1 cup more).  Next tine I will add romano cheese to the filling as well as topping after baking.  Cooked an additional 8 minutes.  3 out of 3 smiling and content faces at the end of the meal. We would gladly prepare this for friends.

This dish was good, but a little rich. I followed suggestion of others & used less total meat (2lbs) and also used 1/2 ground sausage in place of all ground beef. Next time I make this I think I'll decrease the amount of cream cheese to see if it helps with the richness. I did only use 1 egg as others suggested & added some Italian seasoning for extra flavor. 

I would suggest draining your meat first before stirring in all the other ingredients to eliminate excess grease/oiliness. I will make this again even though it was just a little time consuming for my personal preference.

Great recipe & thanks!

My only modification is to use a pound of Italian sausage and a pound of ground beef. So delicious. It makes a lot of filling and I always end up eating about a cup of the filling by itself. It's just too good! But with the leftover filling, I will usually cook up some angel hair and mix it all together while it's still warm. This is so good.

This was great! Only changes I made, I used half ground beef and half pork sausage. Used a little Italian seasoning on the meat. Took other people's suggestions and doubled the pasta sauce on top of the shells. And put several handfuls of mozzarella cheese on top about 3 minutes before cooking time was up. Delicious, easy and had lots of leftovers!

Very good!  I added spinach and onions like others suggested, seasoned the beef( which i used about 1 1/2 lbs) and sauce with italian seasoning, and i didn't pour too much of remaining sauce over shells (just personal preference).  Very wonderful!!!

This was just awesome! I did as some others & used Italian sausage, added oregano, basil and also about 1 lb spinach, rinsed & drained. It turned out soooo good. Even my mother-in-law was raving about how great it tasted! I think next time I'll leave the eggs out. It tasted fine, but looked rather odd when cooking the Italian sausage.

These are wonderful!  I do add some spinach and omit the eggs, after making it a few times.  But even as written, it is excellent.

I love this dish.  If prepared as directed, it can even be a dish to-go or as picnic food.  I also prepare separately, so that each family member can decide the meat-to-sauce-to-pasta ratio.  We all love the creaminess.  The meat also is great for pizza topping.

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe.  I have another stuffed shells recipe from all recipes that I like much better.  It wasn't bad, it just didn't taste like italian too me all that much.  I didn't use Romano b/c I don't like, used Motzarella instead.  My husband said he liked it, but I don't think I'll make it again.  I'll stick with the other one that I have.

This was a good and easy recipe.  It really took very little effort and not much time at all.    I halved the recipe, but still used about 3 cups of sauce - we like lots of sauce on our pastas.  The halved recipe still made quite a bit!

These were really good. I may reduce amount of meat and add some ricotta next time, but hubby and son said they were excellent made as written. Very easy and for not much more effort than plain spaghetti you get a much more impressive end result.

While it was fairly easy to make, I have to say that the cream cheese gave the whole dish a slightly funny taste. I guess I'm just spoiled to ricotta cheese. Thank you, though.

This recipe was very good & it was easy to make as well.  I put Mozz. cheese on the top instead of Romano.  My kids loved this & both had "happy plates".

I hate to give a bad review, but this was just "ok". I topped  it with mozz. cheese to help, but it was pretty bland, even after adding more spices & garlic.  However I will try this again with some tweeks because it tasted much better the next day.

We thought this was 'alright'. I used 1.5 lbs of ground meat but still felt like I either should have used less meat or more cream cheese.

I found that this took a long time to assemble and lacked flavour.  I was disappointed that all that work was not appreciated by my family, as they usually enjoy pasta dishes.

Well, 3 pounds of meat would be WAY too much.  I used 2 lbs. and still had leftovers.  Also, it needs to bake longer than 15 minutes.  I would also use a tad more sauce or add some water to it.  It was good.  I would make it again.

Very nice - followed the advice of others and did not pre cook the pasta - was a fun activity for my kids and a very tasty dinner as well.  needed a little extra water as well as the sauce when cooking.  will be making this again.

Thanks for this great recipe.  I've never made stuffed shells because I though the time required was longer, but this was quick and easy.  I love how cream cheese was used instead of ricotta.  My hubby and finicky 3 year old daughter enjoyed it too!

This was fantastic. My husband and I loved it!! I did omit the egg and used half sausage as other reviews suggested. I also added mozzarella cheese instead. You do need extra sauce, but I used an alfredo instead of marinara and you will not believe how awesome that makes this recipe. We will definitely be making this again!

This receipe is very good, however, I recommend to add a little more sauce to the meat.  It was a little dry.  If you add a little more sauce, it would be excellent.  My husband really liked it other than not enough sauce.  What I like the most is being able to change the serving sizes.  That is the best feature.  My boss even thought that it was a great idea.... Way to go.....

First, I will say these were pretty essy to prepare.  I sampled a little of the meat mixture before adding the sauce and cheese, and it was very tasty.  Now, the finished product was extremley RICH.  It was difficult for us to finish a small portion because of this reason.  Would definately make a cheese modification if I dared to try this again.

This was good and easy to make, but a little bland.  I would spice it up the next time I make it.

Split decision here, also.  Two loved it; two merely tolerated it.  I doubt I'll make this again.

I only used 2lbs of ground beef, 3 would have been way too much (I even think 1.5 would have been fine), but this is really delicious.  My kids gobbled it up! Next time I think I'll add some spinach as someone else suggested.
