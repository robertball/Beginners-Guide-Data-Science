The only change to look out for is the cayenne pepper.  We put just over 1/2 of one teaspoon of cayenne where it calls for 1 1/2.  Glad we didn't add more as it was spicy with just that amount.  My advice is to add your cayenne gradually and taste.  Otherwise, it was delicious!

I like this recipe with a couple of minor tweaks.  I agree with the caution flag in cayenne pepper.  I like hot spicy food but 1 1/2 teaspoons would be too hot for me.  I also would not saute the vegetables prior to making the roux. I always make my roux first, then saute the garlic, onions, pepper and celery and finally the broth, whatever other veggies you care to add, spices and gradually bring up the cayenne to your desired level.  Finally if you use that much okra you really don't need file powder.  They both serve the same purpose, thickening the gumbo.  All minor comments about a very nice recipe.

Terrible. There isn't even a roux. This is just a vegetable soup, and a bland one at that!

Delicious! I am a "new" vegan and finding some things rather tasteless! This recipe meets all my taste cravings! I did cut back on the cayenne as one reviewer suggested. It would have been fine for me but my husband doesn't like too hot.

Good overall!! I will make it again, lots of flavor.  The only changes i made were:
- didn't have any okra so used some summer squash and zucchini instead. I don't love okra that much anyway
- a little less cayenne, as others said, and that worked for me. Used about half
- wasn't enough salt for me, so i added another teaspoon or so

Two issues were:
- there was no way i could (or would) continuously whisk the roux for 15 minutes.  It would have cooked down to nothing.  I did about five minutes and it was perfect already
- too much broth called for in this recipe for me. I like my soups and stews a bit heartier/thicker, so i used five cups, and there was still a lot of broth.

I was really surprised with the recipe and loved it. As others have said I made the roux first and added the vegetable to stop the roux from over cooking.  Here are the alterations I made I substituted the eggplant with 6 cups of cooked blackeye peas ( I used thawed frozen), added 10 oz of a mix of chard, kale and mustard greens.  Only 1 tsp of cayenne, added 2 teaspoons of rice vinegar and 2 table spoons of soy sauce.

I really liked this recipe! The okra and roux gave it good authenticity. Unfortunately I couldn't find liquid smoke or file powder. Luckily I think it was plenty thick without the file, but it could have used a little more flavor, which the liquid smoke would have helped with. I used basmati rice because I had it on hand, which worked fine as a long grain rice. I also doubled the cayenne pepper (1 tablespoon). Next time I may go with more if it's for me and less if it's for others. (qualifier: I like spicy food, but I'm not as crazy as a lot of people I know).

Very good base to work from. 1/2 tsp cayenne plenty and I like it hot. For my taste could use a little more acidity--maybe some tomato paste? Will try adding some sweet potato in the leftover to introduce a different texture.

Really good. My family enjoyed this. I used less okra, since I did not have as much on hand, and cut down on the cayenne to make sure everyone would enjoy it. Also, I did not have any eggplant on hand, so I added some frozen corn near the end of the cooking time. My husband, who has never liked okra in the past, enjoyed it in the gumbo. A nice vegetarian variation on gumbo!
