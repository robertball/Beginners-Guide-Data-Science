I have been making this recipe, from an Italian restaurant in St. Lois, but it is made with chicken breasts. Everything else is exactly the same. I can't wait to make it with pork tenderloin! It's one of my guests favorite dishes. I garnish it with quickly sauteed, fresh, sage leaves!

Not for my family
I repeated this recipe step-by-step but it was not a flavor we enjoyed. It may have been better with veal. It was time consuming and labour intensive. Unfortunately,  the end result was not worth the effort.  I usually like Chef John's recipes but will not be making this one again.

Found to be good and savory. A little burnt with the sauce bit chalk that up to first attempt at this. Will try it again but with company Found the portions to be rather large. Goes good with white wine but then again what doesn't.

The taste was close to a really good breakfast sausage.  The texture is of the tenderest pork chop steak.   And with the sauce adding to the juiciness, I thought it was just wonderful.  For me, this turned out to be the best of Chef John's recipes that I've tried cooking yet.

Easy and quite authentic tasting. Amazing that pork is definitely a better substitute for veal than chicken and the chopped bits of trimmings do add greatly to the reduction at the end. Don’t skip the wine either.

Wow!  I am glad I didn't read the reviews until after I made this.  The recipe is a little labor intensive, but once you have made it a couple of times, it becomes easier.  This is by far one of my favorite recipes.  The flavor is rich, the Procuitto adds great saltiness, and the meat is so tender.  Far easier to cook than fussy Veal.  I have used this method of preparing the pork as a substitute for several "Veal" recipes, and I am very happy with results.  Thank you Chef John!

I am a big fan of Chef John’s recipes, but this one was a disappointment... I followed the recipe exactly as written, but when everything was done, the flavor was pretty bland and not tasty at all... My husband said the meat was just okay, but I could not eat it. We had to order pizza that night. Will not make again.
