HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: I've made this a part of our regular cycle for over a year now & feel lucky to have found it. Please do not substitute all cashews for this dish. I love cashews to death, but it doesn't nearly taste as good. In fact, I rated a cashew chicken recipe here worse b/c it doesn't compare. I use a full Planters Pistachio Lovers (6oz) can found next to the other peanuts at any grocery store and just remove the almonds (which makes a good snack while you make this quick dish..lol).  I was skeptical about turning my oven to 500 & then moving the temp down, but it's amazing!  Outside of that, I use italian breadcrumbs for all my recipes.  Also, if you use the raspberry sauce from the "Pork Chops with Raspberry Sauce" recipe, be sure to add an additional T of raspberry to thicken it (on stove and simmer until half evaporated: 1/4C seedless raspberry jam, 2T orange juice, 2T white wine vinegar. Then take off stove & add a dab of butter to make silky).

Love this!  We all did.  I had to tweak it as we are on South Beach.  I used whole wheat bread crumbs (one slice of WW bread in the chopper worked perfectly) and I used sugar free maple syrup instead of honey.  The maple smell filled the air as it was cooking and was heavenly.  The chicken came out moist and the coating was crunchy and a perfect blend of sweet and spicy (not hot, just flavorful).  Thank you for this quick easy wonderful recipe.

My family loved this recipe! Even my picky teenage daughter which hardly ever comes back for seconds..came back for seconds for this chicken. The chicken was so moist...I mean really, really moist. I used skinless chicken thighs instead of breast. I did change a few things. After reading many of the reviews, I made my revisions. I added 1/2 tspn of garlic powder and basil. I also added 1 tspn of onion powder and added it to the Italian bread crumbs since that was all I had on hand. I think it was a better choice for added flavor and spice. A hand full of reviewers said they didn't want to shell pistachios so they used other nuts..but shelled pistachios are readily available in cans along side all the other nuts made by planters and other brands in your local grocery. I put the nuts in my kitchen aid electric chopper...it was a snap. The raspberry sauce was really good
and I too used the raspberry sauce thats featured on this web site "pork chops w/raspberry sauce." I followed directions for that except I added alittle corn starch to thicken it to my liking.

Great recipe, the family gave it a 10 I used whole breast pounded and split in half. Was crisp and the chicken was very moist, will become a family favorite, not one bite was left. I also made the raspberry sauce and it accompanied it well.

Great recipe. I used 1/2 lb. of chicken stripes for my husband and 1/2 lb. of catfish for myself because I don't like chicken. I thought the crust tasted very good on the fish and my husband loved the chicken version. I bet the crust will taste even good on veggies. I only baked it for 15 Min. We will definitely be making this again !

I really liked this recipe but I did not use Pistachio's.  I used cashews.  I only found pistachios with the shell and I did not feel like cracking the shell and then chopping it so I used cashews which in my opinion was just as good.

Tried this recipe today & it was a winner with all the family - absolutely delicious! Served with 2 sidedishes, couscous and roasted veg (peppers, mushrooms, carrot, marrows). Used wholegrain mustard instead of dijon mustard & it was a definate 5 star all round. Thanks for the recipe, will def be cooking it again!

I was looking for a recipe like this and have not tried this exact one (yet!), but it is almost identical to the one I love to order at a local restaurant.  They also serve it with a wonderful raspberry sauce - to die for!!!!!!

This was just ok for me.  It was a little dry and sweet for my liking.  If/when I make it again, I will change the mustard mixture a little, prob decrease the honey and add a little more worchestershire sauce and let the chicken marinate a little to soak up the flavor.  I won't change the crusting at all (though, hopefully, I will be able to find already shelled pistachios next time...).  Thanks for a nice change of pace.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The first problem that we encountered was that the bread crumb mixture wasn't sticking to the chicken. Next, baking at 500 degrees is too high.  The pistachios began to burn within the first five minutes.  The chicken itself came our very dry.  I liked the ingredients in this recipe but the execution was a different story.  Adjustments need to be made.

This recipe was so easy and so delicious, made exactly as it says. My boyfriend loved it too! I'll definitely be making this again. Instead of buying breasts and cutting them into slices, I just bought pre-cut tenders. I don't think it needs a sauce of any kind, it has a unique sweetness by itself. Great flavors!

Fantastic! Made as stated and LOVED it! We got 10 chicken tenders out of this and with only two of us eating tonight-they were gone! I had to make more for my husband when he got home and he ate all 10 at once! We will definitely be making this a regular dish!

I changed to recipe with walnuts instead of pistachio, but it was still absolutely wonderful. The sauce is perfectly tangy and sweet at the same time. I separated out some sauce to drizzle on the chicken afterwards. Just perfect!

This was SO GOOD!  I took recommendations from other users and served it with the raspberry sauce from the "Pork Chops with Raspberry Sauce" recipe on this site.  I will definitely be making this recipe again and again!

This recipe comes out with a crispy delicious crust that I have not succeeded producing with with other baked chicken recipes. My fiance raves about this recipe and told his mother that she HAD to try it: Now he asks for it and helps crack the pistacios (eating some along the way :)).
Though I made the rasberry sauce, the chicken did not need it and it is still sitting in our fridge.

Very good flavor!  Definitely not a quick meal to prepare since you have to shell all the pistachios, but its so worth it!

Excellent taste and so easy to put together.  I will definitely make this again!  I had it with blackberry bbq sauce (from this website).  I would have tried it with raspberry sauce, as others recommended, but I didn't have those ingredients on hand.  I thought the blackberry sauce went very well with this recipe.  Yum!

Loved the flavor of this recipe. I substituted spicy brown mustard in for the Dijon mustard and it came out wonderfully. The only issue I had was that it came out a little dry for my liking.

Excellent! Just made it the other night - it was hit for the whole family. I definitely will be making this again. Be sure to use a good mustard tho. I've noticed for recipes that call for a dijon mustard, if you cheap out on that, it will really have a negative effect on your recipe. Delish! Thanks so much for making me look good!

Delicious!  I used panko bread crumbs which worked well.  It was moist and tasty even without a sauce as some mentioned.  I will make again.

The hubby LOVED LOVED LOVED it.  I used pork chops cut into 1 inch strips instead of chicken which is probably why it only took 15 minutes instead of 20.  So good.

This was incredible, I'm a big fan of pistachios but I never tried cooking with them until this recipe...it was difficult not to eat them while taking them out of the shells but totally worth it. My husband and son loved it so much they asked me to make it the next day too, and the raspberry sauce that's recommended with it was just YUM! This is now a favorite! Thanks for sharing!

5 STARS recipe!!! It is Delicious and Super Easy to make. A definite addition to our regular rotation meals. I followed two hints from other reviewers, 1- Used maple syrup i/o honey 2-Added some italian seasoning to the crumb/pistachio mix. My 3yr old is such a fussy eater and he absolutely loved it. He helped measure and mix ingredients. Later he wiped his plate clean in minutes:)

Made these tonight and they turned out great!  I too was nervous about having the oven high, then turning it down.  I started off at 450 then went to 375.  My tenders were done in about 15 minutes.  I did add probably about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder to the honey mixture cause I add garlic to everything!  Tasted great.  Also I used italian bread crumbs, which next time I'll probaby use just a tad less of so it doesn't over power the nut so much.  

Overall, incredible and unique flavor!  I'll definately be making this again and again!

This recipe was great!!  I used an egg and some ground mustard instead of the Dijon.  I made a dipping sauce like others suggested but I used Fig Preserves mixed with rice wine vinegar and orange juice, simmered and reduced with a pat of butter added after it came off the heat.  My husband said I should bottle the sauce!!

My daughter and her friend loved this. I didn't have any Dijon but had some Vivi's chipotle carnival mustard and it added just the right amount of heat and sweet with the honey. I mixed some more mustard and honey together for a spicy dipping sauce. Really great.

I'm a college student living in an apartment with 3 people with friends downstairs in another 4-person place.  Occasionally I cook for them because I have a lot of fun doing it.  This is one thing we all agreed was DELICIOUS and it was SO EASY! But, hard put to find pistachios, we used pecans instead and it was STILL really good.  I'm going to try the pecan crusting again tonight on a bed of spinach with dried cranberries, carrots, and balsamic vinaigrette.  Yum!

Instead of chicken strips, I cut the chicken into nugget sizes.  Shelling the pistachios was a bit time consuming, but totally worth it!  I sprinkled the extra crumbs over the chicken before baking it and it made the dish extra crunchy.  Delicious!  Great leftovers too!

Great! Didn't have cashews so I used pecans...really tasty. Love that this doesn't call for egg! Chicken was SOOOOO tender, using the oils/honey mixture. One more change...was pressed for time sor I cooked on the skillet...4-5 mins each side...delish!!!

i made this last night, using cashews in stead of pistachios (because that's what i had on hand), and used the raspberry dipping sauce other reviewers recommended. it was very flavorful and a nice change for me considering how often i eat chicken. AND i brought the leftovers to work, cut them up over a spinach salad with feta and turned the raspberry sauce into a vinagrette dressing... it's phenomenal!!!

Wow!  This was delicious!  I happened to have pork chops thawed out so I tried the recipe with the chops cut into strips and it turned out great.  I will definitely make it again with chicken.  The raspberry sauce from the Pork Chops in Raspberry Sauce recipe on this site made a delightful dip but the dish is also great without a dip.  Thanks for a new way to make chicken because my husband had been complaining about having chicken often.  He loved this and asked that I make it again soon with chicken.

Excellent dish.  My whole family loved it.  Didn't have pistachios so i used almonds.  Flattened out breasts instead of cutting into strips.  would have tasted great with a raspberry sauce.

This recipe would work with pecans, almonds, cashews, hazelnuts or peanuts. Substituting whole grain bread crumbs or even Panko would be great alternative as well. Alternate mustards could also be used. For me a recipe is a guide, never written in stone for what must be used, creativity & imagination only make things better. This is definitely a keeper.

I made this Pistachio Crusted chicken but didn't have any mustard so I decided to use Yogurt to coat the chicken then roll it in the crushed pistachio's.  It was very moist and delicious.  I've made fish with the mustard and it was delicious.  It was raining and I didn't want to make a trip to the store for mustard.  It works great with mustard or just the yogurt and pistachio's.  PS  You can buy the pistachio's out of the shell unsalted in the bulk section of your supermarket.

A Keeper.  The Dijon was a little too strong for the pistacho flavor. Next time I will cut that in half.

Love this recipe!  Added extra spices to the bread crumb/pistachio mixture, and as I am not really a big fan of honey and I didn't have any in the house, I substituted corn syrup for it.  That worked out great for us, we ended up with really juicy, flavourful chicken!

This was an incredible meal.  The only things I did different were to use Panco Bread Crumbs with Italian Seasoned bread crumbs.  I did follow the directions of some of the other reviews and made a Raspberry dipping sauce. (1/4 cup of seedless raspberry jam, 2 tbps of each orange juice and white wine vinegar and reduced it to a medium thick sauce).  I served mine with slightly steamed asparagus and vanilla glazed baby carrots.

Just made this for dinner.  Very easy and excellent dish!  We will be making it again!  We had no breadcrumbs, so we toasted up whole wheat bread and then chopped it up.  Turned out awesome. Afterwards, we made a dip of Dijon and honey to drizzle over the chicken.

I loved this!  As a vegan, I used Gardein's chick'n scallopini, and substituted agave nectar for the honey.  I also didn't have to bake it for as long, obviously. It came out SO good!  Anyway, I will DEFINITELY make this dish again and again!

My husband and I loved this chicken.  I made it according to the recipe and it was perfectly moist.  I don't usually care for honey mustard, but this was wonderful and we will definitely make it again.

I liked this, as did my teens and husband.  Moist, good flavor.  I pounded the breasts thin as another rater suggested rather than strips. Agree that the dipping sauce (raspberry preserves and red wine vinegar) is a good accompaniment.

Came out a bit salty - I have to remember to reduce the salt because the pistachios already have it in. Other than that, it was pretty good! Made some raspberry sauce to go with it - raspberry jam, red wine vinegar and some red pepper flakes.

Easy quick affordable and tastes good! For my version I made skewers. When I made it I did not find it to be sickly sweet or "mustardy" tasting and the Pistachios get soft as they bake so their not jaw breaking crunchy and the nutty flavor is not at all over powering. I used the sauce as a marinade for the chicken and let sit overnight in fridge. I intend to use the sauce alone as a dipping sauce or marinade in other future recipes. Since it was my first time trying this recipe I had no idea what it would taste like and I wanted to make a meal so I opted to pair with a simple white rice and tomatoes cut into quarters with a raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Whether serving alone or with sides, I highly recommend making the raspberry dipping sauce (seedless raspberry jam & red wine vinegar warmed in microwave)

I have made this chicken numerous times!  We enjoy keeping it as a chicken breast (not cutting it into strips) but  pound thin instead.  I also have used chopped pecans instead of pistacios.  Excellent recipe!!  One of our very favorites!!!

This is very good but a bit labor intensive and messy and pistachios are expensive! It's very good but not worth the expense and effort.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it turned out wonderful.  My husband and I both loved it.  It would be great to make for company as you can prepare the chicken ahead of time and cook just before it is needed.  I also tried making the raspberry sauce as recommended by others and it went to waste.  My husband and I thought it was too sweet and took away from the flavor of the chicken.

This was good!  It had a very different taste than anything I have had before, but it was good and the kids liked it too!  I also made with the raspberry sauce and it was a nice compliment.  I will make again, but next time I will try and get the pistachios to a finer consistency.  I put them in the food processor, but I think I will do it longer next time.  Thanks!

My husband said "Wow babe, this is company worthy!". I followed the recipe but reduced the olive oil a bit,baked for 20 miutes. Moist & yummy. Next time I may increase the mustard and honey just a bit.

My husband & daughter looked at the finished product and made faces.  They put only one in their plate, tasted it and loved it!  This is a keeper.  I use 3 T Dijon, 1 T honey because we don't like it sweet.  I also make it using parmesan cheese in place of the pistachios.  Thanks Julie!

LOVED this!!  Super yummy and easy to prepare.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I didn't have enough pistachios so I also added some chopped up almonds.  I made a dipping sauce out of what I had laying around: raspberry-jalapeno jelly, 2tsp balsamic vinegar, and 2tsp orange juice, nuked in the microwave for 2.5 minutes.  Delish-- and gone in less than 10 minutes.  Will definitely repeat.

This was a lovely way to treat chicken we buy from the meat market marinated and ready to bake. We always look for new ways to enjoy it. Even though the chicken is delicious by itself this adds a whole new dimension that does not take away from delicious flavorful chicken on the inside with this crunchy pistachioso texture on the outside. It's a keeper.

Made exactly as is, though I just mixed all ingrediants together and put on the chicken rather than do it in stages. It was most excellent - a new regular for our family!

I was so disappointed in this recipe. It is way to sweet for my liking. The saltyness of the pistachios combined with the sweetness of the honey does not make a good combination. Unfortunately I will not be making this again.

This was awesome!! I was afraid the chicken would dry out or it would lack flavor but I was so wrong! The chicken was moist and the pistachios combined with the honey mustard bath complemented each other nicely. I did use panko instead of bread crumbs and set the chicken (boneless breast) on a rack on a cookie sheet. Family loved it!

This was pretty good. I was a bit unsure about using pistachio's it sounded good but odd. But I had some shelled pistachios that no one was eating anymore & it was just enough to make this. It was pretty good & a nice change to our usual dinner. I made exactly as written & except I had 4 thin chicken breasts that I left whole rather than cutting into strips. My husband & I enjoyed it was good but not the best thing we ever had & if I ever have pistachio's around again I would probably make this again.

Super delicious, especially over some spring greens with a touch of honey mustard dressing.   Only downfall was the breading was soft--definitely not crispy--after baking and some stuck to the pan, but that could have been my error.  But the taste was well worth it.  Definitely will make again.    Do yourself a favor and buy the pre-shelled pisatchios.  Definitely a time saver.

Liked the crust, but lacking in flavor.  Missing something, but don't know what!  Will not try again.

I was really surprised with how great this chicken tasted.    I did reduce the bread crumbs to 1/4 a cup and am glad because I think 1/2 would have tasted a little to breaded.

AMAZING!! This is the greatest chicken recipe ever. Didn't change a thing and followed everything to the exact specifications. My husband makes this and it is so yummy. Pistachios make this dish perfect. Also, if you change everything about this recipe (type of nuts, type of sauce, type of chicken, EVERYTHING ELSE)... it's not the same thing.... make your own recipe to call your own. Whoever created this recipe posted it the way it should be made.. not the way you want it.. like I said go create your own recipe.

This was SO yummy. I used chicken tenders, so I only needed to bake about 16 minutes. I used Italian-style breadcrumbs, so I didn't add any salt to the honey, dijon, olive oil step...just freshly ground pepper. I pulsed the pistachios in the food processor for just a few seconds (still chunky, but not quite breadcrumb consistency). I, too, bought the Pistachio Lovers can of mixed nuts and picked out the pistachios. Cheaper and you don't have to crack open each one. This went great with mashed potatoes. Comes together quickly...would make this any night!

This was really good. I followed the recipe as written and received rave reviews all around my dinner table. The flavour of honey mustard and crunch of coarsely ground pistachios were terrific! A keeper for sure!

This is absolutely delicious! Made it for my brother and his pregnant wife and they scarfed it all down in minutes.  22 minutes baking time is what I used and the texture was perfect.

"I cant believe that someone can make something this good @ home" The exact words from my husband regarding this dish.
It was  tender, juicy, and simply delicious. The best part- EASY EASY EASY to make.

My hard to please daughter LOVED it. She's on a gluton free diet, so I used a corn flake mix instead of the bread crumbs. Also didn't havge dijion mustard,so I just used honey mustard.

husband said this was good, i just wasnt thrilled with it...neither were the kids.  bought the pistachio lovers nuts at the grocery store and ground them (just the pistachios) up - it was just right for the recipe.  seemed like the dijon/honey taste got lost in the cooking though. actually, there wasnt a real obvious, outstanding flavor to this dish.  used italian bread crumbs. thanks for the try!

I enjoyed this, as did the kids.  It came out a little too sweet, probably because I was out of bread crumbs and used cornflakes instead.  Next time I'll probably add more salt than I did this time.  Other than that these were great and will be made again!

the best!! I chopped the pistachios in my food processor, finer than the ones i the picture. I also added dried herbs, garlic salt and cayenne to the bread crumb mixture. Instead of honey I used agave nectar. Baked for exactly 20 minutes and the chicken was juicy! But I left in the oven with the oven turned off and it dried a bit up. I'm sure I'll do this over and over!

This was good. I made a honey mustard dipping sauce to go with. I used chicken tenders and cut up in small chunks. They baked in about 5 minutes.

This one is a keeper!  I let the chicken marinade in the honey Dijon mixture for a short time before breading.  I didn't have any pistachios, so used pecans and it was delicious.  I will try pistachios next time.  Only complaint was that the breading didn't crisp up enough - may be my error, but will try substituting cornmeal for part of the breadcrumbs next time.  The 500 degree starting temp may be the reason for such tender chicken -- will definately try this technique again.

Wonderful!!  It is so easy and so delicious.  It quickly became a staple around our house.  My nine year old brother calls it the really good chicken with the stuff on it and he is incredibly picky.  Not a lot of adjustments needed

I was disappointed with this dish.  Sure sounded good and most who reviewed it  loved it but just not our favorite thing. I love pistachio's and they are one of the top ten best foods for you to eat but I will eat them plain next time.

It wasn't bad, but I felt like the mustard flavor was overwhelming. I used the correct amounts, but I tasted the mustard much more than the pistachios. Not a favorite. Sorry!

WOW!  Thanks so much! I think the temp was just perfect.  500 on pre-heat and then down to 375 made the chicken so tender and juicy!  I also made the raspberry sauce with the seedless jam plus red wine vinegar.  Nice touch!

Absolutely delicious! Made this for a very special Mother's Day dinner. We served with two dipping sauces: Chipotle Honey BBQ sauce (right from the bottle) & Orange Marmalade (mixed w/ a little warm water for a dipping consistency) We followed the Pistachio Chicken recipe exactly as written---it was quite easy to prepare and really had a gourmet taste.  Served with a Basil Spinach Bacon Blue Cheese salad & Roasted Rosemary Potatoes. Thanks for this WONDERFUL recipe!

This recipe really is as simple and delicious as everyone is saying.  I made this for my family and everyone loved it!  I took others advice and made the raspberry sauce from the Pork Chop and Raspberry sauce recipe and thought it was a perfect finishing touch to the dish.

Absolutely delicious!!  I put the pistachios in my food processor so they would be chopped very fine, otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.  Would be good also with a Thai peanut sauce for dipping but didn't have time to make it last night.  This is a keeper!

Delicious! We had a bag of pistachios to use up so I tried this recipe using other reviewer suggestions for the sauce proportions. I didn't cut the chicken breasts up, just baked them whole. Served with mixed sauteed veggies on the side. Leftovers reheated well.

I will make this again; however, as another reviewer noted, the ratio of wet to dry ingredients is off.  I used a little over a pound of chicken tenders and didn't have enough sauce but too much breading.  Next time I will decrease the pistachios to 3/4 cup and breadcrumbs to 1/4 cup.  I have 3 suggestions on the sauce.  If you want to maintain the original sweetness, increase to 3 T. mustard, 3 T. honey and same oil.  If you want less sweetness, use 4 T. mustard, 2 T. honey  and 2 T. oil.  My third suggestion for a different flavor kick is to keep portions the same and add 1 T. steak sauce such as A1 (idea from another highly rated honey mustard recipe on this site).  The key is to taste the sauce and adjust to your preference.  For reference, this is not a strong coating.  All the flavors are mild yet individually discernible.  I consider this more of a simple comfort food dish than a 'wow' dish.

I found the pistachio/breadcrumb part to be way out of proportion to the chicken - I ended up using half of the crumb mix for the amount of chicken specified.  I guess don't add all the mix to the bowl you'll dip your chicken in, and just refill it a bit at a time.  Otherwise, it was a good recipe.  Boyfriend and I both liked it, and I'll make it again (especially as I have extra pistachioed breadcrumbs!).

Great recipe, I used macadamia nuts intstead of Pistachio, and added a bit of coconut to the breading mixture. Also followed others advice and made a glaze with raspberry vinegrette and jam. The whole family loved it.

This is fantastic!  I don't think any sauce is needed...the chicken is so moist and flavorful from dipping it in the honey mustard and then you get the crunchy, savory taste from the pistachios.  With the full cup of chopped pistachios, I definitely tasted them and it added a great flavor.   Excellent recipe.

This recipe sounded so good to me on paper, but I was left feeling let down. I thought for being only moderately good it was a lot of trouble to prepare. I prefer a crunchy coating like corn flakes.

Raspberry sauce is a must. Added oregano for depth. Could add spice for heat? Easily substitute cranberry goodness.

Oh my goodness... This was fabulous.  I followed the recommendations of others and served it with raspberry sauce from the pork recipe, and it was perfect.  I've already made it twice for compant, and will continue to do so in the future.

Great! I used about 3/4 cup pistachios and was still able to pull out 1/3 cup breading to save for later. The chicken was still fully breaded and tasty.

This was excellent and very moist! Tasted exactly like the Pistachio Crusted Chicken I order at my local Italian restaurant! I wouldn't change a thing! Served with angel hair pasta with an olive oil and garlic sauce.

Very good!  I’d make it again. I used Panko (Italian) and added garlic and onion powder.  It didnt need a sauce, though i’m sure it would be good.

I followed the recipe exactly and LOVED it.. I am no chef and my boyfriend was very impressed.  To put in reference how little I cook, I actually chopped pistachios with knife for twenty minutes before it occurred to me to put them in a blender.
So, yeah, if I can do this, so can you!

Probably the best chicken dish I have made.  Did it exactly as instructions said ingredient wise, normal bread crumbs, not italian. 22 min in oven was perfect, no sauce needed at all.

Absolutely delicious! My whole family said this is the best chicken recipe ever. So tasty. I didn't have Dijon mustard as my kids are not a fan. I used coarse ground mustard instead and they loved it.

Loved it! I am crazy for pistachios and this was the first time I've ever thought to make chicken  with them. I had  used almond meal instead of breading due to dietary restrictions and it was very tasty and plan to add this recipe to our regular rotation of favorite meals.

Loved this, so good, left out the oil, no need for it and it only adds tons of calories. Changed the servings to 10 for 5 breasts.... However, one breast feeds one person, not 2. I had a lot of breading mixture left over, so I put it in the freezer for another time. Wld like to eliminate the honey as well somehow, no one needs all that sugar.

This is good but needs a gravy or sauce, as it's a little dry as is.  The cook time is spot on.  I added my own spices in addition to salt and pepper.

Tender and juicy but remember to bake at 375.  One reviewer left it at 500, leaving it badly overdone.   Note that I have stopped taken to grinding the pistachios to near-dust.  They coat better and don't fall off.

I used chicken thighs. I did everything else EXACTLY as directed......best chicken ever!!!!  Mustard and honey made the coating pop.  Served on cauliflower purée and baked kale. I bought the stuff to make the raspberry dipping sauce but this chicken was too too perfect to dip in anything!!!!!  I'll do it next time (maybe)??!

Best chicken my husband and father in law have ever had. I used a food processor to chop pistachios very small so they would stick. I also didn't cut into strips. Just used bone in skinless chicken thighs.

Very easy and tasty as is, no sauce. Be careful that the topping does not burn.  If you cover it to prevent burning, the topping will get soggy, so leave time to crisp it up. Can be done with frozen chicken breast, just add extra time.

I made this recipe for my husband and when I went back to the kitchen to clean up the leftovers, they were gone! I made up a recipe for cranberry honey mustard sauce to go with it and it is delicious! Making it again tonight :)

We enjoyed it!  Made exactly as written and while it was very good, the pistachios made it a little too heavy tasting.

Glad I made it, thanks for sharing!

The family loved it!!  Easy to prepare and came out the oven moist cooked on the inside and crisp on the outside.  I used equal amounts of breadcrumbs and "crushed" pistachios : I put the crushed nuts in a plastic resealable bag and pummelled them for a couple of minutes using a meat tenderizer.  Err on the side of making more of the Dijon mixture.

This was outstanding!  The only change I made was to put the pistachios in the food processor so that they'd stick to the chicken better.  I have not found a really good recipe for chicken in awhile, but now this is it!

This was very tasty.  I would like to figure out a way to make it crisper...as it was a little too moist.

Made exactly as stated and it was great! Crispy, moist, and not your everyday chicken. I also made the raspberry sauce on the side and it was delicious together. It's all that I ate this entire day because it was that good

This is a very good dish. Mine turned out a little dry, so using a sauce to dip the chicken in or for added flavor is a good idea. Overall taste is superb.

This was great! I put the pistachio's in the blender and they turned a bit into pistachio butter, so maybe another setting next time. Great flavor though!

Wonderful recipe, I followed the directions as is and added some dried basil and minced onion to the breading and then I didn't have any raspberry preserve so I used what I had which was blackberry preserve and it was great! Finally something my picky 3 year old loves!!!

Loved this recipe.  We used unsalted pistachios to keep the sodium content down, and it was still good.  Served with roasted garlic cous cous and corn.  The family loved it.

I tried frying the chicken instead of baking... didn't turn out to well. Stick with baking in the oven. A great recipe, my fiance loved it.

Really easy to make -- very tasty! The pistachios add a very nice flavor to the chicken. I will defintely make this again. I loved it, and my husband can't stop eating the leftovers (they don't stay in the fridge very long!)

Very different flavor, but yummy. It was a pain opening and crushing up the nuts, and it's more expensive than its worth to buy them already without the shells. Overall I enjoyed it.

Very yummy! Didn't change a thing and it came out super yummy! Made the raspberry dipping sauce to go with it, as others recommended, but actually used strawberry jam- couldn't find seedless raspberry. The dipping sauce really added to it! Will make it again! Thanks!

Absolutely phenomenal! Great for entertaining, everyone is super impressed. My mom loved these, inlaws, and friends, they all wanted the recipe! and it's so easy! even easier- get the de-shelled pistachios :) Also, tonight i'm going to try this recipe with paneko bread crumbs for an even lighter taste :) For the sauce, i used a raspberry syrup for desert, it works perfectly!

My boyfriend made this for me (and he does not cook very often) but it turned out delicious. He used a bit more honey than asked because I love the chicken-honey combination. We ate it with a side of mac n cheese. Perfect and not too difficult!!

The flavor in this was awesome! Just don't make the mistake I did and try and coat all of the chicken at the same time (in a ziplock). The crumb mixture will glop and then it is hard to get even. My mistake caused me to make this is a casserole dish instead, but we loved it anyway!

I didn't have bread crumbs or pistachio nuts, so I had to use special K (crushed in a plastic bag) and toasted almonds -- but the honey, mustard and olive oil are the key to this recipe.  I cut the chicken into nugget sized pieces so every bite was well coated.  I almosted licked the pan... Yum!

Very delicious and easy to prepare!  I doubled the sauce mixture, and this turned out to be exactly the right amount.  Beyond that, I followed the recipe exactly and got wonderful results.  My fiancé and I absolutely loved this meal and will definitely be making this again!

This was fantastic! I received it via the daily emial and hadnt seen any of the other reviews. I just followed the recipe, it WAS easy, quick and delicious. My husband and kids (3 and 4.5yrs) LOVED it. The chicken was moist and juicy and just perfect. I served it with the rosted veg recipe I also got via allrecipes.com. This will definatly be making a return to out dinner table. Thumbs up form me.

Excellent!  I used chicken thighs as I think they have more flavour and are more moist.  I put the pistachios in a ziploc bag and used a hammer to gently crush them.  Everything else I kept the same and the strips were wonderful.  Thank you!

I had high hopes for this recipe after reading reviews but don't see what all the fuss is about. I thought it was a little bland and my boyfriend wasn't impressed either.

This is an easy-to-make, tasty recipe. I made as indicated, except did not cut the chicken into strips - I coated chicken breasts with the mustard mixture and then coated with the breadcrumb-nut mixture; this method used all the crumbs and nuts - none left over. Thanks for the great recipe Julie.

i ended up using regular sized chicken breasts...i think that this recipe would be better on tenders.  okay recipe overall.  it has a unique look to the breading, which can lead to a nice presentation.  both of my kids ate it:)

My husband and I have never tasted such tender chicken.  I didn't have pistachios so I made this with pine nuts, but I plan to get some pistachios for the next time. I will certainly be sharing this with all my friends.

This recipe was pretty good.  It definitely needed the raspberry sauce-I used a raspberry barbeque sauce from this website.

This is a little heavy in you stomach...but very tasty. Eat a small portion and you'll be quite satisfied.

It was alright. I didn't really see where the pistachios flavered it much. I do think it would have been better with the sauce as the others have suggested.
