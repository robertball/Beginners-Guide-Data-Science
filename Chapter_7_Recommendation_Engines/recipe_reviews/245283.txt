Took this to church potluck.. went over very well. Was told it was wonderful and phenomenal. And I agree. I may have used more chips in the recipe as I had probably 2/3 of a bag to use up. It felt very heavy lifting it and I was afraid it might be dry brick. It wasn't... moist dense and superb. Any mix of chips and nuts would work well in this
